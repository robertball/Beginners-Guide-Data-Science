I thought this recipe was very good...but I didn't care for all the ingredients needed for the results.  It tasted similar to what I tend to do for slow cooker ribs.  I simplyt seasoned the ribs with garlic salt, onion powder, and black pepper; place in the crock pot and cover the ribs with a half a bottle of KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce.  I let the ribs cook on low for about 8-10 hours.  Then I place them in the oven on a baking sheet for a half hour so that the sauce caramelizes onto the meat.  It works every time!

The genius of this recipe is the first step - roasting ribs in the oven. This removes fat and liquid that would otherwise cause soupy results in the crockpot. For this, it deserves 5 stars!! Use any sauce (I like 1 C. ketchup, 1 C. Stubb's barbecue sauce, 2 T. brown sugar, 1 t. Worcestershire, and Tabasco hot sauce to taste.) The original sauce recipe (which I've tried) isn't sharp or hot enough for our tastes. We use boneless beef chuck country ribs, 2 lbs. or more. Stir once during cooking time so ribs don't stick to sides and burn. To thicken sauce a bit, put the crockpot on High, with the lid ajar, during the last half hour.  WONDERFUL!

The sauce tastes alot like ketchup. It is not horrible but it is below average. Do not make this recipe because if you read all of the reviews, no one actually made it by the recipe! Everyone changed it to BBQ sauce..so they should not have rated it higher than a star or two. No one hwo made it by recipe liked it. Just slow cook in your favorite bbq sauce, you will be 100% happier! But slow cooking th emeat that long is FABULOUS.

OH MY GOSH--these were the most incredible ribs I have ever tasted, in or out of a restaraunt! I followed other reviewers' advice and substituted bbq sauce for the ketchup, (2 cups) and ketchup for the chili sauce. (1 cup) I cut back on the vinegar to 2 1/2 Tbsp. just because I thought 4 Tbsp. was a lot. I also left out the hot sauce, simply because I didn't have any on hand. I used boneless Country Style Ribs. I couldn't get them out of the crock pot in one piece, they were soo tender! Thank you so much for this recipe, it is definitely one of the BEST on this site!!! I would HIGHLY reccommend trying this one! :)

This rib recipe convinced my dinner guest that he needs a slow cooker!  I substituted the 2 cup equivalent of my favorite BBQ sauce for the ketchup and they were delicious.  I would also recommend rotating the ribs halfway through the cooking process if possible so that all the ribs are equally tender.  This just became my favorite slow cooker recipe.

Five stars for the crock pot suggestion.    Best prep is simmering ribs in water bath (with minced garlic, seasoned salt & Emeril's southwestern spice), for 20 minutes; then prepare BBQ sauce of choice (approx 2 cups), add to drained ribs and cook in crock pot for 5-6 hours on low.  Remove from crock pot and brown ribs on grill or under broiler.

I always get told I make the bestest ribs from soldiers thanks to this recipe! FIRST, do not ignore the baking in the oven first b/c it removed 1/2" of fat juice in a 9X13 pan!!!  THEN, it was hard to decide what sauce to follow since there were a lot of choices suggested, so I went to the most reliable (top rated on the site) called Sylvia's Ribs b/c why ruin perfect ribs?! Basically, dump 2C ketchup, 1C bbq 1C brown sugar, 2.5T lemon juice, 2t Worcestershire, several dashes of hot pepper, 3T steak sauce, cloves garlic ...directly into crockpot.  LASTLY, most of the sauces used will be thin in the end, so definitely take out and put in oven at 375 for 20 min to caramelize the sauce onto the ribs (make sure ribs are covered in sauce when you put in oven).  These were perfect!  You will be a hero if you have a house full of men like me.

This was soooooo good.  I substitued half of the ketchup with BBQ sauce and used red wine vinegar and it came out better than ribs at some of the restaurants.  My husband is a great ribs fan so will definitely make this again.

This recipe is great!!! The meat was sooo tender and the sauce was tasty with a good kick but not overwhelmingly spicy. I wouldn't change a thing except up the chili sauce and hot sauce if you're a fan of more heat.

And just a note to several of the other reviewers... If you just dumped a bottle of barbeque sauce into the slow cooker instead of following the recipe to at least some degree, you really have no reason to write a review. Trust me, this sauce tastes nothing like KC Masterpiece, all you really did was look at this to find out how long to cook them. Why waste our time with a completely unhelpful review?

This recipe was as good as the other reviews indicated.  I implemented the variations suggested by others such as substituting BBQ sauce for half of the ketchup, adding garlic salt, using red wine vinegar and adding a little liquid smoke.  Superb!

This was an awesome dish!!! I have recently been to three rib burn-off's and Suzanne's recipe was well worthy of competing! I did, however, add a little bit of garlic powder to the pork before cooking, and I added garlic to the sauce. (By the way, the sauce was PERFECT! No more will I buy BBQ sauce, this recipe blows Open Pitt and KC Masterpiece out of the water!)

This is a very good method of cooking ribs. Like others, i substituted my own BBQ sauce.   But I must say something to reviewers who Completely Change the Method:  The biggest benefit of using a crock pot is the slow cooking and the easy cleanup! I don't understand why some people suggest to simmer in water, use the crock pot and then cook them again in either stove or grill! Then it becomes a grilling or broiling recipe, that uses a crock pot for one of the steps!  I guess i just have a pet peeve when people COMPLETELY change either the cooking method or the recipe and then rate THEIR version!  Ok that's off my chest, lol.  Enjoy your Ribs everyone!

I find it amusing that some people get so upset when reviewers change or add to the recipe.  This is what I enjoy the most - hearing how others tweek the recipe.  I've fixed these before and they were so soupy.  Now that I've read others remarks, I know why and how to correct it.  So, please, all you others, keep on making suggestions and telling how you make a recipe better!

As good as any restaurant!  Make these ribs!  I very rarely take the time to write a review, but these were so good, I view it as my civic duty to let people know how good this recipe is!  The secret to making fall-off-the-bone tender ribs has eluded me for nearly 20 years... until now!  The ribs turned out fantastic, truly as good as you can find in any restaurant.  I'm not exaggerating!  MY MODIFICATIONS:  I did what many other people suggested and used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup (actually, I used BBQ sauce and some honey), and I used ketchup in place of chili sauce.  I also added many dashes of hot sauce (like 15) and a little bit of liquid smoke.  Before serving the ribs, I put them on a foil-lined baking sheet, spooned some of the sauce onto them, and baked them at 425 degrees for about 10 minutes per side.  I did this to carmelize some of the sauce onto the ribs.   Again, these were excellent!  The meat came right of the bone as soon as I sank my teeth into it.

Easy to make and clean up. What's not to like about that? Great 'summer meal' that you can make in the dead of winter.

I used 8 lbs of spareribs for generous servings for 5 people and had enough left over for one extra, which were gone before bedtime, they were so good. I used this recipe for the method, which worked perfectly. I baked them first as listed (I didn't take off the fat lining (?) before, but it wasn't a problem). Then I cut them into serving sizes, coated them with the BBQ sauce- from a bottle, and cooked them on the 8 hr. low setting in the slow cooker.Because I had so many, half way through I took them out and rearranged them so the ones on top went to the bottom to help them cook evenly. Around 7 1/2 hrs, they were done, totally tender, but still on the bone, which I wanted. Then as reviewers advised, I put them on a foil lined cookie sheet, spooned more sauce on them and stuck them under the broiler for 5 mn. They were perfect!!!

I made these ribs in my crockpot this past weekend and my boyfriend LOVED them. I bought county style ribs and first browned them in the oven for about 1/2 hr (15 min. on each side). Then i put them into the crockpot and covered them with the sauce. I used 2 cups of sweet baby rays bbq sauce, i cup of ketchup, 1/4 cup of brown sugar, vinagar, and worcestershire sauce. I let them cook on low for about 7 hours. I then removed the ribs and put them back into the oven to brown for about 10 min so the sauce would stick to the ribs better. They were soooooo tender, the meat literally fell off of the bone when i was removing them from the crockput. I will definitely be making these again!!!!!

I am a pretty good cook; however, I have never made baby back ribs before. I made this last night and it was fabulous!  I read the reviews and made the substitutions (BBQ sauce for Ketchup, Ketchup for Chile Sauce as I had none). I followed everything else exactly.  Question: If we double the sauce, could we slow cook 2 slabs of ribs at a time ... has anyone tried this? Another comment: DO remove the back membrane, and DO cut them before putting in slow cooker. I cut into 3 sections - next time I will cut into 4 sections.

Great. I did the same as others and used bbq sauce and ketchup. I also seasoned with garlic powder, onion powder, pepper and a little paprika. I did the 15 minutes on each side in the oven at 350. I put them in the slow cooker, poured the mixture and cooked for 6 1/2 hours. I took them out and placed them on an aluminum pan, poured the sauce on top and put them back in the oven for 10 minutes at 300 which gave them an opportunity to carmelize. SIMPLY DELICIOUS.

Awesome ribs! I've tried par-boiling (yuck), cooking on a low heat in the oven (dry)...but this worked out wonderful. I bought 2 - 3lb slabs of b-b ribs. Baked as directed at 450. I had cut each slap in 3rds to get the to fit into the crockpot. After reading a lot of reviews, I opted not to try this sauce; instead I used Sweet Baby Rays original bbq sauce. My crock pot has a 10 hour setting which I used since I leave for work at 8 and get home at 5. Next time I won't cook quite as long. Don't forget to remove the skin-like membrane located on the bone side of the ribs. My husband & 2 teenage sons said these were better ribs than at their favorite bbq joint!

This was the first time I've ever done ribs in a slow cooker.  It won't be the last!!  My husband said it was the best thing I've ever cooked.    I followed a few of the other reviews and did 1c bbq sauce (Kraft Hickory Smoke) and 1c ketchup instead of 2c ketchup.  I also added roughly 1 tsp of Liquid Smoke.  I was generous with fresh ground pepper, salt, and garlic powder on the meat before placing in the oven.    The ingredients combined to make a wonderful sauce.  I used 8 nice sized country style bone in ribs and the mixture was exactly the right amount to cover the meat and cooked wonderfully.  I moved and turned the pieces a few times during cooking just to make sure it all cooked evenly.  Cooked on low for 6 hours and the last 20 minutes I turned to high and set the lid ajar so the sauce would thicken a little as recommended by another review and it was perfect.  I served with fried fresh garden squash and slow cooked green beans.  It made an excellent meal.  Will certainly be making these ribs again!

THESE RIBS ARE BEYOND FANTASTIC!  We happen to be hopeless addicts of "Sweet Baby Rays" BBQ sauce so I used that in place of this recipes BBQ sauce recipe, but the cooking method alone is FIVE STAR.  The meat was just sliding off the bones and EVERYONE raved about them!!!  If you can't get to your grill you have GOT to try these ribs!  Once in the slow cooker they were on auto pilot!  My ribs were cut into sections of 3 manly rib portions so I did turn them once and used a turkey baster and basted them twice during cooking.  My lg. slow cooker runs hot and they were done to perfection at 5.5 hrs on low.

***NOTE: To the one person giving these a "C" rating because they are not really BBQ'd ribs and lack smoke flavor?  If you crave smoke flavor just add a drop or two of liquid smoke.  There is NO WAY a crock-pot recipe will ever compare in taste to traditional grilling and most cooks would know that instantly.  However..these CAME DANG CLOSE!  They were INHALED in a flash.

It is somewhat frustrating to hear everyone speaking badly about this recipe.  Because that is what it is... a recipe.  Recipes are meant to be altered to different likings for different people.  The first time I read this recipe I knew not to use ketchup because i don't want to eat ribs with a tomato favor in it.  So, everyone needs to stop complaining about that and read the recipe first.  I mean it gives you the ingredients on the recipe in which ketchup is listed.  If you don't want your ribs to taste like ketchup, use bbq sauce... its that simple.  And about the meat being too tender? you can always toss the ribs back in the over on broil for 10-15 minutes per side, or you could even throw them on the bbq to glaze/crisp them up a bit.  Its basic common sense here people.  I used salt/pepper while initially cooking in the oven, took them out and in the slow cooker and then added some olive oil, with a rub and brown sugar and bbq sauce only, no ketchup.  Cooked 6 hours and then threw them on the bbq to blacken them up a bit.  They were some of the best.  And to those who get really tough ribs, you have to check the quality of the meat used, and make sure you have the entire bottom of the slow cooker full with sauce and the ribs themselves coated in bbq sauce.  The recipe isn't meant to be difficult.  Change it to how you like it and leave out the ingredients you don't like.

I would give this 5 stars but I didn't use the sauce it called for. I used a bottle that I prefer but the technique itself for cooking the ribs were perfect! They were falling off the bone and finger lickin' good! This is my goto for ribs, thanks for the recipe!

Did the oven part for 20 minutes each side@ 400 after rubbing with salt, pepper, garlic powder, garlic salt, garlic and herb spice mix, and Lawreys. Used Sweet Baby Ray's lightly after taking out of the oven, 5 hours on low in the crock pot. My first attempt at baby back ribs, got rave reviews from people that are accomplished cooks - only recipe I'll ever use. Take membrane off the underside before starting process.

Great idea to slow cook the ribs!
I tried it for a potluck last week and the ribs were "fall-off-the-bone, finger-lickin' good!"
A couple of notes, though - 1) For baby back ribs, I suggest closer to 6 hours than 8.  Too long, and the bones seriously just fall out.  Spare ribs can definitely handle the full 8 hours.  2) For simplicity, I also tossed in salt, pepper & garlic then just used BBQ sauce instead of following the recipe here.  3) I finished the ribs in the oven at 375 for about 15-20 minutes to get a little crisp on the outside.
I will definitely make these again!  So easy.

My favorite part of this site is seeing how what other people have to say about recipes.  However, this one is a head scratcher.  Ignoring a recipe all together, and replacing it with a bottle of BBQ sauce hardly deserves a rating or review.  Who needs this site for a bottle of something poured over meat?  If any of my fellow Texans find out I made BBQ in a slow cooker, I may have my Texan card revoked.  It was worth the risk.  I liked the recipe as-is...maybe a tiny bit extra brown sugar, and a teaspoon of liquid smoke.  6 hours was plenty for us.  We doubled the meat with same amount of sauce.  The juice from the extra meat probably made the sauce a little thinner, but it was still good.

Unless a submitted recipe obviously has some kind of mistake, I first try it the way the cook submits it.  Prepared these exactly as in the recipe and they were delicious. The BBQ sauce in this recipe was just enough sweet and just enough spice. Browned at 400 prior placing in crockpot burned off the fat which allowed the BBQ sauce flavors to work without draining off the ribs. Thank you for submitting your recipe.

I have made this several times using the recipe exactly as written and everyone I've served it to has loved it.  I think the secret is baking the ribs first to remove the excess fat.  I usually make the sauce the night before, cover and refrigerate overnight so the flavors can meld.  No one has ever said the sauce tasted like ketchup.  In fact they wanted the recipe it was so good.  If there are any ribs leftover, I refrigerate along with the remaining sauce.  I just reheat in the microwave and reheat the sauce and I got another great barbecue rib dinner.

These were amazing! So tender.
I did not have chili sauce so I did what other users suggested and subbed 2 cups of BBQ sauce for the ketchup, and 1 cup ketchup for the chili sauce. It worked very well.

This recipe is the best I have found for ribs, and a couple of tips make it even better.  First, as others have said, I use KC Masterpiece to replace the ketchup.  Second, I remove the membrane from the underside of the ribs so that the seasoning may better penetrate the ribs.  Third, I cut the ribs into section of two bones each just after sprinkling with salt and pepper.  This allows for better penetration of the sauce.  Finally, I don't use a mixing bowl for the sauce--I put all the ingredients into the crock pot, stir, and then start the crock pot at the same time that I start roasting the ribs.  I then toss the ribs in the warm sauce, which makes it easier to coat all surfaces.

This recipe is really a method. You can use any sauce you want. I made mine from a bunch of sauces I had in the fridge including asian sauces. I also added liquid smoke.

But do pre-brown, then slow cook, followed by searing under the broiler or on the grill. 

These are VERY GOOD ribs. I used spare ribs. We loved these ribs.

These were fantastic!!  I browned them in the oven like the recipe says, don't skip this part!  You get a nice crust and drain some of the fat.  I browned them and mixed the sauce up the night before and threw it all in a bowl and stuck it in the fridge.  In the morning i just tossed it all in the crockpot and let it cook for 8 hours.  When I got home from work, i was a little bummed b/c the sauce looked so thin, I put the ribs and sauce on a sheet pan and baked for about 15 minutes at 400 and MAN were these GOOD- the sauce carmelized and thickened up beautifully. The best ever.  Thanks!!!!

So good and tender! After baking I seasoned the ribs with garlic and onion powder.  Then  I cooked the ribs in half a bottle(the big one) of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and about 2 cups of water.  I also added a little Louisiana hot sauce and a splash of orange juice.  I cooked them for about 5 hours in the crock pot on low, then smothered the ribs in the rest of the BBQ sauce and broiled it for about 5 minutes!  My husband said they are my best ribs ever!

Excellent! The secret is putting them into the oven prior to the slow cooker.. That will release the fat & liquid from the ribs and keep the sauce from becoming to soupy. I followed PEACHESNCREAM2  advise and only used the 1cup ketchup, 1 cup BB sauce 2 TBLS brown sugar and 2tsp vinegar, I also added minced garlic to the mixture and cooked in my slow cooker for 6 hours...Fall off the bone delicious.

I just tripled this recipe for a party, and everyone RAVED about them. I altered the sauce just a bit... I used half the ketchup and the other half Sweet Baby Ray's Original sauce. I added fresh garlic and I used half the amount of vinegar but used red wine vinegar. I omitted the hot sauce. I was lucky enough to get the meatiest baby back ribs I've ever seen, and they were just fall of the bone tender. And SO easy!

I do a dry rub the night before on the ribs and cover them with non stick foil.  Take them out of the fridge the next morning, throw foil away, and put them in the crockpot.  Cover in BBQ sauce and cook on low for 8 hours.  Amazing!

4 because I did not exactly follow the recipe after reading all the reviews and everyones suggestions for changes to the recipe. I've mad these twice, once with baby back pork ribs (which we preferred) and pork spare ribs (less preferred because of the fat on them). I think it is important to bake ahead, especially with spare ribs to get rid of some of the fat. I used rib rub both times prior to baking. I cut up the ribs into 2 piece sections after baking. I replaced the ketchup with bbq sauce, and the chili sauce with ketchup, and still added all the extra stuff. Both were falling off the bone at 6 hours. Thickened sauce with a teaspoon of cornstarch in a tablespoon of water, then mixed in. Delicious and will definitely make any type of ribs we have again with this recipe.

MELT-IN-YOUR-MOUTH-GOOD!!!  I made this for Independence Day, with no leftovers.
What I did diferent from the recipe:  Cut majority of the fat off, cut into thirds (so it'd fit in my slow cooker), added some of the brown sugar to the ribs with the salt & pepper before browning, used 1 cup each of Honey Hickory Smoke BBQ sauce, Honey Roasted Garlic BBQ sauce, and ketchup.  I cut the vinegar to 2&1/2 TBS, but I think I'll use 4 next time because it helps tenderize the meat.  I also added chili powder, extra Tabasco and chopped onions.  If I didn't have garlic and honey already in the BBQ sauce, I'd definitely add them to the mixture.  I rotated the ribs every 2 hours so each section had time to soak in the sauce, and served with cornbread.  I seperated the leftover sauce into small portions and froze for other meals. Thank you, thank you, thank you, Suzanne!!!

OMG! Delish. Seasoned ribs with salt pepper and garlic powder first. Precooked before slow cooking. Used 2 cups BBQ in place of ketchup. 1 cup Ketchup in place of Chili Sauce. Used 6 dashes hot sauce and a teaspoon of Sambal Oelek Chili Paste. I'd probably add more Sambal Oelek next time for an extra kick. Followed the rest of recipe exactly cooking on low 6 hrs. Cracked lid for about an hour to thicken sauce at end and skimmed off fat from the top. Took out ribs from slow cooker when done and broiled both sides for 5 min to complete. Used leftover sauce from cooker for dipping. Husband cannot stop eating and raving about these ribs!

This is a great recipe for starters.  I am no too fond of ketchup and didn't have any chili sauce, so I used 1 cup of Kraft Mesquite Smoke BBQ sauce and 1 cup of Spicy Honey (this about the equivalent to 1 18 oz. bottle).  1/2 cup of brown sugar, couple of splashes of red wine vinegar and a dash of tabasco.  I had one 2.45 lb. slab of ribs,  baked  @ 400 for 15 minutes per side per the recipe. The meat was falling off of the bones after 3 Hrs. 30 Min. on low in the crock pot.  I kept them on warm for another 3-4 hours.  Served with green beans and baked corn on the cob.  The ribs were great and we will be passing this along to friends and family as well as cooking them again and again.

Be sure to turn ribs during cooking so they don't stick to sides & burn. Can also place them in the oven on a baking sheet for last half hour so that the sauce caramelizes onto the meat!!

Oh my gosh!!!  These ribs were awesome.  Here is what I did based on several other reveiewer suggestions.  I used 1 cup of my favorite bbq sauce, 1 cup of chili sauce and 1 cup of ketchup.  I also added 1 tbsp of liquid smoke.  I used 4 lbs of country style ribs, but there was a lot of extra sauce so I served it over rice.  Cooking for 6 hours on low was more than enough.  Next time I am going to use 5 lbs of the country style ribs but I will trim the fat before I put them in the crock pot (the sauce was a bit greasy, so I think trimming the fat will help).  The meat falls apart and the sauce is soooo tasty - thanks so much for the recipe.

Tried this recipe twice.  The first time the ribs were incredibly hot!!! This was because 1 cup of the chili sauce I had is way too much!!  The second time I only put about 1/4 cup of chili sauce and it was perfect!

I did my best to make these according to the original recipe. I think this recipe has a good start, but it is essential to return the ribs to the oven with a generous coat of sauce to get a carmelized, sticky coating like at a restaurant. Otherwise, the sauce is just soupy and doesn't adhere to the ribs much. I broiled at 450 about 10 minutes per side in a baking dish so I could also cook down the sauce a bit, too. As for the very controversial sauce, I think it is a matter of personal taste. I used Sriracha hot chili sauce since that is what I had on hand, and the sauce was HOT. I mean, I liked it, but I enjoy habanero salsa, so reader beware. Maybe those who thought it was bland were using a milder chili sauce. The rib sauce was a bit toward the ketchup-y side, but not bad. Of course, I did not have a full 2c to use, it was more like 1 1/4c. Maybe the reduced ketchup amount helped the flavor. I also think the ribs don't need as much sauce as the original recipe calls for to cook properly in the crockpot, so shorting the ketchup further might be a good future change. Side note: I used country ribs since that's what I had.

Well I made this recipe with ALL the original recipe ingredients, with zero changes, and we loved it. We were able to pull the meat right off the bone and leave the bone completely empty. There wasn't an ounce left after we were done. We've enjoyed the homemade sauces that are suggested on this site, and we weren't disappointed with this one at all. I would certainly use this recipe again. What an easy and delicious way to have homemade babyback ribs!

The best ribs I have ever fixed in my 65 years, and I'm from Texas and have fixed a LOT of ribs.  Only change I made was adding 4 Tbl. Raspberry Chipolte marinade and 2 Tbl. liquid smoke to the sauce.  Only took 4 1/2 hrs. in the crockpot.

I followed the recipe and instructions exactly as shown, and I am VERY disappointed! The ribs are black on the outside, and they taste burnt! Why did this happen?

This was my first attempt at making baby back ribs (on 4th of July no less!) and I'm so glad I tried it.   I followed other's lead by substituting store bought BBQ sauce for the ketchup.  Used 1 C of sweet chili sauce (from asian grocery)  and a couple squirts of siracha hot sauce.  No brown sugar was needed.   Used 2 TB of red wine vinegar.   Added 3 cloves of fresh chopped garlic and onion powder to sauce.   The rest was followed per the recipe.   Love the oven browing to remove excess fat.   This prevented the sauce from being too greasy.   Cooked in slow cooker on low for 5 hours and then finished on charcoal grill for about 20 minutes.  Results were spectacular, will be making these again!

I agree with another comment that the sauce tastes too much like ketchup. I also found that too much of the flavour of the meat was lost in the slow cooking. I admit that I'm a purist when it comes to ribs and nothing comes close to ribs that were dry rubbed, smoked slowly and then sauced at the last stage of cooking.

BEST RIBS I'VE EVER HAD! I love traditional barbecued ribs, but these had the perfect blend of BBQ flavor and sweetness. I used 3/4 cup brown sugar instead of 1/2 cup because it smelled rather strong when I was mixing the ingredients. I used half dark-brown sugar and half light-brown sugar. Perfect blend for that extra little bit of sweetness. I also cut them before putting them in the pot; they fit better that way, plus the sauce gets a better coat. I cooked about 7 hours.

This recipe is great! My husband raves to everyone about them. Don't add bbq sauce to this there is no need to this is what bbq sauce is!! The only thing I do is chop up a whole medium sized onion and some garlic and add that and it tastes so yummy! I leave them in there for about 7 hours and they are just fall off the bone delicious.

AMAZING!!I added 2 cups of Cattleboys BBQ sauce & only 3/4c ketchup and left out the chili sauce. I boiled pork sideribs for 1 hour the night before, placed them in the slow cooker along with the rest of the ingredients and placed in fridge. The next day I cooked them in the slow cooker all day!! 8 hours, the meat fell off the bone, SIMPLY DELICIOUS & EASY!!

Fall off the bone juicy!! I made my own bbq sauce (ketchup, brown sugar,  liquid smokes "hickory smoke", seosoning salt, garlic salt, sea salt, course pepper, worcestershire sauce, cholula hot sauce, c as yenne pepper, and my favorite ingredient white wine -season to your taste ) ALWAYS  TASTE TEST! Just don't taste it after you put it on tge beef or pork ribs lol. And if you like the taste of your bbq sauce b4 its cooked, you will love the taste after its cooked! Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous! I cooked 1 lb pork back ribs pre wrapped in the meat section. so juicy and falling apart my 9 month old could  eat them!

Really good..my family loves them..we used the baby back ribs..the only difference I made was in using bbq sauce in place of the chili sauce..and using splenda brown sugar because I'm diabetic . Cooked them longer and they got the crispy almost charred appearance of being barbequed.

Pretty good, but still too sweet after cutting sugar back by half. I'll probably go to less ketchup and more chili sauce next time also.

Giving it 5 stars just for the slow cooker method idea..... I know, but at least I'm not saying its great after changing everything but the animal the meat came from! This is what I do, rub ribs (whole slab babies) w/ Paul Prudhomme's "Meat Magic" mixed w/ some brown sugar. In the crock Pot it goes for 8 hrs. on low, take em out, fridge till next day, cut in portions or leave whole and throw on grill brushing w/ your fave sauce till sticky, caramelized, chared and heated thru... whew I want them NOW! I have "cheated" and done this a day or 2 ahead... pre saucing/grilling, called friends over for ribs, and all I had to do was apps. sides, and heat on grill and of course the  adult beverages!!!! Everyone thinks you made ribs same day! Gosh I LOVE PAUL PRUDHOMME!!!! and all his spice mixes, try them all! Salmon seasoning is KILLER!!!! Use it for salmon cakes! : )

Man, did my husband rave about these ribs!  I had to adjust my rating because I did not use this recipe for the sauce--  I used 2 cups of a bottled sauce as a time saving measure.  What I really appreciated was the cooking method(s)-- after the 30 min. in the oven, sliced the ribs into individual pieces and let marinate in the BBQ sauce overnight-- then added a 12 oz can of beer to prevent sticking and burning.  Pre-cooking in the oven and then the slow simmer had these ribs fall off the bone tender-- literally!  AND-- that membrane/skin that you find on one side of the ribs (which can get kind of tough)?  Right after they're done in the oven is a GREAT time to remove that-- just lift it up w/ the point of a sharp knife and peel it right off.  Having that off helps w/ tenderness of the meat, as it can absorb more sauce while it cooks!

This was THE WORST recipe that I've ever made!  I seriously do not understand the 5 star comments.  I did exactly what the recipe called for and all I got was burnt, rock hard meat!!  It stuck to the sides of the crock pot like cement!  I cooked it on low for 7 hours as directed.  I'm not sure where I went wrong but if I could rate this a ZERO, I would!!

OH MY!!! I would give this more stars if possible, I made if for a dinner party, everyone loved it, had to use a latel to get the meat out because it was falling off the bone. I did follow other reviews and instead of using 2 cups of ketchup i used 1 cup BBQ sauce and 1 cup of ketchup. will make again and again

I thought this recipe was very good.  I liked the idea of cooking for 15min/e side at the start to drain off some of the grease.  I cooked as directed in slow cooker (8 hours on slow) and the result was fall off the bone ribs - PERFECT! 
Because my family isn't big on ketchup, I did make a slight alternation (in place of ketchup, I used 2C of Sweet Baby Ray BBQ sauce).  I also cut the amount of vinegar in half (personal preference).  
My family enjoyed them and I will be using this again in the future!

The cooking METHOD is 5-star, but the sauce is not going to suit most tastes. The oven step helps get rid of goop that would sit in the slow cooker.  But skip the sauce as soooo many other people have described and just put the pre-browned ribs in your slow cooker with a bottle of your favorite BBQ sauce.  Easy-peasy.

I loved making this recipe, my roomates could not believe the taste of the ribs.  For my first time making this the ribs came out falling off the bone and I think better than using a BBQ base.  Easy to make and easy to clean up.  Also, I preped the recipe the night before which was a good idea.  I mixed all the ingrediants and saved in one bowl and covered with cling wrap and then browned the ribs for 15 min on each side just like the video. Then I refridgerated that too.  In the morning all I had to do was add the mix and ribs and there you go.

So great! 

I will trim off more fat though for next time. Even with the pre-cooking, there was quite a layer of fat in the slow cooker. I also baked at the end to caramelize the sauce.

The oven step is unnecessary if you are using babybacks, which is always my preferred variety. (less waste so they actually end up as cheap or cheaper than spare ribs)
The sauce......to each his own but as other reviews have said...tastes too much like just catsup..Stick with your own recipe or use a premium store bought sauce. (IMHO).....

These were great!  Browned them in the oven, put them in the slow cooker with a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's barbeque sauce and went to the beach.  When I got back dinner was ready, had a salad already made and roasted potatoes.  5 stars for ease and taste, try it!

Very Tender! I cooked the ribs as directed but just used our favorite BBQ Sauce (Sweet Baby Rays). I did add about a 1/2 cup of water to the slow cooker.

Very tender, moist ribs! My whole family loved them! I agree with another reviewer that putting them back in the oven for about 20 min before serving to caramelize the sauce is a definite must. Instead of the ketchup & the chili sauce, I used several different flavors of BBQ sauces and then added that to the last 4 ingredients. Wonderful flavors. Will definitely make this again!

Favorite!

I made some changes.

#1 - added 2 tsp. of minced garlic

#2 - added 1/2 of onion, diced

#3 - eliminated chili sauce

#4 - used 1 1/2 c. ketchup and 1 1/2 c. Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce (THE best)

#5 - we usually use bone-in country ribs, simply due to the cost

These get rave reviews.  People request them weekly!

I did 1 cup BBQ sauce instead of the chili sauce. I also added two tbs minced garlic. I didn't bake the ribs but boiled them for 20 minutes then put in crock pot.  They were yummy! Would go great with mashed potatoes as there was a bunch of gravy left in the crock after I took the ribs out.

I did not like this recipe at all.  I aged 30 years just at the taste of the vinegar in it.  Very strong.  If you must make this recipe use a bit less vinegar.  I won't attempt this again though.  The other flavors weren't anything special.

Great slow cooker recipe. I followed a lot of the advice from commenters here by skipping the browning part and placing the meat straight into the crockpot (I also tried this a second time and browned the meat, but I didn't see enough difference to make the browning process worthwhile) and then finishing them in the oven. Used boneless country style ribs and will continue to do so. Good for freezer meals.

If you cook the ribs too long in the oven, they will dry out and not absorb the barbaque sauce.  I didn't like the homemade sauce, next time I would look for a different bbq recipe or buy.

Very easy and very yummy.  The ribs were so tender and tasty.  I'll definitely be making this again.  (I also added garlic powder and onion powder to the sauce.)

Rating this 5 stars on technique alone.  Searing on both sides makes these ribs crispy on the outsides, tender and juicy on the inside, slow cooker or not. Certainly the best ribs I've ever cooked. . .Use whatever barbeque sauce you like - it's a personal thing. . . or a regional thing or whatever.  It is the technique that is the keeper.

I don't know why, but the slow cooker method did NOT work for me here. I set it in the morning before work for 6 hours on low, and my slow cooker automatically goes to "warm" until the food is ready to serve. This has worked for many other dishes, but when I got home after 9 hours, the sauce was burnt and the ribs were tough. Worst part was, I had guests over so I had to sprint to the grocery store to start over! I ended up boiling the second set of ribs for an hour in salted water and then baking them at 350 in the sauce first covered in foil for half an hour and then uncovered for another half an hour. The second round were fall-off-the-bone delicious. Also on the sauce- I followed others' suggestions and used 2 cups of BBQ sauce, 1 cup of sweet chili sauce, a generous "squirt" of Sriracha, vinegar, salt, pepper, and oregano. The sauce came out absolutely amazing. Hope this helps anyone who has a long work schedule.

Absolutely the best.  I am not much of a rib eater but this was awesome and I cannot wait until I make it again.  Every member of my party said I have to make these again.  I used Sweet Baby Rays instead of the chili sauce and ketchup and used a 2 Tbl spoons of the vinegar and no hot sauce.  Yum yum.

These ribs were delicious and fell off the bone.  The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is due to the sauce.  It was good but I prefer a more traditional bbq sauce.  This one is more "tomato-y".

The best and easiest rib recipe ever.  I have done this twice, but I used my favorite bottled barbeque sauce.  The ribs are moist and fall off the bone.  Couldn't be easier or tastier.

I love this recipe, but I don't put the ribs into the oven before putting them in the slow cooker.  I just throw everything into the slow cooker & then just skim the fat before we eat them when they're done.

I MADE THIS RECIPE AS ORIGINAL: The sauce was not that great, it tasted like ketchup. Like a lot of ketchup. If I have to follow all the suggestions, it's not the same recipe, that's why I did it exactly as stated.

I actually had these Ribs on 8/25/08 for dinner. I just forgot to submit the review.  They were excellent.  I did follow the substitute suggestions from previous reviews.   I used 1 bottle of Jack Daniels Hickory Smoke Brown Sugar BBQ sauce 1/4 cup of Hot Chili Sauce 1/4 cup ketchup I also put dry rosemary in as well as well as the remaining ingredients listed.     I seasoned 1 side of the ribs with McCormick dry BBQ seasoning and placed in the oven for 15 minutes.  Turned them over, seasoned the other side, and placed back in for another 15 minutes.  This was great since it helped to eliminate some of the oil that would normally end up in the main dish.   Total cooking time in the slow cooker was 5 hours (on low) which was what I wanted because I wanted to still be able to pick the whole rib up, instead of it falling off the bone.  I probably could have cooked it for 5 1/2 hours and still would have received the same result.  Give it a try.  I am sure you will like it.

Positively the BEST!  I can understand reviewers who may use jar BBQ sauce to make this simpler (I guess), or who sub 1 cup BBQ for a cup of ketchup, but I don't understand how anyone can fault this recipe.  The only changes I made was to add liquid smoke, and red pepper.   So, so, so very good!

These are wonderful. I've made these as is and I've made them with changes and I've never been disappointed. If I'm in crunch for time, I'll just put them in the crock pot with my favorite BBQ sauce: sometimes bottled, sometimes homemade. Whatever is on hand. When they're done i put them in the broiler for a few minutes to give them a grilled taste. Excellent.

Simply delicious!  I love the ease of browning the ribs in the oven prior to putting them in the crock-pot. I sprayed them with a little olive oil spray to help them brown. I also seasoned with regular salt and celery salt plus pepper to give them a little zing. I followed the advice of other reviewers and used a combo of ketchup and barbeque sauce and skipped the chili sauce. I omitted the oregano and added about a tablespoon of minced garlic. I also poured the sauce over the ribs and browned them in a 400 degree oven for about 20 minutes prior to serving. They crisped up and caramelized beautifully! I will definitely make these again!

Hands Down the best ribs ever. First off Rubbed these bad boys down with Paula Deans house seasoning. and McCormics Pork Rub. Substitued 2c Cattlemans SmokeHouse BBQ sauce for Ketchup  and 1c Ketchup for the chili sauce. No need to add any vinegar. and hit it with a nice helping of lousiana hot sauce.  Kids and Wife loved it all were coverd in the Saucey Goodness Provided by these Ribs. Cooked on Low for 7hrs and Finished in the oven at 400 for another 30min.  Will be makeing these again soon.

This method works great for ribs. I make a rub from garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika and freshly ground black pepper and refrigerate overnight. I increase the oven heat to 450, 15 mins per side then put into the crock pot for 6-7 hours on low with a bottle of BBQ sauce poured over the top. I then pull the ribs out of the slow cooker and put em back in the over at 450 for another 10 mins or so.  Very good!

Saw this recipe in the magazine and knew I had to try it.  My hubs loves ribs and had mentioned that he was craving them.  Truly, this was the easiest recipe to make and you won't believe what happened.  When my husband came home from work early (3:30 p.m.), he entered the house and immediately went to the crock pot, pulled off the lid and tasted the ribs.  He asked me when they would be ready and I told him they were ready now.  He said, "Let's eat dinner RIGHT NOW."  He devoured half of these ribs himself and told me NOT TO TWEAK THE RECIPE.  This is now in a monthly rotation -- they were fabulous and I wouldn't hesitate to serve these to company.  Made the recipe exactly as called for but it only took about six hours in my slow cooker.

This recipe is the best.  I never, ever made ribs for fear of them being to dry, to tough, etc...  The slow cooker is the secret weapon!  I followed the recipe exactly and they were fantastic!  Ribs are my new menu item. I can't wait for another sale on them at the store. Thanks Suzanne

These ribs are amazing with a few changes!!! I rated it 4 stars for the base recipe.but with the changes it's 10 stars!!! I used 2 cups BBQ sauce, 3/4 cups ketchup, and 1/4 cup siracha sauce instead of the ketchup and chili. Then I added 1/4 cup packed brown sugar, about 2-3 tablespoons of molasses, used a mix of white and red wine vinegar, 1 teas oregano, 2 teas Worcestershire sauce, 10 dashes chalula hot sauce, AND added 1 teas chile powder,2 teas garlic powder, 1 teas onion powder, , dash ground red pepper, 2 tablespoons honey. It made a delicious sweet and spicy BBQ sauce!!! I let it cook on low for 6 hours (could have gone a little less even, it was falling off the bone, but was still able to be taken out of the crockpot) and then switched it to warm for another hour until my hubby got home. When we were ready to eat, I preheated the oven to 350 degrees , put the ribs on a foil lined baking sheet, skimmed the fat off the top of the BBQ sauce , slathered on a generous portion on the ribs and baked for 20 minutes. The sauce stuck to the ribs and tasted soooooo delicious with a good amount of heat and sweetness. They were the best ribs I've ever had that weren't smoked. And definitely restaurant quality!! With those changes and additions the ribs were out of this world tender, falling off the bone and amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!

Reviewers should take a collective bow on this recipe. Bottom line: absolutely great ribs! Can't wait to make this recipe again. But, as with the great majority, I changed the recipe -- having read a number of these reviews. I substituted my own favorite BBQ sauce (KC Masterpiece) for 2 cups of ketchup. I then substituted ketchup for 1 cup "Chili Sauce" (after a review of what is "Chili Sauce" where "Heinze Chili Sauce" seems to be the answer). I added a tablespoon of Stubb's liquid hickory smoke and that's it. Browning in the oven for 15 minutes on each side before the crockpot is brilliant. Better than the "simmer" dressing that some mentioned. I saw no need to brown again after slow cooking. "Low" heat is best (as prescribed) -- took only 5 hours. I chose "Baby Back" ribs among several choices, taking the butcher's suggestion. Really, really good result!

Excellent!  The only change was that I substituted BBQ sauce for the chili sauce because we didn't have any in the house and it still tasted fantastic.  My husband and children devoured them.  The taste even better the next day as leftovers.

Thank you.  Using the recipe for a base and the reviews, I've had a delicious experience.  When I mentioned the 15 minute a side browning a "cook" friend assured me I should lower the time to 5 - 10 minutes a side.  We were speaking of baby back ribs but when time came to make the purchase I bought country style pork ribs.  So large and meaty I browned for the 15 minutes and they looked great.  The amount of ketchup in the recipe made me think "bland" so I substituted two cups of Sunny's sweet BBQ sauce.  I added 1 cup ketchup in place of the chili sauce.  Also used red wine vinegar as suggested by another review.  I rotated the ribs 1/2 way through and put the slow cooker on high for the last 1/2 hour with the cover ajar to thicken the sauce.  The ribs were delicious.  I think I'll try the 1 cup of chili sauce instead of using ketchup to test the taste the next time but I was VERY happy having used the 1 cup of ketchup.

I made this dish for our family dinner and it worked out very well. I did use all the other ingredients for the sauce except I too used 1c Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce and used only 1c ketchup and 1c chilli sauce. My husband loved it; the meat was tender and moist. I was very happy with this dish! This is now a family favorite!

Outstanding... first real "fall of the bone" ribs recipe that worked for me.  Next time I will brown in the oven a little longer and drain off more fat and cook in the crock pot shorter (5 hours on low).  I just subbed one cup of katchup for bbq sauce and used coctail sauce instead of chili sauce.

I tried this recipe and I was pleased with the results.  I now make my ribs this way.  The only thing I did differently, was to make a rub and then add the sauce.  The ribs were delicious.

These are about the best ribs I have ever had. I made them for my family one night when I wasn't going to be home and they ate the entire thing and left me none! Takes ten minutes to prepare and you have an awesome meal when you get home. I didn't change a thing. Maybe next time add more hot sauce for a bigger kick, but you can't beat this!

Great method! I used BBQ instead of ketchup and chili sauce, although I did add the other ingredients. Meat was falling off the bone and tender! Next time I might cut them up first, because it all just comes off when you try to cut them. Then I'll cook them on high for 4 hours instead of low for 8. Although it was delicious, I kinda wanted to eat the meat on the ribs.

This may be wonderful, but do not call it barbeque.  Barbeque is slow cooked over wood or charcoal, not in a pot.

Made these ribs as per the recipe and they were delicious and definitely fall off the bone! Had everything on hand except only had thai sweet chili sauce, so used that instead.  Did not "stand ribs on end" or have to broil in the oven like some of the reviewers had stated.  Because of a time crunch and needing to prepare ahead of cook day,I cooked the ribs in the oven, prepared the sauce and put the ribs and sauce in 2 large ziploc bags. Placed in the fridge until 2 days later and put in the slow cooker in the morning. Absolutely delish!  Will use this recipe again and again.

The ribs were delicious, but I gave it a 4 because as this recipe is the ribs would lack that outer crisp you get from the grill.  My boyfriend is very picky and not a big rib eater, but he LOVED these.

My modifications: I Trimmed some of the fat (to get more crisp from the meat, there is still plenty of fat inside the meat.  I slathered with olive oil and garlic (a little weird, but we put this on almost everything we cook) and then seasoned with my own salt-free rub.  There is enough salt in the BBQ sauce, it didn't need more in the spices.  
I used Stubbs spicy bbq sauce and mixed 1 part bbq sauce to 2 parts water... to fill the slow cooker to 2/3rds full.  I lined the bottom with onions and garlic before placing the meat and sauce in.  
The only modification I made in the cooking procedure was in the end.  I pulled the ribs and basted with the remaining bbq sauce (from the bottle) and broiled in the oven till crisp.  
Optional: I took the liquid from the crock, kept the onions and garlic in it and reduced it to reuse for leftovers or in baked beans.  Tip- let it set in the fridge overnight to skim the fat.

The sauce was good, but even though I followed the recipe completely, the meat fell off the bone completely in the slow cooker, causing it to be one giant, sloppy stew of rib meat. You had to pick through the whole stew to try and find good pieces.

Oh my goodness.. this was incredible!! The meat is more tender than any rib joint that my husband and I have ever been to, and it was effortless to remove it from the bone! So easy too! I followed everything except exchange ketchup for Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy sauce! Mmmm!

I made these for a pub-style Superbowl night & the guys gobbled them up like they were going out of style.  I used 1 C of ketchup, 1 C of Diana Sauce (chicken & rib flavour), 2 Tbsp of Worchestershire, 4 Tbsp of white vinegar, 2 Tbsp of brown sugar, salt & pepper & a pinch of oregano..YUMM   : )

Falling off the bone good!  I made some modifications to this recipe  and think these ribs turned out better than any restaurants.  First I mixed 3 tbsp brown sugar, 3 tbsp garlic powder. 2 tbsp salt, and 2 tbsp pepper. I then coated the ribs with the rub that I made.  I baked the ribs at 400 for 15 minutes on each side.  While the ribs baked I mixed 2 cups of barbecue sauce, 3/4 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup Tiger Sauce, 1 tbsp tabasco, 1 tsp Worcestershire, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 2 tbsp minced garlic, 1 tbsp oregano, and 3 tbsp of vinegar.  When the ribs were done cooking in the oven I placed them in the slow cooker, then poured the sauce over the ribs.  After cooking for 3 hours the ribs were already falling off the bone.  I let them cook on low for 6 hours and they turned out AMAZING!  Love this recipe.

The best method for ribs is to par- boil for 20 or so minutes. Then place them in a crock pot, pour favorite sauce over them(the bourbon whiskey one in AR.com is the BEST!) and let cook on low for 4 hours. Then take ribs and cook  on low flame on the grill. Keep brushing with sauce to get that thick caramelized look. The video on this web site is just that and is the best way to enjoy your ribs.

I normally don't like ribs in the slow cooker-but placing the ribs in the oven made all the differnce. I used salsa instead of chili sauce because that's what I had. My family usually raves about my BBQ ribs but they want me to do ribs like this all the time!

These are a hit everytime we serve them. We replace the ketchup with BBQ Sauce and use Chipotle Hot Sauce. Always fall-off-the-bone tender with excellent flavor. Will continue to use this method when smoking/grilling is not convenient/available. Thanks for sharing!!

I tried it first as recipe stated. I did not care for the BBQ sauce. So.. The second time I used store bought BBQ sauce. Instead on baking the ribs before putting into the crock pot, I put the ribs on the grill after they were done in the crock pot. Evryone loved them! the platter was licked clean!

I am giving this recipe five stars for the cooking technique only since I used bottle barbecue sauce.  I used three pounds of ribs and browned according to the instructions, then put in the slow cooker with two bottles of Sweet Baby Rays for about 8 hours.  Finished them in the oven for 20 minutes at 375 with a little of the reserved bbq sauce.  Super easy and delicious.  Thanks for this recipe!

I made a few changes instead of catsup and Chili sauce I used KC Masterpiece BBQ Sauce.  I used the grill to sear the ribs and then placed them in the ctrock pot.  It is so nice to come home to fresh BBQ ribs that tasted like they just came off the grill.  Be careful when you remove from the crock pot because the meat will fall off the bones.  Super recipe!

This is quite possibly one of the best recipes ever! If it weren't for the calories/fat count I'd be making this ALL THE TIME. It was so easy, so delicious, and was way better than recipes even on the grill. I don't think I'll ever even bother with trying to make ribs the traditional way ever again!

This recipe makes very tasty tender ribs.  I used country style ribs and they turned out great!  I added 1 tsp of liquid smoke to the sauce for a smoky flavor. Will definitely use again!!

These ribs are awesome! The secret is roasting in the oven - it gets them brown and removes the fat.  My easy version:  I just salt and pepper them for the oven part, then put them in the crock pot and poured a little of my favorite bottled bbq sauce.  Add more sauce as needed (or if you like a lot of sauce). Perfection!

I did not like this recipe. Too ketchupy? (I know, this is not a real word). The ribs lacked any real verve. There is a recipe on allrecipes that is unbelievable, and I rate all rib recipes against that bar. This was not close.

Yes!  This is how to make good ribs! They fell right off the bones! I just used a bottle of my own favorite bbq sauce.  After you take them out of the slow cooker you must put them on a cookies sheet, pour some more bbq sauce on them, and bake them for 15 mins at about 400.  This will make the sauce stick and carmalize a little.  SO GOOD!

Holy Cow are these delicious.  I used red wine for my vinegar and instead of chili sauce(didn't have) I used my favorite BBQ sauce.  I cooked mine for 8 hours and I  carefully finished them off on the grill for a few minutes to give them some nice grill marks.  YUMMY!!  Finally I found a recipe that gives me ribs that fall off the bone with goodness.

This recipe is great as is.  However, my kids are creatures of habit and like the taste of regular barbecue sauce.  So, when making these we use Masterpiece original and the kids eat them up!  This recipe makes rib cooking easy for me as I don't cook them well on the grill and they taste just as good!

I simplified this a bit, used only 1 cup ketchup, 2 cups barbecue sauce, 2 tablespoons vinegar, half a cup brown sugar and a cut up onion in the crockpot.  I did cook the ribs in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes first then I cut the ribs into chunks and put them and the covering sauce into the pot.  Cooked on high for 3 hours then on low for another hour.  Making sure the ribs wer covered.  The ribs were tender and literally falling off the bones.  My husband is already negotiating for the leftovers for lunch and it's barely breakfast time.  The leftover sauce will be used later, maybe for pork chops.  This is a terrific recipe and I plan to use it again as it was so good and easy.

These were delicous ribs!  I made a few small changes but will always make them with this sauce, it was the best.  I followed the other suggestions by substituting the chili sauce for 1 cup Honey Mustard BBQ and cutting the ketchup down to 1 cup, and I used apple cider vinegar and 1 tsp oregano instead of 2(Don't really care for oregano).  I added a bit of chili powder as well.  ONce the ribs were done, I thickened the sauce a bit by adding cornstarch, brushed them with the sauce and broiled them for about 5 minutes.
YUM!

This recipe is so easy to make and you won't believe how good the ribs taste! If you like ribs & have a crock pot, you've got to try these! The only change I made (per other reviews) was to switch one cup of the ketchup with barbecue sauce. My whole family loved them and I've made them several times now. You just won't believe how fall-off-the-bone-tender they turn out!

I've made this several times, and yes, I'm guilty of changing the recipe a little bit. The best outcome I've had was to season simply with garlic powder, onion powder, salt & pepper then into the slow cooker and covering ribs with BBQ sauce. On low for 8 hrs., turning the ribs over once or twice. Comes out very tender! Then I do finish it off in the broiler with more BBQ sauce for 15 minutes to crisp it up a bit and carmelize the sauce. So simple and the smell of it cooking is mouth watering!

Skipped the oven browning. Did 'em in the slow cooker on high for 4.5 hours and they were fall-off-the-bone tender! LOVE the sauce!!

What I love about allrecipes is that you can always count on thousands of people who have tried the recipe, made little tweaks, and written about those tweaks in their reviews.  I feel it helps make a very good recipe even better.  Usually I always follow a recipe first as written, then the next time I make changes.  However, upon seeing the many reviewers who indicated it was too much ketchup taste, I decided to go with the reviewers who substituted their favorite BBQ sauce for the ketchup. I subbed 2 cups of Stubb's original bbq sauce for the ketchup, and kept everything else the same.  Cooked in the oven for 30 minutes as indicated (I did cover them with foil to help expedite the release of the fat).  Then transferred to the crockpot and poured sauce mixture on top.  In my crockpot it did cook for 5 hours on low and they were tender at that point, but not falling apart from the bone.  To serve I poured all the sauce back into a medium saucepan, and let it reduce to help thicken it for about 20 minutes.  I served the sauce in a gravy boat for those who like their ribs extra saucy.  The combination of bbq sauce, chili sauce, and the remaining sauce ingredients was spot on: not overly sweet, not overly vinegary, just right for us.  This will be my "go to" recipe when making BBQ ribs in a crockpot.  Thank you to all the recipe testers and the original recipe poster.

These were the most AMAZING FALL OFF THE BONE ribs we ever had.  Instead of Chili Sauce I used one cup Ketchup and two cups Bulls Eye BBQ Sauce.  Followed the rest of the recipe as is and omitted the hot sauce.  Slow cooked for 6 1/2 hours and finished them on the grill.  We had a lot left over for just the two of us and I heated the leftovers in the oven on 300 until heated through with the leftover sauce and they were just as good if not better the second time.  I am so glad I came across this recipe.  I am ready to make them again even though I had them last night.

These were the worst ribs I have ever had in my entire 36 years. The meat was very tender but the sauce was absolutely horrible. I will never try this recipe again. I will stick with regular barbecue sauce in the future.

Fantastic!  I used sriracha hot sauce and garlic chili sauce when making the BBQ sauce for this recipe.  At the very end I baked the ribs at 375 degrees for 20 minutes so the sauce would thicken and stick to the ribs.

My guy said it was delish! Followed suit like others with half BBQ/half ketchup. Also put a full tsp of tobasco in to really give them a kick! I did 6.5 hrs on low in the crockpot and they were perfect tenderness

These were some of the best ribs I've ever had!  I only had 1 cup of ketchup so I used about 1 1/2 cups of chili sauce and I added chopped onion and 2 chopped garlic cloves to the sauce.  I cooked in the oven and then exactly 6 hrs in the slow cooker. These were fall off the bone tender and the sauce was tangy goodness.

When I made these ribs I patted myself on the back! These came out so tender they were falling off the bone.  I bought a 2 - 3lb slab of baby back ribs.  I had cut each slap in 3rds to get the to fit into the crockpot. Baked as directed at 450. I followed the recipe almost exact... I didn't have chili sauce so instead I used Sweet Baby Rays original bbq sauce. FANTASTIC!  The family loved! I will definitely make again!

Thanks for submitting this recipe!

This recipe is awesome!! I cooked this for my husband, mom, brother, and his girlfriend. They couldn't stop saying how great it was. My husband was mad that I didn't have any left overs lol. The only thing I changed was not adding any hot sauce and chili sauce, I added a half of an onion (sliced) into the crock pot, substituting the 2 cups of ketchup to Jack Daniels BBQ sauce and the 1 cup of chili sauce to the ketchup. Instead of salt and pepper, I put pepper, 1 packet of sazon seasoning, and garlic and onion powder to the ribs. This was absolutely delicious!

This was fantastic. I've never made ribs before so I cheated and used KC Masterpiece bbq sauce cuz it was all I had, but followed the rest of instructions and my ribs were perfect! My 12 year old daughter who's a picky eater mowed them down including leftovers the next night! Thank you Suzanne.

My review is for the cooking method only, which is wonderful. We used my own homemade BBQ sauce, just one rack of ribs, and couldn't be happier with the result. The ribs were done after just 4 hours in the slow cooker, but we did just cook the one rack, so that could explain the difference. This method is simple, easy and makes great ribs, with your sauce of choice.

Awesome!! I first boiled the ribs to take off as much fat as I could then I rubbed Hawaiian salt on all sides of the meat as well as pepper.  I cut down the sugar so it wouldn't be too sweet. My family loved it!! Will definitely be making it again!

Great recipe! I make a recipe and a half of the barbecue sauce, leave out the oregano based on personal preference and add a few dashes of liquid smoke. These are a Sunday favorite in my house.

We LOVE this recipe - with the following modifications.  We don't brown the ribs, rather we coat them with the sauce (substituting one cup ketchup for a cup of BBQ sauce and adding in a 12 oz beer) and marinate overnight.  Drop them in the slow cooker in the morning and they are tender and perfect for late afternoon.  In fact, our BBQ's the last two years seem to be grilled veggies with slow cooker ribs.  No complaints there.

This recipe isn't specific to whether or not they were country style ribs (boneless) or a whole  rack. i used a rack, and I felt like it took forever for the meat to be "fall off the bone" and by the time it got that way, the meat had reduced too much. I don't think this is fault of the recipe so much as I wanted it to taste like restaurant quality. I am not sure you can get rich meaty ribs that fall off the bone without slow smoking them. But anyways, it was good, the sauce was yummy, the meat I had was tender. I just think next time I won't cook them quite as long. Also for any novice rib cookers out there, the white skin on the back of a rack of ribs is very thick and rubbery; inedible even after cooking for hours. Remove it if at all possible, or use country style ribs. =) I also browned the ribs after slow cooking them to give them a bit of bark.

Super simple & virtually fool proof. Follow rib cooking instrux & doctored up my own sauce. This will be a staple. Added large diced sweet potatoes to the bottom of the crock and served mashed as a side! Fabulous!

The ribs were tasty and easy enough to prepare but the sauce didn't adhere to the meat and was very watery. Can't imagine that even turning on high and removing lid of slow cooker would have made any difference.  I would make again but use prepared sauce and probably put in oven  with a coating of additional sauce to carmelize before serving.

I have made these ribs many times and I always finish them off on the charcoal grill for a few minutes to get a nice "char" and make the sauce a bit sticky.  I honestly feel there is little difference in the taste using the slow cooker and cooking the ribs half the day over charcoal like I used to do. Better texture too.  The ribs are so tender, one may need to experiment with reducing the cooking time, depending on the temp. of the individual crock pot so that the ribs come out in one piece ( my slow cooker runs awfully hot).

I've used this technique twice, always roasting the ribs first to render off a little of the fat. This last time, I mixed up whatever bbq sauce I had on hand, added a little bit of bourbon to it, and let the ribs slow-cook. I feel confident cooking other ribs this way and will transfer them to the oven for one last "glazing bake" before serving.

I agree with all the other reviewers who said roasting the meat in the oven first is the real secret/genius of this recipe.  Try this recipe and cover the ribs with Bone Sucking Sauce (yes, that's the real name).  It is FANTASTIC!

I cannot even BELIEVE how delicious these ribs turned out to be, for such a simple recipe! The only things I changed were to add about 1/2 cup of leftover red wine and reduce the sugar a bit. I also turned the ribs over at the 4-hour mark. I served the ribs with basmati rice and bread, both of which were good to soak up the generous sauce that is left once the ribs had been removed. This recipe will become a weekly favourite in my house. THANK YOU Suzanne2802!!!

Excellent!  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding onion slices to the sause.  My son said these are the best ribs he has ever had.  Thank you - I've been looking for a good recipe for ribs in the slow cooker for quite some time.  Also- my slow cooker runs a bit hot and I cooked them a bit too long - meat literally fell off the bone - but very very good!

OH MY, This is very very good, I used 12 oz Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory and Brown sugar Barbecue sauce.
6 oz chili sauce and 8 splashes of Franks Red Hot Sauce. I skipped the ketchup, vinegar, oregano, and worcestershire sauce. After browning I cooked on low for 4 hours then flipped the ribs over and cooked another 4. I was going to put them on the grill at the end of 8 hours just to glaze them but when I opened the crock pot I was surprised to see how perfect they turned out. They couldn't of been any better.

Ribs were so tender & delicious.  I made this twice - the first time as stated in this recipe, but I didn't like the sauce too much, so I made it the 2nd time w/ Big Al's KC sauce from this site.  Love the cooking method though, and I'll def make again!

I have made these a few times. Awesome! Doubt I would ever make ribs any other way again. I did soak them all night in pineapple juice first. (receipe from old friend) then just followed this recipe.

I changed this recipe entirely. I used country style beef ribs and then added 1 can chunky Garden Combination Ragu spaghetti sauce, 1 bottle favorite barbeque sauce, 1/4 cup teriyaki sauce, 1-2 tsp Worchestshire sauce, a dash of liquid smoke. Then I cooked it on low for 8-10 hours. They come out wonderfully!

FANTASTIC!  My family said they were the best ribs and forget ever grilling them again!  I added garlic, jalapeno powder, Melinda's hot sauce and black pepper - we like 'em HOT!  My guys always order ribs when we go out and said they liked this recipe/method even better than the restaurant!  I am not a fan of meat and I even had a whole rib myself!

I was actually not overly impressed with this recipe.  The sauce was, as others have noted, ketchup sauce.  Also, I wouldn't have liked the ribs straight out of the slow cooker; setting them back in the oven at the end to caramelize was key to finishing them, imo.  The method is a decent base for the ribs, but overall this needs adjusting.

I also agree that the fat did not come off in the oven as much as it did in the crockpot.  After cooking in the crock for 8 hrs, change of plans made us not eat this for dinner.  I wound up refrigerating them reheating them the next day.  I was able to skim a lot of fat off while they were cold. I did change the ketchup to 1 cup and substituted 1 cup BBQ sauce. However, I felt that this recipe was way too saucy and wasn't able to enjoy the the actual taste of the ribs.  I would actually give this 3 stars, but since my DH loved it, I gave it 4, but will probably not make this again.

Taking others advice, instead of 2 cups of ketchup, I used 1 cup of ketchup and 1 cup of bbq sauce. I thought these were incredible. Also a plus, not turning on the oven or stove when it's 87 degrees!! AND such an easy cleanup. I recommend this recipe - with my changes - to everyone.

This is our new favorite rib recipe.  I used 1 c. of bbq sauce in place of 1 c. of the ketchup.  When done, put ribs on cookie sheet, brushed on a little more sauce, and put in 450 degree oven for about 15 minutes to carmelize the sauce.  This was mostly for looks... they would be delicious anyway.

Awesome ribs!!!!!  I followed the idea of peachesncream2 and used her sauce recipe. Stubbs is the only bottled barbecue sauce I will buy.  I had a two pound rack (just for the two of us) and my ribs were fall-apart tender in 4 hours.  The taste was sensational.  Pretty much the best ribs I have ever had.

As stated by others, how it is cooked makes it a 5 star.  I heeded the advice of others and did not use BBQ sauce recipe, instead for BBQ sauce, I used store bought "Sweet Baby Rays" Original.  I used the whole 28oz bottle.  The meat just falls off the bone. Soooo yummy! 8 Hour slow cooked was perfect.

Ribs in the slow cooker .... woot woot ... the best ever. No matter the variants used in the sauce and there are soooo many different combinations that can be used in this one. This is by far a five star recipe...! Thanks ever so much for sharing. 2 thumbs up.

Delicious. Followed directions for most part, but used sweet baby ray's instead  of ketchup, and ketchup instead of chili  sauce, 2 tblsp. fresh oregano instead of dried, and some garlic salt. Unbelievable. Husband didn't even talk during dinner (which is a shock), he just wanted to eat.

This is a fabulous recipe! I'm sorry to those of you who get upset when others' change the sauce ingredients, but I neither had the time nor all the ingredients to make this sauce. Plus, I did not want a "ketchupy" taste.  I was looking only for a way to easily cook the ribs in the slow cooker. I don't think it matters what kind of sauce you use, as long as you cook it properly. Ribs are good if they are cooked right! I personally used the barbecue sauces, steak sauce, liquid smoke, & worcestershire I had, all mixed together to my taste. I followed the cooking per the recipe and the ribs were great!! This was a very easy recipe. Cooking it for 30 mins prior was no big deal, I just baked the ribs on tinfoil to reduce any mess, mixed my sauce in one bowl, threw in a chopped onion, and other than putting the slow cooker bowl in the dishwasher, there wasn't much to clean up or mess with. Also, I did bake my ribs again on a new piece of tinfoil afterwards for 10 mins, but next time I"ll cut that to 7-8 instead. Will definitely make my ribs this way from now on. I served this with the Cheesy Ranch Potato Bake from this site.

We thought these were very good. I did take the advice of another reviewer and used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce instead of all of the other ingredients. I did bake in the oven as the recipe directed and I thought that was a good thing. I also rubbed quite a few spices and seasonings on the ribs before baking--garlic, salt, pepper, etc. Cooking ribs in the crockpot makes the meat just fall off the bone and my family was loving it!! We'll definitely be making this again.

Concept of this was very good and the ribs were "fall off the bone"  I also enjoyed the flavour of the sauce as is and did not find it to sweet.  I did however find that the sauce started to burn in the slowcooker around the 7th hour....just something to watch out for.

To ensure a thicker sauce I cooked the ribs on low for 3 hours with the cover on and then removed the cover for another 2 hours.  Letting the ribs cool for an hour afterward also helped the sauce thinken up.  We LOVED these ribs....as close as you can get to the real thing without a BBQ.  Very moist and delish.

I (as have many others) improved this recipe. After browning the ribs (I used regular pork spare ribs) I added a sliced onion to the crock pot, and on a separate bowl I mixed a couple of cups of my favorite BBQ sauce with a couple of tablespoons of vinegar, a teaspoon of hot sauce, and one small chopped up habanero pepper. Dumped the mixture on top of the ribs (which I rubbed with  a little garlic powder and salt) in the crock pot, and cooked on low for six hours. Then I CAREFULLY took the ribs out and put them on the grill for 5 minutes per side. They were ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS served with smashed red-skinned potatoes and a veggie!

This recipe was excellent.  The sauce has a wonderful flavor!  By the time I got home from work the house smelled wonderful and the meat was falling off the bone.  I will definitely be making this again!

I'm giving this recipe four stars because I even did some of the viewers suggestions and had 2 cups of  barbecue sauce and one cup of ketchup and my husband still said it was too ketchupy. (I decided to make my own barbecue sauce and used the "Nana's Barbecue sauce from this site.)  I did bake on both sides first in the oven at 400 Degrees for 30 minutes with adding garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper (15 mins on each side only seasoning one side first, and then the other one when I flipped it over)  I think this did a good job at getting rid of a lot of the grease and seasoning it.  Next time I think I will just put the nana's barbecue sauce in it since it has a lot of the same ingredients anyway, and not add the extra ketchup and other ingredients.  Also I took this out at 5 1/2 hours and literally could not get the meat out since it was falling off the bone so much.  I had to get tongs just to get the meat all out of the crock-pot!

I would rather rate it a 3.5. Even to bake it in the oven for 30 mins. no grease was rendered.  The result was very greasy and unhealthy.  Of course the guys in the house loved the fact that it fell off the bone, but I don't think I will do it this way again. The taste was very good though (after swimming through the grease).

Ok, I'm giving this 5 stars based on cooking method, but I can't comment on the sauce as I just used premade BBQ sauce.  I used baby back ribs and it didn't take more than 5 hours for them to be super tender.  I then put them back in the oven and coated them a bit more and they were excellent.  Bottom line, the method is great, but I'm sure you can mix it up a bit as to what spices you rub on first, and the sauce.

This dish was phenomenal!!  I also substituted the barbecue sauce for the ketchup, and the ketchup for the chili sauce, and it turned out perfect.  I used spare ribs, and cooked for 6 hours.  I did add a little crushed red pepper into the sauce too.  I served it with  Grandma Sophie's Smashed Potato Salad (also from this site), and corn on the cob...it received rave reviews from my boyfriend, and he's not even a big rib fan!!!

Too bad I didn't read the reviews-had I read them-I would have substituted the 2 cups of ketchup with barbeque sauce.  If I was a more experienced cook, I might have looked at the recipe and figured that was too much ketchup, I guess I will know for next time!  The meat was very tender, falling off the bone.  I cooked 3.5 lbs for about 7 hours on low after browning the ribs in the oven as directed.

THESE WERE THE BEST RIBS I HAVE EVER EATEN!! My husband LOVES ribs, we have been to the best rib places in Chicago and I have to say, these beat out anywhere I have been.  This was the first time I have ever made ribs at home (my husband usually cooks them on the grill)  with it being so cold out, I thought I would try it.  They were outstanding.  I took others suggestions and used BBQ sauce instead of Ketchup and Ketchup instead of Chili Sauce (2C BBQ and 1C Ketchup).  The Meat fell right of of the bone as I was putting them on my plate.....my two year old never eats anything and she had three of them.  YUMMY!!!!!!!!! Can't wait to make them again....

I tried this recipe a few weeks ago, and, in going with what other reviewers have suggested, I did not use the full amount of ketchup. I mostly used Stubb's BBQ sauce. I also added Liquid Smoke, for a better BBQ flavour, and I rubbed the ribs in minced garlic before throwing them into the cooker. I did use boneless country-style ribs, because they looked MUCH easier to handle! In all, these ribs turned out very well. I paired them with halved corn cobs and mashed potatoes for a well-rounded Southern home-style meal. My only wish is that I could have prepared this dish for a larger crowd (instead of just my boyfriend & I). After about three days of eating ribs for every meal, were were all ribbed out!

I was a bit skeptical about ribs in the crock pot, but I didn't want all the work involved with other rib recipes, so I gave it a try.  They turned out beautifully!  Every bit of the meat on the bones was tender and melt-in-your-mouth perfect. I made 3 lbs. which was perfect for 2 adults and 2 children.

I made some alterations: I used 2 cups of chili sauce and 1 cup of ketchup; I used apple cider vinegar instead of regular and added a couple of splashes more than the recipe called for; I pre-cooked the ribs in the oven for 10 minutes each side instead of 15; and about halfway through cooking, I moved the ribs from the bottom of the crock pot to the top, and those on top to the bottom.

Personally, I really liked the flavor, and I didn't use bbq sauce...I made it exactly as written.  I used country style ribs, and they turned out so tender and actually fell off the bone after about 4 hours.  I can't wait to have the leftovers as sandwiches on rolls tomorrow.  Thanks for a great recipe, Suzanne!

These were very good. I used country style ribs instead of baby back & cooked them about 6 hours. For the sauce I cut the ketsup down to 1 C & used 1 C of BBQ sauce, ommitted the chili sauce & hot sauce & used all of the other ingrediants. These were great. I served them with the Cheesy Ranch Potato Bake recipe from this site. Thanks.

These ribs are tender & delicious.  I've made them twice already.  I reduced ketchup to 1 cup, and added 1 bottle of Jack Daniels original recipe BBQ sauce, omitted the oregano and hot sauce and used apple cider vinegar.  Can't wait to make again.

Unlike the rest of you, I thought that the sauce was too tomatoey (sp?) for my taste. I even used 1 c BBQ and 1 c ketchup. Plus I thought that they were dry and I cooked them for 7 hours after baking them in the oven for 15 min each side. I did use boneless country style ribs if that makes any difference.

***Updated to say this is a regular rotation on our menu.  It has been served at many family gatherings and is always popular.  Follow the recipe exactly and you cannot go wrong.***

Excellent!  Hubby said it was going to be on the regular menu from now on.  I hate cooking, and this made it super easy, and super tasty!

I am going to rate this based on what my husband said - 3 or 4 stars - I gave it 4 due to the fact that is was quick and easy.  I read all the reviews and was excited to try it.  Must be me because I didnt like it at all.  The ketchup was very over powering.

This is my favorite slow cooker recipe.  I use seafood cocktail sauce in place of ketchup to give it that horseradish bite.  It plays well off of the brown sugar, so the sauce isn't quite so sweet.  The pre-roasting removes a lot of the fat, and the ribs are so tender they melt in your mouth.  Be sure to use apple cider vinegar; it has the best flavor.  I also recommend cooking them 7 hours max.  I left them for 8 hours one time, and the sauce turned into glue.  I make this once a month, year round!

Thanks for this recipe. very easy to do and my children loved it, no objection and dinner time was great! I'll do it again and again. prepared it in the morning and put it in the slow cooker. i brushed each piece of the ribs top and bottom before i placed them in the slow cooker and then poured the reminder of the mixture on top, covered, set it on slow and left. 8 hours later dinner was just amazing.

The sauce for these ribs is out of this world and SO easy!  I don't always have a lot of luck with babyback ribs, so cooking them in the slow cooker is about as fail proof as it gets for me.  Tender, succulent ribs, dripping in a sweet, tangy sauce = a definite Winner!

Ok, I have to say these were very tender done this way but watch out, and don't overcook the sauce.  It can burn being in the pot so long.  I try and stay as close to a recipe as I can the first time to rate so the only small adjustments I made were, I used light brown sugar for the brown sugar and I had Thai Chili Garlic Paste(I decreased and added water to make sauce) for the Chili Sauce and left out the hot pepper sauce because of the heat here.    Glad I did, this was still pretty spicy.  I also cut back just a little on the ketchup.  So I didn't have any additions or subtractions, just adjustments.  I'm not using Thai Chili next time. haha

I did the prep work (pre-cooked the ribs to drain fat and made the sauce) yesterday. Covered the ribs with the sauce and put in the fridge overnight. Then, this morning I just put the prepared crock pot in the cooker and set to low for 6 hours. Followed the recipe as written with the exception of adding a post crock pot 1/2 hour in the oven to caramelize and thicken the sauce.  They were tender; the sauce was just a bit too much like ketchup than real BBQ sauce. Next time, will use "jar sauce" for more authentic BBQ flavor.

Great recipe, use the bbq instead of the oven to sear your ribs, it just adds an extra layer of flavor and don't be afraid to add some liquid smoke to your sauce mixture ( 1/2 - 1 tsp ) depending on your taste buds. Trust me you'll love it. --BEAR--

I'm not sure if I should give high stars because the ribs turned out great or low stars because I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce instead of preparing the one in the recipe.  Either way, these turned out GREAT!!!  I also used the red wine vinegar and liquid smoke.  DELICIOUS!!!

The flavor and directions were great but the chili sauce made this too spicy for all of us to enjoy it.  I am a fan of spicy food but it was instant heartburn.  I would suggest downsizing or leaving out?

I did the switchero with 2 cups of my fav bbq sauce (famous daves sweet and sassy, yum!) and one cup ketchup. the rest of the recipe i left as it. It was good, but just average. The sauce was great, but we overall prefer grilling ribs. worth a try though

Superbly delicious.  I added many of the suggestions -- 1/2 Heinz Ketchup and 1/2 KC BBQ sauce, added 1 fresh garlic clove minced  and one Vidalia onion, finely chopped and substituted chili sauce for 1/2 A-1 Thick and Hearty and 1 Tablespoon of chili powder.  Slow cooked on low for 10 hours and caramelized the sauce with the Member-suggested 30 min. oven broiling time.  Perfect, and I have a picky palate for pork ribs.

I followed other reviewers' advice and substituted bbq sauce for the ketchup, (2 cups) and ketchup for the chili sauce. Then followed the rest of the instructions. Hate to substitute, but it appears based on almost all reviews that this was the best way to go and they turned out delicious. I didn't want to change it and have ribs that tasted more on the ketchup side. I always use sweet baby rays, but today will try Famous Dave's.

These were the best ribs we've had; however I used BBQ sauce and omited the chili and hot sauce.

Followed the recipe completely without changing anything, well I did change something. Instead of pork I used beef. Hubs does not like pork at all. I couldn't believe the whole family loved it though. Especially my two little picky eaters. This one is a keeper, I will definitely make this one from time to time.

If you want fall off the bone ribs this is a great recipe.
The secret is to cook the ribs as indicated in the oven first to get some fat off, then you can add your own BBQ sauce or follow the recipe. I usually make my own with BBQ sauce,ketchup,worchesterchire, hot sauce, brown sugar & red wine vinegar to my liking. The kids love these ribs everytime I make them and its so easy with the crock pot. Set it in the morning and come home to a dinner that is easy to put together!

As others mentioned, loved the technique but love my Bullseye BBQ sauce. Used 3.46 pounds (1 big rack) which only made barely enough for 4 people, so I feel like the serving size was off unless 2 ribs a person is normal. I suggest spending the time to carve most of the fat up front. It will make the eating more enjoyable. The meat comes out sooooo moist and tender. Will try other's suggestions of baking with a fresh layer of BBQ sauce to carmelize the sauce on.

Winter in Wisconsin limits doing ribs on the grill, so I thought I would try this.  My 15 yr old (very picky) thought it was the best ribs he ever had and requested them again for his birthday. I browned the ribs 15 on both sides and then coated them in the best BBQ sauce (ZaksRaks)and they fell off the bone.  Cooking two crock pots today for a big family gathering.  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed others suggestions and replaced the ketchup with bbq sauce and used 1 cup ketchup instead of chile sauce.  They turned out fabulous.  I baked them at 300 deg. for the last 1/2 hr which really carmelized the ribs.  My family loved them.

I followed the recipe for the most part, my husband and father are rib connoisseurs; they even give it a "thumbs up" with the variation that I make.  I use whatever BBQ sauce I have, add ketchup, red burgundy cooking wine (4TBS), a can of green chilies or jalapenos.  If you use jalapenos the sauce will be spicy, liquid smoke (1tsp), Worcester sauce, onions and brown sugar.  I then put them on low for 3-4 hours then remove them to glaze.  If you don’t have time to glaze them, they will be ready to serve right out of the crockpot.

Didn't even resemble ribs once they were out of the slow cooker, just a lot of pork meat that were way overcooked and bones. Will not be repeating.

I am cooking for 1 person with a very small appetite, so halved the measures.  I had a ketchup which was spicey enough for me.  I found the sauce quite delicious.  I don't know what a slow cooker is, so I fried them and towards the end finished them off in the sauce.

OMGOODNESS!  Freaking AMAZING!  Screw the grill lol.  I can't wait to make them again.  I'm actually going to make it with a whole chicken next time.  This is going to be my go to bbq recipe.  I didn't have any chili sauce so I took others advice and used 1 1/2 c of ketchup (instead of 2) and 1 c of sweet baby rays bbq sauce.  EXCELLENT!  Fell off the bones when I put my fork into it, literally.  The flavor was amazing.  Anyways, I could go on and on.  My husband loved it just as much :)

I wanted a good, easy way to fix pork spareribs, so tried this.  Used 1 cup catsup, 2 cups Baby Ray's sauce, and turned out delicious.  Liked that you browned the ribs in the oven before the slow cooking.  Allowed to cook about the 6 hours.  Don't let it cook too much longer than that, or it gets kind of stringy.  Was very good.

Amazing, tender fall of the bone....perfect! Cooked for 8 hours on low after roasting for 30-45 min in the over first. I did NOT use the BBQ sauce stated here...I made Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce from this site and it was out of control good!. Had some left over that I reheated for dipping this lucious meat. A true winner!

This is a good recipe.  I also used half BBQ sauce and half ketchup.  I seasoned the ribs with homemade Kansas city rub instead of just salt and pepper.  My family definitely wants this again.  The ribs were tender and the sauce was delicious with a few adjustments made.

Did just as recipe called for even though I wanted to use my favorite BBQ sauce.  This sauce was all ketchup flavor, so half way through the cooking time I added some African Smoke BBQ Seasoning (Trader Joe's I believe has it).  Anyway that made it edible.  We decided the method of cooking was great - tender ribs so will do again only without this sauce.  There was so much sauce left over that we thought it would be good as a pulled pork or sloppy joe.  We took leftover ribs & some hamburger, added the sauce & WOW!!!!  Now I have a new sloppy joe recipe using this sauce that I like better & I may try a pork roast with this sauce, with the African Smoke Seasoning & make a pulled pork.  Thanks for the recipe, just because we don't like it for the ribs, we will use in the other 2 ways.

I made these using 1 cup ketchup, 2 cups bbq sauce and the rest the same, I boiled them before hand, and then slow cooked for 7 hours, then threw them on the bbq for a few minutes. They were amazing!  We used to just boil them and then bbq, but this is how were going to do them from now on!

Followed recipe exactly, besides the fact that I doubled it.  The sauce smells and tastes great, the ribs browned beautifully!  Everything is in the slowcooker, in the fridge, waiting to be plugged in in the morning. So far this recipe scores a 5 for ease of preparation.  Will follow up with results and a rating from the finished product.......can't wait!!!

Just cooked these last night. I had 10 lbs. ribs, I did them in two batches in the slow cooked. I loved the sauce, I think it is worth makeing. I t is not your normal bbq tasting sauce, spicy, sweet, unique. Only bad thing was, 8 hours way too much cooking time. Pulled the first batch out after about 7 hours, and they were literally falling off the bone, which for presentation purposes, just does not work. Did the second batch for 6 hours and checked frequently, much better! I also chose to pre cook on grill as opposed to oven, worked great with less mess, but still burned of any unnecessary fat.

This was a hit! Much better than just using bottled BBQ sauce. My only changes: i did not use chili sauce because I didnt have it. Left out Worcestershire sauce because my daughter is allergic to it but loves ribs. Instead I used soy sauce. My sister-in-law who is like a rib-cooking top chef loved them.

I couldn't stop eating these, almost half a rack to myself, but I just could tell if I would have rather liked it on the grill with a bit of a crust on it. They were very tender and moist. Fall of the bone kind. I used store bought bbq sauce.

I did not care for this recipe.  I love me some ribs but ribs not slow cooked in a smoker just aren't worth the time.

Perfect ribs. Although i didnt use the sauce recipe I used my favorite store bought sauce and followed the directions for cooking. The ribs came out great. They were very tender and falling off the bone. My family loved this recipe and i will be cooking my ribs this way from now on.

I only used 1 cup of ketchup and substituted the other cup with Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ Sauce.  They were melt in your mouth delicious.  I also used pork spareribs instead of baby backs due to cost.  I had a little more fat to drain but other than that, they were great!

GREAT Ribs.  A couple of changes.  I thought it'd be a good idea to add a wee touch of liquid smoke.  Well  the lid came off and I ended up adding a BUNCH. Well, it turned out great, the sauce was wonderful and ribs had a great hickory smoked taste.  Last half hour I threw them on the grill, indirect heat and then back in the slow cooker.  Awsome ribs.  4 lbs just was'nt enough

Very good but a little too much catsup in the taste for me.  I would probably decrease the amount of catsup next time and substitute a chili sauce.  Also, I used a sweet chili sauce not a hot sauce.  I prefer sweet to hot.

By far the best bbq ribs ever! Everyone complimented profusely on them. I made a marianade using canola coil, garlic powder, course grd blk pepper, mrs dash, adobo, sazon, and old bay for the ribs, then cooked on high first hour, low for 6 more hours, then took out of crockpot and put on broiler tray, liberally applied bbq sauce such as bullseye kansas city style, broiled in oven a few mins to brown up, and the meat literally fell off the bones! Can't wait to make more!

I used this recipe with Beef Ribs and made a few changes (like just using BBQ sauce in place of the ketchup, chili sauce, vinegar). Looks marvelous.

I listened to other reviewers. I used 1 C. Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, 1C. ketchup, 2 T red wine vinegar, no hot sauce but I did add the other ingredients( minus a little of the brown sugar). We love it! My husband said I should use this sauce for my pulled pork sandwich recipe. I intend to try it out on my coworkers @ the next pot luck.

These were the best ribs I think I've ever eaten...seriously!   The only thing I did different was use a bottled bbq sauce because of time constraints.  Ribs were perfect - tender, moist and fell off the bone.  I wouldn't hestitate to cook these if I had people over - ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!

After reading the reviews posted by others, I decided to substitute 1 cup of catsup for 1 cup of original BBQ sauce.  The ribs were great. I normally don't like sauce in a slow cooker, as I have found that the sauce gets watered down. I was pleasantly surprised that the sauce didn't water down this time. My daughter thought this tasted the best of any ribs she had ever eaten. I would recommend this recipe to others and will be preparing it again.

Best crock pot barbq ever.  I used 1 cup ketchup to one cup (Jack Daniels) barbq.  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  Last 20 minutes or so I threw in oven so sauce would carmelize.  This was great!

This was my first time making ribs & they came out sooo moist & tender!  They were awesome!!  I tweaked the sauce a little for our tastes by sauteing some onions & garlic in olive oil then adding the ketchup, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, cider vinegar, and I added mustard, red pepper flakes and a chopped chipotle pepper with some adobo sauce.  I also followed another review and browned them under the broiler at the end.  I will be making these again and again!!

FABULOUS!!!  I have tried many slow cooker rib recipes and this is the BEST!  I think it may have to do with baking the ribs before putting them in the slow cooker.  the end product is not greasy and the ribs are very flavorful.  Thanks for this keeper of a recipe!

Sauce was thin, would suggest putting the ribs in the oven at the end so the bbq sauce can thicken and carmelize on top of the ribs.  The meat was very tender.

I guess I'm not a fan of the flavour that ribs get when put in the slow cooker.  They were very tender but I couldn't get over the flavour.  I prefer Martha Stewart's recipe for "Oven-Roasted Ribs with Barbecue Sauce".  You need to be home to cook them but they are so worth the effort.

Fabulous!  Baked ribs the night before, covered and refrigerated them.  Early next morning, continued w/ recipe so they'd be ready for a 1 PM pre-bowl party.  

Got many raves, delicious and meat falling off bones.

I didn't like the sauce but I loved how the meat itself turned out. I'll just keep searching for a better sauce.

These were really good! I added a little more brown sugar than called for and next time I think I'll use less ketchup because the sauce tasted a little too much like ketchup for me. Overall they were very tender and full of flavor!

UNBELIEVABLE!!!!!!  I would give it six stars if possible.  I followed everything to a T except for the BBQ sauce.  I used a bottle of local sauce instead of making my own.  I mean if you live in TX....why bother?  :)

The only changes I made are: I used my favorite BBQ sauce instead of the ingredients suggested here.  Brushed the ribs lightly with the sauce before putting them in the crockpot.  Then at the end I broiled them with another small layer of sauce.  YUM. Cooking directions were perfect.

I made these ribs and they were delicious!  I took the recommendation of all the other reviews.  Used twice the bbq sauce and a squirt of ketchup, and added garlic powder, onion powder and mesquite seasoning to the ribs.  They were tender and very well seasoned.  Once again read the reviews.

I ADDED EXTRA HOT SAUCE, PROBABLY 8 DASHES ATLEAST AND A LITTLE EXTRA BROWN SUGAR. IT WAS THE MOST AMAZING BARBECUE SAUCE EVER!! I NORMALLY HATE BARBECUE SAUCE BUT MADE IT FOR MY FAMILY.  I LOVED IT!!! DELICIOUS!! I SERVED OVER WHITE RICE AND BROCCOLI.

Easy to make and delicious. I also did 2 cups BBQ and 1 cup ketchup. Next time, I'm just going to use BBQ sauce.  Also broiled at the end. I will definately do this again.

Very good!!! I used dark brown sugar instead of regular brown sugar. Instead of ketchup, I used Jack Daniel's barbecue sauce. I cooked on low for 6 or 7 hours and they were so tender they fell right off the bone when I tried to take it out. I did brown in the oven before putting them in the cooker.

I have made these twice now, and my family is loving it!!   I have used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce instead of ketchup...maybe next time I will put them in the oven after the crock-pot.  That is, if they don't fall apart before I can get them to the pan!!   YUM!!!

made it for my sister's bday dinner and she LOVED it. i cooked it for exactly 6hrs and the meat was just about to fall off the bones.  substituted the stubb's bbq sauce for the ketchup instead like everyone else suggested. tasted a lot like the stubbs bbq. maybe i will up the worcestershire sauce next time to reduce the stubbs bbq flavoring

Definitely some of the best ribs ever. I subbed in Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce for the ketchup. Also I took a suggestion in one of the reviews and put the ribs back in the oven after they were done for about ten minutes so they would get a nice crust on the top.

What a great recipe!!  So easy and so tender and tasty.  I took the advice of some before me who suggested replacing some of the ketchup with bbq sauce.  I was only making one rack of ribs since there are only two of us, so I cut all the ingredients in half for the sauce.  So when it came to the ketchup, I did only 1/4 c of ketchup and 3/4c of bbq sauce (I used Bulls Eye).  My husband and I both loved these ribs.  Came out wonderful!  Definitely will be going into my keeper recipe file.

We absolutely loved these ribs!  I read alot of the reviews before I tried them for a Labor day gathering.  I made my own sauce using Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce in the mix.  I followed the rest of the directions as written.  I left the lid ajar for the last 30 minutes of cooking to let the sauce carmelize.  The meat fell off the bone and was so tender and flavorful.  I will definately make these again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe and the great suggestions!

This is a top-notch recipe. Thank you for posting it. I prepared this dish as directed. I followed a few suggestions from other ratings by doing the following: I had 5 pounds of ribs, so I played it safe by doubling the ingredients for the sauce. The extra sauce was used for dipping french fries. I also used half ketchup-half barbeque sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's). The only other change I made was adding approximately 1 teaspoon of garlic powder which truly added some nice taste to the sauce. I will certainly make this again (and again!)

This is a great recipe... I did change brown sugar to 2 tbs, 2 tsp of vinegar, add dash of hickory liquid smoke, use a salsa to substitute chili sauce, and used Jack Daniels and Budweiser barbecue sauce to substitute ketchup. I do not like sweet or the taste of chili sauce. You will need to watch every 2 or 3 hours because it thickens up so you will need to stir and add more sauce. He left me five piece of rib...it was that GOOD!

I followed other reviewers' advice and substituted bbq sauce for the ketchup, (2 cups) and ketchup for the chili sauce. (1 cup) I cut back on the vinegar to 2 1/2 Tbsp. just because I thought 4 Tbsp. was a lot. I also left out the hot sauce, simply because I didn't have any on hand. I used boneless Country Style Ribs. I couldn't get them out of the crock pot in one piece, they were soo tender! Thank you so much for this recipe, it is definitely one of the BEST on this site

These ribs are so good I wish I had a bigger slow cooker. The only thing I changed was half BBQ sauce & half ketchup and I added a couple of cloves of minced garlic. Otherwise 8 hours to outstanding ribs. I agree that cooking in the oven before to roast a little and remove fat is the genius of this recipe. Can't wait until we make the next batch!

I made these ribs today in the crockpot because it is colder than you know what outside and I just had to have ribs. :-) They were delicious and every bit as good if not better than anything you will get in any of the chain resturaunts.  I applied rub to the ribs, browned in the oven as directed, placed in crockpot on high for about six hours, and then I took them out onto a jelly roll pan and applied my favorite sauce and popped into the oven 350 degrees for about 20 minutes.  The succulent meat of babybacks may never touch my grill agian! The cooking method is what is special about this recipe.  Thank you so much Suzanne2802.

Made these for a Superbowl Party yesterday, was my first time ever making ribs.  Took some advice from previous reviews and used half the amount of ketchup and substituted bottled bbq sauce for the rest.  Cooked them the full 8 hours and they were falling off the bone delicious!  Everyone loved them and they were super easy!

I get that you shouldn't have to change the original recipe, but by just changing the ketchup to one cup and using 2 cups of sweet baby rays honey bbq sauce (omit chili sauce) - these were the BEST RIBS ever.  My husband goes to Memphis in May for their annual bbq cook off and he said these are up there with the best.

Oh my God, these are great!!!  Very crispy on the outside and fell off the bone!  My husband is so critical when it comes to ribs, and he LOVED them!!  I had to brown them a bit longer than the recipe said and instead of using all the ketchup the recipe called for, I used half ketchup and half honey chipotle BBQ sauce.  AWESOME!!!

Very very tasty ribs!! I used 2 cups of Sweet baby Rays BBQ sauce, 1 cup of ketchup, extra splashes of tabasco (hot sauce) less vinegar then the recipe called for, and then added the rest of the ingredients. After cooking in the crock pot I coated them with more BBQ sauce, and baked them for 20min. on 350 degrees, to caramelize.

We used country-style ribs and kind of made some sort of mash up as far as the sauce is concerned. We put in BBQ sauce and a little bit ketchup + all of the other ingredients; it turned out great. By the time these were in the slow cooker the entire time they were just falling apart.

These were fabulous! I did substitute the ketchup for barbeque sauce after reading the other reviews. Other than that I followed the recipie exactly, and slow cooked the ribs for 6 hours. They fell right off the bone and were delicious!

My husband got into the crock pot a little early to check on them because they smelled so good. When they were ready he dug in and said that they tasted every bit as good as they smelled. Great recipe!

Sauce was a little watery, but the taste was devine.  Shredded the left over meat and sauce together for sandwiches tomorrow. P.S. Do not skip browning in oven part.  Makes a big difference. Spray slow cooker with pam for easy clean up. :)

This is a great recipe! I've made it a handful of times; my husband loves it. I substitute 1 cup of bbq sauce for 1 cup of ketchup and have found using a thai sweet chilli tastes really good too. The best part is that it's quick and easy. I can make it the night before or in the morning before work. Coming home to the smell of cooked ribs... mmm, so good.

I LOVE this recipe!!! I used boneless baby back ribs and took the advice from others and let them carmelize in the oven for about 15 minutes at the end. I did not have any floating grease on my ribs. I also used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce instead. Thanks!

These were excellent! For the non-pork eaters in my family, I added some small cuts of beef steaks to the pot to cook along with the ribs. Everyone was pleased and all sampled the pork after hearing how delicious it was, agreeing it was better than any NYC BBQ place! Thanks for the recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe. Such good flavor. The only problem is that my slow cooker is too small so I baked the ribs in the oven at 200 degrees for the same amount of time. Finger-lickin good!!!

I followed this recipe almost to a T. I omitted the ketchup and the hot sauce. I used a half bottle of jack daniel's brown sugar bbq sauce. I also used mesquite seasoning.Husband said these were 5 star quality. I will be making these again.

I didn't follow the recipe because it seemed like way too much ketchup. I basically used this recipe for the cooking method. Bake in the oven first, then throw in the slow-cooker. I rubbed the ribs with salt, pepper, garlic & onion powder and baked it. Then, threw it in the slow-cooker w/ half a bottle of barbecue sauce and let it cook for 7-8 hours. Fell off the bone.. delicious!

Instead of 3/4 c of chili sauce, I used 1/4 c and 1/2 c of barbecue sauce.  I also used an extra tablespoon of vinegar.  I also started the ribs on the grill, instead of the oven.  The ribs were fall-off the bone tender and delicious!

As other reviewers suggested, I used 2 cups BBQ sauce and 1 cup ketchup instead of the 2 cups ketchup/1 cup chili sauce. I also used a rib rub before putting these in the oven. Otherwise, made exactly as recipe stated and these came out perfect and tender. They were falling off the bones. The first step of putting them in a 400 degree oven browned them just enough so they came out a good, caramelized brown color after 8 hours in the slow cooker. Delicious!

VERY VERY GOOD.  I switched out the ketchup & chili sauce for bbq (Jack Daniel's Original No. 7 Recipe to be exact) & ketchup like everyone else had suggested.  I cut back a little on the vinegar but I think I shouldn't have.  I cooked them for about 6 1/2 - 7 hrs but I think it was too long.  I cut the recipe in half (2 lb. rack) and I think it would have been better to eat around 6 hours.  The bbq sauce seemed a little burnt.  We had it with potatoes and corn on the cob!!  YUM!

This recipe is great with some minor tweaking. Like others, I substituted 2 cups Jack Daniels barbecue sauce for the ketchup and 1 cup ketchup in place of the chili sauce. Seasoned the ribs first with onion powder, garlic salt and black pepper based on another reviewer's advice. Excellent flavor!

Very good..wow..I even saved the juices for basting meat on the grill..yummy!! I did what a reviewer said and used BBQ sauce for the kethup and kethup for the chili sauce. I only added 2 1/2 TBL vinegar..I agree that 4 is just way too much;0)I will make this all the time:)

These are exceptional!!!  I also, like others, used 2 cups bbq sauce, 1 cup ketchup instead of the 2 cups ketchup, 1 cup chili sauce.  I also used dark brown sugar and these caramelized beautifully!
What a treat!

Since Boston offers poor choices for BBQ (We are from Texas and very picky) this was awesome!!!  I seasoned the ribs with garlic and onion powder before putting in the oven per other reviewers tips and used 4lbs of country style boneless pork ribs. I also followed the tips of using 2 cups of BBQ instead of 2 cup ketchup and 1 cup ketchup instead of 1 cup chile sauce.  This recipe is definitely a keeper for when we miss Texas BBQ!

Wow.  This is soooo good.  I read the others comments and decided to not pre-cook the ribs, and I omitted the sugar and oregano.  I used 2 c BBQ sauce and 1 c ketchup, versus using the chili sauce. They turned out perfectly.  Have made them 4 times this month and EVERYONE wants the recipe.  This is a real keeper.

ALl I have to say is WOW! My husband is a very picky eater and he loved these.  I left them ina little longer than I meant to due to work times but these were wonderful, the meat was falling off the bone!  I did make a few changes due to suggestions in comments and also added 1/4 cup lime juice, 1 cup finely cut cilantro, and double the honey.  Thank you for a great base recipe to work from.

Well, where to begin...Oh yeah! This recipe sounded great and as I began preparing it I wondered, "Isn't that a little too much ketchup?" Yup, way too much! The ribs turned out nice and tender, almost falling off the bone, but that sauce...Wow, the sauce is in desperate need of some changes. Here is an idea! Instead of adding all of that ketchup, try substituting it with any of the wonderful prepared BBQ sauces you can buy at your local grocery store or create one of your own. Doing this with the recipe will give you the tenderness you want and the BBQ flavor you are craving!

I have tried a many a Rib Recipes...this is by far the easiest and best tasting I have ever tried...I did what one of the other reviewers did...used BBQ sauce instead of catsup, and catsup instead of Chili sauce. I used Red wine vinegar and only 2 1/2 Tablespoons instead of 4. I also cut back some on the brown sugar...I did not brown them first, just put them right into the crockpot, then poured the sauce mixture over them. But I did put them in the oven for 15 minutes...this added a wonderful caramelizing on them... My Hubby loved them. I want to thank everyone for their reviews and the one who posted this great recipe...this is the one I will do from now on.

Very Very good. I just made it tonight for myself and my husband. We cut the recipe in half and cut the time down to 3.5 hours. It was sooo good. We used Cattlemans Honey BBQ sauce and then added the oregano,ketchup,worsteshires, and 1/4 c. of brown sugar. We didnt add the vinegar we didnt need it. My husband loved the texture and the sauce and hes usually allergic to a bunch of BBQ sauces but not this one!We still have leftovers as well. We used 2lbs of country style ribs worked great!

I have never made ribs before, because I am just not a big meat eatter, but decided to try something new for the hubby. If you are going to use a honey or sweet based bbq sauce, don't put as much brown sugar. I always taste my sauce before I put it on my ribs, if it is too sweet add a little more vinegar. If it isn't hot enough, add a little more hot sauce. I have made these ribs quite a few times now, and each time I try something a little different and they are always good. I wouldn't cook them on low for a full 8 hours,  they are over done then. I cook them for about 6 hours on low, bringing the bottom ribs to the top, and the top to the bottom...once. This always makes it where it doesn't stick as much. Great recipe!!!

I've made this SEVERAL times, each time I cant believe how INCREDIBLE they turn out! I no longer have the need to go out for ribs!!! 
Of course, I read others suggestions...using bbq sauce and cutting down on the ketchup. Also I use 1/2 cup Hoisin sauce instead of chili sauce.  I baste the ribs with the bbq sauce while they are in the oven. Since I am paranoid about them "drying out"/sticking to the bottom, I pour a very small amt of beef broth to the crop pot.

These were awesome!  I pulled them out of the slow cooker and put them under the broiler for a few minutes to get that crispy bbq taste.  They were falling off the bone and delicious!

This recipes was awesome!!! I didn't have chili sauce and was cooking for 2 so I used 2 pounds of baby back ribs, 1 cup of KC Masterpiece BBQ, 1 cup of Ketchup and a few sprinkles of hot sauce and chili powder.  I followed everything else according to the recipe except - cut the oregano down to 1 tsp, 4 hours in the slow cooker on low and voila! Absolutely the best ribs I've had EVER, (and I've had some good ones)! Thanks for sharing!!!!!!!!

These are fantasic.  I did like others and used 1 cup of honey bbq sauce to replace 1 of the cups of ketchup and added a finely chopped onion.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.

Oh, and I saved the sauce and I'm going to use it with chicken like another reviewer suggested so that this awesome sauce doesn't get wasted.

I made this recipe for one of the play off games last month I went to the grocery store all excited to get the ribs and they didn't have any!!! I thought what the heck whats the worst that could happen if i try "country style ribs" 
Let me just tell you they were awesome, still took the amse amt of cooking time while they were cooking i made boston baked beans in the oven, cornbread and coleslaw.  Great meal.  Now i have to one up that meal for the superbowl!! Thanks for  the recipe, I will definately use it again.  Margaret

These ribs were a GREAT winter alternative to ribs on the BBQ.  They cooked beautifully and just fell off the bone. 

I followed the advice of other reviews and subsituted 1 cup of the ketchup with 1 cup of BBQ sauce; the sauce was flavourful and neither too sweet nor to salty- just perfect.   I also simmered the sauce while the ribs were in the oven, just to blend the flavours before putting everything in the crock pot. 

I will certainly make this recipe again!  Thanks for the great advice of other reviews.

These are great! I've made them twice now, and if you read the other reviews, you've seen that there are endless variations for the sauce. As long as you have enough to cover the ribs, almost anything goes. Two things: I used the seasoning mix from Prize Winning Baby Back Ribs (this site), and after baking the ribs, I turned on the broiler to get them really brown and crisp. That way they still have some texture and chewiness, if you like them that way.This is now our favorite way with ribs when it's too cold to barbecue (several months in Canada!).

First of all, let me say, I cannot cook.  I am always looking for easy recipes that will turn out great.  And this is one of them!  I had my parents and in-laws for dinner on a week night for my son's 1 year birthday party.  I prepared this recipe the night before, and started the slow-cooker before work.  I substituted one cup Masterpiece Barbeque Sauce for 1/2 the ketchup.  These ribs were so tender, they fell off the bone and the sauce was delicious.  My whole family was amazed! And for a full-time working mom, what an easy way to make a great meal!  I put the extra sauce back in the cooker with boneless pork chops for yet another meal!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe from someone who is cooking-challenged!  I will make this again and again. No one will ever believe I can't cook.

I used the large, country style ribs and my favorite BBQ sauce as many suggested instead of ketchup.  The meat was so tender it was falling off the bones. My husband, who's a picky eater, said he'd like to make this again. I think when I do though, I may leave out the chili sauce and just use an extra cup of BBQ sauce. Add a little more than a dash of hot sauce to kick up the flavor for me.

My husband does not like ketchup, so instead of using 2 cups of ketchup, I used one cup of ketchup and 2 cups of BBQ sauce. I left out the chili sauce all together. These ribs were soooo yummy, I will definitely make these again!

Great Idea putting it in the oven 1st....Had not ever tried that before.
This recipe to me was more of a Buffalo styled recipe instead of the same old barbecue sauce out of the bottle......Substituting barbecue sauce kind of ruins the originality of this recipe.

No changes....completed the meal with seasoned roasted red potatoes and broccoli.  Good idea to bake first to get rid of unwanted fat that will congeal and burn in the slow cooker.  Awesome recipe!

This is always a reliable and delectable dish. I've followed the recipe exactly, and followed some of the suggestions to tweak the ingredients, and we like them all. The ribs are always fork tender and flavourful.

I followed the instructions by  Joelen and my two kids ate the whole rack! I cut an onion into 3 sections and placed it under the rack and that was a nice touch.

I  made this recipe for my  family and they LOVED it!  My sister loved it so much she asked for the recipe.  The only change in made was I added  2 gloves of garlic because we like garlic so much.  This recipe will definitely become a family favorite.

I'm making this for the third time in a month. I didn't care for the flavor combinations the first time around so I adjusted it(a lot by the way)the second time and they were phenomenal. McCormick has a Memphis style dry rub(Tennessee girl here). I applied generously to both sides of a 2.5 lb. rack of pork loin back ribs. I did precook them in the oven like the recipe suggested. I used 4 different bottles of Kraft BBQ(Hickory, Honey, Brown Sugar and Sweet and Spicy)which I added to my slow cooker first and let sit on low for the time I baked the ribs. I added the ribs to the sauce mixture. Turned it may be 4 times for the 6 hours it cooked and WOW!!! They literally fell off the bone. My family asks for them all the time no. The cut of meat is fairly inexpensive but you can't tell the difference.

I made this recipe and followed the directions exactly. The ribs were tasty and my family ate them. There is nothing wrong with the basic recipe in my opinion, it made some decent ribs - just too sweet for our liking.  I would cut down on the brown sugar if I ever make these again or give equal parts brown sugar and vinegar to balance it out more.

I followed this recipe exactly as submitted. The taste was excellent and the meat literally fell off the bone.    However, it hardly served 4.  I can't imagine how it would serve 8.  Word of advise: plan accordingly!

REALLY good recipe -- a KEEPER!! My wife has never liked ribs - or at least has never praised mine! I've got numerous recipes and a REALLY nice smoker but they never got an "attaboy". This recipe WORKED! I read numerous reviews and used the beer instead of water, cooked on high for 4 hours, and used the 20 min / 350F oven + 7 min on broil cook. They were beautiful, tender, and tasty.
Got that "attaboy" I needed!!!

i browsed the reviews and did a combination of suggestions, end result was super easy and delicious! i sprinkled the ribs with onion powder, garlic salt and fresh pepper, then cooked them 15 minutes on each side in the oven at 400. after done, i placed in the crockpot, poured in half a bottle of Trader Joe's Carolina Gold BBQ sauce, and cooked on low for 6 hours, turning the ribs and basting the with the bbq sauce occasionally. after the 6 hours, turned crockpot on high for 30 minutes to thicken the sauce. the ribs were tender and delicious. i honestly won't ever cook ribs on the grill again.

It's really good. I just have a problem giving five stars to anyone who uses BBQ or chilli or any type of jar sauce. It's not their recipe that rocks it's Heinz or bulls eye.......  I read a recipe that had 5 stars that had the ingredients. The pasta, the jar of sauce, cheese and some garlic and Italian seasoning. THAT is not a recipe that should be on this site. But that's just me.

I like cooking the ribs in the oven so you can drain the grease. I add a tablespoon of dried mint leaves and 4 tbls of vinegar to any bottled barbecue sauce and let it sit overnight. Yes mint leaves. Everyone like the lighter flavor.

This was my first time making ribs and they turned out fabulous! I took the advice of other reviewers and used 2 cups BBQ sauce and 1 cup ketchup and omitted the chili sauce. While baking (before placing in slow cooker) I poured some of the sauce over the ribs. Other than those very minor changes I followed the recipe as is. Lovely, flavorful, fall off the bone ribs that will make your house smell so yummy while they cook :)

WOW!  I  had to put this on for close to 10 hours (work!) and when I got home, these ribs were the most tender, delectable ribs ever!.  I did the oven and sauce part the night before, put it together in the crockpot  and then put in the fridge until morning.  In the morning,  all I had to do was drop the pot in the slow cooker.  super easy.  Might try this method with a store bought recipe of your choosing, if you need to get rid of bbq sauce.  Even my brother-in-law loved the recipe so much he called to thank me for sending him a plate over.  Will definitely be making again!

Love these ribs! Because they are baked first, they don't turn to mush in the slow cooker.  I substituted BBQ sauce instead of ketchup , like others suggested, and ketchup instead of chilli sauce, because I didn't have any chilli sauce. Delicious! I would recommend closer to the 6 hour mark in the slow cooker, I found when I did mine at 8, they were starting to dry out.

I used sweet chili sauce because my husband thought that hot chili sauce would just be too spicy, so with it being like that it was a little too sweet for my liking. We also prefer chicken over any other kinds of meat, so I don't think I'll be making this again anytime soon.

I only rate this a 3 because while it was good, I found it no better than what I've been doing for years, putting ribs in the crockpot with bottled barbeque sauces. So if just doing the extra work and creating your own sauce is what gives you pleasure, then this recipe is definitely flavorful. But I won't repeat it, especially when in my opinion, you can pick your own favorite bbq sauce and pour it over the ribs and forget about it. The one tip I did take away was to brown them in the oven before putting them in the crock pot. Much less grease, so that made me happy!

Recipe itself was okay if you minus all the heat. Don't get me wrong I love spicy food, but this was shing your nose hairs off SPICY!!! LOL It's not a kid friendly recipe. Needless to say, my daughter ended up eating something else for dinner. I decided to add a lot of BBQ sauce to lower the spicy factor and it was good. So good recipe just be mindful of all the spicy ingredients and if you want to tone down the heat than less and throw in some BBQ sauce.

I have never made fall-off-the-bone pork ribs before....until now!  These were GREAT!  I followed the suggestions of several posters and used my favorite BBQ sauce instead of the ketchup, and the ketchup instead of the chili sauce (I still put a bit in though), and I also skimped a bit on the brown sugar which I wont do again.  I doubled the mix because I cooked 2 racks of ribs and it worked fine.  I slow cooked them for 7 hours and the ribs were almost too tender.  Next time I will only leave them in the crock pot for 6.5 hours.  I caramelized my sauce onto the ribs by broiling them for 10-12 minutes...I highly recommend doing this.  Enjoy!

Wow, wow and wow!!! It's been many years since I made bbq and if I would've had this recipe back then I would've made it regularly. My variation from the recipe is that I used a little chili sauce, and put only a squirt of ketchup in it and used a whole bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce, along with a variety of herbs/seasongs. I think the ribs I bought was almost 3 lbs, salt/pepper and baked at 400 deg for 20 mins on each side, then cooked in crock pot for 3 hrs on high, saturated with sauce from crock pot then put back in the oven to carmelize for 30 mins. My only regret is that I didn't make more! I give this recipe 5 stars for the simplicity but 4 stars because I tweaked it to my taste.

I decided to read a lot of reviews before making any changes to the recipe.  I added my own favorite BBQ sauce, Sweet Baby Ray Spciy, and kept the remaining ingredients.  I was a little getting started, so I began cooking on high for the first 2 1\2 hours then on low for 5 hours.  The meat was very tender and practically falling off the bone.  Some people chose to bash the recipe but it's probably best to read reviews so you can make your own decision as far as ingredients.  Also, each slow cooker's temp settings are different.  I've had cheaper slow cookers in the past and have found cooking times are longer with the cheaper models.

BF loved it! Yes, I too substituted BBQ sauce for ketchup, and ketchup for chili sauce, and a big squirt of Sriracha. I also baked them first AND afterwards for extra caramelization.

These are seriously good ribs!!!  The only thing I did differently was added fresh minced garlic (2 cloves), and used 2 cups BBQ sauce and 1/2 cup ketchup.  After 7 hours in the slow cooker I threw them under the broiler to crisp them up on top and wow!  The only shame was that I was counting on leftovers but they didn't stand a chance, everyone loved them.  A+++++++

This was a great way to make fall off the bone, awesome ribs. The one thing I did differently was browning them on the grill. I did not want to fool with the oven so I used some rib rub and grilled them just long enough to brown the outside. I used the sauce recipe and then added a little more ready made barbecue sauce.

These were absolutely delicious and a huge hit at a dinner party (served them with beans and homemade coleslaw).  I changed the recipe a little, in part because I had to double it. I replaced the ketchup with BBQ sauce. I probably did about 2-3 parts BBQ sauce and 1 part ketchup. I used a bit more hot sauce, and I seasoned the ribs with whatever I had in my cabinet before putting the sauce on them.  I also didn't bake them before because I was planning on baking them after (I read in a review that it caramelizes the sauce), but then decided not to do that either because I didn't want to dry them out.

Even though I went a different route as far as ingredients, I have to rate this a 5 for the technique.  I have made ribs in the slow cooker before, but the meat just didn't have the right consistency.  That first step is the key.  Also, not mentioned but equally important, be sure to remove the skin from the backside of the ribs. It's tough and won't break down, even when cooked low and slow. These ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender but still had a little bite to them.  They were some of the very best ribs my wife and I have ever eaten.

As for the ingredients, I used a pork rub on the ribs before I put them in the oven.  A bottle of mustard-based BBQ sauce with one cup of ketchup were mixed with the remaining ingredients as listed.  I also added some dried minced onion to the sauce.  I think I'm going to add a little liquid smoke to them, next time, to make them taste a little more "authentic".

A five star recipe.  Instead of baking the ribs in the oven, I placed mine in the gas grill and browned them for 30 minutes.  To save time, I used a good quality barbeque sauce instead of the ingredients in this recipe.  I really like the concept of cooking ribs in an oven and slow cooker.  A very tasty recipe.

I did not care for the sauce. 

However, the ribs themselves turned out wonderfuly by cooking in the crockpot.

This recipe was awesome!  I was hesitant about doing them in the crockpot as I've always had bad results with pork but these were sooo tender!  I browned them in the oven then cooked them about 6hrs in the crockpot.  Then I basted them with sauce and browned them for about 5 mins in the oven.  Definitely easy and definitely a keeper!!

I loved this recipe. The sauce is simple, and a perfect blend of sweet and spicy. The ribs literally fell apart when i took them out of the slowcooker. My husband said "these are the best ribs iv'e ever had"

I made this last night, and it was sooo good.  I didn't have chili sauce at home, so I used some of my homemade salsa.  I also used a dash of Siracha instead of the hot sauce, since that is what I have at home, and it was pretty amazing. This is a keeper.

My version: I buy a cryovac pack of pork back ribs. My cooker is an old Westinghouse oblong shaped cooker (7x10). It's metal and sets on top of a metal base and has a glass top. I spray the bottom with no-stick spray. I cut the pack of ribs (Hormel) in half. I season all 4 sides with garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper. Then I put a thin layer of Sweet Baby Ray's Original on the bottom. Then I do the same with all sides of the ribs. With my cooker, I set it at 4 and about 2 hours later turn each 2 sections over. I keep doing that till they are all super tender. They always turn out perfect, super tender and flavored just right.

I have made this recipe so many times and given it out so many times, I finally have guilted myself in to leaving a review.  EVERYONE LOVES IT!!! I am asked to make them for almost every party.  The base sauce for this is fabulous.  I adjust to make a more tangy than sweet sauce by cutting down on the sugar and upping the vinegar and worcestshire sauce.  I also char the ribs on the grill prior to putting them in the slow cooker.  For a variation, I use this sauce for pulled pork, use the large cryo vac pork loin, cut up to fit pot.  Pour the sauce over the top and cook on low for 8 to 12 hours.  So easy and goes over really big for a large crowd.  Thanks so much for the great recipe!!

I followed this recipe to a 'T', except I substituted KC Masterpiece for the ketchup.  End result: ribs were cooked beyond recognition.

These perfectly good boneless pork ribs were, indeed, falling apart after cooking on low for five hours. They were so dry, even with the sauce, that you could barely chew them, much less swallow them.  The sauce was good, but I used Bull's Eye in place of the ketchup and left out the sugar, as I don't like sweet sauce.

Excellent recipe!  Saved time by cutting ribs  into serving size, used a dry rub,, took tip by another reviewer & placed on top of sliced onion, poured ready made BBQ sauce over, slow cooked for 3 1/2 hrs in crock pot.  Delicious, thanks!

Fantastic.  I made two pots. One with the sauce used here in recipe, the other with BBQ sauce.  They were equally delicious.  Baking them first to remove some of the fat is key, I also put on the grill after the crockpot to finish them off.  I like the sauce a bit charred on the ribs.

This is a terrific recipe! Came home from work and enjoyed absolutely wonderful, fall-off-the-bone ribs. They did not dry out either. Can't recommend this one enough. I've also started making the BBQ sauce by itself, because that was dynamite good by itself. It's great with chicken and/or burgers. Super good stuff!

Excellent. Better than a restaurant. Followed recipe except used 1 cup brown sugar and left out the hot sauce. Before pouring over ribs, it tasted too sweet and ketchupy, but after slow cooking it was  surpisingly awesome!

A good basic recipe and one that you can adjust to suit your own tastes.  I followed previous suggestions and substituted 2 cups of my favorite bottled barbeque sauce and 1 cup ketchup for the ketchup and chile sauce.  I also added 1 teaspoon liquid smoke seasoning.  My family liked this recipe and loved sopping up the extra sauce with bread.  I think the ribs would be fabulous reheated on a barbeque grill or in the oven.

Positively yummy!  I only had about 3lbs of ribs (one rack) and although my slow cooker is pretty big, I don't think it could hold much more than that.  I cut the rack into two and threw them in the crockpot after roasting in the oven.  They were done in about 3 hours, not 6.  I also made the sauce the day before and marinated the ribs in it for about 24 hours then put them in the oven and crockpot.  Next time I may cut the time down on the oven but these were "fall of the bone awesome".  The husband said they were better than any restaurant.  The only thing he asked was if we could "heat" up the sauce a little more (we tend to prefer spicy food) so next time, red pepper flake and maybe diced habanero.  This is the way to cook ribs for sure!  We had trouble on the grill or oven (never got that tender) and this is the best!

loved these ribs, the only changes i made was to sub BBQ sauce for chili sauce and only about 1 1/2 cups ketchup because that's all I had left in the house. I also chopped one small onion and put in on the bottom of the crock pot then put the ribs on top. The Whole family loved them. will make again.

Great, Great, Great Recipe.  I, too, used 1/2 BBQ sauce and 1/2 ketchup.  I also sprinkled in a healthy dose of garlic pepper.  Everyone loved this.  Thanks!

I made the recipe exactly as it states, except I added half of the amount of chili sauce that the recipe called for. Everyone loved them. My mother-in-law said that they tasted like ribs from an expensive bbq restaurant. 

My only suggestion is that instead of adding all of the chili that the recipe suggests, you should add a little chili sauce at a time until it is to your taste.

This is a seriously delicious recipe.  I broiled the ribs in the oven with salt & pepper then through them into the slow cooker with the sauce and they were perfect.  Moist, tender with lots of flavour.  You can add your own sauce recipe to change things up but they always turn out fantastic! Really great recipe which I have shared with so many who also loved this recipe.  Thanks for posting it!

I tried this recipe and it is fantastic. I did make a few changes. I cooked my ribs first on the grill with salt and pepper on medium heat turning so they don't burn and then put them in my slow cooker and added the ingredients listed plus some smokey BBQ sauce.  I never did ribs at home before as they were always tough but these have a great taste and fall off the bone good.

This was fall-off-the-bone delicious!

I made a couple of adjustments. I used Mccormick BBQ rub on the ribs before browning in the oven. Then I made the sauce in the receipe above minus the vinegar (before we used it in the rub). DELICIOUS!

The method was great, the sauce, not so much. It lacked spice, but had heat. I do like a vinegar sauce but perhaps too much was included for a crock pot stewing and perhaps I did not salt and pepper enough. Also a bit more brown sugar was needed, and I'm never one to add sugar to anything.

Easy & the best fall off the bone ribs I've made yet.
Went boating leaving these in crockpot at home & they were done & dinner was ready when we returned. Doesn't get any easier than that.

Ribs were great, though the sauce was way too much ketchup taste. Too sweet and acidy. Will try next time with 1/2 & 1/2 with BBQ sauce.

I halved the recipe for my husband and I and we had an extra serving left over for the next day's lunch.  The ribs were just as good the next day.  We used "rooster sauce" for the chili sauce (it is actual chili sauce but has a rooster on it so we call it that).  We also used Valentina for the hot sauce.  They came out pretty spicy just the way we like it but I wouldn't think it would be a good idea to make it that spicy for kids. The meat fell right off the bones and were perfectly tender. So easy to make and so delicious.

Sorry guys.  This was just okay.  I wasn't super impressed.  Followed it as written and while it was very tender, it just wasn't fantastic, as I expected from all the reviews.

The kids loved these as they were a step up from the ones that we used to fix. The especially appreciated the melt-in-your-mouth aspect of the meat.

Made this exactly as written and it is very good! Meat was very tender and the taste was very good.  Thanks for a great recipe! UPDATE:  I made this again and it is still wonderful. I used country style pork ribs this time as they were on sale, and I saved a bundle!  Still the best rib recipe!!  Thanks

Used bottled BBQ sauce.  Stood cut rib pieces on edge in crockpot so BBQ coating really cooks onto ribs.

We used BBQ sauce in place of the ketchup and skipped the chili sauce.  Cooked for 8 hours on low and the ribs fell off the bone as we took them out of the crock pot!  My husband liked the ribs that cooked lower in the pot because they were covered in sauce all day and had more flavor.  The ribs on top were still delicious but didn't have as much flavor and were a little dry.  Next time we'll either make a lot more sauce to cover the whole rack of ribs or slow cook in the oven rather than the crock pot.  Overall, a great recipe for a tasty and easy dinner!!

Amazing! We ate it so fast I didnt have time to take pictures!!! We added half ketchup half bbq sauce and added some more garlic salt. I think we used the wrong chilli thing - we use chili sauce that still has the pepper pieces in it. Added a nice spicy kick to it!
It turned out amazing! The best part is that we never cooked ribs before. Ever. So to make these perfect the first time - awesome! We left it in for 8 hours and meat was falling off the bones!
THANK YOU!

I used this recipe the first time I ever cooked ribs and they turned out perfect!  With a few modifications to the seasoning, this has become a favorite in my household.

My entire family - of very picky eaters -- love these ribs. I substituted one cup BBQ sauce for one cup ketchup per suggestion (because of picky eaters). So easy and this time I made it there was nothing left over.

Incorporated several of the ingredient changes recommended by others: replaced the ketchup with BBQ sauce, used a little less vinegar since the BBQ and chili sauces each contain some, added multiple dashes of hot sauce (chipotle to give it a little smokiness) and few sprinkles of crushed red pepper to compliment the oregano and to add a little more zest.  Before eating, broiling them for 10 min to allowed the sugars to caramelize, which also added some nice texture.  All in all, am more of an outdoor grill person however turn to slow cooking in the winter and this recipe turned out very well, so tender.  Next time around though, plan on making both sauces from scratch as it was disturbing the extra ingredients listed on the store bought bottles.

Fabulous!. I followed other posters ideas and used 1 cup hot water, 2 cups Sweet Bby Ray BBQ sauce, 1 cup catsup, 2 1/2 T vinegar. Did not have any chili sauce, so added some citrus chili powder and quite a few shakes of hot sauce. Added the rest of the ingredients and added to the browned ribs in the crockepot. Cooked 2 hours on high and 4 hours on low. Juicey and tender, not greasy and great flavor. A keeper for sure!

We loved these ribs and they turned out great! Just like another reviewer, we used Sweet Ray's BBQ sauce instead of ketchup (I used still about 1/4 cup still for sweetness). You cannot mess these up and I would make these for company too!

I used just 2 pounds of ribs so halved the recipe.  I took others advice and substituted 3/4 of the ketchup with BBQ sauce.  I also added some diced onion to the slowcooker and some fresh garlic to the sauce.  These ribs were fall off the bone good. Oh, I also made the Chili Sauce from the recipe of the same name on this site.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

VERY Good!  I did take other reviewers advice and useBBQ sauce instead of ketchup.  Husband likes the BBQ flavor, so wanted to beef that up.  Will definitely make many more times in the future!  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent dish!  Didn't change a thing, and they turned out perfect.  Used the "mom's coleslaw" recipe as a side dish and some potato salad and it was perfect.

I am giving this only four stars - don't feel like I can give it the full five because like other reviewers, I did not use this for the sauce as outlined.  I used this recipe for the cooking technique.  I rubbed the ribs with beau monde, onion powder and pepper - baked each side for 15 minutes at 400 as called for.  Placed the ribs in the crockpot and poured a bottle of BBQ sauce over them, added 3 cloves of minced garlic and a generous amount of splashes of liquid smoke.  Covered and cooked on low for 8 hours.  While I did not make the sauce as outlined in the recipe, the cooking technique was phenomenal and the ribs turned out great.  I think the pre-baking is key.

These were by far the best ribs I have ever made. Best part, they were super easy. I used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup, and they were yummy. I cooked mine for 7 hours, and the meat fell off the bone :)

I made the recipe exactly as shown for the first attempt.  The ribs didn't release any grease during the oven time so the sauce was swimming in grease in the crockpot.  My ribs were perfectly cooked after 6 hours in the crockpot but the sauce was a little sour.  Next time I'll try cutting the catsup in half and replacing the other half cup with barbeque sauce as others suggested.

Due to some recent dental work I've been forced to eat somewhat soft foods. When I saw this recipe it sounded like it would be really tender. I followed your recipe exactly. Cooked it for 7 hrs. Very tender, and one of the best rib flavors I've ever had! Great recipe! And really easy!

Awesome, awesome recipe.  Awesome!!!!!!!!! AWESOME!!!!  I made these ribs for my fourth of July bash and they were a hit.  I read everyone's comments carefully and the only thing I changed based on others suggestion was I substituted one cup of the ketchup with my favorite barbecue sauce (Swee Baby Ray's).  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  They were tender and flavorful.  Will make again in a smaller batch because 4 lbs of baby back ribs are a bit pricey.

I made a variation of this recipe about 6 months ago.  It was incredible!  I followed the recipe except for using 1 cup of Smokey BBQ sauce and 1 cup of ketchup instead of the two cups of ketchup it called for.   It turned out amazing.  They were easily the best ribs I had ever had.  Tonight I'm making them again, but I added a little bit of crushed Garlic.  They've been in the slow cooker for an hour and a half and they small amazing.  I can't wait!

I started making the sauce before reading the reviews, (which I usually don't do) and must admit I got a little worried.  I decided to go ahead with it, because I didn't really have time to fiddle with it.  I followed the recipe to a T, and... OMG. These are AMAZING.  There is no way this sauce is too ketchup-y.  The ribs cooked for about 6.5 hours, I thin, and the meat was just falling off the bone.  I would say a little onion and/or garlic powder might make these even better, but they are fantastic as is!

This isn't a blow-your-socks-off, impress-your-friends recipe, but it's a good, solid dish for when you've had a hard day at work and want to come home to a tasty meal waiting for you in the slow cooker.  I used boneless country style ribs and followed everyone else's advice by using my favorite BBQ sauce.  I think next time I'll cook it for no more than 5 hours, thin the sauce with a bit more broth, and layer the top of the meat with sliced onions to help the top of the cut retain moisture.

These ribs are amazing!  They are fall off the bone, melt in your mouth delicious. I baked these in the oven with salt and pepper as directed, but used Big Al's KC BBQ Sauce recipe [from this site] for the sauce.  I was a little dubious about cooking ribs in a slow-cooker instead of a BBQ, but the meat was unbeatably tender.  Highly recommended!

They smell GREAT!! Can't wait to eat them. We added a couple extra ingredients. Fresh garlic, and some diced onion to make it more of an authentic bbq sauce.

Yep, fall off the bone tender. I made these as written, but scaled it for 4 servings as I only had 2 lbs of ribs. Amazing. This is the first time I have done ribs in the crockpot and didn't think any method could beat the grill, but I'm revising that opinion. One more thing, the "Angry" reviewer must have mistakenly used "hot" chilie sauce. There is nothing wrong with this recipe. It calls for sweet chili sauce, not hot. Thanks for a great recipe. I will make this again.

I replaced the ketchup and chili sauce with a bottle of barbeque sauce, and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. These turned out really good. My husband the carnivore said they were better than Outback's, so I guess it's a keeper!

Wow! These were amazing! I don't think I'll ever order ribs from a restaurant again....these were way better! I also used bbq sauce (sweet baby rays) in place of the ketchup, but still added some ketchup, just not as much as it called for.I pretty much left everything else the same and was very happy with the outcome. I had to put my pot on high because I got a late start and they were falling off the bone after about 5 hours. I also added more sauce when I took them out and put them in the oven to carmalize. Thanks for sharing! This recipe will be a staple in my home!!

Like everyone else I changed the sauce. I didn't want the sauce to come out tasting to much like ketchup.  Therefore, instead of using two cups of ketchup; I used 1 cup ketchup to 1 cup BBQ sauce. Everything else I kept the same.  The sauce came out great, didn't like my selection of ribs.  I couldn't find baby back ribs so I used Country Style ribs which I thought was to fatty for me. Would I use again...probably cause it was fast and easy to make. I also placed the ribs in the oven after cooking in the crock pot to caramelize the sauce to the meat. I do have another recipe for BBQ ribs that takes alot more prep time, but the ribs are fantastic.

yummy...meat falling off the bone when you pick them up!  i used sweet baby ray's bbq sauce, but i did follow the cooking instructions in this recipe which i think is the "trick" for making tender, flavorful ribs.

These were easy to make and great to eat!  My husband and 4 year old loved them. I gave it 5 stars because of taste and especially because of the ease of preparation.  I am always looking for easy meals to make in the crock-pot to accomodate a busy schedule and this one will be made again.  I did use "Big Al's KC BBQ sauce" recipe from this website in place of the bbq sauce from this recipe.  It was delicious too.  I had to use St. Louis style ribs because my store was out of baby back ribs.  It worked just fine and was a lot less expensive too.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Loved it.  Of course, like the others substituted the ketchup, plus subbed the chili sauce.  Replaced the ketchup with bbq sauce and the chili sauce with ketchup.  We were all fishing in the cooker for remaining ribs because they were so fantastic!  I used beef ribs.

This was the first time I made ribs in the slow cooker, they were awesome.  I used country style pork ribs,1 cup of bottled bbq sauce 1/2 cup ketchup 1 tbsp.of Worcester sauce and 1 tbsp of brown sugar and i grilled them after I slow cooked them instead of baking them before just to get grill marks on them. these were the best ribs Ive ever made and Ive made lots of ribs.

Oh, my, oh, my was this tasty!  Fight'cha mama good!  I'd say it stood up to the best BBQ joint's ribs.  My modifications (I made a half recipe, as my slow cooker isn't that big):  1 cup BBQ sauce, 1/2 cup ketchup, thyme instead of oregano and chili powder instead of chili sauce (didn't have it...don't really know what it is).  The rest (brown sugar, vinegar, hot sauce, etc.) the same.

Sauce was very good. The only thing I changed was used 1 cup of bbq sauce in place of the chili sauce. Only because I didn't have the chili sauce. I like my sauces thick and this wasn't as thick as it looks in the picture, but the sauce still stayed on the ribs. Will make this again. Thanks!!!!!

My family just loved this recipe.  Like others' suggestions, made my own 2 c. of barbacue sauce + 1/2 c. of commercial source.  Also simmered for 20 minutes with 4-5 cloves of garlic and did add more garlic cloves than suggested by the original recipe + using red wine vinegar in lieu of reg vinegar.  Soooo yummy!

wow!  easy to make, had to make a few alterations to avoid another trip to the grocery.  My husbands first words, after his first bite,"this is a keeper!"  The meat was tender and full of flavor.  The children asked for more.... This recipe is definatley a win.

I made this recipe for 18 people and it turned out flawlessly. It was a bit messy browning all that meat in the oven...but cleaning up the pans long before the meal really minimized the clean up after the meal....just the slow cookers, in fact.  Once the meat is in the slow cooker, the fabulous aroma fills your house for 6-8 hours - your guests will love this. The meat falls right off the bone!

This was such an easy recipe and sooooo good! I will make again and again. The sauce is perfect for many slow cooker items, and I will try with beef and chicken soon. Great for company, fool proof!!

These were SO good. I made these with just a half recipie for two pounds of ribs. I used 1 cup barbeque sauce with just an extra splash of ketchup. Cooked in the slow cooker for 6 hours. My husband loved them and said they were the best ribs he has ever had! I will be making these again for sure.

This was an excellent recipe!  I would have given it 5 stars except I made the alterations suggested by others, mainly substituting my favorite barbecue sauce instead of ketchup.  I also added some crushed garlic to the pot that isn't called for in the recipe.  Lastly, I also made my own Chili sauce rather than using canned sauce, and it made a big difference. Great recipe, it should be made often!

I swapped the ketchup for bbq sauce and seasoned the ribs with salt, pepper and garlic powder when I browned them. I think that it's not the sauce as much as the cooking method that makes these ribs awesome, so I guess if you have a favorite sauce, you could use that. My bf loved them, even the bones were tender. I could hardly get them out of the crock pot they were so juicy and perfect. Great ribs!

***note*** I did NOT use the sauce portion of this recipe (quite frankly, I was feeling lazy) so I just used 2 bottles of BBQ sauce. After the ribs were done in the slow cooker I threw them in a 350 degree oven to harden the glaze on them. The ribs were fabulous and every one loved them!

I used country ribs, 2 tbsp red wine vinegar, substitute 1c catchup with BBQ sauce, reduced chili sauce to 1/2 cup, skip the Worcestershire. Since I used fresh oregano instead of dry, and all I could get from my garden was 2 tsp, I added some thyme as well. I followed the recipe with everything else. The result was OK, a little bit too sweet and spicy for me. Next time I will reduce brown sugar by half and eliminate the hot sauce.

Fabulous base recipe! I used a mixture of barbecue sauces we already had instead of the sauce here. I also only cooked them for about 5 hours, but they were still super tender. I followed another member's suggestion to put them back in the oven for about 20 minutes at the end to caramelize the sauce (worked out well, because that's just how long the twice-baked potatoes needed to heat up!). These don't have the smoky flavor you get from cooking them on the grill with indirect heat, but you can't beat how easy this is and the taste is still good.

These didn't work for us at all. There was a huge pool of grease floating on top of the BBQ sauce that I had to keep spooning off into a coffee can. Once they came out, they still seemed greasy. It seemed like the meat was infused with all that oil. I don't think I'll cook ribs this way ever again.

I did not actually try these but made them for others.  They really liked them but did think they were a little too sweet. I tasted the sauce and agreed. I had never made ribs before and thought that the prep was a as easy and quick as it comes.  Also, the ones that had them did say they were very tender.  I will make them again but omit the sugar.  Thanks!

It's hard to rate this particular recipe because I made it my own by adding lots of different stuff, such as fresh basil leaves, cayenne pepper, ginger, brown sugar, etc.  But it was pretty good in the end!

I had never made ribs before so I made this esxactly to the recepie and decided it was too hot for us and we don't mind food that is reasonably hot.  Good idea that can be adapted to ones own liking.

Oh My God! This was so yummy! the only reason i have given 3 stars instead of 5 is that i think it should be made with BBq sauce not tomato. i followed the recipe exactly and as it was still great i think it'd be 5 star worthy with bbq sauce!

I used a bottle of BBQ sauce to save time.  Excellent.  I also pre-heat the oven to 375 degrees and allow the ribs to "crisp up" for a few minutes prior to serving.

I made these as directed using 'extra hot' Asian chili sauce since the recipe did not specify and woohooo! Spicey!  For the sake of my children I made a second batch of sauce without chili sauce and removed the ribs, shaking off the excess, to the new batch and let them go for another hour.  They were perfect for us and they still had a very nice bite! I recommend you try this recipe making sure you use a sweeter chili sauce if your not wanting the heat!  Thanks.

My whole family said these were the best ribs ever!  I baked them for 30 minutes first.  I put them in the crockpot with KS Masterpiece Hickory Brown Sugar sauce and cooked for 5 hours.  Then baked them again for 15 minutes.  The meat was delicious.

These ribs were phenominal! MY husband is a huge ribs fan and he was blown away by these! They were so easy too! I did alter the recipe a tiny bit- using BBQ and ketchup because I have no idea what chili sauce is supposed to refer to. Any ideas? I would love to try the true recipe!Good luck and enjoy blowing your guests away with your culinary skills!

I rate this a 3 1/2...I really like the cooking technique the slow cooker made the meat very moist & tender. But the sauce wasn't that great this taste so much better when you use BBQ sauce.

My hubby is really picky about ribs, I made a few tweaks to these and he was raving about them, thank you so much! I seasoned the ribs (on one side) with generous sprinklings of salt, pepper, onion powder and garlic powder. Then I baked them at 400 for 15 min. Then turned them over and seasoned the other side. For the sauce I didn't have oregano so I used 1 tsp Italian Herb seasoning, and added 1 tsp Jamaican Jerk, and 1 tsp Cumin, and then added 1/4 cup of A-1 sauce! It made a wonderful taste to the sauce and gave it great depth! After the ribs cooked in the sauce for 7 hours I baked them for 20 min on 350 and they caramelized great! The meat just fell off the bone; these are a new family favorite!

These were a nice change from the usual dinner. I followed advice and used barbecue sauce in place of ketchup, and ketchup in place of chili sauce- though I only used 1/2 cup of ketchup. I skipped the worcestershire, oregano, and browning, and cooked on high for 5 hours. The meat came out of the slow-cooker without the bones! We used the leftovers for pulled sandwiches, and everyone was happy.

Ok...I did this recipe the easy way but it was still awesome. I poured 1/4 bottle of BBQ sauce in the slow cooker, put the ribs in, and than poured in the rest of the BBQ sauce, set it on high(4 hours) It was tender and delicious!

This was delicious! I decreased the vinegar a bit and added 1/4 cup of molasses to make it stickier. This also works incredibly well for pulled pork. Toss a 2 pound pork roast in the crock pot with this sauce and cook on low for 7-8 hours and it shreds beautifully...stays tender when reheated too!

I made this last night and it was quite good. Made the receipe exactly as written except cooked it on high in the crockpot for 4.5 hours.  For sure do as others suggested and cook in the oven for 15 minutes at 400 before serving.  The only general adivce is maybe to buy ribs without the bone?  I used almost 3lbs of Pork ribs on the bone and it only gave us six ribs- not enough meat.  But the sauce was excellent.  thanks

FANTASTIC! I've never made ribs before and thought I'd surprise my husband, who is a huge carnivore! I followed some of the other recommendations...instead of ketchup, I used my favorite BBQ sauce and I cut the brown sugar in half. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. My husband and boys devoured these ribs. He even said they were better than his mother's...WOW! I highly recommend this recipe.

Yummy!  Used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and ketchup instead of chilli sauce, with a little less vinegar.  Added garlic, cuz I do that with everything.

These were very good. I did change the bbq sauce a little, for our own taste: Chopped in 1/2 onion, added more hot sauce, and some mustard. My husband loved it.

I have made these ribs numerous times and each time my family raves about them. I usually add a cup of brown sugar to make the sauce a little sweeter.

These were great.  Very moist and tender.  I added a bit of smoke sauce to the mix and I cooked them on low for the night.  About 12 hours.  Yum.

These turned out absolutely fantastic!!!  They fell off the bone and were so tender.  They just melt in your mouth.  I made this for some family members that were in from out of town and they were all asking me for the recipe.  I will make this one MANY MANY TIMES!

These came out really good.  Tender meat that fell of the bones as they were served up.  I subsituted some BBQ sauce since I didn't have enough chili sauce and it was great.  Also, based on other comments, I baked the ribs for 25 min in the oven to create a nice crust.  Hubby missed the charred bits you get from the grill but still ate them right up.

I gave this 5 stars because my kids really liked it and it was super easy.  The meat was soooo good, but for my husband and I, the sauce was too mild.

I'll definitely be using this recipe again, and will experiment to come up with a sauce that has a little more kick.

I loved the method of this recipe - the meat fell off the bone, it was so tender. I can't give it a higher rating only because I replaced the flavor ingredients with those from the "Maple Glazed Ribs" recipe - just threw them into the slow cooker with the baby backs, and it came out wonderfully! *So* yummy.

Awesome recipe, my husband thinks I am even more of a genius in the kitchen as a result of this recipe. I read the reviews and changed the ingredients based off of some of their reccomendations...I did the 2 cups of BBQ sauce and 1c.Ketchup and 2 1/2 t. of vinegar.
Fabulous recipe.

These were falling off the bone excellent.  I also used 1C ketchup and 1C chili sauce and 1C of Stubbs BBQ sauce.  The rest of the recipe I followed exactly.  I like things a little spicier, but was serving to some who do not.  I will try to spice it up next time with a habenero and less sugar.

These were very strange.  I followed the recipe exactly and we just didn't really like the flavor.  It is true that they are very tender, though -- but is it possible to be too tender?  I had them in the slow cooker on medium for 5 hours.  My husband picked the first one up to eat it and all the meat fell right off the bone, tumbled down his shirt, and into his lap!

Loved these ribs. Fall off the bone, finger licking, can't wait for more, ribs.  Thanks for a great recipe. Although, I have made it twice now and the second time using Kathy's Award Winning Barbeque Sauce from this site, and I liked it even more, if that was possible.

Loved them.  Added a little more spice to it just cause we like it hotter.  I started mine early in the day and they were ready in probably 4.5 hours and I did 6.5 lbs of ribs.  This is a keeper.  Very easy and we all loved it!

This is a great recipe. My husband can't get me to cook them enough. I don't eat ribs so I just put chicken breasts in about half way through for me. I did make a few changes. I used half ketchup/BBQ sauce and no chili sauce. But I do add a lot of hot sauce. He loves spicy food. I also put garlic in it. Yummy!!

Excellent!  I have made this recipe many times and it's always a hit.  For parties, I use a pork roast instead with the sauce in the crockpot and serve with rolls so guests can make little sandwiches. I've found a little chopped garlic goes well (if you like garlic). People always ask for this recipe!

It was really good, I also did one cup ketchup and 1 cup of barbecue sauce, it was fall off the bone and it was very messy. It was a spicy sauce (liked that), the only thing I did bad on my part was not cover the ribs entirely with sauce so the top was kind of dry but i'm new at cooking. Anyway I like my ribs a little more then they stay on the bone. But I would probably make again

These were good ribs, but not too different than any other rib recipe.  I prefer country style ribs but these were indeed tender so overall, good recipe.

Fantastic recipe! I added some liquid smoke as I like a smokey flavour & used chili paste instead of chili sauce. The meat was so tender & yummy. Will be making this again for sure.

Wonderful!  Why didn't I find this recipe sooner?  Like others I used a katsup/BBQ sauce mix, and used thai sweet chili sauce I had picked up in an oriental market.  I used a tablespoon or so of molases in place of brown sugar, since I was out.  After 9 1/2 hours on low the ribs were fall off the bone delish!  This would be wonderful for football Sundays!  Thanks for sharing.

This is the best Rib recipe I have ever tried. It has become a staple in our dinner selection. My boyfriend requests this all the time. I like to serve it with cornbread and honey butter. Thanks so much for submitting this.

If i could give this recipe more stars i would have... It is so yummy~ the meat is falling off teh bone. I took some suggestions from others and cut back on teh ketchup. We used a mixture of BBq, chili sauce and ketchup. I used chipolti BBQ sauce t add a little kick... Awesome. It has become the ONLY way to cook ribs at our house. The crockpot makes it yummy and for easy clean up.

My family really liked these ribs, great way to have ribs in the winter.  Like others though I made changes!  I didn't use the chili sauce, cut the ketchup, added BBQ sauce, used apple cider vinegar instead of regular vinegar.  Then I had too many ribs for the slow cooker for this, so I put them in a large roaster in the oven at 250 degrees F, let them cook approx 8 hours.  They were wonderful, fell off the bone!

These were outstanding. Be sure to buy good-quality ribs. I followed the advice of previous reviewers and used some BBQ sauce in place of the chili sauce, reduced the ketchup and vinegar and cut out the oregano. I'll definitely make these again.

Wonderful!  So Easy!  This was my first time making ribs and I thought I would try the easiest recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I did substitute 1 cup of BBQ sauce for 1 cup of the ketchup.  Put them in at 7:15am for 8 hours on low.  They were ready at 3:15, though I kept them on low until 6:30, when my boyfriend came over.  I put them on a baking sheet and  broiled for about 3 minutes.  I served them with oven roasted potatoes!  I will make these again!!!!!  Yum!!!!

Made for Sunday dinner and received great reviews by family.  As suggested by others, I only used 1 c. ketchup and our favorite bbq sauce (KC Masterpiece of course!).  My 15 year son, who is a connoisseur of ribs, thought they were incredible.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This was a wonderful recipe.  I also, used only 1 cup of ketchup.  I used a pork roast instead of the ribs.  I shredded the meat after is was done and put it back in the crockpot.  I mixed the meat and the sauce well.  I then served it on buns...............it was mouth wateringly delish!!!!!!!  The whole family and guests LOVED it!!!!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

The method for cooking the ribs is really nice. I used spareribs, but other than that I used the recipe as written, including the sauce. Which I thought was too ketchup-y for my taste, but it was a barbecue sauce. I think turning the ribs once or twice would have been helpful, as a few bites of the "surface" pieces were a little dried out. If I make this again I will cut out the recipe's sauce and just use bottled. Thanks for sharing!

Fallin' off the bone, finger lickin' good...I substituted BBQ sauce for the ketchup as well, chose apple cider vinegar over white vinegar and used chili powder instead of the chili sauce.  I cut a meduim sweet onion into chunks and put them in the crock-pot first.  Since I have a smaller crock-pot, I cut my ribs into sections 2 or 3 ribs long.  This helped the ribs cook much faster.  1 hour on High, then turned down to Low, and my ribs were done in under 4 hours.

These had a somewhat sour taste. Maybe it was the chili sauce.

Although I read almost all of the reviews, I decided tp follow the recipe as written and not sub the ketchup & chili sauce for BBQ sauce. I cooked mine in the slow cooker for 6 hours but then kept it warm for an addtl 3 hours. I used apple cider vinegar and added dry mustard and liquid smoke to my sauce.  At the end of the 6 hours I started getting worried that it may taste a little too ketchupy so I added a 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce to my crock pot.  These ribs were amazing -- so tender, fell right off the bone and the sauce had a nice little zip to it. Everyone loved it and asked for seconds.

Used Kraft barbecue sauce, skipped the oven and placed boneless beef ribs in the slow cooker on low for 6.5 hours. What could be easier? Yum!

I used a bottle and a half of "Kraft Honey" barbeque sauce in place of the ketchup/chili sauce, added more hot sauce than called for and only cooked about 2 lbs of ribs. They were really great, very flavorful and falling off the bone tender. I'd make them again. Thanks!

This recipe was great and so easy.  I used boneless ribs and they came out soooo tender.  I also used the suggestion of using 1 cup ketchup and 1 cup BBQ sauce.  Another recipe to add to my husband's favorites!

These are EXCELENT!!!  So easy to make and so delicious to eat.  I rubbed my ribs with salt, pepper and garlic powder, used 1/2 ketchup, 1/2 hickory smoked BBQ sauce, and added about a tablespoon of minced garlic to the sauce.  The meat fell right off the bone.  My mother is dying to get this recipie!! A keeper!!!

These were the best ribs I have ever had!  The only alterations I made were adding 1 cup of ketchup instead of 2, adding 1 cup of bbq sauce and omitting chili sauce.  The whole family devoured them.  It's a keeper!

Kudoes for this recipe from a southern ribs lover. I made several changes, ie: using a seasoning rub, browning them on the grill, no oregano. I have several other variations in mind, I will definitely make this recipe again.

Excellent Recipe!!!  I skipped the ketchup and used bbq sauce, added garlic, onions, and honey.  Better than the best restaurant ribs I've had.  Try them, you'll make them over and over again.

These ribs were awesome! I followed the recipe but made the following changes and they turned out great: used BBQ sauce for 1/2 the ketchup; added 1 t. garlic salt; used 1/2 red wine vinegar and 1/2 white vinegar; added 1 t. liquid smoke. Try it...you'll like it!

OHHHHH MAN! These ribs are excellent!  They're so tender and flavorful!  I had books to read for a summer Advanced Placement class, but I really wanted to make something for my Dad for Father's Day, so I threw this together and then read my book all day.  It definitely was convenient.  I took the advice of the other reviewers and put in barbeque sauce and ketchup.  I had to water down the ketchup because I didn't have enough, but they were still really good.  I also put in a pinch of chili powder instead of the hot sauce because I didn't have any, and it was really spicy and good.  I highly recommend this recipe to everyone!  Thanks Suzanne!

Excellent!!  The meat was falling off the bone.  Use a good cut of meat one that is not fatty.  It makes a difference.  Will make this over and over.  Thank you.

This is really good.  Had all of the ingredients on hand. Super easy. Definitely brown the ribs in the oven before putting them in the slow cooker. I cut mine into small sections so that everyone could take as many or few as they wanted. Will definitely be making these again (still have some ribs left, since they were on sale a few weeks ago). I made directly as  written. If you aren't following the recipe, don't submit a review.
I did find out this evening that putting them in the oven at 375° for about 15 minutes after cooking in the slow cooker to carmelize them works really well. They're still tender and really tasty. Just make sure that they're covered in sauce on a sheet sprayed with cooking spray. By the way, I really don't like most bbq sauces, but I do like this mix. The last time I made this I used boneless ribs (seared in a cast iron skillet for a few seconds) and added a little minced garlic to the sauce and it came out really well. Just made it again and we still love it!

Awesome and easy, I cut 1 rack in half, rubbed in garlic salt, and pepper, placed in the slow cooker, poured half bottle of bbq sauce and let cook on low for 10 hrs. Pulled them out after 10 hrs placed on baking sheet, painted on more bbq sauce and placed in the oven for 30 minutes at 400 degrees. Soooo good, soooo tender, soooo easy. I will be doing this again.

This is a great way to make baby back ribs. I added a dry rub on the ribs, the sauce is fantastic. Easy to throw together on those busy days.

This was a great recipe, but like most of the reviewers before me, I made a couple of modifications. I used barbecue sauce as opposed to ketchup. I also turned my slow cooker on high and set the lid ajar for the last 30 minutes of cooking time, as suggested by another reviewer. This helped the sauce to thicken. My family loved the recipe, and my son declared this to be a "do-over".

Followed the recipe exactly how it was written and my ribs were ohhhh sooo amazing. Instead of cooking mine in a slow cooker (crockpot) I used a Dutch oven (which is a ceramic deep pot). The cook time on a Dutch oven is less than a slow cooker. If you are using a Dutch oven you need to put the temp on 250 for 2.5 to 3 hours. These ribs were to die for and I made mine extra spicy. My husband and I loved them. Super easy recipe.

Made this and it was good but...
The sauce is a tomatoey base flavor due to the 2 cups of Catsup.
It might have been better if I used a better quality chili sauce and hot sauce. 
Even my wife said she would have preferred the  tangy smoke bbq style better. I put liquid smoke in it but id didn't seem to help much. The oregano added a lot.
The other problem was that  the sauce became extremely soupy due to the rib juices collecting with sauce in bottom of crockpot.
It was good though even still.

The important part of this recipe was the initial browning in the oven.  It rendered a lot of the fat.  I also tried this with regular spareribs.  Not a good idea.  Too much fat and it becomes a soupy mess.  Stick with the baby backs.

This was a great recipe.  When I make it again, I will make the sauce a day or two ahead of time so the flavors have a chance to blend because we had leftovers two days later and  the sauce was much tastier than the first day.  I will also cook the ribs in the slow cooker 9-10 hours instead of the suggested time...it wasn't long enough for my cooker and they were slightly chewy, not falling off the bone tender.  Otherwise, an easy and yummy recipe.  Thank you.

Absolutely amazing! I followed the recommendations of others and substituted BBQ sauce (sweet baby rays) for the ketchup and chili sauce. It gave the sauce an extra kick! Slow cooked them in a crockpot for 4 hours on high then turned them down to warm so the sauce could  thicken up. I'm adding this to my dinner rotation for sure!

Didn't care for the sauce, too ketchup-y (it did taste better the next day). BUT loved this method of cooking ribs!  Just pour your favorite  bbq sauce on ribs. They are fall off the bone tender.

The barbecue ribs are amazing . This recipe became my kids favorite ever. They do take a long time, but the wait is totally worth it. I just prepare it the night before and turn the crock pot on the next day, go to work come home and the ribs are done. So easy!!

Easy, delicious and a pleasure to serve up. A bit time-consuming to prep, but if you put the ribs in the oven and make the sauce while they're baking, it's all done and then you can sit and relax! I found that with our slow-cooker, it  took  six hours and was perfect.

I love this recipe. It is my go to recipe for ribs. I use beef ribs because we are kosher, and I add a dash of liquid smoke which kicks up the BBQ taste. Always a crowd pleaser

I used bottled BBQ sauce rather than the sauce ingredients in the recipe.  I think the initial oven step is key -- gets rid of a lot of grease, and gives some very important browned flavor.  This method will be used again and again at my house!!

I've made this twice and both times it was very well received.  The last time I prepared it was for a potluck BBQ event of over 20 people.  The ribs were gone well before any thing else and more were requested.  My husband, toddler, and 9 year old love this recipe and are looking forward to be able to enjoy it during the Fall and Winter season instead of having to grill outside.

I don't like BBQ sauce so I make my own honey garlic sauce to go with it instead. Cooking ribs like this puts a literal meaning to 'fall off the bone'. As it pretty much de-bones the meat on its own.

A great start to tasty ribs!  The recipe for the sauce is a great base.  We tend to like spicier, more robust sauces, so I added a few ingredients... 2 tsp chopped garlic, black pepper and paprika, dried pequin peppers, a little liquid smoke and lots of Franks hot sauce.  Turned out fabulous!

I use a basic recipe like this with shortcuts.  I buy ribs with the rub already on it and use Sweet Baby Rays BBQ saucer.  To avoid having to put them in the oven before putting in crockpot, I simply roll up balls of aluminum foil under the ribs to keep them out of the grease.  I cut the ribs into two ribs each and then pyramid them with a slather of BBQ sauce on top of each one.  Easy and the family loves it.  Doesn't heat up my kitchen either!

I've  made this exactly as written, and also with our favorite bbq sauce, and I'm not a fan of this sauce recipe. So I always use our own sauce, but the ribs themselves always come out perfect! I can barely get them out of the slow cooker without falling off the bone. Whole family loves them.

I have made this recipe several times but use a favorite bottled sauce. You can take them out of the slow cooker and finish them on the grill.  The ribs are good either way and is nice if you want ribs in the winter.

I started these last night and let them cook overnight. What can I say but, DELICIOUS!!! The sauce was just wonderful the way the recipe was written. I'm going to make just the sauce to store in the refrigerator to have on hand for other meat, and even vegetable dishes. I bet a little warm sauce on a baked potato would be great. Thank you for sharing this great easy recipe with us!!

I have made this several times including the original recipe.  The crucial ingredient to this recipe is what type of chili sauce you use.  I have used a siracha chili sauce (only half a cup) and that was awesome. I have used a banana pepper chili sauce, also tried the Heinz chili sauce. I chopped up fresh onions and garlic and mixed in with sauce before adding to the meat. I only slow-cooked for 5  hours & then caramelized in the oven for about 20 minutes.

Nice, easy recipe. I cooked the ribs for 7hrs, until the ribs fell off the bone. I also did not use chili powder & chili sauce as I did not want too much spicy hot going on. Next time I think I would also use a bit less oregano, too.

Very tasty...sauce is nice and loose. The original receipe is a little spicy for small children so I added an additional 1/4 cup of brown sugar to level it out.

I used Siriachi Chili Sauce and eliminated the brown sugar. This created a spicier sauce that is less sweet. This is one of the best recipes we use regularly.

DELICIOUS!!!I boiled the ribs in water for 15 minutes then I broiled them in the oven till they changed color then put them in the crock pot with ingr. from the recipe, I only had hot chili sauce so I put one tsp instead of a cup then added some b.b.q. sauce, mustard and a splash of smoke and of course some garlic. They were the best ribs we've ever tasted.

I made 5 racks of baby backs in two crock pots today. Everyone raved about them. I didn't use the sauce recipe, no, I used MUMBO SAUCE! google it. We live outside Chicago and this sauce comes from an old local company. Back off DC!! I took the time to roast them in the oven, then packed them with sauce in the crock pots and put them in the fridge overnight. I cooked them 7 hours in the crock pot on low. Then, I bathed them in more Mumbo and caramelized it over a hot charcoal grill. That really made them perfect. We ate all of the ribs and I converted all our guests to MUMBO!

Ribs have always been a challenge for me. Wasn't sure how to prepare them without them getting tough.   This recipe solved that problem & I Love love love this sauce! This method leaves the meat tender and falling off the bone.

Restaurant ribs. Husband could not stop raving about it. Super tender and moist. I did as other reviews suggested, I first sasoned ribs with salt and pepper. I added chopped garlic to water and boiled the ribs for 20 minutes. This removes some of the fat and liquid from the meat. I replaced the chili sauce with a bbq sauce I had on hand. Finally, I put the ribs under the broiler with additional sauce basted on the surface to get a beautiful caramelization. Excellent results!!

I would like to add one suggestion, score backside of ribs with a sharp knife, then rip off the tough membrane - thus ensuring a truly tender chew experience. Works like a charm.

What a great way to do ribs.  Truly, falling off the bone tender. I even went a step easier by using my favorite commercial BBQ sauce and they came out great. No more messy grills. In fact, almost no mess at all.

Like almost everyone else I subed bbq sauce for the ketchup.  Put 2 small bowls in the crock to avoid the ribs sitting in too much liquid.  Fall off the bone tender and delicious!

I  am not a cook by any means, but I made these yesterday exactly as the recipe says and they were fantastic!  After seeing all the comments with everyone making their own changes/substitutions, I wanted to see what the ribs were like if prepared exactly as Suzanne suggested. They fell right off the bone and the flavor was great!  Thanks Suzanne!

I agree with previous ratings... the best part of this recipe is the baking in the oven part.  I did that and then used my own BBQ recipe and they were tender, juicy, falling off the bone and yum yum yum!

I liked baking the ribs first. Make sure u dry the ribs with a paper towel before u salt and pepper or they will not brown.  I used 1 bottle of Diana rib and chicken BBQ sauce plus 1 bottle Diana maple BBQ sauce for the sauce. I also cut up the ribs after baling before they went in the slow cooker.  Delicious!!!

These ribs were fall off the bone and so flavorful that my hubby said, these were the best ever.  I only had 2# of baby back ribs so I cut the recipe for the sauce in half.  My only change was to reverse the amount of ketchup with chili.  I cooked all day on low and they were so good!

Meat was very tender, but the sauce tasted sort of ketchup-y and it had at weird, tangy taste. However, it was still OK if you're really into rib.s

I had tried to make ribs years ago and they were not good.  I had all but given up until I saw this in your magazine.  This is a great recipe!  I used my favorite bottled sauce, but will be trying to make my own next time.  My husband loved these!!

I halved the recipe, since it was only a meal for 2 (ribs are expensive!). Instead of ketchup I used BBQ sauce as suggested. After 6 hours, sauced the top again (for fear of drying out). Turned out amazing! It was also my first time using my slow cooker (I got for Christmas). Also my first time cooking ribs. The meat just fell off the bone, no piece of meat was left out. Haha! I love this so much! Better than most restaurants! :) Thank you!

I love this recipe just the way it stands. To me there is nothing worse than bottled BBQ sauce. This recipe reminds me of how Mom used to make ribs. Try it you'll like it!

I guess I should have known, but I wasn't expecting the meat to literally fall off the bone!

The flavor was good (substituted half the ketchup with homemade barbeque sauce), but the meat turned into something akin to shreaded meat pulled off the bone.

One of the most delicious ways of preparing BBQ ribs. This is my go-to recipe as I think it's better than using an actual grill... Which could be bias due to my own laziness, but grilling in Colorado winters and summers are not my ideas of fun.

This was good-I think Ribs in the oven/grill are still better, but this was 4 stars for how easy!  But agreed-don't use that much ketchup, and substitute some of it with BBQ sauce.

Holy moly these were great! I used bottled sauce, and my crock pot runs hot, so 2 racks of ribs were done in 5 hours. I have never made ribs before thinking they were too complicated, but this recipe changed my mind. I will definitely do these again!

We've always had trouble doing BBQ ribs on our charcoal BBQ, probably because of trying to keep a consistent low temperature needed for the longer cooking time needed for ribs. My husband was keen to try this recipe when I gave it to him and it turned out great! The sauce wasn't too sweet, in fact he could have put in a little more hot sauce. This will definitely be a go to recipe anytime of the year.

Made these ribs for family and visiting niece.  They tasted wonderful and everyone loved them.  Normally grill ribs and these were just as good.  Was quick and easy, so I could spend more time visiting.

This is a great recipe, even using St. Louis spare ribs that I bought for less than $10. I added applewood seasoning as a rub, a hearty splash of apple cider vinegar, honey, minced fresh garlic, and some extra tenderizing Worcestershire sauce. Off the chain! The meat was very flavorful and so tender it was falling apart. I'll definitely be using this cooking method as a base to make ribs more often. Thanks for sharing! :o)

these are so good.  I've made them several times now.  I use my own sauce and never feel the need to finish them on the grill or broiler as the meat really soaks up the sauce flavor while cooking.  This cooking method is excellent for fall off the bone tender ribs.

I wasn't impressed with the sauce but the technique of roasting and then the slow cooker was great.  I will use this going forward.  I tossed the ribs on the grill and brushed with bbq sauce at the end.

These were over the top amazing! I used the instructions to bake first-these were really thick, so I put them in oven for 20 min. on one side then 15 min. on other. Lots of fat came off-then (hate to admit this), I used Sylvia's recipe for the sauce as did previous reviewers. My husband is the pickiest eater I have ever met. He was griping as he saw me putting this together-because nothing beats his "sweet baby Rays" barbecue sauce. He was blown away during the super bowl. Everyone LOVED them! Today I just put them in the slow cooker for company tonite-my husband's suggestion. :)

Did NOT care for this recipe, the sauce was horrible tasted more like ketchup.  And as for the ribs, yes they were very tender but felt like all the rib flavor had been cooked out of them.  Much better on the grill for full flavor!!

Very happy with the results! Followed suggestions to use 2 cups BBQ sauce and 1 cup of ketchup, would probably reduce amts bkz there was plenty of leftover sauce. Flavorful w/o being spicy. 2nd TIME: Just 1/2 the sauce otherwise it's too soupy. Did the pre-bake to reduce fat & slow-cooked for 4 hrs. Took the slow-cooker inside crock and put in oven at 350 for 15 minutes to get a browned top on ribs.

Finger licking good. The sauce turned out to be a delicious BBQ sauce. I doubled the require ingredients for the sauce. I slow cooked the loin back ribs for ten hours. The family devoured the ribs.

I usually read the reviews before I make a recipe from here and incorporate some of the alterations people suggest. However this time my boyfriend was doing the cooking and he followed the recipe exactly. I was worried because of what people said about the ketchup flavour but that didn't happen. The secret? Use a real chili sauce not the Heinz generic kind. We used a sweet Thai chili sauce and the finished product was all kinds of nom.

I used the this recipe for the cooking instructions (the baking first, then the slow cooker for 6 hours). But I made my own sauce since everyone seemed to dislike the one in the recipe. I smothered the ribs in it once they were placed in the slow cooker. I flipped the ribs half way too. They were outstanding! Fall off the bone! I served then with roasted red skin potatoes too. YUMMY!

I have never cooked ribs before, so I was more than afraid of screwing this up! I went with some of the other suggestions, I used regular bbq sauce.  It was fantastic! My family raved and I was so happy with how it turned out!  I followed the recipe (with the exception of the sauce) but I also put the ribs back in the oven at 400 degrees for 30 minutes for a crispy crust. Awesome!  I will definitely make this again!

Great ribs! I used the advice of others and only did 1 cup of ketchup and 1 cup of bbq sauce. I also added a pinch of chipotle chili pepper seasoning for some added heat. I would put less brown sugar in next time as I used a Sweet Thai Chili Sauce. But maybe if you used another type of chili sauce it would be less sweet? Thanks for the recipe - great for when there's snow outside and you can't use the BBQ!

I was very happy with how the ribs turned out, so tender that the meat fell off the bone, but was not thrilled with the sauce. I was told by my family that the next time I make this, to use a barbecue sauce instead of the ketchup.  The recipe should just be labeled Slow Cooker Ribs with a tomato sauce.  :-)

I use this recipe as a base for my slow cooker ribs with less of the tomato sauce and more worcestershire sauce, plus a bit more hot sauce and some garlic (I guess seasoning with Garlic salt may also do the same thing). Leaving the lid off for 1/2 hour at the finish thickens the sauce up which is nice. Too tomatoey and sweet for me as it is so cant vote 5 stars, but a very good base to start with and experiment from.

Love the recipe, was a total hit with the family especially with one son who very picky with what he will eat.  Was asked how soon I would make it again, my oldest son said it was perfect the way it was as I had added 4 dashes of hot sauce.  I love how I throw it in the slow cooker after the short time in the oven while I'm at work. No grilling during this severe heat wave!  Great recipe!

FABULOUS is all I can say.  My parents and inlaws did not come up for air when I served this - absolutely amazing.  What I did add was a mesquite rub before I baked it in the overn - that added a nice kick.  I also changed the ketchup to 1 1/2 cups and increased the chili sauce to 1 1/2 cups.  I also added a cup of root beer (yup root beer) when it was in the cooker.  It was fall off the bone fabulous!

Quick and easy. I borrowed crock pots, and did 4x the recipe. The overall response was "It's OK, your other recipe is better". Then again I got the same responce on some ribs I brought back from the best ribs you can get in KC, and I stood in line for about a half hour for them.

These were the best ribs I ever had.  The only change I made was I only had 1/2 cup of ketchup so I added a 1/2 cup of sweet baby rays sauce.  I will make this over and over again!

I used the recipe's version of BBQ sauce. Also tucked in some chicken tenders around the edges.
At the end I baked them in the oven with store bought BBQ sauce because the stuff in the crock pot was too thin.  Next time I will tuck them under the broiler....... My husbands said they were good last night but even better today reheated for lunch. Served with brown rice.

The sauce was too tangy for OUR taste buds and kind of runny! The recipe was easy to follow. I just have to find a different way to add more of a sweet n spicy sauce.

Like others, I heavily modified the sauce for this recipe, but I gave it three stars because the slow cooker and precook instructions made them taste fantastic.  I could barely keep the bones on the meat.  I'll be using this cooking style from here on out, but I'll be using my own sauce.

The ribs were super tender and this is a great recipe....I didn't know what type of chili sauce so I used literally chili sauce without beans...not the one with chili peppers in it.  Turned out great.

This was very good, although I would use my own BBQ sauce in the future.  The ribs were very tender.  I do like them on the grill more, but for easy tender ribs, this is the way to go.

Awesome way to get a lower sodium option for bar-b-que ribs.  The meat just fell off the bone and that is never bad.

Spicy! I used Cider Vinegar as my vinegar and also added about a tablespoon of honey. Also used half ketchup half bbq sauce. Took only 5 hours as I was only cooking one rack that was around 2.5 lbs. Very tender and fell of the bone.

Great recipe! I did make a couple of minor changes. The amount of ketchup and a few mentions of the "too much ketchup taste" comments had me a bit concerned so I cut the ketchup back by a half of cup and added a bit more chili sauce. I also minced a small onion and added a bit more Worcestershire sauce. I was going to add some mesquite spice but forgot and the next time I try this recipe I will try that also. The few changes I made I feel made it a 5 star meal. The meat was super tender and fell off the bone. My wife was very impresses as well.

Following this  recipe will result in the BEST reibs that you have ever eaten.  This recipe is almost perfect as written. My only change was to use a commercial (McCormick's) Dry seasoning rub before placing in the 400 degree oven .

This recipe was great.  Made it last weekend and I'm going to make it tomorrow night again.  As others suggested, I used 3/4 BBQ sauce *jack daniels* and 1/4 ketchup.  Also I unfortunately was out of worcester sauce so I substituted soy sauce.  The BBQ sauce turned out wonderful.  Also, instead of cooking for 15 minutes on each side at 400, I broiled on high for about 10 minutes on each side.  It gave the ribs the slightly charred texture on the outside, while leaving everything extremely moist on the inside.

great, great, great, great, great!  this was my first time cooking ribs and they came out, well, great!  i followed other suggestions and used 2 cups BBQ sauce, 1 cup chili sauce, a whole lot of tabasco, and added a tsp of black pepper, and a good shot of Frank's Red Hot sauce for a little more tang---they were a smash hit;  the meat fell off the bone, and was terrific for sandwiches for the rest of the week (altho the sauce is hard to get out of my husband's work shirts!!)---thank you so much!

This is an awsome recipe. I made this, this past weekend for company and it went over like nothing before. The only thing is this does not serve 8. I,m glad I had another meat because it would not have been enough. I had six adults. The change I made reading other reviews was to change the ketchup for two cups of barbecue sauce. The meal was sooooooo tasty and simple. It was done in four hours, falling off the bone. This is a keeper. Thanks.

Made this pretty much as is written except I substitued one cup good quality bar-b-q sauce for the ketchup.   At the end, the sauce was pretty watery so I took about 2 cups out, degreased it and put it in a saucepan on the stove and boiled it for about 10-15 minutes until it was thickened.  Served it with the ribs and it was AWEWSOME!  Might try putting a smidge of liquid smoke in next time, to get a little bit of the smoke flavor you'd get if you used the grill.  Otherwise, it was a huge hit!

I just made these for a family party and they were awesome.  The only change I did was I used 1/2 cp of chili sauce and 1/2 cp duck sauce and took someones advice and cut the vinegar in half.  Everyone asked me for the recipe.

I like getting rid of the fat by baking first.  But I wasn't impressed with the sauce.  Alot like ketchup. But I would try again, just tweek the spices to my families taste.

The only significant change I made was using barbecue sauce instead of ketchup as suggested by many others.  I also used my own home canned chili sauce.  My husband has had problems chewing all the other "tough" ribs I have made over the past 36 years.  Not these!!! I will definitely use the slow cooker to make these again and again.  He is still raving about them. Thank you Suzanne!

This was fantastic!  My grocery store had spare ribs on sale so I used those, I also used one cup ketchup and one cup Masterpiece Kansas City Original BBQ Sauce instead of 2 cups ketchup! This recipe is going in my "favorites" cookbook!  The ribs were so tender and the sauce turned out sweet and tangy.

Very good!  I could not find pork baby back ribs so I used Western Style ribs and they were great!  I also used Bull's Eye BBQ (original) sauce.  My only suggestion would be to not overcook.  I read somewhere if the meat pulls completely off the bone, it is over cooked,  Great recipe!

prepared ribs as recipe stated with the exception that I rubbed them with spicy yellow mustard and New Orleans cajan seasoning (by Weber) and a little natures seasoning on the meaty side. Placed in the oven as directed for 15 minutes each side. When they where done I poured Becks beer around them and covered with tin foil until ready to put them in the crock pot.  I went on to make the sauce I used 1 1/2 c Sweet Baby Rays, 1/2 c ketchup, 1 c chili sauce 1/4 c brown sugar not packed just eye balled 2 t oregano, 2 t worshishire sauce, 2 dashes hot sauce 1 big dash liquid smoke.  Sauce Tastes GREAT!

These ribs were amazing! I didn't change a thing...and it certainly did NOT taste just like ketchup! My boyfriend absolutely loved these. Every time he took a bite he said "mmmmm hunny!" He also claimed that they are better than any high end restaurant ribs! I have never had such mild tasting fall off the bone ribs before. Thanks for the great recipe!!!!! Will be making these for a 2nd time this week!

Works great! I did use a bottled BBQ sauce instead - it's just easier! My ribs didn't fit all the way down in the slow cooker, which I think was fortuitous, because they got a drier "finish" to them.

The ribs were tender but the sauce was way to much like dumping ketchup on them.  I followed the recipe not the reviewers changes.  I don't like to change the recipe and then review it that just isn't being fair to the recipe.  I will make them again but this time I will make the changes and hope for the best.

My husband said that this was the best BBQ sauce he had ever had! It didn't become runny like other BBQ's - it held it's consistency very well and stayed in GLAZE mode.

Excellent! I made these for New Years dinner and everyone raved at how tender and mosit the meat was I will always crock pot my ribs from this day forward.  I used country style browned them in the oven 15-20 mins, cooked them 5 hours in crock and then transfered them to the grill for carmelization (they were nearly too tender for the grill my husband complained).  I cooked so much everyone took some home

Pre-cooking the ribs was good. We used this Bar-B-Que sauce instead of the sauce listed in this recipe. Turned out well. Good basic recipe.

These were awsome!  Hubby cooked these tonight.  Folowed the recipe as written and we were very pleased with the outcome.  We had a heck of a time getting them plated because the meat kept falling away from the bones, they were so tender.  The sauce was delicious too.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.

I used the half bbq & half ketchup for sauce like others suggested. The flavor was delicious but somewhere along the recipe my ribs were tender but dry on inside. (i used 2lbs boneless ribs) I will try again for sure.  Thanks for sharing

I have been messing with ribs recipes for years -- looking for the perfect recipe. I especially need one for the winter -- when grilling outside is not my thing, but I am still hungry for ribs. This one turned out perfectly AND it was SO easy. I prepped the ribs in the morning and put them in the crockpot; by the time we were home for dinner the house smelled great (even my kids commented) and the ribs were fall-off-the-bone perfect! I did use my own rib sauce instead of the recipe's sauce, but that was the only change I made. Thanks for sharing a fantastic way to prepare ribs (I may even incorporate in the summer with the gilling).

These are the best ever!! I haven't done ribs a lot because I find them annoying and a lot of work. This recipe is soooo easy and my hubby has asked for them twice a week since I first made them. Everyone that has tried them takes home the recipe! The sauce is awesome on chicken too! Thanks Suzanne2802.

I tried this receipe for the first time a couple weeks ago when I was having all of my family over to celebrate my husband's birthday.  OMG....my family went nuts over it.  I took tips from a couple other reviewers that suggested to cook them no longer than 6 hours.  They were starting to fall off the bone.  And I also took the suggestion about cooking them in the oven for a few minutes afterwards to help the sauce to stick.  Instead of using ketchup, I replaced it with Kraft Honey Smoked BBQ sauce.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Tweaked the sauce by adding BBQ sauce. Only cooked for 6 hours in slow cooker but it was still fall off the bone. Carmalized in oven for 10 minutes. Very yummy. Will definitely make again. Thank you for sharing.

This was so wonderfully tasting!!  The changes I made that were suggested by others is instead of 2 cups of ketchup, I used 2 cups of Baby Rays BBQ sauce, and instead of 1 cup of chili sauce, I used 1 cup of ketchup.  I think next time I make I am going to use a little less ketchup though but overall these were so awesome!  Served with cole slaw, baked beans and hush puppies.

I, too, changed the sauce by using 2 cups bbq sauce and 1 cup catsup along with the rest of the ingredients. It was a little bland, but that's probably my fault for not using the chili sauce. The cooking instructions for these ribs work like a charm, but I did save some of the sauce and baked the ribs with a little fresh sauce in a 375 oven for 20 minutes to thicken after removing from the slow cooker. The rack of ribs in the bottom of my pot literally fell apart, the top rack stayed together and was so very tender. This recipe is a keeper!

I layered the ribs and poured sauce over each layer.  When they were done, some of the sauce slid off and the ones in the bottom were falling apart.  I took another persons advise and put on a shallow pan and broiled in the oven for a few minutes and also spooned some of the sauce over before doing this.  They were wonderful and one of the best things was that there was no "indigestion" afterward--a real plus!  I had 6 people for dinner and everyone loved them.  Not sure I would slow cook them again but instead slow cook in the oven basting frequently.

These were really good! I seasoned the ribs with sea salt, pepper, oregano, paprika & garlic powder. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce, as I was out of chili sauce(everything else as written). When the ribs were done, the sauce was really thin, so I put the ribs on a foil covered cookie sheet, topped with Sweet Baby Ray's & broiled until sauce was bubbly. This isn't a recipe I'd fix often, but thoroughly enjoy when I do:) Thanks for sharing!

This was my first attempt to ribs and it was amazingly good and tasty. I made some modification as other reviewer suggested but kept the ketchup. I used 2C of ketchup, 1 cup of bbq sauce (molasse based) no chilli sauce, used red wine vinegar and fresh oregano. After about 7hours of slow cooking, as other said, the sauce is very liquid so I placed the rib on a cookie plate and added some "fresh" sauce over it (the recipes have way more sauce then you need) and in the oven for 20-25 minutes to get a caramelized coating.  This was more then good, I will re-do it again for sure. It beat all rib i've eaten in restaurant.  4 stars because, as other said, I modified the recipes a little bit but kept most of it as-is.  You have to try this! I'm not a slow cooker lover but this is the way to go for tender rib that litteraly melt in your mouth.  Thanks for sharing this with us! :)

Fantastic recipe!  Here are a few changes I made... Instead of 2 cups ketchup, I used 1 cup ketchup and 1 cup bbq sauce.  Instead of 1 cup chili sauce, I used 1/2 cup chili sauce and 1/2 cup white wine.  These ribs can be marinated over night and done on the grill as well!

Sensational! The temperature outside is just above freezing a perfect recipe for a cosy night at home.  Made as listed with even my husband who is not usually in favour of very tasty food forcing himself not to lick his plate after two servings.  A winner! Thank you. Carol

YUM!  These are succulent!  The sauce is delicious and the oregano is awesome in this.  After 6 hours in the slow cooker, the meat fell off the bones and was tender and super moist.  Followed the directions precisely and everyone raved.  There were no leftovers.  I will be making this again and again!  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe!  I did read & take some of the suggestions from others & then adapted it for our own use.  I used a dry rub 1st, then simmered it in the crockpot with a very small amt of red wine for about 5 hrs on low.  I then poured all the grease out, added my own BBQ sauce & continued on low for another 2 hrs, then placed under the broiler for 2-3 minutes.  I also cooked some pork  steaks along with the ribs since my husband isn't a rib fan.  Both the ribs & the pork steaks were great!  Thanks for entering the recipe!

My first attempt at cooking ribs at home and they were excellent. These blow away any ribs I've had a restaurant. I followed some of the suggestions and used KC Masterpiece in the sauce. I used a 2.5 lb rack of ribs from Wal-Mart and they only needed about 4-5 hours (on low) in the crock pot. Delicious!!

This recipe made my husband say "wow". He is a huge fan of ribs and wings and he said this was one of the best he has ever tasted. I used spare ribs instead of babyback but it came out great!

This recipes yeilds very tender BBQ ribs...however the sauce wasn't my favorite (not terrible but not the best). I would recommend keeping an eye on it for the last two hours if you plan to leave it for 8 hours on low (mine burnt a little).

Used barbecue sauce instead of ketchup and made a slight difference. Precooking essential. I also put back in the oven after slow cooker just to seal the glaze. Will make over & over again.

I needed to know how to cook ribs in the slower cooker.  The method in this recipe worked great!!  I didn't use the sauce part of the recipe, so I'm not reviewing that aspect of this recipe.  Browning the ribs in the oven first, gave them a nice color as well as making them a little crispy, great idea!!!  When they were done, the ribs were falling off the bone tender. Thanks!!!

This is the first time I have made ribs in the slow cooker.   I took the advice of other users and replaced the ketchup with bbq sauce and I am glad I did! Excellent flavor! The meat just fell off of the bones!

I used 1 cup bbq sauce and 1/2 cup ketchup instead of chili sauce. I did have to add some liquid (beef broth) because my crock pot cooks really hot, even on low. The ribs turned out tender with great flavor.

I made this recipe and all turned out fine. Everyone enjoyed. I did use BBQ instead of ketchup. I cooked for a little over 7 hours and it was too long. So I will do 6 hours next time.

These are truly great. All our family & friends know that  my husband is the king of BBQing (Especially with ribs), he's also very picky with ribs, and he LOVED these, so that tells ya something rite there =) I also use Beef ribs instead, since we do not eat pork, still turns out great. The first time I made these, i did not have any chili sauce on hand so i substituted the (2 cups of ketchup) for 2 cups BBQ sauce and substitued the (1 cup of chili sauce) for 1 cup ketchup and i haven't changed it since. Hope this helps! =)

I followed others suggestion and did not use that much ketchup. i added bottle of bbq sauce. i guess the flavor will depend on the bbq sauce you buy. This was overall good, but i will make again trying different flavors. very yummy.

ill come back and rate this tomorrow since I haven't tried the ribs just yet.  its the night before and i just got done preparing the sauce.  i halved the recipe since i am making this for two people and the ketchup taste was a bit overpowering.  seemed like it should go on a burger instead of ribs.  i added a teaspoon more of vinegar and worcestershire sauce and added a 1/2 t of molasses.  i also went a bit heavy on the salt and pepper.  think im gonna love it.

This is such a good recipe, except I didn't follow it, like lots of others!  But - it's a good base.  I used barbecue sauce too, and found it's a real good way to use up bbq sauces when you only have "just a dab" of different ones.  The only problem is that the ribs come out a little different each time!  Always yummy!  The first time I made them I used Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce and the second time I used a little SBR and a little Bullseye bbq sauce.  Depends on what you like.  This is an excellent basic recipe.

Usually I make a knockoff of Chili's Ribs which are awesome.  But these take no time at all, are super, and great for weekday meal when I work.  Sauce is so easy and my opinion is not too many ingredients.  I use country-style ribs (more meat). Added a sprinkle of Penzey's BBQ Seasoning to ribs while in oven.  For a crockpot recipe this is a winner.  Most crockpot recipes are bland and unappetizing.  A winner that I will definitely make again.

LOVED this cooking method for ribs. they were great hot out of the slow cooker, and even better the next day as pulled pork sandwiches! i substituted half a bottle of my preferred BBQ sauce for the one in the recipe, which is the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars. definitely recommended!

I used the recipe with beef short ribs and rice. I added a cup of BBQ sauce instead of the 2nd cup of ketchup. The sauce was a little thin, but good. I would eliminate the BBQ sauce next time.

For your information, Chili Sauce is not Mexican nor Asian. I buy the Heinz, 12oz size, in a clear glass jar. It's not at all spicy. It mostly contains tomatoes and vinegar with a little corn syrup.

I thought your recipe was very nice...and I used each ing. listed. Someone reviewed that we should all just use barbecue sauce and not rate this very well, but I have to say I enjoyed it. If I wanted to use bbq sauce than I would. This is like buying boxed pancake mix, as compared to making the batter yourself. You can add, take away or do as I did...and follow it.
Not really sure why someone would tell over 400 reviewers how many stars they should give out for your recipe, but thanks for posting it! :)

This was the first time I made ribs and I was really happy with the results.  The meat was very tender and fell right off the bone... we didn't have to use our hands to eat them!  My guests were really impressed.  This is a keeper! The few changes I made were to replace the chili sauce with bbq sauce, add a dry rub on the ribs before putting them in the oven and cut the ketchup by half.  Before serving them, I also slathered them with some more bbq sauce.  Yum!

Used this recipe for beef short ribs. Followed exactly except seasoned the ribs with s&p and then browned them in the oven for 30 minutes each side. The meat was very tender and flavorful.

Was just OK with me, but hubby & my sons enjoyed it. I amnot big on bbq ribs, so maybe I cant fairly review. they gave it a 5, I give it a 3, so I compromised and gave it a 4. it was easy and loved the idea of doing it in the crock.

I used two cups bbq sauce in place of ketchup and kept the chili sauce in.  Dusted the outside of ribs with a bbq rub and only baked twenty minutes before putting in the crock pot.  The only other thing I addded was a little garlic powder to the sauce.  Turned out wonderfully, thanks!!

I used 2 cups of bbq sauce and 1 cup ketchup like most other people.  I gave it a 3 star because nobody really uses the original recipe.  The recipe calls for chili sauce, but what exactly does that mean?  THere are so many different types of chili sauce.  I seared the ribs first on my grill pan for 10 minutes which gave them a nice crust.

Came out great. Kids loved them. I also borrowed from previous suggestions and used 2 cups bbq sauce 1 cup ketchup and omitted the chili sauce. I also threw in a big tbsp of minced garlic. Fall of the bone yummy!

Very yummy.  I used a meaty rib, so they wouldn't fall apart before we had the chance to eat them.  I used BBQ Sauce and Chili Sauce instead of Ketchup and served them with Garlic Mashers and steamed Green Beans from the garden.  Cooked on low for 6 hours or so, a keeper for sure...

A great recipe and I love the aroma in the house during the day.    When I take the ribs out of the slow cooker the meat is falling off the bone and it is virtually impossible to retain the form of the meat.    It does not present well on the plate but it taste great.

Out of this world flavor!  I had to substitute salsa for the chili sauce, and it was still scrumptious.  No leftovers, and family wants it again and again.

I will say these were good ribs.  I used 2 cups BBQ sauce and 1 cup ketchup as was mentioned in other reviews. Kept everything else the same.

They really just tasted like I had used a bottle of BBQ sauce.  I will make crockpot ribs again, but I think I'll just use a bottle of sauce.

This recipe was awesome! I used 2 cups of BBQ sauce and 1 cup of ketchup, like some of you suggested.  The meat was falling off the bones and my dad (who was visiting at the time) LOVED it! Will make again! Thanks for the delish recipe!

My son and I liked the ribs but my husband did not care for them.  The flavor of the ribs was good.  The meat was tender and fell off the bone.  But it was very fatty also.  Maybe I needed to trim most of the fat off before cooking.

Unlike others, I wanted to see what this recipe was like as is.  So, I made it just like the recipe.  The only change I made is that I used Mccormick dry pork rub.  The sauce taste good, but was way to runny/thin.  I'm not a cook, so I didn't know what to add to make it thicker. I think next time, I'll just use BBQ sauce and slow cook the ribs.

Very tasty and easy.  I didn't pre-brown in the oven, just tossed everything in the crock-pot.  One less thing to clean.  I used a bottle of bbq sauce instead of the chili sauce and just one cup of ketchup.  I used boneless ribs and they were so tender and good.

These were a hit! I gave it 4 stars because I made the changes suggested in other recipies (subbing BBQ sauce for ketcup and ketchup for chili sauce). The other reason I gave it a 4 was because the recipie would not have made enough sauce as written! There are only two of us and only one meat eater so I just did 1 pound of ribs and made sauce for 4 pounds which made just enough extra for some rice.
The only thing my hubby recommended was rotating the ribs halfway through. But he also said that he would divorce me if I don't make these again!

Best rib recipe I've tried yet. So what if it's only the second time I made ribs! I used Spare Ribs, followed the suggestion of using 2 C BBQ and 1 C Ketchup, but left everything else the same.  The biggest problem I had was--not having had a lot of experience with ribs--I wasn't sure if I was supposed to separate the ribs before I put them into the slow cooker.  I just split the whole slab into 2 chunks, and at the end of the cooking time, the chunk on the bottom (which was submerged in the sauce the entire cooking time) was more tender, and infused with more flavor and color.  Once I took the ribs out of the slow cooker, I finished them off in the oven at 350 for about 5 minutes on each side to carmelize the sauce.  I liked the manageability of two larger pieces of meat, and will probably just re-arrange the ribs half-way through cooking time next time.  And I do believe there will be many more "next times"!  Cheers!

I followed the changes that BROOKIIEE made, and these were fantastic!  I'd never had pork ribs before (something my husband HAD to fix!) and these were so great for a first time!  They literally fell apart and were so tender!  I would make these over and over again!  This is a fantastic recipe!!!

OK I'm making this again tonight. I've made it exactly as the directions and have also improvised as well. tonight I'm going to improves again as i have no chili sauce.this is an absolute awesome recipe, with a little spice and sweetness it really takes the cake.my family really loves it i have 4 kids ranging from 14-8 and they can't get enough. even darling hubby loves them and hes not a big ribs fan. again the BBQ will be used as well as the ketchup and all the ingredients I'm sure it will be a big hit. thank you for this wonderfully tasty dish.

Excellent recipe. I loved the thick, sticky sauce on it. My husband thinks it's better than any ribs he had at our local rib fest.
I did what others suggested used bbq sauce instead of ketchup and ketchup instead of chili sauce.

Loved this recipe---I used medium salsa instead of chili sauce (since I didn't have any!!) They turned out great.   Just remember to spray crock pot with cooking spray first for easier clean up:)

EXCELLENT RECIPE !!! My family and I thought these were the best ribs we've ever eaten. The only changes I made were to omit the oregano and replace it with 1 tsp. parsley flakes and 1 tsp. garlic powder. After cooking the ribs on low for 7 hours, I placed them in a shallow baking dish and broiled them to make the sauce stick better. It was difficult getting the ribs out of the crock pot because the meat was falling apart it was so tender. Thanks for the recipe Suzanne. It was a big hit with my family.

Snaps for Suzanne! These are wonderful. The recipe is so versitile any sauce combo will work. I used 4 different sauces that had a small bit in each or no one liked. Put them all together with the rest of ingredients and they were great. I've made these a few times using beef and pork, both were good my kids liked the baby back ribs better. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Not much else left to say.  Very good ribs.  I used my favorite BBQ sauce in place of ketchup and sprinkled some rib seasoning on as well as salt and pepper.  I also left off the oregano.  I did about 4 hours on high, 2 on low then finished in the oven for about 15 minutes.  I used two slabs of baby back ribs.  This is the only way I will ever make ribs again!  The ONLY bad thing - smelling the ribs cooking all day - it was torture!

This was delicious! However the 6 hours we cooked it was too long. The sauce started to burn on the side of the crock pot. I also think it overcooked the meat a little.

I think these would have tasted much better if I hadn't let it cook for the entire 6 hours. All of the meat ended up falling off of the bone and what we really ended up with was barbecued pork.

This recipe was to die for!!! I will be making this often. My kids loved it also. I used country ribs instead of baby back ribs because that was all i had. The sauce was wonderful and would be delicious on any type of meat you would choose.

I have yet to try the sauce yet but as far as the method used ***** 5 star. I seasoned the pork baby back ribs, then browned in the oven 15-20 min on each side from there I put in them in the crock pot and used Open Pit original bbq sauce and cooked for 4 hours on high and they turned out very tender  & delicious. Thanks for the wonderful recipe

All I can say is WOW!!! I made this exactly as directed - with the exception of adding about 1/4 cup of white wine when the liquid simmered down too low after 3 hours of cooking. The flavor is AWESOME! I used red wine vinegar and everything else to the 't.' The meat was falling off the bone, and my husband who swore he would never love ribs unless they came off of a smoker, wanted 2nds and 3rds! Awesome recipe! Thank you!

This style of making ribs was great, and I amke ribs a lot.  I have two slow cookers so I made two huge batches.  We ate one and froze the other.  We recently had last minute company and the frozen batch made a stellar quick, easy and impressive meal in a flash.  All of our guests raved, and all I had to do was put the ribs on the bbq for a few minutes to thaw and warm through.

I've made these a few times and still can't get over how good and how easy they are. I also did the substitution of bbq sauce for the ketchup, etc. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing!

Definitely not barbeque flavor at all, but they did cook well in the crock pot and got very tender.  I would rather have this sauce with pork chops and white rice.  The sauce tastes very tomatoey.  I had to fix these up by baking for awhile with some barbeque sauce on them, they were great but you definitely need to add barbeque sauce if you want barbeque ribs!

The meat was really oily, even though I cut of most of the fat.  If I was to make them next time,  I would let the fat separate before serving.... For me, ribs just need to go on the grill.

So easy!  So economical!  These were sooo tender, juicy, and they just fell apart.  Perfect sauce with just a little zip.  I separated the grease from the sauce, reduced it in a sauce pot, slathered the ribs, and broiled until caramely on top. Will make this way again and again! (oh - I used country style ribs)
Cooked again w/country style ribs - both times there is about 2-3 cups sauce remaining.  Could cut down on recipe but I really think it's needed when simmering to fully cover all the ribs. Cook abuout 20 min longer in oven when using this cut.

Great receipe.  The porter beer wasn't too strong,  I have in the past did a chicken receipe that had a can of Bud Beer in it and it was too overpowering. But not this one.

This recipe was excellent!  But, like some of the other reviewers, I didn't have any Chili Sauce, so I used 2 cups of barbeque sauce and 1 cup of ketchup.

Really good.  Used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce (2 c.) and one cup ketchup.  Couldn't find babyback ribs so bought Porkloin "countrystyle" bone-in ribs which were fatty, but still very good with a lot of meat.  I will definitely keep this recipe for future use!

It was a great recipe although I took the ribs out an hour early and they tasted very overdone.  I cooked it on low.  But I think all cookers vary with temperature, so watch them!

Easy, carefree way to make ribs, especially in the winter.  Used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce instead of chili sauce and only half of the ketchup.  Tasted great and fell off the bone just like we like it.  Will make again.

I've just finished putting my ribs into the slow cooker and am rating based on ease of preparation.  I give this part of the recipe 5 stars.  I woke up this morning and immediately put the ribs into the oven to brown, as directed.  Then I made the sauce which I altered as other reviewers suggested with BBQ sauce for the ketchup and ketchup for the chili sauce.  All in all it took me a 1/2-hour to get the ribs into the slow cooker.  It was SO easy!! Stay tuned for another review once they are done and we can taste the results.

These ribs were excellent!  The only change I made was instead of 2 c. ketchup, I used 1 1/2 c. and then 1/2 c. honey BBQ sauce.  Delicious!  Only took 4 hours too!

These are wonderful!  Baking the ribs prior to putting them in the crockpot really makes a difference.  They just fell off the bone and right in our mouths!

Yummy! I would have never thought of putting oregano into bbq ribs, but added a unique taste that was very good. I did add one small finely diced onion, and increased the hot sauce to a few dashes instead of just one. Even better the next day!!!

WOW! Fell off the bone!!! I did however add some bullseye honey garlic bbq sauce, about a 1/4 cup to give it a little more zip as well as a few dashes of hot sauce instead of just one. My husband loved it!!

Here are my changes-1 cup ketchup, 2 cups BBQ sauce, 1/2 teaspoon Tobasco, no oregano, and one chopped onion.  Took out of the cooker and placed under the oven broiler for 10 minutes.  This was awesome.

My fiance said "some of the best ribs I've ever had".  I didn't have chile sauce, so I made my own by using 1 can tomato sauce, 3 tablespoons chile powder, garlic and onion to taste.  Delicious!!!

The sauce on these ribs is delicious.  Now I make the sauce and keep it in the frig for chicken on the grill.  My husband said he doesn't want any other bar-b-q sauce.

THE BEST RIBS EVER!!! It even compares to the ribs at Phil's BBQ in San Diego. The secret is to use this recipe but use really good BBQ sauce (we got ours from Costco), and before you serve them, grill them for 10 minutes, and voila! You've got smoky, finger-lickin good ribs.

Easy recipe to make.  While pre-baking the meat (country-style ribs), I heated the sauce, substituting BBQ sauce for the chili sauce.  Husband liked it a lot.

Finger licking good!!  I  love the sauce.  I cooked the ribs in the crock pot until tender, then brush the sauce on afterward, then bake in the oven for 30 minutes at 375 so the sauce can carmelized.  Delicious.

Ribs definitely need to be BBQ'd, at some point.  These were better 2 days later.  I would possibly make again, but put on the BBQ to give a good crusting on them.

The ribs were good, falling off the bone actually.  I think I would like a smokier BBQ sauce and would add liquid smoke as another reviewer suggested.  I would make less sauce as well, the meat was saturated in the sauce and my husband thought it was too much, couldn't taste the meat itself.  All in all, everyone liked them and there were no leftovers!

These were very good.  I have evn used the recipe with boneless pork chops and they turned great as well.  I do add some crushed chili peppers and a bit more hot sauce to these because we love spicy food.  Definetly worth a try.

This is the best recipe and it is so easy!  I did not have enough time to let the ribs cook all day, so I followed all of the directions except I cooked them on the high setting of my slow cooker for about three hours.  When I took them out, the meat literally fell off of the bones! I wish I had cooked more!  (I used only one slab.  This fed one hungry man, and I got only a taste!)  Cook with corn on the cob and pick up some cole slaw and bread and you are set!

My family absolutely loved this recipe!  I used country-style ribs and substituted 1/2 of the ketchup with bbq sauce, left out the chili sauce and worcestershire.  They were so tender and delicious!  Just as good the second day, also!

I've made this twice now.  My family loves it.  It's easy and delicious.  I also use 1 Cup of good quality honey barbecue sauce instead of the Chili sauce. I will be making this frequently.  The meat is so tender and falling off the bones!

these turned out delicious but i made some variations. i made my own bbq sauce out of ketchup, brown sugar, worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, honey, vinegar, fresh minced garlic, salt, pepper and lots of cayenne pepper for a kick. i also omitted the first baking part and just cooked them 3 hours on high and 1 hour on low because i started late. the ribs were so tender they were literally falling off the bone in my crock pot! i will make these again

This is the best rib recipe ever.  I used spareribs instead of babyback; Used 1 cup ketchup and 1 cup BBQ sauce (Montgomery Inn) and only had 1/2 cup chili sauce.  Forgot to add the vinegar, but the flavor was superb and they were fall off the bone tender!  Kids kept going back to the crockpot for more.  I also skipped browning them in the oven first, just tosse them in the crockpot. Best ribs I have EVER made! Thanks for sharing!

These were wonderful. My whole family loved them, even my picky eater 5yr old son ate them.  The only thing I changed on the recipe was I omitted the Chili sauce and only used 1 cup of Ketchup and added 2 cups of my favorite Barbecue sauce. Will use this recipe over and over. A winner in my household.

Absolutely incredible! Made these for guests, and we were all licking our fingers. I too substituted one cup of barbecue sauce for one cup of ketchup. I also had to cut the rack of ribs in half so that it would fit in our crock pot. Thank you for such a fantastic recipe.

This was the first time I ever cooked ribs.  This recipe was "meat falling off the bone" good!  I added chopped onion and some garlic to my ingredients.  I also thickened the sauce with a slurry of corn starch and water and used it as a dipping sauce.  Finger lickin' good!

This was delicious!  A terrific alternative for those of us without a grill.  My husband was skeptical, but he even said they were good!  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used 1c ketchup and 1c BBQ sauce.  Followed everything else to a T, though I did use boneless ribs.  Will definitely be making again!

Cooked in the oven on a rack for 20 minutes (no turning), and 6 1/2 hours in the slow cooker, these were tender and falling off the bone.  Based on other reviewers and allowing for personal taste, I used 1 cup bottled honey garlic barbeque sauce and 1 cup ketchup, 1/3 cup brown sugar, 3 Tablespoons vinegar, 1 teaspoon oregano, and 2 teaspoons worcestershire for the sauce.  Instead of hot sauce I used about 1/2 teaspoon dried chipotle pepper.  Everybody loved these and requested the recipe.  They are not gourmet, but they are easy and good.  I personally feel that a good rib should have a bit of chewiness, but if you like a really tender rib, these are for you!!

Very yummy and easy!  So tender the bones just fell out!  My boyfriend had always made ribs by first boiling, then baking, then grilling them, this was so much simpler!  I took the advice of other reviews and used 2 c. bbq sauce for the ketchup, 1 c. ketchup for the chili sauce, only 1 Tbls. vinegar (as neither of us care much for the taste), and also added some garic, onion, and liquid smoke.  Very good!

This was fantabulous.  I took this to work and it was gone within 25 minutes.  People were asking when I was going to bring it back.  After I let them cook on low for 8 hours.  I placed them in the broiler for 5-10 minutes to allow the sauce to thicken up and stick better to the ribs.  It was wonderful.  I wish I would have made more the first time, but I will definitely make this again

Put this on last night, it cooked for about 10 hours. Was pretty good, meat flaked right off the bone.  Wasn't any left after having it for lunch.  Halved all the ingredients so the sauce may have been a tad overcooked, but still good.

I loved the ease with making these ribs. I did follow others advise and changed the sauce up a bit. Next time I think I will use a favorite bottled BBQ sauce and add Cayene to add a touch of oomph. I also do recommend the oven cooking at first to remove some of the fat. Awesome fall off the bone ribs! I will be using this recipe again.

These ribs wer out of this world!!! 
I will for sure be making this again!  
I did tweak the recipe like a few others did.  
I used 1 cup ketchup and 1 cup Barbecue Sauce instead of 2 cups ketchup and they turned out perfectly tender and delicious!! 
 Thanks Suzanne!!

maybe i did something different, but when i had the 4lbs of spareribs, they didn't get covered by the sauce.  so, i put three bottles of bbq sauce (one honey hickory smoked, one original, the third based on what i had of two others [honey and original]), in, and that covered (read: smothered) them.  7 hours later, they were very good.  i also used a dry rub that i made myself (1T ground black pepper, 1T sugar, 2t cayenne pepper, 2T chili powder, 1T cumin, 1T garlic powder, 1T brown sugar, 4T paprika [sweet], 1T salt), which made it a little spicy (not hot to me, others found it to be hot).  the 5 star is really more for the cooking method, since with about 54oz (nearly 7 cups) of BBQ sauce, it was different than what this would make.

The ribs turned out AWESOME! Took the advice of others and only used 1 cup ketchup, and was glad i did. Was great as leftovers too, pulled the meat off the ribs and used it in sandwiches. Mmmmm! Got great reviews from everyone :)

I usually buy country style spare ribs but they come out tough when I bar-b-que them.  When I cooked these in the slow cooker, as everyone said, the meat just fell right off the bone. My husband loved them and so did I. I will definitely make these again.

This was awesome!!!I am new to cooking and made these for friends,( one who cooks for a living) and they loved it! The only thing I did differently was to use parsley instead of oregano because I had just run out. Hubby isn't too fond of ribs and even he asked me to do these again. Thank you so much for sharing.

These were excellent and even better as leftovers! 

 I used Kraft chicken and rib barbecue sauce as well as the other ingredients EXCEPT the ketchup.  I also added sliced onions.  I ended up adding water a couple of times while cooking as the sauce was drying up.

These were okay but I guess I like baby back ribs made on the grill instead of in the slow cooker.  I just do not think that it held the bbq sauce very well.  Thanks anyway but I will keep on looking.

Tender, delicious, and pretty easy.  I cooked these in a 6qt Nesco roaster on the slow cook setting.  I followed suggestion of using half ketchup and half BBQ sauce (Kraft original).  I also used 12oz. bottle of chili sauce because I like it.  They cooked about 8 hours - nice and tender.

This was the first time making ribs. I did season with salt, pepper and garlic powder for 24 hours before browning in the oven. This is a keeper and I searved it with mashed potatoes.

These were by far the best ribs I have ever had!!!  I did add some regular and honey bbq sauce about 1 1/2 cups WITH the ketchup!  It seemed to need a little more sauce to cook in.  These were such a hit!  I will make these over and over and over again!  Thank you sooo much!

These ribs were absolutely delicious!! The only thing I did differently was subbing 1/2 c. BBQ sauce for 1/2 c. ketchup  and I left out the oregano.  It is the only way I'll do my ribs now other than the grill in summertime!

Yum, yum, yum! I tweaked it by doing the following: I rubbed the ribs in a simple dry rub and left in the fridge overnight to allow the flavours to penetrate the meat. I got up a bit early the next morning to brown the ribs in the oven and threw it in the slow cooker. The bbq sauce listed looks ok, but I used a homemade bbq sauce spiked with Kentucky Bourbon and allowed it to simmer on low all day. It was the most wonderful smell to come home to!

Ok I have to admit.... I used bottled BBQ sauce! But I'm so glad I ran across this idea. I blasted the ribs in the oven, but them into 4 ribs each sections, layered in crock, poured sauce over and blasted in the broiler a little bit just before serving. The outcome was excellent. We're rib lovers and this was so easy, the meat was excellent - every part was edible and meaty. Would definately recommend cooking like this

Ribs were very tender, but tast was just ok. I wouldn't use the oregano again. It made it taste like an Italian dish instead of BBQ!  I seasoned my meat first with seasoning salt, garlic powder, pepper, chili powder, and a little of the brown sugar.  I used a little commercial BBQ sauce instead of all the ketchup.  I wish I had used more because the sauce had a strong Ketchup taste!  I also added a couple teaspoons of liquid smoke to give it more of a BBQ taste.

Very, very good. I didn't have any chile sauce, so I used enchilada sauce instead and as others suggested, I used half ketchup, half BBQ sauce. The rib meat fell off the bone and were tender & juicy! I had planned on finishing them on the grill to char them, but as I removed them from the crockpot they fell apart!

Suzanne, many thanks for this recipe. I just add a roughly chopped onion and use half ketchup and half BBQ sauce instead of all ketchup. Very good with the Western-style ribs. 5 stars!

These ribs were really good.  I followed the recipe almost exactly except I used Apple Cider Vinegar.  The sauce was really good, but didn't coat the ribs as much as I would have liked.  Even using the full ration of ketchup (unlike others) it came out tasting very much like barbeque sauce.  We really liked them, but they weren't "mind-blowing" good.

I was skeptical that such an easy recipes could be good.  But to my surprise, these ribs competed with some of the top-rated restaurants.  Delicious!

These ribs were, as promised, fall-off-the-bone tender.  However, I found that cooking the ribs and sauce together made the sauce too greasy for my tastes.  My husband and children loved it, though.

This recipe was delicious and easy.  I had already started before realizing I did not have chilli sauce so I used salsa instead.  I must try it exactly as shown, because it was still good with the substitution.  I served it to my husband and 2 friends and they liked it.

My husband liked the ribs, but I wasn't too crazy about them.  I'm going to try to make them again with the BBQ sauce like some one had suggested.  The ribs were nice and tender, but the ketchup was too much for me.  I would definitly cut back on the ketchup.

These were excellent. I put them on the grill for a few minutes before serving. My husband said these were better than any he's had at a restaurant.

I can’t give this five stars because of it missing a few basic steps.  The membrane should be removed from the back of the ribs.  I also added liquid smoke to emulate that grilled flavor.  After preheating the oven, I broiled the ribs before cooking them in the slow cooker.  The ambient heat plus the direct heat is a good combination.  Like many suggested, I used my favorite prepared BBQ sauce instead of this ketchup mixture.  End result was an incredible experience, loved by friends & family!

Here is my adjustments for 8 lbs of pork spare ribs: 
- 2 cups of ketchup
- 1 cup of favorite bbq
- 1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes
- 2 tablespoon of Frank's Hot Sauce
- 1/8 of cup of real Vermont maple syrup
- 1 teaspoon of garlic powder
- 3 full carrots & 1/4 onion sliced (lining bottom of slow cooker)
- Follow all other ingredients in this recipe

Cut into 1/4 racks, sprinkle meat tenderizer on both sides before browning in oven for 30 mins (15 mins on each side).  

Last, stack one 1/4 rack rib on top of carrots/onions, then stack remaining ribs on end making a circle along out edge of slow cooker and another circle of ribs in center

Slow cook on High for 2hrs, then on low for 2hrs

They were simply amazing!!!

I pointed my dad to this recipe so he could make ribs on his own. He thought the ketchup seemed excessive so we cut back on the amount. He wisked together spicy brown mustard and brown sugar with the worchestire sauce and that helped add tons of flavor. Keeping this nearby for whenever we need a reference again

The meat came out nice and tender, but both my husband and my adult son thought the sauce was too sweet and had too much tomato for their tastes.  I had no chili sauce, so I looked up a recipe for a chili sauce substitute and it had a whole cup of ketchup in it.  Maybe this was why the dish had too much tomato flavor.

It was good. Like most people I substituted BBQ sauce for the ketchup and I halved the chili sauce because my family doesn't like it too spicy. I'll probably make it again.

Waaaaay to sweet.  Will make it again and completely omit the brown sugar.  Probably will add more hot than the recipe called for. 
Week later --Made it again without any added sugar.  Still to sweet from the corn syrup in the ketchup and chili sauce.  Will not try this again.

I did not use the sauce listed here, I used my fav bottled sauce.  i baked them before as the recipe called for them put in crock pot with about 3/4 c sauce.  Cooked for 4 hours in slow cooker and they were falling off the bone.  I took our added more sauce and baked 15 min on each side in oven at 400 so sauce would carmelize.  They were delicious!  This is my new rib recipe from now on.

My family loves these ribs.  When we feel like sweet ribs, I simply  spread the ribs with Peach, Mango or Seedless Blackberry fruit spread instead of the BBQ sauce.  Always tender and juicy. So Easy. Thank you for sharing.

These are the best ribs ever! I have made them three times now and the only thing I do different is I put extra hot sauce in it but not if I make it for children or I make two pots and added extra for the adults!

The BF loved this.... I read through so many reviews... I did bake on 400 for about twenty minutes per side before adding the ribs to the cooker... then added a homemade BBQue sauce and let it cook for about 7 hours on low. Turned out great!

This was great ! The only change I made was to eliminate the hot sauce. We are not fans. The meat just falls off the bone and it is so flavorful. Yummy !

I’m SO picky about ribs. I’ve made all kinds and didn’t like any of them! I made the bbq sauce day ahead and cooked at 200 in the oven instead if the slow cooker. I was skeptical about pouring the sauce over them & just cooking. I don’t like them drippy; normally, I would throw them on the grill just to char them a bit. Instead, I took the lid off and upped the temp to 350.  By the time the oven hit 350, they were done. No char, but good a

The oven didn't cook off much if any fat so crock pot filled with fat, I drained it out about 1/2 way through and moved the ribs that were sitting in the fat to the top.  They cooked way faster than expected, totally falling apart by 5 hours on low.  We actually basted them with BBQ sauce and put in oven on 400 for 15 mins to caramelize.  Would have been delicious and perfect expect they were just so soft.  Still good, just not what I was hoping for.  Next time, skip initial baking, cook on low 4 hrs, then in oven coated with bbq sauce to caramelize.

Great way to cook ribs!  I left them in the oven a little longer and it gave the ribs a great crust.  I'm not a ketchup fan so I didn't really like the sauce.  Next time I'll use my own sauce.

I made a few changes only because it was what I had on hand. I didn't have enough ketchup so I used one cup ketchup one cup bq sauce. Because of the sweetness of the BQ sauce I left out the sugar . Every thing else was exact. So good!!  Definitely make again!!

I also swapped bbq sauce for the ketchup like many suggested. I used Jack Daniel's #5 bbq sauce and I also added 2 cloves of garlic to the slow cooker. Very delicious! The sauce had a nice zing to it that even I, someone who isn't a huge fan of spicy foods liked! The meat is moist, and pretty tender! I would probably allow for the whole 8 hours for the sauce to really soak in though.

I was surprised how good these were. I used the ideas from other reviewers to use store bought bbq sauce and then broil them at the end. They were delicious, and my family loved them. I made some just in the oven to compare, and they were on the dry side. The crock pot won!

First time making ribs in the slow cooker. I used our favorite bottled barbecue sauce instead of sauce listed in the initial recipe. It was delicious, I made sweet restaurant slaw from this site and a can of Bush's baked beans. Wonderful dinner, can't wait to make it again. Thank you for the recipe.

I was most interested in the method and not the bbq sauce.  I did as instructed and cut up the ribs , 2 bones each, and baked 15 on each side.  I then placed in slow cooker for roughly 5 1/2 hours on low, poured my own bottled bbq sauce on them.  I wanted to them firm enough to finish off on the grill and they were. I  put more sauce on them,  finished them by grilling.  They stuck to the bones but came off easily as eating. Perfection.

I agree with other reviewers that the pre-baking step is crucial.  Omitting the excess grease from the pre-baking kept the sauce thicker.  I also baked them again at the end of the slow cooking step for 20 min at 375 to caramelize the ribs, but 20 was too long as some parts were a little dried out.  I will cut this back to 12-15 minutes next time.  This is a keeper!!

Like a lot of others, I relied mostly on the barbeque sauce, to which I added a little red wine vinegar, brown sugar and worcestershire sauce.  It made a wonderful flavored tender rib.  I used center cut boneless pork ribs that my husband picked out.  He usd to cook them this way and I loved the sauce which I made by following the advice of others.  I would have tried the original sauce but couldn't find chili sauce.

DID NOT MAKE THE RIB SAUCE. The great idea here is putting the ribs in the oven *before* using the crock pot. Also put them in the oven after for 20min at 350 to caramelize them. Very tasty with Sylvia's Rib sauce recipe!!

The first time I made this I went by the exact recipe and it was great, but did seem a bit ketchup-y for my liking. I later looked at the reviews and saw some people  said they substituted the ketchup for BBQ sauce and thought it was brilliant.

I made it again using that substitution and also added some garlic, onion powder and extra Tapatio for the hot sauce. It turned out AMAZING and I will be definitely using those substitutions again in the future! These were the first two times I ever made ribs and my family is loving it!

I made modifications to the original recipe and these came out amazing and perfect! I used most of the directions and ingredients with the exception of the following:I used a 4.5lb slab of pork spare ribs which I divided into 3 sections. (I didn’t see a membrane, or maybe I don’t know what it looks like, so I didn’t remove anything as suggested in the recipe.) For the sauce mixture I subbed Sweet Baby Ray’s hickory & brown sugar bbq sauce for the 2c ketchup, subbed ketchup for the 1c of chili sauce, and I used a whole cup of brown sugar instead of half. I forgot the dash of hot sauce but put in everything else suggested in the original recipe. For cooking I baked it as instructed, then I poured 1/3 of the sauce mixture on the bottom of the crock pot, placed one section of the slab down flat, poured some mixture on it, placed the other two slabs down flat on top of that and poured the rest of the mixture over it. About halfway through cooking, I stacked the slabs upright side by side and made sure all the meat was submerged in the sauce.

Fantastic ribs...a hit with the friends and family. I followed the recipe exactly with just an adjustment of an additional 2 teaspoons of light brown sugar.

I agree that this sauce tastes very ketchup-y for my taste. Also, how is this a slow cooker recipe when it says "set oven to 400"? All told, won't do this one again.

I loved it. I added some other ingredients because it was a bit sweet.  What I addd was hoison sauce and some orange marmalade.    I did not add as much chili sauce either.  I like it but some of the family can’t stand the heat.  This recipe was easy and tastes awesome.

We have been making these for years now.  I've also used St. Louis ribs (it calls for Baby Back).  I've also basically just used my favorite BBQ sauce in replace of the ketchup & chili sauce (I'll add a bit more ketchup) and it's just as good.

Great recipe as long as you replace ketchup with BBQ sauce.  If I have left over red wine I will also put that in place of the vinegar.  I don't usually put in a cup of chili sauce either, just a whole bottle of bbq sauce and a few dashes of tapatio for the hot sauce.

My first time making ribs, and these were great!!  The hubby is usually in charge of ribs, but I took over this time.  He really liked this, however...only change...we missed the crispy, grilled outside from a grilled rib.  We might try slow cooking first, then moving to slowly grill.  I also cut the recipe in half....delicious!!

I love this bbq sauce....not to sweet and easy to control! I even have put the ribs in directly and not browned them first...not much difference.

I have made this twice now, once with country style ribs and once with baby backs. Perfect every time. I did change the sauce up because we all love spicy here. I did have to reduce the cooking time a bit because the meat was falling off the bone.....always a good thing :)

I used this recipe for boneless pork shoulder spareribs. I didn't have any chili sauce, so I made it without out and added a little extra brown sugar. It was awesome!

The flavor was great but I cooked them just over 6 hours and they were very dry.  I will make it again with less cooking time then suggested.

Easy and delicious. My family especially liked the spiciness of the sauce. I used an 8 oz jar of Huy Fong chili garlic sauce.

We have followed this recipe a couple of times using different top rated BBQ sauces versus the ketchup based. The precook is vital to a great finished rack of BBQ Ribs!

Let me start by saying that I am a terrible cook and do not  like to cook.  Any recipe that requires three different cooking methods for one dish is way too many for me.  However, these came out pretty good.  The sauce was overly hot for my family, so I will probably go with a BBQ sauce next time - had to go out to buy the hot ingredients.  Ribs did fall off the bone, however.  Will probably try again some day.

Very delicious and easy to make. Save some of the sauce to pour it over the ribs once they are done to give it an extra tangy delicious flavor.

The tenderness of the ribs was good but the sauce was too sweet. I would skip the sugar next time. Also, I didn't know what sort of chili sauce to use so I bought sweet chili sauce. I'll try sriracha sauce next time.

Great technique, ribs turned out perfect. Used BBQ Sauce recipe from this site and as another suggested, put them back in the oven to carmelize the sauce.  Husband loved them, will make again.  Thank you!

Love love love this in VitaClay! It makes it in about 2 hours and the flavor and texture is amazing! VitaClay requires a bit of liquid to cook, though, so I have to add about a cup of broth or water to the pot, seal it up and cook!

I seasoned my country style ribs with a pork rub before browning in the oven.  I placed the ribs in the slow cooker for several hours by themselves, then drained off some of the fat/liquid before adding the sauce for the last couple of hours of cooking time.  I pretty much stuck to the sauce recipe for the most part.....I did add 1 tsp. dry mustard, 1 TB. chili powder, and the juice of half of a lemon just because I've used those 3 ingredients to past BBQ sauces I've made.  I also raided my herb garden and used fresh oregano rather than dry, about 3 tsp. &  I also was wishing I had some liquid smoke up here at the cabin, and if I did, I would have added some of it to the sauce.   Oh, well.  They were super delicious anyway!  A big hit with my hubs and 2 sons.  You'll love these & they're super easy, too!

We have made this several times in the past six months! We just made this recipe for a July 4 picnic - they were a hit! This recipe is now in our family favorites list for parties! For the party we adjusted it for 25 pounds of St. Louis Style Ribs and used 5 crockpots going from middle of the night until mid morning - it turned out amazing! We shared leftovers with guests who were more than happy to take some home.

I did the recipe exactly as written, it was good and my family loved it.  The next day , it was even better! The only thing I may change, it seemed a little overcooked so I  may shorten the length of time  for cooking.

The title should be changed since this isn't a slow-cooker recipe. It's slow roasted in an oven.

This was my first time cooking ribs in a slab. They came out tender and juicy. I slow cooked for 8 hrs, seasoned with a marinade before the oven , then added sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce 4 hrs before done. It was really yummy. I will do it again.

We really liked this recipe. Only change was,  I used Barbacue Sauce instead of Ketchup. When placed in oven after 6 hours of Slow Cooking, I did put more sauce on top to help it stay moist. The remaining sauce I froze to use again, as the barbacue sauce was delicious.

Ribs were fall off the bone tender but didn't care for the sauce. Will probably use a bottle of bbq sauce next time after seasoning with salt, pepper and garlic powder.

Delicious! Followed others' advice  and substituted barbeque sauce for the ketchup and removed the crock pot lid for the last hour to thicken the sauce. This recipe is a winner.

Extremely easy to make, very tender BUT we wanted ribs, with the meat attached.    The meat fell off the bones and we basically had shredded pork.  But wasn't what we wanted.   I'd used this recipe for buying a pork tenderloin and make  shredded pork sandwiches.

I would reserve some of the BBQ sauce to apply after cooking. In the crock pot, the sauce thinned out some (with the juices from the pork ribs) - we like thick sauce. The ribs were tender and falling off the bone... very good!

Great recipe.  I would do it again.  I have a small slow cooker so I rotated the ribs after 4 and  7 hours to ensure even saucing of the ribs.  I also thinly sliced an onion and laid that down on the bottom of the slow cooker for a little additional flavour.  This recipe is a keeper.

This BBQ sauce is great. I actually saved a 1/4 cup and baked two chicken thighs in the oven for 35 minutes. It was fabulous. The ribs fell apart. They were so tender.  My honey loved it. I'll make it again.

We love this. I did follow others suggestions,  I used a cup to a cup and 1/4 of BBQ sauce  and made up the rest of two cups w/ ketchup. I think you should adjust  the ingredients of the sauce to suit your own pallet...but the cooking method was close to perfect.

I will definitely make this again. I did use a store bought BBQ sauce for time saving sake, but cannot wait to try the recipes when I have a chance. Pre baking is perfect and keeps the crock pot from becoming a vat of boiling rib goo. Perfect simple Sunday dinner

I read previous reviews and used my own BBQ sauce.  The ribs were tender and delicious.  The only thing I will try differently next time is to boil the ribs first instead of cooking in the oven.  Their was a lot of fat left in the ribs and the BBQ sauce was very fatty and runny.

Uh-MAY-zing! 

FYI the chili sauce is in the Asian aisle NOT the Mexican aisle. That should save you 15 minutes of staring at different cans of weird tomatoes and peppers at the store.....

This was a great way to make tender, flavorful ribs with minimal cleanup in the winter time!  Don't skip roasting the ribs in the oven - it produces a crisper, less fatty rib which is the perfect "canvas" for the sauce.  I used 2 cups Sweet Baby Ray's B-BQ/honey sauce (our favorite) and just coated the ribs in the slow cooker, turned on to low and simmered for 7 hours.  The only change I'll make is to cut the cook time down to 5-6 hours next time - our slower cooker tends to run hot, even on low.   The meat was entirely off the bone and I like a little work! 

This recipe is definitely being put in our family's meal rotation - my 11 year old son gave it an 11 rating out of 10!!!

These were by far the BEST ribs ever.  Even my fiancé had his doubts because we always smoke or grill them but he's hooked now! The sauce is perfect. The only thing we did differently and only to speed up the cooking process was boil them 20-30 min before putting the into crockpot for 3 hours and they were done.  Thanks for this recipe. Oh and there were no leftovers haha 
***oops I just had to edit this. *** Wrong recipe but the recipe I used IS on here and I used a crock pot and honey was in the ingredients list . This on earth may be good, not sure but head on over to the recipe I used and you'll be amazed!

I followed the recipe exactly, since I like to do that the first time I make something and it was delicious. The only change was that instead of Pork Baby back ribs I used Louisiana style pork ribs that I was told by the butcher that they are a little meatier and the weight was 3.6 lbs. They were done in 4 hours at low setting. The bones fell by themselves and served them with a mix of mashed sweet potatoes and  Idaho potatoes. Finger licking good! 
I would do them again and not change a thing!

This came out really good. On the advice of other commenters I used 2 cups bottled BBQ sauce and 1 cup ketchup instead of Ketchup and Chili Sauce. You could probably use any BBQ sauce combo you liked. I did do the oven browning step, and put about half in the oven with some BBQ sauce at the end of cooking to kind of dry out and caramelize it. It was very good, but the other half that we tried just out of the crock pot was still quite good.

The sauce gets very thin, as crockpot liquids do. I may try rubbing the ribs the day before, and using less sauce in the crock pot next time, if I have the time to do it.

OK, so, I save this as a good base for any crockpot ribs recipe. I have made it four times now, following first the original recipe. It was just OK . Then I started adjusting according to other reviewer's recipes.  This is what I finally came up with that was the best. I used one cup catsup, otherwise it just tastes like catsup! 2 cups original barbecue sauce. 2 teaspoons of the hot sauce , 2 tablespoons vinegar. I added dried minced onions, 1/2 cup brown sugar, A tablespoon of the Worchester shire sauce.I think the key here is to not skip the oven part!

I cooked 6 lbs vice the 4 on the recipe.  I mis-adjusted the quantity of some ingredients .  I figured to use 1 1/2 times of each ingredient.  However i added double the sugar and oregano.  Cooked it anyway and found that the original quantiy of all ingredients would have sufficed.   Evryone loved the ribs.  Perfect doness, easy to prepare.  Will adjust the sauce by using a bottled brand next time just to compare.  Great Recipe!

Best way to do ribs in a slow cooker that I have found to date! The pre-cooking gets the fat out so the ribs don't release as much and sit in it in the slow cooker. I tweaked slightly by broiling the ribs as baking wasn't browning them.  I also made my own BBQ sauce that have flavors I prefer. The only other things I did differently was to add a little liquid to the slow cooker half way through cooking to prevent the BBQ sauce from sticking to the bottom and to broil quickly again at the end to "crispen" the sauce on the ribs. Delicious!!

I used less chili sauce (not into spicy food), and it was so very very good, I would recommend anyone who likes bbq to try this.

I did the recipe with roast pork meat for a really tasty pulled pork. Same directions just change the ribs.

I did not make any change to the recipe.  It was the best  ribs I have ever made. Baking in the oven  makes such a difference and they are not dry , just fall of the bone. Will for sure make this again

I used my own bbq sauce but otherwise cooked it exactly as the recipe called for and it was easy and delicious.  Meat was very tender and falling off the bone. Have done it this way every since.

Here's how to save 7 hours on this recipe and get the same results.  Put your favorite sauce on the robes, cover them with a foil tentand place in the oven at 325 degrees.   Take  out in 85 minutes.  They will be perfectly cooked and will fall off the bone.  I used to spend hours doing the ribs too.........not necessary, believe me and try it.

If ribs are not smoked on the grill or smokrr, they are not real ribs.  I think these look really good, but I would put them in Sweet Baby Ray sauce.

I love this recipe! I have experimented with many a rib recipe but I always come back to this because the basics are the best. Make sure to remove the membrane from the backside just use a paper towel to get a grab on it. I make two batches one just like this recipe states because it is very good the other is my way. I cook just like it says here - oven first then slow cooker. The second batch for rub I use Cavender's Greek Seasoning, course salt like grinder sea salt or Kosher salt and finally grinder pepper. Then, I put on a baking sheet and cover with saran wrap or foil and put in the frig for at least 2 hours (24 hours best) then I remove from frig and let sit for 20-30 minutes to get to room temp. In the slow cooker I put a cup of beef broth from a bullion cube and I layer the ribs (or if you have a lot you can put them in sideways). On each layer I put onion slices and fresh from a jar minced garlic. I slow cook for 8 hours then put in broiler finishing. The ribs are absolutely delicious as is but if I want BBQ sauce I use some Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy but usually they are all gone before we get to the BBQ sauce. I need to buy another slow cooker to make double batches at the same time because they only last about 10 minutes after cooking and they are gone!

Turned out well following recipe as written on high setting. Next time i will use less onion, more garlic and try it on low setting. Overall a good option for ribs when not able to use the outdoor grill.

The ribs turned out fall off the bone amazing. The only difference is is I just used a bbq sauce I love, and when the ribs were done I put them back into the oven for 20 minutes to give them a crispy outside. Perfect and easy recipe!!

Really yummy! How other point of the crockpot is to be easy so I don't do the rub part. I just put the yummy sauce all over the ribs and come home later and dig in!

This is my first review ever.  My family are rib snobs. I only ever slow cook my pork rubs outdoors on charcoal with a 24 hour marinated dry rub.  They're amazing, but you can imagine, this is not a mid-week meal.  I've been looking for a slow cooker version that doesn't get all soupy and greasy for ages.  The secrets really are the pre & post bake! I did the pre-bake the day before and put them in the fridge overnight.  Put them in the slow cooker (3 racks) in the AM, poured a 16 oz bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Hawaiian BBQ sauce over them, covered and cooked on low 11 hours (we work long hours).  I basted with some of the sauce from the slowcooker before I put them in the oven at the end, and I let them rest about 10-15 minutes before serving.

Next time, I'll probably pan sear them before serving to caramelize the sauce.

Hands down, this is the best method to prepare ribs ever. It's easy, lean, and Oooh so tender and succulent!!  I did an experiment with a house full of people, half prepared with this oven/crockpot method, and half with the boiling/grilling method. I used the same sauce on both so that wasn't an issue. They liked both, but all agreed the crockpot ribs were preferred. I like the ooey gooeyness of carmelized sauce on the ribs, so after cooking all day, I basted more sauce on the ribs and stuck them in the grill. Yummmmm!!!  I didn't use the sauce in this recipe though, because the reviews scared me away. I used the sauce on another recipe here for Barbecue Ribs. It uses Rum, which the alcohol burns out. Everyone loved it!

Excellent and very yummy!!  An easy weeknight dinner with mashed potatoes.  I used my mom's homemade chili sauce which just added so much to the flavour of these ribs.  The meat falls off the bone as it is so tender.

The family liked it!  The method of browning in the oven first is a good idea to add more flavor.   A strong tomato flavor overpowered the flavors from the meat and/or spices though.  May try this method again but sub in some bbq sauce and add a few more spices. Meat turned out tender.  Thank you!

I reduced the recipe to 1 1/2 lbs of ribs (3 servings) because it was just for my husband and me. I also left out both the hot sauce and the chili sauce and added a TBS of onion powder and more oregano. It was still awesome. I will make it again.

It's awesome if the changes in the reviews are followed. If you love the taste of ketchup, and many do, follow as posted.

I used BBQ sauce like others suggested. I also charred mine on the grill before putting them in the slow cooker. It created a lot of sauce, which was great. It's definitely a rib recipes that won't leave you disappointed.

I was so glad to find this recipe!  This is our first time making ribs in slow cooker and this method is fantastic.  We have modified the recipe because ketchup and vinegar did appeal to me.  I removed the membrane and cut the slabs into 4-rib portions. We used Cajun spice mix by Spice Hunter to rub the ribs and bake 15 min on each side.    We used KC Masterpiece, added 3 large splashes of hot sauce and 2 splashes of Sherry.  The 2 cups of sauce is just a perfect amount.  They cooked 1 hour on High and 2 h 45 min on Low and when I was turning them around I found that they were done!   falling off the bone, finger licking deliciousness !!!

I think a lower temperature of 325 to 350 degrees would probably be better. The temperature was too high and dried them out.

These turned out awesome! I used chili seasoning instead of chili sauce and had to sub basil for oregano. It had a strong vinegar taste because of the 4 tablespoons. Next time I will use McCormick applewood seasoning instead of the chili seasoning and only use 2 tablespoons of vinegar. But these ribs are so worth doing again! And Definitely going into my favorites!

I just used sweet baby rays, and slow cooked for 5 hours, then kept warm for 3 (work schedule).  Better than most restaurants.

This recipe deserves 5 stars for the cooking method alone. I had 4 pounds of ribs that needed to be cooked and no time to spend on preparation.  I followed the instructions by seasoning the ribs with garlic salt, black pepper and Tony's seasoning
then baked 15 minutes on each side, draining off the fat and then loading them in the crock pot with a bottle of BBQ sauce and let them cook away. Tender and delicious!

This recipe is a great idea that I have used again and again; thanks poster!  I have made some changes of course; one of them quite significant.  The first is that I don't really follow the BBQ sauce recipe as listed.  I either use whatever bbq sauce I have kicking around in the fridge or I do something similar to the posters list but tweaked to my families taste.  The most significant thing I do differently is that I broil the ribs AFTER they are cooked.  I am too busy at the start of the day to pre broil the ribs. so I throw them in the cooker as is with bbq sauce and leave them to cook; them quickly broil them on a cookie sheet  just before serving to get that crispy, caramelized outside that's so good.  Works great.

These were really good.  Everyone loved, best they've had.  Used one cup ketchup and one cup bbq sauce.   Used 2.5 lbs of ribs, so reduced all ingredients by about 1/4.

I have made this twice. The first time I followed the recipe as it is written. The ribs themselves were cooked to perfection but the sauce was horrible.

The second time I made this I just used my favorite BBQ sauce from a local restaurant and it was perfection across the board.

Like quite a few others, I changed the recipe up a bit as well. The first thing I changed was I marinated my ribs overnight in the following homemade marinade: hard cider (I used Strongbow), minced garlic, olive oil, steakhouse pepper, kosher salt & Worcestershire sauce. The next day when I was ready to start cooking, I then followed the instructions of cooking them for 15 minutes on each side in the 400 degree oven...I LOVE this step because it really does help drain off a good amount of fat before cooking them in the crockpot. I then added a small amount of hard cider in the bottom of the crockpot before adding a layer of ribs, poured another small amount of hard cider on those and I used Stubb's Sweet Heat BBQ sauce to put on top of the first layer of ribs. I added another layer of ribs and some more BBQ sauce before cooking for 6 hours and 45 minutes on low. After cooking in the crockpot I put the ribs on a foil lined baking sheet and covered the ribs in more BBQ sauce before putting them in a 425 degree oven for 6-7 minutes on each side, making sure to cover each side with BBQ sauce so it would have that nice glaze. This method created nice juicy ribs that had tender meat that was just falling off the bone! I will definitely be making again with these tweaks.

This is a great recipe. I've made it several times and use
"A very popular barbecue sauce" from this site.  Delicious !!!
The family loves it and we make the sauce ahead of time and use it on everything.

Like many of the other writers I didn't use the ingredients as listed but rather just the method of cooking. I used the rest of the bbq sauce I had (Sweet Baby Rays) about 1 cup and used an additional cup of ketchup mixed with Worcestershire sauce, pepper and a dash of hot sauce. I only used 2lbs of ribs and cooked for 7 1/2 hours. They were falling apart and delicious but parts were a tad dry. Next time I'll cook for 7 or 6 1/2.

I read other reviews about adding BBQ sauce in place of ketchup and I did so.  I cooked in the oven for the 15 mins, and cooked in the crock pot for 7 hrs on low.  They 'tasted' good, but were really dry/tough.  I may have over cooked.  I may try again, but not anytime soon.

The ribs were good, but not great. The idea of browning them first is a wonderful idea. However, after browning and than cooking in the crock pot, I felt the texture of  BABY BACK RIBS, were a tad chewy and a bit dry. I think this recipe would do so much better with your traditional pork ribs. Thank you for sharing.

So good! I made some changes based on the reviewer comments and what I had in my kitchen. I used bbq sauce in place of ketchup, and ketchup in place of chili sauce. I did add a bit of chili powder. I also didn't have any vinegar so I left that out. I would recommend turning the ribs frequently of at least basting them so they are constantly moist. Some of my ribs came out a bit dry and others were perfect.

This turned out great and everyone loved it!  The meat was failing off the bones.  I do have to agree with some of the others though.  The sauce wasn't our preference, but still good.  Next time I'll use a sauce we like versus going through the trouble of making this one.

I did modify the recipe a little bit. I used one cup of BBQ sauce and 1 cup of ketchup and left out the oregano.

My ribs came out dry, I don't know why. I'm certain I didn't overcook them. Maybe I browned then too long, but I followed the directions.

This recipe was scrumptious and easy. I followed suggestions of other reviewers of using my favorite BBQ sauce and they turned out great. The meat fell of the bones! Wow talk about finger licking good!

Delicious and fell off the bone but was a little too sweet for my taste. I prefer more spice so I will cut the brown sugar in half and add some red pepper flakes or cajun seasoning next time. Put in oven after cooking in slow cooker.

As written, this is just average as far as the taste of the sauce. The ribs themselves were tender and wonderful. But to make this the five star recipe that most are rating it (even though they admit in their reviews that they rated it so high AFTER making the following change) then just substitute your favorite BBQ sauce for the ketchup sauce called for in the recipe. That one simple change truly does make this a five star recipe and one that you are sure to make again and again! Also, I pulled them out of the crock pot after four hours on low and they were perfect!!

The cooking method is good, though cook time is too long. Mine were done at about 4 hours in the crock pot, thankfully I was home to notice and turned it to warm till dinner time. Sauce could use some work. Not as good as ribs on the smoker but I will definitely use this method again when I need an easy crock pot meal the whole family will eat!

Way too much vinegar for my taste. I followed some of the other reviewers and used only 2 tbsp of vinegar and it was still way too sour. Also, the cook time was too long if you sear the ribs first. They're already mostly cooked in the oven, so they would only need 3 - 4 hours in the slow cooker to cook in the sauce. I used bbq sauce in place of the ketchup and salsa in place of the chili sauce. Doubt I'll try it again.

Terrific and easy!  Be sure to pay attention to how spicy the chili sauce you use is, and adjust for your taste.  Extremely tender and the whole family loved them!

This recipe ended up tasting way too strongly of ketchup, if I were to make it again, I would substitue BBQ for the ketchup. That being said, I will probably find a different recipe the next time we have ribs.

The ribs came out great, but the cook time is much shorter than the recipe shows. I checked the meat with a thermometer (being careful not to touch bone) and the ribs were done between 2 and 3 hours.

My husband didn't enjoy it too much, but my 3 year old did (I don't eat meat) I made Crockpot ribs with basically just Coca Cola and my hubby said he enjoyed those more. I can't lie though, this recipe has my house smelling delicious!!

It was a hit when I made this.  The meat was so tender it just fell off the bone, which I like, although it's not good for presentation of serving ribs.  I wound up discarding the bones before serving.  A little too much ketchup though.........next time I will try and tweek it a bit.  I usually steam bake my ribs, but when it's hot outside, I hate heating up the house.  The slow cooker is the way to go!

because this was for the 'little ones' too, I used cubed boneless pork western ribs. only change to the sauce: less ketchup, more chili sauce and I used apple cider vinegar. Next time I'll also add some smoke flavoring. Everyone loved this, from the kids all the way to Gramps.

Delicious!  My husband gave me two thumbs up.  I didn't use ketchup, used Stubb's Sweet Heat.  I threw in a jalapeno for a little more heat.  I put them on the grill for about 5 minutes on each side to toast them up a bit.  Great!  

Thanks for sharing!

I did change the recipe to taste. I always swap out Worcestershire for A-1 Steak Sauce because I don't like anything made with anchovies. For a nice sticky BBQ sauce use honey in place of most of the brown sugar. I gave this 3 stars due to the lack of a smoke source. 2 tsp of Wrights liquid hickory smoke added to the mix adds the smokiness needed to make this have a BBQ flavor.

I was inspired by this recipe.  I seasoned the ribs and placed it in my slow cooker first.  Covered it with half a bottle of dark beer and a mixture of BBQ sauce, brown sugar, chilie sauce, oregano and a splash of soy sauce.  Let it cook in the slow cooker on low for 6 hours and then finished it on our charcoal BBQ, brushing it with a good quality bbq sauce.  Kids and hubby lived it.

The pre-roasting is a great idea! My only change was substituting half the ketchup with barbecue sauce, as suggested by others.

This was an awesome recipe. I was worried about the ribs becoming slimy, but they turned out very tasty. I added more that a dash of hot sauce. We like our ribs spicy! I will be making this again soon!!

These were great.  The sauce was a little sweet, but savory as well, and we made them for my 12 yr olds birthday.  Everyone loved them and the sauce was just right to spoon onto mashed potatoes.  I used western style boneless ribs and instead of putting them in the slow cooker, I baked them on each side for 400, per the recipe, then I drained all the fat juices, covered with sauce and put back in the oven on 350 for about 2 hours.  We loved it.

I've made this recipe twice, both times the result has turned out great. Definitely a "fall-off-the-bone" rib recipe that will keep you wanting more. The substitutes I did was change the ketchup to BBQ sauce and vinegar to red wine vinegar (as suggested by several others). The result was very tasty! I found that the second time around doing this recipe, the sauce got very greasy/oily (even though I did bake them beforehand). So I think the next time, I'm going to cut off any visible fatty parts and hope that the sauce still stays thick. 

Since I was home during this slow cook, I rotated the ribs at the halfway mark and sauced the tops. I'm not sure if it's needed but I've done it both times with great results :)

Made these tonight and WOW. Barely needed to cook 6 hours, the meat was literally falling off the bone in the slow cooker.  These were so yummy!  Subbed Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce for the ketchup, added some fresh orange juice to help tenderize the meat and didn't put in chili sauce because I didn't have any.  This was amazing and I can't wait to make again!  For reference, I used Trader Joe's Baby Back Ribs - they were SO meaty and tender. Couldn't eat more than 6 ribs!!

These were delicious! The meat fell right off the bone. They were falling apart while I was removing them from the slow cooker.  This will definitely be a repeat dinner in our house. Thanks for a great alternative to baking and grilling ribs!

I used our favorite BBQ sauce and cut the ribs into serving size portions so the rack would fit in my slow cooker.  My boys thought they was excellent.  I precooked the ribs per the recipe's instructions, but they were falling off the bone tender.  I obviously couldn't put them in the oven to caramelize as other reviewers suggested.

I made this and it was fantastic! It was the 1st time I ever made ribs in a crockpot and loved them! The meat was so tender and juicy. My Husband is a Exutive Chef and he also loved them. We've had BBQ Pork sandwiches for the last 2 days. I plan on always making ribs this way. Thanks!!!

This was OK, but my family didnt like the sauce. It was a bit too sweet for us. The ribs however were tender but not "falling off the bone" and I slow cooked them for 6.5 hours. I would maybe try a different sauce recipe next time.

Delicious, easy and the house smelled great all day! We added a little cumin, chipotle pepper powder and siracha to step up the heat.  Also, charred them on the grill for just a few minutes on each side right before serving.  Out of this world!!!

Replaced half the ketchup with BBQ sauce. Kept all the ingredients for a multi layer of flavors! Most premade sauces have little or no brown sugar or Worcester sauce. Used Frank's Hot Sauce and an onion  chunked on top.

Baby back ribs were falling off the bone after 4 hrs.  I removed the silver-skin.  Perhaps I should have left it on, i.e. to hold things together more.  Come back moist & tender as leftovers also.

I thought these were great.  It takes a little longer to prepare in the morning than I would have liked - waiting 30 minutes to cook - but it was worth it.  My husband thought they were okay.  He likes the char taste of ribs on a grill.  Next time I think we'll fire up the grill at the end so we have the best of both worlds for our tastes.  I made the barbecue dressing as stated with no changes.  It was great but I can see that you could obviously substitute your own if you have a favorite.  The sauce was a little runny for my tastes due to the crockpot all day so I added some bottle sauce to my plate and dipped the ribs in as desired.
Addition - I made these a 2nd time and it was great.  I used country style ribs and they still came out terrific.  My husband like them better this time.  I totally flubbed the sauce and it still was good.  I was halving recipe but ended up doubling the Worcestershire sauce.  Still came out decent with my mistake.

This was the most fabulous recipe.  Instead of using 2 cups of ketchup I used 1 cup ketchup and 1 cup bbq sauce (I had a few 1/2 full bottles in my frig).  I didn't want it to taste ketchupy which someone remarked about.  Anyway, it was so tender and juicy.  I plan on making this again, and soon.  Ribs are on sale this week so that's on the top of my grocery list.

I absolutely loved this recipe, Just this summer I have done it 4 times already.  Not one negative comment (even when I was not listening).  the beauty of it is it's simplicity.  I increased the portion size to 1 lb/person because of it's falling off the bone you loose the bone weight.  40 min to whip together, sit back and smell it for 8 hours. YYYUUUUMMMM !

I did not use the recipe for the sauce. I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce.  This is a quick, convenient alternative when you don't have time to bake and then broil or grill the ribs.  Ribs were tender.

No complaints here!  Very simple to make, and very tasty!  
My dinner guests were 2 hours late, so I turned the temp setting to warm.  The ribs were still the star of the show, and they were fall-off-the-bone tender.

Great way to make ribs without a grill!!!! I used a prepared BBQ sauce (next time I will make the sauce as directed). Browning the ribs in the oven first really made a difference with the finished product. They were still nice and cruchy and saucy on the outside and falling-apart on the inside. This is my favorite of the slow cooker ribs recipes by far! I don't really plan on trying another. Delicious!

I did like everything about this recipe but wanted to let people know what happened when I made it.  I used country style pork ribs (some had bones and some didn't) as other reviewers suggested but since they were sooooo fatty, I decided to do a major trim job and rid the meat of as much of the fat as I could.  I remember others talking about taking some fat off too.  Well, I think you need to leave some fat on so that they stay tender.  While the dish was saucy enough, my meat was not tender.  I cooked them on low for 8 hours but the meat was NOT falling off the bone as I expected.  Next time, I will not trim so much.

The ribs turned out great, but I didn't care for the sauce.  Will try and make a different sauce for next time.

The best ribs i have ever had in my life. I followed the recipe to a t, i found the end result was very spicey (my hot sauce was franks extra hot). OMG they where juicy and the meat just fell off the bone though 100% amazing loved it. I will try the other variations as well though to cut back on the spice but still fantastic as is as well

This was decent in taste and certainly simple to prepare.  I would recommend this for anyone who doesn't have the time to cook ribs on a grill or who just wants a filling meal with little fuss.

Wonderful recipe.  I made a little change and used 1 1/2 C of chili sauce and 4 dashes of hot sauce.  I also use country ribs because they are meatier and juicier than baby backs.  
I often get asked to make this recipe when we have get togethers with friends and/or family.

I made these per the recipe, including making the sauce as listed, and it made my husband speak in French to his plate. He was beyond happy with them. The meat was falling off the bone and the spice had a good kick to it. I was liberal with the Worcestershire, chili sauce, and hot sauce to bring out the spice and it was perfect. I used the same method to make a BBQ sauce for chicken on the grill and everyone loved the sauce. They couldn't believe I made my own BBQ sauce!

Awesomely Delicious. I tried to be a little more creative.  If you add just a little of garlic powder and barbecue powder and double the hot sauce recommended dose.  It made it even better.  Was not spicy at all.  If you like spicy foods, then use 5 or even more dashes of spices.  Just got my slow cooker 2 days ago and so far my family and I LOVE IT! Enjoy!

AMAZING! This has made it to the regular meal rotation at my house. I went with the suggestions of using BBQ sauce in place of half of the ketchup. Cooked on low for seven hours. Then put them on a foil lined baking dish, with some of the sauce poured on top, in the oven for thirty minutes. They came out carmelized and falling off the bones. Incredible!

Didn't get to try these, but the expressions on my boyfriend's and family's faces said enough for me. I did add some BBQ sauce and cut back a little on the chili sauce and ketchup, but used everything else as the recipe states.

Since I didn't have all the ingredients I substituted a few things. OMG! This was amazing. Sweet and spicy without either being overpowering.Definitely going to make this sauce and try it out on other meats. I did add a little hot sauce but in hindsight I don't think it was necessary.

My substitutions were as follows:

1/2 cup of horseradish sauce for 1/2 cup of the chili sauce

1/4 cup each of turbinado sugar and molasses for 1/2 cup packed brown sugar

Really liked this recipe, I tweeked it a little that is what makes this recipe really good its very easy to make it your own.  I used BBQ sauce instead of ketchup, took out a few things and added a few more, I also put them back in a 400 degree oven for about ten minutes after I took them out of the slow cooker it carmelized the sauce, my family loved these ribs will definetly make them again.

Was surprised at how well the recipe turned out. I actually used beef ribs instead of pork ribs. I also used store bought bbq sauce instead of making the sauce from scratch. 

Ribs were so good they were falling of the bone!

Best ribs ever! I substituted barbecue sauce for ketchup, left out chili sauce, hot sauce and brown sugar because I didn't have any on hand. I just used some pepper I had at home instead. I will be making this again soon.

Most tender ribs!  Kids don't really like spicy so I used only 1/4 cup of chili garlic sauce and skipped the dash of hot sauce and it suits our taste buds.  I make it into an open face sandwich:  toast a thick piece of texas toast first, top it with the ribs (without the bones) and a slice of muenster cheese and toast again enough to melt cheese and it is to die for!

I'm still new to using the slow cooker and these ribs were awesome!  I didn't have high expectations since they weren't grilled but they are just as good as restaurant grilled ribs.  I mixed a bunch of seasonings to make a dry rubbed and rubbed them down the night before and let them sit in the fridge overnight.  I baked them like the recipe said then put them in the slow cooker.  I changed the sauce a fair amount - I used a bottle of bbq sauce, white vinegar, a splash of rice wine vinegar, lots of seasonings, hot sauce, Worcestershire, and some brown sugar.  I cooked them on low for 8 hours and they sat on warm another hour or two before I got home.  They were very flavorful and they fell right off the bone.

Delicious!  The only thing I did was use 1 C BBQ sauce & 1 C Ketchup instead of 2 cups. I also added a tablespoon or so of hot pepper flakes.  I will make these again! Thanks!

My husband and I love these.  My Mother came to visit and we had these, she left with the recipe so she could make them for my sister.  I followed the recipe exactly and have made several times.

Very good and easy. But it made way too much sauce. I'd consider making less sauce next time.

I thought the ribs turned out very tender. I would suggest to not skip the oven step. I followed suggestions for changing the sauce as others had written in the reviews, such as adding BBQ sauce instead of ketchup and ketchup in place of chilli sauce. I did not care for the changes. I loved  the idea of making them in the slow cooker. I will try making the sauce as listed next time and see how it turns out.

Considered using KC but followed the recipe as written.  My family was crazy for it!  They saved the extra sauce since it was so good.

My husband and I really enjoyed these ribs.  The sauce was very good and the meat just fell off the bone.  Next time I'll invite some friends to join us.  i just love being able to get things ready early so I can enjoy the rest of my day.

Made this recipe with just 1 change due to other reviews. Half ketchup and half barbecue sauce. I thought it was just ok, but my boyfriend really enjoyed it. After 6 hours in my slow cooker, the meat literally fell off the bones.

My family and I really loved this recipe although I did make a few changes instead of using Ketchup and chili sauce I used 1 can tomato soup one can water and 1 cup of Bull's eye BBQ sauce and it was so delicious I would recommend this recipe to any and all. Enjoy!

I used Country Style ribs, boneless, and did the pre-baking per the recipe.  I believe this caused the  ribs to come out very dry.  Next time I'll skip this step.  I used the modified version of the sauce (2 c bbq sauce, 1 c ketchup) and it was delicious.  The deliciousness of the sauce overcame the dryness of the ribs, keeping the dish from being a total failure.

So easy!  I didn't know why I was so intimidated by ribs before!

I made these in my oven because my crockpot has a funny taste, and they were wonderful! With some of the leftover sauce I had, I added some green pepper and onion and made lucious ham bbq's! Yummy!

I have made these ribs twice now. Once with the recipe for the sauce and once just using hickory smoked barbecue sauce out of the bottle. Both were awesome. It's really important to put them in the oven for that short period of time. I cut two large racks in half this time for company and the only thing left was a pile of bones. Really great recipe.

My family loved these ribs!  They were fall of the bone tender.  We used our favorite bq sauce instead of recipe sauce.  Easy to prepare and so nice to come home from work and dinner is ready.

OMG!!! I made these tonight for my Scottish husband who has never in his life eaten ribs..Yet more of my country's food for him to try. He ate, he ate, and he ate some more! I've always boiled ribs first, but thanks Suzanne..will always bake them from now on. I, too, used BBQ sauce..about 3/4 cup for 4 servings and added ketchup to fill the cup measure.  Not sure if I can mention a brand but it was the one with bourbon in it lol. This is a fantastic recipe and it will be permanently enshirined in my recipe box. They fall of the bone..and are soooo yummy..

It came out real nice, with lots of complex flavors, a nice alternative to traditional BBQ.   I omitted the hot sauce and added about 5 oz of tomato sauce, and also added some garlic salt.

Made exactly as described.  As others have said, the meat literally falls off the bone - had trouble getting the ribs out of the pot!  Took away one star because although the sauce was tasty, it was too thin and watery for my taste.  It was kind of swimming in an orange grease - yuck!  I will make again, but will likely use my favorite bottled variety of barbeque sauce (Cattleman's) instead.

These were very tender. I have only had ribs one time in my life (is that weird?) and that was when I was young. I now know that I don't really like ribs. :-( They are pretty fatty and a lot of effort for not a lot of meat. ANYWAY, I made exactly as stated and the sauce was very tasty and the meat was falling off the bone. If I liked ribs I would make again.

Awesome ribs! I added cayenne pepper and reduced the amount of ketchup used.  I also added a dash of liquid smoke.

I just got a slow cooker for my birthday. I have never made ribs before, but after making these today I know I will def be making ribs again. These were ssooo good!  My boyfriend was joking about how his plate looked like a bone yard after he was done(because he had so many) I made this with the red white and blue slaw salad from this website, and a mexican corn bread also from this site. Thanks for posting, this recipe is def a keeper in my house!

I halved the recipe and switched out barbecue sauce for ketchup. These burnt to a crisp in my slow cooker (on low for about 9 hours.)

This recipe was fantastic. I think the differences in reviews can be chalked up to personal preferences in barbeque sauce. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used salsa instead of chili sauce (its what I had on hand), and I browned the ribs before cooking in a frying pan instead of in the oven. It was a huge hit with my whole family. Thanks!

Adjusted the recipe according to suggestions. With the changes it is a 5 star recipe, but as written, I give it 4. Crock pot ribs are the way to go though!

We made this using veal ribs (tendrons de veau). My husband who loves spare ribs thought it tasted pretty good ! Like others suggested I used a bbq sauce which was on the sweeter/tomatoey side and thus completely omitted the ketchup. I used the rest of the ingredients as per recipe. I caramalised it for the last 45 mins in the crockpot by turning on to High and leaving the lid open. Will do again.

With a little modification to the sauce because I was out of some things and had more of another, I followed the recipe as is and let's just say that this made my husbands night!  He ate 3 pounds just by himself... Or at least that is what it seemed!  Thank you for a great recipe!  Can't wait for baby back ribs to go on sale again!!!!

These were fabulous. I also suggest using half the ketchup and then i used an entire bottle of Stubs bbq sauce.  Also placed them under the broiler right before serving. They looked like they came right off the grill. My husband said he would never admit to cooking slow cooker ribs to his friends, but he prefers this recipe over the grill.

The ribs just fell of the bone! So delicious! I would cook them on the lower side of the time frame, some places were a little over cooked. I subbed chili sauce with a cup of chipotle bbq sauce. Great and easy recipe!

ANGRY! – Do not put 1 cup, or event ½ cup of chili sauce in this recipe! It must be a typo…my fault for even attempting to add that much chili sauce. Be warned…you will RUIN the meal if you add the amount of chili sauce specified in the instructions. SUZANNE2802  please correct you recipe. 5 stars otherwise.

Thought this recipie was very good... a few additions/substitutions I made were: dijon mustard, BBQ sauce instead of ketchup, fresh oregano and garlic added, full bodied beer (either right to the sauce or dumped into the slow cooker). Delicious!

FANTASTIC!  I took others' advice and substituted 1 cup of spicy barbecue sauce for a cup of the ketchup.  I rubbed the ribs in cayenne in addition to the salt and pepper before roasting them.  The key was to buy the high quality ribs from Whole Foods.  They turned out wnderfully spicy and fall-off-the-bone delicious.  I will be making this recipe again!

Followed recipe except substituted store-bought Honey BBQ sauce for the ketchup.  Everything else I followed exactly.  The ribs were fantastic!  Gobbled up by 4 little kids and one dad.  Will definitely do these again!  Oh, I did follow the suggestion of putting them under the broiler before serving to carmelize them.  Worked great.

It was good, but I wish I had read the reviews and substituted another BBQ sauce for some or all of the ketchup as I think it would have been better.  I did substitute Red wine vinegar for the vinegar.

This is definitely a keeper. I'm not really a ribs fan to begin with, but, I made this recipe and followed it exactly as written. Everyone in my family enjoyed it, including me, and they all asked what was in it and not to lose this recipe. This recipe is delicious and the ribs were so tender.

Used the sauce recommended by Peachesncream2-very tasty.  Otherwise followed instructions. turned out well - so much depends on the quality of the ribs used!  Cooking method is great for a cold winter day.

Super easy and fall off the bone goodness.  I tossed them on the bbq to finish them off a bit.  I also give the ribs a final glaze of honey and cayenne pepper.

Great recipe.  Easy, delicious, love the baking first idea.  I didnt have chili sauce, so I just subbed the ketchup/chili sauce for BBQ sauce.  Left the rest the same. Big hit.

this recipe is the bomb and the sauce is so yum!  My husband is picky about his meat...but he asked when I was making them again!  I used country style ribs (just cuz they are cheaper) and the recipe worked fine!

Yum! Bake or grill at the end to make the sauce thicken. So, good and easy. You must not Skip baking them in the beginning.

Add more BBQ sauce for flavor.  I also used on boneless ribs which may make  a difference.

These turned out fantastic! I altered the recipe. I used 2 cups of Sweet Ray's BBQ sauce and 1 cup of Ketchup with 5 lbs of ribs.  There was a little bit more sauce that I needed.  The meat was so tender it fell off the bone.  I also put the ribs in the oven at 400F for 10 minutes at the end to carmelize the sauce.  The ribs were a hit! My husband along with my guests would not stop raving about them.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Best ribs ever! They nearly brought my husband to his knees - he's asked for it again and again!  I changed up the sauce a little bit because I like a little more kick:  1 c jack daniels bbq sauce, 1 c ketchup, worcestershie sauce, and extra tabasco sauce for some fire.  These ribs can't be beat.

My husband was very noisy eating it.. hard to sit near him. He was in heaven. The only changes I made was, 1 cup of Sweet Ray's BBQ Sauce, (usually make my own, but didn't have time) a 1/2 cup of ketchup, and 1/2 cup of a sesame ginger dressing I got at Trader Joe's, though did not add any vinegar. Very tasty, and loved the aroma in the house!

Fabulous! Cut the recipe in half, as I was only cooking for my boyfriend and I. Followed it pretty much exactly, minus the hot sauce, as we didn't have any. After about 5 hours, I went to check on it and it was falling off the bone! Took it out of the crock pot and put it back in the oven on 375 for 20 min to allow the sauce to thicken...and voila! SOO GOOD! Thanks so much for this easy and delicious recipe! It was my first time using my crock pot and I couldn't have asked for anything better!

The best slow cooker rib recipe I've tried!  The sauce is excellent, the ribs were tender. I did cut the sauce recipe in 1/2, and we had plenty.  Everyone, even my one year old, loved them!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

Quite tasty but way too much sauce. I think about 1/2 of the amount would be perfect.

This cooking method is great.  I cut a slab of ribs in half in order to fit it in my Crockpot and I used my own bbq sauce.  The one thing I had to do after the ribs were all cooked was take them out, empty out almost all but a few tablespoons sauce and pour in fresh sauce before I cut the ribs and took them to a party.  The sauce I removed was kind of nasty after all those hours but it sure served its purpose.  The ribs were falling off the bone and people were scraping the pieces of ribs off the bottom.

I was off for the day and wanted to surprise my wife with dinner. We have been wanting ribs but our current recipe is a lot of prep work. I have come to love useing the slow cooker and found this recipe.   WOW...it was easy and fast and very very tasty.  The meat fell off the bones.  My wife was really impressed how delicious the ribs were and with me preparing them. It's a keeper!!!! Thumbs up for this recipe.

This was really good-- I think I might cook it a little less than 8 hours because some edges were a little dry.  The flavor of the sauce was good-- even my picky rib eater really liked it.  It was very easy to make too!

I meat was perfect! I didn't use the sauce recipe. Plus I followed a suggestion by another person. After 8 hrs. I took the meat out of the crockpot and put it back in the over @ 425 for 30 min. I thickened the sauce with some corn starch. It was great!

I didn't use the sauce, and instead used bottled sauce that I like  Followed the rest of recipe though, and the ribs were freakin' awesome!  The outside was crispy and a bit blackened, and the meat fell right off the bone.  Delicious!

very tasty but came out almost TOO tender, and little bit oily. Still was a hit though, as we dont have a BBQ is this is the best way to prepare ribs for us!

This recipe is awesome.  My husband is very peticular about ribs.  We eat out sometimes and when I think the ribs are good, he usually complains.  Anyway, he loved these!! I will definately make again and even try on the grill.  This sauce is great.  Hubby even suggested trying it with chicken.  Thank you so much for posting it.

I really loved the cooking method. Honestly, I didn't bother trying the sauce. Based on all the reviews, I didn't want to take the chance the sauce did indeed taste like glorified ketchup (no offense). Plus I've made ALOT of homemade barbeque sauces and they  unfortunately never taste as good as the bottle. The closest I've ever come to good sauce is Big Al's KC Bar-B-Q Sauce (on this site), but my hubbie didn't like it. So I gave it 4 stars for tender fall-off-the-bone meat with store bought barbeque sauce-thanks!

This came out far too soft for us....the sauce is pretty good, but I'd be more inclined to use this as a pulled pork recipe.

AMAZING! The only change made was to used 1 cup of ketchup and 1 cup of BBQ sauce. My boneless ribs turned out super tender and very tasty.  This will become a regular recipe used in my house.

These turned out really well. I followed the recipe pretty much to a T. I used Bennett's chili sauce and a different cut of pork-boneless, but they got so tender and my 6 year old daughter had at least three helpings and everyone else came back for more as well. Next time I might add some onions and garlic, maybe a little mustard but overall was a very good recipe. Made lots of sauce so I am shredding the rest to have shredded pork sandwiches today. Thanks for the recipe!

I took the advice of other reviewers and put garlic salt and pepper on my ribs first, then added only a tiny portion of ketchup (I hate it!) but left everything else the same.  My results?  My 5 and 6 year old were asking for more before they even finished the first rib!  Will be keeping this and making again and again...and again!

These were delicious! I used the Country-style Ribs so we had a lot of leftovers, which worked out perfect so I could make Pork Stew. I love living out of my crockpot on my busy days! Thanks for a great recipe!

Great sauce!  Although I added some extra hot sauce, the rest was the same. Didn't use my slow cooker as it was too small, but the end result was fantastic, will use this again!!

I really enjoyed these.  I used short ribs and browned the meat beforehand.  I also added some chili powder and red pepper for a little kick. Everyone really enjoyed it and it was yummy.

Excellent, as others have suggested I did use half barbecue sauce and half ketchup... also the chili sauce I used was from the Asian section of supermarket, I used the "sweet" one...this really is a fool proof recipe that can be used just as suggested or with some additional ingredients if the cook wants to try!

My age must be showing but some of you "older" folks may remember mom bottling home-made chili sauce back-in- the-day. My folks always ate it on eggs.  I use it in a sauce for meat loaf and for home-made Russian dressing.  I've never made chili sauce from scratch but it's easy to find in the ketchup section of the grocery store.  It's just a sweet tomato based sauce mixed with a relish of onions, pickles etc.  It's not hard to find.  The sauce referred to here is not Asian chili sauce which is good but not as spicy as the Asian sauce.

I am a rib lover, and my husband is not so much.  So I was a little selfish and made ribs anyway!
I changed a few things:
Omitted the chili sause
Used 2.5 C bbq sauce
Used 1/2 C ketchup
Browned on grill for 10 mins each side and cut to 3 rib incremets before putting in the slow cooker.  I mixed all the ingredients in the slow cooker as hubby was browing, then added the cut up ribs.  Cooked only about 6 hours, then placed in oven for 10 minutes in baking pan on 300'.
Very tender and yummy, but didn't crumble off the bone.  Hubby was stuffed and enjoyed them very much!!

Firstly, let me say these ribs are awesome!!  I also substituted BBQ sauce for ketchup, YUM!  For those of you confused about "chili sauce", I was stumped too, so I asked a friend that is a professional cook.  He told me to look in the Asian food section, and there it was!  That is the last place I would have thought to look, but it is something very commonly used in Thai cooking.  There are 2 kinds: sweet chili sauce and regular chili sauce.  I used the sweet, but I'm sure either would be fine.  They add a nice bite to these ribs, especially when paired with the hot sauce.  Great recipe, will make it again and again!  Serve with au gratin potatoes and cole slaw!!  :)

These were super yummy!  I did substitute 1 cup of prepared barbeque sauce for 1 cup of the ketchup, just because I was almost out of ketchup.  I will definitely make these again!

This recipe was good with a few changes. Did 1 cup ketchup, 1 cup Jack Daniel's barbecue sauce, 2 Tbs. brown sugar, 1 tablespoon honey, 1 Tbs. liquid smoke, and 1 Tbs. hot sauce and 1 Tbs. dried onion. I did put the ribs under the broiler after cooking them in the slow cooker. Just put them in for 5 minutes.

Not sure what all these low star reviews are talking about.  I thought these ribs were outstanding!  I am not a big fan of ribs but these were the best I have ever tasted and I followed the recipe.  I will definitely be making these again really soon.  I also like how simple it is to cook these.

This was an amazing recipe!  After browning the ribs I cooked them in the slow cooker for 10hrs.  The only thing that confused me a bit was the "Chili Sauce?"  Found a can but it had Tamale's in it...go figure?  I still drained the sauce and used it as dictated by the recipe.  10hrs later my wife and I had a feast.  I made my German/American Potato salad to go along with it which was the perfect compliment...Try it!

So convenient and delicious. I was a bit skeptical about the chili sauce as this isn't one of my favorite things but I have to say this was fantastic.I also replaced one cup of ketchup with one cup of barbecue sauce. Thanks for this recipe. It goes into the keeper box.

These were only okay for me.  Maybe I just don't like the way they fall off of the bones when you cook them in the slow cooker, but I didn't really care much for the flavor of this one either.

I did what Brookie suggested except I left out the sugar and did add the hot sauce. I also brazed both sides on the BBQ for 10 minutes per side rather than using the oven then put in the slow cooker for the day with the sauce.  Tasty, the meat just fell off the bones. I highly recommend this recipe.

Very good.  I didn't have enough ketchup so I used about 1 cup ketchup, 1.5 cups sweet pepper chili sauce and 1 cup of light barbeque sauce.  Very good recipe.  6 hours was perfect time and ribs were very tender.  
Thanks for sharing!

I loved this recipe..the only thing I did was add a little more brown sugar..because I have little ones and they don't like spicy. I use it all the time and gave this recipe to a few friends and they loved it as well.

Oh My Goodness! These are soooo good! A few things I did different...I browned my ribs in the skillet (seasoned w/ salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder). I used a bottled bque sauce that I jazzed up, coated all the ribs in sauce, and let cook on low. It only took 6 hrs. for them to be fall off the bone tender. Great recipe for winter.

My boyfriend is STILL talking about these ribs!  I made my own BBQ sauce adding everything but the kitchen sink....A sweet BBQ sauce with honey added to it was delish!

I seasoned the ribs with salt, pepper, grilling spices, and garlic powder.  Put them in the oven (350?) 20 minutes on each side.
Then, covered them with my BBQ sauce, let them set over night because the plan was to put them in the crock pot when I woke up for th rest of the day.  Cooked them 8 hours on LOW while at school.  Put them in the oven for 30 minutes with more BBQ sauce on top and....YUM.  They fell of the bone!

I made this for a Chinese New Year party and my dad thought I bought it from Cosco and baked it. My hubby loved it so much. It was very tender and flavorful.  Nice texture when returned to the oven for 350 degree for 15-20 mins afterwards.  I used 1 bottle of katch-up and 1 bottle of BBQ sauce for a 8 pounder. The bones came off for low 8 hours, so I will try making it in low for 6 hours and use less vingar next time. Definitely will make it again!

Excellent!  I did add to oven for a few minutes before serving.  It helps to set the sauce and brown them up.  I, also, skimmed the fat and added cornstarch to the sauce to thicken it up.

This recipe was amazing. I put a bottle of my favorite barbecue sauce on top instead of making my own. The ribs turned out to be falling off the bone and so tasty, what a great way to make ribs.

I didn't have all the ingredients for this but made substitues instead.  I rubbed the rack with the spices and then used BBQ sauce and Franks Red Hot Sauce and it was amazing!  I have tried ribs on the George Foreman and that wasn't good at all.  This was easy and yummy!!

Very very easy.  Definately follow the other feedback and don't cook any longer than 6 hours, probably less than that.

Also, I prefer a little more "kick" in my sauce, so I will be adding some pepper flakes powder next time.

DEFINATELY WILL USE THIS RECIPE AGAIN.

I used thai style chili sauce that was sweetened and left all of the other ingredients the same. I did however add about 1/2 - 3/4 cup of bbq sauce to the mix to give it a smokey flavor.  These turned out awesome!  I cooked them on low-med for 5 hours and they were tender and fell off the bone.

These were so great. I had no idea what "chili sauce" was...must be a generational gap. So, I just substituted with our favorite bottled bar-b-que sauce and it was great. I made this on Christmas Eve and it made for an easy meal.

I loved this recipe! I substituted BBQ sauce for the ketchup and only used 1/4 cup brown sugar. I also made my own substitute for chili sauce.

These turned out pretty good.  Like the other reviews, there were substitutions like bbq sauce, i also added some crushed red pepper, garlic powder, and a little honey.  Pretty good overall.

Followed it almost exactly.  No oregano and used bnls country style ribs.  Great flavor.  It makes a ton of sauce for rice or another side dish.

These were great. I forgot the chili sauce but used some hot and spicy ketchup instead. I think the chili sauce would add something but these were fantastic as they were. I served them with scalloped potatoes

I love how simple this recipe is! It's my favourite for ribs!
I leave out the sugar, vinegar and hot sauce and I only cook them for 4 hours at the most.

The cooking method is GREAT.  They come out SO tender!  The second time I made them I cut out the brown sugar because they were too sweet and replaced the ketchup with BBQ sauce, added a few more dashes of hot sauce and it was MUCH BETTER!

Freaking amazing - a hit at the potluck I went to.  I use 6# of rubs cut into 3 bone sections, and just 1 1/2 my recipe.  I did however use 1/3 cup Dale's Seasoning Sauce.  It made the place smell sooo good while they cooked.  I cooked them on high for 2 hours, then low for 3 hours as I needed them done in 6 hours instead of 8.  The other hour was transit time and when I unplugged the wrong plug!!!!  YUMMY

I just made this recipe today. It came out great!! My husband said it was the best I've made yet. The meat fell off the bone!! Great flavor too. I did cut the recipe in half, so it was just enough for him & I. Next time, tho I think I will only bake in oven for 15 mins. Its a keeper!!

We had this last night and my husband is still spontaneously commenting on how absolutely amazing these ribs were!  He is SUCH a huge meat eater and his family makes the "best ribs", so these had very big expectations to live up to- and they surpassed them! :-)  The fact that the meat literally falls off the bone is best part... and, as others did, I used 2 cups BBQ sauce and 1 cup ketchup, and seasoned the ribs with fajita seasoning (I didn't have salt in the house, but the fajita seasoning has salt in it).  Thanks for the great and super easy recipe!

My boyfriend doesn't get home for a couple more hours for dinner, but I couldn't resist trying these ribs now...they are amazing!!!  Literally falling off the bone tender!  I did use my favourite rib sauce instead of ketchup and left out the oregano (cause I don't really like oregano) and they are the best.  Now that bbq season is over and snow is on the way, this is how I will cook my ribs all winter long!

Although the meat was a little on the dry side for my tastes, the sauce was great though! (I used a Vietnamese chili garlic sauce.)  Our neighbors loved the recipe even more than we did!

Great Ribs! I used 2 cups of Jack Daniel's original BBQ sauce and 1 cup ketchup. I omitted the oregano, chili sauce, and hot sauce. I did use the other indgredients as directed. After having them in the crockpot for about 5 hours I put them in the oven at 325 degrees for 1 hour. 30 min would have sufficed because they came out looking burnt but they tasted awesome. Thanks for sharing!!

Good, but not great.  I took the suggestion of others and used 1 c. ketchup and 2 c. BBQ sauce.  The taste was more like 3 1/2 stars, but the ease of preparation and tenderness of the meat made this meal a 4 star.  I will use this method again in the future, but will continue to tweak the sauce until it is just right.

I cheated as some of the others did and used bottled BBQ sauce.  These ribs were WONDERFUL!!!  They were tender and delicious.  Definitely easier and just as good as grilling.

I made this recipe this weekend and my guest loved them. I actually browned them a bit before putting them in the crock pot. I also added a few finely chopped onions. They were so tender. I had a small bowl left over and I shredded them up for BBQ hash the next night. It was delicious!

Very tasty ribs. Only problem was that I followed the suggestion to simmer for 20 min prior to slow cooking. Slow cooked for 6 hrs on low - came out too cooked in that meat fell off bones immediately when serving - Not good - over-cooked. Might suggest simmering 10 min and slow-cooking for 5hrs (& at least checking meat at that point. Would cook em' up again.
Update - I cooked them again - this time following the recipe where they're prepped in the oven instead of simmering - worked much better. They came out perfectly. Interesting, I hadn't noticed the 'down-home baked beans' flavour of the ribs last time...

OK, normally I hate when I see a review and there's been so many changes that it's not the actual recipe!  But I am rating this on the METHOD only.  I simply didn't have time to cook the sauce, so I used a bottle of BBQ sauce.  The method rocks, cooking them in the oven does brown them a bit and gets rid of some (not all) of the fat.  They really are fall off the bone tender.  Can't wait to try the sauce when I have more time.

Excellent taste, but not quite as tender as I hoped.  I think maybe I didn't vook them long enough...

My husband loved this recipe.  The meat was so tender and just fell right off the bone.  I served it over rice.  It's definately a make again recipe. Thank you.

These were okay.  Maybe it's because I'm from Texas and we have too much other good 'real' BBQ here.  I wasn't crazy about the sauce on these.  But the crockpot did make them very tender.  Definitely better on the grill though.

Great tasting ribs.  Sauce is wonderful.  The chili sauce adds just the right flavor.  My family loved it.  Will definitely make  again and again.

Would make again.  I love a good crockpot recipe as it's so nice to have your meal done in the morning.  The sauce was a bit much though and hubby said they tasted better the next day.

Very satisfied. Substituted BBQ sauce for half the ketchup as others suggested. No leftovers and not a lot of sauce wasted.

I am not a big rib fan, so I made these special for my husband.  He really liked them.  They were very tender and the meat was just falling off the bone.

EXCELLENT, BUT. . . .  These were great, however, like others, I used ketchup, chili sauce AND Sweet Baby Ray's Spicy BBQ Sauce.  I also added a clove of crushed garlic, and we used country ribs this time around.  The nice thing is that you can taste your sauce before pouring it over the ribs, so you really can't go wrong. Thanks for a great recipe, since it's been in the 90s and hubby didn't have to sweat it out at the grill!

Although I liked that the meat was very tender and falling off the bone I was not to pleased with the taste. I ended up adding 1/4 cup of brown sugar more and cooking for approx 30 minutes extra to try to improve the taste.  My hubby loved these and could not get enough of the meat, but I am sorry to say I cant say the same.  I think nextime I will use bbq sauce instead the chili sauce and add some onions/garlic to the recipe.  Thanks for sharing though, the hubby still enjoyed his dinner!

Easy to do, and finger-linkin great. The flavours from the ribs rival those BBQ ribs served at restaurants. If u like the ribs really spicy, I find that using a Asian-style chilli garlic sauce instead of normal chilli sauce, really adds up the 'heat' factor

Very good bbq recipe using ingredients I always have on hand.  I used country style ribs.  I chose not to boil them first, but I seared them and give them nice grill marks on the stovetop grill pan.  Then, I placed them right in the slow-cooker (2 hrs. on high / 4 hrs. on low),  and they just fell off the bones.  Everyone enjoyed them.  I'll do this again.

Really good ribs!  I didn't bother putting them in the oven, just popped them straight into the crockpot and cooked them all day.  My husband and I both really liked the sauce, but I think it would have been even better without the oregano, so next time I will leave it out, but all in all, the ribs and the sauce were wonderful!  Thanks for sharing!

Thought the sauce tasted more like a spaghetti sauce than BBQ sauce with the distinct oregano flavor. It was good. I will try it over pasta to see. I used boneless country style ribs which would have fallen off the bone had there been one. Because the sauce wasn't very BBQ-ie I brushed the ribs with our usual Famous Dave's BBQ sauce and put them under the broiler for a few minutes. They tasted fine and were tender. May make this again, but as a pasta sauce.

A 10-star recipe!  Have also tried this with beef back ribs and it's just as good.  I did add a little minced garlic however (it's our favorite addition).

Fantastic recipe! I took the other reviews advice and cut the ketchup down to 1/2 cup and uped the BBQ sauce accordingly. 

We used beef country ribs since we don't care for pork and they were wonderful.  Sweet and spicy with an amazing flavor!

Great recipe!! The meat fell right off the bone. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because I like my bbq sauce sweet. Other than that it was perfect.

These fell off the bone after 6 hours in the crock pot.  They were great!  Next time I'll add a little more zip - maybe some chili powder.

Like almost everybody else, I used 1 cup BBQ sauce, 1 cup ketchup.  They were fantastic!  My daughter said, "Mom, those are the mostest deeee-licious ribs!"  Very high praise from the pickiest eater in my house!

yummy & easy.  I used 1 1/2 c ketchup & 1 1/2 c barbecue sauce instead of 2 c ketchup & 1 c chili sauce.  also added some honey & kicked up worcestershire & hot sauce.  so good & so easy.  the sauce came out AMAZING!!!  i used country ribs.  also would be good with a pork roast.  i'll make it again:)

These were fall-off-the-bone tender and tasted good, but became overwhelming really soon with how rich they were.  I had taken the suggestion of another post and used bbq sauce and ketchup instead of chili sauce.

These were good. I didn't cook them the same though. I started mine frozen in the crockpot. When they were thawed and just starting to cook, I removed them, drained the fat, and seasoned. I put them back in the crockpot and added the sauce. I also used 1 cup bbq and 1 cup ketchup. Next time I may use all ketchup b/c I thought it just tasted like my normal BBQ sauce. Will make again.

This is my favorite alternative to the grill method to make ribs now.  I use 1/2 the ketchup and replace with equal amount of favorite barbecue sauce.  I also season ribs with garlic powder, onion powder and dry rub before cooking in oven.  Really easy way to make ribs that are delicious and falling off of the bone.  Great for winter or busy days.

I didn't have time to bake in the oven, so I browned the ribs in the skillet. The meat had a wonderful texture and fell off the bones. However, I wasn't crazy about the sauce-too much ketchup. I'm going to try this recipe again, but experiment with different amounts of ingredients.

I figured I'd try the easy route first and make these ribs w/bottled sauce as many said. They were fantastic - thank you so much for the idea - a crock pot! - who knew?! My hubby freaked, and laughed about our friend who spent all day tending to his ribs cooking outside in one of those outdoor cookers (? - not a grill...?) These actually slid off the bone while getting them out of the crockpot. I now like ribs (couldn't stand them before b/c they stuck in my teeth!)

Great recipe! I omitted the oregano and added fresh minced garlic instead. Also, I only used one cup of ketchup and added the 1 cup of barbecue sauce like others said. The sauce was was thick and the ribs were very tender.

I wasn't too crazy about these ribs although my husband and 2 yr old son loved them! I followed the recipe exactly (except made 4 servings instead of 8. I didn't care for the flavor of the sauce.  I'm not sure if it was the oregano, but to me the sauce had more of an Italian sauce taste than a BBQ sauce.  The ribs were very tender though...fell right off the bone!

When these finished cooking I could hardly wait to get at them but I was a little disappointed with flavor.  So I put them in the frig.  I decided to try them a day or two latter and they were delicious.  Can't explain whether it was me or if they did get better but I enjoyed them a couple more times after that.

I browned in oven as directed, but only added two cups of barbeque sause over ribs (a little less than two pounds). Slow cooked for about 8 hours--these were DELISHIOUS--fell right off the bone.

This was delicious! I took the suggestions of others and cut the amount of ketchup in half and substituted BBQ sauce for the remainder (instead of 2 cups of ketchup, I used 1 cup ketchup and 1 cup of BBQ sauce). I've never really been big on ribs but thought this was outstanding and will definitely make it again!

This is very good, and I would make it again, but I found it a touch sweet for my taste.  I'm going to cut down on the sugar probably nex time.  The next night, with the left over sauce I made Pork Chops in the Crock Pot.  The sauce wasn't so sweet the second time round.  And was so nice to use again.

My husband thought they were great. They were too sweet for me. I would make them again though. They were nice to come home to after a long day!

This was TOTALLY easy and it was SOOOOO GOOOD!  Im a horrible cook - I louse up EVERY recipe I try. I cant believe how easy this is. I cant believe I made it!  It was soooo yummy. I followed the advice of using 1/2c ketchup 1/2 bbq sauce.  I read another reviewer that said it was a big greasy mess - I think as long as you trim the fat before cooking, it works just fine.  Excellent recipe!  Im making MORE next week!

We had this the other night and thought it was alright.  I used my own bbq sauce recipe.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  It didn't even seem like ribs.  The meat was very tender though and I like that it was easy to put together, but I will probably do ribs on the grill next time.

This was a very easy and delicious recipe.  I used country style boneless ribs and they turned out great.  I didn't change the sauce and it was wonderful, though next time I will try the suggestion many users gave to substitute bbq sauce for 1 cup of the ketchup.  Will definitely make this again!

We had this for dinner tonight and it was fantastic. We made one change which was listed in another review.  Instead of using 2 C. ketchup we used 1 C. ketchup and 1 C. hickory BBQ sauce.  To start we browned the ribs in a frying pan; much faster and more convienent than browning in the oven and.  The meat was juicy and very tender.  Try it you will like it!

I like the method for cooking, but thought the BBQ sauce was far too sweet.  I tried adding additional worscestershire and some prepared mustard to balance the flavor, but it just didn't happen.  Just my taste, not the fault of the recipe.  Also, I like a little toothsomeness to the outside of the rib meat, and you don't get that with this method, but the meat is certainly fall-apart tender...in my case, even just after 3 hours.  I'll use this method again, but will try to use a BBQ sauce that's more suited to my own taste preference.
