I did enjoy this recipe. It was so quick and easy to throw together. I am not sure what the butter added to the sauce. I would probably omit it the next time. The pasta cooked up great. I love Barilla, it is theonly brand of pasta I use. The sauce was a bit bland and could use some spicing up.

While this recipe was a quick fix for supper, we did not care for the jarred sauce at all. Would use the Barilla tortellini again.

I added fresh garlic, onions, italian seasoning instead of basil leaves, and put in a 1/4 c of heavy whipping cream. Great hit with the kids!

This is the first time i had tried the Barilla tortellini and i thought it was pretty good. My son said they didn't seem as filled or soft and the brand we usually buy, which is not dried. I actually think this tortellini will work well in a cold pasta salad as it would hold up well.

This recipe was very simple to put make!  I did add a bit of heavy cream to the sauce.  It was delicious. Everyone in the house really liked it a lot.  I will definitely be making this again!!!

For others mentioning that they like home made better, well that's to be expected of most pre-made foods in my opinion. That being said, this is a decent quick dinner. Don't forget the basil leaves and use some good cheese too, not the green can if you can help it. I would prefer using Barilla Spicy Marinara sauce on this.  It's hard to find but I buy it at Walmart.  I'm not a huge fan of jarred sauces and the like but they do have their place in my pantry. Using my suggestions you may fool someone that you spent some time in the kitchen!  Kinda like dressing up a "superstore" outfit with a designer handbag, shoes or jewelry. ;)

On the table in 15 minutes or less, what can be better than that for a busy weeknight meal? I made it more hearty by using my own pre-made meat sauce. Love the simplicity.

Fabulous and easy for a quick meal.  This is totally adjustable to what you have on hand and can easily have 'extras' added (sausage, veggies, etc).  The entire family was pleased with this one!

My picky daughter likes this which was great because she hates all things pasta. I thought it was pretty good but prefer homemade tortellini. My son loved it and my husband was neutral. It was soooo easy to throw together. I will definitely make it again! The only change I made was to add ground beef to the sauce because I don't like marinara without meat. I thought the Barilla sauce was a little sweeter than I usually make but good.

This is a nice, easy meal when you're pressed for time.  My family really enjoyed it and it came together quickly with store-bought ingredients.  I doctored the pasta sauce a little to suit my family's tastes and served with a green salad.

Good, quick late night meal idea. Nothing extraordinary but tasty. We enjoyed the pasta, first time we've had it. I found the butter unnecessary and would omit it next time. I prepared the kids' portions with mozzarella and actually liked that better than the Parmesan.

This was a good, easy recipe for a quick weeknight meal that is very kid friendly.  I paired it with some garlic bread and a salad to complete the meal.

This  was a great basic recipe that we use as our go to meal when we are unsure what else to make.  I added arrabiatta sauce to spice it up.

Quick and easy dish to get together.  I tried the jarred sauce and decided to make marinara to use instead as I wasn't fond of the flavor of the jarred sauce.  I did like the fresh basil added to the top of the tortellini.   I am a big fan of Barilla pasta, but, I didn't particularly care for the tortellini.  Even cooking it the shorter time listed on the box I thought it was slightly mushy and didn't have much filling.   I prefer the refrigerated or even the frozen variety instead.
