This was ok.  I love pesto, made pretty much every recipe on this site, and this was by far my least favorite.  I love adding pine nuts or walnuts to pesto, but the amounts called for were too much, it competed with the basil flavor.  Also, the combination of both butter and olive oil made it way to heavy/greasy for my taste.  I did like the idea of adding two cheeses, I will probably try that with one of the other recipes from this site, but I won't make this one again.

This is heaven. I love pine nuts so I had added an extra tablespoon of them. Also, before placing the pine nuts and walnuts in the processor, I placed them in one layer on a baking sheet in the oven for 5 minutes on 350. It gets their oils going and a more nuttier flavor, which I find to be the great kick in pesto.

This pesto has far too may ingredients, I thought using the basil & parsley and walnuts & pine nuts muddled the flavors... too much competition...I also thought there was way too much fat involved. Sorry, but I like my pesto to have a clean, crisp basil/pine nut flavor. I did however like the mixture of cheeses.

Thanks for sharing this recipe with us. I love pesto and hope to try many more recipes here.
I cut the olive oil to 1/4 cup as another suggested, and that seemed to suit me well - especially when topping it with oil to prevent oxidization.
Initially thought it was too salty and not enough basil as another reviewer said, but once you get it on the pasta, it's just right.

The olive oil amount should be cut down a bit, and don't add the butter. Butter isn't used in pesto recipes. It's usually nuts (pine or walnut), garlic, oil, basil, paremsan cheese. Salt and pepper can be added but aren't necessary. When I make pesto, I don't use garlic because I'm allergic, but onions or shallots make a good substitute.

This really is the best pesto ever. I made it to go with pasta for a dinner party and made too much. The next night we ate it on burgers with melted mozzarella cheese and baby greens. They were fabulous.

Wonderful. I will make this again and again. I toasted the pine nuts before adding them. Besides that I didn't change a thing. I put it into individual containers so I could freeze it and have it to use later.

This was great! I used it with a creamy chicken pasta dish and it tasted amazing. However I did omit the romano cheese and pine nuts because I didn't have any on hand but I probably couldn't tell the difference.

This wasn't the best pesto ever for me. It was an overload of ingredients and usually all you need is just basil, walnuts, olive oil, and garlic. (and maybe a pinch of salt) If you need any cheese, you can sprinkle in some parmesean. Don't take such a hard time on all these ingredients. Do it the easy way!

This pesto is fantastic!  Everything was spot on.  I'm so glad I decided to make this one.  I only did two things different: 1) I used a three cheese blend (asiago, parmasean, and romano) because it was cheaper than getting the latter two separately, and 2) added crushed red pepper (because I like things spicy).  Great recipe!  Thank you!

I followed what a few of the others members had suggested and cut back the olive oil to 1/4 cup and also added 1 tbsp pine nuts and it tasted great... both my toddlers and my husband gobbled it up and best of all I have more pesto left over for next time!  It was super easy and quick which I love. Thanks for sharing!

I agree!  This pesto is delicious.  I added a little roasted red pepper and it was the best pesto I ever had.  Mix it with mayo to make a spread for sandwiches.

This was my first attempt at pesto and it turned out very well, even with my substitutions. I doubled the garlic, didn't use butter, and used romano cheese instead of the parmean.  Deelish!

Best pesto I've made yet!  The nuts added a great rich flavor to the recipe.  This will now be my go to pesto recipe.
