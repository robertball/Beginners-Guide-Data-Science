When I was growing up a friend of the family made this pie at my Dad's request frequently. We called it Burnt Sugar Pie, it is still the richest pie I love to eat! Can't think of anyone that hasn't loved this pie when they try it. It is a little time consuming to make but the effort is worth!!

I made this recipe as printed in allrecipes. It is delicious. I have been looking for this recipe for over 20 yrs for my husband. Caramel pie was his familys favorite and never lasted more than a day when his Mom made it. Thank you Glenda for making the effort of printing it here

Although time consuming, this is the easiest caramel pie I've ever made. It was delicious and exactly what I was hoping for.
