French baguette?  Swiss cheese?  What kind of Philly cheesesteak is THAT?! A REAL Philly steak is on a soft-crust long roll oozing with either melted American or Cheez Whiz.  And believe me, that makes a huge difference. While this so-called "cheesesteak" is not bad, I suggest a trip down to 9th and Passyunk for a Pat's Steak --- a real taste of Philly.

Despite the roaring laughter the Phillys are pealing off right now, I liked this for a steak sandwich.*shrugs* I decided to marinate my top round first from previous experience... if you marinate even a short time in lemon or lime juice plus your worcestershire, you won't believe the difference in texture of meat. I cooked the meat whole, rested, then sliced and added back to the pan with the onions and stuff. I've made twice and will make again.

I can hear the GASP coming...but here goes....why does every steak sandwich need to be a "Philly" steak??? I did cut back on the cream cheese...added more garlic for taste.
This sandwich was very good...I will fix it again for my family.

This is absolutely the best sandwich I have ever made or eaten!  What is wrong with you people who rate it low simply based on what it is named?!  Delicious in every sense of the word! I used left over rare steak from an earlier barbecue, sliced thin and piled high in fresh, soft panini buns...yummy!  Philly or no Philly!  Rock on, Jeremy!

Being from the ATL, I guess I'm not sensitive to Philly's claim on the steak sandwich. So, with that being said... Maybe Jeremy needs to drop the "Philly" part.  But the "Jeremy's Steak and Cheese" sandwich was pretty darn good.  My family loved it.  We did add the following spices (we like things intense at our house)...
additional black pepper, paprika, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder, dried thyme, dried basil.  Thanks Jeremy for your Steak & Chesse sandwich recipe.

I loved this recipe! Although I did omit the mushrooms, red onion and cream cheese. I think this is awesome for those of us that don't live in Philly! It's good enough for me, if you don't like it, then post your own :) Thanks Jeremy!

I found that using provolone works well too when you have someone who doesn't like swiss.  It really does make a good change!

This looked really good but I didn't have all the ingredients, so I had to substitute.  Instead of cream cheese, I used 5 wedges of the Laughing Cow garlic and herb cheese and eliminated the garlic.  I used Mozzarella instead of Swiss and it still came out great.  Love this sandwich!

hey - It can be called Philly because the recipe calls for Philadelphia Cream Cheese, right?  Anyways, I thought this was really tasty.  Instead of mushrooms I used green peppers.  And I "eyeballed" the measurements.  Really easy too.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe for the whole family.  Instead of using one big baguette, I used individual philly loafs.  I would recommend this to anyone.

Was good but I made some changes to the recipe.  The cream cheese was interesting but think I will leave it out next time.  I served on regular hoagy buns, lightly toasted and melted Velveeta cheese to pour on top.  That didn't taste quite right, too processed, I guess.  Next time I will melt regular cheddar or something similar.

I made these last night. My daughter asked me to make them again tonight, but I told her we should wait at least a couple days:) The only thing I did different was I used ribeye vs. sirloin and sliced swiss vs. shredded. I think my husband will even love this, and he hates trying new food. I have to say that in response to a couple other reviews, I couldn't care less if this is "authentic" or not. Who cares really? It tastes good. If something tastes like garbage, but is "authentic", does that warrant five stars? I'm all about flavor...don't give a hoot where it was created. Sorry. This is good stuff.

Pretty good for a fake Philly Cheesesteak. We use half the cream cheese, serve it on seperate hoagie rolls, and use shredded provolone OR two big circle slices of provolone on each sandwich :) So satisfying. We eat this probably once a month!

This sandwich is to die for.  Seriously.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the French baguette is so tough & hard to chew.  I will find a different bread but other than that, try this sandwich!

Yummy, Yum, Yum. I made these for a recent trip we took to see the Cardinals Baseball game and my family loved them. It was far better than overlypriced and not so tasty ballpark hotdogs,burgers, and nachos. These sandwiches were wonderful and enjoyed by my whole family. I did make some modifications. I cooked a skirt steak in the crock pot on low for 6 hours to get it nice and tender. I added the worcestire sauce, onion salt, black pepper, and just a dash of season salt. I sauted my onions and green peppers and some chopped jalapenos in olive oil w/ crushed garlic and added this to the crock pot about half way through. I let the steak and onion/pepper mixture cooked for another 3 hours in the crockpot and then removed the meat to cut it into nice thin strips. I added to our sandwich rolls and topped with shredded mozarella, parmesan, swiss, and feta cheese. The feta cheese really adds a nice taste. I used the juice in the crock pot to dip the sandwiches in. What a BALLPARK meal. To keep them hot until we got to the game, I wrapped each sandwich in foil and then put them in an insulated lunch bag. Note: I omitted the mushrooms since most of family doesn't like them.

OMG, I just tried this recipe last night and it was awesome!! My husband and I loved it!  The beef came out so tender and juicy, the only adjustment I made was to lessen the amount of cream cheese.  The recipe asks for 3/4 cup, i believe i only put about 1/4-1/3 cup and it was perfect for us!! Thanks for sharing this great recipe, we will be making this again! Yummmmm!

No stars for this flop of a steak...a real Philly cheesesteak is chopped thin steak on a long roll with either American, provolone or wiz.  A total dud.

We liked this sandwich, though next time I will either leave out the onions or cook them without the garlic until they're caramelized then add the garlic, because I didn't like the crunchy texture of the onions. I served mine on School Lunchroom Cafeteria Rolls from this site with Baked French Fries I on the side and diet cherry sodas :-)

I didnt like this as much as I had thought/hoped I would.  I found the taste of cream cheese too overpowering and cloying, drowning out all other tastes to the point of exclusion.

I usually ADORE creamy/cheesy dishes and the inclusion of mushrooms and garlic just made it even more appealing to give it a try.  Thankfully I did not have even half of the cream cheese that this recipe called for as I think the full amount would have made it almost inedible, even with extra mushrooms, beef, garlic that I had put in!  As it was, it was a waste of the ingredients and thoroughly disappointing.  I only gave it the second star because it WAS as VERY quick and easy dish to prepare...

Just tried this recipe and have decided not to keep it. It had good flavor but not that amazing Philly Steak flavor I have been craving. The cream cheese seemed to give it a stroganoff flavor.

I tweaked this recipe a bit just for the fact I didnt have all the ingredients and I like to make things a bit healthier.  I did like the idea of creamcheese in it I just added lowfat creamcheese.

AWESOME! The only thing I changed was I mixed the veggies with the meat and then put it on the bread to bake. Easier to eat. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this recipe!!  I just used deli roast beef, sauted it.  It was delicious.  I didn"t have mushrooms so used bell peppes with the onions instead.  Also, we like lots of flavor so I doubled the garlic clove and doubled the Worcestershire saurce.  It is a definite keeper!!  Thanks for sharing.

I used this recipe with some leftover moosesteak I didn't know what to do with and it turned out quite yummy. I omitted ingredients I didn't have on hand -- mushrooms & red onions. And I didn't have baguettes either, so I actually just used regular bread. Not as gourmet, but nonetheless tasty!

I thought this sandwhich was really good.  However, next time I would leave out the cream cheese, or drastically lower the amount, because it was very overpowering.  The onion mixture was very tasty and I think the sauce for the meat would have been better NOT creamy.  Will definately make again@

This recipes was good. I made a few changes, like using "steak sandwich rolls" and pre-cut steak from the meat counter at my local supermarket, american cheese and a whole 8oz of cream cheese.Otherwise they were good but would not recommend re-heating them.

We loved this recipe. We wanted to use some leftover roast beef and this recipe was perfect and really quick. We didn't have a baguette so we used tortilla wraps, which turned out amazing. We all agreed that the mixture might be too bland to serve a baguette so I would suggest trying it on tortilla wraps.

I thought this was just OK...the cream cheese is overpowering, and, as noted by other reviewers, not really a true "Philly." But not every steak sandwich has to be a philly, however if you're going to put that word in the title, you should definitely make it true Philly Style!  Thanks...

I waited a few days before writing this review as often my opinion of a recipe evolves a few days after I make/eat a new recipe; that was the case with this sandwich.  Initially, my DH and I thought it was pretty good, but I did change just a couple of things.  I added 2 cloves of garlic to the onion/mushroom mixture and I added about 1 Tbsp. of Worcestershire sauce (because we like it) and I only used about 1/2 a cup of cream cheese. In the end, the sandwich was good, but maybe a little too rich for our taste so I may make it again, but most likely I will continue looking for a steak sandwich that appeals to us more than this one did.

I made this for dinner and was unsure about adding the cream cheese.  I went ahead with half the suggested cream cheese, and I think it ruined the taste.  There was really no flavor, other than the red and green peppers I added.  Not sure if I will make it again.  I might try marinating the meat first for more flavor.

Husband loves this recipe. I admit it is a lot of work, but tastes nice. I do however use a bit tad big more garlic,worchester and normally all on a fresh baked (part bake) french roll. I have also tried it with fat free cream chesse (nice for cutting out the fat) and using it in a sandwich maker (cuts out the mess).

We thought this was pretty good.  OK, so not traditional 'Philly', but I personally don't care what you want to call your recipe.  It was a nice change of pace for us and a good way for me to use up left over steak.  I cubed then simmered my 'cooked' steak in beef broth until it shredded. That way I knew the meat would not be tough.  Thanks Jeremy!

Yummy Yummy Yummy!!!!!!

I've made this so many times! I use a bit of homemade frech onion soup to dip the sandwich in and eat. My hubby likes less cream cheese in the recipe, but I think it's a wonderful, hearty meal. The only suggestion I would make is to toast the baguette a bit for a crunchy effect. What a fantastic recipe. Thanks, Jeremy! We love it!

This ain't no Philly Cheese Steak! I'm from Philly and this doesn't taste right. If you take out the red onion, garlic, swiss cheese and worcestershire sauce, and subsitute provolone cheese and Kikomann's light soy sauce only, you'll have a good tasting steak sandwich. I have found that the soy sauce really helps the steak.

We liked this sandwich. Reading other reviews we cut down the cream cheese to 1/2 cup. The recipe called for worcestershire sauce, but when i was making this my brain told me 1 tsp. Horseradish. Not worcestersauce, so that wasn't added. We love horseradish, so it worked well for us. We also added a little fresh garlic. And some green & red garden sweet peppers. Fried onion & mushrooms. I dont like my rolls ruined and put under the broiler to get hard. So we just melted the cheese on the steak mixture in the pan. Topped it with lettuce & tomato . We had these the other day and are making them again tonight.   You can buy rolls in the bakery at a store then take them home wrap them in foil put the rolls in a 350 degree oven for a couple minutes. Pull them out and they are hot / warm . Just like freshed baked. yummy !

I followed Sugabomb's suggestion and also added a few other seasonings for extra flavor. It was quite good for a steak sandwich. I'll leave the "philly" to the phillies lol.

I did not enjoy this recipe at all. So much creamcheese actually made me very ill. I will personally never make it again.

I made this recipe as written and it wasn't very flavorful.  I did add some shredded cheddar cheese to try to perk it up but didn't help any.  I probably won't make this again.

This was tasty, but I really stress choosing a good cut of meat.  My family would have liked it better had the meat been more tender.  I'll keep this one and make it again.

This was a very good sandwich. However, I cut down a little on the cream cheese because it seemed like a lot and I was very happy that I did. Also, I added more garlic. Very Yummy!

This did not taste at all like the original Philly I am used to.  I agree with some reviewers who compared it to stroganoff.  I won't make it again.

This was a great-tasting sandwich!  The only thing about this recipe is that it's a lot of work for a sandwich.  The prep time on this is a lot longer than 15 minutes because you have to cut up most of the ingredients.

This recipe was not a family favorite tonight. I thought this recipe would be a good change from the way I normally make mine BUT I was wrong. My husband was the only one who kinda enjoyed them. I can't pinpoint what it was ~ something was just *off* with the flavor and how it cooked. I wouldn't have given this 3 stars but since my husband said he didn't think they were *that* bad....

Not bad.  The flavor was nice, but the meat came out too tough, even though I sliced it very thin.  I don't know what I did wrong.  I will give it another try.

Very good! Made it on a Sunday for my husband during a football game, it was great. Of course I ommited the red onion and picked out the yellows after it was done cooking (picky husband!) but it left the flavor! I will make again!

I tried this last night.  Substituted beef bullion for Worcestershire, no red onion or garlic, added sliced green pepper.  Of course, Provolone cheese instead of Swiss served on a fresh French roll.  My husband enjoyed it.

This sandwich is pretty good, worth the effort. I agree with the other review, kind of like stroganoff on french bread. Perfect sandwich for a cold February day! Thanks!
