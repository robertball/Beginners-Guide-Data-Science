This was a very good recipe. I made a few modifications but I still gave it 5 stars because the changes were just my likings. I used garlic and cheese sausages (we don't like spicy or fennel). My method for the meat is to brown the chicken and sausage completley in the garlic & olive oil. Cooking it now this way prevents the meat from becoming overcooked during the boiling and simmering process when making the sauce. Remove the meat and set aside than go on with making the sauce in the same skillet. I used red wine and chopped about 5 roma tomatoes (I don't like canned tomatoes). and let it simmer a bit. Once the tomatoes reduced a bit, I added a little cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce along with salt, pepper and 1/2 cup light cream (I got that tip fom other reviewers). I simmered the sauce for about 20 minutes, added the meat in and simmered another 20 minutes. I than added the pasta and a lot of chopped basil (we love basil) and the dish was very very tasty. I am not sure what people are doing when they say it comes out bland. This is very flavorful! 
Thanks for the recipe!!

I read through the reviews.  I  only used a chicken breast and a 1/2 and a whole pound of the spicy turkey sausage. I used a T of garlic. I sauteed the garlic. Added the chicken and sausage. Cooked until done. Took meat out. Used 28 oz crushed tomatoe sauce, 1/2 cup red wine, 1 T italian seasoning and S & P to taste. Simmered, added meat and simmered for another 20 minutes.  Added 1/2 cup cream with 5 minutes to go. Spooned sauce over noodles. Topped with parmesan cheese. Yum!
You could use a jar of spaghetti sauce with a splash of wine if in a hurry.  Very good for a simple recipe.

A must try.  I only made a few changes based on other reviews.  Since I don't like chunks of tomato, I used spaghetti sauce from a jar and just added a little red wine to get that flavor.  I cooked the meat in the sauce much longer, about double the time.  I added dried onion mid way through.  I added cream as one reviewer suggested and I liked what that did to the texture.  We will definately have this again!

I used this basic recipe to accomodate some ingredients I needed used - so mine turned out a bit different than the original, but as the chef herself noted, neccessity is the mother of invention!  I didnt' use any chicken and added a can of tomato sauce instead of wine, and added about a cup of chopped zucchini.  I didn't have any rosemary so used basil, thyme and sage instead.  I added the zucchini pretty early in so it could cook with the sausage which gave it amazing flavor and even my little brother who doesn't care for it said it was tasty.  I give it 4 stars just to compensate for the differences there may be between the original

This recipe needed more flavor. I added garlic and green peppers but it 
was still lacking something.  The dish was ok, but I don't think I will make this again.

Very tasty.  Here are my modifications based on everyone else.
1 can tom. plus 1 8oz sauce
onion/garlic/green bell cooked down w/italian seasoning and sea salt- then added sausage
Used dried spices v. fresh 
sprinkled a touch of garlic salt over the top while it simmered.  I added the spices after 10 min. of simmering and used the baby seashell pasta
Sprinkled w/fresh parmesan (not the  out of the green can!) (-:

Have made this twice with great results both times. Used dried basil (1tsp.)instead of fresh.
Great flavor, yet actually rather light. Don't expect a heavy tomato sauce pasta dish.

I found this recipe three years ago and it is still my husband's absolute favorite.  It is so easy and tasty.  Thanks for sharing!  I use Red Wine Vinegar instead of red wine, and a package of sausage from the butcher instead of skinning the sausage links.  It makes it much quicker.

This is a hearty but quickly prepared pasta dinner that tasted like I put a lot more effort into cooking than I did.  I love the flavors of sausage and chicken together, and thought it was great to use turkey sausage instead of pork sausage for the sake of good health.  I used a little bit of tomato paste to thicken my sauce, and doubled everything so we'd have plenty of leftovers.  I added several other seasonings including a bit of marjoram, oregano, onion powder, sugar (to cut the salty taste of canned tomato), and a pinch of allspice - all of which made this sauce taste delicious and slow cooked.  I also used ziti with lines instead of bowties - we don't like farfalle much.  Everything was delicious and everyone's looking forward to taking leftovers to work tomorrow!

Great dish.  It's simple to make, but tastes like you spent quite a bit of time preparing it.  Everyone always loves it.  You can make it with groud beef or sausage and add other vegetables if you wish. Will make again...

I felt there should have been more sauce
for that amount of pasta.

I have a question...why does the recipe call for bowties (at the beginning of the ingredient list) and then penne (at the end)?  Do you use both pastas??  Or is this a misprint?

My mother-in-law makes a similar dish.  When I couldn't find her recipe card, I tried this one.  An excellent version of hers, and much quicker!  This is my standard "company" dish.  I use white wine instead of red, and go heavy on the rosemary (and use fresh).  I always get compliments!  Excellent with a strawberry spinach salad.

Definitely a keeper!  Didn't have bowties, used curly pasta.  Husband suggested combination of sausages we had on hand so we used chicken-apple, Andouille, and bulk hot Italian.  Doubled the garlic, can't wait to make it again!

I thought this was delicious, but my husband gave it a "B."  (Although he ate about 3 helpings!)I made a few changes to the recipe because I was mising a few ingredients.  I used a cup of beef broth instead of the wine and I served it over whole wheat egg noodles.  I also used italian seasoning in place of the basil and rosemary.  And I used sweet italian sausage instead of hot sausage.I really enjoyed it and it was even tastier the second day!

Next time I think I won't use quite as much pasta since there didn't seem to be enough sauce, but maybe I just need to add more diced tomatoes as someone suggested. I actually liked the flavorings, but I always add more spices anyway.

This dish is absolutely fantastic! I did make some changes, though. First of all, I used 6 links of spicy italian chicken sausage and 3 chicken breasts. I sauteed the garlic in the olive oil along with a whole diced yellow onion and did not remove any of it. After I browned the chicken (which I liberally seasoned with salt and pepper) and sausage, I added one whole chopped zucchini, about 3/4 of a chopped red bell pepper, a handful of chopped sundried tomatoes, and two chopped artichoke hearts. I added the wine first and let it reduce a bit to make that wine flavor more intense and then added a large can of diced tomatoes (not drained). I reduced the sauce for probably 40 minutes and it was still thin, so I added a little cornstarch and water to thicken it a bit. I finished it with a heavy drizzle of heavy cream and chopped fresh basil. I forwent the rosemary. If you want to hide veggies from your kids or a family member who doesn't like them, in a way that they can't really be tasted, this is it! I would have included green pepper, but didn't have any on hand. It made a HUGE portion, but I froze the remainder for a later meal! It had the perfect blend of cream and spice from the sausage. A+ recipe!!

This was a really good recipe!  I used Italian sausage and doubled the crushed tomatoes for more sauce as suggested by others.  It turned out quite good and was really easy to make.  With more tomatoes it makes a recipe that feeds 6-8 people at my house. Will definitely make again.

I doctored this up by adding onions but otherwise followed the directions.  My family really liked it, including my 2 1/2 year old son who eats basically nothing.  He gobbled it up.  That is high praise!!

Surprised at how good this was even though it was so simple.  A keeper for sure!  I added half a cup of half and half. Used turkey breakfast sausage, added some more garlic, really nice.  Thanks!

Very good basic recipe.  I used cheese & chipotle pepper sausage.  Not spicy.  Good flavor and easy to make.

Very yummy!  Whole family loved it!  Couldn't find turkey sausage so I used Johnsonville mild Italian sausage.  Seasoned the chicken with Italian seasoning, garlic salt & black pepper and cooked it together with the sausage and 1 onion (minced) in 2T olive oil and 1T butter.  I doubled the sauce recipe and added 1/2 cup heavy cream & red pepper flakes then simmered for 20 minutes.  I served it with Kraft Italian 5 Cheese Blend, salads & garlic bread.  Definately a keeper!

This is a good versatile recipe.  There's room for lots of variation.  Im from Louisiana and it reminded me of jambalaya but with pasta instead of rice.  I used some left over chicken andapple sausage but otherwise I followed the recipe and it turned out great.  Very easy too.

This is sinfully good.  A rare treat for us because its really not very healthy.  The only thing I do differently is I do NOT toss with the pasta before serving.  We like having leftovers and the noodles just don't hold up with the liquid on them.

Quick and easy...great for a last minute weekday meal.  I also used tomato sauce instead of the red wine, and italian seasoning in place of the rosemary.  I will definitely try this again..maybe with diced ham instead of the sausage.

I thought this was fantastic! It was hearty and tasty and so easy to make. The only changes I made were to leave the garlic in and add sliced mushrooms. We had it over linguini and the leftovers were wonderful for lunch the next day. A keeper!

I thought this recipe needed more flavor. I added in the garlic that I had sauted.Not enough sauce for the amount of pasta. It was ok, but I probably won't cook this again.

I tried this last night and it was a HIT.
I added a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes and a 3/4 cup of red wine to increase the sauce for my pasta.
I also added some sweet red and yellow peppers and 2 cans of diced tomatoes.
I will definitely make this again!

This has become my husbands favorite dish! I made a couple small changes; leaving out the chicken and adding more Italian sausage as well as adding light cream (another reviewers suggestions). Delicious! Even my 20 year old brother loved this dish, and he is VERY picky. If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would!

I made this almost exactly as directed, though I left the garlic in the pan when cooking the meat.  After the sauce simmered with the meat for 10 minutes I added some oregano, parsley flakes, crushed red pepper in addidtion to the rosemary.  I also used a little more than 2 tsps of basil ( the fresh basil in a tube you can find in the produce section) .  In addition, I sautéed some fresh spinach in garlic and a bit of olive oil and added that to the whole meat/pasta/sauce mixture at the end.  Delish!!  My husband and I both loved it.

This was a very good recipe that everyone in my family enjoyed (which is a rarity).  The one thing that I will add next time is spinach which will blend nicely.

The family enjoyed this.  The only change that I made was to use about 1/2 the pasta & double the crushed tomatoes.  Seemed like it would have been a little dry without that change.  Overall, very good.

This is awesome. By far my favorite easy meal to make. I used white wine instead of red and didn't use the chicken because I thought the sausage would be enough and I was right! Love love love this recipe!

Luckily I read other reviews before I made this so I knew that the sauce could be a little thin and that I shouldn't use all of the macaroni.  Also, I personally like my food with a lot of flavor so I added more of the rosemary and basil as well as some thyme, oregano and cayenne pepper for heat.  Ading some tomato paste to help thicken the sauce and only about 3/4 of the bowties, this came out great!  The result was absolutely delicious that I've already made a second time (and this time I add more of the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste and wine and was able to add the extra pasta so that we would have leftovers).    Just add a little extra spice and some tomato paste and this meal is perfect!

I really liked this - I followed the recipe almost exactly but added a 28oz can of crushed tomatoes and used smoked turkey sausage.  I added the 1/2 cup of cream like some of the previous reviewers suggested.  And, finally, I wilted some fresh spinach into the mix and it was a wonderful addition! I highly recommend this recipe, however, I didn't give it 5 stars only b/c of the added ingredients. Enjoy!

I loved this pasta, especially the next day.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I always change it to fit my taste.  I added a splash of half and half and threw in some parmesan cheese for some added flavor.  I was surprised how much I like the rosemary in this dish.  My partner loved it to but could not wrap his head around why it had both chicken AND turkey sausage in it......he still ate it all.

This was a delicious, easy dish! I used mild sausage since my family doesn't like spicy food, and substituted 1/4 c. apple vinegar plus 1/4 c. red wine vinegar for the red wine, and it turned out fine. I used fresh rosemary instead of dried, and added a ton of basil. I really recommend upping the basil if you think there's not enough flavor. Next time I'll add a little more tomato sauce; there wasn't enough for all the pasta. Otherwise, great! It was easy to make and I got rave reviews.

This really is a delicious recipe and so easy. I've made it with and without the chicken. It's great both ways. I also use a large can (28oz) of crushed tomatoes as we like it a little saucier.

Quite tasty, easy and quick to prepare.  I too made a modification...instead of the wine i used vodka and cream. (i'm into the vodka sauce lately) i ran to the garden and got the first veggie that was ready...fresh peas...i added them at the last so they would not lose the crunch.

What a fast, nice easy meal! We used 1.5 lbs sweet pork sausage(no chicken) and amost a whole 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes. Added some crushed red pepper too. Super with the wine - really worth adding it. Will make this again and again. As author says - you can add anything to this and it will be good! I added zucchini this time. Might try eggplant next time. Thanks for a great recipe!

My Family loved this! Even the kids, who are usually very picky, ate it up. I added about a half a cup of heavy cream at the end as someone had suggested and it was great. It cut a little of the acidity out of the sauce. Absolutely delicious!!!

Great recipe, as measured by all the kids clean plates! I'd like to have a bit more sauce myself, but then we used already cooked rotisserie chicken so that may have absorbed some of the sauce (great flavor that way) since it wasn't seared pieces.

These substitutions worked great as it's what we had on hand. Cubed chicken from two breasts of Costco Rotisserie Chicken. One Garlic cube (frozen fresh garlic from Dorot, 1 cube/clove) instead of 2 cloves, added after the meats were cooked. Three teaspoons dried basil instead of 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, added while simmering (dried should be added earlier than fresh).

Added the Rosemary with the dried Basil while the sauce was simmering, to be sure it was softened and not noticeable by the kids -- worked great (I couldn't find a single piece).

I DID ADD A SPLASH OF HEAVY CREAM, AND A HANDFUL OF GRATED CHEESE. I THINK NEXT TIME I'LL ADD SUNDRIED TOMATOES, BUT THIS WAS A VERY NICE DISH. I HAVE A FEELING THE LEFTOVERS WILL BE EVEN BETTER.  I FOLLOWED THE SUGGESTION OF FRYING UP THE MEAT COMPLETELY BEFOREHAND, THEN MAKING THE SAUCE. THANKS FOR THE RECIPE

This was delicious! I changed a few things because I was too lazy to go to the store. All I had on hand was a can Italian stewed tomatoes, so I put them in the blender, but left them slightly chunky for texture. I didn't use any oil since my sausage produces enough on its own. I sauteed the sausage for a minute, then added the garlic and a little leftover chicken from last nights' dinner. I poured in the sauce and followed the rest of the directions almost to a T. The only complaint I have is completely my own fault- All I had on hand was this really cheap, gross red wine. It gave the sauce a really weird flavor, so I threw in about a half a cup of Ragu and a pinch of sugar. I added cornstarch to it as the other reviewers suggested to make the sauce thicker. We ate it over Linguine noodles. I can't wait to make this again! My boyfriend raved. Thank you!

I think Cheri826's input made this recipe good. I followed what they did (highly recommend that, especially the cream and cooking the sausage and chicken separate). I also added a bit of spice. Red Pepper gave it a nice bite. Not too much. Corn Starch was also a must. It's a good base recipe, but I think it definitely needs some alterations to really get it going.

I was so excited to make this dish and, boy, was it a pleaser! I was very grateful for the reviews, as I did modify it a bit based on user recommendations! I added a bit of cream, doubled the canned tomatoes (just got the BIG can) and decided to add a handful of fresh spinach! The sauce was so, so good that I am going to create a tomato bisque from it next time! Bravo!!!

This is my go-to meal whenever I don't know what to make for dinner.  I did make some of my own changes and I've noticed I continue to make changes-throwing in what I have and making due with what I'm out of.  We only use sausage, my grocer carries sweet and hot Italian sausage in 1lb bulk packages.  I roll it into small balls and cook it thoroughly before adding canned tomatoes.  Sometimes they're crushed, other times diced, a few times just a can of sauce.  Occassionally I'll find that I've purchased some diced tomatoes seasoned with basil and oregano or some other variety of spices.  I alway skip the rosemary as we aren't fans, but I add an Italian spice blend, oregano, red pepper flakes, and sometimes onion.  I always leave the garlic in after I saute it in the oil, we like the flavor and texture.  This is definitely a recipe I've committed to memory.

This recipe was great!!  I only made one correction. I didn't have red wine and i had a can of rotel (mild).  So I used the rotel in place of the can of crushed tomatoes.  I then used the juice from that can in replace of the red wine.  I will definitely make it again!

This was an easy and great recipe.  I let my son choose which pasta style he wanted, and he chose rotini.  I did not think the sauce was too thin.  When I mixed with the pasta it all absorbed in and looked just like the picture.  My 4 year old said, "MMM, this is good pasta."  He ate every bite and even ate left over for lunch. Enough said!!!!

This is a average  dish.  One problem I see is that there is not enough sauce.  Next time I make it I will the same amount of sauce with 1/2 the pasta, chicken and sausage.

Great recipe!  I would suggest adding the wine before the crushed tomatoes and let it deglaze the pan first.  That way the alcohol burns off and you don't have to cook the crushed tomatoes quite as long.  This will be a staple during the week.

This was wonderful.  My local store had a spicy cajun chicken sausage that was incredible.  I used that in lieu of the italian sausage.  I also didn't have fresh garlic and used jarred instead without removing it from the pan.  I added a little parmesean cheese on top and walla...it was wonderful.

Good flavor and lots of food! Be certain to bring to a boil for the 20 minutes or the wine taste is overbearing.

I have a recipe for bowtie pasta and Italian sausage and thought this would be a nice change of pace. I used mild sausage only because I had it on hand and 2 thawed out chicken breasts and no idea what I wanted to do with them. I made this recipe using canned diced Italian tomatoes and followed the rest as it's listed.  We had it with a tossed salad and hubby happily took the leftovers to work with him this AM for his lunch.  Delicious and a definite keeper I'll do often.  Thank you for sharing!!

Just made this recipe tonight for my fiance and I...he is a picky eater and say it was "excellent" I LOVE the taste, thought it was great! I used turkey sausage instead to make it a tiny less fattening, and used angel hair bc it's what I had on hand. This will be in my monthly rotation!

This has become one of our favorites. If you love dishes with robust flavor, this one is for you!  I add sun dried tomatoes, and at the end I add about a half cup of heavy cream or half and half. This one rates close to the top at our house!

My husband and daughter liked it, I think it was OK but has potential with some adjustments. I used pork sausage and chicken...next time I start the cooking the sausage first and then add the chicken to prevent it from drying out. I'll also make twice the sauce...I used 1 12oz box of Barilla pasta but it seemed to absorb almost all of the sauce. I added more seasoning...it was a bit bland for my taste. But too be fair , I had to use dried basil instead of fresh. I added a jar of roasted red peppers too.  I did like the mix of red wine and crushed tomatoes. It was pretty easy and I liked the versatility, I think this would be great on a crusty roll. I'll definitely make it again and try some different seasonings. Thanks Patricia.

This was so good!  I used chicken broth in place of wine.  I also used a bigger can of crushed tomatoes, since I wanted more sauce.  I used left over sausage from a previous night's dinner.  I was nervous about mixing the sauce with the pasta because I too have had problems with the pasta becoming too dry when reheating, but I did not have that problem with this dish.  Leftovers were just as delicious as the real thing!

Easy AND delicious!  The only change I made was to accommodate my youngest son who does not like spicey.  I used sweet sausage and added red pepper to individual servings.  Will definitely have again!

Wow, this dish was amazing. I have tried many recipes from this website, but this one has been the best. I cooked the meats all the way through then added to the sauce mixture. I would love to supply a picture, but my husband has finished off all the left-overs...which also heated up great!!

I added more chicken and used a 28 oz. can of tomatoes so it had more sauce. I also cooked the chicken and sausage ahead to save time. Very good! I will probably cut down on the rosemary next time. Overall, it was a big hit.

We just finished our yummy dinner. Thank you for the great recipe Patricia! The only thing I did differently was use hot italian pork sausage instead of turkey. I bought pork sausage because I didn't read the ingredient list carefully before my grocery shop. I cooked the sausage a few minutes before adding the chicken, and it all came out great! 

This would be fabulous in sandwiches. Next time I make it I will double up the recipe except for the pasta. Add half the sauce to the pasta and save half for grilled french roll sandwiches the next day.

This is part of our regular rotation for sure!

This was a very good recipe.  I did not have crushed tomatoes, I used 4 fresh tomatoes and cut them up and used about a cup of sauce, I would like to try it with the crushed tomatoes next time and maybe cut chicken up into smaller pieces.

This was delicioius and the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I changed a lot. I used a garden rotini pasta instead of farfella, 1 giant chicken breast instead of two, 1 lb of polska kielbasa instead of spicy italian sausage, 2 cloves minced garlic instead of whole garlic, a small jar of spaghetti sauce instead of diced tomatoes, 1/2c of Chianti red wine, and 1t Sage, 1t Thyme, 2t Rosemary in addition to the 2t Basil. I also added 1/2 of a sweet onion and 1/2c cream. I lightly sauted the garlic and onion before adding the sausage and chicken, but I didn't remove them while I lightly browned the meat. I added the spices and cream in the last 10 minutes of simmering. It turned out great! The flavor was amazing, even when warmed back up. I will definately make this again and again.

This will be the second time I made this. I liked it the first time but thought it was a bit bland... so I added chopped onions while cooking the chicken and turkey sausage and I also added oregano along with the basil, gave the dish a little more flavor. it is a very nice change on a pasta dish

My fiancé loved this. I added onion powder, oregano, and minced garlic. I also topped it with grated parmesan/romano cheese. The hot sausage was delish. I also love how i need red wine for it because it gives me an excuse to buy some haha.

I made this last night after work with chicken left over from a grocery store chicken.  Added some mushroom, fresh spinach and because I had it, spaghetti sauce instead of tomatoes.  It all went together easily and I had the leftovers today for lunch and it is even better.

I made as directed and it was bland and watery not enough sauce for that amount of pasta in fact I left off adding about 1.5 cups to it .. out of 6 people no one liked it. Rather than toss it out I tried the next day to switch it up and added small can of tomato sauce and lots of spaghetti seasoning and a spicy sweet type of specialty ketchup also melted montery jack cheese shredded into it and a layer on top.. still no one like it.. so tossing it is sorry it is just not good at all

Was looking for a recipe for pasta without all of the gloopy thick sauce, and found it! I didnt use the chicken, instead used 1 link polksa kielbasa, diced, since thats what I had in the freezer. The tomatoes were a bust as well, so I used some canned "tomatoes and habeneros" (we like things spicy!). Kept the garlic in the pan and sauteed that with the rosemary (fresh, chopped) in the olive oil, added the meat and a medium zuchinni. Had bowtie pasta on the side (the 'sauce' was used as a topping for the pasta and will be great recycled into another meal incarnation tomorrow night!), and topped it all with a drizzle of olive oil, chopped black olives and dried Parm+Romano cheese. Can totally see doing this again when spinach comes into season again, yum. Dont expect a thick sauce with this; it is a lovely, very versatile pasta and tomatoes dish that is simply scrumptious!  THANK YOU!

Loved this!  I used spicy pork sausage, fresh tomatoes and mini penne pasta.  So good!  I did not use all the noodles because it would have been dry.  Used fresh basil and rosemary both.  Yum, yum, yum!  Very filling too.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very good.  I used 1/2 lb hot sausage & 1/2 lb mild. (husband not all that cool w/spicy)  I agree with other reviews that more tomatoes are needed.  I added some fresh & 1/4 cup sauce.  I also left garlic in.  Seriously, take it out?????

This had a great flavor but next time I will leave out the chicken. There was just too much meat and the chicken and sausage didn't seem to go together very well. Otherwise this is a great tasting, easy recipe!

Very Good! Will make again. The only changes I made was to add 2 cans of Italian stewed tomatoes instead, which made it a little bit more saucy, and I doubled the simmer time.

I get that it's supposed to be a thin sauce, but this really didn't do anything for me.  Next time, I'll probably add a big can of crushed tomatoes instead of small...maybe in addition to small.  ...On second tasting, the chicken is really bland.  Wouldn't recommend this recipe without some serious changes (marinating chicken and making the pieces smaller, maybe?)

Liked it a lot. Going to skip the chicken next time. It didn't add anything for us. Also, skipped the rosemary, not my favorite herb. Added  dried oregano. Really, really liked it!

Very Tasty! My whole family loved it. They all wanted seconds AND to take some for lunch the next day but it was all gone in less than an hour! I'll make a bigger batch next time. I did modify the recipe a bit. I used Penne and sauteed the chicken and sausage with garlic, but I left the garlic in. I added a 6.5 oz can of mushrooms (drained) and 1/2 a cup of Half & Half. Also added some chili powder to give it a little kick (we like spicy).  It was delicious, but next time I'll add more crushed tomatoes as it was a bit too dry for my taste...and maybe some red pepper flakes. All in all an excellent recipe!

This dish is really good! The one change I will make next time is to use regular sausage instead of turkey sausage, but that is mainly because my husband doesn't care for the turkey sausage. My 4 year old ate it up. Beware that it does make a huge amount of food. We had a ton of leftovers.

Terrific!  Used chicken and hot italian sausage.  Fresh garlic, 1 can diced tomatoes, not drained.  (Cooking for 2).  Used some cabernet (a nice excuse to enjoy a glass of wine since the bottle is open.)  Husband loved, but said to leave out the chicken next time, becuase the sausage was so good and the chicken got lost in the flavor.  Will use a mix of hot/sweet italian sausage next time and maybe add some onions to the mix.  Very good!!!

My family really liked this! I was suprised with how good it was and how little was in it. We used port wine, and it turned out well. I did season it a little bit w/garlic because it was said to be 'bland' . Thanks for sharing !

Do not skip the red wine...it truly makes it!  I use a semi-sweet red and the aroma is out of this world.  I had to have cheese so I grated fresh parmesan on top and it was delicious.  I also only used 1/2 the recommended amount of pasta.  Delicios!  Delicious!  Delicious!

This was simple to make and very good. I was cooking for two, so I used two chicken breasts and only had chorizo sausage on hand (only had one link),I just cut it into small pieces. I also used three garlic based and petite diced tomatoes. I look forward to making it again when I have all the ingredients on hand.

This was pretty good!  The sauce was very thick so I ended up using double the crushed tomatoes. The flavor was good, but I wouldn't mind more garlic next time.  Probably will make again!

Happened to have all the ingredients on hand so gave this recipe a whirl. Very pleased with the outcome -- a winning combination of flavors. Lacks a bit of spice so I added red pepper flakes & a dash of chili sauce. Will put this in the rotation!

This was great and SO EASY!  I made it for my boyfriend who is a chef ... and he loved it!  I agree with most of the reviews though, I only added half the box of pasta because otherwise there wouldn't have been enough sauce.  I would double the sauce recipe next time but still add only 1 lb of pasta.

This is definetely a hearty meal!  I did change it around just a litte.  Instead of just 1 lb. of sausage I used the whole pack (1.24 lbs.) because I hate to throw away food.  To accomodate that we used the whole 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes, doubled the dried rosemary and the fresh basil and added 1 tsp. of dried oregano.  That way we avoided some the complaint of previous reviews of not having enought sauce (something my husband has complained about in other recipes).  Final verdict...my husband loved it!  It was so cold last night and this was the perfect meal to serve.  We ate it with garlic bread but crusty sourdough would be great too.

My family raved about this, I added freshly grated parmesan cheese to the top.  I also used andouille and regular sausage to mix it up a bit.  My only suggestion...next time I will use dark thigh meat in place of the breast meat because the breast meat was dry.

Simple, easy. Hearty and filling. Definitely would make again!

I made this and it was really good. Hell, even Bob liked it. Of course, for him, I have to puree the canned diced tomatoes. 

 We don't drink wine so I didn't have any. I didn't want to buy a whole bottle to use a half-cup for the recipe, though. Called the nearby liquor store and they said they did have wine in small bottles. Went there and found Sutter Home has several different kinds of wine in 4-packs for $5.99 (10/30/2017). Each bottle holds a "serving," 187 ml or just over 6 ounces. Nick at Saubel's Spirits suggested the Cabernet Sauvignon. I used the half-cup (4 ounces) in the recipe and drank the rest. Why waste it?

Besides all that, the recipe turned out really well. Very tasty.  I used rigatoni instead of bowties, 1/2 tsp powdered garlic, 2 tsp dried basil and 1 tsp dried rosemary. Only added a 1/2 tsp salt to the rigatoni cooking water as the sausage I used has plenty of seasoning (salt). It's a local store-made kind. I also used Hunt's Fire-Roasted diced tomatoes, and added chopped onions (about a half-cup) to the meats while cooking them.

I give it five stars because it was so easy to make and tasted so good!

This was good, would have liked it to be just a tad thicker. I subbed sweet Italian sausage for the hot and spicy to suit our tastes. It will be a nice add to the recipe box. We added Parmesan cheese as well. Yummy!

I made this exactly as written and the family was very impressed.  I will make one change next time and move to chicken thigh meat instead of breast meat as I like the flavor a bit more.  Well done.

I really liked this pasta.  The chicken was a nice touch.  It is similar to "drunken noodles' that I make.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added a touch of heavy whipping cream to the sauce and everyone loved it.  I like to use chardonnay instead of red wine, but that's just my taste.  I also have substituted ground beef for the chicken for a hearty Italian style sauciness!  Great recipe; thanks!!

This is a 5  in my book, the sauce is so tasty that I will try it with other variations such as shrimp, mussels, and a white fish, like a fish stew. I used Italian pork sausage and a cabernet wine which was unbelievable. Try it using the original recipe and then get creative! Thumbs up Patricia

Bland, couldn't even taste the chicken (could only taste the sausage). I don't drink so substituted beef broth for red wine. Didn't help. Twelve oz of pasta worked well, a pound would have been too much. It needs some mushrooms, spinach/kale added. Will def change it up a lot if I ever make it again, but then it will be an entirely different recipe. :)

This was very good.  I added about 1/5 brick of cream cheese per others' suggestions to make it a little creamy.  We like the rosemary.  I also added some red pepper flakes.

A fast, easy and delicious meal! The family loved this meal and couldn't stop eating it. I doubled the sauce and added extra Italian seasonings, a splash of Light Cream and Parmesan Cheese. Next time I will try what another reviewer did. She used vodka instead of wine and added vegetables. This is a fun recipe that you can revise as you please. You can't go wrong with this recipe!

Just made this in advance of dinner tonight. Delicious! Try making once as the recipe states before adding more tomato. The consistency reminds me of pasta fazul but with chicken/sausage instead of beans. For those using pork sausage you also can take that opportunity to pour off half the fat before continuing.

Okay, so I essentially made this sauce as written, with two exceptions - a bit of balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar (very good, but don't overdo it) and a lean Italian pork link made by a local market. Oh, and I grilled the meats, then brought them in and finished the sauce. I wanted to be fair in rating this, but didn't have red wine vinegar and we are on a grilling kick. :) The rating is based on this. 

Ultimately, because I like to play, I added tomato paste, Garlic/Basil/Oregano seasoned diced tomatoes, beefed up the seasonings - onion and garlic powders, diced onion, minced garlic in addition to the sliced, and a dried tomato/basil/garlic seasoning (one of the Mrs. Dash combos, I think it is). Also added 1/4 c heavy whipping cream to a double recipe (would have been fine with Lite, but didn't have it). I left the meat and cream out of a portion and added some grilled zucchini for a vegan in the house. It was enjoyed by everyone present. A good, versatile recipe and much appreciated, Patricia. Thank you!

Delicious. Didn't have any red wine but threw some balsamic vinegar into the sauce pan instead and still tasted awesome. It's a good reheat too.

Just finished eating this dish.  It was a great success.  I used a half pound of Italian sausage.  I also used Marsala cooking wine.  This added a lot of flavor.  Also used fire roasted tomatoes and added some mushrooms.

I wasn't sure what to expect with this one.  I don't often make meals with two different types of meat in them.  This was really good.  I went back for seconds.

Good, but not crazy about all of the rosemary.  It was overpowering.  Next time I may exclude and maybe add chopped broccoli or green peppers.

I've made this a few times, and I prefer it without the sausage. It's a good recipe when you need a quick dinner and don't have many fresh ingredients on hand. The wine really adds a lot of flavor.

This was alright, but not great.  I ended up needing more crushed tomatoes than called for (which I did have).  It was a decent way to use my extra sausage that I had in the freezer.  I'm not sure whether or not I'll make it again.  It tasted very Italian (which I like).  I did add 1 tsp Italian seasoning and extra garlic, but besides that, I followed the recipe.  It did only take me a total of 45 minutes to make (not the hour that it says).  I did substitute penne pasta because that was what I had on hand.

I suggest draining the chicken and turkey sausage after it is lightly browned.  Also, drain the canned tomatoes to prevent the sauce from getting watery.  

I added shredded Parmesan cheese, oregano, and red pepper flakes.  I suggest adding the garlic  after the meat is drained and using 2/3 cup of red wine.

I doubled the sauce and used Italian pork sausage and it turned out great!  The two meats were a nice variety for the family to choose from.  Served with a side of fresh green beans and fresh baked rolls.  Yum!

It's true, you can't do anything bad with this. I used other spices (oregano, sage, thyme) because they were what I had and it turned out great. I thickened the sauce and made a pizza, I put spinach on the mess with the noodles and I made an omelet. This is easy, delicious and versatile!

This was okay, but not great. The chicken turned a wierd grey color after cooking in the wine. This didn't bother my husband, but I found it off-putting. The sauce was lacking, so I added some more spices (red pepper flakes, Italian seasoning). I'd skimp on the rosemary next time, for sure. And I'd add a pat of butter at the end. Also, if you like your pasta with a lot of sauce, use less pasta than this recipe calls for.

This was very good, although I didn't have crushed tomatoes so I used a can of diced tomatoes. The sauce ended up being too thin so next time I will be sure to use the crushed tomatoes instead. This is a very tasty low fat, low calorie meal.

This was very good - I made it with zucchini and broccoli and doubled the sauce. I used sweet turkey sausage and ground chicken meat mixed with red pepper and set those aside while the sauce cooked - it turned out perfect with some angel hair pasta and I've had it twice for leftovers at lunch, too! Very nice, easy recipe.

I found this recipe to be a little bland.  I enjoyed trying it, but don't think I'll be making it again.

I really liked this recipy.  I only used one type of pasta.  Type of pasta doesn't matter.  I thought it was simple and quick.  It's definetly a 30 minute meal that tastes great.

I followed the suggestions of some of the other reviews, and added some ff half and half instead of cream, some broccoli, spinach and porcini mushrooms.  It was flavorful, but the sauce wasn't very thick.  I might try this again and simmer for longer.  I also added some cornstarch-next time I will use more.

This is delicious! . Next time I will cook the sausage separately, drain the grease and add in. I used a tbl of dried basil, because my store was out of fresh. . 
Added can of drained diced tomatoes also, because we like them. Finished with Parmesan on top. Will make again just the same.

Really liked this recipe. I used Italian sausage and added 1/4 cream at the end but everything else was the same as the recipe. My family loved it. It will be on our dinner rotation going forward.

Our family really didn't care for this....IF I made it again, I'd use real Italian sausage & not turkey sausage (I know, I know, turkey is healthier...but it's just not as good).    If you're thinking about making this recipe, and you're not a health nut, do yourself a favor & make the "BOW TIES WITH SAUSAGE, TOMATOES AND CREAM" by Linda Caroline on this site.  It is to die for! Super easy, super fast, and one of my all-time favorites (but we do sub fresh basil instead of the parsley).   You're welcome :)

Made this as per recipe except used mild sausage as the wife doesn't like spicy food. It was ok. Rosemary was overpowering and it's not my favorite spice. Similarly it's a lot of sausage with not much else to complement it. However my kids both liked it so we may make it again.

The only thing I would do differently, is remove the chicken before adding the wine and allowing the wine to simmer for a couple of minutes. When I poured it on the chicken, It soaked up all the wine, and then the alcohol didn't have a chance to cook off, leaving a weird taste. Otherwise, I love it!

I used only sausage but added sliced  red, yellow, and green pepper with two  sliced onions that I sautéed until soft, then added to sauce mixture after simmering. I also doubled the sauce and wine to accommodate the additions. Very good.

I sent this link to my father-in-law since he loves Italian sausage. He had me make it and now I have to make it weekly! We use spicy Italian sausage and the pasta has great flavor. I usually do it like some other reviewers do - brown the meat first, deglaze the pan with the wine, let the wine almost evaporate, add tomatoes and herbs, bring to a boil, add the meat back, simmer. It just makes sense to me that way because a lot of pasta sauces are made in this order. I do use some cornstarch to thicken it a bit, too. It always turns out great! 
Oh, and I do double the amount of sauce because I just like a lot of sauce in my pasta, and I half the amount of chicken...

This recipe is unarguably a keeper.I am glad I found this recipe and will make it again but will add cream as others suggest. With that said, I had to change 1 ingredient and that was the turkey sausage as we are not fond of turkey sausage. I replaced it with sweet Italian pork sausage without casings as I can not eat spicy foods. I did also kept the garlic in it so the chicken would absorb a bit more of the garlic. I did simmer all meats together for a bit longer than the 20 minutes to allow for the meats to soften.  It did wonders for the overall texture! Since my sausage was purchased without casing, I made tiny balls out of it about 3/4 inches in diameter. They looked like little chunks of sausage. The best was to see how the bow ties got covered perfectly with the sauce they really need nothing else just enjoy it!

this was really easy and was delicious!  I don't like hot sausage so used sweet Italian sausage and put in some additional spices...parsley, red pepper, celery seed...it was really great!  Will definitely make it again.  Oh, and I added the cream that some reviewers mentioned....yum!

I'm rating this five stars even though I tweaked it a little because it's so versatile and forgiving! I had some precooked Italian sausage and leftover cooked turkey breast to be used in the fridge, and a small amount of farfalle, so I threw this together and it was delicious, even tho it simmered on the stove about twice as long as required because my hubs was delayed at work. I cooked some diced onion and garlic in EVOO, then added a can of diced tomatoes (with basil, garlic and oregano), brought that to a boil, then a simmer, added the pre-cooked meats and wine, added a couple of grinds of Italian seasoning, then let the sauce simmer for what turned into almost an hour before adding the pre-cooked farfalle and a few small chunks of fresh mozzarella about three minutes before serving with a sprinkle of parm. (from the green can). The meats had broken down a bit, but that turned out to be a good thing, as the sauce was just the right consistency, and the flavor was divine! I look forward to trying this when tomatoes and basil are in season (right now, the toms from the stores around here have zero flavor), but this is great for something that uses canned tomatoes, and I'll never look cross-eyed at recipes that mix poultry and pork products again. Thanks!

Pretty good. I added some red pepper flakes to spice it up. Be careful with the wine, the one I used overwhelmed the flavor a bit too much. I think a little tomato paste would have calmed the wine and helped thicken it a bit.

Pretty good. I used mild Italian turkey sausage since I don't like too-too spicy foods.

This is easy to make, but isn't very exciting for my family.  I've tried it a few times exactly as instructed, and it is eaten, but no one touches the leftovers or asks me to make it again.  This last time was probably THE last time.

We (husband, teenager & younger kids) loved this! We used spicy ground pork sausage instead of the turkey sausage so it was a little on spicy side. It was even good reheated for lunch the next day.

I'd give it 3, the family would vote for 4-5 (kinda dry for my liking)

I made this for me and my girlfriend one night a few weeks ago. I have lap band surgery, so ground meats are easier to tolerate. Therefore, I made ground chicken meatballs, but it was just as good. Really, I love this recipe and I will eat it again and again. Leftovers aren't good for more than a day or so though.

I made this recently but did not use chicken - just sausage and it worked well. Did add cream at the end as suggested by others which I feel it needed.
