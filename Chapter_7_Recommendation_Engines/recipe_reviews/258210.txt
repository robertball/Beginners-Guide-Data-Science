This is a game changer when it comes to the game "how to keep salads interesting".  They give it flavor, crunch, and if you add a little brine and oil, no need for fattening dressings. The honey doesn't make them too sweet, which is a plus for me.  I added a few fresh Thai chilies that I pierced before adding (for extra heat). The purple from the carrots seeps into the brine and is quite beautiful. These will make excellent gifts. Thank you for the recipe.
