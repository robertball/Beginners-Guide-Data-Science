The is a wonderful recipe to clean out the fridge with! I like adding chopped yellow chilies to my potatoes. And I don't add the onions too soon so they still retain their crunch. NOTE:: With regards to BLAND potatoes, the TRICK is to add salt n pepper right after you add the potatoes to the pan. It's also the reason you add salt to pasta water, gives them flavor As they COOK and not just on the outside of food.I have learned this the hard way. TRUST ME your days of bland potatoes is Over;)

Good and tasty, but not a keeper for my family. I added a chicken boiloun cube to the potato water as well as oregano and extra dressing to the skillet.

A bit bland and needs some extra time to cook potatoes.

Pretty good, but boil the potatoes in vegetable broth.  Then, after you put everything on the potatoes, top with mozzerella cheese, if your diet allows for cheese, and zap in the microwave for a minute or two to melt the cheese.  Mmm, mmm, a meal in itself!

I loved making this recipe! I use extra cheese, oregano, dressing but I believe it turns out wonderfully!

Sounded good but just didn't work for me. Had to cook longer and just didn't look that appealing. Added some pepper and fresh ground pepper. Maybe with some tweaking, this might be better but I cannot see making this again.

Great Recipe, even better if you change up the dressing. I also tried Sundried Tomato and Oregano Dressing.

I used Avacado vinegarette, and it was good. I might add a tad of sugar next time to offset the tartness, but this was almost as good as my mother's German potato salad (with bacon, which takes that salad off the vegan menu every).
