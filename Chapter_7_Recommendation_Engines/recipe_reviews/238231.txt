Because I wanted  to retain the color of the peppers (I used both green and red) I sautéed them with the onion and garlic, then set them aside.  I cooked the rice separately, toasting the rice in the pan with a little butter  before adding the water and a bit of salt, then simmered for 15-20 minutes until the rice was tender and the water absorbed.  I folded in the sautéed vegetables at the end.  Quiet, understated flavor,  just ride side dish for the seafood I served with it.

Green Pepper Rice Haiku: "Nice change from plain rice! Didn't change one single thing, 'cept changed the servings." Dropped rice to 1/2 c. and reduced the servings/ingredient ratio accordingly. We enjoyed it alongside AR's "Tender Italian Baked Chicken" and a salad, a tasty way to add some color and flavor to plain rice!

It was delicious! I did change the bell pepper for green Chile instead and the kick it has is perfect!

I am always looking for interesting rice recipes but this isn't it.  Easy enough to make but just wasn't crazy about the flavors. I like green peppers but somehow they just didn't thrill me in this recipe. Felt like it needed just a little something else

I thought I had green pepper when I set out to make this, but I only had red and orange! So I made this with red pepper instead, and used green onions to have something green in there. Tasty, and a nice way to use up peppers. :)

This was extremely simple to make and my family enjoyed it.  I used both green and orange pepper in the rice to make it more colorful.  Please note that the recipe calls for converted rice, not regular- that makes a difference in cooking it and you want the best results.  For my own personal tastes I would like to add a little more flavor, either via herbs or spices, but it went over well with all who ate it.  Very simple to prepare.
