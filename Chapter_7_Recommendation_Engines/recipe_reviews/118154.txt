I used greek yogurt that I strained in cheesecloth for a bit to get it thick like sour cream. I did add one teaspoon garlic powder. I did not drop these on baking sheets, I actually used my spring-loaded ice cream scoop to drop these into greased muffin tins. My family LOVED these biscuits. One reviewer is right on the money, these really DO remind us of the Red Lobster biscuits. The soup I paired them with wasn't the best but they did eat every single one of these biscuits by the end of the night!

These turned out really light and fluffy. I took another reviewer's advice, and filled greased muffin cups about halfway to the top. Also added a pinch of salt and pepper. If I were to make them again, I would brush the biscuits with melted butter and garlic a few minutes towards the end of baking. Thanks!

I added 1/3 extra cheese and 2 tsp of galic power to the mixture and then sprinkled cheddar on top of the biscuits about half way through baking process and they came out perfect.

If I looked like a biscuit, my husband would eat me.  He is a biscuit fiend... having said that, my big biscuit-muncher liked these,but he didn't love them.  "They were okay".  Like other reviews said, they are greasey, and for whatever reason mine were quite flat.  Flavor wasn't bad at all, but in the future I will probably buy the pop-in-the-oven variety to satiate my husbands biscuit needs.

These are amazing - I use non-self rising flour so added the baking powder and they were simply amazing!  The best biscuits I have ever made.  No more hockey puck biscuits for me.  The family really liked them. When making them you can tell they are going to taste good as they seem to mix together so nicely.  Very easy recipe - taste almost exactly like the cheddar biscuits at Red Lobster.

This was my first time making biscuits, and i read what the other people said when they reviewed this recipe, so i thought they might have to much flour so i reduced it to 1 & 1/2 cups of flour and i still think they could go down to 1&1/4 cups flour but other than the flour thing they were GRRRRRREAT!!!!!!!!!

I read the reviews and used about1 and a half cups of flour instead of 2 . Also added about 2 table spoons of minced garlic to the recipe , and at the end about 5 minutes before taking them out i sprinkled parmesan cheese on top of them. Everyone enjoyed them.

This is a family favorite and we never have any leftovers. Not a low fat biscuit for sure, but worth the indulgence! They are so yummy served with a hot bowl of stew or soup on a cold winter evening. YUM!

These were easy and fabulous tasting!!  My daughter kept saying how they resembled the Red Lobster biscuits.  My husband came back after dinner to snack on the few leftovers.  We will definitely make again!!  Used a small cookie scopp for perfectly shaped biscuits.  Added 1.5 tsp of garlic powder and added parmesan cheese over the top with about 10 minutes remaining in the baking.

Wow!  This turned out very well.  I was a little skeptical when preparing it but it turned out very good.  It passed the kid test too.  My wife thought it needed something sweet to balance out the flavors but I'll make them just as-is next time except adding the garlic powder.

This recipe is so easy & absolutely delicious!  Everyone that has tasted them has asked for the recipe.  They are very similar to the biscuits served at Red Lobster.  To make them even more special, add a little rosemary & garlic.  Yummy!

Really not sure what the other reviewers were doing to make these greasy and dry...but I have made them time and again and they have turned out perfect every time...the only modifications that I made were adding the garlic powder and a dash of cayenne pepper and a bit more cheese than called for...these biscuits were such a hit with everyone...I have had people rave over them...Definitely worth trying on your own rather than listening to the negative feedback, they were obviously not doing something right.

Excellet Taste but came out pretty flat.  Next time I will soften the butter (NOT melt it) and I will be sure to thoroughly mix my flour, salt and baking powder before adding it to the wet stuff that I have already mixed.  If they look too wet, I will refridgerate the dough for 30 min before dropping onto cookie sheet.  I did add 1 TB garlic powder and 1 TB Garllic Rosemary mix and cut the flour to 1 1/2 cups.  Even though flat, still tasted WONDERFUL!

I don't know why people said they have too much flour, I thought they had too much butter. My first batch came out a bit flat and soggy on the inside. I did use self-rising flour and they were cooked through, not doughy, just soggy. The second time I added an egg (per my husband's suggestion) and reduced the butter to 2/3 cup. They came out much better - 4 stars.

I made the biscuits using half applesauce and half butter. I then dropped them on my beef stew thickening in a skillet and baked, covered for 15 minutes.  It made a great stew casserole.

Wonderful! They turned out fluffy, moist, and delicious. I added some garlic powder and rosemarry, which made it even better. I'm probably going to be making these all the time :)

So good and so fattening. Used unsalted butter and added a 1/2 tsp of salt.  Also added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder at another reviewer's suggestion.  Not quite as fluffy as Red Lobster's garlic cheese biscuits, but these definitely hit the spot.

WARNING: DO NOT USE PAPER MUFFIN CUPS!! The biscuits will just get stuck in them. I actually didn't have any sour cream on hand so I tried plain yogurt instead and they came out great!! (Aside from being stuck in the muffin cups) The flavor is absolutely scrumptious with the buttery flaky effect. Super easy and super good!!!! Oh, i also threw a whole bag of shredded cheddar cheese in mine too, 2 cups, it really added to the cheesy flavor too.

I think this could be a great recipe but it has waaaay too much butter. I followed it exactly (except using AP flour and adding the baking powder and salt). The dough oozed of butter. I went ahead and made 9 biscuits and they baked up but are just greasy inside. The other dough I had left I added more flour and am going to see what happens when I bake them. I'm going to play with this recipe and see what I can come up with.

This drop biscuit recipe is awesome!! I added 1tsp of garlic powder and 1/4 tsp of salt and along with the 1 cup of cheddar cheese, I added 1 cup of shredded mozzarella and 1/2 cup of sliced pepperoni (sliced in half).  They were delicious!  The kids love them!

These were fabulous. I made them exactly as per the recipe but used the baking powder,salt and flour combination as suggested instead of self rising flour and used butter and they turned out awesome. I agree that they are just like the biscuits from Red Lobster.

i'm glad i only baked half of these before the other half. The fist ones became to flat, I assume it was to butter or sour cream. I added more flour to the remaining and they were fluffy...not so greasy and flat looking. Next time I make this, I will  use 1/2 cp butter, 1 cp sour cream or I will use the same amounts of butter and sour cream and add 1/2 cp more flour. I also added 1 tsp of garlic powder. Great taste even though some looked like cookies.

My sister made these for my baby shower and they were awesome!  I have also made them after reading the reviews.  I followed the recipe but also added 2 tsps of garlic powder.  When my sister made them she added 1/2-1 lb of raw sausage into the mixture.  They are fantastic with the sausage.  Yes, they are on the heavier side and if you are looking for a light biscuit this recipe is not for you but it is worth trying.  My husband polished off all of them in one sitting.  PS- This made 32 small drop biscuits.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but I tried this recipe on 2 separate occasions, and both times I was disappointed. (Maybe it just wasn't what I expected??)  They didn't rise or get fluffy like I had hoped.  They had the shape, look and consistency of an oatmeal cookie-  flat, lumpy and chewy.  On the up side, once you get past the texture, they did have a good flavor to them, so I don't think I'll give up on this one yet.  At least, not without some more experimenting.  I think next time I'll try a little less butter as well.

This recipe is wonderful. I made a few alterations to the recipe:  Instead of 1 cup of butter (2 sticks) - I used 1 stick of butter and a half cup of shortening and 2 cups of cheddar cheese.  I found the 1 cup of sour cream was not exactly not enough so I used a cup and a half.  Afterwards, the biscuits was cheesy and moist and so flavorful.  Some reviewers stated if you add 2t of garlic powder and minced onion to the batter it would be like "Red Lobster" biscuits - I totally agree.  Will make this recipe again and again.  Congrats to Ms. Miller on a tasteful bread.

My Grandkids loved these biscuits.  The biscuits didn't rise up as much as I had hoped, but WOW what flavor!!  I added a bit of garlic powder to this recipe, with fantastic results!!  No need to put butter on the table with these!!

I made this at the last minute, and it was my first attempt at making biscuts.  They turned out yummy, but next time I will let the butter and cheese get to room temp, I think that will make them fluffier.  I will definately make them again!

yep...too much flour. LOL

If not for that, these would have been great! Good though overall. I would, however, place in muffin pans greased about half way full. 

Also, if you are like me and cooking for only 2, you may want to cut the recipe in half! It makes a lot!

These are very easy to make.  They are a little heavy, but very good.  I added a bit of grated parmesan and a clove of fresh garlic (pressed).  I will make these again, especially since I am more likely to have sour cream on hand than buttermilk.  Oh I did have to bake them longer than recommended and they never browned, next time I will try a higher temperature.
