Very Good. I used shredded chicken instead of cubes. Also added some toasted slivered almonds, minced red onion and minced red and orange bell pepper.

Sounded great so I chose to make it for a cookout. Yum! I did add to it tho - Cheese that I cubed sliced olives then I cut up (small pieces)steamed broccoli - cooled. I added a little more dressing since I added more veggies (& broccoli soaks up liquid!)So delicious and I was asked to make for Memorial Day Cookout as well! I might add slightly sauteed zucchini &/or summer squash next time!

this was soooo good. a nice change from traditional pasta salad. I added a few slivered almonds for a little more crunch. easy to make also. big hit at the picnic (and no mayo to worry about in the heat). i also used the rotisserie chicken from the store

This was a fabulous dish! I made it for my sister and a picnic her boyfriend was planning for her. I read the reviews and decided to add the juice of one fresh lemon to 2 1/2 cups of dressing. I reserved 1/2 cup for right before serving to moisten the salad. Harris Teeter also has precooked packages of grilled chicken that made this recipe even easier. I am thinking about trying to add lemon zest next time. I am always looking for different and unique pasta salad recipes. This one is definitely a keeper!

We don't eat much meat so I used garbanzo beans instead of chicken. Every last bite was gone!

i love this recipe! i've made it many times and it's nice for outdoors picnics because there's no mayo it doesnt need refrigeration (of course overnight it's better). I omit the lemon juice and celery and add crushed walnuts. I also ran a bit short on the dressing so keep that in mind. one downside (and there's no way to avoid it) is that it doesn't refrigerate that well... it's fine for a day or two but the penne really soaks up the dressing and it can get a little dry. just keep that in mind because this makes a lot of yummy salad!

This was awesome!! I made it exactly like the recipe. No need for any changes. I was afraid I made too much for my family of four but it didn't last long in the fridge!!

I followed recipe but didn't add the green onions and used Rotisseree chicken instead. I also used 1 cup of the Brianna's Poppyseed dressing very yummy! Then added 1/2 cup al dente broccolli then 1 cup of blueberries! Perfect!

I was doubling the batch and ran short of poppy seed dressing so added a can of lemon pie filling along with all the other recipe ingredients. Came out a little sweeter but tasted great and got good reviews.

We really liked this the first time I made it but some people aren't fond of celery. The next time I made it I substituted 1 cup toasted slivered almonds for the celery and it was a big hit with everyone. This is a great recipe to take to a potluck.

So easy and very flavorful. The poppyseed dressing was perfect with the cranberries. I added a few raisins simply b/c I didn't have enough cranberries and it was very good. Will make again and again.

I served this for FOL lunch. It made a lot more than I expected. It could have used some extra chicken. I added bacon and about 1 c shredded swiss cheese. I also added some pepper and a little dressing in the morning before serving. I seasoned and baked the chicken. Then cut it into strips then tore it into pieces
