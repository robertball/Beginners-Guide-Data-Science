Really easy  meal to prepare. I couldn't find my beef broth and chose to throw in a packet of onion soup mix instead as well as some fresh mushrooms. The beef was tender and gravy was flavorful. Great with mashed potatoes.

I'm giving this 3 stars only because it lacked the big beefy flavor I was expecting. The dill is definitely a delicious take on the dish and smelled great in the crockpot! I recommend using beef stock/red wine/splash of balsamic to give the broth a deeper flavor, and only a little sour cream.

I added Worcestershire sauce and lemon juice. I added Parmesan cheese after it was cooked.

So easy and so yummy! I added a can of mushrooms when there was about an hour left. I also seasoned the gravy a little more. It was a little bland but with some extra seasoning, it was a huge hit!

Easy and yummy! I didn't have any beef boullion  cubes, so I just used some dry onion soup mix (same idea, right?). I also added in an 8oz. package of sliced mushrooms, which were a great addition. I served this with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies...the family was happy! Thanks for sharing. :)
