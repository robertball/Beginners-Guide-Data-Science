When I do this recipe I cut the fat by using a combination of 1 part "Light" Hellmann's mayo and 1 part fat-free plain yogurt. That is the basis for most of my salad dressings.  I buy a canister of Hidden Valley Ranch dressing mix at BJ's and use just enough to suit my taste. HVR is good in many other recipes. Yogurt will remove the fishy taste of most any fish.
