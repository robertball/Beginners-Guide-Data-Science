I made a super cheap version of this. I used the store brand mac n cheese, and chili spiced beans. The meal was $0.92. Not including the milk which I already had. I didn't use butter because I like my mac and cheese with out. Really good. It was better than the hamburger helper chili mac, and cheaper. Will make again.

I was short on time and wanted to make my kids something so I found this. They love it and so do I! Super easy and super quick. Hearty enough to be dinner. I used Hormel no bean chili, shredded cheddar and Kraft mac n cheese. Yum!!

This is a great meal when you want something quick, easy, and inexpensive. I use Hormel vegetarian chili.

As a college student, I fully appreciate quick and inexpensive meals. This one is a winner because it combines chili and mac and cheese, two items I always have on hand. Like another reviewer, I too used Campbell Chunky Firehouse chili, since I love spicy chili, and for the shredded cheese topping, I used a Mexican blend. Good stuff, thanks!

I was unsure about this when I gathered the recipe but WOW what a hit.  We have a family of 11 so I made 4 boxes of Mac n cheese and only one can of chili and it was more than enough for little mouths.  Good job on this one.  Thank you!

i took it a lazy step further and use extreme cheese easy-mac.  just microwave the easy-mac while you heat up the chili on the stove top and you're eating in five minutes!!  hit it with some cholula hot sauce and it's on point

Very easy and way more tasty than I'd thought it was going to be. This is now my new fav recipe to make when I'm in a time crunch. Loved by the whole family! Rating is based on recipe if made as instructed. The second time I made it I only had kielbasa on hand and used that with plain chili instead of hot dog chili. I liked it better. But it's already excellent if made as instructed!

This was excellent, but I did use vermicelli (16 oz.) and two cans of chili, one with beans and one without.  Topped this with the grated cheese and chopped white onion after stirring in a couple tablespoons of butter and two teaspoons of Greek seasoning into the well-drained pasta.  Very satisfying and the leftovers were great. Convenient and tasty.

Huge hit with the boys. I used Kraft macaroni and cheese and my own homemade chili. I did add 1/2 cup of extra grated cheddar cheese to the chili mac. They loved it. No leftovers.

Wasn't the best, but wasn't the worst is all I can say about this recipe.  I had high hopes, but the family said all it tasted like was I'd chucked some chili into kd...they've all said don't make it again :(

This is a great way to use up leftover cooked boxed mac and cheese if you don't care for the taste the next day. I pulled out some frozen chili and mixed that in. Easy, cheap, lunch

Yummy comfort food. I did use homemade chili because thats all I had on hand I also added some corn that was lurking in the fridge and some green onions for color. Good stuff.

Those living on a small budget and with limitied time have to appreciate this classic meal. My husband and I are both students and we make this all the time. I like to spice mine up with some chili powder, cumin, and cilantro flakes - all things I keep on hand in my spice drawer.

I've never lived in a dorm room, but I have been tight on money before. Nothing gourmet about it, but still tastes good enough to eat! I still make this now for my little brother (who is 26), he still loves food like this.

Keep these ingredients in your pantry for when you forget to defrost something for dinner.  I used Kraft Dinner and Hormel chili without beans, and topped it with shredded sharp cheddar cheese. My family loves this one.

A good solid chili mac, and it works for whatever variety of mac-and-cheese or chili you prefer. I go for Hormel beanless chili and Kraft Thick & Creamy macaroni and cheese. It came out quite well, for what it is: a convenience food, made of a convenience food and canned food, that is more than the sum of its parts.

This turned out a lot better than I thought it would. I used a can of Hormel turkey chili. I also tried adding a can of tuna instead of the chili, which also turned out tasty.

This was great, especially for the price. I used Nalley Chedder Cheese Chili. Like someone suggested, I used half of the can because I wanted the cheese flavor to really stand out. I sprinkled colby jack cheese on top because that was all I had. The last thing I did was warm and cut up a couple of hot dogs to throw in! Steamed veggies on the side and it's a healthy dinner :)

Oh my!  I knew this would be tasty, but it is DELICIOUS!  Way better than I was expecting.  My husband liked it and is not a hug mac & cheese fan.  All I had on hand was mild chili (and all out of hot sauce!!!), so I can't wait to try it again with hot chili!  The fact that it is super cheap to make is just a bonus.

My husband liked it, I felt it was missing something. It was fast, used on hand ingredients and was super easy to make. I added a little onion and garlic powder to the chili (Hormel with beans ). I'll make this again but add hamburger and chili beans to it instead. In a pinch, this is a good recipe to feed a family on a busy night.

LOL...this was actually pretty ok!I honestly was not really inspired to cook tonight an I stumbled across this and thought id give it a shot! I did switch it up a bit though I made my own stove top mac and cheese I didnt have any boxed kind and i had leftover chili I wanted to use up also! I never keep canned chili in the house.I tossed everything together put it in a baking dish topped it with some cheddar cheese and baked it for about 30 min. It was a fast and yummy comfort meal! I will make this again for sure on my lazy nights...lol

This is one of my favorite dinners to make when it's just me and the kids.  We all love it so much.  I have made it using homemade and canned chili.  Both ways are awesome!  We like to make ours into a "dipper dinner" and eat this with the scoop tortilla chips.  Totally delicious!

I made this with the store brand shells and cheese and a can of hormel turkey chili and beans because that's what I had on hand.  My 5 year old loved.  I thought it was pretty good too.  A nice quick, cheap meal.

My husband loves this, and it's so simple.  You can use whatever kind of chili you want - that's part of the beauty of it.  This is a great staple for when you just don't have the time to cook a big dinner, but you feel like something a little heartier than plain mac and cheese.

My husband absolutely adored this chili mac and he has had a lot of chili mac in his days. He said it was the cheese that made it the best...I put lots and lots of shredded cheese in it. It was great, so easy, and fast!

I can understand why the other reviewer's boyfriend liked this dish, even though he didn't really like macaroni and cheese - it tastes like chili with macaroni in a creamy sauce with only the softest, faintest whisper of the cheese in "macaroni and cheese."  The flavor of the chili (I used Nalley) masked the delightful synthetic flavor of the macaroni and cheese, which is why I (and I must assume everyone else) would ever elect to eat macaroni and cheese. Or maybe my palate is just not cultured enough to detect the subtle flavors of the cheese through the chili. I don't know.  In any case, it was all right. Not good, not bad. It didn't satisfy my need for CHEESE, which is an ever present and ever persistant need.
