AWESOME! I used the TACO BELL EXTREME Taco dinner w/ the red taco shells, which the little guy got the biggest kick out of, lol, and just bought flour tortillas. The whole family devoured these! A winner, winner taco dinner! Served with the mexican-style rice recipe that was on the back of the box (1 cup rice, 1/2 cup salsa (I used med.) and 1/2 cup shredded cheddar), which we also enjoyed. Definately be miking these again! Thanks for sharing. :)
