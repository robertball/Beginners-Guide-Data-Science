I'm not a huge fan of lemon pepper chicken, but this was excellent.  I cut this down to two servings.  I added upped the amount of garlic, used only 1 c. of dry white wine, added some fresh rosemary along with the dry and put everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate overnight.  It was very moist and the flavor was delicious.  The combination of lemon and rosemary really makes this work.

Holy cow, this is some majorly good grub!  And easy to boot.  I love how the spices are used with a very generous hand.  It adds so much flavor, and it's not even salt/sodium laced.  I did not have time to marinate (found this recipe while at work, and cooked it that night), so I took the advice of others who were short on time - to bake in the oven covered with foil, *with* all the marinade.  I made sure to pound the chicken breasts thin for more even cooking - and because I prefer the thinner texture.  I used a lot less white wine than called for (just enough to make sure the chicken pieces were sitting in it, but not fully immersed by it), and I baked for 15 minutes at 350F, and then increased to 400 for the remaining 10 minutes.  Perfect, juicy, succulent chicken!  I plated them and then spooned some of the liquids over each piece for extra moisture (not that it even needed it). :)  The lemon pepper seasoning I have is McCormick's, "California Style", which includes onion and garlic powders.. but it quite heavy on the peppery spice.  I enjoyed it, but it can be a bit much for those who prefer a more mild dish.  Served with steamed asparagus, a cucumber salad, and half of a boiled sweet potato.  Healthy, tasty, and a chicken recipe that will be in my binder, forever.  Thank you for sharing with us.  Oh, one last thing: Beautiful presentation. :)

I didn't have time to marinate, so I followed the recipe as is but baked everything in a glass dish covered with tin foil in the oven for 25 minutes at 350 degrees.  Very juicy and lemoney.  I will make this again.

Wonderful recipe! I've actually made this many many times just because the flavour is so wonderful. It's great to grill these after they've marinaded overnight. It's also a great recipe to cover with tinfoil, and bake in the oven, surrounded by the marinade. So flavourful, and moist! :)

Great, indeed!  I ended up using sherry in place of the wine, and a bit less lemon juice.  Marinated it overnight.  Very good, thanks Brian!!

Very lemony and tasty.  This recipe was super easy and had excellent flavor.  My 2 year old didn't care for all the pepper, so I suppose that means it isn't very kid friendly, but my husband and I really enjoyed it.  I made the recipe as is and wouldn't change anything.

I have found my perfect lemon pepper chicken recipe. I used 15 - 20 turns on my lemon pepper and sea salt grinder. I omited the 1 tablespoon dry mustard and 1 tablespoon dried rosemary, added two tablespoons of fresh chopped basil. Substituted the wine for 24oz of beer. and only used 2 lg chicken breats instead (cause its just me and my husband).  this was the best ever! The chicken was so juicy and tender. I will definatly be making this more often. We had this with a rice pilaf and garlic mashed potatoes! YUM!

I used homemade Lime Pepper (from AR) and lime juice instead of lemon. I also used fresh rosemary. Otherwise, I followed the recipe to make 2 servings. This is very moist and flavorful. I will make it again!

Marinated 2 chicken breasts and cooked one on the grill and one in the oven.  The one on the grill turned out better but the lemon pepper was way too overpowering.  Hubby took two bites and couldn't eat anymore.

We liked this - it is VERY strong in flavors as other reviewers noted but we like that anyway.  I only had 2 cups wine (cant imagine what happened to the other cup LOL ;p ) and it still was just fine!  I would make again but would add a bit of EVOO.

This was a ok chicken recipe.  I followed the directions exactly except I used only a cup of white wine.  I also marinated the chicken overnight.  The chicken itself was moist and tender, but it was a bit too lemony for me.  That's saying a lot, because I absolutely love lemons.  I also cooked some new potatoes alongside of the chicken in the same pan.  The potatoes were so overpowered with lemon juice that I could barely eat them.  I would definitely recommend roasting vegetables in another pan, because the sauce was a bit much.  I probably wouldn't make this one again.

Needs a little tweaking, but this has more "body" than the Lemon Pepper Chicken that I was already making. Still a bit tart with the lemon flavor for me. Next time I'll use a little less lemon or adjust my marinade time.

This was excellent. I didn't have any dry mustard or rosemary, so I used oregano and tablespoon of Dijon. Still very tasty. Thanks!

I usually love lemon pepper chicken so I was excited when I found this recipe.  I am def with the minority on this one.  I did not care for it.  I thought it was way too sour.  I followed the directions with one exception... As I was getting ready to grill it started to thunderstorm so I baked it in the oven.  My father liked it but the rest of us didn't care for it.

I put the rub on a day and a half in advance, then added the wine/lemon juice marinade the morning before I made it for dinner.  I also think the liquid could be reduced.  I poured off half before baking for 45 minutes.  The chicken was very tasty and my lemon pepper-loving daughter thought it was great. I served it with Orzo and Rice from this site, which is very mild and was a perfect side for this dish.

Very nice! I had fresh rosemary, which I prefer, and only had 4 chicken breast. So, everything else the same except I marinaded the chicken for 2 days and when ready to grill, removed from marinade, and lightly salted with kosher salt. Excellent flavor......tasty, nice and crusty outside...tender and juicy inside! Great recipe!

Had a little too much pepper for my tastes but my husband loves it! Didn't have all the ingredients on hand, such as the dry mustard (I used French's yellow mustard) and it still tasted good.

This was truly amazing. I didn't even key it marinate and it was delicious.  I will have to make it again and let it marinate the full three hours.  I am sure the flavor will be super amazing

Loved the flavor of this chicken.  I only made 1/2 of the marinade and it was more than enough.  We baked it in the oven, but next time I won't to try it on the grill.  It would be fabulous.

Wow, the lemon flavor in this really is strong. I would probably make it again but using less lemon pepper or lemon juice. This chicken was incredibly tender and juicy.

Outstanding. I followed the recipe as is, and polished off the bottle of white wine while it marinated. I sliced up the chicken after letting the meat rest for 8 minutes. The whole family loved it.

Excellent recipe.  Served it over lettuce and salad fixings for dinner tonight.  Made a homemade cilantro ranch dressing.  Delish.  Perfect for our 98* temps in Atlanta today.

This recipe was good, but not "great".  From the reviews, I guess I just expected better.....  I made it exactly as stated in the recipe, marinating it longer (started it before work at 8am, then grilled it at 6pm).  I used Tone's lemon pepper seasoning - maybe the brand makes a difference?  I probably won't try this one again, it took awhile to prep in the morning (and my hands smelled like garlic all day long).  There are easier recipes for grilled chicken breasts out there!

Made last night exactly as is except only used one cup of the white wine.  Absolutely delicious and my husband said "it's a keeper".  Thank you for sharing!

This is tasty but be forewarned - it's strong. I adapted it for the oven by rubbing the spice mixtures into whole piece of chicken, pouring on the liquid, and baking it uncovered at 350 for one hour.

I was surprised by how delicious this turned out being.  I thought that the amount of wine called for was way too much, so I just halved the amount of wine and added 2 more tbsp. of lemon juice (which is much cheaper to use by the way!).  The chicken turned out moist and very flavorful--also did a quick saute of mushrooms (to have w/the chicken) using the same ingredients-they turned out super!

This was good, but a little too much lemon juice for me.  Will make again using 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.

This was amazing. I made it according to directions, but since I do not have an outdoor grill, I grilled it on my cast iron grill pan. I reserved the marinade and made a white wine reduction sauce to serve over the chicken. So good! This is definitely a do again in my house!

Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and let marinade overnight. The chicken was juicy and had a great lemon flavor. My family and guests loved it.

Very good meal with the sauteed garlic asparagus and some pilaf rice. I will add more garlic to the asparagus.

I baked this recipe--way too much rosemary & lemon juice flavor. I cut the wine a bit too, and it was still nice & moist. Fixing the seasoning amounts and this would be great!

Adapting this to the oven as one reviewer suggeseted didn't work out for me. Though I love lemon pepper, it was way too peppery even though I cut the lemon pepper in half.

This turned out ok but that's because I cut wayyyy back on the lemon pepper and wine. Marinated the chicken for about 3 hours, and cooked it on the Foreman grill. Served it with Green Beans with Anchovies, and a baked tater. Good stuff!
