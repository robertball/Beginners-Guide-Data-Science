As I was preparing this, and again when we were eating it, hubs and I realized I had made this before (a variation of this recipe on this site) and that we loved it as much this time as the first. I don't know why this simple combination of cheese and mayo makes this so extraordinary and delicious, but it does. I didn't bother to soak the fish in milk first, which shouldn't be necessary if it's really fresh.  I just seasoned it with pepato, an Italian fish seasoning of sea salt, pepper, lemon and orange zest, then sprinkled the cheese mixture with paprika to give it color. Unless your filets are really thick, I'd start off with less baking time--you can always give it a few minutes more, but fish can get overdone quickly.

I use to cook this when I worked for the officers club on Eielson AFB, Ak. We actually minced a small onion and added it to the mayo mixture.  I believe they originally got the recipe from the Princess hotel in Fairbanks.  i have only had this with halibut but I assume it would be tasty with other white fish.

I didn't have any Monterey Jack cheese, but this was GREAT with just the cheddar!!  My husband fills the freezer with halibut every year and this will be a regular at our house!  My 2 & 4 year olds ate every last bite!  Thank you for this recipe.

This is one of my husband's favorite halibut recipes.  Funny reading other reviewer -- the first time we had this was at the Officer's Club at Eielson AFB, and we called to find out what it was called so I could make it at home.  I sometimes use light mayo and add garlic or garlic powder.  It's very rich (and halibut is expensive if you're not catching it in Alaska yourself)so it's more of a special occasion dish now.

Wow!  So easy and so tasty!
I only used cheddar cheese and omitted the mustard, but, even so, this was delicious.
I rarely make the same recipe twice, but this will be a regular for sure.
Thanks.

I happened to buy haddock and didn't bother to soak the fish 1st.  It tasted fine.  I think you could put the topping on many different kinds of fish (scrod, etc.).

Easy and quick.  My neighbor is kind enough to share his Halibut from Alaska so our filets were nice and thick.  I did not have mayonaise so used Miracle Whip and it worked fine.  Otherwise, I did not change a thing.

When I made this very exact dish, I was actually using a recipe I picked up at a very popular fish restaurant in Los Alamitos, CA.  They named it Cheesy Dill Halibut.  It is a very good dish, but I would recommend using only half the amount of sauce unless you need a lot of it to spread over rice or potatoes or some veggie.  Easy and delicious.

Very tasty recipe!  I used 1/2 cup mayonnaise and 1/2 cup sour cream, and substituted parmesan for the monterey jack cheese.  I also added a squirt of lemon juice.  After I topped each halibut steak with this cheese mixture and spread it out, I sprinkled Italian bread crumbs for a crunchy topping.  My hubby and his guest loved it - I couldn't believe how moist it keeps the halibut.  I'll definitely prepare halibut this way in the future!

I'm sorry but this just did not work for me. Maybe because I used medium-sharp chedder, but the combination with the halibut did not sit well. The unique flavor of the halibut was ruined. I've tried a similar recipe that used purely parmesan and it was much better.

Very, very delicious.  Made with very few changes.  Next time I will use a bit less mayo--it kind of overpowered the fish.  Husband LOVED.  Will make again.

This is a wonderful recipe and so easy - just what we like.   Have substituted fresh haddock (less expensive) for halibut with good results.  Do not try frozen fish.

Loved the recipe.  Just got some halibut right off the boat on the west coast so it was as fresh as it can get.  I might go with a bit less dill next time as I am not that fond of dill, but that is a personal preference. 
I also added a picture of my plate prior to the meal being vacuumed off the plate I ate it so fast!  I am glad I make enough for 4 meals as it was still just as good as leftovers at work, and people were begging for the recipe!  It got eaten just as fast at work!  It was that or it be eaten by my co-workers!  Vultures is what my co-workers are when I bring this meal in!
This would also work with most other white fishes.  Many thanks to the original recipe poster.

I used just cheddar cheese for this, and I thought it turned out pretty good.  My halibut pieces were fairly thick, so I baked them 31 minutes, and they were cooked perfectly.  We were overall pretty pleased, but I may cut down on the topping next time because it was a little too heavy on top.

The first time I tried this, it turned out really well, and we both loved it.  The sauce worked out beautifully.

But the second and third time, for some reason, the mayo and cheeses separated.  It tasted fine, but looked pretty awful.  I would love to hear if someone could tell me why this happened!!

This was very good but I didn't soak it in milk and lemon, such a combination would curdle.

We had this for dinner last night and both of us really liked it!  I used tilapia (total about 11 oz.) and only made 1/4 of the mayo/cheese mixture.  It was still a little bit too much for the amount of fish I had.  I used a combination of Cheddar and a mozzarella/provolone blend, which worked nicely.  I also topped it with buttered panko.  This baked up perfectly moist in 30 minutes.  We will be enjoying this one again!

To be fair, this review is made on a minor change.  I didn't have any monterey jack, I just used parmesan instead.  I didn't find that this was all that interesting, I think it needs a little seasoning on it before spreading the mixture over it.

Living in Southeast Alaska means always having halibut in the freezer...a good thing.  Finding this recipe for a change of pace from our traditional onion, mayo and sour cream style halibut...a VERY GOOD thing!  We pair this with garlic green beans and love every bite!

We cook a lot of halibut so I thought I'd try this one for something cheesy and new. It was just too much sauce, too much dill for me. My husband said it was "ok" but I didn't like it enough to keep the recipe or make again.

This is SO GOOD!  Every time I make it, all are impressed :)  I usually use about half as much cheese, I've tried with just Cheddar and it was still great.  I've also used regular prepared mustard and it worked well.  Thank You so much for sharing this recipe!

Wow - this was great, and I don't even care much for Halibut.  My kids who aren't fish fans ate this up!  Next time I will try to reduce the sauce though, maybe half the portion as it is a ton of fat and calories, but so yummy!

This was an easy recipe, and went well. I prefer crunch-fried fish, but my family enjoyed it this way.  I used Tilapia fillets, and they were very good.  No problems in following the recipe and the times. I might have preferred it a little less cheesy, but it came out well done, and very attractive.

I have made this for years since, here in Alaska, we catch plenty of halibut. For a moist, tender dish, I cook it in the microwave with no topping for half the time, then drain any juices, add the topping and finish. This only takes a few minutes and should NOT be overcooked. It is my husband's favorite. It's also great spread with tartar sauce instead of the mayo mix. You can hardly go wrong!

I used fresh dill instead of dry. It was really wonderful. I thinly sliced some yellow squash and put it in the pan underneath the fish and sauce. I did find that the fish was still raw after the allotted time and cooked it an additional 2 minutes in the microwave before serving it.

I made this as stated except I forgot the mustard powder. I also used 1lb halibut and 1lb orange roughy. It was really, really good but a wee bit heavy with the mayo. I wondered about maybe sour cream next time instead. I would make it again just like this however.

You can also skip the mustard and add chopped bell pepper and green onion to the topping.  It's awesome!!!!!!

I don't know if it's because I didn't cook enough halibut or if because I used Miracle Whip instead of regular mayo, but I did not care for the taste.  All I could taste was warm miracle whip!  My husband and his friend loved it though.

Excellent as is.  One may find it easier to use pre-mixed cheese blend in a bag, but the real flavor is in freshly shredding each type.  For an Italian flare use the Mozza!  In order to keep the calories and fat grams down, use light mayo!

I'm probably the only one who didn't like this dish.  Cheese on fish just seems wrong, but I kept an open mind and tried it.  I was not impressed and unfortunately I undercooked the fish (which I pan fried first then baked for 35 mins!) I didn't realize it until I took a big mouth full 1/2 way thru the fish.  Anyhow the dish was very greasy and too mayonnaise’ie for me (and I love mayo).  I won’t be making it again.  Maybe it would be better on chicken?

Wow 5 stars for simplicity! Sometimes the best recipes are just basic and easy. I tried this one with cod since I didn't have halibut and it was delicious. The only thing I added to the mixture was salt, pepper and paprika. After the cod was finished cooking I served it with fresh lemon squeezed on top. Yum! Next time I will toss some grated parm cheese and/or breadcrumbs on top too. This one's a keeper!

Great recipe.  Did change it a little.  Used 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup sour cream.  Everyone liked it but we did feel it could use a little less sauce so I will just cut it back next time.  I also think i will put some sliced onions in the pan first and roast them a bit and then lay the fish on top before baking.

We didn't care for this at all and actually didn't finish a normal portion size. Halibut is not cheep and I feel like we wasted it with this recipe. It tasted too salty too cheesy(and I LOVE cheese)and too greasy.

Outstanding recipe! It is what I consider a “launch pad” recipe. You can augment with other spices, but personally would be cautious since the white fish has a delicate flavor. I like the mustard and a little curry--my husband cannot leave out the hot sauce, but that is after it is served. I have used this recipe with halibut, flounder, cod and tilapia. The tilapia, being such a soft fleshed fish, almost melded with the cheese. Absolutely wonderful.

It was ok.... read reviews too late... Halibut or any fish if fresh should NEVER SMELL FISHY... if it does it is OLD on the verge of turning... TAKE IT BACK...  I know because I am a commercial fishermans wife and old fish smells.  The strong mayo and cheese is maybe used to cover the of old fish.

This is the BEST recipe I've found for baking any kind of fish....it gets pretty rich tasting after awhile, so I've started substituting 1/2 sour cream for 1/2 of the mayo and it's a bit lighter.  Amazing recipe that nothing can live up to so far!

I made this last night to rave reviews.  I didn't have dill, so added cilantro and cayenne pepper to give it some kick.  My husband thought it was the best fish he had ever eaten.  Although I wouldn't go that far, it was very tasty with the Tex-Mex variation.

This seemed like a great dish (esp after reading all the reviews...) but I think my choice in fish let me down. I used Sheri, a saltwater fish readily available in the Middle East, and all I could taste was the sauce. So for now, I'm afraid 3 stars, but as soon as I try this recipe with a different, assumably more flavourful fish I will be sure and update. The sauce itself was as expected: very tasty! I noted all the other reviewers additions and added paprika, onion and garlic. Made for a lovely topping which is incidentally also very good on melba toast also popped into the oven for 6-7 mins! Lovely appetisers..

I thought this might be a better recipe for an inexpensive fish. The mayonnaise flavor was very heavy and covered most of the wonderful halibut flavor.

I am a bit on the fence about this recipe. The flavor was great, but it was very rich (even with fat free mayonnaise). At almost $18.00 a pound for Halibut (at least here in Denver), I would like to taste the fish a bit more and the sauce did overwhelm the fish a bit. I suppose if you don't like the "fishy" flavor of fish, this recipe would be a great choice for you, but I love fish and cook it at least twice a week.

Taste was great according to my family (as I don't eat fish) the only thing I was dissappointed with is that the topping never turned golden as in the picture in the time given to cook fish. Maybe it was my fault, I think next time I will turn the broiler on for the last 5 or so minutes. Other then that it was a hit and I am told will be asked for again.

Mm good. This is really easy and all ingredient are pretty basic. My family is not big on fish and all five of my kids ate every bite even asking for more. They usually say eww fish. This makes this a definite keeper.

This was really good.  I did make a couple of adjustments.  I didn't have any monterey jack cheese, so I substituted mozzerella, but I bet it would be great with pepper jack.  I also added some lemon pepper and diced onions into the mix.  Last, but not least, I substituted 1/2 of the mayo with sour cream.

Awesome! I served the fish with the remaining sauce and it was delicious! I rinsed the halibut with water and then soaked it in milk...a suggestion by a previous reviewer....and this made the fish less fishy tasting and more meaty. I will make again!

I'm rating this five stars because I really liked the ease of this dish and I thought it was very, very good.  My significant other didn't like it at all, so I think if you like fish with a rich cheesy sauce, you'll love it and if you don't, well...everyone else will love it, so make it anyway.

We found this tasted like it was slathered in Mayo. So with the leftovers the 2nd night we added more of each of the cheeses and added some cream cheese and more dill and it was great! We would recommend using 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup cream cheese instead of 1 cup mayo.

DEEEEELICIOUS!!  Wow!!  The grocery store was out of halibut...they said it was seasonal, so I used Red Snapper (also pricey!) I followed the recipe, except I added an extra cup of monterey jack cheese.  I didn't soak the fish & it turned out great!  This is definitly one of my top favorites from this recipe site!!  Even my boyfriend (who doesn't like seafood) LOOOOOVES this recipe!!  Highly Recommend!

Love this recipe.  I used white cheddar cheese and then wished I had added some parmesan so it would brown a little.  I wondered why the name "Weaver."

Willing to try this again. It was way too much topping for 2lb and I think that's why it didn't brown for me by the time fish was done. But good flavor so is try again w much thinner coating.

I served this for supper last night with spinach cranberry salad and rice pilaf.  Delicious!  The only thing I did differently was add about 1 T. of finely minced onion to the topping just because it was leftover from my salad dressing.

Wonderful and easy.  Very moist.  My husband loved it and asked that I make sure to keep a copy of the recipe.  I used a NuWave oven instead of conventional so had to adjust cooking time a little.

This is the best way to cook halibut that I have ever had the pleasure of sticking my fork into.  I purchased a beautiful, thick piece of forty dollar heaven at Whole Foods to use in this dish.  The fish must have been flopping on a boat somewhere in Alaska an hour before I bought it.  Wow!  Upon preparing it, I served it to my father whose face lit up when he tasted it. The dill was a pleasant surprise.  The whole thing was wonderful!

Great recipe, it reminds me of living back in Alaska.  One thing however is that I cut back on the amount of Dill used.  The first time I tried this one, it was a little too much.  Otherwise, one of my favorite for Halibut.

This was good but I wouldn't make it again. For the cheeses I used packaged shredded Mexican-blend cheese that included both Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses. I also wanted to minimize the mayo taste so split the mayo amount with sour cream. (Still too mayo-y) I also soaked the fish in whole milk and lemon juice for several hours and it really helped cut back on the fishy taste, but my picky eaters still complained; still in the hunt for the fish recipe for non-fish lovers. HA-HA!! BTW used Pollock b/c it's what the store had that day.

This was really good, super moist and tasty. I didn't notice any fishiness, as some of the other reviews had soaked in milk to remove. I only had cheddar cheese and it was great! Next time I will grate more cheese on the top.

This recipe is a keeper. I soaked in milk first, didnt have fishy taste or smell. i used cheddar alone and it was great.

This was a little too greasy but my two year old loved it! Still ver good. I might soak it in milk next time to get rid of the fishy flavor.
