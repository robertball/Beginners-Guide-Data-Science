One of the best I have made or tasted.  A real family hit! The only change made was I made my graham cracker crust a bit different, but all in all followed the receipe and it turned out perfect.

I made this recipe twice and it came out perfect. Two things I did differently. I lowered the temperature of the oven by 20 degrees to prevent over heating since I was using a dark, nonstick springform pan which absorb more heat.  Also to keep my cheesecake moist I placed a pan with water on the bottom rack while I was cooking the cheesecake on the rack above it. No cracks, easy to make. Hassle free!! Love it, Yes I would recommend this recipe. Enjoy!

For crust 18 crackers is way too much especially for the little butter he adds. I would use only NABISCO original graham ..About 12-15 crackers should do it, finely crushed -add 6tbs melted unsalted butter, a dash of kosher salt and 2 tbs of white sugar if you wish along with dashes of cinnamon/ nutmeg powder. I baked crust for 10 minutes at 350 (others bake theirs at 375 for 7 minutes). I foil a cookie/sheet pan not the actual springform as I don't place mine in a water bath (I simply fill a rectangular pan with hot water and place it on the lowest rack of the oven -- cheesecake/ cookie sheet on middle rack). I zest lemongrass rather than a lemon, and orange zest. I use high grade vanilla extract (haitian vanilla essence is amazing in my opinion). I mix light or heavy cream with lowfat or regular milk to total 2/3 cup of "milk". Sour cream, eggs, cream, milk, butter all at room temp and have to be very very very soft or warm because I mix everything by hand/spoon.  I bake my cake at 325 not 350 for just under 1 hour ( 57-58 minutes does the trick with toasted sides puffed up and a bit of jiggle in the middle. I crack oven door open to cool with no heat for exactly ONE hour. No cracks EVER! Cool on counter for ONE hour - chill in fridge overnight covered with foil or plastic wrap. When taken out of oven I run warm butter knife around edges to prevent from sticking to ring. AMAZING!! Amazing!!????

this recipe is NOT good at all, i made it, fallow all the directions and it does not taste like cheesecake at ALL, the crust had no taste to it and after looking at other recipe is missing sugar.  I would've give no start but I have to so one it is.

I really liked this recipe. I did add a little more butter to the crust so it would stick to the sides of the pan better. I used my KitchenAid mixer to mix the filling ingredients but I over beat it the first time I made it and it was too airy. I was more careful the next time and it came out perfect. That time I didn't have a lemon or an orange to zest so I substituted key lime and tangelo zest. I had to take it out of the oven a little early so I could cook my roast. It cracked a little, but not as much as most of my cheesecakes have. I have served it with homemade blackberry sauce and with homemade lemon curd. Both were ever so tasty!

My mom wanted a NY style cheesecake for her birthday so I decided to make her one.  Glad I found this recipe.  It was easy to make and mine did crack a bit on top but I think that I may have over baked it a little bit. Both my mom and aunt are from NY and they raved about this, other friends of my mom could not stop eating it.  Will be my go to recipe from now on. Easy to make, not a lot of ingredients and light and tasty.

This is an amazing recipe. It came out perfectly and is the best cheesecake I have ever tasted, and that's including any cheesecakes ever purchased in bakeries.

Almost perfect. It was really easy to make. My only hiccup came with the graham cracker crust--it wasn't enough to cover the bottom of the pan. Maybe I prefer a thicker crust, but I found myself crushing even more graham crackers and melting even more butter twice. Consider doubling the amounts for butter and graham cracker. Other than that, it was so good, my mouth is watering typing this review.

This cake was fantastic!! Some complained that it was dense, but honestly, that's kinda the point of cheesecake. Also, to anyone giving bad ratings to cheesecakes because it cracked, it's not the recipe's fault. Cheesecake cracks because the internal temperature gets too high, not because there is something wrong with the recipe. It really bothers me when I see one-star reviews because the cheesecake cracked. It's your fault, not the recipe's.

My only "quibble" such as it is - clarity of a couple of details.  "Small spot" in the middle - apparently my spot was TOO small, as I ended up slightly overbaking it.  Also recipe doesn't specify to soften the cream cheese - I know it needs softened - but someone completely unfamiliar with making cheesecake could get frustrated wondering how the heck to whisk solid cream cheese!  I also subbed about 2 tsp of lemon juice as I didn't have zest on hand - flavor was superb.  Oops, also subbed 1 cup greek yogurt for the sour cream - texture and flavor was still excellent.  Overmixed - my fault, I know better.  The overbake - had never made it this way before, and my guess on the "small" was off.  I should've shut off the oven when it was about silver dollar size.

I'm sorry. Nothing personal, but I followed this recipe to a "T" and it doesn't taste like New York Style cheesecake. It is far too sour and doesn't taste at all like cheesecake. But, that is strictly my opinion. By the reviews, many people like it. I love New York Style cheesecake, but this isn't it for me. -- Again, I'm sorry about this review.

My daughter requested a Home-Made cheesecake for her graduation. I couldn't find the recipe I have used for years so I came to Allrecipes looking for a good cheesecake. My cheesecake always cracks so I liked that this recipe included a trick to prevent that. Even though Chef John's cracked in his video. 

I followed the recipe with the exception of needing to add a little more butter and adding sugar to the crust mixture. I baked for 50 min then turned off my oven and let it sit. I checked after a couple of hours and still no crack!!! After cooling in the oven and on the counter for 3 + hours I placed in the fridge uncovered so avoid moisture buildup. Next morning I took it out of the fridge and had my husband witness that I had successfully made a cheesecake with no crack!! It was BEAUTIFUL and looked perfect from top to bottom. Next test... the taste at the party. I had the graduate take the first piece and she loved it!! I felt it was a little on the lemony side but otherwise great taste and texture. YUMMY!! We have a new cheesecake recipe in the family for sure. Thanks Chef John!

Absolutely loved this recipe! I made it for a friend's birthday because she doesn't like regular cake (She was going to make it herself, tsk). She loved it, I loved it, it was so dense and heavy and rich and perfect. I just now sent the link for this to a friend, seriously so so good. The only thing I changed was the base, I used digestive biscuits because you can't get graham crackers in my country.

Best (and easiest) cheesecake ever!! I make it REALLY simple and buy the premade graham cracker crusts (6 minis or larger one) so I don't worry about the crust! It always comes out perfectly--except mine ALWAYS crack on top no matter what you do. I'd say just accept it! 
I just made Brownie Cheesecake Bars using this recipe. Make brownies according to box or use other recipe, then pour THIS cheesecake over the top and bake! It's cooking now, so we'll see how it turns out!! ????
P.S. To the user that gave it one star and said there was no sugar (no wonder it didn't taste good to them!), the recipe DOES call for sugar, so they most likely forgot it! Which yes, in that case it WOULD probably taste gross!

Have made this twice.  Excellent!  I love the texture...a bit lighter than a real heavy New York cheesecake but definitely enough "weight".  Smooth and creamy.  Love the hint of citrus...why chef calls it "sunshine"!  Mine cracked both times but that doesn't bother me at all.  I too made a little bit more graham cracker crumbs for the bottom and I did grease the pan....no sticking.  This is a keeper for sure.

Loved it, so creamy and smooth. I didnt have orange zest and use a tablespoon of lemon juice since I didnt have lemons & still great. I did lower the temperature to 325 instead though since I halfed the recipe.

Very bland in taste! The crust needed way more butter, the cake had little to no taste and leaving it in the over after it was done cooking only over cooked it. I might try it again, but increase both the sugar and the vanilla. I will also either under cook it and leave it in the oven or fully cook it and take my chances on the cracking.

I loved the cheesecake, but the 3 to 4 hours thing is probably not the best thing I liked to put it in the refrigerator over night which gave it a cool and fresh taste!

I have to send a huge thank you to Chef John! He has taught me so much when it comes to cooking and baking! I have finally made a cheesecake! The recipe videos are wonderful for a beginner baker! I have made this recipe 4 times now. The first time I made it exactly as stated. The other 3 times I did not add any zest. Loved it, absolutely Amazing! Thank you Chef!

Made it, but it still cracked, I'll try it another day.  Flavor is good, but I'm not crazy about the texture, not how I remember NY cheesecake.

The crust was way too dry. The cake had a large crack in it. It was not cooked in the middle.

This cheesecake was a hit!

I made it exactly as described in the recipe.  Used the wooden spoon technique and everything (although I was very tempted not to and use the KitchenAid mixer instead).  I used my food processor for the graham crackers, which worked out perfectly.  One thing I did was take it out of the oven after a couple of hours and let it sit out, covered with wax paper, at room temperature, for a while.  In all it cooled about 3  hours before we ate it.   This cheesecake was the perfect consistency, no cracks, and the crust was divine.  It was delicious when it was cooled, ate some for breakfast the next morning with my coffee.  I will definitely make it again!

Best cheesecake I've ever had.  Even my mother-in-law loved it.  She wouldn't stop talking about it the whole time she was visiting.  I made it along with Chef John's strawberry sauce.  You can't go wrong with this.

This recipe is easy peezy! I love it. This is my 3rd time making a cheesecake with this recipe and it comes out perfect each time. The last time, I put the cheesecake pan in a hot water bath. But either way it still comes out perfectly without cracks! Thanks Chef John

Thanks for sharing the recipe and the video as it helps a lot. This is my first cheese cake and its turn out great. Dense and delicious. Even thought I am force to do some substitution as where I lived, sour cream is not available and I dont have yogurt in hand, I use homemade buttermilk.(as buttermilk is not available as well)

For the graham crackers I used 2 1/2 cups (crushed) as I do not know how much is 18 graham crackers.

For topping I use homemade Golden syrup.(recipe by Todd kitchen)As I did not leave long enough in the fridge to set, when cutting the crumbs did comes a bit lose. Its taste better the next day and less crumbs.

Oh my! This is the first NY style cheesecake I've ever made. I am an experienced baker & was skeptical about leaving it in the oven for so many hours after baking, but it turned out perfectly. No cracks! My only change was subbing non fat milk & light sour cream. It was creamy & with a light citrus undertone. My dad & husband loved it. Thanks, Chef John!

After MANY failed attempts at a beautiful cheesecake with no cracks, I finally have in to the water bath. It made all the difference. This recipe has always tastes great even with the cracks, but now I'm proud to show it naked! Thank you Chef John!!

Great recipe.

It turned out well for me. No cracking, amazing texture and taste. Everyone absolutely loved this cheesecake. Loved it. Now people are asking me to make them cheesecake for the holidays.

The citrus really brightens up the flavor and like Chef said... made it feel lighter, despite being very dense, rich and creamy.

Thank you for sharing this recipe with us all.

This is my "go to" cheesecake recipe. I personally omit the citrus ingredients and instead of graham cracker crust make my own oreo crust. Everyone who's had it (I make it A LOT) absolutely love it and even offer to pay me to make them one. Chef John, you did GOOD

I made it and got a crack on top just like the one in chef john's video! But then I made it again, and again--- they were EXCELLENT. No changes to the recipe, followed chef johns video instructions, never made a cheesecake before, will probably never use another recipe again because we love it so much. Now I'm looking for variant cheesecake recipes! Tried to upload the photo I took of it and posted on Facebook, but the iPad is limited :-(, so you'll just have to take my word for it!

Be sure to leave the cake in the oven and refrigerate! I cut my cheesecake prematurely and it was soggy in the middle and the crust crumbled. Then I decided to refrigerate it for a few hours and it came out perfect! This recipe made cheesecake easy to make, albeit a long process. Thank you!

This recipe was a great success! Everyone raved about it. The only change I made was adding the juice of one lemon, because I like lemon.  I also added more butter to the crust and added 1/3 cup sugar .  Fabulous texture.  Yes, I will make it again.  Next time I will leave out the zest and just use 2tsp vanilla for something different with cherry topping.  The top did not crack after 4 hours cooling in the oven. I cooled another hour on the counter.

Absolutely the best tasting cheesecake I’ve ever made! It was a big hit for Christmas Eve dessert! Only problem was mine did crack but it sure didn’t affect the taste! I followed the directions of turning off the oven and letting it sit but it still cracked.
I will definitely make it again.

I have made this cheesecake 3 times and every time it has tasted AMAZING. I have one piece of advice for first timers making this: make sure you let your cream cheese get to room temp before creaming with sugar... it is 100x easier than dealing with cream cheese you just bought and/or took out of the fridge.

Also, I've made it 3 times and haven't been able to keep it from cracking. I've tried exactly as the recipe stated, as well as turning down the oven temp and decreasing the actual baking time (recipe calls for ~1 hour)... All 3 times the cheesecake still cracked massively. Unsure how to beat this problem.

I have been making cheesecake from this recipe for over a decade now, and it’s never let me down. I normally don’t add the zest (friends with citrus allergies), but also a great recipe to expand and play with.

I finally made one that didn’t crack.  I put a roasting pan with water in the oven with it.  I read somewhere that it raises the humidity enough to keep moisture in the oven so the cake doesn’t crack.  Thanks Chef John!

I substituted the flour with cornstarch, sour cream with heavy whipping cream (I didn't have any sour cream on hand), and added about 1 Tbsp of sugar to the graham cracker crust.   Baked it for 1 hr - 1.5 hr @ 325°F in a waterbath.  I turned off the oven and left the cheesecake in for about 3-4 hrs until its set.  It turned out great.

It came out beautifully!  I cooked it for about 1hr and 10 minutes....but of course, all ovens vary. I served it with cherry pie filling with an extra can of tart cherries.

Followed the recipe exactly as instructed. I think the hour bake time is a little long for my oven, maybe 55 mins. in the future. Overall: great taste, great bake, will bake again!

I've been baking for 35 years so I'm  no amateur. I measured and remeasured the pan size and ingredients (I even had family double check it) but ended up with almost 3 cups too much filling for the 9 inch springform pan.

I read the "Tip to making Cheesecake. I left out the ingredients so they would be at room temp. The warning was if not, you could have lumps. I did so but still had lumps and had to strain my batter. I had no orange zest but doubled the lemon zest. I used a water bath and I had no cracks. It was better than I expected and I will make it again. Oh, it was a hit at the work potluck lunch.

Very nice recipe. I added orange zest and alittle squeezed orange in the cheese batter. Plus, I made a blueberry topping.

I used this recipe to make my very first cheesecake. When I make a new recipe I always look to see if there is one by Chef John, his recipes never disappoint and I love that they usually include a video. This cheesecake came out great and  I will definitely use it again!

The flavor was fine, but it does not look anything like a cheesecake. Everything was prepared as per the recipe with one exception, used a pre-made pie crust. The cheesecake ended up rising up to the size of 2 pies, and yes it was all-purpose flour that was used.  In addition, the mixture ended up being enough for 2 pie crusts. There was absolutely no way to fit it all in 1.

I made it and was very much looking forward to a real oven baked NY style Cheesecake...  however the result was no more a Cheesecake than I am.  It tasted more egg than anything else.  Unfortunately a total waste of time and money on a worthless recipe that has nothing to do with a NY style Cheesecake.  The final result went right into the trash....  Perhaps if I had used a bacon & sausage topping instead of strawberries it would have gone down better.  Guess it`s back to making the no bake cheesecake, at least it is sweet and tastes somewhat like the real thing.

Def a keeper. I omitted the citrus; mine was a salted caramel cheesecake so I thought plain would taste better with those toppings.  I also baked it in a cheesecake bath.  No cracks!  Thanks for the tips on preparation ... i think hand mixing did help in achieving the perfect texture and beautiful, smooth top.   Enjoyed by all; tasted as good as it looked!

This is an awesome easy recipe. Just do it.  You will love it and this recipe is pretty bomb proof.  You can't really mess this up and you end up with a very tasty treat no matter what topping you put over the top of it.  This is the second time that I made this recipe and I took a tiny bit of the batter and mixed in some melted choc-chips then swirled it into the rest of the batter before cooking.  Turned out marvelous!!  Ended up with a major crack in it so next time I am going to check at 45 mins instead of 55 mins.

I used chocolate graham crackers for the crust and added 1/3 cup sugar with 1/3 cup butter. Followed the rest of the recipe, but omitted the lemon and orange zest. Added 1 tsp of lemon juice. Tasted amazing! Thick, rich, and just the perfect amount of sweet. Delicious with fresh strawberries. My daughter requested this for her 17th birthday today!

Love this recipe, the only things I did to change it was the flour to gluten free and used zing and left out the zest. And replaced it with almond extract. It came out so good it’s almost gone already. Will be making this again

It tastes really good y'all. It's cheap, creamy, and the crack is there to tell you it's not store-bought. I might have used less lemon zest than it should have. 1/4 tsp seemed so little, but I went with it. I'm going to make another in a week or so.
Another thing I forgot was to do the "ole tapa tapa" and didn't leave it in the oven as Chef John said to do. 
It is an excellent recipe. Next time there will be a bit more lemon-y taste to it.

Wonderful recipe.  Loved the addition of the citrus.  This is the first cheesecake I've ever made that did not crack.  Followed recipe as written. Next time I may double the crust recipe to go all the way up the springform pan.

Really good cheesecake, didn’t expect it to turn out as well as it did because I didn’t have enough cream cheese or sour cream. I reduced the amount of sugar and replaced graham crackers with digestives, a good substitute. Will try this again!!

Excellent recipe, I’ve made several versions of cheesecakes before, but I needed to check what I needed as I recently relocated out of the country. The only thing different I normally do that I’d suggest here is a way to prevent cracks. Not only cooling on the oven, but I bake my cheesecake in a water bath. I take my springform pan, and wrap the bottom in foil (leaving the top exposed) then place the whole pan in a larger baking pan filled with water. This baked the cake a bit more gently and lets it cook more gently so cracks are far less common. Also, I add eggs at the end, as eggs tend to hold air and less mixing with the eggs means less air, and the air pockets also cause cracks.

This recipe is incredibly good. Rave reviews from my guests! Like many of the other reviewers stated, the graham crackers w/ butter needed a size modification. I used 7 oz. of graham crackers with 5 T of butter and it made a perfect crust. I used Trader Joe's cinnamon crackers and they needed no other additions. I cooked the rest of the recipe the same as specified but added 15 minutes since it really was too wet to pull sooner. I only left the oven closed after cooking for one hour then cooled it on the counter, waiting till it was @ 65 degrees temp before refrigerating for 5 hours. It did crack  the middle but not horribly. I took it out of the fridge 1.5 hours before serving. This is now my favorite cheesecake recipe!

The first cheesecake i made cracked and the second one didn't. I suggest keeping an eye on it because it might be done before the suggested time. Every oven is different.

I like the recipe but do not love it.  The vanilla did not mix in well so I’d add it with cream cheese next time.  The flour and sour cream did not mix well with the cream cheese no matter what I did.  As for leaving it in oven so no cracks develop, well I had more cracks in this recipe than any other NY style I’ve made.  The taste was different also.  That all being said I still liked it despite the issues.  Even though it tasted a bit different from other recipes I’ve used (this one seemed a bit sweeter) it was still good and texture was good.

This came together easily. I couldn't stir the cheese and had to use my stand mixer. I got some cracks but I think I put too much air in it so my bad! I don't like the texture of the zest bits. Eww, I keep having to spit them out and it ruins the smooth creamy texture of the cake. I'll make this without the zest next time. My only other complaint is that it's not sweet at all. It's a very bitter sour cake. Did I do something wrong? Overall I like the recipe and I will make it again but I might play around with the sugar amounts.

Had some issues.  Aside from using a while lot of dishes and utensils, it did not turn out that well. I followed the recipe with no changes.  I left mine in the oven with the heat turned off as directed and it still developed two sizable cracks.  They looked a lot like Chef John's cracked cake in the how-to video. Weird. But I could deal with that. The cheesecake was pretty heavy and perhaps a bit dry. The sunshiney flavor was too subtle. I have a better recipe than this one.

This is my go-to recipe for Cheesecake. Hands-down the best. The zest gives this a great contrast to the sweet. I cannot say enough great things about it and it has become the most requested desert in my office and at home.

I found this to be the closest recipe to the first and best ever New York Cheesecake that I've ever made and tasted. One addition to the crust was adding white sugar to it. The cheesecake came out wonderful and was so delicious. Suggestion to cooking it would be if you have an electric oven is to be sure to place the cheesecake on the bottom most rack or to barely crack the oven door open for the first 12 minutes or to bake it in a water bath which usually are for cheesecakes that have longer cooking times. This cheesecake was amazing. Thank you, Chef John!

Since I had a dark coated pan, I will cook it at 300 and not 350 the next time and I will add a pan of water in the oven to add moisture. I topped mine with strawberry glaze, strawberries and blueberries. It was awesome!

I don't think leaving it in the oven worked for me, it split worse than usual.  However the taste and consistency were perfect and once cut you couldn't tell it split anyway.

This is a great recipe. I love the citrus zest flavor in addition to vanilla.  It adds depth!  It uses sour cream instead of heavy cream, which keeps it more moist in my opinion.  If you don't have 3 or 4 hours to let the cheesecake cool as directed because you need your oven, bake in a water bath to further prevent cracks. Wrap the base of the pan in several tight layers of foil (to prevent water from getting inside the pan), place on metal baking pan, put hot water in the pan, and bake for an hour as directed. Then, turn oven off and let cool in the oven for only an hour.  Finish cooling the cake on the countertop until it is completely cool.  Place in the fridge for at least 4 hours prior to serving.

Literally the best cheesecake.  My husband actually made it and he followed the recipe exactly except for the crust.  Instead of thr graham cracker we made the crust from Golden Oreos.   The cheesecake baked perfectly and came out perfect (no cracks!).  We followed another tip that said to grease the sides and bottom of the pan to avoid cracking and that seemed to work.  Oh, and we did place a pie pan on the lower rack with water to help too.  Excellent recipe!!

I made this for my cheese cake monster, my son. It was the first one I ever made. Every recipe since he has not been thrilled with. Nor has he been thrilled with anyone else's cheese cake. This is now our forever cheese cake recipe. I have made a lot!!!! So that's something to be said for this recipe. Never again will I use another recipe. Thank You for sharing Chef John!!!!!!

Very dense cheesecake. The crust was tuff and eggyish.  It did not crack. Of course I had to add some chocolate to the top.

Instead of using 1 1/2 sugar, I used 1 1/3.  Tasted sweet, but not overbearingly so, plus you could taste the lemon and orange zest better.

I have always had trouble with cheesecake, but this one came out perfect.  Some changes....I used 1 1/4 c. graham cracker crumbs and 4 oz melted butter and I added 1 tsp cinnamon and about 1/8 c sugar to the crust.  I had trouble hand mixing the cream cheese so I used my stand mixer on low and only until it was blended.  Also, I don't like lemon/orange zest so I used about 1 tbls of Triple Sec for flavoring.  I think the key is not to over mix the batter.  I put a cake pan full of water under the pan and baked it at 350 for 70 min.  Turned the oven off and left it in for about 3 hours.  It was perfect.  No cracks and very smooth and flavorful.  Definitely will make this again.

Even though my cheesecake cracked, big time, I am giving this 5 stars because the flavor is amazing.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, cooked it for exactly one hour.  The sides were puffed up and the center was "giggly".  I turned the oven off, did NOT open the oven door and after 2 hours the big crack appeared......I could see through the window.  However, I left it in the oven for another hour.
This was my first attempt at making a New York Style Cheesecake, or any cheesecake for that matter.  
I will try again and see if I can make it without the crack!!

Thanks, Chef John wiiiiith providing this awesome cheese cake recipe! I usually prefer no-bake cheesecakes, but I quickly fell in love with this recipe. I substituted the graham cracker crust for gingersnap cookies and also substituted 1/3 cup of milk with 1/3 to 1/2 cup of irish cream liqueur. Topped it with a thin layer of semi-sweet chocolate ganache and a white chocolate decoration too. Turned out perfectly! The entire cake was gone in under 24 hours haha.

This is actually the second time that I made this cheesecake, my fiancee and nieces didn't let me finish putting the topping on it the last time so it didn't last 4 hours. This time was almost the same, except I got to it before they could start cutting and doling it out.

This was my first attempt at making cheesecake.  It cracked pretty good.  Had the exact same crack as the one in Johns video actually. But lawdy, did it ever taste good!  I topped it with cherry pie filling.  Took some to work, and even one guy who admittedly doesn't like cheesecake raved about it.  I was informed that is was "BOMB" in a good way.  Next one I make I'll top with a homemade raspberry sauce.

I plan on making many more of these. They're yumminess will overpower all, and the peasants will rejoice under the rule of their new cheesecake overlord!

I love chef John and I love his recipes, this one included. I made 4 cheesecakes altogether. Two using his method of keeping them in the oven after cooking, one using my never fail water bath, and the last using his method again. The water bath never fails!! His method gave me the nastiest cracks I've ever encountered, tasted great but looked terrible.. Water bath was great... Just bake for 25 minutes longer and let cool on a rack.

I am so exited with this recipe. My first cheesecake that didn't break. I didn't have the time to leave it in oven as its now midnite so I put aluminum foil around the pan and placed it inside a pan with water, I cooked it 350° for 1hour and 20mins let it cool down and placed in fridge till next day. Delicious recepi, couldn't wait to upload a picture the next day as it's for my sisters birthday and I will decorate it a little.. But I just had to upload right away to show everyone it did not break!!! Great recipe ThankYou!! ??

Very good. I added a little coco powder to chocolate graham crackers. In addition, I used almond extract instead of vanilla. The orange zest and almond really work well together.

This was amazingly good! I made it as directed and it turned out just like the pictures. We ate it after it cooled in the pan and never refrigerated it. It was the most awesome tasting cheesecake I've ever had, bar none. I used a can of raspberry pie filling on top.

I wonder if yogurt could be substituted for the sour cream successfully? I have been wanting to make a REAL New York Cheesecake from scratch for quite a while now, I guess it always intimidated me, now that I FINALLY purchased a springform pan, and found this easy recipe, I will certainly make it. My granddaughter, and I simply love cheesecake! I will be making it for her birthday as she prefers that instead of cake :)

This was my first attempt ever at making a cheesecake.  I am not a cheesecake person at all, but made it for someone's birthday.  Everyone raved about it so much that I tried some, and actually enjoyed it.  This will be going in the recipe book.  The only complaint was that the crust was a bit crumbly.  I will add a bit more butter to it next time I make this.

I'm giving it five star, was delicious and would make again - I did tweak the crust a bit by adding brown sugar and cinnamon, and also added a teasppon of lemon juice to the filling....I did try the trick to keep it from cracking and it's probably just my luck but it cracked anyway.  All in all i've made it twice and there is NEVER any left over awesome recipe for classic ny cheese cake.

I love this recipe! Definitely a keeper, I used way less of the citrus zest because I only had one lemon and one orange on hand, and I made a shortbread cookie crust due to having leftover Christmas cookies I wanted to use. I definitely recommend using a mixer though because doing it by hand was a real PITA, other than that it was super simple and super awesome. It still cracked but I don't care, it was perfect!

Tried this recipe over the weekend and the whole family loved it! Ours had a little crack too, but that didn't keep us from enjoying it! Will be making mini-versions of this for Christmas as gifts. Thanks to the app that adjusts the recipe's ingredients--very helpful! Thanks!

I tried this recipe today. Cheesecake still cracked, although I followed the directions. Recipe had no mention of "room temperature " ingredients. However, it would have been impossible to mix as directed if the ingredients weren't warmer. The graham crust was not good. No sugar in it! Makes a difference. Did not like that   Probably won't make this one again.

Great recipe, I've made it a few times, and it tastes great, the only problem I've had each time was a crack in the cake, I've followed the recipe, and let it cool in the oven, but still ended up with cracks.

I am making this cheesecake for the 4th time this morning for my 10 year old step-daughter's bday.  She has never liked cheesecake and raves about this!  This is my go-to recipe from now on!  I do also add a bit more butter to the crust to help it stick together but otherwise I follow the recipe and it  is soooooo yummy!

Wonderful cheesecake.  I needed to add a little more butter to the crust but it was so simple to make and the taste was awesome!

This cheesecake is really good! It is worth the waiting, as in it is best to wait and let it cool completely and then chill it in the refrigerator overnight before indulging. Instead of plain graham crackers I used chocolate, it was really good.

The light citrus flavor is the perfect addition to Chantal's cheesecake. Marvelous texture and taste.  I love Chef John--he wants you to succeed more than he wants to show off.  Watch his video, you won't go wrong.

Recipe easy to follow, and finally nice to taste ... Real hit!! This is the second time i do it and this last one i added a twist of coconut. The crust was made with galleta Maria golden, a mexican cookie similar to graham. I loved the video instruction. Definetely a great tool for new ones at kitchen!! My only critic is not to leave the cheesecake 45mins long inside the oven, it will crack also. Thanks Chef John!!

It's irresistible! I made a small version of this using half the ingredients. The grocery had no graham crackers so I used a local honey roasted box of crackers and I also added a little bit of sugar and cinnamon powder to the crumb mixture. This was my first homemade cheesecake and it came out great!

I had to use almost twice the butter to get the crust to stick, and I think I should have used a couple more Tbsp (so, about a stick), as it fell apart when I cut it. Flavor was very good; I didn't use the lemon/orange juice. Texture was great too. I followed the directions about leaving it in the oven, turned off, and it still split, but not as bad as Chef John's in his video. Overall, quite happy and this will be my go-to cheesecake recipe from now on. I look forward to trying it with the citrus juice next time.

SO GOOD AND EASY!  I have always been fearful of making cheesecake; sounds so complicated! Made this to  take to a party and WOW, it turned out beautifully and everyone RAVED about it. Not hard at all; just plan to make it early enough when you've time to let it sit in oven for 4 hours. Will definitely make again!
Served it with the Chef John's Strawberry Sauce. Pure YUM.

Wonderful recipe- I followed it exactly and it came out very tasty- better than most restaurants. I did end up with a large crack on the top- but it was still delicious! Whoever said this recipe was bad obviously did NOT follow the directions. About to make it again right now for a going away party at work. Keeping my fingers crossed that it does not crack.
