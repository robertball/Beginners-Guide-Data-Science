This was a great pie after some tweaking as follows: for the filling I used 1 1/4 cups of extra fine sugar, 3 1/2 tbsps of cornstarch 2 oz of lemon juice 1 1/2 teaspoons of lemon extract and 1 tsp of vanilla extract (I don't like the way rinds feel when eaten).After I added the sugar mixture into the yolks,I turned down the temp on the stove and cooked the filling for 14 mins it turned out nice and thick.As for the meringue I turned the mixer on high and beat the whites for about 2 mins than I added 1/2 tsp of cream of tarter and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract.Then I added the sugar (extra fine) and let the mixer do it's magic for about 14 mins. After baking I cooled the pie for and hour on the counter and put it in the frig. It turned perfect, the filling was just right and the meringue did not pull away from the pie and there was no liquid underneath the meringue.Happy baking.

Excellent recipe! Nice and lemony, not too sweet with good proportions of curd and meringue. My second attempt on lemon meringue pie.
I recommend stirring the curd very frequently to prevent burning. Remove the curd from heat only after it becomes really, really thick. Meringue to be added onto hot curd, such that the meringue bottom will cook. If the meringue bottom is not cooked the meringue will liquify and the pie will fail. Also let the pie sit for an hour at room temperature after baking, then 3 hours in the fridge to ensure everything has solidified, else upon cutting it the curd will ooze. Simple ingredients, but requires some understanding of how the meringue cooks ...

Update 12/03:  I still think this is a great recipe.  In perfecting my technique, I'd like to suggest mix in one bowl the water, lemon zest, and lemon juice; mix in another bowl the sugar, flour, cornstarch, and salt. 12/02: This is a successful recipe for a delicious pie.  I tried another recipe twice before for this kind of pie but the results were less than desirable.  This recipe came out just right.  The filling was firm, not runny!  I zested 1 lemon rather than 2, but used the juice of 2. I'd like to offer the following: The recipe doesn't tell you about cooling and refrigeration.  I let my pie cool 1 hr on a cookie rack, 3-6 hrs uncovered in the refrig before slicing, after 6 hrs in refrig, cover the pie (I used foil rather than plastic wrap.)  Thanks Emilie S for passing this along.  My hubbie and I are very grateful.  I'll be making 3 of these for Christmas dessert.

Finally I have found the perfect recipe for lemon meringue pie!  I made this tonight for my dad and it came out great.   The only thing that I wasn't clear on was the amount of lemon juice to use. 2 lemons can mean different things to different people.  I used 1/2 cup of lemon juice(about 3 lemons) and 1 tablespoon of zest.  It was the perfect balance of sweet and tart.  Also, it doesn't mention how to cool it.  I left it at room temperature for about an hour and then put it in the refrigerator for about 5 hours.  One tip I have is after the lemon filling starts to boil, only boil it for 1 minute so the cornstarch doesn't lose its thickening power.  Then, after you add the tempered eggs back into the hot mixture, boil one more minute and it will be a perfect thickness.  Also, when you fill the pie crust with the lemon filling, the crust should still be warm and when you top the pie with the meringue, the filling should still be pretty warm.  This will help seal the meringue after it cools so it doesn't separate from the crust.  I will definitely keep this recipe and I have a feeling I will be making this again very soon.

this pie was fantastic...after two tries of making it.  the first try, it didn't make nearly enough to fill the pie plate (a deep dish 9" plate).  also, it made kind of a gelatinous, almost clear jelly type substance.  the flavor was good, but not at all what i was expecting.  so, i dumped it and tried again the next day.  after reading ALL the reviews, i followed Angela's suggestions from page 10.  I changed the servings to 12, used milk instead of water (huge difference), used the zest from 3 lemons and the juice i got from them, which was 1/2 c., which was perfect, i also used about 1/2 tablespoon more cornstarch.  making those changes yielded a yellow custard that i am used to seeing in lemon pies.  after whisking the egg mixture back in, i lowered the heat to medium low and stirred until i felt it was thick enough.  (maybe 10-15 minutes of constant stirring).  after i spooned it into the pie shell and topped with meringue i let it cool to room temperature for over an hour then put it in the fridge for about 4 hours before i served it.  i used Pie Crust IV and Meringue II from this site.  it was, as my, self-proclaimed-lemon-meringue-pie- connoisseur father said:  "pretty  impressive".  (he had thirds)

I'm an experienced baker but never tried lemon meringue pie because it's not my favorite. The ones I've tried were either sour or gummy or both. A friend requested a lemon pie so I gave it a shot. This recipe turned out perfectly, even I was surprised how much I love the taste. Took the suggestions to use 1/4 c. lemon juice, and milk (2%) instead of water. The filling was beautifully creamy, not too sweet, not too tart. I piled the meringue high on a hot filling. Make sure to nudge the meringue all the way to the edge of the crust to seal the filling. Was very happy with the results. No shrinking meringue, no watery layer, no seepage of the filling after the pie was cut. Even after refrigeration there were just a few little beads of sugary moisture dotting the meringue, but the filling held up and didn't sog up the bottom crust. I used Martha Stewart's Pate Brisee recipe (all butter).

Everyone who is having problems with water in your pie **you cannot cover a lemon meringue pie with plastic wrap to store it, condensation forms and will leave you with a puddle in your pie** to store very loosely cover it with tented aluminum foil leaving a little opening for moisture to escape

If you are even thinking about making this pie, READ THIS REVIEW!!  This pie is fantastic!  Wonderful lemon flavor, as it's just the right balance of sweet and tart.  However, I did make a few minor adjustments.  First of all, while I'm sure experienced bakers picked up on this, this recipe does not specify that the crust must be pre-baked before adding the filling, otherwise you will end up with either a raw crust or a burnt meringue.  I pre-baked mine for 9 minutes.  2)DO NOT try to sub bottled lemon juice for the real thing.  It definitely changes the taste.  I used the juice of 3 lemons, which came to 1/2 cup, and the zest of 1.  3)I used milk instead of water and it gave the filling a delicious creamy texture.  4)I always double the recipe to get a nice, thick layer of lemon custard, if you make the recipe as shown, your custard layer will be only about half an inch thick.

This is a good, but fairly standard lemon meringue pie with a rich, tart filling, and fluffy meringue.  I prefer lemon meringue pie recipes like this one that call for water, rather than recipes using milk.  I used three small lemons, which yielded about 1/2  c. of lemon juice and 1 T. zest. I would have preferred a thicker pie, however, so were I to make this again I would increase the recipe overall by half. Tip: a weepy meringue is sometimes a problem, but can generally be avoided by not overcooking the meringue.

Well considering my Mum almost fell off her chair when she started on her 1st piece of pie (she ended up having 3 and she usually doesn't eat desserts) - I took it as good indication that I had found a SENSATIONAL American recipe for Lemon Meringue Pie.  It's more successful than the Australian one I've always used and my whole family raved and wanted more.  I will DEFINATLY make this one again.  Although I did use milk instead of water for a beautiful creamy consistency and I added 2 more egg whites for lots of meringue - yummy!!!!!

Wow!  I was surprised at how easy it is to make a lemon meringue pie!!  I worked up some serious arm cramp from beating the filling.  This was delicious and will certainly be making this again.  To stop the weeping of the meringue, make the meringue first, then make the filling and make sure the filling is piping hot when you put on the meringue.  also cook it maybe 12-15 instead of 10 minutes.

What a great recipe!  I've had many lemon fillings that never quite got the acid/sugar balance right, but this was bang on.  I used 2 pretty large lemons and was quite pleased with the resulting flavour.  Next time I'm going to mix up the citrus a little and add some lime and orange juice/zest. I've read some of the other reviews about the excess liquid they had to drain off once the pie cooled...a good trick is to add a tsp or so of cream of tartar to the egg whites.

For the past couple of months I've been trying to make the perfect lemon meringue pie. I've tried a different recipe a couple times that just turned out soupy. Then AR came to the rescue and gave me this recipe. I followed the advice of others and used milk instead of water. The first three trys with that came out more like a pudding pie than a custard. The fourth pie I decided to use the water instead and it came out perfect!! I'm just going to go with the original recipe from now on. I do add another T of cornstarch, use 1 T lemon zest, and 1/2 c lemon juice. Make sure the first time it boils you let it boil for at least 1 or 2 minutes. The second time you bring it to a boil you'll know its thick enough when it starts to pull away from the sides of the pan. Make sure your pie filling is still hot when you top it with the meringue. Cool to room temp at least 1 hr, then refrigerate at least 3 hrs. I hope this helps anyone who had as much trouble as I did making the perfect lemon meringue pie. :)

I’ve made this pie at least 5x already - love this very easy recipe! I followed the ingredients list exactly (making sure to have 1/2cup of lemon juice). {LEMON CURD} I usually read the reviews before making a recipe and was confused by how long to boil the lemon curd for; one review said to boil it for 14min and another said boil for 1min after adding the eggs. After researching, I realized that the first reviewer had over-boiled their cornstarch. Cornstarch is a wonderful thickener which becomes active only when the mixture has begun to boil (95°C/203°F). When you boil the mixture though (ie longer than a minute) the cornstarch loses its thickening ability. The first reviewer ended up making a curd by evaporating the extra liquid instead of by the power of the cornstarch. I followed the second reviewer to much success :) Stir constantly so you don’t burn the curd! {MERINGUE} Careful of the weather. If it’s rainy or humid, the meringue won’t be as fluffy no matter how much you beat it; it’s best to make it on drier days. But if you’re like me and get cravings, tartar powder helps stabilize the meringue. Also, make the meringue first then the curd. Pour the hot curd into the pie crust then immediately top it with the meringue to cook the bottom of the meringue. Make sure to seal the edges fully or the meringue will weep (have little beads of water when cooled). This is a recipe that keeps me super busy til I’m waiting 6hrs for it to cool, but it’s well worth the work & wait!

After reading the reviews, here is are the cliff notes.
1.  Let the eggs sit out for a little bit.  Easier to make the meringue when the eggs aren't cold
2.  Most important here: make the meringue first and/set aside.  To get the meringue to set on the filling you should fold the meringue onto the hot filing right away.  That way it doesn't get soggy or runny.
3.  Use 2% milk instead of water
4.  Use the juice from 3 large lemons (1/2) cup and the rind from only     one
5.  Use (6) egg whites for a fuller meringue on top of the filling. 

I didn't do anything new here.  just read everyone's helpful reviews.  I just made it for Christmas dessert and my Dad and BIL said it was a perfect blend and not too tart.  My Dad said it was the best he ever had and he is very picky palate.

This is the a great recipe. It turns out perfect every time I make it. My husband is a big lemon pie fan. Although he prefers the icebox(he from the south)version, he loves this pie and never tires of it. I buy premade pie crust from the dairy section and never seem to have time to squeeze lemons, but a 1/2 cup of plain ole lemon juice does the trick. Reminds me of my mothers pie. And so easy. THANKS!

Absolutely Fabulous.I made this for my anniversary and it was my first attempt at making such a decadent desert. Other reviewers complained about several aspects of this recipe.My fix, increase servings to 12 and use a 9"deep-dish pie crust(you will have more pie filling).Use milk instead of water(if you can).Zest 3 lemons and use 1/2 c. lemon juice(will not be too tart).Prepare all of your ingredients first,as you need to work fast.Lower the temp.when cooking the filling (mine wanted to burn).It took me forever to make the meringue so start in advance(my recommendation would be to use your kitchenaid mixer to save you time) Good luck and enjoy.

Finally, a great lemon meringue pie recipe!  I made three of these at Easter and received RAVE reviews on all of them!  This was an incredibly easy recipe and, as an experienced baker, I was wowed!

I would make a few suggestions:

Increase fresh lemon juice to 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 teaspoons (you can use the bottled lemon juice if you don't feel like squeezing another lemon).  I prefer a bit more tart pie filling than the recipe suggests, but this is subject to personal preference.
  
Ensure you "dock" your pie crust prior to baking, which will ensure your crust does not puff up during baking (max 15 minutes at 350 degrees).   Once cooled, you can add your filling and spread on the meringue.

A note about the meringue:  this is is the EASIEST meringue you will ever make, even on the worst weather days (rain, humidity)!   Ensure you make it FIRST before preparing your filling, because you will need to place it on the hot filling!     Spread your meringue all the way to the edges--I mean cover the crust--otherwise, you will get seeping filling.   Absolutely DO NOT LET YOUR PIE FILLING COOL before you put the meringue on...the baking time is just 10 minutes in the oven, and you want the meringue to "seal" with the hot filling!

I made the mistake of following carthecook's recipe instead of the one on this page. I really hate people that do that! The filling was so rubbery that I could have used it for a bouncy ball!. She said to beat the egg whites for 14 minutes! After less than 5 minutes I had the dryiest meringue I've ever made. I actually had the "meringue from hell!" I have a Kitchen-Aid mixer and the meringue was all over my kitchen. It was even up inside the workings of my mixer. It seemed to follow me around all day. It was horrible. On my walls, on my floor even managed to get on things in my fridge after I put the pie in to cool. I have a tried-and-true recipe that I will be using from now on. I'm warning everyone--DO NOT EVER BEAT MERINGUE FOR 14 MINUTES--unless you want to completely clean your kitchen. Lemon meringue is NEVER supposed to be made with milk. It is not a custard pie.

I have never made Lemon Meringue Pie before and this turned out SO good and SO easy! I used my deep dish pie pan and Pillsbury pie crust! When I was cooking I wasn't sure when the lemon filling was "thick enough" once it started boiling the thickness didn't seem to change so after a few minutes I went ahead and poured it in the baked pie crust. I have made lots of meringues in the past and this meringue was very sweet which is what I prefer so if you like your meringue less sweet I'd use less sugar. I also used a bit of cream of tarter for the meringue. I was disappointed at first because I didn't think it had set and thought I would have to throw it out but once it cooled completely the whole way through the Lemon gel was a perfect consistency! This is my husbands favorite kind of pie and he LOVED it! He said it was the best lemon meringue he has ever had. I don't know how well known Tippin's is but they have the best pies EVER and I can honestly say this lemon meringue beats Tippins Lemon Meringue HANDS DOWN! My husband agreed! I plan on making this again for sure!!!

I use my microwave in any instance where you might use a doubleboiler or have to stir on the stove.  So simple.

Mix first 6 ingredients in 4 cup microwave bowl - cook on high until boils, add butter, and after mix hot mixture with egg yolks, return to microwave and bring to a boil again. 

No stirring constantly and no mess.
The microwave is great for this type of cooking.

OK, this was the second time I made this pie but still no luck. I purposely put in a bit less water to make the lemon custard stiffer, and beat the egg whites long enough to let peaks formed. I even took Kristi's advice to warm the crust and add the meringue to a warm filling. However, when I cut the pie, the crust was soggy and there's water underneath it. The lemon custard tasted weird so in the end I have to toss the whole pie out (and so was the first time). I'm not a bad cook but for some reason, I cannot figure this out!

I made this for my dad for Father's Day as Lemon Meringue is his favorite pie. It was my first meringue, so I had some issues and ended up tossing the first pie I made in the garbage. Even though I knew better, I ended up making the filling first and then the meringue: Big mistake! Make the meringue first, set it aside, and then make the filling. While the filling is still screaming hot, pour it in your pie crust and then quickly spread the meringue on top of it and pop it in the oven. If you don't do this you'll end up with a nasty layer of liquid between your filling and meringue that will ruin the pie when you cut into it! The second pie I ended up making was amazing! The filling is perfect as is, except I used milk instead of water for a more custard-like consistency like others have suggested. Overall, a very great recipe and I will be using it again!

This recipe is excellent, as-is. But I have made this many times now, and recommend replacing the water with milk for a more creamy, richer filling flavor. Just be sure to keep at or just under boiling for a good 15 minutes to set the filling. I have also experimented with more lemon zest and juice with good results.  The other thing I recomend is to leave the meringue as is for this pie. The light, fluffy, air-filled meringue made with just egg whites and sugar adds the complimentary texture that you lose using one of the tartar or starch based meringues. Texture is very important with this pie.

Very good.  The lemon curd was very smooth and sweet & sour in the right proportions.  I read some of the other reviews about the filling not congealing and got a little worried.  So, I watched the all recipe lemon meringue video.  Wonderful tips.  If you overboil the filling, the starch will break down and the whole thing gets soupy.  I took mine off the heat as soon as the first bubbles started.  As for the meringue, the tip was that the beading on top is a result of the egg whites having too much sugar added.  This one is tough as not all eggs are the same size.  My large eggs seemed small so I reduced the sugar by 1 TB.  Everything turned out perfect.  I will change only one thing in the future.  I will up the scaling to 10 servings.  I like my pies a little fuller and taller than this recipe makes.  Either that, or I will use an 8" pie pan instead of 9".

UPDATE: i am not trying to be smart here, however, i am hoping that people know the difference between the zest and the rind / peel!  i have read a lot of reviews on this recipe where people are saying the filling was bitter due to the called for zest or that there was TOO much zest!  the zest is very outer, thin layer of the peel (mins the pith - the white bitter stuff).  if you're lucky or have a very large lemon, you get a tiny amount of usuable zest.  i read one review where someone said they had a cup of zest!! which she in turn added to her filling!!  this is clearly the rind and or peel, not the zest.    REVIEW:  very well done.  it's tart, yet sweet!  it's perfect.  from reading reviews on here, definitely wait until the mixture boils...it will thicken up.  also chilling in the fridge helps with firming up the filling.  i used meringue II for the meringue part - wonderful recipe.

When I made this recipe for the first time it was a very runny lemon filling which made it difficult to cut and hard to eat so I always put equal portions of flour and cornstarch to make the filling easier to set and slice when it is cooled. I have also had rave reviews from my friends who have enjoued the pie immensely when I have shared it with them. This is now one of my favorite pies to make.

I have made lemon meringue a lot and this is the easiest and most delicious recipe I've found.  I love this with a graham cracker crust, which is very easy to make.  

A few tips I've learned over the years:
1. Be sure to mix the cornstarch with the other dry ingredients thoroughly before heating and adding water or it will clump.
2. Don't make the meringue peaks too high on the pie or they will scorch before the rest is cooked enough.
3. Use meyer lemons if they are available.  Always use fresh lemons since this is a LEMON pie.  Concentrate just won't cut it.

This was a good pie, not the greatest lemon meringue pie I've ever tasted, but no complaints. I used the zest of just one lemon since I don't like much zest in baked good, and I added vanilla to the meringue. I used the recipe for Grandma's Secret Pie Crust (halved) from this site, I use it for most pies I make and would highly recommend it. I took the suggestion of another reviewer to bake the pie for 12-15 minutes instead of 10 and I think the meringue overbaked a little, so I would suggest you start with 10 minutes and then check it. If you're new to meringue like me I also suggest you check out AllRecipe's video on making a perfect lemon meringue pie. I made the mistake of watching it after I'd made the pie and it would have been helpful as I wasn't sure exactly when the meringue was done whipping and I think I overdid it.

I made two of these pies for Christmas.  The filling firmed up upon being refridgerated, the meringue was easy and delicious.  I did not tweak the recipe at all.  The origional recipie made a wonderful pie.  The instructions are a bit hazy as to let the filling cool or place the meringue on the hot filling. Some clarification in that area would send this recipe to more than 5 stars

This is great.  Make sure to add the filling to a warm crust and add the meringue to a warm filling.  Then there  will be no separation.  Do not bake it too long or "beads" will form on the meringue.  My husband's favorite.

This recipe turned out well after a little adjusting. I've baked many things, but this was my first attempt at lemon meringue pie, and I must say it came out great. A few things I adjusted: I used 2% milk instead of water for a creamier result. I used the juice from two lemons straight out of my backyard. (Measured approx 1 cup. I am very pleased with the taste, but they were very tart). I'm not fond of the texture of the rinds, so I added a capful of vanilla extract to help balance the bitterness of the lemons. To get a thicker texture I started to slow my stirring after adding the egg yolk mixture, and it helped quite a bit. I also added 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract to firm/flavor the meringue mixture. I followed CARTHECOOK's (9/23/05 review) method for cooling, and the pie turned out very well.   *One side note- I beat everything by hand with a whisk, and some of these directions are written for an electric mixer. I would recommend doing the egg white mixture first when using a whisk, as you will need the lemon mixture to be hot enough to seal the meringue to the crust. Otherwise the meringue can come out runny underneath. I also will probably adjust the recipe to add more servings next time. My lemon filling came about 1/2 way up the crust when using a 9" deep dish pie crust, and the meringue sat about a 1/2 inch at its tallest in the center of the pie.

WOW.  I never knew making lemon meringue from scratch was so easy!  Really delicious, I will never go back to pudding mix again.  TIP: To keep meringue from falling off or weeping, be sure to do two things.  1. Put the meringue on the HOT pudding filling right before putting it in the oven.  This helps cook the meringue from below as well as on top.  2. Spread that meringue alllll the way over to the crust and over it, creating a seal over every bit of lemon pudding.  If you just do those simple things, your crust will not get soggy, and the pie will stay great for a couple of days in the fridge!

I have never made a lemon pie before and this turned into a disaster.  I can't blame the recipe, since obviously it is good.  I was told I cooked it too long.  How do you know when it is done?  I waited until it was pudding thick.  Is that too thick?

This was my first "from scratch" lemon pie, and I can't believe how easy it was!  My 9-year-old niece and I made this for my father.  It turned out great.  We added 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar to the meringue, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Dad couldn't wait for it to cool, but thought it was great, even warm.  I'll make this again.  Maybe even tomorrow!  My kids will be thrilled to have one of their own.

Escellent pie.  Everyone loved it.  I added 1/2tsp vanilla and 1/2tsp cream of tartar to the meringue.  I have never made a meringue pie and both times I have made it's come out perfect.  I found 2 lemons = 1/2cup to 2/3cup of lemon juice.

This pie is really good. I only had one lemon, so I used bottled lemon juice also. A total of 1/2 cup of juice and the zest of the one lemon. The filling was just right. Not too sweet and not too tart. After adding egg yolks, cook filling about one more minute. The filling will then be the correct texture. When whipping the egg whites, add the sugar slowly, one tablespoon at a time. Whip about 30 seconds between adding tablespoons of sugar. This is just like Grandma used to make. Those that give this recipe 1 star should stick with frozen supermarket pies.

Ok, let me start by saying, I am a terrible baker. I have never made meringue. So, anyone who gave this a bad review was total user error. This pie is fantastic and way easy!! I made it for my in laws who love this pie! Everyone gave it beyond 5 stars.
So, to avoid a yucky pie, don't use the entire peel, just the yellow rind part. Having a great zester helps. Good quality fresh ingredients helps, and following directions helps. (like who would really use bottled lemon juice?)
Thanks to grandma, I have confidence to try more pies!

There was a lemon meringue pie recipe in my family that we always made.  With all due respect to my mother and uncle, this is the absolute best I have ever had or made.  I always use fresh lemons and with the zest, the flavor is out of this world.  The meringue is the highest, stays the highest and is just sweet enough.  I cannot thank Emilie enough for taking the time to share this recipe.  I have made it now four times, it always comes out perfect.  I am going to make it again now.  Make sure you put the lemon filing in a cooled crust.  Make sure the meringue goes on quickly onto the hot filling and into the oven.  Watch it in the oven of course, refrigerate for at least 8 hours before cutting.  A perfect recipe. Wouldn't change a thing.

I doubled the recipe and added an extra lemon for each pie and it tasted great! Only problem was, that it came out too runny - I think I was stirring it for too long. I didn't have any problem with the egg whites 'weeping' (no water under the pie even after refrigeration). I guess coz I did 2 things: first, after beating the egg whites [only] till foamy, i sifted confectioners sugar on it and let it sit for 5 minutes, then beating again for another 1 to 2 minutes. second, I put the egg whites on the pie while the filling was still hot. Try that. Might work. :)

Great recipe!  I follow the instructions exactly and it comes out perfect each time.  Be sure to use juice from an actual lemon, and be sure to use the zest.  To those having problems, remember to bake your shell first, let it cool.  Add your lemon curd and put the meringue on while it is still hot.  Also, be sure the meringues covers the pie right to the crust so that the pie is sort of sealed by the meringue.  And finally.... Do not refrigerate at all until the pie has cooled completely.  A lot of time these things are forgotten, and it leads to watery pie or soggy crust.

This tasted fine but not the best version I've tried. My 2 lemons yeilded 1/2 cup & we thought it could've used a bit more lemon flavor. Also, this produced such a thin layer of filling, the recipe needs to be doubled or at least 1-1/2. (I did not use the meringue from this recipe, but probably should have!).

I am so happy to find this recipe.  It sounds just like the one my grandmother and my aunt made but they did not have a recipe, per se.  It was so good and sometimes my aunt would add a layer of bananas between the crust and filling.  I know this may not sound good but it was delicious.  Can't wait to try it.

Really good and easy to make.  I like the fact that it calls for using the zest in the pie, which the recipe I've been making for years does not.

The pie came out picture perfect.I increased the cornstarch to 4 spoons.The best thing is to boil it a little more, it will get rid of the eggy taste and it will be stiff enough in no time (the density of the filling was perfect).
The meringue came out perfect with 1 more egg white, mixer whipping, a little salt and a drop of vinegar.
My problem came from the unbelievable lemon flavor.So if you are not a fan of the strong lemon taste,I advice preparing the zest and juice (mine was from 3 small lemons) and adding it little at a time and tasting the curd afterwards.
I also replaced water with milk.The milk thickens in contact with lemon juice so we already have an extra on density.I kept the pie crust warm,added the curd and immediately added the whites and popped it in the oven.I lowered the temps a bit till the meringue raised then raised it till golden brown.

THIS PIE WAS VERY TASTY. I AGREE WITH OTHER REVIEWERS THAT IT WAS A BIT WATERY AND THE MERINGUE SLIPPED OFF OF THE PIE. BESIDES THAT THE FLAVOR WAS WONDERFUL!

I made this for my Easter guests, and even though my meringue was weepy, they raved!  My first ever pie of this type, the filling rating alone would be 5 stars, but the meringue was lacking.  I don't own a zester, so I used a grater to zest the lemon, then strained the filling before topping with the meringue. It was bright yellow and the perfect tart/sweet combination! I made the meringue first and added 1/2 tsp of cream of tartur, and 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  I also upped the sugar to 8 Tbsp, as Emeril suggests 2 Tbsp per egg white.  I put the meringue on the pie while the filling was piping hot, and baked it for 5 min. at 450 degrees.  It came out of the oven looking amazing, but after refrigerating it had shrunk and was weeping.  Upon doing a bit of research, I have read that this type of pie doesn't need refrigeration, just cover under an inverted bowl.  This may help with weeping and shrinkage.  I think next time I may try a cornstartch mixture as well.

This is a great recipe.  My meringue was watery, so the next time I made it, I pulled a "No Fail Meringue" recipe from All Recipes, which added cornstarch to it, and the meringue turned out just fine.  I pulled a pie crust recipe for the pie crust from All Recipes and it turn out fine.  I have made it now 3 times, and it's so good, and reminds me of the old days when the lunch counters served lemon meringue pie.  And reminds me of my mom who used to work at those lunch counters.  Thank you!!

the first time i made this was a learning experience. the merengue weeped, resulting in that watery layer, it shrunk, even though I was careful to seal the edges, and it was so tart that it tasted metallic. i tried it again, but added an extra quarter cup of sugar, and instead of water i used a cup of evaporated milk and a half cup of skim milk. i also added a teaspoon of white vinegar to the egg whites. i brought the filling to a hard boil and added the merengue immediately upon pouring the very hot filling into the shell. I let it cool to room temperature and then refrigerated it for 24 hours before cutting into it. The second time the texture was perfect, it didn't shrink, and the metallic taste was gone. the recipe does not spell out some of the technique involved, but it's a good recipe with some tweaking.

This recipe was absolutely brilliant!! I decreased the water to 1 1/4 cups, as I prefer a thicker filling, and added a bit of yellow food colouring to give it more of a lemon colour. I also strained the cooked filling before adding it to the pie crust because some of the egg whites must have snuck past me and into the yolks, and there were a few white threads in the pot. This also ensured a smoother mixture, as it got rid of the zest. Very nice flavour, perfect balance of sweet and sour.

Excellent! Simple, fast, and inexpensive to boot! I used 3 smaller lemons (the size that's usually in a bag) and left out the zest. Tart, but not too tart. I beat the meringue on 10 on my KitchenAid, next time I looked, it was perfect! Served this with chicken salad on refrigerator croissants--the croissants and pie went in at the same temp. Had just enough time to pull out the pie, get plates ready, and the croissants were done. Pie filling was a little runny warm, but perfect once chilled! Thanks! (Also, heating lemons for 30 seconds in microwave produces more juice.) Update: January 31, 2006--if you do not have a Microplane zester, BUY ONE! Works incredibly well and doubles as a dead skin on feet scraper. Look for reviews. :) My really big dog loves to lick little bits of this off my fingers! His fave, my fave. :)

I have made this pie so many times and it comes out perfectly every time.  This recipe is SO EASY compared to others in this site.  No double boiler, no stirring for 20 minutes.  This sets up nice and fast, and tastes wonderful. Light, not too sweet.  With the Meyer lemons in my back yard, I needed something to use them up.  This is certainly the most delicious way!  I do make the meringue before I start the filling.  If I get it on while the filling nice and hot, the top never separates.  What a wonderful recipe, thnks so much for sharing.

My husband loves lemon pie but it normally gives him heartburn, this recipe doesn't. 
I followed several suggestions below:

1. change servings to 12
2. use MILK!!!! not water
3. for 12 servings use 3 1/2 tablespoons of flour
4. use 1/2 cup of lemon juice.

I've been making lemon meringue pie for years using the recipe from the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook. I decided to give a new recipe a try. This recipe is not much different from that one, and I would say that it is no better or worse. Great lemon flavor. I had two rather large lemons and used the juice and zest from both. If you use a microplane zester, you shouldn't even notice any texture from the rind, just lots of tart lemon flavor. I used a graham cracker crust, which has always been a favorite in my family. I ended up baking the meringue for about 13 minutes, it came out beautiful, nice and glossy.

Great flavor!  This was my first experience with meringue and I didn't know that the trick is to spread the meringue over the crust and to the pan.  My meringue shrank and didn't look very pretty, but it tasted great!

I followed Mamzilla's suggestions and made a spectacular pie.  One tip -- whip the egg whites when they are at room temperature until foamy.  Then, slowly add in the sugar, cream of tartar, and vanilla.

I wish I could say that this recipe looked and tasted fantastic, but I can't speak well of the latter. The former, however... - this pie was beautiful! The custard turned out the perfect consistency and was a lovely shade of yellow, with a gorgeous meringue. The *taste* however was tart to the point of making my husband and I frown on the first bite. And then the aftertaste from the 2 whole lemons worth of rind? Terrible. I am going to give this one another try, this time minus the rind, or perhaps with about a tablespoon or two's worth of rind. 2 lemons worth of rind makes almost a cup's worth and it's waaaaay too much. Beautiful looking pie, but BEWARE THE RIND!! (Also, here's a tip for those new to making meringue - CORNSTARCH, just a little, will almost eliminate weeping and make your meringue picture perfect: Per 4 egg whites, stir 1 tablespoon cornstarch into 1/3 cup cold water, heat while stirring until the starch thickens. Set aside to cool. After the sugar has been beaten into the meringue and it forms soft peaks, add cornstarch mixture 1 TBSP at a time, beating to stiff peaks.

We absolutely loved this pie! My bf usually does not like the meringue part of pies and this time, he did! The pie was really lemon-y yet sweet, so it went hand in hand pretty good together! The pie was perfect, just make sure you really cut or grind up the lemon rinds. Also, when placing the meringue on the top of the pie, make sure it touches the end of the crust in order to prevent shrinkage of the topping. Also, I would recommend letting it cool off instead of putting it rapidly into the freezer as I did. The meringue seemed to go down just a tad. This will be the recipe I use for future lemon meringue pies. Thanks!!! =)

Wonderful! Made for family gathering by request. Increased lemon and zest to 1/2 cup, and used milk instead of water; added cream of tarter to topping which made the pie picture perfect. Just breath taking and everyone was impressed. Plan to make it at our next function.

This recipe is great. The lemon curd is delicious. The only thing I do differently is make more merengue. Merengue deflates a bit after baking so if you increase the merengue by 2 egg whites and 2 more tablespoons of sugar you will have a perfect amount for 1 pie. I also add 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar to the egg whites before whipping them (they whip up more easily with this) and I add a half teaspoon of vanilla to make the merengue extra flavorful. Hope you enjoy these tips! Yum on.

I'm a "family" cook (for 40 some years) and nothing gourmet so that's my level of experience and I had never baked a meringue pie.  My husband loves lemon pie so I decided to tackle this for Valentine's Day.  Wow!  It was a huge success.  I did watch the video and followed the directions exactly including "tempering" the egg yolk by adding a bit of the hot filling before putting the yolks into the hot pan.  My meringue was perfect; I'm just so proud of myself.  Thanks, Emily for posting.

This was awesome. Half way through making the custurd I asked my mom to taste it and she didn't want to wait till it was finished. One thing I did change was to let the egg whites sit to get a little warm. And if you like to have a tall meringue you should add a couple more egg whites. But other than that, this was amazing.

Considering I've never made a lemon meringue pie.  This was exceptionally well.  The results were professional and my father was very happy with his birthday pie. :)

I had to make this recipe a few times to get the perfect result, but I finally have it.  Unfortunately as printed it misses out how important it is to cover the topping with meringue immediately after pouring the topping into the pie crust and to spread it to the edges so that it sticks to the pie crust.  The flavour is excellent though, but as with any recipe that calls for the juice of a lemon rather than a specific quantity, taste your filling to make sure it is to your taste.

This was the best Lemon Meringue Pie I have made yet. I followed the instructions exactly and doubled it for 2 pies. It was a perfect balance of sweet and tart, and firmed up beautifully. I tried it that evening while it was still room temperature and in the morning after chilling in the fridge. I MUCH preferred it after it was chilled/slightly more firm, and it was still good 2 days later! Thanks for a great recipe! NOTE: I brushed the unbaked pie shells with some of the egg white before I baked them. This protected the crust from getting soggy from the warm lemon filling.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars. I always make deep dish pies. But never made a meringue pie before. Usually just use a whipped cream top. I asked the members on the Recipe Exchange a couple... ok, OK!... ALOT of questions... and as usual they came through. If making a deep dish pie make for 12 servings. I added a teaspoon of lemon juice to whites prior to whipping till frothy, like beer suds. A bit of vanilla after the POWDERED sugar was added. The powdered sugar contains both sugar and cornstarch. I made my meringue first and set it aside. Then I cooked the custard. Used milk instead of water. Grandma always did. I forgot to add the butter, but I tasted the spoon, and it was lemony creamy and pudding thick without it. I used a hand mixer for the whites, worked great! Remember to let the whites be a room temperature BEFORE whipping. Added vanilla and a pinch of salt to the finished whites. Add this to HOT custard. Seal all the way to the OUTER edge. I did it, now YOU can! Also baked meringue at 325F for about 15 minutes.

My mother was an excellent baker along with my Aunt who had a catering business and a bake shop so I have many homemade recipes and lots of experience as well but i still like to try other recipes. I came across this recipe and thought I'd try it. I have Ponderosa lemons in my yard so the fresh lemon juice made the filling extra good. However, when i got to the meringue, I knew something wasn't right, then i realized an ingredient or 2 was left out which makes an excellent, beatiful meringue. To make a good merinue, one that looks whippy with peaks that stand high you need cream of tartar and a hint of vanilla flavoring. To just use sugar you will only get whipped sugar that eventually breaks down and you will not have the foamy peaks that make your pie look wonderful.Friends didn't want to eat it because it was "too pretty to eat" and to me, a lot is all about presentation. Otherwise, the filling recipe was good.

Easy and delicious! I am not a professional baker and yet this was not only easy to make, but its tasty as well. I read some of the reviews and used milk instead of water and added a 1/2 tablespoon more of cornstarch.

This pie is amazing...I followed the recipealmost exactly. The only changes I made was to use to lemon and rind of 4 lemons, and to add couple of drops of vanilla essense to the meringue. The sugar is perfect for our taste. For the user whose meringue was flat, maybe that could be because you over-beat the egg whites. Over-beating can make the egg whites flat. As soon as it is stiff, stop whisking the egg whites. Add the vanilla and the sugar and whisk it only for a minute or two. Then the egg whites will be stiff and hold its shape. For meringue pie recipes, I don't find it necessary to add cream of tarter if I am adding sugar. Back to this recipe.. a fantastic lemon meringue pie!!

This one works really well. Remember to "seal the crust" as the recipe suggest, it helps keep the meringue in place after its cooked. I added the meringue on top of a hot lemon filling, I think it helps seal up the bottom of the merigue nicely. I cooked it at 325 F for 20 minutes to get a nice golden meringue with browned peaks. PLEASE- remember to keep the pie out of the fridge to prevent weeping and condensation droplets on the meringue.

I made this pie twice. The first time I made it exact, except I used 1/2 cup lemon juice. The lemons I had were fresh picked and were as large as oranges. One lemon produced 1 cup of juice. Imagine what yield I'd get using two. I think 2 lemons is too vague in a recipe like this. The pie was delicious. The next time I used 3/4 cup of fresh squeezed juice and reduced the water to 1-1/4 cup. Also reduced the sugar by 2 TBLS, as I like my pie on the tart side.

This recipe was excellent, my only comment is that luckily I have made meringue before or the omission of cream of tartar would have really had me working to whip it up.Cooks, you really should add at least 1 tsp of cream of tartar per egg to get a really stiff and fluffy meringue. Also  be patient it takes a bit of whipping to get it going!! Other than that this recipe is awesome! Thanks.

I had the same problem as most others where after baking the pie and letting it cool to room temperature there was a lot of liquid between the meringue and filling. It turned the crust soggy and the pie didn't hold up enough to serve nicely.. HOWEVER. The pie itself tasted fantastic!!!!!!!! I had no problem serving it to others looking like it did when it tasted soooooo good. I used the juice and zest of 1 large lemon(a little over 1/2 cup juice). The filling was thick enough just that liquid made it hard to serve. Anyone fiquire out why the liguid????

I used 1/4 cup lemon juice and the zest of 1 large lemon as others suggested.  It thickened beautifully and cut well.  I like an easy clean-up, so I cooked all the ingredients (except meringue, of course) at one time in one large frying pan and stirred it constantly with a wisk.  No lumps and consistently was very smooth.  I use this method for all my cream pies and I never have problems.  My granny taught me how to do it!  I never use the double boiler or the add the hot mixture to the cold egg yolks and then return all to the pan method.  I can't understand how others complained of the runny filling.  The recipe was easy and delicious.  I made my own pie crust and I used the egg pastry recipe as it is almost a no-fail one.  It is especially good for beginners to use.

I have used 1 tsp. of gelatin in the filling in order for it to keep its shape, otherwise it separates.  Also to keep the meringue from weeping, keep the door of the oven ajar (about an inch or two open)it will guarentee a non-weeping pie!  Good luck

I recommend making your pie dough in advance - ready in the fridge to make this an easier task.  I found it too bitter because of the rind.  Recipe should be more specific on actual quantity, rather than a number of lemons since they vary in size.  I reduced amount the second time around and it was perfect!

WONDERFUL! I couldn't locate my mom's old standby to use to make for my son's graduation BBQ.  I prefer pies that use corn starch as the thickening agent.  This pie uses both, but found it to set up perfectly, it did not have the pasty flour taste I don't like when using flour only.  I wondered if 2 lemons would be enough...this was perfectly tart/sweet and did remind me of my mom's.  AND, I actually made meringue for the first time in years!  It turned out lovely!  I will most certainly make this again!  THANK YOU FOR SHARING!

Followed the recipe exactly, but noticed that I needed way more time on the baking.  10 minutes is simply not enough time.  Baked for an additional 30 minutes and even then, it was still soupy.  Makes me wonder if I didn't cook/beat the layers for a long enough time?  Very good, but will need to try again to perfect the art of meringue pie.

I followed the recipe for the filling exactly.  I did like it a lot, but might add another 2 T of sugar next time.  When I made my meringue I beat it with 1/4 t cream of tartar and added 1/2 t vanilla at the very end.  So yummy!  I also had to bake mine for 15 min.

I made this recipe exactly as called for and it turned out excellent.  This is the first time I made a lemon meringue pie from scratch and it tastes so much better.  The bottom of the crust ended up being a little wet and mushy so next time I will let it cool longer on the counter before putting it in the fridge.

I had no idea how easy it was to make a homemade lemon meringue pie or i would have done it much sooner.  It got rave reviews and my husband asked for a chocolate custard pie with this meringue on top.

I made the recipe without alterations and it turned out wonderfully.  This was the first time I attempted lemon meringue, and I got lots of compliments on the pie.  One issue I need to address is how to get the meringue to cling to the lemon layer better (they slid apart when cutting out slices of pie).

The filling for this recipe is simply amazing.  It has a great flavor and set up well.  The lemon zest just added to the homemade-ness (new word!) of the pie.  I even had little bits of lemon pulp.

I am not giving this 5 stars because the meringue is not as straight forward as this recipe.  I recommend reading up on meringue before attempting to make your own.  My first try cried rivers of tears.  (Too wet!)  My second was thin and tough (too dry).  So...I'm going to have to practice until I get the correct process for my oven ...and humidity.  As far as I can tell, I recommend 1/2 tsp cream of tartar and vanilla extract added to the egg whites.  I do NOT recommend adding lemon extract to the meringue.  It leaves a bitter aftertaste.

I used a graham cracker crust and it was great :)

This was the first time I made lemor merigue pie by myself. I think I got my egg whites too stiff, but that was my own fault and it still tasted great!

Very Good, I followed the recipe as is, it was a little too sweet, so next time I'll add 1/4 cup less white sugar and see how that goes.

This is the best lemon meringue pie I've ever tasted! I made this twice.  The first time I made it after reading a bunch of reviews and used some suggestions. Forget it...DON'T do that. Make this just as it is written and it is wonderful!!!! Just remember that you need to add the  meringue as soon as you have filled the pie shell with the filling. It has to be piping hot so that when it cools and chills the meringue and filling do not separate and leak. Just a perfect pie that I will make again and again!!!

This was a delicious pie! There was a perfect amount of sugar to tartness in the lemon filling. I used a homemade honey graham cracker crust to go with this, since honey goes very well with citrus. I'm not very big on meringues, so I downed the egg whites to lnly 3 with 4 1/2 tbs of sugar, 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar, and a 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract.  This may even be good with some pie crust and made into lemon pie bars! I'm most definitely going to try that next time around, since the lemon really holds up excellently.  I love this recipe so much!

Good lemon meringue pie. My first time making one. Turned out pretty good, I learned you need to dollop the meringue on the top and not smooth it out too much.  The filling was good, but not quite what I was looking for. Not too sweet, not too tart. I don't like zest in my food so I didn't add it. Thanks for the recipe!

This pie is fantastic made just the way the recipe was written. It is sweet,tart and has a good consistency-just the way lemon meringue pie is supposed to be.   Also,never let your pie cool all the way before you add the meringue. The filling must be hot as to cook the bottom of the meringue so it will not slide off or weep. If your meringue is melting as you put it on the hot filling,the meringue was not whipped properly,or a mistake was made in the recipe.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I just took the pie out of the oven and it is beautiful. I had very juicy home grown lemons and had just over 1/3 cup of juice.  Very unfair for reviewers to change the recipe up and then give one star because it didn't work out. With meringue you need to start out a little slow until it is frothy and then speed things up and start adding your sugar one Tbsp at a time, by the time you are adding the final Tbsp the meringue should be almost ready...beat at high speed until you get soft to medium peaks. If you beat too long the meringue will collaspe and be useless. I use a hand mixer...my KitchenAid is so powerful it is easy to ruin delicate egg whites.

I thought this was good, didn't change one thing on this recipe.  My filling thickened up beautifully, not runny at all.  My meringue did weep, which I didn't know what that meant until I looked it up.  Apparently, the filling is supposed to be really hot when you spread the meringue to avoid weeping.  Unfortunately, I started making the meringue after I had filled my pie shell, so it had cooled some before topping with the meringue.  The meringue turned out well without adding anything extra.  There are no cooling instructions, but I let it sit on the counter for about an hour and we ate it slightly warm, which I think tasted better than refrigerated.

this is the best lemon meringue pie i have ever had.  it is a little time consuming, but well worth the effort!  the only change i made was increaing to 4 tablespoons of cornstarch instead of 3 tablespoons, but kept everything else the same.  my pie did not thicken enough with only 3 tablespoons of cornstarch. one important key i learned for lemon meringue pie is to let is cool at room temperature for about 2 hours then lightly cover and refrigerate.  this pie tastes so fresh, it is the perfect combination of tart and sweet.

I made this for my mother, and I must say, the filling was really disappointing (I used another meringue recipe). I replaced the water in the recipe with milk, but the filling still wasn't nearly as rich and dense as I'd have liked. I did strain the zest from the filling (which was no easy feat, it gets really thick as it cools), but the pie still had a bitter "off" taste. Usually the meringue is what people avoid, but the filling was the bad part this time!

This pie is fantastic!  A definite keeper!  I followed the other reviewers advice and used 1/2 cup of juice plus zest of one lemon.  The filling was delicious.  A perfect blend of tart and sweet. YUMMY!!  I poured the filling into the pastry shell while both were still hot and then immediately spread the meringue over the top and sealed off the edges, baking for 15 mins after.  No lumps at all and not runny.  I let the pie sit at room temp for 30 min and then in the fridge.  I often make pavlova, so I used a touch of vinegar in the meringue, 1/2 tblspn corn flour and a couple of drops of vanilla.  Add the sugar to meringue slowly and the corn flour helps stiffen it and the vinegar gives it a lovely glossy smooth texture.  The only problem is that it is too yummy. LOL.

The pie was o.k.  However, it did not say what size lemons to use and mine turned out extreamly tart.  This also makes it difficult for consistancy.  Other than that, I think that I'll try it again, but I'll taste the pudding as I add the lemon so I won't make the same mistake twice.

I'm not usually a lemon meringue person, but my husband is.  We both thought that this pie was really good.  I did what one reviewer suggested and added some cream of tartar to the meringue and she was right, my meringue didn't turn out watery.

This pie was great and my family loved it - it was gone in 24 hours! Next time I might try using milk instead of water in the filling, plus a little extra lemon for a little tangier taste, although it was delicious the way it was.

This recipe is quite easy to put together and very good as is, but...the measurement for the lemon juice should be 1/4 cup, as not all lemons are the same size or as juicy.  Next time, I think I'll add more lemon juice and a little less water to get a more sour taste (my preference).  I also added about four drops of yellow food color to the filling.

This is a fantastic recipe!  The lemon filling is really thick and gooey, and is complimented perfectly by the light meringue.  Just remember to prebake the pie crust!  I forgot to, and only realized it when it came out of the oven 'finished.'  Luckily, I had the energy to try it again!  It was great!

You could have included a little more detail in recipe.  I added some cream of tarter to get egg whites to form peaks.  It would have been a better recipe if it had told me to add meringue to hot filling.  I got water in pie because I cooled it first.

Wonderful pie!  I made it the day before and chilled the filling before I added the meringue.  I did try the Never-Ever-Fail Meringue by Carol on this site (I HAD to be sure!). Will make this again, one of my dad's favs!

I followed the recipe exactly. The filling is really good.  Both Times that I have made this pie, I end up with a meringue that shrinks.  I like a thick meringue layer, and felt this was not enough for a 9 inch pie.  Yummy. Im going to work on adjusting the meringue and keep using this recipe.

Awesome! Used one cup water and half a cup of milk and it still turned out nice and creamy. This is the first recipe I have followed that hasn't curdled the filling. The meringue took a long time to thicken but it turned out perfect with a pinch of cream of tartar added near the end.

This is a really good basic recipe to get you started.  I did a bit of tweaking.  I used 8 medium sized lemons from my tree,and 4.5 tablespoons of cornstarch.   The sugar and water were the same.  It has turned out fantastic, really tart and lemony and GOOD. I also put this filling on a crust made from oatmeal, dates, demerara sugar and light margarine (more nutrient dense then regular pie crust and it tastes fantastic).

Very good, made it exactly as recipe described except I passed the lemon filling through a sieve as I filled the pie shell to remove the zest and any lumps.

Delicious.
I used milk instead of water, just a personal preference made it more like pudding though. Used 2 lemons with juice and zest from both, I didn't mind th zest. Could do 3 lemons. Will make again for sure.

Hi, I  made  this pie with the 12 serving calculation because I made a deep dish pie.  It said to juice & zest 3 lemons, I used 4.  It had 2 1/4 cups of water, I used less then 2 cups of water and a bit more then 1/4 cup of lemon juice.  I ended up putting an extra T of sugar...  It was great!  The only thing I will change (it calls for 6 eggs with 12 servings), I will use the 6 yolks but 9 or 10 whites for the meringue. I decorated the top with marshmallow bunnies & malted milk ball "eggs" for Easter, SO CUTE!  Great recipe!  Don't hesitate to use this wonderful recipe!  Happy Baking:)

This is a GREAT recipe!!! I have never made lemon meringue pie before but it came awesome! I used two lemons and all of there rind for one pie, the secret to getting all of the juice out of the lemon is to warm the lemon up in the microwave for 30 seconds then roll the lemon on you counter will applying pressure ... it releases all of the juice you will be amazed how much is in there. Also the meringue turned out amazing and I added 1 tsp. of lemon juice to the egg whites before I added the sugar, it really gives the meringue a great flavor. After baking in the oven for ten minutes I immediately put the pies in the fridge. Incredible recipe and TONS of amazing flavor! This will be a new Easter tradition at my house

I tried this recipe and the biggest problem is that it doesnt say how long to cook the filling. Sorry, but "until thick" isnt accurate enough. Also, Im having a hard time spreading the egg whites on the pie filling.

pie turned out wonderful, tasted very lemony and smooth.  Meringue did brown beautifully.  My only problem was excessive weeping between the meringue and the lemon curd.  I literally had to pour off the liquid before i served.  Any suggestions?

I'd never made lemon meringue pie before (or meringue of any kind for that matter) but I just followed the instructions carefully and it came out BEAUTIFULLY. Being a lemon freak, I think the next time I make this i will try it heavier on the lemon (replacing some of the water with lemon juice), but since I'd never made anything like it before was nervous to try that the first time. That said - adhering to the recipe - it was a delicious pie and looked great, too.

Truly excellent pie! The only changes I made were substituting milk for the water and adding 1/2 tsp cream of tarter and vanilla to the meringue. The lemon filling was delicious. I ended up using 3 lemons which gave me about a half cup of juice. Next time I'm making this baby deep dish style.

Made this yesterday for a my brother-in-laws birthday... and it was great!!!  My eggs were at room temp and for the meringue I used my electric mixer (per recommendation from another recipe to save your arms.)  I left it to cool for an hour per other reviews and then put wrap on it and into the fridge... next time I will make sure the pie is completely cool before I wrap (became "wet" inside.)  Delicious!

Excellent pie!  I changed two things- Added an extra TBSP of flour and put 1/2 tsp cream of tarter in with the meringue.  Also, I added 1/2 tsp of yellow food coloring to the lemon curd to make it a prettier color.

This is a fantastic recipe! Fed it to TWO different picky-eaters and they LOVED it (even asked for seconds)!! It's the perfect amount of sweet with a bit of tartness... sure to hit the spot. (I ended up cooking the one I made a little bit longer than the recipe, by the way. First lemon meringue pie I've made.)
Just be sure to refrigerate it!! ;)

Not recommended for an inexperienced chef.  Don't skimp on corn starch (don't overdo because it will taste starchy.)  

I had to doctor the custard at the end of the last boiling period.  A last ditch effort to thicken the mixture was to add corn starch to cold lemon juice and to throw it into the existing mixture.

The recipe says "stir until think;"  ensure the mixture is THICK (like doughnut jelly) or else will not set.

Huge hit with my family!  This was my first lemon meringue pie.  Both my husband and father requested I make one - so I gave it a shot.  My dad told me I should be teaching pastry classes!  I can't take any credit as a followed the recipe exactly - EXCEPT:

I forgot the butter the second time I made it and it was still perfect.  I use the zest of one lemon, not two.

This recipe is delicious and I followed the recipe exactly! But if I can just make one observation about the serving size - I had read that this recipe was not enough and people recommended increasing the recipe by half (so 12 servings instead of 8) but I think this is for people using a real glass pie dish or just a bigger pie dish that what comes with the pre-made crusts at Publix, but my pie completely overflowed. It still tasted fantastic, but before worrying about increasing the serving size of the pie, make sure you have a big enough crust/pie tin to warrant it!

I used 3oz fresh-squeezed lemon juice, but no zest.  It didn't taste lemony enough when it was warm, but once it cooled and it was served, everyone raved that it was perfect.  The only other change I made was to use the "Meringue II" recipe from this site instead of this meringue.  It was a huge hit!  I filled the pie with the lemon curd, then began making the meringue - so I topped the pie when the filling was somewhat cooled.  There was no weeping at all.

Made for my daughter in laws birthday. She, my son and grandson, said if was OFF THE CHAIN...teenagers language. NExt time I will triple recipe and put into a 9"x 13" baking pan. I also will let the filling cool longer on the rack before placing meringue on top. Make with scratch graham crust also.
 They rated it a 10+...said best dessert I ever served them. Used the milk in lieu of water in filling.

This pie was super easy to make and very good. I made my own pie crust from this site "Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust"

The custard has a great lemon flavor.

The only thing I would change next time is add some vanilla to the Meringue to give it a flavor. Would have given 5 stars if not for that but definitely close. So I give this 4.5 stars

I've made this filling twice; once for tarts and once for pie.  It's very easy to make, the directions are spot on. It is very lemony and tart, but still sweet like pie should be. It has had rave reviews from those who have eaten it.

I used 6 egg whites, replaced the water with milk, and used 1/2 cup lemon juice. I also made sure place the hot custard into the pie and immediately top with the meringue to help cook the bottom of the meringue. Perfect! I like my lemon pie more sour, but my husband doesn't and this was right in the middle.

This recipe was the first time I had a truly successful lemon meringue pie! I used a 9in pie plate and I think it would be better to use an 8inch. I've made this twice. Both times I used 3 small lemons which I measured the juice and both times equaled a half cup of juice. Perfect flavor. Definitely spoon meringue over hot filling. I also don't boil the filling, it gets thick way before that. I'm going to try this with a smaller pan to get it to come up higher, otherwise the meringue is not tall enough and the filling only comes about half way.

This was absolutely delicious! I've made it twice. Only thing I did different was add 1/2 tsp of creme of tartar to the egg whites. As well, it's not noted in here but I did read from another review, when you pour the lemon mixture into the pie crust make sure you are putting the meringue on top right away. If the filling cools down, the bottom on the meringue doesn't attach itself to the filling and the two layers seperate. Will be making this again

Perfection, pure and simple!  Just the right balance of tart and sweet.  If you follow the recipe you will produce a fabulous pie.  What a treat to bite into this.

I used Pie Crust IV from this site and it turned out wonderful too.

 Thank you Emilie S for sharing!

Delicious. I had problems with my meringue but I think I may have added the sugar too soon. I still turned out fabulous and my dad even said it was better than his mom's!

This is a really good recipe and easy to follow. The only 2 small changes I made was that I left out the salt as I hate adding extra to foods and I also made my own pie crust. Call me old fashioned but I think if you're going to bake then it's good to do it all from scratch.
Best eaten the day of baking as storing in the fridge makes it slightly soggy.

I made this recipe set to 10 servings (I've made it as the recipe calls for and my husband wanted MORE filling)
I used lemons from my mother's lemon tree. They are sweeter lemons and I squeezed enough to yield 1/2 cup of juice. I thought it was the perfect amount!! 
I made the crust with martha stewarts pate brisee recipe and I used meringue II from this site. I have made the meringue from this recipe and it wept horribly for me. 

Happy baking!!

Chocolate Sundee--rates this pie the highest. It's quick to make from the crust to the filling.  Some people think I purchase this pie.  If you don't have a double boiler just cook over medium heat stirring constantly!  I didn't have to change a thing about it.  Excellent, bravo, stupendous, and marvelous darling.

First time making Lemon Meringue Pie.  This turned out delicious; however I did follow the advice of a few other members:  1. I changed the serving size to 12 (I was using a deep dish) 2. I let it rest on the counter for 1 hour and overnight in the fridge.  For those who are trying this and never made before, the pie was jiggly at first, but it will set up as time passes so dont worry!  I used water and not milk in mine and it has a fantastic lemon flavor!

Perfect meringue.  Follow the advice of another to prepare the meringue FIRST, which avoids separation and slop.

I am an expert baker. Thought I would try this pie since I had lemons hanging around. The meringue was nice and firm. The filling was good. But when I cut into it the crust was floating in a watery mess. Dont know what else to say.

I've made this countless times, and I suggest doubling the recipe to make 2 pies. One never lasts long enough! I always substitute 1/2 cup lemon juice for the 2 lemons, juiced and zested, and I use skim milk instead of water. Great recipe -- my dad has requested it for his birthday and Father's Day every single year since I first made it.

Truly one of the best!! Easy. I add 1.5 times the lemon because we like ours extra lemony. If humid, add a 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar to the meringue and it won't collapse, break apart or get gooey.

I must have done something terribly wrong. Though to the best of my knowledge I followed the directions exactly. First of all the filling tastes like nothing but lemon peel, it was terrible! The "zest" should be like a tsp. or something, not 2 whole lemon peels. All you could taste was a bitter peel flavor and that was it. Also the meringue came away from the sides and sweated, not very attractive. The crust ended up a soggy mess and cutting a slice of the pie was a disaster, the filling is very sticky the meringue is flimsy so it just ends up an unidentifiable messy pile when serving. Luckily I just made this for my household. Everyone tried it once and decided it wasn't good. I've made lemon meringue in the past and have had great results, not sure what went wrong with this.  Next time I plan to try something else.

One of my favorite desserts.  Very lemony, not too sweet, and just tart enough.  Very easy to make.  I do make my own pie crust instead of using store bought.  Yummy!

I made this recipe but put it into pre-baked tarts.  It was amazing! I look forward to making this in the full-sized pie version.  Not hard at all to make.  Had no difficulties EXACTLY as written and it was nice and thick/set.

Hello, I made this pie today, and it came out wonderfull!

I followed the recipe but used the Meringue II recipe from this site as others did with great results.

I used two real lemons and their zest..

Perfect in every way... Yummy

This pie is definitely a "Gramdmas" pie. It is exactly (except for the meringue)the same as my Gram's recipe. If I had made this for her she would be proud. Of course, as a cook, I had to tweak and add some things, but all in all, an excellent pie. A tip for those that don't like meringue: add a teaspoon of vanilla extract, a little cinnamon or nutmeg, add some sugar gradually as you beat the egg whites and the merigue is as delicious as the pie. My husband said that he has never eaten meringue until I made it on my pie.

Made this last night, it was so easy after reading reviews. I only used a few tsp of lemon zest but otherwise, followed the recipe. It thickened up super quick, didn't have any issues at all with that. I used half powdered sugar and half gran sugar for the meringue as another reviewer had suggested and also left the oven open for an hour after cooking to cool off and my pie turned out absolutely gorgeous, no weeping, set up perfectly and tasted amazing. The next day the pie still looks great and tastes even better.

I'm giving this a 5 even though the custard filling was too ... thick I guess.  But I think that's my fault.  It was thick almost immediately after I added the egg yolks (in fact, it was stiff before that) so I figured I needed to cook it longer to get thicker.  10 minutes later it was thicker....but I think that's what made the custard like a lump.  The meringue was perfect as is - I whipped it for a very long time.  The taste was excellent!  I made the easy pie crust recipe from this site, but I might try a "real" pie crust next time.  I suggest if you've never made LM that you watch this tutorial video first on How to Make Lemon Meringue Pie on Allrecipes.

Perfect - even better than my moms!! At least I thought! I never made Lemon pie before - I made two - the second pie (one piece) stayed in the refrig. for 6 days and was still wonderful - the crust started to get a bit damp - course I used my mom's pie crust recipe - which I will enter someday.  Also used Meringue II by Sandra - the only thing there I did diff. was to cook the top three ingreds. over low heat till clear.  It was also perfect - and was still stuck to the top of the pie after 6 days - no weaping - perfect!! I used the BEST pie crust - lard - vinegar - water - egg etc. I'm sure any pie would start to get a bit soggy after 6 days!! Even yours!







Dear "FOOD LOVER"
Obviously your pie crust needs some enhansing - try this:
3 cups flour
1 tsp. salt
1 1/4 cups lard 
1 egg well beaten
5 Tabl. cold water
1 Tabls. Vinegar
Cut lard into flour and salt, mixing well. In another bowl mix egg, water and vinegar.  Clump second mixture into first.  This gets sticky---keep at it.  Form into two  balll and chill for 30 mins. before rolling out flour surface - if you mess up---just roll it out again---can't mess up with this crust - its the BEST!!!

I made this today and it was great, but a bit too overpowering. I think 1 lemon w/ zest will work better, aswell as 3 eggs instead of four. Plus you did not mention cooling time...However, 45 min on the counter and 2 hours in the fridge worked magic. I will make this wonderful pie for the rest of my life; it is the closest to grandmas, in texture and taste, that I have found.

I would consider myself a pretty advanced baker, especially in the dessert area, but this recipe was a disaster. I followed the instructions to a tee and the meringue turned out incredibly runny and the pie became very soggy. I did refrigerate it for about an hour, but unless you serve this immedately, I'd say make something else.

Sorry but this pie did not work out at all.  Face-puckering, gelatinous, soupy mess.

I had reviewed this in the past but had to respond to those who found it watery. If the recipe is followed correctly and time is taken to boil the filling gradually (med-low heat vs med-high), there is no way this will be watery. I have used this recipe dozens of times and it has never failed! If you try to rush ANY of the process it will fail but if you follow the recipe, you will receive rave reviews.

I REALLY LIKE THIS MERINGUE PIE, BUT I DOUBLE THE RECIPE AND MY FILLING WAS TOO WATERY.  I USED 4 LEMONS, THE LEMONS WERE KIND OF BIG, AND I THINK IT MAY HAVE BEEN TO MUCH JUICE FROM THE LEMON.  I'M JUST STARTING TO COOK, TO ME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER IF THE RECIPE SPECIFIED THE AMOUNT OF JUICE THE PIE NEEDED.

I've always made my lemon meringue pies using the cook and serve pudding mix. I probably won't bother doing that again as this was superior. The only thing I changed is using lemon juice intead of lemons (1/2 cup) and it was pretty tart. Next time I might use 1/3 cup. The meringue turned out very high and was incredibly light. Start to finish it took one hour, including making the pie crust - I always measure all my ingredients and have them out and ready to go, but it wasn't a difficult recipe to follow. It's always nice to find a recipe that doesn't require an extra trip to the store as all these ingredients are probably already in your pantry.

Yummy!  This was my first pie ever and it was delicious.  I did have a problem though...how long do we have to let it cool?? I had no idea..so mine came out a little runny when I tried to slice it...probably because I didn't let it cool long enough.  Make sure to use an electric mixer.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This recipe was fantastic.  I actually made "mini" pies in a muffin tin & they were a big hit at a BBQ I went to last night.
I did follow some previous reviewers' advice and used milk instead of water for the filling & it came out perfect - creamy & just lemony enough. The only other thing I changed was that I added juice from a 3rd lemon as I found that 2 lemons didn't give enough flavour.  Took the leftovers to work today and everyone was really impressed.

Tip:  Crush or grind finely about 4 ginger snap cookies (about 3 Tbs.); sprinkle over the bottom of the baked pie crust before filling.  This makes a moisture barrier and prevents the bottom from getting soggy.  Delicious pie!

Review:  The filling is so very easy to prepare and sets up perfectly every time.  I use this recipe not only for pies, but for mini tarts as well (I made my own mini phyllo cups out of scraps I had frozen)---I adjust the recipe amounts.  As for the meringue, I added a pinch of cream of tartar to the egg whites while getting them frothy.  I will use this recipe again and again.  Thanks so much!

I made this exactly according to the recipe (only baking for 12 minutes to get the meringue the proper golden brown). This was my first time making a meringue pie and it turned out perfect and delicious! I cracked the eggs first to separate them, because I had read that it is easier to separate the yolks and whites of cold eggs, then let the whites sit at room temperature because they whip up easier when not as cold (I also made the meringue using my kitchen-aid, which I'm sure helped out a lot). With the two lemons I used, I got about 1 tablespoon of zest, and 1/2 cup of lemon juice. I used a pre-made frozen pie crust, which I baked ahead of time. After baking the completed pie, I let it cool at room temperature for an hour, then in the fridge for 3 hours, according to the video instructions on this recipe. I tented some aluminum foil over it, leaving a little gap to help the moisture escape, as a previous reviewer had suggested. I think I will make the meringue before the filling next time, only because it separated a bit from the filling, but the taste and texture was still incredible. Thank you for a delicious, easy recipe!

This is a good recipe, but I always have a problem with the single crust.  It always falls down into the pie plate during baking.  Today I prepared two 10-inch crusts in glass pans and put them in the freezer for 15 minutes before baking at 350 degrees.  The first crust fell even though I used metal pie weights (they were light-weight and not long enough).  Before baking the second crust, I covered it with three layers of aluminum foil and then put a smaller glass pie plate on top of it, tucking it just under the edge of the crust.  It worked!  The sides of the crust remained in place!  (I removed the smaller pie plate halfway through the baking time.)  Because my granddaughter requested a lemon meringue pie instead of a birthday cake, I wanted it to be perfect.  To tell the truth, though, I probably could have used the fallen pie crust, because you couldn't see the crust after the meringue was put on.   I use Martha Stewart's pate brisee recipe for my pie crusts.

Definitely needs some changes, mine turned out a little too tart the flavours weren't quite balanced so for the filling next time I would: 

-add more sugar or less lemon to the filling (I had large lemons so that might be the issue, the filling was too acidic)

-filling was OK. The consistency was not thick enough so as in other reviews add more cornstarch!!!

-more meringue less filling, I found the ratio was unbalanced

-DO NOT USE A STORE BOUGHT CRUST, my biggest mistake was that, although the pre-made works for some pies, it really doesn't stand up to this one enough- definitely roll out a thicker crust for this one!

I need to try this again. My meringue came out perfectly. I added 1/4 tsp cream of tartar to the egg whites and sugar and used a metal bowl that I had sitting in the fridge overnight (along with my mixer's beaters.) I made sure to use the high speed setting on the mixer from the start (learned from a previous experience) and really was proud of how the meringue ended up. Buuuttt, then I managed to overcook the filling and there didn't seem to be as much of it to put into the pie shell as I should have had, though it still tasted pretty good. Lesson learned! Hopefully, everything will turn out nicely when I make this for my mom's birthday in October!

It's 4 a.m. and I'm secretly tasting my first-ever lemon meringue pie. It's delicious! I made it in a 9" ceramic pie plate. I was worried that my crust would get burnt by the time it all finished baking, but I guess the ceramic plates are more forgiving and ideal for beginner bakers... As other reviews suggested I used 1/2 cup of lemon juice and a little bit over 1 tablespoon of lemon zest. I think that it could be a little bit more tart -- but ten I would have half of the pie at once by myself! For the filling I replaced water with milk and added 1/2 tablespoon more of cornstarch like the other reviewers suggested. Thank you folks for explaining how the physics of this pie work, I have very little experience baking and it seemed like a level-up to me, but after reading all of the reviews I knew exactly what to do and the pie turned out perfect! My meringue did flatten a bit after I put it in the refrigerator. I cooled the pie for 1 hr in room temperature first -- maybe it was a little bit too early? I'll wait longer next time. Aside from that, it's fantastic!

If there was a 6th star option, I would gladly give it to this recipe.  I've made this twice and each time it is heavenly, lemony perfection.  Sweet, but not too sweet.  Tart, but not too tart.  For the crust, I usually do a frozen store bought because, although I'm a great cook, I fail at pie crusts.

I made this for a family get together on Memorial Day weekend.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious.  From reading other reviews, I zested roughly 1tbs and squeezed 1/2 cup of lemon juice (which ended up being 2 lemons as the recipe says).  Once I poured the eggs into my sugar mixture, I only let it boil a minute more so it didn't get too thick.  I also baked the pie crust in the oven until it was slightly golden before pouring the curd inside.  I used my mixer to make the meringue and poured it over the warm curd.  Once out of the oven, I let it sit at room temperature for 1 hour and then put it in the fridge for an additional 5 hours to let it firm up.  Another great recipe to keep in my recipe box!  I love tartness, so maybe next time I may add 1/4 cup of lemon juice to experiment!

First time making lemon meringue pie from scratch. WOW was it delicious. Made the filling and meringue exactly as the recipe is written (but used baked graham cracker crust). Lemon juice came out to about 1/2 cup. Don't use milk if you want a real lemon meringue pie! Perfect tang and texture.

I like to run the curd through a fine sieve before pouring into crust just to make sure to remove any remaining zest. Turns out perfect every time.

I made this exactly as it was written and it was awesome! I will take the advice of others re: refrigeration, as some of the meringue separated but it didnt matter. It was delicious and this was my first ever attempt. Thanks for sharing!

This is a very good recipe. The pie is lemony, delicious and very refreshing. The perfect balance between sweet and sour. The curd concistency is perfect. I used just 3 egg whites for the merengue because egg yolk dropped into egg whites and realized with four whites it would be better. Will use this recipe again especially in the summertime.

I took this recipe for my very first lemon meringue pie, changed all of the ingredients to 12 servings from 8 as it is shown, and it turned out to be really good! I'll definitely make it again.

For my pie pan, I need to make it for 12 servings (and not the default 8).  I followed a few suggestions, changing out the water for milk and using 1/2 cup lemon juice (as I had no lemons on me but I also made for 16 servings, so I'll reduce the lemon juice to 8 Tbps of juice next time.)

Not much of a cook/baker here but was told this was a favorite by a friend so thought I'd give it a whirl.  I was surprised at how easy this was to make.  I made it exactly as per the recipe and it turned out great!  I let cool for about 30 mins before refrigerating (posts on here recommend an hour but I wanted it chilled in time for dinner) and refrigerated for about 3 hours and it was great!  Crust wasn't soggy... no runny curd or meringue.  I'll definitely make this again given how easy it was!!

I've made this recipe twice and my daughter made it once on her own after that and she's 10 years old. This recipe is easy and SUPER delicious. Keeping this in the back pocket for those quick, go-to desserts when I'm in a pinch for time but want something delicious.

This recipe was great, I used 1/4 cup of fresh lemon juice, and milk, not water.
if you like a thick pie, double the recipe.
i let it sit on the counter for two hours, then refrigerated 1 hour uncovered before serving and it was perfect.

I have made this recipe many times, but I make it without the meringue. Instaed I sprinkle levender flowers around the edge of the pie. The smell is lovely and the flavor of the lavender is lovely with the lemon.

The "juice of two lemons" is a ridiculously useless measurement. Not only do lemons vary wildly in size, the amount of juice you can get from a lemon can vary even for lemons of the same size. I cut the water down to one cup and made the fresh squeezed lemon juice one cup, too.

Wonderful recipe! If your having a problem with watery filling here is how you fix it 1. Boil your filling for about 5-7 minutes or until VERY thick. 2. Before you bake the crust egg wash the whole thing. 3. Ensure you seal your meringue to the crust. 4. Put your meringue on when it has cooled slightly and firmed up a bit. If you do this your pie will come out beautifully every time.

Came out great.  The only change made was I added about 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla extract to the meringue.

Next time I need to be sure and read reviews first and cook the egg mixture for at least 10 minutes... I thought it would thinken as it cooled so I didn't cook mine near long enough.. even though it did seem to set up by following the suggestions of other reviewers 1 hour on the counter followed by 6 hours uncovered in the fridge... also make sure I beat the meringue for a little longer too into it gets really fluffy.... I added 1/4 tsp of cream of tarter to that and next time I might also add a 1/2 tsp vanilla and then a tablespoon of cornstarch after stiff peaks form.... otherwise it seemed to turn out very good...

I finally have a "go to" recipe for lemon meringue pie.  I read the reviews and made the following modifications:  substituted milk for the water; used 3 and 1/2 tbsp cornstarch; and 1/2 cup juice from real lemons.  I also used a cookie crumb bottom and decorated the edge with more cookies.  It was a little bit of work, but well worth it!

This was so easy to make but it was soooo good!  My dad loves lemon meringue pie so I made this for Easter.  I was a bit worried it wouldn't have enough lemon flavor with the small amount of juice I got from the two lemons but it was just right.  I always put the bowl and whisk attachment to my Kitchenaid in the freezer until I'm ready to make my meringue which helps whip it up fast.  Thanks for a quick, easy recipe!

This pie gets four stars because technically, it's a good recipe, and easy to follow.  Both times I made it, it turned out looking amazing, but for me it just lacks a bit of depth of flavour.  I think I'm looking for something maybe creamier and 'zing-ier'.

I made this pie for a friend's birthday and what a surprise that it turned out so delicious.  I'm not a pie baker but because she loves tart desserts I decided to give it a try.  I didn't alter the ingredients being that it was the 1st time at it.  I'd like to try adding the cream of tartar to the meringue next time to see what the difference is.  Otherwise the pie's perfect.

This recipe was literally one of the easiest recipes I've ever made! The only things I changed were I used milk instead of water and I made sure to use a glass pie pan, per someone else's review.  I also made and baked the crust from scratch using the "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" before starting this recipe. Even my fiance's southern grandmother who JUST made this pie for Christmas said this is how she used to make them (with the milk) when she was younger, and she's was SO proud of me! DELICIOUS! :)

Very tasty! Too tart for my son's taste, but not many 10 year olds like lemon desserts....my husband and I thought it was fantastic!! For the crust I used the one called Grandmom XXXX pie crust....can't remember the name but it's description said it was 100 yr old recipe and it had an egg in the mix.....look for it, it is worth it!!!

Only used the lemon part of this recipe.  Used my own pie crust recipe and the high altitude meringue recipe from this site.  It was so easy and turned out great.  Never been a big fan of Lemon Meringue pie and haven't really eaten it all that much, but I got great reviews and I liked it myself.  Will try again.

Delicious!  Whipping the eggs into stiff peaks was hard the first time, so just remember these tips:
1. Use room temperature eggs and a glass bowl NOT a plastic bowl
2. When cracking the eggs, be sure not to get any of the yolk.
3. Before whipping, add 1 tsp. salt

Excellent, I made 2 the same day, I used 1/2 c fresh lemon juice, water,no milk. I found that if I timed everything perfectly, I would be taking the hot pie crust out of the oven just about the time the lemon curd was done( and no do not cook for 14 min it will break down the cornstarch) I mixied the meringue at the same time so I would be able to put it on the hot curd. The second pie I used 6 egg whites , the meringue was beautiful and high. Great recipe thanks for sharing

excellent recipe....even though I forgot the butter it was nice and thick and meringue did stick to crust.  I sprinkled it with a bit of sugar before baking.  Tastes good too.  I was very happy with it and will make this again. Will not sprinkle meringue with sugar next time...does not need any more sweetness.  Recipe is perfect the way it is.  Needs to sit overnite uncovered to set up somewhere cold.  Was kinda "watery" after sitting out the first hour to cool.

All I did was add more lemon juice and zest because I like my pie really really lemony....other than that the recipe is absolutely perfect.  It's easy and fast and everyone loved it.

Great recipe! I used the "pie crust IV" recipe from this site to go with it. For my first time making it I was really impressed and it was a definite hit at dinner! The only addition I made was to add 1/8tsp of lemon juice to the egg whites to counteract the shrinking/weeping and I used about 4 lemons (1/2 cup of juice) and omitted the rind since I dont like the gritty texture. Will definitely use again. Thanks!

The meringue doesnt cook soo it keeps its raw flavour of egg i would suggest making a syrup out of the sugar with a tablespoon of water until its transparent and bubbly and then while whipping the egg whites until foamy start adding the syrup and keep beating until stiff peaks ( 7-8 minutes) then the meringue will taste alot better 
but other than that a great recipe

Added a bit more sugar than the recipe called for, milk instead of water, and all cornstarch (no gluten). Cooked in my first gluten free pie crust. It brought raves from the whole family. :)

This was the first time making a Lemon Meringue Pie~ It was great!  Everyone loved it!  The meringue did get a little flat- wondering if I wiped it too much or too little, so before I make it again I'll have to do some research on how long to wipe it for!  One more thing- I didn't nor would I change anything about this recipe!!!

The lemon part was awesome. But the meringue was a HUGE fail. I tried twice on this and wasted a TON of eggs. I looked up other meringue recipes online and it was different. Requiring cream of tartar. I had to use whipped cream instead. Big disappointment.

this pie was fantastic. the changes i made were to use 3/4 cup low fat milk and 3/4 water in place of 1 1/2 cups water, and 9 tablespoons of white sugar and 1/2 tsp cream of tartar for the meringue. it came out absolutely perfect, not too rich, not too sweet, with the ideal meringue:curd ratio. the only problem i encountered was that my meringue started weeping not long after i took it out of the oven, but nobody really minded because everybody was focussed on eating the pie! i will definitely make this again and again. THIS IS A KEEPER!!

Yum! Delicious and relatively simple recipe. Although, I would not recommend trying to make the meringue without an electric mixer. It was very tiring trying to whip it sufficiently with just a whisk and my two hands. But, it was still worth it. Thank you!

followed the recipes to the "T" amazing flavor , very balanced sweet/tart taste. I made the meringue on a humid day so it was flat but still tasted great ! My ONLY change was to double the filling because we love lemon ! Will make again !

Excellent recipe! Followed it exactly, with the exception of adding 1/2 tsp of cream-of-tartar to the egg whites, since I'm fan of mile-high meringue. 

Recipe works out beautifully-just don't walk away from the oven! My oven runs hot, apparently, and made the meringue dark-brown in four minutes. 

Perfect starter recipe to work with, and adjust according to one's taste. 

When working with meringue, using an electric mixer is a must. If you're lucky enough to have a stand-mixer, I find that chilling the bowl & whisk before hand helps quite a bit when whipping the egg whites.

Yummyy i was surprised by how easy this was. It was my first time making one and the filling was so delicious! Excellent pie. The only thing i didnt like was how the meringue was seperated from the filiing and kept slipping off.

I loved the flavor and tanginess of the lemon filling and the meringue was great(although I did add a 1/2 tsp. of Cream of Tartar to it.)  I would have liked more of the lemon filling so next time I will definitely do 1 1/2 times the filling. Other than that it was perfect!

Excellent pie!  I used light graham cracker crust instead and since neither myself nor my husband like meringue, we omitted this part and used light cool whip to top it off.  We loved it!  thank you...

I made this with the following ingredient changes: 3 lemons juiced and zested, 3-1/2 TBSP cornstarch, 1-1/2 cups skim milk. This came out incredible! My husband doesn't like lemon desserts and he had 3 slices. He said it was better than most diners! The key instructions I followed were to prick and pre-bake the pie crust at 400 degrees for 10 minutes, next make the meringue so that it's ready to top the hot filling right away, and once the pie is cooked, make sure to let it set out for about an hour before putting in the refrigerater uncovered for another 4 hours before serving.

For some reason, it was perfect...no weeping, but it was a gift...when she cut into it the lemon was liquid. It had set out at room temp all day..could that be the problem? The taste was amazing and it is comparable to my grandfathers lemon pie. In fact I used his recipe along side this one. Didn't know about refridging it. Will try again

I was extremely disappointed with this recipe. I read all the reviews and was expecting something great. I followed everything exactly as written, it cooked beautifully, when it finished I even wanted to take a picture and post it because it turned out like a perfect meringue pie. But alas! I tried a bite and it was horrid! the lemon was overpowering and gooey and completely inedible.

This was very good. I've never made a Lemon Meringue Pie so I was a little nervous but it was easy and delicious! I doubled the filling since I was using a deep dish pie crust and didn't want to be short on the lemon filling. Thanks for the recipe!

First time in my life baking and tasting a meringue pie.  It is absolutely easy and tastes so yummy.  My 7 yo boy took a bite, his reaction was: closed his eyes and became speechless.  He just could say "hmm.... hmm...".  There is no weeping, not runny.

But I did modify a little like the other suggested. I substituted water with milk, and added a little cream of tatar into the meringue.  As for the lemon juice, just take 1/2 cup. Don't bother what the other reviewers said, coz some lemons more juicy (fresh).  My 2 lemons yielded just nicely 1/2 cups.

This pie looks very impressive and is definitely a show off.  Will keep making this again and again!

I enjoy a stronger lemon taste and did 3/4 C water and 3/4 cup lemon juice (from lemons).  I also used fresh lemons off the tree!  Amazing!

This was delicious, I have made this pie before, in England, but needed a guide for measurements of ingredients now in the USA. The premade pastry i got could have been better (Pilsbury) and i had to add an extra spoon of sugar to the egg whites to help them stiffen better, i think it depends on the size of eggs used. Will definately be doing another one soon.

YUMMY!   This turned out terrific, I used 3 small lemons since my lemons were pretty tiny.  Otherwise I made it and rated it EXACTLY as it is written and I will make it again and again.  Oh yea, it does help to have your eggs at room temperature.

Very easy to make and the perfect ratio of lemon curd to meringue. Make sure when you add the meringue that the curd is still very hot. This will allow the bottom of the meringue to cook and not be runny when the pie is complete. You can make the meringue first and then the curd to ensure this.  I added about 1t cream of tartar to the meringue after adding the sugar, just to make sure that it stiffened up.   I used meyer lemons and it wasn't sour enough for me. Also I don't think 2 lemons was nearly enough. I used the juice from 4 and the zest of 2, the consistency was perfect.  This pie is better the next day!

Helpful hint: don't try to whip the egg whites using an immersion blender! It just doesn't work. I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup, my 2 lemons (actually 3 small lemons) yielded 1/3 cup of juice and 1 Tbsp. of zest. This left me with a flavorful, lemony tang for the curd. But, my meringue was very disappointing (see above)!

Very good lemon meringue pie. Lemon Meringue pie recipes are all pretty much the same. Sorry to say, but if you mess it up, it's your error. It's pretty easy and basic to follow. So for the reviewers who gave this recipe less than 5 stars and "tweaked" the recipe, tried to make it lo-cal or didn't cook the filling enough or too much, etc. It's your error! Pies such as this, arent made to be tweaked or replaced with lo-cal ingredients! Erghh.what's the point of making a pie? Seriously..anyways, this is very similiar to my mom and gramma's recipe and just as good. I love lemon meringue pie! thanks for the recipe

Made a test run today, measuring out half cup of juice an a little less than 1/4c of zest from my two lemons. It really was easy but you want it to be a ROLLING boil the second half or it takes forever..I think it got yellower?!? I put it in a graham cracker crust an will put on the meringue when the whites reach room temp. So far it's DELISH!!!

I would like to write another review of this recipe.  First off, its is THE BEST lemon meringue pie on this site.  Second, I thought this might help others who may not have fresh lemons on hand.  I always have a bottle of RealLemon juice in the fridge, but had to estimate how much to use.  I have made this pie twice in the past several months.  The first time, I made it with 1 1/2c. juice.  It was good, but tart.  The next time I made it, I used 1 1/3c and it was perfect.  Thank you very much Emilie, for submitting this new family favorite.  My father in law requests it often.

This turned out great for me.  My first time ever cooking a lemon meringue pie.  I had no problem with runny filling, I was told ahead of time not to over cook the filling.  My own personal preference is for a more lemony pie, so I will tweak it a bit  next time but this turned out just great.

I am not a baker by any means. I followed the advise about making the meringue first so it can be added to the pie right as it came out of the oven. Other than that, I followed the recipe to the T. It came out PERFECT. Not as scary as I thought...I honestly believed that I would completely screw it up. How I impressed myself! Love it, Love it, Love it!

This pie was fantastic and super easy to make! I like how nothing was wasted (I hate making meringue and having to throw out the yolks, or making something that calls for yolks and having to throw away the whites). I made my own crust from my favorite pie crust recipe on this site (pie crust IV) and baked it in the oven until it was lightly browned. My best friends loved it!

A++++. PERFECTION. For those that are experiencing "weeping" of the meringue make sure you are spreading your meringue over PIPING HOT filling. This ensures that the lower portion is getting "cooked" while browning in the oven. I, like others used the Meringue II recipe for the meringue part. KEEPER!

This is a GREAT recipe.  We grow our own lemons and it only takes the juice of half a lemon to get a cup of lemon juice.  So that was all I used and turned out PERFECT!  I also cheated and used a graham cracker crust which was also great tasting.  Thanks so much!

Well, I've just finished my first ever Lemon Meringue pie. Unfortunately, I don't like the pie, but it's my husband's grandpas FAVORITE...so....I feel confindent that he will LOVE it. It was fairly easy to make. I think meringue is a hit or miss kind of thing. The peaks didn't get as stiff as I would have liked them, but I think it depends on the weather and it's rather humid here today. Overall it was easy...it smells great and I'm sure it will taste just as great. Thanks for the easy recipe.

This is perfect. I have made this recipe for years. If you have trouble with a runny filling, you're not cooking it long enough. Also, add a little vanilla to the meringue, then put it on top of the filling while the filling is still hot so that the underside cooks slightly. This will keep it from weeping. Cooking the meringue a few minutes longer also helps to dry it out a little.

This is a wonderful pie- I loved it.  It came together beautifully too.  The texture was perfect- the lemon filling was perfectly firm and the meringue was high and fluffy.  One thing- my lemon mixture thickened a lot even before it started to boil, so at that point I added the butter, then tempered the egg yolks and stirred for about 2 more mintues, and by that time it was very thick so I took it off the heat.  Thanks for the great recipe, Grandma!  ;)

I made this recipe and it was great. One of the best pies I’ve made in a while. I love the tartness. The recipe calls for two lemons juiced and zested, the lemons I had were small so I just used a ½ cup as a guide line. It’s a keeper, I will make it again. Thank you for the recipe.

This is very good - I used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 powdered sugar for the meringue and it cut down on the weeping.  One suggestion for new cooks - zest (grate) your lemons before cutting them and squeezing out the juice.  Too hard to hang on to otherwise.

I can't give this a very good rating because it was very watery and I couldn't serve it at Thanksgiving.  The flavor was great though, and I'm going to try it again and re-rate it if it turns out well next time in case I did something wrong.

Love this recipe but being from the South, I like mine a little sweeter and add a 1/4 cup more sugar.  Also, I cook the filling all together, except butter, instead of adding hot ingredients to the eggs yolks.  Just cook it at a low-med temperature and stir constantly with a wire whisk. Easier and just as creamy.

I made this for my husband's birthday. This is the first time he had ever had homemade lemon meringue pie. I was nervous because it's a favorite dessert of his he requests from his mother. In the end he LOVED it and admitted that he liked it more than his mothers!! That's a big compliment. I myself don't like lemon meringue and it was actually pretty good. I did have trouble with the meringue, but it was my first time making meringue, so it might have been my lack of experience. I had to make two batches and it still didn't turn out quite like the recipe said.

I think this recipe was very good.  I made this Lemon Meringue for Father’s Day, everyone raved about how delicious it was.  Wish there would have been better instructions; I have never made a Lemon Meringue Pie before.  Used suggestions from this site and another site, for complete instructions.  Also added cream of tarter and pinch of salt to my Meringue.  Did use 2 zested lemons, on fine grate, did not have a problem with “bits” like others.  Did NOT have a problem with running or weeping, did cool pie at room temp for an hour (thanks Trudy for suggestion).  Worth the time to make this recipe!  Thanks Emily for sharing this recipe.

I made this recipe for fathers day, what a hit. I doubled the recipe to make two pies, somehow didn't double the water and it still turned out great, a little more tart, but yummy! I also made a single pie and it was also really good. Will make this recipe again!

This pie was delicious!  I made it for Father's Day because it's my dad's favorite and everyone loved it.  The meringue was about 3" high and the lemon custard was just the perfect amount of "tart".  I would definitely make this again.

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I think the lemon zest in it makes it just a tad too strong. Next time, I'll use just the lemon juice. Thanks!

The flavor of this pie was excellent...I didn't cook the lemon filling long enough (wasn't thick enough)...so persevere with cooking your filling until it is thick! It takes awhile.

This is almost as good as my own grandma's lemon meringue pie....I've made this several times and  it has always turned out. This is everyone's favorite pie at my house. Not too tart, not too sweet. Yummm! I've tried several lemon pie recipes to date, but this remains my #1 choice. Don't take shortcuts with this and try to substitute the bottled lemon juice or jarred zest, only use real lemons! Ssshhhh.... that's Grandma's secret.

This is the first lemon meringue pie i've ever made, and it was a home run out of the park! I must confess, while making it, I was not sure if it was going to turn out. I was not sure if the lemon mixture was thick enough... tho the meringue was PERFECTION. I thought I might have a crust and meringue pie with a liquidy middle. But I let it cool on a rack after baking till room temp, then tossed in the fridge for about an hour. When I sliced, it was a perfect pie. Tart and light and delicious.

I also used the meringue recipe ("Meringue II") once I tried making the meringue described in this recipe and found it a little too runny (I was worried it wouldn't be firm enough, and I'm glad I went with the Meringue II instead) but I'm still not sure how to get those cute little "peaks" on the meringue. Any tips? Anyway, the filling was great. I didn't use lemon zest because I didn't have a grater, and on top of that I don't like it too sour. No zest worked great - I just used about 1/2 a lemon more worth of juice. I made my own crust (Using the "All American Apple Pie" crust recipe) and that made all the difference. The recipe is excellent, but go for the Meringue II recipe for the meringue.

The pie was very good but a bit too sweet. I've never made it so I didn't know how thick you should let the filling get. I know it thickens a bit more when it cools. Also Ididn't really know how to make the meringue so I don't think it came out the way it was supposed to. But it still had a good flavor.

My first meringue pie was such a hit.  The picky 13 yo even wanted seconds.  My meringue was watery as noted by other reviewers, so next time I will use a different recipe, which will be soon, maybe even next weekend.  I absolutely loved this pie.  A real keeper.

I like the filling a lot. I got 1/2 cup of juice from two lemons. I added yellow food coloring so it'll look prettier. There is no way on earth your filling will turn out watery if you follow the instructions. Keep boiling and stirring until it's thick enough. I strained the filling before pouring in the pie shell to get rid of some floating egg particle thingies. The meringue wept a little and it kind of separated (shrunk) from the filling. Might have been my fault, i'm not sure.

This was a great pie! If you want really strong lemon flavor, don't use lemon juice from concentrate, use fresh squeezed. I used concentrate and it didn't have a very strong lemon flavor. I loved that the lemon filling was so thick though, not runny at all! I will definitely make this again! Yum!

This pie brought a tear to my Dad's eye! No joking.  He said this was the closest he had ever tasted to his Mom's homemade lemon pie.  This recipe was way easier than I ever imagined.  I have never made a pie of any kind before  ever!  And this was a cinch!  Very delicious, and a definate crowd pleaser!  This will make a permanent home in my recipe box.  Thanks for helping me help my Dad remember my Grandma.  Jen

This is just deeevine...had me rolling my eyes as I ate it. Made it with limes, and it was just as good, if not better. But if you make it with limes, use milk -- It comes out smoother & creamier.

I must of used the 2 most juicy lemons!  This pie was so tart that i had a very hard time eating it.  Glad I pre-tried it before making it for my dad's father's day dessert.  I got just under 1 cup of lemon juice from 2 lemons! I am going to try it again using 1/4 of a cup.  Other wise it was great.  It came out with heaps of meringue (my favourtie part).  Will try this again, with suggested alterations. Made this again with 1/4 cup lemon juice wholla!! Amazing.

This turned out fantastic.  I don't bake much and it was definitely my first attempt at lemon meringue pie...  I used the juice of 2 lemons, which gave me 1/2 cup and the zest of one and a half lemons.  I actually used a pre-made graham crust and added cream of tartar and vanilla to the meringue - whipped it a long time and it gave a lot of it; enough to cover the pie with at least an inch of the stuff.  I also used 3.5 tbsps of cornstarch and after adding the yolks, cooked it for an additional 10-12 minutes, constantly stirring.  I made the meringue after pouring the lemon curd in the crust and let the whole pie cool for an hour after before sticking it in the fridge overnight - it turned out perfectly; nothing runny, the lemon layer was just the way it should be as was the meringue and there was no liquid in between.  The meringue did slightly separate from the crust but it wasn't much of a problem; perhaps I didn't seal it as well as I should have or perhaps it was the graham crust.  Fantastic recipe!!

Excellent Recipe! I've never made any sort of pie & as this was my first i was preparing for disaster but it turned out pretty well. One tip is to measure out all the ingredients first as you do need to work fast. I used 2 meduim size lemons (this gave it as much lemon flavour as one you would buy in a coffee shop) & milk instead of water. Make sure the mixture is quite thick before taking it off heat to put into the pastry or it will be runny when it comes out of the oven

Makes a very delicious lemon merigue pie.  Would recommend, however, that you double the amount of ingredients to make the filling.  Perfect!

Look no further for your lemon meringue pie recipe!  This one is perfect!  I used a refridgerated pie crust (the kind you unfold and bake), and substituted milk for the water.  Was almost too pretty to eat!

LOVED IT!!! It's my first ever attempt at a pie, and as a very inexperienced 16 year old it was quite a challenge but well worth it! I used a pie crust recipe from this site too and it really complimented the pie filling recipe. Oh and just a hint if anyone else finds it really hard to find cornstarch where they live! I used 2 tbsps of all-purpose flour for every tablespoon of cornstarch in the recipe and it worked out fine, but a tad thicker than I think it was meant to be...tasted great tho! Got tons of compliments from the family, am definitely going to do this again!

This lemon meringue pie is awesome.  I have tried several recipes for it and this is by far my favorite.  I added about twice as many egg whites to my meringue to give it more "poof" (I also added about a TBS more sugar to it).  Just as a warning...I covered my pie after it sat for about 30 minutes and I probably should have let it set longer.  As a result, I had some bits of moisture on my meringue, but the pie still tasted fine. I highly recommend trying it.

this was an excellent recipie!  I also substituted milk for the water to make the pie creamier....and i had to use 3 lemons instead because the lemons i had werent very juicy. i ended up using 1/4 cup of the fresh lemon juice and it came to the perfect lemon taste.  

after refrigerating the pie there was a slight separation between the lemon and maringue....but you could hardly notice it. (i only noticed because i was looking for it)...my boyfriend and his family LOVED the pie...i will deffinatly be making this one again. thank you emilie for sharing your grandmothers recipie

Tastes great!  Next time I'll try the milk substitute for the water trick and an electric mixer for the meringue (my arm was VERY tired and I had to recruit my husband to help me beat the rest).  This is the first pie I have EVER made and it came out great.  Will definitely make again!

Really excellent, perfect combination of sweet and tart.  Custard is firm and set up perfectly at 1 mile high here in Denver.  Has kept very well in the fridge for multiple days as well.

This pie is awesome !  My husband never liked lemon pie now he cleans it up.   I love that I can use fresh lemons off our trees and it turns out perfect every time.   I did adjust the meringue thou
I do as the recipe calls but I add 1/8 cream of Tartar and a drop of white Mexican vanilla 
Gives the meringue a better flavor.

After not making a lemon meringue pie for almost 18 years because it was so hard I decided to try again. I've made my second one in a week and have requests to make a few more from friends and family. Very easy recipe! I suggest you let the egg whites for the meringue get to room temp. They whip up in about 15 minutes.  I also added 1  extra egg white and 1 extra tsp sugar to meringue to make it even higher.  I also baked it a little longer. 15 minutes.  It came out perfect! Will recommend this recipe

This was a great hit, even when I messed up a bit.  I intentionally used 1/2 cup cornstarch and Even so, it had a great flavor, but I WILL add it next time!   Thanks for a super recipe.

Good recipe! I used my Meyers Lemons that I picked from my tree. I also used a Homemade Graham Cracker Crust. I sprinkled some lemon zest on the Meringue after taking it out of the oven!!

This recipe didn't work for me. The filling was like soup.  The ingredients were correct and it did get very thick but when I took it off the heat and added the lemon juice and butter it went very runny again.

The filling turns out as pure liquid even after being baked a few extra minutes. Not to mention it makes enough for two pies.

I have never made a lemon meringue pie before but it is my favourite to eat so I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. I made it as directed, the only adjustment was rather than 1.5 cups of water I used 1 cup of water and 1/2 cup of milk. 
I was a bit nervous about how it would turn out because I had never made meringue or lemon curd before but it ended up being delicious! My dad even said it was the best lemon pie he had ever tasted. Just the perfect amount of sweetness with a really nice lemony flavour without being too sour. Will definitely be making this pie again!!

I followed the recipe exactly and it wasnt good.And then no matter how much I cooked it, added cornstarch, and stirred the curd, it just wouldn't thicken! It was so runny and didn't even taste so good. I see that many people had luck with this recipe but my personal experience was terrible. Would never use this again.

Easy to make used some of the tips as I like a big pie-- never lasts long enough in our house.  I used 3 lemons for the juice and the rind.  I did add extra cornstarch 1/2tbs to hot liquid and thickened in no time.  With my 3lemons I yielded over 3/4 juice but found no issues with that.  For merginue don't do it first as someone suggested as mine did not have the bounce it once had by the time lemon was done.  I did 1/2 tsp cream of tartar and 1/2 tsp vanilla to the merginue.  In the end it all worked out and was tasty!

It was good but i had to bring the amount of cornstarch up to 5 tablespoons to get the right consistency. It was alittle to strong with lemon flavor to me put all in all it was a good pie.

I've made this pie twice and everyone really liked it. The second time I left out the flour and used 4tabs. Cornstarch instead. And please.....use real sugar!  Very good pie

Lots of compliments on this recipe.  This is the first lemon meringue I have attempted, and I found this recipe to be simple and easy!  I love the natural lemon flavor.  I used instant clearjel and didn't have a runny pie.  It also greatly reduced the cooking time.

I substituted powdered Xyla and powdered Monkfruit (each on separate occasions) for the Sugar in the filling 1 cup for 1 cup.. turned out WONDERFUL!!! this recipe is a Keeper!...  next time I make it I will substitute  the Corn Starch for Tapioca Starch (Flour) and see how that works..  because I make this crust less it will bring the net carb down to 3.4 per slice.. pretty good to switch it to a Keto Dessert.

Yum! I didn't use as much sugar as called for, and also added about 1 tsp of turmeric to the filling. It was delicious! I also added lemon juice to the meringue, which added a nice extra lemony touch!

Fantastic on the first try. I changed the serving size to 12 and it was perfect for my deep-dish pie plate. I whipped the meringue VERY stiff and the curd came out perfectly, as well.

First time ever making a Lemon Meringue Pie. Glad I choose this recipe. The lemon curd has great flavor and is spot on. The meringue came out perfect. The human error on my part was the lemon curd didn't settle and I know it is because I did something wrong. But it was good to eat anyway. Being the first time here, I am positive I will figure it out, meanwhile thank you for sharing and I will be making this again. Oh by the way.. I made this into 6 individual pies using a jumbo muffin tin. What fun I had making these. Whipping up the meringue I was in there laughing my head off watching it come to peeks. Thank you Emilie S.
Update: The filling actually got firmer after having it in the refrigerator a few hours. So I guess all really went well. Will be making these again.

I have been baking since I was allowed to use the oven but I've never made lemon meringue pie...it just seemed so intimidating. I tried this recipe and it turned out perfectly. I still can't believe I actually made it. I loved the flavor and the meringue. I used shortbread crust and thought it complimented the filling nicely. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is amazing! I got a sample of All Recipes magazine and found it in there. When I was flipping through it it made me crave something lemony. I am so glad I tried it. It is an awesome summer snack by the way

Everything lemon meringue pie should be: tart, smooth, and utterly addictive. A word of caution: don't make this alone. You might eat the whole pie yourself.

Ok, so I've made this pie before and its wonderful however, I keep forgetting to double the curd its just not enough to fill a decent pie.  Also I use another small lemon, zest and juice and 1 extra tbsp of cornstarch.

This indeed is a great recipe!! Perfect Taste :) it looked perfect too until I took it out from oven. After about 5 minutes lemon filling became watery. I followed the recipe exactly so do not know where I went wrong...
Again, taste was perfect but need guidance to achieve perfection in texture

This was my first time doing a lemon meringue pie and was really happy except that the meringue did not stick to the lemon filling. 
Next time, I will start by doing my meringue first ( took me 10 min and using icing sugar that you add gradually re : Jaimie Oliver) so that I would add it to the lemon filling that is hot.
2 lemons = 1/2 cup of juice .
I let it sit for 1 hour  and then refrigerate for more than 3 hours Not covered. 
The taste was perfect ! Thank you for this amazing recipe!

The pie came out too watery.  Do I use jumbo lemons or regular? I think maybe there is too much lemon juice, but I had no way of knowing since the recipe does not say. Cannot cook the water out of it.

Wow, this pie is yummy!  I have never tried to make a lemon meringue from scratch and with this recipe it was so easy! I made a crust from scratch, as well as the rest of the pie. I don't like my filling too sweet so I added a little extra lemon zest and it was the perfect tartness. I waited about 45 minutes to put it in the fridge to chill it and it is still warm after about 1 hour. It just needs a while to chill. Also, because it's warm it's still runny. I hope this will firm up as it chills. Overall, this is a wonderful lemon meringue recipe and I will continue to make this recipe! Thank you, Emilie S.

I made this pie on the eve of our Thanksgiving about 3 weeks ago. I did everything to the letter and gingerly slid my meringue topped delight into the oven and 5 minutes later the power went out. About 2 hours later the electricity was restored and the pie was still great! Thank you Emilie and GMa for a foolproof recipe!

Made this for my MIL since it's her favorite.  It turned out fabulously!  I also added about a quarter tsp of vanilla to the curd, but that's the only change from the original recipe I made and it was really good.  I did take the suggestion and let it cool for about an hour after baking and then refrigerate for about 3 hours after cooling.  There was no pie left by the end of the evening!

wow, i never made lemon meringue pie before, it turned out awesome, the only thing i did do differently with the meringue, i added 1/4 tsp cream of tarter and 1/2 tsp vanilla to the egg whites before I whisked the egg whites. The meringue whipped up perfectly and tasty! and browned in the oven in 10 minutes. My husband says.. and your not taking this to work - -> right? I said---RIGHT. This was for Him..

I made the pie exactly according to the instructions. I know that with lemon meringue pie, you have to be really exact with all your measurements, other wise something will go wrong - guaranteed. 

It turned out great, and the filling wasn't runny at all. Note: I am allergic to wheat, so I just used a rice-potato flower mixture instead of regular flower and the thickness and texture was just perfect.

wonderful lemon flavor and awesome meringue! my only complaint is there seems to be more meringue than lemon filling but that's a minor problem. I followed some suggestions. . . Using 1/2 cup of lemon juice and only 1 cup of water. Otherwise the recipe is spot on.

The taste is the best I have ever made.  Unfortunately the lemon filling did not set and ran in soft clumps when it was cut.  I don't know what I did wrong.  I followed the recipe measuring everything carefully.  If anyone else has experienced this problem and solved it I would appreciate knowing because the meringue and filling were 10 out of 10 for flavour.

This is my very first time making a lemon meringue pie. I love this recipe.  I tripled the ingredients and made three pies.  The only thing I did differently was add cream of tarter to the whipped egg whites, upon the suggestion from another review. I had to cook them for 20 minutes instead of 10 for them to brown. Try this recipe.

I made this for my daughter's birthday and it was a big hit (especially from my husband).  Very lemony and easy to make. I used a Pillsbury refrigerated piecrust as I do for all my pies anymore; they are every bit as good as made-from-scratch.

had much trouble with runny meringue, solved it by having meringue ready once filling went into the shell then quickly into the oven. The hot filling cooks the bottom of the meringue a bit while it cooks from the top down to keep everything set and wonderful. This is my go to crowd-pleaser.

Simply amazing how perfectly this recipe came together. It was my first attempt ever at making any sort of meringue and I was a bit terrified but won't be from now on! I did what others suggested, changed the serving size to 12 and added cream of tartar to the egg whites. I also blind baked a home made pie crust (believe it's called Flaky Pie Crust) and assembled everything while it still warm, let it sit at room temp for 1 hour, then in the fridge. I made it the night before and it was great. Thank you so much for this DELICIOUS recipe that my family all enjoyed for Thanksgiving desert.

Great recipe, came out really nice first time out. Filling is a bit sweet for me, I like that really sharp taste that some French chefs use when they make a lemon tart. So next time I'll try 1/2 cup of sugar and more lemons to tweak it.

This recipe is excellent! I wouldn't change a thing... LOVED it!!! For anyone who likes store bought pies, this is exactly the same just better! I have to admit, it felt really good to eat something made from real lemons, as opposed to "simulated flavour."  My family can't wait for the next pie!

I had never made a lemon meringue pie before, and this turned out fantastic. I have a deep-dish pie, so when I made it again (three days later), I increased the filling by half (i.e., 3 lemons, 2.25 cups water, 6 eggs, etc.). It was a huge hit. Other than making 50% more filling and merinque, I didn't alter the recipe at all. You don't need Meyer lemons, lemon oil, etc etc for this.

Speechless. Pie was gone by morning! I only thing I did different was use milk in replace of water (though now it probably wasn't unnecessary). Also doubled the filling and made extra meringue. Result was this very impressive, beautiful masterpiece. I do agree, it is important to use hot custard, warm crust, so have meringue ready to go once filling is done. Don't stop stirring while filling is cooking. Fabulous!

The only reason I didn't rate it at 5 stars was because I added about a tablespoon more lemon juice.  Other than that, I LOVE this recipe :)

I Love this recipe! It tasted like my Grandmothers and made everyone in the family asking for more.  I made the meringue with 4 egg whites and added vanilla and cream of tarter, just because it's MY favorite part.

Great recipe!! I, like many of the other reviewers, chose to make this with lemon juice and lemon extract instead of fresh lemons and it came out great! I would suggest doubling the lemon filling, especially since it was so good.

FANTASTIC!  Used more lemon juice and less water, added 1/2 tsp tartar and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract to the meringue.  Turned out perfectly!  Will definitely make again.

My first time making lemon meringue pie ever so I was so amazed at how SIMPLE yet delicious this recipe was!  It was a little too sweet for our tastes, so next time I'll go lighter on the sugar and maybe use the juice and zest of half a lemon more.  Other than that, it's great!  Thanks for sharing!!!

Great recipe-- be sure not to get any egg yolks into your egg whites!! The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the consistency is still (I've made this several times) a little runny (not bad at all but I'd like to see it completely firm)...could be a preparing/baking/cooling error on my part. And I still love it!

I followed other people' suggestions and used 2/3 milk, 1/3 water for the liquid. The pie was delicious. My only suggestion is that it should be made the day before you want to eat it. On the second day, the texture and taste was so much better. Lovely recipe!

I made my own pie crust. (2 cups of flour, 2/3 cup of non-hydrogenated margarine, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/8 cup of water.)
This was my first time making a lemon meringue pie. It was fairly easy, I didn't have very good luck with the meringue the first time, so I started over. The second time went perfectly!
The pie was great! This recipe is a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

I really liked this pie, and so did my daughter & her boyfriend. My husband did not. He doesn't like custard. Bottom line: if you like custard than you will enjoy the pie, but if you do not than use another recipe.

We made this for my father-in-law's 86th birthday party as per his request for a lemon pie.  My hubby had to do most of the work due to my new shoulder and he hasn't done any baking before.  With my direction and his willingness to follow directions to the letter, this pie turned out absolutely perfect.  Six other adults agreed along with a 4 year old little guy who said it was, "the best."

I think some reviewers did not realize that lemon merengue is not the same as a lemon chiffon pie. This should make a layer of jelly-like lemon filling with a sweet fluffy topping of meringue (like the picture). I would not change it or add milk (!!!).

I've been making this lemon pie for a local restaurant six weeks now, along with a few other cream pies.  This one sells the fastest!  Only problem I have is sometimes my meringue beads and I don't know what I do any different when it doesn't bead!  With that said it's an easy recipe and delicious.

My first attempt at making a homemade lemon meringue pie and it came out most excellent. This is an excellent and easy recipe and is most delicious. Be careful on bringing liquid to a boil. You must do it slowly.

This was absolutely delicious.  My grandmother used to make this pie from scratch.  My daughter made this on Sunday and it didn't take long to disappear.  My nephew's girlfriend, who is a pastry chef, asked if my daughter made it and when I said yes, she made a "threatened" face.  HAHA.  Thanks for the recipe.

Really great - simple, too.  This will be my first allrecipe with with no tweaks what so ever.  This has a perfect balance of sweet and tart and enough meringue to supply an old time pie fight.  Taste is subjective, but this should please 95% of the foodies out there.

This is your traditional lemon meringue and exactly what I was looking for. For fun though.. I was out of graham crackers and to lazy to make pie crust  lol so i crushed honey nut cheerios for the crust. Surprisingly pretty good if you want a twist.

This was the first time that I've made lemon meringue pie and it turned out beautiful! I made it exactly as the recipe suggested and I wouldn't change a thing! The bottom layer didn't ooze at all and did I mention that I whisked the toP layer by hand? I actually suggest whisking the eggs by hand, I don't use mixers at all and the peaks turned out great!

I haven't tried this yet as it's in my fridge setting up (though I did taste the filling and meringue before putting it together and both tasted great!!!!!  I have a couple of issues already though.......I added nearly a cup of lemon juice fresh squeezed with some lemon zest, but had to add extra juice as it didn't quite have the zing I was looking for........  Secondly, though it's thick, it's still quite wobbly, so not sure if it's going to set up or be a little too thin yet, time will tell......Lastly, the Meringue........tastes great!!!!!!! However, I spread on, and sealed it (on a 9" pie it's a fairly thin layer...if IU would have known I would've doubled as I love my meringue..)however after I put it in the fridge, it started cracking around one edge, and is pulling back a bit from the edge of the pie.........Any thoughts???

Four stars because we haven't actually cut the pie yet, but I did taste the filling and it was yummy.  I might add a bit of lemon extract.  I used frozen lemon juice and made 1 1/2 times the recipe.  
I think it looks lovely as it cools on the counter for an hour before it goes in the fridge.
I think Hubby will like this one!

I normally do not like lemon pie but decided to make it for my husband because he loves lemon meringue and he loved it. i did add an extra tbsp of cornstarch to make sure it would be thick enough and it turned out great, will definitely be making again.

Great recipe except the filling uses too many eggs. My filling turned out to be liquidy but still tastes like it should. Maybe I just made a boo-boo, ah well.

This is a winner. full stop. You do not need another lemon meringue recipe. Ever. It's easy to follow, I did everything step by step... and it got raves. I also really heavily whisked the curd by hand while cooking and it was very smooth and thick. A GREAT recipe!

Fantastic recipe.  I have made this multiple times and it is without a doubt always a hit.  I am always asked for the recipe which I gladly print out for guest.  I have made this non-dairy by using margarine instead of butter and it is just as good.

I recently made this for my mother's birthday and it was a hit!  I had never made a lemon meringue pie before and this turned out great!  This is a delicious recipe that I will be making frequently and I think that it will be my mom's new birthday treat each year.

First time I had made lemon meringue pie and I used this recipe. The filing and the meringue turned out really well. There is just right amount of lemony taste but I did find the lemon filing a bit to sweet for my liking, however very good recipe.

This was my very first attempt at Lemon Meringue Pie, and it turned out just lovely. 
I used the juice of 4 large lemons for extra lemony flavor, and the curd came out perfect. Unfortunately, my meringue 'beaded' after 3 hours in the fridge, but that might have happened due to my beginner's mistake of not letting the egg whites get frothy before adding the sugar and possibly adding too much. 
Anyway, my friends LOVED IT and didn't even offer to send any back home with us. The mark of a truly enjoyed dessert! :) 
The video helped tremendously as well - Thanks Emilie!

This was my first attempt at a lemon meringue pie and it was awesome and relatively easy.

I followed other comments and made 1 1/2 times the filling and meringue.  I also used 2% milk instead of water.  

My only comment is that I had about 3/4 cup of lemon juice (about 3 large lemons) - next time I will use more lemon juice for a stronger lemon flavor.

I've mad this pie twice now and it was a hit each time! The only changes I made was to replace the water with milk, and I left out the lemon zest. I used two jumbo lemons which gave a good 3/4cp - 1cp of lemon juice. Delicious!

The recipe needs to say:
Put lemon mixture into a cooled crust and the meringue would not set up with only 6 T of sugar, I had to add 9 T total before I got the peaks

This turned out wonderfully, especially for my first try at a meringue pie. I did use the juice from 3 large lemons and no zest at all. I also added 1/4 tsp cream of tartar to the meringue as well as a splash of vanilla. It looked like way too much meringue but turned out perfect and everyone at our Memorial day barbeque loved it. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the only lemon meringue pie I have ever used, it's really easy to make and is the perfect balance between sweet/sour. I followed the measurements of everything to a tee, except in place of the water I used milk to give it a more creamy flavour. I didn't have fresh lemons on hand so I used 1/2 cup of lemon juice. If you are using a deep dish pie plate, I would suggest doubling the lemon filling as my pie this time was a bit thinner than I like, but it still tastes great!

This was my first attempt at making a Lemon Meringue Pie! It was VERY easy, and it has the PERFECT taste! It was so successful with the family, that I have to make another one today! LOL! Thanks for this AWESOME recipe!!! If I could rate it more than 5 stars it would get 100! :)

I took the advice of letting the lemon filling get really, really thick, and I say that it was too thick.  If I make this again, I won't leave it on the stove too long.  My pie ended up with yellow drops on top of the meringue.  Perhaps it didn't cook long enough or the filling cooled off too much before meringue was put on.  Overall, good experience for first (lemon) meringue pie.

I have never made a Lemon Meringe before. This was so good! I kept with the recipe. Helpful hints are to make sure you seal all edges with the meringue and to meringue it when it is still hot so the it helps cook the meringue.  I also kept it in the over for about an extra 30 minutes with the oven OFF as another reveiwer suggested (1 hour)..Perfect!!!! If this does not come our right for you, you did something wrong.

I made this pie by using CARTHECOOK's suggestions, minus the parts about the lemon extract instead of the zest. Thanks to these, it turned out great! I have tried making lemon meringue pies before, and they have always been runny and disappointing. My only mistake is that I did not let the lemon filling and crust cool enough before spreading my meringue on top. When I removed the finished product from the fridge there was a layer of liquid between the filling and the meringue. But other than that it was perfect, and probably the most delicious lemon meringue pie I have ever eaten! :)

Unfortunately, my kids loved this pie.  I was really looking forward to keeping this all to myself.  It was that good.  I think the taste was spot on.  You could double the filling if you want more to your pie.  I did add 2 more egg whites to the meringue for extra umph.  I will make this again.  I have avoided making it over the years thinking it had to be too involved but this was very simple and oh so tasty.  Loving it.  One of my kids even asked if they could have a slice for breakfast the next morning.

Very easy to make, I watched the video, she said to put the meringue on while the filling was hot so it wouldn't weep. Mine weeped terrible, lost half its height. I read some reviews TO let it cool. I will try next time. I used organic lemons, and MY organic eggs, WOW what Deep yellow color.

I thought, for the most part, that this was not too bad.  What lowered my rating was the variance in lemon juice/zest that could happen.  For example, I used rather large lemons, and my pie was really heavy on the tart side--I would not have used so much lemon juice/zest as the recipe called for.  I'll look into some other lemon meringue pie recipes and see if I can find one with accurate juice/zest measurements.

Mine didn't turn out very good. The filling was so sticky, almost like glue. I probably did something wrong. I think I'll stick to Ann Landers recipe for lemon meringue pie from now on.

Tasty and easy to make.  Next time I will double the filling recipe, I prefer a fuller pie.  I used my own meringue recipe by adding the cream of tarter and vanilla.  Overall it is yummy and worthy of making again.

High rating for flavor, but I did have a problem with the filling setting up.  This could have been how I prepared it.  I made filling for 12 servings on the advice of a reviewer who said there was not enough filling for the pie.  I used Pillsbury refrigerator shell, which shrunk during baking, so I baked a second shell.  Increasing the recipe actually gave me enough filling to use in both shells, so I made one with meringue and one without.  The pie without meringue set up nicely and after cooling I placed it in the frig, adding whipped cream when serving.  Having never made meringue, I did an internet search on best methods and it came out beautifully.  Based on a review here, I placed it on the pie while hot so it would not weep or shrink.  After browning, the pie was beautiful.  However, after cooling completely, when serving the pie was somewhat runny.  It was impossible to serve a solid piece and we ended up spooning it out.  The flavor was great, but it was not the end result I'd hoped for.  I think it was a mistake to put the meringue on the pie while the filling was hot, as this was the only difference in the two pies and the other one was nice and firm.  My internet search found great tips on making meringue: Let the egg whites come to room temp before whipping. Use only a glass or metal bowl.  Use superfine sugar and add very gradually after soft peaks appear.  Spread over pie filling completely onto the edge of pie shell.    I definitely will try this recipe again

Like everyone else stated...YUM. Just tart enough, not too sweet! Used 3 medium lemons, plus zested rind of 2. NO milk...just water. PERFECT recipe...thanks a million! Also - Used a Pillsbury Deep Dish Pie Crust.

This pie had a great flavor. But the egg whites need to be doubled so the meringue is higher. Not the best lemon meringue pie I've had but everyone enjoyed it.

So I'm not a big fan of meringue pies, but I do LOVE lemon cream pies.  I used this recipe for the lemon portion, and just topped it off with fresh whipped cream, and it was AWESOME!!!!  Perfect consistency and taste!  I had to use lemon juice (about 3/4 cup) since I didn't have fresh lemons, and I also put some yellow food coloring to make it more appealing.  This will be my standard recipe for lemon pies/tarts from now on.  Loved it!  :)

This was almost like the lemon merinue pie recipe that my mom used to make and I lost the recipe that she gave me.  One thing that she use to do was add 3 or 4 drops of yellow food coloring to the filling when it was done cooking and that really makes it look wonderful.  Try it next time and see.

The meringue tunred out perfect even on my first try, but I was not able to get the filling to set. After reading other lemon pie recipes I determined that the filling should be chilled for several hours prior to baking with the meringue.

My first lmp & it turned out wonderfully. Made it for a b-day celebration & it was well liked. I didn't change anything, but I wondered if cream of tarter was needed for the meringue, though I didn't have any problems w/o it. thanks to emilie's grandma

My daughter really made this I just helped her in the kitchen for a change. We are both lemon meringue pie fanatics and this was really worth the effort.  Did take some time to thicken but other than that all went well. Did not last long in the fridge.

This turned out wonderful and was the favorite dessert!  Next time I will definitely follow others advice on putting the meringue on immediately.  I will also try the milk to see if I like it even more.  I will definitely make this again and again!

Great recipe! I followed previous reviewers tips and used milk in place of water and 2 tsp lemon extract in place of zest.Make sure to add meringue to filling when hot and it will turn out perfect!

I have been CRAVING lemon meringue pie!!  So yesterday I got up off my lazy behind and made this. Very simple to put together and it was so tasty. I thought it needed more lemon but the old man said he thought it was perfect. I was unaware that he'd been to culinary school..lol...anyway, it was good!! It was light and not heavy..could have eaten the whole thing myself!!  Looking forward to another slice this evening.

Delicious!!  This was my first time making Lemon Meringue and it turned out great!  I did substitute milk for the water - just because I like it creamier - other than that followed instructions to a T

I replaced the sugar with splenda.  My diabetic husband rated this pie a 5.  Everything else was followed to a "T" and the pie had a very strong lemon taste.  It was more creamy than the traditional lemon pie made with the box filling.  The lemon zest added a nice texture and taste.  The meringue was the best I've ever made.  It whipped up great and really held it's form.

This was a really easy recipe to use.  I haven't made a lemon meringue for somewhere in the neighborhood of a decade, but I had no problems! At first I was leery about the meringue - only four eggs?  But properly brought to room temperature it made PLENTY!  :D This is a special treat for my dad for Father's Day, and I can't wait to see his face!

Although I've been baking pies for years, lemon meringue was one I hadn't tried.  All I can say is...WOW...this recipe is perfect!  I've made this twice and my family gobbles it up!  I prefer tarter lemon flavor, so increased the lemons & zest to 3.  This pie is refreshing and light.  My mother confirmed that this IS just like Grandma used to make ... and I can sure see why.  This is forever in my recipe book.  Thank you!

I loved this pie!!  I read most of the reviews, and followed the instructions carefully, as this was my first lemon meringue pie.  I did boil the custard for 15 mins. and thought is was not thick enough.  I then added som more cornstarch, which I really did not need!  The custard thickens nicely once removed from heat...wish I knew that before!!  Did not use this meringue, and made my own crust, so the 5 stars is only for the lemon custard...Thanks for a great post!

This was a good pie, but it wasn't the greatest.  The meringue part did taste wonderful, but the lemon center wasn't the best.

I loved this recipe, I followed a combination of tips that others have left and I came out with a perfect pie! It looked so pretty I almost didnt want to eat it. And it tasted fantastic. Im not a very skilled baker, but I followed the directions carefully and I loved the results!

This was my first lemon meringue pie and it turned out great! Some tips: make the meringue before the pie filling so that when the pie filling is finished you can put the meringue on it and it will cook the bottom. I used an extra 1/2 tbs. of cornstarch for the filling to make it thicker. On the meringue, let the egg whites get room temp and add 1/4 tsp. of cream of tartar. I also had to bake it a little longer to get the meringue the nice golden brown. Very nice results!

Absoltely delicious.  Although I'm an avid baker I've never made a meringue pie.  This came out beautiful.  I made sure to have the meringue ready so as soon as I put the filing in the crust I placed the meringue on immediately then put it in the oven.  I didn't change a thing!!

This turned out good. However, I would not use the milk in place of the water. I did this thinking "creamy would be good" but it didn't turn out as I had hoped. I would stick with the recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I was very unimpressed with this pie recipe. It had such great reviews, so I decided to make it instead of my usual lemon pie recipe that always comes out perfectly. I made two of them to serve some company we had in the evening. The only change I made was to use bottled lemon juice (real lemon) instead of fresh, because I had no fresh lemons. I skipped the zest as well for that reason. I made it exactly as written, and the filling was really runny, even though I cooked it for a very long time. I baked it as written, thinking that perhaps it would firm up a bit in the oven, but it was still really liquid after I baked it.  I ended up having to refrigerate it overnight before it thickened up enough to serve. I had to make some cookies up really quickly to serve to our guests, which didn't make me very happy. My other pie recipe firms up enough that it doesn't even have to be refrigerated. And even after it firmed up, it had liquid that pooled under each slice, not the usual "weeping" from the meringue, but something I'd never experienced before. Altogether, I was not impressed with this recipe, and I won't be making it again.

I foolishly used a graham cracker crust for this because it wasn't until after I made it that I remembered, "Oh yeah! The regular crusts are in the freezer aisle, not the baking aisle!" Aside from that little faux pas, I was very pleased with the results. Even though the pie weeped a little, everyone thought it was super tasty!

I have made this twice and love this recipe.  My advice for anyone new to making a meringue would be to let the eggs get to room temperature and to beat them in a copper or metal bowl.  Thanks for the recipe.

Really good! I have never made a pie before, but my husband wanted this for Thanksgiving so I attempted it. The only problem I had was with the meringue....I think I cooked it too long because it did have the little sugar beads on top....but it kind of looked pretty :) Everybody was impressed!

I've read a lot of reviews by folks who've tweaked the recipe a bit, but as I'm a lemon meringue pie newby, I thought I'd follow the recipe as it was posted.  Personally, I don't think it needs tweaking at all - it's simply perfect just the way it is.  I've made 3 pies now.  The first two disappeared shortly after making them, and the third is cooling as I type this.  I suspect I'll be making my 4th pie in a day or two.  Yum yum!

This is so yummy!  I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 water, makes it a little creamier.  Used 6 egg whites for the meringue, same amount of sugar and added a tsp of vanilla.  I take about 1/4 of the lemon zest and sprinkle it on top.

This is my husband's very favorite pie ever! I made a few revisions, of course. Instead of fresh lemon juice, I used 6 tablespoons of store-bought lemon juice and it comes out PERFECTLY...also, follow the advice and make the meringue and refrigerate it BEFORE cooking the custard, it will be a huge help to you! This pie is fantastic, I have made it several times and it always comes out great. Thanks Emilie :)

The flavor was spot on for this pie. However, mine didn't turn out right. I had never made a meringue before, so for me the instructions were not detailed enough. I wasn't sure how long to boil the  filling for. But, in the end, the pie was runny and soggy.  So, I'm not sure if i cooked it too long or not long enough ? Also, I used a hand mixer for the egg whites, and I seriously beat it for at least twenty minutes. I'm going to have to throw it out. Too bad bc I can tell it's a tasty pie.

I used my favorite crust recipe ( it has ice cold vodka to counterbalance the toughening effects of water) and added the juice from one more lemon (I have a lemon tree that is still covered with lemons), and the results were just delicious.  Thanks for the recipe. I lessened the amount of water by the amount of extra lemon juice.

I have being making lemon meringue pies for about 40 years, using Jello brand pudding.  When I found this recipe about a year ago, I stopped using commercial mix and have been making this pie from this  scratch recipe ever since.  It is absolutely fabulous!

I followed this recipe exactly and our pie was fantastic!  It's not necessary to "tweak" this recipe at all and the meringue recipe is just fine as is. The lemon filling set-up perfectly.  This will be the only lemon meringue pie recipe I will use from now on.  I did watch the video for making a lemon meringue pie before attempting mine and I found that it helped.  She also happened to use this recipe.

Very, very good recipe. Used a crust from a vinegar pie recipe, and paired extraordinarily well. Will probably use this again. Great lemon curd to this.

I made 2 changes ONLY because I didn't have what was called for. I used 1/2 C lemon juice and about a tsp of dried lemon peel (spice cabinet)...and 2 T shortening instead of butter (was out)  It was still delicious and perfect!

great recipe. I didn't have a pie crust handy so I used gram cracker, same idea as a cheesecake crust and it was delish. I had two large sized lemons and I thought that the juice combined with the water would be too much but it was perfect.  Will definitely use this reciped again.

I followed Carthecook's recommendations for this recipe and got rave reviews when I brought it to an Easter dinner. I believe the "best lemon meringue pie ever" words were mentioned in there somewhere. I'm not a huge fan of lemon desserts myself but I must say that this was delicious and I will definitely add it to my favorites!

This recipe is definitely not for people who are not familier with meringue pies. The filling came out watery, and the meringue was sticky. I put the pie in the refrigerator one hour after it was done and that didn't help. Will not be making this recipe again.

This recipe is easy to follow and makes the whole pie making nice. But next time I will omit the zest because eating this pie leaves an aftertaste like you actually ate the lemon rind. I even added a bit more sugar and that did not  help, I use equal amounts of cornstarch and flour and it did wonderfully for the perfect filing. Next pie will not have zest and I'll use 3/4 cup lemon juice (2 lemons) and 3/4 cup water.

The filling was great and I will use it again since it was a very easy custard.  I replaced the water with milk.  Came out great.  The meringue weeped all over the pie and made it inedible.. The instructions for the pie were terrible.

My Dad has not had a truly homemade Lemon Meringue pie since childhood from an Aunt who made this favorite pie of his. I have never made one from scratch. I decided to make him one this Christmas and chose this recipe because of all the great reviews. Thank you to all who rated this pie making it an easy choice and thank you to the author of this recipe because it truly was fantastic! I did not change a thing and it came out perfect and made his day.

I've never really like lemon meringue pie, but this was great. I did add the juice of another half a lemon and am glad I did- the tart/sweet ratio is just right that way. The texture was great, flavor was wonderful, I'll definitely be making this again.

I used the Meringue II recipe from this site, and it turned out perfectly.

I made this again with oranges (cause I ran out of lemons, so I went with the other citrus fruit I had, since limes are too small to zest, LOL). Next time I will prob remove the zest, biting into zest in every bite was nasty

Great recipe. Just remember to let it set for a while before cutting. I did add one more lemon for the juice, not the zest. It was nice but would have worked out just fine with only 2 lemons.

I LOVE this pie. I don't really like lemon flavored things so I switched it up with oranges. Instead of juicing and zesting two lemons I used 2 medium sized oranges. I also used 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar in the meringue. All in all this meringue pie came out nearly perfect.

My husband and I have been hungry for a good Lemon Meringue Pie for some time but I kept putting off baking it because of failed attempts in the past. When I saw this recipe it sounded like the way my Mother and my Grandmother made theirs.
With Autumn and Winter around the corner and heartier pies being thought of I decided today is the day to try this recipe and I am so glad I did.  My lemons were small and I needed 5 of them to get the juice for 1/2 cup but other than that the recipe was easy to follow and put togeather.  I did follow suggestions from reviews such as making the meringue first so that it would be ready to put on the curd as soon as it was in the pie shell. The pie was delicious. The curt had just the right tartness for a citrus pie.  I did add 1/4 teaspoon cream of tarter to the egg whites along with 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  This might have been a mistake. The egg whites were very stiff, but after being in the oven 20 minutes I removed it as it was a beautiful brown. I followed other suggestions and left it out for 1 hour and then put the pie in the refrigerator where it stayed for five hours and we could not wait the suggested six hours.
The meringue did not pull away from the shell but did sink somewhat and was weepy. It certainly did not ruin the taste of the pie but I am wondering why this happened.  Thank You for sharing your Grandma's Lemon Meringue Pie Recipe. I will keep this recipe and it will be used without fear of failure many times.

My son requested Lemon Meringue Pie for his 8th birthday this year.  Didn't read reviews/comments so made it as directed.  Flavor was good (he gave it 2 thumbs up).  My only complaints were that the filling seemed sparse in the 9" pie crust and that there was a layer of liquid when we cut into the pie.  I might read some of the tips and make a few alterations next time.  Overall, though, this was a good recipe.

Perfect. Followed the recipe to a tee, except that I added extra sugar while whipping the egg whites, because I thought that would help firm it faster (it didn't). The result of this blunder were cute little caramelized beads of sugar on top of the meringue. There was some liquid between the layers, but nothing that can't be drained by tipping the pie over a sink! A bit of work with the topping, but delish and impressive for guests!

The flavor was really good! I used Meringue II, according to the other suggestions and the meringue was perfect. The only issue I had with the pie was the filling consistancy. It was pretty thick, and it made less that I thought it would. I'm used to a lighter filling in my LMP. Otherwise, the flavor was amazing and I got great reviews from the family.

This was AMAZING!!!  The only (very minor) change I made was to add 1 tsp of lemon juice and zest to the meringue after whipping it, but otherwise the recipe was perfect!  My meringue didn't get 'hard' at all and was very flat (I've heard meringue is hard to get right, I'll have to try again) but it was still DELICIOUS!  Definitely a keeper!!

Excellent. I used a combination of fresh and bottled lemon juice with fresh grated lemon peel. Pie was creamy & loved by all. I did use Meringue II recipe posted. That too was perfect. NO WEEPING!!!

This pie was wonderful!! I actually made Mini pies (made in muffin pans) for a potluck dinner. To fill 24 mini pies I had to change the serving to 10, plus I needed a little extra meringue. I used 1/2C of bottled lemon juice and the filling was very lemony but not overly so. The meringue was not as sweet as I have made before, but still tasted great! I let the filling cool for about 45mins - 1hr before topping with the meringue and made sure I sealed it to the crust ( I didn't have any problems with weeping). I will definately make this again!! I had heaps of rave reviews!

I left out the butter and the taste and texture is perfect, especially the next day.  I gave it four stars b/c it did not yield very much filling.  It barely came up an inch into the pie pan! ?!  I guess I'll just double it next time.  Also, I'm not sure why the description of the recipe mentions lemon rind but the recipe itself calls for lemon zest.  Of course you use zest, but I think some people may be using the rind or pithy white part - don't do this!  it'll be bitter.  You want to scrape the lemon to just remove the colored part and stop as soon as you see white.

We had problems with coarse sugar and humidity causing shrinking, beading, and weeping, but that's not the recipe's fault.  The filling was nice and tart. We all loved it.

This was my first pie made ever, and it turned out good.  I did end up with droplets on the meringue which I now know is from over cooking the pie.  I should have made little peaks on top of the pie so that the tips would brown by the end of the 10 minutes, but instead I spead it smooth all over and it took longer for it to brown.  I also didn't add any zest because lemon peel doesn't sound good to me.  This was a very yummy pie and I will make again. Thanks Grandma!

YUM. I honestly had no problems with this recipe, although I did have to add the juice of one extra lemon (3 total). The filling started to thicken very quickly, so the recipe's directions to "cook until thick" weren't very helpful. Just cook it until you're ready to pour it in the shell. It was delicious.

This is a phenomenal recipe. The filling firmed up very nicely. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar to my meringue to stabilize the egg whites (I never make meringue without it). My pie was a little weepy, but it was snowing pretty bad. But, all in all, a great recipe.

To be fair I didn't follow this recipe.  I wish I had. I did as previous posters said and substituted milk for the water and added an extra 1/2 tsp. of cornstarch.  I juiced three lemons and used lemon extra instead of lemon rind.  The result was a firm, bland pie that resembled vanilla.  I threw the last peice out and felt terrible for serving it to my company.

Without a doubt the best lemon meringue pie I have ever had.  I juiced two large lemons which worked out to 4 oz of juice and used the rind from only 1/2 lemon and it was tart and zesty but still sweet enough to be delicious!

This was a very easy to follow, and delicious recipe.  I prepared it for a pot-luck at work, and it was a hit.  Very nice lemon flavor, and good texture to filling.  For the meringue I used powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar......gives it a nice sheen, and it doesn't sweat too much when it's in the fridge and also the peaks seem to brown nicer...oh, and I also added a couple drops of vanilla to meringue....(it's a habit).  Overall.........KUDO'S FOR THIS PIE!!!

I followed the recipe with the exception of these changes: juiced 3 lemons instead of 2, but only zested one and used half and half instead of water.  It came out AMAZING!  I will definitely make this again :)

Pretty good as lemon meringue pies go - it thickened nicely, but I had trouble with the meringue pulling away from the side of the pan. If you like a somewhat tart pie, you may want to substitute about 1/3 c. of the water with lemon juice. Just don't do more than that (as I did) or you'll really pucker tongues. Add 1/2 tsp. cream of tartar and 1 tsp. vanilla to the meringue.

I got a ton of complements on this pie when I made it for father's day.  I don't like eating pieces of lemon zest, so after zesting, I chopped it up pretty fine and everyone told me that they didn't get chunks of lemon zest.  I didn't get the sealing the work.  Although I did the meringue as the filling was cooking, I guess I still waited too long before pouring it on top.  Will try to do it when it's even hotter next time.

This was my first lemon meringue pie. I was pleasantly surprised that the lemon filling was not too sweet or artificial tasting, as has been my experience with most lemon meringue pies I have tasted in the past. Try it for an impressive-looking, easy-to-make dessert! I used the Easy Pie Crust recipe on this site, and it was fantastic! I found both recipes together to be so easy, and so fast, especially for a dessert that looks like you spent all day in the kitchen to make!

I used a different meringue recipe like every one else suggested, but it still didn't work out. Plus, 4 egg yolks were not good in the custard. 3 would have been better because the egg flavor was owerpowering. And the bottom was soggy! I just don't think meringue pies are for me though, I've tried a coconut meringue pie from a bakery and disliked that one as well.

This pie was delicious! I followed the advice of some of the others. I made the meringue first and added 1/2 tsp. of cream of tartar and 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract. For the filling I replaced the water with milk and added another 1/4 cup of sugar. I strained the filling before pouring it into the crust. For the crust I used Nick Malgieri's recipe for sweet pie dough, which included ingredients such as butter, baking powder and one egg. The pie was delicious with great flavor, smooth texture, and the meringue was perfect.  I will definitely make it again, but the next time I will not add the additional 1/4 cup of sugar.

I'm not a fan of lemon meringue pie, but hubby loves it, so I made it for him. His only complaint was that, the meringue slid right off the filling part and it was weepy. He also didn't like the bits of zest in the filling. I think I'll take another reviewer's advice and strain the filling next time. Other than that, the filling tasted really good. I increased the sugar by about 1/4 c. (he likes it really sweet.)

Not a bad pie. I'd lost my Grandma's recipe so used this one. Found the filling to be a little tough and next time I'll add more lemon juice and zest.
Thanks.

I have made this several times. I do use less butter and a bit less lemon (it just tastes better that way), and recommend using more eggs for more merengue and thus a more impressive look. I serve this on a graham cracker crust.

I didn't think this recipe was special. I did everything the way I should, but the filling was too liquid and too acidy. I'd recommend using the zest of only half a lemon and the jiuce of only one instead of two.

This was realy good! I followed every thing as it was on the recipe & it came out perfect.

I have some advice if your filling is a little watery next time cook it a little longer.

This was my first attempt ever at making a lemon meringue. I followed the directions, and stirred until the fililng was "thick". I'm not sure how thick it was supposed to be upon pouring. I thought it would gel up or set to be more firm. The meringue topping turned out beautifully in the bowl and in the oven. Picture perfect, however, the lemon underneath never did "set" like I thought it would it was like lemon curd instead. How long are you supposed to stir and how thick is thick? Can anyone help?

the first 2 times I made this pie the meringue did not turn out. this time i used a five star meringue recipe that calls for cornstarch and vanilla(by far the BEST meringue I have ever had!!) I also added extra lemon juice. my family loved this pie! even my sister who doesn't like lemon goodies!!! i definitely recommend this recipe with the special yummy meringue recipe!!

This came out perfectly. I followed the suggestions of others by using milk instead of water,adding cream of tartar to the meringue, and using 1/4 of fresh lemon juice. It was not to tart according to different family members. I cooked the lemon custard until it was very thick, thicker than pudding would look. I did get the moisture droplets on the meringue once I refridgerated it. I think next time I'll wait until it completely cools until I put it in the fridge. Also the meringue did shrink afterwards. I was given the suggestion of adding some melted marshmallow cream to the meringue. I may try it. All in all a delicious recipe!

A crucial piece of information is missing from the directions which is why some people may have found the pie to be extremely runny or thought it turned out disasterously.  The first time I made it the pie was extremely runny and by a fluke I discovered the reason.  You must REFRIDGERATE the pie overnight or for several hours so that it actually firms up.  I hope this helps.

I had made this pie with a differant recipe the night before and it failed miserably. The filling was way to runny.I had to throw it away it wasnt edible.It left me discouraged, and disappointed With close attention I attempted Grandmas Lemon Meringue pie.And after reading ALL the reviews. It was better then I ever expected. Now My husband likes Lemon Meringue. Before he didn't. I made some adjustments though. I substituted milk for water and added 3/4 tsp. of Cream of Tarter to the meringue. Thanks for this recipe.With limited baking experience and supplies this pie came out perfect. I also made the Butter Flaky Pie Crust for this pie. It was delicious also found in allrecipes.

WUNDERBAR!!!!!I consider myself a pretty cook cook-but there are two items I fail at EVERY time.  Pancakes and Lemon Meringue Pie.  I get the Meringue Part right-its the Filling that gets me.  This was my fourth try at my husband's favorite dessert.  First time I made it with Jello Pie Filling-it worked but nothing to write home about.  We will not discuss the second or third try.  Fortunately, I came across this recipe.  Thank you Thank you Thank you.  Not only did it turn out great tasting, it was so beautiful I had a hard time cutting it.  Easy-tasty and gorgeous.  I used milk instead of water and I used 1/2 lemon juice and three lemons.  Perfect.  My only problem was-what I was supposed to do when I took it out of the oven.  After searching All recipes for about one half hour-I came across something similar to this pie-which instructed to leave away from draft.  No time-so I just put it on counter for 1 1/2 hours and then in the fridge for another hour.  It was slightly warm still-but OH MY GOODNESS-Heaven.  Now I am in search of the perfect pie crust....

I made this for my family last Christmas and needless to say, it was a huge hit! It's looks really impressive, too! Everyone thought i slaved for hours in the kitchen! My grandmother taught me to make the world's best meringue and I use that to top the lemon filling. My mom is a big fan of lemon meringue pie and has requested for this pie pretty often! Quick, easy, and fabulously delicious!!!

I've tried this pie twice now, and it's still just okay. The first time, I followed the recipe to the letter, and while the pie was fine, it wasn't tart enough for me -- in fact, there wasn't much lemon flavour at all. The second time, I added the juice and zest from three lemons instead of two, which should have worked just fine, but I also made the mistake of substituting milk for the water, a suggestion made by other reviewers. I will never, ever add milk to a lemon meringue pie again. It ruined the consistency for me entirely. 
In all, this pie was easy to make, and if that's what you're looking for in a lemon meringue pie, this is the one for you. Personally, I'd rather put in the extra effort for a really smashing pie.

I cooked this pie for my Christmas Eve party and it was a big hit.  I substituted the water for milk and the result was fantastic.  The pie was creamy, with just enough sweetness and lemony flavour.  I used the 'Sweet Short Pastry' recipe (submitted by Nori Salisbury) and the combination was great.  Luckily, I didn't have the problem of the meringue pulling away from the pie, as noted by other reviewers.  Well done Emilie on a great recipe!

I made this pie for my dads birthday. I had never made a lemon meringue pie before, and it is my dad's favorite. It came out great! It was not runny at all. It was nice and thick. The only thing that did not come out so well was the pie crust. I used a store bought pie crust and it shrunk when I baked it. Will definately make again.

Never liked lemon meringue pie before until I tried this one.  I used a bottle of lemon juice (1/2 cup)instead of fresh ones but still turned out pretty tasty.

Great recipe!!  Everyone says it's the best they've ever tasted.  It is a little more time consuming than just opening a lemon pudding box, but well worth it!  I did change a few things, just to fit my liking.  I used milk instead of water for a creamier filling.  Also, when filling was cooking, I tasted it and added more sugar or lemon juice depending on the taste I was looking for.  Some people like it more tart than others.  Also, I added 1 tsp. of lemon juice to the meringue mix, just for a little added touch.  All in all, it is a great recipe.  Highly recommend it.

Followed the recipe to the tee and it is perfect!  No adjustments needed.  My husband is a huge fan and very particular about his Lemon Meringue and I was clueless how to make one from scratch...that said, this recipe past his test and it was eaten all up in one sitting.  Last, if you're having trouble with pooling from the meringue topping, you need to let it all cool off to room temp then put in fridge to get cold.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a huge hit, can be difficult to tell when the lemon mixture is totally done (can have some added liquid) sometimes I popped the meringue in the broiler YOU CAN NOT TAKE YOUR EYES OFF OF IT

Recipe was easy to follow and came out exactly as they said it would.  I have not yet tasted the pie all together but both components were delicious when I accidentally (or on purpose) licked the spatula...four times. I added about for fresh basil leaves to the lemon filling and strained them out at the end. I like my pie like I live my men....fresh and tart with just a little bit of spice. Enjoy the pie folks. I’m entertaining tomorrow so I’ll let you know if it’s a hit. Actually I don’t know any of you so I probably won’t. But like figuratively it’s a nice thought.  Literally if you show up at my house I’m calling the police.  Fat kids unite y’all!

This recipe is great with a few important changes. As said by another reviewer, change the serving size to 12 and use 3 lemons to get enough curd to actually fill a pie shell enough. I used 1/2 cup juice and the zest from 2 lemons.  Be sure to pre bake your pie crust, and put meringue on hot curd.

I’ve made this twice.  For what it’s worth I’m a guy who doesn’t have a lot of experience in the kitchen but am getting better.  First time I made this I’d give it a 6 due to my ability.  Second time I made it, I did whole thing start to finish in about 30 mins and it was great!

Advice: (1) I have a lemon tree.  I used 1/4 cup juice.  Next time I will probably add 3 tablespoons more.  (2). Meringue :  don’t wisk, use beaters.  Whip it up FIRST and THEN put your lemon filling on the stove.  (3) when done pour boiling hot filling into pie crust, then Immediately place meringue on top.  That is key to get it to stick together.  (4) after baking, cool on rack for 10 mins and then into fridge for 90 mins UNCOVERED.   What you do after that is up to you.

I CHANGED ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ABOUT THIS RECIPE as it frustrates me when people change things then rate it. I believe you must try the original recipe first in order to know what (if anything) you should change. Having never made a lemon meringue pie before in my life, I don’t understand why people were struggling with this pie. The lemon filling set up nicely and had a great lemon flavor and the meringue was a sweet marshmallowy flavor/texture. I do not feel any changes were necessary and would make this recipe again! Thanks!

Made this recipe according to how it is writen.  It came out very runny. Needs more cornstarch.  I made another  recipe and it called for 1/3 cup of starch. Thickened up really nice. Was told first ones flavor was good

Excellent!  The lemon filling is sweet and tart.  Just like i like it.  
A few ...minor changes.  My wife is gluten intolerant, so i used King Arthur gluten free flour, and a crust recipe from their website.  I also added a bit of lemon juice to the meringue to stiffen it up a bit.

This pie for me needed some help:
The submitter assumes the reader knows how to prebake a crust for a lemon meringue pie, it should be stated in the recipe, I blind baked mine for 10 mintes at 400 degrees 
I felt there was not enough thickener, I omitted the flour and doubled the cornstarch, I do not like the floury taste it can impart when the pie is not baked
For me not enough lemon, I would double it, using 4 tbsps of zest and 1/2 cup lemon juice, reduce water to 1 1/4 cups. I also added a few drops of yellow food colour as it was not very yellow
For the meringue I always add 1/2 tsp cream of tartar to help stabilize the peaks
Do not cover your lemon meringue pie it will get soggy and weepy.

Very delicious, I love lemon anything. I always wipe down my bowl and beaters with white vinegar when making meringue. If there is any "oil/dirt" on them the meringue will not "rise".

Great recipe! I was out of corn starch so I used tapioca starch. Never gotten a lemon meringue pie to set up, tapioca starch is the trick! 
I also used Meyer lemons from my grandmas lemon tree, Sooo good!

I was hesitant because I have never made a pie and definitely not merengue. This recipe was simple and easy for me and a 13 yr old to do. We made 2.   She loves lemon and said it was perfect.

As per the other reviews, I added an extra 30 ml of egg white to the meringue. I used extra large eggs and this turned out beautifully! 
The only complaint I heard was there wasn't enough filling, so I may adjust for that specific person.

I did not give myself enough prep time and my pie shell was not quite done when the filling had thickened. Regardless it turned out delicious! Next time I might try a sugar substitute as there is a lot of sugar... I’ll definitely be saving this one.

I increased the recipe to 12 servings and followed exactly.  The beset meringue I have ever made.  I tasted the filling when I put it in the crust and I think it could use a little more lemon flavor.  My husband didn't agree.  I am serving tonight for family dinner.  We will see how everyone liked it.
UPDATE: That was THE best tasting lemon pie I have ever made. The family loved it.

This was a very good recipe.  My mom used to make this all the time but I have never tried it.  I was trying to do all my "man-friend's" favorites for Valentines Day and found this recipe.  I didn't change anything and it turned out great!  He was very happy with it and said it was even better than what his mom used to make.  Because I've never made meringue before, I didn't know how long it takes to get to it to the point of forming peaks.  If you are like me, don't think you are doing anything wrong.  Just hang in there and it will eventually get the whipped look.  I will definitely make this again.

easy to make and delicious. I used a vanilla wafer crust. I did use  the broiler at lo for a minute after the 10 minutes baking to brown the meringue.

Great and easy to make. I loved how much meringue there was. I like my pie a bit more on the lemon side, so I added an extra ~1/4 cup lemon juice and 3tbsp sugar. I also added a 1/2tsp cream of tartar to help the egg whites along. Otherwise this recipe was wonderful. And impressively fool proof.

This was a huge hit! Very easy to make and the flavor was perfect. Not too sweet or sour, and just enough lemon. I will definitely make it again. Think i will try Meyer lemons next time.

Made it just as it is, and it was fabulous. Wonderful tangy lemon flavour - just like it should be! This will be my go-to lemon pie recipe from now on.

This was simply fantastic. I made a triple recipe which was perfect for 2 pies. I added 1/2 teaspoon each of cream of tartar and vanilla while whipping the meringue.

Very good pie, though the recipe needs some clarification.  Following some of the tips posted by other reviewers, I prepared the meringue first and set it aside, before preparing the lemon curd.  I juiced 3 lemons to get 1/2 cup of juice.  After adding the tempered eggs to the lemon curd, I continued to stir and boil for about 2 minutes.  The curd was still somewhat runny.  I poured the lemon curd into the baked pie crust, and immediately topped the piping hot mixture with the meringue, and put it straight into the oven for baking.  When I took the pie out of the oven, it was still visibly jiggly, and I was very worried that it wouldn't set.  I allowed it to fully cool to room temperature, then wrapped it in foil and put it into the fridge overnight.  When I served it the next day, it was perfectly set, and the meringue stayed put without separating and sliding off.  It sliced perfectly and made a lovely and delicious pie.  The pie is definitely NOT ready in 40 minutes, as you have to allow plenty of time for refrigeration to allow the pie filling to set.  The only change I made was that I forgot to zest the fresh lemons, so I substituted a sprinkle of dried lemon peel (about 1/8 tsp) in the filling.  (P.S. I don't recommend the video, as the video incorrectly instructs you to spoon the dry cornstarch into the liquid in the pan.)

The lemon filling turned out quite nicely. Filled tart shells added meringue, baked, and the meringue collapsed a bit, but good overall!

Follow the recipe exactly, and it will turn out fine, even for a meringue novice like me. Just make sure you have the meringue ready to go as soon as the pudding-like filling is ready, so that it can be put directly on very hot filling taken straight from the stove. 

After baking, I let it rest on the counter for about 2 hours and then refrigerated it uncovered overnight. Luscious, smooth, lemony and a beautiful color that caused my husband to ask if I used food coloring! (Nope!)

I made this pie for out of town company.  Having never made it before I hoped is wouldn't let me down. IT WAS A BIG HIT!!  Everyone loved it.  I only used half the sugar and more lemon juice in the  in the curd for a more tangy flavor.  And added a teaspoon vanilla extract in the merange.  I used a crust recipe from  All Recipes called Ruth's Grandma's pie crust (beautuful and flakey). All of this created a lovely pie that left me with and empty pie pan.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exact and it came out perfect.  Very lemony, which we like.  My meringue was exceptional!  I wasn't sure exactly how much lemon to actually use since that can vary depending on the size of the lemons, but mine made about 1/2 cup and that was just right for us.   We had half a bottle of wine which we drank with our pie and it made a perfect ending to a beautiful Spring day.

I've made this pie approximately 10 times now and all but this last time it was superb. I made the mistake of modifying the recipe. I ask myself if this pie could get any better but decided to try  the "tweaks" that CARTHECOOK suggested. It's a whole different pie. Lemon juice is not a substitute for fresh squeezed lemons and not using the lemon zest causes it to lose that slight tartness that makes lemon pies so dang good. The extra corn starch makes the filling too stiff and the sugar changed nothing.  
Each to there own but the "tweaks" makes a 5 star pie a 3. Just wish I would have decided not to make the changes when taking dessert for friends that request lemon pie every time we come. Th ONLY change I would make to this recipe is oven temp for the meringue. At 350 it takes 20 minutes+.

This was my first time making lemon meringue pie.  Lemon part turned out AWESOME.  I had some difficulties making the meringue (tried three times) and on the last try looked for another meringue recipe and found this one:

3 egg whites 
1/4 tsp. cream of tartar 
6 tbsp. sugar 
1/2 tsp. vanilla 
Beat the egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peaks form . Add sugar 1 tbsp. at a time , beating constantly until sugar is dissolved and whites are glossy . Beat in vanilla . 

After making the meringue with this recipe, the pie turned out GREAT!

Best lemon meringue pie recipe I've found to date! The only thing I'd like to add is in regards to this recipe claiming that it's ready in 40 mins, which is impossible unless you want a sloppy mess. You should cool the filling a bit before putting the meringue on it (I put it in the fridge until it goes from hot to warm) and after it's done baking you should let it cool at least 30-60 min before serving it.

Easier than I thought and sooo good. Never made any cream or meringue because I thought it would be too difficult. But this was not complex & turned out perfect. Not too tart, not too sweet.

This was my first attempt at a Lemon Meringue pie and, despite the fact that my merigue wasn't perfect, it still looked and tasted delicious! I will definitely make this again, but I'll reduce the amount of sugar in both the merigue and filling, to our taste. And because I prefer a creamy filling,  I substituted milk for water. Thank you for sharing!

My 1st time making lemon meringue and it worked!  I read a lot of reviews and here's what worked for me.  I followed the recipe exactly as stated.  2 important things - cook your pie shell first and increase the number of hours this really takes to about 8 hours.  I had time for it to cool  but not chill and it wasn't quite as great.  Luckily, I made 2 pies and the next day served the other chilled one  - incredible!  Also, definitely double the recipe for the filling.  It was great, can't imagine how little there would be if I hadn't doubled it.  I kept meringue portion the same and it was enough for me but not a gigantic portion.  I didn't know how to do meringue so here's what I learned.  Whisk the eggs until foamy also means - until it doubles or triples in size so go beyond just the foamy part.

I feel like this didn't have the right "feel" for a lemon meringue. It was sort of good, but the meringue was far too eggy and didn't stick to the lemony part. I'll keep looking for the best lemon meringue recipe.

I made this, my first ever homemade lemon meringue pie, yesterday for easter dinner and it was a hit.  I read lots of the reviews and made the meringue first, so that I could put it immediately on the hot lemon filling. I also followed others' advice to use about 1/2 cup of lemon juice (about 2.5 lemons), and the zest from only one lemon.  The tart/sweet balance was perfect.  The only other change I made was to add 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar to the meringue as it really helps stiffen and preserve the peaks in the meringue, making for a beautiful effect on the finished product.  My only advice to others is to make sure you CONSTANTLY whisk the lemon mixture as you are cooking it or you'll have some lumps.

All I can say is... Wow. I've never been a huge lemon pie fan, but for some reason I have been on a lemon kick lately so I decided to try this and I was so happy I did! We are watching our sugar intake, so I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup plus about 1/4 cup of Stevia and it worked out great. The merengue came out perfect as well -- I was proud of myself! Thanks for a great recipe.

I used a graham cracker crust and this turned out really yummy.  I also made another substituting lime for lemon and I liked it even better.  I plan to try it again but I'm hoping to find a substitute for the flour as I need something gluten free.

Store didn't have lemons but used 4 limes instead. Oh! and the meringue takes FOREVER to whip by hand, so use a mixer! Super tasty though. Family really enjoyed it!

Fabulous. I always include resting/chilling time before I do the meringue. I'd recommend hours in the fridge.

The curd came out soupy, did not set at all. I added an extra tablespoon of starch, and cooked it extra long.

This was such an easy pie to make, thank you for a simple recipe. I did not change a thing. I will have to wait to taste it until tomorrow. It's for my husband who's been on the road for two days, he will be very happy to have this beautiful pie to eat. Thanks again.

I have made this recipe, exactly at written, a few times. It is easy to make, and the result is wonderful. My family loves it. One time, though, I didn't wait until the lemon filling was VERY thick and it became a soupy, yet flavourful, mess.

Turned out great! We increased all ingredients by 50%, used 1% milk (no water), no flour (but increased corn starch accordingly). Thereby deeming the filling gluten free & putting some of the filling/meringue in 2 ramekins (no pie shell) for our gluten free guests. A little more lemon juice might make the recipe even better...but it still gets an A+. (I have no idea why some are getting a runny filling...they are doing something(s) wrong!)

We made this with limes that were leftover from a margarita-making party. Excellent!  Used the juice from 4 limes. Not too tart, not too sweet!  Perfect.

It was a delicious pie over-all, but I think next time I will tweak the recipe a bit. The lemon base was  bit loose, so  I will probably increase the cornstarch to 3 1/2 tablespoons. I will also decrease the lemon zest to 1 tablespoon rather than the 2-3 tablespoons I got out of my two lemons.

I have made this 3 times now for my hubby's birthday. He absolutely loves it.  I am not a great baker, but this recipe is not difficult.  I do use the juice of 3 lemons instead of 2, but other than that I follow it as written.  It has gotten me great brownie points!

Fantastic recipe! I made this twice now. The first time, I was in the middle of the process when I realized I couldn't find my measuring spoons. So, I ended up not quite putting the right amount of corn starch in. Needless to say, it was a little runny that time. Second time around, equipped with proper measuring spoons, it turned out perfect.  After reading some of the reviews where people had trouble, I will say: if your pie is runny, its because you didn't add enough starch .. the second time around I did add an extra 1/4 teaspoon of cornstarch). If the meringue isn't fluffing up enough, I used a hand mixer and it fluffed up perfect with stiff peaks (this was my first pie I ever made, and first time making meringue).

The Meringue wasn't whipped and it was more bubbly and very flat. There was also a lot more lemon than meringue.

Yes yes yes! I did make this substituting the water for milk. Delish. I have tried it bothlemon and lime. Delish either way. My very picky hubby loves it! Has never lasted long enough for others to try it.. I only gave it 4 because of my milk subsitution, but in all fairness I haven't tried it with water so I do not know how it compares.

I absolutely loved this recipe. I have never made lemon meringue pie before, so I just made it for myself. It came out fantastic! I am a pretty experienced baker and I found the recipe very easy to follow. It was the perfect mix between sweet and tart and tastes like heaven. I plan on making this for many years to come.

Great tasting, with a perfect amount of sweetness and tartness and without a starchy flavor that some pies have.  The meringue was nice and fluffy.

This was my first try at a lemon meringue pie completely from scratch. I Followed this recipe as written.  It was simple and the taste is absolutely spot on. Thank you for this simple, delicious and inexpensive recipe. Also, I think my sweetie loves me a little more.

This recipe didn't need any tweeting!  It's perfect just the way it is.  Super fast and perfect for a summer evening desert after the scotching heat of the day.  Definitely going to make this again and again.  My meringue didn't pull away and my zest totally melted away.  And I didn't have to cook it for 14 minutes.  WOW I bet yours was really really thick.  Mine was perfect and it couldn't have been any better.

this pie is fantastic!!!!!  I left out the lemon zest and added a couple of small squirts of yellow food colouring to the filling. The meringue was about 3 inches high as I really piled it up. I also added cream of tartar to the meringue. I will definitely be making this again

The first time I made the meringue pie. Excellent! Not as hard as it may sound. However, I think I might exclude the zest or cut down the lemons because the lower part seemed a bit bitter. Definitely will make this pie again!

A fantastic recipe!  Really easy and turned out perfect!  The only thing I did outside of the recipe was add a teaspoon of Cream of Tartar to the meringue as to prevent "sweating"  and 1 extra yolk to the lemon curd. I also baked the pie for about 20 min at 325.  I will be making this one again for sure!  Thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe exactly 
(with the exception of a little extra lemon zest, as i like a tart pie.)
 And it came out great.. I wouldn't tweak it at all. 
the curd set good and tasted great.

I made mine gluten free!!  Instead of flour I substituted equal amount of Trader Joe's gluten free flour mix.  I used these modifications from CARTHECOOK 's suggestions in her review:
Filling:  1-1/4c sugar (regular granules), 3-1/2 TBSP corn starch
Meringue: mixed for about 2 minutes then added 1/2 tsp cream of tartar & 1 tsp vanilla extract.  I let it beat for the amount of time it took me to wash a few dishes - maybe 3 minutes or so.  It came out stiff and fluffy. 
 The filling was super thick before even adding the egg yolks.  The pies are in the fridge now, but I don't doubt they will be perfect!  A little hint:  Use farm fresh eggs for increased color and flavor!

Was really really good!!!!!! I made mini pies in cupcake tins and they were a hit for my party! I did add a little more sugar to the lemon mix, as it was too tart. Might need a little more next time but again was a hit! Will definitely be making again and again!

I made this recipe with the revisions of CartheCook from September 23, 2005 review. Except I used fresh lemons and zest and I had to use three to get the perfect flavor. The only problem was mine came out green. I don't know what I did wrong but other than that this would have been perfect it wasn't waterey the meringue came out awesome. I just need to know why mine came out green.

I made this into mini lemon meringues (I got 15 about 2" each).  Was good just not to our preferences. This was VERY sweet  lemon meringue pie & we prefer a more tart version. Will be looking for another recipe or will tweak this one next time - maybe less sugar. Will update.

Very delicious. First try at meringue and I didn't get the high peaks.  Added more sugar. How long does it take to form peaks?  The lemon curd was. Wonderful.  I used three lemons that we grew inside on our Meyer lemon tree. The meringue separated from the curd but we didn't wait to eat the pie chilled.  It was tasty. I'll try it again.

My brother in law was complaining that no one made lemon meringue pie for him.  I whipped this up after lunch for christmas dinner.  It turned out very nicely.  I wanted a bit more meringue, so I used 5 eggs instead of 4.  I would probably reduce the sugar in the lemon for my family, but it turned out very nicely and was super easy:)

I LOVE lemon meringue pie but have never attempted to make it.......but this recipe was foolproof!  I followed the recipe for the curd and meringue faithfully and it was wonderful!  Even my DH, who would rather have meringue pie than anything other sweet, loved it.  I got 2 small pieces, he ate the rest of the pie!

Never made a homemade lemon meringue pie from scratch and was anxious about being able to get it right.  I followed the directions to the letter and it turned out great! My boyfriend is very picky about pies and he loved it as well!

My first attempt at lemon meringue. I read the review from CARTHECOOK, and skipped the zest.  Like some of the other reviewers I increased the lemons to three.  I made Emeril's Basic Pie Crust and baked two crusts for about 15 minutes.  I doubled the recipe but whisked in more than 1/2 cup ( 1 cup doubled) of the hot sugar mixture.  I put the meringue on top of the custard while it was still warm.  I cooled the pie on the counter over an hour, but got over zealous and cut into one of the pies, before it was chilled.  It was delicious but began to ooze.  I then placed both pies into the refrig uncovered, after watching the related video, for the recommended three hours..

Very Yummy! I added more lemon juice bc we love lemon. The only thing is that i have found that the meringue separates from the lemon. Not sure how to make it not do this though. Still veryyyyyyy yummy and the leftovers keep very well!

This pie was delicious.  I was looking for a recipe like my Mother used to bake and this is it!  Just add 1 additional tsp of cornstarch and at least 1/4 cup of lemons juiced.  Thank you sooo much for this recipe.

This recipe was very good! I made one mistake..... I didn't let the pie cool off enough and i covered it before I placed it in the refrigerator.  The meringue fell a little bit...... Other than that .... Delicious!!

Once you've made your crust, this is a great simple recipe. My only improvement is to add some lemon juice to the meringue. I like the flour and starch combo, make it very thick.

This recipe is amazing. I did use a little cream of tar tar in the meringue, I also used a little more lemon juice than called for. All three times i have made it were perfect. My mother even commented "Better than grandmas."

This is a very good recipe, producing a good tasting lemon meringue pie. The only complaint, thus only 4 star rating, is that there wasn't enough filling for the 9" - deep pie plate I used. The amount of filling would be enough for a shallow pie plate. When I use this recipe again I will increase the filling by half.

First off, the flavor in this pie was INCREDIBLE! I loved the fresh lemon flavor and the creamy meringue (though my little siblings did not care for it as much :P) However, the consistency of the lemon part reminded me a bit of creamy jell-o, and had a bit of a slippery texture. This may have to do with the fact that I used arrowroot starch (what we had on hand) instead of the cornstarch... Perhaps this was the issue? But overall I liked this recipe enough to want to mess around with the ingredients to see if I can get the texture just right.

I made this pie for Father's Day and followed the recipe exactly.  The lemon custard never did set and was watery. The instructions did not indicate how long to cook until thick.  I cooked until I thought it was thick - but it ended up watery.  DO NOT recommend this recipe.

My lemons seemed a bit small and the lemon flavor is the best part of the pie, so I juiced and zested 3 (rather than 2) lemons. This turned out wonderfully! I have never had a better lemon meringue pie.

I like to read the reviews before trying the recipe. The author who made this recipe is perfect for me. However, I was mislead by the reviewers abt using Meyer Lemons, these lemons are crossed between a manderin orange and a lemon, which I didn't know. I bought some from the store, mom says they look like oranges, somewhat, and then I read the package. They had a small taste/smell of an orange, I was skeptical and used less than 2 lemons and dilute it w/ lemon juice.  I would still use the Meyer Lemons, along w/ the lemon juice.  It is sweet tasting, but I still taste orange. I doubled the recipe and use 2 small aluminum foil pans (recycled) :D  Delicious recipe, tx for sharing

This is my first lemon pie and my first review here so I cannot do comparisons. This recipe is really easy to make. I also made the "Perfect Pie crust II" good combination. I suppose with ready made pie crust it would be a piece of cake. The filling is easy to make but next time I will use less lemon juice and eggs because it came out really sour. I also used a bit more cornstarch than recommended, the filling needed it. Overall lovely recipe but not excited, will try out more!

The meringue topping came out well and cooked in the amount of time listed on the recipe, but the lemon filling required an extra 20 minutes because it was left refrigerating too long before place in the oven.

Delicious. I used crisco's pie crust recipe for the crust, fresh lemons from our lemon tree, and added vanilla to the meringue. Amazing!! Only mistake I made was slicing in too early. Let it cool and refrigerate before slicing in.

WOW!!! This is incredibly easy and delicious. I followed the instructions, I just executed them a little different. How I did it was in the top of a double boiler I combined the sugar, flour, cornstarch, salt, water, lemon juice and zest, and the egg yolks. I whisked all of this together constantly over medium high heat. I timed it, and seven minutes later it was very creamy and thick. No need for tempering the egg yolks. I took it off the heat and stirred in the butter. Next time I won't be using the butter because I couldn't see a difference in the taste. Oh, and my double boiler was nothing fancy. I used a large stainless steel mixing bowl and set it over a pot of simmering water. I poured this mixture into a graham cracker crust, and since I don't care for meringue, when it had cooled in the refrigerator, I topped it with cool-whip. I will be making this very often for sure.

This turned out to be a great pie! It was my first too! The only thing I found a little unnecessary was the lemon zest. Some people prefer the lemon filling to be just lemon. Note: when you make the meringue be careful to clean your tools very carefully. I had some water in the bowl and on the whisk, so the meringue didn't form peaks. Sadly I had to dump it out, but the next one was much better.

This is the first Lemon Meringue Pie I have made from scratch.  Totally easy and it was so beautiful when completed.  Almost didn't want anyone to cut it.  However, they did and it was gone in minutes.  Loved it.

Followed the recipe to a T and MMMMMM sooo delicious!!! Fluffy meringue and lemon-y, just how I like it! First try at lemon meringue and it was amazing! Will make again. i covered the curd with tin foil (would've used plastic wrap but it wasn't on hand) after I poured it into the store-bought dough pan to keep it from losing heat (that was also 6 mins after I poured it into the pan... Oops!). Yummy nonetheless and a keeper for sure!

Delicious. I did read some of the previews first and made the lemon filling half water/half milk and also made the topping first (put it aside to cool) before I started the lemon filling. This must be heavenly on a hot day too with the fresh lemon flavour.

I really liked it. But for some reason, the picture showed the lemon halfway up the crust, and the meringue was about 75% of the pie. Strange, eh?

Delicious! First time making lemon merigue pie for others. It turned out great except that the meringue pulled away from the edges of the pie. No one seemed to mind as the taste was phenominal!

I L-O-V-E this recipe. I followed the directions exactly for the pie filling. However, I deviated from the meringue recipe by adding 1/2 cup sugar instead of 6 tablespoons and also added a teaspoon of vanilla extract.
I have had difficulty with meringue in the past so here are a few tips
1.) Make sure the egg whites are room temperature; it makes a big difference.
2.) Add the sugar gradually and not all at once. I gently shake the measuring cup sprinkling some into the mixing bowl then whisking it in completely before repeating the process.

A friend of the family often made homemade lemon meringue pie when I was a kid. So it makes perfect sense that when I got an itch to make something sweet my first pie would be a lemon meringue. I chose this recipe because of it's popularity and followed it exactly. I can't say it's better than the pie I use to have, but it's equal to it.

Great pie first time it was made. Because we have our own chickens and the eggs are a little smaller, my daughter and I added two extra. It turned out great.

I used 1 1/4c sugar, 1 3/4c water, 1/2c lemon juice, the rest the same.  The custard center wasn't thick enough, I added 1/2T cornstarch to a little mixture, heated again after I saw it wasn't thickening and it *still* wasn't thick enough. May try 1/4c cornstarch next time.  Tasted good!

It was my first attempt at making a lemon-meringue pie and it was really good. The next time I'm gonna try it though, i'll cut the sugar down a bit. I'll try with 3/4 cup, because it was wayyyy to sweet! But it was easy and I won't search for another lemon meringue pie ever!!!
Thanks for sharing!!

This was the first time I ever made a lemon meringue pie and it was easy, fabulous and didn't even last an hour.  I made it in a torte pan so it would be a bit larger and flatter.  It was fabulous just as printed!

Everything about this recipe is perfect. A delicious pie. I did only use the zest of one and a half lemons though. That was plenty of lemon taste for me.

This is for a shallow pie crust. I have deep 9 in pie dish, when doubled filled up only half way. As for cooking until super thick, not necessary the curd will thicken when it cools. Using milk instead of water (as mentioned in the comments) in my opinion tones down the lemon a little, so does vanilla but makes it a tiny bit more creamy. I know because when I made the second batch I tried it with milk instead of water. I ended up combining the two batches to fill the pie dish more. Overall nice flavor and texture and ideal for a small pie.

I loved this. It was nice and simple, and even though I forgot to add the butter, it still tasted AMAZING. I can't wait to make it again, with butter, and be blown away.

This was my first time in making a lemon meringue pie and it turned out ok. I will say that the lemon filling had good flavor and it wasn't runny. I guess my main complaint was that it there wasn't very much filling or meringue. I guess I'm used to seeing pies that have a lot more to each layer. I'm not sure if I did something wrong or if this is just how this recipe is.

I made this for Father's Day for my husband and he absolutely loved it. He said it was the best Lemon Meringue pie he's ever had. Maybe he was being overly-generous, but it really was good. It's definitely time-consuming, but well worth it if you like lemon. I used the juice of 3 lemons and extra fine sugar as suggested by another reviewer and the custard came out perfect. I let it sit on the counter to cool for an hour before refrigerating and the next day when it was time to serve, the consistency was absolutely perfect.

I had some myer lemons left and didnt know what to do with them until I came across this receipe. I did follow others instructions when making the pie. In the past Ive made lemon meringue pies but the meringue always pulled away and I had liquid in the bottom of the pie pan. NOT this time , my hubby fell in love with this and so did I. Not too tart not too sweet, but just PERFECT! I'll be making this one throu out the summer . Thanks!

This was my first time making either a meringue or a custard, and I am so glad I read some of the additional comments.  Great tips there if you're inexperienced!  The pie turned out very pretty and very tasty.  Will probably make again.

Very easy to make but runny when done.  Try refrigerating after cooling to firm up the filling.  My pies were gorgeous, but I was so disappointed when I attempted to serve slices.  I needed a spoon!  It was Lemon Meringue Soup.  :-(  Flavor however was outstanding.  I made one lemon and one key lime.  I will definately retry this pie - maybe play with the filling while cooking to thicken prior to refrigerating!

I'm a huge fan of lemon meringue pie. I got a stand mixer as a gift and could not wait to try making my own. I've since made this one 3 times because it's the best I've ever had and I can't get enough. I follow the recipe as is, but if you can get your hands on a Nilla Wafer premade crust, OMG!!!!

This is my first Lemon Meringue pie, my mother always made them, and they were the best!  Now that I'm in Nebraska and she's in California, it was time for me to do it.  So simple to prepare.  I did however add one more lemon for the juice we really like the tangy of lemon.  Although my mom's is the best I was very pleased of the outcome and my husband loved it!!  Now to dplicate that famous apple pie of hers!!  Thank you for making my first Lemon Meringue pie a success!!

I love this pie! It is pretty easy to make and it tastes delicious! I have made the small substitute of skim milk for water which I found has helped with the consistency of the filling. This pie has become the favourite of my friends and family. The only problem is that now I am asked to make it everywhere I go!

Fabulous recipe! Very, very "lemony." I used a store-bought crust and if you choose to go this route, make sure you purchase a deep dish crust. I will definitely be making this for years to come!

Good recipe. But, I agree with everyone else, you should always make the meringue first so that when you put it on top of the curd it begins to bake. The directions for this recipe were a little confusing. 
Also, to make a delicious meringue I added cream of tartar and vanilla flavoring to it.

10 STARS on this Grandma's Lemon Meringue Pie! First time I ever made Lemon Meringue in 32 years of marriage--I wish I would've had this recipe sooner! I always thought LM Pie had to be made with Lemon Pie Filling-you know-like Jello Pudding/Pie Filling. Hello?! Had I known it was this YUMMY & EASY, I would've made it sooner! I will say I will add 2 Tablespoons more SUGAR to the Meringue next time & remember to keep all ingredients for the meringue  ICE COLD! * HUBBY LOVES IT! I DO need to find a better crust recipe-something more flaky than the recipe I have. But, I'm sure I'll find one on Allrecipes.com! Thanks for sharing this!

This turned out great for me. I used large lemons, and added some cream of tartar to the meringue. Turned out great. I made it for my grandmother a couple of times, and everybody said it was great.

Very good pie, though next time I need to be sure to use an electric mixer to make the meringue. I don't have the arm strength/stamina required to whisk all that by hand!

Great recipe. Easy to make with great results. It was gone in no time. I used the zest and juice from three medium lemons. I also added 1/2 tsp cream of tartar to the egg whites. I might double the meringue next time since I like it mile high. I am also going to make this with lime in place of lemon and see how it turns out.

Very good lemony favor.  Had never made this type of pie before so I don't have much to compare to regarding the ingredients, but it was very easy and it came out excellent!  One note, don't forget to mix the dry ingredients before adding any liquid if you want a nice smooth consistency.  I mistakenly added the lemon juice too soon - oops!

This is a wonderful and easy pie! I've made these into little tarts as well, and the kids can't get enough! My children (ages 9 & 11) both love to help prepare this, which makes for a very special time!

Yum. :) I actually chose this recipe because I was in the mood for something sweet, but didn't have a lot of ingredients at home and it was too late to go to the store. So, I had to improvise a little. First, I used a graham cracker crust. I had no fresh lemons, so I used a half cup of lemon juice. The only other alterations I made was to use 1 cup milk and 1/2 cup water, since the reviewers were divided on which was better. I used the proportions specified in the recipe for everything else and it came out great. Good ratio of meringue to custard. Ideally, it would have been more lemon-y, but that is a shortcoming provided by my lack of fresh lemons and zest, not due to any fault of the recipe. The custard was a bit thick and gummy for my liking, but it wasn't *bad,* per se. I will make this recipe again with a few tweaks. Thanks for sharing!

this pie is just what I was craving! I did add a healthy teaspoon of vanilla to the custard, it seemed to smooth out any bitterness, one of my lemons was strangely bitter??...but, otherwise perfect. I also wait until the pie is cooled to add the meringue and then pop it into the oven for browning...this rings my bell!

I have made this recipe at least 5 times and it always, always turns out well!  In the very beginning, I had a little extra liquid and made two slight accommodations:  I sprinkled a little bit of corn starch in the bottom of the pre-cooked crust just before I poured in the lemon curd filling.  Also, I let the pie cool in the oven for about an hour.  Now it's perfect!  I can't tell you how many requests I get for this pie!  You absolutely can't go wrong!

This pie is a 10!  It's bright, tangy and very good.  I followed the recipe and did not change a thing.  The only issue I had was that my meringue wept a little.  I attribute that to my error, as my eggs were not at room temperature.  I will definitely make this again.

Good--but I would have like a stronger lemon flavor.  Also, I seriously underbaked the "made from scratch" pie crust I used.  It would have helped had there been instructions re making and baking the pie crust.

Perfect balance of tartness and sweetness - a classic lemon meringue pie.  I used the juice of 2 lemons and then topped up to 1/2 cup total juice by adding lemon juice concentrate; and zest of one lemon. Everything else I did just as written - except used 6 egg whites for the meringue to make higher and fluffier.  Delicious

I might very well have done something wrong, tho I am pretty sure I followed the recipe exact.  So, I will not be making this one again.  The lemon filling was very runny even after resting in the fridge for a few hours.  And, the lemon flavour was weak for my husband who loves lemon meringue pie.

Fantastic pie! The first time I made the pie, the lemon was overwhelming, so the next time I made it I use 2 tsp. lemon zest instead of all the lemon zest. If you like lemon A LOT, then keep it as it is, but it turned out great both ways. GREAT recipe.

Loved the lemon meringue pie. I have tried for years to make the pie jel. Always had wonderful taste but didn't keep the inside set right. The way its cooked is why it cooked up good. Made a chocolate pie from a lady in the resturant business and the way it was cooked made it,also the mixing of flour and cornstartch. Great pie .Best for lemon. It deserves mone then 5 stars. Thanks for the trick of mixing.

This was my first attempt at lemon meringue pie and it turned out fantastic!  I added cream of tartar to the meringue, but that was the only change I made.  I had guests over for dinner who were big lemon meringue fans and they asked if they could bring some home with them.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I had never made, or for that matter eaten lemon meringue pie before but I made the mistake of asking my father in law what kind of pie he wanted  on Christmas. I couldn't say no so I went on a search and found this recipe. The in laws all loved it so I think this recipe is a keeper! Oh, and I even tried a little slice and it was pretty darned tasty.

Great pie.  I used it for Christmas dinner and everyone at the party loved it!  The only change I made was using the rind of only one of the lemons because I was afraid it would be too tart. It was perfect.

This was the first time I have ever made lemon meringue pie and it came out perfectly! I was quite proud. I feel that the recipe being simple was the key to my success. I followed the directions and took some of the suggestions in the reviews: Increased sugar to 1 1/4 cups, increase cornstarch to 3 1/2 TBSP, added 1 tsp vanilla to meringue.  I made this for Thanksgiving and my family is full of lemon meringue pie lovers, all of whom love love loved this pie! I love cooking but haven't had much experience with cooking up pie fillings like this, so if I can do it just by following this recipe, I imagine most anyone can. I used a store-bought crust, however. I haven't mastered the art of the pie crust, I'm afraid.

Boy was that easy! Just gather all your ingredients before following recipe, you know, measuring, juicing, zesting, separating yolks from whites and don't forget to have the pie shell already baked. I Love  lemon meringue pie!

I have made this many times before, and I love this recipe.  It turns out great every time.  I wanted to make this today, but I do not care for regular pie crust, so I decided to change it up a little.  I made a graham cracker, coconut crust that I prebaked.  Then I added the filling, the meringue on top, and then sprinkled it with some more coconut before baking it.  Love it even more now.  The lemon coconut flavors work so well together.  The filling on this pie is so perfect that I think any crust would taste good.

The egg white meringue never separated from the lemon curd and it never got watery like some recipes do. My family tore it up! So good!!

I really enjoyed making this pie and didn't change a thing.  Myself and a friend of mine enjoyed it.  My only issues was trying to zest my thumb and forgetting to turn off my burner and melting some plastic in the process.

I made this yesterday. It turned out really good. My meringue did weep a little, and there was a little water under the meringue, but I suspect that is the fault of the humid and rainy weather (I didn't know that affected meringue), the fact that I hand whipped the meringue (I don't have an electric mixer), and that my oven is small and crappy. However, the taste was excellent, and the curd thickened very well. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is great! I made a few modifications as follows: 1. Used milk instead of water 2. no lemon zest - 3/4 c of raspberry jam instead 3. 2 extra tbsp of lemon juice 4. Used 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar with the salt in the meringue  Makes an awesome raspberry-lemon meringue pie!!

This pie was amazing.  It was my first try at Lemon Meringue and it turned out perfectly.  I didn't change one thing and everyone raved about it.  However for my personal taste I would like more fresh lemon. The meringue was absolutely flawless!!

YAY! I did it! I am very proud of myself, because I normally don't like to bake. When my husband said he liked Lemon Meringue Pie, and that it reminded him of his childhood, I wanted to make it. I think it calls for the lemon zest, because it might add some extra lemony flavor. I used up all of my lemon juice, and the custard didn't taste lemony enough to be lemon meringue pie. So, I added some lemonade I had, and some lime juice to make it more tart. The recipe is great, it's the baker that had some issues.

Excellent recipe.  I used a store bought graham cracker crust.  I also really cooked the lemon filling fairly long to make sure it was thickened.  Make the meringue before you are ready to pour the lemon filling so that you add the meringue while filling is hot.  I add 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar to meringue (habit).  Best next day!

5 stars for the filling... it was perfect because it wasn't too sweet (i followed the exact measurements in this recipe).    i can't rate the meringue because i didn't use it (i used the meringue II recipe from this site) because i was worried about this meringue not calling for cream of tartar like every other meringue i have ever seen.  because i was making this for a birthday party i couldn't risk it not turning out.  next time i will try it the meringue specified here...

This tasted fantastic! It was very creamy and had just the right amount of tartness. I did manage to ruin the meringue topping though! After it finished baking, I took it out of the oven. It sat for about 5 minutes and I decided that it looked too wet, so I decided to bake it a little longer. The oven was pre-heating and I decided to put it back in WHILE IT WAS STILL HEATING! I started smelling a burned smell, I looked in the oven and the meringue was completely black! I just peeled the burned part off and baked it a little longer to make it look slightly presentable. It still tasted FANTASTIC, despite my numerous mistakes!

I made this with artificial sweetener (I used "Ideal" sweetener) for my mother-in-law's birthday.  She's a diabetic & loves lemon meringue pie but hasn't been able to have it in years.  She was thrilled with it.  I did substitute milk for water & I don't know if it was because I used artificial sweetner, but I think the filling could have been fuller so next time I make it, I'll increase the filling by half again.  Anyway, the pies (I made 2) were a hit with everyone, even the non-diabetic folks.  They all said the flavor was wonderful, so I can only imagine how good this must taste with real sugar.  The only complaint is that these pies took FOREVER to make, but it could have been because I made my own pie crusts as well.  I'll be making this for my mother-in-law again as a treat for her for mother's day!

This is yummy! First time making lemon meringue pie and am very satisfied with the results.  I reduced the sugar in the custard to 1/2 cup because I like things tart, but other than that I stuck to the recipe. Thanks for sharing.

This turned out really well. This was the first time that I've ever made (or eaten, actually) lemon meringue pie. I loved it :) The only change I made was that I used meyer lemon's in place of regular lemons. I didn't have any problems and it tasted fantastic. Will make again :)

This pie was surprisingly easy to make! It is really not that much harder than making the boxed kind but SO much better! One tip is to make sure you aren't going to be interrupted when you are in the final stages of making the lemon filling because you really can't leave it. Delicious, thanks for the recipe!

Made this with a few changes. I used milk instead of water. I upped the cornstarch as written and then added a teaspoon more. I had the baked crust waiting  in the oven and the meringue already waiting. for some reason, I had a cup and one half  of lemon juice real and bottled mixed. Dont know where I got that from.? the filling got thick when it boiled the first time, then I added the yolks and butter and by the time it quickly came back to a thick boil it was done. I put it in the hot crust, and immediately added the meringue. I baked about 20 minutes, to get the crust brown. Sat one hour on a rack and then chilled for 5 hours. It could of done with less  lemon Im sure, but it was really good. Stll passable even with all that lemon. It was an easy recipe and tasted very good, I had no runniness or liquid anywhere. the meringue stayed in tact and was thick and wonderful. Even with a professional kitchen Aid it does take a long time to get the stiff peaks. This one was a winner and will make it again. (with less lemon) lol!!

ok, when I tried to make Lemon Meringue Pie as a teenager, it fell apart and my mother laughed at me. Devastating. 2 decades later, I thought I should address my fears. This recipe is great - if you are a pie novice take particular note of the bit about the pieshell being warm when you add the filling and the filling being warm when you add the meringue, and it is easy. Also follow the instructions about how long to cook the lemon curd. I debuted this at my husband's pie-loving family's Thanksgiving, and (whew!) it was a success. Next I will cook it for my mother...Thanks!

This is truly my Grandmother's pie.  I have not tasted a lemon meringue pie this good since my grandma passed away.  Just the right tang & sweetness combined.  THE BEST!!!  I give this 5 stars

This pie comes out beautifully every time!  This was the 2nd Lemon Meringue Pie recipe I tried from this website, and it's the one we've made over and over.  Thanks for sharing!!

wow, just incredible.  I made to very small changes as I had no fresh lemons and had to use lemon juice and some of my home dried lemon zest. this was just a great pie and so easy.  I used a grahm cracker crust and it added a little extra sweet crunch at the bottem. see changes below.    Ingredients  1 cup white sugar   2 tablespoons all-purpose flour   3 ½ tablespoons cornstarch   1/4 teaspoon salt   ¾ cup water/ ¾ milk  ½ cup lemon juice  ½ tsp lemon zest  2 tablespoons butter   4 egg yolks, beaten   1 (9 inch) pie crust, baked(best if you use a graham cracker crust)

Wonderfull !! Tried it on the weekend for my In-law's 40Th anniversary - Was a big hit with the Father in law his Favorite - Used 1% Milk instead of the water - turned out fantastic! Creamy if you like that.  But I did have to bake longer to get my Meringue to brown. Consistency was great and easy to make. Will be making this again for his b-day in a month!

Great flavor but I think my lemons were too big and it had more juice than needed maybe? Wish the recipe woulod have the lemon juice by ounces.  The problem I had was that the meringue didn't attach to the curd.  I read a lot of the reviews and I made the meringue at the same time as the curd so that once meringue was done the curd was super hot.  Another problem wich you can see in the picture I added is that the pie it self had extra liquid. The curd had good consistency but in between meringue and curd there was liquid?? so confuse as to what could had happened. I have made much better lemon meringues with other recipes.

This was AWFUL.  I've read this over and over again and still can't figure what went wrong, but this was probably the WORST lemon meringue pie I've made.   I try a different recipe each year for my dad's birthday, and I'm not sure what it was, but the flavors didn't blend and the meringue flattened out to almost nothing as it chilled in the fridge.

Four attempts it took me, but I finally did it! My meringue stood on end and the curd was perfect. I had no clue I could make a meringue!  Thank you the Internets for teaching me how to do something I never would have tried. Magnificent!

This was a great recipe.  This is the first lemon meringue I have made and I was very pleased with the results.  I do wish I had read more reviews before making the pie.  I let the curd cool down too much before putting the meringue on top so not only did the meringue separate from the crust on one side but the pie was slightly watery.  Make sure you also cool the pie an hour after baking at room temp then put in the refrigerator for at least 3 hrs to ensure pie has set before cutting.  Also, my 2 lemons yelded about 6oz of lemon juice and it was perfect.  I only put about a teaspoon of zest in the pie.

My first time making any kind of meringue pie. This was AWESOME to say the least. I went exactly as the recipe called for,  no substitutions like others and it was perfect. It will definately be a FAVORITE of ours. My husband love it. The filling was so nice and yellow and thick. No weeping meringue on top. Hats off to you for the recipe!!!

Incredible! Just like my Gram used to make. I follow the recipe to the letter except that I add a tad more lemon flavoring and more lemon zest. I've made this several times and it's usually gone by the end of the day! My hubby absolutely loves this pie (and so do I)!

INCREDIBLE!  Following the advice of others, I substituted milk for the water and I let the pie cool for 1 hour on the counter before refrigerating for at least 3 hours.  To make stiffer meringue, whip the eggs in a bowl that is suspended over simmering water, or that is partially submerged in simmering water.

I made this and my friends loved it! when making a meringue pie be sure to spread the meringue all the way to the crust to be sure that it wont shrink after it cools. That way you'll have a pretty and even meringue over your lemony custard :) YUM!

Emilie, I followed your recipe to the T for a Fourth of July BBQ with my entire family and all I can say is bless your Grandma. This was a hit with everyone who tried it. My husband's family now think that I am a fantastic cook and he even said that this rivaled his mother's strawberry shortcake. Needless to say I am writing this into my cooking notes as my own ha ha...hope your grandma won't mind.

UPDATE:  I baked this pie in the evening and served it the following night.  The crust had turned exceptionally soggy and was rather disgusting as a result.  The taste was still fantastic but soggy crust as a result of the filling isn't a good thing.  The merangue had also started separating from the lemon filling.  I'm not sure if this is a normal lemon meringue pie issue but it wasn't very pretty.   ORIGINAL REVIEW: I really liked this recipe with regard to taste but it makes absolutely no mention as to how long you should let it cool for and how (ie. in fridge or not).  I ended up cooling it for about an hour on a rack and then cooling it further in the fridge overnight.  I was concerned about it being runny (liquid kept running all over the place during the cooling process as all my floors are very uneven in my vintage apartment so I actually had to get a level out to find the most even place in on floor and cooled it on a table in the middle of the hall) so I tried a piece this morning and it was fantastic.  It set properly but the meringue had shrunk quite a bit although I think that this may have been my fault due to not beating long enough.  Also, a lot of users said 3/4 cup of lemon juice.  I got a lot more than that out of my two lemons but it wasn't too tart at all so I was happy.  Overall, good recipe but a few things needed clarification.  Will make it again.

Very good I looked a close to fifteen different recipies befor I found this one. This was the only one I made. I used the Cream cheese tart shells by Glenda on this site to make mini single serving Lemon Meringue tarts. I used the zest off a lemon to mellow it out some they were great!

I'm not a very good baker and I made lots of mistakes.  The meringue beaded.  I'd try it again since it did have good flavor though.

OK, I just used the lemon part of the recipe for a pie I created.  It was perfect, tart, smooth, clean tasting.  Will make again.

I guess this recipe did the job. it turned out too sour and lemon-y for me though. too bad i didn't make that change to decrease the amount of juice and zest.. i would have enjoyed it much better.

Excellent recipe. Next time I will make 1 1/2 times the filling. My pie pan might have been a 10" rather than 9". I like lots of filling. Meringue- I added 1/4 tsp cream of tartar to it. I made the meringue before the filling as one person suggested. The meringue didn't hold such stiff peaks when put on the pie. It wasn't a hot day but maybe with the oven on it was  a little warm for it. Next time I will beat it while the filling is cooking. I used 2 rather large lemons which yeilded about 1/2 cup juice. Very tasty.

I thought this recipe was really good, my husband and dad loved it. The only change that I made was I did use milk instead of water. I cooked the filling for about 14 mins like one reviewer said after I added the butter and it came to a boil again I turned it down. The meringue did really good and I was surprised because I have always used cream of tartar in the others I have made but it did wonderfully. I know that I will be making this many many more times especially since Lemon Meringue Pie is my dads favorite dessert.

Phenomenal and easy to follow recipe. My first time making lemon meringue pie, and it came out GREAT the first time! My boyfriend thought it was to die for. The term "juice of 2 lemons" can be a bit misleading; the second time I made the recipe I used more lemon juice (still two lemons!) and it came out WAY too tart. Just a bit of warning! Other than that, and the tips on the site, it was great! Thanks for sharing!

I have never made a lemon meringue pie before but this one was excellent. The only thing I changed was putting 1/2 tsp. cream of tartar and a 1/2 tsp. vanilla into the meringue to keep it from weeping, though it still did...a little. Definitely deserving of 5 stars.

This pie was so good, and very easy. Make sure to use every bit of the meringue and spread it ALL the way across the crust - not even the very edges should be visible! It seems like way too much, but the meringue will shrink and weep and you will need every bit you've got. Here is my tip for saving time and trauma: I made the pie (minus the meringue) and put it in the fridge overnight. The next day, a few hours before serving, I reheated the pie in the oven while I whipped up the meringue, then topped and browned it. That way, you can avoid all the "issues" you run into with a typical meringue - topping it while piping hot, storing on counter/refrigerating, etc etc. Thanks for a keeper!

I was really looking forward to this pie and I was so disappointed. The meringue turned out very well but I did not like the lemon filling taste. I am thinking I may have added too much lemon zest. There was also a lot of liquid in between the meringue and filling.

This was my first lemon meringue pie, and it was a success! I labored over when to put the meringue on the lemon filling, as well as whether or not to refrigerate the pie. I decided to put the meringue on when the filling was piping hot, and not to put the pie in the fridge, and my co-workers raved about it. Also, I used milk instead of water, which made the filling more creamy in consistency.

This would've gotten a 5 if the directions explained the cooling process.
This is my first time making meringue, and lemon pie for that matter.
The lemon filling turned out great. I used 3/4 cup of lemon juice instead of using real lemons and zest (not a big fan of the texture of zest). I wasn't sure how thick the mixture should be on the stove before putting it in to the crust, so I just guessed. It was a thick pudding consistency which seemed to be good.
The flavor was very tart and very good w/ the shortbread pie crust.
The meringue gave me some trouble. This is my first serious attempt and meringue, and it was SO fun making it. However, I wish I knew how to keep it from weeping so much. I attempted to make the meringue twice, both times, weeping like crazy that turned the pie crust soggy (still tasted ok though).

I might make this again but only when I learn how to keep meringue from oozing so much heh.

great recipe. Used juice of 3 lemons and used only 2 lemons zested. Also used milk in place of water. Only  brought to a boil to add to eggs and boiled for about 2  minutes after adding the yolks back to the sauce pan, sauce was nice and thick. Taste was amazing. Husbands favorite pie is lemon and he loved this one.

I don't personally eat lemon mirangue pie, but I got LOTS of compliments on this recipe.  I used my own recipe for the crust and just made the lemon custard and mirangue according to this recipe.  It was apparently wonderful.

Wow!  Out of five pies tonight for Thanksgiving, this was the only pie that was gone by the end of the night.  Easy to make and delicious.  I did make a few changes such as adding 1/2 tsp. cream of tarter and 1/2 tsp. vanilla to the meringue and also substituted lemon extract and a little lemon juice (from a bottle) for the fresh squeezed lemon juice and I did not put in the lemon zest.  I will be making this pie again and again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this today and almost all of the pie is gone. It was a HUGE hit! The only different thing I did was add the juice and zest of one more lemon. It was great! I highly recommend it. It is easy to make and tastes great! This is my new go to recipe for lemon meringue!

I followed some of the other readers suggestions and increased the serving size to 12 so I would get proportionately more filling for my deep dish tray.  However, I did think that increasing the meringue was a little much for my taste.  My pie did weep a little.  I learned from another website that the filling has to be really hot (mine was) and that you have to make sure the meringue is totally cooked.  the weeping is from egg white seepage.  Wonderful recipe - will make again and again.  I felt like a rock star!!!

ok so i made this for my dad's b-day just yesterday and he absolultey loved it!!! I personally prefer mine with a little more lemon but he said that it was perfect. I had to use seven small lemons to get a 1/2 cup of lemon juice and didn't have any problem with the filling getting thick enough. This recipe is definetley a keeper, thanks

This is THE recipe. As long as you know how to do meringue (i.e. warm pie shell, warm filling, then top etc) then this is it. The filling is perfect b/c it's not that mucky sweet stuff you buy in the store or find in some recipes. It has some tartness to it, which, if we're being frank, is what MAKES a lemon meringue pie what it is! Thanks so much for posting this recipe. Oh, and by the way - my dad who is a pie lover told me that this pie was better then his own mothers - and my dad just doesnt say stuff like that! I almost cried. Again - THIS IS IT!

This was an excellent recipe. It had a great lemon flavor. I made this for Father's Day for my husband. We enjoyed it. What I liked about this recipe from the one I have used in the past is that I did not need to hurry to get the meringue done while the filling was still hot. Made it much easier. I also used the Meringue II recipe from this website. It was recommended by other reviews. I would that recipe again as well. I will be making this again:)

This was my first lemon meringue pie ever, well, really my first pie ever. I was very impressed. It came out perfect! I got everything ready before hand, so I could hurry. I used the recipe for Meringue II instead of this meringue, it was awesome!

Fist time cooking a Lemon Pie and it turned out perfect.  I did not have fresh lemon on hand so I used 1/2 cup of lemon juice and a tsp of lemon flavoring as suggested by another reviewer.  I also used the recipe for "meringue II" from this site as suggested.  It turned out great.  I have never made a meringe before and was suprised that it came out perfect on the first try.  Next time I may try a little less lemon juice.  This is a great recipe.

Not like my grandma used to make! It was too sweet and the lemon flavor was faint. The filling tasted "eggy" to me.

This is a great recipe.I used 1/2 cup lemon juice and 1 tsp lemon extract because I didn't have any lemons on hand.It was just the right amount of tartness.The meringue did weep but that doesn't bother me.It was a beautiful pie.My husband really loved it.Lemon meringue is one of his favorites.Thanks for the recipe.It really had the old fashioned taste.

Great!!! I put in 3 small lemons instead of 2 regular size and was too lemony. Put in 2 lemons!!! Other than that it was so good, and I have given 5 stars because it would have been perfect, without my mistake. Will definately make again.

This was wonderful!  I just made one small change and that was to add 1/2 tsp of cream  of tarter to the meringue.  I followed the cooling directions from other posters.  It not only tasted great but looked wonderful too!  If I was making this for company I would make it the morning of because after a night in the fridge it didn't look as pretty.  I will be making this again!

This was my first time making lemon meringue pie.  I don't care for it myself, but it's my roommate's favorite so I made it to surprise her.  I did everything as stated in the recipe with the exception of whipping up some lemon juice in the meringue to compliment that of the custard. It ended up tasting fantastic! For someone who doesn't like LMP, I thought it was great and my roommate said it was the best she's ever had. I did make the mistake of (apparently) not sealing a part of the meringue to the crust and when I took it out of the oven, it leaked sticky stuff ALL over the counter as it was cooling. I don't know what happened!  ...but apparently it didn't make a difference because it turned out wonderfully.

The directions could have been much clearer. For example, the sugar/lemon sauce begins to boil, then you add butter, but how long do you stir until sauce thickens? I stirred for 8 minutes and it still came out watery. 
Also, "whipping" the egg whites - I thought this meant with a fork or wisk but after 10 mins, still too runny. Was this supposed to be done with a mixer and if so, is cream of tarter a good ingredient to add? 
I put the pie in the fridge to speed up the cooling. The meringue shrank and formed dark drops on it. 
Will try another recipe.

Lemon meringue pie has always been my favorite pie. This was my first attempt at baking one, followed the directions to the "T" and it came out great! Definitely cool and refrigerate before slicing. Emilie S., thanks for the recipe.

Super fab recipe! So easy to make as well as eat. I used golden caster sugar, which gave it a brownish tinge, but really didn't spoil it's appearance. I also split the recipe into two, and ended up with about half a cup leftover filling which I will be using for sandwiches, yummy! Will definitely be making this one again!

I made this pie today for my Dad since Mom hasn't made a homeade pie in a while, and it came out FABULOUS!  The recipe is so easy to follow, although I did alter a bit.  I used 1 1/2c sugar, 3 oz lemon juice, plus zest and juice from one lemon.  I also added 1 tsp of lemon extract, and 1 tsp of vanilla extract.  The meringue turned out perfect using a mixer.  This is definitely going into my recipe book.

Unbelievably good!! I tried making a lemon meringue pie last year (I am a newlywed and my husband would starve w/out this site) and it just did not work out! This recipe was easy to follow and the end product was amazing! I used one of the reviews to help me w/the meringue. Even though I have a kitchen aid I could not get it to form peaks. I added the 1/4tsp cream of tarter and 1/4 tsp vanilla and what do you know.. PEAKS FORMED! Thanks so much Grandma! I will be making this pie for my family for years to come :)

My wife is a Lemon Meringue nut! She'd rather have Lemon Meringue than a cake on her birthday, and this is the recipe that I use. It maintains it's consistency and doesn't seem to melt like other pies I've made. I don't use the lemon zest, but I do kick in a little extra lemon juice, and a few dots of food coloring to get that nice yellow color. I like the idea of using a lemon extract, and I'll have to try that! Thanks!

Great pie. Filling thickened but there was still water/liquid in the bottom of my pie pan when i cut into the pie. It's very humid where I live and I ended up adding an extra 2 tablespoons of sugar to the egg whites (even though there were no traces of yolk) so that they could form peaks. My friends and family enjoyed this pie. Recipe is a keeper.

I have made a few lemon meringue pies before and this one was great! The only change I would make would be to make a day ahead, as we found the texture to be better the next day. (I did serve it cold after 6 hours in the fridge, but it just needed more time).  I added 1/2 cup lemon juice and it was PERFECT (no zest).  I added all the sugar called for, but only 1 1/4 cups water, which was the only mistake I made.  I should have added the full 1 1/2 cups water. Either way, it turned out fantastic and looks very impressive.

Wonderful recipe. For those who like a tart pie, I recommend substituting a half cup of the 1 1/2 cups water with lemon juice (this is in addition to the juice/zest of 2 lemons).

This is perfect lemon meringue pie.  Easy and a fantastic result!  Use Meyer lemons if you can get them.  The juice is so much sweeter and better for baked goods.

I really did not care for this pie. I followed directions exactly as they were stated. I noticed the lemon filling did not have enough flavor and the meringue tasted good, but didn't come out as expected.

Very, very good recipe.  I followed it more or less with exceptional results.
I would say that I used a bit over a half cup of lemon juice.  For those who don't care for zest, I urge you to rethink.  Grandma probably didn't have a lemon zester, but a box type grater and she most likely used that.  I zested three lemons using the coarser side on the box grater, and the pie is very lemony, but no hunks of zest.
This is a keeper for sure.

Made no changes and had no trouble with the meringue and filling set beautifully, but it is very sweet, a bit much for me.

My husband is a huge fan of lemon meringue pie, and this one won the biggest thumbs-up.  Don't be afraid to cook the filling for awhile after the yolks are in.  Let it get nice and thick.  Tastes better (caramelization), and sets better.  I followed the suggestion to add a bit of sugar and vanilla.

This really doesn't need another review but I have to add my two cents.  It is delicious!  I made no changes and my husband, who considers himself a pie critic, LOVED it! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This cake was awesome!  However, my one complaint: I put the zest of 2 lemons in, and every few bites, I would find a zest shaving in my mouth, which I did not enjoy...but excellent overall!

I followed an earlier suggestion to increase the filling serving size to 12 ... sadly that just left me with an even greater amount of very runny filling!!  It tasted lovely, very lemony, but I think the instructions need to be a little clearer on how long to cook the filling/how thick it should get before going in the oven... mine looked reasonably thick on the stove, but in retrospect should have been cooked a fair bit longer. It also made the crust very soggy... I'm not sure where the fault lay in that, as I was using a ready made crust. The meringue part turned out pretty well, although it did separate despite my best efforts to seal the edges.  In summary, a good flavor but more details with respect to timing would be very helpful.

So easy!  I always thought that lemon meringue pie would be complicated but this was a snap.  Took less than 30 minutes from start to finish.  The only thing I wish the recipe mentioned was how much lemon juice.  My lemons were sort of stingy- only about 1/3 c. out of two lemons.  I made sure to get about a tablespoon of zest in the custard.  Yum!

This is one of the best lemon pie recipes I have ever had.  Everyone loved it.  I used the basic lemon filling part of the recipe and did use the suggestions by others and used milk instead of water.  I also did not use the flour and made the filling thicker by using 4 tablespoons of corn starch.  Then I used Meringue II for the topping and that was just perfect.

This was just what I was looking for in a lemon pie. Perfect flavor. I did not add the lemon zest, just because I dont care for them. It was a little time consuming to prepare, but very worth it in the end. This is the only reason I rated it a 4 rather than a 5. All in all this is a great recipe and will be my only lemon pie recipe from now on. Thanks for sharing!!

Update: two thumbs up! Hubby had 3 pieces, and for someone who doesn't like desserts all that much, that says alot! Thanks for the great pie! This is going in my recipe file... Original review:I wanted to make my husband a lemon meringue pie, since that is his favorite pie, and he was soooo sweet to me for Valentine's Day...flowers, house cleaned, dinner and breakfast...anyway, he waits every year for his mom to make him one for Thanksgiving, so I thought I would break tradition and surprise him with one. I had a pie crust and some lemons leftover from the BC Lemon chess pie, so I attempted it. I was soooo afraid I really messed this one up---forgot to bake the pie shell, forgot to out the butter in it---but it seemed to work out. I tasted the filling and it was awesome! Will update if he likes it, fingers crossed! (:

Tasts great, however I have had the problem that the filling needs to go in the fridge to become stiff enough, which tends to cause the meringue to fall. Perhaps adding more corn starch and/or cooking the filling longer would help.

I LOVE THIS PIE!  It is very simple to make and always turns out perfect.  I have not had any of the problems the other reviewers mention.  I follow the recipe exactly, but I use all organic ingredients.  I also use 1/2 cup lemon juice (can be two to four lemons, depending on size).  This makes for a deliciously tart pie.

My boyfriend declared that this is the best pie he's ever had. The filling is out of this world. Not to sweet with just the right amount of tartness. My only complaint is that the meringue was a little sloppy (I even added cream of tartar and that didn't help). The next time I make this I will take the advice of some other reviewers and use a different meringue recipe.

Looks great, tastes great! Took the advice to add vanilla extract, add meringue to hot curd, and substitute water for milk. Thanks so much for posting the recipe.

Turns out, meringue is not my friend.  It never really got stiff and separated from the pie filling...it was also quite weepy.  The lemon filling itself was pretty good...but I've had better.  Probably won't make this one again.

The lemon pie filling was too watery, so cornstarch was added to thicken it.  And I agree with others that the meringue was weepy.  I added cream of tartar.  This wasn't the best lemon pie recipe, but it wasn't bad, either.

This pie was totally awesome!  I doubled the lemon zest just because I like my pie extra tart.  I did not use this merangue recipe though, I used another one on this site.

bf didn't like the pie, thought the texture was too much like flan, which he hates. also, you really need an electric mixer for the meringue, it came out watery doing it by hand. omitted the lemon zest and the lemony flavor was still strong. used a small/med sized lemon and a large one.

This recipe is fantastic!  I made it for my friend whose favorite dessert is lemon meringue pie and will keep this recipe for the next time she visits.  The only thing I'd change is to maybe adjust the amounts as it was a little thin for my deep dish pie pan.  I used Meringue II by Saundra and it turned out great!  This is a keeper!

I used this recipe for the filling, but not the meringue as I've found my meringues tend to weep when made with only egg whites and sugar (instead used Meringue II).  The lemon filling is fantastic!  Not too sweet, not too tart and it slices beautifully.  Thanks Grandma!

It was my first try for Lemon Meringue Pie, and it was the best I've ever had.  My husband agrees! I did make the meringue first, and I do believe it made the process easier.  No running, and it tasted simply divine!

I am disappointed at the way this pie turned out. The filling is good, but my meringue is terribly weepy. I poured off at least 1/4 cup, and my crust is soaked! Directions don't say to put the meringue on immediately after pouring the filling into the crust.I guess it sat too long, while I made the meringue. How can I avoid this? Make the meringue before I start making the filling?

This pie is delicious and not overly difficult to make. I have a hard time judging how long to cook the filling, though, and it's hard not to overcool the meringue. But for a beginning cook like me, this recipe was a real find, and my family absolutely loved it!

The lemon filling was delicious and better than anything else I've ever had or tasted.  The meringue beaded and perspired.  Perhaps the author could include tips as how to prevent that from happening.  It was my first lemon meringue pie and overall is was delicious!  It's even great without the meringue!

This pie tastes soooo good! I too thought it was really tart, but I like that. Some of the people who ate it didn't though, so I would probably use only one lemon next time as well. My lemons were not big either. Also, used 3 egg yolks instead of 4 like someone suggested, and even after refridgeration, it still didn't completely firm up. It was pretty soft and a little fragile. Maybe it was because I didn't use that 4th egg yolk, or maybe it just needs more cornstarch or something.

I too made this for my husband - he loves pie - I love cake! This was my 2nd attempt at pie (first one blackberry and terrible!) and I must say this was a pretty tough one to start my pie making career with but I'm proud to say I did it! The reviews said to use 1/4 to 1/2 cup of lemon juice and I got a little more than 1/4 cup out of my 3 small lemons (heated up in microwave to get more juice) and that was just fine. My only problem was the crust - I'm going to have to work on that a lot more! Despite the fact is was too thick and too sweet, my husband still said it was the best lemon meringue pie he's ever had. If I can do it, anyone can! Thanks Grandma!

great pie- I fixed it per the recipe and it was too tart, so after reading the reviews I used milk instead of water and measured the lemon juice to just over 1/4 cup per pie and it turned out great- great recipe just needed some tweeking.

This was my first attempt at a lemon meringue pie.  I made two (did not double), so pie #2 is better than the first.  I learned - added more lemon juice to make 1/2 cup for better flavor, added pinch of cream of tartar to meringue, and whipped the meringue forever.  A bit runny, but maybe beacuse I cut it too soon and it wasn't cooled yet.

I made this filing for a lemon cheescake recipe. I was so proud of how great if was because everyone I know makes lemon pie filing from a box. I told everyone it was from scratch!!! I added a few drops of yellow food colouring but followed it to a T! Thanks it was awesome - better than the box.

This is the first lemon meringue pie I have made from scratch.  I "hand picked" my lemons (Myers lemons) from my lemon tree here in FL and the pie was excellent.  However, I might want to cut back a little on the surgar since Myers lemons are a bit on the sweet side.  However, my husband loved it.

Hmmmm....well, the inside of this pie was wonderful but for some reason I could not get the meringue to cooperate with me. I tried it twice and neither time would it stiffen up. Not sure what I could have done wrong...especially since I did it twice. The pie hit the trash.

I have tried this recipe twice now and am still perfecting it to try to get it to a 5 star rating. I followed the directions almost exactly the first time and it was a bit too tart for our taste so the second time I only zested one lemon. That was much better but I am still playing with the right amount of lemon juice. Juicing two medium lemons with an automatic juicer resulted in almost a whole cup of lemon juice which was a bit too much even though the pie was not runny. I have found that whisking the 1/4 cup hot sugar mixture into the egg yolks before adding them to the remaining mixture really helps the pie to set up well. The first time I didn't do this and the pie had some juice under the crust. My only other problem is with the meringue. It looks beautiful when the pie is finished and tastes great, but after being in the refrigerator for several hours the  meringue becomes sticky and makes the pie difficult to slice.  All in all I think that this is a very good recipe. There is never going to be a lemon  meringue pie that will be worth five stars to everyone since many people like different degrees of tartness. You just need to take a good recipe and tweak it until you get just the right degree of tartness for you. This is one of the best lemon pies recipies that I have tried.

Disappointed. I took the advise of other reviewers and used milk (whole milk) instead of water. I also added cream of tartar to the meringue. It came out incredibly runny!! :( I actually had to drain this pie after it was done. There was a lake of liquid on top. I have no idea what went wrong other than the recipe doesn't indicate what size lemons and mine were large (two). If I did try this again, which I'm not convinved I will, I would probably put in less lemon juice since mine seemed to yield about 3/4 to 1 cup. Other than that, I am totally clueless. For the crust I used someone's suggestion here of making the "Butter Flaky Pie Crust" (yes, flakey is misspelled in the title of the recipe) but that just baked like . The entire crust shrinks and you get large, and I'm talking LARGE, bubbles heaping up after baking. Then the entire thing was soaked with the lemon filling. Blah.

Unbelievable! I made it for my boyfriend's family this past thanksgiving and it was a total hit! They loved it and so did I...everyone was fighting over the last pieces. I should have made two...man this recipe is delicious. In fact, I'm starting to crave a pie right now. Plus, the ingredients are just too simple and they are things you'd carry in your house anyway. Make this with confidence.

Mmmm!  Perfect!  I wouldn't make any changes to this one (except to use milk instead of water), but I do have some tips and suggestions.  Strain the seeds and even the pulp of the lemons.  It is so much less stress this way, and your filling will be more decadent.  Make the meringue in the glass or metal bowl after you pour in the filling. It's okay if the filling cools, but it's not as okay to let your merinque dry out while you're waiting for the filling to cook.  And if you want the hefty poof of meringue like you see in the store-bought pies, I'd whip up a couple more egg whites. I adore this pie!  And the meringue was just picture-perfect coming out of the oven!

Easy to do and very lemony in flavor. It could have to do with the size of lemon I used. Make sure you really whip the egg whites to a stiff peak!

Hmmm. I have been anxious to try this recipe for a while now. My husband LOVES lemon meringue and I make it at least once a month! I am from Europe and find American desserts on the sweet side. Alas this one was no different. I used 2 fresh lemons and measured over 1/4 cup juice. The meringue was a little looser than my normal recipe. It was tasty, I grant that! But it didn't hold itself anywhere near my normal recipe and it was a lot sweeter and creamier. I guess it depends on your taste! Bottom line is my husband asked me to go back to my own recipe. I would amend this recipe by adding a tad of white wine vinegar to the meringue to allow it stiffen a bit better and I would use free range eggs to get the more yellow color and a little less sugar. I also used milk in it which I think made it softer. I'll stick with water next time.

This was great! One addition - I made the filling in a glass bowl in the microwave instead of on the stove.  It worked just fine.  Just heat on high and stir every couple minutes.

Wonderful, (deceptively) light pie.. I used a plain crust at first but wasn't satisfied with its flavour. Goes better a richer crust (i used one that called for two yolks). Still, a very flexible and easy recipe! The lemon filling was firm enough so I could make lemon meringue bars instead. I found the amount of filling just right, but many friends who tasted it suggested using half to two-thirds the amount of filling.

Perfect. I used 1/2 cup lemon juice instead of the fresh lemons because I did not have them on hand. I like my lemon desserts to be tart which is why I went with that particular amount. I will make this again!

This Pie had all the wonderful flavor that you expect from a Lemon Meringue Pie.  It just did not have enough filling.  I would increase the amount of filling by half again.

I had bad luck with this recipe.  I'm going to try it again, though.  I added two more lemons to make tart enough.  It didn't set for me, and the meringue didn't billow.  It tasted great.

This was my first shot ever at homemade lemon meringue pie and it turned out pretty good.  I didn't have fresh lemons so I used 1/2 cup lemon juice.  I really enjoy the contrast of the tartness with the sweet meringue, but for those of you who don't like it so tart, I would suggest cutting down on the lemon juice.  I also added some yellow food coloring to the lemony part because a reviewer had said that the color was almost opaque and I thought that would be odd.  Overall, pretty easy to make and very good.  Will make again from time to time.

I had mixed results with this pie. I used 1/2 cup lemon juice, and it did taste great. The color and texture, however, was not what I'm used to. Maybe I'm just not used to homemade lemon meringue pies, but the filling was much more opaque than I've had in restaurants. Also, it was very viscous in consistency, making it hard to eat. Sorry, but my search goes on...

The pie was alright, but the filling was a little too sweet. I added about 1/3 of a cup of lemon juice. I used milk instead of the water. My meringue was pretty good except I ran out of regular sugar so I had to subsitute it for confec. sugar, and I had to beat it forever. There was also a lot of liquid between the meringue and the lemon filling which I had to drain, but my graham cracker crust got kinda soggy on one side. I probably wouldn't make this again because it's pretty time-consuming.

This is a fantastic and reliable recipe.  I have never made pie before, and it was so easy and popular that I have made 4 since then by request in just two weeks!  It captures and enhances the lemon flavor well, is not too sweet, and is very creamy and just the right texture.

Delicious! I don't like pastry crusts, so I used a premade graham cracker crust and it absorbed some of the moisture, but was otherwise terrific!! I used milk as well, and didn't have to thicken much after the eggs were added. This is a wonderful, easy, delicious recipe!

This was the first time I had ever even tried to make a Lemon Meringue Pie and my Hubby was so pleased with how I did.  My Mother had said it was hard to make this type of pie but she must not have had this good and this easy of a recipe to use when she tried it.

This is a great recipe.  My husband's favorite pie!  We were in Florida, and used fresh lemons from a neighbors tree!  Yummy!

I loved this pie.  It came out perfect, no runniness or pulling away like the other recipes described.  I did use all natural/organic ingredients (such as Florida Crystals) so maybe that explains it.

The lemon filling was great. However, as I noticed a few others had mentioned, the meringue pulled away from the pie and shrunk. There was a lot of water under the meringue and above the filling that had to be drained off once cooled.

As soon as it came out of the oven it was beautiful! But, as others had said when it started to cool the meringue pulled away from the crust and there was ALOT of extra liquid underneath. Other than that it tasted very good.

I am so glad I found this recipe.  I loved the results I got from it.  It tasted great.  The meringue did come away very slightly from the crust as it cooled and there was a very small amount of juice between the meringue and the lemon filling, but I still loved it!  Great with the sweet short pastry recipe on this site. (By Nori Salisbury)

I really liked it but thought it needed more tartness.  Next time I am going to add a little more lemon juice.  My kids liked it too.  This was the first time I ever made lemon meringue and I was really pleased with the results.

My 1st attempt at a meringue pie. The meringue pulled away from the crust after cooling, and there was liquid seeping between the meringue and the lemon filling. The flavor was fine.

This recipe was wonderful.  I was really suprised at how easy it was to make and how well it came out.  I would add that you should not try to make the Meringue without an electric mixer.  MY ARM was KILLING ME!  It's a great recipe :)

MY husband loves lemon meringue pie, but I am not a big fan.  All the other recipes we haved used have been runny or fake tasting.  THis is the best lemon meringue pie I have ever tasted...I ate 2 pieces in a row!  Really yummy, eggy meringue.

For a first-timer, it was easier than I expected. I always heard stories about how difficult it was to make, but the only difficult part was the egg whites. They didn't form peaks like it said it should, but it tasted fantastic either way. Highly impressed with the outcome, and I would definitely make it again.

First time making a lemon meringue pie and this recipe was super easy to follow. I did make my own crust and prebake it and I did have to use three lemons instead since I juiced them just by hand. All in all it turned out great!

My husband loves lemon pie. So I gave this one a shot. My ONLY suggestion would be this. If you’re using larger lemons, then two should be plenty. My lemons were smaller, so I used three and the flavor is amazing!

What did I do wrong? I followed the recipe completely. Now that it is cooling it is creating a syrup along the edges of the pie. So sad!

The filling was perfect but I was using white cane sugar for the frosting. I must have tried to wip the mixture for an hour and wasn’t able to bring it to peak. Any advise? Good recipe but maybe need to try a different method for the frosting.

This recipe is excellent! My first time making a lemon meringue pie, the recipe is easy to follow with simple steps. It is truly a hit with the family. I did not change a thing just followed the recipe to a T and the results were perfect.

This recipe seemed intimidating the first time I made it but now I have made it four times since Thanksgiving.  What a keeper and so delicious!!  My daughter requested it for her "birthday cake" this year!

I made it but my lemons were bigger than store bought lemons because i have a lemon tree so it was a little tart so next time im adding 1 more cup of sugar other than that it turned out perfect. Will make this again.

No changes at all.  I only chopped about 2 Tbsp of the lemon rind in with the juice for the "zest." It was perfect! Great recipe! I will definitely make it again!

I added more fresh lemon  juice than what the recipe called for originally.  I used the juice of 3 lemons.  
It actually helped enhance the flavor.

Now that I've nearly mastered the art of pie crust, it's an opportunity to try some new flavors. Back in the day, the only food I craved when I was pregnant was my mother's lemon merangue pie. Now I can recreate it with this recipe! It was spot on and my husband thought it the best lemon pie he'd ever eaten.

Delicious would recommend baking less time the outer layer of meringue had a little crackle, was still creamy and foamy underneath.

substituted some milk for water.  I think I overfilled the crust, as even thought the meringue was completely across and "sealed" to the edges, it pulled away as it was cooling.  I think it didn't have enough surface area in contact with the crust

I made this exactly the way the recipe said, and it was fantastic. For me, the lemon curd thickened before I'd even added the egg, so I didn't wait for it to get to a very impressive boil after because I didn't want to burn something. Set up just great. Definitely a keeper recipe!

This was a delicious pie.  However, in making I juiced the 2 lemons as instructed and I guess the lemons were too large and my filling did not thicken like it should have.  But is was still gooood.  The meringue came out DELICIOUS.
I am waiting now to complete and hope although, it is not thicken like it was supposed to be, it will be ok.
I am going to try this again, again.

I followed this recipe exactly as shown and was worried about the curd because apparently I over mixed it. So upon reading the reviews I realized I cooked it too long. Second attempt with the curd turned out wonderfully. The meringue was easy to do and very light. Excellent taste and I love lemon pie. This recipe is a keeper.

If you like lemon meringue pie you are going to love this.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect every time.  Be patient with the meringue as it takes about 15 mins. to fully form.  I am all about easy recipes and this one was definitely easy.

This was the first lemon meringue I've made and it turned out very well. I would definitely recommend letting it cool in the fridge for at least 2 hours. While it will set up nicely after baking and cooling on the counter,  having it chilled adds to the overall experience.

This was my first attempt at lemon meringue pie, per my daughter's Thanksgiving request. It was a last minute decision, so I got the first recipe I could find, but I'm so glad it was this one! This was perfect! It had the best level of tartness from the lemon and held together beautifully. I had leftover meringue from another recipe (which uses cornstarch to hold it together!), so I don't know how well the one included in this recipe would work, but the filling was fantastic! Will definitely be using this again!

As others have mentioned, I substituted milk (2%) for water. I also added extra lemon juice (I had some previously juiced on hand) for a total of about 4 oz. It had the perfect amount of lemon flavor, I would not have wanted any less. I will be making this again. I should mention it was my first attempt at making a lemon meringue pie. I am very pleased how easy this recipe was to follow and execute. I thought it'd be more difficult than this.

I loved this recipe. It turned out totally fabulous. Perfect for thanksgiving.  The one thing I will say was that the part about adding the yolk was a tad bit confusing. I, to tell the truth just poured it in gradually into the sugar, flour, salt, and cornstarch mix. Maybe that was what you were supposed to do!!!

This was a great recipe!
I made a few changes to make the flavour richer, lower in carbs and more lemony by using the juice and zest of an additional lemon and cutting back the water. I also tripled the butter and substituted processed sugar for erythritol at a 1:1 ratio to reduce the sweetness by 30%. I like my pies a little more tart. Finally I used a vanilla wafer crust instead of traditional pie crust. It came out sublime. We devoured it straight out of the oven, couldn't even wait for it to cool

I used 1/4 cup cornstarch INSTEAD of the flour and cornstarch called for and I used a gluten-free pie crust.  Delicious and it works for someone on a gluten-free diet.

OMG--- This lemon meringue pie was fabulous! The only thing  that was changed was that my lemons were small so I used 4 of them, which was a perfect amount with the zest from all of these lemons. ( We love a good lemon-y taste!) . Other than the lemons, everything else in the recipe stayed the same. I did take the eggs out of the fridge about 30-45 minutes before using. My husband and I scraped every last bit of pie off our plates and wished we could have more, but we can look forward to it tomorrow.

First time making Lemon Meringue pie!  I love to bake and most of my extended family is gluten free/dairy free for medical reasons. I love the challenge of making things that as close to the original as possible. The results were really good but the filling was still not as firm as I would have liked. I will list the alterations I made and then the alterations I plan on making to my next pie.

I have never made a meringue pie in my life until one day I promised my pops (chef in the army many years ago) I'd make one. Was absolutely nervous in case he didn't like it. After searching around for a recipe, I came across this one and decided to use it.  OMG, I received 11/10 for it and was over the moon. I have done 4 more since as requests coming in from family member. Yesterday I tried oranges instead and it was amazing!
Thank you so much for this recipe.

My very first go at such a pie.  I got a little nervous when the meringue wouldn't stiffen but then all of a sudden chemistry did its thing and poof.
A big hit with all who tried it.  Very tangy

It turned out really good.  I used a little less sugar and it was still very sweet so will use even lesser sugar and more lemon next time coz we like it tart.

I followed the directions exactly as stated. Turned out wonderful. Only exception is that there was a little bit of liquid around it. I tipped the pie to pour it into the sink so it wasn't so much. The custard and meringue was wonderful though.

Fantastic recipe!  I took a few pieces of advice from the reviews, which I think made a big difference, especially putting the meringue on the lemon curd while the curd was still hot.  I also avoided using plastic wrap. I let the pie cool for about an hour and then put it in the fridge for another hour.  There was excess liquid and it held together better than any lemon meringue pie I've ever made.  A lot of the reviews recommend using milk.  I used water and was very happy with how it turned out- I plan to stick with that.  Next time I will increase the curd portion of the recipe by 50%- that's the only thing I plan to change.

I’ve never made a lemon meringue pie before... and I was genuinely surprised at the ease of directions. I didn’t get the height of the meringue that I expected but I think I needed to whip it more or something. But it was delicious and I will use this recipe again

This is a really simple and delicious pie.  Personally I think I would add a little less lemon zest and a little more juice.  I also took advice of someone and let the filling completely cool before adding the meringue.

Delicious! This was my first lemon meringue pie, and I nailed it with this recipe! Will definitely make again. Husband and kids loved it. I tweaked it slightly--used 1 1/4 cup sugar, 3 1/2 Tbs of cornstarch (ended up adding a smidge more). Beat the egg whites until they had stiff peaks, then baked according to the instructions. Let it sit on the counter to cool for an hour. Then put it in the fridge. It came out perfectly. No runny filling, no water, no meringue pulling away from the crust. Perfection.

I’m making this tight now.  I’m experienced so baking a crust was expected and I debated various.  Settled on a crisco recipe foe one crust.  As always, when I make a recipe the first time I stick pretty close to the recipe.  It’s setting now, and I tasted the custard...exactly what I wanted.  Now for the topping...

Great recipe. My first attempt in making lemon merengue. It got rave reviews from family and guests. My only change was to add 1/4 tsp cream of tartar to the egg whites.

I have finally found the Lemon Meringue Pie recipe that brings back the joy of Lemon Meringue pie from my youth.  As some members of the family are on low carb or diabetic:
I used granulated monk fruit instead of sugar for the filling.  I used Splenda for the meringue.  It came out delicious.   Served it at a family party and everyone including the sugar eaters enjoyed it.  It got rave reviews from all. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you for posting this recipe.

Made recipe exactly as posted. The consistency was runny, like a thick soup. Instead of the gel-like consistency I expected. Tasty, but I won't make it again.

It's a good recipe. The zest doesn't dissolve well no matter how much stirring you do. You taste it with with each bite.

The pie was very good and the meringue very tasty. I did not alter the recipe at all since it was my first attempt making a lemon meringue pie. The only problem I had was that the meringue flattened out. I let it sit out for an hour after baking and for 6 hours in the refrigerator.

I love this recipe, I just had to redo the filling because in the video wasn't detailed enough and you have to separate the eggs before you start to boil the mixture so you can put it in right away. What I did because I was just following the recipe after I made the gel-like consistency for the filling I started to separate the eggs while the filling was still boiling so when I poured the eggs in and started mixing it went from the gel to a liquid form again. But when I re did it it was perfect, so kudos for that!

Perfect.  i add water to my lemon juice to make the desired amount of water since it does not state the # of cups of lemon juice.  Works perfect.  Also I make triple this recipe for 2 9 inch pies and it is the perfect amount.

This is the exact Lemon Meringue Pie recipe that I made some 60+ years ago.  I had lost this recipe many years ago but I finally have it back!  It is the most delicious Pie ever and you will never regret making it.  Thanks, Allrecipes!!!

I have made this a few times now, very easy and was as big hit
to who was able to have a piece before it was gone. Will make it again in the near future.

The filling came out incredibly lumpy. After doing research online I would suggest mixing the cornstarch and water together first before  adding them in with the other ingredients.

I followed the directions to a T, and everything was fine until I did the meringue part, and it did not whip up at all... I'm not sure what went wrong I did exactly what they said but basically it was just a sugary mix. Then of course when I try to take it out of the oven, it's just flopped over and cover the bottom of my oven in soupy lemon.

Made it as directed. Used meyer lemons and filled it on a pre baked gluten free pie crust. Even the  gluten eaters in my family loved it. The filling set up perfectly and the meringue was beautiful!  On 2nd da, a wet knife was needed to cut thru the pie, bc the  sugars became quite  sticky after being in fridge. This is a keeper. Only lasted 2 at my house. Next time I may try to sub milk for the water and see if it makes it a little creamier. But this came together nicely and the flavor was fantastic just as it’s written here. Thanks Grandma!

I’m not sure where I went wrong, but mine turned out watery. I was overall very confused, because mine looked nothing like the one in the video while I was making it. I’m sure I did everything correctly and in order. I don’t know where I went wrong.

This is the BOMB!! Made the crust with Lorna Doones; cut the sugar in the cheese layer by l/4 cup. I don't like really sweet. I used my mother's lemon meringue pie recipe for the lemon curd layer. I will make this a "go to" dessert for sure!!!

The flavor was good, texture was so-so.  The recipe was not very detailed, so for someone making a lemon meringue pie for the first time, as I was, this is not the recipe I would recommend.  For example "juice of 2 lemons" is vague considering lemons range widely in size.  Especially in baking, you definitely want to know how much of a liquid you are putting in.  I figure this might account for some of my texture issues.  Also, I let the lemon custard sit in the pie shell and cool for about 10 minutes before topping with the meringue even though it didn't say so.  I just felt weird adding the meringue when the lemon was still steaming.

Oh... my.... Lord is this outstanding. Tasted the lemon curd that was left over in the pot after I poured the rest in the pie pan. My eyes bugged out like an old Bugs Bunny cartoon. Wow. The lemon flavor is just enough and is def not over powering. The meringue came out perfect. I am so happy with the result. It is cooling on the wire rack now.

Love this simple recipe! It has an amazing depth of flavor with the butter added to the pie filling. I had to learn to be patient with the eggs whites, but once they firmed it was worth the texture. Such a timeless recipe! Going to save this one!

My husband and I loved this pie!! I would not change anything about it except maybe to make my own pie crust instead of a store bought one.But that did not change the wonderful taste of this lemon pie.It was so easy to make! It would be a great dessert for family dinners!

I made one change to the recipe. I have a member to my family that is gluten intolerant.  Instead of the flour, I add extra cornstarch. It works out well.

Let sit for at least an hour after baking. Also, the meringue was not as fluffy as we were hoping. 
Super yummy and fast dessert

This was the very first time I made a lemon meringue pie.  I followed the recipe exactly.   I used my own homemade pie crust.  Served it for Easter dessert.  Everyone thought it was great!  It’s a lot of work...but SO worth it.   It turned out perfectly.  Excellent!!  I would make this again!

The base of this recipe is pretty much perfect. I did a mango purée in the filling and a kiwi purée in the meringue, simply because they were starting to get a little over ripe and I needed to use them up. It came out quite good for my first try, should have used more fruit but I liked it. I’m sure it would be just as good or better with the lemon. Cheers!

I juiced 3 lemons instead of 2 to make it more tart.  Doing so made it perfect to my taste.    Great pie!

Great recipe! I however decided to make lemon meringue tarts instead of a whole pie. I did everything following instructions except baked tart shells first, used two large lemons and the zest from one whole lemon, one cup water and 1/2 cup of milk and I did add a quarter teaspoon of cream of tartar to the meringue.

I make this recipe every Easter and it is always a hit, occasionally the filling comes out a bit too runny but that is probably due to an error by me. I would highly suggest this to people looking for a good lemon meringue pie recipe.

Followed the recipe exactly as is, and it came out great. I tried a technique from the Inspired Taste website to make the pie crust. It was a very different technique that gave great results. Everything about this pie was really good.

I've made this pie two times now.--very good, very easy. The first time, the lemons were medium sized and I probably could have used a little less sugar. The second time I made the pie, the lemons were larger and I probably could have used a bit more sugar--2 - 4 tablespoons. However, there weren't any leftovers so no worries.   

Each time I made the pie, I made it  GF by omitting the flour and adding an extra tablespoon of cornstarch. texture was  great.

I followed the recipe almost exactly and it turned out exceptional! The only thing I did different was to use only 1 Tbls. zest in the curd and then I used some more to sprinkle on the top when it cooled. I still had a couple of teaspoons left which I am going to let dry and save for another recipe.

This recipe is amazing as well. My family was hosting Christmas, and when we host we go all out on our food. I had made this recipe before, and my family ate almost all of it in 2 days because it was that good. So, for Christmas, I made 2 of them, and they were all gone. (Granted, we did have quite a few guests) My family loved it! Just one thing I would recommend it if you like a pie that is more lemony tasting, add about 1/2 lemon juice more than the recipe calls for, but leave out the extra lemon shavings. Add a bit more cornstarch so that it doesn't turn out runny. (We ran into this problem) Just adjust until it suits you!  Definitely recommend this recipe to everybody who is craving a good lemon meringue pie.

I love this recipe!  Made over and over again. It’s easier than I thought it would be. My grandson loves helping me and can whip up a phenomenal meringue. The only add on I use is cream of tartar in the meringue 1/4 tsp.

I cheated by using a pre-made crust and canned filling (I was worried about the canned filling but it was not too sweet and was tart and tasty... My Mom made the best homemade from scratch lemon meringue pie, she's probably shaking her head in heaven but money and my energy are limited so I gave it a whirl, baked it today and by tonight it will be gobbled up so: success)! The meringue came out great! Next time it's going to be totally from scratch! ??

My husband loves me more after making this, haha!  I added about 1/8th of a teaspoon of lemon extract to the meringue and it was a nice touch! This was a very easy recipe to make, and I think it helped having the eggs at room temperature when whipped in a metal bowl.

This recipe was delicious.  I did increase the portion to 12 for a deep dish crust.  The only change I made was to add a fourth lemon, as my fiancé loves tart lemon flavor.

Delicious, zingy, citrusy custard.  Will definitely make again.  Use “homegrown” eggs if you can - the golden yolks make your custard the color of marigolds.

This was my first attempt at a meringue pie, and it turned out beautifully!  I made it with Meyer Lemon and my wife loved it.  After reading up on meringues "weeping"  I made the meringue first and put it on the hot filling so that it started cooking the meringue from the bottom.  No weeping.

This is the only lemon meringue pie I make. I make it exactly as the recipe says.

A few suggestions to help those who have not made this before...

I bake the pie crust...and make sure it is completely cool. Then I make the lemon custard...fill the shell and make sure that it is completely cool before putting the meringue on top. If you do not do this...it will make a syrup  maybe from the steam...but it is not pleasant. I have made this pie so many times now. And when you beat 5he egg whites and sugar.  if you add the sugar to the egg whites too fast...the peaks are not as stiff. You must add the sugar slowly...one tablespoon at a time and keep beating until those peaks are stiff.

I love the flavor of this pie..it is very easy...and deeelish...

This was my first time making pie and it did not turn out well. The merengue never formed and stayed as a liquid even though i baked the pie for around 25 minutes. The lemon filler didn’t stick to the crust either. But, the taste is absolutely delicious! I’d make it again, but perhaps I’d learn more about pies before doing so.

I have made this recipe twice and have had rave reviews both times!  It is delicious! Followed the original recipe exactly!  Had a couple inquiries regarding the meringue which I took to heart,  and added 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar which seemed to help the meringue hold its shape better; but either with or without the cream of tartar the meringue tastes and looks great!

This was a very easy recipe! I made it for my hubby's birthday since I couldn't find one at the store. It tasted great!! He loved it. It was my first attempt at making a lemon meringue pie and I'll be making another soon. The meringue took forever but it was worth it.

Absolutely perfect! Like others have said, the flavor balance could not be better. It's not too tart and it's not too sweet. The lemon flavor is spot on! Grandma knew best, obviously. ;) 
I followed the recipe exactly, but doubled it and added 1/2 tsp. Vanilla to the meringue.  The texture was smooth and set up like it should.  Since I doubled the recipe, I used 3 large lemons and zest from two of them. The 3 lemons gave me exactly 1 cup of lemon juice. 
I let the pie cool on a rack for 2-3 hours and then put it in my pie carrier and refrigerated it in that. That worked well. 
I don't think I've had a better lemon meringue pie and I've been baking them and eating them for over 50 years.
One tip: Since this pie has so many ingredients, measure everything out before you start and separate your eggs to have them ready to go. I did make the meringue before I made the pie filling, but it sat a little too long and wasn't as stiff by the time I used it, so the next time I will just make the meringue while the pie is baking for 10 minutes. It's not any work for me with a Kitchen Aid mixer, so why not?
I highly recommend this pie! You will not be disappointed. It's delicious!

Delicious lemony goodness, but a little sweet.  Next time I'll reduce the sugar in the filling by just a smidge.

I will definitely make this again. Very easy. When using deep dish pie plate go for 1 and 1/2 to 2 batches of filling though.

I gave 5 stars for flavor but unfortunately I also had watery ring around top which basically ruined it. It took longer than expected for mirage to stiffen up so I think my filling cooled too much. This was my very first attempt but will not be my last. I am thinking next week !!

Followed the recipe step by step! Tried a recipe on a different site and it called for too much lemon juice. The less juice more thickness is what I learned. I have redeemed myself lol. It Came out amazing!!!!  Everyone loved it!

It had the perfect balance of tart and sweet  I changed the Meringue slightly by adding 1 tablespoon of cornstarch in the sugar and mixed it thoroughly before adding it to the egg whites.  This makes a very stiff meringue and it bakes very nicely.

I was nervous about making this for the first time but it worked out really well. I’m glad I tried it. I only didn’t realize that I had to put the meringue on while hot so eventually it did get runny so I will know what to do next time!

Not sure what or if I did anything wrong? I followed the recipe to the letter and yuk! It tasted like I had used lime instead of lemons. It was runny and the topping was flat. I will continue to look for another recipe.

I feel it’s a very good recipe, and I added quite a bit of lemon juice to make it more tart because that’s where my family likes it… And I was working with locally milled flower which tends to need some moisture added to it anyway so that worked out well. Are used European style butter which I think gives more richness because it has a higher butterfat content.Are used organic cane sugar rather than straight white sugar and it came out beautifully… Along with being healthier,  I find that the cane sugar has a really lovely flavor, which adds to the overall  bouquet of any given dessert. Also, I was blessed way back in the 90s to buy a Krupps electric hand mixer, which was actually made in the Republic of Ireland ????!  it has wire whisk style beaters rather than the flat blade saw and it does a beautiful job with making meringue. Haven’t tasted it yet and yet somehow I think it’s going to be delicious! Thank you so much for sharing this family recipe!

The flavor was really great! Not too tart and not too sweet. I followed the directions exactly. My lemons were fairly large (I’d say bigger than a large sized egg) and yielded around 1/2c juice. My only suggestion is to make about a half recipe more of the curd because it did not fill my pie shell completely. It was easy to hide with the meringue, but it could’ve used a little more filling. Will definitely make again with the previously mentioned change.

I made this pie for my co-workers, and they couldn't get enough of it!! My only comment was that it was a bit too sweet, so I might try it again making an adjustment to the amount of sugar used. Or maybe add a pinch of salt to cut the sweetness!

For a nice, fluffy dome of meringue, use 6 egg whites and   9 tablespoons of sugar. To prevent “weeping”, put meringue on filling AS SOON as the filling is put in the pie crust shell - a piping hot filling will cook the meringue on the bottom and prevent that film of water from forming. To prevent the little droplets on the meringue, beat the sugar in very patiently, no more than a tablespoon at a time. The droplets form either because of granulated sugar undissolved in the egg whites or because of over-beating the eggs. I’ve also found that 10 minutes of baking is perfect to cook the meringue without burning it.

I followed this recipe exactly, thinking it looked similar to the one my Grandmother and I used to make years ago. It's not even close. It tasted "funky" according to guests and I agree. We ate the meringue (made using a different recipe) and gave the rest to the chickens.

This recipe turned out great!  It was simple to follow and my guests raved about it.  My only caution is not to overwork the meringue.  It didn't fluff up as much as I would like but was tasty nonetheless.  I'll be using it again.

Like other reviewers suggested, I added milk instead of water and used the juice of 3 lemons and the zest of 2. Took just 10 minutes to cook nicely! Beautifully tangy and sweet! Thanks for the recipe!

This was pretty good.  I made sure to put the meringue on the hot lemon curd, then put back in the oven for 10 min.  Everyone seemed to love it!

Made this pie and it was delicious! Just the right tart to sweet we like. I made a pre-baked cream cheese pastry crust to go with it. I did not use meyer lemons as they aren't tart enough and skins are too thin to zest well.

Great recipe-easy to make.  I made this for my wife’s birthday.  I’m a good cook, but not a baker.  Found a good crust recipe and put this together.  Turned out great!  She loved it.

I LOVE this recipe.  I’ve made it several times.  The last time I made it I doubled up on the recipe and they turned out perfectly.  It’s my go-to lemon meringue pie recipe now.  I’ve made it without the zest and with the zest.  Both are delicious, but the one with the zest I think is a little better.

It was OK-- but I must have not cooked the cornstarch mixture enough, when the pie was cooled it was a little runny. and the topping   was skimpy needed more egg whites

I made this recipe once and it came out great... but there is a lot of wiggle room for error.  It says.... "the juice and zest of two lemons" well that leaves a lot of room for varied results depending on the size of your lemons.  I made this for thanksgiving  and had two large lemons.  The pie ended up tasting like lemon cleaner it was way too strong.

Yes, it is a simple recipe, but the first thing I noticed was there was no measurements for the lemon juice or zest. Big lemons, little lemons... each will give different amounts of juice and zest.  Mine were on the bigger side, so I ended up with a pucker up lemon meringue pie. Second, 4 egg whites leaves you with a pitiful amount of actual meringue.  It could easily be doubled or tripled.  The end result was a bit watery as well.  Over all, I wouldn't use this recipe again.

The pie itself wasn't difficult to make, but it took me forever to get the meringue to set. I'm sure I did something wrong.  I probably wouldn't have zested the lemons as much as I did next time. I was sure to zest the entire lemon. It was a very pretty yellow color though. If I wanted another lemon meringue pie in the future I'd probably use this recipe since it was so easy except I might substitute cool whip or whip cream instead of the meringue.

I made 2 pies actually! 1 with graham cracker crust and one with reg pie crust. I added raspberries (fresh, cooked down with a bit of sugar, water, & cornstarch) which gave me enough to make 2 pies with the recommended lemon filling recipe and I doubled the meringue recipe. AMAZING!

To help it not separate I kept the lemon part in the warm pan until I had meringue ready, made sure meringue went to the edge of the crust and left the pie in the oven for an hour after the 10 minutes of baking. I turned the oven off and opened the door halfway. After that hour I cooled it on the counter for another hour before putting in the fridge for a couple hours. I was SO excited that it didn’t separate!!  I’ve made this recipe three times this week and love it very much.

I have tried it with both milk and water. Milk is a creamier custard  texture and the water is more like the curd. Both taste great.

Yum! I followed Carthecook’s suggestions. Didn’t have any cream of tartar so I left that out. I used a short crust pastry from Countdown for my pie crust.

I made this last night and followed the directions exactly.  It was delicious.  Those who said it was watery probably did not whip the egg whites long enough.  I probably did for 10 minutes.  When it says it's ready when "stiff peaks" form, make sure the peaks do not ooze back into the bowl  when you stop whipping or you have not whipped long enough.  There is no way this is watery once the egg whites are whipped long enough.  It also says to use a metal or glass bowl, which I did, as I do for whipping cream, because plastic and whipping egg whites and cream do not work properly together.   Guaranteed success when the egg whites are whipped long enough and a serious pleaser for lemon pie lovers.

This pie is amazing! The best lemon flavor ever. Not a pie baker so like that it's not overly complicated. Don't think I whipped the meringue quite long enough but that was me. Will definitely make again. A BIG hit!

This was okay! I made this for my grandma's 78th birthday celebration to surprise her as a birthday gift. I made the mistake of making it a few hours before the party- so I was not able to bring it and had to run to the grocery store to grab a pre-made one. 

Also, the meringue topping never whipped-- it was very runny and watery. I think I may have done something wrong but I am not sure. 

Nevertheless, the next day, my husband and I tried the pie together and it actually ended up tasting AMAZING. The meringue was still not whipped or fluffy, but the overall taste of the pie was great.

I've never made lemon meringue before!  I tried a different recipe twice and it was a complete waste both times.  I finally tried this one instead and it turned out wonderfully!  The only small complaint I have is that I wish there was a little more filling, so I'll probably increase the recipe next time.  Other than that this was fantastic!!!

Delicious! We love this pie! The only thing I did different was use ALMOST 1/2 c. of bottled lemon juice instead of real lemons. I also used rounded tbl of flour, but leveled tbl for the corn starch. Lemon pudding came out perfect! Just have to stir for a good 10 minutes or so. For the meringue, I did add a bit of vanilla extract. Comes out perfect every time. I do have to drain the pie after it has cooled in the fridge. That's okay, the end result is pure lemon heaven!

I AM making this pie again...today!  I first used this recipe a few weeks ago to try it out on my Mom, as lemon meringue is her FAVORITE pie!  She absolutely LOVED it and raved about it to our family, so for that I have to say a HUGE thank you to Emilie!  Today is my Mom's 81st birthday, so I'm making two of these pies to take to our family celebration this evening.  Thank you Emilie!!!

Very easy to make. Yes, it takes several bowls and some thought but it comes out perfect if you follow the instructions.
I used a simple but delicious pie crust. The pie crust has to be baked to within 10 minutes of completion before the pie filling is added and the meringue.
If you make the meringue first so you can put it on top of the hot filling, it won't weep.

This was delicious, but I followed another old recipe I used some time ago along with this one and I omitted the flour and instead just used one half cup cornstarch with one cup of sugar, one and a half cups water with half cup fresh lemon juice (2 lemons). I only had a plastic mixing bowl to beat my meringue in so it kinda didn’t high peak on me or get too stiff like I usually make it, but it still got good and golden in toaster oven for about twelve minutes and tasted great with the half cup sugar! I let my pie sit out on the stove and cool for about an hour plus fifteen minutes before placing it in the refrigerator.

Every one who tried this loved it. I especially like how there is more lemon filling than meringue. It wasn't difficult to make, and it is going to be my new go to recipe for family gatherings.

I was not a fan of Lemon Meringue.. at all.. but it’s my other half’s favorite so I made a pair of pies for his birthday. The recipe doubled easily, and with no problems. I did use the tweaks by one of the critics and used fine sugar in place of regular granulated sugar. I also added cream of tartar and a touch of vanilla to the meringue. The balance of tart to sweet was spot on. The pie tasted awesome! I’m now a fan!

I made it as written and everyone loved it. A keeper for sure!  I used graham cracker crust only because I didn’t have a regular crust and can’t make pastry to save my life.  It was good   
Thanks.

This recipe is wonderful, I actually tweaked it to make it vegan omitting the eggs and using Earth Balance butter and then made an aquafaba meringue and came out delicious.  I even substituted lime for a key lime pie.  Thank you again for sharing your recipe. :-)

Made just as listed except forgot to add vanilla to the filling. I used Meyer lemons - worried it wouldn’t be tart enough but it was a completely acceptable substitution!  Hardest part was waiting for it to cool and chill so we could eat it :)

Second time making this pie.  Great tasting pie with outstanding texture.  The only change I made was to increase the servings to 24 and it made two pies that were the perfect size.  I will use this again and again.

Outstanding!!  Made this recipe yesterday.     This one, however, was perfect.  The filling was lemony, smooth, not overly sweet, and best of all thick enough to have a piece of pie retain its shape.  In so many of the other recipes I have tried the lemon filling failed to thicken and they were a sloppy mess once cut. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.  Will definitely be making it again

This pie was good, and I  used margarine instead of butter and rice flour instead of wheat flour and it turned out good. The lemon filling was a little gummy but I  may have cooked it for too long. I would make it again.

This is a great lemon meringue pie; I gave it 4 stars because I tweaked the recipe to get what I wanted. I used 1-1/2 times the recipe, used the juice and zest from 3 nice, big lemons. Since it's really humid around here, I stabilized the meringue by adding a cooled, cooked cornstarch and water mixture to the egg whites. That worked out fine. The end result was a lemon meringue pie that had a lemony tang and a meringue that was gorgeous. While the recipe itself is a keeper, I'm going to work my revisions into it. Thanks!

I followed the wonderful and detailed “tweaked” instructions by “Carthecook,” and it turned out perfect!  I tweaked a bit on my end by using the zest and omitting the lemon exact for the sole reason that I didn’t have any!  Thank you so much for your help!  I have found that allrecipes doesn’t give enough information and if it weren’t for the generosity of others, my first attempts would be flat and tasteless glunk!!  My pie was almost too gorgeous to eat!

This was pretty good- i was getting worried when i added the egg mixture and all i could smell was eggs lol but i was shocked how "lemony" it turned out! i would probably make it again with more lemon but that's just a preference

Used it as is with the exception of lemon juice and zest amounts. It is ambiguous, so I used a half cup of fresh squeezed, plus a bit more than a tablespoon of zest. Everything went perfectly,  am thinking about trying it in lime, yum!

Everyone is always asking me to make this.  
I am extremely picky about my eggs too. And I only use cage free, organic , humane certified ones.  It makes all the difference in the way the meringue tastes and peaks.
So aside from the fact that it will flatten out if you don’t serve same day.  It’s  worth it.  My neighbor is in her 80’s and she said it tastes like the real thing.

Wonderful recipe! Made it for Easter dessert. Followed the recipe as written but changed the servings to 10 for a little more curd and meringue. I used a 10 inch graham cracker crust. Just the right amount of tart and sweet. The real lemons are the key. I’ve had pie made with lemon juice and extract and you just can’t beat the real lemon ones. My family loved it and said this is the pie they want for Easter from now on.

This recipe is delicious and fairly simple to make.  I increased the egg whites for the meringue by 2 because I like a higher pie and it was perfect

Tried it tonight, and was good! The directions didn’t mention a good cooling period, and maybe cut it too early. The lemon part was runny.

Also found the meringue to be too eggy.

Maybe round two will be better.

Lots of Butterly flavor.  The crust got so sticky that it was hard to lift the bars without crumbling some.  Perhaps I should have prepared the pan with oil or butter next time.  But overall the taste was splendid.

Only change I ran into is one lemon was hard as a rock, so I had to resort to lemon juice for the second lemons worth. I made the pastry crust from scratch, probably over beat it, but the meringue I whipped for about 15 minutes it was so fluffy! Unlike the running meringue soup I had made on my first attempt at this pie. I made sure not to have a smidgen of yolk mixed in my egg whites before whisking. I made one last mistake, turned on a low broil to brown top, wish I hadnt done that, a light golden would have been perfection.

Excellent recipe! I did tweak it just a tinge to add a little bit more tartness. I added 1 and 1/2 tbsp of limoncello and 1 tbsp of lemon juice after the 2 freshly wheezed lemons. I also added 1tsp of vanilla to the meringue mixture. Turned out excellent and beautiful.

First time I followed the recipe as written but found 4 egg yolks to be too much for my taste.  I cut back to 3, increased sugar 1/2 cup and used 3 lemons and zest of 2.  I make whipped cream for the topping instead of meringue.  Lovely lemon pie!

Tastes absolutely amazing, there was just one problem, but that was not the recipe's fault. I had to use potato starch instead of corn, and it turned out much thicker than I expected. I'll use less next time. Otherwise, I love it!

This pie recipe is the best.  Did use lemon juice, did not have fresh lemons and used milk instead of water.  Made the pie very creamy using milk.  Best yet.  Thank you for sharing.

I didn't make any changes and it was delicious. The meringue didn't turn out as well as it has in the past. Just not as high and fluffy as I know it can get, but it could have been something that I did or didn't do that caused that. I will make this recipe again.

Double the recipe for the curd if using a regular size pie dish or you will have a very thin pie.  Luckily I had a small pie dish ready to use for another pie or I would have been in trouble.   Otherwise it's a good pie.

First time making a pie from scratch -- very easy to make and tasted GREAT!  I used 1.25 tsp of lemon extract instead of zest (personal preference).  Excellent flavor and consistency.  I'll definitely make again!

This turned out perfect. I used my own luscious meyer lemons fresh from the tree, four farm-fresh eggs from my back yard, and a home-made pie crust. Yummy doesn’t even come close!

I followed the cooling recommendations from other reviewers - 1hr counter, 3 in fridge, then tent with foil. I also set the recipe to 12 servings, which was the perfect amount of both filling and meringue. I made my own crust and made sure to BAKE it before adding filling and meringue. I'm poor so I don't have a fancy kitchen with automatic mixers and counter space, but was still able to coordinate the boiling/thickening of the filling with the whipping of the meringue. This timing is critical. It is vital to seal the hot filling with meringue as soon as possible. Any delay will effect how your meringue cooks and looks.

Experiment with different amounts of lemon juice, but just under 1/2 cup was very lemon-e and I would probably cut back next time. Remember, I was using the recipe set at 12 servings.

Tasty and beautiful.

Solid recipe. I added one extra egg white and a scant teaspoon of cream of tartar to the meringue. The curd was delicious. I cooled it one hour room temp and then put it in the fridge. I was disappointed to see that the meringue deflated a bit. Served it later the same day and there was some weeping which was disappointing too. It was my first lemon meringue and I was still happy with how it came out. Delicious!!

I made this recipe with my granddaughter and it turned out prefect.  We put it in a graham cracker crust and refrigerated it over night before adding the Meringue.

Will definitely make it again.  It was not too sweet & set up well.
Have made this 2 other times & it is wonderful.  Definitely use fresh cornstarch.

This is a more involved recipe, but my girls and I conquered it. It tastes amazing! I used the pillsbury pie crust that you unroll into the pie plate. I followed the recipe exactly as it said.

No I will not make it again. I have tried twice with the same soupy results. After following the directions, the pie turns into a soupy mess regardless of cooling or not. Seems there needs to be more details in the recipe to get the desire come.

This pie was amazing when I tasted it. Eggs are the special key in this recipe. Fail or success all depends on the how many eggs that we were used in ingredients. I think two lemons for one pie is too much. I will change a little bit recipe next time.          The first time I made this lemon pie, everything is ok but the top. Top is made by the white part of egg and stir it for at least 15 minutes but we only stir for 30 seconds. When we took out the pie from oven it totally uncooked.

Exceedingly delicious! We tried twice to make it, at the first time, the bottom part of the pie was too soft and wet, the whole pie turned into junk. Nevertheless, at the second time, the followed the orders carefully, at the end, with more efforts, we succeeded . As far as I see, the topping part is slightly difficult to make, the egg yolk is not easy to make into cream. Also, the pie was too soft to cut, it was easy to be damaged. Please be careful when you pick the pie up.

It’s the most delicious pie that I have eaten. We cooked it successfully by following this recipe. But we still failed one part. We need add more egg yolks and less oil to make it more sticky, then I believe that it will be more wonderful.

It's great! Turned out perfect. I was worried because all the top comments in this section all suggest different methods and changes to the recipe, and I didn't know what one to go with so I stuck to my intuition and used the original recipe. Turned out perfectly fine.

Almost like my grandmother and need more lemon zest. She made it with 1/2 lemon more and little more zest to it. My grandma pie was more than lemony favor than sweeter taste. But love it just the same.

Great recipe: changes are 3/4 cup sugar, 2 1/2 T flour and 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice with zest from 2 large lemons. Would need 3lemons if not large. Also decreased sugar in the meringue. Will use this recipe and method again!

BEST lemon meringue pie EVER!!  this has become my go to dessert.   So easy to make no need to buy the box mix anymore.   Make sure you let the lemon curd cool before you put the meringue on it or you get a lot of sweating.

Also used 1/2 tsp. cream of tartar and 1 tsp. vanilla in egg whites  before beating.

Loved it!  This is my husband's favorite pie and this will definitely be my go-to recipe from now on.  I overbeat my egg whites for the meringue but it was good anyway.  The best part, however, was the amazzzzzzing LEMON part!  So creamy and delicious - not too tart and not too sweet.  Just perfect.  Thank you!

The best pie I've ever made! My fiance wanted a homemade lemon meringue pie for his birthday...not just any store bought pie, one like his grandma used to make. I chose this recipe and am more than pleased!! No tweaking the recipe, no substitutions of any kind....watched the video and followed the instructions, it came out phenomenal!!! Definitely one or that is added to the family recipe book! By the way,  it brought my fiance to tears it was so good. I think that means he liked it too :-)

The video with this recipe gives a great tip. By resisting the urge to take an early bite you will be rewarded with a smooth perfect filling and meringue with no weeping.

This is delicious! I made it simple: I whisked all of the ingredients for the lemon filling together in a cold saucepan until the flour and corn starch were smoothly blended in, then turned stove on med-high, constantly stirring with the whisk until the mixture was boiling and thickened to perfection.  I poured it into a pre-baked Marie Callender's (frozen) crust and it came out perfectly! Leave to cool 1 hr., then refrigerate 3-4 hrs. before cutting.

It was easy to make flavor was great but I think when I make it the next time I will do a batch and a half of the filling. I think my pie tins are bigger and there wasn't enough filling

No wonder the little pies are so cheap, easy and cheap to make! Made the recipe as is, except for lemon or zest, didn't have any except juice from a bottle. Kept squeezing in an amount to taste and found the sweet spot! Faster than going to the store to pick up some! Thanks

It was Lemon Meringue Pie Day. And a sunny, warm and really a perfect summer day. So why not try making a lemon meringue pie?

Now I’ve never made a real one… just a couple of those out of the box ones. And since we have drastically reduced our processed food consumption, that isn’t an option. So lemon meringue pie from scratch it is. (I did buy a pre-made pie crust. Making pie crust from scratch scares me! And since my local store had them on sale $1.25 for two shells, I probably saved money).

A search on the internet revealed 1000s of recipes. So which one to choose? Then I saw “Grandma’s Lemon Meringue Pie” with over 1,700 reviews and 4+ stars on allrecipes.com. Of course, a Grandma is going to have a great recipe. And it had simple ingredients and and easy to follow instructions.

Decision made, time to get into the kitchen and start baking. I generally prefer recipes that require one bowl, mix everything in and then dump everything in a pan and bake. Realizing that Grandma’s Lemon Meringue Pie would not be everything I hoped for with that method, I resolved to take my time and be patient with every step.

As I tasted the filling and then watched the meringue grow in my mixing bowl, my optimism increased that this may actually turn out to be something yummy and pretty!! Ten minutes of baking time later and presto – a mound of meringue and a tasty lemon pie underneath.

I like the filling to be a little tart and my lemons were on the small side so I used 3 of them instead of two. Delicious! I'll definitely make again!

This is a perfect recipe. Meyer lemons add fragrance, flavor and color and I use them when I have them. Have made it many times. 

If bakers are having problems with moisture in the pie, there are two tips to avoiding that. Be sure the crust is completely cool so it isn't releasing heat/condensation into the filling, and don't overcook the filling. Cornstarch loses some of its "oomph" as it cooks. When the filling boils the cornstarch is at maximum thickening strength, continued cooking will not yield greater thickness. It's all downhill from there so remove it from the heat.

I was never a lemon meringue pie fan, until I made this pie for my daughter.   It's the best I've ever tasted.  The only thing I would change,  is to double the recipe.  I used a deep dish crust and wasn't enough filling for my taste.   But, otherwise perfect and easy to make.

Everyone is pretty right about this one - it's definitely a "keeper" - I did use a frozen regular pie crust and baked it the day I made the filling.  I didn't want to fill it, however, as I was serving it the next day and thought it might get soggy.  The next day I reheated the filling a "bit", filled the pie shell and made the meringue, put it on and baked.  Turned out divine !  And I did add a bit of Creme of Tartar to the egg whites.  It was a gorgeous looking pie and tasted just as good.
Thanks for the wonderful recipe for my favorite pie.

WARNING!  Definitely add cream of tartar as needed to make the meringue.  I used egg whites and no matter how long and fast I whipped them, it was still soup.  ADD the CREAM OF TARTAR!  I added 1/4 tsp at a time until the meringue made.  Other than that, that is the only thing I would change.  The lemon custard filling is wonderful.

Due to some family dietary restrictions, I did cut the sugar in the lemon filling to 1/3 c and added some Splenda; however, the meringue did require the sugar to make the peaks.  This has been a family favorite of ours for 7 generations!

It tastes amazing and the meringue was perfect however the instructions should include the remaining instructions that are in the video. Let cool for hour then put in fridge for three hours to let it set and not ooze when cutting.

My first attempt at making a lemon meringue pie and it was delicious!  Just as the name implies it tastes just like the ones my Grandma used to make.  I followed the recipe exactly using the juice from 2 lemons.  The lemons came from our lemon tree so they were on the large size.  If using store bought lemons which tend to be smaller I'd recommend using 3.  I also used farm fresh eggs provided by my neighbor's chickens.  No eggs are better  for baking.

This is a beautiful pie and worth all the effort to make. The only part I did different was buy a small carton of egg whites so I could double my egg whites for that mile high meringue on top. I'd rather have a little too much meringue left in the bowl, than not enough on my pie.

This is a perfect recipe!  Don't tweak it - just follow the directions exactly, whisk it constantly  and don't cover it with plastic wrap.  A half recipe makes 20 - 24 mini lemon meringue tarts, which are  "The Bomb" after Easter dinner!

Absolutely delicious!  My husband and I shared it with No One!  
I only had bottled lemon juice. Used 5 tablespoons and might use 6 next time for a little more tang.  Super easy.

Recommend baking it in time to be eaten all at once - any storage at all promotes moisture
Otherwise perfect pie

Very lemony not sweet which I loved. The meringue was separated from the filling by a watery layer. I googled it and turns out you're supposed to put the meringue on immediately after the filling is poured into the pie shell. Still turned out cute and yummy

Easiest lemon pie I have ever made. My two lemons were right off the tree and had lots of juice, probably more than this recipe calls for. It is hard to judge the juice from two lemons. My pie was quite tart but that is how I like it. Of course my problem is I can't get the volume for the meringue that I would like, but nevertheless, it is very good. I used water, not milk. I think the next time I will use more egg whites to get more volume for the meringue.

Easy recipe - for more lemon flavour I added 1/4 teaspoon of lemon extract. Only thing for next time would be I would not whip the meringue so stiff as it was hard to put onto the filling without making a mess!! Baked 5mins in the oven to brown meringue.

LOoks great for a birthday pie. 
Would have been helpful to know how thick the heated lemon custard was to be. It is cooling in the fridge and I hope it firms up. Otherwise we will be using spoons ?? Nice treat on a cold and rainy March day.

Made it exactly to the recipe. The lemon filling was a perfect amount for the pie crust. It was delicious, tangy without being too tart.

I will definitely make it again and the only change I made was adding the zest and juice of one lemon. I thought using two would have too much rind in it and take away from the enjoyment.

I made this the other day.  The flavor was really good, but it turned out very watery.  I have a really good lemon juicer, so maybe I had too much liquid between that and the water.  It would probably be helpful if the recipe gave a total amount of liquid needed when you add the two together.  I won't make this recipe again.  I think it also needed more meringue.

This was EXCELLENT. It was my first time making a lemon meringue pie so I was a bit intimidated. I also made my own pie crust for it.  I  read a lot of the reviews and found them helpful and took some advice: used 1/2 c fresh lemon juice (so either 2-3 lemons depending on their size) and 1T lemon zest. I baked my crust for 9 minutes at 350 before filling it. I did let the pie set out on a cookie sheet for one hour after baking and then put it in the refrigerator overnight to solidify.  I did have some beads of "sugary moisture" on the top but not too bad.  I thought the amount of meringue to filling was appropriate as written and I followed the directions as written with the exceptions noted above.

Made according to recipe and it looked gorgeous but was kind  of watery on the bottom. Also, did not have a very nice lemon flavor.   The lemons were picked from my son's neighbors tree, so it may have been a hybrid lemon, sweet, flowery smell, not as lemony as from a store.

I needed to adjust the recipe for the curd as it was too runny. Based on my past experiences with meringue; I made a Swiss Meringue as it is more stable than the French variety. Overall; I liked the pie after I made adjustments hence, my three star review. Not the best pie ever but certainly not the worst.

I have made this twice and both times I followed the recipe exactly and the filling does not get thick enough,What can I do to make it thick ? Otherwise the taste is great if you like a runny pie.

This was not great. First of all, it was not lemony enough. After adding some lemon oil, the custard was very rubbery. I've always just used the recipe on the back of the cornstarch box and I should have just stuck with what I know. Will not be using this recipe again.

We had this pie for dinner last night.  Yum!

Here are the small changes we made:
Gluten free pre made crust - didn't notice the difference.
3/4 cup sugar instead of 1 cup.
Meyers lemons from our tree had plenty of sweetness.
Used all the zest from the lemons for extra tang.
Only had three egg whites (don't ask), so added 3.5 T of sugar and had a slightly thinner meringue topping.
The steps take a while but aren't hard.
The result was exactly what we were hoping for.
Thanks!

This was the first pie I've ever made and it turned out pretty good for a first time, especially after reading how technical lemon meringue pies are.  So I totally missed the word "baked" after pie crust so needless to say my crust is not baked. So hopefully others wont make that mistake.  The only thing I think needs to be stressed in this recipe is to seal the crust with the meringue because if you've never made it before you don't know why and maybe wont pay too much attention to that. It turns out it's really important. When I moved my pie from the oven to the table the lemon stuff was watery and dripped everywhere. Overall the taste is really good though.

Use water not milk (as per recipe), it's better.
Add 1/4 cup sugar 
1/2 cup lemon juice = the number of lemons.
Use meringue II recipe for meringue.

This was the most horrible lemon meringue pie I have ever made.  Two lemons for juice and zest made it so strong, it burns the throat and on top of that the filling NEVER got thick and I cooked it for a long time.  Pour it into the shell and topped with the meringue, thinking maybe as it cooled it would set up more.  Didn't happen.  Never making this again.  will stick with my own recipe.

Meringue weeped and beaded. Better to cook at higher temp for shorter period of time. Need to update the instructions to incorporate the comments. Flavor is perfect.

Flavor and texture are great, easy to fallow. The only thing wrong and it is a big wrong , it ran,liquid everywhere. I took out a slice and used paper towel to suck up the liquid in the rest of the pie. Any suggestions please.

Huge raves about this pie. Great tasting, great looking. Just follow the recipe for good results and be sure to cover the filling completely with the meringue  or it may get watery.

My Grandmother was an awesome pie maker.  Her pies were to die for.  I found this recipe to make to go with seafood gumbo for Christmas.  When I tasted the filling, it knocked my socks off! I had flashbacks of Mawmaw Strick's pie!  (It warmed my heart,)  When I whipped up the meringue and put it on that pie, I could have sworn that she was in my kitchen. It was beautiful.  Being it was Christmas morning, I was stressed and didn't take a picture of it.  Believe me, it was picture ready.  Everyone loved it.  Word: make sure that you used a deep dish pie crust.  I kept fretting on the drive that the meringue was going to slide off.  It didn't!  Make this pie, it is indeed "Grandma's "

Normally, this would be a dish loaded with pitfalls.  Can't believe my Mom had to make this pie from a simple recipe with no guidance.  Thanks to the All Recipes community, it all turned out great.  I used the Graham Cracker Crust I in a 9" Pyrex pie plate.  I kept the serving size at 8, but will ramp it up to 10 next time for a little bit more filling.  I made the meringue with SIX egg whites BEFORE I made the lemon curd and that was sage advice.  Stopped stirring the lemon curd/egg yolk mixture at the first sign of a boiling bubble.  Put it in the center of the oven for some delicately browned wisps of meringue and you have a winner.

Okay, I've always struggled with lemon meringue pie..texture (all about texture), depth, meringue issues...etc.  Well, done with that!!!  This pie is PERFECTION!! at least for me.  I doubled the recipe as I was making for a crowd of six really good eaters.
It came out perfect even though I substituted lemon juice (didn't have enough lemons).  Make it, you'll like it.  Oh, I used Naples suggestion of not over beating the meringue..added to the perfect lemon pie recipe.  Keeper!!

This was a great and easy recipe even for a beginner. The only thing to note for a beginner is to ensure your egg whites are really fluffed before adding sugar. I also added twice the amount which made even more fluff. So tasty!!

It is a good recipe.  I love the fresh lemony taste. As others stated, it's not enough for a 9" pie crust. 4 egg whites makes a flat meringue.
Another note: You should never spread meringue. It should always be piped on.

First of all NO ONE believed that I made this pie homemade! It looked beautiful and tasted just as well. 

I made this with frozen pie dough and although it tasted fine I would probably use a prepared Nilla Wafer Tin next time just as an experiment. With that being said  It came out beautifully, we drove two hours for Thanksgiving and the Pie did get condensation during the drive (totally my fault for completely covering it!) 

I dont have a zester so I use a parmeasan grater and the zest turned out well, it's amazing to see it completely dissolve to form the creamy curd! It was my first attempt and mixing the yolk in this fashion and although I was intimidated it was easy and I'm excited to try again! 

I would use more zest next time (I used less than the recommended amount) but I like it very tart. 

Overall wonderfully balanced recipe!

It is an excellent recipe and does not require any tweaking. I use half a cup of lemon juice. I have used this recipe for years. However, there is a glitch in the recipe on my phone. The correct amount is 1 C to make the lemon filling and 6T to make the meringue. The app on my phone incorrectly says 6T for both. I got on my laptop and got the correct (1C + 6 T) from the website. Hope this helps the app users.

I wouldn't change a thing!  It held together without getting all dewy after a few days (leftovers).  My 12 year old granddaughter made this and it was the most delicious lemon pie I have ever eaten!  She zested the ENTIRE yellow on the lemons (a little white got in there too but it didn't affect the taste) When I went to check on her at the stove it wasn't thickening.  I asked her if she put in 3 "tablespoons" of cornstarch and OPPS she had used teaspoons.  I added 2 tablespoons and getting it to blend into hot lemon wasn't easy but I poured it in the piecrust I had made earlier and it was just fine!   This will now be a regular at Thanksgiving.  Made it for Christmas too!  Note to ALL:  Use homemade pie crust - frozen, store bought ruined it.

Curd tastes great, I make my meringue with the recipe off of the cream of tartar bottle like my grandmother did.  My meringue kept spraying from the curd and shrinking.  I have learned you MUST PUT THE MERINGUE ONTO PIPING HOT FILING AND SEAL TO THE EDGES WELL.  This prevents the water and separation. Can't wait til next time when I finally nail this beast!

great lemony favor!! I tripled (24 servings) this recipe and made some slight changes.  When I modified it called for 3 cups sugar but I ended up with about 2. I combined 1c sugar, flour, CS, and mixed in the wet...lemons ended up being about 1.5c lemon. It is absolutely vital you temper the eggs before adding to your sugar mixture...I scooped about 1-2c of the mixture and blended with egg yokes then added to the main pot.

Making the meringue directions were not correct in the least. IT says to whp everything after you put in the sugar which does not work, and it does not specify the amount of sugar to put in it.

So nice finding a lemon meringue that doesn't contain milk or sweetened condensed milk.  Much better for bringing out the lemon flavor.  Thanks!

If I were to this again, I would add less flour to the filling as mine turned out really flourly. Also, keep a really close eye on the filling when you are making it as it is done really quickly. I also added more cornstarch to the filling which made it a lor better.

I did not bake the pastry blind so that it shrunk and made less room for the filling so next time I will do the blind baking first. Because of this fact the pastry rose all over the place in little mounds LOL but I poured the filling on anyway and it ran over the pastry. (maybe a bigger pan would have been better).  However the filling tasted great and I was very happy with the ease that this was made.  The meringue came out a bit flat as it cooled but it was my first pie.  I was happy with the taste and will definitely try this again.

Great recipe. I did slightly deviate: using three lemon rinds,  juice from two lemons, added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar. For the meringue, I added 1/2 tsp of cream of tartar, and 1/2 tsp of vanilla.

First time making a lemon meringue pie. It turned out good. Read the reviews first and used 1/2 cup of lemon juice and 1 tbsp zest like others said. Also, substituted water for milk. Turned out good. Will make it again.

Very tasty pie, but next time I will double the recipe for my deep 9" pie plate, for I prefer my pie shell to be half to three quarters full and then add the meringue.  I also added about 1/2 tsp more corn starch, for I didn't think it ever was going to thicken up.  I used two large lemons, so maybe that is why I needed more corn starch.  I will use this recipe again.

My first ever lemon meringue pie from scratch. I was kind of worried at first since a lot of reviews made a lot of altercations and decided to just stick to the recipe and will just improve it from there but to my surprise this actually turned out pretty good and I didn't have to change anything at all. Love this recipe and definitely making this again.

I made this recipe for a coworker's husband but my coworker gave a slice to my very hard boss to please and he loved it! He said I nailed the meringue on my first adept. I will not forget that any time soon. I took the advise from others in these reviews. Thanks for the recipe!

First time making a Lemon Meringue Pie - After reading a majority of the reviews, I made the following substitutions to each pie; First I changed the servings to 24 for two pies) (12) was not enough for 2 (9"-Deep Shells)
1. Added zest from (4) lemons along with 3/4 of a cup of lemon juice.
2. Added 4 tbsps of cornstarch
3. Added 2 tbsps of Lime juice
As noted by several I made the Meringue beforehand to ensure that I was ready to add it while the filling was still hot.  Both pies turned out great, everyone really liked them.  One question: I let the pies stand in an open rack for 1.5 hrs to cool prior to wrapping them in suran-wrap.  When I went to served them 4 hours later from the frig the Meringue seemed to have collapsed a little, although my Meringue was almost 4 inches deep - if anyone can suggest another method to keep the shape I'd appreciate it.....Thx Jake

Definitely our favourite lemon pie so far! I just did as I always do and cut on sugar (3/4 cup for filling and 4tbs for meringue) and it turned out perfect to our taste in every way! No need to ever try another recipe :D

This turned out perfect!!  Well, all except my crust was ugly but that was my fault lol.  I used meyer lemons straight from my lemon tree for the lemon filling.  The filling did scare me because it was pretty soupy when it went onto the pie crust and after the 10 minute bake so I let it sit on the counter for a while and it was still pretty jiggly, so I threw it in the fridge and after a couple hours it was perfect!!  Set up so nicely and the flavor was exploding with lemon and the meringue...perfect!!  So glad I made this recipe and I followed one reviewers and loosely covered with foil when storing to avoid water forming.

Fabulous - made twice and didn't change a thing. I've also used the filling for lemon meringue cake because it's so much better than the one that came with that recipe (used milk instead of water). Thanks so much for sharing!!

I have not made it yet, but I wanted to point out that the "contains no milk" is a little misleading to those of us who are lactose intolerant.   Butter is made from milk, so we cannot eat this pie.    Please edit your title so it does not mislead others.   Thanks.

Delicious lemon curd recipe! This was my first time making my own curd and it turned out beautifully - and was so simple! I halved the recipe and layered it in 2 personal sized ramekins with a graham cracker crumb mixture and topped with the meringue - it was a hit!

The lemon mixture would not set even after being in the fridge, looked more like lemon curd.. however I have made lemon curd before which tasted far better. 
The meringue was good but it is hard to mess up a basic meringue.

This was my first attempt at making a Lemon Meringue Pie. This recipe was simple and easy to follow. I followed a few others tips: After pouring custard into crust, I let it stand and cool before placing meringue on top.  Also, once it was taken out of the oven, I let it cool and set for an hour before placing in the refrigerator.  Once cooled, it was a nice sweet treat.

Followed the recipe exactly.  Should change the title to "Delicious lemon liquid with meringue on top".  Curd didn't set, no where on the recipe does it say to chill the curd first in the pie shell to set and then top with meringue...if you put meringue on top of hot curd it's going to make a pool of water at the bottom of the pie shell.  That's what happened to mine.  Like I said, I followed this EXACTLY, and I had curd that wasn't set, and a pool of melted meringue on the bottom of the pie tin.  Delicious slop.

This seemed so promising right out of the oven. We probably did something wrong, but I'm afraid this pie was so horribly sweet none of us could eat it. Possibly it was our choice to leave the zest out? It was too bad it didn't work out, and the meringue was perfect. We'll definitely be trying this again, though maybe with a different recipe. The instructions people have left in reviews about how to cool this pie properly were very helpful though!

This pie was great! The only thing I changed is I used 1/2c of lemon juice instead of juicing the lemons.  Pie came out perfect & I let it cool for 1 hr on the table & then moved it to the fridge, (uncovered) for another 2 hours. My family loved it!

The taste of the pie was ok, but it came out very runny.  I cooked the curd until "thickened" (I know everyone's definition is different) and I did exactly what the recipe called for.  I think one issue was the recipe doesn't say exactly how much lemon juice to use.  I have my own lemon tree, and they come in all sizes.  Maybe I added too much.  Also I was surprised at the amount of water used.  I think I'll use less next time.  On the brighter side, the meringue came out perfect.

Delicious filling!!!!  I have never made lemon meringue pie without using boxed cook and serve lemon pudding.  But my daughter and I were having a craving for it, and we had no pudding.  So I found this recipe and we decided to try it.  Delicious and relatively easy, though definitely more time consuming than making with the boxed pudding.  I made it exactly as the recipe is written, but then added 1T of bottled lemon juice in the last couple minutes of cooking to add a little more tartness - I guess it depends on the size of your lemons, and mine were on the small size.  Next time, I will double the recipe to make a fuller pie, and then eat the remainder as pudding.  Yum!  Thanks for the great recipe!  (I did not make the meringue - my rating is simply for the filling.)

A pie to be proud of! I have never made a lemon meringue pie and did with the help of three children (so probably not perfect technique). We followed the recipe exactly. It came out perfectly. My husband loved it too. It may be obvious to more experienced pie makers - but don't cut this pie while it's still warm. It holds its shape perfectly when cool. :)

I love this recipe !   I've made it at least 3 times if not more.  My husband LOVES it too !  I have cheated a bit.  I am not one to separate eggs or zest and squeeze lemons.  So, I put 3 whole eggs in the yellow part, I put lemon juice in and I bought dried lemon peel online for the zest.  I also add extra lemon juice than would be 2 lemons.  I put 4 ½ ounces of lemon juice and 3 Teaspoons/1 Tablespoon of the lemon peel in. It kind of needed some extra flavor and that does it nicely.  I also buy egg whites at the grocery store and make the meringue that way.
My husband LOVES lemon meringue pies and I dont' mind making this for him.  I love it too !

This was a wonderful pie to eat! Make sure you are a good multitasker in the kitchen as you will have lots of things cooking at once. Make sure that when making the meringue you do not have any egg yolks mixed in with the whites, this will cause your meringue to stay very liquidy. I accidentally dropped a yolk in my meringue and had to remake it! Though I enjoyed cooking and eating this pie, it is not for beginners.

We really enjoyed this dessert. We served it in bowls because it was firm but there was a bit of liquid. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and it turned out great. It was so simple to make and I will make it again.

This is a great lemon meringue pie recipe, quite a bit of work but worth it. 
I used a 10 inch pie plate, so I changed the servings to 10, but should have changed it to 12 as there was only slightly more than an inch of filling. 
I also added the juice and rind of one lime that I wanted to use up, but it didn't take away from the lemony goodness. The meringue would not brown at 350 after 15 minutes and I didn't want to cook the whole pie, so I punched up the oven to 450 while leaving the pie in and it was done in less than 5 minutes.
It was well received, everyone loved the balance of sweet and tart. I will make it again.

It was basically soup.  What did I do wrong? Before I added the meringue, it was set up nicely. I took it out of the oven...it looked awesome...but then I cut into it and seriously needed a spoon to dish it out! TG it wasn't for company. The flavor was all there. Presentation and texture wasn't!!

Great recipe!  I made this and used about 2/3 cup of freshly squeezed lemon juice and it was delicious!  I thought the lemon filling was spot on and the meringue amount was also perfect.  No weeping, no problems!  It set up perfectly. Beautiful pie!

I made this exactly as written, with the exception of the cornstarch, I was a little short for the double recipe I was making, so I didn't have quite the amount called for. The lemon filling was SO insanely good! The perfect amount of sweet and tart! I made one for home and one for a co-worker's birthday (she is a huge lemon fan). Everyone raved! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Great pie!  I made a few substitutions (based on my pantry at the time).  I used Demerara Sugar in the filling mix, confectioner sugar and white vinegar in the meringue .  The filling did have a slightly darker color based on the sugar but tasted delicious.  The meringue turned out perfect.  My boyfriend's comment..."on point!!"  Will definitely make again!

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out delicious. My only complaint about this recipe is that it doesn't walk you through the steps enough.

Would add extra lemon next time.  I added extra corn starch and may have been too thick.

First attempt and a huge success!  Young and old alike raved over this pie!   My mom and husband both said it tasted just like the pies they remembered and longed for from childhood.   I did double recipe to make filling thick and used the 1/2 cup lemon juice/1 tbsp zest suggestion.  Definitely worth the effort, but highly suggest making two at one time as ONE pie will NOT be enough!

Followed directions as written but ended up having a hard time getting the meringue on the liquid but with a care, I managed it. Once out of the oven, I was really concerned that it would not thicken but after an over night stent in the fridge it set pretty good. I think I should have maybe let it thicken on the stove top more maybe but the end result was good although still not as set as I would like. Overall, great taste and I will make it again with a little more stove top cook time.

This was my first lemon meringue pie and it turned out perfectly. I took another reviewer's advice and had the meringue ready to go immediately after putting the curd into the crust. It wasn't soggy on the bottom. Cooked all the way through and was perfectly sweet-tart!

I don't know what happened, but this was a flop.  Went through a lot of trouble squeezing and zesting lemons for nothing.  Prepared for Easter dinner but couldn't serve it.  My meringue looked great (I got better results with cream of tartar) but when I cut into pie, lemon layer separated into watery-looking mess and curd.  Ick.  It did thicken when I cooked filling, so I have no idea what happened.   I tried a bite and it wasn't lemony enough either.  Complete waste of time and ingredients.  Thank goodness I made a different pie too.

I have made this pie 3 times now.  The first time it was good but a little sweet and the meringue was not right.  The second time I just made small changes.  A little less sugar in the filling and cream of tartar in the meringue.  
Even without these changes this pie is 5 stars if you like simple with great natural taste.

My first baking fail. The curd refused to thicken, and when I poured it into the pie shell anyway and baked it, the curd expanded and spilled all over my oven's bottom.
The recipe didnt state how long to bake it for, so i decided to bake till the curd set. bad idea. Not only did it get runny-er, it CARAMALISED!

I followed this recipe and took the advice from so many in regard to taste. However, my meringue came out super runny and watery. Tastes fine but I probably won't use this recipe again. Unless someone wants to tell me what I did wrong :)

First time for a meringue and it's a fabulous pie due to a great recipe and some helpful tips from other reviewers. Changes I made:  used 3.5 Tbsp cornstarch; 1/2c lemon juice (3 lemons) with zest of 1 lemon; added 1 tsp vanilla extract in filling; 5 Tbsp sugar (1 Tbsp less than recipe) in meringue; used 1c milk + 1/2c water (all water in recipe). Whisked everything, boiled 1 minute then added tempered yolks and boiled another minute. Baked pie crust 20 min at 390 then put filling in warm pie crust and topped meringue on warm filling.  Takes 10-12 minutes to beat egg whites and sugar into meringue. Baked 10 minutes; cool 2 hours then fridge 6 hours until was home again to try it! Wonderful!

Very nice, fresh lemon flavour. When cooking the filling, it didn't take long for it to thicken up. Once it came to a boil the first time, I reduced the heat to medium-low and continued to cook it for an additional 5 minutes. Then, I let it cool in a bowl for about 30 minutes before spreading it in the baked crust. The texture and consistency turned out very nice. The first time I made this recipe I added vanilla, as one reviewer suggested, but we did not care for it AT ALL. It totally overpowered the lemon and ruined the pie.
As for the meringue, don't believe anyone who tells you that you cannot "over whip" a meringue -- you definitely CAN! It will become foamy and dry and not hold a proper peak. (I learned this the hard way!) Be sure to start with room-temperature egg whites and check the "peaks" often once you get past the soft-peak stage.

THIS WAS A VERY EASY RECIPE TO MAKE AND TURNED OUT VERY TASTY...WHAT DREW ME TO IT ORIGINALLY WAS THAT IT HAD LESS SUGAR THEN OTHER RECIPES I'VE MADE IN THE PAST...I PERSONALLY FIND LEMON PIE TO SWEET..BUT THIS RECIPE WAS PERFECT! IT WAS VERY TASTY AND DIDN'T TASTE SO OVER POWERING FROM THE SUGAR.. ONLY CHAGE I MADE WAS USE REALMON LEMOM JUICE INSTEAD OF LEMONS...
3 TABLESPOONS EGUALS JUICE FROM 1 MEDIUM LEMON..

I made this pie for my grandpa for christmas. Before tasting it he said how his mom used to make lemon meringue all the time for him and how he never had one like it since.
 I overheard him talking to my grandma how it tasted just like his moms and he got a bit emotional. I was so happy to see him that happy over something simple. I am definitely using this recipe in the future.

It  came out perfectly even though I was in an emergency baking situation, and I did not have all the ingredients (fine sugar for example or cornstarch - I used flour instead). I also changed the water for milk, and put only one lemon juice and one zest. 
Finally, for the filling part, I use my mother's secret which makes impossible to mess the desired "solid" texture in any flour/cornstarch filling: I mix all liquids and dry ingredients together before putting the pan on the stove on medium, and whisk it without stopping for 14 minutes. It came out perfect: tasty, right texture, lemony... Nice birthday pie for me!

I made this recipe for my 70 year old mother-in-law's birthday because lemon meringue is her favorite.  I normally purchase her pies because I do not care for lemon.  However, I love To bake and thought i'd give it a shot.  On her first bite she began to cry because it tasted exactly like her grandmother's that she hadnt tasted in 50 years!  I followed the  recipe to a T.  It will weep overnight.

I used one lemon and its zest, and substituted 3 tablespoons of lemon juice for the second lemon. Had no trouble whatsoever. Filling was awesome and the meringue came out beautifully. Probably should have used an 8 inch pie pan rather than 9, but still, I have no complaints! I absolutely recommend this and definitely will make again!  *as a side note, a beginner cook might need more instruction on how to tell when the filling or the meringue were ready, but the experienced baker should have no problem.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  Easy to follow directions and a wonderful tasting pie. My only recommendation is to never cover your pie with plastic wrap...it will leave your pie with a puddle in the center!

Delicious!  This was my first time making lemon meringue pie and it turned out wonderfully. I didn't have large lemons, just the lemons from a  neighbor's tree, so I juiced enough for 1/2 c. like recommended. I also used almost a cup of whole milk and the rest water cause I didn't know if I should stick with water or do all milk. I also used a tsp of cream of tarter when making the meringue to help with weeping. I totally forgot the lemon zest, which I actually took the time to get. Anyway, it took forever to juice all those little lemons and get the seeds and pulp out, but I had my kid help with mixing the meringue. Overall, I'd say it's worth it. I'll be making this again.

Did do any changes except I placed it in a 11" x 9" glass baking dish lined in 10 buttered layers of Fillo Dough, pre baked until golden brown. SOOO good!

Mine is in the oven as I type this and I only had one issue that was easily resolved.  The meringue,  no matter how long I whipped it,  would not come to a peak.  I figured out that it was missing an ingredient.  Cream of tartar.  Threw some in and we were in business

This recipe is very good.  The only thing I would change is to cut the amount of sugar in the curd filling from 1 cup to 3/4 cups or 2/3.  The meringue part and the pie crust are already sweet and with the whole cup of sugar in the curd filling, it makes the pie really sweet.  More tartness will add a nicer balance overall.  If you like things on the sweeter side, stick to this recipe.  Everyone approved of this pie.  :)

This pie is fabulous.  The only change I made was adding 1/4 tsp of cream of tartar to the meringue.  My wife loves lemon meringue pie and thought this pie was as good or better than the best she had ever had.  That is high praise from her as her mom made a fabulous lemon meringue.  I made the meringue before I made the lemon filling.  I put the meringue on while the lemon filling was hot.  After cooking I let the pie sit out for an hour and then refrigerated it for 3.  It was perfect.  I had no excess liquid in the pie.  This was the first lemon meringue pie I ever made.  I found the video to be very helpful.

I chose this recipe for my first ever attempt at making a lemon meringue pie. It is the best tasting lemon meringue pie I've ever had!

I love the simplicity of the recipe. I expected it to take a while to make one, but I had it prepared and in the oven within 40 minutes!

 I made the mistake of putting the pie filling in the shell while I was making the meringue, so it had cooled down considerably before getting the meringue on the pie and baking it in the oven. It resulted in a weeping pie :(  

Next time I make it, I will make sure to put the meringue on the pie while the custard is still piping hot!

More importantly, my husband loved it!  I followed this recipe to the letter, however I did make a couple of changes.  For the filling I used 1 1/4 cups of sugar, 3 1/2 tablespoons of cornstarch, 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice (my husband loves it to be tarty) and lemon zest from 2 lemons.  It turned out perfectly!  I've been trying to make this pie for 23 1/2 years.  Finally I can make it and I will make it, a lot more times!

The recipe did not state clearly how thick the pie mixture was supposed to be prior to adding it to the crust. It needs to be thick pudding consistency or it will be runny. The taste is spot on, but having to freeze a pie just to cut it, is a waste of time and money.  If the directions were more clear, I could give a five star rating.

This is a very flavorful pie! I'm definitely going to keep it for the future. I did need to add a little more corn starch to thicken up the filling a bit.

Good flavor although the meringue was a bit watery. I've seen other recipes that call for dream of tarter, that may help?

I have made this pie a few times. I think I have it just right.  I have found with 2 lemons there is a little less filling than my liking. I added 1 more lemon into the mix and I think the amount of filling is just right. 

I can't suggest any other revisions to the recipe.  It's perfect!

Minor change-lacking corn starch so I substituted flour-and used graham cracker shell.  I boiled until extremely thick. GREAT TASTE, well written directions.

My meringue didn't work so well because I was whipping it myself and I didn't have the appropriate sugar but I hope this time around (I'm making it again today) it will come out perfectly. 
It was so so so YUMMY!!! My boyfriend and my housemate loved it!

The flavor is great!  My issues were not with the recipe bt with my technique.  This was the first time I ever attempted this pie (pies are not my specialty though I am an intermediate level baker).  My curd was a bit gritty and the meringue seperated; like others mentioned, I had a sticky, lemony water pool at the bottom when I cut it. Oddly enough, this did not affect the crust.  I let it cool to room temp before putting it in the fridge so I don't think it was condensation as others suggested.  I rated it a three because there were some directions missing - like pre-baking the pie crust; novice bakers should be given those instructions.  Also there could be some hint as to the curd and how to make sure it was smooth.

Great recipe.   I made it gluten free w/ a store bought gluten free pie crust and Bob's Red Mill all purpose gluten free flour.  Followed the directions and it came out perfectly.  The people who are saying it comes out soupy are doing something wrong.

My meringue looked like thin foamy dish soap.  The lemon filling was runny for me but I should mention so yummy (I want to make it separate next time and spread on pancakes or toast.) I will conquer it one day!

Made To recipe. But as per review voted most helpful, boiled lemon filling for 14 minutes. DO NOT do that because you only get a few mm of filling at the bottom!!! Take it off heat right after it boils, thickens and then put the meringue on. Tastes good, but don't overboil or you'll be as disappointed as I was :( after waiting all day to dig in.

This is a great and easy to made recipe. I tried it today and my boyfriend loves it. However, I left the pie to sit outside after its baked and after an hour, the meringue starts to shrink and juice leaking out from the filling... does anyone have the same problem ? Or should I put it in the fridge after a bit?

I made this exactly as the recipe called for as a birthday pie for my Mom's 89th birthday. This is her favorite pie.   I was a little concerned about how long to cook the filling because it seemed a little thin but it firmed up beautifully in the refrigerator and was delicious.  Everyone enjoyed it. I am making this again this weekend in tart shells for a party.

The filling was runny, too sweet and too bitter, the crust did not get a chance to finish baking, and the meringue took a very long time to whip while the rest of the pie just kinda sat there.

My Young Son and I made this recipe as tarts today.  1/2 the recipe and lime instead of lemon.. Wow they are good! Because limes are usually smaller than lemons we used 3 instead of 2 for 1/2 the recipe... for both the zest and the juice.

Great recipe, but confused as to how much lemon juice was needed.  Also, I didn't have time to make a baked pie shell, so I baked a large tortilla into the shape of a pie crust and it turned out great!!! I like a sweeter meringue and next time will likely add more sugar and possibly vanilla.

This was excellent! I made a homemade crust and followed this recipe for the filling. Thought that the zest was going to be too much but it all blended together and was wonderful. My meringue shrunk a little after cooling but it still tasted delicious!

Just finished eating my first slice of this pie--fabulous!  

I definitely agree with the former reviewers:  substitute 2% MILK for water and use 1/2 cup of lemon juice and 1 TB of zest.  Finally, I also like a lot of meringue, so I added three egg whites (I needed the yolks for an icebox pie I had made last week) to the four in the recipe (and added a little extra sugar when whipping).

You'll love the creamy texture--so good!

As a first-time lemon meringue pie baker, this recipe was very clear and simple.  The pie turned out great! The proportions were spot on and everything set very well. I recommend following the recipe exactly and be sure that you have read the recipe completely before you begin the baking. Good luck!

That filling is just wonderful, and that is what my review is for!  I would definitely make this again.  Now pie crust and meringue?  They still have me stymied!  Marie C. gave me some good advice on the Buzz, so I will try those two items again even though I vowed not to!  My family loved the filling, too!  Thanks, Emilie S.!

First time making lemon meringue pie. Read all the reviews, as per usual for extra tips. Making the meringue first was an excellent tip, as well as making sure that the meringue was sealed- turned out perfectly! I would definitely use this recipe again. I used the same amount of juice from the lemons, but I did add an extra tablespoon or so of the bottled lemon juice, just for extra flavor.

For some reason I struggled with this recipe.  First time it was soupy and didn't set.  And it took forever to whip the meringue into stiff peaks.  Second time I added more cornstarch (in water) and it set really thick.  So if it's a little soupy it should still set fine.  For meringue: beat eggs, then add 1 tbsp sugar at a time, beat more, etc,  but not too much or else meringue will set too stiff.

This is hands down the best lemon meringue pie I've had. I have mate it over and over for family and for parties and it is always a huge hit. 

The recipe may be too sweet for some, but I think it is just right.

I am not a baker, but this recipe made my friends think I actually knew what I was doing.  The filling was lemony deliciousness and the meringue (which of course is the part that made me pancicky) was a breeze.  Totally hit at the BBQ.

Easy to make and delicious! I made additional gluten free ramekins for myself in addition to the pie. 

I increased the recipe by half, used Bob's all purpose gluten free flour in place of the regular flour. 

Pour the lemon filling directly into ramekins and seal with meringue & bake 10 minutes. 

It's just as delicious, and an easy way to please both wheat eating pie lovers AND gluten free guests without much hassle!

This recipe is really, very good. The lemon filling is a perfect balance of lemon and sweet, and the merinuge is nice and fluffy. I made this for Easter lunch and everyone loved it! Paired with a homemade lard pie crust and it is delicious. Although, personally, I think I could have just made the pie crust and lemon filling and eaten the whole thing myself ^-^ Overall very good.

Turned out as described in recipe it would. I added cream of tartar 1/4 tsp and 1 tsp vanilla to meringue as I was whipping it. Smooth creamy light flavor from meringue. And I added yellow food coloring as needed to get s more yellow color to pie filling. My crust was still cooling so I slammed it into freezer to cook it faster, and the filling was already made n hot so I dumped it in s large bowl n stirred often so it could cone down heat wise but not enough to form a film on top before I put filling into cooked pie crust from freezer. In other words, it won’t hurt to have filling done before crust is totally cooked. I took a picture......

My husband is a lemon meringue pie connoisseur and he said this was the best pie he's had since his 'Mum' passed. That is high praise from my Awesome Aussie. I'd tried canned fillings and various other recipes but none came out with the great taste and tartness of this one. Thank you for posting this recipe so I can give him a taste of home.

My first lemon meringue from scratch - followed recipe to the T! Everyone said was delicious. Followed suggestion to put meringue on top of curd while hot and left out to cool for a good hour or more before putting in fridge. Turned out perfect....will definitely use at least 1 tbsp  zest next time as suggested by another reviewer.

First time making a Lemon Meringue pie and it was awesome.  Only issue I had was I should have blind baked my pie crust a bit longer.  I did use the same technique for making cream pies that another user suggested, bring curd to a boil, boil 1 minute and after tempering the eggs boil another minute.  My curd set up beautifully.

Made exactly to recipe and it was very good. All at the extended family holiday meal thoroughly enjoyed it. I tend to like a bite from lemon so next time I'll use juice and zest from three instead of two lemons.

I forgot to add the butter and it still turned out great.  I also added 1/2 more teaspoon of cornstarch and followed the rest of the recipe as written.   The filling set perfectly.  Delicious.

It was a very good recipe, to be honest, but if I was to do it again, I would add more ingredients to thin out the strong lemon taste, since it was really sour.

Instructions are too vague. It wasn't clear to me how long I should cook the filling and to what thickness. I also wasn't sure about the whipping time for the meringue. I watched the accompanying video and attempted to replicate those textures, which took quite a long time. About 25 minutes on the stove to thicken the filling, and over 15 minutes of whipping the meringue. I put the pie in the fridge after letting it cool on the counter for about 15 minutes. It was loosely covered with the plastic pie crust lid, plenty of room around the edges, as the meringue prevented closure. The final product had a puddle of meringue-flavored liquid in the bottom. So disappointed. The flavor was okay. but I won't bother with this recipe again.

Good recipe only change I made was the amount for the filling. The filling I changed to 10 serving so there would be more filling in the pie shell and more meringue on top. I also added 1/8 tsp. of lemon extract. I enjoy a tart lemon pie.

I also tweeked this recipe with a touch more  1/4c sugar and  1/2 tbls corn starch and improved it. It is a very delicious pie. I also use a propane torch to brown the top and it is much quicker and you can control the amount of browning.

SO GOOD. Not quite sure how much juice you get from two lemons cause of different sizing and I had some lemon juice in freezer so I used about 1/2 cup and it was perfect. Loved this and it is a keeper. Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe but I had to make a change to add more sugar because i had big juicy lemons so I added 1/2 cup of sugar and it came out great.  My husband can't wait to eat it and he said yummy yummy.

Great flavor and turns out perfect every time. Seal the meringue by placing it to the edge of the hot filling.

Sweet and Tarty...just like my girlfriend. I was initially concerned about hand squeezing lemons and getting enough juice so I'll admit I did buy lemon juice (gasp!). But I tried squeezing the lemons that I bought for the zest and it turned out it was very easy. Whipping the egg whites takes time so don't get discouraged if it looks like nothing is happening.

Delicious as is. Have made this recipe multiple times and it always comes out perfect. The only changes I (sometimes) make is to add a few drops of yellow food colouring to the filling for a brighter colour, and adding a pinch of cream of tartar to the meringue.

 Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

I can only give this recipe 3 stars because I ended up with a lot of excess water between the lemon and the meringue, despite following other reviewers tip of placing the meringue on top while the lemon was still very hot.  The taste was great though and will likely give this another shot in hopes of it being less watery next time.  I did also double the filling and the meringue  to make a more deep dish pie.

First time making meringue. Ended up giving the filling some scrambled eggs (whoops!) and I may have gotten over eager with the topping. But as far as taste goes. FANTASTIC! family favorite.

Seriously good pie!  I make it just as written.  Always turns out great, except the last time when I was in a hurry, was distracted and think my lemons were too large.  I'm ready to redeem myself and make more.

This is hands down a great pie! I have used this recipe frequently and have never had any problem with it in any way. Friends, family, colleagues, every one seems to love this recipe. The flavor, the balance of sweet to tart, the texture, are all perfect. It sets up well and I have never had any problems with any water in my pie.

My husband requested lemon meringue pie for his birthday today.  I was a little nervous.  Every time I have ever made lemon meringue it has had the juice at the bottom or something has gone wrong with the meringue.  NOT TODAY!  The lemon filling was incredible.  Perfect balance.  I made sure the filling was hot off the stove when I topped it with the meringue.  I did use the "meringue II" from this site just because I have had problems with meringue and wanted stability.  HIghly recommended and very easy to make.  Needless to say, today was a huge success!  Thanks for the recipe.  It is going on a 3 X 5 today!

This is my third time making this recipe, no alterations.  I've noticed it has a little different taste each time due to the lemons.  Thanks to those adding the refrigeration and covering instructions. Also, I want to say that I use the "Grandma's Secret Pie Crust" recipe (I refrigerate the dough for an hour or more or even days and I use butter only).  Perfect taste!

I made two pies exactly as the instructions showed however, I did increase the servings to 12 as advised.  I used water, not milk.  The first pie I overcooked the lemon.  The meringue was fantastic.  The second time, I only cooked the lemon until it started to thicken.  The filling was delicious and the meringue was the best I've ever made.  Lemon Meringue pie is my husbands favourite - I will make this again and again.  It was extremely easy.

My mother's favorite desert is lemon meringue pie. I say this because I have never met a human so picky with her lemon meringue pies. This pie impressed her so much she asked for MY recipe!! Thank you Emilie! The only thing I changed about this pie is I added one tsp of lemon extract to give it an extra punch of lemon flavor. I highly recommend this recipe!

Very nice and very lemony just how I like it.  For extra special use a butter crust instead of a pre-made.  Make sure to blind bake it first.   To twist it up use maple syrup or brown sugar instead of white sugar in the meringue.  Subtle taste difference that helps.

I made this as directed but was disappointed.  
It was tart, not to sweet which I do like but I found that it was also bitter.  I am thinking that this is due to the zest perhaps.
Meringue was good.  Very easy to put together.
I would make this again with some adjustments

This was the best lemone meringue pie I have ever made. The flavor was great without being too sweet or too lemony. The meringue even mounded beautifully. This is now my go to recipe for lemon pie.

Fabulous Lemon Meringue Pie!  My husband & kids loved it and I thought I was going to be the only one who liked it.  
I did use a graham cracker crust, but would be good with a regular pie crust as well.
The only thing I might do different next time is change the meringue a little based on another recipe where I love the meringue (really sits tall on the pie & yummy) and it would be to use: 4 egg whites, 1 cup sugar, 1/4 tsp cream of tarter & 1/4 tsp vanilla extract.  
This is definitely going to be made on a regular basis now that I know everyone here loves it.

It tasted delisious but the lemon melted my crust so you need to be careful and let it cool a touch before pouring from the pan to the pie crust before baking.

I am a frequent baker, and this is the first meringue pie that I've ever made that wept! I got a watery layer between my meringue and my filling that I had to pour out after it cooled for a little bit. The flavor was otherwise spot-on, just as you would expect from a lemon meringue. I also used 1/2 c juice and zest from 1 lemon. I'll give it 4 stars on taste but I think I'll stick to my usual lemon meringue recipe next time since my usual recipe doesn't weep.

this pie was amazing even though i completely messed up during the process. i was supposed to make two pies but while mixing the dry ingredients, i realized that i had not doubled the recipe! it was definitely a *yikes* moment. and then when i was adding the meringue to the filling, i noticed that the filling was really jiggly... that mystery was solved when i had already placed the pies onto the counter to cool and was cleaning up, when i found the butter on the counter... not in the pie.. but when serving it my family all said it was delicious, so all-in-all it was amazing! :)

I don't see why people are saying the curd layer was thin, mine filled up a tender-flake deep dish 9" shell with a bit left over (However I did use the juice of one more lemon). Meringue never works our for me so what I do is cool the filling a bit and then spoon marshmallow fluff straight from the jar onto the pie (not spreading it too much)and then brown it at 500°F for 3 minutes. It works nice, it's not as thick as traditional meringue though

I'm an experienced baker, but had never attempted a lemon meringue pie until I made this recipe this weekend. We had some lemons on our Meyer lemon tree, and this was the perfect way to use them. I was honestly surprised at how easy it was to make, and making the meringue was a breeze. I put the meringue on while the filling was still hot to ensure that they wouldn't separate from each other. I let the pie cool on the counter for an hour before putting it in the refrigerator to chill and then let it set up overnight. My husband had a slice and then went back for seconds. That pretty much says it all. If you're intimidated by making meringue, this recipe makes it easy.

Made this pie over the weekend and it got rave reviews! 
This was the first time I made a lemon meringue pie from scratch. This recipe was very easy to follow, used simple ingredients and yielded a delicious pie.

Super yummy. Nice & tangy, not overly sweet like some Lemon Meringue pie recipes. I've made it twice now & last time forgot the butter & it still turned out perfect. I'll leave it out next time too to save some calories since I end up eating most of this yummy pie myself.

Followed recipe to a T - and lemon filling turned out to be extremely watery after being baked.  Lemon filling was as thick as the video before I poured into pie crust.  Merignue was good, but overall, extremely dissappointing.

Excellent Lemon Meringue Pie.  I will be using this recipe from now on.  I don't have to worry about the curd turning to water because of the added flour and egg to the mixture with the cornstarch.  My husband doesn't like lemon meringue but he loved this one!

Awesome and so easy! I have made this pie now 5 times in the last 4 months ( twice just for me because I like so much) The only difference is I use skim milk instead of water and a about a real half cup of fine lemon zest. Delicious!!

Followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will increase it by half. Filling to meringue ratio was not to my liking but flavour was spot on.

I made this today......I followed one review and made the filling with half skim milk and half water, creamy texture.  I was disappointed in the meringue, it separated.  I will make this again but will find another meringue recipe, thanks for sharing :-)

This is a wonderful recipe.  Since we like a more lemony pie,  I used 1/2 c lemon juice (lemons vary in juiciness).  I also make the filling in the microwave.  Follow the directions given except use a glass bowl and after adding yolks microwave for 1 minute at a time, whiskig between, untill quite thick.  This whole process takes less than 10 minutes.  I also slightly under-bake my crust and put everything together while still warm.

This pie is now on my favorites list.  I used large lemons, so the taste of lemons was a little strong, bit still fabulous.  Next time, I'll use smaller lemons.  The lemon curd set up quite nicely and sliced and served beautifully.

I had never made a lemon meringue pie until today, so I don't know what I'm talking about, but this turned out pretty darn well. =) I used a 10" saute pan for the filling and whisked almost continuously; it thickened up very quickly. I also followed suggestions from several other reviews: since I was using a 10" pie plate, I upped the servings to 12; I used milk in place of the water; I spread the meringue over the hot filling and sealed it to the edges; I cooled it on the counter for three hours and didn't refrigerate it at all. I'll be trying this again. =)

This was very good! I didn't have lemons so I used a little less than 1/2 a cup of lemon juice and it was perfect. You have to let it cool for over an hour or else when you cut it, it won't look nice

It was my first time making a lemon meringue pie, and it came out as close to perfect as it could with my current cooking skills. Just make sure you chill it for long enough, or it might not set properly. I did 1 hr at room temperature, then a few more hours in the fridge, according to others' instructions.
I made sure to have the meringue prepared before the filling boiled, so that the bottom of the meringue would cook from the filling's heat, but it strangely seemed to deflate a bit once it hit the filling. When it came out of the oven, though, there was plenty of meringue height.

I didn't feel like reading all the reviews and doing the recipe tweaking today, so I didn't. This recipe is just fine how it is!!! My uncle asked for a lemon meringue pie for his birthday. I wasn't sure if the texture was right because I'd never had lemon meringue before but he said it was perfect!! His family loved it, too! And I loved the lemon curd part--it was not too sweet but not too tart... I'm not a big fan of the texture of meringue but I enjoyed this pie for the lemony goodness. 

sn: I'm so glad I had a stand mixer for the meringue!!!! It didn't even take the 30 minute prep time because I had the meringue whipping while I was cooking the lemon curd and pie crusts.

Great tasting recipe! I gave it four stars because, as with other members, mine fell apart and my meringue started weeping and dripping. I'm not sure what I did wrong, as I'm an experienced baker. I think it might have been that I put too much filling into the pie, not allowing the meringue to completely touch the sides of the pie. My crust turned out soggy and the pie had to be scooped out. I'll try this again, but maybe tweak something in the filling so it doesn't fall apart the way it did.

My husband love this!  I like a lot of meringue so added an egg white.  I did add a pinch of cream of tarter to the egg whites.   I would like a bit more filling as well so will adjust next time, but overall this is a winner!

Still baking but so far it seems good. The pre-baked product tasted good so I'm sure the post will also. I had a little issue with my meringue at first though. It wasn't stiff enough. I added 1 tsp of cream of tarter (per my mom's suggestion) It stiffed them pretty nicely. She also suggested for future meringue making I should make sure I use room temp egg whites. They stiffen better.

Apparently I am one of the few reviewers who did not like this recipe.  I have made many lemon meringue pies and this was the first time I've had a problem with the lemon filling thickening adequately before pouring it into the pie crust.  Yes, I did double check my measurements and did bring the filling to a full rolling boil and beyond.  Consequently it was impossible to put the meringue on the hot filling which is the recommended method of preparing a lemon meringue pie.  I will not be making this recipe again.

We all loved this! I did have a problem with the meringue. I checked with my baking specialist (my mom :) ) and she said that she normally only uses 2 egg whites with 4tbls of sugar. So what I did was add sugar till it thickened. Eventually it came around, but there was leftover, so next time  I'll just use 2 egg whites. But we all love this recipe!!! Thanks

This recipe tastes great...  but it needs more cornstarch in the filling to set-up correctly, otherwise it weeps-off clear water.

I was really optimistic about this pie after tasting the custard and the meringue Pre-baking.  Both were super tasty and I was psyched about how it would turn out.   I took others advice and subbed milk for water and it was creamy and yummy.  I baked the crust, made the meringue and then made the custard so I could follow the directions to top the hot filling.  10 minutes later I took it out to cool and that's when it went downhill.  5 minutes out of the oven the meringue started to weep and shrink.  Now it's a shrunken meringue sitting on a pool of syrup over the tasty custard.  Really not sure what went wrong, but I still rate the 3 stars because the separate parts are so tasty.

This is a great receipe if you are wanting lemon bars. So sweet and sticky your fork sticks to it. The flavor is good, but not a great receipe for lemon pie.

This is a perfect balance of tartness and sweetness. I used 3 golf-ball sized lemons for this recipe. I'm not a fan of meringue, so instead I used whipped topping with a touch of piping gel (to stiffen it up so it would hold its shape after I piped it). Of course I baked the pie for 10 minutes and let it cool before I added the whipped topping. A fan favorite!

This pie came out perfect! I looked through a lot of recipes and read reviews and took my chances on this one, my family loved it! I always recommend though when working with meringue, if it's your first time making it, look up a meringue recipe and learn how to make it right. There are a lot of tips and tricks to it and any little thing can ruin it.

ZEST, ZEST, ZEST, my first bite left me with a bitter mouthful. I have never had a lemon meringue pie that you had to actually chew on zest to swallow. Although I did not like the zest the pie had a good texture, so I will follow the advice of some other reviewers and leave out the zest or just add a 2 Tblspns.  The meringue was excellent! It takes a while to form, but well worth the wait. There is no need to add tartar. I used an electric mixer on high to get the foamy egg whites then very slowly added the sugar. I then turned the mixer down to a medium speed and let it do its thing for about a half an hour and it came out perfect.

VERY HAPPY to find this recipe. A great friend of my maternal Grandma York (Ms. Ida Robinson) had her recipe in the Elwood Cookbook from 1976 of which sadly was discarded when we sold Mom's house a few years back.  This is just like Ms Ida's recipe and is the BEST old-school recipe and was one of my father's favorite pies.

This pie is great!  First time I have ever made a meringue pie, and it was much easier than I thought it would be.  Family loved it also.  Only change was to use juice from 4 large lemons, which ended up being about 1/2 cup - we like our lemon desserts tart!

Very good!  I remember growing up a little uneasy of making lemon Meringue pies, as my mother (a proficient baker) had tried and failed several times to make one.  But this recipe was super easy to follow and the pie turned out wonderfully on my first try.  I'll definitely be using this pie recipe again.

Very good - easy - husband and mother loved it and so did I...will make it again. Only thing I would say to make it better as far as the recipe is that I wish people would also give a measurement of the juice of two lemons since some are juicier than others - we had big lemons onour tree but they had a lot of skin...so that is more rind and less juice I guess?

Mine did not set well.  I have zero intentions of ever making this again, however it was my first lemon meringue pie so it definitely could have been my fault  But usually I am an excellent cook and baker.  This was not yummy at all.

This was the first time I have ever made a meringue pie and it was yummy. I made it last night for my mother-in-law for mothers day because it is one of her favorite desserts. I was a little nervous to make it but it turned out great. I made sure to make the meringue first so I could put in on the hot filling. I did get a little bit of water drops on the top after it was in the fridge for a couple of hours but it still tasted great. Will definitely make again.

This is an excellent recipe, much easier than the Lemon Meringue Pie III! Instead of juicing the lemons myself, I used the contents of one whole lemon-shaped squeeze bottle of lemon juice. I also replaced the sugar with Splenda and it turned out great! Since this pie was going to sit out for a while, I added 1/2 tsp of vinegar and cream of tartar to the meringue and a packet of unflavored gelatin to the lemon custard. Yum!

This was my first time making lemon meringue pie and it was not as complicated as I thought it would be.  I 'cheated' and used lemon juice and rehydrated lemon zest because I didn't have time to go to the store for real lemons.  The pie was a big hit at Easter dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

If anyone can answer me...approximately how long are you supposed to cook the filling for? I made it for the first time today and I think I overcooked it or something because my filling is really rubbery...I'll try making it again, but make sure to not cook it for too long, I guess. My meringue turned out really good and I used graham crumbs to make the crust. Yum.

Excellent and yummy pie recipe!!  Definitely worth the extra work this pie and all its steps take!  My first attempt was complete success and yielded the perfect sweet and tangy combination.  I highly recommend using the fresh lemons, over bottled lemon juice.  Lessons learned from my second attempt: Temper the lemon into the egg yolks VERY slowly and in turn, the egg mixture back into the lemon mixture rather slowly, or you could curdle the eggs and ruin your pie.  Also, do not get ANY egg yolks into the egg whites, or your meringue will not fluff (at all).  :-)  Otherwise...enjoy!!

This pie was so amazing. :) I used a little more than 1/4 cup of lemon juice and the zest of one lemon to flavor the filling - as for the cooking, I stirred that pot until my hands were turning pink from the heat! ;D The filling was superb, tart and sweet (not boring or mellow in the least!), and I was so relieved by the simplicity of the recipe! ;D Definitely beyond my expectations!  Note: I was anticipating a very intimidating, impossible project (eggs scare me in recipes - what happens if the yolks scramble? What if the whites don't fluff up?), but it turned out to be oh-so-simple! :) For beginners like me (or, I was until I baked this pie ;D), don't be afraid! Just follow the instructions and everything will turn out A-OK! I will definitely make this again - my family raves about it all the time now.

2011 Perfect recipe. I have made lemon meringue pie before and have always had problems. This recipe was the perfect balance between sour and sweet. I did substitute milk for water but that was the only change I made. I made this for Easter and took the last piece to my Grandma after our dinner because this is her favorite pie. 2012 Made this for Easter again - It's better to let the filling cool completely before making the meringue. Otherwise, you get a pool of sugary syrup and the two layers don't stick together. It was still very delicious! Also, I like to use 8 egg whites with 8 tbl of sugar so there is tons of meringue!

This pie was very easy to make and so delicious! I made it for Easter dinner and the whole family really liked it! I used a 9-inch ready-made shortbread crust which was really good with the lemon meringue.

I made this recipe but did do some changing.  I subbed an additional 1/2C lemon juice in place of part of the water.  I was using 'meyer lemons' because they are not as sour I thought I could get away with using more lemon juice BUT it was too sour.  (I would use the amount that the recipe calls for) Also, I used 2 whole eggs in place of the 4 yolks because I don't care for meringue, I used a can of whip cream for topping before serving.

I made this for my in-laws the other day, and they absolutely loved it. My mother-in-law has been using her own lemon meringue pie recipe all the time but thought this recipe is even better than her own!  The only change I made was substituting white sugar with Splenda.

I followed the recipe as directed, but my results were less than desirable.  First, I thought the zest from TWO lemons gave the filling a bitter taste.  Secondly, the meringue looked perfect coming out of the oven, but as it was cooling I noticed that it was beggining to "weep".  Needless to say, that created a fluid layer between the meringue and the filling causing it not to adhere to it.  I may try making the pie again in the future with a some modification since Lemon Meringue Pie is my favorite pie, just not this one.

This pie is delicious...I'm not even a big fan of lemon meringue pie, but I'll make an exception for this one. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. Next time I'll leave out a bit of the cornstarch, as it thickened A LOT! Also I'm going to take some of the other reviewers ideas so that the meringue doesn't get watery. Regardless, it tasted DELICIOUS!

This pie tasted very good and everyone liked it.  The lemon got denser than I expected so it wasn't really my favorite texture for a pie but it was the perfect sweetness.  My pan was a little big and my meringue shrunk a bit in the fridge so I was a little disappointed since it had looked so good the couple hours before and then when I went back some of the lemon was showing and was a bit damp.  But it was my first attempt and was pretty successful.  I couldn't believe how easy the recipe was to make- really quick.  I'd make it again.

I tried this recipe without reading the reviews. It took a long time for the merigue to whip up and meanwhile the custard part cooled off and separated. Next time I will start with the merigue and then do the custard. I also tried reducing some of the calories by using splenda in the custard and it seemed to have an after taste. I will try this recipe again but with all sugar.

This recipe is makes the perfect lemon meringue pie.  Delicious! I had people who typically skip dessert going back for seconds.  Directions are perfect.  I did use a different meringue recipe, but knowing how great the filling was now I wish I'd tried the meringue as well.  But there will be a next time!

Wonderful pie, and really easy too!  I had leftover egg yolks from a previous project and since making a meringue would have left me with another bowl of egg yolks, I did not attempt the meringue part...and the pie was still great!  I also made my own graham cracker crust and it was all delicious!!  Next time I will try to make the whole with each of the parts...  Thank you for the fantastic recipe!

WOW!! This was fantastic!  My first ever lemon meringue pie.  The instructions are just right.  Everything worked out perfectly and it is delicious!  I couldn't help but use Splenda instead of sugar in the filling.  It reduced the calories to about 280 per 1/6th of the pie.

Wow - this was good!  My mother-in-law is famous for her LM pie, and my husband raved about this one!  I used the juice of 1 1/2 Meyer lemons from my lemon tree, and they might be a bit less acidic, but the taste was fabulous.  I was so proud to have made meringue for the very first time - and instructions were right on.

Let me break it down a little:  For Flavor and Ease this pie gets 5 stars.  For overal consistency and directions it gets 4 stars.  Here are some valuable tips to perfection of this delicious pie!  You will need at least 5 tblsp of cornstarch as my pie was a little runny at less.  And, make sure to let your pie cool completely before making the meringue topping otherwise your merigue will being to melt underneath.  That's it!  Great tasting recipe and made a lemon meringue pie lover out of me.  Thanks for the recipe Grandma!!!

This was my first try and I was thrilled to have it turn out so well. I followed the directions exactly but sliced it too soon. This time I read some of the reviews ahead of time. MUST let the pie cool before slicing. It is a struggle, especially when you know how good it is. Definitely worth having lemons on hand for this one!!

I made this pie for a Christmas party in Mexico. Everyone loved it!!!  It was very tart, but I think that had more to do with the lemons I  used rather than the recipe.  FIVE STARS

This is a good recipe. I think it was my first time making lemon meringue pie from scratch and it was a lot easier than I thought. The flavour was nice but quite mild; not as tangy and lemony as my husband and I tend to like. I don't think it would make much of a difference, but I used 6 tbsp Realemon lemon juice instead of fresh squeezed and 1 tsp lemon extract instead of lemon zest (an approved substitution according to the allrecipes.com substitution list). I might try making this again, but I think I would try doubling the lemon extract next time to see if the flavour turns out more to my liking. Overall, a recipe worth trying.

Awesome - My first time making Lemon Meringue Pie, and it came out great! Following other reviewer's advice, cooked the filling for 14 minutes but found this made it slightly too thick - almost jelly-like. Next time, may cook it for slightly less. Definitely requires an hour to sit, and at least 3 hours in the fridge.

This is a very nice recipe - very lemon-y and easy enough for a novice, like me!  I did use the Never-Ever Fail Meringue recipe for the top, but I think I'll go with this one next time.

My husband has had lemon meringue pie every year since before he could remember...that is until he married me.  I decided this year I would attempt to make him a pie, hoping it would taste half as good as his mother used to make.  Thanks to this recipe, the pie came out great!  My husband is not only happy that I made an attempt, but that the pie came out so good.  Thanks to this recipe, I may get to watch one less football game this Thanksgiving day.

Yummmmmy, mine was a little weepy but I think its cause I left it in the fridge overnight.  I had to use limes instead of lemons and it was still amazing.

Wonderful pie!  This was the first time I have made a pie from scratch and it was great! I did add 1/4 tsp. of cream of tartar to my egg whites before I whipped them and then also add 1tsp. of vanilla to them as well.  I wanted a really strong lemon, so I used 4 lemons instead of 2.  I did everything else the same as the recipe.  LOVED IT!

Everything a lemon meringue pie should be! It's just the right balance of sweet and tart - a little more tart than sweet, which is what I was looking for. Really showcased the lemon. Very easy, too. I used a couple of extra egg whites to make more meringue. This will be added to my real-life recipe box for go-to desserts. YUM!

I replaced all the sugar in the lemon mix and half the sugar in the meringue with Splenda. The meringue came out Perfectly, but the lemon mix lost almost all its water during the final baking, and I got a very soggy crust :( I'm not sure if the water separation comes from me replacing sugar with Splenda, but I will give this a go with sugar only next time.

This pie is simply incredible. I've made it several times now.  The 2nd time I made it I tried it with milk for half of the water content, as one reviewer had suggested, however, my family did NOT like it that way.  I've followed the recipe exactly since then, and it has always been phenomenal.  Thanks for sharing, Emilie!

OMG! This pie was so good.  I made this dessert for family dinner on Sunday and to my surprise it turned out great!  I was very scared because I had never made one before but it came out so good.  My son is already asking can we make another Lemon Meringue Pie.  Thanks for this great recipe!!!!!  I will make it again!

Excellent results! Reviewers tips really work well. I always make Lemon Meringue Pie with a graham cracker crust with a bit of lemon zest and a tsp of cinnamon in it. The video that goes with this recipe is very helpful.

I've never tried lemon meringue pie, but my husband loves it. So my rate is based on what he thought of it. The pie came out delicious, but a little runny. I don't know if I did anything wrong. If someone has any suggestions on what to do so it doesn't come out runny please let me know. I will definitely make it again.

This pie was incredible. It was easy to make and it wasn't to sweet or to sour, it was just perfect! My family is now asking for a fifth serving! I've had to make it four times already! I used two more egg whites for the meringue for extra to make it really high.. but this pie is perfect the way it is! I highly recomend it!

Absolutely a WONDERFUL recipe.  I had RAVE reviews from my family. I followed the recipe exactly. Next time i MAY do the merigue prior to making the filling as I found myslef stirring the pot with my left hand and beating egg whites with my right. I was very fortunate to have gotten close to a half cup of juice from the lemons.  My Mom always used to place the lemons in a bowl filled with hot water prior to juicing them as it seemed to help the lemons produce more juice.  Don't know if that was an olde Irish folk tale, but, it sure seemd to work !! AWESOME recipe   :o)  Marilynne

Not sure what I did but the meringue never set up completely and I whipped it for 14 minutes! Since I didn't have enough meringue to seal the edges of the crust (SO important) it "de-flated" into the pie resulting in a gooey mess. I did use 1 1/4 c. white sugar, 3 1/2 TBSP. cornstarch, 1.5c milk vs. water, 1/2c. lemon juice and 1 TBSP. lemon zest, and added 1 tsp. vanilla extract. Let mixture boil ~1min, then stir in everything else and stir until thick ~1 min. For the meringue I whipped egg whites on high ~2min, added 1/2tsp. cream of tartar and 1/2tsp. vanilla, then sugar and whipped another 14 minutes. Let cool on counter ~1hr, then in fridge 3-6hrs uncovered, then cover.

this pie was awesome!  though i did follow suggestions and used more lemons, zest, and even some extract to punch in the lemon tartness. also it was a little sweet so the second time around i cut down the sugar in the meringue to just one TB per egg white (4TB).  but this is the first recipe i've tried for meringue and will stick with this one! thanks!

Very good results.  Used milk in lieu of water on first try, and results were fantastic.  Not too tart, not too sweet.  Just creamy goodness.  Thanks!

This was a delicious pie even though I did not cook the lemon mixture for long enough.  The directions just say "until thick".  I think it needs to be cooked for over 10 minutes - until it gets really thick.  Take your time on cooking and I think it will turn out perfect!  I also heeded the advice of another reviewer to set the meringue on top of HOT lemon mixture and the meringue set really well.

This was really good, like another user I used 1/2 cup of lemon juice (3 1/2 small lemons).  My husband loves lemon meringue pie so he was a little impatient, I let it cool for an hour on the counter and placed it in the fridge for 3 hours, when he cut into it the lemon part wasn't fully set yet, (still tasted good just a little runny).  By the next day it was set beautifully so I would suggest letting it sit longer than 3 hours in the fridge

I used this recipe for the filling only and followed the directions to a T. It was perfect as is. I didn't have any problems with runny filling. This is a keeper recipe that I will make again and again. Thanks!

This recipe has the perfect balance of tart to sweet. I like my lemon meringue pie to be a little more on the tart side, and this one got it just right! I made a few little adjustments to the recipe - I used milk instead of water, used 1 Tbsp lemon zest (from 2 lemons), used 1/2 cup lemon juice (from 3 lemons), whisked 1 tsp cream of tartar into the sugar for the meringue, and baked my pie longer than 10 minutes (closer to 15 minutes).  On my first try making this I baked it for 10 minutes like the recipe said, and it weeped and oozed liquid out from under the meringue (my first time making any lemon meringue pie). On my second try I baked it for closer to 15 minutes, and it came out perfect! No weeping at all, meringue clung nicely to the lemon filling, and the filling was just the right texture.

The flavor and texture of the pie is excellent: the lemon was tangy and worked well as a refreshing summer pie, while the meringue was light and fluffy. I beat the egg whites, cream of tartar, sugar, and vanilla for 14 minutes. The meringue was perhaps too airy! But the greatest downfall of this pie was its runniness!  I even added extra cornstarch, but the pie was still runny and the meringue pulled away from the lemon custard. I don't know what went wrong!

My first pie... it came out pretty good. I had a hard toime with the egg whites, but then again I have the most horrible hand mixer ever made. The filling was quite tangy but good. I used pretzel crust and it was yummy.

This recipe turned out beautiful! My Dad loves Lemon Meringue Pie so I made it as a special treat on his Birthday. There was a little juice in the bottom of the pie plate, not sure why, but not a crumb was leftover! I'll probably make this again. I doubled the meringue as other posters suggested and it worked out perfectly.

My mother in law requested I make this for mother's day. She asked what lemon filling I used...I told her "my own!" and she couldn't believe how perfect it tasted!   **a few tips**   Make sure you whip the wgg whites until soft peaks form (not just when they are foamy)...it takes longer if you put the sugar in too soon!  Also, I put the meringue on when the lemon curd was still hot, waited until the pie was completely cooled before I put it in the fridge....then took it out after 4 hours and it was weepy and the meringue pulled away from the sides. But the taste was amazing!

Very good recipe. I added lemon juice and yellow food coloring, but i would probably just stick to the recipe next time. My husband is a big fan of lemon meringue pie and he loved it. Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper.

EXCELLENT lemon meringue pie!  Tasted delicious!  Only changes I made: substituted milk for water as recommended by other reviews, and did not add lemon zest as I'm not a big fan.  Added meringue to cook after pie had cooled, which unfortunately contributed to the pie being very weepy, but next time I'll try the "hot filling" method.  Thanks for an excellent recipe!

THIS RECIPE TRIED IS DELICIOUS! I LOVE THIS ONE! THERE ARE SOME MEMORIES I HAD WITH THIS RECIPE. MY GRANDMOTHER USED TO MAKE THIS RECIPE WHEN I WAS A CHILD, AND SHE STILL KNOWS HOW TO MAKE SOME LEMON MERINGUE PIE. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT SHE PASSED AWAY RECENTLY AT AGE 61. SO, THIS PIE MADE SOME GOOD MEMORIES.......AND TASTE!

my first ever lemon meringue pie and for the most part i think it turned out fairly good. i deducted 1 star for this recipe as there are no instructions for cooling. i used the zest from 1 lemon and the juice for 1.5 lemons topping up w/ bottled lemon juice to make up to 1/2cup. unlike a previous reviewer i could not take any for the rinds or zest texture in the pie. i did have some problems w/ a little bit of beading on top and moisture in the pie but that's prob my fault...i couldnt wait for the pie to completely cool b4 i had to try it! i will definitely try this recipe again!

I've watched/helped my mother and grandmother make lemon meringue pies since I was a little girl, but had never attempted it on my own. I couldn't reach either of them to get their recipes but craved a lemon meringue pie, so searched allrecipes for a good substitute for mom's pie. This recipe was easy to make (although I did modify it, using carthecook's suggestion of using lemon and vanilla extracts in place of zest) and turned out PERFECTLY. My husband and I are very pleased with this recipe and will definitely use it again.

I made this and it just didn't turn out that great for me (although I would admit that it was mostly due to my boyfriend :P).  First off, it is a lot of work...I had to call in back up (my first mistake hahaha).  Secondly, my boyfriend couldn't wait for it to chill in the fridge and cut into it too soon :(.  Not a good idea.  It hadn't set up at all yet.  Thirdly, It wasn't lemony enough for our taste.  Maybe lemon meringue isn't our thing.

I made this twice - I also tweeked it a little.  My friend from California sent me these beautiful perfect lemons from her tree.  I used 1/2 cup of lemon juice, 1 Tbsp of zest. Then for the meringue I added 1/4 tsp cream of tartar and a capful of vanilla extract.  no other changes were made and this pie was spectacular.

Looked beautiful but, not edible.  Way too tart!!  Needed more sugar.  My sister actually took one bite and said she couldn't take another.  Followed directions exactly except added 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 tsp cream of tartar to the meringue.  Meringue was thick and wonderful.  Lemon filling was not good.  Maybe it was the lemons  I used...don't know.  Might try again with more sugar.

So let me preface this by saying, I totally forgot to add the butter to the filling.  I don't know know if that's why my filling was just a touch runny.  I would have preferred the filling a little firmer.  But the taste, OH MY!  It's wonderful.  I used the Meringue II recipe, and it was a hit with everyone.  This really is an excellent recipe.

I must admit I was very skeptical when I seen all-purpose flour in the lemon mixture, however, it was not noticeable.  The changes I made was decreasing the water to 1 1/4 cup and using 1/2 cup of lemon juice plus the zest of 3 lemons. The only problem with the recipe is that  the juice and zest of 2 lemons is rather unspecific.  All in all a good pie.

This is an excellent recipe! My only suggestion would be to add a little cream of tarta to the meringue.

My first attempt at making a meringue pie.  used the Meringue II recipe instead of this meringue, and it turned out fabulous.  Next time I won't use a hand mixer though-my arm was almost falling off by the time I was finished!

I made this for a friend's birthday party, as it is his favorite pie. I've never made a pie before, so I was a little wary of trying such a delicate pie as my first-even, but this recipe worked very well. I used just slightly more cornstarch (maybe 1/8 cup more). I baked for 15 minutes instead of 10, which sealed the pie nicely and beautifully browned the meringue. Allowed it to cool at room temperature for about 90 minutes and then refrigerated for several hours before serving.

Good flavor. The only thing I would change is adding another egg white or so to the meringue...my mom likes a lot. UPDATE: I did the curd recipe as follows and pretty much the meringue too; I just added 2 more egg whites and 3 Tbl. of sugar to give more since my family loves meringue!

I guess I should have reviewed the suggestions by other users. I found this pie to be too sweet and not lemony enough. The filling consistency was good and the meringue topping was perfect.

Just made this pie for the first time and it turned out great! Can't wait to see how it will be tomorrow. Although,after reading more of the reviews, I think next time I'll try the Meringue II recipe, because mine did tend to weep a little. I didn't have any lemons on hand, so used lemon juice, but could have use a little more to make it a little tarter. Otherwise, a very good pie!!

I had never attempted lemon meringue pie before and I am certainly not a whiz in the kitchen, so I was somewhat intimidated. My husband brags about his grandma's lemon meringue pie so my competitive side wanted to see if Icould do better. He was very pleased and I was extremely surprised. The only thing I changed is I used a different crust. I'm not much of a pie fan but this was so good!

This was my first ever meringue and I have to say I was quite proud. My only comments are that it "wept" which was a shame, and I think I would have preferred it a little more lemony. But this was probably due to my inexperience. Will make again!

This is delicious, Its my second time making LMP, the first recipe I used was a little longer to make and not as good, I took the topping on while lemon is still hot advice and had no problem at all. The lemon filling was generous enough and the meringue as well as fluffy and sweet.. lovely combo.

I decided to try this after all the great reviews, and it looked great and tasted great, but once I cut into it it fell apart.  So, I'm not sure what I need to do, but I made the filling the night before and didn't refrigerate the pie, also I'm not sure how long I let it thicken on the stove, but it was pretty thick when I put it in the pie shell.  So, I'd like to try it again,  maybe be sure to thicken it real well on the stove   and then make the meringue within an hour and then refrigerate.  The meringue was wonderful - I had the egg whites in the fridge and the beaters in the freezer before I started and added the crm of tarter and the vanilla.

This a great tangy lemon meringue pie.  i would put a little less zest in than it calls for because it is very tart as is.  Everyone loves it though.

This recipe is AMAZING!  I have tried to find a good recipe for a long time and this one is definitely it!  Everyone raves about it when I make it.  I took the advice given and did 3 1/2 TBSP cornstarch and 2 oz lemon juice, 1 1/2 tsp lemon extract, and 1 tsp vanilla extract and it turned out great.  I also let is sit with the oven door open at least an hour after baking to cool and it set much better.

I made this Pie for a family function and they were licking the plate clean.  One tip is not to put the meringue on the pie until it cools an hour or so on the countertop...  never put in the fridge as this increases the chance of weeping...  I find that Lemon Meringue Pie is wonderful the first day when it is fresh and the meringue is in top shape!

This is now my go to Lemon Meringue Pie recipe.  I did it pretty much exactly as the recipe called for, and it turned out great!  It looked good and disappeared very quickly!  I let it chill in the fridge for probably about four hours before serving, and that was plenty of time.

I have never made a lemon meringue pie before, but my family had been asking for one for awhile so I thought I would give it a try.  I should have read many more reviews to find out how long to cook the filling, needs to boil for awhile. I didn't boil it long enough and turned out a bit to runny. And I was unsure about cooling instructions.  So I left it out for a hour or so before putting it in the fridge, and it weeped.  Wasn't sure what that was before I made it but had read it, and as soon as I saw it doing it I knew exactly what it was.  Not sure what to do different to make that not happen.  But my advice on the meringue, do add the cr of tarter and vanilla and then put in kitchen aid on high for 4 or so min.  Turned out GREAT.  My family loved it, even with the problems!

Excellent filling with the perfect amount of tart and sweet, at the same time! It was so good my husband, who is obsessed with pumpkin pie, declared that he liked this better. Impossible!

I was looking for something different to serve for after all the holiday company and found this. I followed the recipe with the suggestion of separate bowls for dry and wet and then putting it together. It was fantastic. The only thing I would change is this is made for a small pie plate and it did not give you a lot of filling, perhaps increase the ingredience.

Really great pie! My husband asked for a Lemon Meringue Pie for his birthday so I made this. We LOVE the tartness of this pie. I changed the meringue based on other reviews..Use superfine sugar, add 1/4 teaspoon of cream of tartar and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla.  Also, add 2 extra Tablespoons of sugar and mix until it is ALL dissolved. Feel it with your fingers to make sure it is dissolved. This will ensure your meringue will not fall.

I have not actually tried this recipe, I was just looking for ideas to spruce up my recipe.  I used the milk/water combo idea - worked great.  Also, for those of you having trouble with weepy meringue, make an Italian meringue  (recipe in Joy of Cooking) and you will have yummy, no weeping meringue.  I also prefer this to ensure the egg whites are done.

This was my first lemon meringue pie, so I can't base my opinions on any other experience.  We felt that the zest from two lemons was way too much.  Perhaps zesting half of a lemon, but that's just our preference.  The texture was wonderful though!  Just the right tang in the lemon mixture.  I added 1/4th tsp cream of tartar to the meringue mixture as I have been taught that it makes better toppings.  The meringue was lovely.  Will make this again, I am sure.

This was the first lemon meringue I've ever made.   The only problem was that the meringue pulled away from the sides after the pie cooled but I heared that isn't unusual.  Will make again next Thanksgiving.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This was an amazing pie!  I only used 1/2 the sugar in the lemon filling to make it more tart per my Grandfather's request, and he loved it!  It was the first pie gone on Thanksgiving!

I made this pie for the first time on Thanksgiving--Not only was it a pretty easy recipe to make, people LOVED it!  I got major compliments on the tartness of the filling and the texture of the meringue.  I watched the "how-to" video on allrecipes before I made it and followed some of their suggestions--the meringue didn't shrink up too much, but it did weep quite a bit.  That being said, the pie was a big hit and I'll definitely be making this pie in the future..

I have made this pie for every Thanksgiving, Christmas, Memorial Day, and Independence Day for the past 2 years now. My grandmother died recently and I never got the chance to get her "secret" recipes from her. I decided to try this one, and the title being "Grandmas Lemon Meringue Pie" was meant to be. After I made it and tasted it, I realized this is it!!! This tastes almost like my grandma's pie she made every year since I was a child. the family loves it, and I am actually making it tonight!!!!

This is my "go-to" pie recipe. It is sooo good and I love how pretty it looks when it is done! You have to make sure to really cook the lemon filling for the full time after adding the egg, otherwise it will "bleed" alot after the pie is cooled!

This is most definitely the best Lemon Meringue recipe i've tried-really easy and VERY tasty-I like to add about 3/4 the amount of sugar and a little extra lemon juice as I like mine quite tart.Lovely comfort food for cosy nights in front of the TV!

oh gosh! the minute I tasted the filling  I knew this would be a gooood one! The meringue was wonderful thanks to some tips I read from reviews, but just below the meringue it did get a little runny, dont know why, and I would also appreciate it if someone could tell me how to cut the pie, because it was a bit messy, otherwise, wonderful! allthough it's the first lemon meringue pie I've made, I think it tuned out really good, even my mom that used to work at Polly's told me it was great, so that's good! thank you for this wonderful recipe! keep them coming!

I used orange juice to make an orange meringue pie. Works just as well and a lot less tart. I am so glad I found this recipe.. I also added more sugar and a about 1/4 tsp of vanilla to the meringue part.

I found this recipe quite tangy where I prefer a little creaminess (although not too rich!), so I used light evaporated milk in place of the water and found it took that intense tang out without taking from the lemon flavour or adding too much creaminess.

Very tasty Pie, I had no problems with the making of this pie. After reading most of the reviews I did make One change and that was adding 4 Tablspoons of Cornstarch instead of 3. I didn't use the Meringue topping ( Hubby dosn't like it), I just used Cool Whip .  Otherwise than that Everything was the same. I would Make the Pie again!!

This recipe was used for my fist attempt at lemon meringue pie and the pie was wonderful. I used a vanilla wafer crust for something different. The only thing that didnt work for me was the meringue. I never did get it to peak. but i will use this filling recipe again, just maybe not the meringue recipe.

Easy and delicious.  Add 1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar to the meringue to hold hold it together (lessen the drips) and cool for one hour before refrigerating for 4-6 hours before serving.  Wonderful!

Fantastic! My husband LOVES this pie. I have to make it every few months or he starts inserting "Lemon Meringue Pie?" into every single conversation. I use a rasp grater zest the lemons and a kitchenaid mixer for the meringue and it's perfect. Don't change a thing.

I made this pie yesterday, it's crazy good. The bits of zest taste like candied fruit in the filling and meringue is the best I've ever made. Thanks for a great recipe.

I thought that this is a very good recipe.  I've made this twice now.  Once with 3/4 cup of sugar and once with 1 cup of sugar.  the first was a little too tart and the 2nd was a little too sweet.  So, next time I'll try in between to get it just right.

Good, but a little bit too sweet to my taste. I'll try to reduce the sugar level next time I bake the meringue pie.

I modified a bit according to others' sugguestion: use 1/4 c lemon juice + milk to substitute the water. I didn't use regular pie shell, instead, I use graham   crackers pie crust. And, I use 3 lemons, juice and zest for the filling.

Really good! Lots of people say the meringue is to eggie. use 4 small or medium eggs instead of large egg and add a little touch of lemon. I made this for fathers day and it was really great.
For the crust I used graham cracker crumbs and butter. Its alot easier.
Overall a great pie!

I didn't read the reviews about how to let it cool, so it was runny when we cut it.  But it was still so good! I will definately try again.

Really good! We cut down the sugar in the filling. The frozen pie crust we used got soggy, but will make a scratch crust next time! Thanks for the great recipe.

This was so good! I made two pies - one to give to my SIL as the lemons came from her tree and one for us.

I took others advice and used milk instead of water, 4 tablespoons cornstarch and no flour. We love lemon so I added a little juice to the meringue. My only regret is that I used a store bought crust as I haven't mastered making my own and I didn't want to mess up on this.

I will definatly make this again. It was great!

I made this pie for a party we attended, I have a recipe I have been using for years but after reading the reviews on here I thought I would give this recipe a try.  I was told that my pie was fabulous.  It was a lot more lemony than my recipe.  I also used 6 egg whites for the meringue which seemed to work out perfect.  This is now my new lemon pie recipe.

My favorite food is Lemon Meringue Pie. Needless to say, I have ordered it at every restaurant my whole life. This is the best pie I tasted yet!! Just delicious! The only problem was that I didn't babysit the meringue in the oven and it burnt a little so I made it again and then left the oven door slightly ajar. It came out perfectly! Thanks for posting!

Very good.  I like the way the lemon plays off of the sweetness of sugar in this recipe.  The meringue could have held up a little better though.  The pie without the meringue would be a five.  I did not have a zester, so I just used a medium grater-worked well enough.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving and it was the most eaten pie on the table. I used the "Never-Ever-Fail-Meringue" recipe from this site, without the cornstartch mixture added, and it was perfect! Nice lemon flavor and it set very well. When sliced and served it was picture perfect. Thanks, will make again!!!

Make sure you have a mixer, otherwise your meringue may not come out. (which mine NEVER turned out, I tried doing it by hand.)

But the filling came out perfect! I will remake this...but i need to buy a mixer first!

Great recipe.  First time I made lemon merinque pie and my family loved it.    To give a more lemon flavor, I added approx. 1/8 C more lemon zest to the recipe.

The filling was way too runny... we ended up trying to eat it by spooning the filling as a sauce over the meringue.  It was also too sweet.

Disappointing!  I thought that being 5 stars this pie would be the best.  It did have a great flavor but after being put into the refridgerator it got extremly soaked with a runny liquid (which ruined the crust).

I was truly disappointed with this pie. I was expecting one like I get at my local "Village Inn".
My family thought it was OK. I didn't like it at all- the meringue was fine- but the lemon mixture was bad. it was very runny and had a funny texture, almost like runny JELLO. The flavor was freaking me out, it tasted eggy- it also had this weird flavor that's hard to describe-too tart but sweet enough. It was weird. This was the first dessert I've made in a long time that I didn't like- I was  truly disappointed.

It was good, but not the best I've ever had.  The filling was VERY tart and more of a pudding-like consistency, rather than "set" like custard.  I added some cream of tartar, the meringue was weepy pretty fast too.

I made this for a dinner party & everyone loved it. The filling is really good. I added cream of tartar to make the meringue. My meringue did shrink & separate though. My mom suggested making double the meringue so you can really adhere it to the crust. I think I'll try that next time. Still tasted great!!

Tasty, excellent consinstency of the lemon filling and easy to do ! - Even though I omitted the lemon zest and the salt (I thought it was too much)in the filling. i used a homemade crust. For the meringue, I followed the advice of other reviewers and I used 2 teaspoons of lemon, instead of cream of tartar, to make it stif.

Great recipe! My father loves lemon meringue pie and absouletly loved it! I suggest using an electric mixer for the meringue because it is almost impossible to do it by hand.

Grandma had an excellent recipe! The family loved it. The pie set up perfectly and had great colour.  The meringue wasn't that great but that was most likely my fault.

I had been looking for a Lemon Meringue Pie that tasted like my beloved grandmother used to make. I had tried a few recipes on this site, but none of them came close until I tried this one. This recipe is AWESOME. The flavor is so wonderful, and this recipe is so easy to make. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

could use more meringue.  also was pretty tart, which can be good, but if you're serving someone w/a sweet tooth, consider upping the sugar.

For 30 years my husband has asked me to bake him a Lemon Meringue Pie like his grandmother used to make for him.  I finally made him one with this recipe - he actually said the taste was "orgasmic"!  He raved about it & said it was exactly like he remembered.  The only change I made was to add about a teaspoon of lemon extract to give it an extra pop of flavor.
Excellent recipe!

Personally, I found this pie to be too tart.  However, others who ate it liked it that way.  I think that "2 lemons" may be too vague as lemons come in different sizes.  Maybe mine were too big.

Wow, what an easy pie. Once the pie crusts are made and cooled, this takes literally 5 minutes to make!! It turned out SO good and I never even attempted to make one like this before. I dontl ike merangue topping, so I beat heavy whipping creme into a fluffy topping. Tried it today for Easter and everyone loved it!! 5 stars all the way. Will be in my recipe box for years!

This is an easy pie to make and the flavor is great.  However, I think I cooked the filling too long because it turned out quite firm.  Also, after chilling the pie, it was very runny.  I will attempt this again, though.

I love lemon meringue, and have made it before, but using a pre-made crust, and one of those Sherriff's mixes for the lemon part.  This is the first time I've made the entire thing from scratch, and I was quite pleased with the results!

After reading the reviews, I decided to use storebought lemon juice, instead of juice from freshly squeezed lemons.  Based on the info from the reviews, I decided to try using an amount between 1/3 cup and 1/2 cup of lemon juice, and that seemed to be a nice balance of tartness and sweetness.

My lemon filling turned out nice and thick - no problems with runniness, like some other reviewers had. (I did make sure I cooked and stirred for quite a while)  I added 1 tsp cream of tartar to the meringue, as I usually do, and that turned out nicely, as well.

The *only* problem I had was that layer of water or juice between the lemon filling and the meringue.   It wasn't a major issue; I noticed it becaused I'd seen so many other reviewers mention it.  I didn't refrigerate the pie, but just left it on the counter after baking and served it fairly soon after that, so I'm not sure what the problem was.

Still, it's a very good pie recipe!  I think it's one that I'll be making again, since it's not very difficult and looks beautiful.

It was good, real good. My only suggestion, cut up the lemon rind into real small pieces. Very delicious nonetheless.

I thought this pie was fantastic.  Surprisingly easy to make (this was the first from-scratch lemon meringue pie I've made), and I thought it tasted great.  

Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious and easy.  My pie came out perfectly and this is one of the easiest meringue recipes I've ever seen.  I hand squeezed my lemons and next time, I'll use an extra lemon or two to get a stronger lemon taste; or use a juicer.
I will be making this pie again.

This is one GREAT recipe.  I made one for Thanksgiving and one for Christmas and both were great hits.  I've never made a Meringue Pie before and this recipe was very easy.  The zest of the lemon and fresh lemon juice make this one of the best Lemon Meringue Pies I've ever had.

Emilie, Thank you for this recipe. It might take a little work but all good things do and this was one of them. Anyone can take short cuts and when someone says hay good pie they like the compliment. Then when someone takes the time to go though the extra work from scracth and pay attention to detail, and someone tells them great pie, well I'm pleased to tell them where I got the recipe. My dad isn't with us any more but this would have been one of his favorites. Thank you Emilie

The best recipe for pie I have tried so far.  Forgot to put in the fridge overnight, so meringue shrunk and the filling pulled away from the shell. Put it will still taste wonderful, just does not look as pretty!  
My boyfriend say's it is the closest to his grandmothers of all the recipies I have tried. 
I used 6 egg whites, 1 extra tbs of sugar and 1 tsp of cream of tartar in the meringue, as others had suggested. Turned out lovely (till I shrunk it)

What a delicious recipe. I was a bit nervous as it was my first time making a home-made lemon meringue pie--but the recipe was easy to follow and everyone raved about the taste. I followed some other reviews and added about 2 tsps of gelatin to the filling but that was it. Yummy!!

Yummy, I love lemon pie and I love meringue, now everyone loves lemon meringue pie too!!! This pie is easy and good. I used 1/4 cup lemon juice and about 1 and 1/2 lemon zest; I taste it before adding the yolks to adjust the flavour. For the meringue, i use superfine sugar (berry sugar) and it looks great, I also add some vanilla powder. My meringue shrinks, thanks to a review I know what to do, but for some reason, it leaks something, then dries off, despite that, it looks great and tastes amazing. :D (if you have any suggestions as to why it leaks, please post, I use imperial baking margarine)

This was a great and easy recipe. I loved the way it tasted and I am not a fan of Lemon Meringue pies, but I made this for my fiancee and we both enjoyed it. I used the shortbread crust recipe that I got off this site and that was good with it. Made it a little richer.

This was my first attempt to ever make lemon meringue pie, and it turned out perfect, which really surprised me. I like that all of the ingredients are usually right here in my kitchen, so I can whip this up at the last minute, like when we have a craving for something lemony. It takes a bit of concentration to get the filling done, but even with my 3 year old assisting me we did fine. The result was absolutely delicious! Thank you!

I found the filling to be wayyyy tooo Tart! So the next time I make it I will be cutting back on the lemons. Another problem I ran into was the fact that when you put the filling back on the stove after adding the egg yolks, it does not tell you how long to cook the filling before pouring it into the pie shell. It was thick but not thick enough, even after sitting in the refridgerator it was still a little runny. What is thick to one person might not be to another, there should be a temperature and time limit on cooking it before you pour it in the shell.But other than all that the filling did taste good,it was just too tart!

This recipe was way too tart!  I added extra sugar, but it only helped a little.  If I was to make it again, I would only use one lemon instead of two.

This was wonderful. This is my mothers favorit pie & she said this was the best she has ever had. 
I didn't measure the just lemon juice, just used 2 of them and that may have been a little much. Next time I will squeeze them into a mesuring cup.

I didn't have much luck with this recipe. I am still searching for that perfect Lemon meringue pie but this wasn't one for me. My lemon custard was very runny . It may have just been me though, maybe I will give this one another try at x-mas.
Thanks anyway.

This was a pain in the butt to make but soooo worth it.  I think what made it so hard was I didnt have a lemon zester and also I wasnt sure how thick to make the custard.  I didnt change anything except I added 1 tsp. of cream of tarter to the egg whites.  The pie turned out wonderful and everyone who tried it loved it.  I thought it tasted a little gritty but that may just be because I HATE cornstarch.  Overall it was a yummy pie.

I do not especially enjoy lemon meringue pies.  However, I decided to bake one for my boyfriend who adores them.  I used milk instead of water and a store bought crust. The pie came out perfect. Not only did my boyfriend find it fantastic, but (to my surprise) so did I!

I thought this recipe was very good.  The next time I will leave out the lemon zest, I thought it was a little too tart.  Very good & easy to make.  Thumbs up!

Moderately easy to put together.  Great recipe if you want the classic Lemon Meringue Pie.  This is a sure bet.
