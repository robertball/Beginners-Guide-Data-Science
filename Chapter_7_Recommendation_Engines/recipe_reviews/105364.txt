I have never been the 1st to try a recipe. I am always waiting for others.. I am soooo glad I did not pass this one up. DELICIOUS!!!!!!! Followed recipe and generously put on country ribs. I added some fresh lime juice and a little olive oil. I did marinated overnite and then put it on the grill.   Thank you for sharing!!!!!!!

Used a few tablespoons of this on pork roast one Sunday, and it flavored the meat very well! Coriander added a unique punch.  I like the idea of using it as a gift too; it would be a foodie gift that stands out from the usual.

It was good, maybe a tablespoon less of cumin next time.  I added a bit of Splenda (or sugar)to taste, which was a nice addition.  As Karen mentioned, lime would be nice added with this too.  Thanks.

I have been using a similar rub, minus the paprika and allspice, for years. These are good additions. Last night I decided to brine the pork chops first and was very happy with the result. I put 2 pork chops in a large zip lock bag with a mixture of one cup of water to one table spoon of salt. I didn't want to make it any more complicated because the rub is so flavorful. I let it brine in the fridge for about 3 hours (so as not to over brine). Then I rinsed them in cold water and patted them dry. I applied the rub and let them come to room temp about a half hour. Then I seared them and baked them @ 425 for 25/30 min. They came out very moist and delicious. It's a great way to prevent drying out. I did cut back on the salt in the rub by half because of the brine. There was plenty of left over rub. I should have stored it in a jar because I will def be making it again! I served with pineapple mango salsa,and black bean and corn salad. For appetizers i made guacamole and salsa, and we drank margaritas and coronas. Great easy, fun, and very flavorful dinner to entertain.

Fantastic multi-layered flavor. This ones goes to the top of my rub lists. 2 lb pork tenderloin put in a cold oven while I went to the gym -- 35 minutes at 425 and came out perfect -- moist and delicious.

I used this tub on some very lean rib tips, and it was very good at seasoning the meat throughout.  I let the rub stand in it over night and then lightly brushed the rub in before smoking .  10# of rub tips used up a doubled recipe of the rub, generously spread.  Thus rub seems to have a tendency to dry the meat , so if it is a lean cut be prepared to add some wetness to the process along the way.

This was soooo good! Made with half the amount of cumin, a tsp of powdered stevia, and regular chili powder. I literally coated thick-cut pork chops in it. Threw them on the grill for about 7 minutes on each side. My family raved about them. Moist and lots of flavor!

Love this. My kids don't like spicy so I omit the hot pepper. I use it to cover pork shoulders that I smoke on a pellet smoker.

I made this because my husband doesn't like sauces for my chicken wings. He likes dry rubs and I love coriander and cumin.  I didn't quite have enough cumin but probably close to 5 tablespoons. I added a bit less salt because I didn't want it too salty. I also added about a tablespoon of crystallized lime since others thought it would be a good addition and I have it. I also added  2 packets of stevia because I wanted it a little sweeter. I loved how it turned out and so did my husband. Even the kids wanted his pieces of chicken instead of my sauce pieces. I'm so happy I have extra rub for a later dish.  This was a bigger hit than expected. YAY!

this was a five star recipe with some minor modifications.. i cut this down to 4 servings as we were going to grill three 8 oz boneless pork chops.. i had about 2 tsp to 1 tablespoon leftover which was accurate for the yield.. i was worried that the cumin was going to overpower everything else so i cut it down to 2 tsp.. and cut the chili powder (i used new mexico chili powder) to 1.5 tsp.. i then added 1/8 tsp of cayenne for a bit of heat as i didn't think my chili powder to be very hot.. i followed all the other amounts for the rest of the ingredients.. serving this up with grilled white corn on the cob and brown rice.. ty for the recipe

Yes I tried this.  Used it over in Scotland at my home there.  Indian seasonings are a favorite over there so the response was beautiful.  I sent the guests home with little cups of the seasoning to try in their recipes. I used this on Chicken breasts instead of pork, wow it was wonderful.  I like it because it has NO garlic but it isn't skimpy on flavor!  So many recipes for meats and main dishes are loaded with garlic that drowns out everything else.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Warning: too much salt.  I love the flavor, but the salt is a bit overwhelming ... will hold back next time, but there will definitely be a next time!

Had this tonight with pork steak, presents a very complex flavor and an overall unique taste.  It is one of those tastes you can't get enough of.  Followed the recipe to the letter and the meat was tender and juicy. Would recommend it and will use it again.  Everyone raved including my finicky 80 plus year old parents.

My husband said this pork roast is of restaurant quality. This is a fantastic rub, I'm looking forward to using it on other meat dishes.
Thank you for sharing. 
I did order your magazine, can't wait to receive it.  Everything I tried from the one that was given to me has been extremely good.

OMG, I hate to over-exagerate, but this rub is amazing! We used this on pork chops that we put on the charcoal grill and not only did it get a thumbs up from everyone at the party, it kept the chops moist despite the grilling. Definitely something we're keeping around from now on. We're about to use it again tonight!

I just happened to have all those ingredients for the rub; and now it's along side my other spices in its own special bottle.  Delicious on our pork steak.

My husband is not a pork chop fan, but this rub won him over to 'the other white meat' in a hurry! I will use this rub on chicken, ribs, and maybe even sprinkle it on my breakfast cereal (kidding).

Excellent rub! I l especially love cumin and thought the flavor was excellent. Used on boneless pork chops and grilled in a tabletop grill. Very good!  Can't wait to try on other things.
