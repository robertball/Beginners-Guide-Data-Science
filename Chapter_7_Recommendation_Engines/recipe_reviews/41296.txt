I AM ONLY GIVING THIS TWO STARS AT THE TIME BECAUSE IT THINK IT WAS THE GROUND CLOVES I DID NOT LIKE. I WILL TRY THIS AGAIN WITHOUT THEM AND I THINK I WILL CHANGE MY RATING.

These were delicious. The whole family loved them. The BBQ makes this sandwich. They were super easy to make too which is always a good thing. I will make these again.
