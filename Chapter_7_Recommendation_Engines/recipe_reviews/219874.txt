These are excellent.  I made them generally as written, but with the following minor changes:  used Panko bread crumbs instead of italian (only because I didn't have Italian on hand), used chopped fresh basil instead of the fresh oregano but did put in about 1/2 tsp dried oregano so as not to miss out on its flavor, 3/4 tsp dried rosemary instead of fresh, 1/2 tsp regular mustard (no dry mustard on hand).  

Flavor is great.  In fact, they remind me of italian sausage (yum).  These did not need a broiler pan....the turkey didn't produce any fat or run-off.  In fact, 30 minutes was a little too long and mine were a touch dry.  I had scaled the recipe down to 1 lb ground turkey and rolled the meatballs relatively small, so maybe that had something to do with it.  Next time I'll start checking them at 20 minutes and see when they're done.  I will definitely be making them again!

These were the best turkey meatballs I've ever made.  I used the fresh oregano, rosemary, and parsley, and I think that made a big difference.  I also cut down the crushed red pepper to 1/4 teaspoon which was perfectly spicy enough.  I also have no idea what Melt is so I just sprayed the broiler pan with an olive oil Pam spray.  I served simply over thin spaghetti with a light marinara sauce and a side of broccoli rabe.  It was delicious!

Used jarred spaghetti sauce instead of tomato sauce, grated vs. shredded parm, and proportional dried parsley, ground rosemary and a little less fresh oregano per other reviewer's recommendation. Very flavorful! The recipe for 1 pound of turkey perfectly made 20 meatballs with my cookie dough scoop.

Loved this!  I actually became a member of All Recipes just to rate it!  I did, unfortunately, have to make some changes based on what was in my kitchen.  Plus, I took some advice from Michelle A's comment.  I used 1 pound of 93% lean ground turkey.  1/2 tsp dried oregano, 3/4 tsp dried rosemary, 1.5 Tbsp fresh basil, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper (hubby doesn't like spicy), 3 Tbsp finely chopped yellow onions, and 1 Tbsp light butter.  Everything else was as listed above.  I made 20 meatballs and baked for 20 minutes which was perfect. Tastes like a sausage meatball!  Hubby asked me to be sure to not loose this recipe. 1 meatball made with my changes is 60 calories and 2.5 g fat.  Still plan to try the recipe as written, but I had to rate it since it is a FABULOUS base recipe!

This was a great recipe and easy to make! I substituted grated parmesan for shredded and would recommend a little less oregano next time around. But they were AMAZING! Great addition to almost any pasta based casserole.

The meatballs were very flavorful with the tomato sauce and herbs. I omitted the Parmesan cheese and Melt® Organic Buttery Spread because of my dairy allergy. The meatballs were a little dry with out those ingredients. Next time I'll add an 1/8 cup of olive oil.

I used my ice cream scoop to portion out each meatball but they were huge. I took each "ice cream scoop" of meatball and cut it in half and it was still huge. I wish I had used a smaller scoop.

Made these just as recipe instructed minus the Melt.  Excellent meatballs.  Dropped temp just tad while cooking to 385° and cooked until internal temp of 180-190 was reached, about 30min.  Kids ate them up with only compliments.  Now this recipe' s a keeper and plan to make often as much healthier than traditional meatballs.

Very easy and very good!  This was my first attempt at meatballs. I didn't have bread crumbs so I crushed cheese and garlic croutons in the blender.  I also used dry parsley, oregano, & rosemary because I didn't have fresh herbs on hand. I added a dash of worcestershire sauce to the tomato pasta sauce, and baked them on a cookie sheet.  They were awesome with our spaghetti! Then my mother accidently overbaked them so I added about 1 1/2 cups of barbeque sauce and we had another delicious meal with rice!

Loved these meatballs. They turned out great and my husband didn"t know they were turkey. He"s used to beef and he liked them. I will definitely make these often. Thanks!

These were just OK.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Just wasn't impressed.  I would not make them again. The parsley made the meatballs a little strong for my taste.  I don't waste food so I'll finish them.  I ended up adding turkey gravy and mixing it with rice to tone down the parsley flavor.

Best meatballs I ever made! I did sub fresh basil instead of the parsley, fresh rosemary and dried oregano. Used the standard equation when using fresh or dried: 1 Tbs fresh = 1 tsp dried.  20 minutes they were done, with a slight crispiness and fantastic flavor.  This will be my go-to recipe  from now on.meatballs

I added an egg white, substituted the bread crumbs with 1/4 cup of oatmeal, and cooked them on the stove top in a little beef broth.  I didn't use the tomato sauce or Melt and they turned out great!

Best meatballs I've ever made!  I'll never make them any other way.  I did use dried spices rather than fresh because that's what I had on hand, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  If they're this good with dried spices I can't wait to try them with fresh!

These were so easy and tasty!  The meatballs were light, flavorful, and moist.  I prepared the recipe exactly as written, just a small exception subbing fresh basil for parsley. My preparation yeilded about 36 smallish sized meatballs.  I sprayed a cookie sheet with Pam instead of the Melt (sorry, no Melt in these parts!).  I cooked about 17 minutes at 400*, perfect doneness.  I'll use this recipe many more times.  Thanks, Melt!

This was yummy.  I didn't put mustard or red pepper flakes in as my family don't like spicy food. And only about 1/8 tsp fresh rosemary.  I made it with one of the four packs of ground turkey I bought at Costco. I made smaller meatballs(IKEA meatball size) and it made 73, baked them on the cookie sheet lined with parchment paper for about 20 min. Will make it again:)

These were delicious! Very flavourful and moist, stayed together nicely. I used pasta sauce because I didn't have tomato sauce. Omitted peppers for the kids. Will make these again.

Love this recipe! I’m NOT a cook an these turned out great! I did make a few changes.... my daughter is celiac so I crushed up some GF crackers instead of the breadcrumbs. I reduced the amount of oregano (I’m not too fond of oregano lol), and I didn’t have any red pepper flakes so I put in a little cayenne pepper. Awesome! I’ll definitely be making these again

Excellent!!  I did have to make some minor changes based on what I had on hand and some other reviewers suggestions. I only had 1lb ground turkey, but I also had 1/2 lb chicken sausage and mixed that in. For the herbs I did 1/2 tsp dried oregano, 3/4 tsp dried rosemary, 1.5 Tbsp fresh basil as well as the 1/3c fresh parsely. Added 3 Tbsp finely chopped yellow onions, and substituted the crushed pepper for black pepper. I used a marinara sauce instead of tomato sauce and grated Parmesan instead of shredded. For the bread crumbs I used half plain and half seasoned as I thought the chicken sausage would already have enough extra seasoning. Used my cookie scoop to make 35 meatballs. Baked at 385* for 30 minutes. Perfect!! Everyone loved them! Thanks for the recipe!!!

These came out fabulous!  Only made minor adjustments. Left out the butter spread and the tomato sauce, but put in 1/8 cup of olive oil.    Used fresh herbs and added some basil.  They were fabulous!!

The things i omitted in this recipe are mustard powder (bec i dont have any) and red pepper flakes (bec we dont want it spicy.) instead, i added freshly ground black papper. It was amazing! Everyone whi tried it loved it! It made it delicous bec of the fresh herbs and the right amount & balance. I cooked it for 20 mins, 400 deg and it was perfect. I checked it with the thermometer to make sure it was cooked. I attached a picture of the size of the meatballs. I used a little over 1 tbsp per meatball and tried to make it the same size as possible.

I am working on teaching my teenage son cooking skills. He did a great job with this recipe and it should be a winner with his roommates in college. They are very simple to make. They are a healthier version than beef meatballs and they were great with marinara. They would make a nice meatball sub as well with some provolone. Will definitely be keeping this one!

I've made this a few times and plan to make again tonight.  Absolutely love them.  I make my meatballs a about an inch size and get 40+ from this recipe.  I also use Cento double concentrated tomato paste that comes in a tube.  Great flavor!  One of our new favorites!

I don't know what I was missing but they just seemed a little too soft for my liking. It didn't seem like it had a strong hard base in it. But, the taste of it following the entire recipe - excluding the melt butter (I just used Pam spray) - was absolutely great! We made our Own vodka sauce too and mixed well. Cooked for 20-25 mins in the oven for 400-450.  

Good recipe just missing something - either from me or the recipe - to make it more hard meatballs.

These were awesome. I omitted the rosemary. I didn't want them to taste like sausage. Next time I would add some sautéed onion. They were very flavorful as is.

I used this recipe for my baby girl's first birthday and they were a huge hit. Perfectly moist and flavorful. I had different sauces set up for people to dip their meatballs in but the sauces were unnecessary. These were the best meatballs I ever made and this will definitely be my go to recipe when I make them again. Thanks so much for posting.

very good.  Believe it or not, just began experimenting cooking  entrees with ground turkey as my husband is more traditional. wow! used fresh rosemary and oregano from my garden. Substituted prepared spaghetti sauce (Rao's) for tomato sauce.  These were AMAZING.

Thought these were great!  I used dried herbs (proportionally) and grated dry Parmesan, since that was all I had on hand.  I also used gluten-free bread crumbs because I have a wheat allergy.  I did put an egg in it to hold them together and they turned out great--put marinara sauce over them and served them over spiral rice pasta.  My husband went back for seconds.  =)

I really liked these. The rosemary makes them stand out in your spaghetti. I used 1 egg instead of the tomato sauce.

These were so good. I wanted to use what I had at home and only had 1 pound of turkey Italian sausage so I used that and adjusted the other ingredients, just sort of eyeballed it but it came out fine.  I  also didn’t have fresh herbs but used Italian spice blend and it was very tasty. I’d make these again in a heartbeat but would probably try it with the actual ingredients as listed. I like that it didn’t have an egg in it. The texture was great. They meatball were a hit. I served them with sautéed onion and green pepper cooked with diced Italian tomatoes. Super yummy!

Went down well with the kids. Made them small sized. Substatuted a few things. Two tea spoons dried origanao and djone mustard. Missed Che red Pepper out as the kids don't like spicy food. Still worked well and a good firm texture. Will be making again

So delicious!! I only used a pound of ground turkey so I adjusted amounts slightly. Very flavorful. I’ve never used sauce in my meatballs, always did egg, but these went together (and stayed together) perfectly with the sauce as the only wet ingredient. Made them night before and while I usually let things cool a little while before putting in fridge, I had to put these away warm so I didn’t keep eating them. Hahaha

These were delicious!! Followed the recipe but cooked them in an air fryer at 380 for about 15-20 mins and they came out great. I didn’t use butter but I sprayed the air fryer with a coat of olive oil. My very picky 3 yr old even loved them!

This is a godsend.  A family member had a quadruple bypass and needed to change his eating habits.  I made the recipe as written only leaving out the cheese and substituting 1 tablespoon of olive oil for the melt.

He liked them served over spaghetti, and as left overs as a meat ball sandwich when a quick meal was needed.  I am going to use the meatballs instead of pepperoni in a low fat pizza.  A reviewer said this tastes like Italian sausage which is a great substitute.

I have tried several recipes from other sites and this one beats them by far.  Having to work from what I already had; I substituted Italian seasoned diced tomatoes instead of sauce, I didn't use Oregano and I only used 1 lb. of ground turkey, and I added 1/4 tsp. of onion powder.  I would definitely make this again and again. YUM!!

These meatballs turned out juicy, flavorful, and fantastic.  I did make a couple minor changes. I used grated Parmesan, seasoned breadcrumbs, and since I didn't feel like buying fresh herbs since someone them would have gone to waste, I used tomato sauce that had basil and oregano added already. I can't wait to make these again.

I rated this 3 stars because the liquid was too little, I even doubled it up but still too dry. Next time, I would add an egg. The seasonings were a little overwhelming.

My family loved these! I feed a crowd so I doubled the recipe, added a package of Sweet Italian Sausage and also used sprouted bread crumbs for a healthier carb option. I also added a 15 oz. can of diced tomatoes without draining. The seasoning was wonderful as called for, but I did improvise and use dried herbs and cut back to 1/3 of what was called for when using fresh. I will definitely be making these again!

This will be my 4th time making these delicious meatballs. They're just wonderful and my 5 year old loves them.

I made the recipe almost exactly like written, save the mustard because I didn't have any. 

Still, these are great.

These are now the preferred meatballs in our house.  They freeze well, so you can make a lot and pull out some as needed. I omitted the red pepper flakes because one of us doesn't like things that are too spicy.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  I've made them several times now, and will certainly make them again.

This is a great recipe! I used 2 pounds of lean turkey breast and adjusted the rest of the ingredients accordingly. I didn’t have Rosemary (dried or fresh) so I omitted that and added dried basil and they were still delicious. We love spice but still thought the crushed red pepper should have been cut in half. I let these meatballs simmer in organic pasta sauce and we ate it for three days straight! Flavorful low fat dinner.

These came out great! I used a combination of feta and Parmesan; mostly feta. I paired them with whole wheat spaghetti, off-the-shelf light Alfredo, and some canned Italian style diced tomatoes.

I work as a Caregiver.  My patient loves ground turkey and also loves Italian food. I'm also Italian,  so I made these for her.  She LOVED them!!  They are a win-win.  I didn't have the dry mustard, so I made these w/out that one ingredient.  The Parsley, oregano, and rosemary was also dried, not fresh, so I used 1/2 the amount.  Still came out delicious and tasty!!

These are incredible. I couldn't believe how tasty they were.  I have now made them twice. Followed the recipe (tomato sauce I only had ketchup). First time, I made them for a pasta dish. The second time, we had friends over and I made them as an appetizer. They were delicious straight out of the oven and disappeared very quickly ! I put out different sauces with them. Will definitely be making these again. Thank you.

Loved these! I tried to follow as closely as possible with what I had on hand. No tomato sauce, but I did have fresh tomatoes that I let simmer and puréed into a sauce. The only fresh herb I had was parsley, so I used that, but for the rest I used the same amount that was called for, just dried versions. Didn’t have Italian breadcrumbs so I used regular breadcrumbs and threw some Italian seasoning on top. I have no idea what Melt is, so I didn’t use it. I put some foil down on a cookie sheet, sprayed it with cooking spray, and cooked for 20 minutes. They were so good! I had 1 pound of ground turkey and made 21 meatballs. Definitely making again!

Healthier alternative to beef -  less fat.   Very tasty  and reminded me of italian sausage.  I used a few squirts of mustard instead of dried mustard and substituted store-bought spaghetti sauce for tomato sauce, then served with the remaining sauce over the meatballs and spaghetti.  Delicious and quick to prepare.  I will be making this again!

Turned out great!  I used panko bread crumbs because that’s what I had onhand, and increased the salt a little.  Definitely use the 93% ground turkey and not the 99% fat free turkey.  Otherwise they will turn out very dry.

These were tasty! I seared them in a skillet and then put in a slow cooker and they turned out moist and had good flavor. I used a jar of turkey gravy instead of the tomato sauce. Will make again.

Great!  Lots of flavor by accident. I used one pound of turkey.   This will be a new favorite!  And, I didn’t have Parmesan. I also made QUICK SPAGHETTI SAUCE BY JON that is perfect and simple from our frozen summer tomatoes. Love, love, love it!

These were delicious and pretty easy to make. I slightly tweaked the recipe to my taste - I used stale hot dog buns for the breadcrumbs because that's all I had! My family loved them, flavorful and moist.

I put more tomato sauce (about a half cup) to make them more moist. Excellent - my family loves them and you can’t tell they’re made with turkey meat.

This was my first time making anything with Ground Turkey.  They were delicious.  Will definitely be making  again.  Instead of putting them on a broiler pan I cooked them on a sheet pan lined with aluminum foil for easy clean up and a cooling rack so I didn’t have to turn  them.

I’ve made these several times.  I typically use two pounds of meat and just increase seasonings a bit. I use dried herbs and fresh grated Parmesan cheese. They taste pretty great with dried herbs in my opinion, and it’s just easier overall.

Really liked these. I didn’t use quite as much parsley and would cut down on the red pepper flakes next time.  A little spicy. I dropped the bills into simmering pasta sauce.babd simmer for an hour orbso. That way they stay nice and round and the sauce is absorbed some. Will make again.

After reading many of the reviews I made several of the same
changes.  This is a very easy and really tasty recipe.
Just reduce the parsley & oregano, and use a Tbsp. melted butter.  I used the italian bread crumbs.

Awesome.  I used dry spices versus fresh, and didn't use the buttery melt - and they are as good as any meatball I've ever had.

These came out very tasty! I used olive oil instead of the melt butter and they were excellent! I almost dodoubled my recipe as I had 2.5 lbs of ground turkey on hand. I used a large ice cream scoop to make meatballs as uniform as possible and still came out with approximately 30-33 meatballs.  I love the fresh herbs, especially the basil, so I put a bit extra in as well as an additional clove or 2 of garlic as I like garlic too. I didn't double the crushed red pepper which was fine as you could still taste a hint of heat which I was still just the perfect amount without being too much.  I also felt like I needed to add eggs as a binder so I added 2 eggs to my 2.5 lbs of meat mixture which worked out quite well. Instead of sauce, I used one small can of V-8 juice to my amount which also worked out well. I mixed equal parts of 2 grated cheeses to the mixture, both Parmesean and Pecorino which proved for a wonderful savory taste! I baked in the oven for approximately 15 min per side in olive oil. They were Delicious!  My husband and I couldn't stop eating them. Oh and I also added about 1 quarter to 1 half cup of olive oil to the mixture itself because I was afraid of it being dry since it was lean turkey. They were not dry and I would definitely make them again! Enjoy!

So good! I have been looking for a good lower calorie meatball recipe and this is it. Made it exactly as directed, except without the "Melt", and would not change a thing. To make it so that we could calculate  the 188 calories a serving, I made 24 meatballs, so 3 would be a serving. It was perfect and very filling. For 24 meatballs, it took 15 minutes to cook in a 400 degree oven.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because  my family destroyed them.  I wasn't too thrilled with them. I will make these again, next time I'll back off on the Italian seasoning,  it was a little overwhelming to me, but again my family destroyed them..Edna.

Made this after a weekend of birthday celebrations and consumption of lots of pizza and birthday cake. Made with a whole grain pasta and homemade veggie sauce. They did not disappoint. Very tasty. Often forget turkey is a great substitute for beef, and better for you! Enjoy!

Made it and followed the recipe with the exception of using dried herbs since that is what I had on hand.  Used conversion chart for accuracy and I left out the melt (sounds like extra calories to me).  They were delicious and I calculated 4 meatballs = 2.

Only change was that I omitted red pepper.    I served them with simple homemade red sauce but was popping them plain and I don't usually do that with meatballs.   These were FABULOUS!  I totally understand the reviewer who joined just to rate them.   My very picky husband said- he still gives ground beef "the edge" but that for a substitute these were great.    That says a lot!   Personally, if not for the pale color I would confuse them for beef.   I admit I had low expectations for turkey meatballs so maybe that contributed to my literal excitement (had to call my mom to brag) but it cuts both ways because  my low expectations are set because turkey can't usually be passed off in lieu of beef for me.  But these were delicious!   How great to find such a super healthy dinner that will satisfy a meatball craving.   And loved using the fresh herbs.   Sooo good!   Try them!!!!

The tastiest turkey meatballs I have ever had!  I substituted the tomato sauce for some of the marinara  I was using in my pesto-marinara sauce.  I added some basil and thyme too because I didn't have Italian bread crumbs, only plain.  Served it over spaghetti squash instead of pasta.  Yummy!!!

I used beef because that's what I had. My review is based on the original recipe but I did make some changes that fit my family and pantry. I didn't have bread crumbs so I replaced them with crushed flatbread sea salt crackers. I also replaces the tomato sauce with an egg. I used essential oils FDA approved for consumption. These oils were one drop Rosemary, one drop oregano, and one drop black pepper. The flavor were good but difficult to mix. Next time I'll lightly mix the egg with the oils before adding to the meat mixture. And I will make again!

Great reviews from the family on these. My teen boys asked me to make another batch. Next time I will make some big ones for meatball subs, and some smaller ones for spaghetti and meatballs.

I did not add butter because I wanted less fat and I did not have dry mustard so I just added a little dab of prepared mustard and it came out delicious served with zucchini pasta and white sauce. It made a wonderful dish the whole family enjoyed

This is a terrific recipe! I used dried spices instead of fresh (what I had on hand), halved the Rosemary and halved the crushed red pepper. I was out of parsley so used dried basil as a substitute. I used olive oil spray in place of the Melt. I used an air-bake pan, which slows the cooking, so finished in 17-18 minutes instead of 15. I will definitely make these again, the whole family loved them!!

I never thought turkey meatballs could be so good! I tried to stick to the recipe as much as possible, but didn't have all the ingredients. I did take Michelle A's substitutions & other's suggestions.  Dried oregano, fresh basil, 3T onion & 2 cloves  minced garlic.  Baked 400 degrees for 20 minutes. Perfect!

These are perfect. I paired them with the zucchini pasta recipe with pesto and olive oil. We do not use the butter. We sprayed with oil oil instead. Not sure how they could be any better. Very fresh flavors.

Though I love the health aspects of turkey, I always considered ground turkey a bit bland. This recipe really changed my mind!
(  I too have a husband who swears he doesn't like turkey and he has asked me to make these again. ) You just have to have common sense when you use a recipe;  If you don't love parsley, don't USE so much. If you you like your tomato sauce with zip, don't use plain tomato paste. With this recipe I used all of the listed ingredients but added 2 tsp. olive oil for moistness. I didn't use the Melt stuff because I've never heard of it ~ Just sprayed the pan well with cooking spray.
 I will definitely make these again soon!

Great recipe and love the taste. Fast, as these were oven-ready and rolled by the time my oven preheated. Rather than 'melt' I used a coconut oil spray on my pan annnd rather than a breadcrumb, used some leftover quinoa - worked out well and added more flavour as it was a veggie flavour quinoa.

My husband and I absolutely love this recipe! I made a few substitutions.  I use 1 package of turkey ground (that's usually 16 oz & 1 lb). Also, I use Panko vs Italian breadcrumbs. I used dried herbs and when I ran out of parsley I used dried cilantro. Also I used a tbsp of olive oil instead of butter.  Also, I made slightly bigger meatballs using a 1/4 cup measuring cup - made 9 in total.  They were awesome, moist and delicious.  Oh, we use sun-dried tomato spread vs pasta sauce and loved the flavor.  Also trick to keep your hands clean - after mixing, using measuring cup shape each meatball in plastic wrap. A tip from my hubby.  Enjoy!

They taste leafy. There is way too much oregano in this recipe. I used Pam instead of Melt and they burned and were stuck to the pan. They also did not hold their shape and fell apart.

Very easy. Nice and clean kitchen since no frying required. Instead of fresh rosemary and oregano I used dried, and instead of dried mustard I used real since I didn't have them at home. I also used Pam spray since I didn't have Melt. I like them, but let's see what my husband will say. if it's up to me, I will make them again.

The 1 lb package of turkey made 21 small meatballs.  Only had dry spices. Good served w/ gravy and a baked potato. At the end I put them in the broiler for 2 min to darken outside. 2nd NOTE: It's easiest to double the meat and ingredients, so there's enough for another meal. Go easy on the red pepper.

I swap out the buttery spread for olive oil and I often make beef meatballs with this recipe (I leave out the rosemary for that).  Excellent meatball  -  as well I make them a lot bigger than they suggest - I get twelve meatballs from this recipe.

I've made a few variations of this recipe based on what's in my pantry/fridge. Fresh herbs do make all the difference, as does the shredded vs. grated parmesan. Even when we don't have all the proper ingredients on-hand, this is still one of our household favorites!

I love these meatballs. Taste great and easy too. Make with spaghetti squash or zucchini pasta and it makes a great healthy meal. The next time I make them I am going to leave out the cheese since you can't taste anyway and sprinkle on top.  I also added a little Italian sweet sausage one time and it added a nice extra flavor.

Excellent recipe and easy to make. I love the strong flavor the fresh herbs give the meat balls.  It can also be used for sausage patties.  I omitted the red pepper; used seasoned salt instead of salt, and regular mustard because I did not have dry mustard on hand. I'll be making them again.

I pretty much followed this recipe exactly except that I used dried Italian Seasoning.  I used a medium scoop and placed them on parchment paper and then drizzled olive oil on top.  Baked at 350 for 20 minutes.  The bottoms were golden brown.  Had to taste test the first one before adding to the sauce and they are very tasty.

I have made these twice now.  Can't say exactly as stated, as to personal tastes and on hand ingredients.  First time I used all dry herbs and over did them for sure.  They were good but I also knew I had to try them again.

The few adjustments I made this time were largely  based on previous reviews.  This is what I came up with and both myself and husband enjoyed the same meal which is uncommon!  

I had  1  1/3 lb container of turkey....used same measurements as recipe but skipped the rosemary.  Used fresh parsley and cut the fresh oregano to 2 TBSP,  and  2 tsp of dry chopped onion.  I used 1/3 cup each of Italian and Planko bread crumbs because we love and had both.  Lastly I used 3 tsp of jar chopped garlic with very little liquid which is so much easier than chopping.   Cooked at 390 for 20 minutes and then placed in a pot of marina to simmer for a bit  just to meld a little bit more.

Great sandwich on toasted roll with  shredded 6 Italian cheese melted on top and a side salad.

I used a small ice cream scoop to guide my sizing to be somewhat consistent.  It  made 20 balls.  They looked small but after cooking and putting in sauce, and thinking about serving over pasta etc, it is a practical size.

This  will definitely be a regular addition, especially for the fall and winter.

Delicious! I did not have fresh herbs (except parsley) so used dried and used parm-reggiano cheese. These were great and I can't wait to make them with fresh herbs.

Made n they were REALLY delicious n flavorful. I didn't have the fresh ingredients so I used dry, u know the stuff in your pantry, and they were Great! Next time will add garlic, didn't have any. Also added a little seasoned panko as well as, Italian breadcrumbs!! I used an Asiago, provolone, and Romano, natural shredded cheese. Not even that fresh is the ones u buy n hold onto for months and they turned out great. I would eat them on a sand which or over pasta, very flavorful.

I used 2 tablespoons of mrs dash salt free Italian seasoning instead of all other spices. Used plain bread crumbs because that is what I had on hand. Used olive oil to coat the pan and brushed it on top of each meatball.

My husband and I loved this recipe. No substitutions made on the actual meatballs. The fresh herbs were excellent and not overpowering. We don't have a broiler pan so I just baked the meatballs in a greased ceramic baking dish. Cannot wait to add this to our regular dinner rotation!

I used grated instead of shredded and also when I made this I didn't get a chance to go food shopping so I used dried ingredients and it still turned out great!!!

We love these! I have made these with turkey, chicken, and ground beef. I alter the amount of herbs to the equivalent to dried and ground herbs instead of fresh. The rosemary sets these apart from other meatballs. Yummy!

Love this recipe! Only thing I changed was using dried parsley, rosemary and oregano. Other than that, it was great. Ill put a little less parsley in it next time, but that's it. This one is a keeper!!!Someone else said their husband thought it was regular beef. Mine did too!

I was looking to try a different turkey meatball recipe, and came upon this one. I followed the recipe, except that I have no idea what Melt Organic Buttery Spread is, so I just used a butter non-stick cooking spray to spray the pan. I can't  imagine that this altered the flavor of the meatballs at all. The meatballs were okay, but not great, in my opinion. The taste of fresh oregano is a bit strong, so perhaps a bit less would have been better. I also thought they could have used a pinch more salt. I served these with spaghetti and a simple tomato sauce. I thought they were a step up from "just okay", so I would give them 3 1/2 stars, but when I asked my husband what he would rate them, he said 3 stars.  I will keep searching .

Too much oregano.  I would make these again but omit the oregano and substitute with an Italian seasoning, or make them with already flavored ground Turkey.

This was great!  I'm not usually a fan of ground turkey but this recipe made it very flavorful and I will most definitely make this again. I used Pam cooking spray on foil, substituted ketchup for the tomato sauce and baked 22 minutes.  I didn't turn them over and they didn't stick. This will soon be a family favorite.

I've made these 3 times. They are the best way to make turkey meatballs. Don't expect a beef taste. But, they are flavorful and much leaner than beef even with the bread crumbs and cheese.
Some tweaks: Italian seasoning and dry parsley instead of fresh herbs, shredded cheese, ketsup instead of tomato sauce. I also used extra bread crumbs to make the turkey easier to work with. Drizzle with a little olive oil before baking. Also, turn them at least once while baking or they will burn on the bottom. I don't blame the Melt folks for trying to get people to use their product, but I use cooking spray on a cookie sheet and that was fine.

Oh yummy! I just made the meatballs to go with zucchini pasta (also from all recipes, of course) - so delicious.  My husband likes to make meat-meat (sausage/beef) meatballs, but that's just too much for me. So, I looked for a turkey alternative - this recipe is great!  I gave one to my husband to try - hot out of the oven -needless to say, he is having the turkey meatballs - he was surprised how good they taste.  I used Panko Bread crumbs and some dried herbs because I didn't have fresh.  I think the red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese really 'beef' up the taste - pow!

Just made a double batch of these and after testing a couple, I give them a thumbs up. I used dried equivalents of all herbs except for the garlic and rosemary. I substituted pizza sauce for the tomato sauce only since I had just enough on hand and was looking for a good use. The only addition I made was one egg. The only omission was the "Melt", which I've never heard of and feel was unnecessary. These seem quite moist if you don't overcook them. If I basted them with anything prior to baking, it would probably be olive oil rather than margarine.

I made mine a little larger so they took longer and were done at 375F because my oven is notoriously too hot. I cooked them on parchment to protect my good cookie sheets. I plan to freeze these immediately, wrapped tightly in meal-sized packets using Glad Press-n-Seal. They're great to add to a quick pasta meal or to use as an appetizer when time runs short. They're also much healthier for you than the flavorless, spongy, who-knows-what's-in-it things you get frozen from the store!

Fantastic- but make sure you use FRESH herbs and chop the rosemary very finely or you will have
 porcupine-y meatballs. I don't use MELT, but do use a combo of olive oil and butter on the broiler pan.

These were awesome. I used ground turkey breast and a mix of fresh herbs (rosemary and oregano) and dried, just based on what I had on hand and in the garden. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly, except I just spayed my baking pan with olive oil PamI made mine on the bigger size - about golfball size and they did not dry out at all. Great flavor and texture. Will definitely make again!

Very easy and delicious.  I had all the ingredients in the house except the fresh spices, so I subbed in dried ones and they came out so good.  My family doesn't usually like turkey, but they all loved them!

I just made them! Wow!! I cut the recipe in half, as there are only two of us. I used fresh herbs and they are just fantastic. I did not use Melt organic buttery spread. I baked them in a cookie sheet on top of small racks sprayed with canola spray. Absolutely delicious!! I will freeze some and believe me will make more!!

The flavor was delicious, I omitted mustard, and used garlic powder instead of gloves but taste was still great. Only complaint is my meat balls got kind of mushy and fell apart. Maybe it needs an egg instead of tomato sauce?

I thought these were pretty good. I was concerned the bread crumbs might be too dominant, in the taste and texture, but they weren't. The Italian seasoning taste is really strong, so consider that when making these to pair with other food items or sauces. I didn't have the type of margarine suggested, so I used half margarine and half butter and baked them on a foil lined sheet. I used a cookie scoop and did 2 scoops per meatball. I had 1.25 lbs of ground meat and followed the recipe as is except for adding my own seasonings to plain bread crumbs to make them like the Italian flavored ones. I find the saltiness to be less. They were done in 30 minutes, flipping once, with that size.

Made these a few times... they're excellent! I only omitted the butter spread and I don't think I missed out on anything. I made these much smaller that suggested, which means my baking time was much shorter. If you make them small, watch carefully! The last thing you want is some dried up meatball. Made these with my favorite pasta recipe and was very, very satisfied :)

This recipe is quite good. I had to substitute dry herbs for fresh as I didn't have them in the house. I also didn't have a broiler pan, so lined a cookie sheet with foil and placed a cooling rack on top of that. Worked really well. My kids liked these meatballs, which is the ultimate compliment.

Followed directions except for spraying the broiler pan.  Used canola oil spray.  Flavor was disappointing.  Will be continuing my quest for a tasty turkey meatball recipe.

We liked it. I didn't use the Melt and didn't want the calories and it turned out well.

Love it.  I used cilantro instead of parsley because that's what I had.  Also I used Italian Style Panko.  I used olive oil spray instead of butter.  They were yummy and surprisingly moist.  (I usually find turkey meat balls dry, but not these!)

These are just ok. I liked the texture. They are easy to make. But the flavor is just very bland in my opinion. I think they could use some onion to boost the flavor.

Great recipe!  This is the first time I have made turkey meatballs and I will definitely do it again.  I used ingredients I had which were as close to the recipe as possible - dried herbs, plain bread crumbs, accidentally added basil (thought I had the oregano)- they still turned out great.  The red pepper and minced garlic gave them a little extra kick.  This one is a keeper.

This recipe was good and simple. I used regular butter and I tweaked the amount of herbs to my liking (multiplied by 3!), although he still knew it was ground turkey. :-P
