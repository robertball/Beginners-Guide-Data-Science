This was easy, fast, and loved by all! The only changes I made were to add fresh cilantro, about 1/2 cup chopped, instead of oregano. Cilantro and cumin have a great Mexican flavor. I also added fresh mushrooms, because we love mushrooms in everything. And you can't go wrong if you add some avacado on top!

These turned out really good, it was an easy recipe, I cooked the peppers and onions separate from the meat to appease family members not interested in any vegetables whatsoever.

These turned out really well. I doubled the recipe - if you double the recipe, double all the ingredients but keep the onion and lime juice amounts the same. Don't worry, the lime flavor isn't overwhelming - it's actually quite delicious. My cook time was much longer than 20 minutes for a double batch, but I also wanted to give the lime juice time to reduce a little. Overall, a nice, tasty dish.

I left out the spices and used fajita seasoning, it was a big hit with the family.  It was quick and easy to make. Gave four stars only because I didn't make the recipe exactly as it was written.

We really enjoyed this - far better than the dry packaged mixes.  I had all the spices on hand.  We grilled the chicken on the grill first and just threw in about the last minute of cooking.  Since I had fresh cilantro I added that as well.  I won't use a packaged mix again

Delicious! Super easy and quick cooking meal. I did not have as much lime juice as called for, so I also added a bit of lemon juice. Use red, yellow and orange bell peppers, too, for an even more beautiful dish!

Just okay, really. It needed something else.

Used veggie oil, since out of olive oil and added some dried cilantro to the seasonings.  Great, great, great.
