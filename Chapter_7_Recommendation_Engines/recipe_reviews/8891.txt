This is the most disgusting recipe ever...on paper.  I thought it was some kind of a joke.  It got good reviews so I made it for my wife as she was having some friends over (who better to experiment on?)  It was a huge hit!  I was asked for the recipe by a couple of people (though I'll have to change the name so I stop getting asked "who's Cindy?")

Don't worry about getting the wings perfectly covered with the preserves - it all slides off anyway.  I cooked at 350 for the hour and got nice browning - I could see where 400 would burn.  When done, just pour the whole mess into a crockpot to keep warm and serve.  Be sure to have pen and paper handy so people can write the recipe down...they *will* ask.  I've been told I have to make this recipe for family at Christmas too (have I raved enough about it?)

I've made these wings several times now.  I love the flavor but I do think that the instructions are faulty and that's why I can only give it four stars.  After several tries and ending up with runny, watered down sauce, I decided to experiment a bit.  What I've ended up doing is to put the frozen wings in a roasting pan and cook them for about an hour (or longer) to thaw them, draw off the extra water and to render most of the fat.  I drain that off and mix the jam, soup mix and Catalina dressing together then toss the wings in the mixture.  I spread them out on a greased jelly roll pan and then broil them until one side is done.  Then I flip them all over and broil until the second side is cooked and the sauce is thick and sticky.

It takes MUCH longer than the original instructions but it's the only way I've found to not have the sauce so watery that it was pointless to have it there at all.  If someone else has a better way, please share it because I love the flavor from this recipe but they are a bit more work than I have to invest at times.

It's still worth making this recipe though!

Very yummy!  I admit I didn’t follow the directions exactly.  I placed all the wings in a large disposable roasting pan.  In a separate container, I mixed together the preserves, soup mix and salad dressing for an even distribution of flavor.  Then I poured the mix over the wings.  I baked for 45 minutes at 350 degrees, then increased to 400 degrees for the last 15 minutes of cooking.  Wings were served with sauce dipped over them.  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks Cindy!

Hello Everyone!  Thanks for the great reviews and variation tips for my recipe (I've started using more apricot preserves than what the recipe calls for and drizzling a little less catalina dressing--using about half of the bottle). When I originally submitted this recipe I suggested using frozen wings.  However, I've found that using fresh wings, cutting them into individual pieces, and turning them over half way through cooking keeps the glaze from getting too watery.  Just thought I'd pass on this little tidbit of information.  Also, with regards to the temp....I recommend 375 to 400.

these were great! made them for an anniversary party they went quick!  I didn't layer the ingredients,  I put all ingredients in a bowl, let it marinate overnight, let wings come to room temp on the counter then baked 250 for 3 hours. WONDERFUL!

I never thought to use the ingredients for chicken wings, I use the ingredients for cut-up chicken parts.  Instead of the Catalina salad dressing, if you can find Wishbone RED Russian Dressing, it will give a less sweet taste than the Catalina Salad Dressing.  This is a quick and very tasty chicken dish.  I get rave reviews and requests for the recipe whenever I bring this to a party.

There wasn't a parent during the 70's that didn't know about this sweet little recipe. I learned this from my mom when I was little. I don't make wings a lot but I do use this recipe with discounted chicken that I deskin. This also works in the crockpot, but I half the sauce. Add pepper, minced garlic and a little dijon mustard to pep it up a bit.

Very tasty, as the name suggests. My partner loved it, and I loved it as well! The temperature is too high, however. I baked them at 350 F for one hour, turning them over once at the 30 minute mark. They turned out perfectly! Thank you for sharing it!

This did sound gross, but trust me, you NEED to try this! It was wonderful!!! I ended up putting the wings in the oven for the first 20 minutes to thaw them out a bit then after that I poured the sauce on and baked them for another 40 minutes. The only thing I would recommend is to put foil on the bottom of the pan. The sauce burnt to the bottom of my pan and I had to soak it quite a few times until I could get all of the sauce off. Other than that, this was wonderful!!

As suggested by other reviewers, I lowered the cooking temp to 350°. They were superb!!! Sweet, tangy and very moist. They were a hit at our picnic. Thanks!

These were excellent.  I got rave reviews from my guests.  Very easy to make.  I marinated overnight as others suggested and baked in the oven the next day at 350 for 1 hour and 400 for 1/2 hour.  I put everything into a crockpot to keep warm to serve later in the afternoon.  This is a keeper!

Both excellent and tasty. I used the recipe for wings & thighs. I put all ingredients together plus a splash of hot sauce and one tablespoon of minced garlic brought to a low boil. I ten poured the sauce over the chicken and baked @ 350 for 60 minutes then @400 for an additional 20 minutes to brown. YUMMY!!!!  ** I only used HALF of the dressing **

I've never posted a review before on All Recipes, but I have to say, this recipe warrants it! My family and I just finished devouring these wings, and the only words that were said during and directly after were "These are the best wings I've ever had."  I used the advice of mixing the marinade sauce ingredients before pouring it over the wings. The only addition I made was one and a half teaspoons of cayenne pepper to give it some kick.  This will be the only way we have wings from now on! I wish I had more RIGHT NOW! :)

Some modifications: used about 5lbs unfrozen wings, 1 jar of apricot preserves, 1 full bottle of Catalina Free Salad Dressing, 1 package of Lipton Onion Soup Mix, baked at 375, sprinkled with paprika and then covered with Frank's Hot Sauce (about 1/2 cup). Tender, juicy, and nice flavors!

I've made this several times just as written.....  but this day, I discovered I had only Peach preserves and not very much.  I did have a very ripe pear, so I ran it through the food processor to a puree and added it to the 1/2 cup of peach preserves.....  it was fabulous.  I suggest trying this with any fruit.  I also like to take "before" pics.... very nice looking going in the oven as well as coming out.

Good, easy recipe, although I used fresh wings, which was alot of work...I wouldn't recommend it if you're in a hurry! I mixed all sauce ingredients in a bowl, then tossed in the wings to coat. Thanks for sharing Cindy!

These really are verrry tasty, Cindy! We loved the flavor of these.I didn't have apricot preserves, so I used Peach. Yum. If you're tired of the same old Soy Sauce/Teriyaki flavored wings, try these! They are unique tasting, easy to make and make a great presentation. They are a rosey brown color, rather than the dark brown we so often see.This will be a keeper for many years to come at our house! Thanks Cindy.

Another "good" recipe. I've had better wings found from this site but I wouldn't classify this as bad either.  I'm pretty particular about my wings I guess. Although the recipe doesn't state to thaw the wings...are you suppossed to cook them in the oven frozen? I don't know but I choose to thaw them and then I quick-fried them in a pan (maybe 5 minutes) so that they wouldn't be mushy (texture issue for me). I took another's advice by mixing the dressing/onion mix & preserves together before pouring overall for an even distribution of taste. A little sweet but good.

I didn't want the runny sauce described by other reviewers, so I used 1/4 bottle of Catalina. the edges of the sauce were burned and the chicken was perfectly glazed, so we'll just soak the pan overnight, that's all! I also didn't have onion soup mix on hand so I used a heaping tablespoon of beef bouillon mix and a tablespoon of dehydrated toasted onion flakes, mixed all in a bowl and poured over wings, and added 6 drops of Scotch Bonner sauce (will double that next time.) Perfect, very delicious, a keeper! Thanks Cindy!

I had tried these at a party years ago and loved them.  Asked for the recipe and have been making them for numerous occasions ever since.  I also mix all the ingredients (preserves, onion dip and Catalina dressing) in a bowl first then pour it over the drummettes or wings in a large, deep sided aluminum pan. I cook them at 400 degrees for about two hours, stirring occasionally and draining some of the fluids after two hours. I cook for another hour with the lesser liquid so the glaze thickens and browns on the chicken. Very, very tasty and I'm always asked for the recipe.

I had problems with the sauce burning.  If I make it again, I will try cooking it at a lower temperature.  The part that wasn't burned was very good, though.

Hello Again! I'm Cindy the author of this recipe and I want to thank everyone for your input, it's very much appreciated! I added this recipe to this site about 10 yrs ago and never gave much thought to how many people it could reach.  I've made some adjustments to the recipe by using a little more apricot preserves than what's called for; drizzling a little less catalina dressing--using about 1/2 of a small bottle; and using a family size pkg of fresh instead of frozen wings. I've found that using fresh wings, cutting them into individual pieces, and turning them over after 30 mins., seems to keep the glaze from getting too watery. I even tried putting the 3 ingredients (catalina, preserves, onion soup mix) in a pot to simmer and pour over the wings.  That worked out OK, but I prefer to put on the ingredients individually. I agree the temp should be 375 and sometimes I'll turn the broiler on the last couple minutes to brown them some more, if needed. Thanks again and I'm glad so many people have enjoyed this recipe!! :)

The recipe was really good...But the only change I made was that I deep fried thw wings first (without any batter)then I coated them in the sauce and baked them until the sauce was heated through.

Have made these a few times now and have had nothing but compliments.  I have changed it just a little since making them the 1st though. I use Kraft tangy tomatoe and bacon instead of Catalina. Instead of using a whole bottle of dressing I only use a 1/2 to avoid it being to runny. Depending on the crowd I have also added a few drops of Red Hot sauce. Marinating the wings overnight works great as well. Everyone that has tried these are amazed at the wonderful flavor and at the same time are suprised of the simplicity of the recipe.

Wow!  I tried this recipe out tonight, and it's a KEEPER!  We don't like chicken wings, so I put it over chicken tenderloins instead and baked them for an hour.  Absolutely excellent with rice (for the kids) and mashed cauliflower (for the adults). I've been making a labor & ingredient intensive sweet & sour sauce for years, and this tastes almost the same (actually better), has only 3 ingredients, and goes together in a flash. I'm throwing out my old recipe LOL.

I've used this recipe for years on plain old chicken breast and never once thought to use it on wings!!  The best part about this recipe is you can alter it by using different types of fruits.. I've used cans of whole cranberries or orange marmalade before and it was just as delicious!  I make it thicker, so I use 2 cans or jars of fruit and the 8oz of catalina or russian dressing!   
Thanks for a new twist on an oldie, but goodie!!!

I made these yummy wings for Superbowl...They turned out great!  I used fresh wings, marinated them overnight in a ziplock and poured the whole mess into a pan the next day.  Cooked them at 350 for 40 minutes.  I transferred them into a crock pot to stay warm.  Fabulous!!

I made the wings twice because I really wanted to love them based on the reviews.  It was nice, but I wouldn't make again. 

The sauce had a great consistancy.  I took previous reviewers' advice and cooked them plain with just salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  Drained them after 35 minutes then put on the ingredients for another 30 minutes.  

Broiled them at the end to crsip them up a bit.  Got lots of raves, but I felt that they needed more flavor.  

Super easy.  Hard to ruin these.  Good luck.

These wings are divine. I used fresh wings and added salt, pepper and garlic, baked them at 375 for 45 minutes and 10 more minutes in the broiler. I also mixed all the ingredients before tossing the wings.

LOVED THIS! The flavor was amazing!! I admit I had to change it slightly because I didn't have all of the ingredients, it was still the same though. I used boneless-skinless chicken breasts, orange marmalade,  French Honey dressing, and beefy onion soup mix in the crockpot. Even my husband said this recipe is perfect!

I made this recipe again and it is still amazing! I mixed the dressing, soup mix and apricot together in a bowel and then poured it over the chicken. I baked them @375 for 1hr 15mins. Talk about "finger lickin' good."

These wings were on point.  The first thing I love about this recipe is that there are only 4 ingredients and they all happen to be common things you might have on stock.  I didnt have apricot preserves but my real fruit grape jelly worked just as well.  I turned the chicken after about thirty minutes.  I also drained the fats and put them back in under the broiler.  Other then that I followed the recipe.  Yummy

These wings and sauce are very similar to a recipe my daughter's kindergarten teacher made for parties. It was a hit with the kids, and most adults too, although it is not something I would want to eat as a main dish, as I find it a little too sweet for that. But it is a great party food (with napkins!), and easy, too!

First off let me just say that my boyfriend is probably the PICKIEST eater in the whole world.  So when he said that these are the best wings he ever had, I knew it was a keeper.  I didn't know where to go for apricot preserves, so I made my own by mashing up about 4 apricots (cut and mashed up) in a bit of sugar water and boiling them for about 10 minutes.  I also added a little lemon juice to the pan for an extra kick.  Then I spread all the ingrediants on the wings one at a time and baked for an hour.  PERFECTION!  Thanks, Cindy!

these were wonderful! I ended up baking them at 325 for 3 hours, and I mixed the sauce ingredients together and poured them over. Flavors were excellent. We all loved them at our superbowl party.

As suggested, I reduced catalina by half.  I baked the frozen wings for 35 minutes, drained off fat and then added sauce.  It was very good.

I made these for BUNCO at my house.  They were so easy and turned out fabulously!  My picky husband also loved them!  I used orange marmalade instead of apricot preserves (mainly b/c I already had it on hand).  Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

After reading other reviews,  I thought I would give it a try even though I really thought the ingredients were odd.  Overall these wings were edible however not very good at all and came out an odd shade of pink. I Followed directions 100%,  so I thought I had done something wrong. I will not be making them again.  Sorry Cindy.

ONE IMPORTANT THING: you cannot bake these wings at 400 degrees because they will BURN!  turn the oven to 375 and watch them.  I bought the big box store 10# frozen wings in a bag and 1/2 bag of  these is 5#.  I defrosted them first so they would not be sloppy.  What my store carries is Apricot/pineapple preserves,  and Catalina/honey dressing is what I used  and I added 2 tlbs of soy sauce. I also mixed all the ingrediants together before spreading on top the wings as it would be messy putting dry soup mix on top and then the other mixes... I just could not see why Cindy did not mix them together first. ???  I have made a similar recipe before.  Good simple recipe  But watch that they do not burn.

Ok, so this recipe is a regular in my house! This recipe is so original! My kids absolutely love these wings down to my 17 month old! Plus, they are even tasty cold. Looking at the ingredients I couldn't believe these could be good but what a treat! Thanks for sharing!!!!

these wings tasted GREAT! made them last night for the super bowl and they were a big hit.  i baked them for 30 minutes and then drained off the fat and i also mixed all the ingredients together and after baking for 30 minutes i just poured the sauce over the wings and baked for another 30 minutes.

Excellent flavor!  As others suggested, I mixed ingredients before tossing with the wings and baking for more even distribution.  I turned the temp up to 425 for 10-15 min at the end to brown them.  They turned out great, but next time I'm going to try turning the wings about half way through so that the tasty sauce coats both sides well.  This is a keeper!!!!!

I saw your recipe tonight and decided to make it for myself and my girlfriend.  I looked for the ingredients in the fridge and had to "wing" it a little (so to speak).  I used Orange Marmalade instead of the Apricot Jam, with a little fresh shredded ginger root, and Russian Dressing instead of Catalina.  It turned out pretty good and next grocery day I'll be trying the recipe as it was ment.  But GREAT recipe all together ;-D  Thank You!

This is an easy and flavorful recipe. To make it spicier, I added 3 Tbls. of Dijon mustard to the preserves and instead of catalina dressing, I used Mae Ploy sauce (found in the Asian dept. of the grocery store). I also baked it at 375 degrees for 45 mins. and then turned it up to 400 degrees for the last 15 minutes. Here in Hawaii, we like it spicey/sweet and hot. Aloha!

Delish flavor but the skin was a bit soggy, maybe next time I'll cook the wings in a bit of oil first, also couldn't find Catalina Dressing so we used French, turned out great!

After reading the list of ingredients I thought there was no way these would turn out. However, having faith in the reviewers on this site, I tried it as an entry in a wing contest at work.  FIRST PLACE!!!  Easy, surprisingly delish and a first place winner!  Wow!!!!

These wings make me happy for so many reasons...first of all, they couldn't be easier (I do them in the oven AND I've done them in a crock pot)...but they make the husband happy...and he's not usually a meat-on-the-bone type of guy, but he was ALL about Cindy's wings :)...thanks!

Yummy Yummy! And could not be easier! I mixed ingredients in bowl plus minced garlic and hot pepper flakes. By request, I double the amount of wings and you still have plenty of sauce. Cook for 2 hours at 300. Throw into crockpot and off to parties I go. Huge hit! Thanks Cindy.

I Love this recipe!! as does my family! The sauce has wondeful flavor! I do however cook my chicken for a while first and then drain before pouring on the sauce which i pre mix. I then cook them until they fall apart and look glazed and yummy! I have done this with wings and with chicken tenders and serve with rice...the sauce is great on the rice! I have also added pineapple and green pepper chunks to this sauce.

These were sooo easy and great! I made them for a party and had three people ask for my recipe! Since the party a couple months ago, I've made the wings at least 5 times! Everyone loves them! I took the advice of others also and mixed all ingredients and poured over the top fo the wings. Works like a charm!

This is a great and easy recipe using a minimal of ingredients. I also used 1/2 bottle of catalina dsg and apricot/pineapple preserves.(will try Russian next time.) Baked it at 400 degrees for 50 minutes and was nicely glazed. Thanks, Cindy.

Me and my girlfriend were hunting for a good wing recipe and decided to look here! WOW!!! What a great recipe. We both loved it. Just one thing....our sauce was kinda runny....we are not sure how to thicken it up just a little. But in saying that,its still top notch and totally rocks! Thanks a lot, we sat here, watch the Cubs win and ate a ton!

I didn't have catalina dressing, so I used italian, instead of apricot, used boysenberry jam and it was different.  It was pretty good, smelled wonderful though.  Not sure if I'll try again...maybe when I get the right ingredients.

Pretty good recipe. I altered it slightly by changing temp to 350 for an hour. Also, broiling it at the end can give a nice crisp finish to the wings. I will make these again.

We made this tonight for a Wing Fest Challenge.... The only change we made was that we added a bit of freshly grated ginger.  We breaded them and deep fried them then put them in a crock pot with the sauce.  They were the best.... We even won 1st place in the wing challenge.  Everyone loved them.
Thank you!!!

I'm still looking for that perfect wing recipe, but this is getting pretty close! I think next time I'll throw an extra pinch cayenne into them for a little more pep.

This is hands down the best wing recipe I have ever used. The only thing I do differently, and it is a big difference is that I very generously sprinkle chile powder on the wings. Everyone tells me how the combination of hot and sweet is fo fabulous. It's not too hot for those who don't like hot and it is enough for those who do like hot. Thanks for a great recipe.

Pretty good wings. I tried this recipe because of all the positive reviews. Not as dynamite as they were hyped up to be, but still a tasty, simple recipe. I'll try them again.

We made these along with 2 other types of wings on a day we were grilling burgers and bratts. I would've never thought it would have tasted so good but got so many compliments.   A few of us spooned out some of the sauce and put it on our grilled burgers and it was DELICIOUS!!  It's so easy to make I will definitely be making this sauce again!!

I've made these wings for fundraisers and block parties and they are always a hit. Only change I've made is that I let the wings sit overnight in the fridge to soak up the flavors before I put them in the oven. Not only is the taste outstanding, it gives the wings that "sneak up on you" heat after you've eaten one.  These are a huge hit and so easy to do.

I have made these twice over the holidays for parties I have attended.  Both times they were well received. The second time I used "reduce sugar" apricot preserves and Free Catalina.  What a great low calorie treat with great flavor.

I made these for a party and got good reviews. They weren't as popular as the buffalo style sitting next to them. The onion mix didn't "rehydrate" enough for my liking but the final taste nice and sweet.

I must have done something wrong because the ratings are so high for this recipe.  I am a novice when it comes to the kitchen so that may be why these wings were average at best.  I doubt I'll ever make them again.  My wife also thought they were good for nutritional supplement but nothing more.  We ate them but just because they were there not because we enjoyed eating them.

These were ooey gooey good.  My only regret was not making more.  The bits of onion from soup mix were a nice flavor.  (A friend of mine recognized the recipe and said she makes her meatballs like that,  but w/russian dressing,  like some other folks had mentioned.)

Made the wings and everyone really enjoyed them, after reading the other reviews I added about 3t of prepared mustard and about 1 1/2 T of hot pepper flakes to cut down on the sweatness. Big Hit !

I made this recipe using chicken drumsticks. I mixed all the ingredients together instead of layering.The sauce did slide off while cooking. I just kept basting them w/the left over sauce. next time I will still mix the dressing & jelly, but I will sprinkle the onion soup mix on. My dh & daughter liked it, I thought they were a little bland.

I made these a while back and everyone raved about them.  Should have made more that time.  I'm going to try these tomorrow but am using frying chicken legs this time.  Also, will marinate them after putting all ingredients in a plastic bag for a couple of hrs. before I bake them.

I mix all the sauce together and reserve some (and simmer it) so there is not a lot of runny sauce. These are really good wings.

I made this for July 4th and everyone ate them up. My kids like them as-is but my husband asked that I add a little heat to them. Has anyone ever done that and if so, how much and what did you add? Tabasco? chili powder?

I will definitely make these again.

The sauce was runny and the wings were like candy.  No tang, no taste, just really sweet and sticky. I will say that the wings came right off the bones, so that was the one positive.  I don't think I'll use this recipe again.

Used this as an idea and substituted what I had on hand.  Mandarin orange dressing, roasted garlic and onion soup powder, Peach preserves.  Hope it turns out as good as I hope.
