Delicious! I made it for a Christmas party last Tuesday and will make it again for tomorrow. I had to bake it a little extra...60 minutes. I think I will put a little more than 1/2 the batter on the bottom of the pan this time; the cranberry layer sank a little too much, in my opinion.

Keeper Alert!  Make this!  Butter and Flour (not just grease) the pan for a really great crust.  Place the spring form pan on a sheet pan - there will be a little leakage.   I had to bake mine for an additional 20 minutes - cover the top with a loose piece of foil to prevent over browning.   Next time I would toss the cranberries with a little of the flour as well as the sugar, to keep them from sinking.   Awesome recipe.   Thanks!

simple , pretty and fantastic flavor. Made as written, used frozen cranberries, chopped in the food processor for a few sec with sugar and a little flour. Doubled the topping. Cooked 20 min longer than written and would cover for the last 5-10 min next time (top was a little overdone). Brought to work and it was completely gone by 10 AM!

I cut this recipe in half and used a 6" springform pan and it came out wonderfully moist.  I also chopped up frozen cranberries because that's what I had on hand and they dropped to the bottom.  I, later read, dusting them in flour may prevent that.  If anyone has any additional suggestions, that would be great.  Overall, it was delicious and I'm glad I cut in half because I think I might have eaten more than half of it, one sliver at time, over two days :)

I made this with rhubarb and it came out wonderful. I'm sure it would work with many different fruits.

This is without a doubt a really wonderful sour cream coffee cake.  Not too sweet but the topping adds a just right  balance.  Moist and delicious!

I found the batter a little thick.  I may have added too much flour. I will try again but this recipe is to die for. My coworkers loved it. A definate keeper.

This is a great recipe. I love crumb topping so I doubled the final step and had more crumb topping to work with. The cake was a big hit at my Mother's Day brunch. Will definitely make again!

Definitely a keeper.  I only made 2 adjustments.  I replaced the almonds in the topping with pecans (what I had on hand) and I also greased and floured the pan.  I used frozen cranberries (leftovers from Thanksgiving) and it turned out perfectly.

12.4.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/232005/cranberry-sour-cream-kuchen/ ... Since fullfat butter & had plain yogurt to use up, I subbed the 1 1/4c sour cream for all but 1/3c that plain yogurt; the third was fullfat sour cream.   'Still very good.  Instead of the topping listed here, I just sprinkled some wide red sugar stripes before baking.   Kinda pretty.   I used a 9x13; baked in 35 minutes.   I can't imagine this being a good cake to remove from the pan as it's soft, delicate, light.   Flavor is good & not too sweet. Note4Me:  Not worth making again

This was awesome! Made it for some friends and they devoured it. It was very moist and flavorful.  I did substitute pecans for the almonds.

Baked in a 9x13 pan for about 40 minutes. More labor-intensive than I expected, since 1) cranberries are hard to chop without a really good food processor and 2) the batter is quite tough. I will probably make again, but with more cranberries and maybe less baking time, hoping to maximize moisture. Actually tastes better without the brown sugar topping IMO.

I made this exactly as directed.  It was very good while warm, but left a little to be desired after it got cold.  I'd probably make this again for a breakfast coffee cake.

Made as written and it was delicious. Nice blend of sweet and tart with a creamy coffeecake texture. I might take the nuts out of the topping next time because I don't think they added much, but that's just personal preference.

I saw this and thought it would be perfect for Christmas morning.  I was well into making it when I pulled out the sour cream and it was growing things.  I substituted 6 oz. of cream cheese and 4 oz. of milk.  It worked out beautifully.  Next time, I'll use a larger pan or a bundt pan.
