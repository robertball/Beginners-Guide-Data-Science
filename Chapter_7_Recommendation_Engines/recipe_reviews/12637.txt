This pie turned out to be absolutely phenomenal. However, there were many steps in which things could go wrong. Be sure the milk is boiled and the heat is reduced so the eggs don't cook in the pan. Melt the white chocolate just prior to adding it so the it does not burn. 
In our experience baking it, there was sufficient filling from the given recipe to make two 9 inch pies. Definitely allow the pie at least three hours to chill before eating it, or else the filling will collapse since its consistency is still that of pudding. Allowing it to sit also enhances the banana taste instead of the pure sugary and chocolatey sweetness that prevailed in the beginning. 
Overall, there were many nuances while making the pie (which we made with a graham cracker crust), but our efforts were well rewarded by a delectable pie.

The filling is delicious but think it might be better with a graham cracker crust.

Great recipe but I've modified. Only used 4 tlb. of sugar, added 1- 3.5 oz. instant vanilla pudding mix and only "half" the amount of whipping cream into mixture and refrigerated . Right before serving, I whip the other "half" of whipping cream and just prior to forming stiff peaks, I added about 1/4 cup of Kahlua!!!!  Then sprinkled top with Cocoa.
