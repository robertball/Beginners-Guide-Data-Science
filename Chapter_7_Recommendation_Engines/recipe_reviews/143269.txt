Delicious and just what I was craving! No espresso, so I used about 3 teaspoons instant coffee and increased milk to 1 cup.  I drizzled Hershey's syrup on top.  I think next time I will try it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream in the blender because it seperates quickly.

This frozen latte was good, but I liked the Brown Sugar/Caramel Latte from 
this site better.

The best recipe on the site for a frozen coffee, right amounts of ingredients for a good consistency! Fantastic without the whipped cream as well :D

Edit: I double the recipe and its enough for two large mugs of this deliciousness :D I use about 8 ice cubes, could probably add a few more but dont want to risk it getting watered down, and I use 1C of milk. I dont blend the milk, I just pour it in the blender after the ice is done, this cuts down on that big "foam" that turns up at the end!

I came up with this recipe on my own a while back and I LOVE it!  Just like a carmel frappucino from Starbucks.

In a pinch, I use instant coffee granules instead of the espresso, and it's still really good!

I brewed a fresh pot of rregular coffee, strong just how I like it. Added that to the mixer, then my milk so I can tell if it is enough by the color. Next the caramel sauce and sugar. And A LOT of ice cubes. I really just tweaked this recipes but all and all a fantastic Summer drink =)!

I made fresh whipped cream: 1 cup whipping cream, 1 tsp almond extract, 1 tbsp confectioners sugar. Whip until stiff peaks form, adding sugar and extract just before peaks. Phenomenal. Served it to high schoolers who love Starbucks and they raved. I also don't have an espresso machine so I just made really strong coffee.

Yummy! Cool and tasty. For a deeper coffee flavor, I freeze my espresso/coffee in ice trays and use that instead of ice, and for richer taste sub part half & half for milk.

This recipe is such a money saver!  I will no longer buy my frozen lattes from the local bakery, these are so much better.
I do not have an espresso machine so, I followed the advice of previous members and used 3t of coffee granules-that's the only substitution I made.

Made as directed.  Felt it had too much milk, too much ice, too little espresso and too little caramel for my taste.  Great base recipe, though, and one I'll certainly play around with.  Thank you!

If I could give this 10 stars I would.  I tried this about a week ago and I think I've had one everyday since! And I'm not a big iced coffee fan.  Can't wait to try an adult version one evening with maybe Bailey's or Kahlua.

Not bad at all. I literally just made this, and am quite enjoying this as I type. Really the only thing I would change is adding the milk after the ice has been blended so it doesn't get quite as frothy, but otherwise really tasty.

I am trying out "frozen" coffees this week. I thought this tasted okay. I followed the recipe exactly except I used a strong brewed coffee for the espresso. My drink separated between a ground ice and semi sweet coffee liquid, so it made the texture kind of off. It seems there is a little too much ice in the recipe and I think it needed some vanilla or vanilla syrup to for more flavor. I believe the coffee shops use the flavored syrups making theirs extra sweet and also use half and half to which gives them a smoother texture. Although, I prefer a lighter one anyway. I did double the recipe and using 11 oz cups could easily get 3 servings that size with a little left over.

I wanted something different than my usual frozen coffee drink so decided to try this. It was disappointing; not at all like the Starbuck's drink. I didn't have regular milk so used almondmilk instead and strong brewed coffee. Part of the problem is the consistancy. It is thin; there is too much fluid for the amount of ice. My usual frozen coffee drink has only 6 oz. of fluid with 1 1/2 cups of ice. I will try this again with regular milk but will use only 1/4 c. of it.

This was good, but a bit strong. Next time I'll try 2oz of espresso.  I think I'll add a bit more caramel sauce too.

Very Good! I'm a huge fan of Frapaccino's and I'm always experimenting. This recipe was very close in taste to the coffee shop. Added a lot of ice though... 12-15 large cubes. The ice didn't water it down at all and I got 2 drinks out of it. Also next time I will put 2T caramel and 1T sugar because I like a stronger caramel taste. I used starbucks caramel flavor syrup. I'll be making it all the time, I'm sure!!

This is a good recipe as written but to make it a great recipe, the milk, IMO needed to be decreased.

Yummy recipe. I used coffee ice cubes instead of ice and espresso. Just 1 T sugar was plenty for me. I thought the milk and caramel amounts were fine, but I added more caramel on top.

A nice coffee house type flavored coffee without having to leave my home!  I didn't have espresso, so I used an entire Starbuck's Via Italian Roast Instant pack in 3 oz. of water. I also used stevia and a rounded cup of ice cubes. An enjoyable way to start my day.

This was literally amazing. Instead of sugar I used two stevia packets and only 1/2 cup of vanilla almond milk. I'm so glad I tried this, it's my new favorite.

This was delicious. Like other reviews I used strong, already brewed coffee in place of the espresso. Great flavor and quick to make!
