the  title says " spicy", but we found it rather bland.. not sure if the recipe is missing something. we added 1 Tbs of Liquid Smoke, which really brought out the papaya flavor and added the rest of the papaya. we also used country ribs, which cooked faster than the 1 1/2 hrs. my son was not impressed but my husbamd ans I enjoyed it, but not sure I would make it again
