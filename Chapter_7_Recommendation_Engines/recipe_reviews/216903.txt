LOVE this cake!  My son volunteered me to make a couple of cakes for his school's cake walk fundraiser and I decided to give this one a test before making it for the school.  It was by far one of the easiest cakes I have ever made and it is delicious!  The only draw back (if you consider it one) is that once I put it on the table for the family to try it was gone in less than five minutes.  It was a huge hit and my husband is having me take one up to his work today for him and his co-workers.  I am sure it will be a big hit at the cake walk and has become a family favorite!

I hate giving negative reviews but I feel like I have to on this one.  I am a professional cake designer so I know my way around cake.  This cake had a strange texture and was very heavy but not in a good way!  The chocolate flavor was very lacking.  My two year old wouldn't even eat this cake.  I will stick with my own chocolate pound cake recipe.  Sorry!

Excellent recipe!  My first successful Bundt cake. The author is not kidding about greasing the fluted pan liberally. I used shortening and flour, make sure to get in all the creases.  I ended up using buttermilk because I had precisely one cup left.  I also used BAKERS squares as I did not have powdered cocoa. Both easy conversions to the original recipe simply by reducing the butter a bit.  (3 Tb in my case). It is also true that the cake does not need frosting.  I simply drizzled the 'Chocolate Glaze I' on top for fun.  Yummy cake!  Thanks for posting!

This cake is moist and delicious! I added coconut and pecans to the batter then frosted it with a German Chocolate cake frosting also on this site and it was wonderful, however this cake really needs no frosting.  A dusting of powdered sugar for looks will do.

I am sorry, but I didn't like this cake at all. It had really unappealing consistency and flavor.

I wasn't a big fan of this recipe (sorry!).  The chocolate flavour is definitely weak and it wasn't as moist as other pound cakes I've made.  I followed it as written.

Kind of tell short of my expectations. Weird texture. Super dense. Kind of dry. Not chocolatey enough. Don't think I will make this one again. ??

Delicious! I did use butter instead though,  since margarine is not allowed in my house, and I also added a wee bit of almond extract along with the vanilla.  Having read the reviews first, I decided to increase the cocoa powder and decrease the flour. This is  dense pound cake, as it should be....but so very moist! My husband and I both love it!  Thank you for the recipe

Made this today, it is good but need more chocolaty flavor, and little bit more moist, will try adding a pudding mix or melted chocolate into the batter next time.

Very good! My first pound cake and rather than a bunt cake I used it to make a layer cake and it worked beautifully.

While I agree with some of the others that the chocolate flavour was a little on the weaker side, it worked for what I was doing because I was using other heavy chocolate flavours so it was better that the cake itself was mild.

I may mod the recipe the next time I use it just to make it a little more chocolate-y and give it a bit more moistness, but the cake worked perfectly as a layer cake and everyone loved it!
