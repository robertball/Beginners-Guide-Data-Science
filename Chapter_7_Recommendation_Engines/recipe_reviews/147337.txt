This is almost identical to the "spamwitches" my grandpa & grandma used to make! The only thing different was grandpa liked Tabasco in his and they didn't use relish. I will be trying your recipie soon!

I made a cuban sandwich out of it. I used fresh baked bread, spam slices, swiss cheese, pickle slices, mayo w/ roasted garlic or sour OJ (oj w/ a touch of lime juice), butter both sides of sandwich and toast in either a sandwich taster or frying pan. put something heavy on sandwich to flatten it & well toasted. its great tasting

I've been a Spam lover since I was a child, so I'm always looking for something new to do with it.  I sliced and browned the Spam before I cubed it because I thought that would enhance it's flavor.  I was surprised that the rolls crisped because I thought they'd get soggy.  That was a plus.  On the other hand, I'd say the sandwiches were only so-so.  If I made them again I'd leave the browned Spam slices intact and use less cheese.  I thought the cheese and relish flavor overwhelmed the flavor of the Spam.

I wasn't surprised that this was so tasty, since I like all of the ingredients. However, I used dill relish (no sweet on hand) and served on homemade pickle bread, which enhanced the dill flavor. I plan to make it again as soon as I get sweet relish. It's easy, fast & satisfying. I served it with collard greens & Fritos - a real "quickie" dinner. (can you believe my parrot likes Spam?!?!)

Not bad! Tweaked the prep a bit - sliced the Spam thin and pan fried it to give it a nice crust, spooned it on soft onion rolls.

These are surprisingly good. I used homemade rolls for them, and they came out quite tasty. Kids liked them, and they're picky.
