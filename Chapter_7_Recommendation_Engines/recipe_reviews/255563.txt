I made these!! I used peanut butter instead of butter and coconut oil instead of shortening and I added our all-time favorite chocolate chips. I also used flaxseed instead of egg. And when I took a bite I realized I forgot to add the oatmeal. I’m sure it would of tasted even better. They were still delicious and there was an even flavor of the butternut squash and peanut butter. I also cut the sugar in half. We are cutting fat and sugar intake.

Since I didn’t know how large of a squash to use, I don’t know if they are exactly how the author intended. Next time I don’t think I’d refrigerate since they stayed in the same ball-shape as my cookie scoop when they baked. The taste is fine.  It’s a soft cookie and my family would refer to them as bread-like.
