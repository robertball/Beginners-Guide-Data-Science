I wanted to add some additional information about my recipe: This easter I had a diabetic aunt come for dinner so I substituted all of the sugar in the recipe with Splenda. It turned out perfectly. I was afraid that it might need the sugar for consistency/thickness but it was great with the Splenda. I'll be making it this way from now on.

I Love this!  My Mom makes this and I have made a few changes.  I prefer day old bread, like a sourdough, or country white.  Not wonder bread...too gummy.  I use the whole rings of pineapple and cut in 1/4's. It adds a different dimention if 1/4 cup or less...to taste, of citrus zest is used.  Orange is fantastic, but I like Lime or lemon best. Do not skimp on the Butter!  This is sooo yummy!

This dish is amazing, if your even thinking of trying it you should just do it. I use it as a dessert, Vanilla ice cream with it when its fresh from the oven is the best!! I don't mess with the eggs, I just wisk them in with the milk (half n half is even better), and I add vanilla... You won't regret it!!

I have been making this recipe for years, except I have not separated my eggs.  (Will try that!)  This is a staple on my Thanksgiving table, as well.  It's like a pineapple bread pudding.  It's wonderful!

A sweet and delicious side dish that I serve along with ham. Not nutrious at all, but that doesn't stop people going back for seconds! Yum, yum.

Wonderful recipe. I added 1 cup coconut and 1 cup chopped pecans. Got alot of compliments.   Very light and not too sweet. Definitely a keeper.

I made this for the first time today for Easter dinner. As I got to step three, I was confused about adding the sugar as I had added all the sugar during step 2. My sons girlfriend helped me to figure out that I was probably supposed to add a small amount of sugar. Hence "Gradually add sugar, continuing to beat until stiff peaks form." I decided to persevere. It took a long time whip up to stiff peak stage. It had a texture like a meringue. I used my kitchenaid stand mixer. 

Then I  combined the yolks, butter & milk which didn't incorporate smoothly probably for lack of sugar. I added pineapple and bread (used Country White as per another reviewer) and then it went together better. I also added a teaspoon of fresh lemon zest to batter. I folded in the egg white/sugar and popped it in a glass baking dish lined with parchment. It filled up the 11x7 inch pan. I was afraid that it would puff up and overflow. It did puff up a little bit but didn't overflow. Then it kinda flattened out when I took it out of the oven. The end result- it was really delicious.  Everybody loved it. There was nothing left. Scalloped Pineapple was a great accompaniment  to  Ham.

This was really delicious. I tried it Easter for family dinner as well. There wasnt any left and a couple folks asked for the recipe. For the sugar I added about a 1/4 cup with the egg white and the rest (1 1/4) cup to the butter and egg yolk part. I will be making it next year ;)

I halved this recipe, as I was making it for just me and my husband.  I ended up using two eggs and a little extra bread (maybe 2 1/4 cups) and split everything else in half.  Turned out great!

I make this for every ham dinner, holiday or not. It is so good and I always get so many compliments. I have made minor changes to make it better. I use 1 cup of sugar instead of 1-1/2. Too sweet with more. I also add a bit more pineapples I bought the 20oz can and it called for the 15 oz so I used all of it. Also used  3 cups bread and only a dash more. All of the above makes it tastier and not so sweet.  Thanks Kaylene  for a great recipe

I have made this twice and it is a big hit with my family.  I served it as a side dish, as you would with fried apples.

I made this recipe for Easter dinner for a group of 12 and was asked to make it again for another family dinner this month because of all the rave reviews!

I made this for our Easter dinner, paired with ham. It was really quite delicious. My non-adventerous (in terms of food) hubby liked it so much that he had seconds! The rest of my family and guests raved as well. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It'll be a regular on our table for Easter.
