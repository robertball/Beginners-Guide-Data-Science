After having Gingerbread pancakes at a national chain breakfast house, I simply HAD to find the recipe online.  I made this recipe with no changes and my husband and children ate every one of them.  My husband even commented that he liked this recipe better than the restaurant's!  This is one we will be making over and over.

Very good! I completely cut out the butter and used half the brown sugar and it was excellent. Even my sister liked it and she made it exactly the way the recipe called for so I know she didn't even miss the butter or extra sugar. I made the batter the night before so the seasonings had time to meld togther. I froze the leftovers and reheated in the toaster and it was even better. Plus the extra crispiness from the toasted helped the pancakes from being to soggy. The mixture of seasonings is wonderful. Thanks for posting this recipe.

Too much butter and too much sugar!  This might have made a good "dessert gingerbread".  You really get overload when you put butter and syrup on like you do with regular pancakes!  The spice combination is nice, though.

a bit crumbly...but very tasty.  I added less coffee and subbed in molasses.  Very fun twist on pancakes..

Let me start off by saying this smells sooo good and taste pretty good too, however the batter was so thick and hard to work with that I decided the forget the pancakes and make so really good muffins.

These pancakes were ok, but just ok, as far as my family was concerned.  For us, I don't think it was a matter of the recipe so much as just a matter of taste.  These were too fluffy for my family, more like cake.

I had gingerbread pancakes in a restaurant in Texas and have wanted them ever since. Finally did it and sad I waited so long. Delicious and easy. I had all the ingredients in my kitchen. Thatâ€™s a miracle. Thanks for sharing.

I reduced butter and halved the dry ingredients while keeping the wet ingredients the same. Then was able to add as much of the wet ingredients as I wanted for a consistency I like. Pancakes were awesome and the leftovers in the toaster oven 1/2 week later with my coffee were Devine. Yummy.

Very nice flavor!  Not too strong...I was worried that gingerbread pancakes would have too overwhelming a taste to eat more than half a pancake, but these were very pleasant.  My family devoured them, and requested that I make them again!

Flavor was OK but not something I would call gingerbread, more like spice cake. It was definitely more like muffin mix than pancake batter, was WAY too thick. Too sweet, too cakey.

These were alright.  I would suggest you try them out but I will keep searching.  I found them to be a little dry, despite the entire stick of butter.  I didn't over cook them either.  My 8 year old requested more gingerbread flavor.
