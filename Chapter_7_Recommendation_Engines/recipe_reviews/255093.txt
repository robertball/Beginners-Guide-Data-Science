After School Kitty Cat Sandwiches Haiku: "I'll rate this meow. Based on what my daughters left. (And I ate their scraps.)" Unusual combination of toppings went onto this open-faced sandwich, the only one of which I didn't have was a sunflower seed "nose." Eldest kiddo ate all of the ingredients off and didn't want cold cream cheese on cold bread. Youngest ate everything other than the carrots and the pineapple. Based on the plate remains and how they tasted to me, along with what they didn't want to eat, and factoring in cute points, we'll go with a 3. Playing around with ingredients might make it a more successful feline-shaped sammie for us. I'm thinking a peanut butter cat with banana eyes, raisin facial features and pretzel whisker.

Our little ones like turkey so instead of the cream cheese, I coated each round bread circle with the favorite turkey sandwich condiment of each child (some like mustard, some like mayo, etc), topped with a round slice of turkey, used grapes cut in half for eyes and made a little indentation in the grape to hold a blueberry to look more like real eyes. Nose was also a blueberry. Mouth was a semicircle of strawberry, and whiskers were sliced cheddar cheese cut into matchsticks. Took about 3minutes to do a sandwich...fast, fun healthy lunch idea!
