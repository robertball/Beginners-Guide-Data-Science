I absolutely LOVE this salad! It is delish!!! I always get compliments on it when I serve it! I never liked Waldorf-type salads until I made this! This is the best! You can go ahead and throw out the other apple salad recipes that you have!

I laughed when I first read through the ingredients for this recipe, they seemed so....nutty! Then I began to think I'd like to try the recipe out to see what on earth it turned out like, it seemed more like dessert than something to go with a main. I'm glad I did try it out, it was delicious. My partner who was as skeptical as me also really enjoyed it. The only thing I changed about the recipe was to leave out the marshmallows. That was a step too far for me!

This is the best. The first time I made, I only halved the recipe because I didn't think my family would like it. Are you kidding, they devoured it. Now I will have to double the recipe. It is the best! Thanks for sharing

You have to like peanut butter to like this.  I LOVE peanut butter!  Loved this apple salad.  This was exactly the recipe I was looking for.  I only made ONE SUBSTITUTION:  Instead of 2 cups of celery, I only did (1 cup of celery) and incraesed the apples by an extra cup (making 3 cups apples).  Loved it!  I like celery, but just not quite that much celery.

Absolutely perfect!  Easy with a great taste and I don't even like peanut butter.  Made a second time and didn't use the nuts or the evap milk - still a great recipe!

Really good. I did not use the marshmallows. I prefer this to the mayonnaise type waldorf salads.

No one in my family ate more than one taste of this salad (myself included).  We ended up throwing it away and making something else at the last minute.  It tasted like a weird combination of peanut butter and assorted friuts/vegetables

I liked the combination of ingredients, I didn't like the juicy dressing it had over it (that was the only complaint I had from my kids).  I would leave out the milk next time and add more mayo.

This is a wonderful salad, I skipped the marshmallows, but everything else is as the recipe states, just wonderfully different.

LOVE LOVE LOVE!!  Wasn't sure about PB and mayo, but it was delicious!!!  I used chopped almonds instead of mixed nuts, but you could use any nuts that you have on hand.  It's good without the celery too, but I will put that in next time for extra crunch.

I usually don't like Waldorf salads but the peanut butter in the dressing really made the difference. This will be my Waldorf salad of choice from now on. Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe is awesome and a fall favorite in our home. It turns out darker than what it is in the picture but it is still a pretty salad as well. Enjoy!
