I made this tonight for the first time and really enjoyed it. I added about 1/2 cup of diced red onion, one large clove of garlic, finely minced and about 1/2 tsp. dried marjoram with the quinoa and vegetable broth.  I added the chopped broccoli during the last 5-7 minutes of the cooking so it didn't overcook.  I had some raw, cheddar curds that I grated and added at the end.  Be sure to thoroughly rinse your quinoa before cooking to eliminate the bitterness.  Looking forward to leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

I have been trying quinoa recipes and this is the best so far.  You do have to cook it a little longer and maybe add more liquid but this is very good.

Wow, this was so simple and yet so good.  My husband who is not the biggest quinoa fan I know said I could "make this as a side any time."  Don't forget to rinse the quinoa first to remove the bitterness.  I also had to cook the quinoa a bit longer, and took the advice of some other reviewers and added the broccoli after 10 minutes of cooking.  Also just added a tiny pinch of salt because I used a vegetable bouillon cube with water as a substitute for prepared vegetable broth.  Definitely will be making this one again and again!

As written this was a little bland - but I thought it was an excellent base to add our favorite spices. I started by saut√©ing an onion and about a tbsp of minced garlic in olive oil. Then I added the quinoa, broccoli and broth as directed (I used frozen broccoli). I served it with red pepper flakes, which was great, but next time I'll probably throw some cayenne in when I add the broth.

I added onion and garlic powder with the quinoa. Like altbarber I added the broccoli later. Used chicken  instead of vegetable because that's what I had and added guyere sp? Cheese along with the cheddar. Wow. Oh and I doubled the recipe. Everybody loved it!!

Very simple and it has good flavor.   For a twist, I put mixture in casserole dish and crumbled bacon and a more cheese on top and cooked for another 15 minutes.  Very tasty!

This is a great kid friendly quinoa recipe!  We have made it several times and love it.  One of my kids doesn't like broccoli but he loves this.  It is a great quick meal with healthy ingredients.  The only change I made was to use chicken broth instead of vegetable and I don't add any extra salt.  I double the recipe for my family of 6 for the main dish.

It's simple math.
Quinoa = delicious.
Broccoli + cheese = delicious.
All 3 combined = extra delicious.
This was my first time cooking Quinoa on my own, and I'm very happy with the results! You can add whatever extra spices you like, I think this recipe is very versatile.

This was a great recipe. I added onions to mine. I used frozen broccoli and added the broccoli during the last 10 minutes of cooking. Other than that I followed the recipe and my kids LOVED it!

Oh man! So good!! I am not a big fan of quinoa (the texture weirds me out) but I'm pregnant and they say quinoa is one of the best foods to eat. This was so delicious!! I added a little cayenne and used chicken broth. Yum

The recipe is easy and a good base to start from. However, I found it really needed to be perked up a little bit. I ended up adding some Penzey's lemon pepper seasoning (salt, pepper, lemon zest, garlic, etc.) and a tiny touch of dijon mustard. That gave it a little more tang while still letting the broccoli and cheese flavors come through.

Prepared this for my pregnant daughter, knowing that the protein in quinoa is a complete protein!  I included some green pepper and chopped onions as well.  It was well received!  Next time I may use a bit more cheese, and when i make it for myself, hot peppers! 
Make sure to serve it hot, as the melted cheese is both attractive and enjoyable.

I sauteed some garlic and onion in butter before adding the quinoa and broth. I cooked for 10 minutes, then added the broccoli and cooked for remaining 10 minutes. I loved it! What a great alternative with more protein and nutrition than my usual broccoli cheese and rice casserole. I will make this often. Next time I will use less stock and dilute with water, as I felt it was a little salty for my taste.

this is awesome. I love quinoa but have trouble finding really good recipes other than my standard pesto quinoa that I found on this site. This one is now my #2 go to. So easy and quick! I cut down on the cheese - it's quite a lot.

I made it a meal by adding ground turkey. This will be in regular rotation. I think it needs a bit more seasoning, but overall, it's good.

I made it, but added some chopped onions (cooked in a little olive oil first), and rotisserie chicken that I chopped.  I had not eaten quinoa before!  It was spectacular!  I will make it again, and maybe add some mushrooms?  I also used (store-bought) chicken broth instead of veg stock. Great recipe!

Love it.  I just added fresh garlic. I'll be making it as a regular side and maybe add chicken or shrimp for a main fish. Easy and fast too.

Easy to make and delicious.  I substituted chicken broth for vegetable broth and it was very tasty.  Had to add a half cup of water because the 1 3/4 cups of broth called for in the recipe evaporated way too quickly.  Quick, easy, yummy and healthy!

I made this last night & it's honestly the best quinoa I've ever had (& for the first time my husbands comments weren't its missing something, as is with the other quinoa recipes I've tried) Only complaint was there wasn't enough of it. Definitely is going to be a regular side dish at my house!

Very good! Even my picky eaters enjoyed it. I made a few changes to this recipe. I used 1/2 cup red & 1/2 cup white quinoa with 2 cups of broth because the red quinoa seems to take longer to cook. I also shredded a little too much cheese by mistake so we just sprinkled the extra on top right before serving. Will definitely make again!

I made this recipe exactly as directed - sooo cheesy good - the quinoa maintains a slight crunch and the broccoli is such a fresh addition.  Love it....my new 'go to' quinoa recipe.

I made this the other day with a couple alterations and it was great! I did not measure the broccoli and used low-sodium chicken broth instead of vegetable. My wife even liked it and she doesn't eat quinoa!

This is a really nice side dish and so easy to  make.  Both my husband (who knows nothing about quinoa) and I enjoyed it very much.  I did not make any changes to the recipe.  I used multicolored quinoa from Trader Joe's because that's what I had on hand.  I served it with broiled fish.  It was delish!  Definitely a keeper.

Loved how easy and yummy it is! My kids, 6 and 3 loved it too. Both of them said it was delicious. :-) I did use chicken broth and gouda goat cheese, but only because that's what I had on hand

The best way to serve Quinoa to my family! I have lots of favorite quinoa recipes but this one my family actually enjoys (except for the one who refuses to eat anything naturally green). My son devours bowls of this stuff. I often double the recipe and freeze the leftovers.

very easy and good.  A new take on broccoli, rice and cheese casserole. I added a bit of cauliflower as i was a bit short on broccoli.  Can easily be changed up to suit your taste or what you have on hand.

My new favorite side dish. Hubby and son loved it too!! I used water instead of vegetable broth (only because I didn't have any) and added a couple dashes of hot sauce. I always add hot sauce to anything cheesy to bring out the flavour.

This turned out great. I make it often now. I usually add more cheese than called for, and sometimes I throw in some cooked chicken, too. It also microwaves well, so it's great to bring in lunches, etc.

I made this again because it lacked flavor. Please make sure to clean, rinse, drain and toast quinoa BEFORE starting. It makes a heck of the difference in the taste! After toasting I removed from the skillet added a little olive oil then some type of aromatics like onions, garlic and or shallots (I read the reviews and they were spot on). Knocks the dish up soooo many notches! I also added a pinch of red pepper flakes, garlic & onion powders to the dish. It was really a home run AFTER this! Thank you for laying the blueprint for me to run off with this amazing recipe! My new fav!

made this as written except used chicken broth as I didn't have veggie broth.  used fresh broccoli.  it was pretty good,  was doing a trial run before making it for a relative who doesn't eat meat.  will make again for her with the veggie broth. think I might add some spice next time as well, garlic/herbs.

Tasty, but next time I'll add the broccoli later (it kind of disintegrated) and use more cheese.  Might be nice with some green onions...

I added onion and used chicken broth.  I also used a can of shredded chicken.  It was very good once I added some more spices such as garlic powder, more pepper and more salt (I didn't salt it much at first because of use of the canned chicken and broth as I didn't want it too salty).

Tasty, and a good side dish!  In place of the quinoa, I used a Seeds of Change mix (quinoa, brown and red rice).  First I simmered the chopped broccoli in a skillet with a half cup of chicken broth until the liquid cooked away, then added another quarter cup of broth along with the quinoa mix, heated through for about 2 minutes, then added the cheese and covered until it melted.

I saut√©ed some onions, garlic, celery, shredded carrots, etc.,  with the broccoli, whatever you like first, then added the quinoa and broth when it was half -cooked.  Added the cheese at the end, then some on top when it was in the serving bowl. Loved it and so did my company!

What a tasty simple recipe! I doubled the broccoli (4 cups) and used 3 cups of water + 1 veggie bouillon cube.  It wasn‚Äôt too much broccoli for me - flavor & texture was great! Also I used Daiya vegan cheddar cheese instead - about 1/2 cup. Tastes awesome and super healthy!

I followed the directions, next time I will add a little more seasoning like garlic and maybe a little red pepper flake for a kick. Will most definitely make this again!

Loved this! My husband just had his 3rd serving as I write this review. I did use chicken broth because that's all I had. So good !! This will be on regular rotation!

I am making this for the second time. Both times I didn't have vegetable broth so I used chicken broth. My kids love it and request that I make it again!

Love this recipe and my kids do too! Would give 5 stars but I agree with other reviewers that it needs more chicken broth, I use 2 cups. I also add a bit more broccoli too, about 1/4 cup more, and add the broccoli after I turn the quinoa down to simmer. Thanks!!

So easy and yummy!  I made it in a rice cooker and it turned out perfectly!  Just make sure you have two parts broth to one part quinoa (I added a little more liquid).  I also added onion, cauliflower, and zucchini this time, to mix things up.

Quick, easy and tasty. Someone else had mentioned baking this with bacon, so I tried that. I also used a bit of peppery goat cheese mixed in with the cheddar, and added some chopped up garlic too. I also added the broccoli to the quinoa toward the end while still on the stove. I didn't add any salt, but did add a little pepper at the end.

I followed the recipe exactly -- it was very quick and easy.  This is the first time I've eaten Quinoa, so wasn't sure what to expect.  It was good, but a little bland for my taste.  Next time I'll use different seasonings and chicken broth in place of the vegetable broth.

This was tasty without the cheese, we added  on our  individual portions  as some of us were dieting. (A good low fat side dish w/out the cheese).   I used 2 cups chicken broth,
 and added about 1/4 cup finely chopped vadilla onion, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper,  1/4 tsp ground cilantro and a dash of black pepper.  It did need a little extra cooking  time for quinoa to cook fully, another  10 minutes or so. Will definitely make this one again.

I made this tonight and it is all I can do not to eat the entire batch!!  Changed it a little - cooked the quinoa with some chicken broth - steamed the broccoli - browned some onions and garlic in a skillet with butter and olive oil.  Added the quinoa and broccoli to the skillet.  Stirred well.  Served topped with cheddar, parmesan, and butter!!  Holy smokes!!

I made the following changes:
*steamed the broccoli separately for the picky husband
*used chicken broth because that's what I had
*added some granulated garlic and RealSalt Season Salt.

I cooked the quinoa and then topped with the broccoli and cheddar.

Definitely will make this again!

I used quinoa barley combination, tasted exactly like cheesy broccoli rice. Also saut√©ed minced garlic and onion in a little butter before adding the broth and quinoa and, like others suggested, waited to add the broccoli so it stayed whole.

This is a great basic recipe that allows for so many alterations.  I adjusted the recipe by adding 1/2 chopped onion and 3 diced cloves of garlic to the water and Quinoa.  Ten minutes into the simmering I added the roasted red peppers.  I did not have broccoli, just a medley of broccoli, cauliflower and carrots.   I steamed them and served them on the side.  The flavor was wonderful, even using mild cheddar cheese.  I can see adding some bacon to this in the future, like a Carbonara pasta or grilled/roasted chicken... definitely a keeper recipe.  BTW this was my very first use of Quinoa and will most certainly fine more ways to include this wonderful grain into my diet/recipes!  Thanks for sharing

Easy and delicious! I used chicken broth and 2% mexican blend cheese since it is what I had. A bag of frozen broccoli florets, defrosted and added about half way through worked just fine. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious. I used Chicken Broth because I had a hard time finding Vegetable Broth. Made it even better I think.

Simple and delicious. I added garlic powder and just a pinch of cayenne pepper, and it added a bit of zing. I also decided to mix red quinoa with regular, as we had both. It was wonderful, and it's safe to say this will become a staple in my house.

So delicious! The second time I made this, I used little cubes of zucchini, which was equally wonderful, and added a little garlic powder. Yummy!

Loved this recipe! I added mushrooms because I had some on hand. However I waited about 5 minutes to add my broccoli because I had the steamable bag from birds eye already cooked. Great recipe!

This was very good and super quick and easy! I paired it with the lamb chops balsamic vinegar reduction. Good combo. My 10 yr old enjoyed it, too! We'll be making this again, especially when I'm short on time.

This was a quick, easy and tasty meal. Forgot to rinse the quinoa first like I normally do, but it wasn't a problem with this recipe.

Doubled recipe and made as described (except I used 4 cups vegetable stock and added 5 serano peppers).   This IS easy to make, tastes good.  Future batches will include more vegetable stock (maybe 6 cups) and double the cheese.

Was a very easy recipe to follow and smelled so delicious that I couldn't wait to eat. This was my first time trying quinoa and I just can't get paste the texture and taste of it. I'm sure this is a really yummy recipe to those who love quinoa but for me.. it didn't work out. I really really wiiish I could love quinoa because it is definitely filling.

Quite good, but a little too cheesy. Next time I will cut the cheddar in half. But overall this is a great dish! I tried a little cajun seasoning on it too and that was amazing!

This is so easy and delicious!! the only thing i did different was to use unsalted vegetable stock to cut WAY back on the sodium. I will be making this frequently and maybe adding some more spices and vegetables next time.

I don't like the smell of cooked broccoli but I was so pleasantly surprised at how good this was.  We left the cheese off to eat it with curry, then added to cheese to use it as a side for left overs during the week.  Great both ways!!!
