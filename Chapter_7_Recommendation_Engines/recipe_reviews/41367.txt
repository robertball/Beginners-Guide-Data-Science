Absolutley fabulous!  It was light and very tasty with lots of flavour.  We had it with sole and it was the perfect sidedish.  Definitely would make this again - easy and quick!

This was wonderful. Lots of nice veggies, quick and easy. I served grilled chicken with this and it was a very good meal. I added garlic to this, but that is the only change I made.. well maybe a bit more hot sauce.

I quadrupled this recipe for a dinner party and everybody raved and took second servings. I took out the carrots and celery and replaced it with eggplant, which pairs nicely with the zucchini. Will definitely make over and over again.

Wow!  What can I say?  I was very impressed by this recipe!  I tried it to broaden my couscous horizons, and ended up loving it!  I didn't think the carrots would work with this, but they were delicious!  I used all the veggies called for, and only subbed fresh oregano for the basil (since my basil plant died...)  I used whole-wheat couscous (cooks the same as the regular, and tastes great!) and my homemade chicken broth.  (Chicken broth in a Slow Cooker, from this site).  I also used 1/2 a beautiful red onion and a clove of crushed garlic.  This was so good, I kept on going back for more.  It makes lots, but that's a good thing!  It was popular with the kids too.

Excellent. Three of us were skeptical because we had never liked couscous. And all of us were surprised at how much we liked it...and we all had at LEAST a second helping!

My hubby is not a lover of couscous but after  making it using this recipe he could not stop raving about how good it was.  With the exception of the zucchini, I followed the recipe exactly.  I also used tri-colored couscous which made for a very pretty dish.  I will certainly make this again.

I really liked this recipe.  It had a great taste and was filling enough to be a meal on it's own.  I didn't use celery though as I didn't have any, I used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic salt, and added a few more dashes of tobasco sauce.  It was really good! The cooking times are perfect! You musn't overcook the veggies! Keep them slightly crisp. *I have made this a few times since...last time I added some chick peas while the veggies were cooking. It was wonderful and made this into a completely balanced meal.  I Highly recommend!

Very nice recipe!  Finally, a good recipe for making couscous.  I like the different shapes and textures of the vegetables.  On my second attempt, I cut all my vegetables using the food processor, and it wasn't as good (it made the couscous mushy!).  You need to hand-cut the veggies as directed for best results.

This recipe was wonderful.  I used vegetable broth and added chickpeas and a touch of tarragon to make it a vegetarian main dish.  It was very tasty and very filling.  It was really easy too.  Definitely something I will be making on a regular basis.

A tremendous 5!  I actually followed the recipe pretty much exactly as written except; I used one large stalk of celery, ½ yellow pepper and ½ red pepper and I’m pretty sure that these amounted up to slightly more than the quantity in which the recipe called for.  I also used ¼ white onion and not a spoon messurement.  But it was FABULOUS!  Thank you very much…I can’t wait to make again.  And if you find this recipe, ADD IT TO YOUR BOX...because it's hard to find again.  Just typing in "couscous" doesn't always pull it up.  I was afraid I'd lost it!  VERY GOOD.

I used all the veggies listed, except the celery and made this for dinner when friends came over.  We had it with grilled tuna steaks and I thought it went very well.  Everyone raved about how good it was!

I had my doubts about this recipe, but I was pleasantly surprised! I definitely added more hot sauce and salt to adjust for my tastes, and doubled the veggies to make the recipe healthier. It's so delicious that I'm eating the leftovers for breakfast at my desk at lunch :-)

USE THIS RECIPE! TOTALLY DELICIOUS!!  I made a few modifications due to the ingredients I had/like.  Used fresh mushrooms in place of zucchini, since I had no zucchini.  Used 1 tbsp. butter with oil for flavor, 1/4 CUP onion instead of 1/4 TSP, and added some cumin, curry and garlic just because!  This was SO good and totally modifiable to your taste!  Definitly will make OFTEN!!

My husband and I love couscous, so that makes us a bit prejudiced, but this is a terrific recipe. You can use it to combine both your veggies and carbs in one dish; serve it as a light vegetarian meal; or just use it as a side dish that easy easy QUICK and very tasty.  It's become a regular for us.

Overall, very good.  Did not use carrots, celery and zucchini.  Tried using the peppers, but they gave a sweet taste which, in my opinion, did not go well with the salty broth.  So I took the peppers out too, and added mushrooms instead.  Very fast and easy to make.

I thought this was pretty good although my husband barely touched it.  Definitely needs more flavor, I think next time I will add more spices.  I really enjoyed the texture of this dish, and it is very healthy!  I will make this again with revisons.

This is a great recipe! I skipped the carrot and celery and the vegetables I used were: yellow & green squash, mushrooms, a little black olive, and onion.  I also topped the completed couscous with diced tomato (not cooked)-it gave it a great flavor!

Delicious and easy! I didn't have any zucchini so I upped the celery and carrots a bit. My peppers were a mix of yellow, red and green that I had left over in a frozen bag. I subbed dried basil and did garlic powder, not garlic salt. I used whole wheat cous cous. The only things I think that would make this better are some tomatoes (make it a little less dry) and some parmesan cheese on top. Otherwise, I liked it.

Yum!  I grated my carrots, used 1/2 each of the peppers and onion instead of measuring out the quantities. I also added 1/2 a jalapeno finely diced for a little extra spice and one minced garlic clove instead of the garlic salt. I just couldn't stop eating it!

This was terrible, we threw it out, but I think it would have been good if we had bought some good couscous.  We got ours from the bulk section, tasted old.  Will try again with fresher couscous.

This was very tasty - I used baby carrots (diced,) red/green/yellow bell pepper (diced,) zucchini, scallions and dried basil. I had to add a little more couscous and broth, as I had so many veggies - a great way to get in vegetable servings!

AWESOME RECIPE! I used whole wheat couscous and changed around some of the veggies. I omitted the peppers, added some yellow squash and mushrooms. At the end I threw in some canned peas. This was a fantastic accompaniment to Baked Salmon II from this site!

Tasty! I didn't have celery or carrots, so I used a whole orange bell pepper and a whole small onion. I also used a clove of minced garlic rather than the powder, and I cut the couscous and broth in half to up the veggie to starch ratio--the BF and I really enjoyed it that way!

A great alternative to rice or potatoes. I'll definitely make this again using whatever vegetables are on hand.

I loved this. It was very easy and I prepped the veggies in the food processor so it took hardly any time. I had to use dried basil since my store was out of fresh. It was still great but I know fresh would make it even better.

I really liked this recipe, my boyfriend however did not at all.  I am a couscous fan, so I might be a little biased.  The vegetables came out great.

this was great.  I added minced garlic with the first saute (no garlic salt later); also string beans, asparagus, and yellow squash with the next five ingredients.

A very refreshing change!  I used diff. vegetable,s but this recipe is great for that: using whatever you like.  I did zuchinni, carrots, green onion, and black olives.  It was pretty to look at & had good flavor.  Next time I will add a bit more spice to it.

I liked the flavor of this healthy vegetable/pasta dish.  Plus it is really two dishes in one. . . one less dish to prepare.  I had tiny pasta alphabet pieces to use instead of the couscous.  That made it even more appealing to my grand baby.

My husband and I enjoyed this.  My son didn't like it.  I didn't have zucchini so added more peppers.  I think the taste needs a little boost, not sure what.  But will make again.

Delicious!  Try to let it stand for about 10 minutes after cooking to let the flavors meld together.
