The first time I made this the meat was a little tough although the flavor was excellent.  I said I'd make it again using a more tender cut of beef.  BUT...I had more cube steak to use and decided to give the recipe another try.  This time not only was the flavor excellent, the meat was tender.  I did change the order of preparation, I sauteed the onions, mushrooms, parsley & worcestershire sauce first, then removed that from the skillet and browned the meat - no more - spread the mustard on top and sprinkled with more w. sauce - then added the veggies to simmer covered for the 5 minutes.  Did that make the difference?  I don't know but I'll make it this way next time too...

I liked the mustard and Worstershire together, but I also marinated the steaks first with that mixture and then cooked them.  I also added some red wine to deglaze the pan after the mushrooms.  It added a nice flavor.

These were quick and easy to cook.  I was looking for a recipe to use up mushrooms and cube steak I had on hand, and this was perfect.  The flavor of the meat was great, and it seasoned the mushrooms perfectly too.  I served egg noodles as the side that I flavored with butter and garlic salt.  I thought it went great together.

Husband & son really liked this.  I did too, but for my steak next time I'll put much less mustard.  For my taste the mustard overpowered the worcestershire sauce.  Just a personal preference. The steaks were tender. Definitely a good go-to recipe for a quick dinner.

This was a great way to use inexpensive cube steaks! I was worried when it said to simmer the steaks because there was almost no liquid, but it worked fine once I put the lid on because some liquid was produced. Very good meal with some buttered egg noodles!

The flour coating on my steaks stuck to my pan when I browned the steaks, which was a bummer, but it prolly had to dowith the fact that I used olive oil  instead of butter.  Other than that though, very good flavor and a thumbs up from my husband!

Great recipe - added a few extra spices.  Even had to use honey mustard b/c I was out of dijon. Still turned out great. My 4 yr old loved it and so did my husband.

Amazing!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and put it into a casserole dish with a beef gravy on top after browning in the skillet. Cooked it for 45 min it came out fork tender.  So tasty. I had to fight my husband off in order to keep some leftovers for the next day.

This was a hit at our house.  My husband saw the recipe pulled up on the computer and couldn't wait until supper because he was so excited that we were having Mushroom Cube Steaks.  I really liked the hint of dijon mustard flavor and always love worcestershire in beef dishes.  Based on another review, I did add a little red wine when I sauteed the onions and mushrooms.  Oh, I did used canned mushrooms as that is what I had on hand.  I'm sure it would be even better with fresh mushrooms.

These are okay, but I have tasted better cube steaks. Some of my family loved it, some hated it. I thought it was okay. Definitely improved by the mushrooms, and add salt to make it even better.

Awesome recipe for cube steaks!  I ended up using two pans because I doubled the recipe for 4 and had to use one pan for the steaks, then one for the veggies.  At the end, the veggies were added to the steaks while simmering.  I had no problem with the amount of liquid, but added some Merlot just because.  Will definitely make again.

I really liked the flavor of this cube steak.  It is something different than just doing country fried steak.  It is easy and good for a simple meal that turns out delicious.

I doubled this for four cube steaks. To make it a little more hearty, I made a beef gravy from Campbell's beef broth and some cornstarch stirred in. I sauteed the cube steaks, then the onion (I used half of a large onion, as that was what I had to use on hand), mushrooms and a little chopped fresh garlic before adding in the beef broth and once it came up to a slow boil, I poured the gravy over the cube steaks that I put into a baking dish and covered it with foil. I baked it at 350* for about an hour and they were as tender as could be. (I've cooked cube steaks before and had them come out a little tough, which wasn't at all what we were expecting.) The basic ingredients were there, I just added a few more ingredients and baked it just to make it stretch a little farther and a little more stick-to-your-ribs.

This was wonderful! The meat was fork tender and full of flavor. I added some red and green peppers to the mushrooms and extra onion. I used bacon fat instead of butter and it added alot of yummy bacon flavor. I will make this again and again!

I cooked these much longer than called for to make them tender - I cooked them covered for about 45 minutes on simmer and they were delicious!  Have already made this twice.  Love the flavor!

I really am not a fan of cube steaks, but we had a lot of them and i had to feed a bunch of hungry cowboys...they LOVED this! There was absolutely nothing left! It was fast, and easy, and although not the prettiest dish it was really tasty! Thanks!

I make this but after searing the cube steak, I add 1 can of cream of mushroom soup with 1 can of water.  Simmer with meat about 10 minutes.  This makes a great tasting gravy.

It was amazing.  I browned 2 cube steaks then put in baking dish. Sliced up some onions and added some mushrooms and sliced potatoes to the dish. Poured onion brown gravy over all and baked 1 hour at 350 degrees. Yummy my family loved it !!!!!!

This recipe was good and easy to make but I don't  think my family cares for the texture and flavor of cube steak. I also wish the recipe was a little more flavorful, I'd probably add more mustard and parsley next time.

Followed recipe and we really liked it.  The steaks were tender.  The second time I made it I cooked the onion and mushrooms in butter first, removed from pan and browned steaks on both sides, then put everything back in with mustard and worc sauce and simmered covered for 5 minutes.  Everyone really liked it both times.

I made a few changes to suit our taste buds. I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and two jars of brown gravy and let it simmer for 4 hours, I did have to add water ever now & then. It was a great meal and will make it again!!

The only way I have ever prepared cube steaks is 'Chicken Fried'. Wanted something different tonight and gave this recipe a try. HUGE hit with the family, excellent flavor. The only things I did different were to add some chopped green pepper (garden cleanup) with the onions and to deglaze the pan with a bit of red wine after browning the steaks. The steaks came out SO tender..this recipe is a keeper!

Thank you for this delicious recipe, Marie. I made it just as you directed, but I added a splash of red wine. I served it over whole wheat noodles, which we hadn't used before. The sauce was delicious.

I'd give this more than 5 stars if I could! This was a wonderful dish and a definite keeper!  Like the other readers have noted, don't skip the mustard. I've never put dijon mustard on a cube steak before and after eating this dish, I always will!  I also added some extra onions, just because I love onions and coated the meat with a little more flour.  I served this over egg noodles, with a side of asparagus with parmesean cheese sprinkled on top. Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

Excellent. One reviewer suggested to leave out the dijon mustard, but I have to vehemently disagree with that.  The combination of dijon mustard with Worchestershire sauce is GREAT.  I added a pinch of tarragon and deglazed the mushrooms with a touch of dry sherry.  I LOVE this recipe and will share it with my family next time we're all home at the same time!

We love this recipe.  I do change it up a bit.  I also deglaze with some red wine.  When I return the steaks back to the pan, I then put the whole pan in the oven at 325 and bake for about 25-30 min.  yummy

This is amazing.Going in our family recipe book. Our daughter ,who isn't crazy about much yelled out this meat was amazing and she wanted us to save her another piece. LOL All through eating she made statement about this meat being soooo good.Great with A1. It would be awesome if we could find an amazing gravy to top it with.  If I find one I will share on this review. I swerved this with creamed spinach and home made whipped potatoes.

A nice change from the typical "chicken fried steak" version of cubed steak that I have always had.  I liked the flavor of the mustard and Worcestershire sauce together.  I added some fresh broccoli to the skillet when I returned the steaks for the last 7-8 min...was a really nice addition.  My youngest daughter must have had 4 servings!  Will make this again! Thanks!

I made this for my family last night for dinner and got a "WOW", this is delicious. I was a bit concerned that the steak would be chewy, BUT i was wrong, it was tender and juicy...My family kept saying that it was the best they ever tasted... I will be making again. I used dried parsley instead of fresh and I don't think anyone cared :)
You should give this a try .

Not the recipes fault, cube steak is just not our cut of meat.  It's stringy and chewy.  The flavor was good.

Wish I could join the rave reviews.  Didn't care for the flavor at all!  Obviously thought I would as I enjoy all the ingredients.  Didn't enjoy the texture of the flour on the meat, really, didn't enjoy anything.  Husband liked it, daughter enjoyed flavor of the meat.

I prepared this steak over the weekend and it was a hit!! I have 3 young daughters and my husband to feed. Sometimes I get lazy and make the same things over and over. This recipe was a nice change and a great way to use things I cook with often. Thanks for being kind enough to share.

Very good and simple! do NOT leave out the mustard, wouldn't be the same at all and boring! Iloved it and made exactly as written. Could have "maybe" used a bit more simmering substance such as beef broth to make it even fall apart tender, but like I said, loved it as is.

I will definitely make this again. It was very tasty. I didn't have the mushrooms but I substituted sweet peppers and it was fine. Cube steaks are a little tough but perhaps w/some tenderizer could be better. Next time.

I'm sorry but it tasted like hamburger. Maybe try marinating the steaks overnight, it may give it a little more flavor. It was a lot of work for a dish that just tastes like a fried up hamburger with mushrooms and onions.

Really good recipe. Only change I would make next time is to not flour the steaks before cooking. Made a weird paste when served.  Really liked the dijon mustard and sauteed mushrooms.

Quick, inexpensive and filling, but lacked a little something to me.  I added more butter than called for because it didn't seem to be enough.  The meat did come out more tender than I expected for cubed steak, and overall was a good weeknight main dish.  I'll just play around with other seasonings next time.

Made this last night and it was very good.  Only change I made was to increase the amount of onion and add 3 cloves of garlic.  The cube steaks were very tender and flavorful.  Thanks!

the flavor of this dish is great.  It could use more seasoning on the meat before you flour it. Otherwise good taste and temder.

These were delicious!  They were very tender and full of flavor.  I think I will saute the mushrooms and onions first next time and then remove them from the pan while I brown the steaks.  Then add the veggies back on top.  I found that putting the veggies on the bottom made them a little too overcooked.  I also think I'll add a little red wine to the pan next time also.  That sounds great!!  Nice recipe, Marie!  Definitely a keeper!  My family was dead quiet while eating.  That's how I know they enjoy something because they are just shoveling it in!  hehe

This was a delicious way to prepare cube steak.  Had to double the recipe and used 1/2 cups onion and also added a can of cream  of mushroom soup to the sauted onion/mushrooms, so there would be a sauce for the noodles.  Delicious!!!

Great recipe, but we have always pounded out the cube steaks with a mallot or the edge of a plate. It tenderizes the meat and also makes for less cooking time!

This is fantastic! The only think I changed was I added some fresh garlic and red wine to deglaze the pan. Yum! I always thought I hated round steak until I used this recipe. This will definitely be added to the recipe rotation!

Good way to use cube steaks.  Simple and easy.  I didn't care for the mustard, but my hubby liked it.  Could easily omit the mustard if you wanted.

I wasn't expecting a lot from this recipe but it was really good!!  I used cubed pork (since that's what I had) and added some water a few times after the meat was added back to the pan.  Yummy, thanks so much!

The flavor was really awesome.  I added minced garlic and onions.  The only thing is that mine did not turn out tender.  Cube steak is pretty much the same so I am wondering why mine was a little tough when so many reviews said it was tender.  Otherwise a super quick and tasty recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband loved this.  I did add a little wine and water to deglaze the pan after mushrooms cooked.  The meat needed to simmer 10-12 minutes to be cooked through.  Wonderful flavor, quick cooking - will definitely make again.

Like another reviewer mentioned, I've pretty much only pan fried these before with just S&P - so this was a great, fast, & easy alternative.  Since I wanted to use it up I added some zucchini and also bell pepper in with the mushrooms.  Nice one pot meal!

This recipe is very quick and easy.  It's also very tasty.  I've made it a couple of times now.  It doesn't have a "wow" factor, which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but it is great comfort food.

I tried this recipie for 4 people tonight and I needed to add a little chicken broth to the mushrooms and onions.  My family loved it.  The steaks were tender, juicy and still a little crusty on the outside- Great recipie.

very easy to make.  I chose to skip the mustard since the worcestershire sauce added during cooking adds enough flavor.

thanks!  It's a tad better than my mom's traditional cube steak which makes it my own new tradition.

Was skeptical to be honest when trying this with the mustard "paste" but it was actually a nice twist on a typical Southern dish.... the boys loved it so I would definately make it again.  Had to substitute a can of sliced mushrooms for the fresh but it was still very tasty.

Very simple and easy recipe.  Not a lot of flair, but it makes for a quick week night meal.  I left off the mustard, because it seemed a little unusual, but doubt it changed the overall taste much.

Very quick!  Very flavorful!  This is a keeper!  My hubby loved it!  I didn't measure, so probably used more Worchestershire and I used a more onion cause thats what we like.  I also used horseradish mustard and liked that flavor, but reg dijon would have done just fine.  I made it with beefy rice and served it on top.  Excellent!  No extra sauces needed.  No leftovers.

I liked the combination of flavors, but the meat literally just fell apart in the pan.  Therefore, it just became a mess.  I even made a gravy to try and hide the horrendous results, but my husband did not care for it. He thought it was too salty and it tasted about as good as it looked.
At least my children who are 3 and 5 years in age ate it without complaining.  So that's a positive.
I am stumped on this one!

This is a great way to add a wonderful taste to regular cube steaks. This dish was very tasty.

This recipe is so easy and fun. The different flavors make it a new and exciting dinner. I served it with white rice with a little butter and some corn on the cob. My family was raving.

This was really good and really easy to make.  I put it over egg noodles and will add a little beef gravy next time, but its a great main dish without the noodles too.  Even picky DBF loved it!

This was a quick and easy recipe. I actually never cooked with cube steak before so I was looking for a recipe that my husband would love....and he did. This will be on the menu again.

I hadn't made cube steak in years so I thought I would try it. My husband loved it and said I should make it more often. Even my two boys who are picky eaters ate it.

This was the only time I've ever had tasty, tender cube steaks. I was weirded out by the idea of adding Dijon at first, but that turned out to be what made this dish. Unfortunately, I can't say that I liked the veggies as much. The mushrooms were good, but nothing remarkable. The onions were disappointing. The parsley I could take or leave. I might experiment with herbs next time I make this. Cube steaks are cheap and I'm broke, so I probably will use the steak part of this recipe again.

I was looking for a quick recipe for cube steak...this fit the bill & was very tasty! 
I didn't use flour on the steaks, like many others I used red wine to deglaze the pan.  Served with homemade hash browns & steamed veggie medley.  I'll use this recipe over & over.
Thanks for a winner!

Good recipe!  I added some red wine to the pan for the steaks to simmer in at the end (but I think I simmered too long!).  Make sure to watch the time!  :)

BF, who is the beef lover, said give this a four.  The steak was very tender, though the mustard/worcestershire was just a bit overpowering for him.  I'm not a beef eater, thought this was just ok.   I wouldn't make this again for me, but I will likely make it again for him.  Maybe I'll sub out the worcestershire/mustard for some brandy.

I did not think that Dijon mustard or Worcestershire sauce would go good together but they did!  I really enjoyed the flavor!:)  Thanks for sharing:)

This is an excellent recipe - for taste, ease, simplicity and speed!  This is definitely a repeat. The dijon mustard and worcestershire sauce enhances the mushroom and meat perfectly.

I've tried to cook cube steaks before following a different recipe, which requires their cooking for about an hour in a sauce.  They were totally overcooked and dry and the sauce didn't help at all.  This recipe is so much faster and produces a tender and wonderfully flavored steak.  Perfect for my husband and I for week nights.
