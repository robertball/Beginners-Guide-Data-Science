These were the best Christmas cookies we made this year. I made them smaller than what the recipe said. The taste was wonderful.

This was a delicious recipe but very time consuming as stated by other reviewers. I found it very difficult to roll out the dough so thin as the yeast made it very elastic.

I have made this recipe several times now. It is very time consuming but well worth it. Everyone loves these cookies! My prefernce was to use pecans instead of walnuts. Everytime I make it I end up with many more cookies than the 6 dozen this is said to make. I only let the dough in the fridge for about an hour. It got much to hard and dificult to roll when I refrigerated the dough over night. In my opinion they taste better the next day.

These are delicious but something was missing for us. I mixed up a simple icing of powdered sugar cream and vanilla and drizzled it on top perfect! Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as written. They were a big hit at Christmas and wonderful with a cup of coffee in the morning.
