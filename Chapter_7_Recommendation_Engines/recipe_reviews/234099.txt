As a self described food snob I have to admit I usually don't cook with canned soups or soup mixes but I decided to try this one since my husband is Polish.  I hate when people substitute but all I had was beer brats (no kielbasa)so I used that and am really glad I did.  It was really really good and super easy!  I will definitely make again!  My daughter came home from college with a friend and they both raved, as did my husband. ( :

This was a very good dish. Very easy. You really need a deep dish baking dish. 9x12 wasn’t deep enough. I couldn’t find the exact noodles it called for so I used bow ties pasta. Next time instead of 3 cans of water I’m going to use 2 cans of water 1 can of milk.

This was absolutely amazing!  I'm not the biggest fan of sauerkraut, but hubby loves it, so I keep trying to find dishes that we'll both like.  This one was perfect, as the noodles and mushroom soup help balance out just a bit of the tart so I can truly enjoy, but hubby still loves it as well.   Made in a 9x13 pyrex and had just enough room to stir everything up.  It was cooked perfectly after about an hour and 10 minutes, but I think the cook time is very flexible and a few minutes over or under won't make much difference as long as the noodles are still wet.  Wonderful, easy dish that will be added to the regular line-up in my household!
