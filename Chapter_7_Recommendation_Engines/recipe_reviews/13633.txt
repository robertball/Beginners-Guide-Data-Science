this was the BEST pie/cake we have ever had. I use pumpkin pie filling in place of pumpkin butter.

I think this is misnamed; it should be something like "creamy pumpkin pie with pecans" because it doesn't really look or taste like cheesecake, rather it's more pumpkin pie like in taste, looks and consistency. It doesn't taste bad at all, but when you are expecting a cheesecake and that's not what it is, it's a little off-putting, and so I couldn't appreciate the taste fully. That's why I gave it a four star rating. I bought my pumpkin butter at Trader Joe's.

I agree that perhaps the recipe is misnamed "cheesecake" but it was amazing.  Everyone who had it loved it and wanted the recipe.

personal preferences that worked:
I used 3/4 cup pecan halves (instead of 1/2 cup chopped pecans, this made it prettier but possibly harder to cut) and added a couple of tablespoons of pure maple syrup for the topping.  I also used a low-fat crust and low-fat cream cheese.

I didn't care for this. Like other reviewers mentioned, it does not have the consistency or taste of cheesecake. It tasted okay, but I won't make it again, sorry.

This is definitely more of a creamy pumpkin pie than a cheesecake, but wow!  Followed directions exactly (except used pecan halves instead of chopped) and all I can say is that it takes pumpkin pie to a whole new level and was AMAZING.  The texture was creamier and the flavor was rich (I think due to the pumpkin butter), but not too rich to where you can only eat one or two bites.

After a trial run, I made modifications: used a spring-form pan, made our own crust thicker to support the weight of the cake, 1.5x cream cheese, substituted canned pumpkin, made the pecan topping thicker.  Most popular item at last year's Thanksgiving dinner!

This recipe is delicious, but it is deceiving because it is not like a cheesecake at all, more like a creamy pie. My husband and I loved it we will definitely be having this every fall!

An exceptional recipe. I made a few changes using 1/4 pumpkin butter and 3/4 can pumpkin - adding also a few sprinkles of allspice and ground clove(which is also known to numb gums relieving pain from toothaches). 
My crust I sub'd Ginger snaps in food processor from their graham crackers which really enhances the flavor.
The flavors are rich and addictive. If you find that you have a little leftover in crumbs and filling (as I have) refrigerate and you can make little muffin pies the week after the holiday...because this is simply a treat we can't seem to get enough of. 5 stars all the way!

Made this last year for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. It was out of this world!! I've already had several people ask me if I'm making it again this year. It's very simple to make and tastes fantastic!
