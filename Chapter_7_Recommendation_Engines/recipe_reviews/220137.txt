This was O.K. but nothing sets it apart from other strawberry Jello pies that I've had.   Set your timer for 10 minutes for the gelatin mixture to thicken because I checked it at 15 minutes, and it solidified...had to throw away and start over.  On the positive side, this is easy to put together.  I would have preferred a regular pie crust, but that's just a personal preference.  Sorry, this tastes pretty good but just pretty ordinary.

Being a diabetic I made a couple of changes to this recipe substituting sugar with Splenda, regular jello to sugar-free and used sugar-free Cool Whip.  This is a refreshing delightful pie.  My family loved it.  Thank you for sharing it!

Made exactly as the recipe stated.  It was very good.  I've put this recipe in the family cookbook.  I'll be making it again.  I am going to try adding cream cheese next time.  My daughter thinks it might be a good addition.  We'll see.

Simple but very good,  I will be making this again real soon, but this time I think I will make 2 pies because 1 was not enough.

I am so pleased with this pie!  I read the review where it came out like mousse...I did not have that problem.  I loved the fact that there were so many berries in the pie!  I have had the leftovers in the fridge for three days and there is no pulling away from the crust or weeping.  The only thing I changed was I used watermelon flavored gelatin (store was sold out of strawberry...go figure!).  I will definitely make this again...what a great summer pie!

I liked  the no-bake feature---the crust became soggy though & the pie served out more like strawberry mousse with graham cracker topping---tasted great even though the presentation was off!

This no bake turned out great.  Very refreshing after dinner treat.  There were 4 of us at dinner and none of pie was left 
over.

Made this after we picked strawnerries with the kids. I had too many strawberries and was looking for some fast and easy no bake recipes. This was perfect. It was so refreshing and yummy. I will be definitely making it from now on.
