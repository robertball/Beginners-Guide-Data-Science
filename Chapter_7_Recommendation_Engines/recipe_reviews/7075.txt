I don't own a bread machine, so I made mine by hand.  The first rise took only 25 mins!  If you're making by hand, mix all ingredients (proof the yeast in 1/4 cup of the water and a teaspoon of sugar), turn onto a floured surface, and knead 8-10 mins. Put into a lightly oiled bowl, turn once to coat, cover, and place in a slightly warm oven for about 25 mins. Punch down, cut/shape, then place on baking pan and cover to let rise at room temp while you preheat the oven.  Score just before placing in a 375 degree oven for about 30 mins. Mine came out plain, but I blame that on my young starter.  Fantastic!  EDIT:  The second time I made this, I wanted good dinner rolls, so I used a cup of a half-water, half-flour mixture in place of sourdough starter, and it made FABULOUS plain white dinner rolls.

It worked!  However, every starter is different and you need a bit of breadmaking experience to judge whether your starter is too acidic/sour(then it needs either flour feeding and/or soda to neutralize) or whether it is frothy or too flat (then it needs added yeast to help out) and check to see if your dough is smooth just before rising or needs a few drops more water or a few shakes more water to make a stiff dough.

Have made this bread twice and also used the dough setting to make rolls twice.  All results have been outstanding.  Many thanks for sharing.

this IS plain and simple. I don't have a bread machine and the rule of thumb I was told for sourdough is 1.5 cups of starter per loaf when not using yeast. To me the beauty of using starter is *not* needing the yeast. Also, with starter/no yeast you get a much slower fermentation and thus a better "sourdough" flavor to the bread. That said, I understand that this recipie is intended for a bread machine which pretty much makes the added yeast necessary. To make it "non machine" oriented I just eliminated the yeast, and used 1.5c starter and 1/4 c. of water to make up the same liquid content. There is only 1 recipie I found here on AR that uses no bread machine and no added yeast like I was looking for. I tried it and didn't like it...so started playing with other ones for the bread machines. I like this one the best with the changes in the starter above. This one has a good bite to it like sourdough should. The others I tried came out too sweet like plain old white bread.*made this a few more times and  tweaked it. Knead about 50 times since the bread dough machine "does it for you". Normally bread bakes in about 30 minutes. The last time I didn't hear the timer go off and it baked a lot longer. It came out NICE and crusty that way...family declared it just perfect!

I haven't had sourdough in several years and this was just the taste I was hoping for. I made rolls because I am better able to control my portions. They were crusty and sour. I'll make this again often. I had to work in about another half cup of flour while making them into rolls because the dough was so sticky. Really good!

nice, simple and quick recipe with good results - even better, no sugar, butter or oil required.  Have tried with a variety of sourdough mixtures and it works perfectly everytime.

Easy to make.  I used my sweet sourdough starter and the bread truned out great.
It was a light fluffy bread, not heavy at all.  Will make this one again!

I did this recipe with my bread machine on 'dough' and then I cut the dough into 12 equal portions and made buns out of them. The family just loves it.

All I can say is WOW!!! Best tasting sourdough bread recipe I've found online and it turns out perfect everytime! I use the dough cycle on my bread machine and when finished, I dump it on a non stick silicone baking sheet, punch out the air bubbles and form it into 80 gram balls. I slice a cross on the top, brush with water and sprinkle on some sea salt and place in my bread warmer for an hour. Pop them into the oven at 375 for 10 minutes, cool for as long as your tempted to rip 'em open, slather with butter and devour. For a nice brown color after you've baked them for 10 minutes, I open the oven door and broil them them just a little for about 1 minute. Don't walk away, just keep a close eye on it.  This is my one indulgence as I don't normally eat carbs. I take my starter out of the fridge, feed it, and wait two- three days before making bread. It gives it that nice sourdough flavor if I wait longer. My sourdough starter is: 1 pkg dry yeast in 1/2 C warm water, 2 C King Arthur unbleached white bread flour, 2 C warm water and 1 TB sugar. I feed once a week with: 1 C hot water, 1/4 c potato flakes, 1/2 C sugar, 1 C white bread flour. You really can't go wrong with this recipe. To die for!!!

This bread turned out fantastic.  The loaf was crusty on the outside and moist on the inside.  Everyone loved it.  My son said that it was the best bread that he had ever tasted.  Thanks Jennifer!

I'm at sea level and had to add nearly 1/4 cup of flour to get the dough to the right consistency, so at high altitudes I imagine even more flour would be needed.  We made the first loaf exactly to the recipe and left the dough sticky - it rose again in a bread pan and made a passable loaf.  The second time I added more flour and the loaf was really good.  We don't like breaking teeth on rock hard crust, so we rub the whole loaf with a stick of butter while it's still hot from the oven (even the sides and bottom) and keep the loaf in a covered container to keep it soft.  My husband likes a sweeter sourdough so the loaf that's in now has a couple of tablespoons of sugar in it. along with the extra flour.  To those wishing for a recipe that called for only starter and no yeast - that isn't likely for a bread machine since the rising time for starter only without granulated yeast could be 3 or 4 hours easily and the bread machine rise time is less; therefore, SOME dry yeast is always going to be called for in the bread machine recipes.  Do an internet search for "sourdough forum" and you'll come up with places that sourdough experts talk about their starters, their techniques and recipes... it's a great way to get help and ideas.

First time making sourdough bread, and it couldn't have been easier! I don't have a bread machine so I followed earlier advice: proof the yeast in 1/4 cup water, knead dough for 10 minutes on floured service, let rise in warm oven (I forgot about it and left it in the oven for 45 minutes), punch down, shape loaf, let rise for 20-30 minutes. Bake at 375 for 30 minutes. Amazing sourdough bread! My sourdough starter smells awesome though, so that certainly helped!

This could not have been any easier!  It is important to remember when one is working with a starter that a recipe is more of a guideline then set-in-stone directions.  Your starter is different from mine, which is different from the next guy's.  So it is not the recipes fault if the starter you use requires you to add more flour, or conversely, more liquid.  That being said, I added 3 cups of flour and set my bread machine on the dough cycle.  Then I punched it down, rolled it in a ball and let it rise, covered in a greased bowl for about an hour.  Then I made big, soft sourdough pretzels out of it.  Oh.  My.  Goodness!  So, so yummy.  Just totally delicious!  They were completely devoured, all 12 of them, by the 4 of us in a matter of minutes.  Great recipe, Jennifer!  Thanks :)

We loved this and used it for sandwiches with leftover Easter ham! I added a teaspoon of sugar and a tablespoon of salted butter; only used 1 teaspoon salt. I made it by hand, let it rise as a french-type loaf, slashed it and baked at 400 for about 20-25 minutes. Delicious!

My starter is new and not especially sour yet, but this recipe keeps producing consistently delicious bread. It has a medium density texture and keeps well for at least 4 days.

omgosh... this is the best and most simple sourdough roll recipe that I ever made! tysvm Jennifer! Mine, too, was a little bit sticky; but I added about 2 tablespoons of flour and it was perfect (I guess maybe it depends on the altitude and/or humidity level where one lives). I separated the dough into 8 sections, coated my palms with EVOO, and rolled each section into a slightly flattened ball then set them on a non-stick cookie sheet with about 1/2" between each roll. I warmed up my oven (then turned it off) and set them in there with a pastry cloth over them for a little over an hour until they doubled in size; then I preheated my oven to 350 F and baked them for about 15 minutes. Absolutely wonderful!!!

To develop a more sour taste, once the breadmaker has mixed the ingredients well, take the whole pan out of the machine, cover it in plastic wrap or transfer to a container to prevent moisture loss, and stick in the fridge overnight or for two days, then put it back in the breadmaker and restart the baking cycle.

It's very important that all ingredients are room temperature before starting the baking process.

According to other internet sources, sourdough is supposed to be slightly healthier than white bread due to the acids which make the taste having a stabilizing effect on blood glucose levels. Beware using wheat flour, it has different gluten levels and the yeasts may need more time to break it down. Experiment!

I have made this 5 times in the last 2 weeks, It makes a very nice loaf of bread, even as written!  I do find that I tend to play with recipes and do not like to read a review that is marked awful, when you read on about what they didn't add or added something else to it. To me, review the exact recipe!  With that said, I do play with recipes after I make the EXACT one, it is only fair to review it that way. I do like to share a tip that works very well for me, I take a rolls size pinch of the dough and store it in the refrigerator or Freezer... depending on how long between batches I am make. It stores well in the refrigerator for a week.  I add that to the next loaf of bread to boost the sour dough flavor! Try the recipe, as is, you will love it. Thanks for sharing!

This was my first time making sourdough bread and it came out pretty good. My starter is made of just flour and water (one cup of each at room temp, wait 24 hours, dump out half then add 1/2 cup each flour and water, repeat every 24 hours stirring frequently until froth/foam forms). I was very happy with how well this rose and how easy the dough was to work with. I used the dough cycle on my bread machine. When it was done, I kneaded it a few times, then shaped in an oval loaf. I covered and let rise in a warm place for about 40 minutes, then baked it at 400 degrees for about 35 minutes so it was nice and crusty. The bread did dry out pretty fast the next day, but it makes wonderful toast.

excellent!  The only sour dough recipe I've found that is successful, even if I make it in the conventional oven.  I make the dough in the machine and split the final dough in half.  The first half I split up into about eight little balls that I make into dinner rolls, and the other half I put in a GREASED loaf pan.  Rising outside the machine takes about 1 hour when it's 70 degrees and up outside, longer otherwise.  While preheating my oven, I set the dough balls and loaf inside the cold oven when I'm in a pinch for time and the rise is perfect when the temp gets to 375.  Bake for 15 minutes.  Makes AWESOME bakery style bread.

Fabulous.  I have tried some sourdough recipes off this site & this one was hands down the BEST.  Crusty, light exterior...chewy, tangy-sour inside. Works best when you have your starter at room temp.

This turned out pretty good - although I did have to add more flour. This was my first time using my starter and the bread definitely had that "sour" taste to it. I made the dough in the breadmaker and then shaped it and baked it in the oven.

WOW, this was excellent. I mixed in my bread machine with the dough setting, formed into an oblong size, put on a greased cookie sheet, let it rise until double, brushed it with egg wash and then sprinkled with dry onion flakes. I baked it at 375 for 30 minutes. It doubled in size in the oven and was amazingly good. The crust was crisp and the inside light and tender. We teamed it with a great salad and it was perfect. I am going to form this into small rolls next time or baguette size. Give it a try. It is wonderful. I substituted the white flour for all wheat flour and it was great also and healthier but still soft and fluffy on the inside.

I make this exact bread every single week, and it doesn't last longer than it takes it to cool. It works PERFECT every time, and when my family comes over, they always kindly ask if I made it. It's the closest thing to San Francisco Sourdough as I've ever had (y'know besides in SF). THANK YOU for this recipe. :)I wish I could give more stars.

I don't have a bread machine, and it came out great.  First rising for 1 hour and second rising for 40 min.  Baked @400 for 20min.  Very nice and crispy crust but soft on the inside.  I did have to add more bread flour but all starters are different.  I did add just a pinch of sugar as a catalyst, as I was using a starter that was made from grapes and does not have any processed yeast in the starter(which was also my first time w/this starter).  This is like a classic french-no oil which is nice and makes for a nice crusty loaf.  thanks, I would definitely use this recipe again.

This was my first sourdough bread experience and certainly not my last.This recipe is a "dinktum to my danktum" as we say here in the south.I did have to add 3/4 cup extra of warm water because it was too dry I thought but it turned out wonderful.Thanks

This was the first successful bread-making endeavor I've had.  I don't have a bread machine. I mixed the ingredients and kneaded into an elastic dough (required about 1/4 cup extra flour).  I let it rise 1 hour and 30 minutes then punched down and formed into 2 baguette-style loafs, let rise another hour, then baked 20 minutes at 375.  The texture was great, like something I'd buy at the local bakery.  Saving this recipe!

My question is...why do we need to add yeast when we are using a starter that is yeast? Sorry it sounds really good but I haven't tried it...need to know an answer to my question first!

I just got my starter ready and wanted to try a great sourdough recipe and found this one! It worked Great! Very pleased with the results. Used my bread machine on setting 1. Loaf was perfect and light.  I did use the suggestion of putting the yeast in warm water first, with about a teaspoon of sugar, to help the rise and it worked perfectly. Thank you!

I don't have a bread machine so I comprimised.
I added 3 tablespoons of sugar warm water and yeast mix and set aside until foaming.
Once everything else was added, I kneaded for 10 minuted, let rise until doubled, punched down, split the dough and placed into two loaf pans, let rise again until doubled, then baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  I used the Amish Friendship Sourdough starter, and it came out tasting more like a sour Chalah bread!  A very sweet, with a hint of sourdough, bread!!

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe...although I shouldn't be eating all this delicious bread!  I have been using this recipe with my Sourdough Starter for a couple of months now.  I make my bread with the help of a KitchenAid so I took "breadguy's" advice along with Kris(py)'s instructions for making by hand.  Together we have created an awesome, easy bread which I make every weekend for the week ahead!  After a time or two one really does make the recipe fit the circumstances but so far, no fail!

the first time I made it I peeked in and saw the dough was very wet so I added flour to it.. was way too heavy. I made it again following the recipe exactly and it is by far the very best bread I have ever made!!

This recipe is outstanding!  It is definitely getting added to the recipe book.  I had tried "San Francisco Sourdough" from this site, but didn't like the texture -- it didn't seem like a true sourdough to me.  I don't have a bread machine, so I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and proofed my yeast in my stand mixer bowl with a pinch of sugar and 1/4 cup warm water.  I then added all of the ingredients (adding more flour as needed) and mixed on low with my dough-hook until I had a nice non-sticky texture.  I then "kneaded" it on speed 4 for a couple of minutes.  I let it rise for about an hour and then made a dozen rolls.  I let the rolls rise for about a half hour until I cooked them at 375 for 15 minutes.  One thing I did that no one else has mentioned is spray the rolls with water throughout the baking process.  Since I cooked the rolls for 15 minutes, I spritzed them every five minutes or so -- that's how you get that nice chewy crust.  I can't wait to make these again as my starter keeps maturing.  Huge thumbs-up!

Very good and mine wasn't a strong sourdourgh flavor, but still good! I love baking homemade fresh bread.  Mine set out for about 3 days, but still feeding my starter and hopefully the next baking, the bread will have a stronger flavor.  So simple and only uses a handful of ingredients!

I have made this recipe daily for the last 4 weeks and its awesome!  Comes out perfect.  I started my sourdough starter from a starter culture packet and it must be getting better and better because it comes out chewy on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  I make it in the bread machine.  I had been making my bread in the overn but it comes out so much better from the bread machine and this recipe.

This bread came out almost perfect. It was a little dense and didn't rise as much as I expected. However, it tasted great and was perfect for sandwiches. For the second loaf I tried adding the yeast to the water and letting it set for 10 minutes before adding the other ingredients. I also added 1 tablespoon of sugar to the water/yeast mixture. This time I was afraid it was going to rise too high but it turned out to be a perfect loaf of bread. With just a slight tweak this is a perfect sourdough recipe.

These were delicious.  I used the dough cycle on the bread machine and then punched it down and turned into a greased bowl.  I let it rest 15 minutes and then shaped into 8 smallish rolls and 1 boule. Very tasty bread using my first amount of starter from the Sourdough Starter recipe on here.  I will keep making these for a long time. I haven't bought bread in about a month, using my recipes from here and the bread machine.  I like that you control the ingredients and get to eat these right out of the oven!  Thank you Jennifer for such a simple yet tasty recipe.

My family LOVES this recipe.  It is soooo good.  I follow the recipe just as given, I just bake mine different.  I put it in my bread machine on the dough cycle.  Then when it's done, I knead it a little bit and shape it into a round loaf on my cookie sheet, then let it rise again.  I like to slit the top of it right before it goes in the oven and I bake it at 375 degrees for 15 min. then I pull it out and brush melted butter on the top and bake it for 5 more min.  And the end results are fabulous!!  :)

This was a really easy and good recipe. I put everything in the bread machine and let it knead it for about 10 to 15 mins.  Then took it out and covered it in an oiled bowl for 40 mins.  Also warmed up the oven and turn it off for quick rising.  Then took it out after 40 mins. and rolled it flat and rolled it into a roll like the french baguette recipe.  Covered it and put it back in the oven for another 30 mins.  Baked at 400 degrees until brown.  Delicious!  The crust was chewy and crispy at the same time.  Inside was also soft.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've tried several Sourdough variations and this is my family favorite. I added 4 T. organic apple cider vinegar to sour it up more (in place of 4T of the water). Bread making is not an exact science, but I get pretty consistent results with this recipe. The only bad batches I had were when I used AP flour instead of bread flour. (resulted in "bricks"!)

HOW did anyone make this bread as written????  I just loaded my bread machine with the ingredients as listed...it looked like a batter bread!  I had to add more than another cup of flour to make it come together.  Still waiting to see how it turns out.

Pretty good. My starter was not a good one, but the bread still turned out yummy.

LOVE THIS! I made dinner rolls with this recipe last night. I put in the ingredients and used the dough setting on my bread machine. After the first rise, I took the dough out, punched it down, divided into 16 rolls (in two pie dishes) and allowed to rise once more and baked at 375º for about 20 minutes just in time for supper. They were cheerfully demolished by my very happy family. *** I did add about two teaspoons of sugar just to give the recipe a hint of sweetness.

Just took loaf out of machine and a bit disappointed.  First, I noticed during the kneading process the dough was too wet, so I added flour (about 1/3 c total).  I set my machine for medium crust.  The loaf didn't rise as much as I anticipated and it didn't brown.  The taste is great but a little too dense for me.  I will defintely try this again but perhaps with increasing the yeast and use the dark crust setting.

Perfect. I was skeptical at first...it seemed like too much liquid with the water and starter and it looked too soupy in the beginning. But it turner out absolutely perfect. Thank you.

My husband can't get enough. I was always afraid to try making sourdough because I thought it would be hard, but this recipe was easy to follow and turned out amazing. My husband said it reminded him of San Francisco sourdough. Thank you for sharing.

Made this for the first time today using a new starter (2 weeks old) and i turned out fabulous! I did substitute milk for the water because I wanted a softer crust. I made mine in the oven, I baked bread bowls for 40 minutes at 375. I did use an egg wash as I was making bread bowls for chowder - and it turned out perfect. The dough was the best dough to work with. Very forgiving and very easy.

Fabulous bread! Use all sour dough starter, no water for a stronger flavour. I use dough setting in the breadmaker, let it rise on a cookie sheet for about an hour, then cook for 35 minutes in 360F oven.

I like this bread this is my second time making it. The crust is hard and the inside is soft and spongey. I dont recomend dividing it into 12 rolls the outside is too hard for that plus the rolls are pretty small. It doesnt make that much dough when you take it out of the machine and divide it. Then it doubles as it rises but they are still tiny rolls nothing you could make a sandwich on. Overall I like the flavor and the texture its a good bread!

This was an incredibly easy recipe! I do believe that the quality of your finished product will really depend on the quality of your starter. I mixed it up on the dough cycle then made it into 12 good sized rolls & baked them til golden. Only problem is they are so much better than store bought that my husband wants them all the time!

These were good!  I haven't found the trick to getting a nice crust on sourdough yet.  I can bake other breads like a champ, but for some reason this is a challenge for me.  If anyone can figure it out, let me know!  The only thing I haven't tried is an egg white wash.  I sprayed these with water with no very good results, but the bread itself was wonderful!

I was a little anxious about this as I was oven baking it and not using a bread machine. Right after I dumped the yeast in I wondered if I should have proofed it first as I normally do, but it was too late, so I just hoped for the best. And I got it. Fantastic. This recipe is going to Christmas Dinner.

I don't have a bread machine, and this recipe still works great with homemade sourdough starter. I usually double it, and use 3 cups or white flour and 2 1/3 cups of whole wheat. After 2 sessions of kneading and letting it rise, it comes out of the oven wonderfully fluffy with a fantastic crispy crust

I'm working my way through all the bread machine recipes on this site, in search of the best. This was the first time I ever made sourdough bread so I had to start by making the starter. I used "Sourdough Starter II " and I let is age for 48 hours. The bread turned out to be a large loaf, with nice texture and really moist. My boyfriend and I liked it so well, that I am making the same combination today...one week later. Hopefully this will be more sour than the last(I read that the flavor gets stronger as the starter ages) The only down side, was that it did go moldy in a few days, so we had to toss some. Possibly from the moistness/high yeast content? Now I know we need to eat it a little faster...no problem!

I'm really not sure how to rate this recipe.  I bake a lot and am known for my bread and rolls being wonderful.  Mine, using this recipe however, turned out to be the absolute worst looking bread and was good for nothing but toast because it was thick and heavy.  Even at that it grossed me out and I threw it away.  I think the recipe is probably good depending on 'what type' of starter you are using.  I bake great bread but I am pretty unfamiliar with sourdough breads.  In researching, I found that starters vary greatly and my particular starter is done with no flour, just water, sugar, and potato flakes so it would not have the same consistency as someone who used the 1c. flour/1c. water starter.  I wish there was a distinction in all the sourdough recipes on here because then I'd know what type of bread is made with my type of starter.  Many years ago I had a recipe for starter with the potato flakes and had the recipe to go with it but somewhere along the line it was lost.  It was light and wonderful...not brick-like as this recipe was with my particular starter. If anyone reads this review and has a sourdough recipe using the type of starter I described I sure would appreciate seeing it on here along with a warning on which type of starter it uses.  ;)

This made a good basic sourdough, but only after I added another 2/3 c flour.  It was very wet to start with.

Excellent!
I usually use the machine just to make the dough.
With this recipe I let the machine bake the bread as well. The result was the perfect sourdough! 
THANK YOU!

Great recipe Jennifer. My Mom gave me some of her starter for Christmas and this recipe was my first experiment with it. I added some sugar and oil and cut down the salt a little and it turned out perfect. Our Holiday guests loved it!

Excellent recipe!  I did have to add a little more flour, which varies with every batch depending on humidity, etc.  I also added some honey to the mix.  Great texture - crisp but chewy crust, tender middle.  Very nice!  We'll be using this one again and again.  :o)

I LOVE this bread and so does my rooommate.  I typically make whole grain breads, so I've been experiencing with my starter and adding whole wheat flour to it each week.  So far the bread still turns out so amazing!  I think I may even like it more!

I love the taste and it was so easy to make. I don't hae a bread maker but it worked fine in regular loaf pans - just pour it in and let it rise then bake. 

I don't have teeth and the crust was a little tough for me so I cut the crust in bite size pieces. I will be sure to butter the entire crust to be sure this doesn'[t happen again.

I am diabetic and it din't effect my blood sugar at all, so was good.

We make this bread every week and its amazing.  I do 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour and keep all the proportions the same, it still keeps very moist.  I knead it in the kitchen aid for 12 minutes and put it in a proofing setting on the oven for 30 min, then shaping it in a loaf pan for another 15 minutes to set.  Then it goes into the oven at 375 for 30 minutes.  Such a great and simple recipe!

Plain, simple, and delicious. Best of all It's only 1 point per serving on the Weight Watcher "purple" program, and sourdough bread is diabetic friendly(in moderation of course). I followed the recipe exactly, except I used bread machine yeast and just before the final rising, I removed the dough from the machine, kneaded it for about 3 minutes adding a bit more flour as it was a bit sticky, prepared a loaf pan with olive oil cooking spray and baked it at 375 for 25 minutes. Thank you for sharing this easy and delicious bread.

This is my second time making this. First time, I had the water too hot and killed the yeast, causing it not to rise. Still tasted good, just not pretty. This time-perfect!

Used to make it by hand. Recently received a bread maker so decided to try it out with sourdough bread. Took my time making the starter. Was very pleased with the result. Crispy with great flavour. Will make it again. Easy to make.

the bread this recipe makes is nice, and it does have some sourdough favor. but the sourdough starter is only used as a flavoring. good but not great.

I hate when folks change everything about a recipe then rate it, but here goes:  I mixed it in the bread machine and baked it in the oven. 
increase the sourdough starter to 1 1/2 cups.
Add 1/2 cup semolina flour.
All other ingredients stay the same (salt, bread flour, yeast, water)
Keep an eye on it during the dough cycle, if too soupy add more flour 1 T at a time, or if too dry and mealy a bit of warm water.
You should have a great rise by the end of dough cycle.
Turn out on flour dusted counter, fold 4 times, shape and place in banneton or bowl and cover and let rise till almost doubled.
Turn out of proofing basket, the bottom is now the top.  Score and bake @450 for 30 minutes.  Great recipe!

We don't have a bread machine but I followed the basic instructions I use for regular bread. Add all ingredients into mixing bowl on my stand mixer. Added flour 1/2 cup at a time (took more flour than what the recipe calls for) until dough forms a ball on the dough hook and pulls away from the sides. Emptied dough into a  bowl that has cooking spray coating the inside of the bowl. Roll the dough so it's coated in the cooking spray. Cover the bowl with a wet towel-warm water. Place in a very warm place to let it ride/rest until doubled in size (60-80 minutes). Punch down the dough and roll it out on to a floured surface. I felt there was too much dough for one loaf pan so I divided it into two loaves. Turned out 2 smaller loaves. Anyway, place  dough into two greased loaf pans, cover with wet towel and place in a very warm place until the dough doubles in size. Heat oven to 425°F. Place loaf pans on bottom rack and turn oven down to 375°F. Bake until top turns a light to medium brown and sides pull away from pans (25-35 minutes). Remove from oven. If desired brush melted butter on tops of loaves-will keep the crust more tender.  Let cool 15-20 minutes. Tap bottom of pans and turn out onto a foil covered surface. Let cool to desired warmth. Enjoy. That's what I did. Pictures are accurate and mine.

LOVE THIS BREAD!! Did the oven option (most helpful review)...need to time it better for cooking when the sourdough peaks after feeding. Family loves it, especially right out of the oven!  :D

Easy to make and turns out great. For my initial loaf, I left the recipe as written, although I had to add several extra  tablespoons of bread flour / high gluten flour as dough was too wet.

Makes a small loaf in a bread machine so used 1.5 lb loaf setting (vs 2 lb).

It worked!!!  And it was delicious!  I was skeptical, but I followed the recipe exactly and left the bread machine to do it's thing.  I wasn't sure what it would look like but it was perfect.

Very simple recipe & it turned out great!  This was my first time making bread.  Thank you for making it so easy!  My starter has been fermenting about 8-10 weeks.  I only had a few hours so I used the rapid bake option and used the recipe exactly as shown.   There was not a white bread option on my machine so the basic bake rapid option, size large and medium crust color options were used.  It had just the right crust on top, and was a little brown on the bottom.  The loaf was a pretty good size and dense in a good way - hearty.   I’ll probably use the basic bake option, and light crust option next time just to see what happens, but I’m very happy with the results!  Thanks again for sharing!
*For those who are using a rapid bake option, the bread maker instructions say to add an extra teaspoon of yeast.  Of course I didn’t see this until after I’d started the bread!

It turned out to be a thicker bread than expected. Still pretty good though! If you want more of a sourdough taste, I recommend adding more starter. The sourdough taste was there, but not as much as I like. The second time around I added more starter for my tasting.

Turned out pretty good. Not quite artisan but tasty and so easy. Plus, with bread machine you don't have a hot oven heating up the kitchen in the summer.

I love this recipe for sourdough rolls. When preheating the oven to 425 I also put a metal pan full of water on the bottom rack to make some steam. I love a chewy sourdough! Then I bake as directed except I brush them with butter the last 5 -10 minutes to get that pretty golden crust. Great recipe! Everyone has their own technique. This worked for me.

My husband liked the recipe as is. Sweet and simple. I liked to make things harder so I increased the second batches starter and added 2 tablespoons of butter. I am happy to find a recipe for my bread maker. Tonight I might even make a few sourdough cinnamon rolls.

Don't know what the deal is with those who said this recipe is no good--clearly they screwed it up, maybe their starter was bad, possibly they didn't proof their yeast, which is essential, and I notice that the author did not list a teaspoon of sugar for the proofing, so that might be the problem....this made the best sourdough rolls I've ever had, and that's the truth.  I did not use a bread machine, but it doesn't matter, if you can put together the ingredients for a proper bread recipe and know what you're doing, this is a very easy, reliable recipe with great results.

This was very good, after I made a change.  I made the recipe as written the first time, and the crumb was soft and flavorful but the crust was very hard.  I just made it a second time today and this time, I added 1/3 cup of coconut oil and voila, a perfect loaf of bread with a soft crust.  I also used 1 cup of whole wheat flour in place of 1 cup of white flour, and it turned out great.  Not heavy and dense like some wheat breads.  To the people who did not have good results, if you followed the recipe exactly then the only thing it could be is your sourdough starter.  If you've baked with sourdough for any amount of time, you realize that all starters are different.  Some are very thin and watery, and some are thick.  In all sourdough recipes, you have to make adjustments for the consistency of your starter.  If you make this recipe with a very runny starter and you don't make adjustments to your liquid and dry ingredients to compensate, you can't blame it on the recipe because you'll have the same poor results with any recipe.  Something to keep in mind when working with sourdough starter.

I love to bake but didn't know the concept of the whole procedure (flour rising, temperature etc) but thanks to this site it made it simple and easy to follow.  My husband love Sourdough bread and I got tired of  buying my bakery product from the store so I decided to try something home made and this is by far the easiest and tasty for a beginner to make.  Even the sour dough starter was easy to follow.  Thanks for the recipe!

Have been making this recipe for quite a while now.  Wanted to try SD because my mom made SD pancakes for my dad every morning (no, not fond of pancakes for that reason).  It works great for me. I made my starter with a bit of yogurt and yeast and it is very mild in flavor.  I'm told its more of a European flavor, rather than the american San Francisco style. I've been baking some kind of bread for many years, up to 6 at a time when kids were home.  Learned a lot.  Someone asked why add yeast, its because most sourdough only is very slow and the yeast speeds it up. Using less yeast and giving it more time will develop more flavor in your bread.  The artisan no-knead bread I make takes 1/2 tsp of yeast and raises for at least 6 hours. Bread dough is also affected by weather, and has to be adjusted constantly. Machines are a great time saver, but if you want the best bread, make it by hand. Its good for the soul!  If you want a crispier crust, make sure to keep an oven-proof bowl of water in your oven while baking.

Perfect! I followed the directions and my loaf rose beautifully.  The flavor was better than anything in the store. I baked it at 375 for 40 minutes, on a baking stone lightly coated in cornmeal.  I also lightly coated my loaf with olive oil and sea salt....it turned out crusty and chewy... Delish!  This recipe is a keeper.

This was an awesome recipe. Unfortunately my starter had some sort of bacteria that didnt agree with any of our stomachs.  There is nothing wrong with the recipe it delivered as it was suppose to.

Great recipe. I used my bread machine to make the dough. I did have to add a lot more flour because it was too sticky but that is probably because of the consistancy of my starter. Like others recommended after the initial rise I formed into a ball and after it doubled in size I baked it on 375 for 30 minutes. Can't wait to make rolls with this recipe or bowls for clam chowder.

I didn't make it in a bread machine, but I don't think that would affect the review. It was really  heavy, our Northern Californian sourdough is a fairly light bread, this wasn't. It was OK, will make good sandwhiches but a little blah for just slice and eating.

Smelled great cooking. Texture was better than other recipes I've tried. But, rolls looked deathly white, and were like rocks on the outside.

Super easy! Used it with a 50 year old sour dough starter I was recently gifted. The taste and texture were fantastic. I used the bread machine on the dough cycle and the made 16 large rolls to bake in the oven.  Will definitely make again.

I made this today after using the Sourdough Starter by Esther Nelson from this website. I was a little nervous because I have heard that sourdough bread can be frustrating and tricky. To top things off, I am at a high altitude (about 6200ft). I dumped everything in my bread machine just as the recipe said and according to my machine's suggestions. This bread was AWESOME! I will be keeping my sourdough starter going and making this bread often!

Fantastic, easy recipe! I started my sourdough starter on Sunday and used it in this recipe on Wed. I made 8 large rolls after using the bread machine dough cycle and baked them in a greased pan at 375 per another review for 15 minutes. Perfect crust and interior.

Very easy and delicious.  I am not sure why people are complaining about soupy or runny dough, all you have to do is a little more flour, it calls for 2 2/3 cups of flour and with the extra flour used for kneading I probably used closer to 3 cups.  Fantastic recipe, I'll definitely use this again.

I'm using a potato starter which is a little runny. So, when I add the starter I will hold back some of the liquid that is also called for in this recipe. That way I can control how wet or dry the dough is. As the dough is mixing I can contine to add the liquid using a rubber scraper to make sure the flour is being incorporated. I continue to do this until the dough is clinging together but not sticking on the side of the pan. I think that may be why some people are having a problem with this recipe being batter like. All in all, this is a great recipe and I make it about once a week. Makes great toast!

Wow!!  I'm going to use this for a long, long time.  I tried a few different recipes, but this is the best.  Bread comes out moist, almost doughy.  A very lightly browned crust when I use the large - light setting on my bread machine.  So easy - never thought I could do a yeast bread & especially one with a starter!  But it is so easy  & so delicious.  Yum!!

I have to agree with the other reviewer.  The dough was more like a thick cake mix not at all a bread dough.  I added tons of flour to the mix and it was still too wet and to top it off, now it was too big for my bread machine!  I make homemade bread almost everyday but have never had a recipe quite as soupy as this one.

First bread that rose just right in my machine.  Nice and fluffy, but maybe a little too much salt in the recipe.

Good but not great.  Would benefit from some margarine or butter.
