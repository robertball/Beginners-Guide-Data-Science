I'd give this a 3.5 if I could. It was good but it wasn't really what I would call a "dip" because it came out really thick. I thought it would have been much better as a spread or even a whipped frosting.

Yum! This was fantastic!  We spread the leftovers on everything! (Bagels, banana sandwiches, fruit, pound cake, etc.!)
