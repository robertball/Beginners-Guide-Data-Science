Thanks for publishing AR!  This is one of my favorite personal recipes, I just made it for a dinner party a few weeks ago.  I served it on a bed of arugula tossed in EVOO and balsamic, then topped the slices with blistered cherry tomatoes.  Great meal for outdoor entertaining.  Marinate overnight, even two days, for great flavor and tenderness.  Make the sauce  several hours ahead so the flavors meld and donâ€™t forget to salt and pepper to taste.  Enjoy!
