The flavor was very good and the recipe was easy to follow.  In the future I would greatly increase the marinating time.  I think this recipe would work well for most steaks.

Quite delicious!  And easy to make.  I did marinate the meat for 8 hours and am glad I did.  I'm new to grilling and used my propane grill with some hickory chips hoping for a smoky  flavor.  The recipe was spot on--8 minutes each side with my temperature at 350.  The sauce was also delicious.  I served it with cauliflower-gnocchi and the sauce really elevated this otherwise bland vegetable side dish.  I also served a side of broccoli with lemon juice.  I'll make this again.  And I concur with the previous reviewer: this sauce would be amazing over just about any type of protein (beef, chicken or fish).

Simple to prepare and make, yet it's delicious.  I made it for guests and they loved it.
