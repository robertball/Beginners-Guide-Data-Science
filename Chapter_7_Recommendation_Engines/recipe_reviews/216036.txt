This is really good, I just had a couple of changes, I added some salt and pepper to the meatballs,also you need to have more sauce. I made pineapple rice and put the meatballs over. It was yummy!!!

I only rated this 3 because we didn't care for the taste of the dried mushrooms in the meatballs. Once the mushrooms were picked out we enjoyed them and the sauce  is very tasty and not overly sweet.

This just didn't work for us.  The meatballs smelled delicious while they were baking but we didn't care for the way they tasted.

These were wonderful!  We didn't have mushrooms on hand, yet it was still delicious!  I would totally recommend this!  We served it over rice but we want to try noodles next time!

The blend seemed weird, but it worked. Served up with the Lo Mein Noodles with vegetables from this site and will definitely make both again.

Wow!  My Husband said meatball heaven.  I did change a few things because he and my son do not like mushrooms.  Used 1 tsp. hoisin and 1/2 tsp. fish sauce in the meatballs instead of the soy sauce and added a little diced green pepper and grated ginger root. For the sauce, I used 3/4 cup water and vegetable bullion cube instead of the mushroom soaked water.  They turned out juicy and perfectly cooked with enough sauce served over ramen noodles.

I left out the mushrooms and added about 3 tbsp of bread crumbs. This was a big hit with my family.  My boys loved it.  I left the cover off for the last 30 minutes so the meatballs would have a bit of a crust and served it with brown rice.

What did I do wrong?  I followed the directions to a T, omitting the mushrooms like some stated.  It was awful!  Meatballs were dry and tasteless.  I made a whole batch and froze some, so next time I am going to try and doctor them up with some Dijon mustard for a "honey mustard" sauce.

I added salt and pepper and about 1/4 cup Pablo bread crumbs!  Very tasty!  Agree with some of the previous comments - needs more sauce.

This was very good. I did not have any applesauce but I had some apple juice. Enjoyed the sweetness of the sauce with the meatballs.
