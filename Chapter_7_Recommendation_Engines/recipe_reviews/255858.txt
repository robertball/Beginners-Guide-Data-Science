This method is excellent. It creates a beautiful filling, thick and juicy. The crust is wonderful. I used a gluten free flour blend instead of the millet in the notes. The temperature and timing for baking was spot on. My only problem is the amount of sugar. It was too sweet. I know this is subjective, but the sugar overpowered the apple flavor. Next time, I will drastically decrease the sugar amount. Thank you for the recipe.
