I made this the first time this New Year's eve.  I was going to friends and needed an appetizer to take.  Everyone raved (and I only made it an hour before).  Then I took it the next week to a football watching party.  Again raves.  Both women have since then made the recipe themselves, which is a testimony to how good it is.  While I am not one to measure, I basically make this recipe as is.  Complex flavors with a surprising slight sweet taste (but not too much).  Great go-to recipe.  Healthy and tasty.

Just made this for Christmas Eve and it was a great success!  Just a few changes...I used a 16oz can of Mexican petite diced tomatoes instead of the chopped Romas.  They had jalapeno peppers so did not add any more.  I used Splenda instead of 2 T sugar and I added a can of Mexicali corn.  Yummy!

Help!  I've made this awesome recipe and I can't stop eating it!  I couldn't find canned black eyed peas so I used my favorite - black beans - and it is probably just as tasty.  I've gotta go now, I need to make more of this tasty recipe!

So yummy! Every time I make this several people ask for the recipe. I do not add the sugar or salt. I substituted 1 cup italain dressing for the olive oil & vinegar. I also add one can of shoe peg corn (drained.) Enjoy!

this has a lovely flavor, and it hasnt even had a chance to marry in the fridge yet...so im looking forward to trying it after a few hours of sitting.  i used a can of diced rotel tomatoes w/ green chilies instead of the fresh tomatoes (didnt have any, though im sure it would be even better with the fresh as suggested).  i also added half a can of corn w/ green chilies (just had them left over in the fridge and wanted to use them up :)  For folks complaining of it being too sweet...just cut the sugar back a bit, but dont omit it all together...the combination of balsamic vinegar and sugar is what makes it...that and lots of garlic....but give this dish a try...its simple and good!  :)

This recipe is way too sweet! I would omit the sugar all together, add less oil and put in some red and green pepper.

This was very good!  I made a few changes to make this a light meal instead of a side dish.  I added two boneless/skinless chicken thighs (diced, which I cooked with frozen black eyed peas instead of canned, then I rinsed the black eyes peas and chicken).  This would also work with pre-cooked/grilled chicken breast.  I also added avocado and sweet corn.  I cut the sugar in half, but it was still a little too sweet for me - next time I would use either sweet corn or sugar, but not both.  To cut the sweetness and add spice (I didn't have any jalapenos on hand), I added about 1 tsp of hot sauce, some red pepper flakes, and I squeezed some lime juice just before serving.  This was yummy, and a beautiful, colorful presentation for an outdoor, summer/spring evening dinner!  I also made a kid-friendly batch with no onion, garlic, or peppers, which 2 out of 3 of my kids enjoyed.

We made this dip for New Years this year. It was a huge hit and didn't last long at the party. I added diced avocados which were awesome!! Next time I'll double the recipe. My husband loved it and he hates black eyed peas!

This recipe makes a good, healthy, and easy appetizer.  I rated three stars because it was a little bit sweet. Next time I will omit the sugar and add some chopped red pepper.

Very good! I was a bit skeptical when I saw it only had one review, but the list of ingredients sounded simple enough. I was very pleased with the outcome. Made it just like the recipe says except for the cilantro, which my husband doesn't like. Very yummy!

Okay, so I often make mistakes, like cutting this recipe in half!
It’s only me, after all, and I didn’t want a lot left over. It didn’t even make it to the fridge!  I didn’t have the exact ingredients on hand so I used dried cilantro, jarred Jalapeños, garlic, and didn’t add sugar. I used less than half of the spices. I will make this on a regular basis. It’s even good as a side with dinner. You’ve got to try this!

I took this to the church potluck, everyone asked for the recipe! I did omit the vinegar, one of the church members cannot have it.  Next time I will try it with a can of sweet corn.

Was looking for something to do with black eyed peas for New Year's Day. I substituted a can of Mild Rotel tomatoes for the tomatoes and jalapeño because that's what I had on hand and thought it turned out great, even my kids liked it :) will definitely make again

I made this for my meatless Monday spread and it was awesome! It sounded weird, but everything works so well together. Totally making this one again. I only had half of the balsamic so I used red wine vinegar for the rest. I also added the jalapeno.

Yuck! May not have been so bad had there not been so much sugar. The sugar masks the flavor of the cilantro and black eyed peas.

I recently prepared this very for our Family & Friends Day at our home and it was a huge hit!!! However, I did make a couple of changes; the picture of this BLACK-EYED PEA DIP shows "corn" as an ingredient, but the recipe doesn't mention anything about adding corn. What I did was add fresh New Jersey "sweet corn" (boiled and the cut from the cob), instead of sugar and added the juice of 1 lime. Again, this recipe was a hit! Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious!  I added Mexicali corn and extra home grown tomatoes.  Left out the sugar because it was not needed with the corn.  Very satisfying and relatively healthy!!

This Is awesome! I've made this three times in the last week, with a few time saving options. I used a can of Rotel with chiles and added a little more onions and garlic. I made it to bring as a dip with chips for a gathering, but I have since used it as an addition to fish for fish tacos, and again added it to pre-cooked chicken and salsa verde in baked tortilla shells for a yummy Mexican salad. It is so delicious, we don't miss the cheese and sour cream one might usually add to these dishes. I plan to keep this at the ready in the fridge during the summer months, because it can easily be used as a base for a wonderful, light, high protein meal.  Who needs to go get the "who knows what's in it" plate at the local joint when you can make fresh, tasty food at home for a fraction of the cost? Thanks so much for a great recipe!!
