I used a different marinade... basic Italian dressing and minced onions and put it in the fridge over night. Then cooked it up the next day.  It was so delish my five year old daughter (who didn't know what it was) kept popping them in her mouth after they got done cooking.  Stuck the few left overs in the fridge and ate them over salad today, even better.  Thanks.

Thanks Angie!  I made this recipe tonight; it was my first time making venison--though I've had it before--and it was meat from my fiance's first deer!  This was a very good recipe and I recommend it.  Venison by nature can be dry and chewy, but with the marinade the meat was tender and I made a little sauce with the pan remnants to keep it juicy.  My fiance said he had never had venison so good, and it's a great change from the usual venison casserole everyone seems to make.

I threw in some chopped onion and garlic with the beer and w. sauce.  I did not coat the meat, just grilled it.  I thought it was good.

My husband and three young boys were thrilled with this receipe.  The dredging made the meat taste great, but my boys liked the plain meat best (with A1 sauce).  The meat didn't taste gamey and was tender enough to cut with a fork.

I'm sure this is great for someone who doesn't like the taste of venison, but in Central PA we are born and bred on on it. I should have followed my natural instincts and pan fried the tender backstrap that I used for this recipe the way I normally do. 
Bottom line: If you don't like the taste of wild game, don't eat it, but please don't offer recipes that completely ruin it either.

I love venison, because it is so low in fat, and this marinade was excellent.  I also tried the marinade on chicken and pork.  It was killer...

This is excellent. I would not recommend adding a half bottle of Worcestershire sauce as the recipe calls for. I added about 8 shakes and that was plenty. It is best to cook the meat until it bleeds through and then flip it until it bleeds on the other side. Venison is best when it is medium rare.

Very good.  Bf's friend gave us some venison steak and ground venison, and I'll admit I have no idea what to do with venison, and I thought this recipe sounded good, so I thought I'd give it a try.  A little time consuming, what with the pounding, cutting, marinating, dredging and frying (I just made this recipe sound like it takes years, didn't I?), but it's easy enough if you break down the steps.  I pounded it out, cut it, and put it in the marinade last night.  I know it says to marinate for only an hour, but I really didn't want it last night, so it was probably in the fridge for 12 hours or so.  I drained the venison of the marinade then instead of dredging each piece in the flour mixture, I put everything in a ziploc bag and shook it until it was covered.  It worked just fine.  I don't have onion salt so I just added about a 1/2 tsp of salt to the flour mixture.  I wasn't really sure how much oil to use, but just kept adding a little oil when it got dry--venison is much much leaner than other meats I'm used to!  We served on buns with cheese and bf wants to do lettuce wraps with the remaining meat.  Thanks for the recipe!  It was very good!

I had two venison tenderloins and no idea what to do with them.  I marinated them in the beer and worcestershire for about 8 hours and grilled them (whole).  WOW!  They were great, a real crowd pleaser.  Thanks for a great recipe!

very versatile!  I happened to drink all my beer, so did a little italian dressing w/ it.  We had the medallians with some fresh eggs for breakfast.  Even the pickiest of the crew liked it...till I said it was venison!  But then grudgingly admitted hating the "bambi" factor.  Give this a try!

This was interesting. I really didn't care for the breading at all. The marinade was pretty good though it was almost like a teriyaki flavor minus the ginger and sesame oil. I might try adding that next time and then cook without the breading to make teriyaki deer sticks. It WAS very tender.

WONDERFUL!!! This is the 1st time I have ever cooked deer and it turned out Perfect!!! I tenderized the loin steaks w/ my meat mallet...then added a bit of olive oil before I poured the beer over them. Then I eyeballed the amt of W.sauce. I also pressed a clove of garlic into the marinade. I let it sit for an hr then dredged it in the flour mixture. I didn't have any white flour so I used whole wheat. I fried them in coconut oil and served. The whole family loved them!! TY for a great recipe!!! =)

we eat alot of venison I am proud to say and am always looking for different recipes...this one is a huge hit. My 12 yr old son made it for a school project after the first time I made it for the family and well he did not have enough to go around. Any hunter should try this recipe as is.

I'm not sure what this is supposed to taste like, but do not marinade for longer than it suggests.  I wasn't able to cook this when I had originally planned, so it marinated for 3 days.  The worchestershire sauce taste was so strong, we had to throw the venison away.

Excellent!  My sister had given me some venison steaks...as well as lamb steaks.  I decided to just combine the two and try this recipe.  My husband doesn't care for either of these meats, yet actually liked this!  It gives the meat an interesting tang, but doesn't hide the flavor.  My kids and mother liked it, too, and I absolutely loved it!  Now I'll have to beg for more venison from my sister!

This is a keeper. Really takes away the gamey taste, and tenderizes nicely. I added some dry oregano and sage to the marinade. We then made Po Boy style sammy's with it.

This was awesome!  I used Sam Adams Black Lager(great beer for cooking) and let it marinade at least 8 hours.  Wonderful flavor, and kids and husband loved it!

I love venison and grew up eating it. I cooked this as stated, but chose to marinate it overnight and all day. The meat was very tender and delicious. Even our two and a half year old gobbled it down!

I think this marinate is good for venison. I am not a big fan of the meat, but my husband got 2 deer last year, and we have tons of meat to use up. I use half batch on the exact recipe, while the 2nd half just cooked as stif-fry. My husband likes it.

Excellent meal, followed exactly...could maybe add a little cayanne pepper to the flour mix to add some heat-overall a great marinade for venison!

I made the recipe as written. It could use a little more seasoning in the flour. The Worcestershire was a bit overpowering. Overall though, this was a good starter recipe for someone like me that isn't experienced with cooking venison. It didn't taste gamey at all.

I did not pound it. I sliced backstrap 1 1/2 inches thick, browned it well, and placed the steaks in a crock pot and covered with the drippings and some beef stock. Served it over mashed potatoes and noodles. Melt in your mouth tender.

I left it over night and cooked it when I got home the next evening. It was so bitter and salty. I will try it again with only marinating it for an hour. 'the or more' on this recipe should really have an end time for not so skilled cooks like me :)
I so wanted this to be as fabulous as everyone was saying.

This recipe was great. There was no gamey taste. I made it exactly like the recipe, except added a chopped onion. We will be making this again. I have two hunters in the family and alot of venison to use. Thank you for the new recipe.

Something different for deer... I think I soaked it in the cider too long so it was too "appley". other than that it was OK..not to sure I'd cook it this way again
