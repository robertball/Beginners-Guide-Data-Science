This dip is a win-win; so healthy and flavorful! Who knew beans, yogurt and feta worked together. The fresh herbs really make it. I followed it exactly, won't change a thing in the future. Please heed Heather's advice to let it set overnight (I served mine too soon - but nearly polished it off the next day!). Not only does the flavor deepen but it thickens up. P.S. I used water packed fresh feta and will make this with Greek yogurt next time for an even creamier consistency. Thanks Heather, I finally have a great tasting dip I don't have to feel guilty about!

This is off the hook! So creamy and bursting with flavor. I made a special trip this morning to the store for organic garbanzo beans/feta cheese and fresh spices. Like a previous reviewer said, fresh spices are extremely important! So, so good. I had to tear myself away from it. I plan on letting it sit overnight and attacking it tomorrow. This one is a keeper and a pass-it-on! A+ recipe, at least. NOTE: My dad now makes homemade organic plain yogurt. I can only imagine how good it will be when I use that.

Heather this is an excellent dip! This is truly a no guilt dip and one that's actually good for you! I used a good Greek yogurt and because I didn't have any mint, I subbed with lemon thyme. Some icy cold cucumber spears made the perfect and most refreshing mode of transportation to my mouth. Yum and thank you!

I liked this dip very much asdid my son- hubs not so much, but he is a bit picky when it comes to hummus and pesto type dips and sauces.  I did as others suggested and made it up the day before, which I do believe really helped develop the flavors. We used raw cuke slices, celery, baby carrots and wheat crackers for dippers.  Very pretty and unusual dip and so healthy!

I skipped the chopping and threw everything in the food processor and let it go. I will definitely be making this recipe in the future. It is delicious!

This is pretty darned good.  There is something that's not quite perfect, but I can't place my finger on it.  As is though, I have been gladly eating this for any meal with bread or crackers.  Not sure I'll make it again since I can't figure out what I need to adjust to make it perfect to my taste, but it was also well received at a small group gathering.

This is great! It definitely tastes better after a day or so. I love to spread this dip on top of my turkey burgers.

LOVED this!  This is one of those rare things that's both healthy AND really tasty. I will be making this a lot. Makes a good dip for veggies, pita bread or even a yummy low-fat nutritious salad dressing. I will say that two cloves of raw garlic makes for a strong garlic flavor, which I happen to love. But if you're not a fan of strong garlic flavor, I would either use one clove or roast your garlic first. Thank you so much for this recipe!

Very very good.  Did not have the same kind of beans, and that may have slightly affected it.  But this dip is awesome--veggie sticks, crackers, pretzels, etc.

Two cloves of garlic was WAY too much. I won't be making this again.

So I must be the odd person out seeing as this recipe got so many great reviews, but no one at my work cared much for this.  The combination of the yogurt, beans, and feta just didn't work for us.  It never became smooth and had a grainy texture.  There was an unpleasant sour note  and all the beautiful fresh herbs just couldn't tame the feta forward factor in this dip and I love feta.

I made the dip as per the recipe and we loved the rich flavor of the herbs with fresh vegetables.

Excellent!  I will be making this again and again.  Used fresh herbs and Greek yogurt. (Low fat). Such a fresh tasting and guilt free dip, for a change!
