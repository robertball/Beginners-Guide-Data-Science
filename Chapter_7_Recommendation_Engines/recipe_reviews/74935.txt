Thank you for the kind reviews.  As user Baked noted, this recipe does have too much sugar.  It should be half the amount listed in the recipe - 1/2 cup.  Not sure how that happened as I didn't submit it that way.  It seems the part about draining the zucchini was left out as well.  The mix can be too wet if the zuchinni isn't drained.

I made changes to make them healthier and my picky son STILL gobbled them up.  I upped the veggies and applesauce, added flax seed, lowered the oil, omitted the white sugar altogether.  Also, if you don't have oat flour, just toss plain oatmeal into the blender and voila! oat flour.

Whoa! very moist! I used only whole wheat flour and  oats (didn't have oat flour) and I added 1/2 cup ground flax seed. I didn't put in any sugar, only the honey. Oh, and I didn't have applesauce so I crushed some pineapple. It would have been fine without any applesauce or pineapple all together. Didn't use raisins, just walnuts. These smell so amazing and they really taste great! Got the thumbs up from family. Thanks for the recipe :D

this recipe works even when you replace the ingredients.  i use only half the oil and the remainder in flaxmeal, quick rolled oats instead of oat flour, egg whites instead of eggs, nonfat yogurt instead of regular fat yogurt and stevia & splenda instead of plain sugar.  everyone who tried my "healthier" version really liked them!  (this revised recipe comes out to 160 calories and 5.25 grams of fat per muffin).

I followed the recipe.  The only changes I made was that I cut the sugar back to 1/2C. and I used Vanilla yogurt. You must remove the excess liquid from the zucchini.  To do this easily and remove alot of it's juice, just put the shredded zucchini into a potato ricer and squeeze. (You'll be amazed how much a potato ricer can squeeze out!) Also, if you want a nice  dome top for this muffin or any quick breads, heat oven to a HOT 450' oven, put muffins in and immediately reduce Temp to what the recipe states, in this case 400'  for 18min.  I think these muffins are really good.  I left out the nuts as I don't like crunch in my muffins!  THX

Loved this recipe.  I did this as 2 loaves instead of muffins (reduce heat to 350 and cook for 45-50 minutes.)  I also substituted brown sugar for white, used all applesauce and no oil, used all carrots and substituted ginger for the nutmeg.  Turned out great!

These turned out to be some of the most beautiful, tasty, and healthful muffins I've ever baked! I prepared them as directed with one small adjustment, well, two actually: I didn't have enough honey, so I added real maple syrup to the honey, and I didn't want to use refined sugar, so I used @ 2/3 c. of sucanat. Oh, and I almost forgot - I didn't have oat flour, so I substituted oat bran. They rose like no muffin I've baked before, have a wonderful taste and texture. I will be using this recipe quite a bit, although I think I may try to go a step further and omit the oil altogether, substituting applesauce. Oh, and by the way, I also added 2T wheat germ and 2T ground flax seed.

Great Muffin! I changed things up a bit. I upped the wheat flour to 1 cup, and reduced the all-purpose flour to 3/4 cup. I also added 1/2 cup of soy flour to add some protein. I used oatmeal that I put in the blender because I didn't have any oat flour and that worked great. I also did not add the cup of sugar and only went with the 3/4 cup honey (I'd rather have honey than white sugar). Lastly, I didn't have any yogurt, so I used sour cream. The muffins came out moist, and really tasty. I don't like muffins too sweet, so these were perfect! Thanks for the recipe and all the suggestions!

These muffins are quite tasty as stated.  I have made them twice and will continue to make them.  The first time I made them I substituted oats for oat flour and cut the sugar to 1/8 cup.  These were quite popular, but since I like to freeze my batter into the paper cups I wanted to see if I could adapt this recipe to freeze quicker and I wanted to try and cut the sugar some more.  The second time I substituted oats for oat flour, cut the all-purpose flour to 1-1/4 cup, added 1/4 cup of wheat germ, switched my 1/8 cup of white sugar to brown sugar, cut the oil to 1/4 cup and cut the honey to 1/2 cup.  These didnâ€™t seem to freeze any quicker.  So, the final recipe that I will be sticking with is using the oats, 1/8 cup of white sugar, keeping the wheat germ and only using 1/4 cup of oil.  These were popular with the 15 month old, all the way to the grandparents.

Boy these are good! I used ground flaxseed (1 1/2 cups) in place of the 1/2 cup oil.  Increased the amount of veggies too!  These are so yummy, this recipe is a keeper :)

I'm ashamed to say this recipe didn't work out for me. And even more ashamed to say because of its popularity and great reviews I doubled the batch expecting to freeze and eat these for breakfast for weeks to come. I followed the recipe pretty closely but took the advice that worked for others. I squeezed excess moisture from zuchinni. I decreased the sugar and subbed honey. I also used dried cherries and walnuts instead. It seemed like everyone took their own variations and were pleased. Mine were bland and boring for everything that went into them. My mother's buttermilk bran and raisin muffins are much better and quicker to make. These seemed like a far cry from those. They were barely sweet and the texture was too dense. I realize I decreased the sugar too much but I was very careful to not over-work the batter which usually produces toughness. I used the suggestion of another and raised the oven temp for preheating and then lowered to the recipe's temp upon placing the muffins inside. This did produce a tall muffin but the bottoms began to blacken on me. On the second round I lowered the oven temp to 375 and this still occured. I know it sounds like this could be the tell-tale sign of an amateur baker but I assure you I'm not. This just wasn't for me. But I appreciate and applaud all those that were able to get great results. Don't let my review sway you against trying this out. Everyone's opinions and experiences are different. This was just mine.

This recipe is really good! I modified the recipe even more to make it more healthier. This resulted in the muffins being very flavorful (not too sweet at all, just perfect), and quite moist. Basically I prepared the veggies differently, omitted the vanilla and the sugar, substituted vanilla for plain yogurt and added a touch of pure maple syrup. much better than the granulated sugar, at the same time making the muffins quite moist! Plus: no processed ingredients! Also: Skip the salt- really there is no reason for it to be there:)

This is what I used:

2 cups whole wheat flour
3/4 cup whole grain oats- thrown in blender to make into powder
1tsp baking soda
1tsp baking powder
2.5 tsp cinnamon
1/4 tsp nutmeg
3 eggs
1/2 cup canola oil
3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce
1 cup VANILLA yogurt
2tbsp pure maple syrup
1 cup of zucchini (puree in blender)
1 cup of carrots (puree in blender)
1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup cranberries

Used all whole wheat flour, no oil (upped the applesauce to 1c), and no sugar, just the honey. No carrots, just upped zucchini to 2c.  Awesome!!  Some I added mini chocolate chips!  Sooo good!!!

I could immediately see by looking at the ingredients that there was too much sugar/honey combo.  I just omitted the honey.  These were very good muffins.  Rose nicely.  This made 12 regular size and 5 giant size muffins.  I did have to turn the oven down to 375 w/the giant muffins, as they started to get too brown around the edges and not done enough in the middle.  Very nice flavor for being a 'healthy' snack!  Used frozen zucchini that I had already shredded and just thawed and drained.

These are SO great for getting veggies in kids.  Yesterday I used one as leverage to get the picky one to eat the vegetable on his plate, unaware I was using vegetables, yogurt, and whole grains to bribe him. I get great reviews every time I make them.  They really are best with golden raisins and nuts, but also good with neither.  I use 0% fat greek yogurt and use 1/2 cup of sucanat or turbinado rather than sugar.  They freeze well, and are nice as mini muffins. (I think I bake minis about 12 minutes.)  GREAT recipe!

This is a GREAT recipe! I substituted a few things. I used all whole-wheat flour, and oats instead of oat flour. I didn't use any oil or yogurt. I added about half a cup of apple juice (to maintain consistency), and I didn't add any sugar. The first batch I made I didn't have any carrots so I used 2-3 times more zucchini than it called for. They turned out AMAZING! And they were healthy with the substitutions. The zucchini makes it very moist. The 2nd time I made it with carrots and it turned out good too. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Lots of ingredients, but don't let that scare you. They really don't take very long to make, and they are delicious, and relatively healthy for a muffin. Couldn't find oat flour, so I used 3/4 cup all purpose flour and 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour. Great flavour and tender texture. Thanks!

Yummy!  Modifications: used only whole wheat flour (2-1/4 c. total), whole oats rather than oat flour, added 1/4 tsp. ginger, used a full cup applesauce and no oil, cut out white sugar and instead put in 1 tsp. stevia, used extra zucchini and carrots (one medium zucchini, two medium carrots), substituted walnuts for pecans (all I had on hand), and added about 1/4 c. shredded coconut.  These are EXTREMELY moist, so much so that I made the mistake of thinking they were underdone and ended up burning the outsides, but that was purely my fault, not the recipe's.  Still delicious, though!  Next time, I don't know that I would replace the oil with extra applesauce, as they taste a bit too appley and acidic, but again, my fault, not the recipe's.  And still delicious. ;)  These are very flexible and hard to mess up!  Have fun experimenting with your ingredients!

My toddler (and I) could eat these all day long! I made a few substitutions based on what I had on hand and personal preference. I didn't have quite enough applesauce, so I added in a couple of mashed bananas, and didn't drain the zucchini much to make up for the extra liquid needed. I used chopped up oats, for oat flour (increased to just over 1 cup), and I omitted the sugar. I made 12 muffins with half the batter, and then turned the oven down to 350 and used the other half in a bread pan for about 45 minutes. Thanks for a great recipe!

perfectly moist. I didn't have oat flour so I increased the flour 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup of oatmeal. The muffins were very light and moist. Very good flavor, but I'll try a little less cinnamon next time to bring out the zucchini and carrot flavors.

I've tried many different healthy muffin/cookie recipes and rarely succeed in getting the approval of my 2 year old and husband.  These muffins did the trick!  Great way to sneak a few veggies into my child!

AWESOME!!! I tweeked it by switching the amounts of flour...I did more wheat than plain.  I also added a little cocoa powder for a little extra flavor...SO YUM and some wheat germ!  Also, instead of the oat flour I used 1/2c baby oatmeal and 1/4c instant oatmeal!  They are a HUGE hit with my non-veggie eating toddler!  Thank you!

This is my kind of recipe!  Chock full of healthy ingredients, they are also really delicious.  I did  add little flax seed meal and raisins, but gave them a whirl in my food processor (I also have a super-picky toddler who refuses textures).  This recipe has many possibilities--next time I'll add some spinach leaves for even more nutrition.  The texture is outstanding.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I cut out the sugar and oil, but the texture and sweetness were still perfect!  I also cut out the all-purpose flour and instead used a total of 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 cup oat flour.  They're really tasty, and it's hard to stop eating them.

I got 20 large muffins, even after cutting out the oil and sugar.  My batter was not soupy and liquidy like other people described, but that might be because I used a thick, unfiltered honey.

These muffins were excellent. I had to substitute 8 ounces of softened neufchatel cheese for the yogurt and I used 2 1/4 cups of whole wheat pastry flour rather than mixing all purpose and whole wheat flour. I baked these in large muffin pans. This recipe yields exactly 1 dozen large muffins. The type of muffin pan that you use is important. I used a cheap pan and a more expensive pan. The muffins from the cheap pan cooked faster and were slightly burned. I will definitely make this recipe again--after I get rid of the cheap muffin pans.

Fantastic recipe! Instead of the 1 cup of sugar, I added 1 cup of chocolate chips. Amazing how yummy they taste with no sugar added! (other than the chocolate chips)

I added flax seeds, dried cranberries instead of raisins, and raspberry yogurt in place of plain and the added white sugar. Even with the substitutions, they turned out really good, and my 2 year old loved them.

This recipe was GREAT. They were very moist and the entire family loved them. I made them even healthier. Used 1 1/2C whole wheat flour; 1/2 C oat bran; .1/4C wheat germ; 1/2 cup honey and 1/2 Cup sugar. I will cut the sugar even more next time. My son added mini choc chips and we baked half of them in a mini muffin pan.

This was a great recipe! I was out of honey, so I added 3/4 cup of peanut butter (should have only added 1/2 cup)and it was awesome! I'll experiment more with this recipe and maybe add chocolate chips next time. My whole family ate it up!

I did 1 1/4 cups white flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour, quick cooking oats instead of oat flour, omitted the nutmeg, omitted the oil and used 1 cup applesauce, used 1/4 cup sugar and no honey (I have a baby that eats them), and only used zucchini- THEY WERE AWESOME!  I love when I can find a healthy homemade snack.  My 2 year old daughter gobbled them up!  You definitely don't need all the sugar.  This is a fantastic recipe to change to your liking, and for that I give it 5 stars.

these are amazing! I did omit all of the sugar, used a little less honey and added a little agave nectar. I threw in a few whole oats, flax, and extra zucchini & carrots. My nephew (almost 2) is a HUGE fan. He's not super picky, but there are few things that he gets as excited about as these muffins!

DELICIOUS!!!!  I made these except used quick-cooking oats (3/4 cup, just chopped them in Cuisinart) and only 1/2 cup honey..... they were GREAT!!!  I topped them with a little bit of cream cheese frosting and my kids devoured them!  They really just taste like carrot cake but have some healthy vitamins and fiber added!

I've made these muffins a few times and I love them.  This time I used pumkin puree leftover from the Downeast Maine Pumkin bread as I didn't have any zucchini.  I didn't have any raisins and I did miss that ingredient in the muffin!  Next time I will go back to the origional recipe and perhaps add some sunflower seeds!

Very moist and great tasting!

We loved it! I made some changes: used whole wheat instead of all purpose flour, used applesauce instead of oil, added some flax seeds and multigrain mix. Next time I will use some vegetable oil so it doesn't stick to the muffin cups so much.

Hooray! My one year old loooves these, and so does my husband, who hates carrots and zucchini. The next time I make it I will probably tweak it a bit by cutting back on the oil/sugar and adding more vegetables. My only crit is that It only contains about 1.3 tablespoons of veggies per serving, which is one serving of veggies for my one year old but wouldn't be an entire serving for a two year old or older toddler. Otherwise, hooray for any recipe that gets my son to eat vegetables so eagerly!

THESE WERE DELICIOUS!I DIDN'T HAVE OAT FLOUR, SO I USED WHEAT BRAN. I CUT DOWN ON THE SUGAR(ACTUALLY I USED SPLENDA), BUT ONLY USED 3/4 CUP. I COULD CUT DOWN ON THE HONEY NEXT TIME TOO.
I ALSO USED THE APPLESAUCE THAT IT CALLED FOR, PLUS I USED APPLESAUCE INSTEAD OF THE AMOUNT OF OIL. THEY WERE REALLY GOOD. GOOD FLAVOUR, AND MOIST. I WILL BE MAKING THESE AGAIN FOR SURE.
THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!

First off, I want to thank Carinab for a delicious recipe. The muffins are yummy! I'd like to suggest a modification, however. Even with the veggies and whole grains, the recipe is *not* healthy for children as written. It has more sugar per muffin than the sweetest kids' cereals. The recipe contains at least 430 grams of sugar (or 18 grams of sugar per muffin, assuming 24 muffins). By comparison, a serving of Trix or Lucky Charms cereal contains 13 grams of sugar. When I eliminated the honey from the recipe, thereby cutting the sugar content nearly in half, they still came out exceedingly sweet. I think the oil could be reduced as well to 1/3 cup or less for a lower fat, lower calorie muffin.

This was a wonderful recipe! I just added a little more applesauce in place of half the oil and more honey in place of some white sugar. And of course Craisins! I think it takes a little less time to cook when using the applesause sub.

So very good and my 7yr old can eat his veggies! I made changes as I didn't have all the ingredients. I doubled the recipe using 4 cups white flour and 2 cups oatmeal, used canned pumpkin instead of applesauce, used a full 17 oz container of GREEK yogurt, cut the honey down to only 1/2 cup for the double recipe, didn't have the nuts or raisins. These were GREAT! my son won't touch carrots or zucchini or yogurt .. till now! I used a BIG square cake pan for the double recipe.. baked on 350*F for about 35 min (till toothpick came out clean)

Oh yum! I just had one fresh out the oven!  Made just a few minor changes - didn't have oat flour, so ground some oatmeal in the food processor.  I like dark brown sugar, so I did 1/2 white, 1/2 dark brown.  Will definitely make again!  Always looking for different ways to use up zucchini & get veggies in the kids!

I thought these were great! Very moist. I cut out all the sugar and doubled the spices. I used oat bran instead of oat flour. I also used only almond flour to make them gluten free. My toddler loves them!

These muffins are good if you're looking for a healthy muffin recipe, but they're not my favorite overall. While very moist, the flavor could use some improvement.

Delicious muffin! It should be known, that I always rate based on how well the recipe does being transformed to GLUTEN FREE! These held up pretty good considering. I did a lot of similar alterations like other users, less sugar, less honey, less yogourt, less oil, more applesauce, only zucchini, no carrots, etc. I think the only reason I couldn't rate them five stars is that they should NOT go in liners. They were very good, but not oily/fattening enough to come out of a liner. I will definitely make these again though, this time with greases tins instead :)

These muffins are very moist and satisfying. They did have an odd conus top though. Here are the changes I've made. I used non-fat greek yogurt, replaced 1/4c of honey with agave syrup, didn't put white sugar or raisins at all. Since I like my muffins on a bigger side, I ended up with only 19 of them. But they still cooked in 20 minutes. The muffins that were baked without the liners got stuck in the pan. This is the only reason I give them 4 stars. I will be making these again. Thanks!

I changed around a couple things in this recipe to make it a little healthier and to come out with a tastier outcome. I used all whole wheat flour instead of half wheat/half white, I upped the baking soda/baking powder to a teaspoon each, I upped the nutmeg to a half teaspoon, I used two full organic eggs, an extra 1/4 cup of homemade organic applesauce instead of vegetable oil (I'm low on vegetable oil), I used Nancy's organic nonfat yogurt, and I increased the zucchini to a full cup and the raisins to a half cup. (We like really loaded muffins.) Increasing the applesauce gave it even more flavor without adding a lot of fat and the moisture in this muffin was really out of this world. Wisking together your dry ingredients and then folding in all the combined wet really made for the best texture. These turned out really good and smelled amazing while baking.

Delicious muffins.  I used 3 cups at least of zucchini and no carrot.  unfortunately had no applesauce and used butter instead.  Next time I will leave chunks of zucchini.

Wow!  These are wonderful.  I used 1 cup each of all three kinds of flour.  I didn't have Oat Flour, so I just put oats in the food processor and ground them down as course as I wanted. They are just barely gone and I already want to make more.  :)

I love this recipe.  Not sure how you can prep it in 15 min as it takes me about 45 min to put it all together.  I half the sugar as it is too sweet.  I use 1/4 c oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  These also freeze well.  Thank you!!

removed the sugar and replaced oil with ground flaxseed.  Very healthy but didn't taste like health food.  Moist.

This recipe is so versatile.  IT is delicious as written, but can be changed if you run out of ingredients.  I have made it several times using Oat instead of Oat Bran, 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar, milk or sour cream for yogurt, and egg whites instead of eggs.  We always have a ton of frozen zucchini from our summer garden.  I upped the zucchini to 2 cups and left out carrots.  This was a fantastic way to go use up our harvest.  Thanks so much for the recipe.  My 4 year old loves it!

I gave this recipe 4 stars becuase of the few changes I made, but they're very good.  I used half whole wheat flour half white.  I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and they were plenty sweet (I still used the 3/4 of honey).  I added blueberries instead of nuts or raisins.  They were a hit with all my kids and my husband.

We love this recipe. As a previous reviewer said, too much sugar though. I cut out the sugar and added a little more honey. I kept the oats whole and added dried cranberries and doubled the vegies. We have this recipe every few weeks and a batch never lasts more than two or three days. Great way to sneak in vegetables and made as a mini-muffin, perfect for snacking.

These muffins rose beautifully, looked and smelled great. I cut out the white sugar and just used the honey because so many people said they were too sweet - but that gave me a result not sweet enough. Next time I will try 1/2 c brown sugar. I want more flavor from the veggies too, but this is a great base recipe that I'll have fun playing with. Mine were done perfectly after 18 minutes at 375.

Very moist!  I substituted apricot/mango fruit at the bottom yogurt for the plain yogurt and cut back a little on the sugar.  I think the temperature was a little hot so next time I would back it down to 375.

Yuck!  What a disappointment!  These came out a gloppy mess, which I suspected they might based on the ratio of wet to dry ingredients.  I even squeezed out the zucchini first.  Simply awful; I threw the whole batch into the yard for the birds.  Try the apple carrot muffins on this site instead.

I love this recipe! My children hate vegetables, so I actually pureed half a zucchini and a cup of carrots with the wet ingredients. The muffins were yummy, and there was no "green & orange" to be seen! Fantastic!

Glad I read the review mentioning to cut the amount of sugar in half, as well as that its OK to use oats put through the blender in place of oat flour.  Made for school lunches, so omitted nuts, and changed raisins for chocolate chips.  Very moist and healthy - I will make again!

My picky eater even liked these!  Added 1/2 cup flax, no white sugar, used 1/2 cup honey and 1/2 cup maple syrup for sweetness. 1/4 cup oil was enough. Added an extra cup of zucchini.  Left out the nutmeg.

"Great!" said my son. I made a chocolate version for my anti-veggie kids (almost 9 & 11). I added 1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa some chocolate chips. Since I was adding the chocolate chips, I dropped the honey down to 1/2 cup and also the sugar to 1/2 cup as indicated by the author in a post. I also reduced the cinnamon to 1 tsp due to the cocoa addition - I wanted the cinnamon to enhance the cocoa, not overpower it. For the yogurt, I used half plain and half fat free vanilla Greek yogurt just because I had both on hand and wanted to up the protein even more. Love that this recipe has good grains, veggies and protein. I didn't add nuts or raisins.

I added maple granola instead of oat flour and honey flavored yogurt instead of the honey.  Having no zucchini on hand, I used part of a bag of salad spinach that I had in the freezer that I crumbled.  The spinach gave the muffins more color but did not add any distinct spinach flavor.  My 4 and 2 year old loved these.  I thought they were nice as a snack or meal accompaniment.  They were definitely dense and hearty.

Really good! but also a lot of ingredients/work. . . 

I left out the nuts and raisins but otherwise made the recipe pretty much as written. 

A few minor adaptations:

almost all wheat flour
decrease to 1/2 cup sugar
decreased to 1/2 cup honey
old fashioned oats (instead of oat flour)
increased to 1 cup zucchini

If I made these again, I'd increase the spices and vanilla a bit and add more shredded zucchini and carrots. *Or substitute chopped apples for the veggies! Or experiment with flavored yogurts and fruit (no veggies).

Overall, delicious and moist:)

I replaced the oat flour with all whole wheat because I didn't have any oat flour on hand, substituted Splenda for sugar, increased the yogurt by 50% (using plain Greek yogurt for the protein boost), increased the pecans and raisins by about a quarter, added a teaspoon of almond extract, and added 1/4 tsp each of ground cloves and ground ginger. I also added an extra egg because I am cooking at a high altitude. Although I can't say this review is entirely fair since I made some pretty substantial changes to the original recipe, I have to say that the end result is one of the very best muffins I have ever had and I will be making it regularly. I even used the full amount of sugar (or Splenda, in my case) that the recipe listed, and although it is sweet, it is not excessive. It's definitely a more indulgent tasting muffin, a little like carrot cake, but that's exactly what I was looking for. And with the sugar-substitute, it's still pretty low-calorie.

Really delicious, very very moist and great flavor! I used a very fine grate which was great because the texture of the vegtables was hidden from the little ones. Also used Greek yogurt and bakers joy spray it kept the muffins from sticking. I see that the recipe is revised to reduce sugar and squeeze the veggies will try that next time to keep it healthier but this review is awesome!!!

All four of my kids ate these including the two who hate fruits and veggies, thanks CARINAB!  I could not find oat flour at the store so I ground oatmeal in my dry Vitamix (high speed) blender and that worked fine.  I tried a couple alterations and decided that this recipe works best as written.

Yummmmm. Very delicious, my co-workers liked them too.  They had a good consistency, unlike other muffins I have made with apple sauce and yogurt to substitute. I used vanilla yogurt, honey and sugar.  I think I might experiment with less sugar next time.

Delish! I gave it 4 stars only bceause I made some changes based on previous reviews and on ingredients I had on hand.  I halved the sugar, honey, oil and cinnamon, used shredded sweet potato instead of carrot, and used a combo of low fat milk, vanilla yogurt, and lowfat sour cream in place of the plain yogurt. I also added about 1/4 cup each of ground flax seed and wheat germ, and used whole oats instead of oat flour. Lastly, I baked for 17 minutes at 400.  The result is a delicious, moist, healthy muffin that both my 3 year old and 1 year old gobbled down.  And my husband and I loved them too.  A keeper!

Super moist and yummy.  I didn't have enough honey so I used some Agave too.  I also added a bit of cardamom just cause I love it.  I also made sure I halved the sugar and drained the zucchini and carrots like the other comments said.  They came out great and my 3 year old can't get enough of them!

Absolutely fantastic! I can't stop eating them, they're so good! I didn't have quite a full cup of zucchini so I used more carrot. Also didn't have the other types of flour so I used 1 cup self-raising and 1 cup of porridge oats. No applesauce either so I just used 1 cup oil. I didn't add honey and I used walnuts instead of pecans. They are absolutely perfect though. I will definitely make these again... and again, and again!

Delicious but a little sweeter than I was expecting. I cut down a bit on the honey too. I used all zucchini and raisins. Because my muffins tend to go soggy on me I made sure to drain the zucchini after grating it. Great texture with all the different flours in there; I didn't have oat flour but ground up some whole oatmeal. Next time maybe a bit less honey. UPDATE: Made these again, used whole quick oats, otherwise per recipe. Yummy!

Super duper moist.  My picky toddler ate 3 today.  My husband thought they needed more flavor, but what does he know.  Kid approved!  I also cut the sugar & honey by half, FYI, as I used sweetened yogurt.

So I just tried this and my 3 year old LOVES them. They are very moist and hearty. The only changes I made were to substitute regular oats and wheat germ for the oat flour and to lower the sugar to 1/4 cup. They are DELICIOUS. I only made 12 and put the rest of the batter in a mini loaf pan and cooked for an additional 20 minutes. Great recipe.

I prepared as written with 1/2 C sugar.  Very good but too moist, will probably cut out the oil next time.  Kids loved them so I am thrilled to be sneaking in carrots and zucchini!

These were fantastic.  I followed the recipe. except- 3 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  Topping them with raisins and chopped pecans make them look irresistable!! Thank you.  I will make these again again!!

I ended up soaking the grains with applesauce (I used more applesauce instead of oil), carrots, yogurt, and zucchini the night before.  Then the next day I put the eggs and honey together and whipped until fluffy (I left the sugar out completely and we did not miss it), then added the remaining ingredients minus the baking soda/powder. I added the baking soda/powder and let sit for 5-10 minutes. I was not able to get 24 muffins from the recipe. Instead I ended up with only 18. They were nice and fluffy and so moist.  We will be adding this to our favorites for sure.

I've made these muffins once before but they were flatter. This time I put the zucchini and carrot (after squeezed) in the wet mixture first, then mixed it very lightly into the dry mixture. Overmixing is my fall! :)Also this time, for the flours I did just 1 1/2 c All Purpose and 1 1/2 c wheat flour. I subbed all of the oil for applesauce (making 1 c), cut the honey to 1/2c, did 1 1/2 c zucchini, 1/2 c carrot and 1/2 c chopped walnuts and 1/2 c dried apricots (do not chop too small). They turned out great! I made 1/2 of the batch into a loaf which took a bit longer to bake. Next time I'll omit the white sugar completely.

I've been looking for ways to sneak in extra protein & vegetables into my picky toddlers diet.  These did the trick!  Some changes I made--
1) replaced all flour with 1 part wheat germ & 1 part multigrain pastry flour (A trick that I learned from "The Sneaky Chef");
2) I used pear sauce (didn't have apple on hand);
3)Omitted the honey & used 1/2 cup sugar;
4) Used sweet potato instead of carrots. 

This recipe made 24 mini & 12 reg size muffins.

Big thumbs up from my husband and toddler.  The first time I made it, I felt it didn't have enough veggies, so the 2nd time, I almost doubled the veggies, and the result was still a good consistency.  I also eliminated the white flour, and used 1 cup of a very fine wheat flour and 1/4 cup of quick oats (whole, not ground into flour), and that worked ok as well.  I was out of plain yogurt, and substituted peach yogurt (that has sugar in it) and skipped the white sugar.  I found that with mini-loaf pans, the cooking time was about 30-35 minutes, and I had to turn the heat down to 375 avoid burning the crust.  The flavor is a little bland for my taste -- next time, I plan to use more cinnamon, and perhaps brown sugar instead of the white sugar and honey.

I used all whole wheat flour and for the oat flour I simply used quick cooking oats. I left out the nutmeg oil and used extra cinnamon and applesauce. Instead of white sugar, I used brown, but I still added the honey. These muffins were good, but too sweet for my taste...I should have left out the sugar all together and only used the honey. I also added extra pecans and golden raisins (they were on sale). Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly except for subsituting whole wheat flour for the oat flour (didn't have any). I also squeezed out the water from the shredded zucchini and didn't add nuts or raisins. The muffins turned out delicious! Thank you!

Great recipe.  My preschoolers love them.  I remove most of the white sugar, which didn't seem to matter to them at all, and sometimes leave out the raisins too.  (We make other muffins with raisins.)  Just make sure to drain the zucchini as well as you can.  Otherwise there's too much liquid and they don't rise properly.

I made these for my very picky, "vegetable-phobic" 5 year old.  He loved them!  I peeled the zucchini so he didn't see anything "green" inside.  Used half the amount of honey, and half cup of carrots (so not too much "orange" inside!).  For me, this recipe made 24 "cupcake sized muffins and aslo 22 bite sized "mini-muffins".  He ate them and asked for more!  They'll be great in his lunchbox!

When I found this recipe, I thought it might be just what I was looking for.  I love all the fruits and veggies in it.  I used barley instead of oats, a brown rice flour mixture with tapioca,potato, and xanthan gum for the wheat flour, and brown rice syrup in place of the honey and they still turned out delicious.  If you are looking for a muffin that's not too sweet to eat for a snack or meal, try this one.  I don't think you could go wrong.

I used all wheat flour since I had no oat flour.  I subbed eggs for egg beaters, the sugar for Splenda and all of the oil for applesauce and they still turned out fantastic and healthy.  I've made them three times now and they disappear in less than 24 hours, my toddlers and hubby love these, thanks!!

Moist deliciousness :) I mostly followed the recipe :) - modifications made : didn't have oat flour subbed instant oatmeal packet, no sugar but increased honey by 1/4c, eggs were small (fresh from the chicken) so I added an extra- used homemade apple-pearsauce since I had just made some (it was agave sweetened and had cinnamon already in it), I used pumpkin pie spice instead of cinnamon , cut the oil by 1/2 and used vanilla nonfat Greek yogurt since that's what I had and all zucchini since I had no carrots - ok so I did make a few changes :) I also omitted the nuts and raisins out of laziness :) this is my new go-to muffin recipe! Thanks for the inspiration. :)

These came out delicious.  What I did different: I used 3c. of only AP flour because it's all I had. I left out the raisins and nuts because I didn't have any I wanted to use.  I left out all the sugar but used the 1/2c. honey.  I upped the carrots to about 1 1/2 c. I added about 1/2-3/4 c. of dried apples. Oh and I made only 18 muffins, not 24. Mine were kinda big.
So wonderful.

These are delicious! I used all whole wheat flour, omitted the vegetable oil and instead used 1 cup of applesauce, and I didn't have oat flour so I used oats instead. They were so moist. Will definitely be making these again!

Loved this!  Used it for my almost 1 year-old son.  I used the recipe to make two different kinds, half and half.  I mixed the dry ingredients together into two separate bowls (half whole wheat flour and half baby oatmeal).  Mixed the wet ingredients into one bowl and poured half into each of the dry bowls (no honey, 1/2 c brown sugar, vanilla yogurt).  It worked out to about 1 1/2 cups of liquid each for me.  In one mix, I added the zest and juice from one orange and a handful of chopped dried cranberries.  Added a little apple juice to make the batter the right consistency.  In the other mix, I added one medium zucchini, medium carrot, and small apple (all shredded) and a little apple-carrot juice.  The zucchini batch took a little longer to bake.  Both batches turned out DELICIOUS and my son gobbled them right up!  Can't wait to make them again for him!  Thanks for a great breakfast recipe!

These were excellent. It was a bit labor intensive to make but worth it for a different type of muffin/cupcake. On that note, these reminded me more of cupcakes so I made the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe by Janni (cut the recipe to 1/4, which was perfect amount, and put in a bowl on side for people to choose).  I didn't have the applesauce so I omitted it altogether. I used vanilla yogurt because that's what I had on hand. As other suggested I wanted to sweat the zucchinni to take out the excess liquid but was afraid (don't know much about this process) use salt for sweating with this being a baked item, so I squeezed out the zucchinni liquid with used my hands and papertowel and that did the trick. I had a regular size muffin pan and the 18 mins was a bit too much time (still very edible and delicious, will do less time in future). I also had a mini muffin pan that I used and baked for 9 min. The minis came out perfect. Thanks for the great recipe. Will make again.

Just ok, nice and moist but not sweet enough I only put half the sugar based on other reviews that used half or none and used 3/4C spelt flour instead of wholemeal.

Not sure what happened to mine!  I didn't have carrots so I left them out and doubled the zucchini portion.  No nuts, so didn't use them or raisins.  Otherwise, followed exactly and even used homemade yogurt.  I also used pumpkin pie spice since I did not have pure nutmeg.  They rose nicely then fell as soon as I took them from the oven.  After the first batch, I added another tsp of baking powder and a bit more flour along with some chocolate chips and VIOLA!  Yummo.  not sure I will make again given my issues with the first batch, but my kids are enjoying them even flattened.

I was afraid they wouldn't bake, the batter was so liquid.  But they did.  I added too much zucchini, so ended up with 30 regular sized muffins and a whole pan of mini muffins too.  They are delicious!  I did substitute 1/4 cup of flaxseed for 1/4 cup of the white flour.  Will probably reduce the sugar next time, although I used 1/2 brown sugar, and 1/2 white sugar for the 1 cup white sugar called for.

I thought these muffins were delicious and they were super moist.I did reduce the sugar to a half cup after reading that was what it was originally supposed to be.Other than that I followed the recipe and I think it's delicious as is.I'm sure I'll be making these again soon.

I love these they are very sweet and moist. I shared them with family and co-workers who also seemed to like them. The only down side is there are so many ingd. so it takes some time to make them.

Absolutely fabulous!  I needed to make some cupcakes for a function at my daughter's school, & they ask the parents to follow the Canada Nutrition Food Guide, so I thought zucchini cupcakes would be the way to go.  I used homemade yoghurt, left out nuts because of allergy issues, & topped with some creamcheese frosting I had left over in the freezer.  The kids were crazy for them!  Thanks so much, they  had no idea they were eating healthy!

I baked these for almost twenty minutes longer than directed and they were still wet in the middle. I think it was the addition of the yogurt - the grated carrots and zucchini had quite a bit of moisture in them. The flavor is extremely delicious, though - next time I will use more flour to make up for that.

Delicious! I was looking for a healthy and tasty snack to make for my toddler and this fit the bill. I didn't have oat flour so I used rolled oats and I used about half the sugar since I ran out. They were moist and very tasty!

Great recipe.   Easy to follow.   Instead of a full cup of white sugar I used 1/2 cup of golden sugar and a little more honey.  I've mad it twice and it's only made 18 muffins both times.

This recipe is great...I made it just as posted (including only using 1/2 cup sugar as later added) and they came out great!  My kids think they're eating cupcakes not muffins with more than one kind of veggie in them.  :)

Great recipe.  I substituted oats for the oat flour and 1/2 cup shredded apples for the apple sauce and it worked great.

Made these for my little boy (14 month old) who is a picky eater.  As suggested, I cut the sugar in half-down to a half a cup.  He didn't even know he was eating such a healthy muffin!  Thank you and we will make these again...now if only I can keep them away from my husband next time.

oh my gosh.  i think these are GREAT! i did substitute bran for the oat flour.   and i used crushed pineapple i/o applesauce, as that's what my favorite carrot cake recipe calls for.  anyway, the results were fantastic.  i'll be making these again and often.

I loved these. They are flavorful & moist. I halved the recipe & got 12 good size muffins. I didn't have any applesauce, so I threw an apple in with the carrots & zucchini. I added just a tad bit more oil, but don't think they needed it. I added more WW Pastry flour because it look liked too much liquid. I only used WW Pastry, & Whole Wheat as the flours. I thought I had Oat flour, but only had oat bran, so I added some of that & some ground flax. Just a bit of Splenda, honey & Turbinado sugar. Used Craisins & lots of pecans. Very good, thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful!  My 21 month old ate it right away and he is so picky.  1) Cut back oil to 1/4 cup, cut sugar down to 1/2 cup, and used 1/2 cup honey.  2) Used all organic white whole wheat flour and organic everything else in the recipe.  3) Had no tool to get excess water out of zucchini so I put it in a ziploc baggy, cut a small hole in the bottom corner and squeezed the water out a few times.  4) Looked a little stiff so I added a bit more applesauce to make up for only putting in half the oil.  5) Cooked 12 muffins in a shallow silicone cupcake pan and had a lot of batter left over, almost 2/3rds left, so I baked the rest of the batter in a bundt pan.  6) Left out nuts and raisins in the muffins for my son but added chopped pecans to the rest of the batter for the adults.  Thanks for a toddler friendly recipe.  I wish I had cut back on the sugar more though since he actually ate it.  This is his first sweet type item he's ever eaten besides organic animal crackers.  I will freeze the extra muffins.

Well I overdid the zucchini by guesstimating rather than measuring, and I substituted fresh pineapple for the apple sauce, because apple sauce is not a standard item in this region. When the weight of all that wonderfully moist goodness prevented the muffins from rising to the occasion, I filled the dimpled domes with cream cheese frosting, so the end result was a muffin containing: zucchini, carrot, pineapple, lemon zest and just a tad of lemon juice along with wheat germ, oatmeal, and rasins. Can't feel too bad about dimples with all that packed in!! (My bad...not the recipe's fault). Very delicious.

Great recipe!  Changes, comments:  For ingredients, I omitted the oil, 1/2 c of the sugar, and the vanilla.  I used white wheat flour + oat flour, and vanilla yogurt (vanilla flavor + sugar already).  I also added 1 ripe banana (for the oil).  I didn't drain any of the veggies, and the muffins came out perfect, and weren't super sweet (yea!).  You could probably cut even more sugar and the muffins would be more like "dinner muffins" instead of "breakfast muffins."    BTW, my 1-year-old loves these.  Before she turned 1, I subbed brown sugar for the honey...she still loved them!  Thanks!

Recipe is great!  I doctored mine up by adding greek yogurt (it's all we had) - 6oz cup.  I cooked down two large apples (steamed with some apple juice), mashed up with a potato masher, and used that as my applesauce...came out to be 1 cup.  I used just the 3/4 c of honey.  I used 1 part white flour, 1 part wheat flour, and 1 part oat flour (made from oats ground up in the blender).  I added 1/2 c of raisins and 1/2 cup craisins (didn't have anymore raisins).  I didn't have any carrots so I didn't add them, either.  Preheated my oven to 450, turned down immediately when I put them in, made the muffins rise with the little domes on them (like you see in the bakeries).  My husband LOVES these...no oil, no refined sugar, multigrain...these are a keeper!

These muffins are fantastic!  I made two changes:  instead of 2/3 cup of honey I used 1/3 cup, and instead of 1 cup of sugar I added only 2/3 cup.  You don't need all that sugar--they were perfectly sweet without it.  In fact, next time I think I'll try adding some sweetened applesauce and reducing the amount of table sugar even more.

Very moist and delicious!  Easy to modify based on what's in your cupboard/fridge.  I decreased the sugar and oil, increased the applesauce, used rolled oats in place of oat flour, added several large scoops of ground flax, and used golden raisins.

Good - They turned out a bit moister in the middle than muffins I make normally come out - even after I cooked them for longer than stated. But I think they're good like that, anyways. :)

We can't get enough of this!  I use about half the white sugar, sometimes none at all.  I also add oatmeal, flax seeds & ground flax, maybe a quarter cup each (I don't measure, I just use what looks right).  My kids beg for these, and so does my grown neighbor. :)

My toddler LOVES these!  Such a great way to get vegetables into her.  I made some of the adjustments others suggested (1/2 ap flour/1/2 ww) doubled the applesauce and omited the oil. Omited the sugar and the taste is perfect.  They are a little spoungey but that makes them perfect for my little one. I made mini muffins and cooked them for 15 minutes and that worked well.

I used all whole wheat flour instead of white and used oatmeal in place of oat flour.  I cut the oil to 1/4 cup and added 1/2 cup ground flax seed.  I also cut out the sugar completely.  The muffins were moist and yummy.  Straight out of the oven it tasted a little weird... I thought, "I should have added the sugar."  BUT once it cooled down completely, it tasted so much better!  I don't think I'll add sugar next time around.

This is TOO sweet! No wonder the kids like it! :-/ It had a lot of ingredients, and I was expecting a better overall result. It was a little doughy after baking at 400 degrees for 20 min. Maybe my vegggies were too juicy! Overall, I won't make it again, and I will try something simpler rather than modifying.

Seriously good.  My 7 yr.old picky eater just came in and said, "Those are some good healthy snacks!"  I wouldn't tell the kids what is in the recipe until they tried them.  Wow, they just love them.  I used 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup splenda for sweeteners.  I put 1 cup of old fashioned oatmeal in my little chopper to make the oat flour.  This is a super recipe!!  THANKS!!

These are delicious! I used vanilla yogurt and cinnamon flavored applesauce because that is what I had, so I omitted the white sugar (but still used the honey). Perfect amount of sweetness! I also added some dried cranberries, which go really well in these muffins! I think next time I will do a cup of dried cranberries and raisins (I like golden raisins) and maybe some other dried fruits, too (apricot?). I also may add more shredded carrots and omit the pecans. Thank you, this recipe is really fun to play with!

Awesome! I made a few adjustments to suit what I had on hand and general preferences and these came out delicious (and the kiddies ate them up!). Used brown sugar, maple syrup, and honey to sweeten the batter (no white sugar)and put whole oats in since I didn't have oat flour. I'm trying to finish up what's left of my white flour but next time I will try w/ just wheat flour and oats. Had no apple sauce but the batter tasted fabulous without it so I don't think I'll add it next time. Also used lemon flavored yogurt instead of plain for a twist but I bet vanilla flavor would be divine too! I used shredded zucchini and carrot and added some dried cranberries. Thanks for the recipe. It's wonderful!

Finally a "healthy" muffin that I'd eat myself and feed my toddler.  I made it with maple syrup instead of honey because I have an under two year old, and 1/2 cup sugar as suggested and it was great.  It works well with any shredded fruit: apple, banana, zucchini, carrot, etc.

These turned out great! I made LOTS of changes, though!! I used a combo of oat flour, whole wheat flour & wheat bran. Used less Splenda, applesauce (didn't use oil) & yogurt (used vanilla). I didn't even bother with the honey. Instead of zucchini, I had ripe banana to use up, which is why I used less yogurt & applesauce since bananas added moisture. I added some unsweetened coconut, too. They rose nicely & baked well, too. Very moist, too! Will try the zucchini next time.

I used 1 cup each of all purpose and wheat flours, 1/2 cup oat bran and 1/2 cup of ground flax. I used french vanilla yogurt, virgin coconut oil, 3/4 cup of brown sugar, 1/2 cup of honey, 3/4 cup of raisins soaked in boiling water and double the carrots and zuchini. I added a pinch of cloves and ginger. They are delicious and  nutritious, thanks for sharing! There will be some of these in my freezer from now on.

I made these to take for snack to my kids' Montessori school. Lovely moist texture, great flavor, better the day after baking then the day of. I used vanilla yogurt and all zucchini, omitted nuts and raisins. I doubled the recipe and it fit great in my 6 qt KA Mixer. 
The only complaint I have is that I found 400 to agressive of a temperature- the bottoms were burning. I turned the oven down to 365 and they were perfect.

I really enjoy these muffins.  I don't have oat flour so I have taken regular oats and put them in a food processor to grind them a bit, this seemed to work well.  
I found the recipe as written too sweet for my taste.  Just made them today, with 3/4c of honey and 1/4 cup of white sugar, this tastes just right.  Today I added about 2tbsp wheat germ.  Great with raisins or walnuts (or both, probably)
Thanks for the recipe.

Very good recipe!  My 2 girls (ages 7 and 3) loved them!  I changed the flours to 1 cup of each white, wheat and oat flour.  I am going to try to make them without white flour next time. I also used sour cream instead of yogurt, since we didn't have any.  Thanks for sharing!!!

Very good and healthy too!!  Everyone like them and they freeze well.  I made them without the oat flour and  used whole wheat because that's what I had.

These are absolutely delicious, and have such a fantastic texture.  I halved the recipe, and made a few changes -- used 3/4 whole wheat, 3/4 all-purpose, and no oat-flour.  Also, added a bit more carrot, 1/3 chopped candied ginger, and blueberries.  Oh my goodness, they're the perfect muffin.  With the little additions, they're definitely a five.  Great, versatile recipe!

What a great idea! My 2-year-old son loves these! I didn't have any oat flour, so I ran some in my food processor until they were a flour-like consistency. These freeze well, too!

Majorly delicious...and my super-picky toddler devoured them, too!  I didn't have oat flour and couldn't find it at my grocery store, so I just used half reg flour and half wheat flour...I'm also not a huge fan of vegetable oil, so I used olive oil...  I really can't say it enough...these were fabulous and I'll definitely make them again!

These are very good.  I didn't have any zucchini so I just doubled the carrots.  I haven't given them to my daughter yet, as they have honey in them, but my husband and I both like them.  Thanks for the healthy and tasty recipe.

Excellent for kids, not too sweet.  I didn't have oat or whole wheat flour so I ground up some instant oats and used ground flax instead, and they turned out perfectly.  Will make again.

My toddler didn't think they were all that...but I sure did!  Yum yum!  I think over the course of a couple weeks I ate the entire batch!  I bought some cinnamon whipped butter and when you use it to top these muffins...nothing could be better!  Thanks so much for giving a good for you recipe for muffins!  Maybe in a few months I will try them on my toddler again.  :o)

Very forgiving recipe! As long as liquid and dry amounts equal what the recipe calls for, it works. I subbed all yogurt instead of yogurt AND applesauce, spelt flour for ww and reg flour, wheat for oat bran, added molasses when I didnâ€™t have enough honey, all zucchini when I didnâ€™t have carrots. Reduced sugar a lot.  Turned out delicious every time. New favourite muffin recipe!

I read so many 'changes' to this recipe I couldn't keep them all straight, so I winged it - and baked 2 loaves @ 350*.  They were amazing.  I put in less sugar, thru in 1/4 cup Oat Bran instead of Oat Flour and used all zucchini.  I think this bread/muffin recipe will be amazing no matter what changes you make as long as you keep the overall liquid the same.  Thanks for sharing ! ! !

This is a tried and true recipe for me! I've been making these for my daughter for years, and I just love them because they're almost like a little meal in a muffin - there's protein, whole grains, veggies...such an easy-to-grab healthy snack. I make sure to use whole milk yogurt so we get as much protein as possible. I also ONLY use the 3/4 C of honey, and none of the granulated sugar, and it's plenty sweet for my daughter. I make sure to squeeze as much excess water out of the carrots and zucchini as possible. Otherwise everything works out fine following the recipe - I love it!

Yea!  I have finally found a healthy muffin that tastes good!  My substitutions were:
Almond flour (for wheat flour)
Quick oats (I didn't even grind them up)
Gluten free flour (for regular flour)
Spenda (for regular sugar)
Olive oil (for regular oil)
Didn't have applesauce but they were moist!
Then I did just a bit over a cup for both carrots and zucchini
Walnuts instead of pecans
Thank you for a great recipe!!!!

I changed just a couple things. Instead of carrots I used two cups zucchini. Cut the Oil in half. Used a stevia / sugar mix and cut the sugar in half. I used 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat white flour and 1 1/2 cups of oat flour. Lowered the temperature to 290* and baked for 18 minutes. After a few different attempts this seems to work the best.

Great muffins, but the consistency is more of a cupcake due to sifting the dry ingredients. Might try without sifting next time.

Yumm. Used honey vanilla yogurt, so cut back on honey and vanilla. Halved the sugar, as per original poster's comment . Skipped the nuts and raisins, due to allergy and preference. Super!

I left out the sugar and used 1/2 flour-1/2 oat flour...I also substituted coconut oil and added raisins and chopped pecans.  Cannot believe how moist it is.  Oh, and I made bread instead of muffins.

With the decrease in sugar from 1 cup to 1/2 cup, these muffins are spectacular.  Light, fluffy, and the perfect amount of sweetness!

Loved this recipe and my son loves it too! He ate 3 of them that day. It was very moist and flavourful. I used whole wheat flour with flax in place of the white flour and only added raisins. Will definitely be making this again!

These were incredible! Toddler and adult approved. I used melted butter in place of the vegetable oil, crushed pineapple in place of the applesauce since it's what I had on hand, and put quick cook oats in my ninja to make the oat flour. Are used to only 1/2 cup sugar as suggested by others. I grated the carrot and zucchini super fine. These will be a staple go to from now on.

These were really good. I did not add sugar and honey, only sugar. Also, I did not add nuts, at my daughters request. I will definitely make again.

Made again. This time used Vanilla Greek yogurt and accidentally used 2 tbsp of vanilla instead of 2tsps. Delicious!!

These came out really great! My toddler granddaughter loved them. I used a little less sugar, but  as Carinab stated, it was still a little too sweet, so I'll reduce next time to 1/2 cup.  I changed it just a bit. Added one extra egg, 2 TBSP Shaklee Instant Protein for more protein. Also substituted 1/2 banana for the applesauce since I didn't have that ingredient.  I like that the recipe was forgiving of a few changes and came so moist and tasty. Definitely a keeper!

LOVED it. I used fresh ground golden wheat instead of the white/wheat mix and it was absolutely perfect. The number of wet ingredients including fruit and veggies gives it lots of flavor dimensions.

Really delicious!  I also upped the amount of zucchini, omited the sugar completely and added about 2/3 cup of flax meal. So nice!!  Next time will double the nuts and raisins too. Will be making regularly and keeping in the freezer. My 14 month old also really likes it.

This recipe is really good! I modified the recipe to make it more healthier. I just cut the sugar.  This resulted in the muffins being very flavorful, and quite moist.

These were very delicious. Wonderful flavour and moist.    I didn't have any carrots so I doubled the zucchini.  I didn't add any sugar just 2 tbsp of stevia.    I will definitely make these again and again.

I keep coming back to this one! Always great. 1/2 & 1/2 sugar and Splenda (we like a sweet muffin), and if i grated a wee bit extra veggies (squeezed!), throw 'em in. Yummy yum yum. Thanks.

Didn't have yogurt so I used buttermilk. Should have squeezed the zucchini to get moisture out because the muffins were wet in the middle. Not raw, just wet. They were better when they were completely cooled. I used two cups of zucchini because I didn't have any carrots. Also I only used 1/2 a cup of sugar. It's a good thing I heaped the spices or I think the flavor would have been lacking. I liked the addition of the pecans. Will definitely make again.

My picky daughter loves these - I omitted the sugar altogether and added a bit more honey, as well as wheat germ and ground chia seeds. I also lowered the oven temp to 375 and in 18 minutes they were perfect. For my picky eater i use the food processor to grate half the veggies and blend the other half.

Enjoyed this recipe but I tailored to my taste so I used honey and brown sugar,  I also used all apple sauce no oil and they were light and fluffy and my kids enjoyed.  I will be trying with fresh orange combined with the applesauce next.

The texture is terrible, mushy.  The muffins are flat.  The taste is a very strong honey flavor.  In my kitchen, it was an experiment gone very wrong.

I changed up the ingredients a bit as well.  I used 1.5 cup whole wheat flour instead of white, .5 cup unbleached flour, .5 cup oat flour, .5 C ground flax to come up with the same measured ww flour and oat flour called for, .5 C of coconut oil instead of veg. oil,  .5 C honey, .25 C Agave syrup (because i had it in the house) and cut out the sugar completely - used all other ingredients.  Muffins turned out amazing!!  Healthy and delicious!  Thank you.

I really liked the flavor of these muffins but I had some issues with the recipe.  First of all, don't fold in the zucchini.  Just mix it with your Kitchen Aid.  When I folded the zucchini, it clumped and made wet spots in the muffins.  I would also eliminate the oil altogether and just use 1/2 cup applesauce.  I also had to bake these for 30 minutes to dry them out.  I would experiment with these again because I like all the healthy add ins.

I made these as written with the 1/2 cup sugar/ 3/4 c honey as the original submitter said.
They are very moist and taste good and are NOT AT ALL sweet!
I think they could do with a bit more spice and I would even add a bit more sugar or honey. Zucchini is very bland and needs all the oomph it can get

I made the recipe with the author's revision to what the site posted (1/2 cup of sugar, not 1 cup) and they turned out amazing! Our 4 year old has no clue she is eating veggies and fruit - zucchini, carrots, apple(sauce), and raisins. I decreased the oil and replaced with more applesauce. Thanks for this winner recipe!

This recipe is fantastic! I used all whole wheat flour (3 cups total) . I cut out the oil and instead used 1 cup of applesauce. I omitted the honey and replaced the 1 cup white sugar with 1/2 cup of truvia baking blend. I doubled the cinnamon and the vanilla because I love both so much : ) This time I also only used zucchini (~2 cups chopped/shredded in the food processor and then drained) but next time want to try it with carrots. They turned out delicious and makes the whole house smell fantastic! Thanks for the great recipe : )

It did serve the purpose of cleaning out the fridge, but that's pretty much it.  It was boring and tasted just OK.  If you don't already have those leftover ingredients, I wouldn't go out of my way to get each of them because this recipe uses quite some different things.  You would get an outcome that tastes similar with way fewer ingredients.

I really like this recipe. I ground my own wheat flour and oat flour. I didn't have applesauce so I put an apple with a quarter of a VERY ripe pineapple and blended that together for my applesauce. I only gave them a four star as even though my son said they were awesome, he also said he would have like to have cinnamon in them. I told him there was two teaspoons inn them. I have to agree with him as I could hardly taste the cinnamon too. Otherwise, great recipe.

Awesome muffins, big batch, which I will freeze for grab and go breakfasts.  Used 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 cup honey. Perfect amount of sweetness for me along with the raisins but others might prefer a bit more sweetness.  Next time I plan to add in a shredded apple and cranberries and some orange zest.  I used a large hole shredder for my zucchini and pressed out very little water, I won't bother getting the potatoe ricer dirty next time.

These are the best muffins--I followed the recipe completely and froze half. The fresh muffins are amazing; after thawing the second half were delicious too, though a bit dry (this could have been how I store them).

Note: I modified the recipe based on what I had on hand, but my family loved it. 
I used 1 cup each of All-purpose flour, Almond meal, rolled oats, 1/2 cup all bran cereal. I omitted the white sugar as others suggested and used 1/2 cup honey and 1/4 cup maple syrup. I drained the water from the zucchini and used butternut squash instead of carrots. I also added one banana. I didn't add pecans or raisins (but would if my kids would eat them)instead added 2 Tablespoons of flax seed. Instead of nutmeg I used pumpkin pie spice.  I baked them for 13 minutes in mini muffin tins. Taste was great. They were just a little too moist (muffin tops deflated after pulling from oven) the same day - likely because of both the butternut squash and banana - but we will see how they are after a night in the fridge...

Loved these!  Thy turned out great.  I even had some modifications due to not having all ingredients.  I didn't have applesauce so used extra yogurt, used oats instead of oat flour and didn't have honey, so used agave.  Overall, they were great; will keep in my recipe box.

5 stars! These were so moist and delicious. They are a bit of extra work with all the ingredients but well worth it. I used butter milk instead of yogurt with great results!

These were amazing except that I WISH I had read the comments that the correct amount of sugar is 1/2 cup. They would have been perfect with half as much sugar, and with added dates I will try 1/4 cup sugar.

Loved this recipe.  I didn't have oat flour on hand so I used Quaker Oat Bran instead.  I also don't buy applesauce (single gal, no kids) and didn't want to waste a whole jar of it so I found a single serving in the baby food isle that worked perfectly.  The muffins came out great--very moist and soft.  I will definitely made these again.

Awesome recipe. You can substitute just about anything since there are so many ingredients. I use only whole wheat flour, cut the sugar in half, sub half the oats for bran flakes, and since I dont really buy apple sauce, I switched it for a mashed banana and a handful of frozen raspberries or strawberries quick thawed so they're mushy. Excellent breakfast muffin!

This is a great recipe - my 4-year-old and 2-year-old kids couldn't stop eating these muffins!  I omitted the pecans, raisins, and sugar, and added more apple sauce, flax, and more veggies.  I'll be making these often, thanks for the recipe!!

These muffins are still on the wire rack and I can't wait to taste them!!  This is why I had to give only four stars.  Thank you everyone for the variations!  I have a toddler and like the idea of cutting the sugar. My husband has just started dieting and I think these will be a great snack for him as well.  MMMMMMMM they smell yummy!!

Love these.  So much flavor and mostly healthy.  Love them.  Share them with my friends all the time (well, during the summer when zucchini is in abundance).  I'll be making again next summer.

Not an overly sweet muffin, but nice flavor.  Great way to get a healthy start to the day.  I omitted the vegetable oil, decreased applesauce to 1/4 cup, omitted teh white sugar, drainged the zucchini well, added 1/2 cup ground flax seed and 2 Tbsp wheat germ.

wonderful! The only change I made was that I used 1/2 Splenda, 1/2 Sugar mix (to save on calories) and omitted raisins because the husband is a big baby and doesn't like raisins "in" things. Thanks for sharing...will make again.

Great recipe! Very moist and great flavor.I used only 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup honey and it was plenty sweet enough. I also ground 3/4 cup rolled oats in place of the oat flour and that worked just fine.  This recipe makes a lot! I made 12 jumbo muffins and a mini-loaf. Perfect for a family of 5!

Great Muffin! Great texture.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup per other recommendations, used oat bran instead of oat flour, and left out the applesauce b/c I didn't have any.  I topped the muffins with "Cinnamon Stove top Granola" from this site before baking.

Everyone loved them from my retired diabetic aunt to my 2 yr old. We made them right before a long road trip and we snacked on them. Chosen over chocolate bars.  We cut the raisins back and added cranraisins, which we prefer. I was very low on nuts so didnt have recommended amount. Still great. Nuts are personal preference anyway.

I think I did so many modifications to this that they didn't turn out as well as they could have. I used all whole-wheat flour, 3/4 sugar, and omitted the oil completely for applesauce. I drained the zucchini but not the carrots. They were a little to moist (which I didn't know was even possible). Will probably drain the carrots next time.  However, they had a good flavor. They weren't excessively sweet. My two year old loved them, as did my neighbor's 3 kids. Good way to sneak some veggies. Will probably make them again, but stick a little closer to the original recipe.

You can pretty much substitute anything and they still taste good. I used more applesauce instead of oil, a little less sugar, and added chocolate chips. It was a hit!

May be the best muffins I have ever made!  Some changes were that I used all whole wheat flour, quick cooking oats instead of oat flour, 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup honey, only 2 eggs & no applesauce.  They turned out perfectly.  Will make these over and over again!

These were pretty good!  I only gave 4 stars because they weren't big on flavour really, but they were healthy and they did taste pretty good.  My kids 5 and 2 1/2 ate them as well.  I did make some substitutions based on what other reviewers said:  I didn't have any oats or oat flour so I subbed 1/4 cup ground flax seed, wheat germ and cracked wheat.  I used 1/2 cup brown sugar (that may be why the flavour was lacking?), 1/2 cup honey and 1/4 cup molasses.  I also squeezed the zucchini.  Also, thank you to the reviewer who gave the tip about getting bigger tops on the muffins-I've tried and failed for years to get those big tops!!

I went to the grocery and bought some zucchini planning to make these muffins. When I got home, however, I realized I really didnt have everything I needed. So I didnt use any honey or nutmeg.  I used applesauce in place of the oil and the consistency was really nice.  I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain and hoped the muffins would be sweet enough. They weren't.  I tossed out the first batch and added more sugar to the second, which were better. Oh, I also didnt want to use carrots so I didnt. I'll definitely make this one again but stick closer to the recipe. I was surprised when my 18 month old ate them (like I said, they werent really that sweet) and he kept asking for more, more, more.  I also have not worked with zucchini before and wasnt sure whether to peel it or use the skin. I did half and half for not knowing. Can anyone else comment on whether they peeled the zucchini? Thanks!

I would give this 1000 stars however I had to mod it therefore I don't think 5 is fair!

I used 1c oats, 1c whole wheat flour, and 1 c flax meal instead of the listed flours.

Also used 1/2 c splenda brown sugar, 1/2 c splenda and no honey.

Also used 1c dannon light and fit vanilla instead of plain yogurt as that's all my store had.

DRAIN THE ZUCCHINI or you will have one wet mess.

They smelled fabulous and tasted even better!  Thank you for this awesome, healthy muffin.

Wonderful!  Very versatile recipe.  I used less white and more wheat.  Added bran flakes, wheat germ, pumpkin-flavored yogurt, less honey and they were great!  kids liked them too.  It's so nice to have a snack around you don't have to say "no" to for the kids.

These muffins are fantastic!  Hearty with just a little bit of sweetness.  Even my sugar-a-holic husband can't stop wolfing them down!  I make them regularly and have used just zucchini, just carrots, or both, and they always turn out great.  I have substitued molasses, evap cane juice, or raisin puree for the sugar and they taste just as good to me.

I eliminated the sugar and doubled the veggies and I would not do that again. I suggest doing one or  the other, but not both. I also did not add nuts or raisin, that may have helped.

These muffins were really good!  I made the following few changes I replaced the carrots with zucchini, I didn't have applesauce so I used a mashed banana instead and omitted the full amount of white sugar and I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain.  And that is the way I will always make them... they are so good!!!!!

This is a sure winner. Even my son could not believe they were healthy, they tasted that good.

These were great.  I added 1/4 of packed brown sugar and 3/4 cup of honey.  I thought they were a bit too sweet, and my boyfriend thought they needed to be sweeter.  Oh well...aside from that these are fantastic.  Left out carrots (I don't like carrot muffins/cake) and added about 2 cups of drained zucchini.  I also added a handful of walnuts and raisins.  Awesome!  I will be making these all the time

I really wanted to like this recipe (a much healthier alternative to other zucchini breads).  I noticed that this recipe called for too much sugar, so I only added 1/4 c of both sugar and honey. I found these muffins to be bland and had a slight soda taste.  Maybe, they need a little more sugar?

These were the best muffins ever!!!  The only thing I changed was to put 1 1/4 flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour.  The muffins came out sweet so next time I'll cut down on the sugar.  Not that being sweet is a bad thing:-)

I have a hard time getting my 2 year old to eat anything.  He just loves these muffins.  I used whole fat yogurt for added fat/calories and love the fact he gets some veggies in his diet.  These also freeze great, so I can make a big batch.

Great muffins.  I used the suggested ingredients including oat flour, but used 1/2 c evalporated cane juice sugar and just threw in the shreded zucchini and shredded salad carrots.  My teenager saw the carrots sticking out of the muffin pans and said "Yuck"!  However, she commented on the great smell as they were baking and gobbled one down as she was talking on the computer w/friends.  She said she'd be happy to have them for breakfast tomorrow. The muffins are moist, fluffy and tasty.

These were moist and delicious. My only adjustment was to use whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, and I didn't have oat flour so I use wheat bran. Also in 18 minutes they burned so be sure to check at about 15, these muffins burn easily

These were a little different than i expectd, but still very good.  I did also prefer them the next morning.  I only made half the batch, but they turned out very moist and flavorful.  A good way to use zucchini from the farmer's markets!

Only the best muffin I have ever eaten!  I never would have tried it had I not read the reviews of other cooks.  A midshipman who was here was hesitant to try it because she doesn't like zucchini -- but she loved them and took some back to the Naval Academy with her!  I will make them again and again.  I can't wait to make them for new people who move into the neighborhood!

Great, healthy muffin. Even my 18-month old loved them. Husband thought they were great. I did substitute olive oil in place of the vegetable oil (not a big fan of vegetable oil) and cut the sugar down to a half a cup. I didn't have oat flour so ground some rolled oats like another review did (added a little oat bran to the rolled oats). And did add a little ground flax seed. Didn't put the nuts in 'cz of my toddler. Everything else kept the same. If you want a good, healthy muffin I would really recommend these.

I, too, made these as healthy muffins for my toddler and was surprised at how great they tasted myself.  They were moist and flavorful (we used the nuts & raisins too) - packed with good stuff.  My husband saw the ingredients I was gathering and said "no thank you!" until he tasted the finished product!
