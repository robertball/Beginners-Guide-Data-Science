Easy, healthy, quick and incredibly tasty.  I used more shrimp and I also used chilean sea bass instead of the roughy, but it is good either way.  My son in law is a chef, made this as the special at his restaurant, and it was a great hit!

This was wonderful. I didn't change a thing. No one even suspected it was a"light" recipe. I served it with crusty bread.....very easy.....a keeper!

This was rated a "do-over" by my family, meaning "Make it again!" Next time, I would add more rice to make it a bit more substantial. Yum!

I reduce the sodium by making my own broth, and use fresh tomatoes. For a change, I touch it up with a bit of anise. Because it is a stew, I use whatever light flavoured seafood that I have.
