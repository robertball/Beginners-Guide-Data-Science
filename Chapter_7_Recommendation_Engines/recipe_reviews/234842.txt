Original review:  I followed the recipe exactly, including the cut of meat.   It resulted in a moist and tender roast that was very good, but not 5 star good.   I was worried that the balsamic would over power the entire dish, but with the long cooking time, it did not.   You could tell it was there and some of the flavor of that came through, but not too much.   If I was to make again, I would add in some carrots and celery and would cut the vinegar by half.  Update:   I raised this recipe to 5 stars based on the left-overs.   The left-overs are absolutely fantastic and I will probably make this again as written just for them.

I made this for Recipe Group. "Quick" and easy. I have to admit, I did not measure the seasonings. I browned the beef late and night and let it cook overnight, while I slept. In the morning, I shredded the beef, and placed it back in the crockpot, set to warm. My daughter and I ran an errand, and came back to have the roast for lunch with Mom. We love onion cooked with roast beef, so I added an extra onion. Wish I'd thought to add mushrooms! I liked this, but will probably stick with my usual method of cooking pot roast. Mom and daughter liked this VERY much, and split the leftovers, leaving me with none! I served it with a cucumber and onion salad, mashed sweet potatoes, and roasted brussels sprouts and cauliflower. A very enjoyable Sunday lunch!

Did not care for it. The Balsamic was too overpowering.

Made for Recipe Group. I used an English cut roast for this. Shredded it at the end of cooking time and put back in the juices(it was so tender it was falling apart). I made sandwiches with provolone and a nice sub bun. Good flavor, but lacking some extra zip in there for me. I added a little worcestershire, some more garlic powder and a little shake of hot sauce. Really easy recipe though, and the more onions the better! Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for Recipe Group. I have to say it was OK, but not good. I will probably not make again, and just stick with my other recipes for beef roasts.  I thought the vinegar was way overboard, and the rest was quite bland.  When it was finished I removed from the slow cooker and thickened the juice into a "gravy" then shredded the meat and returned to the slow cooker.  I made mashed potatoes and we ate it as an open-faced sandwich with corn on the side.  Hubby agreed he'd rather not have this again.

Absolutely delish! I wasn't too sure about this recipe at first with only balsamic & onion, but boy am I glad I gave it a try!! It's simple and so delicious! I also added a couple of sprigs of fresh Rosemary to the pot and then baby carrots at the last 30 minutes and they came out perfect! Serve with homemade mashed potatoes and you have an awesome dinner! Perfect for company too:)

We loved this roast, but we LOVE balsamic vinegar.  I made it as, is but next time will add more onion and probably close to a cup of vinegar for a bit more juice.  Served over mashed potatoes.  I would be great as a sandwich as well.  Great recipe without a lot of fat/sugar.

My family loved this,  didn't have any leftovers which I was hoping for. The one change I made, was adding minced garlic since I was out of garlic powder. We love garlic, so it wasn't any problem for us.

Recipe Group Selection for January 18, 2014 –  I like that this was an easy recipe, however I felt it was missing a little something.  I wish I had added more onions and added extra seasonings to bring it up a notch.

Absolutely delicious recipe! I followed the entire recipe but in the instant pot for 1 hour and it was falling apart.

This was ridiculously easy with an equally ridiculously delicious flavor!! Will be making this again.  The vinegar makes it very tangy but it’s not overly so at all.  (Note: the vinegar is a fairly pungent smell in the air.  I like the smell but wished I could have opened a window - was too chilly out to do so.)

I love this recipe and so does my husband.  I did add in a little extra balsamic (Red Apple Balsamic) and I used 1/2 yellow and 1/2 purple onion.  It is definitely a recipe I will make again.

I followed this recipe to a T. I loved it! I don't always want that "southern" roast taste. Second day we made sandwiches with the leftovers. I would make this again in a heartbeat. Thanks!

This recipe was great.  I added two extra ingredients.  First, I added onion powder to the rub.  Second, I added balsamic glaze to the vinegar.  It adds more flavour to the roast and, as a result, you don't get that strong vinegar taste as I read some people experienced.  Also, the gravy I made with the drippings was delicious!  Very easy recipe to do.   Thank you!!

I made this recipe but with a little beef broth and the exact amount of balsamic vinegar and used pearl onions. I feel it's  missing something, so I'm going to spruce up the gravy with some red wine and mushrooms.

This was very simple.  I have made it twice this month.  Both times cooked around 8 hours on low  in crock pots.  The meat fell off the bone.  Great  out of the pot & as leftovers.

Recipe Group Selection:  18, January 2014 ~ I was excited to try this recipe as I love the taste of balsamic vinegar. The results were just ok.  I would give the onions a 5-star rating as they were terrific.  I added carrots to the mix, and unfortunately the carrots soaked up all the taste of the vinegar and were inedible.  The meat was tender, but the flavor just wasn't there for us.  I will say, the leftovers the next day were better than the first time around.  Overall, not a bad recipe, just my favorite way to flavor a roast.

I made this for the AR Group. It was good and easy. I had modified some by using a bottom round roast and cooking slowly in a Dutch oven on the stove top. I don’t recommend using this cut for this recipe. I’ve cooked roast beef regularly for more than 20 yrs., so I’m sure it was the cut which is very lean and it did slice well and make good leftover sandwiches. It did not fall apart like a chuck will. 
All other ingredients and steps were followed as per recipe until I tasted the broth after it had cooked for 6 hrs. The broth was very tangy for us, so I added 1 tsp molasses because I thought a little sweetness might help and it did. The sauce was a dark deep rich color that I want to experiment with. I think next time I’ll definitely add minced garlic, mushrooms and carrots.
