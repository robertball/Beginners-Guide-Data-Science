Last time I made butter tarts not only was there sugar but also corn syrup. So I was happy to try these honey sweetened tarts. Honey was the predominant flavour but it was still buttery. One of those where you have a bite and say, "yup, that's a good tart but what's different?" I thought all butter tart batters were runny. This one was not so don't panic. I also just can't bring myself to eat raisins so I tried chopped walnuts instead. It was a good sub. Safe to say I'd make these again! Hubby gave them 4 stars,kids 4.5,I gave them a 5 and I win! Thanks KIM BOYLE!

I loved the idea of using honey in this recipe! They were super easy to make, and I followed the recipe exactly. I have more of a savoury palate, so to me they were way too sweet. For those like me, I would suggest to cut back the sugar and maybe add some nuts. My kids (who are adults) and friends thought they were only a little bit too sweet, but they loved them and gave two thumbs up nevertheless! Great, easy, yummy recipe Kim Boyle, thanks!!

Honestly im not a huge fan of butter tarts, but the moment i bit into one of these,I could not stop saying how good they were. I followed the recipe exactly as written, and i wouldn't change a thing about it. I did spray a measuring cup with a nonstick spray so the honey would slide out easily, and that is my only tip. Lemon zest might me a nice little touch in addition to the lemon juice. I would love to try these with some flavoured honey that you can buy from the Farmer's Market in the winter. This is a keeper! Thanks for the Recipe Kim! Whoops with the excitement of writing this review about these DELICIOUS Tarts, i forgot that i only ended up using 1 cup of Brown sugar, i though it would be sweet enough with the honey as well.
