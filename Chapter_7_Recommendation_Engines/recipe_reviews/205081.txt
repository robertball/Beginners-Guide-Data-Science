The original recipe is tasty--the sugar to cinnamon ratio was perfect--but I wouldn't make it again without the following modifications: 1 T olive oil, 0.5 teaspoon additional salt.

Someone gave me a bunch of almonds and I was trying to find something to do with them. Overall I liked this recipe. I used honey instead of white sugar and added olive oil (as suggested in a previous review). It wasn't quite creamy enough for me, but the flavor is great. I will make this again.
Maybe next time I will take out the cinnamon and add a little cocoa powder too it to make it a bit like Nutella.

when I made it, I too added oil (3 Tbs). When I make it again, I'll subsitute honey for the 3 tbs of white sugar. It was good to make.

I made it and loved it! I did add extra brown sugar and not as much white sugar.

I followed the recipe. It didn't taste good. Nobody would eat it. Tried to save it by adding different stuff,
