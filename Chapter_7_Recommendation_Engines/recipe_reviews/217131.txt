This is a very well balanced dressing. The taste of sesame rose slightly above the other flavors...yummy! I was particularly delighted that each ingredient is healthful (particularly if using organic miso to avoid GMO soy).  Try it, you'll like it!

Maybe it was my brand of miso (organic non-GMO) but contrary to the other reviewer mine was too miso overpowered and came out so thick. Delicate greens as suggested by the submitter would never have held up to the dressing as is without changes. I might make it again with less miso.

I made this as written, except that I used red miso, which added a little bit of a salty flavor. This dressing is delicious!
