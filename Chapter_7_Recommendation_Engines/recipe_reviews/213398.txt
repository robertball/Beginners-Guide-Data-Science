Nice basic potato soup. I used 12 oz. of chicken broth instead of both cans of evapotated milk. At the last, I sauteed half of a huge head of cabbage with the onion, celery and a little garlic in the bacon grease and threw that in once it cooked down a bit. I garnished it with fresh rosemary. Nice simple potato soup with a couple of personal touches.

This was a hit at our St. Patrick's Day pot luck today.  I reduced the bacon to half a pound, and the evaporated milk to one 13 ounce can.  I also substituted homemade chicken broth for the water and peeled my potatoes instead of scrubbing (easier, and I prefer them that way).  This all worked out really well.  There was not a bit left after the pot luck!

Love potato soup and I am not even Irish. I think the bacon can easlily be cut down to 1/2 pound and also use low-fat evaporated milk to cut the calories.

This was good, but needed a bit more flavor. I added a cup of shredded cabbage(cooked with the onion and celery), and a clove of garlic-minced. Also, I used chicken broth instead of water. I agree with some of the other reviews that a whole pound of bacon is too much. Thanks firewife42 for the recipe!

Made this the way I usually make potatoe soup with regular milk and velveeta cheese.  I just used the idea of the bacon.  We use hamburger usually.  It was an instant favorite!  We have made it more than once already and will make it again for sure.  My daughter wanted it for her birthday.

Not the best potato soup I have had but not bad either. Next time I would sub some of the evaporated milk for some chicken broth. All in all a good starter mix and one that you could play around with to suite your taste.

Good, but, nothing that I'd choose to make again. I like the Rue Based potato soups better.

This soup turned out way better than I expected.  With so few ingredients, I wasn't expecting a whole lot of flavor, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The smokiness of the bacon really comes through, and this soup was delicious.  This was a great alternative to the usual corned beef for our St. Patrick's Day dinner.

I basically needed a recipe to use 2 cans of evaporated milk before they went bad. Found this recipe and it was more than i could have asked for. My husband was skeptical until the 1st bite. Now I have to buy more evaporated milk.

It was my first time making a simple soup and I got it perfect. I was nervous and was doubting myself with the flavor. But it turned out great. Simple and easy instructions to follow. So thank you so much for sharing. Need to improve on the thickness of the cream though.

Remembered from days of old when my mom fed us(11) on so little money. Chunks of potatoe instead of mashed.  Sometimes we had it with no bacon.  Maybe she used chicken broth those times but she always made it more Irish with bright green parsley. Thanks for a long saught recipe.
