This is an excellent tasting bread. I'll have to work a little on the recipe for my machine. My loaf came out wet and heavy. Still this is a recipe that I think is worth working on.

I didn't think this carrot yeast bread was all that special. It needs more salt and spice I think.

Bread came out really dense - don't know what happened. The taste was pretty savory but I didn't care for this flavor all that much.

I like this recipe. If not enough flavor add different seasonings to it. Tastes good dipped in stew.

Great bread! I like the hint of thyme! I subbed honey for the sugar. I'll be making this again!
