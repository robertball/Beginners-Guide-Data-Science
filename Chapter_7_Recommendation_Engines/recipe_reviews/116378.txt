Enjoyed doing this recipe! I used a trick to keep the brest meat moist, take 1/4 of the lemon butter and chilled and stuff under the skin.  As the game hen cooks and it reheats the butter sauce it bastes under the skin, you also get a crispier skin as not all the moisture is put on the outside of the skin.  Help that helps!

This was excellent:) I have the secret to making it moist. First I forgot to put the lemon juice with the mix so I ended up putting just the lemon juice over the hens before putting them in the oven. Then half way through I put more lemon juice on them. My husband said it was the best thing I have ever made.

First time cooking Cornish Hens? Do it Deborah's way. This recipe was not the first one I'd followed to prepare cornish hens, so I went in already knowing I love the meat.  Skip the others, learn this, then try the others. This was unintimidating, it was quick, and was prepared using ingredients typically on hand. If you are a cook thinking, "Hm. I've seen those at the grocer," and you've landed on these Lemon Thyme Cornish Hens, then you can cook 'em.  Delicious - and you can play around (I threw a few raisins in the cavity to sweeten the pot, and because I love raisins when they've roasted in ANYthing.) or play it straight. The kitchen warms up, the house smells terrific. I served with diced, slow-simmered (bulk produce) yams in tomato base broth right along with the oven clock. I've served with mashed potatoes and mixed veggies.

I served this to company and it got rave reviews! The only thing I did differently was to salt & pepper the cavity of the bird and stuff a wedge of lemon in there before cooking. I think this really helped with additional lemon flavor as well as keeping it very moist. All hens were perfectly cooked after 1 hour.

Very good. I put the hens in a crockpot. They turned out tender and delicious. I strained and thickened the broth with a little cornstarch.

Wish my skin would have turned out crispier.  I did put some of the basting sauce under the skin before roasting.  Any other suggestions?

Excellent, but I changed somewhat so hence, four stars. Rather than the lemon juice, I cut up two lemons into eighths and cooked them with the hens, and they caramelized so you could eat them, skin and all. Delicious!

I thought these had really great flavor.  I loved the lemon herb butter.  They were easy to make too.  I forgot to check the hens' cavity for spare body parts...oops.  Oh well- these still turned out great!  We only wish the skin had crisped up more, but it may have been something I did.

Excellent recipe, very good seasoning for these greasy-yet-super-succulent birds. The reviewer who said add chilled butter/margarine+herbs mixture under skin got it right - I actually rubbed it under the breast skin (had to cut the membrane w/ scissors to avoid ripping - works well), AND rubbed it on the outside of the birds. Also used ready-minced garlic instead of fresh, worked great.

Definitely not our cup of tea. Albeit my first time making and eating a Cornish hen, these were really bland despite basting repeatedly with the butter sauce. I am giving this 3 stars because my boyfriend ate his, but I think he was just trying to make me feel better.  I am guessing that it's not the fault of the recipe, but that we just don't like Cornish hens. Win some, lose some, right?!

These are excellent! Cooked our hens for an hour, covered the last 15 minutes due to browning and they were moist. My family loved the lemon touch! Thanks!

Tasted great! The skin had a crunch with a beautiful flavor. I wish I would have basted a little more but that reflects nothing on the recipe itself.

Good for chicken (if you know what I mean)!  The lemon flavor is so refreshing.  Hubby very much liked and he can be somewhat picky.  Took readers' advice, salted cavity and stuffed with lemon rind.  Also, last 15 mins. squeezed lemon juice on skin to crisp.  Definitely will make again.

I really loved the flavor, however the meat was not as moist as I expected.  I would like to try this recipe on a whole chicken, too.  It was very good.

The taste with the seasoning of these hens was so good!  I split them and put them on the grill @ 400 degrees.  I put some of the butter mixture under the skin before putting it on the grill and then basted @ 15 min intervals.  Once it came off the grill I tented with foil for ten minutes and sprinkled more lemon juice over the top before serving.  Moist and flavorful!  Will keep it for the future!!  Thank you for sharing!

This recipe was Deeelicious! I actually didn't have lemons to juice so I substituted a table spoon of vinegar. Still came out great! Thanks for the recipe.

Good recipe...but I used just a 1/4 tsp of thyme because I was no sure I would like the taste. I am glad I did because thyme is strong tasting to me.

Really good. This was the first time I've ever roasted a whole bird of any kind and they turned out great. My only problem was that the butter started burning in the bottom of my pyrex baking dish. I drizzled a little oil into the rest of the lemon/butter mixture to keep the butter from burning and all was well. I also didn't have the problem with the skin not being crisp. Mine game hen skin was super delicious, lemony, fatty, and crunchy--almost the best part of the meal.

First time making cornish hens.  I chose this recipe cuz it was nice & simple and I could serve mashed potatoes & corn on the side instead of worrying about stuffing the hens.  I had to double the ingredients because I had 4.  I used fresh thyme instead of dried, but kept everything else the same including timing & temp.  Came out tasty, juicy, the meat falls off the bone.  My guests and I were very pleased.

I made this tonight for my partner and one of our closest friends... a real hit!  The taste was phenomenal.  I did add a variation to it though... I chopped one apple, some onion, a whole garlic clove for each hen and add it to some melted butter, lemon juice and thyme and stuffed the hens.

This recipe is amazing. I put the lemon butter mixture under the skin, and on top. I basted it a few times as well as adding some more under the skin about halfway through cooking time. The skin came out crisp and the hens were extremely moist and so delicious! I had to cook the hens longer though, a little over an hour before they reached temp. I also covered with foil about 2/3 of the way through.

My husband really enjoyed this recipe.  I might cut the butter in half for next time, but I might have had smaller hens as well.

I did as others have said, put lemon wedges inside the hens. I also melt the butter in a pan with the other ingredients, I also will add either rosemary or dill.

I don't enjoy cornish hens normally, but this recipe was actually quite delicious. I ended up having to cook for an hour, and I added a little more butter about half way through. Delicious recipe.
