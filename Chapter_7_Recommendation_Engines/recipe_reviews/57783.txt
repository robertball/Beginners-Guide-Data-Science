These turned out great! I've never had much success with homemade hashbrowns, always because I have just tried frying up plain grated potatoes, and I thought I would look for an actual recipe that might yield something a bit more restaurant-quality. This recipe is definetly it! They weren't greasy at all, they held together perfectly, and they looked quite pretty when they were done cooking, too. Next time, I think I will add my salt & pepper, plus some extra spices, to the shredded potato and egg/flour mixture, just to give it a more intense flavor. This recipe is so easy that I will have no problems just making these hashbrowns from memory, eyeballing the flour and spices, etc. Highly recommended!!!

Wow.  Unbelievable.  About as good as one could hope for. Crispy on the outside, firm and tasty on the inside.  And what a flavor.  This will be my hashbrown recipe from here on out.

I do have one cautionary tip, particularly if like me, you haven't cooked hashbrowns before.  Make sure that you don't have too much oil in the pan.  The hashbrowns will take forever to brown and may be too greasy for your taste.

This is a great versatile recipe. I used sweet potatoes instead of russetts and flavored them with salt, pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and ground clove. Really delicious. If you have a food processor you can shred the potato and they will keep in the freezer until ready for use.

This recipe was fantastic!  The hash browns were golden and crispy on the outside and creamy in the middle.  

My girlfriend said she felt like hash browns with bacon and onions in them so I used this recipe as my starting point.  First, I pan-fryed 6 bacon strips until crispy (next time I will use at least 8).  Then I broke up the bacon into tiny pieces and added them into the mix with the other ingredients along with 1/2 red onion chopped, sea salt and cracked black pepper.  Also, i made little hash brown patties rather than covering the whole pan.  They really turned out nice.

Isn't it great when you can create something in the kitchen using simple ingredients. Here's a few ideas of playing around with an already excellent recipe. 1. Where the recipe calls for squeezing the liquid out of the shredded potatoes... it REALLY means it. Make sure all the liquid is gone. You might place the shredded potatoes in the middle of a clean tea towel, or cheesecloth, form into a small pouch, and squeeze. 2. If you're looking for a way to reduce the oil, here's a trick. Go to a local cooking store, and purchase an oil mister. Then pick up a bottle of grape seed oil (make sure it's unflavored). Grape seed oil will not impart any additional flavor to the dish, and it has a high smoke point. Fill the mister with the oil (a mister is like a refillable spray bottle). Now, get the hash browns ready for cooking. Preheat a skillet over medium-high heat, and then use the mister to spray the surface of the pan, and finally add a half tablespoon of sweet butter. Cook the hash browns until the outer surface is crispy, but not burned (about 5 minutes per side). They will taste great... without all that oil. You might want to sprinkle some finely grated cheddar or harvarti cheese over the top... up to you, and your guests. Serve while still nice and hot. They will be crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. Keep the faith, and keep cooking.

My first try at making hash browns. Success. I added sharp cheddar, a little garlic powder,dash of oregano and some green onions. Extra virgin olive oil to fry in, about a quarter cup. Will keep this recipe and use over and over. Always trying a little something different.

Thank you, Emily!  I've never had success with hash browns and those were wonderful.  I used two skillets; one with a thick layer and another with just a thin layer.  They were both great.  I didn't use nearly as much oil as the recipe called for and will use even less next time.

I thought it was weird that this recipe has so many different reviews, but this just wasn't good to us.  I thought the flour and egg were fine (used less flour than recipe), but it was the oil.  After the hash browns sat out on the paper towel they were still very oily.  Maybe we will try MISSCATIAS suggestion of cooking them with no oil.

Made these for my husband's breakfast.  Used red potatoes as that is what I had on hand and used 3 as they were not quite medium in size.  Hash browns were great, fried nice and brown and very crisp, the way I like them.  Will definitely make these again.  Thanks for sharing.

These were great! I've made several different attempts at hashbrowns (all with tips from my hubby) and they never turn out golden brown, just overcooked brown. I did make a few little changes, I shredded the potatoes and put them into a pot of boiling water and let them cook until the shreds were slightly translucent. Drained and patted the shreds dry and put into the fridge until cooled (overnight). The next morning I continued with this recipe, I did add my own spices to the mixture to give them a little more pizzaz, since I don't cook with onions (allergies) Added a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder. This way is just a little more time consuming, but seems easier the next morning :)

Excellent!  Just what I've been looking for.  Halved the recipe (yes actually halved the beaten egg and should have saved the other half for the next day).  Made two days in a row and did not have any eggs the second time, so subbed a tablespoon or so of plain yogurt (sour cream would do as well) for the binding agent, and hubby could not tell the difference, thank goodness! Did not use nearly that much oil; just drizzled olive oil in small frying pan to coat and it worked great.  Thanks so much for sharing.

SERIOUSLY EXCELLENT!  Shredded the potatoes, raw and unpeeled in the food processor, and spread them in some layers of paper towel.  Microwaved them on high for about 2.5 minutes.  Added garlic with the onion.  Cooked in a smallish non-stick skillet in a thick layer, using much less fat than the recipe indictaes.  Inverted plate over skillet to flip it, but ending up turning it several times in the pan to intersperse the crispy brown cooked edges.  Cooked it about 25 minutes all together to make sure no potatoes were 'crunchy'.  This seemed just right.  LOVED IT.  

Next time, will saute the onion first and include green onion as well as white, use a pinch of hot pepper flakes, and if feeling decadent, a few pats of butter to kick up the flavor quotient.  

Emily, the simplest things are often the best - and this was great - thanks!

UPDATE - sorry, microwave the potatoes in wax paper - it will stick to the paper towels.

Yum! Made these tonight (sans onion - due to family preferences) and THIS recipe is already in my cookbook!  Thanks Emily...... and yes, I was another 'failure' in the hashbrown department, until now! (and I wouldn't buy the ones with hydrogenated oils from the store - so we've only been eating fried potatoes, still good, but this is a great option)  TIP:  I put the grated potatoes into water that I had run into the bowl of my salad spinner.  When I was done grating the potatoes, I simply dumped the water and potatoes through the strainer portion of the salad spinner.  Then I spun them babies dry!  Easy as could be!  I had to dump the water out of the bowl of the spinner a couple of times while spinning dry, but that was so much easier than trying to dry them with paper towels, cheese cloth, and/or etc. --  I was pressed for time, so I sort of accidentally left out the eggs, but they were still wonderful.  I PLAN TO USE THESE FOR HASHBROWN 'NESTS' FOR EGGS, OR ETC. - - - The options are probably endless (just an egg, egg and spinach topped with seasoned ricotta, BBQ sc and cheese, eggs-spinach-kielbasa, etc., etc., etc.,).  I hope they'll freeze well.  Hopefully I remember to let you know if they do. -- Can change these up as either hashbrowns or nests by adding in garlic, sauteed red bell ppr, mustard, cayenne or red ppr flakes,  - - - - - And with one reviewer's idea of using sweet potatoes along with sweet spices, I'm wondering about making SWEET POTATO NESTS!.... yum!!!!!

This recipe brings back childhood memories. My Irish grandmother used to make them almost every Saturday night during winter. Back during the depression when food was scarce potatoes were a staple vegetable which could be grown in the backyard therefore was a cheap meal. We would load up with the tomato sauce and tuck right in. Reviewer's have added bacon in the ingredients where as if we were lucky grandmother may put some bacon on the side with an egg. Now being a grandmum myself I'll be dishing this up to my grandchildren, but being an Aussie we can't leave off the tomato sauce. I must admit we fried them in the frypan with a light coating of butter in the pan not oil. Butter helped with the overall flavour where as oil would be soaked up into the potato. Thanks for reminding me of a good old fashion favourite staple.

These hashbrowns turned out nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I left out the onion because hubby wouldn't eat them if I had added them but I think they would have been much better with the onion. I recommend making these thinner than the 1/2 inch called for because they are mush inside when they're too thick. I think I will try to cut back just a tad bit on the flour next time I make them in case that is why the thicker ones seemed mushy inside. But if you keep them on the thinner side they are perfect. I also added a touch of garlic powder, onion powder since I added no onions, and used seasoning salt and fresh ground pepper.

I think I used too much potato... probably needed a little more flour, but the hash browns came great.  the onion added an excellent flavor and they browned perfectly.  i used safflower oil to fry them.  fantastic.  will definitely use this recipe for all my hash browns in the future... although i may add some pepper etc. as added flavor.  fantastic!

This is a good recipe but my husband wasn't very happy with them so giving 3 stars. I wasn't perfectly satisfied with results either. I read some reviews and realised that the following steps will make them amazing :
Rinse and soak in cold water a few times until the starch clears out. The starch makes them gooey and too mushy, so it must be rinsed out like we do rice. 
Then squeeze the living day lights out of them - that is.the water. Take out every drop of it. Squeeze and then completely pat dry.
Then follow the recipe as it, except use 1/4 the quantity of oil.
Hope this helps.

My family loves hash-browns...I make them in a 12 inch skillet and when it is time to flip them, grab a sheet pan, place it over the skillet, invert and then slid them back into the pan...voila, perfectly flipped hash browns! (then i use the sheet pan to keep them warm in the oven while i prepare everyone's eggs.)Cut with a pizza cutter.

These are not hash browns.  This is a recipe that has been in my family for generations.  I learned how to make them from my German Grandmother.  They are called potato pancakes and are delicious served with apple sauce.  I still make them on occasion although I now fry them in canola oil rather than the Crisco she used back then.  I am now 70 and have handed down the recipe to my 3 children and my older grand children.
Enjoy them everyone regardless of what they are called.

These are definitely "Good old fashioned restaurant-style hash browns..."  like those I remember and which are pretty much impossible to find today.  Whether they are more like latkes or hashbrowns is irrelevant:  they are wonderful!  I can finally end my search for a good hashbrown recipe.  The only change I made was to use unflavored frozen hashbrowns (because I hate shredding) and to defrost, and thereby dryout, on a paper plate sprayed with cooking oil in the microwave.  Thank you your mom, you have make me very happy.

Wonderful potato pancakes AKA Latkes. Great with applesauce or sour cream. Hash browns are just potatoes, shredded, seasoned & fried.

Wow, these were so good. This is the only way to make hash browns.  I used very little oil in the bottom of my electric skillet set to 400. I made them for breakfast for dinner the other night when my brother and his family came over and these were a big hit! I used a 20 oz package of Simply Potatoes Southwest Style Hash Browns along with a cup of leftover Simply Potatoes Shredded Hash Browns and didn't change a thing after that.

My family calls these latke's or potato pancakes, its a base recipe that is fantastic.  I do use a bit less flour and I make sure that as much liquid from the grated/shredded potatoes is squeezed out (put shreds/grated potato in colander press down with papertowel, mix it up do it again - a few times) this helps for a firmer latke where you can use less flour - in my opinion too much flour can ruin these.
1/4 cup is about right, but you have to judge the potatoes you use, some are "wetter" than others and I generally use less than a 1/4 cup.  and now for the best part.. You can jazz these up in so many ways!! Add hot sauce for a spicy mix to the egg, italian or ranch dry seasoning w/ the flour. Taco seasoning.. the list is endless! another little tip, if you, as I do, occasionally try not to fry everything in sight for health, you can do these in the oven, but I suggest first microwaving the potato shreds for just a couple of minutes, then mix everything when the shreds have cooled. Form the patties (not too thick or thin) spray with butter flavored cooking spray,and then pop into the oven. If you're worried about trying in the oven- test a few while you're frying so you can judge temp/thickness etc.  for added pizzazz... put a slice of your fav. cheese on top when they're nearly done. We've tried all these variations regularly - and this is a GREAT Recipe.

Loved it, but changed a few things.

Used the equivalent weight of unpeeled red potatoes.
Soaked the grated potatoes in a quart of water with 1 tsp salt for 10 minutes, then rinsed and squeezed dry.

The only difference between this recipe and the one I have been using is the egg.  What a difference an egg makes! (Sounds like an old song, doesn't it?) I have been cooking for a long time so I didn't measure anything and I used red potatoes instead of russets.  I spread the mixture in the hot skillet and left it alone for 5 minutes. Turned it over and left it another 5 minutes.  Viola! Perfect! If this didn't turn out right for you, you did something wrong. Thanks, Emily!

This really did give me restaurant style hashbrowns!  The outside was golden and crispy and the inside was soft and creamy.   For additional flavor I added some garlic powder and cayenne pepper.  The only thing I did differently was not use nearly the oil as stated in the recipe due to many reviews saying they were greasy.  Plus - I really didn't want the excess oil.  I used just enough to lightly cover the bottom of the pan and made sure it was rippling hot before I added the hashbrowns.  I then turned the temp down slightly so they wouldn't burn.  When I flipped I didn't add any additional oil.  The second side didn't have quite the golden crispy texture since it didn't have any extra oil, but, we still liked it and saved on some of the fat.

Excellent!  Really is a potato pancake recipe done as hash browns.  I seasoned them with finely diced chives, a little garlic and herbs, as the spirit moves me.  I always mis butter with the oil because I like the flavor and the browing from butter. I have also added finely diced cooked bacon to the mixture.

Wish I would have found this simple recipe a long time ago.  I had never added flour & egg to fried potatoes before, but it made a big difference and even smelled better than regular fried potatoes.  Only a small amount of oil is necessary to get lots of crispy edges.  These are really good.

I was so excited to try these because they sounded so good, but when I made them, I did not care for them. First off, WAY too much onion, next time, I will cut the onion in half. Next, WAY too oily, so I will use cooking spray next time. Also, VERY bland, so I am going to add some extra spices next time, like garlic, onion powder, salt, pepper, and maybe a little red pepper for something extra. (You could probably add some other veggies too, like green pepper, green onion, mushrooms.) Oh, I made my second batch VERY thin, I will do this next time as well.

I have never been successful at making a hash brown that didn't either burn, turn out raw or just plain tasted bad! I was so excited when I made these... they are fabulous!!!  I made them for breakfast but would make them at dinner too!  I followed the recipe exactly other than adding in a bit more spices (seasoning salt & onion)... yum yum yum! Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!  Update:  Forgot how good these really are... made them again and added finely shredded cheese, garlic powder, seasoning salt, black pepper and cayenne pepper... fried in olive oil mixed with a bit of butter... delicious!!!!

If sullys hash browns were to greasy they were possibly fried in oil that was not hot enough. if you get the temperature right they don't absorb as much oil. Skipper Bob

Thee are great and easy.  More like potato pancakes but, big deal.  We love potato pancakes! I grated a little more potato than called for so added another egg.  I did not use so much oil and mine came out perfect.  This is the 3rd time I have made them and just forgot to review.  Thanks for such a great recipe yourmom!

Very good recipe! Turned out perfect! I was lazy and used onion powder instead of the onion and mixed in freeze dried chives for color. Next time I will add cayenne pepper in the mix for more flavor & zip.

great basic recipe! the onions add a nice sweet taste and the flour and egg make this very hearty and enough to eat by itself!
some tips for better taste:
definitely add seasoning in the mix before cooking
and add anything you think might taste good. i found creole seasoning went well.
cook in small patties. i tried making a large one and didn't come out as well.
im going to try shredding the onion as well next time for better distribution and try to use less oil!
but great recipe!

Really, really good! Use plenty of oil and cook medium/medium high heat so as not to burn them before the inside cooks. My family ate them up!

Great recipe, resulting in super tasty, perfectly golden and crispy hashbrowns. The step of washing the grated potato really helped remove starch, and the flour and egg bound it all together without being sloppy. I served these with a poached egg on top and tomato chutney on the side, and my family loved them.

Hot, crispy, hash brown perfection! I added a bit of garlic for extra flavor, and plenty of salt & pepper. Make sure your oil is the right temp so they don't turn out greasy or burn. The kids gobbled them up!

These were great!  I used Yukon Gold and was lazy and didn't rinse them. I also added a bunch of thyme and they turned out fantastic! My only advice is to make sure your oil stays hot while cooking, otherwise they will turn soggy.

Great recipe!  I used less oil and they browned nicely anyway.  I recommend rinsing and spinning the potato shreds in a salad spinner.  Much easier.  Though you probably want to do it two batches.

I had to make a bit more because of the men I was feeding with this, so I multiplied the recipe by 1 1/2. I used 3 medium russet potatoes, a Jumbo egg, 1/3 cup flour, half an onion, half a bell pepper and a couple of chopped mushrooms. However, I reduced the oil to 3/4 cup so they wouldn't be so greasy. I used an iron skillet and cooked them on a lower heat (#6 on an electric stove). They were difficult to flip, but once I did, I moved them into the oven on 350 to finish them off nicely.  It took much longer to cook that way, but they came out perfect. I WILL make this again!  There wasn't a crumb left!

Really delicious. I used the little boxes of dehydrated hashbrowns from costco and dehydrated chopped onions, chopped red pepper, and salt and pepper prior to frying. Had to use two eggs and 1/2 cup of flour due to increased potato amount. Fried in bacon drippings and was delicious and unbelievably fast this way. Family loved it!! Will try with real potatoes and onions when I have more time.

Great recipe. I never thought to add flour and egg to the potato mixture, but I think that was the trick. I'm not a super spicy person, but I added a little cayenne pepper along with the salt and pepper and they were fantastic. And tip I read that helped: I used my salad spinner to dry the potatoes. Best hashbrown recipe I've found.

Great! Seldom do I see the proper instructions to make crispy hash browns. Rinsing to remove all of the starch and thoroughly drying the potatoes is the kicker to achieve mom n pop restaurant breakfast hash browns.

I like them a tad crispier, so I add 1/2 tsp of baking powder. The towel you squeeze them in will never come clean if you don't rinse it thoroughly immediately.  I use a salad spinner to dry mine.

Loved these hash browns. The first time I flipped them they were perfectly browned and stayed together nicely. The second flip was not as sucessful. They were not browned enough so I flipped them again and my nice patties all fell apart. Still tasty though. I will be more patient next time so they come out nice and pretty and in one piece.

Wonderful basic recipe. You can totally estimate this (I didn't use any measuring tools.)
I have been making potato pancakes for a long time, the polish way (placki ziemniaczane) and it's basically the same as this except I added fresh dill and serve with sour cream (my boyfriend had hot sauce and ketchup) and they are little pancake shaped.
I use just a little oil to coat the pan, and cooked for about 10 minutes each side to make them extra crispy. I added more oil when I flipped.

1. Where the recipe calls for squeezing the liquid out of the shredded potatoes... it REALLY means it. Make sure all the liquid is gone. You might place the shredded potatoes in the middle of a clean tea towel, or cheesecloth, form into a small pouch, and squeeze. 2. If you're looking for a way to reduce the oil, here's a trick. Go to a local cooking store, and purchase an oil mister. Then pick up a bottle of grape seed oil (make sure it's unflavored). Grape seed oil will not impart any additional flavor to the dish, and it has a high smoke point. Fill the mister with the oil (a mister is like a refillable spray bottle). Now, get the hash browns ready for cooking. Preheat a skillet over medium-high heat, and then use the mister to spray the surface of the pan, and finally add a half tablespoon of sweet butter. Cook the hash browns until the outer surface is crispy, but not burned (about 5 minutes per side). They will taste great... without all that oil. You might want to sprinkle some finely grated cheddar or harvarti cheese over the top...

Fantastic. I do 'em without onion. It seems like if you don't rinse the shreds they cook kinda sticky, too. Amazing recipe - kudos!

These hash browns were some of the best homemade I've ever tried!  I added some extra onions along with red and green bell pepper,some garlic and onion powder, and WOW!  I had about 1/2 the batch left over so i formed them into patties and froze them for a quick breakfast go-to.

Such an easy, quick recipe to make. I added bacon bits (just the pre-packaged bits) and it tasted phenomenal. I cooked them for about 6 minutes on each side at a little lower heat and it turned out a little darker brown and crunchy, without being or tasting burnt.

I make a great breakfast, except hashbrowns.  These came out great!  My family loved them!  Just the right crisp, and soft combo.  I wasn't sure when I saw egg and flour added to the potatoes, but it works wonderful.

I'm not sure why these have to be rinsed?  I put them in strainer and squeezed out some potato water but they were still quite wet. Add  any spices, herbs you prefer in the mixture before cooking otherwise they are a bit bland. Also cook for much longer than 5 min per side (unless you are making them super thin).  I cooked for about 15 per side.

I don't know what happened.  They were kind of a gloppy mess.  They took a lot longer to cook on each side than the recipe suggested.  I cranked up the heat after 20 min of cooking and almost burned them.  I'm sure this is a great recipe, but I'm not such a great cook obviously.  My family ate them and gave me compliments, but I didn't feel too good about what I produced.  I will try again next time in search of the allusive perfect hash browns.

Sometimes, you just have to have some good hash browns for breakfast. These were great - quick and easy. I used maybe 3 T of oil (a mix of olive oil and bacon fat) and green onions. I cooked in a well-seasoned cast iron skillet - no sticking. Thanks for the recipe.

I've NEVER made hash browns before and really don't eat them, so I had no idea if they were going to be good, but my family LOVED them!  And since they know hash browns much better than me, I'm taking their word for it, and I loved them too!

This is similar to a recipe I make. However, the difference in how much flour, eggs, and onion added which is key. These were cooked in way "too much" oil. My recipe has about 1 tsp. minced, for the amount of potato in this recipe. If the onion is not chopped very small it may not cook fully and stay hard. Mine held together, but I believe it was because all of the grease. However, they were just way to "oniony" and "oily" in my opinion. If made properly with the right amount of flour, eggs, and milk, they will hold together nicely with very little butter or oil.

These were REALLY good....reminded me of the potato cakes I usually make using mashed potatoes, but that much better!!!  I added a little more onion than the recipe called for and ate mine with sour cream on top!  MMMMMM!!!  I may add a little sharp cheddar to the mix next time!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe produces a really well flavored hash brown.  Delicious and nice and crispy.  I added a pinch of cayenne pepper which gave it a little bit more bang.  Unfortunately I put them in an oven, uncovered to stay warm, and they lost their crisp and I think the potatoes continued to cook, because it became quite starchy.  So, serve immediately!

These turned out perfectly!  I used light skinned butter potatoes (that's what I had) and I added salt and pepper to the batter.  Served sprinkled with chives from my garden and they were delicious!  Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and they held together beautifully in the pan.  Next time I will use less oil to cut back on the fat, but this time, they just hit the spot.

Just made this morning.  Really good.  Added a little heat with some blackened cajun spice and garlic.  Also only used about 3 Tbls of oil instead of a cup!  Very crispy on the outside and a nice moist almost creamy inside...added Steak & Shake chili on top...YUM!

This was my first attempt at making home-made hash browns.  They turned out pretty good, although next time I'll use less flour.  Also, don't  forget to dry the potato shreds before mixing in the rest of the ingredients!

These were great!  Tyler Florence has a similar recipe, but I wasn't quite as crazy about his because he used just the egg white rather than the whole egg.  Not being too crazy about egg in the first place, all I found was egg white in those.  These however didn't do that.  I love how crisp they got and I was thinking about a few variations that I might try at another time for them.  One of the things I like to do is to put swiss cheese in the last few minutes of cooking....it tastes great!   The secret is to making great hash browns squeeze the excess water out of the potatoes and that russets make the very best hash browns.  Thanks for the recipes, these were great!

Left out the onion and added salt and pepper to the mixture itself, in addition to a light sprinkling at the end. Also cut down the amount of oil. Only used enough to barely coat the bottom of the pan. The ONLY hash brown recipe I'll ever use!

I tried these hash browns this morning and they turned out great. I did the recipe like it says except for the amount of oil. I cooked bacon while I prepared the hash browns and after the bacon was cooked I poured out some of the grease and fried the hash browns in the same pan that i cooked the bacon in. I did mine in small patties and they turned out great. I will be making these again and maybe next time I will add some crumbled bacon. Thanks for the recipe.

These are actually very good with a little bit of ketchup...I love them in the morning or even as part of lunch on the weekend...Play with it by putting some grated cheese of your choice on it while it's still hot....Bon Appetit!

We did not like this recipe.  The success to making great, crispy hash browns is to have the oil hot enough, put the hash browns in and just let them cook, don't mess with them, by tossing and stirring.  Check for desired crispness then flip as many over as you can until all are flipped.  Always avoid stirring.

I added some all-season salt while browning the hashbrowns. They turned out okay but nothing amazing...and there were a couple "chunks" thanks to the egg and flour (just a few).  Still, I think the frozen ones are a little easier and are just as good. Thanks anyways.

These hash browns held together well, but were too doughy for me. I could taste the flour in there not the potatoes.this recipe is easy to flip and work with in the pan though.

This recipe is fabulous and foolproof! Made it for the first time in the middle of the night with my eyes half closed and if turned out beautifully. I did add some cayenne, freshly ground pepper and a few chili flakes to give my hashbrowns some kick. Once I had a good sear on both sides, about 1 min on med-high heat, I turned the heat down to med-low and covered the pan so that they would be all the way cooked inside. Great recipe overall!

Wow, can there be any better hash browns than these? I followed the recipe exactly except that I added about 1/4 tsp. of cayenne and a half cup of homemade salsa for a little more kick and color. They were tremendous! They've found a safe place in our family recipe book. Thank you so much for sharing a great recipe!

I never follow recipes cause sizes of like say potatoes are different 
I grated my potatoes added the egg then slowly add the flour i only ended up using like third of a cup
I like spices and sell epicure so i added a heaping table soon of their onion and bacon cheese ball seasoning
I used butter to fry them up with instead of oil  cooked on 4 5 heat and more then 5 mins on each side when its golden brown on a lower temp its cooked 
Added salt and pepper to taste after it was cooked and these are by far amazing tasted so freaking good

I don't usually make a big breakfast, but our grandsons are visiting so, you know, I had to make it special. I'd never made hash browns from scratch, but this recipe looked easy enough, so I opted to give it a try, using tips from other reviews. I washed about 8 small (slightly soft) unpeeled red potatoes, then dried them before shredding them with a food processor. Then I rinsed the shredded potato per the recipe, then spun them in a salad spinner, and then patted them with paper towels to get them as dry as possible. (I suspect some of the bad reviews come from not drying the potatoes enough.) I added the egg and flour, about 1 tbsp. onion powder, a tsp. of Kosher salt, and about a dozen strands of saffron (a delicious tip from an entirely different potato recipe). I used a cast iron griddle wiped down with Grape Seed Oil, and I tossed on a tbsp. of butter just before spreading the potato mix out to about 1/2" thick. (In other words, I used far less "grease" than the recipe calls for.) I flipped them after about 10 minutes and tossed another tbsp. of butter onto the griddle for the second side. They browned up nicely after another 10 minutes. The boys liked them (mission accomplished) but the real surprise was my husband of 32 years: he's a hash brown addict who says these are "hands down" the best he's ever eaten: "crunchy on the outside and not oily. Perfect. The best ever!" I don't get raving compliments like that very often. So thank you, Emily. What a treat!

Couldn't think of a better hash brown recipe.  I took the easy way out and used frozen shredded hash browns (thawed for 4 hours) and they were perfect and much less hassle than doing the potatoes by hand.  I followed the recipe exactly except I added some spices to the egg mix like ceyenne pepper, regular pepper and seasoned salt.  In addition I didn't use quite the entire bag of hash browns, maybe slightly over 3/4 so they would be easier to flip in the skillet.  I won't make hash browns any other way from now on!

followed recipe exactly and couldn't have been more pleased.  No more store bought hash browns for my family..these were great.  The one thing I did a little differently was to make them slightly ahead of time, I followed the suggestion of making little piles like pancakes, I  browned them well on both sides before removing to a cookie sheet to be reheated  at 350 for just a about 5 minutes when I was ready to serve...I just didn't have room on my stove top for all the frying pans I needed, they tasted great and the family ate them all..and asked for repeats next time we do BFD.

Did the recipe to a tee and they would not form into separate cakes (too runny). So I tried doing the entire pan (as also suggested in the recipe) and they just wouldn't cook up. I tried using less oil, still no go.  Tried adding more flour to thicken it up and it just made it pastey and tasteless. Just couldn't save this one.

These are scrumpdiddly!  Couple of tips I found: I fried them in Light Olive Oil for a lighter taste than vegetable oil. I also cooked them covered on medium to medium high in small pancake size individual servings, this way the onions didn't burn.  Make sure you rinse and squeeze dry, this keeps your potatoes from turning grey! And lastly drain well.  I kept mine on newspaper and paper towels in the microwave and patted with paper towel before serving.  *try topping with cheese and leftover ham from the holidays!!!

Dh and dd rated these at 4 1/2 *. I used my food processor to shred the washed potato, skin and all and also shredded about 1/2 small onion. I fried up a regular small pack of bacon beforehand and crumbled this into the mix (not the fat). I added 1 tspn minced garlic, not alot of salt (because the bacon was salty - make sure you taste the bacon to know), pepper and about 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese. As soon as dh came home from work, he was into them as I started frying them up straight away, using the 1 cup of vegetable oil, although this doesn't have a high smoking point, I used my non stick electric frypan set between 9 and 10. Took them out of the fat when both sides were crispy, dark golden brown. I served them with sweet chilli dipping sauce and salad. Dh said they were pretty good, and considering he mowed through nearly the whole lot of them, I would say this recipe is a success. Oh yeah - I dried the potato with paper towel, three layers of towel on a flat plate, potato, then three more layers of towel, squeeze and press out juice until paper is soaked, then remove top layer and replace with dry paper, flip and do the same to the other side. Keep going, by flipping until the dry layer is on the bottom and replace the top layer until you soak up the juice.

What a great recipe! These turned very nicely golden brown and tasted just like hash browns should taste. 

I didn't use the full amount of oil -- in fact, I probably used less than half a cup -- but here's a tip for those who felt their potatoes turned out too oily: Make sure your oil is plenty hot before adding the potatoes. Potatoes will readily absorb oil if it's not hot enough, and then you'll definitely have a disappointing result.

I didn't have regular onions on hand, so I used green onions, which were perfect for this. I did make one slight change: after shredding and rinsing the potatoes, I set them in a pan of cold water over high heat until the water was just about to boil but wasn't quite there yet. It softened them up just a tiny bit and seemed to get that last bit of starch out of them. (If you go this route, immediately immerse in cold water after removing from heat and then drain well. Be sure to squeeze the water out of the potatoes thoroughly.) I also added salt and pepper to the potato mixture before frying. Thanks for a tasty breakfast.

YUM!!! I am gardening so what was ripe/available right now was summer squash and one small red potato.  I shredded the squash and potato, added a few green onions (also from the garden) along with the regular onion, a little garlic, then followed the recipe.  I don't like deep frying, so I heated a tbsp or so of oil and pan fried it in five "pancakes" for easy flipping.  They were golden brown, crispy, and had an unbelievable flavor.  Thanks so much Emily!  This recipe is a keeper.  Maybe someday I'll even make it with potatoes.  ;)

Came out great, tasty, crispy and full of flavor. Will do again. The only thing I added in my mixture are green onions for more pungent flavor. I must admit, the hardest part was draining the potatoes after they were shredded, took me long time.

I grew up in the country with hash browns several times a week. These are THE BEST I've ever had!  Probably not the most healthy for you but hey, if you are going to do it, DO IT RIGHT and these definitely right!  I fried them up separately and put them on a rack in a warm oven. They stay nice and crisp that way and were ready when I needed them. FANTASTIC!

I like to cook up some bacon first, then use the bacon grease to cook the hash browns. Adds great flavor! Also, if you add some shredded Swiss cheese you have Rosti!

We have been making these for many years - we call them Potato Pancakes… We love them as well with sour cream.  They are also excellent with pancetta diced and fried prior to adding to the "hash browns".  YUM!!   I never use that much oil to fry.  I use a non-stick griddle and they turn out just fine.

OK, I have not done this exact recipe and love hash browns, but that said, I always put my potato (russet, pierced with fork) in the microwave for 5 min. per potato, let it cool before grating.  The trick is to remove the starch, or convert it by heating, before frying.  It's the starch that make the potato stick to the fry pan.  Heating the potato cracks the starch (converts it to a sugar)thus microwaving it prior to frying.  The rest of this recipe (flour, onion, egg, salt and pepper) sounds great.  I use butter rather than oil because it doesn't stick as well.

The proportion of onions and potatoes is off.  Too much onion and they should be grated.   One cup of oil?   Wow!  Too greasy...and unnecessary. Seasoning the batter would give more flavor throughout.   I would not try these again.  Sorry.

This recipe is pretty good.  I also pre-soak the potatoes in a little chicken broth which, if you don't have a box already opened, can be made from chicken base and water.  

Leftover mashed potatoes also crisp up very well when given a bath in chicken broth.

I've made these for years but a couple of things I want to relay to those that may not like this recipe.  First off, I don't add much flour to mine.  The more flour you add, the more bready they are going to be and the more of bready taste they will have.  I use two or three large potatoes to about one half a cup of flour.  According to this recipe, I drastically reduce the flour amount.  Another thing I do is fry them in a hot cast iron skillet in a mixture of a little oil and a lot of butter.  I do add a little onion but not much otherwise they will have a very oniony taste.  Finally and perhaps most importantly, is I don't shred my taters to a mush....if you do, you'll have more of a bread patty.  I shred them but not as fine as probably most people do.  MIne come out very much a buttery flavored hash brown.

I sometimes add a little flour to my hash browns when I make them from fresh potatoes, but this is more like potato pancakes than hash browns with the egg and onion. My favorite has browns are still from leftover baked potatoes. The secret to getting them nice and crispy without them being too oily is to get vegetable oil really hot, and don't mess with them too much in the pan. Let them brown well before you turn them, then turn brown well again, and if you like, "dismantle" to expose more unbrowned interior and brown that well, then stop! Any more and you'll have to add more oil and you'll wreck the structure and get something mushy.

My husband is a bit of a hash brown snob and he simply went nuts over this recipe.  I thought it was pretty simple and followed the recipe to the letter.  I think the key is making sure the potatoes are thoroughly rinsed and squeezed as dry as possible, and use a heavy pan.  I used a Lodge 10.5 inch cast iron skillet. I used Canola oil for the oil and it really only needed about 5 minutes per side.  My husband said they were so good,he didn't want to add ketchup (that's high praise!)  Since there's just two of us, we saved half for breakfast tomorrow morning.

These were great!! I've tried making hash browns countless times, and they've never really been very close to restaurant hash browns, until I tried these! They were also super easy and fast! Thanks for an awesome recipe! 

Update: I already made these again! My husband even loves them, and he doesn't usually like hash browns. To the uncooked batter I added a little salt, pepper,  and a few dashes of garlic powder, onion powder and mccormick chicken seasoning (I know it sounds strange, but if you're familiar with this seasoning, you know it's great on so much more than chicken). They were even better this time with the additional seasonings, but even with no changes, these are still the best hash browns I've ever had!

Good, but because my hash browns were a little thick, the inside was bland. I will add salt and pepper to the potatoes before cooking them next time instead of after.  Since I didn't have any oil on hand, I cooked the potatoes with lard. Worked fine, but I think I'll use less next time.  Another option is to use bacon grease which will impart additional flavor.

Great recipe!  I shredded the onion and also shredded 1/2 of a bell pepper to add in, too.  The key is to squeeze ALL of the moisture out of the potatoes, as well as the onion and pepper.  I also used less oil and they browned nicely.  Thanks for this recipe!

Can you make some more of those hash browns you made last night?  30 years of marriage, and that is a first!  My husband is a really good cook, so I value his praise.  The only change requested?  Make a double recipe, the teenage boys didn't leave enough to suit Dad!  Thanks "your mom!"

Just like the description states:  good old-fashioned restaurant style hash browns.  I've been unable to get the right texture out of fresh potatoes until now.  Now I know the secret is the egg and flour!  These were great and if you like onion, you can go a little heavier on that, which I will do next time.

Yum!  Made recipe as written, but at the last minute, added about a tsp of prepared horseradish.  This gave it just a hint of zip without being overpowering.  Thanks for sharing!

super easy- i made these in a large crepe pan with 1/4 inch lip... obviously i used less oil than called for (i didnt measure it) and easily flipped the whole thing over. Also added about 1 Tbsp butter to the oil. Awesome.

this recipe was ok, but there was too much flour in it and the hash browns turned a bit too dense. also next time i will add different spices too.

This recipe was fantastic. My daughter doesn't like to see chopped onions in her food, so I added a little less than a teaspoon of onion powder to the mix with the flour and egg and it was delicious! We'll be making these again for sure.

so i tried to make hasbrowns before and they came out... we'll say starchy. these at least gave me the technique i needed to make perfect hashbrowns. i tried to halve the recipe but i used one large potato and im pretty sure i still had to do the full recipe. used whole wheat flour (milled) and i used a bit more egg white then whole egg and i also added red onion. i used some olive oil in the pan and i noticed when i flipped it that there wasnt a lot of oil on the pan anymore, just enough though so the hashbrown wouldnt stick. it came out not greasy but if you go the less oil route, keep an eye on the second side bc it can get burnt soon after your cooking time. i sprinkled on some cilantro for garnish. yum! so easy and there is no soaking. greta recipe. will be using this recipe every sunday morning (even though i made these for dinner last night!).

Very easy way to make restrauant hashbrowns...helpful hint make sure you have enough oil in the bottom on the pan...more is better...I cooked my pancake size in two batches put the first batch in the oven on a jelly roll pan lined with papertowels to keep them hot 350 is fine

My husband said these are the best hashbrowns he's ever eaten.  I didn't have any onion, so I used about 1/4 tsp. onion powder.  I also added about 1/4 cup shredded red and green peppers.  I shredded my potatoes using the largest holes on my cheese grater, and it worked awesome (I was afraid it would make the pieces too small and mushy, but not at all).

Excellent! I did add a bit of salt to the batter (instead of just sprinkling it on later). I may try it with a bit less flour sometime, just to see how it makes it different, but these are good as is, too.

Just made these, and was very disappointed. I doubled the recipe, but otherwise followed it exactly. Made patties rather than whole-skillet. While the patties did brown, they did not get really crunchy, and what was worse, the potatoes did not fully cook!  Yuck!  I did cook the last round a bit longer, after my family dug in and made ick faces, and the last batch were slightly better, but still tasted quite a bit like raw potato. Also need salt in the mixture, not just on top. The addition of the egg seemed somewhat unnecessary. One final note--I did cook these on an iron griddle, in a very small amount of oil. Did not have any trouble with them sticking, but perhaps not being partially submerged in a cup of oil made a difference in the cooked/not cooked taste. Will not try these again.

My husband is a huge hash browns fan and his reaction to these were "these are the best hash browns I've ever tasted!" I added about 1/2 tsp salt, some fresh ground black pepper and a dash of paprika and garlic powder. It was a crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside, flavor explosion. You can cut back on the oil significantly too - just use enough to generously coat your pan. Use a metal or firm spatula so you don't lose some of the good brown outside. And I'd recommend making individual piles rather than one big one to make flipping easier. Thank for the recipe!!

Ok, I cheated, I used bagged, shredded potatoes, but NOT frozen. I was too lazy to grate potatoes myself on Christmas morning. After that I followed the recipe to the T! The potatoes did come out nice and crispy but I thought even with the onion they were missing a bit of flavor. I'm guessing it's because I didn't use freshly grated potatoes. I will definitely try these again!

Sorry.  I don't know if it was me, but this just came out terrible greasy.  I know I had the temp on my oil right, so I don't know, but I didn't care for this

I followed the recipe as written, which I believe is necessary to review it. With its few ingredients and steps, it's simple, easy and tasty. What's not to like? Definitely a keeper.

This is a good basic recipe, to which you could add any number of spices to suit your preference. The recipe suggests 1 cup of oil, or as needed; I used a cast iron skillet and about a tsp of oil. Not greasy at all.

These were actually a big hit in the house, everyone but me loved them, mainly because they eat this food often, but instead of using potatoes, they use cauliflower. I was rather disappointed about the taste, as it was just like the Cauliflower version of it. I know I won't make it again just because I detest the taste of Cauliflower and too much oil. But it gets a 4/5 for making everyone eat it all.

This is an awesome recipe.  You will not be sorry if you try this recipe. The whole family loved it.  My daughter asked if I would make it everyday!      I will say though I left out the onions as my family doesn't care for onions (I do and bet it is even better with onions) I also added salt and pepper to the mix before frying. Like the other reviewers it didn't take no where near a full cup of oil.  Maybe 1/4 a cup.

4.5... I don't even like hash browns (or onions) and these were great...  Crispy on the outside and creamy in the middle.  Added salt, cracked pepper, garlic power, parsley, and paprika.  Used 1/2 c.  sunflower oil.

I love these!  They are easy to make and sooooo good!  They remind me of the hashbrowns I used to get at a local restaurant that is now closed.  I make them so often that my husband has affectionately coined them "Honey's Famous Potatoes"!

Just like the ones at the diner! I used 1/4 onion, instead of 1/2, and less oil. These will be served to hungry festival crowds!

I really liked the concept of this method, so I tried the recipe as written... I found the hashbrowns way too greasy for my liking, and not very well seasoned. Even with a food processor, it seems awfully laborious considering the results. I still like the idea of the ingredients and the method, but in the future I'd season the mixture before cooking and seriously cut down the oil.

Wow, this is a great recipe. My husband LOVED it. I did two things differently: (1) I peeled and cooked the potatoes the night before (20 mins), then refrigerated, then followed the recipe the next day as written (2) I added salt and pepper to the mixture, before cooking.  Delicious! Thanks!

Fabulous, fabulous, just fabulous! The only adjustment I made was that I took Helen's tip on microwaving the potatoes first before mixing in the remainder of the ingredients. That insured that the potatoes were dry and semi cooked. This is certainly a recipe to add in my family cookbook.

Great quick recipe. I made it for 2 people. I assumed to grate potato with skin on. I had to use 1 egg although it stated 1/2. To compensate I used 3 tablespoons flour. I used 1/2 onion instead of 1/4.  I added 1/8 teaspoon of pepper. It came out to be 6 round hash browns the size of your palm. I am eating it as I type! Nice texture and really yummy with or without ketchup.

See I didn't know or think to rinse and drain the grated potato, aside adding other stuff to it too. These came out cripsy on the outside and soft on the inside; just like a diner.

I never made these right. These were really crunchy and good. They would have lacked flavor, but I put in a good dash of salt, garlic powder and onion. If you have a gas stove five minutes on medium high per side is way too long. 3 minutes on medium is good. Thank you for awesome technique for ultimate crunchy hash browns!

Yummy!  I used less onion and used a blend of oil/butter just to coat the bottom of the pan.  One tip:  You can use a potato ricer to 'wring' the water out of the taters; it works like a charm and no messy towels involved.  I make this all the time for breakfast.

WOW! I have never been able to get hash browns to come out right, but thanks to Emily I finally have. I also made some bacon in the pan and poured out most of the grease--be careful because the bacon grease is much more prone to spattering. I used less grease/oil than the recipe says. I had to reduce the heat to med. to keep them from browning too quickly, probably because of the bacon grease. This is a really great recipe!

This recipe was good, a LOT better than any other hashbrowns I have ever tried.  The only reason I gave it only 4 stars is because mine got a little burnt on the outside, didn't stick together very well and were hard to flip... most likely since this was my first attempt it was user error because the taste was good.  I did add ground red pepper to the flour before mixing in with the potatoes because my boyfriend likes things to be spicy. He LOVED them even though he's not big on hash browns.

These were delicious!  I had to lower the heat a little bit on mine, but I was cooking on an ancient electric stove.  I added a little cheese and garlic to the mix, and I also added a little butter to the cooking oil.  Thanks very much for a great recipe!

I made these for Christmas breakfast and they were DELICIOUS! I seem to always have problems making hashbrowns come out right - but these were perfect and yummy.  My husband told me they were the best he's ever had. I ommited the onions for my kids - and made them in single serve "pancakes".  I will always make these!

This recipe was Great!! For all of you that said these were bland, that is because you did not season to taste!! Emily did explain to season with "salt and pepper to taste".  That means to your preference!!!  As with any recipe, you can always use seasonings that you prefer!!! This will be my staple recipe for hash browns!

I was looking for a hashbrown recipe to have with some german style roast pork and sauerkraut.  I decided to give this receipe a trial run this afternoon to see if it would work out.  Half way through making the hashbrowns, I realised I had no egg.  I tried to think what else I could use to help bind the hashbrows.  I added about 1/2 cup of grated cheese.  I also added paprika and a sprinkling of dried mixed herbs.

I was very careful when frying them making sure they stayed together.  We ate them as a snack with tomatoe sauce.  Everyone loved them!  Will definetly be using this receipe again!

Although, I did one variation; I diced up some turkey breast, (you can use the sandwich sliced turkey breast,) and added it to the mix when combining everything with the potatoes and eggs. You think it would burn, but it adds a tiny bit of meat flavor. Yummy! Thanks again!

These are very similar, if not identical to patatoe latkas (patatoe pancakes). These do come out very well, though I would suggest adding some salt and pepper into the batter for some flavor. And A LOT less oil. I used under 1/2 a cup and still had to drain oil out of the hash browns. Otherwise, these are awesome. Thanks

I will never buy the frozen kind again.  These are so much better!  The bags of frozen hash browns are over 2 dollars.  A ten pound bag of potatoes is around 3 dollars.  You can make alot of these delicious hash browns with a 10 pound bag.

This did not turn out the way it says it should or else I did something really wrong.  It turned out like mush and had to keep adding butter so it wouldn't stick.  Maybe I need to dry the potatoes better?

Turned out perfect with very minor adjustments! Used 4 medium reds, just a handful of finely chopped onion, lessened the flour to just 1/8 cup, used just a few Tbsp's olive oil, a big 12" nonstick skillet, buttered the top side before flipping, and cooked them for approx 10ish minutes per side. They were great!

Mmmm, these were good!  I substituted Bisquick for the flour because I didn't have any flour on hand, and they worked out just fine.  They were nice and crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and really tasty. I will definitely make them again - although, I might add more seasoning to them next time and see how they turn out. (Maybe some paprika, salt or garlic salt.) Oh, and they were easy to make, too.

These are excellent hash browns - great taste and
easy to make.  I don't really care for fried foods,
so I only used a very small amount of oil to fry
them in and they turned out perfect.

My son wanted hash browns, so I tried these.  I substituted gluten free flour so I could enjoy them, too, and they came out great!  I din't measure the oil; I just put a little in the bottom of the skillet.  Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe.

My husband and I made these hash browns together.  The only change was shredding the potatoes and onions together in our food processor!  We had two large perfect potato patties with the recipe for four servings! Delish!

Great basic recipe, made as called for, will adjust to my taste later but overall a good starter for anyone who loves hash browns. Learned that you have to make it the way it is published first before changing to see if it meets what you need and this did. Thank you for posting

No changes, but I offer a process tip: Put the rinsed but web shredded potatoes in a salad spinner. This works beautifully to get out the water, leading to a crispy result. You might lose a teaspoon but the vast majority awaits, and it is SOOO fast!

This is a great recipe! I don't normally like to change a recipe but I didn't have as much time so Instead of shredding the potatoes I just diced them up really small. It helped with keeping the edges from burning. With the onion and the potato served with a little ketchup, this was so good!!!

These are very good hash browns.  Make sure you don't put more than 1/2 inch in the pan.  I made more than the recipe called for and put it all in one pan.  They were way too creamy in the middle.  I did not use the oil.  I saute my onion in a couple of tablespoons of margarine first and then added them to the potatoes.  Sprayed pan with Pam and added potatoes.   Very good recipe.

Lovely recipe. Just what I was looking for. I had Yukon gold potatoes so I used those. Used just enough oil to cover the bottom of my pan. I had to cook a bit longer than 5 minutes on each side but that's not a complaint as that could've been caused by the type of potato I used. I also seasoned my potatoes before frying them. I will definitely be making this again!

Made them twice in 2 days and will definitely make again.  Crispy and not oily.  For those who find these too oily---It's more your technique and not the recipe's fault.   The oil has to  sizzle when u drop them in, if the oil is not hot enough the hash browns will  absorb the oil and not sear them.  You also can't have the pan too hot or they will burn and not be cooked in the middle.  So although the recipe calls for 1 cup of oil, it depends on how big your pan is.  You only need a thin coat of oil in the pan,  they shouldn't be swimming in the oil.  A cast iron pan works great for these.  After I dropped  them in, I gently pressed down on them with my fingers to make them a uniform thickness.

Love this recipe. It is the best recipe I have ever used for hash browns. Here are the changes I make: After rinsing grated potato I then squeeze out the water and pile in the center of a dish towel that I then twist and ring out the excess water. I also use my fine grater and grate the onion rather then chop. Everything else I do as written in the recipe. My husband thinks these are better than what we get out when we go to breakfast.

Fantastic recipe!  Subbed a bunch of spices for the onion, easier.  Used seasoned flour, garlic powder, onion powder, dried mustard, pepper, seasoned salt, cayenne.  Topped with a fried egg.  Great for an easy brunch!

First time trying hashbrowns from scratch and the hubs said he'd like them again, they turned out pretty good.  

I think I will try to get the potatoes drier next time by using a cheesecloth or kitchen towel to wring them out instead of just my hands.  I think they would have fried better that way.

I will be making these again for sure.  I think adding some other things would be fun to try, too, like grated cheese or diced ham, tomatoes, chilis, etc.

Excellent texture and flavor!  Rinsing the potatoes is key, and I didn't add any other spices,  except a little leftover bell pepper. Hot sauce is a great condiment!

I cooked this the night before because I never have time for a home cooked breakfast. I then warmed them in the oven the next morning while I fried up some eggs. They where very good. But very greasy. I did exactly what the recipe said but next time I'll read other reviews and try diffent approaches. I still really like this recipe and don't think I'll look for another one.

Was hoping to find a hash brown recipe like this. Best I've ever had! Might experiment next time with adding veggies like jalapeño and red pepper to give a nice kick. I made medium thickness patties and didn't use all the oil the recipe called for. I  turned my griddle to 350, cooked about 7-10min flip, same flip, then crisped to diners liking. Essential to season right after removing from oil so seasoning sticks well.

This recipe was great! I followed it to a T, with some small changes. Instead of flour, I used no flour. Instead of an egg, I used no egg. Instead of an onion, I used no onion. Instead of a cup of oil, I used 2 tbsp. I have two picky roommates and they ADORED this! Thank you Emily!

They turned out great. I added salt and pepper to the mix and they were very tasty. I did burn the first batch using the 5 min time suggestion; I have to learn how my new stove and new pans best work together, but the second batch were close to perfect. I may try to add green pepper next time to give them more of a home fries taste - but they were great for my first attempt. =)

Adding an egg and perhaps even the flour makes for a potato pancake or latkes… If you shred the potatoes, season and then lightly dust with flour, you'll enjoy a nice dish of hash browns. Before serving toss in some cilantro and a couple tblsps of water to create steam and cover… without the flour an even more authentic, crispy hash brown. However, this is "Emily's Famous Hash Browns" as printed.

Since we did not have an onion we added bacon and sweet mini peppers. I cooked the bacon to near perfect then diced up as small as we could. Chopped up the peppers, and then tossed bacon and peppers into the pan for a little saute. After we mixed it together followed the rest as shown. Came out great. Will be making this again

We make these hash browns at least once a week, usually after a long night of indulgence. We do add some slices of fresh peppers if we have them though. Also, adding a slice of cheese to the top on the final flip is highly recommended!

Finally I can make hashbrowns that don't fall apart!!  I made these tonight and they turned out great.  I added cumin because, for some reason, cumin and potatoes just work so well together.  I also used peanut oil to fry them in -- that's what McDonald's uses for their fries, which is a big reason they're so delish!

What a great recipe.  My Grandchildren love hashbrowns and ask for them almost everytime they visit.  My previous attempts never turned out this good.  They also love garlic mashed potatoes so the last time they were here, I made this recipe using garlic infused oil.  Yummy!!

5 Stars!  When trying a new recipe I always try to follow the original the first time and then make adjustments the second or third time.  My husband loved these hash browns, absolutely picture perfect.  Next time I make these I am going to try adding diced sweet peppers, salt and pepper to the mix maybe a little bit of garlic.  I used very little oil.  I believe the trick is HOT oil in the pan so the potatoes don't get oily.   I've tried making hash browns but never with this success and flavor.

My family loved this. I also substituted the potato for Zucchini and made Zucchini hashbrowns. Works good too and probably better for you!

FOUND- the Holy Grail of hash browns!   Thank you Emily!!!   I followed the recipe as written and plan a few changes next time to add shredded cheddar cheese and bacon plus a bit less Smart Balance oil. There was a teaspoon full of oil left after frying up 1/2 package of frozen shredded potatoes. I washed them and dried them thoroughly before mixing with the egg, onions, and flour.  Can't wait to make this again.

OMG! I didn't even realize how easy this is!! Really I am giving this five stars just because it is SO easy to make. I always thought hash browns were so hard, and either bought them freeze dried or frozen. This is so much healthier and better for you. I've tried this as the recipe is and it's awesome, BUT...it's so much better if you...

1. Caramelize the onions with some chopped garlic.
2. I add a little cayenne pepper, because it gives it a little kick. 
3. I have substituted wheat flour, corn flour, the whole bit and honestly they taste a little different, but not different enough not to use it. 
4. No matter how big your potatoes are, the ratio of flour and egg is fine. If you don't have enough potatoes, it comes out more like a potato pancake, but it's still REALLY delicious. The hubs, a hash brown snob, LOVES it either way. That's saying something! :)

Finally, this is a GREAT recipe, because it's to your taste. In my rotation for SURE!!! :)

This is almost exactly how I make my potato pancakes, but I use minced green onion and less oil/grease... so if you're looking for potato pancakes this is a great recipe.

Make sure you don't skimp on the oil - otherwise it will be sticking all over the pan.  Great tasting, but pretty darn oily!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were incredible! I added a dash of cayenne pepper to the flour mixture, and everyone ate every last speck. They didn't come out greasy at all, so its possible the reviewers that had problems with the oil might have used a little too much or didn't let it heat in the pan long enough. Using cooking spray is a great alternative if you're worried about grease, though, as someone else suggested. I will definitely make these again!

I thought this was an excellent recipe and will most certainly make them again. I gave this a 4 rating because it is somewhat time consuming. I made a single serving for me while time was not a factor, but if I was making this for a family of 4 or more, time would be a factor considering prep and cooking time.

Excellent! No more slimy potatoes!  I used more potato. Leave the skin on the potato, it tastes great!  Minced bell pepper can also be added.  Swiss cheese is surprisingly good on this too.

My hubby likes hash browns & this is such a simple recipe that I had to try it. The first time i tried this about a month ago, it was a disaster as the mixture wouldn't stay together due to the egg. Plus i didn't cut the potatoes fine enough so that was a waste. Yesterday evening (i thought i'd make them and then just heat them up in the morning), i left the grated potatoes aside to have dinner & they turned a horrible brown colour - yuck! I threw them away! What a waste! I was still determined to make these hash browns! So after dinner, I grated 4 small white potatoes, i didn't rinse them; just let the juices fall through the sieve and then squeezed the excess juice really well. I finely chopped 1/2 a small onion, added 1/2 tbsp of flour, i didn't add any egg, added salt, pepper, 1/4 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp chilli powder and mild cheddar cheese (followed another reviewer). I made them into small patties, well i made them kind of rectangular, and since i couldn't be bothered to fry at 9:40pm, i grilled them for 20 minutes. My hubby said they looked good. I had them this morning and they are very tasty! My hubby was short on time, so took the rest with him to work. Next time, i'll make them into round shapes (i'm not particular but wasn't satisfied with the shape!) and add spring onions for colour! I gave it 4 stars because I omitted the egg and it's part of the recipe. Such an easy recipe that i remembered the ingredients without referring back to this!

My husband made these this morning and they were really good!They are a lot like a recipe I use for potatoe pancakes. I agree that less oil is needed then what the recipe lists but other then that the recipe is fine as is. I would make sure that the raw potatoe is rinsed well and that they are dried off with paper towel well before frying. We will definately be using this recipe again.

Great recipe! I can never cook hash browns right but this recipe is so easy to follow and so tasty- I added garlic powder, sea salt, ground peppercorns and bacon = Yumminess! I think next time I may add cheese for some variety or just leave it as it! so easy and with a food processor is a snap!

Great hashbrowns that come out crispy. I added some garlic and was glad I did. The mention that you don't need so much oil is true, I used just enough to cover the bottom of the pan, and this still cooked crispy without the mush on the inside from excess oil.

These are absolutely fab!  They are crispy on the outside, tender on the inside.  I sometimes adjust the amount of onion depending on my mood, and I also season them right when I put them in the pan.  It is our new favorite for hash browns.

These were okay- I thought they were really greasy; maybe I did something wrong.  I also thought that they lacked a bit of flavor.  I would put salt and pepper into the mix BEFORE frying.  Also, the onion taste was really strong- I think I'd leave them out next time.

To solve the grease issue, I might try baking them or grilling them next time.

I added salt, pepper and minced garlic to the mix before I fried them. Fried them in a large cast iron skillet and didn't use as much oil as called for (only about 2T). Tthey worked out just fine.

My hubby made this for us for breakfast for dinner tonight & they were awesome! We've never made hash browns before, we usually either buy frozen ones or make home fries. This was WAYYYYY better than any frozen hash brown I've ever had! So tasty & pretty simple to make once you have them all shredded, that was the hard part! Definitely will be making this again :-)

I've always wondered how to make great hash browns. Now I know! I made one big one, cutting it like a pizza to flip it. This recipe is perfect as is, I'm sure, but I used Morton's season salt instead of onion because hubby doesn't like onion. And I melted just a little gouda cheese on top when it was done cooking. OMG, yum!

These were absolutely delicious. I only had one potato on hand and it still made plenty for four. I didn't use nearly as much oil just a couple of tablespoons and they turned out just fine. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the great recipe.

I have made these hash browns twice already, and they are delicious! The only change that I make is to add a little extra flour to the mixture to help the mixture become a little stickier. Also, when I make them they don't pull together and hold a patty-shape very well, so I mold them into the shape of a patty on my spatula and then carefully slide them into my frying pan. They taste great, and my husband is constantly asking me to make them!

Great hashbrowns.  I added salt and pepper to the potatoes and sprayed a non stick pan with pam and melted a bit of butter to keep it a bit healther than frying them in oil.  Great basic recipe theat can be modified to make it your own in a million ways

I am a novice cooker.... and truth be told, I am really just gettin the hang of frying...  That said, I think I had my oil TOO HOT.  My potatoes were awfully crispy on the outside & only where they were really thick were they nice & soft on the inside... 
I WILL TRY AGAIN!  I WILL NOT GIVE UP SO EASILY

Fantastic!  I have been trying to eat vegan when possible so I took out the egg and added 2 tbsps of cornstarch instead. They turned out perfectly and were so tasty. Adding chopped mushrooms and a slice of vegan cheese on top made them even better!

These were really great!  1/4 cup of oil is plenty.  To get them crispy, make sure the oil is hot so the potatoes sizzle when you put them in the pan.  Cover with a tight-fitting lid for the first 5 minutes, leave them uncovered after you turn them.  Perfect every time!

These were good, but not really all that.  The amount of onion is disproportionately high, and I think it would make more sense to shred the onion since the potato is shredded.  And 1 cup of oil is about 5 times too much oil, at least for my Calphalon Nonstick pan.

Just what I was looking for.  Crunchy and a simple recipe.  Only change was that I added some onion powder instead of the chopped onion, since we don't like strong onion flavor.  My husband really liked it and that is all that matters to me!  :)

Finally - a hash brown recipe that stays together when you turn it!  I used an 8" non-stick omelette pan and made 1/2 of the recipe at a time.  I am definitely making this recipe whenever I want hash browns.

Very easy, delicious and versatile! I have added  different ingredients @ various times to make a new taste in hash browns. Don't be afraid to experiment. Examples of additions are cheese, sausage, seafood, crumbled cooked ground beef, and canned corned beef (leave out the salt for the corned beef). Definitely does not need an entire cup of oil.

Made this in a pinch after band practice for a late supper.  I had no onion, so I mixed in a bit of Parmesan cheese for some sort of flavor.  I also used frozen hash browns, so I added a bit of milk for some additional moisture.  In a sad attempt at making this humble dish an entree, I doused them in hot sauce and piled on the jalapeños.  They turned out better than when I typically make browns.  This seems like a FOGIVING and SIMPLE method to producing tasty spuds.  I'm thinking next time I'll use fresh tates, mix in some ham, peppers, and onion finally, finishing with some melted cheddar.  The flour/egg combo creates a good binder, so I think dressing up this dish with veggies would be a cinch.  Enough ranting, but this recipe has given me faith in hash browns once again.  Fail-proof hash browns, GREAT RECIPE!

These are SO easy!!!! Don't let shredding your own potatoes scare you from this recipe! I did add garlic salt & pepper and some garlic powder to the recipe to give it some extra flavor. I mixed these together and let them sit in the fridge for 1.5 hrs, I do NOT recommend this! They became very wet and I had to ring them out before cooking them. I used MUCH less oil than called for and they tasted GREAT! Will make again!

These potatoes are a good starting point. There was something "off" about them. I don't know if it was the flour or egg. It might have been the vegetable oil instead of bacon grease. I will have to play around with this to get it to my liking but all in all it was a good, simple recipe. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was perfect and the hash browns came out delicious, golden brown, and crispy.  I read the reviews and some mentioned an oily taste,  this usually means the oil is not hot enough when you put the  food in.

This recipe calls for way too much onion, flour, and egg. If you reduce these amounts, you'll get a nice mixture that fries up to golden brown on the outside and soft on the inside. You also do not need an entire cup of oil. I probably use a few teaspoons and that's more than enough. If you use an entire cup of oil for 2 potatoes you'll have a greasy, soggy mess. I have to give this 3 stars because I never would have thought to use flour and egg, and that's a great trick. I make my hash browns with seasoned salt, cheese, and a little onion; and cook each side for about 5 minutes.

Really good recipe. I took another reviewer's idea and put the shredded potatoes in boiling water for a few minutes (no more than 2 or 3 probably) and then drained them and squeezed as much water out as possible. I also added salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika to the mix before frying and fried them in just a little bit of olive oil. Next time I'll probably just use cooking spray to fry but I found this to be a great basic recipe that allows for the cook to add as they want to make the recipe their own. Will definitely make again.

I drained my potatoes after shredding and then added the ingredients plus cheese. I also salt and peppered the mix.  I cooked these flat like pancakes on a griddle and they cooked in only a few minutes per side.  Delicious.  Thanks.

I made these once before with very sub-par results (I suspect I didn't use enough oil in the pan), but my family wanted hash browns today, so I tried them again.  OMG.  It's past 2:00 in the morning right now, and I'm STILL getting hungry just thinking about them.  Luckily, I already ate them.  :)  One thing I think may have helped this time is skipping the rinse portion.  We had already washed the potatoes thoroughly, so after grating them I merely squeezed out excess moisture and mixed in the other ingredients.  To die for.

As per Helen's review, I microwaved on high for 2.5 minutes after drying thoroughly.  Added 1/2 tsp. onion powder and 1/8 tsp. garlic powder to the flour instead of the med. chopped onion. Added a small amt. of olive oil and butter to a griddle and cooked like pancakes, approx. 5 min. per side.  These were so tasty! Everyone liked them and they were very easy to make. Thanks!

Pretty good!  Do NOT fry these.  Put them on a pancake griddle, and cook them like pancakes.  I didn't even use any oil.  Way better for you, and good.

In making a double batch, I added about 1/2 cup finely diced green pepper to the ingredients listed.  I also sprinkled both sides with paprika.  For best results, go easy on the oil - it cooks and browns perfectly with just a little.

I made these too thick the first time and they came out mushy but the flaor was excellent.  I made them thinner the second time and they were perfect.  I did not pre cook the poataoes at all but they turned out just fine.

These were awesome potatoes. I doubled the recipe and was STILL surprised at how far 4 medium potatoes could go... My kids gobbled these up. Gonna add some fresh rosemary next time. Yummmmm. Thanks for a great recipe!

WOW...THESE ARE WONDERFUL!!!!!!! All I did different was that I used IDAHO potatoes (which don't seem to suck up as much oil, they are great for frying ). Also, I seasoned mine with season salt and powdered garlic. I definitely will make these again and again and again!!!!!

Amazing, I needed a recipe to help my husbands basic "grade it and fry it" and it is simple but effective! I agree that it needs salt and pepper but the onions are wonderful in this and give it a great flavor.

Great way to whip up hash browns, but written as is, this recipe is bland and requires serious spicing up according to your tastes- garlic, onion or chili powder, cayenne pepper or red pepper flakes, for example.

These turned out great!  Can't understand the person who said they would not stay together as I had one big "pancake" in my pan.  I had to cut it to get it apart.

I scaled down the recipe to make enough for just me for breakfast, and it was so easy and delicious! I used a Yukon gold potato, 2 tbs. of egg substitute, 1 tbs. flour, and salt and pepper. I fried it in a combo of butter and oil (sorry, arteries!) and it came out crispy on the outside and soft and yummy on the inside. 1 potato definitely makes enough for 2, especially if you have eggs or something with it.

These were good but I felt that they could have used something extra. I'm not a huge fan of a lot of salt so it would have been nice to add some herbs or something to it for a little extra taste. I only used a couple tablespoons of oil as well.

First attempt at making hash browns - not bad!  Mine turned out more like potato pancakes than hash browns but still tasted very good and were very easy to make.  i'd try them again - maybe use less flour next time?

We're on the quest to find the best hashbrown recipe.  I thought this one had great technique - the rinse and drying are critical.  It was a tad too flour-y, but that's my fault...probably due to using smaller potatoes than recipe called for.  Next time, I'll reduce the flour and egg.  As always, I finished the 'browns in a 400F oven to ensure it was thoroughly cooked.  Overall, good recipe.

It could have been something I did, but these hash browns were not only bland (and in need of more spices) but also too greasy.

This recipe deserves 5 stars. I think the egg really helps do the trick here. My potatoes were baked and refridgerated over night before I shredded them so I didn't use much flour, just a sprinkle but they held up nicley and browned beautifully!

I really wouldn't call these hash browns - they were more like latkes (potato pancakes) - but they were delicious.  I added salt and pepper to my mixture before cooking so that they would be seasoned throughout.  Thanks!

This is the hash brown recipe that I have been looking for. I made them for my wife and she said that they were "better than restaurant style". The only suggestion that I have is do small batches when frying. I started out with a handful size of potoato mixtue in the pan to try it out, then gradually increased my batch size each time...and it turned out that the first (smallest) batch size was the best. Fried better. I think adding too much in at once cools the oil down too much which leaves the hashbrowns greasy.

Perfect just the way the recipe states! Be generous with the salt and pepper though. "Haystacks" do not fall apart, just be sure you preheat your oil. You can top these with sour cream, applesauce or ketchup. Delish!

Tasty.  Mine came out slightly dry - I used only about a quarter of the oil called for after reading other reviews - but should've used more - either lighter on the flour or heavier on the oil next time.  I also salted mine while cooking.  Good recipe, I just need to fine tune for my style.

For me they came out more as a potato pancake, but the taste was still good. Was hoping for for all the shreds of potato to be crispy. Oh well - I will fiddle around with the recipe and see what I can come up with.

Next time I will precook the onions, then add them to the potato mash.  The rest was very good and easy to prepare.  A nice change from plain fried potatoes.

This was terrific! I've always been challenged when making hash browns at home even the frozen kind. This recipe works like a charm. I also discovered a use for those annoying little potatoes that come mixed in with the 10 lb bag. Just scrub them and drop them 'peel and all' through the feeder tube of your processor to shred. Prefect!

I love hasbrowns but I've never had success with making them at home until I found this recipe.  It reminded me of a cross between old fashioned fried potatoes and tator tots.  Just wonderful.  I followed the recipe exactly, adjusting the oil amount for the pan I used.  I covered the whole pan with the potatoes and they fried up so nice and crisp I was able to flip the whole thing.  They were so good my husband and I were practically licking our plates clean.

Just made these! Yum! You definitely do not need that much oil, I just covered the bottom of the pan & some, maybe 1/4 in. Next time, I may try shredding the onion as someone said or putting in a little less. Also add some spices like garlic powder or just more S/P. Thanks Emily!

I was reading through the reviews of this basic but fool proof recipe for delicious shredded hash browns and noticed sullys review about them coming out super greasy.

It is very important to have your oil very hot but not smoking or so hot that it will blacken the potatoes... It can take a few tries to get it down as far as being able to tell the right temp but if the oil is not hot enough they will come out saturated with grease just like anu fried food would when not cooked correctly.

REALLY GOOD for a 1st attempt. A simple recipe I can make from memory. i ended up topping them with a little mozzarella, next time i will add some cheddar to the mixture before cooking. won't make hash browns any other way! edit* on a 2nd batch i made little piles instead of a super hash brown, i much prefer them smaller, more crispy!

This was a great recipe to serve as a jumping point for me to come up with a variation that was loved by my whole family. I used red and green onions and a bit of spicy shredded cheese. I used maybe two tablespoons of olive oil total. The results were smashing! Thanks!

These hash browns were fabulous!  My family loved them and I'll be using this recipe a lot!  I wouldn't recommend putting the potatoes in the oil loose because they can burn really quickly.  They are really the best when they are in clumps because they are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  Delicious!

Very nice.
Bit to much onion, will use less next time.

I stuck the rest in the freezer.
Pulled it out 2 weeks lager, nuked them for 2 min and then put them on a dry pan so they would not be as soggy.
Came out very nice.

Love them.  I add chopped scallions, the green parts look nice and taste good.  I also serve with homemade applesauce.  Cut up apples (skinned) and put in sauce pan with little water and sugar to taste and it will boil down a little. Yummy!

These were the best hash browns I've ever made.  Next time I might add a few more spices, but they were good as the recipe was written, but with less oil.

This is the first time I have ever been successful with hashbrowns.  I have always wondered how to make them like restaurants do, and now I know the secret!  I'm not a very good cook, but both times I've made these they've turned out perfect.  Awesome recipe!  By the way, I left out the onion and they were still great.

Good, and could have been better I'm sure had I not subbed whole wheat flour for the AP. I used just enough oil to barely coat the pan.

A very nice recipe.  I added a teaspoon of paprika to the mixture.  It gave the potatoes a very nice flavor.  I served it with salmon.

Made some nice hash browns! But 1 cup of oil or 1/4 inch of oil is beyond excessive. Luckily, people will notice that right away. ****

YUMMY!  My whole family enjoyed this one; even my very picky daughter.  I used 3 medium sized Yukon gold potatoes, and only a couple of slices off a whole onion, which gave it plenty of flavor.  I salted it once it was done.  I added lots of pepper to mine which I love on hash browns.  Definately a keeper!

I made these this morning and they were very delicious.  I fried them on a pan with just a thin layer of olive oil.  No more than that is really needed.  It's not as if they turned out dry.  They still had the greasy texture.  Very yummy with added salt and pepper.

These turned out really good.  I ended up cooking them too long, thinking that they weren't done yet because they weren't very brown, so they were a little too crunchy.  They weren't greasy at all - I think the other reviewers who had a problem with oil probably didn't have the heat high enough on the stove.

This recipe introduced me to a hash-brown technique that I was unfamiliar with.   I think that they are a little greasy.  After I take them out of the pan, I try to blot them with paper towels.  It helps a little.

...Just made these hash browns..my 12 yr old said too much onion, which I agree..next time will reduce onion by at least half.  Also, cooked these in bacon grease since I had just fried some, and used a cast iron skillet on med heat for aprox 3 mins on each side.  Med-hi heat would have been too much.  I made 4 sm hash browns rather than 1 lg and added garlic salt and parsley to the salt and pepper for seasoning... Other than the few things I mentioned these were good and will probably make again.

Best Hashbrowns ever!  Followed recipe to a T...used olive oil.  I didn't even put tabasco, ketchup or anything besides the salt and pepper mentioned.  Excellent taste.  I cooked them quite a bit longer than suggested, until they were almost like cakes...but they would still break easily and were golden brown.  These hashbrowns rock the house!!

My husband and I enjoyed these, he put cheese and hot sauce on his.  I would definately consider these more of a potato pancake than hash browns though.  I made them as a side dish with London Broil tonight and know I will make them again.  Thank you.

So much easier than home fries and just as tasty.  I like this recipe because it was quick and easy and didn't require cooking the potatoes before shredding them.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Delicious! I made them as individual "pancakes " and everyone loved them. I added salt and pepper to the mixture before cooking. While I didn't use the amount of oil called for, you definitely need to ensure there's enough oil that when you turn them, the other side is in oil, not in a dry pan. The oil also needs to be very hot when you put them in - they need to sizzle! They're  easily reheated on a medium heat in a frying pan coated in cooking spray. I used them as a side with pork chops and apples but am also adding these to my brunch offerings. Great with sour cream and/or apple sauce.

Delicious. Very easy to make. Everyone in my family loved it except the 6 year old! I added cracked pepper to my serving. I also finished them off in the oven to ensure they were cooked through as I was cooking the rest of them. Would be nice served with bacon!

Mine turned out ok but the taste of oil was overwhelming.  Next time I will not use that much oil.  I notice at restaurants, they fry their hash browns on a grill and use little oil. In any event, we were very disappointed.

It was fantastic, and loved by all.  I have never gone through the extra "work" of rinsing and drying the potatoes, but this, along with the added egg and flour was a true hit!!  It will be made quite often since these would go with ANY dish.  Thanks for sharing the receipe!

I've never had luck with home made hash browns until now! I think next time I make this, I will lessen the flour, and season potatoes before frying. I used a cast iron skillet and shortening for cooking, and had no problem flipping in one piece. I also used a salad spinner to soak, rinse, and dry my potatoes. It worked great!

Very Tasty. I did add the bacon to it. I also put enough egg into it to make it more like a pancake. I am also lazy so I used frozen hash browns. Thawed them out, dried them out and then put in the micro for awhile to get out any moisture. Beware of the grease. Just coat the bottom of the pan.

Great proportions. I suggest adding more seasonings to your liking. Cook time was off for me but maybe my cast iron skillet got too hot too quick. I do suggest reheating leftovers in an air fryer or even finishing cooking in an air fryer to remove some of the grease.

Not worth the effort. I found them to be a little on the bland side and too greasy for my taste. If I try it again I’ll use red potatoes.

I covered the pan with the potato mix.  It cooked evenly, browned, and tasted really good.  This is thicker than plain hash browns.

These are the best. The trick is to get the oil nice and hot, so the potatoes sear and don’t soak up the grease. Delicious hash browns.

Great recipe for quick-ish hashbrowns. I did find them a little oily, but pretty sure I could remedy that using a different pan so I don't need as much oil.

They were pretty good.  Not too hard to make. I used maybe 1/8 inch of Avocado Oil and they were still fairly greasy.  But they tasted good.  I didn't have Olive Oil, maybe that would have been better.

Best hash browns I’ve made! Only change I made was adding garlic salt, because we love garlic on just about everything.

Nice recipe for a Sunday Breakfast! Made sandwiches with home made Tuscan sausage patties and a sunny side up egg, everyone enjoyed this and the hashbrown patties were nice and crispy! I replaced the flour with crushed pork rinds to drop the total carb content.

Great easy recipe, I did however find the onion a little loud for my tastes. Secound time I cut back the onion and increased the amount of shredded potato, turned out fantastic!

Didn't get crispy at all, and ended up turning out more like potato omelettes than hash browns unfortunately, which I think is down to not having proper measurements of ingredients (my idea of a "medium potato" might not be the same as someone else's). The ratios for the ingredients definitely seemed off while I was making it, but with no indication of whether the mixture should be runny or not, I really wasn't sure, and I've never had luck with hash browns so wasn't willing to trust my instincts on this one and add more potato/flour. Won't be making again, I'm sure there are more precise recipes out there.

Made the recipe exactly as the video except I used just enough oil to coat the bottom of a cast iron pan. Came out great , crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I'll experiment using different spices next time. Definitely a keeper.

I've been making these for years via my own recipe. I don't use egg. I usually make one very large one then break it up. The key to making these real crispy is to use a cast iron skillet and get it very hot. making it even in size so it's easy to turn. instead of oil you can also try butter-flavored Crisco. it always comes out very good that way. to skip the work of the potatoes you can just buy Frozen hash brown potatoes and no you don't need to defrost them.

Did anyone else find this to have too much egg? I know it was just one, but for some reason, I could see a bit of the egg cooked, almost like an omelette...I found it it be a bit cardboard like for my taste, but my hubby said it was good. Any suggestions welcome :)

when I made it I chose to substitute the diced onions with 1tsp of onion powder. I also diced and fried a few slices of bacon which I added to the potato mixture. the grease from frying the bacon I used to fry the hashbrowns

I agree with the posts regarding the oil.  Way too much and if I were to make this again, I would also shred the onion.  I would also add more seasonings.

This was my first ever attempt at making hash browns. I was shocked that they came out not only edible, but delicious! I added a bit of garlic powder and parsley flakes, otherwise followed the instructions to the letter.

Loved this recipe, it was easy to follow and my hash browns turned out beautiful. It was a little greasy but I threw mine in the air fryer for about 5-8 minuets and that helped, along with placing them on a napkin after.

This didn't work out for me. After this recipe I realised that the potato should've been boiled before fried- this recipe doesn't explain that. Frying it immediately made the potato undercooked and grey.

I might try less oil next time, not that the hash browns soaked it up but because I think it is unnecessary to use a full cup.

just adding a tip, as these are greasy. Better substitution for the AP flour is ground matzo crackers with a pinch of fresh chopped rosemary, cooking with clarified butter, brushed onto a waffle iron...and spooning some of the shredded potatos in an even pile, into the preheated waffle iron for crispy, even cooked potato goodness. Serve with some homemade herbed butter...

It was ok. More like a potato pancake than hash browns. I’ll try it again but omit the flour to maybe get a more hash brown like.

I like the recipe and the outcome, but I feel like the egg to potato ratio is a little off so would recommend two big potatoes or three medium sized ones instead of two! I also put my salt and pepper in with the mix before cooking and that worked out way better in my opinion. It was quite oily so I'd use less, or even maybe try it without oil at all. 

Overall, would make again.

Waaaaaayyyy too much onion! Destroyed what I thought was going to be an amazing side with eggs and toast.  Although crispy on the outside and done on the inside, the onion ruined it :(

These are fantastic!  Like others, I’ve made a few runs at making hash browns, but they never turned out.  With this recipe, I was able to get the flavor and texture I was looking for.  This will be a routine breakfast potato at my house from now on.

Great recipe. I took other suggestions and just used enough oil to grease the pan and they came out fabulous. I sprinkled a little cheddar cheese in the mix, but not a lot.

While delicious, this is NOT "old-fashioned, restaurant-style hash browns", or any type of hash browns as that dish is not patties held together with egg and flour.  I made these over a dozen times before I ever saw this recipe here.  How?  It was my late mother's recipe for LATKES--(Yiddush for potato pancakes as one reviewer's dad correctly called them).  The exact ingredients in the same proportions with the same preparation down to squeezing the potatoes, with the tiny exception that she put the salt and pepper in the batter instead of on the pancakes in the pan.  The pancakes  are better eating because in simple hash browns, the potato shreds (with salt, pepper, onions optional) are all separate as they fry soaking up much more grease than the pancakes do. German Jews introduced these to the U. S. and it is still a traditional Channukah food, so it would have been nicer to have given us credit. We served them with sour cream as several reviewers suggested, until people became cholesterol conscious so we switched to applesauce. 

Seems you taught over 1000 people who never look at Jewish holiday food recipes to do perfect latkes.  Perhaps you'll put up a "stewed sweet potato side dish" (tzimmes) recipe as well.  For the readers who are not afraid of looking at Jewish holiday food recipes, tzimmes is a yummy, cold-weather special occasion dish with familiar European flavors and there are several top rated recipes for it already up.   Enjoy!

I will make these again. I used frozen grated potatoes  because I was in a hurry. I brought them to room temperature  in the microwave and then used paper towels  to get rid of the excess water as suggested. The bacon bits sound like a good idea that I will try next time. A dollop of sour cream added an extra flavor boost.

I loved the simplicity of this and the pre-soaking in cold water does a nice job of making the dished less 'starchy' and crispier.  Shredding is a breeze with my Cuisinart.  After soaking them I let them dry out in the colander. I was out of onions ?? so I added a tsp of onion powder and garlic powder with the flour and egg.  I used coconut oil and it added a great flavour. A 10" skillet did the trick and after 5 min cooking, using a dinner plate as a cover, holding it on with an oven mitt, I flipped the whole patty over, put the skillet back on the burner and gently slid it back in to brown the other side. Used some seasoning salt to finish it off. Excellent

These were the perfect hash browns.  Rinsed the potatos about 4 times, then spun in the salad spinner.  I added a crushed clove of garlic and they were absolutely delicious.

I love these!  I have made them twice now.  I use as little oil (or bacon or sausage fat) as possible,  2T.  for about  1/2 inch thick shreds in a  12 inch fry pan.   Pepper, garlic and onion powder, parsley, and any other spice I think would taste yummy.  3 1/2 - 4 min. each side. Med to med high heat. I also cover during first 3 minutes.  Crispy and delicious!

So simple but very tasty.  I will back off the onion a bit next time or use scallions instead.  Will add some diced bell pepper too.  My husband said "make these again".

These were the best hash browns I've ever made.  Rinsing the shredded potatoes keeps them from turning brown and reduces the starchy taste.  I only added salt, pepper and garlic powder into the mixture.  I fried in a small amount of oil and butter.

These hashbrowns came out perfectly--just like a restaurant's! Thank  you for the recipe, as I had tried to make them on my own without instruction and it ended up a huge fail. My husband and I loved the way they turned out and just how easy it was to make them. Not to mention...you just need a few basic ingredients. Thanks!

Fabulous! Will use a bit less onion next time. The recipe is great but it's hard to get right. I've made them 3 times already and am nearly there. Make sure your oil is HOT before putting them in. Also make sure they are cooked thoroughly before removing them from the oil.

Better than just drying hash browns because of the flour & egg. You need to soak the potatoes & dry completely otherwise we thought they still tasted starchy. Hubby will make again.  10/28/2017 - These are better each time  hubs has made them.

I've never made hash browns from scratch and these were FANTASTIC! Definitely helps to squeeze the excess water out of the potatoes so don't skip that step. I added Seasoned Salt to the mix before cooking which added a little additional flavor. My husband loved them, and he's very picky about hash browns. Thanks for the recipe!

Loved it.  I used a spiralizer instead of grating to save time and clean up.    Will microwave the tater spirals a few minutes the next time, since they were a little crunchy, and then follow recipe.

My husband and I are of Polish descent, and our families have been making these for years!  We call them potato pancakes and pan fry them in canola oil.  They are delicious!  The only difference is we top with a dollop of sour cream and/or sprinkle  with salt.  You can also top with a spoonful of applesauce.  Yummy!

My review is largely based on the fact that this was touted as a healthy version of hash browns and it very much isn't. In fact, this is not as healthy as the hash browns I make that aren't even trying to be healthy - they take way more oil, I don't like the added flour, and egg is OK, but largely unnecessary.

Just made these for Christmas Breakfast and they came out great!  We used a little less oil in the pan, and will use less next time as well, but they cooked up well, and taste great (sampled some, eggs being cooked right now!).  Thanks for a great recipe.  I had never had luck with hashbrowns before today!

Great recipe! My first hash browns that I've made, the only ones I've ever tried before were from Waffle House so I'm not so sure if that's good or bad, but I would definitely take these over those any time, any day! One thing is that I need to practice a little more on how to cook them, but the flavor was delicious!

Best hash browns I've ever had. Very crispy. In my family my brother has been knighted as the best hash brown maker, but if I made these for them, I would he appointed to Lord of hash browns. Don't want to hurt his feelings though. But definitely a recipe to keep in your back pocket for when the craving for hash browns take over.

I cut the recipe in 1/2. Only thing I would do differently next time, is a tad less flour. 
Suggestion: Serve with a side of sour cream .. yum!

I used this recipe as a base, used a sweet potato rather than russet and used part masa (corn flour). I also added chile powder, paprika, and sweet corn. It turned out amazing. Will keep this recipe to use again as is because it is a good, solid recipe.

These were amazing.  They even reheat well, staying crisp in the microwave!  We used the leftovers to make breakfast sandwiches with bacon and a fried egg.  Delicious.  Thank you for this recipe!

I didn't realize till after I made this, they were more like potato pancakes than hash browns. When we think of hash browns we think of mcdonalds. The family liked these but all agreed pancakes not hash browns.

This was a great recipe.  You can use a little less oil though.  I covered the entire bottom of the pan but before I flipped them, I cut into four pieces which made it easier to flip.  This is the only time I have ever made hash browns worth eating!!  Thanks!!!

My husband was asking for "real" hash browns, so tried this one.  It was good, but way too much oil for us.  I will try them again  with just a thin coating of oil in my nonstick  pan instead of 1/4 inch as the recipe called for.

I used Yukon gold potatoes and a mandolin slicer. 5 minutes on one side and 2 1/2 on the other made them nicely done on medium heat. They turned out nicely golden and crispy. Will use this recipe for hash browns from now on.

So good and super easy.  I added a whole medium onion and just cooked these in a bit of coconut oil (that's the only changes.)  My family ate these up and loved them.  A good recipe to add what you want to these to make them just the way you like.

Outstanding!  My bland old hash browns are a thing of the past.  Made these to go as a side with a smoked roast beef and family at the hash browns before the roast!

I didn't care for the flavor. I don't know why but the way they cooked was really bad, they had a lot of burnt batter.

This  is an excellent  recipe for diner-style hash browns at home. Having made these twice today, I can attest to the importance of getting all that moisture out of your rinsed potatoes. Our first batch did not quite make the mark because while I did squeeze them out in a potato ricer, I did not actually wring them out and pat them dry. I would recommend using the potato ricer first and then further patting them dry and squeezing out any residual moisture (in batches) with paper towel. We also used significantly less  oil; really just enough  to cover the bottom of the pan. I'm not sure if it was the moisture issue, but our fist batch was in a cast-iron skillet and our second in a nonstick and the second was much crispier. Thanks for a great recipe!

Followed the directions exact minus the time to fry the "hash browns". 5 minutes each side is way too much, they'll probably burn if I did! I doubled the recipes and tried the first one so we can adjust seasonings. They LACKED flavor! So we added garlic powder, a pinch of Cayenne , paprika and more salt! If you are making these, just make sure you add these seasonings and do not fry them 5 minutes each side..They brown really fast! I had the temperature on medium low and they cooked about 2 minutes on each side.

Great recipe! I didn't have onion on hand so sautéed some green pepper and garlic.  Cooked bacon right before so just fried them in the bacon grease on the griddle. A little decadent but yum!

Perfect recipe! First time I made this, I don't think I followed directions exactly, and it didn't turn out great. This time I followed it precisely, and they turned out perfect! brown and crispy on outside, potatoey and soft on inside. If you follow the directions exactly, you will not be disappointed.

I made these for Easter brunch and my dad (who is very picky) said that these were the best hash browns he has ever had! I recommend frying them in the same pan you cooked the bacon in if you are having bacon for breakfast/brunch along with it. It makes them even better!

This is a solid hash brown recipe.  I made as directed.  So much more can be added to this (personal preference tastes) so I will start with this base and add what I'm feeling that particular morning.  Thank you for the recipe ym.

Have been trying for a long time to make hash browns, or rosti potatoes. From other reviewers, it seems that using too much oil is a problem. Next time I make this will try a light spray of canola oil only. Used about 1/4 cup of corn oil and these took forever to cook and were either crisp or soggy in spots. Still like overall taste...might add a bit more spice, not more salt....maybe a touch of paprika.

I followed the recipe, substituting a vegan alternative to the egg, and adding the salt and pepper to the batter. 
I also grated the potatoes into a bowl filled with water, then rinsed and strained them according to the recipe. 
The hash browns came out perfect! Nice, golden crispy exterior, and a soft, chewy inside. 
Great recipe!!!

Rinsing isn't necessary-too hard to dry .
I only use enough oil to coat the pan not 1 cup.
It makes 6-8 cakes. Cooking 5 mins each side is perfect & they slide right out of the pan. I highly recommend this recipe.

This was awesome!  The last time I tried to make hash browns, they didn't turn out very well.  This was super easy though and much less time consuming than the previous recipe I used.  My husband and I loved the onion in with the potatoes.  Yum!  Definitely don't use a whole cup of oil, that's way too much.  More like 1/4-1/3 cup will get the job done.  I will definitely use this recipe in the future.  4/10/16:  To prevent the hash browns from burning, add a little more oil when you flip them and turn the heat down a little bit.

I used slightly less flour and no oil. I cooked the bacon first and fried the hash browns in the bacon grease.Sprinkled some Mrs. Dash on the hash browns while cooking. I used four potatoes and made ten hash browns. Great recipe. Will make again.

Yummy!  Made some bacon prior to making the potatoes and then fried the potatoes using the leftover bacon fat in the pan. The amount of fat was much less than 1 cup and added great bacon flavor.  I also  added a half onion and yellow bell pepper when shredding the potatoes.  Turned out great!

I live abroad part of the year and the ingredients available to me are very basic. This recipe saved me when feeding my son who only eats Dunkin Donuts hash browns for breakfast! I made it in a non stick pan with just a little oil and I shredded with the skins on to keep the fiber content intact (it wasnt clear in the recipe if skins on or off). it was a big hit!

These weren't bad, but more like a pancake-hash brown hybrid than a typical hash brown.

I substituted the potato with sweet potato and added a dash of cinnamon. My family really liked it but i  thought it was only okay. I can say my hash browns stayed very crispy hours after i made them which was great.

I'll make my hash browns like this from now on. I made my hash browns into little patties which made it easier to cook. I did not use a lot of grease either. I tend to use some bacon grease when I'm making bacon with breakfast and it gave the potatoes a little more flavor. Thanks!

I have to say this didn't turn out well. The potatoes burnt before the insides cooked...I don't know what I didn't wrong, I have the hardest time with hash browns.  The unburnt part was flavorless.

FINALLY, I can make hash browns from fresh potatoes! Delicious. The only thing I'd change is to use less oil because they came out a bit greasy and use maybe half the onions. I skipped the pepper and then added Cholula sauce, and it was fantastic!

Thank you for this great recipe! I just got done making them and they are delicious! I'm afraid that all I had was large fresh potatoes, so I have enough for tomorrow's Sunday morning breakfast also. Just enough egg and flour to hold them together and you get the wonderful taste of the potato. I did add the salt and pepper in the mix before cooking but that's all I did different. Wonderful!!

I have tried several different hash brown recipes on this site and this recipe is by far the best, easiest, and yummiest. I found I did not need too much oil. About a tablespoon was enough to get both sides crispy and the inner had an almost smooth texture. The best!

Awesome - I used ener-g egg replacer instead, and I could tell that it would have been the same with the egg too. The texture was great! crispy outside - soft inside - just like my favorite restaurant hashbrowns! Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

These hash browns are absolutely delicious and I don't even like hash browns.  I used gold potatoes and they were crisp on the outside and firm on the inside, just like everyone says. I tried to make hash browns years ago and remember a failure, these were so easy - sure to become a family favorite.

We tried this one with relatively high hopes.  While it wasn't bad, it was relatively taste free, which should have been obvious from the limited ingredient list.

I just made these for my boyfriend and I... I made his first he said they were okay and not enough potato... that they were kind of weird... then I ate some  from the second batch and I thought they were good! They were very easy to make and better than I thought they would be maybe I shouldn't rinse them out with water.. I thought that was weird.. I don't think I will make them again though because he didn't like them.

These were wonderful!  After reading the reviews, I soaked the potatoes for 10 minutes, boiled them for 3-5 minutes, and rinsed them thoroughly until the water ran clear to remove the starch.  If you don't remove the starch the hash browns will burn very quickly.  They came out absolutely perfectly.  Thank you so much for a great breakfast.

This was an excellent cross between potato pancakes and hash browns. Made this for my very finicky mom and she loved them.  I will definitely serve these during holiday family brunches, yum! Thanks

The only thing I'd change about this recipe would be to add some shredded cheddar cheese, salt, and pepper. I used a potato slicer to shred the potatoes so they ended up more scalloped than shredded, but the potatoes stuck together nicely and got a nice crisp outside!

I would give these more stars if I could...yummy, crispy and easy!!!  I have been on a quest for how to make a perfect hashbrown that isn't soggy or loose and these are neither.  Totally a hit and a keeper!  Thanks Emily!!!

Great restaurant quality recipe! The first time I made it, I had a hard time taking the uncooked mixture and forming it into 1/2" thick 'patties' - mine were way too thick. So I browned them on both sides anyway and when I tried one, the middle wasn't cooked through all the way. To 'fix' it, I cut them in half (not into semi-circles, the other way) and then browned the uncooked sides. They turned out perfect. Thank you!

Great recipe!  Kids just love them for breakfast.  I make smaller patties of hash browns rather than one large patty and I resist the temptation to turn them until they are really done frying on one side.  They turn out crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.

Not sure what went wrong, but they didn't taste like any of the hashbrowns I've ever eaten.  They ended up tasting more like the oil than fried potatoes.  However, I saved them and mixed them with ground beef and shredded cheese for dinner, which was much better than by themselves.

Ok, I have to start with a little honesty - I don't like hash browns.  My boyfriend, however, DOES, so when he asked me to make them for him this seemed like a pretty simple place to start.  I am SO GLAD I decided that!  These are the BEST hash browns I have ever eaten, and they were SO SIMPLE to make!  I did omit the onion b/c I am allergic, and I used the little red potatoes because I love them (about 3 cups shredded, if you wondered)  Neither of us is aware of ever having had hash browns with egg in them before but it was amazing!  One egg didn't make them "eggy" it just held them together nicely in the skillet so they could brown just perfectly.  Thank you for sharing this beautifully simple recipe, which now has pride of place in my YummySoup!!

I LOVE hash browns- when they are cooked correctly. These were delicious!  I used red potatoes instead of russet, and cut back on the onion. I made them on seperate occasions for my brother and my boyfriend, and they both wanted more. This one is a keeper

Good, but they took forever bc I made small patties instead of one large one.  I think I'd make one large one next time.  The mix does look like a coleslaw mix like someone else mentioned, but once you cook them on the one side for 5 minutes they are fine and they do stick together.  I didn't use oil but used a spray of Pam.  As a result, they didn't get as crispy nor as uniformly brown as others did, but that's okay by me.  They still tasted pretty good.  As for the comments about them being bland:  I've never had a flavorful hashbrown--that's what ketchup is for!  I added Old Bay to a few of the last ones and I prefer the ones without the Old Bay.  Thanks for the recipe!

Much better than store bought hashbrowns.  I really liked the consistency and crispiness but thought it lacked flavor.  Definitely needs more spices.  Will make it again with some added flavor....Thanks for sharing.

I did not think this had ANY flavor. I even added some garlic salt with parsley, onion powder, a bit of paprika and some onion salt. My family ate a couple of bites and the portions left ..... went in the trash.

I really like this recipe for hash browns.  It's different from my other recipe I use (and have subsequently lost).  I only used about 1/4 cup oil instead of the 1 cup the recipe called for as I figured it would be too greasy.  Next time I think I will add a little garlic and some cheese.  Good recipe you could do anything with.

Used a golden potato instead of russett. Turned out as I expected. Didn't fry in 1 c oil, but rather about 2 T and did it's thing. Because I didn't use that much oil, it didn't get crispy, but it will need the salt "to taste" like anything, or serve with ketchup.

This was my first time making hash browns and I think this is a great base recipe. I added more seasoning then the recipe called for and it was still a bit bland. Just gotta do a little experimenting to find out what works best for us.

I finally found my hash browns recipe! My fiancé and I have both tried to make hash browns in the past and unfortunately, they never came out the way we like them. Crispy golden and yummy. We tried this recipe exactly as written and they were PERFECT.

Absolutely delicious and soo easy! My boyfriend has started requesting them!  I eyeballed the oil but I know I used nowhere NEAR a full cup.  It was probably more like 1/3 cup of oil.  Make sure it is really hot before putting the potatoes in.  This will keep them from absorbing a lot of the oil.

This tastes great! The only thing I would change next time is to use less onion. It was a little too much for me. I also seriously downsized on the amount of oil. I only used enough to evenly coat the bottom of the skillet (less than 1/4 cup). They weren't too greasy and were perfect. These are some of the best hashbrowns I've ever made.

I only used half the onion since my daughter is not too fond of onions....but these were a huge hit....including the kid that does not like onions. Like a previous poster.....I put the salt/pepper in the hash mix. I squashed them pretty flat/had no trouble with the taters cooking through.

These are delicious.  It's a great recipe as is; the only change I made was to season the potatoes before frying otherwise the salt and pepper just sit on top of the hash browns.

Shredding was super quick in a cuisinart, just peel, cut in half, and 45 seconds later, 3 small potatoes were done.  This recipe does make quite a professional hash brown.  The onion flavor didn't really come through - it was hard to mix, they fell to the bottom, even though finely diced.  Loved this with ketchup.  This takes a while to cook however, but it's still a tasty recipe!

These were pretty good, but the cooking time you give is too long. for me, it took more like 3-4 minutes a side and turned out too brown. I also think it needs some seasoning added, but as a good general set of instructions for how to cook hash browns, it worked for me.

We thought this recipe was ok... other than my 4 year old daughter; who would not touch it; said exactly 'hash browns yuck!'; but they went down alright for everyone else.  Did seem to be missing something; though; not where near what they sell in restaurants.  Grated the onion; as well as the potatoes; fried in just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan to decrease the oily taste some said about; but still; I will be looking for other recipes to try; this one was ok but nothing spactacular at all.

sooooooo good i used 4 goldon ukon potatoes and garlic instead of onion but this is by far the best recipe i have ever used anyone can do it.be sure to rinse shredded potatoes well and in ice cold water it will help with sticky or gluey factor.better than any restaurants.if it doesnt have enough flavor use some garlic salt or more salt n pepper

These came out wonderful!  I flattened them our in my cast iron skillet and added oil to the pan when needed to fry them.  I added garlic powder and a little oregano as one reviewer did and it was great.  Will definitely make again!

Great recipe! It came out wonderfully! Thanks for sharing this! I tried so many different hash brown recipes and this one is by far the best! I made it with oil and I tired it with bacon drippings. Both were great. Thanks again!

It's important to note that the consistency of the mix will be very wet, like coleslaw.  I kept adding flour thinking I should be able to form a loose pancake shape, but the end result was VERY dry.  Stick to the recipe.  Otherwise I added garlic salt and served w/shredded cheese and they were great.

I doubled the recipe, using a combination of white and sweet potatoes.  This was my first time making homemade hash browns. I'd recommend not covering the whole pan because they are too hard to flip without everything coming apart. Mine came apart completely, so I lost the nice crisp edges that other reviewers raved about. Also, it might have a nicer flavor with butter in the pan instead of oil. Next time, I'll use butter, and make pancake shapes in the pan for easy flipping.

Oh, the secret of perfect hash browns has been revealed!  I never could make good hash browns; mine were always super greasy and terrible.  But these are so yummy, so delicious, that my husband cries out for them everytime we make a 'country' breakfast.  They have an excellent flavor, they stay together very well, and are nice and crispy on the outside.  Be sure that your frying oil is hot enough, though!  Easy to get impatient and toss them in too soon.  Then you'll end up with soggy, greasy hash browns.  I test the oil by making a mini 'test' hash brown before adding in any more.    You will love these!

YUM!!  I have never made hashbrowns before.  This recipe was super easy and mine didn't turn out greasy at all, I did press them good between paper towels to get as much oil off as I could.  My husband loved them and will definitely make them again.

Came out delicious.  Not difficult at all to grate the potato by hand, it was my first time.  I will make this all the time rather than buying the frozen hashbrowns.  Taste much better and I always need to use up leftover potatoes.  I added my seasoning to the mixture before cooking and added only about 1/4 of an onion and still tasted wonderful.  Thank you for the good recipe!!

Loved these!  I cooked it in one big piece in the pan, flipping in quarters as directed.  Next time I will try adding the salt and pepper directly to the potato mixture.  My family thought they tasted remarkably like latkes (potato pancakes eaten on the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah) which is a great revelation since our latke recipe isn't as simple as this one.

These were excellent and will definitely be making again.  I added about 2 tsp. of minced garlic and used much less oil, I think the original calls for too much, about 3-4 tbsp. worth.  Great hash browns!

Excellent recipe - perfect consistency and great taste. If you fry these on a super-non-stick pan, you will only need a few tablespoons of olive oil, and the result is a much healthier dish.

I was looking for a fresh new way to make my hashbrowns and found it here! I doubled the recipe, used red potatoes and also added 4oz of cheddar cheese and these turned out awesome. Even my picky 2 year old gobbled these up.

After I shredded, rinsed and drained, I kept the potatoes in the freezer until time to mix and cook. I added about 1/2 cup grated cheddar and cooked in bacon grease. They were delicious.

My "hash browns" before now were not very appetizing. My husband claimed to enjoy them, but they weren't even in the same league as store bought or restaurant hash browns. This was fabulous! My hash browns aren't gray and nasty any more, and my husband admits that they are a thousand times better.

These are okay..  but they didn't taste like hash browns.. I could taste the onion more than the potatoes itself and I followed the recipe exactly. There's just something missing.  I don't think I would try these again.

This is an amazing recipie for people who have never made hash browns before. Since I didn't have shredded potatoes, I used a cheese grater and this worked perfectly. I would recommend using less onioins then half. I couldn't taste the actuall potatoe as much with all that onion. I used about a 1/4 of an onion instead. Other then that, amazing recipie!

These are great.  I found this recipe because I couldn't figure out why my hash browns (aka, shredded potatoes that I pressed together and put in a skillet) weren't very good.  This recipe is simple and really fun to experiment with (add-ins like pieces of bacon)

These were perfect as-is. And I like the fact that you can add any kind of seasoning you want to change the flavor a bit. Next time I might add a dash of Creole seasoning for kick.

WOW... these are wonderful!! I didn't cook them in a bunch of oil though, I just used enought to get them cooked. I also added a dash of Paula Deens house season to give it a little flavor besides onion!  Delicious!!!!

These were awesome!  I was in the mood for potatoes and didn't want make anything complicated that would involve going to the store for ingredients.  Printed off the recipe and was enjoying the best hashbrowns I have ever made just a few minutes later.  Great flavor and texture.  I did use much less oil than the recipe called for, but that was the only change.  THANKS!

Thank you, thank you, thank you.  I have made several miserable attempts to make homemade hashbrowns.  I followed the recipe to the "T" and they turned out great!  Crispy, golden brown and delicious.  No more store bought hashbrowns for me.  This was just too easy.  Again, thanks for sharing your "cooking secret" for these.

I put my unpeeled, grated potatoes right into a large sieve and flushed them with cold water, squeezing out the starch.  The only changes I made were to grate the 1/2 onion instead of dice and I used 1/4 cup egg substitute.  Yummy, crispy recipe!

YUM.  I am rotten at making hash browns and these are great!  I finally did it!  I added about 1/2 cup of green pepper and onion, chopped.  I also added a tiny bit of butter to the pan as well because I just needed it.  Everyone loved them!

Sometimes I laugh at the super basic recipes that can be found on this site (homesqueezed OJ, honey Butter, grilled cheese sandwiches, fresh lemonade? Come on!), but this time one came in handy for me since I never thought about putting egg in hash browns. No wonder mine always used to fall apart! Good thing this recipe was featured as a daily or else I wouldn't have ever looked it up myself. =) Thanks for posting a "dummy" recipe!

Waaay better than restaurant hash browns, with are notoriously soggy and BLAND. They must not put in the onion. I knew I couldn't eat all of the batch in one day, so I split it in half, cooked the first as usual, then intentionally undercooked the second half. I popped it under the broiler the next day to crisp it up, and it was almost as good as the first day's batch.

This recipe didn't really go over too well with our family. While I didn't find them all that time consuming, we thought the end product was too much like a potato pancake.  I think the frying in all the oil was a little overkill.  For those of you who are familiar with Waffle House, I was hoping that these would be comparable, but I think they need to not be fried in so much oil. Maybe with a bit of tweeking this could result in something more along the lines of what we're looking for.  Thanks for the recipe though :)

Yum!  Didn't use as much oil, just enough to cover the bottom.  Next time I might decrease the amount of onion though, as it was a little overpowering.

The only Hash Brown recipe you will ever need! Absolutely perfect. This was my first time making them and they turned out fantastic. Followed the recipe exactly. Prepared them in a single pancacke sytle in the skillet, then turned them over and cut into sections for serving. Got a rave review from my boyfriend! Can't wait to make them again!

Very good- don't let these get too brown or skimp TOO much on the oil... they get a little burnt. (but my second batch was much better!)

Yum!  I followed the recipe except using a bit less onion per our taste and using just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan.  These were great.  Thanks for the recipe.  Next time I might add some cheddar cheese.

Finally a hashbrown recipe my husband loves.  He will rarely eat hasbrowns but when I make these I even catch him in the fridge later eating them cold.  I didnt have any fresh potatoes on hand but did have one of those bags of preshredded potatoes the kind that arent frozen in the green bag and they worked just great!

fabulous.  I agree with the post about using less oil.  I also kept flipping the hash browns in the pan until they were crispy all over.  I wish this picture weren't posted here, as the picture is not at all how they turn out -- these are basically potato pancakes.

We used the leftover bacon grease from our breakfast this morning.  I don't think we had it hot enough though because the hash browns just soaked up oil instead of cooking at first.  These were better than the ones I'd tried to make previously, which only involved cooking grated potatoes.  I'll try them again, they have good potential.

Very easy and very good.  As others have stated, be careful with the amount of oil (you don't need so much).

I used seasoned flour and a little seasoning salt.  Used 1/4" of oil and will cut back on the oil next time.  I also put too many in the pan at one time.  But they were great anyway.

These were good, but I just wasn't in favor of the inside because it was somewhat creamy and tasted uncooked. I prefer hash browns that are crispy on the inside and outside. Probably the cooking temp. I used, but other than that it was pretty good.

these hash browns were pretty tasty.  my husband loved them for father's day with french toast and turkey bacon.  a couple of drawbacks; they were pretty greasy because you use a lot of oil and they're somewhat of a mess to clean up.  all in all i liked them but i rarely make hashbrowns and most likely i'll use a different recipe using less oil next time i make them.

These were ok. It took a long time for the center to cook through, maybe a bigger pan or 2 pans would've worked. I used a 10" skillet. I'm not sure why some people thought these were doughy or eggy????With just one egg and a 1/4 cup flour there was barely enough to coat all the shredded potato. Maybe my potatoes were too big.

We didn't like this at all.  It came out with way too much egg flavor.  I tried it again with half the amount of egg and it still didn't taste good.  It wasn't flavorful enough and I think it needs to be fried in butter rather than oil.

These were good.  My kids did not like the onion flavor that came through.  I'll try it w/o next time.  A nice treat.

Great recipe. I would add a little more seasoning next time though. Thanks, Emily!
