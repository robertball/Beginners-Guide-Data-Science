Nice and easy bean soup.  I added carrots and celery because we like them and it seems to add a little something more to the beans.

This recipe looks great! I actually tried something like this a while back, and this just brought back so many nostalgic memories, haha! I love cooking stuff like this. I always try to find new recipes on forums and I got great ones emailed to me from http://lovelyrecipesforyou.weebly.com and I genuinely enjoy them. Anyways, thanks for posting this dish, I really need to make this more often!

Thank you I really like this bean soup!! I did replace the neck bones with ham hocks and use cayenne pepper instead of the hot sauce.

I love this soup!  I go to Honey Baked Ham and purchase a hambone, they donâ€™t always have them, but when they do, they are awesome.  Just the right amount of ham is left in the bone and it has awesome flavor!
