I have now tried this recipe three times. I have been trying to duplicate the Savoiardi I grew up with in New York. The cookies are too spongy and the crispy outer crust that I remember is just not the same. Also, the flavor is almost, but not quite, as I remember.  The ones I grew up with had a distinct almond flavor to them.

I was disappointed in this recipe.  It didn't taste like the Savoiardi cookies from an Italian bakery and was closer to a regular ladyfinger recipe but more crisp.

I didn't like this recipe at all.  the cookies were burnt even after I baked them for the minimum time specified.  they were very flat too, even though I piped them on as thick as was told.  I ended up going on a search through grocery store to find lady fingers for a tiramisu that I was making for a potluck

Thanks for the recipe. They came out great and very tasty. Next time I'm going to make some with chocolate or almond. Thanks again.
