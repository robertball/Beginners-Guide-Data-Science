I have made a similar recipe for many years for Christmas Day.  I poke the whole cloves on an orange and place it in the pot with all the other ingredients.  I don't bring to a boil, I just let mine simmer in the slow cooker and remove the cinnamon sticks and orange before serving.  I also use apple juice instead of apple cider. Personal choice.  This is a Christmas tradition I started many years ago and I hope my children will continue the tradition when they are grown.

I followed recipe, except added a couple of cups of cranberry/pomegrante juice (100% juice, no sugar added variety) that I needed to get out of fridge because I needed the space.  
Also, I stuck whole cloves in the thin orange slices and floated them in the cider, which makes a pretty presentation.  Was wonderful -- even kids loved it -- I'll make this every year for Thanksgiving.

This was great in the slow cooker.  Due to all the pots being in use at my in-laws house, I just put everything in the crock pot to begin with.  Didn't get to bring it to a boil, so the spiced part wasn't as pungent, but this was still a great combination!  Everyone loved the sweetness of the pineapple juice which makes this taste a little peppier than a normal apple cider recipe.

So good!  Stuck it in a crock pot on high an hour before my party started and was perfect and ready for serving when guests arrived.  They loved it!

This was amazing!! I was a little unsure that it would taste to citrus-y but it was the perfect blend of flavors.  It wasn't too sweet and all the flavors blended together beautifully.  I did leave out the cloves because I do not like them.  Usually I get a recipe then tweak it, look for others, try those, and then come up with my own to perfect it.  This was really perfect as is (minus the cloves).  I don't think it can be improved.  Thanks so much, this is my new holiday drink.  At my party today everyone raved about it.

My mom made wassail every christmas for me growing up and this is almost the exact recipe she used, only instead of honey she used sugar.  Now that she is gone I make it for my kids every year, it has such a wonderfull tangy sweet flavor and so easy to make!

I didn't follow this recipe exactly. I used the cidar, honey, and orange juice (freshly sqeezed), but didn't have pinapple juice available. I put the cloves in a tied coffee filter, let the cinnamon just float in the drink, and I also put some orange wedges in there (they looked great.) This was actually kind of sweet for me, but the kids I babysit and my husband loved it!

I had wassail when I was young and have always loved it.  This recipe is exactly like what I remember, it's delicious!  I've made it at Christmas for the past 3 or 4 yrs and it is always a hit.  I like to stick the cloves into the outside of and orange and drop the whole thing in.....gives it extra flavor and you don't have to worry about fishing out the cloves. Also, I often put out a bottle of Apple Brandy with the cider which makes a great adult version.

This is a fabulous recipe! Even my sister, who isn't very fond of wassail, enjoyed this recipe. And it's just as delicious cold, and with a touch of lemon-lime soda.

Delicious! This was my first time making wassail, and it was very good. My guests asked for the recipe. I'm giving this four stars because I've never had wassail that wasn't yummy, and I don't think this was necessarily better than wassail that I've tried other times/places.

Good recipe.  It smelled wonderful simmering in my crock pot on xmas morning.  I didn't have cloves so I just added about 1/2 tsp of ground.

This brought back memories for the grandparents! We loved it. My 6-year-old daughter even liked to drink it cold because she doesn't like hot drinks. But everyone else drank it hot. It was great either way. I don't ever have cheesecloth lying around, but I at least should have strained the cloves out after preparing the recipe because some of them sank after they got saturated and then it is a lot harder to fish them out.

I thought this tasted good. A friend of mine gave me the recipe for the mulled cider served in colonial Willamsburg, at Christmas time, that I just loved. I thought I would try other spiced ciders and wassail punch to compare. It wasn't quite sweet or cinnamony as the mulled cider, with the brown sugar and ground spices, that I had tried using the Williamsburg recipe. This was more of a winter's version of a fruity punch.

So Yummy! I added 1/3 cup of lemon juice and 1/4 cup of red hots candy, just to give it some zing. I also let it simmer for about an hour and a half, which just helped to blend the flavors, and the whole house smelled fantastic. Everyone at the party raved!

This was very good and simple to make but I was personally looking for something a little warmer and spicier than this.  Something more like cider with mulling spices, etc.  Excellent for what it was!

This was a nice variation on traditional apple cider. I liked the citrus flavor added by the orange and pineapple juices. I received compliments from multiple guests!

This is amazing Wassail! I tried some at Biltmore Mansion in Asheville, where they were selling the spice mix. It was good however this is far superior.  A must have all winter long. I put it back in the jug and reheat the next morning. So delicious.

The recipe was great! Easy to make. I reduced all ingredients by half for just two people to have two full mugs each. I garnished with cinnamon sticks and an orange wedge studded with whole cloves. Just a great recipe for Christmas!

I have been making this recipe for Thanksgiving for many years, but have been lax in the reviewing department.  This is absolutely one of the best things about our feast.  I cook it on the stove and then transfer to a large electric coffee urn (only ever used for this purpose, so no residual coffee flavor) so it can keep warm and individuals can refill as needed.  Kids love it as well as adults.  We keep apple whiskey, vodka, brandy and/or schnapps nearby so it can be spiked, if desired.  All in all, a wonderful hot drink for every one!

I made this in the crock pot. First I microwaved all liquids to near boiling to get the spices to bloom more. Then I added the liquid to the crock. It just isn't spicy/flavorful enough for me. I like a sharper wassail. I'm just not sure what to do to make this stronger. I just added some fresh ginger slices to the mix to see if that helps.

Found this recipe to be pretty tasty and easy to make, BUT it needed a little kick.  I added 1 tsp of ground ginger, allspice, and nutmeg. I also cut a few inches of fresh peeled ginger and threw it in as well.  For presentation, I put the cloves in the skin of an unpeeled orange and dropped the whole thing into the pot.  I let it simmer for a few hours and it came out great.  I am going to make it again and top off each glass with German mulled wine and Port for an extra kick!

I've had wassail every year for Christmas since I can remember, and this is it! So warm and wonderful for those cold winter nights, especially in the northeast. For a little more toasty in your tummy, add your favorite gin, whisky, or apple brandy. Perfect!

I have been serving this hot cider at my annual Christmas party for years. It is delicious and so easy to make. I make it an hour or so before the guests arrive and this year I kept it warm in my new slow cooker which was much more convenient than keeping it on the stove in the stock pot. The aroma fills the house and puts everyone in a festive mood.

I looked for a few wassail recipes online and finally picked this one as the one to make and I'm so glad I did.  It is amazing and reminds me of my childhood.  Finally found our traditional holiday drink.  Exceptional - you won't be disappointed!  I followed the recipe exactly.  :)
