Tried this and was amazed. So quick and easy and absolutely delicious. While chicken cooked I microwaved side dish and in a half hour served dinner. In fact it was so delicious I went back and bought the garlic and herb to try. What is great is it gives you enough cubes to make several dinners.

Very good. We used the pasta we had-- whole grain elbows-- and extra chicken to up the protein.

This was amazing! I used the pasta we had on hand instead of penne. My mom doesn't care for tomatoes so I left them out but added red and green peppers for some color. Served with garlic rolls it was delish!

This was an awesome meal we did make a couple of additions but nothing drastic. Added some garlic and after saut√©ing the chicken we covered and cooked it for a little while longer to make the chicken fall apart. This has amazing taste!!!!

I cooked everything as directed. It is very fast and easy but the flavoring is so mild that i would want to add more of my own spices if I cook it again.
