This is what we call lacy cornbread in south Ga. It is a southern recipe that is supposed to be as thin as paper (almost) hince the lacy reference. Crispy on the edges and thin.  Very good if done correctly!!

Great flavor!  I love these because they don't need added sweetness, they are fine the way they are!

Too much liquid to make into pancakes as they do not hold their form. Suggest they add liquid to the cornmeal mixture up to the 1-1/4 c. milk to proper consistency.  This might be good for someone who can not tolerate gluten if adjusted. Also, definitely needs sweetening up either by adding sugar to recipe or pouring syrup on pancake.

I made these to go with beans. I really liked them but my kids not so much. I followed the recipe exactly. I'm not sure I had them thin enough but they were really good. I do think I might add just a tad bit more salt if I make them again. Thanks for the recipe!

The taste was very good.  This recipe can be paired with savory dishes or sweetened up to be served on their own for breakfast.

For my first go, I did sweeten up the batter with 2 1/2 tablespoons of sugar.  It worked well for a breakfast dish.

The only annoyance was that the batter was super thin and spread quite a bit.  It made it difficult to cook more than one cake a a time.

I agree with the other cook here who said the batter is too wet if you use all of the soured milk at once. I ended up thickening it with an extra cup of cornmeal and roughly 1/4 cup of all-purpose flour, which gave the results shown in the photo I posted. My star rating is for the recipe as it was originally written.

I had buttermilk so I skipped the milk and vinegar step. I soak the cornmeal in the milk for 30 min to 1 hr before adding the beaten egg etc, to reduce the grainy texture. I found I needed to make smaller cakes or they were too hard to flip. They cooked very fast even on medium heat.

These seem like a southern version of a French crepe but not as fragile!! Delicious flavor & easy to make!!
