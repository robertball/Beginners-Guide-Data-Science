I love this! However, I made a few changes which I think made it better and will help clarify the process. Instead of weighing the tomatoes, I used 12 cups of diced tomatoes, mostly because with less, the cup of vinegar I added to only 8 cups was way too vinegary for my taste. I used only one cup of brown sugar, left out the cayenne and added cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg. I cooked it down for 2 hours and canned 3 pints. The leftover half pint tasted great on fresh bread. I'll be making lots of this - it's absolutely delicious!

I had never heard of tomato jam before a friend mentioned it last year.  Found myself with way too many grape tomatoes some months ago and decided to try a few tomato jam recipes.  This one is a little too spicy for my tongue , but won a BLUE RIBBON at the State Fair this year.  And my hubby & guests like it.  There is no arguing with that kind of success!

This was my first attempt at canning, so I followed the recipe to the letter.  Awesome flavor.  The only reason I'm giving fewer than five stars is because my yield was only 4 half-pint jars instead of 8 (I may have cooked it down too much.)  I'll definitely make it again!

This is kind of bland.  I followed the recipe exactly, and really don't care for it at all.  If I planned to make it again, I would definitely add more sugar and probably some cinnamon and nutmeg too.  I expected it to be more like a relish, but it ended up tasting not spicy enough for a relish, and not sweet enough for a jam.  I have to say I was somewhat disappointed.

I had too many tomatoes this year so I decided to use them in this recipe, it turned out to be a nice flavour spicy tomato jam. 
The only thing is that I dobled the recipe and reduced the mix until it had a jam consistency and it didn't fill 7 pints, so... don't spect much from 3lbs of tomatoes.

I did a double batch with an extra # of tomatoes with the hopes of 7 pints, I got 6.  I like the flavor, but could have used more precise instructions as a "noob".  (This is my first time canning anything other than dilly beans)
I simmered for at least two hours.  Apparently, that was not enough as it is still too thin.  I thought maybe it would thicken up, but it hasn't.  (I guess that makes sense, nothing really in it to thicken, but just want to pass that on, in case someone else thinks the same thing) I took it off the burner b/c it looked like all the tomatoes were cooked pretty much to nothing, and I had the impression that it would stay chunky, it did not.
Also, I wasn't sure if I was supposed to just slice up a whole lemon or peel it.  I kept it whole.  I used one lemon for the whole double batch and I think that was more than enough, I can taste it clearly.  
Overall, I liked it and will make it again, except for boiling it down a lot more.

I was worried about the combination of ingredients, and even while cooking the "jam/relish," I was not certain how it was going to turn out; however, now that it's done, I'm thinking it's pretty near fantastic!  I took some suggestions by reviewers and added 1/2 of a finely chopped small Gravenstein apple, 1/8 tsp ground cloves, and 1/8 tsp nutmeg.  I did not pack the 1 1/2 C. of brown sugar, but because the jam was too vinegary-sharp tasting, I added another 1/2 C. of unpacked brown sugar.   It would be great with cream cheese, chips, chicken or pork.  It's worth the extra work!

I have made this recipe 3 or 4 times now and I love it.  I have used canned diced tomatoes and fresh tomatoes and it has turned out well each time.  I leave the skin on and it makes it a bit chunkier and still tastes good.  The recipe is very adaptable, I seldom have all the ingredients and have used different vinegars, apple cider instead of juice, etc.  I always simmer it longer on the stove than the recipe says so it thickens properly.

I like the taste but it turned out way too runny to use as a jam.  If you try to put it on a cracker it runs off.  I even cooked it for about 2 hours and was hoping it would thicken up when it cooled but that didn't happen.  I ended up experimenting with a couple of jars.  I heated the already processed jam and added some pectin, boiled it for a minute and now it's nice and thick.  I'll do this each time I open a new jar.  If it ever make it again, I will definitely use pectin at the end of the cooking down process.

I am not a novice. I have been canning for over 50 years! In my opinion this is way to much work and time . From the time your start your water to heat to steam the tomatoes until you put it in the jar(with the right consistency) it takes about 4 hours!!  Another 30 minutes to process, and now it's 41hours.I used 10 cups of chopped tomatoes and it yielded 5 1/2 pints.  I

Loved this recipe. Used dark brown sugar. Cooked a double batch for almost 2 hours. Only made 9 half pint jars and the last was not full enough to process. (Which meant that was to be set aside for dinner on fresh baked bread.) Also only used 2 1/2 small sweet lemons. Lemons took it to a whole new level, but I would not use larger ones. Only gave this 4 stars because the directions need to be adjusted for anyone making this for the first-time.

Yummy! This is a terrific recipe. We have plenty of tomatoes here in FL. and lemons. I questioned using lemons and tomatoes together and was amazed at how good they worked together.
I mixed cream cheese with the jam and served it as a dip. Four guests gobbled it up in an hour and asked for more!
I'll be canning this again but, this time, I'll make three batches.

So, after reading all reviews I combined some of the suggestions and made this fabulous tomato butter.  I used 5lbs of Roma tomatoes and 7 jalapeño peppers plus one large honey crisp apple. I added 1/2 c. Vinegar mixed with balsamic vinegar then added all of the spices per the recipe. Instead of brown sugar I used natural cane sugar and the lemon was puréed (food processor).  This was cooking for at least 3hrs.& during the last 1/2 I added pectin. Place small amounts of tomato butter on a cold

I just made this recipe, I got three pints from it. i had to cook it for about 2 hours, but it came out nice and jammy. after a nice taste of the sweetness of the jam, the cayenne pepper hits you with a nice touch of heat. I made this exactly as written, but with hard cider instead apple juice, because that was on hand.  I would totally make this again.

Deep flavor! My cherry tomatoes has a lot of juice. Even after cooking them down I added a Granny Smith Apple for the pectin. I also added 1 TBSP of red pepper flakes and a pinch of sage.  The apple thickened it up nicely. I pureed the apple after it was soft and returned it to the pot.  Can't wait to eat it!!!

I was looking for something to send my sister in law as part of a present and this fit the bill.  Like others I made changes and started by cutting the recipe in half.  It's a great condiment and I plan on having a jar available in the fridge this summer.  Great way to use up extra tomatoes from our garden.

I never got this to a jam consistency - it is more like tomato sauce.  The taste is really good, but it never "jammed/gelled."  I cooked it down to half, but still sauce, not jam.
If I try this recipe again, I would add pectin - the pectin in the apple juice wasn't enough to do it.

Spices were not intense enough. Used tea masala spice (clove,cardamon, pepper, cinnamon), in addition to those outlined in the recipe. Added double the cayenne and  substituted the cider vinegar with balsamic vinegar. Used dark brown sugar to give it a more caramel flavour. Used beet/apple juice combo, pumps up the colour of the jam. A good template to work from but as it stands too bland.

Really great recipe, really homely and fantastically tomatoey. I also questioned the use of lemon and was ready not to put it in as it tasted so good anyway and I didn't want to ruin it. I'm glad I did though as it takes it to a whole new level! Ran out of brown sugar so used half granulated, worked perfectly, though I later realised I had some more in the cupboard. I also ran out of vinegar so drained my pickled onion jar dry! Still tastes gorgeous, highly recommend!

Delicious! Family loved it. I grow my own tomatoes and needed to use them and was glad I found this recipe. It did take 1 1/2 hours to reduce but totally worth it. Christmas is around the corner and  this will make a great gift alone or in a gift basket. Thank You for reading, lisa

I used balsamic vinegar because it's what I had. I cut the apple juice and added a chopped apple. Love the combination of spices, reminds me of the sweet and sour meatballs my family makes at Christmas every year. I think this would be good with cranberry juice too. Might try a small batch to see. Thanks!

During my first batch, I became distracted and left out the lemon...second batch added the lemon...hubby said first batch was better. Overall I think it's important to take your time and reduce the liquid of the tomatoes until it is nice and thick.Had it for breakfast on toasted French bread with Neufchatel cheese, Very good
