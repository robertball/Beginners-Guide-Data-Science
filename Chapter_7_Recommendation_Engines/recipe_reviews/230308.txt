I only used 1/4 cup of pine nuts, and this was delicious!

This is really good.  The balsamic is a nice touch.  However,  it was a little heavy on the garlic.  I didn't mind it but others commented on it.

This was yummy. I substituted pecans for pine nuts because they were unavailable at my store. I found I had a bit of excess pecans at the end, I might just use 3/4 of a cup.

I also altered the ratio of cheeses  (adding more Parmesan and slightly less feta) based on what I had on hand. It worked just fine.

Tasted good, but so rich you’d maybe not have more than a few helpings. It wasn’t a popular choice at my party.
