I used garlic powder/onion powder instead of garlic salt/onion and I increased the amount of those AND the basil to a full teaspoon. Great on chicken.

Great rub! I used this on 5 large boneless chicken breasts and marinated overnight in the rub. I then placed chicken the crockpot the next day and cooked on low for about 6-8 hours. Shredded the chicken and added Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and had pulled chicken sandwiches served with slaw. Delicious!

Very nice rub with good flavor. I used this on a whole chicken and it helped keep the chicken moist and gave it a nice taste to the skin.

Excellent rub to make! Flavorful without the heat. I added a 1/4tsp cayenne pepper and 1/4 tsp white pepper. But the base recipe.... Wonderful
