10/23/19 UPDATE** I make these cookies many times over and always get compliments.  I usually double the batch, since they are a hit, and as written, the size batch is more suitable for an afternoon snack treat.  I sometimes add nuts, dates, and craisins/raisins.  they stay nice and soft.***Very nice!  Made the house smell wonderful baking too.  Used a gala(quite large one) and shredded w/the skin on for added color and nutrients.  Was interested how they would turn out with the proportion of oatmeal to flour, but they are so soft and moist!  Full of fiber.  Besides the 2 tsp. cinnamon, I added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg, and 1/4 allspice, and 1/4 cardamom.  All the spices complimented the other and none were overpowering.  Did not have nuts so omitted.  Made 26 cookies using the smaller size cookie scoop.  Not sure I will even frost them.  They aren't overly sweet and sickening.  Make sure you shape them up a little before putting in the oven; how they go in is the shape they come out.  Can fit alot on each sheet because they do not spread.  Very nice recipe!  **UPDATE:  I did decide to ice these.  Just stirred together some 10x sugar, milk, and 1/2 tsp. black walnut extract, and 1/4 butter extract.  They are now sooo awesome.  The icing does enhance the flavor of the cookie, and the extracts used are perfect compliments.  This will be my way to go w/the icing flavors for this cookie.  Just delicious!

This was a complete disaster. The proportion of oats was so high that the mixture was far too dry, and the end results tasted like baked porridge. I had to throw the whole lot away. I checked and double-checked the quantities, so I can't work out why my experience was so different from that of the other reviewers, but I certainly won't be making it again.

These cookies are so moist and delicious!  They were quick to make, nutritious and not too sweet.  Shredding the apple makes the cookies a little too messy for me, but if you chop the apple these cookies come out PERFECT!
I added a dash of cinnamon to my glaze as well, and they were fantastic:)  The whole family gobbled them up!

Absolutely Delicious! I added a pinch of nutmeg. These cookies don't spread out when you put them in the oven. The shape going in is what you get coming out. This is something that always baffles me so I thought I'd mention it.

Made these adding 1/2 tsp. ground cardamom (try it in your next apple pie) and a pinch of ground cloves. Added raisins and Hershey's cinnamon chips along with the walnuts. These cookies are to die for! Moist and sweet. I may cut down a little bit on the sugar next time.

These cookies are ugly, though, and desparately need the drizzled glaze. Make sure it's thick enough to be opaque and stand up a bit on the cookie. Then, these are nice enough to give away.

Wonderful wonderful cookies!!   I think I was a 
little generous with the cinnamon and vanilla..
to personal taste.. My golden delicious apples 
were a bit small so I used two.  I added a few raisins and some semi-sweet choc. chips.. and OH goodness!!!  
These are "keepers".. I mean "Eatters"!!  We'll make these again and again.
  Thanks for posting this recipe.

Quick and easy, not too sweet. I didn't bother peeling the apples--extra fiber, you know! I also added chocolate chips to half the batch--never a bad idea. A nice way to use cooking apples without the trouble of a pie.

My friends and I did a cookie exchange a few weekends ago.  These were voted the best out of 7 different cookies.  They were awesome, thank you so much for sharing. I'll bake these often.

This recipe is so tasty and it's healthy too!! My five year old son did almost everything when we made these. I made the mistake of making them for a family function, and now I am overwhelmed with requests! Highly recommended for a quick and tasty nutritious treat!!!

This recipe is incredible! I almost ate it raw because the "cookie dough" was so good! I actually baked mine longer (25 minutes or so) and made them into cookie bars. I also didn't shred the apple. I peeled it and cut it into little chunks. Delicious recipe!! Thank you!!

These are nice, moist cakey cookies that aren't super sweet. I did not use the walnuts (my daughter is allergic) and I did not peel the (organic Gala) apples. Doubled with no problems; added a pinch each of cloves and allspice and baked about 10 minutes at 350 convection. Used water, pinch of cinnamon, and vanilla for the glaze. Be careful not to overbake (dry) or underbake (fall apart) these. They look dry but not brown when they are baked enough. This is a good choice to get some healthy ingredients in a treat. I took some to a 4th of July party and they disappeared before the chocolate birthday cake! Great for a grab and go coffee treat, or in a lunchbox. They do not keep more than a couple days though, and stick together in the cookie jar. Overall I was very pleased with these and will make them again.

I just tried this for the first time - I just happened to have everything I needed.  These were very moist and easy.  To ensure the batter wouldn't be too dry, I added 1/4 c unsweetened applesauce to it.  They were great - my house smells amazing!  Two things: next time I will use granny smith apples for more flavor (I only had golden delicious on hand) and a past reviewer is right - they do NOT spread so be sure to flatten them a bit.  My first tray - the bottoms were a bit overdone and the tops were still a bit wet.  From there on out I flattened them out some and they turned out perfectly.

I liked these. I made 1/2 recipe today and got 19 cookies using a standard cookie scoop. The first batch took about 10 min to cook and the second about 8 minutes on a parchment lined baking sheet. I thought grating an apple would be a little difficult, but it was very easy to do. I may do it for oatmeal sometime. The ingredients list said butter, but than the directions mentioned margarine. So, I just did 1/2 butter and 1/2 non-hydrogenated margarine. It lowered the saturated fat anyhow. I followed the recipe but made them gluten free by using sorghum flour instead of wheat flour. They were still excellent and sorghum flour has a slight distinct taste over wheat flour. So, I can only imagine they would be even that much better.

I had apples to use and was tired of pie and wanted a good oatmeal cookie. These were really good. The only changes I made was I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 generous teaspoon of cinnamon (I love cinnamon). I did frost them. Thank you for a great oatmeal cookie recipe.

These cookies were great, but I added another 1/2 cup of flour to the dough because it was really sticky. Please note: THEY ARE DROP COOKIES! They are NOT cookies you can roll in your hands to make balls!

These are the best oatmeal cookies ever!  I added 1/4 tsp allspice and, instead of using the glaze, added butterscotch chips.  These have quickly become a family favorite, thanks for submitting!

These are quite good. I've made as written and have also made replacing half the butter with applesauce and noticed no difference. They aren't overly sweet on their own, so I wouldn't leave out the glaze.

So yummy. The icing makes all the difference. I did chop my apples into very small dice instead of shredding them.

I'm surprised at all the reviews saying these were dry, as mine came out ultra-moist, more like a muffin than a cookie.  They were tasty but I was looking for a chewier cookie, less cakey.  I'm in Germany though so I think the flour and butter are a bit different and that may have been what caused it.  Next time I'll halve the butter I think.  Good overall recipe, I did add nutmeg and had a heavy hand with the cinnamon, but I could've gone for even more spice.  I didn't glaze them as I found them to be plenty sweet without (but I also used a very sweet and juicy apple).

A new favorite!  The cookie is not very sweet, so a glaze really is beneficial. I followed recommendations from earlier reviews (press the cookies down as they do not flatten on their own, add raisins and a little allspice) then used a caramel glaze, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

I ran out of all purpose flour so I had to substitute a bit for bread flour, but they still turned out great!  I also cut up the apple into small pieces instead of shredding and added a bit of nutmeg and raisins.  After reading the reviews that said they came out of the oven the same way they went in, I took special care to shape them when I put them on the cookie sheet :)  No glaze needed as they were fantastic alone.

These cookies turned out wonderfully!  I'd only add that this recipe is great for apples that are softer than Granny Smith/good cooking apples.  I added diced soft apples (Fuji, I think) and then they ended up shredding partially when I mixed them into the cookie dough.

Tasty.  These cookies have a cake-like texture.  My one complaint is the order of ingredients in the recipe.  Eggs should be listed after brown sugar and butter.  Why?  Because I missed that one ingredient, my mixture wouldn't stick together.  But I had made these cookies once before, so I knew something was missing and added them at the end.  Perhaps that's what happened to the person who thought it was too dry and dubbed the recipe a disaster.  If you follow the recipe, you'll be pleased with the final product.

Hooray for Aunt Hazel!  These were delicious!  I made them to send in my kids' lunchboxes, so I cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup shredded zucchini to the mix.    They turned out great!  Will definitely be making these again, thank you!

These cookies are great!  I only did a couple of things differently.  One of which was I chopped the apple into small pieces rather than shredding it, and I just drizzled a bit of the frosting on.  These cookies are already so tasty that I think an entire coating of frosting would have taken away from it.  But the proportions of everything else are perfect!  I will most definitely be making these again.

Excellent.  To make it lower fat I used egg replacer ("better than egg") and also used 1/4 c applesauce and 1/4 cup butter in place of the 1/2 c. butter.  Delicious and more nutritious!

I really loved these.  I left out the walnuts (not a fan).  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly as stated, using Fuji apples (my favorite).  I ended up refrigerating the dough for a couple of hours before I could bake them (my own fault with scheduling). 

The result was fibrous and cakey/muffin-like, with sweet icing as a great balance to the not-so-sweet cookie. If you don't like sweets much, they're great without the icing, too (I know.. I checked!). =)

A cookie that Hubs and I both like equally is a rarity.  This is one of those rare occasions.  This is not a cookie I typically make - soft, oat-y, not something I typically enjoy, but surprisingly, I liked them.    I just hope they don't turn into hockey pucks overnight!  They're nice and apple-y, and the glaze drizzle lends a much appreciated sweetness.  The only thing I didn't like is that when they came out of the oven they were little poof balls, but a quick smoosh with the palm of my hand took care of that!  I made them as the recipe directs, tho' with butter rather than margarine.

Delicious, delicious, delicious. I took others advice and added allspice, and a little extra cinnamon.  These have a true guilt-free feeling to them.

I first tasted these straight out of the oven and wasn't so impressed.  But later that evening, once cooled, they were amazing!

made a healthier (aka not as tasty but good enough) version. used 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/2 c applesauce instead of butter, no walnuts (didn't have) and no icing. shredded apple, but can't really taste it. might try small chunks next time.

These turned out fabulous. I chopped the apples with skins, I used pecans because I'm in Mexico. Nutmeg and aged organic vanilla were added in both batter and icing, which is a nice touch. I didn't have a problem shaping them up a bit but they are a chunky type cookie, melting the butter a little in the microwave helps. I liked them a little more browned for crispness so baked them about 14 mins. They tasted better the next day as opposed to straight out of the oven. Oh! A little shredded ginger or powdered is a nice addition! Provecho!

Good if you're in the mood for apples in a cookies, would add raisins as well next time, but did not put the icing on them.  They were good and tasted healthy.

I replaced the butter with the applesauce to reduce the fat content and did 2 shredded apples instead of 1. Still very good and very moist. I was scared the applesauce would mess the recipe up but it gave it a great flavor! Wonderful and easy recipe. THANKS!!!

Not a perfect 5, but still very good.  Turned out quite moist and I did add the glaze (with some cinnamon added) and that did add a lot to the cookie.  I omitted the nuts and used 2 apples though 1 1/2 probably would've been better. Chopped one finely and shredded the other.  Added a pinch of cloves just because I like that when cooking with apples.

These were exceptional! Very moist, almost a cake-like consistency. I did have some variations. They were: 1 1/2 cups oats, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg (along with the cinnamon, not in place of), and omitted the nuts for a little more apple. I also kept adding 1 tsp. of milk at a time to the glaze, along with a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg. I thought the recommended amount was not runny enough for drizzling. HOWEVER, I am sure the original with no variations would be just as excellent. Mine was changed because of personal preferences. Def. making again!

Would have made a lot more but was eating up most of the dough LOL! Yum! Just wanted to comment on the spreading as two reviews I read mentioned that however they looked before you put them in was exactly what you got when you took them out. I Have my first batch in the oven and they are spreading out just fine; not too much but just enough.  I used margarine instead of butter if that makes a difference?  Also didn't shred the apple but chopped pretty finely.   Well just took first batch out and I do declare!  These are pretty dang good without the icing even!!  Thanks!

These were heavenly. I followed other cooks' ideas -- added nutmeg and cloves, and just chopped the apple with the peel left on. I used about a 3-1 ratio of butter and applesauce to lighten it up, and they turned out great. Mine needed to be baked a lot longer because I forgot to flatten them out ahead of time -- you really need to do that. Thanks for sharing a great, quick recipe!

The cookie itself was very good, and my whole family enjoyed it. The only problem I had was that it was very messy, hard to eat and get off the pan. I don't know if anyone else had this problem, or if I screwed something up. But otherwise it was delicious!

first off, i seriously hate oatmeal cookies, so i am not qualified to give my personal opinion of theese cookies. 

with that out of the way, my dad said he wanted theese instead of a birthday cake and the people at the nursing home chose theese over any type of cookie offered. i guess for oatmeal cookies they were pretty good. 5 stars.

Best oatmeal recipe I have tried on this site so far!!!  I used whole wheat flour and eyeballed the other ingredients.  The only think I added was apple pie spice.  I used about 1/4 cup more brown sugar because I like my cookies a little sweet.  WONDERFUL!!!!!

I doubled the cinnamon and added nutmeg.  This is a very soft and cakey cookie.  Not bad, but not great.  I think this is too bland, but my mum likes them.
They really do need the glaze.

this recipe is very good.  but you need to add more cinnamon and I also added 1/4 cup of white sugar.  I had read this in other reviews.  my kids loved this recipe.   We left out the walnuts and did not use the glaze.  I would definitely make this recipe again.

Family LOVED these cookies.
I doubled the ingredient list for a larger batch, and used 3 whole diced apples rather than the 2 the recipe would have called for.  Probably could have used another half an apple and still had cohesive cookies, but this worked well and was flavorful.  A dash of nutmeg in the mix along with the cinnamon helps too.

Just made these last night. Super easy to make; followed the recipe, except used chopped apple instead of shredded. I must have made them small, because I got about 46 cookies out of the recipe. I was babysitting a friend's son and he was helping me out, but was disappointed when I added the nuts (a mix of walnuts and pecans), because he doesn't like nuts. Didn't seem to stop him; he ended up eating 4 before going home :)  Added a bit of cinnamon to the glaze too. And yes, they come out of the oven looking the same as when they went in. Delicious cookie, definitely worth the minimal effort!

Great cookie to experiment with. Used tiny diced apples, and added 1 Tbs ground flax seed. The original recipe is very good and very cake like. In our families opinion, it needs more spice, so just add your favorites. I am morphing it into a breakfast cookie for my teens, adding flax, raisins, maybe some ww flour etc.  It is not too sweet, love that. Also it does not spread for me either, so I used the back of a fork to press and shape them.

I was looking for something nice for breakfast at work. These cookies are soft and warmly spiced. I added cardamom, but otherwise kept to the recipe.  I taste-tested one  still warm from the oven with a cup of tea and it was lovely.

I gave this 4 stars because it's a perfectly solid recipe that you can tinker with for fun.  As per GardenRiot I added a 1/2 tsp of fresh ground cardamon and it gave the cookie a really nice and hard to identify spiciness!  I also added 1/2 tsp of orange zest. There weren't enough walnuts for my taste so I think I'll try 1 full cup next time.  This was most definitely delicious!
I only ever use Silver Palate oats and for this a cortland apple.  I can see how apple moisture and flavor could lead to varying results.  For a crispier cookie swap out the apple for craisins.

I love love love these cookies! Definitely worth the extra couple minutes to add the frosting, much better with it! I took the advise from other reviews and added 1/4 c applesauce and I also added a little bit of pumpkin spice. I'm not even sure how to shred an apple, I just chopped it real fine at it was perfect! Thanks for the recipe, this one's a keeper.

My family LOVED this recipe! I usually have awful luck with oatmeal cookies, but I used this recipe as a base and made a few changes ... we will definitely double the recipe next time! Changes: instead of 2 c. oats and 1 c. apples, I used 2.25 c. of instant oatmeal (cinnamon/apple flavor). I also cut the salt by 1/2 and used allspice instead of cinnamon--and instead of 1/2 c. nuts I used 1/2 c. crunchy peanut butter. The finished product didn't need the sugary topping---they had plenty of flavor and were quite moist!

I love this recipe but did a little tweaking for my needs. I'm a busy gal with my 2 month old daughter so I decided to make these into bars instead just because it was faster for me. I also added a second apple, 2 more eggs, and a package of cheesecake pudding mix. Put it into my 9x13 and baked at 350 for about 50 minutes or until done in the middle. I let it cool and drizzled on some glazemade of milk vanilla butter and vanilla. These don't last long!!!

I liked the texture and smell of the cookies, but they needed more spice and more apple flavor.  Next time I will add more apples and maybe some nutmeg.  I will make again for sure!

So I followed the recipe as given with  one change and I've done this with a apple bread recipe i cored the apple and grated it right over the mix and as usually turned out awesome. The juice and all goes right into the mix with makes it moist and no huge chunks which is great when you have an 18 month old who is still learning to use his teeth :p. Thanks for the awesome recipe that my little man loves.

These just weren't tasty at all.  The flavor is severely lacking.  I was going to make these for church but I will just have to let the kids eat them and buy some from the store for church.  They are just bland.  I even added some extra spices...

Delicious. A new family favorite.  I had no walnuts on hand so I used finely crushed peanuts and the flavor made me think of a carmel apple covered in peanuts. Also, instead of cinnamon, I used a cinnamon blend from The  Pampered Chef and added  some of that in the icing. Very good!!

Not an overly sweet cookie - perfect texture - I used an apple diced up instead of shredded.  The icing is a nice compliment to the cookie.  I will definitely be making this often this fall.  I used a cookie scoop and just dropped them and baked on parchment paper for 10 minutes.

I just tried this recipe and found it to be quite good.  I'm not sure what CAROLINEFO did wrong, but if her attempts came out dry then I don't know what to tell her.  My first batch looked so liquidy that I worried that they would not hold their shape and run all over the baking sheet.  But my fear proved groundless and they came out fine.  My only problem is that mine tasted a bit bland.  Though I did add spices: 1 tsp ginger, 1/2 tsp cloves, & 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I think my problem was too much ginger and not enough nutmeg.  (We cooks do love to tinker with recipes, or at least this cook does.)  I will update this next time I make them.  I'd do it now except I ran out of oatmeal.  I had only just enough for the first batch.

Nice cookie recipe! Especially good for folks who don't enjoy super-sweet cookies. I used two small apples, no walnuts and replaced butter with Crisco -- the recipe came out just fine. Drizzled icing on the top. Yum!

Delicious with apple and cinnamon sweetness. Made a double batch and after reading reviews, I added 2 pinches cardamom, cloves, & nutmeg. I made the icing with 1/2 - 1 tsp in it, eyeballed. I pressed them down too before baking and 11 minutes was perfect. I will definitely make these again.

I increased the brown sugar to 1 cup.  I should have added 1/2 sugar. Also, too much  oatmeal for the recipe, I should have used 1 cup.  I added nutmeg to give them more flavor and still not enough.  Good concept, lack flavor.  Not a winner in my book!

Delicious! Great option as a change to fall apple recipes! The only change I made was I added a couple drops of almond flavoring to the frosting.

These cookies are delicious and easy to make. They do need a little more spice. I used apple pie spice and added a little cinnamon to the glaze. I will make these again!

The cookies were very bland the night I made them.  But the following day they were phenomenal. I took them along on a snowmobile trip for stops along the way.  They were very popular and I got lots of compliments.

These are tasty but somewhat dry. I didn't do the frosting, as these are quite sweet as it. I'm trying to figure out what to add to infuse a bit more moisture. Seasoning=ok, makes a couple of doz. slightly-larger-than- bite sized cookies.

Made these this evening and they were a great hit with my husband.  I tried them without the drizzle glaze but my husband said they needed the extra sweetness of the drizzle.  I added 1/8 tsp. of nutmeg to mine and rounded teaspoon when measuring the cinnamon.  I also added 1/2 C. raisins .  I doesn't make a very big batch of cookies.  The recipe yielded  2 dozen  2 1/2 " cookies.  I did shape mine slightly after one person saying they pretty much keep the shape you drop them onto the cookie sheet in.

Maybe my mistakes caused problems, but these were dry and tasteless, and the icing soaked into the cookies. Probably my apple was too bland (a Jonagold), but there was no apple taste whatsoever. And possibly the icing was too thin.

I absolutely love this recipe. I read a lot of the other reviews and there was a common issue of being to dry and didn't want to melt down like a normal cookie. I however, did not have these issues. they were very moist not dry at all, I doubled the recipe and it turned out fantastic. wife loves them and called them a breakfast cookie!! I will be using this one again and playing around with it some more!!

Very nice, easy recipe.  Didn't use nuts or any other spices, just cinnamon.  Added some flour as suggested by other reviewers.  Sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top (just a bit), and smushed-down so not too thick.  Shredded the apple.  Will make again.  Thanks for posting.

I made these today. They are great. I used all purpose whole wheat flour. I did shred the apple. I cooked 10 minutes. I added some vanilla and cinnamon to the glaze. These cookies do not spread.

So yummy. I didnt even have brown sugar and used pecans instead of walnuts. I also didnt make the drizzled frosting topping. Im sure its yummy but i was sharing with a 2 year old who didnt need the extra sugar. Easy and delicious.

I was excited to make these but found them disappointing in lack of sweetness. Also, I mistakenly  put in only half the butter so they were a bit crumbly. They're glazed so that helps sweeten & moisten them. It wasn't a total loss at least.

Added a pinch of nutmeg and finely shredded the apples like applesauce. Otherwise made them exactly like the recipe. They were wonderful, moist and delicious.
