Excellent cake. A bit on the sweet side but very moist and delicious. I frosted it as a "naked" cake, piping whipped cream along the top and the bottom and fresh sliced strawberries on top. Will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. After 39 minutes it was done. I let it cool in the pans for 15 minutes. When I tried removing the cakes, they stuck. When I got them to come out, half the bottom stayed in the pan. They are so crispy on the edges and bottom it wasnâ€™t worth my time to ice them. I have no idea what caused them to be crispy but nobody wants a crunchy cake.

This has become a regular request from the guys I work with when I bake them a birthday cake.  It is pretty simple and I frost with real strawberry icing; recipe from this website.
