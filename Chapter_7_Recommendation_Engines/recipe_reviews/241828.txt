I wouldn't consider this clean eating or low carb, however it was good.   The flavor was very mild so if you aren't going to add hot sauce you may need to add more spices.  In my opinion, if your chicken has been cooking long enough you don't have to remove it to shred it.  It comes apart nicely by just stirring it.  Ours was much more "soupy" than the photo. It was like a chicken chili.   I added sour cream and cheese and served with tortilla chips.

This is a winner! Amazing flavors and the aroma is absolutely sublime. I cooked on Low, expecting to be out all day but came back home mid day...yikes what a test of patience for not getting into the crock pot before cooking time was over. 
My husband has his simply with homemade Mexican rice. Mine was in a tortilla topped with cheese and dollops of sour cream with a side of Mexican rice. This is a keeper! Glad I came across your recipe Michelle...
P.S. A quick way to shred cooked chicken is to cut breasts in half and place them in the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attached. Run on medium (6) speed for 15 to 20 seconds or until the chicken is well-shredded. No stand mixer,then use hand mixer and cut chicken into smaller pieces.

Excellent and easy! I left out the broth  by  mistake but I guess that kept it from being too soupy as some other reviewers mentioned. Had to add a little salt at the end because of that, but nbd. Also left out the cayenne for Hubby's sake. He gets hiccups when he eats spicy foods! LOL! I was in a hurry and hadn't planned ahead enough to let it cook for 9 hours, so I cut up the chicken into big chunks, about 4" each, and cooked it on High for 4 hours. The chicken was fully cooked but still in nice chunks, although it did shred easily if you went at it with a fork. I served it in soup mugs over Mexican rice and the family just loved it! Thanks for posting! (yeah, I know, the rice negated the low-carb thing, but it's optional! :D  )

Fantastic dish with such ease to make!! Cooked as directed but I doubled the recepie and added chili powder also used the 32oz. Container of broth! I thought it would be a little more like a soup until I shredded the chicken! Wow! It was very hearty, tasty and low carb! Will make again for sure!

Though I did use chili powder instead of cayenne to temper the heat, I made absolutely no other changes.  My whole family not only LOVED this, but I was asked to officially put it into rotation (that's what we call my "go to" meals that are quick and easy for busy days). As another reviewer said, it did turn out more soup like, but decreasing the chicken broth (&/or adding more chicken) will change that easily and the soupiness has no bearing on the taste.

this is a definite keeper.  In place of the seasonings I used a Tbsp of taco seasoning which seemed to work nicely.  I ate mine like a dip with tortilla chips and the kids used theirs as burrito filling.  This is as 'clean' as my eating gets in order to avoid forfeiting flavor... great recipe!

I made this and followed others reviews.  I cut the broth in half, added salt and quite a bit of taco seasoning, 1/2 C of salsa and one block of cream cheese! That made it nice and thick.  I use it as a dip, on chips or even in taco shells.

Excellent recipe! Consider two cans of black beans as opposed to one,  and one half of the chicken broth (to reduce liquid content), and the addition of sour cream at the end.

I didn’t have corn or cilantro but added a can of great northern beans and extra chicken. It was delicious. Can’t wait to try it with the cilantro. Boiled the chicken in water until cooked through...took the chicken out and added the rest of the ingredients, placed chicken breasts back on. Simmered for about a half an hour, then shredded the chicken. Good base recipe, can add or subtract ingredients as you wish.

This recipe turned our terrific. I loved it. I decreased the broth by half because I like my dish thicker. Other than that, I followed it exactly. Would make this again

This was OK but I will not be making it again. It lacked flavor and the reviews that said it was soupy were correct, and I even left out some of the broth.

I've made this several times now.  It's on our list of easy "week night meals".  We sometimes serve it over rice or cali-rice.  We always add some shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream and/or avocado.

This is a good recipe, but i thought the flavor was too subtle.  The second time I made it, I doubled the spices.  With that alteration, I loved it.  So easy to make.  I served it over white rice with a tiny bit of shredded cheese on top.

Did not use slow cooker at all - made in 20 minutes.  I skipped the broth, used leftover rotisserrie chicken and sub'd the cayenne pepper for some chili pepper and chipotle pepper.  No salt needed.  Served w/ warm tortiallas and a cabbage/green apple salad.

It was really good.  I feel, it was to watered down.  Ate more like a soup.  Would have been soggy taco's or burrito's had I used the filling for that.  Also...NEED's Black olives.

We love this! I use this recipe for my freezer (oamc) cooking. We like to eat it as a burrito bowl, as if from Moe's, adding cheese, guac, and sour cream serving over rice. It is in our regular rotation.

Was ok. Made many other recipes from this site, never having problems. This turned out more like a soup. Still pretty tasty though. Next time I'll cut back the broth a little bit.  Only substitute I made was, I couldn't get Scallions, so I used Green onions.

Fantastic! I have made it three times and it will be a regular on our table.  My only changes were to add a tsp. of chipotle chili powder and few chopped blackened hatch chili peppers (to up the heat). Also a teaspoon of salt. Its a keeper!
