How many of us in SE Kansas have LOVED these?   


It's a tradition and I found the coup de gras last week,,,,,,,,,a cast iron one..........


Our recipe includes rum though..............the alcohol cooks out in the process.

Grandma used to make her's on the old cast iron press.  I have an electric iron that my mom passed down to me.  This is like our recipe, but I use the light brown sugar.  Oh, I good hint for Catholic bakers--once you close the iron on your two cookies say a Hail Mary and then open the iron to two perfectly timed cookies!!  And as you give your Christmas Galettes to friends and neighbors you can say they come with prayers for a Happy Holiday season.

This was my choice for my cookie party this year. It made exactly 12 dozen. I dusted them with powdered sugar. I was surprised at how the texture changed when I mixed it over the hot water bath. Taste like a cross of molasses & sugar cookies. Hope it's a hit at the party!!! Definately a keeper!!!  It was!! had calls saying it was the best one of all!!!!

I have been making French Cookies since I was a kid. After struggling w/ my great- aunt's recipe year after year, I decided to throw tradition to the wind and try this one. SO much easier, so tasty. I constantly have people raving about these cookies.  I do not use the hot water bath, just mix it all together in my stand mixer.

My great Grandma always made these. She called them gaufrettes. You can adjust the sugar, using some white, some brown, or all brown. Add a little rum or brandy to the mix. YUM! This is a family favorite. You can buy a gaufrette iron from Palmer available on amazon. The dough keeps well in the fridge for quite awhile, waiting for company to pop in. Since the cookies only take a few seconds in the iron, they are fast to whip up. Try ice-cream between two cookies!

Excellent! Simplistic yet delicious. I added fresh orange zest and cardamom; the flavor was amazing. Everyone loved them. A definite keeper in my Christmas cookie file.

Best galettes I've ever had. I used a pizelle iron cause I can not find a galette iron anywhere. They came off the iron soft and flimsy but hardened as they dried. Such good crispy cookies. mmmm My MIL and her family make these with an old cast iron galette press and they've always come out softer. I'm not sure if they are supposed to be a tiny bit soft? This batch came out very crisp. Maybe it was the pizelle iron that did that.

Great flavor.  I cooked them in my belgian waffle maker since that is all I had and while they taste great they are just too much cookie so I am going to get a smaller waffle type baker.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing!!

Delicious and fun to make.  I used my waffle cone iron and they turned out great.  Too bad I could only make one at a time and the kids would eat them as soon as they came off the iron.

I absolutely agree that these are part of Christmas in SE kansas. This was my first year with a pizelle iron and couldn't wait to make them.  I used 2 tsp vanilla with 1 tsp rum flavoring since most of these cookies call for rum or whiskey.

This recipe is almost exactly the one my Belgian grandmother used.  She also added an ounce of liquor.  There was a large French/Belgian population near Pittsburgh PA... in fact they still hold a "galette" contest there!  The cookies are best when made with a galette iron which you can purchase from C. Palmer Mfg Co. www.cpalmermfg.com.  Search under Belgian cookie irons.  Happy baking!

We have made these cookies (which are now requested by friends and neighbors) for several years. This is the recipe we have settled on. We use a stand mixer, but no hot water bath. My cookie scoop (size 18-8) makes the perfect size for the Cuisinart Pizzelle Press. The recipe makes about 100 cookies, which we cool slightly, trim with kitchen shears, and dust with powdered sugar (using a small fine mesh strainer). Delicious with coffee! We even save the trimmings for snacking.

I have made this recipe at Christmas for years and years!  It's just like my grandma's recipe she brought from Belgium.  We have the hand held iron Galette makers.  I always thought she brought the recipe from Missouri because that's where she moved to from Belgium.

We always add Frangelico!

My granddaughters are the fifth generation to make these cookies at Christmas. A tradition not likely to be lost.
