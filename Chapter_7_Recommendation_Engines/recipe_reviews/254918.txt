This was very good!  I used a Greek seasoning recipe from another recipe (olive oil, lemon juice, oregano, white wine vinegar etc) and loved it!  If requested, I'll try to find the Greek recipe for the seasoning and post it here.

In order to brown the feta, I put the grill on a lower setting and closed the lid for about 5 minutes.

This was good! The kids didn't care for it, but hubby and I thought it was fine. I used my grill pan and finished them in the oven. I think I may play with the spices a bit next time (maybe garlic or something). This was something different and we liked it! Thanks for sharing. :)

Loved this recipe!  I cut the large zucchini into 1/2 inch slices and grilled 5 minutes on med heat.  Weâ€™ll be having this one again!

Not bad.  I do think the zucchini needs to be flipped and the recipe doesn't say that.  My feta didn't turn brown and yummy looking like the feta in the photo, but it was melted onto the zucchini and it was tasty.
