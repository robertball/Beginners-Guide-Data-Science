Good flavor, fluffy and easy to work with. A good introduction to egg buttercream frosting: not as intimidating as Italian or Swiss buttercream but not as stable in hot, humid weather.

This is an incredibly delicious frosting. I hate the too-sweet frostings of powdered sugar and a little butter. This is just right. It is full of butter and I enjoyed that buttery flavor and texture. If it is hot, though, it will have a tendency to break down because of the butter base. I did put sweetened coconut on the top, so that added more sugar to the final cake. The texture was delightful. If you like a light, fluffy frosting that isn't overly sweet, but full of buttery flavor, this is it.

This recipe is amazing! This is my first Buttercream. The addition of the rum is a wonderful twist for the flavor

Tastes great! Everyone loves it when I make it, even those who don't like icing will take a few bites.

Did not like it.  Way too much butter.  Not a very good flavor.

exquisite and silky. I used this recipe as the filling in my Nanaimo bar. Custard from scratch really elevates it, I'll probably never go back to custard powder. I did omit the rum flavouring and used two egg yolks in places of the whole egg, for extra silkiness.

Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I did not know there was another way to make buttercream icing.  This is pretty good! I made it exactly as written and it turned out well.  It was a little bit too buttery for my taste though.  After making it I saw the note in the recipe that said you could cut the butter back to 1 cup.  (I had used the full 1 1/3 cup stated in the ingredients.)  So, I adjusted the mixture by adding a proportional amount of powdered sugar and vanilla to make up for the extra 1/3 cup of “extra” butter.  That turned out very good!  Next time I will make the recipe as written with just 1 cup of butter & update this review.  Thanks again for sharing!
