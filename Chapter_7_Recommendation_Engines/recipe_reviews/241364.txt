It's pretty good. I added a whole banana and I didn't have plain yogurt so I put in a cup of lime Greek yogurt instead! Tasty and I feel good about getting all that spinach in me!!!

This turns out great, tastes delicious... but I'm wondering how the creator arrived at the color in the picture, or the total calories...? A banana alone is 100 calories minimum, then the yogurt is a minimum of 100... add in the blueberries at 40 calories for 1/2 cup and you're at twice what is stated. Just thought people should have the facts. Enjoy though, because they're all healthy and delicious calories!
