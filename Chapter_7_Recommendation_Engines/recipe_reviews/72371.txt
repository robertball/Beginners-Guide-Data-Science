I used a very lg papaya & served half of it to two people. I added a bit of vanilla to my yogurt & I used dried cherries instaed of raisins & fresh blueberries instead of strawberries. Wsa a very light & refreshing dessert...thansk for the recipe! Forgot to add that we grilled this for just long enough to get some cool grill marks.

This was a wonderful dish. Everyone in the family loved it. I make my own yogurt which isn't as thick as store bought so I diced up the papaya and poured the mixture over the top. I also didn't have any raisins so I used dried cranberries. I will be making this again!

Wow, this is awesome!  I used Greek yogurt and really liked the mixture of the tart yogurt and sweet fruit.  This dish is also great for texture-- you get crunchy nuts, smooth yogurt, soft fruit, and chewy raisins.  Yum!
