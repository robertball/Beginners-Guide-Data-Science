This is an outstanding recipe! I've been curious about this recipe since I posted it to my recipe box back in August. I made it today for Girl's Night Out. I just told the girls it was a lime bar - they know me better than that and knew there was a "secret" ingredient I wasn't telling them about. I wanted to wait until everyone tried them to hear their reaction about the bars. Everyone LOVED the bars and then continued to guess for about 10 minutes trying to guess the avocado. Once they knew the ingredient they asked that the dessert box be passed around again. I came home with an empty container. I loved the zest taste in the bars and when I juiced the limes I pulled the pulp strings from the lime and added that also. When the timer went off at 25 minutes the pan didn't look like it was quite done baking but the edges were quite brown I used a glass pan. But once they cooled down and were cut they were completely baked. sueb - THANK YOU for sharing this recipe. It is certainly a winner in my house and with my friends. Can't wait for another occasion to make them again.

I needed to find a use for half a leftover avocado and this recipe emerged from my ingredient search. My husband thought these bars were really unique. They are a good combination of flavors and not too sweet.

Mine turned out perfect!  I did have to make one small variation (using dried Rosemary instead of fresh (1 tsp dried = 1 tablespoon fresh rosemary)) and chose to make one other small variation as a personal preference.  I put mine in mini baking cups, instead of a large pan, so that I could have already pre-made, individual servings.  The mini cupcake style worked beautifully!   I didn't have to butter up anything - just press the flour mixture straight into the cup, and leave some room for the filling..  I used both paper and foil cups, and both turned out identically - DELICIOUS!

Very tart but refreshing and original dessert for a BBQ. I want to use just the crust recipe for something else.

This is an interesting combination of flavors but it has been a hit. You get a bit of tart & a bit of freshness. I tell people it tastes like spring. I am picky with texture so WHEN I make these again I will probably use a mixer to get the avocado smoother.

These were yummy and different. I was running low on lime zest so I added a bit of lemon to crust. The leftovers vanished at work

I love these bars. The rosemary and avocado enhance them in a nice way. I did not think it would turn out very good but it definitely did. The only thing is that a 1/2 cup of the flour mixture was not enough to make the top crust but this did not affect the taste of it at all. I give this 5 stars.

Excellent use of avocado. similar to lemon bars. I used Crisco instead of butter and the bars are crumbly. I also used dried rosemary which works out though I think fresh would have been much better. It's a very inventive and creative recipes. The avocado and lime combination is light and refreshing.

This is a good recipe.:) i used lemon instead of lime. I should have adjusted the quantity to only one because the lemon over powered the overall flavor. Still good nonetheless. Will try again soon.
