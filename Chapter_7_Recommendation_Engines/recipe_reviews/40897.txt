Wonderful recipe. . .VERY easy, and Very yummy! My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe. I made it even easier. . .the chicken breasts were in a baggie so I added some maple syrup to the bag with one dab of honey mustard dressing. . .then I shook the chicken in another bag with crushed wheat crackers and pecans. . .baked for 20 minutes and done. . .Very tasty!
