I've never made this before but I have eaten it and absolutely loved it.  I was pretty sure it was okra when I ate it by the seeds in it.  I was wonderful alongside a head-on grilled fish, roasted sweet potatoes, and rice. Can't wait to make my own, it does look unappetizing, but is VERY delicious if you like okra!
