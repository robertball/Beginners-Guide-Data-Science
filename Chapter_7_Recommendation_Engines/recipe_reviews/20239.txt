This was very good. I took the advice of a few previous reviewers. Before browning seasoned with Goya adobo, Reduced onion down to 1 and increased garlic to 4. I did not use the boullion cubes I increased beer to 1 1/4 cup and used 1 1/2 cups chicken broth. 1 cup of frozen peas instead of canned. Baked covered at 350 degrees for 1 1/2 hours. Flavor was very good. Will make again.

I always saute the uncooked rice just until it becomes translucent.This way, it holds a nice texture throughout the simmering process. This recipe is best, subbing chicken broth for tomato sauce and using frozen peas rather than canned. Top with cheese for a nice addition.

The end result of this recipe was a great tasting meal.  However, I had to add 1 1/2 cups of water to the dish because the rice did not cook at all just using the ingredients listed.  After adding the additional water, I extended the cooking time by 15 mins., with the pan covered, and it cooked the rice.  In the future, I will add the water and cook just as I would any rice dish, covered and for about 20 mins. on low.

This recipe is not written very clearly.  Based on the recipe as written there is not nearly enough liquid for the amount of rice.  It appears that the bouillion cubes need to be dissolved in water then added.  The extra 2 cups of liquid would have made a huge difference, as would covering the pan.  Additionally, it says to drain the peas, then add them with the liquid.  The taste was good, but as written it is a disaster.  Probably would benefit from a bit of cilantro as well.

I have eaten at a Cuban restaurant in Orange, California that features this plate. I followed the recipe to a tee and this came out just like what I had at this wonderful little restaurant on the circle in Orange. I give this the highest rating because of the taste and because 6 members of my family had there mouth watering for more. By the way, I am a 49 year old male who enjoys to cook.

Thank you Sussell for sharing your recipe.  I grew up loving the Cuban Arroz con Pollo, but never fixed it myself.  I don't remember the tomato sauce in it, so I left that out and used chicken broth in its place. Baked it in the oven at 350 for 1 1/2 hours.  It was delicious!

This is a great authentic Cuban recipe. I did add a little water to it and cook it covered so the flavors were not as strong as Cuban arroz con pollo usually is. I also left out the peas and pimenton for the kids who found this to be a huge hit! I served it with fresh bread, a green salad and red wine. Next time I will make the maduros to go with it.

This was great!  I seasoned the chicken with a little bit of onion powder and salt and pepper and I used chicken breasts instead (that's what I had) and paprika instead of saffron for color and it was great!!!  Thanks!

This recipe is REALLY good.  My husband and my 15-month-old son gobbled it up.  I omitted the beer and used chicken broth instead.  Seasoned the chicken with adobo before browning it and I too covered it and let it simmer for approx. 20 mins.  I have no idea how that rice would have cooked other wise.  I think next time, I'll only use 1 bullion cube to ease up on the saltiness

This was very good, I loved it!  I didn't have any beer but subtituted chicken broth and no saffron but I used some Goya Sazon to season the chicken with and it was still very good.

This dish was great! Almost as good as my close friend's grandmother's arroz con pollo and she's from Cuba!! I added the rice, about 1 cup of water, a whole bottle of beer and the canned peas (with liquid) at the same time and then let cook on low for about 20 minutes. I stirred every once in a while to ensure I got that risotto, think consistency. This was sooo delish! I'm definitely going to make it again!

Excellent. Delicious flavor. I made some of the same changes as everyone else with chicken broth substituted for beer. Since I omitted the bouillon it was not too salty. I didn't add all 15 ounces of frozen peas because it seemed like too much. I used chicken drumsticks. YUM! Thank you for posting!!

I made this with boneless skinless chicken breasts, frozen peas instead of canned, and used Goya Sazon in place of the saffron I didn't have. The chicken was tender, and the flavor was very good; I will definitely make it again. But I wish I had read the reviews before making this dish. 

This recipe is poorly written. After preparing it, I can only assume that the chicken bouillon cubes were meant to be dissolved in two cups of water, as the rice clearly needed more liquid to cook. I added some part way through the cook time, but it was too little, too late, and the rice was a little undercooked when I served the dish. I did cover the dish while cooking the rice, although that wasn't specified. Had I not done that, I think the rice would have been too crunchy to eat. 

As I mentioned, I used frozen peas in place of canned, and they worked out fine. But clearly, another flaw with the recipe was the description of how the peas are to be used. The ingredients specify that the can of peas is to be drained, but doesn't specify to reserve the liquid. Later, the recipe instructs to use the liquid from the peas. I think if this recipe were properly written, the results from following it would be outstanding.

This was very good. The flavor is complex, interesting and delicious. All of the prep dishes can be done while this cooks in the fry pan so final clean up after dinner is very easy. I didn't have white wine so I used red and only had one bunch of cilantro. Used 1 extra clove of galic and two Jalepeno peppers, it turned out great and will be made again.

This recipe has been in my box for the last 18 months when last night, not knowing what to make for dinner I decided to finally try it.  OMG!  This is so delicious!  The aroma while it's cooking is mouth watering and the flavor is wonderful!  I have to ask myself why it took me so long to try it  when I could have enjoying it for all these months!  The only thing I did not add is the green bell peppers since I had none.  YUM! YUM!

Ahhh... just like dad used to make!!  (He was Puerto Rican) I never got his recipe & now I can't, but this brought back memories of when he would do the cooking after school!  I used water instead of beer cause I only had a superthick, dark variety of beer on hand (and no chicken broth) and it was delicious.  And as others said, it did take longer for the rice to cook, but it was worth the wait.

This recipe was delicious! It took more time than indicated. The rice took forever to cook as did the chicken! Overall, it was a great recipe.

this was very easy and very good. i made several changes though. i didn't add the beer. and i just added a whole red pepper. i used 2 cups already cooked white rice(leftover in the fridge) and i added some mushrooms, and 1 carrot. i also halved the recipe, i only used 3 chicken thighs. i also added some fresh cilantro. it was very good with these changes, but i'm sure it would be just as wonderful without them. it is a great recipe, and it was very cheep to make. i highly recomend this recipe.

This can be a 5 star dish with a few variations. I use 4 lbs of chicken marinate in a 1 TB of red wine vinegar, ` tsp oregano, 1tsp cumin and 1 tsp coriander for about 20 min. after marinatiing I salt and pepper each side and pan fry in a 3 TB olive oil until each side is browned. I remove the chicken and I make a sofrito with onions, red bell bepper, and 1 roasted chile. After a few minutes I add back the chicken and add 1 diced tomato, 1 small can tomato sauce, 1 cup white wine, 1 can of beer, and 3 cups chicken stock. Season with addtl salt if needed.  I bring to boil and simmer for 15 min covered. Then I add 2 1/2 cups rice and cover simmered until rice is done about 20 min. With fried plantains om the side, delicous!

I used thighs and added mushrooms.  Did not use saffron or the juice from the peas. Also, one cup of beer was not enough to cook the rice so I added 1 can of chicken broth and this dish turned out fantastic.  I served with plantains (yummy)

We liked this recipe and I will add it to our rotation.  Like others I added additional water (1.5 cups) to help the rice cook.  Also, I did't have saffron.  Not sure if I can get it in these parts.  This makes for a good weeknight meal.

I followed past reviews and left out the tomato and instead of beer, used chix stock.  Anyhow, this was mediocre at best.  My sister, who usually isn't hard please said, "Eww, the rice tastes FUNKY!".  Chicken was plain, rice was whatever, smelled nice, tasted otherwise.  And to think I wasted saffron on this dish!

I really liked this recipe.  I did as suggested and covered after adding the rice.  I also used diced tomatoes instead of sause.  Came out very good. I will definately make this again and recommend.  LISA

My husband loved this receipe.  He said it reminded him of being back home in Mexico.  I used the beer and even though the receipe didn't say so I actually cooked it with the rice covered. The chicken was excellent and the rice so yummy!!  I wanted to try this recipe with just chicken breast but my husband insisted that the bones make it all taste better.  If anyone tried it boneless I would like to know how it tasted.  Still...  a Great receipe.

It tastes like authenic Spanish rice with chicken and was really easy to make.  I substituted the beer with chicken broth.

I didn't have a whole chicken just a very large boneless breast.  I cut the breast up and sauted it and used it instead.  It worked just fine.  I would have preferred to have had dark meat for the flavor but the breast I get from my butcher is top quality and worked well.  Everyone liked this in my family including my son who does not like rice.

I made this for dinner tonight.  I doubled the recipe and used chicken broth as another person recommended.  It was very good, but very greasy.  Could it be because I left the skin on the chicken? I don't know but this may be less greasy with just boneless/skinless chicken breasts.  Will try again with boneless/skinless chicken breasts.

The recipe definitely needs more water or the rice will end up crunchy. It was missing some zest... maybe a squeeze of lime would have helped?

Really nice bold flavor. I prepared it a little differently than the instructions say. I cooked the rice, which I first sauteed in a little EVOO, separately, then added it to the chicken/tomato sauce mixture. Good and simple. Thanks, Sussell!

I found this recipe to be very good.  I liked the idea that this is a very easy way to make arroz con pollo.  I am a cuban man living in japan and I wanted to eat arroz con pollo so I descided to try to make it myslef.  It was very good.  I also had trouble with the rice not being cooked fully.  So I just added more beer over 15 min period of time.  It came out good.  I like that this was easy to make to....And you dont have to do a million other things on the side.

This was really good.  Although, I did learn that the can of beer really should be something mild like Bud Light.  I added Molston XXX that I already had on hand and it left too strong a flavor.

like everyone else said it's horribly written, but it turned out fan-frickin-tastic with a few modifications. i added 1.5 c chicken broth, some other veggies, and i covered it so the rice would cook right.

I didn't like this recipe much.  It was waaay too sweet for my taste.  I think the sweet juice from the peas may have been too much in combo with the tomato sauce.  I did not have saffron, so I am not sure how much this would affect the overall flavor.  I gave it 3 stars because I thought it would be a good dish for someone who likes this sort of dish sweet.

We thought this was a great recipe; however, I did make some changes, but I'm sure the original was just as good.

We don't cook with alcohol, so I substituted chicken broth instead. I also added a whole red pepper and a poblano pepper and finished it with some cilantro and lime.

Great recipe!  My supermarket was out of Saffron, so I used the Vigo Spanish saffron rice instead of white rice.  I followed the package directions for liquid and used about 3 cups of chicken broth. I also omitted the beer.  I have no doubt that the leftovers will not last long!

There's something wrong with the way this recipe is written.  I would suggest making the rice on the side then adding it to the chicken/veg mixture.  Or add more liquid, cover and steam the rice until done.

This was good, though I did make changes.  I didn't have green pepper so used red bell pepper instead.  I omitted the red pepper at the end that the recipe calls for to top it iwth.  I didn't have saffron so used 1 tsp cumin, 1 tsp New Mexico chili powder and 1 tsp cajun seasoning, whcih is what I had.  Also used a Corona beer, but only used 1 c and used 2 c of water.  If you are using 1.5 cups of rice, you need 3 cups of liquid.  Added in frozen peas.  Also for the chicken, I boiled it in garlic powder and water, then shredded it.  Cooked it in oil in pan wiht seasonings then added it to the rice mixture.  Sauteed the rice with pepper and onion all together for five minutes, as if making spanish rice.  It turned out pretty well, though mine also had a strong beer flavor despite the light version I used.  Would make again though!!!

I'm a 68yrs old lady, born and raised in PR and original, authentic PR Arroz con pollo doesn't  have green pigeon peas. It's either arroz con pollo or arroz with pigeon peas. You  can add cooking ham, for  added flavor, but not pork meat. That can be added when we make the rice with pigeon peas.

I used basmati rice, and I neglected the uber expensive saffron, but I added shrooms and it turned out really tasty, the only bummer was, I had to use most of a 25 oz. Fosters because the rice wasn't quite done, really looking fwd. to downing that myself.  Nobody knew what Arroz Con Pollo was, but now they do, and dad is pretty cool.

This was a real disappointing effort to complete. I made the dish at the request of the kids as they loved the last recipe, clear to me now I will go back. After following the directions specified, and the rice instructions, it was a bit soggy and why the beer I don't know but it was not tasteful in this at all. It was too strong and took the taste completely over.

My rice took about 10 extra minutes to cook through, but other than that I made this recipe exactly as is.  The only thing that I wished was better was the chicken.  I thought that it would pick up some of the flavor with being cooked in the stew, but it ended up being pretty bland. Overall though the rice stew was tasty.

i made this dish, and the rice turned out very hard and crunchy.. had to add more beer and water to cook rice throughly.. ended up being very sticky with not much flavor..
