This is an excellent appetizer! After experimenting with it twice, I've concluded that I prefer the following modifications:

Use 6 oz. cream cheese and leave out the butter.
Use an additional tablespoon of cognac and a generous 2 tablespoons of onion.
Bump the Worcestershire up to 3/4 tablespoon.
Use 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.
Add 3/4 teaspoon of Tabasco sauce.
Don't skimp on the salt and pepper.

Yum!
