I am a past lover of the ultimate "Black Russian" so..... when I read these ingredient's I hopped in my car and perused Kroger's shelves for Vanilla Coke and stopped at our hooch store for some Absolut! What a pleasant surprise and delight! My partner in crime refers to this as SUMMER! Thanks!

Very good and refreshing. Simply tastes like vanilla coke. Not sure why it is thought of to taste like a black russian when they are made with coffee flavored liquour? Vanilla coke is hard to find so I used coke and vanilla vodka.

These have an improper name around here, but they are proper enough to get a darn good buzz. Best way to get lit is to pour one finger of vodka, one finger of vanilla vodka with a float of vanilla cola, if you can still find it. Pound it back and make another!

Delicious! If you don't have vanilla cola just add a small splash of vanilla extract.

I already know this drink of old but never realised it was named monkey shine! If you share a real love of vanilla replace ordinary vodka with vanilla absolut...beauty!

dont worry too much about measurements, a good glug of each and you cant go far wrong!

Thanks for posting this one, everyone should give it a go!

An easy adult beverage.  I don't care for run and coke, so this is a nice change.
