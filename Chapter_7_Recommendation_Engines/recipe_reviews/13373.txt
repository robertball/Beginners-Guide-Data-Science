This was SO good! as the vegetables were simmering,I cooked the chicken in water with extra carrots and celery(to make my own stock)I removed the chicken and chopped it up.Meanwhile,I just poured the home made stock into the simmering vegetables,WOW! that added all the flavor it needed! I also added a generous amount of seasoning salt and pepper.My noodles looked funny,but they were delicious and easy to make! This is the perfect recipe for a cold rainy day! 5 STARS!!!

I didn't make the noodles but I did make the soup and it was very very good. I scaled it to 12 servings. I made it in my crock pot, not on the stove top. I added rosemary to the recipe and more garlic than suggested. Also, instead of making the noodles I threw in some pasta during the last 45 minutes of cooking and the noodles were fine. This is a great soup.

This is delicious. I made one change which really improved the flavor. Instead of using chicken bouillon cube, use 1 teaspoon of Maggi chicken flavoring. Maggi comes in granules or cubes and after you use it you will never go back to regular bouillon cubes.

This is a good chicken soup recipe, although for the time involved I think it should have been better.  The time is this recipe's only shortcoming, I think.  Other than that, I would recommend making your own stock (I cooked 2 large chicken breast halves with some celery, carrot, salt, and pepper --simmer for 40 minutes, remove chicken, simmer 20 mintues more, strain. Be sure to skim while simmering.  The chicken I then shredded to use in the recipe).  Using the resulting stock, plus 2 cans of chicken stock and about 2 more cups of water made a nice soup base, not too salty or greasy, as I feel canned stock alone can sometimes be.  I also found that I had to add about 4 more cups of water while the soup was cooking in order to keep the water level up.  If you like chewy noodles,(not necessarily a bad thing) then go ahead and roll out to the suggested 1/8 inch thick, but if you don't like to have to cut your noodles when eating soup, then make the noodles paper thin when rolling out.  I also added different spices which I think really added flavor--a touch of ground ginger (maybe 1/2 teaspoon) plus 4 teaspoons of Old World Seasoning blend by Penzey's Spices.  This in particular was a great addition!  Overall, try this soup, especially if it's a cold, dreary day and you have nothing better to do.

This makes the best noodles I've ever had. I've made them several times and they are even better when cut into dumplings. This is truly a treasure of a recipe. Everyone who tries it asks how I get such lovely dumplings.

This was really good chicken noodle soup!  We loved the noodles....I've been searching for the perfect noodle recipe, and I've found it!  It could also be used for flat dumplings....just roll out thicker and don't dry...YUM!  I made my own broth (boiled a whole 5.5 lb chicken not cut up) and this soup had delicious flavor!  I left out the corn, but added about a cup of frozen peas and 2 med potatoes diced.  My husband never eats soups and he loved this. (he prefers thicker stews) Thanks for the recipe!  It's a keeper :)

This is so good...perfect for someone needing a little comfort.  I made my own chicken broth seasoned with poultry seasoning and parsley, and simmered the chicken breast for about 30 minutes. I omitted the corn as I'm not a big fan of it. I cut my noodles in dumpling squares rather than strips.  Thanks LaDonna!

This is great for a cold gloomy day. I love home made noodles! My only change was to leave out the corn, I just don't think it goes in chicken soup.

This is a great chicken soup recipe.  The best part are the noodles.  I was skeptical at first when  I saw the ingredients, but they are excellant!  Instead of prepared cooked chicken, I used chicken breast on the bone for more flavor.

This is very, very good! I made this one weekend when my fiance wasn't feeling too great. He LOVED it, especially the homemade noodles! His dad really liked it too and suggested I try the noodle recipe for dumplins some time, which I'll most likely do. Thanks for a great recipe!

I'm usually a pretty good cook, but I followed this recipe exactly, and the noodles were rubbery, and the soup was sort of bland.  I think, if I were to do this recipe again, I would use store-bought noodles, or add cut up refrigerated biscuits (to make delicious dumplings)

This soup turned out really good, I took some other posters advice and used about half homemade chicken stock and half store bought stock. I cooked 4 chicken breasts with carrots, celery, onion strained and shredded the chicken. Sauteed carrot and celery in the bottom of pan for just a couple minutes added homemade stock and box stock, cooked until veggies were tender, added half the chicken (used the other half chicken in a chicken salad) and noodles. The noodles were chewy but I rolled them as thin as I could get them. Some people loved the chewy thick noodles and others didn't but everyone like the flavor of the soup. It was a hit! I can't wait to make it again. Next time I will either use store bought noodles or use my dad's pasta maker to get the dough really thin

Very good! Noodles actually came out really nice and tasty - good texture. After tasting a bowl, I added a bay leaf and a little more season salt and pepper.

I have made this soup twice now.  The first time I used the boxed chicken broth, this last time I used a chicken paste you mix with water for the base.  It is soooo good.  I love this recipe.  The noodles are so easy to make.  

Something to take note of though this soup tastes better the day after you make it! I actually made my whole pot took a small bowl for myself and put the rest into tupperware and froze a couple and put a couple in the fridge.  I did this because I love the leftovers for this soup.  It's even better than when it is freshly made.  The noodles are much better the day after, after they have been soaking in the broth for awhile.  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly how it was written :)

I have made this twice. The first time it turned out so good I couldn't wait to make it again. The second time was a total flop but I had to hurry and didn't make the noodles well ahead like before. Letting them dry a bit and making sure the broth is well seasoned seems to be key in success. The second batch I used unsalted broth and it was very bland and no amount of added salt fixed it.

This recipe was amazing!!!!  I was nervous at first about making the noodles because I have never made homemade noodles before, but they turned out to be the best part of the soup.  I did not have enough time to let the soup cook for hours, so I took regular, large carrots and sliced them into thin circles and cut the celery into small slices and then only cooked the veggies for about 30/45 minutes before adding the noodles.  The noodles only sat to dry for about 40 minutes, but they turned out to be amazing:)  ENJOY!!!

I loved this recipe!! It was fantastic! The  ONLY thing I did different was to add bay leaf and some sage. The noodles are fantastic. You don't have to let it simmer for 2 hours. Just simmer it until the veggies are cooked. I also didn't simmer it after adding the chicken and the corn. I just didn't see the point. I used canned chicken and canned corn and it still came out just great.

Made just as the recipe notes.  It was good.  The noodles were more chewy than I wanted.  I was looking for more of a doughy noodle.

Great recipe!  I made a yield for 8 and as a variation I added 1 can of Cream of Chicken soup and subbed out 1 cup of the broth for water.  (I also omitted the corn.)  It didn't get too creamy-- just a little bit thicker consistency.  Delish!

Really good soup.  I chopped the veggies up very small - and did not add the corn (personal preference).  Homemade noodles were sooo good.

Excellent recipe. I followed it to the T except, it didn't necessarily need 2 hours for the vegetables, mine were good after an hour to hour and a half. I also added a bay leaf, rosemary and parsley along with the chicken salt and pepper. I used cooked up chicken breast and it was perfection.  This was the first time I'd ever made homemade noodles and they were amazing!

Really good.  I had about 3 cups of homemade broth to less then a half of chicken, and it about a cup of broth shy of perfection.  Next time will add some store bought.

The perfect cold medicine.   Nixed the chicken bouillon since the stock was homemade, and added some fresh savory from the garden, dried thyme, and parsley. The amount of noodles seemed a bit much [2 cups of flour is almost enough to make a loaf of bread], so I halved the noodle recipe.  Still seemed to be bursting at the seams with noodles, but the end result couldn't have been better.

Oh my god!!! This turned out fantastic!  I am eating it right now and wow.  I did take some liberties on the measurements but it turned out very well.  I used three cartons of Swanson chicken broth (the big ones), I doubled the amount of noodles and used canned corn instead of frozen.  It is delicious!

This recipe is fabulous! Like most others, I did make a few changes. Lacking time to make the noodles, I used store-bought bowties. For the vegetables, I used the recommended onions, carrots, and garlic, and added leeks for extra flavor. I made my own stock using boneless skinless chicken breasts simmering in water with extra chopped carrots, celery, onions, leeks, and garlic. The veggies and separate stock only needed to simmer for about 90 minutes to soften and cook; I combined them with the uncooked pasta, 1/2 teaspoon of ground black pepper and 1 teaspoon of garlic salt, plus a tablespoon of dried parsley and two bay leaves. I brought the whole thing to a boil and then reduced the heat to low, and let it simmer, covered, for about 30 minutes. The end results were amazing. Next time I'll definitely make my own noodles or dumplings, but with a few minor time-saving alterations, this recipe is a winner! Will definitely make again--thanks, LaDonna!

Wonderful!!! I didn't make my noodles but instead used the frozen Ream's brand. I kept everything else the same. This is a keeper!

I didn't like adding pre-made chicken to this. Broth is good, but I like more 'seasoning'.

I have made this soup numerous times now and what seems to top it off is the home made noodles everyone seems to love them. I cut them a bit larger so they are more dumpling size bites instead of small noodles. I love this recipe

Fantastic soup! I made it mostly because I felt too sick to go to the store, but it came out amazing even with my poorly rolled-out and cut noodles. They may have been shaped differently than I am used to, but they had much better texture and were more filling and delicious than ever. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Wow! This made a ton of soup! I did use ready made noodles instead of making my own, otherwise I followed the recipe. It was a very satisfying chicken noodle soup. Will make this again.

I made this last night and am very happy I did!  The only change I made was to add a couple of spoons of "Better Than Bouillon Chicken Base."  The noodles are more flavorful than what I usually make, and I use this recipe in the future.  It is also very good the next day.

Delicious, classic flavor.  I wish the directions were more specific about the amount of water to add.  "Large stockpot" can mean a lot of different things.  Mine happens to be 8 qt. size, so adding water to 2" below the rim was just a bit much.  Next time I'll know better. I added 1/2 tsp. poultry seasoning for a bit of add'l flavor.  Will definitely make this again!

This soup is simply wonderful!  Wasn't sure about the homemade noodles so since it was my first time making this, I used store bought egg noodles.  Also omitted the corn and added a bit of rosemary.  Will definitely make again and again.  (and will try making the homemade noodles since i know the soup turns out great!)

The soup was very good, but something happened to the noodles. They were the consistency of raw dough, even though I cooked them more than 30 minutes. Seems like it needs something to make them rise, like baking powder.

This is yummy. I did not have time to do noodles and favor rice so I added 2 cups of cooked white rice at the end. (made in my rice cooker while soup was simmering). Added a bit of rosemary and a dash of basil.  So good!

My first time making home made noodles. This was great and easy to make but did take a little time. I mixed the noodle dough in my stand mixer and I'm glad I had it. Was thinking it would be nice to have one of those handy pasta attachments for my mixer but I thought it was a great extra arm workout today :) I used leftover turkey and added just a little thyme. I didn't simmer for 2 hours as it was getting late for dinner. Thanks for a great recipe.

Oh. My. Goodness. This recipe is classically what a chicken noodle soup should be. My family loved it. The time spent making the noodles is absolutely worth every minute. I let the noodles dry while the soup simmered and they came out perfectly. The homemade noodles bring this recipe together like apples in apple pie; without them, it just wouldn't be the same. I added a cup of peas and a little Lawry's Seasoning Salt.

Excellent Soup!!  I didn't have a lot of time, so with a pre-cooked whole chicken from Trader Joe's, and two boxes of low fat and low sodium chicken broth... I followed another reviewer's suggestion to save time and sauteed vegetables in olive oil and garlic.  I used what leftovers I had (small zucchini, a few broccoli heads, a little celery and a few baby carrots) along with a chopped onion.  I used frozen peas instead of corn.  I didn't have time to try the homemade noodles (though am looking forward to trying them) and used really wide egg noodles.  We like LOTS of noodles, so I doubled the noodles called for.  Salt, Pepper, Garlic Salt, a dash of different season salts, some thyme and rosemary and my husband really loved it! Thanks for this easy and basic recipe that only took about an hour and 1/2!!

This is by far the best chicken noodle soup I've ever eaten and prepared.  The recipe give you a good starting point and allows you to adjust to your taste.  The only downfall is the preparation time but it is well worth the wait.

My family loved this.  Kids helped roll out the noodles. Very easy, but a little time consuming.

Even though this may be time consuming, it is well worth the wait.  It turned out so good, I ended up sharing some with family and friends.

Very good soup.  I will never by noodles again.  I never realized how east the noodles were to make and how much better they taste.  My noodles were not pretty to look at but they were delicious!

We all liked this recipe. I added some poultry seasoning, Cajun seasoning and some Old Bay beyond the recommended seasonings. The noodles were pretty easy to make and precisely to our families taste.

This was a big hit at our house. The only change I made was to use Reemes noodles instead of making my own. Delicious! Thank you!

This recipe would feed 8 -10 people easily.  The kids loved it. I thought there was a little too much sweet corn with a 14 ounce package. I also used frozen noodles for convenience. The chicken was from a bulk grilling session that was boned and frozen for later use. The grilled meat gave an interesting twist on taste. I'm freezing the rest today for meals later. I'll certainly make this again.

Loved the recipe but it was vague on how much noodles you use. If you never made homemade noodles not sure how much this recipe makes. I used egg noodles . Used 4 cups worth for the amount I made. 
Also how big was the stock pot in this recipe. There are so many different sizes. Ours is a 16 quart. Thank God my husband is good with this kind of math. 
Otherwise a good recipe.

Delicious!! Well worth the extra few minutes needed to make the homemade noodles - they made ALL the difference!! I cooked my chopped raw chicken in the broth and skipped adding the chicken bouillon. We will definitely make this again!!

Super yummy and easy. Rolled thinner than other noodles I've made. I used half white and half Golden Wheat flour (Aka White Whole Wheat). Worked well.

I used matzah balls instead of noodles but really enjoyed the soup none the less.  I followed most of the recommendations of not adding salt and using reduced sodium broth and it turned out perfect.

This might as well be the best chicken noodle soup on the planet. I LOVED IT! Very tasty! I didnt use the pasta; instead, I used rice. And even though and made more minor changes here and there, it still turned out delicious, especially for someone who has no experience with soups!

This is a great recipe because it has more than just chicken and noodles!  I am a huge soup lover so I make this often.  I have proved to myself and others that I can make homemade noodles so to save time I've used penne pasta or egg noodles instead.

I like this recipe a lot, though I can't imagine ever making it quite as it is listed.  I like to use this recipe for noodles, and then the recipe "Awesome Chicken Noodle Soup" for the broth, and then improvise on what goes in.  The noodles from this are really great - just like my grandma used to make.

This soup was awesome!  I sauted my veggies in olive oil instead of just boiling them which cut down on some of the time.  I also added more chicken broth (because it was so thick) and I also added some thyme.

Very quick, easy chicken soup. I feel that you could tell. Was not nearly as good as the real "all day" deal. Good for a week day meal though.

This is the soup my mom used to make!  My 4 year old daughter loved helping roll out the dough and separate and dry the noodles.  It is well worth the effort to make the noodles by scratch.
