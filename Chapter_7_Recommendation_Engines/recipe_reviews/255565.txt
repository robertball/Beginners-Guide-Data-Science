I made my own pizza dough instead of the pre-baked one.  This makes plenty of sauce for a couple of pizzas.  I did add some other veggies, thinly sliced zucchini, onions and a few mushrooms.  I will also admit to using full fat ingredients so it wasn't too guilt free, but it was pretty darned tasty.

I tested my new cast iron pizza pan using this recipe. It turned out fantastic! We loved it. I had some ground chicken which had been browned already so that was the meat. Other than that, no modifications to the recipe.
