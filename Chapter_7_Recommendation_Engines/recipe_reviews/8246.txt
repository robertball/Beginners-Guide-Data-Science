My boyfriend is in Iraq and has been for almost a year.  I found this recipe and thought I should make it.  I made him 2 cake jars and sent them.. He LOVED them, a week and a half later I got a letter wanting 15 for his friends.  They loved them!  So if you have a loved one overseas..send this!  They will appreciate this!

The taste of this cake is great! Just make sure that you use the jars that don't have any "shoulders" and that the sides are straight up and down.  Otherwise, the cake will fall ( I know from experience.)

I make these all the time, because as a single person a whole cake is just too much for me to eat before it goes bad. But these work out great! One jar is just enough for 2 servings and I can eat that before the cake dries out. Plus, I don't have to turn on the over to bake very often. I usually make 2 or 3 different recipes and that will get me thru at least 6 months. I have given these as presents to folks in nursing homes, college, or away from home for extended periods. I like the idea of sending them to the troops in Iraq a lot! I may just have to do something like that for christmas this year. 
BTW, you can use any cake recipe that uses baking powder. I have canned banana bread, spice cake, marble cake and many others. Just make sure you never fill the jar more than half full and keep plenty of space between the jars to ensure even baking. 
Thanks for a great recipe and a great idea for Christmas this year.

This worked great!  I'm so excited to be able to make something from scratch that will last a long time and can be used in food storage.  I made sure to mix up the batter before I boiled the jar, so the jar was already hot when I put it in the oven to bake.  No problems at all.

We tried this recipe.  What a great idea!  However, although we followed the instructions to the letter, all we got was an oven full of overflowing cake.  One jar baked on one side and had a huge hole on the other; the other jar spewed all over the oven and left very little in the jar.  Our oven/stove is one year old.

These are great cakes.  I added a little rum before I "sealed" it and they turned out great.  Thanks for a very easy & tasty recipe.

I have made this recipe many many times & love the taste.  It is the moistest cake, no icing needed.  They also make great Christmas gifts for single/smaller households.  No waste & good to the last bite.  Ty

I received this in a Christmas gift exchange.  It was cute, pretty and tasted okay.  I prefer fresh cake but in a pinch this is a nice substitute.

I just want to thank you for this recipe.  My son just returned from Afghanistan after being there for 7 months and I sent him 6 of these cakes in a jar every month and he and his buddies loved them.  I didn't change a thing except to triple the recipe and leave out the walnuts.

My husband LOVED these. I make enough for 12 (a whole box of jars) and his fellow soldiers in Afghanistan are constantly begging him for my cooking. This one is their favorite!

I made this cake and it is a wonderful cake but it went all over the oven. It was all over the sides of the jar and I had only filled this up to about a little over 3/4 of the jar. It had made a giant mess in the oven and all over the sides of the jar. Wonderful cake though and was very moist.

Cakes in jars make great gifts. It should be noted the shelf life may not be as long as you think. There is just not enough acid in the cake to prevent botulism. I would  suggest freezing for long term storage or refrigerate for short term storage.
