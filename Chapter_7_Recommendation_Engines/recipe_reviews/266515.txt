7.31.18  Have to make one recommendation:  PLEASE do not simmer your canned clams for 20-25 minutes or until the potatoes are tender.  Your clams already are cooked, so all you need to do is heat them, otherwise, you’ll end up with rubbery, chewy clams.  Drain the clams, and add that juice to the milk/potato mixture early on.  When you add the cream at the end, that’s when I’d recommend you add your clams, and heat for about 5 minutes..  That’s the only change that I made to this recipe, and it turned out pretty darn well.  Oops, I also did add a bit more cayenne (personal taste preference).   I could see adding a bay leaf to the milk/potato mixture next time to ramp up the flavor, and I'd probably cook a little extra bacon for a serving garnish.  It did take quite a bit of the cornstarch slurry to reach the slightly thickened chowder consistency, but I had it, and it was good.  This is an indulgence for me, but this creamy, flavorful chowder really hit the spot today!  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

Nice taste, but needs more bacon & clams. I also put my clams (this time I used the can) in at the end when I put the cream in. Think I may use both can & fresh clams if available. Didn't know if I should've removed any of the bacon grease from frying & I did. Next time I'll leave if a "reasonable" amount of fat is there instead of removing. I think the grease would add a lot of flavor.

Added more clams than call for. Everyone thought the soup was outstanding.

This is an excellent clam chowder. Even my daughter who doesn't like clam chowder enjoyed it. I forgot to add the cream at the end, but it was still great. I will make this again.

This recipe hit my taste buds just right.  Will now make this recipe again and again.  I only cook for one, so, sadly,  it doesn't matter what anyone else thinks.

I did indeed make this! And I'm glad I did! I chose a few creative licenses. Made it into a seafood cioppino by adding crab meat and fish. Held out the cornmeal because it changed the color to a golden color. I was raised in Santa Barbara and my childhood revolves around New England style milky white chowder. Next, and I'm only telling you because I like you, I add MSG. It's the dirty little secret all great chefs hide in the back of their spice rack.
