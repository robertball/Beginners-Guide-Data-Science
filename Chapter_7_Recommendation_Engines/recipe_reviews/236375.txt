Makes about 1 cup of sauce.    Use a regular mouth canning jar to make your next sauce measure the oil directly into the jar using the index on the side. Add the vinegar, spices, salt, pepper, and minces garlic. Now pack the fresh herbs carefully into the jar.  Put the rubber ring, blender blades, and screw base onto the top of the jar. Tighten securely. Blend according to instructions. Remove the blender blade assembly and cover with a regular canning jar lid and band. Refrigerate until ready to use.

I suggest using any oil rather than olive. When you keep it in the fridge it congeals. In Argentina we use chimichurri as a seasoning for meat,  so I don't use cilantro. It goes better with fish or vegetables. What I sometimes add to "gourmet it up" is a couple of sundried tomatoes

Excellent version of Chimichurri sauce. Made it as written, served over seared skirt steak, and didn't need to adjust anything (though I did--just a bit of lemon juice, as I love the flavor, but definitely good, and authentic, without it). One thing that would improve the recipe, though,  is to specify the exact amount of parsley. Perhaps by specifying how many cups of stripped parsley leaves, as you did with the cilantro and oregano? Saying "1 bunch" doesn't really work for someone who has never tasted Chimichurri sauce before, i.e. how do they know how much parsley flavor there should be, versus the other ingredients? And, of course, parsley comes in differing size bundles...

To give this recipe a 5 stars is an injustice.   It really deserves 10 stars!  I made this last night to go with a slow cooked beef shank in a wine reduction.   It was amazing!!!   The only thing I did differently is add more garlic because we like extra garlic.  Other than that, this recipe is good to go as is.  My boyfriend and I enjoyed it so much,  we ate the whole bowl.  Couldn't stop.  It was THAT good.  Thank you, Chef John for sharing such a fantastic recipe.  We very much enjoyed it!   No doubt we will be making this again very soon.

Wow, this was perfect. I always make chimichurri and usually just eyeball ingredients, taste, and add as needed. I followed this recipe almost exactly ,i tasted it and it was perfect! I didnt have to add anything! I only had 2 tablespoons of white wine vinegar and didnt have fresh oregano so I used about a few shakes of dried oregano. It was such a perfect balance of flavors. This will be my go to chimi recipe from now on!

Made it last night, and it was delicious! I couldn't find my regular recipe, and this was a great substitute! Since I didn't have white wine vinegar, I used an equal measure of rice vinegar and a little bit of lemon juice. I also used powdered garlic and dried oregano instead of fresh (definitely recommend fresh garlic if you have it in the house, but powdered worked fine as well.) This chimichurri was beautiful on top of grilled chicken breast, and tasted amazing!! (As for sides, we used roasted asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes with mini marshmallows, just for fun!) Thanks Chef John!

I could have eaten the sauce as a main course. I added the juice of a lime wedge for a little more tang. Delicious as a dip for grilled shrimp as well as meats

Oh Chef, what have you done to our family!  This was recipe was an instant sensation in the house (kids and adults).  It killed any chance of using a prepared chimichuri sauce and now if the kids hear the word 'steak' they request it. 

Needless to say we love it.  It is pretty easy to make and even freezes well (desperate times call for desperate measures!).  I keep a stash when our older child just "needs" his green sauce!!

So thanks for a great recipe.

Delicious! Used red wine vinegar because I didn'the have white. We had company over for a bbq and used it as a condiment on grilled shrimp, salmon, steak and veg. There was none left. Will definitely make again.

I loved it. Followed the instructions as given. Love the acidity that this sauce brings to the dish. I had it with a Pork loin. But you can probably have it with any meat. Just wonderful.

I put this on EVERYTHING!
Perfect just the way it is but I like a bit more heat so I add a couple more peppers. 
A neat trick is to put all the ingredients in a mason jar and screw it directly to the base of the blender for a quick cleanup.

I made this sauce for a flank steak and it was delicious! I used 4 tbs of red wine vinegar and 1/2 tsp of hot pepper flakes for an extra kick of heat. We actually had plent left over to pair with over easy eggs, avocado and re fried beans for breakfast. We will enjoy making this often!

Very good recipe for chimichurri. I did add a shallot because it usually calls for it and I like the flavor. Other than that, I changed nothing. It was a huge hit. Will make again but will always add a shallot. Oh and I doubled it. If I made it as written, I'd probably use a half a shallot. Thanks for a delish recipe!

After searching high and low for the perfect go to chimichurri recipe this is it!  The balance of flavors is perfect.  I served it with grilled flap meat the first night, but have been eating the leftovers with pretty much anything I can put it on.  Thank you for sharing!

Five stars doesn’t even give this justice! It’s easy, delicious and you can play with the spices and vinegar to your taste. Do yourself a favor and make a large batch-you’re going to want to put this on everything ??

I loved this recipe. We are big fans of Aioli & also basil pesto. This is a new favorite sauce. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I doubled it, but didn't double the salt. This is definitely worth making!!

Yummy! I used 2x as much parsley as cilantro - found it needed a little more oil and vinegar to thin it out. I love the touch of cumin and used sherry vinegar - I added a little lemon too. So good!

I tried making this in the blender, but ended up transferring it to my food processor. The flavor and balance of this sauce is amazing! The only change I made was sherry vinegar in place of white wine vinegar, because I love it. Fantastic!

Outstanding. Fairly easy to make. No changes made. We grilled out chicken and used the Chimichurri but I can see how most meats will be complimented by the sauce.  Lovely stuff!

My husband didn't care for this, but I loved it!  He's a little picky so I wasn't surprised.  Dipped roasted chicken into this.  YUM!!!

I made it, but the olive oil was much too strong, overtaking a lot of other flavors, I would use a more neutral oil. 

Also, when I went to Argentina,  didn't see anyone use cilantro. but other than that this recipe was pretty good!

I ran a google search and found www.morechimichurri.com and I thought theirs was pretty good

Quick tip from Argentina: first  add the dry ingredients:oregano, red pepper flakes, cummin, black pepper  etc (I add some paprika as well) and the chopped garlic. Pour a few spoons of hot boiling water in order to hydrate them and release all the flavors.  Then continue  with the rest. Some mustard goes also well. But please, don´t use cilantro!  Not the way to go!

*12/31/19:  I made this to put on grilled steak and salmon.  It was great!  I tripled the recipe, used a couple of extra garlic cloves (to use the whole head of garlic), and used red wine vinegar instead of white based on what I had available.  Will definitely make again!

I added the juice of half a lime and doubled the cumin. This recipe was delicious! We’ll be making again and again. We had with steak but I’m looking forward to trying it with grilled chicken as well.

This is the second chimichurri recipe I have tried!  Family loves it!  The only change made is that the cilantro was doubled and parsley omitted because I did not have and parsley.  Still it was delicious as a marinade for grilled
Chicken.

Delicious. I chose to hand chop the ingredients then mix with liquid and slices by hand. Gives more of a rustic texture which is more to our liking.

I make this quite often, and nothing compares.  So good!  I usually always have the fresh herbs growing,  and have even subbed dried oregano for the fresh at times.  Always perfect served with grilled flank steak or chicken. Yum!

Omg, this is amazing and would make cardboard taste good!
With some lemon juice to keep it green, it stays fresh for weeks in the fridge!
We enjoy it on grilled fish, chicken, empanadas, eggs, sandwiches, endless possibilities. 
Thanks for sharing your awesome recipe!

Yes - the hype is real.  I used this sauce over grilled chicken.  The husband and two picky teens overwhelmingly approved!  I used large garlic cloves, so it was very garlicky - which we love.  Soaked some fresh bread in it too.  Fought over who would lick the bowl clean. I will make a triple batch next time.  Thank you for this recipe.

Excellent flavor.  I had to use regular vinegar but only used 1 tbsp.  I omitted the oregano because we didn’t have any and the flavor was still great.  Might use a little less oil next time.

This is so flavorful and delicious. I use lime juice instead of vinegar, and it’s bomb. Perfect for any meat dish. It’s my 11-year-old daughter’s favorite!

This is such a great recipe!  Goes well with beef, chicken or seafood.  My only substitution was to use garlic oil instead of regular olive oil.  Chef John, you hit the ball out of the park yet again!

I made this for the chimichurri steak rice bowls. There was leftovers and I’ve been using it on everything. So yummy. I seriously ate it as a dressing on some chopped up romaine. It’s that good. I’ve added a picture of the rice bowl.

I love chimichurri, but I admit, I used this recipe as a guide more than anything, omitting this, adding more of that.....
Sauce is really forgiving, but don't forget the vinegar!   I read that in Argentina they don't use oregano or cumin in it because it doesn't grow there.

I love this chimichurri sauce! my whole family raved about it. I will admit to adding a couple ingredients extra. I threw in some lime juice, and even threw in some fresh basil leaves because they were on my windowsill begging to be used, and I doubled up the red pepper because I like things spicy. So delicious!

I know that cilantro is not a traditional ingredient of authentic Argentinian chimichurri, but this condiment by Chef John was wonderful!  Added a bit of onion when processing the garlic. This sauce was a great addition to steak!

This made about 8 (1) TBSP servings for me. The taste is excellent and varying the herbs will allow you to find your perfect mix. I made it as advertised and no complaints. Using fresh herbs  is worth the hassle.

Note, if you use 1/4 cup of this per serving, you're having 28g of fat with your meal and over 250 cal. I scaled the portions back to where it made 8 servings and that fits much more easily into my macros while still providing enough sauce for each piece of meat.

This recipe is easy and amazing.  We used it as a sauce to accompany beef tenderloin.  I used half the garlic called for and it was still plenty garlicy.  I had very little fresh oregano so subbed dried oregano.  It turned out great and I will make this regularly with steaks.

Good tasting sauce however, 4 cloves of garlic is way too much. I will make this sauce again but use only 2 cloves of garlic and cut back on the salt as well.

Oh my goodness! I bought all fresh ingredients and made exactly as the instructions say. WOW! I can't wait for the spatchcock chicken to be ready so I can spread this on it! I haven't tried even one of Chef John's recipes and not be absolutely in love and impressed. Thank you so much for sharing these absolutely delicious recipes :)

Next time I'll use less cilantro, more garlic and blend the ingredients up without most of the oil, then add the oil in afterwards for a more traditional look.

This was the most amazing sauce! We made a rotisserie chicken on the grill and this was the perfect pairing. The sauce had so much flavor! We added extra cilantro because we thought it needed a little more but this was excellent!!! Yum!!!

Too much olive oil for me, but the flavor was spot on. It went very well with a lightly seasoned with salt and pepper lamb steak. Next time I will definitely cut the amount of olive oil by at least a third.

I've been meaning to try Chimichurri sauce and finally got the opportunity at our last summer BBQ. We had treated the family to rib eye steaks, and I had some free time, so I whipped up this recipe.
It was excellent, and a big hit with everyone. I'll be making this and experimenting with it on chicken and other meats, as well. Someone even suggested trying it as a salad dressing!

I made it and it was delicious! It was a little too salty but next time I'll just add the salt after. I didnt have white wine vinegar but used red wine vinegar instead. Other than that, it was great!

Loved this sauce, it made about 1 cup so I had left overs, which I put on anything I could think of.

Use less vinegar and omit oregano. 
Adjust for YOUR own tastes!

This is a fantastic sauce for BBQ.  I served it as one of 3 sauces for BBQ leg of lamb and BBQ brisket.  It was a big hit.  I used a little more garlic but basically made it without change.

Very good! We loved it and it doesn't make a ton which is great. I used red wine vinegar in place since that's what I had on hand. Still great flavor! Would make again

Not as crazy about vinegary flavor so use lemon instead, also way more garlic (8-10 cloves) and fresh serranos or pepines in lieu of red pepper. Also sometimes add a bit of fresh mint since I don't usually do cilantro.  Have used dried oregano fine in a pinch. I like mine more pasty which saves very well even on its own as a spread.
