This was awesome soup!  I started making chicken and spinach soup in the crockpot,  but then saw your recipe and decided to make this as the base instead of my version.     I added rotel tomatoes and a shake of cayenne pepper, because I like spicy.  Wasnâ€™t sure how that would come out with heavy cream, but.... it was amazing!  We all loved it!  Thank you for sharing!

Didn't find the chorizo so used hot and was good.

My husband is allergic to garlic so I used pepperoni instead of chorizo.   This is a good soup.
