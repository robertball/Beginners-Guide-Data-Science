These cookies were incredibly delicious!  Instead of instant coffee, I substituted in 1/4 cup of a hispanic brand of non-instant coffee called Cafe Bustelo with 4 tablespoons of water -flavor turned out to be great nevertheless.  Also, did not have almonds around the house so made the cookies without nuts and they still turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe!

I read the reviews, and decided to give this recipe a try. I made  it exactly as it is on the site, it was wonderful. Then, I decided to try some stronger coffee, we love the flavor at our house, I used Medaglia D'Oro, an instant espresso, the flavor is very 'mocha'. I like it just as well both ways, the cookies seemed to be moister with the instants espresso??? No reason to, the cookies are made the same way.

AWESOME recipe. Made exactly like it says here, tried the espresso powder as suggested in one review. I will make them this way forever! That powder gives such a rich, coffee flavor. Very good, got rave reviews at home and at work. Thanks for the great recipe!  There is no liqeur in this recipe. Also, if you change around all the ingredients, you aren't rating THIS recipe.

I usually like to rate recipes for how they are exactly without adding or taking anything away, but this time I was without liquer so I just used real coffee and was very impressed! SUPER GOOD

I was needing a comfort junk food fix and this fit the bill.  I did as some suggested and added 1/2 c. coffee and left out the almonds, as I did not have any on hand.  Very soft texture which I love, and it makes your house smell yummy.  Thanks ccsick for sharing this recipe.

I have been making these for a few years, since I found the recipe on this site.  They are really good, easy to make, and even kids like them.  I toast the almonds a little longer,so they are a dark-golden brown.  The last time I made them, I tried freezing them until a later date, and they came out fine.  The freezing didn't harm the nuts or cookie at all.  This recipe is a keeper!

Nice...I've messed up some of the highly-rated recipes here but this one turned out just right. I used coffee powder instead of granules and the taste was just right. One weird thing though- I altered the recipe to make 12 but ended up with enough dough for 24 (using a teaspoon). If I would have liked to add some coffee liquer but I didn't have any on hand.

Heavenly!  I used Starbucks espresso powder instead of coffe, I also doubled the vanilla.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I froze the cookies in a ziplock bag and remembered them just in time for a vacation trip.  My whole family loved the cookies and I really just made them for my husband and older son who enjoys coffee.  I never dreamt that all the kiddos would love them too!  The fam said this will now be a vacation tradition.  Thanks for such a wonderful cookie recipe!

I modified this quite a bit. Used 1/4 c. of cocoa, a few Tblsp of milk, added some cinnamon. Used walnuts instead of almonds. 1/2 brown sugar + 1/2 c. white, 2 Tbsp of instant espresso mixed w/2 rsp of hot water, 1 1/4 c. flour + 1 egg...  Then, for fun, rolled the balls of dough in powdered sugar. Oh my...these were yummy!

If you want a good mocha flavour use instant espresso powder instead of instant coffee granules.  Also, try it with cinnamon chips or add a 1/2 to 1 tsp of ground cinnamon to the flour mixture for another dimension of flavour.

Delicious!!! Coffee lovers this is a great little twist to the regular chocolate chip cookie! I used about 2/3 instant coffee and a few teaspoons of regular ground coffee to kick it up a notch. Next time, I might put even more coffee in it! I didn't use almonds (didn't have it in my cupboard). And next time I might even add white chocolate chips for colour contrast. Yummmy!!

Amazing recipe even for non-coffee drinkers. You might want to reduce the number of chocolate chips though to half though.

We liked these cookies, they were a nice change from regular chocolate chip cookies.  The first time I made them, I only had a cheap brand of coffee and I didn't think they had a very strong coffee flavor.  The next time I made them, I made sure I had a good brand of coffee in and they were so much better.  My advice would be to spend the extra on a good coffee - it really is worth it.  The cookies themselves had a nice texture and this recipe is definitely one I will use often.

Delicious Cookies!! I followed the recipe almost exactly except for using walnuts instead of almonds and chopped dark chocolate in place of the chocolate chips. These are very rich and yummy cookies.  My 13yr old loved them, the younger kids not so much:).  The only problem I had was that this made a very thick dough and the cookies were not spreading at all while baking. I pressed them down a little during baking and they came out fine.  Next time I will just flatten the dough out a bit before baking...because there WILL be a next time-YUMMO!

I was very excited to make these cookies. And I'll have to admit, I was a little bit disappointed with the results. The cookies were a bit too heavy for my taste. I had some friends of mine try them and none of them took a second. It wasn't because they weren't tasty, but they are the kind of cookies you can only eat one. I don't think I'll make them again :(

I found this cookie to be very flavorful, but a little on the dry side when forming the cookies, thus having a crisper cookie.  Did anyone else have this problem? It could just be the climate here.   I am not a fan of almonds, so I left them out, but I thought the cookie was delicious without them.  I had some leftover Ghiradelli Chocolate Truffle coffee from this morning, so I boiled it on the stove until it became syrupy, and then added 3 Tbl in lieu of the espresso/instant coffee.  Found the flavor to be very intense and wonderful.

This recipe was very good, and I plan on using it again.  I only gave it four stars because it needs more coffee added to it to really give it that flavor.  I also changed it by added chocolate chunks instead of chips.  Very good.

I made one change. I used 1/4 cup of chilled margarine and 1/4 cup room temp shortening. I find using all butter is too rich and all margarine makes the cookies spread too much. I made half the batch with no choc chips, other half with. Using a #24 scoop I got about 52 cookies. Batch for 10 min but the cookies were a bit under done for my liking. Coffee used was cheap instant no name brand. Flavour was quite strong for me. I'd probably reduce coffee by half the amount next time.

Just made these tonight and the aroma is wonderful. The taste is even better. I used instant espresso powder, a little less than the recipe called for. I will be making these all the time.

Great recipe, I substituted chocolate raspberry coffee but added 1/4 cup instead of the recipe requirements. I also used butterscotch chips and it turned out great! I made sure to keep the dough in the fridge for an hour before or half hour in freezer. The cookies may not seem done after about 8-9 minutes but if you give them time to sit they are perfect. I put mine in the freezer right out of the over to help the process. I have never made cookies with coffee but this was a great idea and it has become a new trademark ingredient that I will be sure to add to cookies in the future! Thanks for the recipe!!

The last time I went to Panera I had a cappuccino and dipped a thick chocolate chip cookie into it just out of curiosity-SO GOOD!!! So I thought something like this would be incredible. Let me just say that I was slightly underwhelmed by the outcome-I did make a change where I used half white sugar and half brown (personal preferance), left out the almonds, and used instant espresso. They came out thick and chewy like I like them but they didn't have much of a coffee taste to it. There was definately an aftertaste of coffee and they are dark in color but I hoped for something better. But the family loved them and I will be making them again. One of the better recipes I have tried.

These cookies are amazing if you love coffee and chocolate! =) The almonds are a great touch. I think I accidentally used walnuts instead but that was really good too. One tip is to put the dough in the fridge between batches while some cookies are baking. It makes the dough easier to work with and less sticky.

These cookies are one of my favorite. Let me suggest the slivered almonds, they give the cookies a little added crunch and texture. There is no liqeur in the recipe as one reviewer mentioned. I was thrown by that and didn't make the cookies because I thought I had to  have liqeur. The recipe clearly calls for instant espresso powder. I get a mexican variety at our local grocery. Love these and make them often!!!

We're about to make our third batch for Thanksgiving. We left out the almonds and tossed out the teaspoon servings as well. We're putting 12 cookies on a full size sheet, so we get about 24 from a double batch (compare to 96.) It does require about double the bake time, but they are delicious and MESSY! Thank you for this fantastic recipe!

These were really great!  I used apples sauce instead of the butter and shredded coconut instead of almonds.  I also added 1 teas coconut extract and only 1 cup sugar.  They were great but I'd recommend flattening them some as before they bake and I'll leave out some of the chocolate chips next time since there were quite a lot!  :-)  Thanks for the recipe!  (Oh, and the coffee flavor was great too!  I used 1/2 cup instant coffee and dissolved it in coffee instead of water.)

Made this recipe twice, once with almonds and once without. I prefer the almonds added in - gives it much more depth of flavor. However, I will not use the recommended amount of flour anymore - will definitely have to pare that down. Overall, pretty good taste. Thanks for sharing!

I followed the recipe exactly and thought these cookies were really good!  Just the right taste of chocolate and coffee.  Most of the time I like cookies best right out of the oven, but I like these better after a few hours.

Really liked these as they're not overly sweet.  Very cakey though.  I added almost double the coffee as I like a strong flavour and some corn starch to make them chewy.  Next time will add less flour and double the almonds, although they're still just as good without any.

These cookies were wonderful, they stayed soft even the next day.  Very strong coffee flavor, luckily that's what we like.  Only change I made was using a greased cookie sheet, the first batch really stuck to the pan.

It seems I'm in the minority but I didn't care for these cookies...too much dense coffee flavor! I could try the recipe again using less coffee but I probably won't.

I agree w/ Teresa JF's review- cookies are too thick and no one took seconds. Next time instead of this recipe I'll modify the chocolate chocolate chip recipe as Diane McAfee did, remove coco and add the instant coffee.

I made this recipe exactly as written - They're a great chocolate chip cookie with a subtle coffee flavor.  Next time I'll boost the instant coffee or switch to espresso powder. I baked for 9 minutes so they were still gooey inside. Yum!

As per the recipe it spreads too much for my liking.  second time around I added an additional cup of flour and had the puffed cookies like the picture shows.  Loved the taste of the coffee with the cocoa and raisins.  P.S. I am a chef

I followed the recipe with the exception of substituting the butter with margarine because that is what I had on hand. The end result was ok, not great. I am usually a fan of all things coffee, however, this ended up tasting somewhat bitter. I would not make it again.

I used 2 salted dark chocolate bars and broke them up in chunks.  I also made them small, because these spread on the baking sheet while in the oven.  I also used Starbucks Italian Roast Via packets for the instant coffee granules.  In the past, I've used instant espresso by Medaglia D'oro.  Any nut works in this recipe, and toasted hazelnuts are great.  This is a different tasting cookie--more bittersweet.  I've used this recipe for 20 years and love it.

very chocolatey. i am not a very good cook but i did ok on these. i loved that you have to  liquify the granules other recipes just have you dump the instant coffee in the mix. i will try espresso powder next time for a stronger coffee taste. i used a generic coffee and i didn't really taste coffee but cookies still good.

I did not space them 3 inches apart and they did not grow into each other, so that was fine. Also I used a half tablespoon scoop, which is a teaspoon and a half, instead of the teaspoonful that it suggested. Other than that, I followed the recipe and instructions and they are great!

Really great recipe, I followed it exactly except the suggested size of teaspoonfuls... Teaspoons, really?? Those would be tiny!! But otherwise, awesome stuff. One thing I noticed is they were a little on the dry side. Maybe I'll cook them 8 minutes instead of 10 next time.

I substituted Guittard cappuccino chips for the chocolate. I like the flavor of coffee, but not chocolate. The cappuccino chips gave the cookies a full coffee flavor.

Good, but not as good as I had hoped. I found them to be a little too crispy and the coffee flavour wasn't as stong as I would have liked. The almonds were a very nice touch, though.

Oh so good! I didn't happen to have any almonds so I substituted with pecans which I roasted and chopped. Beautiful texture, and the subtle coffee flavor with the chocolate makes these cookies my new favorite!

This recipe is pretty good, but a tip: don't dissolve the coffee; instead, just pour the desired amount as a powder. And the next time I make this, I would probably put more coffee, reduce the flour to 2 cups, and make the butter 1 cup instead of 1/2.

Do yourself a favor and just plan on doubling the recipe....because these do not last long.  Followed the recipe exact but did not have the nuts.   They were amazing anyways and only lasted 24hrs.

Took others suggestion & added cinnamon - 1 tsp. I'm not a fan of almonds in cookies, so I used almond extract instead of vanilla. We really liked these, but it won't be something I make frequently. Even the cat liked the smell of these & went after the bag we had them in. They're especially good with some chocolate ice cream.

The only problem that I found with the recipe, was that it did definitely need more of a coffee flavor. I would probably add less chocolate chips the next time I make them, but these cookies were really good. They are now my Grandma's favorite cookie! Thanks for the great recipe!

I thought these cookies were delicious and easy, although I wish I had read through the reviews and used espresso powder for a little extra coffee flavor since we are big coffee people.  I didn't make any alterations to the ingredients, but I did cut it in half and still got 32 cookies out of it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Overall, this was a nice addition to the cookie...but next time will add more coffee.  My "taste testers" did not notice they had coffee in them until I mentioned it!

Great tasting cookies, but that is one stiff dough!
