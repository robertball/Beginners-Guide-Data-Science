They turn out hard rubbery when hot when starting to cool they turn cold. Cucumbers aren't meant to be fried.

I have tried them this way before using the flour. I also use corn meal sometimes and my secret recipe I use crushed crackers. That adds just enough salt to the cucumbers. Use an egg and water presoak before rolling in crackers crumbs. Best way I found to crush the crackers is to place a tube of crackers inside a gallon zip-lock and seal it all but about an inch for air to escape. Then use a can of soup or veggies and roll it over the crackers until they are crumbled to your liking. The good thing about this classic is you can enjoy them all year round.

This didn't work at all. For starters why you'd ever need 5 eggs and 1/4 cup of milk for 2 cucumbers is beyond me but I won't go there. I grew up on fried green tomatoes but they are hard to come by so I really wanted this to work. It doesn't. They don't ever get crispy and eventually start to burn in spots while trying to get a crisp on them. The batter doesn't stay on them and in the end the middle is mush. My thoughts on it after the fact is that cucumbers are too wet and hold a lot more moisture than a green tomato does or even a zucchini. You might have more success if you placed the sliced cucumbers in a colander sprinkled them with salt and let them drain 30 minutes prior to battering and frying. It might work but I'm not going to bother testing it out.
