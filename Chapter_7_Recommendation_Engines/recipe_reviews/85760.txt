This recipe is definitely a keeper. I made it for the first time last night and everyone loved it - two racks of ribs are GONE. Grilling them in the foil packets covered with sauce made for ribs so tender the meat was falling off the bones. The BBQ sauce and applesauce combination gave just the right sweet/spicy taste. These are definitely going to become a staple in my menu planning. 

ETA:  The last time I made these ribs I used a disposable foil pan rather than wrapping them in sheets of foil. Believe me, it didn't affect the taste at all, but was much, much easier to handle on the grill. I just prepared the ribs as directed using the foil pan, which I then covered with foil. Made cleanup a breeze.

First I wanna say that this was the first time I ever cooked ribs. I know how to cook dogs and hamburger on the grill but never ribs. I followed the instructions and by far the best ribs I ever tasted. My wife said that I set the bar for her taste buds. My brother and mother told me that I might have them beat (they are experienced grillers). I used spared ribs instead of baby back which I will try next time. Watching my friends and family licking the bone clean was well worth the time and effort. Thanks for the recipe:)

This was absolutely delicious!! I did a couple things differently but otherwise the recipe was very close to the original. I added liquid smoke and I cooked them in the oven for 3.5 hours at 300 degrees. This was from the frig to the oven. Very very tender, and was a big hit with all. I have a smoker and smoke my ribs very often, while these are not at that quality, with the added liquid smoke, it comes close.

The ribs turned out great. after cooking them on the grill for 1 hour it looked like the ribs where done, i made the exactly to the tee and the only sucestion is that instead after removing the ribs from the foil do not let them sit on the grill fr 30 mins. way too long; next time i will cut the time to 5 mins per side. the sauce in this turned out great and just be careful when you ad the pepper because it ads a kick.
Thanks

I marinaded over night and ended up baking in the oven.  I baked them for 3 hours total = 1 1/2 hours at 250* and then turned heat up to 300* and baked another 1 1/2 hours. I baked them in a foil pouch in a pan.  The last 10 minutes I added extra bbq sauce and then broiled for 5-10 minutes to crisp them up.  They were fall off the bone delish!!! Even my boyfriend who 'doesn't like meat on bones' loved this!

This was wonderful! I just happen to keep applesauce on hand; the ribs were moist and delightful, and my mother-in-law loved it.

Mt family really liked these. As some other reviewers did, I baked them for 2 hours at 350 and then just finished them off on the barbecuse because I was afraid they would burn if I followed the grilling directions. I also found the half the sauce was more than enough for the full amount of ribs. Thanks!

Giving this a mediocre review, but the issue could have been me or the recipe.  Cooking over "high" heat to me is too vague.  My grill goes to 1200 if I let it...is that high?  I kept it at 400 and the bottom of the foil was rock hard burned and stuck to the ribs.  Do you keep the cover down?  That affects the temp so would have been good to know.  That being said, the sauce was good, though I would do 3:1 Q sauce to apple.  I think this works better if you marinate overnight then either smoke or cook on indirect grill heat.

Very nice recipe - I guess it depends what barbeque sauce you use with it how it changes the flavor.  I cooked in oven in foil at 375 for 45 minutes, then reduced to 325 for another 45 min.  Then on bbq in foil another 30 minutes (not over flame) and finished with them direct on the grill, basting and cooking for about 20 min.  Was yummy and husband gave it a 9 on 10!  Thanks for sharing!

Oh what tender ribs these are! The foil does wonders! After one hour I took the foil off and flip the ribs on the opposite side for about 7mins and they were done. Becareful not to cook too long, they will become tuff! But a great recipe and detailed instructions. Thanks!

We really enjoyed this, I have to say it depends on the BBQ sauce you have on hand, I had only heavy smoked flavor so i reduced BBQ to 2 cups. Nice,tasty and will make again.

A great marinade/sauce.  I only marinated the ribs for 2 hours though, due to bad planning.  I also cooked them in the oven instead (wrapped in the foil and on a shallow pan to catch the juices) for 4 hours @ 300 degrees.  They were so tender and juicy that they fell right off the bone.

Really a great sauce, you might want to double it, I wish I had as I kept finding thing to dip into it while it was cooking just to make sure it was as good as it was, no changes need be made on this one!

This is realy a wonderful recipe. However, I would not recommend cooking these on high on your grill for the one hour time it calls for. Every grill is different and even though we cooked the ribs for less than the recommended 1 hour, we found our ribs extremely burnt on the bottom. I would definitely use this recipe again, but I would not grill these in the foil on high again. I would reduce the flame. Otherwise this is a very simple and flavorful recipe.

These were really tasty and easy.  I added different seasoning to the ribs, also after marinating them overnight, I cooked them in the oven at 295 for about 2 hours and put them on the grill for about 15 minutes.  I did find they needed a little BBQ sauce on them when the came off, but this is my new way to make ribs, nice and tender.

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I will admit that I was hoping for a little more BBQ in comparison to the apple, but I added extra at the end.

This was the first time I have ever cooked ribs. They were absolutely delicious. The ribs were falling off of the bone. I used spare ribs instead of baby back but they were still amazing. I will definatly use this recipe again

Awesome! My family loved these ribs. I used half sweetened and half unsweetened applesauce, and half regular and half smoke flavored BBQ sauce. So GOOD!

Ribs came out moist and tender.  I think they could have been a little more seasoned, but that was my mistake.  Next time I'll adjust seasonings and I think they will be perfect.

This is my first time ever cooking ribs and only my second time using a grill. I followed the recipe exactly except I added crushed red pepper to the marinate mix. I added about 2 tsp of crushed red pepper and they were just the right amount of heat and sweetness. I will be using this recipe often.

Incredible ribs. I cook a lot of ribs and what I like most about this recipe is that they are cooked on the grill and quickly. Also, they have a very sweet taste. I added a little honey to mine to make the marinade stick a little more and to make them even sweeter. Awesome recipe.

These turned out great for me! The applesauce really gives them a great flavor! One tip-use your best judgment on how hot/hot fast your grill cooks food. I left mine on medium heat the whole time, and they were cooked “medium-well” in 90 minutes-one hour wrapped in the foil, and the last 30 minutes, directly on the grate.

I made the sauce and added apple jelly.  I placed the sauce on chicken and steaks.  People were going wild with the flavor.  Now for the ribs.  I used a dry rub with a brown sugar and bourbon rub.

This is definitely a keeper!  Used homemade applesauce my wife canned last fall, with bottled Bull's Eye sauce.  Delicious! 
I also used a lot more seasonings on the ribs before I added the sauce, and left it marinading overnight.

For a quicker oven version of this recipe  preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.  Reduce sauce by half. Slice ribs into 3 bone sections. Place them meat side up in a Dutch Oven  and pour the sauce mixture over them. Bake for 2 hours. Spoon the sauce sitting on the bottom over the top of the ribs. The meat will be  moist, delicious, and fall right off the bone.

Great sauce. Only problem was 9 lbs of ribs so I figured 9/9, since recipe calls 4/4 for 4 lbs. Way too much sauce, no matter how much was put on. Into the freezer for other dishes it goes lol. Also, had problem with foil "baking" to bottom of ribs. Other than that gr8 responses .

The ribs were excellent. I agree the sauce could be cut in half.

Mixed up 1 c each of the bbq and apple sauce, this seemed just the right amount for a 2 1/4 lb loin back rib pack.  Mixed up the seasonings together before rubbing on. Only got to marinate for 5 hours. 
The family was split on this recipe. It wasn't a wow for us, but it wasn't bad. They felt it needed a little more flavor. But, it was still pretty yummy I thought. Thanks for the recipe.

SWEET! And you can always freeze some of the marinade (before putting on the ribs).
