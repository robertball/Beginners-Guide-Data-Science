11.29.18  I made one change on this recipe,  I baked the meatballs instead of frying. My ground beef was 80/20, not lean as listed in the recipe, so that was part of the reason I baked them, allowing the fat to cook out. I put the meatballs on a cooking spray-coated rack over a foil-lined sheet pan, and baked for 20 minutes at 375ºF (easy clean up is the other reason for baking).  FYI, I ended up with 32 meatballs.  If I tasted these meatballs without knowing the name of the recipe or the ingredients, I doubt I’d ever think they were Asian.  I’ve never had Vietnamese meatballs before, so maybe the Asian flavor is supposed to come from the dipping sauce which was good and did bring this together.  Interesting that you put the meatball mixture into a food processor, but I do think that it resulted in a very fine, smooth meatball texture.  The meat balls were good, just not what I was expecting, but I was not totally unhappy when served with the tasty sauce.

I doubled the ginger, onion, and fish sauce. Used 2 tablespoons of honey and 1 1/2 lbs of meat. I did not have chili pepers so I drizzled in some Sriracha. I then used a egg to mix and hold all together. I did NOT blend in a food processor but mixed with my hands. I also baked in a tin lined pan (instead of frying) at 325 for 30 min and then shut off the oven and left them in as I did other things. It turned out AMAZING. The fat/gravy grease was also packed full of flavor and amazing. I wish it had more gravy grease as it is wonderful over steamed rice. This made 45 meatballs which went WAY to fast. Excellent basic reciepe to build off of.
