I made this with thinly sliced leftover beef fillet tenderloin instead of bacon. I am sure bacon is just as good. Bacon  and steak would probably be heavenly. Resist the temptation to cook the egg in the potato longer than the stated time if you want the yolk to be slightly runny. Two of my eggs were completely set because they do continue to cook after removed from the oven. Itâ€™s probably best to use room temperature eggs. My folks told me this was a Michelin Star restaurant breakfast... I really enjoyed it.
