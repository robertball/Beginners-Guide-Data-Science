This was great!  It went perfectly with the Satay Chicken on this site which was absolutely delish!   I used my own vegetables in stead of the frozen and skipped the chicken tenders since I was serving it with chicken.  Plenty of leftovers but they only lasted until lunch the next day.  I'm surprised it only got three and a half stars with such great flavor and ease.  Will definitely make this again.

My kids loved it!  My husband loved it!  I deep fried tofu in canola oil.  I previously marinated it in peanut sauce.  I did this instead of the chicken tenders.  I liked it!
