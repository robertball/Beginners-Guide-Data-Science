12.4.15   Instead of frying the meatballs, I baked them for 15 minutes at 350°F (healthier and no grease splatter to deal with), and I did garnish with some sliced Kalamata olives.  I scaled the recipe down to 5 servings, and used a small cookie scoop for shaping the meatballs.  I ended up with 30 small meatballs from 1 lb of ground beef, and filled each pita half with three.  Wanted to be sure that the meatballs were small enough to fit inside the halved pitas to make it easier to eat with your hands without all the goodies spilling out and the bread breaking, and just less mess (hope that makes sense).  The spices in the meatballs were spot on, they were very tender and flavorful, reminiscent of Mediterranean food.  I think the sauce needs to be spiced up, the plain tomato sauce on its own is pretty bland which is a shame for such a nice recipe.  And that’s not to say that we didn’t enjoy them, we did!

This recipe made a very good meatball.  We stopped the slow cooker at exactly 4 hours and the meatballs were firm and still held together nicely.  The feta cheese made for a great topping and really elevated the dish.  My family really enjoyed it.  I love pita bread and it makes for a great vessel for the meatballs.  I would add spring mix or some lettuce next time right at the end for crunch.

We really enjoyed the flavors of these meatballs in pitas. Changes I made were done to accommodate the two of us. I used 1 lb. of ground Kobe beef, 1 can of Hunt's tomato sauce, and kept the spices at the full recipe amount as we like strong flavors. I also made the meatballs smaller in diameter so 4 fit nicely in the pitas. In addition to the feta, I served with shredded lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and Greek yogurt. Very nice, Hunt's!
