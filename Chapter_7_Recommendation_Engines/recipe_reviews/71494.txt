GREAT!  I've cooked these for friends and family.  When people see what I'm preparing, they generally give me an odd look, but love them when they are served.
But, hey...whay stop at a triple bypass?  I sprinkle lightly crushed pork rinds on top for the full coronary!

I really enjoyed this recipes. It is certainly an artery clogger. I didn't grill these because it is too cold to grill them outside this time of year. So I cooked them up in a skillet on the stove. They turned out great! Also make sure to use regular cut bacon not the thick cut because the burger meat will cook up faster then the thick cut bacon. I made that mistake the first time I made them.

These were so good but hard to get your mouth around. The second time we made them we split the hot dogs in half length-wise and used half for each one. We pre cooked the bacon and laid a strip on each hot dog half and covered that with the meat. We also used regular hot dog buns. It was much easier to take a bite of the second ones.

I made these a little differently than the recipe, because of the reviews that stated the beef was bland.  I used my normal hamburger recipe for the grill which is ground chuck, Worcestershire sauce, minced onion, garlic powder, onion powder, sea salt, fresh cracked pepper and a soft stick of butter combined into the mix.  I used Nathan's hot dogs, as they're my favorite and compared to the pic, mine turned out quite a bit thicker than the ones pictured.  They do take a considerable amount of time to grill.  Considering the thickness, I soaked and used wooden skewers cut into thirds, instead of toothpicks.  I would recommend bbqing them on low and the lid closed but keeping a close eye on them as the flames flare up quickly!  These took me about 30 mins to grill, on low.  They were pretty good, the men of the house loved them.  Thanks! :)

Awesome recipe!! Can't eat it everyday, but for something unique for a BBQ, this is it!  I fried mine in a skillet because our grill is not working.  Then I rolled them in the BBQ sauce and place on a wire rack in a broiler pan to bake up nice and crispy.  My family wanted more, but, of course, couldn't eat it.  Very filling.

These things went FAST. I have to say, I think a women made this recipe to keep her man!! My hubby and family totally loved these things. I left out the red pepper flakes, due to one person's allergies. But they were very very tasty. I did used John Morrell's Smoked Sausage style hot dogs. I could see making these again and again. My son has requested I do so. ;-) Thanks

I'm giving it a four -- good but not outstanding. I have to admit the men seemed to like them much better. Unique,  I will possibly make again .

Made these last night - and my boyfriend ate 5 and wanted more!!!! I figured it was already not the healthiest dinner I made, so I kicked it up a notch. I sliced the hot dogs in half, placed 2-3 slices of cheddar cheese on one half, put the other half on top, and then wrapped in the hamburger mixture (which I added shredded cheddar and diced jalapenos to). And when they were finished, after rolling them in the barbeque sauce, I brought them inside and put them under the broiler - 2 minutes, and then rolled them over for another 2 minutes. They were AMAZING - I barely finished my first, it was so filling, and putting them under the broiler helped the lack of crispiness people noted for their bacon. I will definitely be making these again at our next gathering...thanks!

I know why they are called triple bypasses!  While these burgers were good and definitely something to talk about, I didn't find them to be a must have.  Unless my son request this I don't think I'll be doing this one again.

These are really great - something different for the grill!  Recommend adding more seasoning to the ground beef - I use about a tablespoon of Cajun seasoning that I make myself (2-1/2 T paprika, 2 T garlic powder, 1 T salt, 1 T black pepper, 1 T onion powder, 1 T cayenne pepper, 1 T oregano, 1 T thyme).  Also cut the bacon in half lengthwise, and use two half-slices of bacon to wrap rather than two whole pieces.  Really a fun recipe!

We have made these many times and they are always a hit. Use good BBQ sauce. The flavors just go so well and the novelty makes it great for parties.

Excellent!!  Made these as a joke for our 4th of July BBQ.  We didn't think people would eat them.  Boy were we wrong!  We tried using regular hot dog buns but they didn't really hold up.

THIS WASNT GREAT BUT IT WAS A GREAT IDEA! THE ONLY THING I DID DIFFERENT WAS USE DOC JACKS GRILLIN SOSS.  DOC JACKS USES NO TOMATO PRODUCTS WHICH IS WHAT CAUSES THAT BURNT  OUTSIDE WHEN GRILLING WITH SAUCES.

I was a little disappointed in these.  It seemed like they took a very long time to cook through.  The taste was a little bland even with the red pepper flakes. If I try these again I will definitely do some serious "tweaking".  All in all not bad but not great.

I'm having an end of baseball season party for 12 fourteen year old boys.  I've been searching for something different & fun.  I think I just struck gold!!!  Have I tried this yet? NO... but come on, hamburgers + hotdogs + bacon + BBQ grill - mix well with cooler full of sodas & several bags of chips - sprinkle generously with some Rocky Mountain sunshine = 5 STAR recipe. No I don't feed this kinda stuff to my kids everyday.  No it won't be bland cuz they'll smother them with lots of ketchup and mustard.  So... HOLSINAR, do ya got any great ideas for dessert?

These were total boy food and the boys in my life loved them. I had one and struggled to finish it but they wolfed them down. I did have to add a bit of bread crumb to my meat since it seemed a bit loose but otherwise will be making again, whether I want to or not. I cooked mine on my George foreman grill and then dipped in BBQ sauce and put under the broiler for about 5 minutes, flipping once half way through that and they were cooked perfectly and the sauce sort of stuck and caramelized on them.

I liked the idea of the recipe, but the taste was just okay. I had to do this indoors, but used a grill pan. It was getting a little late so I skipped the onion (I definitely wouldn't if I made this again) and switched out the seasonings for 1 TBsp. of my own version of a homemade meat seasoning. We opted not to use the BBQ sauce, but to top it however we like. The bacon never got crispy, though it was fully cooked when the ground beef portion was done. This was quite bland, despite topping it with cheese and our faves. A bit of work for something with little taste besides plain cooked meat. I'm not sure if I'll make it again, but it was interesting to try.

This dish was awesome!  At first one would be like eeewww by looks but until you try it it changes your mind the BBQ sauce adds to it and by adding all your favorites makes it even better very filling too Great dish loved it!!!! It is a good decision all rolled into one when you can't decide which one to have 1st this way you can eat em both at the same time.....

I sauted finely chopped onion and added it to the ground beef with salt and pepper. I put them in the oven instead of grilling.  And instead of dipping the dogs in the bbq sauce, I started basting it on just before they were finished to get it all caramelized and yummy. My husband and sons loved them.

Used only 1 lb ground beef for 3 hotdogs. Meat was a bit hard to keep together at first so I refrigerated to allow it to set. Next time, I will omit the red pepper flakes (too much for me) and use other seasonings.
