I used vanilla yoghurt instead of plain yoghurt and I skipped the milk.  I also used a teaspoon of cinnamon instead of cardamom and it was perfect. Very tasty and full of nutrients.

This recipe is very good despite the fact that I did not have 2 cups of yogurt. I did not add cardamom though. However, my only recommendation would be to use very ripe champagne mangoes. They are the sweetest kind that you will find in the US in my experience. There are many varieties of mangoes and most of those that arrive in the US from Latin America are on the bitter/acid end of the spectrum. Therefore, they are not the best kind to use for this recipe as it will be almost impossible to get them as sweet as you would need to get a pulp made quality mango lassi. Ripen the mangoes outside the fridge for a few days until they start showing little black spots. Next time, I will add vanilla and see how it tastes,but as an overall this is a great recipe. I used also organic cane sugar!

I made this without added sugar, and I uses soy milk instead of regular milk. I used two of the red ("Tommy Atkins") mangos generally available in US grocery stores, and it was sweet enough. 

Add the cardamom if you have it! It really contributes to the flavor!

Substituted honey for the sugar & made with 1.5 cups Greek yogurt. Delicious. I had frozen mangos in the fridge from the summer, great treat!!

This drink was amazing, very delicious though I used normal yoghurt, next time definitely use whole milk yogurt, special taste! (Needs good quality mangos...)
