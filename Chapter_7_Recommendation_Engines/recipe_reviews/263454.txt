So good! I don’t normally like asparagus, but everything is better fried. I followed the recipe ingredients, but instead of chopping all that asparagus, I threw everything in a food processor and scooped it out with a 1/4 cup measuring cup into the pan. Next time I’ll not be lazy and I’ll prepare it with the chopped asparagus as I think the texture will be better. Flavors are fabulous and will be in regular rotation.

Great looking recipe that I will adapt to use up a mountain of zucchinis all ripening together!  [Anyone in Lethbridge AB want a free zucchini or two?]  I will post the results here.

Easy and tasty! But I used two ounces of old marble cheese, one ounce just didn't look like enough.

This was really good! I added some fried onions, a dash of Adobe and a few tablespoons of chopped parsley. I also had to sub parmigiano reggiano to the Romano cheese. Will be making this often!

Very good and easy to make. Always struggle to find something good and different for my vegetarian son and his girlfriend. This was perfect! Added baby portobello mushrooms too.

Best asparagus I’ve ever eaten. Surprised there aren’t more reviews!  Cooked as written (maybe I used a little more cayenne pepper for added punch). Can’t wait to cook again!

Tasted really good! Fell apart a little, which was probably my fault. Even husband and son ate them!
