Folks, you should really review the base recipe, not the recipe after you've made lots of tasty modifications to it.   ;-)  The base recipe is very bland, but it's perfect to get started with - adding fresh garlic and ginger is a must.  I'd also recommend adding a splash or two of rice vinegar.

If you're looking for something to make similar to the Thai recipes this is not it.  It was incredibly bland.  After spending an hour in the kitchen making this, I was so disappointed when I sat down to eat it.  We eat a lot of Thai and Indian food and this doesn't come close to what I have had in a restaurant.  Don't bother!

My husband and I thought this was OK, but my picky "if it's not a hotdog I don't want it" kids complained. 

I added a can of sliced waterchestnuts and sliced bamboo shoots. Next time I'll also add celery and other veggies I have on hand.

Sorry, but this is way too bland.  Not a "keeper" at all.

It came out very tasty--although I added cashews and bean sprouts and didn't end up putting the tofu or the mushrooms. Also I fried some fresh ginger and garlic in the oil before adding everything else, it gave it a more strong flavor. Cooking the rice in the pineapple juice is a great idea!

My favorite recipe on this site!!  Even the non vegetarians in my house love this dish aswell.  I leave out the eggs and add bean sprouts and water chestnuts.  I also added garlic and ginger to the sesame seed oil for the tofu to fry in.

We thought this had no flavor at all. This recipe needs a LOT more of everything besides rice and pineapple.

I liked this recipe but made one slight modification.  I added a little curry powder and I think it really helped make the recipe a little more exciting.

This was great! I did make some modifications. I took the advice of others and sauteed garlic, green onions, and ginger first. I also added a bit of hoisin sauce when sauteeing the tofu. After I threw in the rice, I generously sprinkled curry powder. I also used water chestnuts for texture since I didn't have carrots on hand. I've never had pineapple fried rice with mushrooms, so maybe it's just my preference so I left those out and used red peppers. 

I cooked the rice in a rice cooker and I believe the sugar in the juice burned (not a lot, I just didn't use the rice that was burned). I've never had luck making rice in anything but a rice cooker. Is there a way to do it without burning the rice in the pot?

This is a great recipe, for those who feel it's bland try some fresh garlic, ginger, pepper or sriracha sauce....why not add or substitute some shrimp, chicken...maybe some chicken that you fry in shredded coconut, some .

I cooked the rice in the rice cooker with the juice and it turned out quite sweet. I've added additional crushed cashew nuts, parsley as toppings. Will try it with normal rice and fresh pineapple next time.

We added ginger and garlic which helped a lot. We also used a lot more soy sauce.  It was still pretty bland.  It's a recipe worth tinkering with though.  I'd used pineapple chunks instead of crushed, throw in some water chestnuts for more texture (otherwise it's pretty mushy), and marinade the tofu.  It could work with a sweet & sour sauce.

I thought this was really good.  I added garlic and ginger as some other reviewers suggested and the flavor wasn't bland at all.  I also added baby corn and I used whole grain rice instead of white, which I thought went really well.

Better than I expected given the reviews, though I'd like the rice to be a little drier -- just a little mushy.

Not what I had in mind when I think of pineapple fried rice, the way they make it in Thailand.  Something, actually a lot of things, is missing.

This recipe is great! For a low cholesterol change, just use egg beaters instead of eggs! 
I find that if you are using frozen vegetables, draining some water out of the wok/pan helps to keep the dish from getting too soggy or watery. 
Also, if you enjoy the taste of grilled pinapple, just cook it at very high heat to get that "off the grill" taste without the time!

Really good with just a couple of adjustments.  I added some fresh ginger, a bit more soy sauce, and some sambal oelek(but any chili pepper would be good).  Also, I think it could use a little more egg.  Definitely making it again.

I loved this recipe, although I made a minor change. I used a bag of frozen veggies (an asian medley) instead of tofu, carrots and mushrooms. The medley had broccoli, carrots, baby corn, and snap peas. It was delicious! My boyfriend ate two plates full.

It turned out very dry, not as sweet as I expected. Didn't go over very well with me or my roommate. I had tons of leftovers that went bad. I would try it again if I added tons more juice. It just didn't have the flavor I expected.

I reduced the servings to 4. I only used half a cup of rice, the pinneaple juice and enough water to make 1 1/3 cup to cook the rice. I used tamari instead of soy sauce, and added a garlic clove to the vegetables. It was very good!

I followed the recipe exactly except for doubling everything for the servings I knew I needed.  It was good but I felt like it was missing something...more soy sauce perhaps?  I an going to try again with ponzu sauce as someone suggested.  Overall, though, really great easy meal that everybody liked!! Thanks for posting!

I agree that more seasoning is needed from what is written.  I added more soy sauce and deeply browned firm tofu (after pressing out its water) in the wok. I cooked the tofu by itself to achieve the nice brown. I also added much more sesame oil.  I think the amount of pineapple is perfect.  Keep in mind it is the SMALL can of CRUSHED pineapple.  Pineapple tidbits wouldn't work here.
