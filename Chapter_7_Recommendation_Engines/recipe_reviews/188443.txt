I love this recipe!  I've been making it for years with saltines as well.  I don't know if it's a computer glitch, but the proportions are off a bit.  The amount of butter, brown sugar, chocolate and nuts are enough for ONE pan - not two.   I used 6 crackers on one pan and had another pan ready just in case.  The thick caramel was just the right amount for the one pan - it would not have stretch ed to cover both.  Ditto on the chocolate and nuts.  So if you want to make two pans, you need 12 crackers, 2 cups of butter, 2 cups of brown sugar, 4 cups chocolate chips and 2 cups chopped nuts!  Hope this helps!

I've made this every year for the past 20 years;it is my most requested recipe from friends and family. Instead of walnuts, I use 1C chopped pecans and 1C slivered almonds. Melt margarine (to be pareve) or butter (dairy) w/1C brown sugar, pecans & almonds, bring to a boil, then let simmer for 2 minutes. Pour over large matzah boards placed on a greased rimmed cookie sheet (break to fit - leave no holes). Bake @ 350 for 7 - 10 minutes (middle rack). Remove from oven & sprinkle w/semi-sweet chocolate chips; spread chocolate. Allow several hours for chocolate to harden. Delicious!

I am familiar with this recipe and have made it every Passover for the last several years.  It is delicious by itself or served with vanilla ice cream.

Good recipe, but only use the TOP RACK of the oven to prepare, as it will burn on the bottom rack!

This is so addictive. I made two batches, one with chocolate top and no nuts, the other with nuts and no chocolate. I have also made it with graham crackers and another recipe I saw used saltine crackers. I did use the mini chips, which eliminated the necessity of putting it back in the oven. By the time I sprinkled the chips all over the top, they melted and spread without trouble. Make sure you put foil or parchment on your cookie sheet!

Sooooo good! I halved the recipe but next time I might as well double it. I lined the tray with parchment paper instead of foil and there was absolutely no sticking at all. I also added a pinch of salt, which gave a nice oomph to the toffee.

Don't subsitute the butter for anything else :(  I made this with light butter and the caramel never set up.  Didn't stop me from eating some before I threw it out. Shame on me for trying to save a few calories! I'll be making this again with regular butter, I'm looking forward to a second attempt.  I made this in a bakery I worked in years ago and it was delicious. *Edit, I made this again with butter and it made all the difference. It came out perfect. I laso let it cool for a few hours. Perfection!

I have been making this recipe for years.  Found it in the Los Angeles Times.  I always have to make a triple batch to have extra on hand for everyone to take home from Passover.  It is fun to add other toppings besides chopped nuts.  Try white or dark chocolate instead of semi sweet chocolate  Excellent!!!!

Word of caution...don't let yourself get distracted like I did while cooking the butter and brown sugar.  If the toffee gets too hot it will bubble up and almost become foamy.  The sugar crystallizes and thickens which makes the pouring/spreading process onto the matzo very difficult.  My first batch wasn't ruined per say because I'm sure the flavor is still good.  But my second batch (which I watched and stirred constantly) came together with ease and will probably have better texture.  Sad part is I knew better but oh well!  I'm still very excited to try it!  Thank you!

I made this for Passover and WOW, was it ever a hit.  I made 1/2 w/o nuts for those that don't like or are allergic to them.  Both 1/2's went very fast, but he nuts were the best. I used Pecans, I like the taste better.  I also used mini choc. chips and didn't have to put the trays back in the oven.  They melted very quickly.  I kept the 2nd tray in the oven while I worked the chips onto the first tray.

I've been making this recipe for years, just as many others have. It is always requested, we call it chocolate matzo bark. Whatever you call it, make it, it is yummy.

This a wonderful chocolate brittle to end a seder meal.  I make it every year and it is one of the most popular desserts that I put out.  It wouldn't be Passover without them.  What a treat!

This flew off the plates at my boyfriend's family Passover Seder. We didn't have nuts on ours and it wasn't exactly crunchy, but we couldn't keep our hands off before OR after dinner!  Keep them in the fridge (freezer even better) to prevent them from getting soggy and melted.

I submitted this recipe in 2009 and was shocked, surprised and so thrilled that All Recipes picked my Matzo Candy to be featured in their first magazine publication, April/May 2014!  This candy really is delicious, and makes a great "food" gift.  Thank you All Recipes, I'm almost famous ;)

I couldn't wait to make this recipe and was concerned that I wouldn't be able to stop eating it.  It was so easy to make and 6 sheets of matzah makes quite a lot.  It was actually too sweet for my personal taste, but the recipe is a winner.  It was very well received and went a long way.  I made it without nuts because of my son's allergy.

Yummy!  I made this for our seder and everyone loved it.  I even gave some to my husband's employee and wife who apparently ate the whole bag very quickly.  It did stick some using the foil but not a huge deal. Easy cleanup.  I sprinkled mine with pecan chips and they were definitely a hit.

I've been making this for years- Found the recipe in a magazine.  But the crackers should be 6, not 12.  You won't have enough caramel and chocolate for 12 crackers if you use these amounts.  And it's okay to overlap the crackers a bit, as well!  I've found parchment paper works better than foil for the base.  If you do use foil, greasing it helps with removal.
 Other toppings I've used are toasted sesame seeds, crushed candy canes, sweetened flaked coconut, and crushed Butterfinger candy bar.
Oh, and those crumbles left on the cutting board?  They make fabulous ice-cream topping!

This was HUGE hit at Pesach/Seder!!   I have to make  it again today for my 20 year old grandson, because he made a special trip to "visit" me so he could eat the rest of the first batch, and then asked for more! (Whatever it takes to get him to visit, am I right?)

Super easy to make.  Tried 2 types of Matzo cracker, preferred one “not for Passover”.  The higher  quality of walnuts the better. Will make again.

This turned out well, but only after I realized that the quantities of butter are brown sugar were wrong. Using 11 sheets of matzoh, I needed 2 sticks (1 cup) of butter and 2 cups (not 1) of brown sugar.

I made this for the first time and everyone loved it!  I brought it to the second Seder and everyone wanted the details on how I made it.  It came out perfectly the first time.  It was so easy!  I followed the recipe here except that I added more chocolate chips so I  was sure to cover everything completely.  It was perfect - crunchy and with the combination of the caramel and chocolate it was so yummy.  I omitted the nuts due to my hostess's allergy but I will make it with nuts when I can.

Loved this for Passover (well actually any time b/c it was good). I found that there was not enough toffee to really cover the matzoh. I made this again for the second night and doubled the toffee-much better ratio-but then I really love the toffee the most!

I have made this several times and everyone I offered them to loved them. The only difference is I tried a few batches with pistachios. Last week I was having them and tea  with my friend and her grandchild started arguing over the last Samoa. I thought to myself if I used toasted coconut with this recipe it would be very similar. Well, today I tried it, and when I brought a tray of them to them, ages 3, 5, and 8 they all loved them. I am glad I saved a tray for my husband and me.

I just made these and they are my new favorite. They are so easy to make and they don't cost an arm and a leg to make. I like to send tins of cookies and candy on holidays and this recipe is going to be included in my next batch.

This recipe is simple, yet always a hit. A few notes:
I have standard half sheet size baking pans and only needed 6 matzohs to cover both of them completely. I'm not sure why the recipe calls for 12. I lined the sheets with non-stick foil and lift off was a breeze. I feared the chips would hold their shape too well in the oven and be difficult to spread, so I microwaved them and added about a half tablespoon of oil to make it even easier to spread. I could have used less than the full 12 ounce bag as I felt the chocolate was a bit too thick in spots and overwhelmed the caramel. I added a touch of sea salt on top of the chocolate, then topped some with chopped roasted peanuts and some with colored sprinkles. This is a super easy and always popular hostess gift to bring to a Seder.
