I must have missed something - I thought this sauce was relatively nondescript, but Hubs disagreed – he really liked it, he said.  (Therefore, he requested I didn’t  add the chili sauce I wanted to give it some life!)  It’s kind of unusual in our house that he rates a recipe higher than I do.  Still, I can’t bring myself to rate this more than 3-stars, average in my book.

I think this is superior to the standard cocktail sauce.  I always add a little more lemon juice, and one clove of garlic, minced.
