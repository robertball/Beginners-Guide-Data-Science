Spectacular!! Made it as written. Could not stop eating it!! Everyone in the family including 2 teens loved it. Did not change a thing other than I did not have quite enough mayo so subbed a bit of horseradish mayo. Will be making often.

You won't miss the traditional potato salad with this recipe, is very tasty. The edamame adds a nice touch  and works perfectly well with the rest of the ingredients. I added some paprika while mixing the  dressing and as a garnish just because I like some heat in my food.

We loved this! What a great idea for a salad. It has all the traditional flavors we were used to and so light and refreshing. I omitted the radishes(can't stand those little buggers), other than that, the recipe was solid and needed no tweaking. This is going to be made many many times. Thank you for posting!

I followed the recipe, except I didn't cook the cauliflower or the edamame.   Turned out crunchy and delish.  It will be great for lunches and tomorrow night's dinner.

Disappointed after reading the other reviews. Found it very bland, even though it had several hours for the flavours to meld. So many better things

Loved this recipe and I will make it again. I did omit the yogurt and used light mayo instead. Other than that it was fantastic. Now I have a new appreciation for Edamame, I like the shelled version.

I made this salad for a Super Bowl party and it was a great hit.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  I made it just as this recipe called for.  Delicious

This is a great recipe! I did change a few things due to family preference. I omitted the radishes, opted for snap peas-uncooked, pods and all (chopped)instead of the soybeans, and left out the olive oil. I felt it was sauced enough. To keep it lighter I used low fat mayo. It was absolutely delish! Thanks so much for such a great dish

The only changes I made were to add poppy seed, an ditch the mayo completely , add a bit of lime juice to replace the mayo 'kick.'
