Excellent recipe!  It was a big hit with my family.  I did tweak it a littl though, I added half of a sweet onion, minced, some chopped mushrooms, and some garlic powder to the spread.  Then when it was done I brushed the top with margerine and sprinkled on some parmessan cheeze.  As my fiancee said, "It tastes like more!"

The PTA Mom for my daughter's class introduced this to us as "Sausage Squares" and now I make it for every breakfast event at the office and it is everyone's favorite!   I even put it all together the night before and then bake the next morning while getting ready for work and I think it turns out even better.  Also, try it with the spicy pork sausage and the butter flavored crescent rolls for a little more 'umph' even!  The best!

This was a good base recipe, but with just the sausage and cream cheese, kinda bland, so here is what I did.    I sauted red onion and garlic in olive oil before adding to sausage. I added 1/4 lb. of ground beef to the sausage mixture.  To the meat/cream cheese (I also used whipped cream cheese w/chives) I added about a half of pkg. of frozen spinach, thawed and squeezed free of water. 1 can of rotel tomatoes, Italian seasoning, salt, garlic pepper, celery seed. Also added a handful of shredded coby/jack cheese. Mix well and add to pre-baked crescent pan. After adding the mix to the pan, I topped with more co/jack cheese, and covered with the remaining dough.  Before baking in oven for about 20-30 minutes, I spread the dough with butter and added a sprinkling of parmesan cheese.  Turned out great...

Update 2-28-2017 I made 2 of these for Bible Study this morning and decided to up the oven temp to 375 degrees, which is what is suggested on the can of crescent sheets. I let the bottom crust cook for 8 minutes. Then I filled it and topped with the second sheet and let it cook for 15 minutes.  Definitely better using the higher temperature.  Also, much better using hot sausage.      3-8-2012 Easy and very filling. I cooked the bottom crust for at least 10 minutes, and I ended up adding a lot of time to the second cooking as well. I wonder if the oven temp should be raised to at least 375 degrees.

This recipe was actually really good. Note if the cresent roles are not done all the way set your oven to broil for 3 minutes and the roles will be done. It was good and very filling.

I made this with a friend and her family many years ago and I loved it so much. Hot  or cold. Though it is still good with normal sausage I really like to make it with spicy. Depending on the pan of course you may have to cook it longer than said.

Tastes like biscuits and gravy without the hard work.  I used spicy Jimmy Dean sausage and whipped garlic herb cream cheese along with the garlic cresecent rolls (we love garlic in our family). YUM!

Great!  I had a tub  whipped cream cheese, so I used it without any problems.  I did add a layer of shredded cheese & some chives before adding the top layer of crescent rolls.  Loved it!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

My mom made this for me last time I got to visit her.  So simple, I made it for mu husband when I got home.  I only used 1 can of crescent rolls and baked it in a 8x8 pan.  For the 9x13 size when baking for a larger family I use 2lbs sausage and 16oz of cream cheese.  Then 2 cans of crescent rolls, for more filling.  This is a recipe you can play with.  This time I am going to add some hashbrowns and maybe eggs to the mix too.

I make this for Christmas morning every year!  I make them in the evening on Christmas eve and then pop them in the oven in the morning. Instead of crescent rolls I  use the refrigerator biscuits and flatten them out and put the mixture in the middle.  Seal the ends and bake.  In my house we call these  "Breakfast balls" and they are so easy to have a good breakfast while still being able to check out all the cool stuff that Santa brought.

I just made this. So good. I sautéed onions , bell peppers, jalapeños in some butter before adding sausage and only used 3/4 block cream cheese. Probably could have used the whole. Baked crust for 5 minutes and topped with some cheddar/Monterrey Jack, top with sausage mixture and 8 beaten eggs. Bake for about 15-20 minutes.

I added a 4 oz. can of diced green chiles, garlic powder, and sprinkled some cheddar cheese on top.  Very flavorful!  I agree, the bread could've cooked a bit longer...

It was quick and simple.  I made a side dish of stir fryed asparagus.  I also had a plate of fresh fruit, nuts, cheese and olives.  It was cool to have a bite of olive, or a bit of fruit to nibble with the cassarole.

YUMMY! I made this for my hubby to take to work and all of his co-workers definitely loved this recipe! I made enough for our family too, and I will absolutely be making this again. I made one change. Instead of baking this like a casserole, I made each crescent role separetly and just rolled it up with the spead inside. They looked nice and tasted even better! MUST TRY!

This recipe is soooo good. I make it for every occassion and everyone always talks about how good it is and wants the recipe. I do have to bake the bottom layer of cresent rolls longer than 5 min (usually about 8 min or until golden). And I also have to bake the final product longer than what it says.

I made this using low fat croissants, turkey breakfast sausage, and light cream cheese.  It was just as flavorful and better for you! I added hot sauce to the cream cheese and sausage mixture.  You can also add a can of drained rotel tomatoes for extra flavor... it is delicious and everyone loves it!!

I made this for Easter for the family using Jimmy Dean country sausage and adding just a bit of garlic powder like other reviewers had recommended.  Everyone enjoyed the flavor, but I found that there was not enough of the meat mixture when I was putting the dish together.  I barely had enough to spread over the whole layer of crescent rolls.  Also, I did have to cook the dish longer to get the crescent roll top to cook completely.  I would try this again, but I would make more of the sausage mixture for the center.

Three simple ingredients to make this breakfast dish. A teacher at our school made this for "payday breakfast" and it is delicious. I baked mine in a small cookie sheet and it came out perfect. When I make this again, I'm going to add sautéed onion and green peppers. But as is, this recipe is delicious and my family really enjoyed it.

Delicious and easy! I just stuffed the cream cheese/sausage mixture into the individual crescent rolls and baked accordingly. A huge hit at Easter Brunch!

This is always a big hit! I do change the recipe a bit. I double the sausage and cream cheese and add a can of rotel to the mixture. Super yummy!!

So simple, and so popular!   I bake the bottom layer for a few minutes before adding the filling.  After the sausage is cooked, I drain it and add the cream cheese to the warm pan to help it melt a little better.  Once the top layer of dough is added, it usually takes almost 20 minutes to bake to my satisfaction.   Really there is no way to do this wrong. My husband now has me make this on the weekends so he can heat it up for breakfast during the week.  Good stuff!!

To add flavor, I used spicy sausage and didn't drain. Increased cream cheese to 3 packages, added ground sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper. I also used biscuits on top vs. crescent rolls. *I have found it's very important to use Pillsbury rather than store brand, otherwise you have to buy twice as many tubes to get the same result.

Good recipe! Though, I think I am going to add some of my own creation too it. I was thinking spice and also some spinach and eggs. :) 

Really simple for a breakfast. 
Thank you to the creator! Thumbs up!

We have been making this in my family for a few years!!  My family likes it better with 4 ounces of cream cheese.  We also add a cup of cheddar cheese before adding the last can of cresent rolls on top.  Sometimes I don't add cream cheese at all and add extra cheddar cheese.  We like it both ways.  Would definately reccommend!!

Definitely a great meal no matter what time of day! I only used a can of crescent rolls and placed it in an 8 x 8 dish.  I also made a layer of shredded cheese before putting the top layer of rolls on there.  Very tasty!

The timing was way off for me - had to cook it more than twice as long as the instructions state and since I didn't know in the beginning how far off the timing was I think the bottom layer could have used another 5 minutes before I added toppings too (a little bit doughy in the center still). Other than that, though, it was quite good. I can imagine a lot of ways to kick it up if you want to add further depth of flavor or sneak veggies in or something (maybe extra breakfast meats or some onions and/or bell peppers, or top it with some cheddar or parmesan). Just plain and simple, exactly as stated, is fine though. I'll keep the base recipe and make it again sometimes as well as try some new variations too.

Not sure if this modification was mentioned earlier, I didn’t read all of the reviews. But this is amazing with one can of drained Rotel.  It gives it just enough zest and interest!

As others had mentioned, this is a great base recipe.  I prefer more seasonings and flavor so I made some adjustments based on users comments.

I baked the bottom dough for 8 minutes first
After that I baked 5 hashbrown patties that I added on top of the meat.  Strongly recommend the hashbrown patties.
Before I cooked the meat I warmed up some onion, green onion, red bell pepper.   I added some garlic later when the meat was almost done.
I also bought some hot ground sausage.  Next time I think I will get some Jimmy Dean hot sausage.
I seasoned the meat with pepper, crushed red pepper flakes, a little garlic powder and a small amount of salt.
Next time I will only use 1/2 to 2/3 of the cream cheese, I personally thought using the whole 8oz block was too much.
I also baked the casserole for about 16 minutes.

This was really good.  Very rich and filling. I didn't need to eat until much later in the evening.  I cut the leftovers into squares, wrapped them individually and put some in the freezer and a couple in the refrigerator.  I look forward to making this again.   Give it a try, it's a treat.

I am curious about adding eggs into the mix but what I made was so dense and filling I don't think I will really need to toss some eggs into it.

Easy and tastes great. Easier for a crowd than the rolled up crescent rolls that I’ve made several times. I will say, though, that it takes a good bit longer to bake each layer than in this recipe. I always make at least 2 at a time, so it usually takes at least 10 min to bake the bottom layer and 15- 20 min for the top layer. Still a good recipe, just need to allow for more time.

Very yummy and an easy weeknight meal to make.  After reading some reviews, I added some diced onion & garlic powder to the ground sausage, and then stirred in some fresh baby spinach.  I also cooked at 375 for 8, then 15 minutes.  Made it with a side of hashbrowns and fruit salad.  My husband and teenage son ate it up.

I did make a few minor changes. Based upon another reviewers suggestion, I cooked this at 375 degrees. I also cooked the first layer of crescent dough for 8 minutes and the second bake for 15 minutes.  It came out perfect and my whole family loved it, even the kids who can be picky at times. I will make this again occasionally.

This is good but I did have trouble getting the top layer of crescent rolls to cook all the way through.  Turned up temp to 375 and cooked way longer than 10 min. Ended up turning on broiler for a few minutes.  I added fresh minced garlic, ground pepper and red pepper flakes while cooking the sausage. I added some Parmesan cheese while mixing the cream cheese and sausage together.  And I put a layer of shredded cheddar cheese before and after the second crescent roll layer.  My husband ate his topped with salsa.  I think adding mushrooms or a can of green chilies like others suggested would be good too.  This is a basic recipe that you have to alter according to what you like.

I've made this SOOOO many times!   We used to just make it for a Christmas breakfast,  but then I decided to actually make for supper!   So good,  so easy,  so fast,  just perfect every time!   You cannot mess this up!   Oh, and for the cheese lovers,  just add either sharp cheddar or mozzarella on top!

I make this recipe several times a year.  The only change I make is I add a bag (2 cup size) of shredded cheddar cheese on top of the sausage before adding the top layer of crescent rolls.

Took another reviewers advice and baked it at 375. I baked the bottom for 5 minutes and the top for about 14.  I used a 9x13 dish.  Very easy and very good. I'll definitely be making again.

The cream cheese was definitely too bitter and it took over the taste completely. Overwhelmed the tastebuds until you couldnt even enjoy the crescent rolls or the sausage. I've had great sausage casserole before though so I'm planning to make this again but I will substitute the sausage for ground beef, and the cream cheese I will probably use shredded mozzarella or something that melts really well.

This turned out really good. The recipe was first introduced to me by a coworker. I followed the instructions exact except I put the oven on 375 which cooked the crescent rolls perfect. I used Jimmy Deans spicy sausage and buttery pillsbury crescent rolls.

I made this recipe as written with the exception of adding some cheddar cheese with the sausage and cream cheese mixture. I found that I needed to bake mine much longer than 8 minutes. It took 16 minutes for the top layer to not be doughy.

I make this for Christmas morning every year!!! I do the sweetened version by adding a little powdered sugar and vanilla to the cream cheese & we use maple sausage. It makes a delicious casserole/Danish perfect for all day snacking!

This is very simple and yummy, however I have taken off a star because I had to bake it probably an extra 20 minutes longer than the directions say, and then I had to broil it a couple of minutes as well.

This is a good base recipe, but definitely needed some tweaking. I followed this recipe exactly the first time I made it and found it to be a bit bland and there didn't seem to be enough sausage mixture. The next time I used 2 lbs of my family's homemade sausage, 2 packages of cream cheese, a package of simply potatoes o'brien hashbrowns, and 2 diced jalapeños. I also had to extend the cooking time for the crescent rolls to brown. It turned out great and my whole family now loves it.

I don't care for eggs, so this was a great alternative for me.  I will make this again, but when I do, I think I will cook the bottom layer a bit more as it tended to be doughy.   I also had to cook the top layer longer than the recipe called for to get it to brown, but that's no biggie.  As others have suggested, this recipe would be easy to add your choice of just about anything, so I think mushrooms and onions are on the horizon for the next time.

Very simple but DELICIOUS! I didn't make any changes to the recipe because I was looking for something quick & easy. This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. My family LOVED this. This is a great basic recipe, and I can see myself experimenting with it in the future.

I made it as appetizers. I cut them into bite size squares after spreading first package of rolls on baking pan, then mixture leaving 1/2 inch border, second package of rolls, then sealed edges.  I baked it in 1 step.  I used Jimmy Dean sausage roll.

Very tasty as is but nice recipe to add your favorite breakfast mix-ins. I have tried sprinkling shredded cheddar cheese over the sausage mixture and it is very good with another depth of flavor! Great for taking to gatherings, and SOOO quick and easy.

So good, I did follow suggestions from another post and I cooked the onions with the sausage, melted butter and put garlic powder in it to paint across the top. I found it took a bit longer to bake to get the rolls done but was really good very rich but a small amount is very satisfying

This is a very easy and yummy recipe! I let the bottom layer of croissant cook for 7 minutes to get the dough more done. I also like to add some shredded cheddar cheese on top of the sausage and cream cheese mixture before putting the top layer of croissant on.

Just made this recipe for the first time.  Improvised a little by adding one egg and and a little grated cheddar cheese.  Increased the cooking time by a couple minutes.  It will become one of my favorite breakfast dishes.

We were first introduced to these by a PTA mother. The faculty were absolutely crazy for them. I made them for my family and they have become a real go to breakfast! This is always a big hit whenever it is served. Our favorite is to use the maple flavored sausage when preparing it.

A great go-to last minute alternative to pizza - I sauteed onion with the sausage and used mozzarella instead of cream cheese.  I topped the upper crust with an egg wash prior to baking, cut the finished bread into triangles, and served with marinara sauce for dipping.  Add a salad and it's brunch!

My boss made it for us at work and I wondered where she found it from! I guess it's from AllRecipes (my favorite recipe website too). Easy and quick. Definitely will make it again with more filling ingredients like onions, peppers, and maybe pepper jack cheese. Can be made so many ways if you're creative.

Added minced onion and mushrooms, also garlic powder. Next time add scrambled egg and layer of cheese on top of spread before finishing the baking process.

This is a yummy recipe! It is quick and super easy. I did not make it as a casserole though. I flattened the individual crescent rolls after separating them, and rolled the sausage and cream cheese mixture up inside, putting the mixture on the large end, tucking the corners and rolling to the point. I baked at 350 degrees in a convection oven for 12-14 minutes. YUM!

This was very quick and I did not change anything.  I see where you could add a few other things to change it up a little bit or make it more interesting.  I had these items on hand, served it with a salad, and we enjoyed it.  It is another recipe you can safely serve to a child wearing braces--big plus at this time in our lives! (I used hot/spicy sausage and it was great!)
