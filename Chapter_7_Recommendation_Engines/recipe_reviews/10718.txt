This was a GREAT recipe, and it tasted very good, and was easy to make.  My only warning would be that it's very sweet (VERY sweet), so if you've got an aversion to sugar, proceed with caution.

Wish I could give these a 10! Who ever invented these will go to Heaven as they are heavenly. Had to hide some from my guests for myself and then ended up making another batch. I made the whole recipe using my food processor. It was so easy. Yum, Yum.

My mom used to make these and we couldn't remember the name.  Well I typed coconut into allrecipes one day to find a dessert recipe and up it popped.  I was so happy.  I love pecan pie, but most of the time it's so daunting to make.  This is easy, and you can always use pecans in place of the walnuts.  And my crust turned out perfectly.  Just get in there with your hands and really mush it together.  Make sure to let them sit for awhile either at room temperature or in the fridge.  Miss impatient me had to grab a piece 30 minutes after they came out.  Tasted amazing, but was a little runny.  I put the rest in the fridge for two hours and they were fantastic.  Try this recipe!!!

I have made these several times now for large groups of people.  They are so easy, and so good.  I've nick-named them "poor man's pecan pie" because to me they taste a little like home-made pecan pie.  I can never make pie crusts, but this crust I can.  It's basically a lemon bar crust, with walnut filling.  I've also experimented with different toppings: whip cream, or a small drizzle of hot fudge or caramel are quite tasty too.

Not at all the Chinese Chews grandma made.  The bottom layer was very bland and the top too wet.  Picture looks like the correct version but instructions list two layers and it is NOT right.

I'm pretty much the baker at my office and usually make cupcakes for special occasions.  I finally tried something different. I looked this recipe up by the ingredients I had at home (flour, sugar, coconut) and added pecans instead of walnuts.  Everyone absolutely loved these and I've never had so many requests for a recipe.  Very good, thanks for sharing the recipe!

Yummy-I made these for a church potluck and everyone loved them. At least four people asked me for the recipe. They were so easy too! And they look pretty! I had several friends call me up and say, "Can you bring me one of those thingys that you had the other day? They were so delicious!" Come on now, every cook wants to hear that!

I would first like to say these  were the highlight of the night at my house! This was the best dessert I've had in a long time. My Momma told me when she was a little girl her neighbor would make these for her and her family  and they were favorite do much the lady next door would make these for her on her birthday. Since these were her childhood  favorites I had to make these for her. And boy I was glad I did make them. I love these so much they became my childhood favorite (I'm a teenager, by the way)! Oh My! This is what paradise and warm hugs taste like. Though my Chinese Chews were a different, it wasn't really a bar it didn't  hold well like the picture. Since that happen we scooped parts of it and plopped it on ice cream and it hit the spot perfectly. Cannot wait to make this delicious-ness again!

These are incredible!! I have made these several times and I always am asked for the recipe. What a delicious treat. Someone stated that they taste like a little pecan pie, and they do! I have never noticed the floury taste that others find in the crust. It is the same as a lemon bar crust, and is really delicious.

I'm not sure what I did wrong because the cookie crust came out really crumbly and kind of... gross. When eaten, it turns into this chalky mush and tastes faintly of flour. The walnut and coconut topping however was perfect, but I suggest using a traditional recipe for butter cookies for the bottom crust when you bake it. 

Oh, and also, I couldn't figure out what's so Chinese about these cookies. Any answers?

We loved this!  It's great as is, but the crust is primarily made from flour.  There is a slight hint of flour-y taste (my husband said they were perfect as is).  I might try some graham cracker crumbs next time or even chocolate wafer crumbs.  Delicious none the less!

AMAZING!  My friend suggested that I let the crust bake 30-35 mins instead of 15 because the crust was awful the first few times that I tried to make these. I made that one change and it made ALL the difference! ! These are absolutely amazing,  simply Devine! ! I hate coconut and walnuts but THESE are irresistible! !?????

Delicious! I substituted pecans for the walnuts because i like pecans more. I dont know what is Chinese about these but I did like them. the bottom is like a shortbread cookie but a little crumbly, the top was like a pecan pie with coconut. Some reviews say the bottom layer is boring but i found it perfect. if it were any sweeter, everyone would be complaining about that. the top is so sweet you need a more bland bottom. loved this ?

I only made half what the recipe originally calls for. I didn't want to start experimenting with a big batch. I'm glad I did that, because I didn't like the crust at all. It turned out crumbly and kind of half cooked. I could also detect the flour tatse easily. I liked the topping part,it was soft, not too much chewy though. I would definitely recommend a different crust to compliment the topping.
