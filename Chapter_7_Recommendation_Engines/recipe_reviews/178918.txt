A good recipe over all.  Maybe it's my oven, but 40 minutes is ENTIRELY too long.  They burn every time.  It seems like 25 minutes is about right.

Really good.  You don't need to go with the bother of peeling the potatoes tho, just  wash them like you would regular potatoes!

Easy, quick side dish.  I didn't have almonds so used pine nuts instead.  Threw them on top of sweet potatoes in last 3 minutes of roasting in oven.

I had heard that Sweet Potatoes are so much better for you than plain potatoes. I wanted to give them a try and used this recipe.  I made it almost as directed (maybe a little more garlic and chopped raw almonds).  These were a big hit! Light and delicious!  Will make again and again!

Delicious - the addition of thyme and garlic makes these potatoes a nice alternative to more sugary sweet potato recipes. My husband loved this, and he's normally not a fan of sweet potatoes. Will definitely make again.

good, I would recommend cutting the recipe in half, as I used three large sweet potatoes and it was hard to mix up.

Not bad - I used a tablespoon of dried thyme instead of fresh.

Definitely needs salt. Bland flavor overall. 40 minutes is plenty of cook time. I took mine out 5 minutes early and they were very brown, almost too done.

Quick and easy side dish.  Roasting brings out the sweet flavor with the additional of garlic it was definitely a keeper recipe - we will make again and again. Followed the recipe except that I cut it in half for the two of us.  Thanks for adding to Allrecipes.com.

Very good taste but I can't rate something 5 stars if the recipe steers you toward burning them! I agree max of 30 minutes, probably less, although maybe if the temperature wasn't 450 they wouldn't dry out and burn.

Made this for my first Thanksgiving and it turned out wonderfully.  In a post-dinner poll, this was almost unanimously voted the favorite dish.

Next time I'm going to add a bit more garlic and salt and we toasted our almonds, but we agree with other cooks that a baking time of 20-30 minutes is sufficient.  We love sweet potatoes!

After making this as directed, I used sliced sweet potatoes about 1/4'' thick sprinkled with pine nuts and roasted for about 20 minutes at 375 degrees.  Then just tossed them in a serving bowl.
