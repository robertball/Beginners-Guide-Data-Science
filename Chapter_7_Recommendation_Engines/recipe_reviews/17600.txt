This healthy soup was Great! You don't need all the vegies, just put in what you have(Didn't have mushrooms). You can also add cheese, sour cream, and bacon bits.

This is really good, although somewhat strange in texture and appearance.  I added extra water as I was pureeing because it was basically the consistency of mashed potatoes.  Once you get past that and the greenish-brown color, it's very hearty and satisfying.  Season to taste.

This a good, basic recipe to help you get rid of those odds and ends of vegetables.  It does lack in flavor so next time I would substitute 1/2 of the water for chicken broth.  I did have to add salt.  I also chose not to puree since I like my chunky veggies.

Good basic recipe, but it needs salt and pepper or it is way too bland.  I also added some chicken broth in addition to the water to give it more flavor.

A surprisingly good mix of vegetables! I added salt and pepper like others recommended.

I have to admit, I thought this was a rather odd mixture with the cucumber, but actually have most everything I was trying to use up. I don't even like cucumbers, but had them on hand so decided to try this recipe, and it isn't that bad. Not my fav, so I prob wont use it again unless needed, but I will finish eating it. It's slightly tangy and deffinately a fun taste (a light taste but filling meal); it's different, healty, and it will get me to use and eat the cucumber!

For as simple and easy as it is, my husband and I thought this soup was quite tasty.  And very healthy to boot!  We added one more cup of water and an extra bouillon cube and the texture was perfect.  Also added a dash of cayenne pepper.  Overall it was very good - thanks for the recipe!

This recipe did not work for me at all.  I had to add tons of seasoning and it still was not very good.  Will not make again.

This was very easy and very, very good.  I even left out the cucumber (I didn't have one).  I also found that if you add a very little bit of sour cream to  your bowl of soup it adds a wonderful creaminess to it.
