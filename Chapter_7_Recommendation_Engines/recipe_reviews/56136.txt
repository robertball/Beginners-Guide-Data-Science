I had a spare cucumber in the fridge and found this recipe, so I thought I would try. I only changed one thing. I used one whole tomato in place of the canned. I ate some as soon as I was done making, but tried it later after letting it sit in the fridge, and it was much better. Will make again.

This was marvelous. I used one huge English  cucumber, diced tomatoes with green pepper, celery and onions, diced red onion, no bell peppers, 2 ears fresh corn, cut from the cob, fresh cilantro, and lots more garlic. Next time I'm invited to a BBQ or something I am taking this!

This was nice and refreshing.  I used Rotel tomatoes and cut down on the pepper flakes but it was still pretty spicy.  I liked it that way but it was too spicy for my husband.  Next time I will use regular stewed tomatoes.  I also added a tablespoon or so of sugar to give a hint of sweetness and take away some of the tartness of the vinegar.

Very good salad.  I followed AMHONG's tweakings from below and firmly concur with her suggestion to use fresh cilantro.  Dried cilantro is awful and doesn't improve any dish it is put in.

This salad was absolutely wonderful! It was so flavorful and really refreshing! I don't know why one review was so bad or why they didn't like it. The flavors were really good and everyone who ate it loved it! The only changes I made were that I used two cucumbers, instead of one, half of each bell pepper, 2/3 of the corn, 1/2 TBS. of the red pepper flakes, and a dash of sugar. I also used fresh cilantro... dried wouldn't be the same. Anyway, this was a great side dish and is definately a keeper!

The only changes I made were to use fresh halved grape tomatoes, and fresh cilantro. It was way too spicy for me but Husband really liked it. He said it was tasty and refreshing!

This was delicious! 
I made a few changes after reading reviews.
I 1 cup of cherry tomatoes and added a little water and another tbsp of vinegar.  I used fresh cilantro.  The salad was even better the NEXT DAY.  I recommend making this a day ahead of time to have all the saesoning really soak into the veggies.  DELISH!

This smelled wonderful! Next time, I would double the amount of cucumber. Very easy to prepare and it looked good also. I used fresh tomatoes instead of stewed ones. Will make again.

This would be good served on top of chicken.  The TBS of red pepper I cut to 1 tsp. I did use the mex. tomatoes and fresh cilantro.   I doubled the cucumber.  Good for a hot day but not special enough for 5 stars

We loved this salad! I used Mexican style stewed tomatoes, fresh cilantro, and 1/2 the red pepper flakes. This was very tasty with our basil burgers.Thanks Ecuadorita!

I used fresh tomatoes, one large red pepper (I omitted the green pepper because we don't care for it), I cut the red pepper flake back to just a sprinkling (I'm feeding two kids) and I used a handful of fresh cilantro. We thought this was good, though the canned corn wasn't great in this with all the other fresh, organic ingredients I used. When I make this again, I'll find some way to incorporate fresh corn that I steamed, cut off the cob and cooled. I'd add some fresh lime juice, too. This is a good recipe that is made better with fresh ingredients.

Refreshing, light, and delicious, that is if you use fresh ingredients... I opted to use some leftover grilled corn, cherry tomatoes that I cut in half and fresh cilantro vs. dried.  I also upped the amount of garlic and cut the abount of red pepper flakes in half. All it need was a little fresh lime juice and overall, it was very tasty.

This tastes great and is very easy to make.  I peeled the cukes, took out the seeds and cut them in chunks.  Less watery that way.  Used leftovers as a salsa with chips.  Especially like those lime flavored chips by Tostitos.

Thank you so much submitter!  We love salads but as soon as summer is over in NJ that is the end of my salad making - the tomatoes in the stores are horrendous. Using the stewed tomatoes was brilliant - the leftover salad the next day was just as good since the tomoatoes were stewed!  This will be a keeper during the winter and I plan to use it in the summer when I can use fresh tomoatoes.  The seasonsing were just the right touch.  Again, thank you.

I didn't have cumin or cilantro, but this was still excellent.  I figured my fiance wouldn't care for it because he's not a big vinegar fan, but he ate more of it than I did!! I added a little olive oil, but other than that, I didn't change a thing! Thanks for a tasty and different salad :o)

I didn't have all the ingrediants to this so I improvised with what I had. I didn't add green pepper so I just left that out. Added some fresh chopped garlic and cumin for some kick (we like spicy) and it was good even after it sate for a couple of days. Thanks, we will be using it again and again. Sonya

I can't believe this received such good reviews!!  My boyfriend and I didn't like this salad at all and ended up throwing it all in the garbage!  It was way too hot and the corn made it very hard to eat!!  Only giving it 2 stars bc it was easy to make!

This recipe as written is only okay.  But if you substitute FRESH ingredients you really have something special!!!  I used a huge english cucumber, fresh tomatos, fresh corn from the cob, and fresh cilantro & garlic.

Either my crushed red pepper flakes are very potent or other reviewers have a higher tolerance for pain.  I found that a Tablespoon of crushed red pepper flakes was just way too much for me!  Next time, I'll cut back to 1 teaspoon for more balance of flavors.  Also, since cherry tomatoes are in full season, I used 2 cups of them instead of canned stewed tomatoes.

This recipe has just the right amount of "bite" without being overpowering.  My husband thought it would be a good side dish for fried chicken.  It was so easy to make and fast!  I'll be making it again for sure.

This was quite good! I thought it needed to sit for a few hours to let the flavors meld, but the next day it was great - so I recommend making this a day ahead!

Great salad - didn't change a THING! and as per other reviewers, it tastes even BETTER the next day! So plan ahead and make it even the night before you need it.  I did use one fresh tomato as opposed to the canned (less sodium that way) and I scaled the recipe down to 3 servings as it was only for me to try it first (I am the guinea pig around my house). EXCELLENT recipe! Thanks!

Awesome!  Nice fresh flavours.  Used fresh cilantro instead of dried.  Made it with Gerry's Chicken Enchiladas, great compliment.

I made all sorts of modifications based on the reviews.  Based on the changes, I would rate this recipe 5 stars.  I used halved cherry tomatoes with English cucumber and used cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes.  I also used frozen corn that came seasoned with lime and cilantro so I cut out the cilantro completely.  I followed reviewers' advice to make it the night before to let flavors blend and would definitely suggest it.  This salad looked really pretty and fresh and had just the right amount of flavor and heat.  Great for summer potlucks!

I left out the tomatoes (husband hates tomatoes) and red pepper flakes (didn't have any), and added a few dashes of onion powder and it tasted crisp and fresh with a great flavor to compliment our Mexican fare.

A big hit at my house.  The only change I made was to use fresh cilantro.  Served as a side dish with tacos and then ate with chips the next day.  Perfect for summer!

Very easy to throw together and great flavor. I used fresh tomato instead of canned. Turned out quite spicy!! I also added some chopped green onion.

This was good,light and refreshing. I added half a bunch of chopped green onions,1 1/2 tsp of sugar,and a tsp of oregano. Next time I'll reduce the crushed pepper seeds,my husband thought it was a little hot!

With garden fresh ingredients - this was delish!  We did sub fresh tomatoes & fresh cilantro (and added an extra little squeeze of lime juice) and everyone at the table enjoyed this.

very good, however I chop my pepper flakes and maybe that makes them stronger because next time I would only use half the recommended amount.

This was a nice summer salad, but it wasn't anything too special. I would probably make this again, but would likely cut the red pepper flakes in half. By the next day the heat from the pepper flakes had increased significantly, and the salad was inedible.

This is a great recipe that's easy and fast. Keeps well. The only thing that I changed was I added black beans because it just seemed to fit in with the flavours and textures of the salad and I wasn't disappointed. I also added a bit more garlic and red wine vinaigrette to compensate for the larger portion. Thanks for sharing this one!

Used fresh tomatoes, cilantro and cucumber from our garden. It makes all the difference in the world. I didn't use red pepper flakes, but opted to use a few dashes of Tabasco. Would have rated this recipe a  5 star if everyone in the family liked it as much as me. I will be making this again regardless.

Great recipe! I made a few additions/changes to suit our personal tastes though. I added 1/2 a small red onion,chopped, doubled the vinegar, used fresh plum tomatoes rather than the stewed, fresh cilantro rather than dried, and fresh sweet corn(used a can of white kernal corn once also and was almost as good) also a splash of lime juice. All veggies diced to about the size of corn kernals. We eat this w tortilla chips like a fresh garden salsa.

This is a great salad recipe. I gave it 4 stars, deducting a star for hot as hell. I like spicy foods but for a salad this was a bit too much. Cut the crushed peppers in half. I used the stewed tomatoes and would recommend them, it made for a lot of juicy flavor.

Awesome salad. I didn't have red pepper flakes so I used a teaspoon of powder and it was just fine, definitely spicy enough. I used fresh cilantro and mixed all of the spice ingredients with the vinegar before pouring on the veggies. It was the perfect side for shrimp enchiladas.

I used fresh cilantro, a can of Rotel instead of regular canned tomatoes and added some chives that needed to be used. It was good but not as good as another similar recipe from this site that I have made.

I absolutely love this salad on a hot evening.  I make it with mostly fresh ingredients.  Recently, I starting adding about a cup of black beans for more protein.  It's also great as salsa with some tortilla chips.

It was alright.  I used fresh cilantro.  And I didn't use the tablespoon of red pepper flakes. My roommate loved it.  it was a nice fresh side with my mexican meal but it didn't blow me away like the other things did.  I may make again.

This was a nice, refreshing, crunchy salad. I was quite glad it called for dried cilantro (coriander) as opposed to fresh, as I'm the only one who likes cilantro in my family, although I would have used it if I could. The coriander gave this a much different, but pleasant, flavor, and provided a perfect backdrop for the cumin. I can't account for how much heat this has, as I left out the tablespoon of hot pepper flakes. I also used fresh tomatoes rather than canned, but otherwise followed as written.

Very good salad, I substituted Balsamic vinegar (because it's what we had at home) and fresh coriander instead of dried. It tastes wonderful just made, but it's even better if you leave it in the fridge for a while.

I loved this salad, but toned down the red pepper. I suggest starting at a tsp. and working your way up by the 1/4 or 1/2 tsp. I ended up with half of what the recipe calls for. I used the canned corn, since I didn't have any fresh around right then. Next time I am going to steam a couple or three ears of corn and cut it from the cob. I also added a can of black beans. It is wonderful. I can see it will be a favorite in my house.

I followed the direction using cherry tomatoes as other reviews suggested.  I also doubled the dressing as we like more dressing.  We topped each bowl at serving time with a few crushed tortilla chips, Yummy! Good recipe, I will definitely make this again.

This is delish!  So refreshing and a perfect side to BBQing Carne Asada tacos outside!  Like other reviewers, I also added 2 tblspns of lime juice, used fresh cilantro and 2 ears of corn fresh off the cob.  I made the salad the night before to allow the flavors to combine - and right before serving I added one diced avocado.  Will make again and again!  (My husband suggested adding shrimp, crab and squid, taking out the cucumber for a homemade Ceviche.  Fantastic idea if you're a Ceviche fan!!!!)

This was alright, but not as good as I'd hoped.  Another reviewer suggested adding green onion, and I think that would have helped.  I also thought of maybe adding some fresh lime juice (1-2 tsp?).  It just needs that "zing."  And I thought the canned tomatoes were too mushy to go with all the fresh veggies - fresh would have been much better, in my opinion.  I'm not sure I will try this again, but if I do, I am going to modify it a bit and see if that helps.  I will say it looked really pretty, though.

Delicious! I used cider vinegar, as I was out of red wine vinegar; it worked very well. I also skipped the onion as we aren't fans and used fresh cilantro instead of dried. This has a great blend of flavors, as well as being really colorful and refreshing. I will definitely be making this again. Thank you!

I love this dish! It is so versatile and can be used a thousand ways. I used all fresh ingredients and added red onion and feta cheese. Next time I think I'll add black beans and couscous so it's a complete meal. I think this would make a great filler for tacos (with or without meat), burritos, etc. Delish!!

This was a refreshing salad and I loved the combination of the bell pepers and cucumber. 
My husband loved it but thought it was too spicy, so next time I will tone it down a little.
Great recipe!

This is better than GREAT! I have made this 4 times and is always a hit with everyone.  I did not have cilantro so I used basil.  Once I used fresh tomatoes and frozen corn(thawed) only had green bell peppers - everything still came out great. Husband said it was good and HOT.

I got a handful of cucumbers from a co-worker and had some fresh cilantro from my garden and stumbled across this guy.  
I used fresh tomato and cilantro as well.  I also used pomagranite red wine vinegar and a sweet green pepper.  I used it as a nice salsa this evening.  Paired great with a glass of Sav. Blanc.

I made this for a cinco de mayo party and have made it for 2 more gathering since. It is a very refreshing crisp salad as well as a fantastic compliment to enchiladas! I also used fresh tomatoes instead of the canned but if I was in a bigger hurry I think the canned would do just fine!! Yummy!

This is a nice and refreshing salad. I used our Jersey tomato's to make this and because we detest it, I left out the cilantro and used parsley to garnish. An avacado helped to make this even better. Delicious and thank you!

Loved it! I used all fresh ingredients, 1.5 cucumbers (because it didn't look quite cucumbery enough with everything else), and a little more cilantro; otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. The mix of flavors was perfectly balanced--no one taste dominated. I seeded the cukes so the salad wouldn't get soggy, and it was even better the next day. I brought it to work and added chopped avocado--fantastic, and the avocado cut down the heat a little.

Really good. I did use halved cherry tomatoes as we're not canned tomato lovers and also used fresh cilantro. Quite spicy but not unbearably so. My husband's a wimp in the spice department and he said it was ok. Can see me making this again and again. Thanks.

The salad is wonderful, however I did make some changes.  I chose to use fresh grape tomatoes, diced onion, fresh cilantro, added a bit more cucumber and cut back on the red pepper flakes. For color I used red,green and orange bell pepper.

I didn't put the corn in as I don't liked canned.  In the future, I would use fresh tomatoes instead of stewed.

I made it almost to the recipe.  I changed out the stewed tomatoes for a can of roasted tomatoes with green chilies and I used fresh cilantro. (About 1/2 cup)  I also added about a teaspoon of sugar.

It is interesting that the recipe calls for dried (in other words practically flavorless) cilantro but the photo has fresh cilantro in it. This recipe was just ok as written.  I couldn't agree more with those saying use fresh ingredients.  I made it as written the first time.  Second time I made it I used an English cucumber as another review suggested, fresh corn cut off the cob, fresh diced tomatoes and fresh cilantro.  I also cut way back on the red pepper flakes.  Instead I added a diced and seeded jalapeno pepper and 1 tsp cayenne pepper.  I know, it makes it a totally different recipe, but for me it was much more appetizing.

I have made this for several years and in the summer it is one of my go-to recipes for using up fresh veggies from the garden. I like spice so I include the full tablespoon of red pepper flakes (or sub in jalapeño or habanero peppers) but this can be pared down to cut back on the heat. Usually I end up using fresh tomatoes but the canned works fine too. I also prefer fresh cilantro as other reviewers have suggested. I tend to eat this more as a thick salsa with tortillas chips or on top of tacos than as a salad.

This is so light and satisfying! It had more flavor than I was expecting. I went lighter on the red pepper flakes because of my spice level preference.

8 2 17  ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/56136/mexican-cucumber-salad/ ... Too many cucs makes a person make a lot of cuc salads.  This is in the top three; top one, actually!  I thought 1T crushed red had to be a misprint, but 1t is too little maybe 1/2T?   I thawed frozen corn, used fresh grape toms; had some extra chopped red onion from another salad so added it.  This may not truly be a five star, but it is the one I like best; orrrr it may be a five star, I'm just cuked out with cuc salads.  :D  Either way, it's good.  ;)  Note4Me:  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/56136/mexican-cucumber-salad/ ... favorite

This was alright...I used an extra cucumber and an extra tablespoon of Red Wine Vinegar.  Holy Jesus there is too much red pepper.  Use 1 teaspoon at most.  Thought about adding some red onion.  Will likely do that next time, and use fresh tomato.  In fact, I will likely just look for a different recipe.

I found this recipe in my April/May 2017 AR magazine.  I followed the recipe exactly as written until it came to the red wine vinegar.  I did not have that in the pantry so substituted apple cider vinegar.  I also did not put in a teaspoon of crushed red pepper flakes.  I knew better at I do not like food too spicy.  I probably put in 1/8th tsp at most.  My husband loved this.  I thought it had good flavor and I would make it again.  I was surprised it didn't have any oil in it.  Thanks, Ecuadorita

This was good as written in the allrecipes magazine.  I used fresh roma tomatoes and a bag of frozen, grilled corn with peppers and onions.  Also I used fresh cilantro.  Really good!

I love the combination. I didn't care for canned items. I used frozen corn cooked in the microwave and then chilled it while prepping other items. I also used 3 fresh tomatoes and made a fresh lime vinaigrette. It was very good.

i left out the red pepper flake... subbed fresh tomateos for the canned.. i used garlic powder (the same amount) for the fresh and added 1/2 t garlic salt.. i doubled the cumin and black pepper.. and added another 1/8 t salt.. i also added some lime juice and a few shakes of chili powder.. i let it sit overnight and it was still on the bland side.. hence trying to doctor it up.. the concept is good.. the seasonings are just lacking

Light and refreshing. I recommend this salad for a potluck or summer lunch/dinner.  Sometimes I put a little more of one or another ingredient, but it always turns out tasty!

Es muy bueno y es muy pico!  I picked up my bountiful baskets this morning and there were 2 cucumbers, cilantro and a tomato.  I had corn from last week so I whipped this up this morning.  I used all fresh ingredients, but since I added the extra cucumber I doubled the red wine vinegar, but not the spices.  I actually re read the directions to make sure it really had a tablespoon of red pepper flakes in it.  If you don't like your food spicy I would go with 1/2 or less.  My husband is eating his with chicken wrapped in a tortilla.  My mouth is still zipping.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious and very refreshing.  Fresh cilantro is fabulous with this instead of dried.  I actually liked this salad better fresher--when it sat for just the 30 mins as opposed to any longer, but that is certainly a matter of personal taste.

Really spicy.  I've made this twice and always forget how hot it really is.  Still tastes great and it is a big hit.  Will dial down the red pepper flakes a lot next time.  Very fresh.  A great summer dish.

Great healthy and tasty recipe.  After a hungry trip tot he grocery store, I made the following changes: 1. Used 2 fresh tomatoes instead of stewed.  2. Increased red wine vinegar, crushed red pepper flakes, and garlic.  3. Used fresh chopped cilantro instead of dried.  4. Added a few green onions, my favorite.  Even my fiance who dislikes most healthy things loved this dish.

This salad tasted like it couldn't decide what it was, the different flavors competed. But my kids really liked it, which is always nice when it comes to salad. I doubled the corn, and used apple cider vinegar instead of wine vinegar.

As written, this is a 4.  I changed it to suit my tastes with cherry tomatoes rather than stewed, fresh cilantro, and I added jicama for a crunch.  It was a hit for tailgating and even better left over.

aye Caramba! This was a good salad, but a little too much heat for me. Next time I will reduce the red pepper to one tsp. instead of a tablespoon.

The sweetness of the corn, saltiness of the tomatoes, crunch of the cucumbers and the heat of the peppers was a great flavor combination.  I used a fresh jalapeno instead of the crushed red pepper and fresh cilantro instead of dried. I will certainly make this again.

This recipe is so perfect for the summer. I used tomatos that were seasoned with chili  peppers, etc for an extra kick. I cut back on the corn to maybe 1/2 cup...

This was so easy, and went fantastically with mexican smothered pork chops. SO simple, and if you chopped everything smaller would make a great salsa.

This is GREAT!!!!! I took it to my family's 4th of July gathering & it was a hit!  Everyone asked for the recipe.  I followed the advice of others & used fresh cilantro.  I also used fresh tomatoes from my garden.  I realized after the salad was complete that I had chopped the veggies a bit small (more of a dice than a chop) so I bought some corn chips and served it as a refreshing salsa.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe that I will use over & over!!!

I used 2 big cucumbers but I made the chucks a little big...I would have preferred a less chunky salad. I used a can of diced stewed tomatoes. Very good salad although I think my expectations for it @ dinner were raised by my grandson's comment at lunch. He really likes cukes & he said this was better than a pyramid of candy. LOL Don't know that I thought it was THAT good but it was pretty good.

Wonderful salad!!  I have made several times now and everyone enjoys it.  I also use fresh cilantro, not dried, 1/2 of each bell pepper and either fresh or canned tomatoes.  Thanks for this keeper of a recipe.
