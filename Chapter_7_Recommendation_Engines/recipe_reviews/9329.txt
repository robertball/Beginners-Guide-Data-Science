I made this recipe with my husband and son last week.  I liked it very much.  However, if you are looking for a true gingerbread tasting cookie, this is NOT it.  I tried this recipe because I thought my 3 year old would turn his nose up to real gingerbread.  I would describe this as a cross between a gingerbread cookie and a butter/sugar cookie.  It was great.  My cookies did not run.  They looked great and tasted great.  They had a nice soft texture.  If you have to go out and get butterscotch pudding.....you better get one or two more boxes because we didn't get that many cookies out of this.  We had a blast making them.  Fun to eat too!  It made a nice mild tasting gingerbread cookie.  I was very pleased.

Delicious! The dough was so easy to work with, not sticky and rolled out wonderfully. (That in itself really sold me on this recipe as I tend to shy away from rolled dough recipes because they are time consuming and usually the dough is a hassle.) I did increase the cinnamon and ginger to taste and added cloves for a spicer cookie. I also used the instant pudding instead of the cook-and-serve and they turned out great. I did double the recipe and used half margarine and half butter. Baked 8-9 minutes instead of the 10-12 resulting in a softer chewier version of this classic. You definitely taste the butterscotch which I found to be a surprisingly pleasant alternative, and I liked the fact that it didn't use molasses. I cut-out various sizes of large, medium and small little buddies and decorated them with raisins and white piped icing and they came out adorable! Thanks for sharing Kim and this one is going in my family favorites cookbook~

this is the perfect gingerbread man recipe for children! i brought these to a cookie exchange party last year and the kids gobbled these right up but snubbed the traditional gingerbread men that were very spicy.  i decorated the cookies with a very simple design made out of the following vanilla icing/glaze:  

combine 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons softened butter, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/4 teaspoon salt, and 3-4 tablesppons of milk and stir until smooth and well blended.  adjust for spreading or piping consistency by adding more milk or powdered sugar.  

i put the icing in a gallon food storage bag and took a tiny tiny snip off one of the corners of the bag and pipped two eyes, a smile, squiggly lines at the hands and feet, and three buttons topped with cinnamon red candies.  make sure you let the cookies sit out so the icing hardens before stacking for storage or putting on the cookie tray.

I used instant pudding because that was all my little grocery store had.  It turned out fine.  The taste is more mild than typical which is good because my kids don't usually like ginger bread.  They liked these.  The dough was easy to handle, roll, cut, and decorate.  The cookies were sturdy but not tough.  Somewhere between crispy and chewy.  I will make these again.  Definitely use a mixer or you won't get all the flour in.

This is easy & makes a nice dough for cutting. My kids love them. I found that 10 minutes was too long to bake, 8-9 made a slightly softer cookie with better flavor. I melted white & milk chocolate chips (separately) and dipped the pants of the gingerbread man into the chocolate. What a hit for a cookie exchange! Thanks.

Fantastic Cookie! I wasn't sure about making a gingerbread cookie that didn't have molasses as an ingredient.  However, I love butterscotch-anything and, after reading the other reviews, I thought I'd give this recipe a chance.  I'm so glad that I did!  YUMMY!!!  Very easy to work with, even my neighbor's young children were able to roll these out and cut them.  I served them at a Christmas party last year with many other cookies.  These were the first to go and when I asked my guests to take cookies with them as they left, they all wanted to know where my "secret stash" of these were hidden.  I appeased them by printing out copies of this recipe.  Thank you, Kim for a delicious and easy recipe!

This is the first rolled cookie I've ever made (I'm not a baker:) and I think it turned out great! Super easy recipe and not too many ingredients. I was a little freaked after creaming the butter, sugar and pudding mix because it was crumbly and not Creamy. but after adding the flour with the mixer, I just pressed it into a ball and chilled. Turned out fine. also I only cooked them 8-9 minutes. 10-11 was too long. This is a wonderful recipe for a first timer like myself!!

Not a bad recipe, especially with the buttercotch mix and omitting of sticky molasses. 
Initially, after combining both the dry and moist mixture, the dough was VERY DRY. DO NOT GET DISHEARTENED!! Keep rolling the dough around--I had to get into it with my hand and finally it started to come together. 
I only refrigerated for about fifteen minutes in the coldest part of my fridge (I wouldn't hesitate to put it in the freezer for about ten minutes either) before rolling it out. I also noticed some red streaks in the dough; anybody else?? Not sure why.

These are the best gingerbread cookies. My mom has made them for years. The dough is absolutely wonderful. I would suggest underbaking slightly. This may taste good as a drop cookie. I might try that next time.

This recipe was wonderfully easy and tasty. Make life easier and neater. Don't flour the rolling surface or rolling pin. Roll between two sheets of parchment paper. Remove top sheet, remove dough scraps. Place bottom sheet, with cookies, directly on cookie sheet. No need to grease pan. When baked, put sheet of cookies on cooling rack. No broken arms or legs falling through the cracks!

I've made this recipe and it came out great.  I did not refrigerate the dough.  I did not roll out the dough. I did a soft drop cookie and iced them with a Butter Vanilla Icing.  They were great.  For those who are having problems with crumbly dough, here's what I suggest.  Use real butter that has been softened in the microwave.  Should be a cross between melting and still holding it's shape.  Use large eggs.  I creamed the butter, eggs, sugar, Butterscotch pudding, baking soda and spices.  Once these were nicely mixed, I added the flour.  Do "not" use heaping cups of flour. And you can decrease the flour a bit in the recipe since you are rolling it out and the dough will gather up the flour you are rolling it out in.  I do this with all of my rolled recipes.  I decrease the flour by about 1/4 cup -1/3 cup.  Then the difference is made up in with the flour the dough is rolled out in.  As for these cookies, I will be making plenty more of these.  They were great.

These are awesome! Perfect for decorating or eating plain. I used the exact ingredients and did not change any quantities. Here are a few tips that helped them turn out great!  -make sure you use "cook and serve" pudding NOT instant -the butter and eggs are best used at room temperature for this recipe -don't add too much flour, when measuring make sure your cup of flour is level, not heaping and not packed down -if you are in a very dry room, put a pot of boiling water on the stove while you are making the dough -roll the dough thin -make sure your cut outs are cold when going into the oven, I put them on the baking sheet in the freezer for 10 min. prior to baking

This is not your traditional gingerbread--and I loved that!  I have a toddler, and was looking for something more mild.  She gobbled these up!  I only had vanilla pudding, so i used that, and it still tasted great.  I can't wait to use butterscotch (i love the flavor).  I used margarine instead of butter and next time i think i will cut the ginger to 1 tsp to suit my tastes.  I didn't have any problem with stickiness or dryness, and this was one of the best cut out cookie recipe i've made.  I split the dough in half, then put the other part back in the fridge until i needed it.  Mine cooked for a full 10 min and were just perfect, so keep an eye on them; at 8 min, they were still doughy.  Will make these a new yearly tradition, but will def double the recipe because they disappeared!  Decorated with the sugar cookie frosting on this site (powdered sugar, corn syrup, water instead of milk, food colorng).
UPDATE (11/11): I used pumpkin spice pudding mix, with half of the amount of salt, cream cheese frosting and these were awesome for fall!

I loved these cookies!  The recipe is very quick to make (I mean not including the hour it spends in the fridge), not very messy, and most importantly, it tastes wonderful.  I thought they were the best gingerbread I've ever had.  The only things I changed were I added a bit more ginger and a lot more cinnamon, and next time I'm going to add more flour to the dough because the first batch that I cut out were really hard to get off the table and onto the cookie sheet because they were so soft.  My friends thought they were great, too, and a friend from Korea stopped by right as I was beginning to roll them out, so he stayed and helped make them.  They were his first taste of gingerbread cookies and he thought they were excellent, too.  Definitely the recipe I'll use for gingerbread in the future!  Thanks a bunch! *revision* Since I wrote this review, I've made the recipe but added enough flour so I could roll the cookies out easily without refrigerating them, and they turned out wonderfully like that, too!

These cookies are DELICIOUS!!!  As a Christmas gift, a good friend of mine mixed the dry ingredients together, sealed them in a mason jar,  tied a cute ribbon around the jar & added the directions for wet ingredients &  cookie cutter.  This was our FAVORITE holiday activitiy this year, & we hope to make it a tradition!  My kids had a wonderful time deocrating & helping to make these cookies.  So much fun!!   Thanks to my friend, Cara!!

These were very good - first time I've ever made ginger bread men.  I added a little extra ginger for more ginger flavor.  I could have used a frosting recipe, but they were still good without it.

Thank you!  This is with out a doubt the best gingerbread cookie recipe I have tried.  It is a little milder, but as most reviewers have said that doesn't hurt one bit.  I only made two changes.  I used instant pudding instead of cook and serve, which they didn't have at my store.  And, I added a 1/2 teaspoon of cloves and a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, to give it what I think of as the traditional gingerbread flavor.  Flavor-wise it could rate 5 stars, but on top of that, I have never had an easier dough to roll out.  I only let it chill about 15-20 minutes and it rolled out beautifully with very little flour and transferring it to the cookie sheet was a snap.  Very cake-like in texture and crumb.  This will DEFINITELY become a yearly tradition.

The butterscotch and lack of molasses is what made me want to try this recipe.  As written, it's very good.  I made the following changes, but only because my family like a "zingy" gingerbread.  For spices, I used: 2 tsp grated fresh ginger, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp cardamom, .5 tsp nutmeg, .5 tsp ground clove. I put all of the spices together in a mortar and pestle and "pestled" them together, which releases extra oils from the spices. I also added the spices after the egg, but before the flour and baking soda. 

A planetary mixer (like a kitchen aid) is a real help for this recipe, it creates a very stiff dough that is probably more than a rotary hand mixer can manage.

MMMMmazing!  Very good flavor.  I followed the recipe to a T except added 1/8ts more ginger and cinnamon.  

At first I thought I was going to need to add milk to the mixture but after a while it started to come together and form a dough.  You have to really mix it well, continue mixing it, and it will form into a dough.  I did refrigerate for an hour and it got hard enough to roll out, but it does soften up real quick after taking it out.

Our gingerbread men did not come out so cute.  They spread out on the pan a lot.  Still resembled gingerbread men though.  

I also made a few round cookies and I think this recipe suites them better than gingerbread men.  

This recipe says it makes 30 gingerbread men....No way.  there is very little dough when it's all mixed together.  I got 18 cookies out of using a small cookie cutter, which gave me 12 gingerbread men cookies, and the other 6 were round cookies I made making small balls and flattening them down a little.  

Pros: taste great, chewy cookies, easy to make, just a few cheap ingredients.

Cons: because they are soft, they don't form very well into shapes. ie: gingerbread men, rolling it out was a little tricky too bc the dough has to be hard or it will be too sticky to roll so definatley refridgerate for an hour.  

Tips If your cookies spread out too much too try,  50/50 butter and margerin, use baking powder instead of baking soda.

These are fantastic!  Make a double batch when cooking them because they don't stick around very long!  Everyone loved them and they were a hit for the Christmas season.

Crazy about this cookie, iced or not, cooked about a minute less so it was soft, yum!

I used whole wheat flour.    I thought I had messed up the recipe because the mix was so dry, but after playing with the chilled dough by hand for 10 minutes, it started to come together.  When I rolled it out it was fine.  These don't have a very sweet taste (just like real gingerbread).  My very picky and healthy partner loved them because they don't taste like you're eating a fattening sugar factory!

So yummy.  Handed these out to the neighborhood for the cookie exchange and also served at the family holiday party...received lots and lots of positive feedback! They are delicious and soft.  Will definitely make them again.

Good recipe to jar up for Christmas gifts!  The cookies are mild and more of a cross between a shortbread cookie and a Gingerbread cookie.  The kids liked them a lot.

I wasn't sure about this recipe until a couple days after I made them. The flavor sneaks up on you. It's a little milder than traditional cookies which make it great for kids who don't like "spicy" cookies.

I got out my pudding and was like, "Dang, what the  am I gonna do with all this freakin' pudding?" My kids were whining, "Mom, we want cookies!" So what I did next was jump on this here cookin' site and looked up cookies and I found this awesome mad cow of a recipe. I straight up went to the kitchen and whipped these bad boys up. They are off the hook, ya'll! My kids are all up in my stuff now, sayin', "Dang, Mom, these are bangin', you feel me?" Son, do yourself a favor and make these cookies NOW. Your street cred will go up by like, a bazillion. I'm out, y'all.

Be sure to use one LARGE egg and not any other size.  I used a medium egg and the dough came out so dry it was cracking.  Once I added more egg (and some more flour to compensate) the recipe came out fine.  Very tasty!

DOUBLE THE RECIPE !!! You will definately need to at least double the recipe, if not quadruple it.  I made 2 inch circles, to try the recipe out. I only got 24 cookies. Other than the yield being off, this is a wonderful recipe. I made these for my family, as I don't care for gingerbread, and I thought they were great. I think they taste like a cross between gingerbread cookies and spice cake. The flavor is more mild than a traditional gingerbread cookie.

I missed the molasses of traditional gingerbread but this is a great, mild kid-friendly version.  I made the recipe as written and had no trouble working with the dough as others did.  I used my 1/4" rolling pin rings and used confectioners sugar to roll it in as well as parchment paper on the pans.  100% success.  Iced with lemon flavoring...delicious!  Thanks for sharing.

I made these for my daughter's class party.  I think this recipe is more friendly to little taste buds because the kids ate them all up!  Personally, I'd prefer a stronger flavor to my gingerbread but this really worked well for the kids.

Delicious!! These are so good and EASY to work with - which is important because cut out cookies easily frustrate me : ). The only thing I would definately change is to use 1 1/4 cup of flour because the dough was to dry - i had to make 2 batches in order to get it to the right consistency. The dough after that was a firm enough texture that I didn't have to refrigerate it. It rolled and cut perfectly. : ) I also used vanilla pudding and added 1/2 tsp of cloves and 1/2 tsp of ginger. Yum. My boyfriend loved them and isn't a huge gingerbread fan. This one goes in the recipe box!!!

Nice and soft, not dry, great buttery flavor.  My guests raved and ate them all.  I baked them for 9-10 minutes.  I will add a bit of salt and some vanilla next time.  Don't overmix the dough--just enough til blended.

This recipe is delicious and turns out great every time.  I add red hots for the eyes and buttons for extra cinnamon flavor.  When I'm in a hurry, I roll the dough into small balls and press the balls down with the back of a greased, floured glass.  Not quite as pretty but tastes just as good!

This recipe is easy, easy easy!  I make it every Christmas and everyone loves these cookies - even those who initially turn them down because they don't care for gingerbread. Be sure to print a couple extra recipes when taking them out because you're going to get a lot of requests for the recipe!

My second time making these this season.  Easy, and delicious.  Kid-friendly!  For those of you who find this dry....keep mixing!  I used the instant pudding, it starts out dry but you just have to keep mixing, and mixing and mixing.

Perfect!  The dough was a little stiff when first removed from the fridge, but rolled out just fine as it warmed.  My husband loves regular sugar cookies but said these are even better, and none of us like the average gingerbread cookie but can't stop grabbing these to nibble as we go by the kitchen.  For those who, like myself and my family, don't like icing or don't want to bother, I decorated the cookies prior to cooking by pricking designs into them with a toothpick. They are gorgeous and delicious!  Thanks!!

These rolled out very cleanly on waxed paper. The flavor was mild enough for my kids, not too heavy on the spice but still distictly gingerbready. All I had was instant vanilla pudding mix, and it came out fine. I measured the flour by scooping it, so the dough was firm enough to roll out immediately, and didn't need the chill time. 8 min bake time was perfect.

This recipe is delicious!! They're soooo easy to roll out. Instead of using flours to prevent the sticking, I rolled them between wax paper. It makes cleaning up a breeze =)

I skipped the icing and frosting and made indentations instead. They came out beautiful =) I did bake them for only 8 minutes (I like my cookies on the chewy side). I wish it were Christmas everyday so I can bake these all year long. Heck, maybe I will after all... =) Thanks for sharing!

I LOVE this gingerbread recipe!  I'm really not a fan of molasses so this recipe is a perfect substitute for me. I've been making it for the past couple of years and they are always eaten up immediately.

Great cookies. The only reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is because it only produced about 17 cookies, not the 30 the recipe said it yielded. Otherwise, great recipe!

Pleasantly surprised at how good these are.  Although I prefer a much spicier cookie, kids will LOVE these.  They made about 24 small (3x2) gingerbread men.  We baked for 10 minutes on parchment and they were great.  Looked very soft but crisped up while on sheets.

I had no problem with dryness in this recipe at all, it was no more of a dry dough than sugar cookie dough is.  I love that I had all the ingredients except the pudding mix in my cupboard already.  I really enjoyed the cookies, I think they're a great "holiday" tasting cookie for those who don't like the strong taste of gingerbread.  This will be my Christmas gift cookie.

I thought I reviewed this back in 2006, but I guess I never did.  This is a fantastic alternative to the classic gingerbread men!  It is not over loaded with molasses and ginger and instead offers a butterscotch ginger flavor that is perfect!!  I couldn't find ANY instant or stove top butterscotch pudding so I went ahead and bought a 4 pack of kraft ready to eat butterscotch pudding.  This worked like a charm!  I also baked the cookies 2 minutes under the original time and they came out so moist and delicious!  Thank you for this awesome recipe!

Just finished making the dough and waiting the one hour before I bake.  A quick question?  Can I use the icing in the tubes that you decorate cakes with on these cookies after they've cooled?  Thanks.

After reading so many great reviews, I had to try this recipe.  Thanks to all for your reviews, because this is the best gingerbread recipe I've ever tasted! 

Although I generally like gingerbread cookies, I can usually only eat one because I find them too strong.  These, however, were perfect.  They're more like a vanilla/butterscotch cookie with a *hint* of gingerbread.  Of course, it's just a matter of taste, but for me, it couldn't be better!

They were easy to handle, baked quickly, and came out a very nice shade of brown.  I decorated both with raisins and dipped in chocolate, which only enhanced the cookie. 

I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  I did, however, let the batter harden in the fridge for 2 days.  Then when I was going to make them, I let it gradually warm at room temperature.  Just when it was soft enough to handle, but still cold enough to hold together, I made them.  Also, don't overwork the batter by rolling it all at once. Take it apart as you go, making 3-4 at a time.
Will keep the batter firm for you.

I have made these gingerbread men for several years now and they are always a big hit! My family begs for them each Christmas and they are the first cookie to go.  I do alter the recipe a bit by adding 1 tsp each of salt and allspice.  Plus you really need to at least double this recipe if you want a good number of cookies.  I use a  fairly standrd Wilson cookie cutter and only get about 18 cookies per recipe. I could eat that many myself, these are so good!!

These were GREAT! They are easier to roll out than sugar cookies and they taste delicious. I followed the suggestions of others and only baked them for 7 minutes to make them softer. The dough is very forgiving and not too spicy - my 7 year old loved them! I will be making these again!

This was a very easy recipe.  After reading the other reviews, I decided to triple the recipe.  I yielded 36 gingerbread men. The only other adjustment I made was to use half of the ginger called for in the recipe so that it wouldn't be too strong for my kids. The dough was easy to work with, not too sticky and not so dry to cause cracks in the cookies.  I used chocolate chips for the eyes, Twizzler pull and peel strips cut into very small pieces for the mouth, and red hots for buttons.  My kids loved the taste and I did too. Adorable, tasty, fun and easy to make!!

These cookies were so much easier to cut out than others I have tried and they tasted pretty good. The only thing i changed was used coconut cream pudding instead of butterscotch because thats what I had and they were still good. Will definitely make again 4 year old could have rolled dough and cut cookies all day. Also if you really like gingerbread this is not the recipe for you (being that I don't like it I thought this was great)

Delicious and easy to make. Try adding more ginger if you want it to taste like traditional gingerbread cookies.  Tastes good enough on its own without icing too.  
Dough can be re-rolled.  You will need to lightly flour the surface that will be used to roll out the dough, and flour the rolling pin as well.  Don't worry about using too much flour when rolling, it won't change the results.
Thanks for a quick & easy recipe!

As other reviewers noted, this is a very mild gingerbread recipe. For me they were perfect because I prefer them with less spice. If you like a traditional gingersnap, you may want to find a different recipe. 

I thought the dough worked up perfectly. It was the perfect consistency and rolled out nicely.  As a final note, I only cooked mine for 6 minutes and they came out nicely.

These cookies turned out great!  The dough was really stiff to roll out but not sticky which made it easy for my kids to help with.  The taste is excellent and we got many compliments on these cookies over the holidays.

These cookie were so good! Everyone at my Christmas party enjoyed decorating and eating these. I bought Betty Crocker White Decorating Cookie Icing to use. It worked wonderfully because it cam in a ready to use tube. We also decorated with M&M's. I will make these again on Christmas for sure!!!

I followed the recipe, and they turned out great.  Make sure not to roll out the dough too thin, or the gingerbread heads and limbs will fall off.

Wonderfully kid-friendly!  I tripled the recipe with no problems using a stand mixer.  Simply kept it going until it came together in a ball.  I've made versions using butterscotch (instant) pudding and vanilla (instant) and noticed the butterscotch provides a more traditional, darker colored cookie as well as slightly better flavor.  (I doubled the spices and used dark brown sugar as well.)  The version with vanilla pudding came out lighter, as in the picture provided, but has the same texture.  As mentioned in other reviews, the cookies need at least 1" apart spacing, as they puff a bit during baking, but do not spread, maintaining their shape.

This recipe is everything you said it would be. Easiest gingerbread people I have made in 35 years. The dough is simple to make, easy to roll and cookies delicious and soft. I cooked mine on a parchment paper covered pan for 8 min. They are mild tasting and my family, including myself, love them. It's a keeper. Thanks Kim

Making these cookies is now a family tradition!  They are so good that I have to make them more often than just the holidays.  Now I cut them in the shape of footballs and decorate with icing "laces" for our Superbowl parties.

Wonderful taste and very simple recipe to follow.  I find it important to note that if you roll them to thin, they will burn black.  Also, I only bake mine for 9 minutes at 350 degrees, as they burn easily.  Too much flour when you roll them out will also cause the later cookies to be a little brittle.

I made my own gingerbread challenge. This one was good, but not as good as a more traditional molasses recipe. The batter did not smell gingerbread-y, but tasted pretty good when cooked. Over a couple days though these weren't as good as a traditional recipe. Didn't really save any time or work in the kitchen as opposed to traditional either.

Incredible!  I liked the flavor of these more than I like gingerbread made with molasses.  The dough got difficult to work with as it sat out, so I had to put in the freezer briefly for a second chilling cycle.  When cool and firm, though, the dough was very easy to work with and the cookies lifted easily from the cutting board.  This is a great addition to my family's annual Christmas cookie line-up!

This recipe is a nice addition to my Christmas cookie list. I should have doubled the batch, but plan to make more. Should be a lot of fun to decorate. I couldn't keep my 4-year-old from eating them!Yummy.

I usually make Eileen's Spicy Gingerbread but I hate the smell of molasses so decided to try this. The flavour was very mild so I doubled the spices and added 1 tsp of vanilla. After chilling for 4 hours the dough was still very soft and I had to add quite a bit of flour to get this rolled out and cut. I used Walmart butter that may be the issue I usually use Lactancia. Got 48 thin gingerbread men, baked in 7 minutes on silpat lined sheets. May try this again with the spice mixture from Eileen's recipe and another butter brand.

my son wanted Gingerbread men cookies over the holidays.  I never cook with molasses and didn't want to buy some just for one recipe.  So when I saw this one with out molasses, I figured I would give it a try.  My kids and I found it very easy to follow and mix.  The flavor turned out great, the cookies were crisp - perfect for decorating later.  Thank you for sharing.

I absolutely LOVED these cookies, and so did everyone who tried them! I swapped the amounts of cinnamon and ginger, however, and I reduced the baking time to about 7 minutes.  This made the cookies pleasantly soft while eating but sturdy enough to hold the cutouts in your hand without them falling apart.  I made them for a cookie exchange at work and holiday parties at home, and they were a total hit! Thanks a bunch!

I have made many gingerbread cookies, all with molasses, which is the best way to get that true gingerbread flavor. I was traveling out of town, so didn't have my recipes with me & found this one on the internet, but I was extremely disappointed with the taste, as it is basically just a plain tasting cookie, nothing special, and not what I was expecting.  I would not recommend this recipe, if you are looking for a true, old-fashioned gingerbread man recipe.

Made this last season and again this season. Last season I followed the recipe exactly with excellent results. The dough is VERY easy to work with but only made about 20, 2 1/2 inch cookies. This time I added a pinch of ground cloves and a tsp. vanilla. I also rolled the dough out a bit thicker. Still a very yummy cookie! Not very spicy nor too sweet.

Easy to make, taste great.  The cookie dough seems dry at first, just keep using that stand mixer and it will form.  I only baked them for 8 minutes and that was perfect.  The taste is quite mild (perfect for the 2-3 year old classroom) - not too much ginger and not to sweet.  Rolling the dough slightly thicker made for a softer cookie, thinner dough resulted in a crunchy cookie.  They are a hit with the kids and easy for mom to make.  I will make again and double the recipe.  I saw gingerbread flavor pudding mix, I'm going to try that.

I like the taste of the recipe, but had a hard time with the dough.  Even after an hour in the fridge, it was still soft.  I split it into 4ths and put in freezer.  I left the others in the freezer while I worked with it a section at a time.  I could not get them off of my silpat, so I rolled out on there, cut them and left them there to bake.  Even after 2 roll outs, the dough was sticky.  When I made this recipe, it only yielded 20 cookies.  I needed 30 for my son's class and didn't buy anymore butterscotch pudding, so I guess we will have to just eat them and I will make them something else.

This was the easiest cookie ever! I cut the butter into little cubes and mixed it with the dry ingredients with my fingers- worked great! They tasted fantastic- love the butterscotch flavour. Watch the baking time though, my first batch of little guys were a bit overdone. Didn't stop my family from inhaling them though!! This one is going in the recipe box for next year!!

We have been making these during the holidays for years.  They are one of the few cookies I can't stop eating!  Sometimes we just cut simple circles and one year, in a pinch, I used vanilla pudding.  Still good!

Such an easy way to make gingerbread men!  I normally try to stay away from any type of cut out cookie but these were easy to make and easy to cut out.  Excellent!

I'm not a huge fan of molasses, and couldn't imagine what the butterscotch pudding mix would taste like so had to try this.  I agree with the other reviewers that if you want a traditional gingerbread cookie, you should probably try another recipe.  If you're looking for a mild recipe that would suit kids, give this a chance. It's an easy recipe, great for cutting out cookies and taste great!  Next time I'll at least double the ginger and cinnamon.

These are so good!  They are easy to prepare, great for kids to help, produce nice cutout cookies and the flavour and texture are wonderul.  I've made these with my son and he packaged up indivdiual cookies, with candy decorations and small tubes of icing to give to his friends as gifts.

I didn't like the crunchiness of these at first but after letting them sit for a day they were softer and delicious.  The butterscotch gave it a nice flavor.  Gingerbread isn't my favorite cookie but these made me want more.  My boyfriend took them to work and got rave reviews from his colleagues. I decorated mine with homemade icing and cinnamon dots for buttons and followed the recipe exactly.

After reading the other reviews, I decided to melt the butter first.  I also used instant butterscotch pudding.  I had to leave it in the fridge for 2 hours instead of 1 because of the softness.  But these turned out EXCELLENT!  Very soft and perfect.

I get rave reviews on this, I have made it several times, and I have tried both  the instant and the cook and serve, they both work. I find they turn out slightly chewier with the cook and serve, but turn out delicious both ways. Very easy!!

I used this recipe to make a gingerbread house, and the recipe makes EXACTLY enough dough for one house! It's easy to work with, tastes great, and is already stiff enough to turn into a house the same night, unlike other gingerbread cookie recipes that require you to let cookies sit out overnight to harden. I give it a BIG thumbs up! I made it with all organic ingredients (including organic pudding mix) and wheat flour, it is superb! I did not have a whole teaspoon of cinnamon, so I was a little short on it, but it still has a nice flavor. I did add 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla and 1/4 a teaspoon of ground nutmeg.

This is the perfect recipe for anyone who finds that traditional gingerbread cookies can be too spicy.  The only change I made was that I used 1 cup of butter.  The dough was perfect for rolling.  Such an easy recipe.  I will use it every year.  My son loves this recipe.  If you need a recipe for kids
-this is it!

Very good.  I did add clove and nutmeg to make it a bit spicier.  The texture of these cookies is different than a traditional gingerbread cookie made with molasses.  I cooked for 7-8 minutes, and mine came out very light and crisp, like a ginger snap. They are GREAT with coffee.  I will definately make again, but increase the spices even more.

This recipe is AWESOME!!  All of my kids loved it (they normally dont like gingerbread cookies cause of the molasses in them).  Very easy to make.  I didn't change the recipe however I may try adding more ginger and cinnamon on my next batch as someone suggested for a little more spicy taste.  I also wanted to mention that one person said the dough wasnt the right consistency and was too dry... thats because AFTER a couple minutes of serious mixing the right consistency started to appear!!  This is a where a stand mixer is your best friend!!  I also wanted to add the batch I baked only made a dozen cookies.  I know my dough rolled out decently thin but not too thick so if you want alot more cookies double your batch!!  Thanks so much for the recipe I will be using it from now on.

Very nice recipe. I found it kind of difficult, but I would say I am a beginner, not Betty Crocker. Just make sure you have the patience to cut out cookies (I thought I did) and keep adding flour too. Also, be sure to keep your eyes on them, Don't Overcook them! Other wise, good recipe if you know what you're doing.

Very soft and tasty and easy to make.  I loved these cookies.  The butterscotch is a nice subtle flavoring, and keeps the cookie from getting too 'crispy'.  (I'm partial to the softer, chewier cookies).  This is definitely my new standard yearly gingerbread men recipe.

This recipe is awesome!  I used it for a christmas tree I make every year and it came out great.  The consistency of the dough was very easy to work with and the taste was marvelous.  I did need to use "Instant" Butterscotch Pudding and it worked really well.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!!

Loved these cookies!  Even my kids (9 & 13) who hate traditional Gingerbread cookies, loved this variation.  We used mini-m&m's for buttons and they turned out so cute.  Perfect texture, too; a little crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  YUM!!

These cookies came out very well!  Unlike ordinary gingerbread cookies, which are hard and crunchy, these turn out light, crisp, and airy, with a lovely, different flavor!  My husband, who is not particularly fond of gingerbread in any form, was very keen on these cookies and went back for more several times.  This recipe is in my "recipe box" for good now!

I will never make gingerbread men any other way.  I made this for my daughter's 1st grade class.  I made 30 4" cookies, and I found I needed to doubvle the recipe for that number.  We served them with a applesauce at snack time.  A big hit!  We also decorated them with Hershey's chocolate candies in green, white and red for buttons, eyes and nose and made an indentation for the mouth.

I made the dough and left it for my four kids (10, 5, 3, and 2 years old) to make with the babysitter while my husband and I went out with friends. There wasn't much left for us when we returned home! Everyone loved them. I'll agree that they aren't a "true" gingerbread recipe, but that's been established already. They tasted pretty darned close - just a milder, lighter version. Will definitely make again - a keeper!

These turned out great! I actually pressed the dough into a mini-men silicone mold sheet (think ~30 inch-tall cookies about 3/4" thick) and they were SO moist! No one could tell this was a non-traditional recipe either

My son was begging me to make gingerbread cookies with him (he has tried pepperidge farm gingerbread cookies and liked them) but I didn't want to cook something too spicy and him not eat them.

These are the perfect cross between gingerbread and sugar.  Super easy to make.  My only complaint about cookies like the chilling/rolling/cutting/re-chilling leftover pieces/recutting/rechilling...... process.  I'm covered in flour by the end of it all.

I cooked mine for 7 minutes.  I did roll the dough out thin but didn't measure.  They're about 1/8 inch.  I also doubled the batch and used a small cookie cutter to make sure I had enough because they're going quick and we haven't even frosted them yet!!

This is a really great tasting cookie. I didn't change anything with the recipe and it came out fine. My dough wasn't dry as others reported . HOWEVER, I must say that if you are looking for a traditional tasting gingerbread cookie then this is not the recipe for you. This one is really meant for kids in my opinion because you simply can't taste the spices in the cookie. Younger children will appreciate this. So four stars for taste but one star deducted because it doesn't taste like gingerbread so another name should be allocated

First off, I doubled the recipe and contrary to some posts had no problem mixing the dough. I will say that I always cream the butter/sugar extremely well in any recipe and find that key to good dough.  Giving it a 5 star with making some changes always makes me feel guilty, however the only changes I made was to the spices. I added more ginger, cinnamon and added cloves, this is a matte of personal taste and shouldn't detract from a rating.

Now let me say...OMG!! This dough is marvelous, one of the smoothest and easiest I have ever experienced. I chose to do all Gingerbread men, half large and half small. They rose to perfection, though I will caution, really watch your baking times, I reduced mine significantly. I always bake for half the time and rotate pans as I don't have a convection oven. The first batch always tells the time tale....so be cautious. I always bake on parchment.

I adore these cookies, the taste is wonderful, and I adore working with the dough! You won't be sorry giving this a try.

I make traditional molasses Gingerbread men for my daughter using Splenda, and they come out great...but this is going to be my go to recipe for the little guys using sugar! Great Recipe Kim!

I love this recipe but I was concerned about the ingredient proportions so being the scientist I am I made 6 very small batches varying amount of baking soda ginger and cinnamon. Because I was looking for a recipe that tasted very close to the gingerbread that I was used to I found that doubling the ginger and cinnamon had the best result and if you would prefer more spice in your cookie it still leaves a lot of room to change the recipe to fit your personal preference. on another note depending of if you are looking for a softer (more bread like) cookie I would suggest changing the cook time to 8 min and the thickness closer to 1/4 in.

Please be aware:  DOUBLE batch only resulted in 39- 3" cookies!

I also made a single batch with instant pudding and it turned out great.  

These are really delicious!

I did not have butterscotch pudding and substituted lemon instant pudding and added some pumpkin pie spice to offset the lemon. The taste was great.

Awesome for the kidos! I used the instant pudding as well and it turned out great.  Easy to roll out and not too sticky for little hands.  They also hold true to cutter size so ou can use ones with little details! The kids loved them and my parents and sister said they were a pretty tasty cookie as well.

Loved how easy these were to make and how delicious they were.  Great roll out recipe.  I made them to make in my daughter's preschool.  Made 4 batches the night before and refrigerated.  Came out fantastic.  They do grow quite a bit unlike real gingerbread, but I am not a huge fan of molasses, these were fantastic.  Got many many comments from the other parents about how good they were.

I used this recipe to make gingerbread men cookies with my 23 kindergartners. It was very easy to mix (they did the mixing). It rolled out easily and baked beautifully. The kids loved them. Everyone liked them. That's a rarity with a class of kindergartners. I would really give this 4 1/2 stars. I like a cut out cookie to get a tad bit firmer, but maybe I would try baking a minute or two longer. The flavor was great! I loved that I didn't have to buy molasses.

My boys really wanted to make real gingerbread cookies this year.  I decided on this recipe because it seemed like it was a milder version of a traditional gingerbread that would be made with molasses.  They were so good.....gingerbready enough that even someone who is not a fan of gingerbread would like them.  I followed the directions exactly.....except I always bake less then what is suggested.  I took them out around 8 minutes.  Also, I only got 12 cookies so if I made them smaller and got as many as the recipe states, I would probably take them out at 7 minutes or so.  Very Tasty!

These are so good! I doubled the recipe and would say I got about 30 - so definitely make more dough. Easy to roll - not sure why so many had a hard time with it. I piped on frosting that I found in the reviews. Yummy.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was my first time ever making gingerbread cookies and I'm glad I chose this recipe! They aren't hard and crunchy like other gingerbread cookies I've tried. I slightly altered the cooking time to 8 1/2 minutes and they were perfect!

This is the second year I used this recipe.  It's been a huge success both times.   My daughter helped me today and neither of us wanted to wait an hour for the dough to chill.  I rolled and cut the dough unchilled (use plenty of flour) and they turned out great.  No problem with sticking. I stress the "use plenty of flour" part.  I can see how they could be a colossal mess if you didn't. These cookies are delicious just as written. I will go to this recipe year after year.

AMAZING!!! My kids and my neighbours kids all gathered around the table to help make these awesome cookies they loved em and so did I! I also used the instant pudding mix, i was a little worried because the dough seemed dry at first but i just kept kneading it with my hands and eventually it all came together perfectly. I did add one teaspoon of ground cloves just for a little extra spice, and they turned out absoulutely great!!! Thankyou so much for this wonderful recipie!!!

Easiest cutout cookie recipe. I followed exactly, except, I added 1 1/2 teaspoon of ground cloves and 1 teaspoon ground nutmeg and you really don't need to refrigerate the dough that long. I refrigerated for like 10 minutes at the most and it is still so easy to roll out. They are kinda hard to move tho once you cut them out, so I usually just cut them out right on the parchment paper and move that to the cookie sheet. I bake for 8 minutes and they are perfect. Everyone loves them

These are great! The whole family was impressed. I did add a 1/4tsp of cloves to give them a little more spice like someone suggested. But Yumm!!

My first little army of gingerbread men! I loved this recipe! I had a little trouble with the dough sticking when i tried to roll it out, but i was advised to put the dough between two layers of wax paper, and it worked perfectly! I'm so excited to add gingerbread to my baking portfolio!

Awesome cookies! I've been making this one for years, and it's a Christmas cookie staple. I would take others suggestions and reducing the baking time by a minute or two.

The first comment below had me worried, saying that there wasn't going to be enough liquid in the recipe, however I tried anyway and the results were great.  I'm having a gingerbread city building project so I tripled the recipe and it just came out to be a normal amount of dough!  I'd recommend doubling the recipe if you need to have the 30 servings listed here.

This is the best Gingerbread recipe I have tasted! It was not strong flavored, I do not like Molasses so this was ideal! Even my husband loved them, who is very picky. Brought them to work and they dissappeared quickly. Was asked to bring more!

Awesome recipe. Super easy and very tasy. The dough is really asy to roll out though it gets a little sticky so make sure you put down enough flour. This is more of a soft gingerbread recipe thus not to be used for house making or if you are into the hard crunch.

After reading the reviews I used Jello instant butterscotch pudding mix. The store only had the SUGAR FREE variety. That did NOT make a difference at all. The dough was perfect to work with. I rolled out to about 1/4" thick and baked for 12 minutes. One batch made 5 larger cookies and 10 smaller ones. They were perfect. I made these as a test batch in anticipation of using the recipe for punch & cookies time after our Christmas Eve church service. I will definitely be making at least a double, maybe even a triple batch. You can't go wrong with this recipe. NOTE: If you are looking for a more traditional spicy gingerbread cookie you might want to look elsewhere. These cookies have a light gingerbread taste, perfect for children - and me!

BEST. GINGERBREAD COOKIE. EVER!  i wanted to make gingerbread cookies on a whim one night, but didnt have molasses. i DID however have a box of butterscotch pudding mix in my cabinet. these were wonderful! followed the recipe exactly, except i added 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg and 1 tsp vanilla extract. I didnt have any cookie cutters, so i formed them into balls and used a fork to texture the tops once they came out of the oven. I then sprinkled a bit of powdered sugar on top. I had about 7 or 8 friends that tried these, and everyone gave them rave reviews!

I'm not entirely happy with this recipe. I got everything blended, but no matter what the dough was a bit dry. It rolled out alright though, it didn't crumble too much, but the end result was disappointing. It tastes good, but the texture is a bit dry. It's not so dry it's inedible, but it could definitely be better. I think the icing will redeem these cookies a good bit, though. Next time I want something like this, I'll modify the recipe a bit. It's a great recipe, I just feel like it's a little too dry.

Excellent cookie! This has a very mild ginger taste that is simply wonderful. I am not a big fan of the super spicy, molasses gingerbread and neither is my family. This is perfect to go along with all our other Christmas baking that we pass around to family, friends, and neighbors during the holidays. They are very easy to make. I roll mine out on parchment paper to avoid any extra flour and also bake them on the paper. Everyone loves them and the children have a great time decorating them.

Loved this recipe. I made it with the kids as cut-out gingerbread men. We made 4 large men and 12 smaller men. I would double the recipe next year. Then made them into balls and flatened them out. Drizzled with white icing. Came out great. Made about 30 cookies. Also used pumpkin pie pudding first time and butterscotch pudding the next. I liked the pumkin pie pudding better. I could not find pumpkin pie in stores after Christmas. This is my new gingerbread cookie recipe. Thanks for sharing.

My sister and I made this gingerbread men. They are easy to roll out if you get the dough really cold. I would make them a little thicker next time, as they were a bit too crispy. Fun to decorate! Will make this a holiday tradition.

These are FANTASTIC! I love the fact I didn't need molasses. I HATE the smell and texture of it. Last time I made gingerbred men I was actually gagging from the molasses, so I nver made them again. These cookies taste wonderful and were so easy to make. I reccommend adding a small dash of ground cloves to give it a more authentic gingerbread taste, and you may want to double the recipe. You don't get very many men out of the recipe provided. At first I encountered the problem of it being too dry. I couldn't mix the dough properly but I adsed a splash of water and the dough came out perfect. I gave holiday cookies out this year as gifts to co-workers and friends, and every single person commented on how great the gingerbread men were! Thanks for a fantastic recipe!

These cookies were freakin awesome.  People who don't like gingerbread, love these cookies.  They are soft and so yummy.  For the reviewer who is worried about the lack of 'liquid' in the recipe, it turns out great just how it is!

Not as potent as the typical gingerbread cookie containing molasses.  Simple enough to let my nieces mix this together as I "help" them.  Going to try it with chocolate pudding and see what I get. Keep the baking time to 8 minutes for the perfect cookie.  Also sprinkle some cinammon sugar mix onto them before baking to forgo frosting ;)

I was surprised how well these turned out with such little ingredients!  Very yummy.  We used them for a gingerbread man birthday party.  All the kids loved them and the parents asked for the recipe.  No problems with the recipe at all.

I hate when people do this, but I did change the recipe, but only a little bit!!  I added 1 tsp of vanilla, 1 tsp of ground cloves, and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  I was worried after I read a reviewer say they were "just a brown cookie."  I found this recipe with my small additions to be very good.  Not overly spicey, easily chewed, and perfect for children.  My son loved these (and the dough too, unfortunately!).  I iced them with some powdered sugar, butter, and milk.  Very nice for holiday plates.

This is a great mild gingerbread cookie. I made a few revisions, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars: add tsp vanilla, used 2 tsp of ginger, added a sprinkle of cloves and nutmeg for just a little more spice to bring out the ginger flavor. Also, I used vanilla instant pudding mix instead of butterscotch. These turned out wonderful. The dough was a little light and cracked right out of the fridge, but once you start working with it, it gets darker at room temperature and sticks together very well.

What a nice mild ginger cookie.  My 6 yr old son loves them.  Mine turned out thin and crispy.  We like them just the way they are and didn't decorate them. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is b/c the dough was a little tricky to work with.  It kept cracking apart when I rolled it out.  I put the dough in the fridge overnight so maybe that caused it to become a little dry and hard to work w/.  Next time I'll make the cookies the same day as the dough and maybe it will roll out better.  Six to eight minutes is all it takes to bake these.

The cookie dough was fairly easy to handle and cookies turned out just fine.
I baked them for 5~6mins and it turned out nice and soft and chewy in the middle.(I almost burnt my first batch by baking them for 8minuates.ioi)

My kids LOVED these!! We followed the recipe exactly and froze in freezer for 20 mins and rolled between parchment paper. 
Didn't find the dough to be sticky at all. 
Baked for 9 minutes for a softer chewy cookie. 
8 thumbs up (from 4 kids)

These are the BEST gingerbread men I have ever tasted! I used the butterscotch pudding and it was amazing. To the readers that have trouble mixing it: just keep mixing. Eventually it will become the right consistency. There is no need to add additional liquid. These cookies have secured their place on my Christmas cookies list! I also used M&M minis for the eyes and red hots for the buttons, and they made my cookies adorable but didn't take away from the gingerbread flavor. Thanks for sharing!

Eh.  I wasn't crazy about the flavor of these.  They looked cute, but I probably won't make these again.

Very easy to make and dough rolls out nicely. Just did not care for the taste. For me the pudding mix gives it an off taste. It is a much milder gingerbread that I think would be liked by kids. Thanks for sharing Kim.

I can't say enough about this recipe.  I've made it three times now and each time it's a HUGE hit.  Usually gingerbread men look beautiful but the taste leave something to be desired.
These are easy to make, easy to roll out, bake wonderfully, and taste incredible.

This was the best, easiest, tastiest roll out cookie recipe I have ever made.  Loved it and now I want to experiment with different pudding mixes and flavors.   I did make the dough the day before rolling.  It turned out flawlessly.  Thanks!

This recipe was wonderful! Super easy, and such a great flavor to them. My daughter and I had a great time making these yummyholiday treat! Pointer, I baked them at 300 for the 12 minutes and they came out  a little softer!

I really hesitated on trying this recipe....but gave it a try and OMG I'm SO glad I did!!! ! SUPER SUPER easy!!! and taste so good!! It is definitely not as spicy as typical gingerbread men...but perfect for the kids and anyone wanting a mild spice. I can not express how super easy this dough is! Thanks so much for the recipe!! ....I use dit as is except used dark brown sugar to make sure I had the gingerbread look.

Yummy. I used vanilla pudding instead of butterscotch (it's all i had!) and added 1/8 t allspice and 1/4 t nutmeg. added the pudding mix dry and creamed butter and sugar with it - the mix starts a little dry and crumby, but once you squish it all together it feels more like a cookie dough. the dough was a little hard to work with right out of the fridge, but got easier as it warmed up. these are a lot less gingerbready than 'real' gingerbread cookies, but are super yummy in their own right.

Though these were tasty, these are more of a sugar cookie shaped like gingerbread men. Also the dough was so dry I ended up adding another egg just so that they wouldn't fall apart, when rolling and cutting-also had to use my hands to press together. I am surprised more comments have not been mentioned on the crumbliness of this dough.

When you cut out your cookies they should be on your cookie sheet. Just peel the dough off of the sheet and the cookies will be perfectly shaped.  Also, chilling the dough overnight really helps with the texture and ease of rolling.

I don't know what made me do it, but I used  freshly ground ginger root instead of powdered ginger. I had to increase the amount up to about 3.5 tsp, but the cookies turned out great! The fresh ginger gave these a really amazing, sweet flavor that's worth the hassle. On a whim I also tossed in a teaspoon of Crown Royal and a teaspoon of vanilla extract, which actually really brought out the ginger flavor even more.

Complete yumminess!  My dough was still sticky when I rolled it out so I used a lot more flour.  We made 8 inich gingerbread men--rolling them thinner than 1/8 inch.  I will keep this recipe for a very long time.  Mild flavor, the kids would sneak one whenever they could and both of us non spicy gingerbread eaters loved them!

These cookies taste delicious!...I did have trouble with my cookie cutter for some reason..it was way too large and these cookies bake up "big".  So I improvised..I used a small mushroom can to cut out circles..unused dough I kept in the fridge since it tends to get sticky when warm..when a batch was done baking I cooled on the sheet..much easier since they are a soft cookie.  Since these were meant to be a Thankgiving Thank You gift I cut out a template of a circle with a turkey cut out in the center and placed over each cookie then dusted with confectioners sugar.  They turned out very pretty..nice and round..soft and chewy..and the flavor..way better than regular gingerbread since I am not a molasses fan.  Thank you so much for submitting this recipe...I enjoyed.

These were really delicious!  I used instant pudding mix (vanilla, because that's all I had) and also added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg  and 1/8 tsp. allspice.  My children loved them! If I underbaked them very slightly, they were soft after cooling and if I left them until lightly browned around the edges, they were crunchy and my kids said they liked both ways!  I also used dark brown sugar and that gave them a molasses flavor and deep brown color.  I also had a little difficulty rolling it at first, but after the dough warmed up a bit, it was much easier. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is one of the most delicious cookie recipes I've ever had.  My husband and children can't get enough of these cookies, and people are always asking for the recipe.  I always double this recipe, because with my cookie cutters the one batch of dough only yields approximately 2 dozen cookies.  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

This is the best Gingerbread men recipe for kids.  It has the great ginger taste, but is not so spicy that the kids tire of them.  These have been a huge hit on sweets table at the holiday fair and for my son's December birthday!

These were so easy to make, and they looked & tasted great. Don't let the butterscotch pudding scare you! The fact that you do not need molasses or a dozen different spices is a definite plus. Thanks to this recipe, my son & I will continue to make gingerbread men!

I made these last night!  While initially skeptical about the butterscotch pudding, can I just say "WOW!"  The finished product looks and tastes like it came from a bakery!  They were really easy to make, and not too gingerbread-y.  Hubby doesn't like ginger or gingerbread men, but he ate handfuls of these.  I used the mini Wilton christmas cutters to make them bite-size.  They are crispy and light.  I wanted cakey, but these were a very nice surprise.  Next time I will either sprinkle colored sugar on them before baking, or drizzle with colored Wilton candy melts...I will definitely use this recipe often!  Thanks!!!

These were perfect!  They turned out to be perfectly chewy, and tasted great! I found that if you floured your hands and surface well enough, you shouldn't need to add more flour to the recipe, doing so makes the cookie a little more tough.  Good Recipe!

Great recipe!

Best Gingerbread Men cookies we ever had!  Soft and tasty!

I have made it today with help of my 3 girls, age 6,5, and 3.5.

They colored it with Edible Color Marker and everybody had a good time and learned something.

These were very easy and tasty cookies. They had their own unique gingerbread taste and kids love them. Do watch the cooking time since they don't brown much when cooked.  I've been baking these during the holidays for 2 years and enjoy them over other gingerbread cookies.

Best gngerbread cookies EVER!!!  Baked it for about 6 minutes...result: CHEWY!  Added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 3/4 tsp cloves.  Next time will add a little more ginger.  Must double recipe otherwise cookies will vanish in no time!  The thicker the gingerbred men are, the chewier they'll be.  Roll out dough so that it's about 1/4 inch in thickness before punching out gingerbreaad men.  Didn't decorate cookies, but used a fork to poke buttons on the gingerbread men as they came marching out of the oven.

These were delicious but not exactly what I expected.  If you like the flavor that molasses imparts to gingerbread, you'll be missing it!  Other than that, these had a nice texture (crisp on the outside, a bit soft on the inside) and were easy to roll out.  I shaped them into pumpkins for Halloween.  They reminded me of the flavor of a windmill cookie--an excellent spice cookie, just different from my expectations.

This is an extremely simple and delicious recipe for gingerbread! I made them last night and my fiance loves them. However, the dough was very dry (this could have to do with the dry Arizona weather), so I had to add another egg. But, it turned out fantastic and I will definitely make it every Christmas.

This is the first time I have made gingerbread cookies.  I made these with my 3 year old daughter and they were delicious.  The dough was easy to work with and everyone who tasted them loved them!!  We will definitely be making these again!

These cookies were wonderful! And they made my whole house smell good. I had never tried Gingerbread Cookies before but after tasting I wont have to try another recipe. My kids loved them. We decorated with red frosting for the mouth and buttons and chocolate chips for the eyes.

These are a good, mild gingerbread flavor that most people will enjoy; however, I found the dough a bit dry and difficult to roll, as it kept cracking.  My "ninjabread men" look and smell quite tasty, and the dough kept disappearing into my mouth while I was working.  Thanks!

I really liked these cookies, very mild flavor, easy dough to work with.  The second time I made this recipe, I used chocolate pudding because my toddler grandson was visiting and I was afraid the traditional gingerbread flavors might be a problem for him.  They turned out very good, both ways!

I tried this recipe because it looked simple and reviews said that it was good for kids. It did end up being on the dry side after following the directions, so I added just a tablespoon or two of molasses and it turned out wonderfully! It was easy to roll out, baked beautifully and tasted great!

I think I did something wrong cause it comes out very dry, add the milk to the pudding or what? I later added the milk and they came out like cake like.

This is the best cookie dough I have ever worked with. I did not have any problem with it being too dry; I attribute this to using butter that has been left out overnight. These cookies are firm but stay chewy and soft after baking and are perfect for decorating. The recipe is fantastic as-is, and also makes a fabulous base for any flavor of rolled cookie.
 You can use vanilla pudding mix, swap white sugar for the brown and nix the spices for a standard sugar cookie dough that will not get too sticky while rolling out.
 If I'm making spice cookies, I substitute nutmeg for the ginger and add a 1/4 tsp. of ground cloves. 
 As others have pointed out, you can save yourself lots of frustration by rolling & cutting your dough on a sheet of parchment paper. Peel away the scraps between cookies and slap the whole sheet onto your pan for super easy and even baking.

The cookies turned out great!  But why aren't there any instructions or a recipe to decorate like a reindeer? I can only guess how to make brown royal icing.

This is a great recipe. I actually doubled all the ingredients except for the pudding (forgot to buy 2) and it came out just as well. The cookies are firm but soft enough, and when I store them in boxes with a slice of bread it makes them even softer the next day. After I took the batter out of the fridge to start rolling, I did use a fair amount of flour to keep it from sticking to my rolling pin. Also a cookie cutter should be listed with the ingredients ;) I started it and realized I never purchased one, so I ended up hand-carving all the cookies with an X-acto knife. Got lots of creative shapes, plus the head shapes of all my pets. =) Also only needed 10 minutes tops in the oven or it would have gotten too hard/overcooked.

So easy and most of all delicious.  I made the dough in advance and rolled it between wax paper and froze it.  When my angel grandchildren come over all we have to do is cut out and bake!  Thank you for the best gingerbread.  The pudding gives it a mild taste and not overwhelming like it is when mollases is used!  This is our favorite!

LOVE this recipe! I followed the directions exactly and these came out great. My husband isn't a huge fan of the overwhelmingly spicy ginger cookies and these were a little more mild but still had that ginger flavor. The dough came out perfect, I seem to have a lot of problems making cookie dough workable, but not this time! I hand decorated them with homeade Royal icing. Delicious and fun!

I made Halloween cutout cookies using this recipe.  The dough is easy to work with.  I'm no expert at rolling so it must be easy. The butterscotch manages to make the cookies taste like gingerbread.  I would make these again.  Thank you Kim for sharing your recipe.

These whip up fast, but are only okay, meaning I would eat them, but they're not amazing or anything like that. There is a very slight spice to them, I would have preferred a drop more spice. To the reviewer who wondered about more  liquid in the recipe, the recipe seems very dry at first, but if you keep mixing (I made it in a kitchen aid) the dough does come together. As other reviewers mentioned you don't get much dough out of this recipe. Also, I used instant pudding.

Made these for the dessert table at my grandson's 5th birthday party yesterday.  The dough was a little sticky to roll out--a little more flour, incorporated into the dough, may have helped.  The yummy, mild flavor was great for a crowd that included seniors who don't care for a lot of spice in their food.  I got complements!

I made this and was so pleased with the result! Easy to make, works exactly as recipe promises. The taste was delicious, a nice flavor without being too much spice. I will make these many many times. I could not find my gingerbread man cookie cutter so improvised and made cookies.  Photo attached.I will make them this way next time too.

These were absolutely delicious gingerbread cookies.  I couldn't tell there was butterscotch in these, but they had a perfect texture: crispy outsides, soft insides.  This is a small recipe though, so unless you were planning on halving a normal recipe, double this one.

These were great!  I did substitute margarine because that's all I had.  Make sure and chill dough thoroughly because it is very sticky, I chilled mine overnight. they package very well and are not too fragile.  Not too gngery either and you can not taste the butterscotch, if you like ginger you may want to add an additional tsp but otherwise a great cookie.  Thanks for sharing!!

My granddaughter had so  much fun making these & wouldd never have loved eating them just as much if they were actual gingerbread cookies! The flavor is a hint of spiciness/gingerbread, although I added just 1/8 teaspoon each of allspice & nutmeg & used dark brown sugar to sorta make up for the lack of molasses. The dough was so soft that I had to keep taking breaks, putting it back in the freezer to cchill the start over again, but watching my granddaghter have so much fun rolling, cutting & decorating cookies she actually enjoyed eating when she was done was well worth the effort!

These are amazing!  I did not use cookie cutters, just rolled the cookies into small balls and flattened them with the palm of my hand.  I did take the advice of others and increased the amount of ginger and cinnamon and they were a hit!  Thenext time I make these, I will try using sugar free pudding mix, Splenda brown sugar, and whole wheat flour!

These are SO good!  We used instant pudding and dark brown sugar and followed the recipe amounts of ginger.  They're not too gingery (but that's a plus in our house)!  I'm addicted!  We're adding a new cookie to our annual lineup!

I LOVE this recipe! I am a preschool teacher so time, quality, and quantity is a big deal in my busy life; my children are ruthless when it comes to judgement and they didn't have one bad thing to say about these tasty little men! I did not use Cook and Serve Pudding Mix, I used Instant Pudding Mix and it was great..The gingerbread men are delicious, easy to make, and hold their shape!! Please try this recipe - you will not regret it!

I made 2 batches, following the directions exactly, one with instant pudding and one with cook and serve type.  Both turned out awesome, held their shape and were delicious.  Easy to make and easy to roll out.  I took one batch to a school choir concert.  They were gone in minutes.  I will definitely make these again and can see these becoming a tradition for the holidays with my family.

Question: I also don't care for molasses, however I'm even less of a fan of butterscotch. Any 3rd alternatives someone could recommend would be appreciated!

Taste like pogens! Been looking for a recipe like this for years. Accidentally bought instant pudding, but saw that someone used it anyway, so I tried it.  Worked! Next time I will try the cook and serve, but either way this recipe is a winner.

Excellent for KIDS!  We did this with a 3 and 5 year old with good success.  I had divided the dough into three sections and wrapped individually and chilled overnight.  They warmed up quickly and kids rolled their own on parchment paper.  They tore away the excess dough and used a spatula to put them on the cookie sheet.  We made smaller sized cookies (4 inch and 2 inch) and baked them at 400 for 6 minutes.  The thickness and size must be considered for baking time.  Kids decorated by dipping candies in frosting and sticking to the cookies.  Quite a successful project!

If it was based on my own personal taste I would rate this three stars, but my fiance loved them! They taste more like a sugar cookie to me then gingerbread but they are easy to make!

Just made these cookies!!!!  They were very good.  I'm not a gingerbread cookie fan but when my 4 year son requested that I make some...I found this recipe and it didn't disappoint.  My son has eaten 4 so far tonight.  I followed the recipe directly as written.  The only thing I did differently was bake them for 8-9 minutes and I used instant butterscotch pudding.  Very good cookie...will definitely make them again!

You might have to add a little water to get the dough to stick together. But otherwise DELISH! As other reviewers have said, it's more of a sugar cookie/gingerbread combo.

This was probably one of the easiest rolled cookie recipes I've ever used.  The dough was the perfect consistency.  They cooked well and were a hit.  They didn't make as many servings as the recipe says, however.

Easy recipe I did have problems with the dough being very dry and crumbling after chilling - in desperation i added 2 Tbsp of cold water and worked it into the dough. I used alot of flour, but they turned out fantastic and they smelled great while cooking. I also reduced the cooking time to 9 minutes and found them to be perfect.

I never liked gingerbread until I found this recipe.  Unlike most gingerbread, this one stays soft.  The dough was perfect, and the cookies baked up perfectly.  Will definitely be my go-to recipe for gingerbread - THANKS!

These cookies are pretty good! I only had 1oz of butterscotch (and it was instant) so I used that and then vanilla pudding. It worked fine! The batter was very crumbly and dry..which I was worried about, but it ended up cooking just fine. Mine didn't really puff up at all while cooking which is good. Used an Icing to decorate like Gingy :) also made little xmas trees. I only gave 4 stars cause the cooking time was way off. Only bake for about 8 minutes otherwise you will have fried little men.

Great recipe for kids.  The ginger taste is very mild - there is no burn after your bite if you know what I mean.  Personally my kids do not like traditional gingerbread at all because of how strong it is.  The thing I like best is that the dough is super easy to roll out and easy enoug to work with that kids can help.  My son asks for these every Christmas.

I love this recipe!  I was intrigued by the butterscotch pudding, as well as the idea of a milder gingerbread.  I was worried it wouldn't have the bite I like, but it was perfect!  This will definitely be a go-to recipe for me for the holiday season!

I used a 3 1/2" tall by 3" wide Wilton cookie cutter and I did get 32 cookies out of one batch.   They were crispy and you could taste the ginger although mild so that if you don't like a strong molasses flavor you should enjoy these.  I tried rolling them out between sheets of waxed paper after I chilled them for an hour but that didn't work too well as the paper kept wrinkling up so I went back to following  the recipe and rolling them out on a floured surface which worked much better.  I personally like the smaller shape.  My plan was to use them as tags on Christmas packages with names and trims added with frosting but I forgot to put a tiny hole in them before baking so I'll do the same thing but put them in a small baggie and tie on with ribbon.  Do leave space between them as they do puff up before going flat.   Enjoy!

I've been looking for the best gingerbread recipe for years and this one was good but no cigar. It was fun trying a recipe that didn't call for molasses and the house smelled like french toast as they were baking. Very yummy...

This really IS the best recipe EVER!!!  I was out of Ginger and substituted Nutmeg (only used 1/2 tsp, but increased cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp) and the cookie was STILL wonderful...and still a great cookie!  Perfect for rolling and cutting...no mess! Love, love, love this recipe!

Wow, what a great cookie and so easy to make!  This was my first time making rolled cookies.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used parchment paper instead of greasing the pan and I made mine 1/4 inch thick and baked them for 10 minutes.  They came out the perfect texture and taste so good!  They have just the right amount of spice to be pleasing to kids and adults.  My toddler and husband gobbled them up.  Yum!!  Thanks for posting this recipe.

I'm in the process of baking these now. The first comment I read was a little worried about the lack of liquid, but the dough that I've whipped up following the directions exactly doesn't need any more liquid than this.  The flavor is wonderful (I tasted the dough, guilty!) and very much like regular gingerbread but without that molasses bite. I imagine adding cloves, as one commenter did, would make up for that somewhat.  I plan on underbaking them slightly, since that seems to be the ideal. Great recipe overall!

it was my first time trying this recipe and it was definately a hit for both young and old.  a great mix of spices that wasn't too strong for a toddler to enjoy but a nice ginger spice taste for the older taste buds.  They tasted great right out of the oven without icing on them so the few that were left to make it through the cooling process was dipped in melted chocolate for legs then piped icing and they were delicious!  I only did get 18 "men" and 6 mini men but I rolled the dough in 1/4" for cutting

Very good - and really easy.  I  like that it doesn't call for sticky molasses.  The dough was dry and crumbly so I had to work with it a bit to get it to roll out.  I rolled it out on a silicone baking sheet.  I didn't have to flour the surface because the dough wasn't at all sticky.  Baked for 7 minutes at 350 degrees.  Next time I will just do 6 minutes (I like a little softer of a cookie).  Yielded about 4 dozen cookies.

I read this recipe and reviews and was very skeptical but gave it a try anyway.  It was great!  I first creamed the brown sugar and butter, then added the egg and then the pudding powder.  You really have to stir and stir and stir for the pudding to dissolve and become incorporated.  I added 1.5 tsp each of giner and cinnamon.  I got exactly 24 gingerbread men using the Wilton comfy grip cutter.  My boys loved these and they disapeared before I could get them iced.  This is a keeper.  Just remember to stir and stir and stir some more with the additions.

Absolutely loved them!  SUPER easy to make.  I would love a follow up recipe for the icing you made.  The icing I made, didn't really harden enough and was extremely difficult to pipe.  In any case, the cookies were a huge hit and I'm already planning to make more.

Perfect recipe and totally kid friendly.  I used instant pudding because it was what I had on hand.  Came together wonderfully.  Stuck the dough in the fridge for about 10 minutes, cut it into 1/4's and let the kids pat it out and cut their own shapes.  We all had such a great time that I totally plan on doing it again, this time with frosting and decorations for the cookies.

I have never made gingerbread cookies and wanted to give it a shot, followed the recipe exactly.  The first time I made this dough, it was very dry and cracked when trying to cut out shapes.  So I just balled them up, pressed with a fork and baked.  They still tasted great.  On Christmas Eve, I really wanted to make gingerbread men, so this time I added a splash of milk.  It was too soft and frustrated the kids but at least they were cutting out if we were VERY careful.  They are very tasty, soft and chewy, but I am determined to get it right so that they cut out easier.  Does it need more butter or what?

Thanks for a super simple and very tasty recipe. I only baked the cookies for about 6 minutes, I prefer a slightly chewy gingerbread cookie.

First off i have to say that i am in no way a baker AT ALL!! So when i was looking for a cookie recipe i wanted something very easy to bake. And that is exactly what you have in these gingerbread men-easy-  I am making them as little treats for my family for Christmas so i wanted them to be good to eat and easy to make.  I made the dough last night and baked them this morning just to give the dough enough time to chill. I have tried one and they are really really good, can't wait to decorate them and see everyone enjoy them later!!  :)

I don't know what I did wrong, but the dough turned out super dry after I refrigerated it as suggested.  I couldn't even roll it and it was flaking apart!

I followed the recipe to a T. I baked a batch of these for a cookie swap at work, and I had none left at the end of the day and people were asking for the recipe. If you use smaller cookie cutouts, its enough for 2.5 dozen cookies, they don't expand that much, but I kept it to 6 gingerbread people per cookie sheet. They were a little crispy, because I didn't make them as thick, but were still very good.

I just made these for my daughter's first grade class. The dough was great to work with and is delicious. A double batch made 30 large (5") gingerbread men. Don't worry about the butterscotch...it still tastes like gingerbread and no one would guess it's in there! The kids LOVE this!

I can't believe how good this is!!! Roll them out thinner and it makes a gingersnap. Roll them a little thicker and it makes a wonderful, chewy cookie.  Don't let the lack of liquid scare you. They were perfect and I refigerated the dough for 2 days instead of 1 hour becuase we got busy.

This was a very good cookie, in fact my mom said this was the best gingerbread cookie she has EVER had! I will certainly make them again. When I first tried them out of the oven I thought they needed more spice, but when I had another one hours later it tasted good with the right amount of spice.     Most of mine came out soft, which I really liked, but I did have a few that were hard. The only thing for me was that I found it hard to eyeball when they were done, so that is probably why most of mine came out soft, but I prefer the soft texture.

I did this recipe to the letter and despite the only liquid being butter and egg, it was perfect - made incredibly soft, chewy, perfect-to-the-modern palate gingerbread sugar cookies.    There are extra little bits of dry dough crumbles on the bottom if you don't mix it well.  But the recipe is perfect as is.  The finished cookies still have a bite and kick, but much milder (and tastier, I think!) than your true old style gingerbread cookie.  This only made two dozen men for me so I'd double the recipe if you want to make enough for a holiday cookie exchange.  Incredibly chewy, soft, amazing recipe.  Highly recommended!

10 STARS BABY!  I do not like molasses gingerbread cookies and I found this and followed the recipe to the letter and WOW!  Yummy.....SO DARN GOOD!  I did a "test run" today before I made these to give away and I KNOW the people gifted with these will love them.  Let me address the "cooking time".  I used a BIG gingerbread man cutter and YES they DID take about 12 minutes....smaller cookies will NOT take as long.....but I am stickin' with my jumbo boys!  Anyway try this fabu recipe and can I just say THANK YOU for posting and thank you ALL for the amazing pics which gave me GREAT decorating ideas!  OH YES...someone advised buying more then one box of pudding ...... YES!  Get more then one box.....TRUST that piece of advice.

I'm not sure how this dough is supposed to work, but mine was a bit of a mess. Initially, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was really dry after mixing all of the ingredients.  I added about 6 tbsp of water, one at a time, until it just pulled together.  Refrigerating didn't seem to help it and it was crumbly as I rolled it out.  The only reason that I'm giving this 3 stars is because my 3 year old loved them.  They do have a nice, mild, gingerbread flavor that kids will find appealing.  I will probably make these again next year for the kids, but I'll be checking to see if someone has come up with a solution to the dryness by then.  It was a lot of work to get these ingredients to become cookies.

Great flavor and consistency. Cooks up firm to touch but soft on the inside, not too hard.I also had trouble with the crumbly dough, even after chilling. Solved it by mixing in another egg which made it hold together but also made it a little sticky. Adding more flour bit by bit made a nice soft dry dough easy to roll out.End result....delicious and easy to handle.

I loved this recipe. I used instant pudding, and they turned out great. I timed my bake time 10 min exactly, and it was just right. They were soft while hot, but hardened up to a nice firm cookie. I will make these again :)

This recipe is great!  It is very easy to roll out.  My 4 year old had fun helping to cut out cookies.  I also made some sugar cookies using this recipe.  I used vanilla pudding, white sugar instead of brown, and didn't use the ginger and cinnamon.  They were great. Update:  I used instant pudding and it worked.  No difference.  I have used chocolate and vanilla pudding and these are the best and easiest rolled cookies.

This recipe has become a Christmas tradition in our family. My kids would never eat more tradition gingerbread men but they absolutely love these. I roll them out a little thicker and get a perfect and soft cookie every time (just don't overbake). I make a traditonal icing out of confectioners sugar, light corn syrup, milk and I add about a tsp of lemon extract. I find the slight hint of lemon in the icing works very well with the flavor of the cookie. We'll keep making these year after year.

I made these with my Kindergarten class and they turned out soooooo well.  The kids loved them as they didn't have that overpowering flavor.  The dough was a little dry ad tricky at first, but just keep at it - it is worth the payoff.  Ours jumped off the pan and we had to hunt through the school to find them!  Run, Run, as fast as you can!

a very good cookie, stayed soft for a long time. Yum. If you like a strong ginger taste, added an extra 1/2 tsp of ginger.

These cookies taste very good but because they don't get very hard you can't put a lot of icing on them unless they are VERY thickly cut. I learned the hard way when my gingerbread men's heads kept coming off after I put on a little too much frosting hair! Good recipe but watch the accessories.

I Love this recipe!  We made these cookies at my work a few years back for our kids and they were delicious.  I havn't been able to find them until now.  Kids love these they bake up soft and chewy instead of the traditional hard spicy cookies.  Can't go wrong with these!

I have always enjoyed ginger snaps and gingerbread but have been hesitant to make it on my own. I am so glad I tried this one. It is so easy and very good. I don't think I will have to try anymore gingerbread recipes. This is it!

Love this recipe!  It's easy to make, less expensive than buying molasses, and wonderfully chewy and spicy!  I make this recipe every year around Christmas, into gingerbread houses :) .

I can not say enough about this recipe!  These were absolutely delicious!  I only had dark brown sugar on hand, and it gave the cookies a richer color than the traditional G-men. These were a huge hit with my 4 year old (who helped decorate them) and all who tried them!  Stayed soft and fresh in a Tupperware container for 3 weeks!
I will make these every Christmas!  Thanks so much!

Having never made a gingerbread man before ever, I was very pleased with the way these turned out. They were part of my cookie gifting this year and everyone has loved them so far...even a coworker who said she didn't like gingerbread cookies!

These were great! My picky husband and kids loved them. Not too spicy and just right for all different palates. One tip is that the dough really needs to be cold, so the cutouts don't stick to the counter.

My daughters & I have been making this recipe for the last 3 yrs & we love it!  When I started looking for an easy gingerbread men recipe that did NOT require molasses I came across Kim's recipe & tried it.  One thing I've learned though is that since the dough is SO soft I add 1/2 cup more flour than the recipe asks.  Dont' know if it's where I live (south Texas) but this dough was never easy to roll out until I added more flour.  Also I chill the dough in the freezer.  My girls are ages 9 & 4 & they love adding mini M&M's for eyes.  I use a powdered sugar glaze to pipe out details & they come out looking so cute!  I love the milder taste & the butterscotch is a nice flavor also.  Another tip:  when rolling out use plenty of dough on the surface & rolling pin because even though I added more flour to the recipe the dough is still pretty soft.  Thanks to Kim for this awesome recipe.  This is one we'll be making for years!

very popular and a big hit wherever we go. I like my gingerbread with a slight kick, so I added 50% more ginger. I might up the amount of cinnamon too. Also, 1/4" thick cookies cooked over an airbake sheet leave them nice and soft.

I made these for my students and most of them liked them (when I made regular molassas gingerbread cookies most of the kids wouldn't eat them). My teenage daughter and my husband loved the dough so much that I had to kick the out of the kitchen so that I would have enough cookies for my class.  I do think that I made them too big or too thick because I only got about 2 1/2 dozen out of a double batch.
I just want to add to my review. I have made these for my Kindergarten class for several years and they always love them. Though they are a little different than REAL Gingerbread cookies, they are PERFECT for kids!!!

I was very uncertain how these would turn out. I've only eaten a gingerbread man once but I loved it. And these turned out exactly the same taste as the one i had before. I had lots of fun decorating them and eating them. This is the ONLY recipe that i'm gonna use to make gingerbread men in the future. This recipe is WOW!!!

amazing!!! I did add a little more ginger so they would not be so sweet tasting from the pudding. I made mine for a baby shower and decorated them into little baby feet shaped cookies...everyone loved them and are asking me for the recipe...it was the hit of the party...people thought they were store bought

This is a great recipe for young kids who may not like the stronger taste of other gingerbread cookies. We made these around Christmas time for my sons playgroup to decorate. They held up well to 2 year olds decorating!

Great recipe!  Easy baking with great result.  I used 2 tsp cinnamon and ginger for extra flavor and they came out very well.  Used a heart-shaped cookie cutter and added pink glaze for Valentine's day.  Original recipe made 24 cookies.  Delicious!  Will definitely use again.  Thanks Kim!

I am still learning about baking and had never attempted gingerbread before. I followed this recipe and the gingerbread men were great! I did find that it was easier to mix and seemed to turn out better when I melted the butter instead of using room temp. I have no idea if that was implied and I just missed it. I have made a few batches now and they tend to be crisp on the outside with just enough soft in the center to make my 2 1/2 year old gobble them down with delight! I did double it,store airtight& use milk & confect sugar glaze as others suggested. The reviews were right again, glaze realy isn't needed! Thank you so much for this recipe. It will be a joyful addition to our holidays and that is a priceless gift!

I wanted to make gingerbread men for my nephews to decorate, but I knew they would not like traditional gingerbread with molasses. These tasted great! We decorated them with red hots, m&m's and small tubes of colored frostings from the grocery store. We had a great time. Thank you for this recipe!

These are very good.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that in Canada, we only have the cooked pudding in the larger size, so I had to double.  Not sooo bad....  Do keep in an airtight container otherwise they get hard.

Taste of these cookies is great!  However, the dough never got stiff enough to roll out, I had to spoon out mixture and make round cookies.

This is an easy yet tasty recipe.  We decorated with icing and sprinkles and the kids loved 'em.  They  are soft and chewy with a hint of butterscotch flavor. The recipe says 30 servings, but I only got about 12 cookies.  Maybe it depends on the size of your cutters?

These are awesome! You can't taste the butterscotch flavor, but it balances out the ginger so it's not too strong. I would strongly recommend these. We used Red Hots for eyes and buttons.

Wonderful cookies!  Very easy to work with.  I used sugar free pudding mix and it still worked great.  I trippled the recipe and it still only made about 5 1/2 dozen cookies.  Will definately make these again and again.  Thank you!

These are good and easy to make. Even with extra ginger they still taste a lot like butter cookies.  I recommend for people that don't like the strong taste of regular gingerbread and want a more subtle ginger taste.

This recipe could be changed for any flavor cookie.  Just change the pudding flavor, replace the seasoning with flour so the balance will be correct.  Good Luck.  I tried these cookies, they're great!

This is one of the yummiest gingerbread recipes I have ever tasted! My kids thought it was great because it did not have a really heavy molasses flavor. The pudding makes the cookie moist and it has just the right amount of ginger flavor. THe dough was very easy to work with too! This is an al around great recipe! Definitely a keeper!

These were good and very easy. We made them into fall/harvest shapes and wrote peoples name on them for Thanksgiving... They were a big hit, my 2 year old daughter loved "helping" and telling everyone she made them!

What a lovely cookie.  The only gingerbread men I've ever had were always rock hard and hard to roll.  Not these, they are a breeze to make. Who would have thought it? Butterscotch pudding.  I experimented with coconut pudding and 1/2 cup of coconut and those were great also. I'm going to try chocolate next with chocolate chips.  Thanks  Kim

I agree with Teresashen from Arizona (I am from AZ too!).  The dough was too dry; crumbly while mixing, so I added less than 1/4 cup of water and the dough was perfect.  Great smell while baking and great taste!  Better than regular gingerbread.

It's amazing how the butterscotch disappears leaving behind a traditional gingerbread flavor.  Nice easy recipe.  The dough needed a little extra flour for rolling ... but don't almost all rolled cookies?  Very good recipe.

This is our only gingerbread recipe in the house! Yes, it is a mild tasting cookie and depending on the thickness, its chewy. An awesome combo. Its not a traditional tasting gingerbread but its a keeper for my family. thank you.

Made this with my 8 year old daughter and she and I loved it! Not a true gingerbread taste, but that wasn't really the goal. We wanted to decorate them (and eat them). I followed the recipe to the letter and had great results.

I don't love molasses so this recipe was fantastic for us.  The cookies are more moist and soft than typical gingerbread. My kids gobbled it up!

My dough was sticky and a little difficult to work with so I thought it wouldn't come out right.  To my pleasant surprise it came out perfectly.  I even made some simple icing to top them with (powdered sugar and milk).  The cookies have the heat and aroma of ginger but isn't too spicy.  I don't even usually like gingerbread.  Great recipe!

Easy, delicious recipe! I took the advice of 2 other reviewers-roll the dough between two pieces of parchment (and bake on the parchment) and keep any dough not being used in the fridge. The dough is easier to use cold.

I doubled this recipe and got 40 cookies. And instead of using powdered ginger, I used bottled minced ginger.  The bottled ginger gave the cookies a stronger ginger flavour.

Make it gluten free! 
My kids love this recipe! I have made it with regular flour and our namaste gluten free flour blend and they are amazing!  We also like them cut into circles and put icing or melted white chocolate on top.

Bake on parchment paper ALWAYS! 

Don't over bake. 9 min is plenty.

I didn't have any butterscotch pudding, so I used one cheesecake and one French vanilla (for a double batch). I also increased the cinnamon to 1 1/2 tsp and added 1/2 tsp cloves and 1/4 tsp nutmeg (per batch). They rolled out like a dream and were SO good, even before we iced them. This recipe will become one of my annual Christmas cookie recipes! A double batch made 32 cut-out cookies.

Any pudding cookie is to die for. Soft and delicious.  For a spicier cookie add more ginger and cinnamon. Made these last Christmas and I will make them every Christmas from here on out.

What a great recipe. This is the first Gingerbread Cookies I've ever made and it's actually the best one I've ever had. As some reviewers stated, I added more cinnamon and ginger, 1/2 tsp to be exact. It came out great. My husband is not a big cookie fan and he went back for more. They taste great without any frosting. The dough was very easy to work with. My daughter (4 yrs) cut out Gingerbread Man figures. We all had to stop ourselves from eating them because we're saving to frost them tomorrow on Christmas Eve. Thanks Kim! We will be making this every holiday. :-)

I made this today using sugar free instant pudding because that's all the store had and it , and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Cut the softened butter in together with the pudding and brown sugar. After you mix all ingredients together really well and squish together with hands it nenes the perfect roll out dough. I kept in the fridge for only the time it took to preheat oven.  It really made it much easier to roll between parchment paper and pull off the extra dough. It was very easy to take extra dough squish together again and roll out and cut out more shapes. No dough was wasted and I was able to get about twenty four medium sized shapes. Really super easy, non sticky dough to work with (using parchment paper) the cookies held their shape great ( I posted pic of my gingerbread men and bears) after they came out of oven. Easy for kids to decorate and they loved eating them. Yummy and easy to make. Thank you for sharing this recipe and for all the helpful reviews. Merry Christmas!!!

This is a great cookie for everyone.  I made a double batch and got 36 5-inch gingerbread cut-outs.  I started with a portion of dough, leaded in a little more flour before I started rolling it out.  Rerolled the scraps with another portion of dough.  At the end I added the last scraps to the final baking sheet.  Tastes great, easy to work with, and makes the house smell like the holidays! ; )

Not sure what I did wrong, but in my case the "dough" was super sticky, I've never done cookies before so was excited to try it with my daughter, but she's like mom we're a FAIL...lol. Followed the instructions and all the same ingredients, but it was all guey on the roller, i salvaged what I could and just put some odd shaped scoops in the oven! We did like the flavor, but were unable to shape the little gingerbread men :( I did  make it again because I had more of the ingredients left, but this time i didnt attempt to roll anything, just put scoops in the oven.

I have made this for 5 years running. It's so simple to do, yet festive and delish. I have found that using INSTANT pudding makes this dough far less sticky and easier to work with - not sure why, but it made a remarkable difference.

A win with the kids!  When my daughter's teacher asked me to make gingerbread men for her 1st grade class I was concerned that they would go to waste, as gingerbread isn't generally a kid favorite.  This may not be a true gingerbread without molasses, but it sure went over well with the little ones!

I was in a rush and requested to make gingerbread cookies so this recipe was great for me.  This rolled out easily without stickiness and very easy to cut out and position.  I did bake them for only 8 minutes on the second tray and liked them a tad softer.  I doubled the recipe and glad I did as the yield was much better.  I did add clove and nutmeg to the fold for a bit more traditional flavor.  I will certainly be making these again to add to our Christmas cookie platter.  Thanks for sharing this Kim!

Love this recipe! I make this every year. The dough is easy to work with and though I don't care for butterscotch pudding, you wouldn't even know it's in there. It has a wonderful flavor for those who love gingerbread, and even those who aren't especially fond of gingerbread love this recipe. Thank you for posting. This would also work great for gingerbread houses as well.

Sorry, but I found these cookies to be dry and tasteless. Just putting ginger in a cookie recipe doesn’t make a Gingerbread cookie! There are many really good Gingerbread cookie recipes out there, and they don’t take any longer to make.

THE BEST gingerbread cookie recipe I have tried. It was super easy and tasted great! The consistency was perfect and my 3 and 5 year old had no problem rolling out the dough and cutting out their favorite Christmas shapes. I was a bit skeptical since it did not call for molasses and used butterscotch pudding mix instead. I am so glad I trusted the reviews and the poster, Kim. This will now be my go-to gingerbread recipe every year.

These turned out great, and so easy to make!  The dough was a little on the crumbly side, but the cookies baked up nicely, with a great mild ginger flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

Loved this! Made it true to the recipe and the cookies were delicious right out of the oven! I did double it to make more cookies with friends.

These are easy to make and delicious. I recommend transfering them to a wire rack immediately - I did not and found the cookies were just a touch overcooked.

This was my first time making gingerbread cookies and it was great loved it I did tweak it with the recommendations other put but I still would put more spices in it for my liking... My 7yo daughter loved rolling the dough and cutting the cookies. But the dough was kinda sticky but workable.

I loved these cookies. I just made them and everyone in my house is going crazy over them. I had to hide them to make sure they don't go away before Christmas! No one usually likes gingerbread in my family because the molasses, but they can't get their hands off these!!! As most gingerbead cookies the dough was a little sticky and difficult to work with, but with a little flour and wax paper the problem was solved. I would definitley make these again!

Wow! I never made gingerbread cookies before and always heard it was difficult because of the molasses. When i found that this used butterscotch pudding instead of molasses, I was a little skeptical. The result: The perfect cookie to get you in the spirit!! Although I did cook it for 7 and a half minutes absolutely perfect! Thanks for sharing! I love Christmas and Baking!!

This is a very good cookie! I'm not a big fan of the true gingerbread cookie taste and the elimination of the molasses and using the butterscotch pudding made this a very easy recipe to make and a very yummy cookie! My 3 and 11 yr olds love them as much as I do!

OK, just not spicy enough. They are easy to roll out. Doesn't make a lot, so probably a great recipe for kids to play with and enjoy.

Very easy and not too strong gingerbread flavor, which we like. I made these just into circles and will drizzle icing on top. Next time plan to top with natural sugar before baking to add a little something.

Great recipe!  I've never been a huge fan of gingerbreaad cookies, but these are delicious and very easy to make.  I couldn't find the "cook and serve" pudding mix so I used the instant kind and they still turned out great.

Great recipe.  I did double and then added an extra egg.  I am going to use Vanilla Instant Pudding and leave out the ginger for my next batch of Christmas cookies.

I thought these were really good!  I don't like the taste of molasses, so I was happy to find something close to the real thing, but without that ingredient.  I used a package of Pumpkin Spice Pudding mix because I had it on hand.  We shared with our neighbors and already look forward to making the next batch.  This recipe seems dry when mixing at first, but after everything was well mixed, I formed it into a ball with my hands.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made these cookies tonight and my husband and son immediately started eating them! They were a big hit!!! The cookies were the softest (as my family likes them) when I rolled the dough out a little on the thick side and baked for 10 minutes. I used Royal Icing to decorate them - very cute! Perfect for my son who is a very picky eater. These cookies were more on the sweet side and a little lighter on the spices, just as we like them. Delicious! I'm sure I'll be making another batch soon!

Wow!! Easy to make and handle. The cookie got dry quickly when I replaced 1/2 the butter with oil and 1/2 the sugar with gran. splenda. Still was consumed  quickly on the changed batch as it was on the original we made yesterday. Yet I am concerned over the negative aspects of using artificial sweeteners. We eventually just kept most of the ingredients and it has become our cookie recipe for all seasons year-round except that we use a 50/50 mix of oil and butter instead of all butter.

This is a great gingerbread recipe for kids. Tastes more like a sugar cookie with a hint of ginger. Kids will like it more than the spicey gingerbread taste. I did have to double the egg, though. I found it was way to dry with just one egg. After that it was perfect! My daughter had so much fun helping me make them!!!

my cookies expanded so much you couldn;t tell what shape they were! I only put 8 on a tray and they ran together to much that it was basically just one big gingerbread square! I was making these for dessert plates to give out for christmas, so i just cut the cookies into squares and iced them and used gingerbread man shaped sprinkles that I had. they tasted fine, however, and it was a good way to use up my sprinkles that i had no idea what to do with! for the rest of my dough, i flattened it out into a pan and made squares as well. i don't like molasses at all (the smell, taste, texture, anything) so i refuse to cook with it, so i was happy to find a gingerbread recipe without mollasses. i loved the taste of these!!

The flavor of these cookies are great...but the dough was very sticky and difficult to roll out.  The cookie did not hold its shape when cooked, even after refridgeration, but they taste great...if I make these cookies again I will just drop them on the cookie sheet.

Very good and very very easy. I love traditional gingerbread and it has it's place, but this is a fantastic alternate when you don't want to bother with molasses! Definitely a favourite with the kids :o)

Not sure what I did to this.  The mixture was VERY dry.  I left it out a bit after chilling to see if it would soft up, but no such luck.  I also had a hard time finding the butterscotch pudding mix in the 3.5 oz size.  I could only find the instant and used that instead.

I made these with my boys (3 & 5) this morning.  They were very easy to make and very tasty.  They are going very quickly as I type this review.  I will make them again with my boys.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Excellent recipe!  I like the faint gingerbread taste evened out by the pudding mix.  I used tapioca pudding because I did not have butterscotch.  I was afraid it might come out grainy, but I think it actually created pockets of flavor and softness within the cookies.  I would add more ginger and cinnamon for the future but that can be remedied by adding cinnamon to the icing.  Overall, a great recipe...molasses can be so messy, and this is a great substitute.  So easy!

Oh. My. God. words can't even explain how happy I am right now. I think this is only my second time (out of 2903480481) trying a recipe off of this website that came out GOOD. I love these! First off, I read the reviews before I made it, and decided to add some water to my mixture, I'd say I put in a bit more than a tablespoon, which was probably a little too much. Put it in the fridge for an hour, and it came out kinda wet and sticky, so I just put a lot of flower on my surface to even it out. Also, I didn't have ginger, which is good, because I think it's thee most disgusting thing to put in cookies, ever. And so I just added in some extra cinnamon. Straight out of the oven is the BEST! I was unsure how to decorate them, especially because I didn't have frosting or cute little candies. So I just sparsely put sprinkles on it. I'll upload a picture. Good luck! :)

my boyfriend and I made this recipe last night...and we found that the dough was a little dry, so we added just a couple of drops of water and that did the trick.  tastey.

I had a little trouble getting the dough to stay together when rolling these out so I added a few drops of water and that helped.  They were really good.  The recipe stated that it would make 30 men, but it depends on the size of your cookie cutter.  I got only 10 out of the recipe, so I guess my cutter is 3X the size of the one used in the recipe!   Good variation to the overly powerful everyday gingerbread man!

I found this recipe on this web site 3 Christmases ago and it is now one of my holiday must-bakes.  It is really easy to do, and the cookies come out so light with a perfect amount of crisp.  FYI, I don't even roll and cut them, I form them into a log and then just slice them thinly.  I sprinkle them with colored sugar before baking.  They're my very-own, homemade, slice-n-bake cookies!

I love these cookies, can't get enough of them. They're delicious and chewy. When I got the dough mixed, I felt a bit uneasy b/c the dough was quite tough. But after rolling them out, it soften a bit. The cookies turned out beautiful, I made a simple white & green icing for decor. The kids loved them. But most of all, I loved the chewy texture of the cookies! Very easy to make.

I did not use buttersotch pudding, didn't have it in the cupboard, so I used chocolate pudding instead. Now I found the dough really crumbly so I put about a 1/4 cup of egg nog into it. DELICIOUS! The eggnog formed crystals in the cookies and made them crunchy. They are amazing, made way more than 30 cookies.

I found it really hard to roll this dough. For some reason it just kept crumbling apart. It seemed to roll better as it got warmer in fact, which seems totally backwards. We did manage to get some gingerbread men done, and they tasted really good. The second half we just did drop cookies ~ haven't tasted them yet.

Great recipe! I had no problems getting the dough to come together as some mentioned. Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. Only problem is it makes nowhere near 30 cookies. I only got 15 using a standard gingerbread man shaped cutter.

These were good.  Baked ~ 9 minutes, but used a small man cookie cut-out.  I may add a bit more ginger next time since I love ginger taste.  As is, this is a very mild (which everyone will love) tasting cookie.  VERY GOOD.

I made them 1/4 inch thick and would suggest only rolling out dough twice at the most before refrigerating it again. Great tasting cookie. Easy recipe. I dipped the legs in white chocolate as someone suggested, which was so good they were requested over the holidays.

These cookies were delicious!  This was the first time I made a rollout cookie.  Once I got the hang of it everything went smoothly.  I did not alter the recipe at all.  I will make them again next Christmas season.

We loved this recipe, my son wanted a gingerbread train for his 3rd birthday, and I knew my kids wouldn't eat regular gingerbread, just too strong. We found this recipe and gave it a try, the shape of each train piece spread a bit of course w/ baking, but I just cut it back to shape while it was still warm and soft, worked out great. The flavor is amazing, my husband and I love it too. Have made it several times since as gingerbread people and just round cookies. Really delicious. *the only changing at all to the recipe I did was add a tsp of vanilla to the wet ingredients. Turned out great.

I was in the mood to make gingerbread, so I looked for the easiest recipe I could find - this was it!  The dough was easy to work with and was flexible enough to add some flour during rolling.  The ginger flavor was great but not too overwhelming.  Regarding texture, the response I most often got was "These are the softest gingerbread cookies I've ever had!"  I decorated by just putting canned frosting in a ziploc, snipping a teeny tiny corner and piping.  Good times!

These are unbelievably good and I don't usually love gingerbread cookies.  I covered them in frosting which is the only way to eat them.  I'm already looking forward to eating more next Christmas.

I didn't have molasses on hand so I was excited to find this recipe. The cookies were beautiful & tasted delicious. They also freeze nice. Butterscotch pudding is good in the cookies but it's not necessary. I've made this using vanilla because that's what I had on hand & they were just as good as when using butterscotch.

Excellent cookies and great for making with kids because there are just enough in the recipe that they don't get tired of making them!! I had instant vanilla pudding on hand so that's what I used. I also doubled the ginger to give it a little more quick and it was still palatable for little ones. This one will become a Christmas standard in my house!!

I make this recipe with the kids every year.  It is easy and delicious.  It has been our Christmas tradition to make and decorate these guys for the last 4 years  and this is the only recipe I'll use.  I don't know what some people are talking about when they say these don't taste like true gingerbread cookies.  They taste like gingerbread to me.  They're probably better than traditional ginger bread.

Wow! It was quick and pretty easy. I had been wanting to make gingerbread men for a while but didn't feel like getting shortening/molasses. I looked at this recipe and turned my nose up to it, too; I didn't want to get butterscotch. However, opening the cabinet I discovered that we had an old packet of the instant pudding mix--surprise surprise! I wouldn't have made these if I had the choice between these and real gingerbread men--I like my men to be more authentic. However, with the ingredients on hand they turned out very soft and good. They were a little too sweet for my liking, though--tooooo tooo much sugar. The dough started out dry, but the more I used it the more it softened up. Rolling it out was complicated and a little sticky, but it wasn't TERRIBLE. When I actually baked the men, they spread and came out OBESE. However, I only baked them for 8 minutes so they were still soft, and I used my cookie cutter on the baked cookies to make them much much better looking (plus I got to eat the scraps. haha.) Overall, a good recipe.

Very good! I made these for a Christams party and I was specifically looking for a recipe that didn't have an overly ginger taste. I followed the recipe but added a little more cinnamon. The cookies were delicious, super easy to handle and stayed moist. I recommend the minimum cookig time on these.

I've never made gingerbread before.  I know this is not a typical recipe, but I chose it because I thought my 2 and 5 year old would like them better.  These cookies are YUMMY!! I didn't modify the recipe at all.  I've never rolled out cookie dough, but this was easy to work with.  The only slight problem was the baking time.  Ten minutes was too long, next time I'll try about 7-8 minutes instead.

Wow. First time making gingerbread cookies so I wouldn't know what a hassle molasses is but I can only imagine!  These are amazingly simple and so delicious. I agree with another reviewer that they are almost like a gingerbread/sugar cookie.  They have great flavor and texture and were complimented nicely by my eggnog flavored butter cream frosting!  Only gave 4/5 because they definitely only needed 8 minutes to bake not 12 suggested.

I chose this recipe because I didn't have molases.  It will become my go-to recipe for gingerbread.  The dough was easy to work with and the cookies were delicious.  I used "Sugar Cooking Icing" with it and the two went really well together.

I added a teaspoon of vanilla for better flavor. They are tasty, nothing special though. The cooking time is way off for this recipe- I only cooked mine for 6 minutes, and even then some came out burnt.

these cookies were a hit at my workplace pot luck thanksgiving luncheon. No changes to the recipe. However, i did make round cookies instead of the men to save time baking. I rolled the chilled dough into a log and cut off sections, shaped and baked for 15 minutes on a greased cookie sheet. They came out soft and fantastic. A great Recipe!

These are delicious, soft, & easy to make. I didn't didn't have time to use cookie cutters, so I just rolled them into little balls & made them into cookies.

FANTASTIC!!!!   So easy to work with.  I followed a very helpful suggestion from a review on this site and I am glad that I did.  I used 2 1/2 teaspoons of ginger and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon and 3/4 teaspoon cloves.  Great taste!  I also doubled the recipe with no problems at all.  This is definitely going into my cookbook.  My grandchildren will love them this Christmas.

Delicious! I baked them for 7-8 minutes, and they came out perfectly, firm but moist. Some of the best rolled cookies I've made, very easy to work with. The recipe yielded about 18 gingerbread men.

I made a slew of cookies for my co-workers for christmas.  This recipe was a great pick!  Everyone loved them.  They're great dipped in milk.  Yum!  Will definitely keep this recipe for next year...I might even make them sooner.

These turned out great!  My 3-year-old daughter helped with the entire process.  I thought the dough was easy to work with.  They tasted best when only baked for 8-9 minutes.

Sooo delicious; the second year in a row I am using this recipe. 
If your dough is too dry add a teaspoon of milk/water gradually while mixing until it firms up. It is best to do this before refrigerating it. YUM! 
I really liked the extra cloves in the recipe as well.

These are delicious when fresh baked. However I think after a few days in a tightly sealed container on the counter they tasted "cardboardy" and kind of stale. If you make them earlier than your serving date I'd suggest freezing them.

This is a great recipe, especially for kids who don't like the "spiciness" of a traditional gingerbread man. I followed the recipe exactly, but listened to the other reviewers, who said to decrease the baking time. I'm glad I did! I baked the first batch for just under 10 minutes, then decreased the time for subsequent batches. They turned out really well. I'll definitely use this recipe again. Thanks for posting it!

I followed this recipe exactly and as other members have mentioned, the dough was very dry and crumbly.  It became a challenge at times to roll this dough out without it cracking or crumbling, but with patience, you can get some fine little gingermen.  The resulting cookie was at least very gingery, but I'm afraid I did not it worthy of 5 stars.  I will probably try other gingerbread cookie recipes before returning to this one.  Thanks for the recipe!

The recipe instructions did not seem very clear to me.  I followed directions exactly, but I had to add 3 eggs (instead of 1) to allow the mixture to become dough.  I baked them for the time that is instructed and the timing was perfect.  Also, I tried this recipe using whole wheat flour and it turned out terrible.  Needless to say, my fiance & I got a lot of laughs from trying to decorate these cookies.

This recipe was a mess. It was very crumbly and we had to add a lot of butter to make up for the crumbly bits. We packed the dough into a ball and put it in the freezer.

This was the first gingerbread recipe I have ever made and it was very easy, no problems at all. The most important thing was to keep the dough cold when rolling it out. If it starts sticking too much, pop it in the freezer for 5 minutes and it will be ready to roll! Also, the time for baking was too long. I only baked my cookies for 7 minutes. So be careful and watch to make sure not to over cook. Very tasty!

I made this recipe exactly as is.  The dough was very easy to work with.  The taste is wonderful.  Not too much ginger.  Perfect for my picky 5 year old.  I used a large gingerbread man cookie cutter and got almost 2 dozed cookies.

Fantastic recipe! I love using pudding mix into my baking, it always seems to make soft, delicious cookies. I doubled the recipe (and used the larger Jell-O Butterscotch Pudding Mix (6 servings sized box).I wasn't sure if the dough was going to work because it looked crumbly after being in the fridge, but once you   work your hands into it, and roll it out, it works perfectly.I also used the icing recipe which was included in "AUTUMNJOY"'s review of this recipe, and used M&M's as buttons. 
These cookies are addictive!!!

This is a great, easy recipe.  I made it for my son's first birthday party, the theme was dogs so I used bone shaped cutters instead and didn't ice them.  It was so good!  The first batch I made I added extra butter because it seemed too dry and I didn't think it would work.  However, in subsequent batches, I followed the directions and after working with the dough, it will come out fine.  They were a huge hit at the party!

I don't usually like gingerbread, but this recipe is fantastic! I made tiny gingerbread men (about 1.5 inches head to toe) and put 2 together with a cream cheese icing to make little cookie sandwiches. They were great! I sell cookies at a local store and these went really fast. Thanks for the recipe!

These don't taste anything like a typical gingerbread cookie. That being said, I would rate this a 10 if I could. These disapear faster than any cookie I've ever made. I make them all year round - Gingerbread Men, pumpkins, hearts for Valentine's Day, etc. By far the most popular cookie recipe I have. Excellent!!!

My niece wanted to make Gingerbread people as gifts this past Christmas, so I surfed this great site and found the perfect recipe. Worked like a charm and tasted great! She decorated each one using the traites of that person's personality. Everyone loved their gift!

I used this recipe this winter when my kids and I had a Gingerbread house decorating party.  I tested two different recipes on my kids before the party and this one won.  It is a mild gingerbread so kids love it.

This is a great recipe---I've given it to several friends already.  If the dough seems crumbly don't be discouraged; just keep working it and the heat from your hands will smooth it out.  I doubled the ginger also, which was pleasantly warm (yet not offensive to my 6-year-old).

I made two batches of this recipe.  The first batch was very crumbly, but after really packing it into a ball and chilling it they tuned out delicious!  The next batch I used vanilla pudding mix and slightly more butter and less flour.  They turned out excellent and were very easy to work with.  Thanks for a great Christmas recipe!  Santa will love them!

I have made these cookies at Christmas time for the past 2 years, and they are always a hit.  I have had more people ask me for this recipe than any other I have found on this site.  I usually double the recipe because I find it never makes as many as it says.  Could be that I roll it out too thick.  

It is not very spicy, but that is easily adjustable depending on your personal taste.  I LOVE this recipe!!

I LOVE this recipe!  I don't think you even need to refrigerate it before rolling.  For the person saying they are dry, I think that makes it easier to roll.  I used instant pudding (by accident) and I thought they turned out great.  Try these if you are looking for a lighter tasting gingerbread cookie.

These were the most perfect gingerbread men cookies I have ever made for my little ones. The taste wasn't so overwhelming and the texture was perfect. This is definitely my new gingerbread recipe. I don't care so much for molasses so this is perfect.

I may try this recipes again. I found it because I had butterscotch pudding I needed to use up. The dough was very crumbly. A little more moisture could eliminate this, I think.

I couldn't find butterscotch pudding mix and my local store, so I improvised two different ways.  Both turned out good!  For the first batch, I used vanilla pudding mix and chopped butterscotch morsels.  For the second, I used Pumpkin Spice pudding mix.  It was a limited edition flavor for the holidays.  I liked these cookies both ways, but I will still be on the hunt to find the butterscotch pudding mix so I can try the original recipe.

The dough was nice and very easy to work with.  The cookie turned out well.  I rolled them fairly thin because I like them crisp.
It is definitely more of a kid's gingerbread... very mild tasting-   Good, just not spicy at all.   I put 3 red hots on them for buttons and baked them in the oven that way.

I thought this recipe was simple and very successful. I did notice as some other people mentioned that the dough was pretty crumbly when I removed it from the fridge, but I added 2-3 tablespoons of water and it was perfect - not sticky at all and easily rolled. I also added some extra ginger, and pumpkin pie spice blend for some more flavour. Another tip I would also add is don't chill too long - the cookies I made from the second batch of warmer dough turned out better and softer.

This was a quick, easy recipe and came out nicely. I think that people that find regular gingerbread cookies too "strong" will like this alternative.

Jennifer, you don't need to make the pudding, add it dry as it says. I think the only thing you did wrong was that you probably gave up on mixing it to soon. The dough needs to be "dry" so that it will be stiff enough to make rolled cookies.

Try it again and keep mixing it. It might help to do it by hand. Wash your hands (clean your finger nails too) and lightly kneed the dough with your hands. By the time you chill it and then roll it out, you will see that your dough is just right.

These were a hit.  My 5 year old was sure he didn't like gingerbread because he had some traditional gingerbread cookies last year.  He tried these and loved them.  I haven't tasted them personally because I can't have sugar but the dough smelled heavenly and my whole house smells yummy.  My husband likes that they are soft but as a grown up would like them a bit spicier.  I had no problem with the dough being dry.  In fact it was very moist but I did melt the butter a bit.  I don't think spacing them 2 inches is neccessary because they don't puff much at all.  Which is great because they keep their shape nicely.  Great recipe for the kids and those that don't care for traditional gingerbread.  Thanks!

Jennifer, It is hard to mix at first, but if you get your hands into it and start kneading, it will come together.
Very excellent recipe!  This is the first time I've baked gingerbread (or made from scratch cookies for that matter) and they came out great!  Thanks!

I made these cookies last year for the holidays.  Our family tradition is to make 2 or 3 new cookie recipes to our neigbor's cookie trays.  Even though I enjoyed the flavor, the dough was dry and not easy to work with.  My husband didn't care for them so we won't be making this year.

I am absolutely hopeless at rolled dough recipes and I found this one very easy to work with. I let the dough chill in the fridge overnight, so it was a little stiff, but after i let it sit out and used plenty of flour on the counter, it was super easy. Like some of the other reviewers, I added more ginger and cinnamon for a spicier cookie, but that is just to accommodate my family's taste.

Nice flavor, very mild and kid friendly.  After refridgerating for over an hour the dough was stiff, however still too sticky to roll.  I added more flour until the consistency felt right.  Then rolling became very easy.  We enjoyed the recipe, and decorating the men afterwards.

Very good. They came kind of hard though. I like soft cookies, but I think gingerbread are supposed to be a harder cookie? I'm not sure. They were cute though!

I gave it a rating of a 5 because this recipe is excelent.  I didn't have any ginger, but used nutmeg and some cloves and more cinnamon, kept it in the fridge for a few days till i was ready to make them, they came out GREAT.  Everyone loved them, now i am on my way to bake them with my friend's daughters.  :)
thanks, they were not hard days later either.

These cookies are so tasty!  I followed the recipe exactly, used approximately a 4" cutter, and got 31 cookies.  Next time I will double the recipe.  The only problem I had was rolling them out, but I always have that problem with cut-out cookies.

These turned out great!  For some reason though I couldn't get a good baking time on these... I tried less and then more- it wasn't very forgiving on temp.  I burned a few and some were under done!  UGH!  The ones that turned out right my daughter gobbled up.  I may try again or we might try a different recipe next year.  Anyway, when you get em right they're tasty. :)

Yum! Thanks to these reviews, I haven't made a bad cookie yet from this site, and these are another addition to my holiday collection.  Easy to make, not many ingredients, and they have a great taste.  I can't exactly describe the flavor, it resembles gingerbread but is sweeter, and not as hard, but not chewy either.  I cut them into shapes and bought some icing in a tube and just covered them haphazardly, and they flew off the dish.  I probably got about 2-3 dozen from the original recipe.

I was skeptical about the butterscotch pudding but these are delicious, milder than traditional gingerbread cookies.  The dough is quite soft and sticky which made the unbaked cookies difficult to transfer to the sheets so I rolled them out on parchment paper.

I have not made gingerbread cookies in many years. When I saw this recipe I thought I would give it a try. The dough rolled well, but was a bit crumbly I added a touch of water and it was fine. I would like to make it again, but I will add some extra spices (some say to double the spices others added cloves and nutmeg) because it just lacked a bit of oomph. My 2 1/2 loved them, but he has never turned down a cookie in his life. I think they are worth trying again.

Awesome and easy recipe! I actually made gingerbread cowboys this year! I was nervous that my originally sticky dough would be tough to work with. However, it turned out just fine as long as I kept the bowl in the fridge when I was busy doing other things like taking cookies out of the oven! Keep lots of flour around to use while rolling. It all depends on humidity. Thanks!!

If you are not into the spicy gingerbread cookies, this recipe is for you! The cookie has the look of gingerbread, but not the bite of all the spices - the dough was easy to work with as well - whipped it up in about 10 minutes!

The cookies taste pretty good.  Found the dough really hard to work with, kept melting.  Some of my cookies really flattened out in the oven.  Could have been my fault, i'm know to use recipes as "guidelines".

As others have said, absolutely delicious!!  I just finished baking a double batch and got about 18 cookies with an average-sized gingerbread boy cutter.  My toddler and three year old loved them, as did my picky husband.  I used raisins for eyes and buttons and they were perfect!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made a test batch for our work Christmas cookie swap, and they were a total hit!  The only suggestion was to ice them to make them even better.  The butterscoth gives them a great flavor without being too "spicy" - I don't normally eat gingebread because of that reason.

Great recipe!  Definitely a keeper for future swaps!

These were sooo good and so easy. We had a XMAS party where everyone had to draw numbers for a gift exchange, made these into little snowmen, numbered each one with icing and a face, then wrapped in little baggies. Everyone drew one out of a basket. Worked great!! Now for valentines.....

Once again my favorite holiday cookie to make.  I double this recipe and I only get 30.  A lot of it depends on the size of the cookie cutter.  We also decorate using the Hershey semi-sweet candies in Christmas colors.  Makes for nice buttons and ice with a little indentation made with a spoon for the mouth.

This was great!!  Super easy, and a BIG hit with my friends.  I will definitely make this again.  I did add a little extra on the spices, and next time I will double the recipe because it only made about 18 cookies.

These were great cookies! My husband isnt a fan of gingerbread and he LOVED these! I took them to my daughter's preschool so they could build their own gingerbread men and there were none left! Her teacher was expecting a traditional gingerbread and was so impressed that the kids actually ate them! I got instant pudding by mistake and it worked just fine. I also didnt need to refrigerate the dough at all...it was perfect to work with.

These are easy & pretty good.  I used mini M&M's for eyes & buttons.  They don't have quite as much "bite" as regular gingerbread, but are great for kids to make & eat.

I made these with my 5-year-old niece.  She had a great time rolling the dough out and making different shapes.  It was extremely kid-friendly in preparation and taste. Very good and easy recipe! A keeper.

Very good tasting cookie. The dough was easy to make and cut the shapes out. The kids loved the flavor but I think I'd like them better unfrosted and undecorated. Icing doesn't seem to go too well with the ginger taste.

These cookies turned out great even though I was a little skeptical about the butterscotch pudding.  I am going to make again for a cookie exchange next month.

These are great and oh so easy.  My 11 year old daughter loves to bake and she had lots of fun making these.  She even invited friends over and made several batches.  Easy and delicious cookies.  We plan on making some for gifts this Christmas.

These were ok.  The taste is pretty good, but if you cook them for the whole time specified then they are really crunchy (I even cooked them at 325 degrees).  Maybe this is how all gingerbread cookies are...this is my first time making gingerbread anything...I am looking for something chewier.

These were fantastic!  Easy to work with and tasted great!  We decorated ours with mini M&M's instead of frosting and they were very yummy.  I also reduced baking time to about 8 minutes.  Will definitely make again and again.

I made it exactly as written.  It made probably a dozen large cookies (we made a variety of sizes).  When it is first mixed together it is very dry and crumbly.  Don’t worry it comes together after refrigerating and kneading.  I rolled them out between two pieces of parchment paper, no need for flour.  Then popped them in the freezer for a few minutes before baking to help them keep their shape.  They hardly spread at all.  Very mild gingerbread flavor.  I would actually add more spices next time.

So nice to be able to make gingerbread men for Christmas without having to buy molasses, and then trying to use it up after.  They have a nice gingerbread taste, too.

I made these in a pinch when I realized I was out of molasses but happened to have a box of butterscotch pudding mix in the pantry. The dough was easy to work with, but I was rather disappointed with the taste. I prefer a very traditional gingerbread flavor, and these just seemed bland. My daughter loved them, though. I also baked them for 8-10 minutes rather than 10-12 to prevent the edges from burning.

I’ve tried several gingerbread recipes over the years and this is my favorite! I didn’t make any changes and it turned out great. I normally prefer recipes that are ‘made from scratch’ as much as possible so I was hesitant at first due to the box of pudding. My family is pretty picky and they all loved these. So I will continue to use this recipe every Christmas season. Thank you for sharing it!

I never made gingerbread cookies before and I’m so happy I used this recipe! They are delicious! I added a simple royal icing after to add a little more sweetness but honestly they are great as is. Followed the recipe exactly but baked for 8 minutes. I think the full time definitely would’ve burnt them. The dough seems dry after first taking from the fridge just let it rest at room temperature for about five minutes and it’s good to go. I also split my dough in three batches leaving the batch I wasn’t using refrigerated because it does get very soft fast.

These were pretty good, I did add some extra ginger and cinnamon and a dash of salt. The flavor is still not as strong as regular gingerbread, but we did enjoy them. The batch size is rather small, I had to make 2 batches to end u with a little more than I would normally expect from one.
I will likely make these again, especially with the smaller batch size. Less quilt if I eat all of them.

Not as spicy as regular gingerbread but moist and delicious!  Most folks comments about dryness, I could see during mixing and after refrigeration but I just worked the dough a little more then I usually would and the butter warmed right up and added the moisture needed.

I had to make some sturdy cutter cookies of 3 types that would not all break apart when I flew on a plane to Kansas. Theme was related to Wizard of Oz, so I found cutters and searched for a few good recipes. 

This one became the flying monkeys. 

I added some Fireball whiskey and extra seasonal spices. It seems that it was a bit more moist then the original recipe described. So even though I froze them before cooking they spread out a bit. It did not matter. Because fatter monkeys fly better! LOL!

Result was a few broke but not badly, legs are thinner. I used broken pieces for tasting for the silent auction. Total brought in forty dollars to a non profit for the late deafened. This is totally worth trying again.

Disclaimer: I have never eaten nor made gingerbread before. My daughter read the book The Gingerbread Man and asked to make our own gingerbread men so I chose this recipe. Made it exactly as written and it turned out great! The dough was easy to work with and the cookies were not too hard or too soft. I could taste the ginger but it was mild, so if you're looking for a spicier cookie this may not be it for you. My kids loved them!

Yummy, but not good for cut out cookies. I improvised the spices to my families liking and everyone liked them. However these cookies rise while cooking and stay pretty soft, so they weren't great as traditional gingerbread men cookies.

These came out so tasty! I took the advice of another reviewer and used my hands to mix the wet and dry ingredients otherwise it seems too dry to mix with a spoon. I accidentally grabbed instant pudding mix but it didn'tseem to be a problem at all. I also didn't have any ground ginger on hand only pumpkin pie spice. The mild gingerbread flavor is perfect for my family, my four year old loved them! They baked perfectly!

When baking my gingerbread cookies I found 10 minutes was to long. 8 minutes is perfect. They taste great and so simple to make. This is a keeper. Also the icing is wonderful. I recommend to use both.

Great recipe! I tried a different gingerbread recipe before and as I baked the other ones, they spread out really wide and the shapes were distorted.  With this recipe, the cookies really held their shape! I’m making these from now on!

I make these cookies for my kindergarten classes every year after reading many versions of the "Gingerbread Man" story. They love them. As many have mentioned  before, most kids do not like true gingerbread.  So this recipe is really great for those who aren't big fans of gingerbread... like me and quite a few 5 year-olds.  :)

We made these tonight instead of buying a gingerbread house kit. Came out PERFECT!  Baking for 10 minutes gave it a soft texture the kids could nibble on. The full 15 minutes made them sturdy to frost and build from. I may go a little lighter on the ground ginger, but that is just personal preference.

I had to add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. The dough was very dry and crumbly. I also added 1/4 teaspoon salt because I used unsalted  butter.

A great gingerbread cookie dough. The butterscotch pudding softens the flavor and leaves these cookies nice and soft, chewy... A great cookie for those that do not like a harsh or spicy gingerbread.

This was a total fail. I'm not rating it lower because I may have been at fault. I used instant pudding instead of cook and serve because that is what my store carries- other reveiwes

Fantastic!! I made the dough with my 5 year old and it turned out great. I did use instant pudding only because I can not read and purchase the wrong ingredients. Oops.  These came out perfectly and are amazing!! Perfect balance of spice for the little ones yet the ginger taste is still present. The dough was crumbling at first but came together in the end. Our gingerbread people were a little thin and cooked in 8 minutes. This just became a new holiday tradition for our family thank you for an amazing recipe!

These cookies are phenomenal!!! Do not refrigerate dough more than 1 hour and don’t use too much flour when rolling it out. I got 14 medium gingerbread men out of this. I’m not usually a gingerbread fan but I will make these every year!!

I accidentally added nearly twice the amount of cinnamon and ginger but it turned out really good, so I will continue to make the recipe with the additional amounts. I'm glad I read the previous reviews and knew the dough doesn't ball together. The dough was very crumbly (I used my kitchenmaid mixer) but I followed others suggestions and just packed it together into a ball. Once I smooshed it all up, it stayed together. Rolled out very nice, hardly needed any flour on my table or rolling pin. The first batch was slightly too brown, so I reduced the time in the oven to 9 minutes and they are perfect. Will definitely make again.

Oh my goodness!!! I’d never made gingerbread before this recipe, so I had no idea how they’d turn out. I was able to make the recipe so easily, followed it to a T, while my 1 year old son was crying under my feet, and they still came out AMAZING! He ate them, and even my dad who doesn’t like gingerbread said they tasted really good! I’ll definitely be using this recipe again!

Made this for fun during the Christmas season and it turned out pretty good. I had to use about a 1/4 cup more butter to make the dough not so dry but turned out good. Family liked them and I had fun decorating them! Lol

These turned out fantastic.

Since I am not from America I couldn't get my hands on butterscotch pudding mix, so instead I got vanilla and decided to add the butterscotch flavour with a butterscotch cream alcohol, adding a touch more flour to maintain the correct consistency. I also used nutmeg instead of cinnamon as I prefer it, and the cookies turned out great.

I will definitely be using this recipe again with my previous changes and probably doubling or even tripling the amounts as the batch makes only a few decent sized cookies and not quite enough for a group of adults together or a self-admitted sugar lover, I think the amount goes well if it is just yourself and possibly some small children snacking on them though.

I think a frosting using the butterscotch alcohol and regular vanilla frosting mix would do wonders on these too, with maybe a touch of nutmeg.

I wanted to make a simple gingerbread that I could add to my holiday cookies (I never cared for gingerbread when I was a kid but I wanted to try them again) and I am so glad I found this! Once I told people that these were a softer cookie, they were a complete hit. I made DOZENS of them for everyone! I took them to a cookie exchange at my job and my coworkers referred to them as "ginger crack" because they were SO good! :)  I do have a few suggestions: First, watch the video on here. Use dark brown sugar. Don't over mix your dough or it will make your cookies tough! Chill your dough until it is very firm, and keep it in the fridge between batches. Role your dough out between sheets of wax paper sprinkled with flour (again - don't over mix when you collect your extra dough after cutting). Finally, use parchment paper instead of spraying your pan to make clean up a breeze! Enjoy!

Boy these taste fantastic!!!  I didn't change anything to the recipe, my kids loved them--we made them for Christmas.  I cooled the dough but it was still sticky, but I used enough flour under the dough and on top while using cookie cutters so it worked fine for me.  

My kids found it too sticky to work with even with the flour, so they did another cookie dough, but I'm really good at working with sticky dough so I had no problem with it.  I will use this again next year!

These are perfect, delicious and easy, which I love! I've made these twice in two days. I just wish they made more per batch because they go so quickly at my house.

This is an easy gingerbread cookie I've been using for a few years now. The cookies come out soft and taste great.

These cookies are horrible. They had a nice consistency but were inedible ....not sweet enough to call a cookie.

I really love these gingerbread cookies and they've become a holiday staple at my house!  I didn't use to like gingerbread, but these soft, sweet cookies changed my mind.  They're easy to make, and they are softer and sweeter than normal gingerbread.  Icing them is a must.  I just used a simple powdered sugar and milk glaze and piped it onto the cookies.  Word of Wisdom:  If you're not good at decorating cookies, go for the snowflake cookie cutters instead of gingerbread men.  It's so much easier to just pipe straight lines across the snowflakes and they turn out really pretty!

Always a hit!!  Dark pan produces best results, stay on low end (10 min) for softness, and be sure to let the pan cool to room temp before moving to cookie to a cooling rack to harden.  Perfection!!

i was looking for a milder gingerbread cookie for my kid's kindergarten class. This for the bill! The dough was easy to work with. The batch wasn't very big. I 5x the recipe and it all fit in my 6quart kitchenaid mixer. I suspect it will make about 50 gingerbread men but I haven't finished baking yet.

I have made this for several years. At first it was because it seemed easy and I was intimidated by other gingerbread recipes.  Then it was because the kids love them and request them every year.  Finally it is because when I make the molasses ones I have molasses left over for a year, throw it out and buy more for the next year.  With this recipe I get kid friendly gingerbread and no leftover ingredients to waste.

I veganized the recipe by using plant based butter and soy milk. I also didn't have any vegetable oil, so I used coconut oil instead. It came out great!

Wow, this is so much easier using the butterscotch pudding and they come out delicious.  I have made gingerbread from molasses and it is much more expensive and time consuming. It rolled nice after I got it out of the fridge and worked the dough a little bit. I was able to get a good number of cookies out of one batch. This was my first test batch and they were so good that I am using this for an upcoming cookie exchange.  It isn't straight up gingerbread tasting but that is probably better since some people don't gingerbread.

Great recipe, tasted even better than the ones I made with Molasses. After rolling, the shapes could easily be cut out of the chilled dough, and they tasted delicious when finished.

Because another reviewer cautioned that these didn't taste like traditional gingerbread men, I added about 2T of molasses. That did the trick! Yum! I like that  they are a bit on the soft side; I prefer a softer cookie to a crunchy one. Enjoy!

My picky 5 year old was stuck on having gingerbread cookies for Christmas. I was worried he wouldn't like the Ginger flavor so I tried this recipe since it also used the pudding and he loved them. I'm not a big fan of gingerbread cookies but I liked these. Thanks for sharing!

Patience is the key when mixing these. This is the third Christmas we've made these. Really not fussy! Great flavor and texture. The third rolling still make viable cookies that are more "puffy" and soft. I do bake them on parchment.

Delicious!  Great texture and flavor.  I don't love the super molassesy flavor of some gingerbread.  This one is more of a ginger snap flavor but a nicer texture.  I used vanilla pudding because Publix was out of butterscotch.

Made the exact recipe, no changes. I served these at a party and the plate was cleared before the chocolate chip cookies.  Yummy! Everyone really liked these  gingerbread cookies. The kids helped make and decorate. Super easy and they didn't take a long time to make! I will make this recipe again!

I love this recipe. I made 'Ninja Bread Men' for my son's karate instructor. They were so delicious, I had to make another batch because everyone ate the first batch before I could get them to the instructor.  They don't taste like traditional gingerbread but they are wonderful.

Great cookie! Easy to make... and like other reviewers, I baked them for only 8 minutes. I used parchment paper to roll them out (place the dough between two layers of parchment paper) instead of flour. I also combined a package of instant butterscotch pudding with cook and serve vanilla pudding. I did not chill the dough at all -- no time -- and it really didn't make any difference that I could tell. Will make again.

It's a really nice, easy recipe to make. Even without the molasses, I really enjoyed the taste! The recipe is very mild as the 'ginger' part of gingerbread goes, which is good for kids. If you want a stronger gingerbread flavour add a bit more ginger and nutmeg  to suit your taste.

Loved it.  I have a recipe from a pastry chef that I've used in the past that is quite good; however, I need something quicker and easier. My other recipe creates delicious cookies, but it is time consuming and the dough is tough to work with and cookies are sometimes brittle. This recipe was quick , easy to work with, and surprisingly delicious!

I don't like hard cookies and these come out super soft. They are also not overly gingery, which I like. Very yummy!

These cookies were a big hit at Thanksgiving and Christmas.  My husband and the kids loved them. The kids love to decorate them too. We will make these every year.

I liked it a lot! And I'm definitely doing them again every year for Christmas but what if I try to change the recipe? I need just a bit less cookies but I don't know what 7/8 of an egg means, neither with the butterscotch. This is a very wonderful recipe! I definitely recommend it!

It doesn't get anymore simple than this. What a winning recipe! I love it. The cookies turned out beautiful with a nice, mild gingerbread flavor. This is a keeper and a must try for easy Christmas gingerbread cookies! I wouldn't change anything, this recipe is just wonderful.

Made this recipe because it sounded easy.  I made the cookies after work to take along on a visit with our grandkids.  They love to decorate and are so excited about Christmas this year.  These were the easiest gingerbread cookies I've ever made.  The dough was super easy to work with.  It didn't get as hard as traditional gingerbread.  Nice and crisp, but not break your teeth hard. All in all, a good recipe.

Kid approved! My sons first grade class was doing a gingerbread man unit and the teacher wanted gingerbread cookies for them to decorate. I used this recipe because it seemed kid friendly. I was a HIT! Even the pickiest eaters in the class ate them.

This was an awesome recipe and very easy to follow. I did make a tweak by adding nutmeg. I really appreciate the easiness of being able to roll the dough; however, didn't make as many cookies as mentioned, but nevertheless I will use this recipe again.

The process of making the cookies was a little hard. I did have to substitute the instant pudding so maybe that was the problem but as I kept on cutting out the cookies the dough started crumbling too much. Otherwise the cookies were delicious.

I'm not quite sure what I did wrong, but this recipe was very crumbly and almost impossible to roll. I made less than 2 dozen from a double batch. I suspect it could be my fault for using the no sugar, instant butterscotch pudding - it's all the store had and I had time to locate. The taste is very pleasant though.

The name of this cookie recipe should definitely be changed.... Maybe Butterscotch Gingerbread men, even. THESE ARE NOT GINGERBREAD. Just so everyone knows. Also the recipe needs a few adjustments for dryer climates... this recipe is extremely dry and crumbly in dryer climates...fyi

I was a little reluctant to try this recipe with the boxed pudding bat am glad I did! I have three teen aged grandsons and two sons-in-law who LOVED these! Most liked them plain from the oven. One liked them liberally dusted in powdered sugar. We rolled and cut out the first batch but they went so fast that I simply rolled the dough into a log, chilled it to firm it and sliced it into 1/4" discs. The boys didn't even notice!  Thanks for a keeper!

Boy, I feel like I missed something.  I found the dough to be crumbly, a little challenging to roll out; when I opted for the 8 minute timer, I found some of the thicker cookies underdone, when I applied a longer time, they became very crispy and most important, all very bland.  I was opting for a gingerbread version that wasn't as spicey, but this cookie is really very bland.  Dry, cripsy and bland.  Different strokes for different folks, I suppose.  I'm going to attempt to cover them in icing to see if the additional moisture will help to soften and spark some life, but I think I might actually throw these out.  Don't want anybody to break a tooth or anything.

Made over 100 of these cookies last night for a cookie party I'm going to tonight...I picked the recipe because it seemed simple and they were! So easy to handle and make. They are FANTASTIC! The dough was extremely easy to work with. I don't really understand what those who said the dough was flaky and impossible to work with did wrong...They also had a great gingery flavor without being overwhelming. My boyfriend loved them and loved helping me decorate. He wants to make gingerbread houses now!!

I'm not a big gingerbread fan, but I made it for my family because they love it. Had a little bite and really enjoyed it since the ginger wasn't as strong as the traditional ginger cookie recipes. I also used instant pudding since my store didn't carry the cook and serve and it still turned out. I will b using this recipe from now on. I might try vanilla pudding next time to see the difference with the cook and serve makes.

Easy and delicious! I made a huge batch of these for a school activity and the preschool teacher kept the leftovers! These are better tasting than any gingerbread that I've tasted. I'm assuming that the butterscotch pudding can be substituted with any flavor of pudding. I think a pistachio cookie would be amazing!

I honestly was worried that I wouldn't be able to work with the dough since it seemed very crumbly. But everything worked out, and they came out great, although I would bake them for 8-9 minutes next time.

This was a good cookie, moist and delicious, held up great during decorating.  However, if you are looking for a "True tasting" Gingerbread cookie, this cookie misses the mark.  I will make these again for an alternative cookie, but I will stick to a more traditional recipe for gingerbread cookies as I love true gingerbread flavor.

LOVE this! So easy and tastes great. The dough does appear very dry and crumbly. Don't get discouraged! I used my hands to ball up and then refrigerated for 1 hour. Turned out perfect. Agree with other reviewers, 9 minutes was perfect for me.

I love the simplicity of this recipe.  Quick to make, rolled nicely, smells great, and mild tasting but didn't hold up its shape like I wanted to especially the xmas trees.  It almost formed a triangle lol.  I probably didn't measure my flour right or maybe it needed more like 1/4+ cup? It's okay though, it's delicious and soft.  I made 14 3" cut outs and 7 tablespoon drop cookies (rolled in sugar and powdered sugar.

What an EASY recipe!!! My daughter doesn't like gingerbread men cookies because they are too "spicy" but she LOVED these!!  Instead of butter I used 1/2 c butter flavor crisco and added 3 tsp of milk. I also used powdered sugar to dust the rolling in and rolling surface.  It adds a little extra sweetness to the cookie. We made them about 1/4" thick and baked for 10 minutes.  They turned out nice and soft.  We frosted with a powdered sugar glaze (1 c powdered sugar and 1 1/2 Tbsp milk).  This will now be a Christmas must!

It was ok. They are not soft. They smelled really good while baking and after removing from the oven but hard cookies. Not a fan of crunchy cookies. Will not make again. Only part of it I really liked is they turned out well in form but to eat, nah.

Excellent cookies! If you are looking for a gingerbread recipe that simply doesn't use molasses but tastes just like gingerbread, then don't try this recipe. Like many other reviewers said, this is like gingerbread for people who don't like gingerbread. My son, who hates gingerbread, gobbled them up!

We also made a gingerbread house with this yesterday and it turned out wonderfully. The pieces for the house had to be baked for longer than stated, and the gingerbread men and trees had to be baked for less time. Just keep an eye on them and you will not be disappointed.

This is a keeper for us. It's now going to be a part of our regular holiday baking. Thanks, Kim!

These are delicious and so much fun to make.  They have just enough ginger to get the flavor but are not overpowering like many gingerbread cookies.  My children love to help make the shapes, and this dough works well whether you want a crispy cookie or a cookie that stays soft, depending on your cooking time.  I have requests for these every year.

tried this recipe and it is great! I doubled the recipe and added 1/2 tsp more ginger than called for and they turned out delicious plain, without any sweet icing or chocolate decorating the top!Will be making these for my daughters class Christmas party and decorating like reindeer. Baked for 8 1/2 minutes turned out soft yet firm with a crunchy edge.

I really loved these cookies.  I messed up and rolled the first batch a little too thin... They still tasted great but where more like crackers.   However the 2nd batch into the oven were amazing.   I will take what is left with me to work tomorrow or I'll eat the whole batch myself.

absolutely delicious! however, I did add a teaspoon baking power, added some vanilla pudding as well as butterscotch, and added a teaspoon pumpkin spice to the recipe and it was spectacular. Plus, this recipe yields the perfect amount of cookies and its pretty easy :)i recommended chocolate ganache on them :D

Excellent! I made these with my kids (ages 5 and 2). They loved the taste. Not too spicey. I even added a touch more cinnamon and ginger and a dash of clove to make sure they were 'ginger' flavored! The only problem I had was that the dough was VERY sticky. I ended up adding another cup of flour to get the dough to come to a ball and probably another 1/2-3/4 cup to be able to roll them out after chilling and only working with small amounts of dough at a time. Thinnly rolled,this made almost 4 dozen cookies for us! They are very sturdy and great for decorating. If you want a softer cookie, roll them thicker and watch closely as they bake. I only baked ours for 5-6 min at 325. Definately a Holiday keeper!

I tried this recipe last year, and was so excited to make ginger bread boys like I remembered.  We were all getting together for Christmas cookie baking, and I was out of time, so my daughter found this recipe online and picked up the ingredients for me.  I didn't know till then that there were no molasses in the recipe.  It is a pretty good cookie recipe.

Love this recipe. I have a sensitive tummy, and most gingerbread is too strong for me. Now, with this I feel like Goldilocks, Juuuuuuuust right! :) Thank you! (I've made it with both instant and cook puddings - both worked well!)

We just tried this recipe and it was great!  I would definitely add a little more butter, because it was a little dry.  We used instant butterscotch pudding and that seemed to work fine.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I have made these for years, and it has become a tradition to make and decorate these with my kids.  The taste is more mild than the traditional gingerbread cookie, and the texture softer, depending how long they are baked.  It's almost like a mix between a gingerbread cookie and a sugar cookie.  The dough is so easy to roll and cut.  I have had success on one occasion freezing baked cookies until I had the time to thaw and decorate.  I give out cookies to friends every year, and didn't have these ready in time to include them last year.  I had several people ask about their absence.  I will be sure to include them this year :)

This recipe was perfect for the beginner gingerbread eaters-- it's not a particularly spice-y gingerbread cookie.  It also is soft, rather than being crunchy like a gingersnap.  This bakes like a soft sugar cookie, but with a gingerbread flavor.  I loved them and I get requests for them every year!

This recipe was wonderful!!!  Many in my family do not eat gingerbread cookies normally, but they ALL devoured these!  They taste just a good- if not better than a molasses version.  This recipe will now be a family traditon in our house!!!

These are so good!!  I followed the recipe exactly, chilled for one hour, and the dough was perfect!  It was not dry at all once you started working with it.  I also only got about 13 cookies instead of the 30.  I'm assuming it's because I used a larger cookies cutter, maybe 3 inches.  I only baked for 8 minutes and that was perfect.  Love love love this site - I have gotten so many awesome recipes!

This is a great recipe!  Super easy!  will definately become a tradition at christmas time with my girls!  I read some reviews and considered cooking less time than recommended, but I use a baking stone which generally requires a few extra minutes of baking anyways, 10 mins was a perfect time if using a baking stone.  I got them all baked off, can't wait to decorate them tomorrow morning with my 3 year old :o)

These were perfect for my son's kindergarten Christmas party. Kids just loved them.  I used instant pudding mix(only one available at my local grocery store) and baked for 8 min only in my gas powered oven. When I pulled the though out of my fridge after over-night chilling, it was dry and hard to work with so I rubbed my hadns with butter and gave the though about 2 min of kneading.

I followed the recipe exactly but when I was trying to the form the dough, it was wayyy too dry! it seemed like there was wayyy too much dry ingredient ... so I ended up putting in a couple more tablespoons of butter and the constitency finally came around...and they were delish! Perhaps I didn't roll it out too much thick enough but I only backed them for about 8 minutes and they came out gorgeous and oh so yummy.  The package of butterscotch pudding mix I used had these little black bead like things in there and had no idea what they were but mixed it in anyway..and it turned out okay

I loved this recipe. I am a student and part-time worker w very little time to bake, but this is so easy and hassle free. When I made them I also added an egg glaze made of an egg yoke, a little water and a bit of salt. It made the cookies shine and looked more festive. Good luck!!

I wanted to like these.  The flavor is very mellow and I understand it is supposed to be be.  The real problem is the texture.  They aren't quite hard and aren't quite soft, leaving them the texture of a stale cookie.  Needs to be one or the other or the cookie is ruined.  I will look for a different recipe.

I don't know why people say this is a dry dough.  This is one of the stickiest doughs I have ever worked with.  While I do appreciate the fact that this isn't as strong as traditional gingerbread men, I would have to seriously think twice about making these again.  I did add 1 tsp of vanilla, and baked them for about 8 minutes instead of 10.  I chilled my dough in the fridge overnight, but it was still sticky.  The only thing that seemed to help was putting it in the freezer for about 10 minutes.

I liked these as far as gingerbread cookies go, but the dough WAS a little dry, producing a very crispy cookie. If I had it to do over, I probably would have chosen a more moist, traditionally textured cookie dough with the gingerbread spices instead, but if you're looking for a classic gingerbread recipe, this is it (and it's easy to do).

This is not a gingerbread cookie. It was too dry and did not taste like gingerbread at all. However, it was still ok tasting so I still rate it 3 stars. My 3 year old daughter likes them when she gets to dip it in milk to moisten them up!

I made these for my son's preschool class and they (and I) gobbled them up.  I don't have any experience making 'regular' gingerbread cookies, but these are a nice low spice/molasses tasting cookie.  Very good and I will make them again (definitely for christmas next year).****update 12/2010 -- made these 2x this year and I love them!  They are a very mellow ginger cookie.  I roll them very thin (1/8in) and bake about 9 min and they turn out nice and crispy.  I enjoy them this way as do my family.

I found this recipe very frustrating. There's just not enough liquid in it. It ends up to crumbly and it's nearly impossible to roll out to use cookie cutters. I'm a pretty good cook, and i can cook just about anything, so I'd like to know what I did wrong. So many people are raving about this recipe, and I just don't see where they get that it's "so easy" Don't get me wrong, the dough for the finished product is good. It's just not a good recipe for cookie cutters.

These cookies were great!! My boyfriend couldn't stop eating them. Somehow I put a cup of butter rather than 1/2 a cup and they still turned out amazing but the dough was hard to cut. I made my own icing as well to put on top(icing sugar, vanilla, milk) and then sprinkled some decorative colour sugar on top of that. they were good like that but they are good with nothing on them as well. I may add a little more ginger next time but they were a big hit with my friends and family so i will definitely be making these this year for christmas! thanks for the recipe!

These cookies were not, as many people have stated, easy to work with at ALL.  The dough was dry and crumbly.  After fighting with it for two roll-outs I finally dumped some milk in it and mixed it up with my hands.  That made it manageable, but I was so tired of working with it at that point that it wasn't fun anymore.  The final product was just ok.  There are barely two dozen somewhat bland-tasting cookies.  I say skip this one...

I used instant pudding instead of ready to cook. The cookies were very easy to make, but I thought they lacked in flavor a bit (even after adding extra ginger and cinnamon)

These are the best!  My 4 year old daughter and I made them for her class and she was able to help make them.  They have a nice flavor, too - a good mix between a traditional gingerbread and sugar cookie.  Yummy and cute!  One thing I would add - I used my Wilton comfy grip cookie cutter and the recipe made 1 1/2 dozen.  Thanks for sharing!

YUM YUM YUM!  These cookies are great tasting and great to work with. They are just spicy enough to classify as gingerbread, and great for kids.  Even with sugar-free pudding, they were great.  It didn't know it would be so hard finding butterscotch!  We decorated them with a frosting that hardens, and it was a fun family activity.

these cookies were great!  i love how it doesn't require all these random ingredients.  i was a little bummed about how the shape of the cookies turned out.  i actually used a snowflake cookie cutter, and the cookie came out like a flower, instead of a snowflake.  but it's ok, because i was able to save the cookie with piping the decorations.  i also baked them for 7 minutes, and let them rest on the cookie sheet for 2 mintues after removing them from the oven.  overall, everyone was pleased, and the cookies tasted great!

I like that these cookies are more 'mild' than normal gingerbread and they are more soft also. They rolled out very well and I has no issues at all! I made my usual butter cream cookie frosting and frosted them. Will definitely make again.

I'm not a fan of super spicy/gingery gingerbread cookies, and I don't often make gingerbread so I didn't want to go out and buy molasses, so this was a perfect recipe! I couldn't find butterscotch pudding so I used vanilla and they turned out great. Tasted like a chewy sugar cookie with a hint of ginger--perfect! I recommend rolling them out on parchment paper and baking for 10-11min to minimize mess and keep the cookies soft. My friends and I had a blast decorating--and eating--these! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe last Christmas and fell in love with it.  Molasses is often way too  messy and using Butterscotch pudding is a great alternative.  

I'll be sure to use this one year after year!

This recipe makes a great alternative for those who want to love gingerbread cookies, but hate molasses!  I baked mine for 8 minutes exactly and turned out a pleasantly softer cookie with just a little crispness around the sides.  And that's a good thing for those of us who hate to break their teeth on a treat!

Ugh this recipe was a pain. It was easy to get all the ingredients together but I was having a hard time getting the baking time right. I made two whole batches and I think my last couple trays of cookies were okay, but there were countless burned ones and undercooked ones. It was hard to tell when they were "just right" until they were cooled. I'm just making the traditional ones next year.

This recipe made Christmas extra special for me and my grandchildren. These cookies were easy to make. I didn't make the royal icing in time so they didn't have all the trimmings, but they had the cinnamon candy buttons. We loved them! This was the first time we ever had homemade gingerbread cookies at our Christmas gathering. Thanks so much, Kim.

My son and I made the recipe as stated and it turned out perfect and delicious. Way better than trying to make them the old way...they had a nice flaver.

I made this with my siblings, younger cousins, and boyfriend and it was fun to make. I did have a problem with the fact that it didn't stick together, but we added extra water (1 tablespoon at a time- couldn't have been more than 4 tablespoons) and let my fellow youngin's get a try at rolling the dough out and cutting out the shapes with the cookie cutter. No one wanted to eat them because they were so adorable after decorating them with gumdrops, M&M's, Mini Kisses, and different colored icing. We had so much fun food coloring the icing! Eventually, everyone got a taste of them and gobbled them up. We didn't get many cookies though. Next time will make more batches at a time.

WOW!! The best gingerbread cookie I've ever made.  Not good for houses-too soft but as a cookie perfect, easy to make, stores well & freezes well.  Made a triple batch then had to make another double batch just before Christmas since my family kept sneaking them before I made up my cookie trays.  People are calling me raving about the gingerbread men- Thank you!! This is surely a keeper!

These went over really well and aren't too strongly flavored. Pretty easy to make but I could not chill my dough very long because it made it too hard to roll out. I will most likely make these again next year, which is the best compliment.

My 4-year-old son and I made these for Santa.  He had a blast rolling out the dough, cutting out the men, and then decorating them after they were cooked.  We taste tested them and they were delicious.  I think Santa liked them too because there were only crumbs left on Christmas morning.

OMG!  These are fantastic!  The only problem I had was I didn't make enough.  Even my 16-year-old daughter, who doesn't like gingerbread, loves them.  I didn't change anything in the recipe -- the cookies are not too gingery, easy to make, and taste incredibly yummy!  Enjoy!

I just love these cookies.  The flavor is subtly spicy and sweet, and my husband and I get to team up to make them, as I like to bake them and he enjoys decorating! Once our little one comes along, I suspect these will be a nice family tradition for us.  Thanks for posting!

Very yummy cookies! The dough kept sticking to my countertop, so make sure you use plenty of flour. Also, if you roll the dough as thin as 1/8", these taste more like butterscotch graham crackers. They don't need frosting... but they are ADDICTIVE! I used Mini M&Ms for decorating. This is a keeper! THANK YOU!

So yummy- with or without frosting on top! Doubled the spices and added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg. Baked for 8-9 minutes.
Great recipe. Fun with the kids! Will make again next year!

We made Eilen's Spicy Gingerbread Men a few weeks back and thought they were great (but spicy, just like the recipe says). Then today we gave this recipe a whirl. It was terrific.

The dough was very brittle, almost dry and made about a dozen and half 4 inch men for us. We don't roll our dough very thin because of preschool age children break very thin cookies much easier! The taste was top notch. Not spicy, but just warm and yummy. I was surprised I couldn't taste a strong butterscotch flavor, it was there, but very subtle. 

I must also disclaim I used instant pudding instead of cook and serve as the recipe called. I didn't do this intentionally, but b/c I didn't copy the ingredients down to my shopping list correctly. I will try it with the cook and serve version and re-review.

These cookies tasted great and my kids and I had a blast making them (and eating them).  I really liked not having to deal with sticky molasses or maple syrup with the kids.

I wasn't able to get the "cook and serve" pudding mix in butterscotch and ended up hoping for the best with three 1oz boxes of "instant" mix.  My dough turned out crumbly at first, but I added another half a stick of butter and it turned out beautifully.  

I also used the icing recipe posted by the reviewer AUTUMNJOY and that also turned out great.  I like that it doesn't have raw egg in it like royal icing recipes usually do. It tastes great, too. I gave each kiddo a ziplock with a tiny corner cut off and we all decorated.  I used regular vanilla extract, but this would be a good recipe for the clear if you have it around.  There was a slight tint to ours, but you really couldn't tell once it was on the cookies.

These were excellent and very easy.  I doubled the batch and made 45 gingerbread men.  I cut them thin so they were nice and crisp.  The only change I made was to add a couple shakes of cloves into the flour mixture.

I made these for my son's school party. I figured the kids would prefer a less spicy flavor, and these fit the bill. We put frosting and candy on them, so the mild sweetness of the cookies was perfect. 

I quadrupled the recipe and got about 70 3" cookies in the gingerbread shape. I normally find rolled cookies very frustrating, but these were really easy. Using two cookie sheets and parchment paper, I was able to roll and bake all 70 in less than two hours.

This recipe lacks gingerbread flavor. The texture came out quite snappy, which was quite nice and I can taste the butterscotch. However, this is NOT a gingerbread cookie!

Dough turned out perfect -- it was soft but not sticky at all.  The cutouts had a nice light spice flavor.  I used mini cookie cutters and poked holes through a bunch to make little ornaments.

Great recipe!  I have been using this recipe for years now and I make these for my son's birthday.  His former teachers start hounding him every year because they can't wait for me to send in "extras".  They always turn out perfect and are easy to roll and cut.  I decorate them with M&Ms and white icing.  *You can use instant pudding mix but they're not quite as good.

Yum! I tried these out of curiosity because the recipe was so unlike my traditional molasses or ginger cookies, so I wasn't expecting much. I was surprised at how easy they were to stir together, how nicely they rolled out, and how tastey they were when finished. I didn't roll my dough quite so thin so the cookies were a little more chewy. Really great recipe...thanks for sharing!

I liked this a lot,or atleast more than most sugar cookie recipes.I am going to use this as my rolled cookie recipe for decorative cookies this year. Not really strong ginger flavor, but it is there. I don't usually like gingersnaps either!

I really loved this recipe! I've been searching for the perfect gingerbread cookie recipe, and this is it. I did follow the suggestion of a preview reviewer and melted the butter first, which seemed to help. Chilling in the fridge for an extra hour also helped, as the second time I made this, I only chilled for an hour and the gingerbread men started coming apart when I would pick them up to place on the cookie sheets. Also, I did not bake for any longer than minutes as the do harden quite a bit as the are cooling. Great recipe!!!

This recipe was so easy and delicious! It does not have a strong ginger taste but that's why I like it. The dough may seem dry at first but the proportions worked otu fine after a lot  of mixing. Kids will love this recipe!

The recipe was very easy to follow and turned out really well.  This is only the 4th or 5th time I've ever tried to make cookies, and they turned out well despite my usual tendency to destroy cookies.

This was a super easy recipe to follow and the cookies tasted amazing.  I made these with my husband and kids a couple days before Christmas and the whole batch was gone by the next day.  I would definately double or probably triple the recipe though - we only got about 8 big gingerbread men out of this recipe and they are so good I will make more next time.  This recipe is a absolutely a keeper!

great recipe!  I love how there's no molasses and the gingery taste is not too overpowering.  this is a great recipe for kids but for those who are big ginger fans, i'd increase the amount of ginger powder or add some crushed crystalized ginger for a more tasty bite.

I had a lot of trouble rolling out the dough.  Maybe I didn't refrigerate them long enough?  It was a real hassle cuz the dough stuck to the cutting board, but the taste and mixture of spices and butterscotch pudding was excellent.  i will make these again but will refrigerate them longer and maybe add some more flour

Tastes great and super easy! Definitely something you want to try if you don't like gingerbread cookies with too much spice in it. I tweaked it a little by adding ground cloves and a little more ginger. I would suggest doubling the recipe b/c it doesn't make that many.

I made these cookies with my kids and they loved them! We usually make gingerbread cookies because they are fun to make but then we don't eat them. These were easy, fun, delicious and kid friendly. We will make these soft cookies yearly as tradition.

Very tasty, and not as spicy as other recipes for gingerbread cookies.  I liked them much better!

These cookies were great!  Having never made gingerbread before, and not being a big fan of molasses, I was excited to try these.  My kids loved them, even my two year old who doesn't eat anything!  I have had several people ask for the recipe.  A big hit with everyone!

It was my first time making cookies from scratch and i"m glad I started with this one. It was easy and fun to make, even for a highschool student. It freaked me out when I mixed the butter, sugar, and the pudding mix, but it turned out fine. I would suggest baking them about 8 minutes instead of 10-11 minutes. I also made them 1/4 inch thickness, and it tasted better. [i read it in one of the reviews for this idea. thank you.]. My family loved it, and i've already received requests to make more. I'm excited to make more of them this year. Thank you for this recipe. :]

For a first time gingerbread man maker, this recipe was incrediblely simple and delicious!  My children...notoriously anti-spicy anything...loved these cookies.  No need to ice, they were great as is.  Definitely heed the advice...do not overbake.

These cookies taste great! My dough was very sticky and difficult to work with but it had been raining here for four days straight so the humidity was very high. I also used that new soft baking butter and it might have made my dough less firm. I'm trying them again next week with regular margarine.

I have used this recipe for more than 15 years for my gingerbread cookies. It is the easiest recipe and *always* gets compliments. These cookies are positively addicting.

These cookies cookies were extrememly easy to make, and tasted pretty good.  However, I don't think I'd make them again, as the texture was not the best, and I really do miss the molasses flavor (the ginger flavor is quite apparent, though).

Not the best gingerbread I've ever had. Needs more cinnamon and ginger.  Convenient because it does not need molasses.

I'm not a big fan of gingerbread, I made these at my children's request.  I thought they tasted fine for gingerbread, and my husband and children both liked them.  I really thought the dough was wonderful to work with and they baked up really nice.  I will make these again.

These cookies were a huge success!  I read a few of the other reviews and increased the amount of spices...they turned out wonderfully!  This recipe is one that I will use for Christmas year after year.

I was looking for ideas for my Christmas baking and this was a great recipe. I found the dough easy to work with and the taste and texture were great. Even my husband who doesn't like gingerbread loved these. I sprinkled them with colored sugar instead of icing them and used several different cookie cutters. We especially liked the ones I made with a candy cane shaped cookie cutter, I sprinkled alternating stripes of red and green colored sugar and they were the most impressive looking treats on my cookie tray.

My son wanted to make gingerbread cookies for Christmas and these were perfect for a 6 year old.  A very mild cookie.  Kind of a cross between a gingerbread and a sugar cookie.  Also very easy for little ones to roll and cut out.

Excellent texture; crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. But I found the dough too dry and crumbly to work with. Adding some kind of liquid next time might help with that.  I also doubled all of the spices with good results, and added a teaspoon of cloves.

Simply delicious.  I don't particularly like the molasses flavor in most gingerbread cookies, so I was glad to finally find one that didn't need molasses.  They were moist, yet slightly crisp, which is, in my opinion, the way a gingerbread cookie should be.  I do a lot of Christmas baking and these were a perfect addition to my cookie platter.  Not too spicy, just perfect.  You'll love these.

These cookies were wonderful!  We are going to use this recipe for my daughters' (ages 5 and 8)annual cookie decorating party.  It was very easy, and the cookies were excellent!  Thanks for a great recipe!  This is already a family favorite for us.

Used this recipe last Christmas, had many compliments. Going to use it again only to make a whole lot more. Not too spicy for the little ones and so easy make!!!!
*DEPENDING ON THE THICKNESS OF THE COOKIE, YOU WILL HAVE TO ADJUST THE COOK TIME* I found 9 minutes was around the ideal time for the cookies I make.

Wow! These were delicious. I'll admit, when they first came out of the oven, I wasn't too impressed. However, the next day these cookies were awesome! I made them for my prekindergarten class to teach about body parts.  The kids loved the cookies and talked about what a good cook their teacher was. LOL! It was fun for hubby and I to decorate them together.:-)  Enjoy!!

An ingenious recipe!  The cookies were quick and easy to make, and I thought the end result was soft and delicious.  I added some extra pumpkin pie spice for extra flavor.

These were a hit! This cookie will be part of a new tradition in my family.  I can't stand the smell of molasses, so the butterscotch was a wonderful stand-in:-)  It does not ruin the integrity of the cookie, either, that ginger taste is still there and wonderful!

This dough was very easy to work with and produces a nice looking cookie.  I guess I must be a traditionalist-I do miss the flavor of a "real" gingerbread cookie.  My kids however, loved them, so that is a good thing-I will make them again but keep them for the kids.  Great idea with the pudding though, an easy and quick recipe.  Thanks for sharing.
