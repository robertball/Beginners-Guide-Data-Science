Yum. I don't know what else to say! The combination of the sweet apple sausage, the tangy goat cheeese, the tangy yet sweet blueberries, and the dressing, with the added crunch of the pecans was just spectacular. I could see this working with strawberries, almonds, the al fresco blueberry sausage...so many possibilities! This was quick and easy to prepare and very healthy!

I tried the vinaigrette that's suggested and the honey just didn't work for me.  I swapped it out and used Lyle's golden syrup instead - I also used glazed walnuts - amazing gourmet salad!  Also feel free to use the breakfast version of the Apple maple sausage (it's the same thing but the sausages are smaller - and a plus they're cheaper!)

We really enjoyed this salad! My grocery was out of fresh endive, so I selected a mix with endive included. Also the al fresco (R) brand is not available in my area, so I opted for an alternate brand of fully-cooked apple-chicken sausage. I toasted walnuts to replace the pecans and feta for the goat cheese, because they're what I had on hand. The dressing is delicious even without oil! You could change this up so easily with various fruits/nuts/cheeses, even other meats - makes for a great lunch with a lovely presentation.

I really enjoyed this.  I was a little worried about the dressing since there wasn't much too it.  All of the flavors went together nicely.  A very bright and flavorful salad.

This was ok, but we really didn't care for warm sausages on a cold salad.  It would be better if you brought your greens and blueberries to room temp first.  I felt it also could've used more pecans and greens compared to the amount of sausage.  Had to skip the cheese (no goat cheese during pregnancy).  Not sure I'd make this again though.

Wow, this is really delicious!  (I didn't buy the brand mentioned, but the sausage was ok on the salad - just too salty for me.  Maybe I'm just not a fan of sausage.)  I added dried cherries the second time around, which increased the fabulousness of the salad. :)

VERY GOOD! All of the flavors complimented each other nicely, and the dressing, was just the finishing touch. I just used romaine lettuce b/c that's what I had on hand. The flavor of the sausage was great (my little guy LOVED the sausage)! This is something that I would absolutely make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

My husband, who is usually not a foodie, commented that this was the best combination of flavors and textures and he did not mind at all having a salad for dinner tonight.  He did not miss the usual meat-and-potatoes Saturday night dinner.

Perfect!! So very refreshing. Slightly sweet. A great change of pace from the same old boring salad. We absolutely loved it and it looks so good on the plate that I wouldn't hesitate serving it to company

Excellent, tasty, light and different!  This recipe is very forgiving and easily adjusted to personal tastes.  If you like blueberries, add more!  If you like walnuts, use them instead of pecans.  I used Romaine hearts instead of the endive, because that is what I had.  Not using oil in the dressing is a plus, for us.  I have to say, I liked it best when I had a bite that combined all the flavors!

Delicious salad! I loved the flavors of the warm meat with the blueberries and goat cheese. I was surprised how much I liked the dressing since honey is not one of my favorite foods, but it really is a great dressing for this particular salad. I will definitely make this salad again...even for company!

Low fat - refreshing and light.  This salad is perfect for a spring / summer brunch / lunch or dinner.  I was a little skeptical about the salad dressing as it has no oil - no worries, it doesn't need any.  I didn't have any goat cheese so I used some White Stilton that I had but Feta would be excellent too.    I can't say enough about how tasty these sausages are and all natural too.

So, my New Year's resolution was to start cooking for my family. My lovely wife cooks everything for us. So this was the first recipe I tried. I could not find the chicken sausage, so I used the target brand. My wife, who is kind of a foodie, loved it! It was the perfect balance so sweet and savory. And very healthy too!

Sweet, fancy summer salad.  It was a bit too sweet (honey).  I'd add less honey next time and more lettuce.  Serve with room temp blueberries and lettuce.

This was great!  I'm glad I read the Reviews or else I may not have given the dressing a try, and I'm glad I did because it was surprisingly good!  And like another Reviewer said, the best bite was one where you get all the ingredients together in one bite.  It is also very flexible; I only had Romaine lettuce, Strawberries (no blueberries), and Walnuts (no Pecans), so I subbed those.  Other than that I made it exactly as written.  Oh, I had another brand of gourmet Chicken Sausage on hand so I used that.  This is SO GOOD, and Good For You!!

Excellent! Made for a champagne brunch today and everyone loved it. I found an organic dressing (Bragg Healthy Vinaigrette) made from apple cider vinegar and honey that I used to save time. I also substituted honey roasted cashews instead of pecans and added some blueberry infused dried cranberries as suggested by another reviewer. Thanks for this recipe!

Didn't care much for sausage in the salad.  Might have been better if cut smaller.  Also, too much endive because it has a slight bitter taste.

Loved it. Used pork sausage and browned it a bit longer than in the recipe to get it nice and crunchy all over. Will definitely make again.

We really enjoyed this salad.  The dressing was perfect and no oil in it was an added bonus.  We had never strayed from using the Al Fresco Apple Chicken Sausage as just a sausage sandwich, but it was great in this salad.  This is a definite quick fix dinner keeper.

We thought that the al fresco sausage is very fresh and tasty but that it could be cut in thinner pieces.  The dressing was very good and surprising because of the fact that it didn't have any oil in it.  I had so many types of cheese that I didn't want to purchase yet another kind, so I opted for yogurt cheese which was well-suited for this recipe.  We would enjoy eating this salad again!

A nice light salad. I couldn't find endive so I omitted it and used Feta instead of Goat Cheese (again couldn't find it). The dressing is perfect in my opinion but I felt the salad would be better without cheese or the sausage. The Al Fresco Apple Sausage was good but I thought it would be better in something else.

This is a really good salad; quick, easy and healthy.  I made it with sweet Italian chicken sausage over a combination of spring greens and romaine with a generous amount of fresh blueberries.  Will definitely make this again.

Great idea for a fresh, simple and delicious salad.  Yes, like so many people on here, I "doctored up" the recipe.  I added spinach to the salad, added additional berries (strawberries, raspberries) and some halved grapes too!  I used a balsamic raspberry vinaigrette dressing.  The chicken/apple sausage (you could sub grilled chicken, but why?)  is phenomenal and the goat cheese adds just the right touch.  I had some fresh mozzarella on hand for people that don't go for the goat cheese...but it's just not the same for me!  Also had a loaf of french bread available so it was a complete meal!

Fantastic!  Loved the mix of sweet blueberries and dressing with savory sausage.  Filling for a salad, so consider smaller portions. Only downside was takes a whie to assemble compared to most salads. Definitely making again.

Hubs liked it more than I did.  The package of sausage gave the option of microwaving so I opted for that due to a time constraint.  The kids wouldn't touch the sausage and I didn't love it although it was better in the salad.  Next time I will def grill or brown it on the stove.  The dressing was ok....seemed to be missing something....?  I like the mix of ingredients and will try this one again.

The al fresco Sweet Apple Chicken Sausage in this salad is wonderful.  I don’t care for goat cheese so I substituted fresh mozzarella, and added a roughly chopped gala apple.  Healthy and delicious.
