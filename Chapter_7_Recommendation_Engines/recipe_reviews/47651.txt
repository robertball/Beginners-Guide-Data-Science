I have to say that after reading the reviews of this dish, I was really disappointed!  It was pretty bland by my stands and I really thought it lacked any good flavor.  My husband agreed.  Some mistakes I think I made after reading the other reviews:
I followed the recipe to the "T".  I boiled the chicken - I think I should have cooked it in olive oil and sauteed it a bit more.  
I boiled the veggies in the chicken broth - BIG MISTAKE - they were mushy and lacked all flavor. I think that those should also be more sauteed in some olive oil or very lightly steamed.  Cut the chicken broth out, it adds sodium and really doesn't help with the flavor.
The cream cheese mixture was not nearly as thick as I had hoped - I was thinking alfredo sauce and ended up with something more runny than that.  You could almost make this with some half and half and onions on your own.

Overall, I thought the dish was way too high in fat to be the "treat" I had hoped it would be.  Definetly spice it up.  Good luck!

YUM! However, thanks to the advice of previous reviewers, I altered the original a bit by doing the following:  Seasoned chicken breasts in cajun seasoning then sauteed in olive oil and 1 Tbs. minced garlic and 1/2 onion chopped.  Then cubed the meat rather than pulling.  For the sauce I added the other half of the chopped onion to the broth and broccoli.  I also only used one container of the cream cheese as it seemed rich enough at taste after the first, then added 1 cup heavy cream and 2 Tbs. flour as thickener in place.  Added cajun seasoning (tsp?) and the tasty browned onion-garlic goodness from the chicken pan to finish off the sauce.  Served over penne.

Super easy, extremely delicious, and seemingly flexible for variation.  A keeper for sure! THANKS for posting!

I made this for my family (husband & 2 boys 7 & 3)last night. They loved it.  I had to change a few things due to what I had available in my pantry.  First, I used Penne pasta which was great.  I find that sauce sticks to penne just as good as bowtie and my kids love the little "tubes".  Also, I used 2 cups of frozen broccoli instead of the fresh, this turned out fine as well.  I personally loved the red bell pepper but no one else here does, so I used just enough for me.  I also threw in some fresh sliced mushrooms.  I would like to note that next time I will try the "light" version of the cream cheese, just to take off some of the fat and calories.  I'll let ya know if this is just as good.  This recipe is a keeper! Thanks

I took this dish to a family reunion where it was well received. I couldn't keep from sneaking a bowtie or two (or three) while I was making it! Delicious. The cream sauce was simple to make as well as yummy. I love cream cheese and never would have thought of using it in this fashion. This is a very good basic recipe begging to be personalized by each individual.  I altered the recipe and grilled the chicken instead of boiling and added more broccoli than called for. Great recipe. My mouth is watering just thinking aboout it.

This is one of my new favorite recipes.  I do a lot of freezer cooking and this one works great.  I cook up the sauce and freeze it and then when I'm ready to serve it, I reheat and also cook the pasta.  My husband and I love it!!

Awesome meal! I swapped the cream cheese for sour cream as I thought my family would like it better. I also changed the prep method a little, I cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces and sauteed it with the garlic, then added in the veggies and stir-fried them for a few minutes before adding the broth. My sauce didn't thicken very well, but that was the only problem. The flavor was heavenly, this will be made again!

This was AWESOME! Even my 2 year old and 4 year old cleaned their plate! A definite family favorite that I will make over and over. I did a few things differently. To decrease the cooking time, I cut the chicken into chunks and then cooked it in a skillet sprayed with cooking spray. I seasoned it well with seasoning salt, garlic powder and onion powder. When it was done I just put it in a covered bowl and followed all the rest of the steps. I added the chicken back in the skillet once the cream cheese was smooth and let it simmer a few minutes to thicken it up a little.

Cream cheese shouldn't go on pasta.  I was expecting something similar to alfredo sauce - but it is not even close.  Not the recipe's fault - it just wasn't for me.

Thanks Stacey, we loved this one!  We halved the recipe and still had leftovers.  The only thing I changed, was that I didn't have the chive and onion cream cheese, so I melted down the plain cream cheese I had in the microwave, and and put in the spices manually.  I didn't have dried onion, so we mixed in Good Seasons italian dressing mix(dry) with it.  It was really yummy.  We will definitely make again!  Thanks!!

Awesome week-night dinner!  I used Emeril's Essence on the chicken, broiled it & then cubed it.  I also used more chicken than the recipe suggested.  I added mushrooms.  For the cream cheese, I used 1 light chive & onion and 1 light veggie.  For the chicken broth, I used roasted garlic broth.  Served w/ sliced tomatoes.

What a great (and quick) recipe!  I used a rotisserie chicken and frozen broccoli.  It got rave reviews even from the picky eaters in my family!  Here's what I did:  I cooked the penne pasta until al dente; then quickly sauteed some mushrooms on med high heat with a touch of olive oil, then threw in half an onion sliced and 1-2 cloves of garlic minced, and a box of thawed frozen chopped broccoli, and sauteed everything very quickly.  I then added 1/2 a can of chicken broth and one container of the chive cream cheese, stirring until everything was well blended.  Seasoned with salt and pepper and some parmesean cheese, then tossed in the shredded chicken and pasta.  AWESOME.  Thanks for sharing.  This will be one of those QUICK go to weeknight dinners!

I loved this recipe. I used Garden Vegetable Cream Cheese and left out the broccoli. Served steamed cauliflower on the side.

Ony OK... If someone else made it, I'd eat it, but I wouldn't bother to make it again. In taste and texture, it reminded me of a good tuna casserole. I agree with others who've called this bland... It just needs something to make it remarkable. I'll tell you though, if I did make it again, I'd cut way back on the cream cheese. One reason it's bland is that the cream cheese taste and texture overpower and dominate the dish.

My kids scarfed this up like it was going out of style!  I did make a couple changes...I pan fried the chicken breast in a little bit of olive oil and then just chunked it up.  I also used frozen chopped broccoli making it a little bit quicker to simmer.  Lastly, because my hubby isn't a big cream cheese fan I only used one container and there was more than enough sauce to cover.  This will for sure make it onto the monthly menu!

Followed exact directions except added mushrooms, and sun dried tomatoes (in oil, drained) My family really enjoyed this recipe, and I appreciated how easy it was to put together. I thought it was a little bland, but overall, I'd make it again, and maybe add something to kick it up a notch. Overall, I liked it.Thanks for a good recipe!!

If I were to make this again, I would substitute a can of cream of chicken soup for one of the pkgs of cream cheese. The cream cheese was a bit too heavy and rich even though I used light cream cheese. I also added a little bit of my homemade pesto. Good idea to be sure that the veggies do not overcook. I sauted thin slices of chicken in olive oil and garlic to add extra flavor. Overall, a tasty recipe.

I had this recipe in my very first cookbook!  I used to impress with it when I first started cooking 12 years ago. I haven't had it in a while because it's very rich and I tend to cook leaner things these days. That said, it's very creamy and tasty and great on a cold winter day. I don't know that I'd boil the chicken though. Just stir-fry the chicken quickly with the veggies, add broth and cream cheese and you have the sauce. Boil the pasta and add. Also, I don't like bow-tie pasta. That part in the middle of the bow-tie never gets cooked properly. I always use rotini for this and for a lot of my other pasta-related dishes.

Made this as part of mis7up's Hidden Treasures challenge. This has been in my recipe box since 06, Jan. 2011.  Great dish on a cold night.  The one change I did, was to use an 8 oz. block of cream cheese and fresh chives and onions instead of pre-made containers.  It worked out so well that I will make it that way again.  This was nice and creamy and it held up wonderful as leftovers for lunches the next day.  Thanks Cooking Mama for sharing your recipe.  It is a keeper.

Great dish...got high fives and nothing but praises from the fam...even the picky 9year old wanted seconds. I added another red pepper as well as more broccoli, I also seasoned the vegetables while they were cooking in olive oil as well as seasoning the chicken breast before boiling for 25 minutes! Overall everything was great and the fam is looking forward to left overs tomorrow!

This dish was easy to prepare and is easy to change up. I opted for asparagus instead of the red pepper. It was delicious!

Made this a little lighter by whipping 1c lowfat cottage cheese, 1 Tbsp garlic, and about half of the broth in the blender as a substitute for half of the cream cheese -- delicious!  Also used the suggestion of adding onion and some cajun spice mix -- whole family loved it!

4 out of 5 stars because i made quiet i few changes. but it turned out FANTASTIC. mother in law and husband were raving about it.  i cut the chicken into strips, seasoned it with mesquite seasoning and browned it in olive oil once i turned off the heat, i put in the left over penne i was trying to get rid of from my fridge (it warmed it up nicely) . at the same time i threw in half a diced onion and frozen broccoli in another pan with little chicken broth, minced garlic and some red pepper flakes until it boil then turned down to med-lo heat until i like the texture of the broccoli. i threw in strips of roasted red peppers before i turned the heat to low, to melt some cream cheese and onion dip into the veges. it was super thick so i thinned it out a tiny bit with the chicken broth. finally tossed the contents of vegie pan into the pasta and chicken, stirred and served.  note: this turned out very "Different tasting" to what we've ever had.. the combination of flavors were unusual but everybody at dinner loved it anyway.

A good basic recipe. You can throw anything you have on hand in and it turns out great. Very fast and easy on a night when you can't figure out what to make.

I was expecting this to be more alfredo like than what it was so it was a little disappointing. It was pretty good for the first few bites but quickly dried up when it was removed from the stove resuling in very little of it being eaten.

Good kid-friendly dish. I sauteed the garlic and bell pepper first and added fresh mushrooms. I knew it would be somewhat bland so I also added some cayene pepper.

I made this dish last night.  I used a wok and put the diced chicken, red pepper, Onion and garlic in there.  I drained the chicken mixture, put the broth & broccoli in for about 4 min on high.  I utilized Laughing Cow Cheese (onion and garlic [mixed] 12 wedges to substitute for the cream cheese and lower the calories.  And tossed everything all together and let simmer for 5 min.  It was awesome.  The whole family loved it.  Calories when using Laughing cow Cheese will be 271 - We could get 10 servings out of this recipe!  So cut in half if it's too much.  Thanks!

My husband and I really liked this recipe.  I halved the recipe, and the only thing I want to do differently is actually add a little more than half the can of broth because ours ended up too thick to my liking after adding the cream cheese.  This is definitely not a spicy recipe (which is typically what we eat), but knowing that ahead of time, I thought it was delicious for what it was.

Though I followed the instructions, this didn't turn out well for me. I ended up throwing it all out. Basically, I had melted cream cheese over pasta. I couldn't taste the chicken broth (14.5 oz. can) and the flavors of the garlic, broccoli and pepper were overpowered by the chive and onion cream cheese (two 8 oz. tubs). Next time, I will just toast a bagel and put the cream cheese on that.

Anything with cream cheese in it is OK in my book!  I boiled the chicken with three bullion cubes, which added some flavor. Next time, I will saute the chicken with seasoning.  I added mushrooms, yellow pepper, and a banana pepper, and used 8 chicken breasts instead of four.  Next time might try egg noodles.  Definitely a keeper and easily modified.

This is a great recipe that I modified a bit based on what I had on hand. Instead of the tubs of cream cheese I used 8 wedges of laughing cow light swiss and 3/4 cup plain yogurt. I also added a generous splash of white wine with the veggies and some shallots, which add a more complex flavor. Served with my version of Paula's Bread Sticks. This is going to make the regular rotation in our house!

I made a few alterations myself but I think it turned out good and the kids gobbled it down. I sauteed the chicken in oil in a big skillet and seasoned the chicken with Tastefully Simple Italian Seasoning. I then added the broccoli and garlic. I made chicken broth using chicken broth granuales and mixed it with one container of onion and chive sour cream, added the pasta last. Gave it a couple good stirs to get the sause all over everything and it was ready to go. The sauce wasnt very thick but it didn't need to be, it was rich in flavor.

this was really good and easy to make.  It would be a great recipe to also use an already cooked chicken from the store if you are looking for something easy and fast.  Not to heavy, good flavor.

Very excellent dish, I added Sun dried tomatoes to it. For the people who say the cream sauce is to soupy, just add more pasta to it. Sun dried goes very well with it. Give it a try.

Great blend of ingredients. I substituted tortellini for bow tie pasta, and shrimp for chicken, and tossed a pinch of ginger in for a smokin' meal. Still great effort. Thanks for the recipe.

This was so quick, easy and so delicious - cooked the chicken in the crock pot all day while I was at work and the rest was simple. My husband said "this is the best one you have fixed - don't throw this recipe away!"

I just made this tonight for dinner. I thought it was very good and I didn't have to spend alot of time in the kitchen. Like another viewer I added mushrooms. I also crumbled up bacon on top and added extra garlic because after reading other reviews I didn't want it to be bland. I was pleasantly suprised. I will be making it again.

A great recipe!  I only had plain cream cheese, so I added some green onion.  As others have suggested, I will add more broccoli next time.  I grilled the chicken, basting it with olive oil first.  This recipe makes a lot, but the leftovers are also yummy!  This can also be a great side dish by eliminating the chicken.

We used peas instead of broccoli but one thought there wasn't enough sauce - the other thought there was too much pasts (which translates too nor enough sauce). I would season the chicken more while cooking. We cubed instead of shredding. Second day even better - thanks for a good stick to your ribs meal! Makes tons!!

I enjoied this recipe.  I did change a coupel of things.  I fixed the chicken in my hot plate with a cup of water the garlic and red pepper. Removed chicken, added the chicken broth and broc.. After a time I added the cream chees, but only half. I added the shreaded chicken.  Cooked the pasta and mixed it all together in a larg serving dish. Sprinkel with parmisan. It was EASY and made a grate center peace on the dinner table. I'll make it again.

We can't have dairy products in our house unless they're lactose free. Certainly no soft cheeses. I've tried this with a small amount of white roux. If you're going for Alfredo put a pinch of sugar and some butter in the roux. Of course a pad of butter makes everything betta.

This was an outstanding recipe, I followed it to a T except left out peppers because of kids. We all loved this! The sauce was thick and had a wonderful taste. My wife thought I had made a hybrid alfredo. My kids loved it and they are picky and don't usually eat broccoli. This will be one of our favorites and go to meal. Good job cooking mama!!!

This was so yummy! And really easy! I made it last night for mommy's night out and it was a total success! I forgot to get two of the cream cheese packages so I ended up only using one, but it was still super yummy (and a few less calories)! Oh, and my one year old LICKED her plate clean! So if she will eat it (and shes a picky eater) then it has to be good! Cant wait to make it again!

This is a dish for a crowd (not for 4, as it says in the recipe, unless you are starving!)   Very tasty, and worth repeating.  Like many, I sauteed the chicken w/ some seasonings rather than boil it.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

My husband & daughter liked it, but I didn't care much for it. Boiling the chicken breast made it a little tough. I like the idea posted by another reviewer of using rotisserie chicken. It was a little rich for my taste, but the flavors were good.

4.5 stars......very good, cream cheese was a little hard to find....I had to use a small jar of pimentoes instead of red pepper and it was just great!

My fiancée and I agree this is probably one of the best things we've ever made. She altered the recipe a little based on the other reviews. We sauteed the chicken we cut up in olive oil, adding seasoning salt, parsley, and garlic salt. We also sauteed the vegetables a little in olive oil before adding the chicken broth. We added a cucumber because we had one lying around, and it turned out really good. We also used penne pasta instead, and it was wonderful. This is a really great recipe. We will definitely be making this on a regular basis now.

I used whole grain farfalle. If fat and calories are a concern just use fat free cream cheese and cut the parmesan cheese to taste. You have a relatively guilt free delicious meal!

This is similar to the receipe I have.  Instead of using cream cheese I use smoked gouda.  I also use smoked turkey but have used chicken which I saute first  I first saute the broccoli and then add the some of the broth with the cheese.  It takes a while for the cheese to melt and you need to stir it so it does not stick or burn.  As the cheese melts I add more broth.  I do use red pepper flakes which gives it a litle heat.  I have three grown boys and they and their wives love this dish.  It is the one dish I can bring over any time and they will always ask for more.

Really enjoyed this meal. Added more cream cheese to make it wetter and that made it better. Because the chicken was boiled, it didn't have any flavor. Just make sure to season the dish. I added fresh mushrooms and garlic and broccoli. Delicious!

FANTASTIC! My kids even loved it! The only thing I did differently was I didn't boil the chicken, i just cooked it on the stove with some garlic seasoning and cajun seasoning and then cut it up into cubes. I also didn't use as much chive cream cheese, only 12 oz instead of 16 oz. It was rich enough in taste. Great recipe though!

Pretty boring for so much work and dirty pans, not much flavor.  I would never make this again. The sauce was thin and lacking.  I did like the idea of steaming the broccoli and peppers in chicken broth with the garlic as that was a new method for me.

I used 1/2 of the called for amount of cream cheese and the sauce was plenty creamy.  I had only plain cream cheese, but lots of green onion I was trying to use up and that was a good combination. I doubled the amount of brocoli, added half when the reciped called for and half when I mixed the pasta and sauce together for some extra crunch in the pasta.  I did cook the chicken in broth rather than water as some reviewers suggested.  My 9 year old daughter loved this recipe, as did my husband.  Unlike some creamy pasta recipes the leftovers heated up very nicely for a second night's dinner.  I added a bit of milk when heating and it was as creamy as the original meal.  Definitely a keeper recipe for us!  Thanks for sharing it!

This was just...weird.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great and even adding in 6 cloves of garlic (vs 2) didn't help.  I think cutting the broth in half might have helped?  Sauce was just a tad runnier than I would have liked.  It was fine, just not going in the recipe book.  Would rather have alfredo.

Very tasty! This actually wasn't the recipe I used (I used a similar one off of the back of a pasta box), but it was basically the same thing. I cooked the chicken in oil with garlic. I then cooked brocolli and red peppers with the chicken broth, added the chicken, then used 2 containers of chive and onion cream cheese, and mixed the pasta in. Delicious!

I really liked this recipe.  So simple to make with a lot of different possibilities.  You can use any vegetables you like.   I did use broccoli, red peppers, mushrooms, and peas.  I also used vegetable bow tie pasta and it came out wonderfully.

Very good. My family really enjoyed this. I used the light cream cheese and used 3 large chicken breasts which was more then plenty. I will certainly make this again.

This was a very good recipe. I did do a few modifications, however. I boiled my pasta in the chicken broth/stock (that I had from boiling a whole cut up chicken). I did not add brocolli, and did add a can of rotel, and a can of stewed tomatoes. Thanks for the recipe!

I started with pre-seasoned lemon pepper chicken breasts.  (I have like a huge freezer full because they were on sale.)  I boiled them in lots of water with 2 teaspoons bouillion mixed in.  After removing the chicken, I brought the broth back up to boiling and added the noodles to the pot.  Everything else I followed except I added mushrooms and used frozen broccoli instead of fresh...the broccoli got a little soft but I still enjoyed it immensely.  It was excellent!!

This was outrageously good!!  And alot better than it looks on the photo.  Made this for the kids when me and my husband were going out for dinner, I almost changed my mind about the restaurant.  That's how good this was.  

Made some changes though; used maccaroni instead of bow tie pasta and alot less chicken than the recipe called for.  Mushrooms instead of red bell pepper, cram cheese with herbs instead of onion and chives and mozzarella cheese instead of parmesan.

Not drastic changes really, but I did put mine in a large pan, drizzled the cheese over and baked in a hot oven until the top layer was golden and crispy.  And that did it for me, if you think this dish is good try to wack it in the oven for a little bit.

You'll love it!!

I sautéed the chicken in olive oil rather than poaching it, and I added red pepper flakes to the veggies. I also used light cream cheese instead of regular.  The cream cheese flavor in the pasta sauce was a little unusual and will take some getting used to, but I still thought the dish was very good.

I used a mix of peppers that I already had cut up, green, red and yellow. I also omitted the extra salt, but did add plenty of pepper. The only complaint I really have is that I didn't use a big enough head of broccoli for this. Can't go wrong with more veggies.

This recipe was delicious and easy to make!  I did make a few changes to it.  I cut the chicken and browned it while the pasta was cooking.  Then I put the broth, broccoli, and spices in the pan to simmer.  I only made it for 2 people, but it did not take even 8 minutes to simmer.  Next I substituted 3/4 of a jar of creamy alfredo sauce for the cheese and added it to the broth mixture.  I didn't have any of the cream cheese and I wasn't too sure if I'd like it that rich.  It turned out so good that I can't wait to make it again!  My husband agrees!

I made this for two friends last night and they raved about it. It was not difficult, and had a great flavor.  Substituting already minced garlic for the fresh kind made it much easier, too.  This is a delicious, quick and easy dinner. Thanks!

My entire family just loves this.  The leftovers are wonderful for lunches for my daughter.  This made her love broccoli.  The only thing that I do differently is, I do not use the red bell pepper at all.

VERY RICH but VERY GOOD. The chive/onion cream cheese does dominate the dish but goes well if you have alot of chicken, veggies and noodles in the dish. I didn't change a thing, except I may add a little more broccoli and chicken next time. I couldn't make this very often (like I said..."rich," which also means just tape it to my rear end) but I WILL make this again. Everyone in my family loved it. Thanks Stacey!

This recipe is easy to make and tastes great.  I didn't use an broccoli, b/c 
neither of us like it, but it still tasted great.  I scaled down the recipe to make 
2 servings, and still had leftovers...they are good the next day too!

I've made this dish several times and it turns out great.  I make two modifications though.  I cut the chicken into bite size pieces and use slightly less than the 12 oz. pasta the recipe calls for otherwise I think it would be too dry.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe Stacey!

This was absolutely delicious! Based on some of the other reviews, I cubed the chicken (instead of pulling) and sautéed it in olive oil with garlic and Cajun seasoning instead of boiling it. I added some Cajun seasoning to the vegetables and chicken broth too. To make it easier, I used a bag of frozen broccoli instead of fresh and a spoonful of minced garlic from a jar. I thought the cream cheese was actually really good too. It just tasted like really good cream sauce. I think next time I will try the lighter version of cream cheese to cut down on calories.

I made this for my me and my husband.  We LOVED it!  I altered the procedure a little.  Added half of a chopped onion to the broth mixture and also microwaved my broccoli cuts for about 5 minutes before adding them to the mixture.  I do not agree with a previous review that it was bland or that it was to watery.  After you add all the noodles - the noodles soak up all the juice.  Topped with parmesean cheese which completes the dish! This is a keeper!Also a good dish to bring to feed a crowd - makes a lot!!!

I liked the broccoli and the pasta and cream cheese sauce. I just wasn't a fan of the chicken- it didn't have a lot of flavor. Next time, I am going to try some of the suggestions on here and season the chicken.

Made this by substituting a few of the ingredients and it was great!  I used a half chopped onion, regular cream cheese and grated Swiss.  I omitted the Parmesan, broccoli, and chive and onion cream cheese.  I also added chunks of apples- which was a huge hit!

It was okay. Dont be fooled - this is enough food for 8 people easy. I made a few slight changes. I cut back on the amount of chicken - 2 chicken breast halves was plenty. I used half a head of broccoli, less pasta than called for, and added cauliflower. Even with cutting out some of the amounts, there was still enough food for 8 people. If I were to do this again, I would saute the chicken instead of boiling. I would not likely make this again though even though my kids did seem to like it. There are better ways to make a cheese/pasta dish.

Yumm yumm yumm! I made some changes though (as always!) and it came out as one gorgeous dinner. I used the dark meat from the chicken thigh, cut it in bite pieces, sprinkled them with salt, pepper and paprika powder, and instead of boiling it, i sauteed it with some olive oil and set it aside. I used button mushrooms, broccolli and red bell pepper. You can adjust the vegetables to your liking and just cook everything in the same skillet. And instead of parmesan cheese, i used gorgonzola and roquefort that give this dish a nice taste. Thanks for the recipe, Cooking Mama!

My boyfriend could not get enough of it!! I always use the review tips and made the following adjustments:  cut the chicken in cubes and cooked in a little EVOO with cajun seasoning, garlic powder and 1/2 onion.  Put the rest of the onion in the broth with broccoli and only used 1 container of cream cheese and it was PERFECT!!  I think 2 would have been way too heavy.  Will definitely make again.

This was really good and very easy to make. My husband who is so picky loved it and asked to have it again.  I cut it in half and used rotisserie chicken I had left over.  The red bell pepper really stands out, next time I may leave it out and add another veggie.

I loved this recipe! I always make recipes from this site "as is" the first time. The second time around, I put my own twist on it.  The first time I made it - I loved it. The second time I made it, I left out the chicken and added more vegetables. I used broccoli, mushrooms, bell peppers, and asparagus. The onion and chive cream cheese was what put it over the edge - my whole family loved it.

It was super easy to put together. The cream cheese was overpowering and made for a strange texture.  I won't make it again but would recommend using one package of cream cheese and replace the second package with cream.

Very good, I added some starch to thicken the sauce. Also added onion, tomato and mushroom. Tastes great with added Italian seasoning and red crushed pepper. I would recommend.

i used leftover rotisserie chicken, frozen broccoli, and only had 1/2 package of cream cheese with the full 12 ounces of pasta.  It was perfect. I think any more cream cheese would have been too rich for our family's taste.  Very easy to put together with leftover chicken and items already in pantry.  Will make this once a month!

Simple and fast.  Found it a little too thick.  Will try something to thin it next time.

My dinner guests loved this but I thought it was a little bland. I had to add a lot of salt and pepper at the table, something I'd rather avoid. I like the ease of this recipe, but in the future I'll add more spice, and more onion and garlic to increase the flavor.

very good recipe. My boyfriend and I both loved it.I made it early in the day so I could take some to work with me at night. I sampled a little bit after it was done and it tasted very good. when I reheated it at work,EXCELLENT it seemed to bring the flavor out more. I wish I had taken more with me. Can't wait for dinner tonight to have more.

I REALLY loved this recipe; and so did my 3 kids.  We have enjoyed this for two different dinners now.  Might I suggest though, use pepper and salt...the recipe comes out somewhat bland otherwise but still tastes good.

This wasn't the worst thing I've ever eaten, but it certainly wasn't the best. My suggestions for making it better would be to ditch the cream cheese and make an olive oil and garlic base.

I don't think I've made anything this good at home in a long time. We loved it, and everyone went back for seconds! The only thing I did differently was add poultry seasoning to the chicken before I mixed it into the sauce, and added lots of salt & pepper. Soooo good. I'll definitely make this again!

This recipe is a keeper!  My only substitutions I used were 1) regular lite cream cheese, 2) whole grain farfalle and 3) added fresh chopped chives and chopped onions.  Everyone loved it and wanted more!

First, a disclaimer. I changed the recipe. I used a brick of plain ff cream cheese and (per another reviewer's suggestion) added a packet of Good Season's Italian Dressing Mix. I added a cup of onion and a cup of frozen sliced mushrooms. I cut the chicken in bite size pieces and sauteed it with the vegetables. Mixed in broth and cream cheese and let thicken. Would like to try with sliced carrots and different seasoning to reduce salt.

We loved this recipe! I followed the original recipe pretty closely.  I'm not one to measure a lot (unless I'm baking). I think onions and mushrooms would have been wonderful and added more flavor. I know that I added way more parmesan than what the recipe called for. I seasoned a couple of times with S&P. I will fix again and again....just not too often...maybe special occasions.  Thank you so much for sharing this delicious recipe!!!

This was okay.  However, another version I have is better.  Brown the chicken, add mushrooms, and Sun-Dried Tomatoes (better if you use one in oil).  Cook pasta and broccoli.  Put together and sprinkle with Parmesan.  I have to call all the kids to come eat with mom and dad when I fix this version.

I used to make this like 10 years ago and forgot about it and then couldnt remember what went in it.  I made it a bit different though.  I season the chicken and broiled it.  I added green peppers as well as the green peppers, mushrooms, and onions.  I sauteed the veggies minus the brocolli.  Then I blended the chicken broth and cream cheese in the bullet to make it smooth.  then I added alittle broth to the sauteed veg and added the brocolli to get them tender and then added the cheese mixture and then noodles.  Was(is) very yummy!!  Thanks for reminding me how to make it!!

This dish was really good even though I had intended to use left over roasted chicken but forgot to add it in. I added sliced mushrooms to the broth mixture and  added the broccoli only for the last couple of minutes. Red pepper flakes sprinkled on top.

I thought this was quite tasty. I made a couple of changes based on personal preference and what I had on hand. I used 3 breasts I had boiled the night before. I omitted the pepper and parmesan. Only used 1 8oz of cream cheese (plain). Added 1 cup jarred pesto, a can of mushrooms, more garlic and the zest of 1 lemon. I cooked the sauce down a bit to a nice creamy texture. YUM!!!!

Goodness this was easy and good.  Of course I made some adjustments along the way.  Didn't boil the chicken, just cut it up and cooked it until it was almost done. I added some heavy whipping cream to the dish.  Very good and will make again.

THIS WAS AMAZING! I used low fat cream cheese and added chives since I couldn't find the right combination in the store! Boiling the chicken was different from what I'm used to and made the chicken moist! WILL MAKE AGAIN!

Made it for lunch for myself and some colleagues at work...it was DELICIOUS! Everyone raved about how good it was and asked for the recipe. I used only about 12oz of cream cheese (instead of the 16oz per 4 servings) with about 16oz of pasta. I used chicken bullion and the appropriate amount of water instead of a can of chicken broth, and added red pepper flakes. Boiling the chicken makes it mouth-watering tender, and I just seasoned it afterward with Adobo seasoning, Sazon El Ranchero and lime. I could eat this every day!

What a wonderful dish this is! I cut this in half and made this for hubby and I for lunch. It still would have fed 3 people as we have plenty of leftovers. I didn't have cream cheese, but didn't know that until I was already started, and so I had to whip up a bechamel sauce and then added chives and parmesan cheese to it. I'm certain the cream cheese would have been great in it too instead, and I still can't believe I was out of that. That is a staple in my fridge. We both really enjoyed this nice creamy pasta dish and I will fix this again! Many thanks!!!

Good! Based on other reviews made a few minor adjustments.  Sauteed chicken instead of boiling.  Only added enough chicken broth to thin the cream cheese slightly. Added the broccoli to the pasta towards the end of cooking.  Will make again.

this really was good!  i took someone's advice tho and used only 8 oz of cream cheese plus 12 oz heavy cream for the sauce.  i had to make a reux to thicken it into an alfredo sauce.  i also used only 1 can chicken broth. I sauted the peppers in garlic first and cooked the chicken in olive oil, salt, and pepper.  i'll definitely use this again! thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is so versatile and a great starting point for a wonderful pasta dish. I sauteed the garlic with some minced onion in a little olive oil and then added some leftover cooked chicken, a little white wine, a can of chicken broth, some red pepper, Italian herbs and red pepper flake and let it simmer for a few minutes, while the pasta cooked. Add the very end before pouring the sauce over the drained pasta, I added 8 oz plain low fat cream cheese (thats all I had on hand) the parmesan and 1 cup crumbled garlic/herb feta cheese. I also added about 1/4 c fresh basil confetti.  This was excellent and not too rich at all.

I thought the sauce on this recipe was delicious.  Here is what I did differently:  I did not add red pepper.  I did add mushrooms.  I grilled the chicken (which I seasoned with garlic salt and black pepper).  I used 1/3 less fat onion and chive cream cheese.   This recipe was so simple and delicious.  It tasted like it was a much more difficult sauce than it was.  Next time I'm going to try it with artichoke hearts as well.

This recipe turned out so tasty, but I only gave it four stars because of the changes. I took the advice from other reviews and added more liquid, about 2 1/2 - 3 cups of broth.  I used some precooked chicken that I had cooked using the Boiled Chicken recipe on this website (I used the leftover broth in this recipe as well).  I didn't have a bell pepper so I added a sprinkling of crushed red peppers and a heaping 1/2 tsp. onion powder.  I used 1/2 tsp garlic salt instead of fresh, but fresh would still taste good.  I didn't have flavored cream cheese, so I used regular, but only 4 oz. (this made the sauce a bit lighter) and I added about 1/4 C sour cream.  Then I combined all ingredients in a casserole dish and sprinkled Italian bread crumbs and parmesan cheese on top and baked for 15 min. in 350 oven.  My eight year old and 10 month old gobbled up the noodles and broccoli because the sauce was just so tasty! We've varied the noodles as well - it puts a different spin on it.  Have and will continue to use this recipe.

Delicious! I was skeptical at first because it seemed too simple but was pleasantly suprised because this dish is really great. The only thing I changed was that I used reduced fat chive and onion cream cheese.

This was pretty darn good. I cooked the chicken in the skillet first, in olive oil, garlic, and onion. I removed it once it was cooked through, then followed the rest of the directions, adding the chicken back in at the end. I used low-fat Philadelphia chive and onion cream cheese, and used a tiny bit of crushed red pepper instead of the actual red peppers. I will definitely make this again.

This dish is deliciously rich and smooth. I grilled the chicken rather than boiled it and added sun-dried tomatoes. I wasn't convinced it was would work when adding the cream cheese to the liquid chicken mix, but it became smooth quickly and coated the pasta well. 

Now if only I could find a low-fat onion and chive cream cheese, I’d make this often!

My boyfriend made this for me last night for dinner, and it was great. He knows I'm trying to eat better, so he substituted a few wedges of Laughing Cow cheese for the cream cheese. It tasted amazing!

I made this pasta and it was delicious! I really enjoyed the cream cheese in the sauce! I followed the recipe completely except I added mozzarella instead of parmesan. I will definitely make this pasta many more times!

I use the exact ingredients but I put them together differently.  I marinate the chicken in Italian dressing for a bit and then cook it.  I also steam the broccoli by itself.  I make the sauce separate. The garlic,chicken broth and cream cheese until it's thick.  Then I put the pasta along with the chicken and pour the sauce on top on each plate.  That way everyone can put as much sauce as they like.    I notice if you mix it all together as posted it doesn't reheat well so eat all then.  Otherwise I found the way I make it works great to reheat.  Thanks!

I think this recipe is absolutely delicious!  I was a little leery of using the cream cheese, but it was perfect.  I did only use one container of cream cheese rather than two, and it still turned out yummy.  After I added the first, I just decided it didn't need any more.  My boyfriend and I both loved this and will be having it again!

This was fairly easy to make and tasted yummy! I sauted my chicken, and used a whole box of pasta, 1 can chicken broth, and 1 and 1/2 of the chive/oinion cream cheese. I added the broccoli and red pepper and dinner was done! Tasted like I had spent a long time preparing but didn't take long at all. Will definitely make again!

This was super easy! I made it even easier by using frozen asparagus pieces in place of the broccoli and I omitted the pepper.  Also, I cut the chicken into pieces and pan fried in oil for quicker cooking as opposed to boiling. I added more parmesan cheese in order to give it the extrac kick it needed.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very Nice! I found this recipe under the quick and easy category. I'm not sure if I would label it like that because you boil and shred the chicken... but if you used 'canned chicken' it would speed it up a bit. (I also used frozen broccoli and that helped speed up the prep time.) I didn't have onion/chive creamed cheese... so I made my own out of minced onion and chives. I also didn't have any red pepper, so I used frozen whole pearl onions. YUM! Turned out great.

I made this dish for some friends that I meet in college.  It really turned out great! I boiled the chicken breast in Italian Herb flavored chicken breast.  My husband tasted it when he got home and was very impress with dish.  The only other thing I changed was that I used Light Cream cheese....and the sauce will thicken!

This was really good. We're garlic loving people so I added about four times the garlic. It was also a big hit wth my five-year-old. This recipe is definitely worth trying.

My husband and I liked this recipe.  I changed a few things to speed up cooking time. I cut up the chicken and browned it, then added chicken broth and frozen mixed veggies instead of fresh - it was easy and still tasted great.

this recipe was so cool, and easy and it came out so delicious. though i did do a variation on the recipe. Because i didn't know how the chives and onion cream cheese was going to come out i added one 8oz chives and onion and one 8oz reg whipped cream cheese. I thought it was out of this world and so did my family. thank you

No changes.  The grand children loved it: ages 4, 3, & 2.  Getting them to agree a receipe is 'wow', isn't easy.  However, this one accomplished that!  I will be making this again.

This recipe nail my expectations although I used a dark meat instead of chicken breast it still came out light and full of flavor. The only thing about this recipe that I wish was different is the amount of sauces the end. Next time I will use just a little more chicken broth to create a little more sauce to go with the garlic bread I made on the side

Delicious! The only thing I will do different is bake the chicken.
You loose too much flavor when it is boiled.

I did like it, it was simple to make. My husband however did not really care for it. I don’t know why, but I probably won’t make it again because of him!

This recipe was a big hit with J. Made a few changes for added nutrients and flavor -- 
*Fire roasted the red pepper, and added store bought fireroasted tomatos. Added a little after the broccoli began to soften. 
*Only used one container of cream cheese.
*Used  marinated chicken breast tenders cooked 10 minutes at 350. Added to sauce to finish cooking.
*Would add mushrooms to the sauce and a separate colorful side like baby carrots or something. 
*Served with fresh garlic bread

I made a couple of slight changes to the recipe.  First, I added some sliced mushrooms to the pepper and broccoli.  I also pan fried the cut up chicken breasts.  I added some dried oregano and rosemary to the chicken while cooking. The flavored cream cheese produced a nice alfredo sauce. My wife really enjoyed but chose not to add parmesan cheese.

I'd give it five stars, but the other star goes to my fellow reviewers. I cubed and cooked the chicken in a frying pan with some olive oil and seasoned it with garlic powder, diced onions, red pepper flakes and chili powder along with the salt and pepper. On top of that I only used one container of cream cheese as my boyfriend HATES cream cheese and I didn't want the flavor to overpower everything else. The only thing I think I'll change next time is add some bacon, and maybe some diced jalapenos. But this recipe is a keeper, will definitely be added to my normal rotation of dinners.

This was good.  I used chopped broccoli and a little over 8oz of the cream cheese. I seasoned and chopped the chicken up rather than shredding it. This definitely did not need a full box of the bow ties though.  The ratio of chicken and veggies to bow ties was way off.  I will probably try with just half the box next time.

I read all of the reviews and took in their suggestions. I did use the chives and onion cream cheese however seeing 1tsp is 7 g of fat with 20 mg of cholesterol,  I only used 2 tablespoons than the entire package. I first cooked the veggies ( onion, red pepper, garlic, and broccoli) with olive oil and then set them aside.I browned the cubed chicken in olive oil with cajan pepper, garlic powder, salt and fresh ground pepper.  I added the cream cheese and let it melt. Then added back the veggies. It was a big hit with my family!

The meal came out good, I didn't have the brocolli though. But improvised with mushrooms & more cloves of garlic , five total  , as well as sour cream with the chicken broth. IMO though the chicken would have been more flavorful sautéing and seasoned in the skillet before adding the sour cream and broth. anyway, next time I think it'll turn out better. Oh, the other change was spinach bow tie pasta. Bon appetite .

I really liked this recipe.  I did modify it which is why I gave it 4 stars.  I only used one tube of cream cheese and I added a teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken it a bit.  I added the pasta a little bit before they were done and then mixed it together, added the cheese, then popped it in the oven for 15 minutes.  It thickened nicely.  Great recipe!!

Easy, looks  great and surprisingly delicious.. Added  1cup fresh scallions and used reg cream cheese(not flavored). Added Parmesan cheese to the mixture to thicken up a bit. Used a bit of red pepper flakes also. Definitely will try again- maybe add asparagus, shrimp instead of chicken and a bit more garlic.

I tried this recipe for the first time. My family loved it and said this recipe is a recipe to repeat. I sauteed the chicken with the onion and garlic like others recommended. I removed the chicken and added more onion and garlic to saute the vegetables. I also added a few mushrooms I had in the fridge. I did not use any
broth. Once the vegetables were sauteed, I added one 8 oz. container of the chive and onion cream cheese, then the chicken and most of the noodles. I added the grated cheese at the end. It was creamy and perfect, not too runny.

I didn't alter this recipe one bit and my husband and I loved it. I found it very flavorful and did not experience the runniness that others did. The chicken and farfelle soaked up the sauce and I think when I reheat it I will need to thin it some. Great recipe and we will have it again.

I wish I had read the reviews before I made this.  Don't get me wrong, it was good, but the cream cheese flavor is over powering.  I think that one container of the cream cheese would be better then add some heavy cream and a little flour to thicken.  I used frozen broccoli instead of fresh because that's what I had.  I used organic low sodium chicken broth and added a dash of cayenne pepper.  I would add more garlic next time.

The only thing I did different 'was boil the chicken in water with "Better than Bullion". Then followed the recipe. Ohhhhh Myyyyy!  Delicious. Easy to make but the flavor is crazy good. Thank you for the recipe.

My boyfriend rated this as the best recipe I've made him so far, and I cooked a week straight for our meals :)  Definitely best with fresh ingredients, as I used a frozen peppers/onions mix to try to save a little time...so that was my shortcut gone awry in that they were too mushy.  I also added mushrooms to this, as I love mushrooms in every dish I make.  To save more time, I also cut up the chicken into 1 inch cubes to cook instead of boiling in a pot of water.

I didn't care for this dish. The cream cheese flavor was strange to me with the pasta ( and I like cream cheese). My 3 yr old liked it, husband didn't.  I followed the recipe as written;subbed rotini pasta for the bow-tie as that's what was on hand.

Very good, but a little too runny.  I reduced the sauce by 1/2 cup when it was all mixed.  Will use less chicken broth next time.

This was an amazingly quick, easy, and delicious meal.  My husband and children (who are picky eaters!) loved it!  It goes great with a small salad on the side.  YUMM-O!  

I did substitute the sliced red bell pepper for a fire roasted bell pepper.  Thanks for sharing!

I found this pasta a real good one. My kids even cleaned their plates. There are a few things I did differently. I cooked the chicken in olive oil and seasoned with Mrs Dash original seasoning and used frozen broccoli. Came out great. Will make again. A must make

WOW! This was simple and wonderful. I used half cream cheese, (fat free), and half sour cream. I didn't have flavored, so I used onion soup mix to flavor the cream cheese/sour cream. Lightly floured the chicken after cutting into strips and browned it first. added mushrooms and onions and canadian chicken seasoning.  Left out the red peppers, but added just a touch of dried red pepper. Awesome!

I made this the other night, and it turned out great, but that was because I changed it.  I thought that 2 8 ounce jars of cream cheese was too rich and fattening for a sauce, so I bought the 1/4 less fat Chive and Onion cream cheese.  I don't know if it was because I used the less fattening cream cheese, but the pasta was pretty flavorless so I added Chipotle Powder and that was a great addition! Now the pasta became a cajun chicken pasta and it was kickin' yum! =)  Plus I shaved off some calories

The flavor was great. Although, it needs to be thickened.  The thickness was similar to milk mixed with my meat and veges with pasta.  Next time, I will thicken it up and it will be delicious.

Although I changed a few things this meal was delicious. I used the 1/3 less fat chive & onion cream cheese. I used veggie broth instead of chicken because I am a vegetarian. I suated the garlic in OO first then added less broth for a more creamer out come. In another pan I sauted up some chicken for my fiancé who eats chicken. I then added that to his bowl and tossed in the pasta mixture. Yummy! Will make again.

The only changes I made to this recipe was to cut the chicken up into bite size peices and then sautee it in olive oil.  I think boiling the chicken would have lacked flavor and would have turned out a little dry.  Also I added fresh mushrooms I had on hand.  I really loved the flavor of the chicken, broccoli and red bell pepper.  I also love bow tie pasta.  But the sauce wasn't at all what I had expect it to be.  It was very bland.  My fiance said he really liked the dish so I am giving it 3 stars.  I may try this again only with a different sauce.

This is my PICKY eater's favorite, she always asks for this! So easy & quick to make.Instead of chicken breast I de-bone  a Wonder Roast chicken from the store to speed things up. I also use frozen broccoli florette's, always tastes great & makes a big batch.

MMM! This was so yummy and so easy to make. Thanks for the great recipe! I am a huge cream cheese fan but have never used it in a sauce like this, it gave it great flavor and will be making this a lot more often! Hubby really enjoyed it and would like it again, which surprised me since he isn't usually a big fan of creamy pasta like I am. Will definately be making this again, and quite often! Also gives great starter ideas for different sauce flavors and combinations to try in the future. The only downside is re-heating, the sauce thickened up a lot to the point where I think it's best eaten in one sitting, not left over. Plus there was WAY more than 4 servings there...at least 6, maybe even 8. Since it's not the best left over you might want to scale down the servings a bit.

I gave this one a 3 star since I just thought it would have been better!!  The cream cheese was a little much for me and it was missing something.  I think if I made this again I would make a few changes.  Less cream cheese, more flavor, I would not boil the chicken and I think I would just cut it in strips and put on top instead of mixing everything together.

The pasta turned amazing!! It was so delicious... My boyfriend was very impressed, called me the best cook ever.. :) But I made some changes though.. At first, I let chicken to set in the white wine for 15 mins. Also, when I was cooking chicken I add salt, black pepper, and garlick powder for taste. And instead water I put milk. Like I said it terned really good. And fresh Parmesan did change the taste... it's much better.. :) Enjoy this great recipe..

Very good and easy to make. Next time though, I may add a tad bit of whipping cream to thicken the sauce and little more salt.

With the mixed reviews, I was a little scared to make this.. I wish I hadn't. My family liked it though, that's all that matters.

I have made this recipe several times, and it is wonderful. I do use the 1/3 less fat cream cheese and you can't tell the difference. Sometimes I add thinly sliced onion to the vegetables. I have shared this recipe with many friends and heard no complaints!

I was looking for a bow tie chicken pasta recipe that tasted like one of my family's favorites from one of the places where you make a batch of meals for the freezer.  This was it except petite green peas are used in place of the brocolli.

This was a good recipe.  I didn't have two containers of the chive and onion cream cheese, so I used one and a regular container of cream cheese.  So, I am sure it would have been a little more flavorful if I had enough of the other cream cheese.  But it was good, just needed that extra flavor.

It was pretty good overall. I did not like the cream cheese sauce, but it was pretty easy. Also, there was too much chicken in it and I only used 3 breasts.

I used only 1.5 tubs of cream cheese (and it was the lower fat kinds) and it was still too rich for me.  I don't think I'll make this again.

I def. loved this recipe....The only changes i made was that i doubled the chicken and the broccoli. I seasoned the chicken obviously before i started cooking it. I also used olive oil to cook the chicken with water intially. After cooking the chicken i set it aside. Then i followed the instructions in #2 and 3. I added wine to the chicken broth and after cooking the broccoli with the broth, wine, pepper and minced garlic i added the cream cheese added everything to the chicken, sprinkled bread crumbs and cheese on everything then put it in the oven for about 15mins....It was great.....Everyone who tried it LOVED IT...I will def. keep this recipe....

Good recipe, be aware it makes A LOT! 
My family of three ate and I have at least two meals left over! 
I added some white wine to the broth, sprinkled bread crumbs and cheese on top and baked in the oven for about 15 minutes for a little crunch. It was great! Thanks!!

This was very tasty. The only thing I did differently is that I used onion instead of red bell pepper (just didnt have it). I for sure will be making this again, but I will be halving the amount of cream cheese. I felt the sauce was too rich. Oh, and wow this recipe made A LOT of food. It was still good the next day warmed over.

I tweaked the recipe a bit, and my picky family really liked the result.  I used what was handy:  2 chicken breasts with skin and bone.  I poached the chicken, then skinned and boned it returning the skin and bones to the pot where I continued to reduce the broth which I used later.  I cubed the chicken which I set aside.  I used a 16-oz package of bow-ties - again because it was handy.  I steamed the broccoli florets .  In step three, I heated 1-1/2 cups of the chicken broth and whisked the cream cheese into the broth.  When the cheese sauce was hot, I added the minced garlic and the bell pepper stirring until the pepper was heated through - about 30 sec.  Then I added the chicken, the cooked pasta, and the broccoli, stirred to coat, and served.  The very light cooking treatment of the garlic was key to keep the garlic zippy.  Next time, I might garnish with cilantro, or try a little orange zest.   We will definatly try this one again.

I do not usally review recipes that I made ingredient substitutions but this was so good.  I was trying to use up a bunch of leftovers - and made these changes:  Whipped Light Cream Cheese (Still 16 oz.), Peas and Carrots blend for the broccoli, and onion instead of red pepper.  My husband and three very young children loved this dish which is a rare in my house when everybody loves the same dish.  Will make again using the ingedients listed.  Thanks for posting.

I thought this was okay, but it was very rich. My husband didn't care for it too much. I added A LOT of salt, pepper, and garlic salt to give it flavor. It would've been VERY bland without it. I also added an extra clove of garlic. I cut the chicken in chunks, sauteed it in olive oil and italian seasoning instead of shredding it.

I t hought this was a wonderful, creamy pasta dish.  My fiance took one bite and said "This is great!"  I was a little scared by the nutritional information, but after preparing it I would say there are much more than 4 servings.  My family really enjoyed it and I will definately make this a keeper!

Loved it... Improvised a bit to my taste, 1tbsp garlic, and softened the cream cheese in the microwave for about a min. I added all the ingredients in the pan, then the 
softened cream cheese last. That made the mixing of it very easy...

This was okay. My husband didn't like it at all. I didn't think it was bad, it was just pretty bland and not really worth making again.

I actually used a little more pasta since the box came as 1 lb. instead of 14 oz. and I didn't want to have 2 oz. of bowtie pasta lying around.  It still came out great.  Definitely an easy dish to cook and I think I'll have my kids help out next time!

Yummy! I used frozen broccoli & about 12oz of chive & onion cream cheese and added a little more chicken broth to avoid the sauce being too thick. Don't skip the red peppers - I'm not a huge red pepper fan but it made the flavor of this dish - plus it's pretty! My husband & kids loved this too & we fought over the leftovers. This one's a keeper!

I really like this meal.  My husband thinks it lacks flavor.  To be fair, I have never used the red pepper because we don't ever have any decent peppers here.

Was delicious, however I added ground cayenne pepper with the garlic to give it a little something extra. The sauce was way to thick and chunky, so I added 1/2 or so of milk to smooth it out a bit. Also, didn't have chive/onion cream cheese, so I added chopped green peppers. Overall, was very tasty with the additions. Thanks!

This was wonderful.  I have 4 very picky children and in order to please them and the adults in my home, I sauted fresh broccoli and mushrooms (instead of the peppers) in olive oil and added it in after I served the basic chicken and sauce mixture to my kids.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

My husband and I thought this was AWESOME!!! I cut my chicken up into bite size pieces and cooked it in a little olive oil. When it was almost done I added sliced mushrooms, red pepper and seasoning then finished cooking it. I used fresh broccoli and when it was done I added my chicken mixture,cream cheese and cooked until it melted. I then added my noodles and parmesan cheese.This was HEAVENLY!!!!

Not bad, but not as good as I expected based on other reviews.  I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder and seasoned salt and then sauteed in a little olive oil.  I added carrots and mushrooms in addition to the other veggies.  My problem was with the sauce.  It was really too thick and rich for my taste.  Although my husband and I ate it, we both felt the sauce was very heavy, even though I did use light cream cheese.  Even my 4 year old and 2 year old who love pasta and veggies didn't really take to it.  Maybe using less cream cheese (only one container) would help.  I may try this one more time to see if that makes a difference.  It seems like my family should like this a lot more than we did.

This is so good....My husband didn't leave me any leftovers (took them to work). I used 12 ozs of cream cheese, 2 cans of chicken broth, because I added more broccoli. I love sweet pepper strips, so added a few chopped up and give it alilttle zip. I boiled the chicken about 30 mins, I didn't think it was done at 20 mins. I would have to say that this is a make again. He said it was like restuarant quality and I should make this for a dinner party sometime. Thanks again for the awesome recipe..A+++

I thought this was a decent meal.  I only made it for 2, so I halved everything except the veggies (we loooove veggies!)  It needed something else to bring out the flavor, I think...someone suggested cayenne pepper, I may add this if I make it again, but I think I'm likely to try a different "sauce" next time around.

This one is a keeper! Loved it! I did make some alterations. I cubed my chicken and sauted it in olive oil, garlic salt and black pepper. I added cayanne pepper to the broth and I used fresh aparagus instead of broccoli. It turned out great, allot of flavor but very simple! Great!

the first time i made this i followed the recipe exactly.  the second time, i added more flavor and had a much better dinner.  added onions to the broth & broccoli, added a pinch of cayenne, topped with fresh parmesan and used only three chicken breasts.  this added much more flavor and made for a creamier consistency.

I added this to my "comfort food" list.  I loved it and so did my family.  I used packaged chicken that is seasoned, it makes the dish more flavorfull and easier to prepare. Yummy!

This is a favorite in our house right now.  My husband hs told many of his family and friends about it and requests it often.  I think it is good, although slightly bland.  The sauce could use a little more seasoning.  but really very good on the whole.

This is now one of my favorites! Very delicious sauce. I think the red bell peppers are the key ingredient in this dish. Next time i will add more to it. Thank you for this recipe!
