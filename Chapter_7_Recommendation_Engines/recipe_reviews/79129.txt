After trying to decifer my mom's recipe for this, which was handed down by her mom and so on, I found this recipe which was almost exact, except I used buttermilk instead of heavy cream.  Calling the dough sticky is the understatement of the century, there was no way I could roll it out and make shapes (perhaps because I used buttermilk?) SO, I came up with a great idea to put it in a ziplock bag, cut the end and pipe the shapes onto the cookie sheets.  They came out FABULOUS!  And taste just like I remember from when I was a kid.  Thank you!

I have a similar recipe for the Norwegian "soft" Kringla cookies/cakes.  Mine uses buttermilk though, but I think the sour cream is the key to fab flavor.

Soft Kringla are amazing!  I do mine in all sorts of shapes, but be careful to keep the same shape on each cookie sheet for even cooking. I do hoops, figure 8's, twists, 'S' shapes, and spirals (think snail shell).  

I've experimented with coating these in chocolate --- amazing!  You can dip half a cookie, or use a thin-tip pastry bag and swirl on (think of following the spiral indent) or stripe on. Gotta use good quality bittersweet or semisweet chocolate though.

Great recipe! Glad to see another soft-Norwegian Kringla recipe on the web.

I wanted to try some Norwegian recipes for Christmas for my fiance's family who are Norwegian.  They all loved this recipe.  It is a little time consuming but turned our very good.  The cookies are not too sweet and are great in the morning with coffee.

This is a favorite treat of my in-laws...they usually order them online. I decided to go crazy and make this recipe and they were a HUGE hit.  I was told these were every bit as authentic and delicious as they remembered from their childhood.  The dough is SUPER STICKY.  I followed the advice of someone else and used the plastic baggy/icing trick.  It probably saved me hours and hours of unnecessary work.  I also suggest keeping an eagle eye as they're baking.  They quickly turn from undercooked to burnt on the bottom.

If you chill the dough really well it makes rolling easier. It also doesn't hurt to use some flour when rolling. I grew up making these with my mom.

These are exactly what I was looking for!  The recipe as written is just a bit sweet for my family's taste, so I cut the sugar down to about a cup.  Otherwise, I didn't change a thing.  Thanks so much!

Not sure how you are supposed to roll this into a rope. The dough is way too sticky. So I followed the advice and piped the cookies onto a silpat lined cookie sheet. We were making these for a Norwegian heritage project for 5th grade so we did not bother with the figure eight. We just piped them into straight little sticks about 5 inches long. That way we could get more out of the recipe. These reminded me of the cake-like lady fingers. I thought they were about a 3 star, my son thinks they were a 4 1/2, but then he has more Norwegian blood than me. :)

My family is Norwegian and we always have kringlas at Thanksgiving, but I couldn't find my recipe so I used this one this year and it is wonderful!  Tastes just like when my grandma would make them!

This recipe is the same as my grammas except that we use only one cup of sugar, no shortening and the whole egg. She would mix the baking soda into the sour cream before adding all of the ingredients together. To make the dough workable you must refrigerate it for at least two hours. This has been a family favorite for years!

These are a favorite in my family.  Three pieces of advice.  Refrigerate the dough for at least 4 hours, overnight is better.  Do not overtake.  They should be very soft.  The bottom should be a very light brown.  And finally watch two or three YouTube videos before making these to see how the dough is rolled out.

Other advice.  I like to use a fabric covered pastry board.  Rub a little flour into the pastry cloth to make rolling easier.  On one of the YouTube videos, the woman appears to be rolling it on  a dish towel and in another, Mikey is using a traditional Lefse board.

Similar in flavor to my great grandmother's recipe, but this was a lot fluffier, making it hard to hold the shape. Nonetheless, it was a nice change and the family loved it. To other reviewers, the dough is extremely sticky in all recipes. It's just how it is. That's why you only make it once a year :)

My stepdaughter LOVES Kringla & convinced me to make it (I had never even heard of of it).  After consulting my mother-in-law I tried this recipe to rave reviews from the girl.

These were so delicious! They were soft and fluffy, and they are perfect for people who don't generally like sweets because they are just the perfect amount of sweetness. I've never had Kringla before, but these turned out so well, I will definitely be making these again. I had never rolled dough before that was so sticky, so I learned that the trick was to use a VERY well floured surface.

If you love Scandinavian cooking this is a great recipe. My  husband who grew up with Swedish mother and grandmother loved this! It is not a quick recipe so you will need to have plenty of time to make these. I wouldn't make this often but maybe once a year for Christma for a treat!

Kringla is a fall favorite during festival time around my area this time of year. This year we were not as happy with them as usual, so I decided to try my hand with this recipe.  Turned out PERFECT!  I made recipe with buttermilk instead of heavy cream, and piped cookies as well.  Quick and easy, and piping them helps with cleanup!  Excellent!

Almost like my Norwegian grandmother's recipe. But she always added a tablespoon of anise seed! Learning to handle wet dough was like a rite of passage for me and my sister. We still make them at Christmas.Evaporated milk works well.

simply delicious!! Soft and fluffy, a mild flavor but so addicting!  At first I thought they were not sweet enough, but that's because I'm used to the "american" baking, which uses so much sugar.  After having my third one though and letting my palette adjust to the flavor, I think they are perfect in sweetness. Be careful not to use too much flour when rolling out, just use enough to keep it from sticking to you or the surface.  Wonderful as they are, if you want a twist on them perhaps try a little almond extract or lemon zest!  The 2nd time I maede them I didn't use the egg yolk and hand mixed everything, turned out just fine.

A huge hit with my family, very different from our old traditional recipe. However, they are much easier to roll. Still need to dust your rolling board frequently. I use 1 tsp almond flavoring instead of vanilla or nutmeg.

Tips for sticky dough!. After making dough you must refrigerate for many hours. Even after overnight refrigeration plan to use well floured-surface and well-floured hands. An alternative is to use powdered buttermilk instead of the heavy cream and dough will be easier to work with.

Recipe turned out great - I followed it exactly as listed and had no trouble. Yes, you get very sticky dough, but here's how I did it: I used a silicone pastry mat and LOTS of flour, both on the mat and my hands. Roll very gently - remember, you aren't rolling out play-doh! It will be sticky but if you keep enough flour on the mat, and scrape off the sticky spots as they happen, this will work. Also, I used a spatula to move them from the mat to the baking pan, and baked on a silpat in the pan. It is tricky to move them, as they are very soft and fragile. 

Also, after getting the dough rolled out to the proper length, I made it into a circle and pinched the ends together first, then just twisted the circle into the 8. Worked well - just takes time and patience!

This cookie must be what the Norwegian wives made to fill the time during their long cold winters!

Loved it! I'm a newbie and these came out perfect my first try. My husband even helped with this. We quickly found that rolling the dough out in our floured hands worked best for us. Like what you did as kid with your play dough. We gave up on the figure 8's promptly because they looked awful. Instead, we rolled the dough out in snakes with our hands the length of our palms and then doing a swirl instead on the baking pan.

I just made these cookies tonight, and they tasted very good.  I wasn't expecting them to rise so much so I had a batch of monster cookies, though no real complain here.  Very fluffy and light.  Not too sweet, easy to eat.

I had never heard of Kringla before.  A friend of mine mentioned a few times how she loved it but hadn't had it in years.  I decided to give this recipe a shot for a holiday gift - it was a HUGE hit!  She said it tasted exactly as she remembered it from years ago.  The recipe was easy to make and went over so well that I plan to make it again soon.

This same recipe has been passed on through the he women in our family for many years my great grandma got it from her grandma. The only thing different is we roll each cookie into colored sugar and shape into different shapes like candy canes at Christmas etc. My kids still today look forward to making these every Christmas. Best cookie in the world.

Long-time AllRecipes user, first-time reviewer here. I came to this recipe using the ingredients search bc I had extra sour cream & heavy cream left over in the fridge. This recipe is delicious and I enjoyed trying different ways of forming/piping the cookies. Sharing here in case others will benefit from my experience:

1. Left (in glass travel container): I followed the recipe instructions for mixing the dough, but then followed reviewer recommendations to pipe the cookies out. I ended up making spirals using the "star" shaped tip of a cake decorating kit. 

2. Middle (in glass baking dish): I followed original recipe instructions and made the (traditional?) figure 8/infinity sign design. I followed review recommendations and put the dough into the fridge overnight to make it easier to work with the sticky dough. It felt like the ends of figure 8 never seemed to pinch together, but everything evens out in the oven as the dough expands. 

3. Right (on baking sheet): I used two alternate designs for the rolled dough -- one spiral (like a cinnamon roll) and one spiraled figure 8 (kinda like a closed letter S). 

As far as taste, texture & looks are concerned, I prefer the piped design. All the extra flour needed to roll the dough is the first thing you taste when you put the finished cookie in your mouth -- not so when you pipe out the dough. That said, it was really hard to pipe out and my hands got tired quickly with all the hard squeezing.

The dough was so thin and wouldn't come together. There was NO way to roll it out or even make balls.
