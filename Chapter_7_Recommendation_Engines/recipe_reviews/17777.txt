This is a good recipe,similar to the Bermuda Cod Fish Cake recipe,  for added flavour add 1/2 Tbs of crushed fresh thyme or dried Thyme, season to taste using black pepper, seasoning salt & garlic powder. Chill the mixture in the refrigerator for an hour, this will blend the flavors and solidify mixture to avoid crumbling when frying. Before frying coat in seasoned flour mixture (white flour, seasoning salt, black pepper and paprika, this will ensure a nice crispy coating and no crumbling. For perfect even cakes, try using an ice-cream scoop to form balls and shape with hands.

When we Bajans (Barbadians) make codfish cakes, we, too, add either potatoes or cooked calabasa/pumpkin to keep the cakes from becoming too tough.  Also usually use salt cod -- which is freshened by either soaking it overnight (changing water several times) or boiling and then rinsing and flaking the fish 3 - 4 times.  (I've recently taken to just purchasing frozen cod filets which I boil up once and then flake for use in the recipe!)

We add more herbs and spices (thyme, oregano, garlic powder, curry powder, paprika) and hot peppers (diced habañeros) or sauce (Louisiana-style) to taste.  Flour, baking powder, and an egg are also added, along with enough water to make a thick batter, which is dropped into hot oil and fried.  (I prefer to use a deep fat fryer so that the cakes have a crisp outer seal yet remain tender inside.)

This is a great recipe, but make it with whitefish or turbot or something.  When you buy cod, it's from the Spanish and Portugese trollers that are destroying Newfoundland fisheries.

4 stars due to changes required.  I boiled the potato and cod with 2 garlic cloves and half an onion.  Then mashed it all together, added thyme, red pepper flakes and some bread crumbs.  Finally covered each cake in bread crumbs, cooled in the fridge for one hour (which allows them to harden and will not break apart during cooking). Then seared in a hot pan on both sides before finishing in the oven.

This was a very good recipe! I did make some changes though. It seemed a bit plain, so I added about 3 T. of red bell pepper, some salt and pepper and Everglades seasoning. The mixture was too sticky, so I mixed in about 5 oz. of italian bread crumbs. My family loved them and I plan on making them again.

My husband and I grew up with Cod Fish Cakes as the ultimate comfort food.  These were evn better than the ones we remembered!!!  Lent isn't a sacrifice with these babies on your table!  Just a warning tho - grating the onion will lead to red eyes, but the result is definitely worth it!!!!

Mmm... these fish cakes really made my night. I made the recipe for 1/2 pound of fish, and it turned out wicked delicious. I STRONGLY agree with anyone who has said that 2 cups of oil is too much. Absolutly. For the half recipe, I probably used 1/3 of a cup, and it was fine, and probably spared me a heart attack or two. 
I had a little problem when I mixed it all together- it was too wet and not firm enough to mold. However, it was easily solved by adding some fine breadcrumbs. After that, popping them into little patty form was not an issue. The texture was great, though next time I think I'll go for something a little chunkier. They ended up crispy and yummmmy! (Yes, four m's!) Try it out tonight!

I made a few revisions to this recipe and it turned out great! 
I used orange roughy filets instead of cod, and red potatoes. I added a dash of kosher salt, pepper and dill to the mix. Then coated the patties with bread crumbs and cooked them for about 10 min (med heat) on my countertop grill. 
I think they still need a little extra something for more flavor (hmmm, maybe roasted red pepper sauce?), but all in all it was a fantastic meal I will definitely make again. And they were just as good the next day, heated in the toaster oven!

This was a good starting point but it really needed some help in the flavor department. Not enough seasonings and way too much potato. One or even none would be fine and I think a better replacement would be some Panko bread crumbs. I added chopped celery, lemon zest, lemon thyme, black pepper, a bit of Old Bay and coated with bread crumbs before frying. Thank you!

These came out great! I subbed chives for the parsley, as that's all I had on hand, and added salt & pepper.  They could probably use a bit more flavor, maybe some garlic, but I served with a roasted red pepper and garlic mayo (with a little horseradish), so the spicy dipping sauce complimented the fish cakes perfectly!  I particularly like this recipe because it calls for no bread crumbs or other filler - I thought the mixture was too moist, but after letting it sit for a couple minutes while I heated up the pan, it held together perfectly while still retaining its moisture, and best of all, they are actually quite easy to make.  Will definitely makes these again!

This was excellent!!  I had read others suggestions and added salt, pepper and garlic on my own.  Also, because I didn't have fresh parsley I used dried.  Usually I find it doesn't matter but I think fresh would have given this a much better flavor.  This was even good reheated in the oven the next day!

I made these tonight for dinner.  I used just under a pound of cod, 2 large baking potatoes (for their starch in hopes of it holding them together), a half teaspoon of Old Bay, and I doubled the onion and parsley.  I found the mixture to be pretty stiff (a spoon stood up easily in the mixture) so I added only the egg yolk, and threw away the white.  My first batch still fell apart a bit in the pan, and I was very careful- even using two spatulas.  So,  I dredged my second batch in flour before frying- I didn't put them in an egg wash or anything, just flour, and they held together PERFECTLY.  We all enjoyed them- even my 2 year old was gobbling them up.  I thought they were tasty, but I would up the seasoning a bit more next time.  If the kids weren't eating them, I'd add some heat.  Really, the seasonings can be adjusted to whatever your liking. These were very easy, and the recipe made a dozen, which was just enough for us.  Will make again.

I haven't tried this recipe yet, but it sounds similar to one my family has used for generations. Our only difference is that we use salt cod which has been poached twice (to remove most of the salt). Using this may up the "flavour factor" of the fish cakes. You might also want to increase the amount of potatoes and onion used -- to stretch out the meal. Finally, frying them in butter, while packing on the calories, also adds a delicious flavour.

I liked this recipe. however, the "printable" version left out the amount of potatoes.  I cooked the potatoes separately, and added the cod with a little onion in the same water.  I added some sauteed chopped onions and dried parsley to potatoe mixture. After adding the flaked cod, I put the patties in the refrigerator and after 1/2 hour coated them with Japanese bread crumbs called Panko.  They were very, very good!  Thanks

Very delicious fish cakes. If you follow the original recipe to the letter, I think you will find
the flavour a bit bland. When I made it the first time, I added a generous amount of bread crumbs (which provide better consistency), garlic salt & garlic powder. I also add 2 tsp of coriander powder and a 1/2 tsp of cumin. Yum!

This was a great recipe, my husband grew up in Nova Scotia and said his mom always made cod fish cakes. When he asked me if I could try to make them I was so thankful to find this recipe. I made it exactly as written, but added 2 tsp of Old Bay Seasoning. I was not sure what type of potatoes to use, as I wanted a type that would make into a patty and stick together well, so I chose Yellow fleshed potatoes ( yukon gold ) and they were perfect ! After the first bite my husband said that it took him back a few years as they were very similar to his mothers.

YUMMY! Like some others I adjusted a bit, added 1/2 chopped green and yellow peppers, some seafood seasoning, substituted cilantro for the parsley and added garlic. Also had to add 2 pieces of bread to it due to texture too wet and then rolled my cakes in panko bread crumbs before pan searing them. NEXT TIME I'm going to try instant mashed potato flakes to speed things up & spray the panko crumb coating with nonstick spray and simply bake them.  But I WILL BE making this again! And plan to try it out with Salmon too!

I only had sweet potatoes so I had to substitute, and had to add some bread crumbs to form good patties.  I used parsley, salt, pepper, paprika and some pre-mixed "southwest chipotle" spices to season the mixture.  I served this with a spicy sauce similar to a "bloomin' onion" sauce.  These tasted wonderful, my husband ate 3 of them!  I'll definitely add this to my recipe box.  Thanks!

I dredge my cakes in flour or panko before frying (if gives the outside a crunchy texture and seems to hold the cakes together) These are  simple to make and are so good. They remind me of the flavors of coastal New England where I grew up and enjoyed these as a child Thank you for this recipe!

Lydia, thank you for this recipe.   I had never tried fish cakes before - of anykind and found these wonderful!  My fiance loved them and me, not a fish lover, really enjoyed them!   I used fresh parsley and encourage others to do the same.  I also added lemon pepper as well as some salt and black pepper to taste.  

They came together fast and cooked just as quick - great for the rush after work!  Thanks again, Lydia!

I used this as my base recipe but changed things along the way.  I used tilapia as it's what I had at home and instead of boiling it with the potatoes, I baked the filets with lime salt, pepper and chili flakes to give it more flavor.  I added parsley to the mash and more seasoning and dipped them in breadcrumbs before frying them.  They stayed whole and were easy to make into patties. I'm not a fan of fish but I found them really quite good.  As I said, excellent base recipe to play around with.

I have never been a big fan of fish cakes. I eat them because the man loves them. The only change I made was to add some garlic, extra onion and saute instead of fry, and a serve with lemon wedges. He likes them, and that makes me happy!

I was looking for a recipe to use leftover fish....this was the closest I could find.   I made this for lunch, and had a couple leftover, which became breakfast.  I loved this!  Can't wait to have fish again so I can have my fish cakes.  I did add Old Bay and used chopped green onions instead of grated onion.

I can't believe I've never reviewed these fish cakes before. I've been making this recipe for a long time now and they're awesome! I too add a little bit of bread crumbs (I don't measure...just what gives it a nice consistency). I also add some crab seasoning and coat with flour. They are one of my kids' favorites and a staple in our house! Thanks for sharing.

These are wonderful.  However, I did make a few small changes.  Since I started with salt cod, I soaked it overnight, changed the water, simmered the cod, changed the water and simmered again to remove most of the salt.  I coarsely mashed some leftover boiled potatoes and added the drained, flaked and deboned cod. I omitted the butter and added a little fresh-snipped dill.  Then I coated the cod cakes with a little seasoned flour to make them really crispy on the outside.  My husband grew up in Nova Scotia, and he had to admit that these cod cakes were just like the ones he remembers eating when he was a kid - except for the dill, which he said was a really nice addition.  Thanks for the posting.

My husband says these are "to die for"! I did not have any potatoes but had leftover mashed potatoes. I did have to add more bread crumbs and I added coriander and cumin as also suggested.  And leftover fish cakes in a hamburger bun with lettuce, tomato and cheese and a thin slice of red onion...YUM!!

It has been a while since I have made this recipe, but I have made it a few times and its a keeper.  I like my food spicy so I add red pepper flakes, and that is the only changes that I make in this simple recipe.

So I had to make some changes bc I didn't have some ingredients. But it came out great anyway!  (Don't laugh) I I used instant potatoes and left out the onion. I added Panko breadcrumbs (maybe 1/4 cup) along with paprika, garlic, salt, and pepper. Fried using veg oil. Very tasty! It was my first attempt at any kind of fish patty and I'm happy with how it turned out!

This was yummy.  I followed the advice of several other reviewers (added additional spice, flour) to start.   used sweet potato,  because I had those on hand. The mix was a bit sticky. Used a light coating of flour which made it better to form into cakes.  The family liked it overall,  hubby and I both thought it could use a sauce, a little spicy kick.... Definitely thought refrigerating may help as others suggested. I saved some to fry up for dinner tomorrow in the fridge.   Overall great recipie, will try again! Thanks!

Good base for a great cake....but lots of adjustments needed. I used Tilapia but likely just about any fish would work. Use what you like! When mashing your mixture, wait to add the egg. Then you can TASTE and add whatever you like to your preference: salt & pepper, other seasonings (garlic salt or powder), grated celery or other veggies like bell peppers, fresh or dried herbs (I added chives), lemon juice or lemon zest, etc. (I WISH I would have added lemon zest)
Trust your instincts. If your mixture is mushy or difficult to shape, add bread crumbs, cubed toast, panko crumbs, etc. (I used store bought bread crumbs)
When you like what you taste... add the egg, shape the patties and refrigerate for an hour, or freeze for 20 minutes. This REALLY helps the patties stay together during the cooking process. 
Use a nice, hot pan with heated oil to get crispy cakes. Oh, I also dredged in flour before frying. 
Hope the suggestions help!

Since we like a lot of flavor, I used this as a base recipe and doctored it up a bit. Also, I like to use up what's on hand. Here's what I did and they were delicious! Thanks for the idea.  Used red potatoes, added minced red bell pepper, green onion (instead of the minced onion), chopped baby spinach, and of course salt and pepper. I coated the cakes in a mixture on panko and parm cheese and let them sit in the fridge to set up for about 30 minutes.  I then sautéed them in about 2 tbsp evoo in a cast iron skillet on the grill. WAY healthier than the amount of oil called for and they were quite crunchy. For a dipping sauce, I whisked sour cream, horseradish, Dijon mustard, and capers.  Hope you enjoy them as much as we did..

SOOO easy to make.  I added a lot of spices when I was boiling and when frying.  Definitely put in the fridge for a bit before frying or else they will probably fall apart.  I found 3-5 minutes a side for a pretty decent sized patty worked well.

this recipe was good. very good, but it needed some small changes.  when I made this, it was way too soft and sticky to form into patties, so I added some bread crumbs.  A few small changes that were more on a personal basis were substituting cilantro for parsley, adding salt and ground red pepper, and using less oil to fry in.  I also make a spicy chipotle mayo sauce that went great with these cakes, gave them just the right amount of kick!

Found this recipe while searching for a way to use all the fish in my freezer from my fiances fishing trips.  I'm not a huge fan of fish, but these were really good!  I did add bread crumbs to the mixture and also coated each cake with them, they were much too soft without.  I added some seasonings - garlic powder, seasoned salt, cajun - but would add more next time to give it a little more kick.  I had the deep fryer out for onion rings, so used it to cook these - lots of fat, I know, but it worked really well.  Served them with some lemon-dill sauce and my fiance was already planning on when we should have them again before he had finished eating!

These weren't a hit. Even though I added onion powder, black pepper and Old Bay, they were still pretty bland. They were also quite wet and sloppy - I think the egg I used was too large, and I should have added some bread crumbs. Thanks, anyway.

honestly I only used this recipe as a guide for my own creation. I used walleye, cheddar cheese, green onion, seasoned salt  and pepper, 1 whole egg, one white. Fried in canola oil.   Good ,but not something I'd make real often.

Excellent recipe. I added Old Bay. My husband took leftovers for lunch and commented when he returned home on how great the fish cakes were a day later.
Thanks for the recipe!

Definitely needs a little seasoning added. I used seasoning salt w/pepper and garlic. I used scallions and onions and didn't use the parsley (cause I didn't have any) and they were really good.

This recipe was excellent.  My husband grew up having cod fish cakes 
and he absolutely loved these.  I found that the cakes fell apart when
you tried to flip them during frying.  Next time I will add some more
liquid (maybe milk) to the mix so they fall apart while frying.
But in any case, these were delicious!!!

Good recipe but a bit bland for my taste. I added some finely chopped onion (along with the grated) as well as some Old Bay (a necessity for Marylanders when it comes to seafood, lol!). I tried frying in a small amount of oil and the cakes were fine. But they were even better after I lightly coated them with flour before frying. This recipe was made using 1/2 the ingredients - half of an egg was 1 tablespoon of beaten egg). I'd make this again.

First attempt at these. Tried refrigerating them as one reviewer suggested and ended up adding panko crumbs to help bind them together to be able to make patties. (Panko crumbs only breadcrumbs available) Had a gloppy mess which had my wife come to the rescue.  Had a few decent patties, and a bunch of cod-potato crumbs which I still found delicious. Will make it again, but I need to rethink the process, to be able to make proper patties.

This is a good basic recipe for cod cakes. I did use less potato and a bit more cod. I also put some Old Bay seasoning in it. So yummy that way.

***I made this a second time. I thought I had potatoes in my pantry but was wrong!! The only thing I had was one of those mashed potato mixes with cheese added. So I used that. It actually turned out pretty well. I added the Old Bay Seasoning mix to it again. It was yummy.***

Needs some salt or garlic salt, maybe some Old Bay and more fish, less potato.  As written it just tasted like the potatoes.  Kind of blah.

Great tasting; I followed NESMAR's advice in his/her review, which I believe was extremely helpful in improving this great recipe (especially the tip to coat in seasoned flour mixture before frying (white flour, seasoning salt, black pepper and paprika); good advice.

I made this tonight, and while the flavor was fine, it did need some additional seasoning.  The biggest problem, however, is that it was nearly impossible to keep these from falling apart. They crumbled from the start, and again in flipping them. I'll try something else next time.

I used leftover baked potato in this recipe, so I mashed that up in a bowl, added the cod which I had fried in butter, then fried onions and a garlic clove, then added some green onion to that at the end to wilt it.  Didn't have any parsley so added thyme. Added all that to my potato/fish mixture and mashed.  Scooped it out into 1/3 cup portions (which made 8 cakes), rolled in masa corn flour, then fried in olive oil.  It was good, my son who claims he does not like cod went back for a second fish cake.  I used one small and one large potato as I only had a 400g package of cod (which is 54g less than a pound), didn't need the egg to hold it together.

this precipe is a good basic recipe, but i find it was too wet, so i added some bread crumbs. i find it tastes like hashbrowns and scrambled eggs, so i eat it with ketchup. i find even when i add my own spices it's still lacking on flavor, but my family likes it so i make it every so often.

I actually made these with sole (it was what I had on hand). The first couple did not hold together very well, but they got better when I made the next couple a little bigger. When I make hem next time I might add a little pepper and possibly dill instead of the parsley. Otherwise my husband and I really enjoyed our special dinner =)

A great, easy recipe. I used haddock instead of cod and it was delicious! It was a little bland as the recipe suggests so I recomend a side of baked beans and a salad.

Really good.  Even my 4 year old liked them.  I thought it could use more fish though and next time I make it I will add more.  I also added Old Bay seasoning to my mix and it added just the touch of flavor it needed. Will make again!

These were ok, but not very flavorful.  I followed others suggestions and added some thyme, also cooled them in the fridge for over an hour. Then coated in whole wheat flour (we don't use white) with various Italian style seasonings.  I think next time I will try adding more onion, some crushed garlic, and cooking in a different oil (used olive this time).  I may try baking them too.  My toddler did enjoy them dipped in ketchup.

Followed the recipe exactly except used green onions instead of white and added salt & pepper.  Although I refrigerated for one hour, they did not hold together well when frying.  For the last few, I added some breadcrumbs which did the trick.  These tasted great, and would definitely make again with revisions.

I have to agree with some of the other reviewer that this was way too soft and sticky to form into patties. I even added 1/4 cup of bread crumbs. I was so disappointed because I have been looking for a good cod fish cake for years. I would not use it as written again. I usually prepare recipes as written but had to do something as they would not hold together and I didn't want to waste the ingredients. They were tasty so I have a 2 but it is not something I would make again as written.

This was a good base recipe for me. I add garlid, Thyme, and double the parsley, I omit the egg and butter because they are moist enough without the egg and I substitute the butter with Simply Best for a healthier take.

These cakes turned out fantastic! I took several reviewer's advice and so made some modifications. I boiled 1/2 onion and a clove of garlic with the potatoes. I added thyme, red pepper powder, oregano, and curry powder. I also refrigerated the mix and coated in seasoned flour before cooking them in 1/4 cup canola oil. Thanks for the tips!

Just like the ones in New England!  Make the fish cakes small (larger ones fall apart) and add salt.

These were fantastic. What a great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes.  I did dredge them in flour before frying, and next time I will coat them in breadcrumbs first, as I'm sure this will make them even better!

We LOVE these fish cakes! We will never eat "store bought" again. I follow the recipe exactly.  I have used different kinds of fish, depending what is on sale. We have pan fried and deep fried them.  Every way we have made them, they are delicious.  Thank you for the GREAT recipe!

Even with fish that had been frozen a bit too long, these came out delicious. I did add some extra seasoning and dredge them before frying.

I haven't tried this yet, but when a recipe calls for "two large potatoes" and I think about the multitude of potatoes sizes, I get annoyed.  How about "approximately two pounds" of potatoes" as a measurement or whatever her idea of two large ones weighs.

This was pretty good!  I left the fish and potatoes in a small dice and stirred together rather than mashing.  I added about 1/4 cup of matzo meal to help it stick together.  They did fall apart slightly, but still looked pretty good and tasted great!  Thanks!

That much oil really isn't necessary,and if they have a little bit of filler, the cakes will fall apart quite easily. Otherwise, this is a very tasty dish! Growing up on Canada's East Coast they were almost a staple food in fact. I've tasted better before, but they weren't too bad.

I prepared the potatoes and fish the day before. After forming the patties I dipped them in a mixture of equal parts breads crumbs and flour (as I found the patties to be sticky as I was forming them). Also, I baked the patties in the oven (425F) approx 12-15 minutes per side spreading a thin layer of vegetable oil on the bottom of the baking sheet (p.s. I have a gas oven,so temp may have to be adjusted). The fish cakes turned out good. This was the first time I have tried baking the patties instead of frying, as I wanted to cut back on the amount of oil used.

Did I miss something? These were very  bland. We used "Inner Beauty" hot sauce on them and that made them much tastier.

Amazing recipe.  I used cod, but can't wait to use it with salmon!  I did read and use other reviews to spice them up...1/4 tsp each of thyme, oregano, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper.  I also added 2 tsp hot sauce.  Thank you for the recipe.

I was surprised I liked this.  I added half a tablespoon of Old Bay seasoning as it sounded bland without it.  Definitely make it again, and it freezes well.

Excellent!  The only change i made was to add a bit more salt and onion.  This is very much like a potato pancake without a fish taste.  I will try the Ole Bay seasoning next time, I think this will as some great flavor.

The ingredients really come together nicely in this simple fish cake dish, but have you considered using tilapia fish instead of cod? Cod is on the Marine Conservation Society’s list of "fish to avoid" because it is widely over-fished and inefficiently managed. Tilapia, however, is on the society’s “fish to eat” list and does not require wild fish to be caught to feed it. The society suggests that tilapia is a more sustainable alternative to cod and that its plain flavor allows it to easily absorb other flavors from a variety of herbs and spices. I tried this recipe with tilapia and it was just as tasty! Perhaps you could alter the recipe or at least note the option of using tilapia instead of cod, in order to promote more sustainable choices.

I followed the recipe except that I used leftover baked cod (with panko crust) and leftover baked potatoes (scooped out of the peels and crumbled).  They were soft and a little hard to flip, so next time I will put them in the fridge to firm up as some commenters recommend.  A little bland but good with horseradish sauce.

These are the best. I didn't fry on the stove though.  My husband suggested that we try deep frying them.  Perfect.  Rolled them in bread crumbs and dropped them in until they were golden brown. We'll try again soon experimenting with other seasoning ideas.

my notes: omit onions add 2-3 stems dill fronds and fine stems only. Bbq cod leftovers for fish. new white and red potatoes approx 15 work awesome. sprayed both sides with canola oil and bbq on aluminum foil  and or directly on low temp oiled grill. 5 min per side.  added some extra salt and lemon herb dressing.

This is a good recipe but to have a great fish cake with crispy outside and not mushy inside you have to boil your potatoes and fish...mash them together real well, you can also fry onions and mash in them ,I personaly fry pork belly fat and onions until crispy then add a little butter..then place in fridge overnight,next day roll into balls then fry in a mixture of butter and olive oil to keep from burning...delicious!!!

I added salt, pepper and garlic. Mine were quite dry and crumbly. I may have needed another egg. But they did taste quite good with the Basa I used.

Loved this!  Thanks for posting.  I had some leftover (cooked) fish that my husband and son caught in the ocean.  Microwaved 4 little potatos, had to use dried parsley, but the result was terrific.

i made this last night but changed it as i had leftover tuna steaks, which were partially cooked. i boiled the potatoes then slowly added the tuna to the drained potatoes (the heat form the potatoes cooked the remaining tuna). i added fresh chillies,garlic,parsley and chives as well as salt n pepper. I breaded them and fried them for 3mins each. They were amazing!!

These were good.  Both my husband and my daughter enjoyed.  I add a lot more seasoning than was called for (seaoning salt, garlic, pepper, paprika, chopped onions, and more fresh parseley) and thankfully I did because my cakes were flavorful.  I also packed the cakes with herbed breadcrumbs which helped to keep them together.  Very good.

I made this recipe the way the recipe states but I had caught bluefish so I thought I would try that. It was so delicious. I made a mayo, mustard and lemon sauce to go with it. Superb. I will try it next time with cod.

What a great recipe.  I've made fish cakes before, but never one that called for potatos.  I had leftover potatos from the night before and thought what a great way to use them up.  Instead of cod, I used canned tuna.  It came together really nice and browned well.  I used only a 2-3 Tbsp of oil though.  You can add whatever spices or herbs you want.  I liked it the way it was but, I think I will try dill next time.

Other than adding Old Bay seasoning and using less oil, I followed the directions.  The cakes fell apart while cooking and were quite bland. I will not be making this again.

Shame on me, I should've read the reviews before I tried this recipe!  I made it "as is" and I had three big problems:  waaaay too much oil, the cakes fell apart when frying in the pan, and their taste was verrrry bland.  I'll try some of the other reviewers' suggestions on how to help both before I try this one again.

Recipe was simple and I used catfish! I also cooked it in the deep fryer and it made the best "munchers" I have had.If the potatoes are boiled to long or not drained enough the patties won't hold. And don't be afraid to spice it to your liking I used a little hot pepper and hot salt for a spicy touch. 
Thanks for posting this recipe.

Used grated garlic instead of onion.  And had extra chopped parsley and basil so added that, too.  And some grated lemon peel

Very good, I just added a little extra seasonings. Made them into patties, rolled them in panko, put them in the fridge for an hour, seared them in hot oil and then finished them off in the oven.

These were tasty. They really needed salt, easy fix. Also, they crumbled and were a major mess. After reading the reviews, I see my mistake was not putting them in the fridge to firm up. another easy fix. Agsin, great flavor. Next time, soon, I'll add more fish. Great texture as written but not enough of the flavor of the fish.

The cod cakes were good but i think they would taste better if the cod amount were increased and the potatoes were decreases.  The cod fish taste would then be more intense.

Looking at the ingredient list, I knew these cakes were going to be bland. So, I decided to add my own touch to the recipe.. 1st of all, I seasoned the fish with some salt, Old bay seasoning and garlic powder and broiled it( much better flavor, this way). Then added some more of the same spices to the mushed potatoes before adding the flaked fish to them. Last, I used some Panko bread crumbs on both sides of the fish cakes for crunchier outside. i Also, I made this prep in the morning and refrigerated the fish cake  till diner time. This way the cakes were firmer and were easy to handle while frying.

The recipe was easy to follow. I made a couple of  tweaks. I added Old Bay (the Marylander in me). I left the prepared cakes in the frig overnight to set. When I was ready to cook I added a milk and egg wash to the cakes and battered them with Zatarain's Fish Fri (yes Fri is spelled correctly). They turned out magnificent.

This was so tasty!!!!! My husband enjoyed it so much he went for seconds and even took some to work. I thought it was great and flavorful! I added extra garlic salt and i just couldn't help but take seconds as well! One thing to remember is to make them small enough to flip with out crumbling. I got carried away with a few of the cakes. But overall great recipe even if it falls apart lol! The ones that I made that were large and crumbled i placed on a separate plate to build them into a visually appealing fish cake so that it didn't look sloppy! Definitely a must try!!!!

Followed the recipe, but used leftover potatoes.  And I added some crushed red cayenne peppers for a little zing.  We loved it, and I'll make it again.

I used thyme, salt, pepper, and fresh garlic. I added a glove of garlic to the boiling potatoes and fish. And added the thyme salt and pepper to mashed mixture. It was delicious! This recipe is a good base for fish cakes leaving it open to add whatever spices you prefer. I also used flounder instead of cod. Yum!

I read several of the reviews so I used thyme, red pepper and a bit of paprika. I added some panko crumbs. I put the bowl in the freezer while I got the rest of the dinner fixed and the dishes done. I coated mine in a mix seasoned flour and corn meal so they'd be a bit crispy. Everyone enjoyed them.

Found the potatoes I used to be too watery. Recipe needs to specify Idaho or red, I used Yukon gold. Also my cakes fell apart so next time j will add another egg and bread crumbs. Severely lacking in flavor. Add spices.

Outstanding. It's always difficult to get my 12 year old son to  eat fish, but we all loved this recipe. I did follow many suggestions. I had two pounds of cod (we had none leftover) so I used 6 small russet potatoes.   I added a 1/2 teaspoon of dried thyme, oregano, garlic powder, onion salt  1/2 teaspoon of old bay seasoning ,  2 teaspoons of hot sauce, and 1/2 cup of bread crumbs.  I doubled all the ingredients in the recipe except for the butter which I kept at 1 tbs.  The only change I will make the next time, is to add 3/4 cup of bread crumbs, as a few of the cakes fell apart.  I might also try to make one large flat cake.  As well I only let the potatoes cook (once the water was boiled) for 10 minutes and allowed the fish to cook in the boiling water for another 10 minutes.  I fried them approx. 5 minutes a side.  If I see with the extra bread crumbs that they are firm enough I will attempt to BBQ them which will cut down on the amount of oil required.  Enjoy!!!

I added finely chopped celery and onion to potatoes for last 5 minutes of boiling. Added about a cup of plain bread crumbs.  Needed a little salt.  Cooked on charcoal grill.  Delicious!  Better than restaurants!!

For flavour try adding summer savory to the recipe, the kind you use in dressing. Flavour to taste don't over do it or under do it! You will not be disappointed coming from a Newfoundlander.

This is a good base for a recipe but the cakes were very bland and we had to add a lot of extra ingredients before we felt it had enough flavor.

I gave it one star, I tried based on 4 stars reviews, but definitely not try this again. It tasted more like potato cakes instead of cod cakes, very plain.

I changed the recipe by frying the onions until they were crispy and brown and added red pepper as well.  Added sesame seeds browned to the mixture.  Added celery (dehydrated) salt and pepper and garlic powder and one egg. Fried it,but it fell apart.  The recipe needs bread crumbs added..probably panko crumbs would work well.

The next time that I make the fish cakes I'll use the quisinart to blend the raw fish, add the cooked potato add scallions and onions bread crumbs..about a cup with the potatoes and then it will be a great recipe.

I usually make my fish cakes without the use of mashed potatoes, but I decided to give this recipe a try since I didn't have too much fish left and I wanted to add substance to the cakes. I'm not sure if the consistency of the fish cake is supposed to be soft/mushy, but they were. I only used 2 med potatoes and didn't add too much moisture to the mix. They were pretty hard to handle while frying up without the use of two spatulas :( I think I'll omit the potatoes next time or wait til I have more fish on hand. They still turned out quite tasty, though :)

I used pollock instead of cod, but the cakes still tasted great.  Fish sandwiches with tartar sauce were made out of the leftovers and these were great too!

This recipe tasted great, but maybe it was something I did wrong... I used the calculator to adjust it for 3 servings, but they were falling apart in the pan while cooking :-( I took the remaining uncooked mixture,and added some flour, and baking powder to it, and the rest of the batch came out really well. The taste was marvelous, but I think an adjustment might be needed in the mixture if cooking for a smaller amount of servings. Thanks for a great recipe.
