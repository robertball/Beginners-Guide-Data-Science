A bit too tart for me, so I added a lot of brown sugar until I got rid of the tartness. As a previous reviewer did, I added some paprika and it was wonderful!

I used this to marinate and baste some steaks in. It really made my meat very tender after a just a few hours but I think next time I will try adding additional spices with this mixture for for a flavor that is more my taste.

I made this as is, except a smaller version, and it was awesome!! I marinaded a pork shoulder for a day, then seared the pork on the grill for 5 min. per side, and put it in the slow cooker for 10-12 hours with the marinade....loved the flavor! I will definitely use this again

I feel horrible that it's taken me this long to review.  I started using this sauce over a year ago and have gone through over a gallon of it!  It is amazing on pork chops and chicken.  My daughter who never really like prok chops now says this sauce on them is her favorite dinner!  This week alone i used it 3 times.  My only alteration on the recipe is I half the amount of sugar.  Bravo Bills Sauce!

I just made it and OMG!!! The best part of it all is my hubby loves it!!! I basted the chicken with the sauce and then cooked the remainder; making a nice thicker sauce for dipping. Soooo happy with the recipe!!!
