My Dad makes this every year for Thanksgiving. Here is his recipe that has been tested to the MAX.: 12oz can OJ (not diluted) 12oz can Lemonade (not diluted) 1 cup sugar 2 1/2 cups Bourbon (we use a well) 2 cups tea (4 teabags + 2 ups boiling water)  Mix together & freeze in rectangle shaped tupperware for at least 24 hrs.  Scoop out into glasses & top with Champagne (my fav.) or Gingerale/Sprite/7-up/Clubsoda/Tonic  We triple this recipe and never have enough!

I keep a frozen container of this in my freezer at ALL times. Only I don't like Bourbon so I use Bacardi. It is great.

This was good but I did have to modify it a bit as it was more to the syrupy sweet side than I like.  I left out a just a little of the juices and a bit less sugar and added more of the tea and bourbon.  With this it tasted great just as it was and didn't even need to be made into a slushy (only needed ice).  I did try it as a slushy with the 7-Up and it was refreshing on the hot day we had.  For a company gathering though I may just make it in a punch bowl with an ice ring and I think it will be great!

This went over VERY well with some guests of mine the other night.  You may think I'm nuts (or an alcoholic), but a pinch more liquor wouldn't have hurt this much.  I'm not saying much...just a pinch!

Excellent!!!  This is great because it makes quite a few drinks but even if you're only serving a couple of people, you can keep it in the freezer until you're ready for more!  You don't waste a whole bowl of "punch" for just a few people.  It's got a great flavor!  I will make this again...even if it's just for me!!  (and store the rest in the freezer until I'm ready for more!)  YUM!

I can't wait to make this.  I  have been searching my grandmothers recipes for 5 years trying to find her recipe for slush.  She never used pineapple juice because she was allergic so i'll make the appropriate changes.  Thank you SO much for posting this....it brings back so many memories.  I'm gonna make some this weekend!  Side note-you can also use vernors or any ginger ale instead of 7 up or sprite.  Also, this makes a bowl full and will keep half forever in the freeer.

For one who cannot stomach the taste of bourbon, this was surprisingly good.  I think a little less sugar and this would have been 5 star.  Served with a variety of sodas/mix to customize to one's own taste buds.  Will make again for a group as this goes a long way.  Thanks Robbie Rice for a change of pace!

So good and refreshing!  I did cut down on the sugar and used a touch more bourbon b/c I wanted to finish off the bottle.  I will definatly make again.

Tip: To keep on hand for later use, store in the freezer in quart size freezer bags.  Push out the air & seal (test the seal!) and lay flat.

Yummy!  I have made this drink several times!  It always get rave reviews. We take it to the beach every year.  I freeze a big batch in ziploc bags then we scoop it out as needed and pour on ginger ale (diet:) I make these a little stronger than the recipes calls for - but they are good either way! OH -- and I do little or no sugar!!  It is pretty sweet already with all the juices.  I will sometimes add a little (1/4 cup or so)

This was so good.  We thought it was a little sweet.  I will cut the sugar in half next time.  We also used cold Diet Sprite over the slush.  YUM!

HUGE HIT!  And I came up with a way to solve the "too sweet for me/not sweet enough" dilemma, since I think that is  something that comes up with most any cocktail from margaritas to highballs:  in addition to offering with 7Up type beverage, I also had Club Soda next to it.  Those who tend to like a less sweet drink (like me) used the soda to cut the sweetness without changing the flavor of the drink.  Those who like a more "girly" sweet drink could add the 7Up in an amount pleasing to them.  We entertain a great deal and this was the first pre-made drink that we've ever used that really did please everyone.   One last tip:  while we did use a "well" type bourbon to make the mix, we also had some "Top Shelf" Bourbon there if anyone wanted to go a little stronger.  It was delicious as a small float on top of the frozen slush and really made it work beautifully. So no changes here to the actual recipe, but we did give guests the ability to customize it to their taste. 5 STARS FOR SURE!! (and I don't give 5 too often!) Happy Partying!

I was looking for a recipe to serve at my best friend's pool party. I gave it a trial run at my house the week before when I had company. They drank every drop! I drank quite a bit of it myself. This is excellent and I don't even like the taste of bourbon! Highly recommend!

This drink is beyond good, just plain irresistable. Like many of the other reviewers, I intend to always have some ready in the freezer.  A note about the lemon-lime soda....the first time I made this bourbon slush, I didn't realize I was suppose to pour the soda over the slush - I mixed the soda (7-Up) in with all the other ingredients and put it in the freezer - it was still fantastic!

this is great to keep on hand for drop in company...a perfect make ahead item for a party...and everyone who tries it enjoys it - even those who "hate" bourbon!  it isn't Christmas in our house 'till this is in the freezer :-) .  if you are having a family get together, divide mix in half, and add the bourbon to only one half, and even the kids can enjoy. (reduce the amount of bourbon, of course!)

i've been making this for years and highly recommend it. Always a party pleaser. And as another reader stated, it keeps well in the freezer so you can always keep some on hand. You can also substitute the Bourbon with som Seargrams 7.

I dislike it when people review a recipe and say how they made changes to it....lol well I am breaking my rule...this was great except for two things: (1) it made way too much - enough if you are having a party, but too much if its just 4 people one night, I will halve it next time, and (2) it was way too sweet - I will try cutting the sugar back or eliminating it all together, the OJ concentrate is super sweet enough and adding sprite too compounds the sugar. But loved the bourbon citrus taste and best of all it was nice and cool on a hot 4th of July

It was a HUGE hit at a Mardi Gras Party I went to. People loved it! I also used Sprite Zero instead of regular sprite to cut the sweetness a little. Making it again this weekend!

SOOOO delicious!  I am used to making Brandy Slush for my family but this was a great variation for my Mardi Gras party this year.  Thank you for sharing.  It was absolutely delightful!  The tea really added to the flavor.  Mmm...

I'd be in big trouble with the family if I didn't make a batch or two of these for our 4th of July reunion each year.  Liked by everyone!

This could be VERY good, but it was VERY sweet even though I omitted the sugar.  Next time, I will double the tea and perhaps use tonic water instead of sprite to mix it. That should make it 5 stars.

Not too impressed with this recipe.  Even though I cut back on the sugar, it was way too sweet.  Also, as another rater suggested, the pineapple juice overpowered the flavors.  I felt like it was a waste of bourbon!

This is a really fun drink for a girls night out.  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  Everyone seemed to enjoy.  I can't wait to have an exuse to make it again.

I've had this basic recipe since the 1970s. It was called "Hop, Skip and Go Naked"! It's deliciously refreshing, but it can pack a "punch," so be careful.

I served this at our annual Kentucky Derby party this year - with several revisions - and it was a huge hit!!  First of all, I served it as a punch rather than a slush.  I didn't change the citrus ingredients at all but I didn't add the sugar or the tea.  People raved about it and when I ran out, they were disappointed!  It will definitely be a fixture at all future derby parties.

Great! loved the juicy flavor, however, I think the pineapple overpowered the other flavors, so next batch I will put in less pineapple and make the tea stronger. I loved this drink and we are planning on making a few pitchers of it for vacation!

I used a ready made sweet tea, Margarita frozen non-alcoholic,  a frozen can of oj, apple & pineapple mix, mango puree and 1.5 Cups of coconut rum along with the 2  Cups of bourbon.  
Whew!  It was a huge hit and 1 glass did it, (10oz).

I have made this recipe several times... each a little different.   I used decaf tea.  My favorite so far is to cut the pineapple juice down to 2 cups and used only a 1/2 cup of sugar.  No matter how I make these, they are always a crowd pleaser.

I think this is a really good recipe but I have to tell you: you don't need to add sugar!
I made it for a large group and I knew the lemonade and the orange juice would be sweet on their own. I poured ginger ale over each glass of slush (which is also sweet enough).
Everyone loved them. I cannot imagine adding even more sugar to this recipe.  You don't need it. I promise!

This is a great summertime drink.  You can put it in a gallon plastic drink container with a lid and keep in in the freezer.  Scoop out with an ice cream scoop, top with soda to cut the sweetness or pop and garnish with an orange and cherry.
YUMMMY!

I have never been a fan of any kind of whiskey, bourbon or otherwise. But, trust me, THIS slush is THE BEST! It is SO light and fruity, and ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! I didn't add any sugar, because I don't like super-sweet drinks (and there is PLENTY of sweetener in the juice concentrates).  I also used the whole fifth of bourbon, because.. well.. just because.  It isn't a particularly strong slush BEFORE you add the Sprite.  Since I tend to mix the slush and Sprite Zero around half and half, it works out GREAT!  

I first made the brandy slush from Southern Living magazine, after a friend sent the recipe to me (it was really good, too).  I even made one with rum (it was.. meh). THIS is a KEEPER!

Tasty drink and very easy to put together.  As other reviewers suggested, I prefer mine with a less sweet mixer:  club soda.  And though I made my batch in late spring--I think would be a great holiday cocktail.  Thanks for the recipe!

While these were very good (everyone loved them New Years Eve), I felt it was a little too sweet for my liking.  Next time I think I'll use less sugar (that's just my preference).  Great recipe you can make days ahead and forget about until ready to serve!

I've made this for years and was forced to try it because I didn't like bourbon at all.  It converted me.  I think the secret is to fill mug or glass with slush, pour another shot of bourbon over it and then add a splash of ginger ale, sprite or champagne, as you prefer.  I keep on hand all of the holidays.
