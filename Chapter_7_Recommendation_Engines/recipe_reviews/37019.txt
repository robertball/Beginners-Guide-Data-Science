This is SO lucious.It is so juicy and DELICIOUS.I added a bit more Orange Liquer (Grand Marnier,the cognac is so good with this)because it didn't have enough of that "bite".SO good and SO simple it took 10 minutes and my husband thought it took at least an hour.

This recipe captures the tastes of decadence, luxury and sophistication that will make any ordinary occasion special.  Recipe is simple to prepare and will label the chef a gourmet.  Buy the best oranges you can buy and purchase the orange liquer in a minature.  An incredible winner that I will prepare over and over again.

This was surprisingly disappointing given the previous reviews.  The sauce was very subtle - the final result didn't taste much different than plain peeled oranges so there was no reason to add all the extra calories and cost.  I used only six large oranges and halved the sauce receipe - served it at breakfast for 4 adults (all of whom love fruit) on two consecutive mornings and only about a third of the dish was eaten.  16 large oranges would have fed your basic army - asuming that you could get anyone to eat it. A tray or bowl of fresh assorted fruit would be a lot more elegant than this disappointment.

Quite good!  I actually hollowed out two orange peel halves to use as "cups" for breakfast in bed, and it worked wonderfully!  I used apricot brandy instead of the the reccomended orange and it worked well...much cheaper too! I added extra of all the sauces and only used about 4 oranges.  This definately must sit overnight to make a difference.  I liked that it was an easy way to make fruit "special".

Made this for Thanksgiving.  Added a little more Grand Marnier than requested.  Definately use really juicy, flavorful oranges for best results.  My oranges were on the sweet/dull side and didn't measure up to the flavor I desired.  I added a bit of sugar to them and although they were dull at the dinner party they improved with flavor overnight and were great with breakfast.

I loved this! Hubby thought it was too sweet but what does he know. I only used two oranges but used half the sauce....that was being greedy. It could have been halved again & still had plenty (I'll bet he'll like it better when the sauce is lessened). I am out of Grand Marnier so I used Triple Sec & that worked surprisingly well. I did add a tbp. & a half of honey when I made up the sugar mixture & while subtle, it added just the right touch. I also cooked mine just a bit longer, stirring constantly, to achieve a thicker consistency. I didn't have time to chill mine longer than an hour (poor planning on my part) but it was very good w/ just that. This was the perfect side to dress up a typical bacon & eggs breakfast!

A nice way to jazz up orange slices and pass them off as dessert
