This is an awesome drink shaken or layered.  A friend of mine during my waitress days made a version we called a "Beam Me Up Scotty.'  You substituted Wild Turkey 101 for Grand Marnier, chilled with ice, strained and drank it quick before th 101 curdles the Bailey's.  Yummy.  But practice moderation or you will "boldly go where no one has gone before."

Stir before drinking.  I'm not sure if that's the official way you are supposed to drink them, but that's my preference.

Mix the three liqueurs in a coffee cup, pour in your favorite coffee and top with whipped cream, makes a great nudge. Jake

Yummo!  Takes me back to the 80s when these were the rage!  Just remember not to stir - these were made for shooting not sipping ;)
