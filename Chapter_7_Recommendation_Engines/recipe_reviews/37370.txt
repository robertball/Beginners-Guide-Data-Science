My co-workers were astound.  This was the best.  The use of the Kitchenaid Heavy Duty mixer added the comfort and ease of making this cake.  I did test the cake on children because of the alcohol content, but if given to them (I am not advocating you to do this...), they will enjoy it more than candy.  The glaze is the added touch.  The cake is very moist and the pecans to the bottom of the cake is the finishing touch.  I was taken back when the recipe required everything to be combined at once and mixed for only 3 minutes total, but it worked and it was "marvelous" as Billy Crystal says...Several hats off to Southern Living for this great recipe.  This is a five star recipe.

This is top-notch, but REALLY rich. The addition of pecans on the bottom was wonderful. I think you'll really enjoy this one, we did.

This cake was perfect for using up the last of the eggs with no granulated sugar in the cupboard.  It is incredibly moist but VERY rich.  I didn't add the pecans to the bottom, as I didn't have them and I used a 12 cup bundt instead of two 6 cup bundts.  In future, I would use a bit less rum, as I used Pusser's brand which is quite strong in flavor.

This is a veeeery wicked cake, but so delicious!!!! Its obvious from the amount of butter used it would have a melt in your mouth texture, this is definitely better than the dry Bacardi rum cake recipe!! Brought it to my new work and was immediately named favorite colleague thanks to this cake :P. I used only 10 oz of brown sugar and it was plentifully sweet. I also used Golden Rum Cake recipe for the drizzle, just because it had more rum in it :).

Delish!  I took the advice of another reviewer and used a different syrup recipe, poked holes in the finished cakes (while they were still in the pan) and poured the syrup on.  Great the first day, excellent on the second.  Super moist!  Had to control myself from eating the entire cake!

This is a wonderful cake.  I made it for an office birthday celebration and it was gone in 20 minutes!!  I don't believe I have ever seen anything disapear quite so quickly and the complements were numerous.  I followed the cake recipe exactly, I made it in a large (12 cup) bundt pan and baked it for 60 minutes.  I wanted a little heavier rum flavor so I used the Bacardi Rum Cake glaze.  This is definately a keeper, a cake I will bake often.

Wow!  Every bit as good as the other reviews said it would be!  The texture was perfect...moist and not too dense.  We ate it warm out of the oven, but I bet it will be better the second day.  I halved the recipe and baked it in a fluted bundt pan.  It only took about 40 minutes to bake.  The consistency of the batter was a little weird - much fluffier than regular cake batter.  I was a little worried about it, but it turned out great.

Very good, very easy to make.  I omitted the nuts, since I'm allergic, but followed all other directions to a 't'.

As with many other baked goods, I found that the taste was much richer the day after baking.  This cake also freezes well - I froze the second cake to use later and took to a friend's shower.  You couldn't tell it had ever been frozen.

I used imitation Rum extract instead of vanilla. I also used dark rum in the glaze (next time I may even try it with coconut rum) instead of white. It was absolutely delicious! Very moist and light - not what I expected. My parents couldn't stop eating it.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Wow - this cake was great!  I didn't have a completely full box of brown sugar (maybe 1 Cup was missing) but I felt the cakes were just sweet enough.  I also skipped the glaze and didn't this affected the cake at all, in fact, I think the cake would have been too rich and sweet with the glaze.  Try this recipe, you won't be disappointed.  Enjoy!

This cake is delicious, with a moist tight crumb, very flavorful.  I only used half the glaze (I made one large bundt cake), thought it would be too wet if I used all the glaze, and it was just right.  Glaze amount is probably ok if you make 2 smaller cakes.  I will definitely keep this recipe!

Everyone loved this!  I made one large bundt cake, which took a little longer to bake, but it was enjoyed by all.  I will definitely make it again!

Great Recipe! Well, actually I didn't get a piece of it-but every one else liked it and on person said it was: "The best peice of cake I've ever had!" I baked it in a large bundt pan-it took about 60 minutes to cook. I'll be making this again and hopefully I'll get to try it! ;)

What a great cake!  I, like others, made just one cake in a large bundt pan - it took about 60 min. to bake.  I didn't have pecans, so used sliced almonds and it looked (and tasted) like that's what it was supposed to be.  I didn't have a full pound of brown sugar either - it was more like about 1/2 lb. and also used egg substitute.  The cake still turned out just fine.  It was very light and fluffy in texture.  One recommendation I'd make is to specify that the glaze topping should be boiled in a pan that is NOT nonstick, especially if cooking it at high altitude.

Don't change a thing!  This recipe was the highlight of my Christmas giving.  I made these in loaf pans and gave them to only the special people on my list.  Everyone wanted the recipe, but I told them it was a secret.  Now they can't wait for next Christmas to have another one.

this just wasn't nearly as good as the more "traditional" pound cake i've made. it was too light to feel like pound cake, and too brown sugary to taste like it. also, the "glaze", once cooled, wound up like candy-caramel topping, so hard and sticky that i had to cut off the top of the cake so people could eat it. the 9 year olds in my family never turn down cake. if you try this recipe, DONT ADD THE GLAZE. as for me, i won't make it again.

Such a nice cake.  For the cake body, I follow all indicated but add raisin that soaked in rum for 1/2 hours, resulted in a foamy rum cake (rum flaovr is very strong that I like most).  For the topping, water I reduced to 1tbsp & add 1tbsp dark rum more which give a more strong rum flavor.  What I find important for the topping is, it reduces the sweetness of the cake body.  Thanks for the recipe.

Fabulous recipe...and a big hit at my father's day party.  

I tweaked it a little, by adding 1/4 cup almond paste (replacing the same amount of brown sugar) and 1 tsp almond extract to cake batter & glaze.

I didn't care for this bland dense cake at all.  I was the only one in my family to eat it.

I thought this was easy to make and it came out great, I didn't have pecans, so I used walnuts it was a hit everyone devoured the cake within minutes of putting it on the table the only change I made was to just add rum both light and dark rum to the topping and no water with the sugar and butter it wowed everyone and you can really taste the rum throughout the cake.  Thanks for a great cake.

WOW.  This recipe is awesome.  You know the phrase, "It melts in your mouth"?  It was completely meant for this cake.  I made it in two 6 cup bundts and took one of them to work.  Coworkers and family gobbled it up in one day!  The only thing I did was use a different glaze.  I like a more rummy glaze, so I used a glaze for a Bacardi Rum Cake instead.

Fantastic Rum Cake.  I made 7 small loafs, baked for 35 minutes.  They were perfect.  I haven't had a better rum cake.

Loved the cake but wasn't too crazy about the glaze. I found it was a little too thick and the rum taste was not strong enough. I normally make the golden rum cake recipe on this site which I prefer because you can really taste the rum. As a test I used the glaze from the other recipe on half of these cakes but it made them a bit soggy after a couple of days. I made one loaf cake and 9 mini cakes with my small bundt pan (baking them for 25 minutes).

This recipe turns out wonderfully!!  Easy to make and delicious each time.  A few notes though.  I've made it twice - once in a bigger cake pan which resulted in a larger (in diameter), flatter cake, and once in a smaller pan, which resulted in a smaller (in diameter), taller cake.  I had much better results with the flatter cake.  It seems to cook all the way through much easier and the taller one just would not cook through until it started to blacken on the bottom.  Also, I found that I really needed to grease the pan to get the cake out afterwards.  I would also cut the glaze in half next time.  You don't need that much at all!  Enjoy this cake and make it a lot!!!  It's worth it!

I loved the flavors of the rum and the brown sugar. Very delicious and moist. I also used a 12 cup bundt pan. Doesn't freeze well, though.
