Made this for dinner last nite, with a few changes. I used 2 lbs of sausage, (4 sausages, 1 hot, 3 mild).After cooking the sausages with 4 garlic cloves and 3/4 of a med onion, chopped, I cut the sausages into pieces about 1/4 inch thich,drained the grease, added fresh basil and a 28 oz can of whole tomatoes with basil,'squishing' the tomatoes. Also deglazed the pan with a little merlot. My husband and I really enjoyed it, the tomatoes made a great light tasting sauce. Used fresh grated parmesan. Blended well. We're having it again tonite.  Yum!

WOW!  Excellent recipe!  My husbands new favorite!  I added more garlic and more crushed red pepper.  I always steam the broccoli and toss it with the pasta and sausage at the end.  If the mixture isn't moist enough, I toss in additional broccoli steaming water to our level of moistness.  I only use hot turkey italian sausage (for fat/calorie purposes) but real hot italian sausage is the most flavorful.  I normally remove casings and cook the sausage until it's well cooked and crumbly.  I'm not a huge salt fan but I do add salt to this dish to compliment the dish well.  It was out of this world!  Thank you Susan!

I changed this recipe around alittle.  First I used chicken broth instead of oil. I also used sliced chicken sausage and omitted the red pepper flakes.  My husband and I enjoyed it.  Quick and easy.

I'm going to rate this as a 3.5 for how it is written.  I didn't intend on all the additions but it evolved as needed.  With changes it was 5+.  I browned the turkey italian sausage until crisp then added approx. 1/2 C chopped onion, approx. 1/2 C sliced mushrooms and 1 chopped tomatoe along with the garlic.  Also added a variety of spices.  Only used 3/4 lb. of Barilla Plus Penne and added the al dente pasta and thawed broccoli into skillet. Stired and added about a cup of chicken broth, 1/2 C skim evaporated milk and a handful of parm. cheese.  Take off heat and let rest 5-10 minutes stiring frequently until desired consistency.

This is an excellent recipe - garlic, red pepper flakes and hot Italian sausage - yum!  I have made this with both asparagus and broccoli, will try spinach next.  You can usually find Cavatelli at Italian Markets like A.G. Ferreri, but any pasta shaped like Penne will work great. A must try recipe!!

I made a reduced version of this with 2 sausages, a splash of olive oil, 4 garlic cloves (I like my garlic), about 1.5 cups chopped FRESH broccoli, 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, about 1/4 cup parmesan, and some fresh asparagus.  I prepared exactly as per recipe except I boiled the broccoli 6 minutes instea of 3; and I sauteed the asparagus, chopped, at the same time as the garlic in order to soften it.  The flavours were a very good mix & I would definitely to it again.  I recommend chopping the sausage BEFORE frying, assuming you want it chopped; it will cook much faster that way.  If you like this try Asparagus, Chicken and Penne Pasta  from this website, it is really very similar.

This is a keeper!  Easy and delicious.  I used a bit more sausage (hot) and used 1/4 c. butter with 1/4 c. olive oil.  I couldn't find cavatelli, so I used penne.  Still great.  Thanks!

Being Italian, this is a regular meal in our home.  Although I prepare it a little differently, the basics are there for a tasty dish.  I just wanted to make a very minor comment.  The dish that is pictured for this recipe is made with rotini, not cavatelli.  The difference is not just the shape of the pasta, but that cavatelli is made with ricotta cheese.  This makes the taste and texture quite different.  You can usually find it in the frozen section of your grocery store, or refrigerated at most Italian stores.  Better yet, (if you have a little extra time, make it yourself...it will add a whole new dimension to this recipe.

With a couple of modifications this became a HUGE family favorite.  The # of pans wasn't a problem, I cooked the sausage together w/ the olive oil, garlic & added a whole chopped onion, til sausage was cooked thru.  Then while the pasta boiled I poured a pint of cream into the sausage mixture & reduced it down to a nice thick creamy meat sauce to pour over the pasta & broccoli.  It's a huge crowd pleaser w/ a big salad & crusty bread on the side.  Delicious.

I omitted the olive oil, used fresh broccoli instead of frozen, and added 1/2 cup white wine and 1 chopped yellow onion to the sauteing garlic.

The store where I bought the sausage did not have spicy Italian sausage, so I used regular Italian sausage and added an extra 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes. Too, I couldn't find cavatelli pasta, so I used farfalle. Do note, you may need to adjust your olive oil amount depending on the kind of pasta you have available. Using farfalle--for example-- (bowtie type) requires more olive oil because there is more pasta surface to coat. My wife loved it and I thought it was pretty good too. I look forward to trying it with spicy Italian sausage next time.

One of my new favorite recipes. Used bow ties because I couldn't find cavatelli. Also added 1 red pepper and 1 onion and sauteed with the garlic and oil.I also added the red pepper flakes to the oil/vegetable sautee but served additional red flakes on the side for those that want more spice. I personally thought the spice was just right. Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't have sausage in the house so I used chicken instead which worked out just fine.  We're garlic lovers so a whole head made it perfect for us. For the same reason I significantly increased the parm and to make it just a little more saucy, I added in about a cup of chicken broth. Quick, easy and just delish. Thank you!

This is delicious!  I made a few changes as per other reviewers recommendations.  I deglazed the pan with some white wine and added a small onion with the olive oil and garlic.  After it had cooked to transparency, I added two 14 ounce cans of tomatoes with basil, etc.  I cooked this for about 1/2 hour, until the tomatoes softened.  I also added a small amount of salt, pepper, and a little extra basil.  I increase the red pepper because my hubby likes his food spicy, and I add it straight to the tomato mixture.  I've used both regular Italian and Italian turkey sausages, and found that both taste good in this.  The major difference is the texture.  Since I couldn't find cavatelli in my local stores, I used tri-colored farfalle.  It was delicious and pretty.  Also, make sure you use the baby broccoli florets.  It's so much more flavorful and tender than the cut broccoli.  I follow everything else as written, and this is GREAT!  It's a weekly meal in my house.  Give it a try!  You won't be disappointed!!

This is simple and really good. I used Hatfield Ital. Sausage, take it out of its casing, fry it like ground beef, adding onions, red pepper, and garlic halfway through cooking time. There was no fat i was surprised.I added a little olive oil. I boil the cavatelli, adding broccoli florets for the last few min of cooking time with pasta. I like the broccoli crisp . Then i drained it and threw it in the pan with the sausage. Salt, pepper and alot of fresh grated parm  Its simplicity at its best.

Good and easy. I couldn't find cavatelli pasta so substituted small penne regatti. Would definitely make this tasty, quick and easy dish again. Serve with a salad.

Tasty as is, but you can REALLY kick this up by roasting broccoli. Wash your fresh broccoli and chop it into bite-sized pieces, then toss onto a baking sheet (spread out is better than over-filling a small dish). Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Then peel a few (3 or 4) cloves of garlic and add them to the pan whole. Roast in the oven at 400-425 for 35-40 minutes until the broccoli is slightly browned and crispy. You can also add red pepper flakes (or any other seasoning, really).  Once the broccoli's out, you can add it to the dish and it will add a whole different layer of flavor! (would also work with asparagus, green beans, snow pea pods, etc.)

Here's a 5 star twist... when the sausage is done(drain) add 1/4 cup of EVOO, add the minced garlic, in 2 minutes add the crushed red pepper and 1/2 a bottle of Chardonnay (or a dry white wine)-- bring to boil-- then down to simmer ... steam fresh broccoli... put cavatelli in pan, add the broccol, poor the wine/sausage over the cav/broc, cover - wait 5 minutes, serve with Parm Cheese... PERFECT!!

Great tasting and simple pasta recipe!  It's a nice alternative to the traditional heavy tomato sauces, so I'll surely make it again every once in awhile.  We like the additional spicy kick from the crushed red pepper flakes!  What's nice about this recipe is that you can change it up by adding sliced black olives or diced tomatoes or spinach.  Thanks for the easy weeknight recipe!

I loved this one! Very easy, with tons of flavor. Used half the pasta called for (subbed penne) to scale it down for a smaller batch, left everything else the same. I'm not a huge pasta lover, but I couldn't stop eating this!

Pretty delicious, although I modified it a lot...I used 4 mild italian turkey sausage links (casings removed), fresh broccoli which I steamed in my rice cooker, about half a can of diced tomatoes (drained), extra garlic, extra chili flakes, about 5 fresh basil leaves roughly chopped, and only about 1/3 cup olive oil.  The only tricky part was getting the broccoli, pasta, and garlic/olive olive oil mixture finished at the same time, but it came out beautifully....My fiance was raving about how good it was! :)

I do something very similar using whole wheat penne and either spicy turkey or chicken Italian sausage, whichever one I can find.  I steam the broccoli as one reviewer mentioned, and I also remove the casings from the sausages.  Adding a little pasta water (or broccoli cooking water) is a good iea as well.  This is one of my favorite quick and easy ishes.

I loved this recipe.  I did not have olive oil and used a regular vegetable oil and it was fine.  Loved the garlic flavour! Also the pepper flakes give it some punch. I am not a fan of cream or tomato sauces so this hit the spot!

I rate this 5 stars because of the taste, but had these observations:  the recipe doesn't say if the sausage should be whole, sliced, ground, etc. I found that ground or sliced works well.  1/2 c oil is way more than I thought necessary so I reserved the pan drippings from the sausage and added about 2 T of olive oil to that, maybe 1/4 cup max combined. If you don't have cavatelli pasta, really any short pasta will do: penne, gnocchi, rotelli, etc. My family loved the flavors!  A wonderful recipe and easy to make...thanks!

I make this quite often, the only thing I do differently is I add chicken broth and reduce the oil.  Also I use Italian Sweet Sausage... I might like it with Spicy, will have to try it!

This is a really tasty recipe and makes for great leftovers. I've made this twice. The first time, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out superb. The second time, I didn't have garlic, so I chopped up half of white onion and sautéed it in the olive oil until the onion was slightly brown. I added a few tsps of garlic powder. It turned out even better.

This was a really nice change from the usual last minute pasta and tomato sauce dinner recipe.  It was fast and easy.  The only prep required was to thaw the sausage (I always have some Italian links in the freezer).  I removed the casings from the sausage and cooked it with a potato masher for a nice loose consistency.  The recipe doesn't say what to do with the sauteed garlic and olive oil, but there aren't too many options.  I added the garlic and oil to the pasta and broccoli before tossing it.  A pound of broccoli looked like a lot but it was just right after the whole lot was assembled, and with my broccoli-loving family I may even add more next time.  This is a great recipe to use if you have one of those nice pasta bowl sets as you'll need a large bowl in which to toss it all together.  Our seven year old wasn't here for dinner but I think she would have liked it.  It didn't seem that spicy but it depends on your sausage.  Some batches have more kick than others.  Anyway, I gave it five stars and DH gave it three (he wanted more sauce on his) so we are splitting the difference and rating this a 4!

Wow, this really grew on me as I ate it.  It's easy to make, it tastes great, and it's just as good reheated the next day.
Here are my changes: Used the noodles I had on hand (egg, penne.)  Used only 2 cloves of garlic.  Used fresh broccoli, and used English sausage plus my buddy's home-made hot sauce to make them spicy.  
That's a fair number of changes, but that's no problem for a recipe like this.

I love this pasta.  I bake/grill the sausage ahead of time, then dice it, don't use any oil at all, and add lots more cheese than called for, although I keep to the stated amount of parmesan (I usually add an additional 1 cup something like pepperjack or provolone or cheddar) to make extra cheesy.  
Then I toss the blanched broccoli, diced sausage, garlic, cheese, and red pepper flakes with the hot pasta (just boiled) and mix thoroughly to melt the cheese (sometimes add a bit of the pasta cooking water to make the cheesy coating lighter).  VERY GOOD

This recipe was good, but I think it could've been made better by simply adding 1/4 cup of pasta water.
I'm not sure what, but there was something lacking in this dish for me. Couldn't give it 5.

Very good and easy dinner!  I used sweet Italian sausge because that's all I had.  But, next time i'll definitely use the spicy, we like the zip it gives a dish.  I forgot about adding the broccoli to the pasta to cook so I just cooked it in the microwave and mixed everything together.

Simply delicious pasta dish! This is quick to prepare but has wonderful flavor, perfect for a busy weeknight. I followed the recipe as written but I added 3T butter to the olive oil mix, only because I prefer some butter in garlic & oil pasta dishes. I also added some sliced roasted red peppers for some color, and they really complimented the dish. I will use this dish often, thanks for sharing :)

I make a very similar dish which we like very much but with the following changes: Bratwurst instead of Italian sausage, steamed fresh broccoli w/nutmeg, mushrooms, grated Romano instead of Parmesan cheese &, like many other reviewers - lots more garlic. The brat, broccoli & mushrooms are each sauteed separately & set aside until all ingredients are combined in the final step.    Here's how I do it differently:  1) Bratwurst: I remove the casings from the Bratwurst (which I find more flavorful than Italian sausage) & saute the meat loose so that, in the final product, it's distributed evenly throughout the dish;  2) Broccoli/nutmeg: I peel the broccoli, cut into bitesize florets & steam just until the color turns a bright green. I then shock the broccoli in cold water to halt the cooking process & set it aside. When combining all the ingredients, I sprinkle 1/4 tsp nutmeg over the broccoli to bring out the flavor.    3) Mushrooms: Quarter & saute (button or crimini) mushrooms until golden brown.    In the final dish the pasta becomes a rich golden brown from the sauteed/carmelized meat & mushrooms.    Mmmmmmm...delish!

Got this recipe in my email this week and tried it on the spur of the moment- made it exactly as written except I used spiral pasta, and it was excellent- both my husband and 11 yr. old son really liked it. Will definitely add it to my collection and make again!

I liked this recipe because it was so fast to make. I used italian turkey sausage and discarded the outer casing. Any pasta type works. I used penne. To make a healthier version, I cut back to 3 tablespoons of olive oil and then added a 1/2 cup of chicken broth thickened with corn starch. That added some real flavor and sauce. I also added some oregano. The texture of the broccoli and sausage go well together. Will definitely make this again.

I bbq'd a spicy italian chicken sausage then added it to mushrooms cooked in the garlic and oil.  I added the pasta, broccoli and about 1/2 cup of the pasta water to the sausage and mushrooms with about 1/2 cup of parmasan cheese.  it was ok but it needed something else.  I would probably make it again if I used other suggestions of also adding a cream base or alfredo sauce.

WOW! This was a real winner. I couldn't find cavatelli so I used the bow tie pasta. I also didn't have cloves of garlic so I used crused garlic. It was very oily, next time I will cut the oil down to 1/3 C instead of 1/2 C. I don't know why some of the reviews thought it was dry. We used mild Italian sausage (the store we went to didn't have spicy, go figure). Make sure to add some salt & pepper to taste. A great tip is to always grate your own fresh Parmesean. It makes all the difference. We never use Kraft. Grating your own is a lot of work but it really enhances the dish. My husband raved about this recipe. I'll definetly be adding this into my dinner rotation, thanks Susan!

Excellent dish!  I did change a few things though, first I fried the sausage and garlic with some spring onions and a little water until no longer pink. I then drained the sausage and added the olive oil and FRESH broccoli, and red pepper flakes to it and one 14oz can of italian stewed tomatoes. I left it simmer for 5 minutes.  I then mixed it with the pasta and cheese.  WOW!! The broccoli had such a good flavor from cooking with the sausage and garlic.  The stewed tomatoes also gave it a little more juice.  Next time I might add some green olives minced. I will be making this a lot. Thank for the great recipe.

I have made this several times now and the whole family loves it.  It is quick and delicious.  I have varied the veggies according to what I have on hand and have found that zucchini, yellow squash, and bell peppers are also very good in this dish.  Thanks for a great recipe.

We all loved it!!  Tasted like something from a resteraunt.  Would change to a different pasta next time though, probably Penne.  Yum, can't wait to have it again.

This was great - I will be making it again and again - I added some basil to the oil while it was cooking and I was thinking next time I'll try it with spinach - My mom always made this as well but used to use broccoli rabe - that was always good too - I think anything even something like asparagus would be good with this - any kind of greens actually  :)   Thanks for submitting this - ohhh and btw I added plenty of red pepper flakes - I like it hot and spicy even though the sausage was spicy too :)

My family loved this..the guys all went back for seconds! I did sauté a thinly sliced a Vidalia onion along with the garlic. I used the florets from one broccoli stalk and 1 1/2 cups of frozen peas, as that's what was on hand, sauted along with the red pepper flakes in the skillet with the sausage after it was browned. Added @1/2 cup pasta water when combining the the pasta, sausage, and veggies. Served with hot garlic cheesy bread. Yum!

This was a hit with the adults and children.  I made the following changes: reduced red pepper flake to 1/8 of a tsp (I have small children) and added that to the oil when the garlic was cooking, increased the parmesan to 1/2 cup, used turkey sausage (1/2 sweet, 1/2 hot), and added a ladle full of the cooking liquid from the pasta/broccoli.  It came out great!

I thought this was really tasty and easy! I added some capers to give it a little bit of a salty flavor. I also used spicy Italian sausage plus plenty of red pepper flakes!

Very GOOD! I've made this quite a few times now. I've used Chorizo, beer brats and now regular brats and I found that we like the regular brats (casings removed) with this dish the best. I steamed the broccoli in chicken broth ahead of time and added onion when browning the meat. Poured in a little chicken broth to the meat to keep moist as it cooked. Then combined everything- mixed in about a half cup starchy noodle water and the parmesan, then a big handful of shredded Italian cheese blend. Delicious!

Awesome. I use a local hot sausage, and this really added some heat. I also had homegrown crushed red pepper, WAY hotter. I love hot food, so these are great tips for people who do as well! But, the recipe is terriiiifffic as is!

Added black olives, extra red pepper flake to the sausage and then at the end, salted the skillet before making sausage and then added 1 tsp salt to oil mixture. Upped the garlic to 1 heaping tablespoon. Very good. Need more veggies. :)

Thanks, Susan.  I now have a way to get my boys to eat broccoli.  This was fast, easy, and most importantly, yummy. I made a chili oil a la Wofgang Puck to pour over the pasta at the end.  Just heat olive oil, take it off the heat and add red pepper flakes.  I did about 1/3 cup oil to 2 tsp. red pepper flakes.  That can be adjusted according to your spice tolerance.  If you do this you might want to adjust the amount of oil used earlier  It also tastes great on pizza crusts.

Good recipe. Next time I will cut the pasta in half. Seemed a tad dry but was very good. Took the left overs and added some marinara for a different meal.

A little on the bland side all by itself but you can easily fix that with a little more spice.  I'd like to try it with mushrooms sometime when the wife isn't around.  Overall a solid meal!

Fabulous!! Especially with the modifiactions made by Boonie12! The mushrooms really complimented the other flavors. Hmmm, I wonder how artichoke hearts would taste in there? I'll just have to give it a try next time! Thanks for a great, restaurant quality dish!

I'm giving this only 4 stars because it's not incredibly flavorful. I really like the base of it as a pasta dish, but I think I will be adding more veggies, like maybe red pepper and more seasonings, like garlic and maybe onion.

While this was easy to make, the end result wasn't great. My boyfriend doesn't usually eat vegetables cooked, as they tend to be soggy. Unfortunately even when I cooked the froz broc for less time then the recipe suggested, it still ended up slightly soggy.

Only 3 stars because so much extra was needed to make this recipe more interesting. I also added a medium diced onion to the garlic and a large can of chopped tomatoes with 3 tbspns of chopped fresh basil and sugar to taste. Loved the idea of wine so I also added a cup of nice cab wine to the tomatoes about a minute before finishing them. It's important to toss the mixture and taste before serving so you can make any last-minute tweaks like adding salt/pepper. Lastly, please consider using fresh broccoli - I always find the frozen kind is slightly limp and waterlogged.

I made this receipe exactly as stated.  I gave this 2 stars because the pasta was dry.  Also, the portions are off.  I would cut the amount of pasta to 3/4 of a pound and add another pound of sausage.  Also I would add another step at the end:  Place all ingredients in a large, deep skillet and add chicken broth.  The pasta was just very dry without some kind of liquid or sauce.

Made this twice.. The 1st time not much taste.. The 2nd time I added olives, mushrooms, tomatoes, fresh basil, and fat free cream cheese. It was great the 2nd time BC of the additions. The 2nd time i'd give it 5 stars but the 1st got 3. Also didn't use any olive oil either time.. It was way 2 much anyway

Great Recipe!  I didn't add the sausage.  I added much more garlic and cheese, salt  & pepper.  It came out as good as my Aunts who passed away 2 years ago.  I haven't had it since.  I'm italian and at family gatherings she would make this from scratch. Next time I will try with sausage.  Loved it!  So did my sister-in-law and husband!

Fantastic.  I used shell pasta as that is what I had. Also cut recipe in half.  This is a keeper.

This recipe looks great, however, the picture shows rotini pasta not cavetelli.

Great quick and easy dinner. I substituted whole wheat penne pasta, and doubled the parmesan cheese. I cut the olive oil in half and heated it in with the sausage before mixing it with the pasta.

Yum.  Easy, simple, yet loaded with taste.  I used farfalle, and 1/2 spicy, 1/2 sweet Italian Sausage, added 2 Tbsp of butter, and used steamed broccoli from the bag.  Tasty and delicious!

This has become my husband's favorite thing I make! I have even swapped the italian sausage with the Jenie-O Italian Turkey Sausage, and it tastes great! I've used both broccoli & asparagus, both are good. Thank you for this recipe!

Sorry but this was just way too bland, no taste what so ever and I tried to doctor it up, adding more garlic, chopped tomatoes with spices and other stuff.  You need to change it so much its not the same recipe, will not make again.

This was really good.  Light but still flavorful.  Made a few changes: used some basil flavored olive oil; added a chicken breast; and, cooked sausage and chicken with onion, garlic, oil, and pepper.  Was really good!

Great recipe for a quick dinner.  I used fresh chopped broccoli that I added to the boiling water 5 minutes before the pasta was done.  Also, if you take one cup of the hot water from the pasta pot then add it to the remaining ingredients at the end it helps the pasta from getting a little on the dry side.  The water soaks into the pasta with the other flavors and it keeps it tender.
Thanks for the great recipe.

I used lean turkey sausage and added more red flakes as I couldn't find spicy sausage.  This is now my new favorite and I too will try different veggies.  Didn't look for cavatelli but used rotini and I agree any shaped pasta would work.

I've made this many times.  I've tried other variations too.  Asparagus instead of broccoli and shrimp instead of sausage. Most of the time I make it just like the recipe, except I use a shredded 6 italian cheese mix from my grocery store (parmesan, mozzarella, romano, asiago, fontina, provolone) and I use quite a bit more than 1/4 cup.

Super yummy!  Couldn't find cavatelli so I just used rotelle pasta.  Everything I kept the same.  Quick and easy to make.  Also, makes a lot!  Will be making this again.

I thought it was a little dry, even when adding more cheese. Good for lunch at work the next day, since it packs up nicely, and easy to re-heat. I would add more vegi's next time (i.e. peppers, tomatoes) and fresh herbs.

This had excellent flavour, and was easy to make. I sauted the sausage with a dash of chilli oil, and caramelised onions, and garlic paste; boiled penne pasta, adding frozen peas for the final 2 minutes. I added the pasta and peas to the pan, with sesame seeds and parmesan, and stirred to mix evenly. I served with parmesan and freshly grated black pepper.

This was excellent!  This made about 7 pretty big servings our way.  We did a few things differently:  we used turkey sausage instead of pork (which we sauteed and crumbled), we used 1 lb 3 oz of fresh broccoli instead of frozen, we only used a little more than 1/4 c of olive oil to save cals, and 14.5 oz of penne pasta (dried), and we also added about 1/2 jar of sundried tomatoes packed in oil.  I think this would be just as good without the tomatoes.  Will definitely make this again!  Oh, and be sure to use a good quality olive oil since it is the sauce.  :)

This is so tasty! This is a really fast and easy recipe for a weeknight meal. Only changes - I used 6 cloves of garlic since we really like the garlic.  I also used turkey sausage in place of regular pork.

This was pretty good, but there was nothing that really grabbed us about it, it was just pasta with broccoli. I added two cans of diced tomatoes, because we like "saucy" pasta.

Very good with some changes. We have a large family so I doubled the broccoli and sausage and made almost 2 pounds of macaroni. I added more garlic, more olive oil, some butter, Italian spices. This is a good basic recipe that you can play around with to suit your own taste.

Great use of ingredients on hand. We used venison sausage and fresh broccoli. I wanted something different than a red sauce tonight and this hit the spot on a cold winter night. Very tasty, even the 11 year old son liked it.

Good recipe... I liked the spicy sausage.  To save time, I might cook the sausage ahead of time.  I used bow tie pasta, and it made a huge bowl - enough for lunch leftovers.

My hubby substituted Green Peppers and Mushrooms for the Broccoli, since that is what we had on hand.
He dilikes Parmesean, so we used a mixture of (very) old cheddar and Marble.  It probally would have been tastier with fresh Parmesean.
We used Turkey sausage instead of italian and it was just as good - if not better.
Will make this again using any veggies we have on hand and Parm cheese.

I liked this dish but not enough to make again.  I did follow another review and added a pint of cream to the sausage, which I'm very glad I did.  Without the cream it would've been dry.  I also noticed it was a bit bland so I added salt and pepper.  I still think it was lacking something.  I make a dish similar to this except I use cubed cooked chicken instead of sausage and stir in a can or two of chicken broth instead of olive oil, although, you have to saute chopped garlic in a little olive oil in a small frying pan. I also don't use red pepper flakes in that dish. I prefer the chicken one over the sausage.

Yum yum yum!! I love the combo of broccoli, hot sausage, garlic, oil, and spice.  My only suggestion (for an occasional treat) is to serve it with Barilla cheese and garlic tortellini instead of the plain pasta--it's amazing.  Overall, my favorite type of recipe--simple and delish.  Bravo!

This was sooo good! I used fresh brocolli and steamed it separately and used a mild sausage(we're trying the hot version next time) and skipped the red pepper, but it was excellent!

I suggest using frozen broccoli florets, not chopped broccoli. Some pieces were tough to chew. Otherwise, this is an excellent recipe, and it will be going into the rotation.

Added a couple fresh chopped tomatoes and used spicy Italian bulk sausage (and didn't add any red pepper flakes).  Really tasty.

My husband is a picky eater and he loved it!  Instead of Italian sausgae we used cheese and garlic sausage and he compared it to eating at Olive Garden.  So easy and so good!  Definitely putting in one of  my weekly or frequent dinners

Great, simple recipe. I left out the garlic and used deer sausage. My kids love them some deer sausage. I also added fresh chopped broccoli to the pasta water for 1 1/2-2 min instead of frozen. Delicious.

Makes a ton!  I don't have cavatelli pasta so I made it with tri color rotini.  I added 2 cans of diced tomatoes and garlic to the suasage mixture then let some of the juice from the tomatoes reduce.  I completerly forgot the olive oil but didn't really need it with the juice from the tomatoes.  Needs a bit more seasoning but otherwise a good dish. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was delicious. I sauteed chopped onion with the garlic and olive oil and used garlic and herb seasoned chicken sausage. I also threw in a little extra red pepper flakes for a kick.

Followed recipe exactly the first time. It was very good, but I am not a huge fan of italian sausage. Decided to make it again and used chicken. Turned out great! very quick and easy meal to make.

LOVED IT!  In fact my whole family loved it, with one very picky eater!  I used whole wheat pasta and fresh broccoli.  I put the red pepper flakes in with the evoo and garlic, and used a little more cheese.  I couldn't believe how few ingredients this used, and was so simple, with such great results!  Thank you tons!

Yummy! I did add a little more garlic and cheese and think I'll add just a touch more the next time.  I also used baby spinach in place of broccoli and think  sauteing a bunch of sliced green onions would be great as well To me, the dish needed a little color.  The addition of some finely diced Roma tomato added just at the end would be nice. My husband and son thought the dish was great just as is.

Very flavorful. I used 1 pound of sweet Italian and 1 pound of hot link sausages. I steamed the links in a mixture of white wine and chicken broth. In some butter (1/4 cup)I sauteed mushrooms, 1 small onion and diced garlic (I used three very fat cloves), seasoned with garlic powder, a dash of sea salt, and fresh ground pepper. After the links were cooked through, I used my fat seperator to rid the poaching liquid of fat, and cut the links into 1" rounds. I added the veggies, more wine and chicken broth, fresh broccoli that I choppped, some more garlic powder, and 1/4-1/2 cup of grated parm cheese. I simmered all (covered) for an hour and a half till all was tender and poured it over the cavatelli, mixed well, and added more cheese. The end result was delicious and something that I will make again. I did not use the olive oil, and since I had half hot sausages, I did not use the hot pepper flakes.

Great Recipe.  The only change I made was to add some marinara sauce to the sausage the last few minutes of cooking.  Added a little extra flavor and color.  Very good recipe!

I make this dish regularly but I boil, bake and broil sweet sausage and I do it in chicken broth! Keeps it moist and tasty! and I use black pepper instead of red...just a suggestion.

I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  My family wasn't too pleased.  I might try it again with some changes.  One pound of sausage definitely was not enough.

Did not use the olive oil because we were out but I did add about 3/4 c. of sour cream and my 4 year old ate this right up. A very quick meal that we all enjoyed.

Pretty good... Next time I might find a way to make it a little saucier, a light cheese sauce, for the husband. I thought it was good as written but think a little cheese sauce would be a nice addition.

I followed some advice from others and added chopped onions to the sausage while it cooks.  I also substituted bowtie pasta for cavatelli because its what I had on hand. This was really good pasta! A great dish for potlucks!

This was pretty good with some modifications. I added onion and mushroom like a previous reviewer suggested. I omitted the red pepper flakes and the olive oil (seemed like a lot of oil, I sauteed in the drippings). Added a splash of milk along with the cheese. I was worried that there wasn't really a 'sauce' but the cheese and milk-splash turned out to be enough.

This was absolutely amazing!  Not only did my husband love it but my 5 year old and 18 month old daughters both loved it as well!  This was also so easy to make and you can adjust the red pepper flakes to your liking.  I will definately keep this one in my recipe box!

I took the basic concept and went with it. Used spicy Louisiana sausage instead of Italian (and, only 1/2 lb to reduce fat and calories). Sauteed this with bell pepper pieces and onion, then sprinkled with garlic powder (too lazy to peel and mince "real" garlic).  After a few minutes, poured in a can of evaporated milk.  Seasoned with dried parsley, salt and crushed red pepper.  Added cooked farfalle (1 lb pre-cook weight), and chopped, blanched fresh broccoli (3 mins).  After all the ingredients were tossed, I sprinkled with parmesan, let it rest, then melt, then re-tossed, and... WOW. My new favorite food.  This is a great flexible recipe!

This was so good and so easy! I make some kind of pasta w/veggies at least 2x a week, and the sausage in this added that extra "yum" factor sometimes missing from my vegetarian meals. I wish I could have used cavatelli, but my store didn't have it, so I used penne. Also used fresh steamed broccoli, instead of boiling frozen in with the pasta. I don't use crushed red pepper often and the last time I used as instructed in a different recipe it was way too hot, so I was a little hesitant, but the heat level here (with regular italian sausage, not spicy) was just right. I was also extra generous with the fresh grated parmesan. Will definitely make this one again. Thanks!

I made these changes: used mostaccioli instead of cavatelli, used sweet sausage instead of hot and increased pepper flakes to compensate, used about 1/3rd as much oil as was called for.  This was fabulous -- something about the sausage and broccoli goes really well together.  If I made it again I would add a little chicken broth or something during the mixing stage; it is slightly dry (probably my fault for using less oil).

A high five for the family really liking this dish....when my almost 11 and 3 yr. olds eat until their plates are clean....thats a yummy dinner(and they ate all of their broccoli!). I did use sweet Italian sausage cause of the kiddies and frozen cavatelli. Served with garlic bread..(whats a little more garlic?). Will make again, thanks!

A keeper!  I took others advice and added onions and mushrooms, additional red pepper flakes to the saute. I used only one mild Italian sausage, browned and deglazed the pan with some dry white wine.  I used the fresh broccoli I had and added some fresh oragano from my herb garden, halved grape tomatoes & lots of Parm. Reg. at the end.  This is fabulous with a nice earthy red blend from Argentina.

I have made this at least four times since finding this recipe last year! I absolutely love the kick of spice and heat! It's pretty healthy too as the pasta is coated in only olive oil. I use fresh broccoli, not frozen, and sometimes add chopped caramelized onions to the mix. And when I don't have cavatelli I use practically any type of pasta. Wonderful meal, it's one of my faves!

I couldn't find cavatelli pasta in the store so I used whole-wheat spaghetti. Not bad! Also, this is probably my fault but the garlic and oil was too strong of a flavor. Definitely get the spicy sausage! I didn't and wish I had!

This was better than delicious. I couldn't find cavatelli so I used a whole wheat pasta. The next time I would use less than 16 ounces unless using the cavatelli. But it was still excellent. I can't wait to make it again, this time for company.

Thought it was a bit bland. Had to add salt and more red pepper to it. Added the red pepper to the oil as it cooked as others suggested. Might alter and try again.

This is a very good and very easy weeknight recipe.  Definitey use fresh parmesan - we also had some on the side to add when serving.  Only change we did was to add halved cherry tomatoes at the very end when you are tossing everything together - about 3/4 pint worth.  Added color and a nice acidity.  Would make this again for an every day meal - lots of leftovers too!  YUM!

My husband ate one huge serving, then went back and finished what was left in the pan.  I guess that meant it was good!  I used frozen shrimp instead of sausage, because that's what I had.  I put the garlic in my little food processor with the olive oil and chopped them, then heated the oil with the garlic.  I used frozen shrimp, thawed them in cold water, then added them to the pasta for the last two minutes of cooking to heat them through.  I also added tiny tomatoes and pine nuts, and topped it with freshly grated aged Parmesan.  Really, really, good!

This was very good! I only had plain sausage so I 'Italian'ed it up myself with Italian seasoning, crushed red pepper, onion and garlic powders, and chili powder and a little sage. It turned out great! Made a ton, too...thanks for a great recipe.

This is a great recipe!  I am an organic gardener and had a bumper crop of broccoli to use.  When searching for a different way to use broccoli, I chose this recipe to try - they say variety is the spice of life!  I added the fresh broccoli at the end of the pasta cooking time as per instructions but only for about one minute to turn the broccoli bright green.  I did add one can of fire roasted diced tomatoes and cut back a tad on the olive oil.  I also made this using old-fashioned smoked link sausage, cutting the sausage in thin rounds and browning the sausage to render all the fat (discard fat),  This change also makes a very good dish.  I have used several different pasta shapes to use what was in the pantry with equal success.  Try this - I think you will be pleasantly surprised.

love it! Tasted great and was easy. I omitted the red pepper flakes (boyfriend hates spicy food). Instead of frozen, I used fresh broccoli, parboiling it for five minutes before adding it to the pasta.

A favorite pasta dish. I follow it pretty much exactly, except i use turkey sausage and saute some onion with the garlic. It is a wonderful and very lite tasting pasta dish. In other words, its great with out having to be smothered in sauce.

Delicious! I added an onion with the garlic and then added half a package of chopped frozen broccoli and sauteed with them.  Then I added half a package of Tyson Oven Roasted Diced Chicken Breast and added 4 links of italian sausage (that I had precooked in the same pan and then sliced).  Then I added a little more extra virgin olive oil, a couple pinches of dried oregano, and a few splashes (maybe about 1/2 cup) of evaporated milk.  Finished at the end with parmesan cheese folded in.  My husband said it was very good and tasted like we were at a restaurant.  Will definitely make this for company since it is easy AND delicious.

I would suggest anyone attempting this recipe to look at Boonie12's remarks.  I followed those ammendments and it was absoultely fabulous.  I would rate it 5 with the ammendments, three without.  So 4 for average ;-)  (Oh, I used egg noodles b.c. that's all I had...yummy)

I cut back on the oil to reduce the fat and calories. I used fresh broccoli and I thought it would have a longer cooking time so I put it in w/ the pasta for five minutes and it all fell apart. It still tasted good, but I wish I didn't cook the broccoli so much. Next time I will know better! Thanks!

Simple and Delicious!  The only thing I did differently was use Rigatoni instead of Cavatelli only because I thought I had some in the freezer and it turned out to be Gnocci LOL!  Thank goodness I had rigatoni to use!  The whole family loved this dish, its a keeper!!  Thanks!

This was okay. It didnt jump out at my like I thought it would. Bf asked me where the alfredo sauce was lol. So maybe if I decide to make it again Ill add something like that. Im a younger cook so maybe if I play with it some other time I can make it a 5 star in my recipe book!

Didn't have great expectations for this, but tried it because I wanted to use up some sausage. I was pleasantly surprised. Everyone went back for seconds. You definitely need real grated parmesan, not that powdery stuff. I also used half butter/oil and increased the garlic. This is a good quick fixing dinner. Thanks for the recipe.

This was pretty good.  I too, made some simple changes.  I used Italian turkey sausage and cooked and crumbled it like ground beef.  Then I added Italian seasoning and a few extra shakes of red pepper flakes and, of course, more garlic! We LOVE garlic!!! I also used penne because I didn't have cavatelli.   Good quick weeknight meal.

I added onion and mushrooms and used turkey kielbasa to cut out the fat.  My husband loved it and asked that I make it more often!  I love that it's fast and I have dinner on the table in less than an hour.

I followed the recipe exactly, but found it just greasy and bland and really not spicy at all as suggested. With the proper revisions it would probably be great, but not something I'm trying again.

This was really tasty.  I used spicy Italian turkey sausage to cut calories and I added some red bell pepper.  I also put in at least 2x the amount of crushed red pepper.  I think it could use some more vegetables as well, but I'm not sure what I would add.  Maybe just more brocolli.  It is a really good combination.

I followed the recipe without deviation.  It was just "ok".  We found it kind of bland like another reader.  It really seemed like it was missing something.  I'll try it again and next time follow some of the other readers suggestions.

I love, love, love this recipe!  I've made it many times.  Although I have made some changes.  For one, I bake the sausage on a cookie sheet in the oven.  It takes about 30 minutes on 350.  While that is cooking, I start the pasta and broccoli.  I cook those in separate dishes, because when I added the frozen broccoli to the pasta water the first time, it cooled it off too much and took too long to get back to a boil!
Also, I replace half the olive oil with butter for a richer flavor, use fresh broccoli, omit the parmesan cheese and add parsley.

In any event, this is a great starter dish to taylor to your tastes.  A quick, satisfying and tasty dinner!

This recipe is a great starting-off point.  I too was worried that it would be dry, so I added 2 cans of diced tomatoes w/onions & garlic.  I still used the red pepper flakes & broccoli, and I used bulk sausage (I couldn't tell if the original recipe used bulk or not).  My husband & I really loved it.

This recipe was very good. I substituted the cavatelli for farfalle pasta (my family likes it better).. I added some chopped up Red Pepper and simmered with the garlic. It's a keeper in my family..

It was just okay, not much flavor. My mom and stepdad enjoyed it. We added a liitle cheese just to give it a little more something.

Wow this was a good recipe! I had to use a lot of pans tho (one for heating the olive oil, one for frying the sausage, and a pot for the pasta... then a bowl to finally mix them all together).

very quick and easy. I probably added a little more olive oil and red peppers. I used bowtie pasta.

The kids went crazy over this.  I used mild sausage instead of hot.  The adults felt there was something lacking.  I will try some suggestions from the other reviews - perhaps Italian flavored tomaoes, to add some depth to this recipe.

This has become one of our stock recipes because it is so easy and it tastes so good.   We use a lot more broccoli and sausage than the recipe calls for because we like a higher "stuff to pasta ratio" but the ingredient mix is outstanding.

Excellent weeknight meal. I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen, mild Italian sausage instead of spicy, and served red pepper flakes on the side.

My DH first introduced me to this recipe more than 15 years ago--it's still a favorite.  My best results have been by cooking the chunked sausage (turkey) in the olive oil and adding fresh  broccoli along with the garlic and hot pepper to the sausage.  Wonderful, wonderful!

Without the sausage and broccoli this was Aglio e Olio the dish Italians had when the pantry was bare or years ago when Catholics could not eat meat on Fridays. I tried this because I don't usally put sausage in and I decreased the red pepper flakes to 1/4 and put in with olive oil and garlic to infuse the flavor. I also added the broccoli for 6 mins. I also tried with fresh spinach loosely chopped and added to water last 3 mins.

I used campanelle pasta since I couldn't find cavatelli, used sweet Italian sausage instead of spicy and used the frozen broccoli crowns. I also omitted the crushed red pepper flakes because my kids can't handle that, but my husband and I added the flakes to our own food. Delicious! A big hit. Thanks!

I love this recipe. I make it all the time because it is so easy. I use regular sausage instead ( I like heat, my stomach doesn't LOL!) and substute a small dash of cayenne in place of the pepper flakes but the taste is stil amazing. This is a great spring/summer pasta dish!

This was okay..  Good to try, but probably a one time thing. I never found Cavatelli noodles at my local Safeway store, so it must be some "special" noodle.. It did have a good taste but thought it was a little dry.

I loved it, and so did my boyfriend (he's often somewhat...picky...).  I only used a 10oz pkg of broccoli, but it came out ok.  Just the right amount of heat in the recipe.  Thanks!!!  :)

My husband & I enjoyed this recipe, but the kids didn't care for it too much.  I used 1/2 lb sweet sausage and 1/2 lb hot.  I left the hot pepper flakes on the table.  Next time I would follow someone else's suggestion to add chicken broth.  The recipe as is just seemed a little bit too dry.  Otherwise it was fast, easy and good for a quick weeknight dinner.

Quick and easy and very tasty. I didn't have parm so I used monterey jack cheese and it tasted really good. I also used a kielbasa as that is the sausage I had on hand and then just added extra pepper flakes.

I made these subtle changes. I used real broccoli and fresh squash and about 5 garlic cloves, I added broccoli and squash to the garlic browning stage. When done I added all of the ingredients, including fresh squeezes of basil (the kind in the tube) into the pasta ensemble and finally at the end of everything, when everything was mixed I added a little garlic salt. It was great. I would make it again.

So delicious and so easy! I added shredded carrots, diced tomatoes and black olives to the garlic and olive oil. I also added steamed broccoli to the pasta/sauce mix at the end and topped with plenty of shredded parmesan cheese. Thanks for the easy tasty dinner, I can't wait for leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

WOW! So yummy.  I read a reviewers comment about the pasta in the picture not being cavatelli, so when I went to the store I made sure I got cavatelli pasta.  I didn't use spicy sausage, just regular Italian sausage, and I didn't add the red pepper flakes.  This turned out perfect, and made enough for left overs to be frozen for another time.

I've been making this recipe for a while now and it truly is a family favorite.  I didn't change a thing.  Fresh or frozen broccoli, you can't miss.  Try it!

Simple and tasty! I opted out on the red pepper due to little ones sensitive to "hot" spices in the household and added a variety of Italian seasonings ... Less olive oil and a great option for leftover sausage; Parmesan is delicious on top.

I really liked this. The spicy sausage gives it a good flavor and it was a very light pasta dish. I did not have any parmesan, but I would recommend using it. Mine seemed to be lacking something. Good recipe!

I made a half version of this recipe. I used turkey sausage links and whole wheat spirals, and left out the olive oil. I used 3/4 cups of chicken broth instead. It was a little dry, but very good! 4 servings with 364 calories and 4.6 grams of fat.

This recipe was delicious. I am Italian and the picture you have for the pasta is not Cavatelli it is Rotellini.  Anyway, my kids loved this recipe.  I used penne pasta since I did not have Cavatelli on hand but all the same it was number one in this household.  It is definitely a keeper.

I didn't care for this, which is unsual since there are very few pastas I don't like.  Husband said it was good, but wasn't overly excited about it.

This is a simple and tasty recipe that can be made fast.  My three boys all loved it.  The only changes I made were draining all but 1 t. of the grease and using a little pasta water with it after after garlic is cooked. A little healther I guess. :)  I also substituted whole grain pasta. My kids have requested a repeat soon.

My dish looked GREAT, but seemed rather dry.  My family accused me of leaving out the "sauce".  What keeps it moist?  I saw where someone used chicken broth... does that help?

This is a great recipe.  I used a hot italian sausage, casing removed, and did not add the additional red pepper flakes as the sausage was very spicy itself. I also used fresh broccoli. This is a wonderful, quick, weeknight meal!

I am a big fan of Italian sausage, and this had a lot of great flavor from the garlic and sausage, but we didn't care for the broccoli in this dish.  Will probably not make again.

This was a pretty yummy change of pace. I did modify it some. I cut up the sausage (mild italian) and cooked it in the pan adding some olive oil, minced garlic, chopped mushrooms and some grape tomatoes cut in half. Once it was all cooked I added frozen broccoli spears and auteed them also adding on the pepper flakes, which I reduced. I used cavatappi and added it to the pan and mixed it together also adding some of the pasta water to keep it from being dry. I also added more than 2 TBSP's of parmesan. Was very tasty and wasn't to greasy or dry. Will probably make again.

This was good! I fried linguica sausage meat cut in small pieces in olive oil. I also fried 2 cups of chopped chicken in the linguica fat.  This was followed by l large onion the same way. I used vegetable trio rotini noodles. Now I wish that I had doubled the batch! It did not last long.

This was a surprisingly big hit with even the pickiest eaters in our family. My only changes were to saute about about a quarter cup of onions with double the amount of garlic. I have been told to double the receipe next time so there will be leftovers for lunch. Thanks, will be putting this on the menu rotation. Update - don't mix parmesan in with pasta - sprinkle on top at end to keep melted cheese from sticking to the bottom of the pan. Looks prettier, too.

We all just thought this was fabulous!  I recommend using really good italian sausage from your butcher.  I browned the sausage with 2T Olive oil while cooking the noodles. When there was about 5 minutes left I added 2C of fresh chopped broccoli than I spooned out the crisp broccoli and added it with the garlic to the browned sausage, drained the pasta and stirred it all together and sprinkled with grated romano cheese.  Even my 2 and 4 year old sons ate this!  And the best is that it was quick and easy.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I upped the garlic to 5 cloves sliced (because we like to keep the vampires away, and we really love garlic) and put the grated parmesan cheese on at the table individually.  My husband told me to save the recipe.

Susan, thank you for submitting it.

I have made this a zillion times, love this recipe.   Only changes I made were to make it with farfalle since cavatelli is hard to find here and left out the crushed red pepper, not a fan of those.  This dish is in regular rotation at my house and always gets gobbled up, never any leftovers.    Thanks Susan!

I exchanged the sausage for chicken thigs and sauted it with red bell pepper.  I was also pretty liberal with the crushed red pepper.  It came out very good.  I will definitely make this again.

After reading the reviews, I had high expectations--but, the result was dry and not as flavorful.  It was quick and easy to make but the outcome was disappointing.

This was very good. Everyone who tried this enjoyed it. I forgot to add the red pepper flakes, but did add a bit more parmesan. A light but filling meal. I will be making this again. Thanks Susan.

I used loose sausage and cooked it in olive oil and garlic.  Drained it, then added fresh olive oil and fresh  broccoli which I blanched for a minute to infuse flavors in the frying pan along with the sausage and garlic.  Very good.  Will make again.

This was not a crowd pleaser although it was extremely easy.  The leftovers sat in the refrigerator.  I'll try other recipes, not this one again.

Great Recipe.  I added a tablespoon of red pepper flakes.  It made it much better.  Maybe too hot for some.  But 1/2 a teaspoon is just too little for so much pasta.

Oh, yum!  A very tasty dish that's a nice change from tomato sauced pasta.  Hubby, whose favorite thing in the whole world is spaghetti with tomato sauce, thought it was great.  A definite make again!

This was really good.  I also added a can of diced tomatoes partially drained for a little moisture and color.

My husband really liked this as he's not a fan of tomato sauce.  I added extra red pepper to mine as I felt it needed more flavor.  I also added fresh spinach to the boiling pasta along with the broccoli to sneak it in on my kids.

This sounded good but, I didn't really look at how much it made before making it.  It was good the first day, although a little too spicy.  I won't be making this again.

This was an excellent quick recipie if you're in a rush for dinner! A bit too spicy for my kids, but we adults LOVED IT! Next time, I will try a low fat version and compare the two. Something different for a weekday meal! A!
