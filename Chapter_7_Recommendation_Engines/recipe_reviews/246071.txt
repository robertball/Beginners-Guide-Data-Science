I couldn't find green tamarind pods, so i used dried.  I removed them after cooking, as they didn't seem edible.  I think the flavor was right, people may prefer to just use some tamarind paste.  I also probably used the wrong chile, I should have used the birdseye.  Also, no split black lentils available, I skipped them.  Overall, this was enjoyable.  I thought at first it was too tart/bitter, but adding some red pepper flakes to make up for using the wrong chile balanced it nicely.
