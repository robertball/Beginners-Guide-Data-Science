Really tasty.. and I didn't miss the meat. My change was using dried basil and dried oregano because its winter and they are $ right now.   I shredded the zucchini and let it side for a while for the water to drain out.. better on paper towels than in the food.  I think the key to this is to use a wonderful sauce and using the fresh mozzarella.  I am not a fan of fresh mozzarella usually, but it worked in this dish  perfectly.. will use it again for sure

Very good! Added mushrooms too and sliced some Roma tomatoes on top before adding the cheese. We all liked it including the teenagers! I did use 16 oz of ricotta instead of 1 cup.

I am looking for more ways to avoid wheat,.  This was wonderful.  I used salsa sauce instead of tomato sauce.
