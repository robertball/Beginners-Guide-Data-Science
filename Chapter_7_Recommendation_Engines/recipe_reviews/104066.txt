I made this for turkey day and used all fat free crm cheese and sprinkled sour crm topping with cinammon and it was great. Today (xmas) I am making same except using apple filling for the pumpkin.

I get requests for this cheesecake every year! I cut down on the cinnamon in the crust because it can be a little spicy and i use about a teaspoon and a half of a pumpkin pie spice blend instead of adding all the different spices individually. I don't care for the topping but I tried pralined pecans on it this Thanksgiving and it was out of this world! This is definitely a hit!

If I had not personally made this, I would have never believed that it is so low in fat and sugar free.  Absolutely delish!  I made it exactly as the recipe dictated.  Definite do again!

I was introduced to this recipe by my sister who made it for Thanksgiving dinner. Since then, I've made it twice & both times it was a big hit! This recipe makes a big, rich cheesecake & if I didn't tell folks it's lower fat & made w/ Splenda, they'd never know by the rich, creamy taste. Some folks weren't thrilled w/ the topping so I'll try praline pecans instead.  This recipe is a GREAT alternative for families w/ diabetes!

I recently made this recipe without the graham cracker crust (additional carb savings) and it was a huge hit with my office for a birthday celebration. It makes a huge cheesecake which is firm, delicious and amazingly lite for a cheesecake.  The sour cream on the top added an extra delicious zing.  This would make a great autumn or Thanksgiving treat. The reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the outer rim of the cheesecake after unmolding was slightly hard after cooling and not as creamy as the center of the cake. The crust may have taken care of that problem but you would need to put the crust up the entire side of the springform pan.  Still a keeper!!
