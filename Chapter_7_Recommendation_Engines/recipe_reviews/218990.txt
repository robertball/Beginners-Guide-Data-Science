I don't have a pressure cooker, so I just cooked it all in a large saucepan.  The amount of celery looked excessive to me, so I cut it to 2 stalks, very finely sliced, and it worked out very well.  When it was cooked I took out a couple of cups of the soup and whizzed it in my blender (an old trick of mine), then returned it to the rest of the soup, and this thickened it nicely.

This is exactly the recipe my dad used to make on cold grey days! My daughter and I have enriched the taste by adding 2-4 chicken bouillion cubes to the water at the beginning......The evaporated milk is the key to this recipe, please edon't substitute with regular milk or cream, it just isn't the same.

I used 7 large potatoes cubed, 1T garlic, 3 stalks of celery, 1/2 cup chopped red onion & 4 cups chicken broth. Pressure cooked for 25 minutes. Once cooked, I added in a 12oz can evaporated milk, 6T of butter, 1/2 cup sharp cheddar cheese, 1/4 cup chopped green onion, salt & pepper & 1/2 cup real bacon chopped! Will be making again. Next time I will double the recipe.

It was very good.  I added the cheese and bacon and we ate it as a meal.  Even my teenager liked it.

I tripled this recipe and made it in the crockpot only because I am terrified to use my husband's pressure cooker. Instead of water, I used chicken broth. I did add a few more spices (onion powder, garlic powder, dill weed, chives, red pepper flake, celery salt) but other than that I stuck to the recipe. I did not need the additional mashed potato flakes, my soup was the perfect consistancy. Right before serving, I sprinkled each serving with a little shredded sharp cheddar and crumbled bacon. Thumbs up from the whole family. VERY cheap meal idea for a mom on a budget.

This is a great soup recipe! I did add potato flakes but it didn't seem to thicken it up. That didn't matter. I didn't have celery so I substituted a little celery seed for flavor. Delicious! I used instant pot on manual and cooked for 15 minutes.  Added cheese, bacon and chives once in bowls. This is a keeper! I'd say 1 hour from start to finish!

I really enjoyed this potato soup and is perfect for a beginner on a pressure cooker! Be sure to have bacon (I used real bacon bits) and cheese.  My husband loved it as we'll.

A good recipe, but gave it a 4 due to a couple alterations I made. I omitted the potato flakes. After the pressure cooking, I pulled out about a cup of the diced potatoes and sat aside. Then used an immersion blender to thicken and make the soup creamier.  Added some shredded cheddar and blended, then added the potato pieces back. Topped with crispy bacon pieces. Very good.

The whole family loved it!  I added cheese and bacon on top.  It was the first time I have made potato soup for them, and they were a little leary....but it was a big hit!

I made just as recipe stated but added 2 cups sharp cheddar cheese and chopped crispy bacon. I found I needed to use more potato flakes to thicken to my desired consistency but it was delicious. My in laws loved it and the pot was gone in one sitting. I wish I had doubled the batch!

I used chicken broth and just a little water.  Boiled all ingredients on the stove top until the potatoes were tender and then finished out the recipe according to directions.  Very easy and delicious.

This is a delicious soup! Although I did make a few minor alterations, they did not change the basic good taste. First, I simmered it stovetop because I do not have a pressure cooker (and would probably be afraid to use it, anyway). I used fewer celery stalks (and peeled them first to get rid of the outer strings), I added a couple of finely chopped carrots, and used less onion, not being a big onion fan. What makes this type of potato soup so crazy good is the addition  of evaporated milk. I have made many potato soups with cream and they are good also,  but nothing can compare to that wonderful flavor evaporated milk brings! When serving I sprinkled with shredded cheddar cheese, crumbled bacon, and a little chopped green onions. Superb!

The reason I got a pressure cooker (about a month ago) was to make soups that I could take for lunch to work.  This is the third type of soup that I've made in the pressure cooker and it turned out wonderfully!  I used homemade chicken stock (also from the pressure cooker!) instead of water and coconut cream instead of evaporated milk (because that's what I had in my pantry).  I also added some chunks of Italian sausage because I had some in the fridge. Turned out delicious and I'm enjoying it at work this last week before Christmas vacation!  This is a really flexible recipe.

I added chopped 2 cups chopped carrots, 1 package  of  diced ham and chicken broth instead of water , didn't  add the instant potatoes but does need to be just a little thicker, i might try a small dumpling next time. The cheese was a good  addition also.
