very delicious though I am glad we ended up not having light corn syrup on hand as the dish was sweet and a bit sauce heavy as it was. used zucchini and sugar snap peas instead of mushrooms and snow peas. will definitely have again!!

My DH made this for dinner the other night and it was really good - but even better the next day. We cut the recipe in half but used all the garlic more fresh ginger than called for (probably 1 tsp or so) and only 1/4 cup of corn syrup (glad we did or it would have been waaaay too sweet). The end result was tasty and healthy; we probably will turn to this recipe in future if we're looking for a chicken stir fry.

Good. I found a similar recipe that calls for only 1/4 cup of corn syrup (or golden syrup) which seemed a much less scary quantity! It also uses water chestnuts instead of mushrooms.

My husband and I love this recipe. It is a regular meal in our house. I spice it up a little bit by adding a few shakes of red pepper flakes and I use a spicy plum sauce. I just use whatever veggies I have on hand. Thanks for the simple and tasty recipe!

The only changes I made were to use brown sugar instead of corn syrup and I ended up having to add some water to thin out the sauce as it was too sticky and glutinous. I made this with a mushroom medley pack which included oyster chestnut crimini and white button mushrooms. It could do with a little kick of something spicy but otherwise this was decent. Thank you!

This is a great recipe! I have made many different stir fry sauces and this one is fabulous and easy to prepare! I made it with pork and put ginger in with the rice. My husband says its one of his favorites! Very very good.

A very good taste. I would add some more veggies with this one. I also made coconut rice which was a wonderful addition to this.

This had great flavours. The ginger and and plum sauce really work well together. All I did different was I added carrots and water chestnuts. I think next time I will try using flour instead of corn starch on the chicken it made it a bit thicker/sticky while cooking. I also added fresh garlic and green onions while cooking the chicken.

I love the flavor of this but made some adjustments: NO corn syrup no chicken bouillon no corn starch. I made this plum sauce: Spicy-Plum-Sauce and sweetened it with about 1/4 teaspoon of stevia. It is PLENTY sweet without the corn syrup and much healthier. My husband loves this on his HCG diet (minus the rice and oil).

This is a great concept to combine the flavor of ginger with the body of the plum sauce in a simple dish. I made this with zuchini and lots of onions; the result was a dish I will put on my regular menu.

delicious! I was looking for a recipe to use up the 1/2 jar of plum sauce in the fridge and this was it. Halved the recipie and was enough for our family of 4 plus a lunch for my husband to take to work the next day. Thank you for sharing.

I enjoyed this recipe. I did modify the recipe as using the corn syrup would definitely make it too sweet. I omitted the corn syrup and threw in (in addition to the mushrooms and snow peas) some chopped carrots and a red bell pepper. The flavor is nice but it doesn't blow my mind. I had a lot of sauce left over.

I really enjoy Asian cooking and thought I would give this one a try. I bought all of the ingredients which weren't inexpensive. I also consider myself a good cook. I did not care for this at all! It was sooo sweet. If you are looking for something that tastes like in the restaurant skip this one. I would omit all of the corn syrup. I may try it again without the sweetener!

It just tasted like sweet and sour chicken. I didn't taste the plum or the ginger.

I should have listened to the other reviewers who said it was too sweet! OMG. I could barely get it down. The first few bites were really good and then it went down from there. I added a touch more soy and siracha but that didn't help. I think the plum sauce is really sweet on its own. I've just never heard of using corn syrup in chinese so I had to try it. I didn't even add the full half cup. Honestly I don't see how 3/4 tsp of ginger could be too much as some said but then again people complain about a recipe being bland when it's got nothing but one ingredient by itself to add flavor?!?!!!! I added red bell bean sprouts onion and omitted mushrooms because I didn't have any...

We didn't put any chicken (or cornstarch) in because we only had bone-in chicken and we wanted something fast. We added more ginger (mixed into the sauce not cooked with the veggies) cooked the garlic with the vegetables decreased the corn syrup to 1/3 cup and added water chestnuts for crunch. A nice stir-fry sauce excellent over jasmine rice. This dish was fabulous meatless but we will definitely try it with chicken in the future.

It was too gingery for me and I cut the ginger a bit too. Not a bad meal but we didn't love it. We prefer Oyster Sauce Chicken which is similar.

Added shredded carrots shallots and onions. Did not add corn syrup or bouillon. Definitely would have been too sweet with the corn syrup. Added some Sri Racha sauce to the plum sauce. Added salt pepper red pepper flakes and garlic powder to the flour I used (rather than corn starch) to the chicken coating.

This I the best recipe that I have ever made as a stir fry. Instead of snow peas I used broccoli red peppers and red onions and cut the corn syrup in half. I also made my own plum sauce. Equally as good with pork

Easy and good! Only used 3 T cornstarch no oil or corn syrup subbed sugar snap peas for snow peas and used 5 stalks celery and three small bell peppers instead of mushrooms as that's what I had on hand and needed to use up. There was plenty of sauce for all of it and it was plenty sweet without the corn syrup.
