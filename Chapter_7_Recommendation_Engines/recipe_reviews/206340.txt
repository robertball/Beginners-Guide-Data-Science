Fantabulous! I halved the recipe because I just wasn't sure how it would go over & I'm wishing I would've made the whole thing-it was GREAT! My 4 yr old had 3 helpings! I didn't use the optional caraway seeds. We'll definitely be having this on a regular basis!!

Delicious! The simple white sauce is so much tastier than using a cream of mushroom soup or something similar. I did add a bit more saurkraut as I wanted to use up the jar. Will definitely make this again!!

Fantastic!!! It is definitely "super savory". Very rich, creamy, cheesy... utterly delicious, and easy, too. My family gave it rave reviews. Thanks for the recipe, Dar! :-)

Yum.  Everything fit into a 7 x 11 pan and cooked it a tad longer.  I put parsley on top, mainly for color.  Next time, perhaps I will put bell pepper inside or something green .... the color is pale.  I used red onions. I used 1 1/2 C. Sauerkraut and it could use more.  Thank you for the recipe!!

This was FANTASTIC!  My husband is Lithuanian, and LOVES sauerkraut, so I'm always on the lookout for recipes that include it.  This was just incredibly good.  I made it exactly as written, but when I make it for my Lithuanian MIL, I'll probably omit the cheese , and add some crumbled bacon, using the bacon grease in place of the butter.   Thank you so much for this recipe - it's going in the permanent file!

We love sauerkraut and have 11 quarts of it that my husband made from our garden this past year...now I have another fabulous recipe to use. I used the basic recipe exactly as written and added a 1/2 cup diced red and green peppers to add some color to it. Also used a little extra cheese to cover the top....very good! Will definetly make again....

Almost any recipe with saurkraut gets 5 stars from me!  This was really good! I put it on top of some ground pork & while the color of the dish is very bland - I really like it!  Definitely DO NOT skimp on the potatoes!  I didn't have enough (which I found out about right when I was combining everything) and it turned out a bit runny.

I was so skeptical of this dish because I am NOT a saurkraut fan. The only thing I did differently was add more cheddar cheese than it called for. This came out  bubbly, cheesy, and SO DELICIOUS!! I loved the very edges of the casserole that browned nicely in the pan. I find any excuse to make this!

I didn't get to taste this because my husband and his friend downed the whole pan.  No leftovers. I am going to consider that a success.

This turned out delicious! The only thing I changed was that I used an extra-sharp cheddar cheese (just by preference, definitely not required). We looked forward to the leftovers of this side dish more than the main meal XD. Will definitely be making this again and hope to have an opportunity to bring this to a potluck to show off.

It seems odd that we didn't like this given the ingredients. The only changes were to shred four potatoes instead the pre-packaged hashabrowns (I only seen the shredded variety around here a handful of times anyway) and one chicken bouillon cube for the loose kind. I forgot the butter, but didn't miss it. We thought this was too salty, and the caraway gave it a weird taste (according to my fiance). This could easily be tweaked to skip the salt, reduce the caraway and add some onion and garlic.

I liked this, but I wish I would have rinsed the kraut just a bit as the sourness really came thru the next day.  I did add the whole can of kraut cuz I didn't have any plans for it otherwise, so that could have been part of it too.

I thought this was so good. Sauce is easy to make, I prefer this to a canned soup. They make sauerkraut in a 8 oz. can so that was perfect. The only thing I did differently was to saute the onions to ensure that they came out tender. This was even better reheated the next day.

Excellent side dish.  I did not have caraway seeds.  Not needed.  I also used fresh potato and that works just fine.  My husband is off -the-boat Polish and says it is very similar in flavor to the pierogi i filling they use.   Made it twice already and plan to make it again!

I made it as the recipe called for and I thought it was fabulous. Had some friends over and made it with baked pork chops and everyone loved it. I always make the recipe as called the first time then I make changes to suit my taste but I won't change a thing. It's great just the way it is.

Danke fuer diesen leckeren Rezept!  Wonderful and easy.  We had this with smoked pork chops.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and added a couple of strips of bacon and grease, but I don't think I could taste it over the kraut, so I wouldn't add them next time.  The only thing I would change from the recipe as written is maybe a little less water in the white sauce - It turned out a little wetter than I would like.

My guy thought this was the bomb!  I halved the recipe we still had enough for two dinners and he is asking when I will make it again.  Now that is a WINNER!

Really like this recipe. I used shredded fresh potatoes instead of frozen, but otherwise followed exactly.  Have made it several times now.  By the way, I used the cheese sauce, minus sauerkraurt, to make a cauliflower au gratin that was also delicious. Really like that sauce.

Creamy, tangy, cheesy. I was looking for a recipe that had sauerkraut and hash browns together, like I had at a Dutch friends house as a young adult. I made it with caraway seeds, which I love, but I wouldn't next time, as it dominated the dish. Not something for kids as it is too sour for their sensitive palate.
