Outstanding!!And, can be prepared ahead of time. I made this five hours in advance and refrigerated it till I was ready to serve it. The whipped cream added extra body. I served it with fresh strawberries and blue berries in a wine glass. Everyone loved it. It serves 4 to 5 healthy portions.

If you are looking for something that tastes like the berries and zabione at the Olive Garden- this is it. I followed the recipe exactly and had to stop myself from just eating it all with a giant spoon. I served it over a scoop of blackberry sorbet and fresh berries. Soooo good.

Love.this.recipe - traditional Italian zabaglione is served warm but I have never liked the warm version - this version is delicious and very easy - I think the yolk/sugar/marsala mixture thickened in about 5 min using a hand whisk - I'll be more inclined to make this for company now as it takes so little time.

wow. this is a-maze-ing!  i had a recipe for this and it had soooooo many more ingrediants ... this was only 4 and it turned out sooooo great!!  i presented mine in a red wine glass .... piped some of the cream into the bottom (didn't want it to look sloppy) then put in some strawberries and black berries ... spooned some more cream on top of the berries and added red raspberries for color and  two cuts of starfruit for presentation purposes.  all i can say is that everyone wanted the recipe and couldnt believe how easy it was to make something THAT delicious!

I loved this dessert! The recipe is quite simple and easy, the perfect make-ahead dessert for something that is at once indulgent and light enough to enjoy even in summer. When using Marsala, go with a white, which will be more visually appealing.

The wine flavor didn't come through strongly enough for us. Would like to try using more, but don't want to throw off the texture/consistency, which really was just perfect. Will try to find similar recipes to see whether different proportions (just slightly) might work. If not, might seek out a better (possibly slightly stronger?) marsala wine. Really beautiful consistency though...

Really easy and turned out great. I added some powdered sugar and more Marsala wine to the whipped cream as I was whipping it.

Excellent!  I cut the recipe in half and used four ramekins to make this, topping it with berries.  I was amused by the reviews, as one said the wine was too strong and one said there wasn't enough wine.  I thought the wine taste was noticeable but not overwhelming.  Very good.

I have made this recipe many times. It is easy to make but you do have to watch it  does not over cook! I add a little grated lemon zest. I also use 10 eggs and more sugar and cream to get six servings. I layer it in a martini glass with berries and top with grated chocolate or a cookie.

Really delicious! My husband and I loved it. The kids...not so much. They tasted the wine too much. I may try to cut the Marsala next time and add Mexican Vanilla to see if that makes the recipe a little more kid-friendly. Again, for an adults-only dessert, this recipe is fabulous. For a family-friendly dessert...not so much.
