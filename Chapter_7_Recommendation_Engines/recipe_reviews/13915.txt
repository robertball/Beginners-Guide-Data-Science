YUMMY! and aesthetically pleasing. I did a few things different: I shredded rather than sliced my carrots (2 cups shredded carrots).. did not have broccoli so I doubled the sweet peas... used chicken broth rather than red wine and used 2 eggs rather than one.  In addition I seasoned the sauted vegetables with lemon pepper, garlic pepper, adobo, oregano and basil (we love our food well seasoned)and used 4 cloves of fresh garlic rather than one.  Only 12 rolls could fit in the 9*13 dish.
Everyone raved (including the chef!)

This recipe surprised me.  I didn't think my hubby would like it, but he LOVED it.  It was much tastier than I thought it would be.  I did waste alot of lasagne noodles, however.  My veggie filling only stuffed 9 noodles, and they weren't overstuffed or anything.  So don't waste noodles by cooking the whole box.  You can only fit 12 in the dish anyway.

I enjoyed eating these rolls, but I thought they were a little tricky to make.  (I am not an experienced chef, so take that with a grain of salt.)  I thought the lasagna was a bit difficult to roll, or rather, to fold.  Maybe manicotti would have been easier.  Also, 16 oz. ended up being way too much for the amount of filling I had.  Eight ounces would have been plenty.  But, nonetheless, a very tasty dinner.

I made this dish for friends who don't eat meat on Fridays during Lent. Man, it was great. The vegetables I used were carrots (came cut into skinny pieces in a bag), frozen peas, a red pepper, and broccoli. I added two extra garlic cloves and some dried basil, oregano, and pepper because of earlier reviews. I also bought large shells instead of the lasagna noodles, which turned out to be easy to stuff. As soon as my friends came in the door, they commented on the wonderful smell. The compliments kept coming all night. One friend (who likes mushrooms) said he might add mushrooms next time to make the taste of the other vegetables milder. I, on the other hand, thought the meal was perfect. My husband commented that the meal was not heavy like some pasta dishes can be. I plan to use it many more times to come.

Excellent!!  One note -- if you don't like the texture of peas, skip them.  I thought that they would blend in with the other veggies, but they tend to burst in your mouth when you chew them.  Everything else was wonderful.

Takes a bit of preparation but turns out pretty good.  You definitely won't use the entire box of pasta - half is sufficient.  The second time I made it, I was too lazy to make rolls so I just baked it lasagna style - layer of sauce, pasta, veggie mixture, cheese, sauce, veggies... etc.  Can't really go wrong here.

After reading through the reviews, I made quite a few changes to this recipe, mainly to do with the amounts of ingredients used.  I used more mushrooms, garlic, egg and spaghetti sauce, and less oil and noodles.  While cooking this my bf came out to ask what it was and if it had meat in it (both of us are meat lovers but I thought a change would be nice).  When I said no he was like umm, okay then, thinking it wouldn't be great.  But after eating this, he came and told me this is the best thing I've made for him!!  He loved it and I loved it too, I highly recommend this recipe.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars, I would.  A couple hints: boil only 12 lasagna noodles so you won't have extras left over; make sure the broccoli and carrots are well cooked if you're fixing for kids; use more sauce than called for, especially if you're planning left overs.  These are definitely company fare...tasty and satisfying!

For dietary reasons, I chopped up some zucchini instead of using the carrots. My dad and brother absolutely loved it.

Very tasty ingredient wise, and lends itself to all kinds of modifications to suit individual tastes...but I ask WHY mess around with rolling up lasagna noodles??  Rather stuff rigatoni, manicotti or large shells.

These were ok. The broccoli didn't go over. Hard to roll with pieces of broccoli in them. Spinach would be a better choice. Not really enough sauce to cover sufficiently. I would just layer next time.

Used wheat ;asagna noodles, they all fell apart.  Use regular lasagna noodles!!  Used matchstick carrots, onion, zucchini.  Took long time to make, but yum.  Skip the broth (wine) step, it's not needed.  Just saute veggies and add to egg mix.  Too timely for a weeknight.

I absolutely love this recipe. I am a vegetarian, and this is the best lasagna-type recipe ever! I usually just layer the vegetables and sauce and noodles instead of trying to roll them, and it turns out amazing! (by the way, this can definitely be way more than 5 servings!!!)

This was fabulous!! My skeptic meat-loving roommates were pleasantly suprised. (One even begged me to share the recipe with his veggie girlfriend)

I dont care much for peas, so i went heavy on the mushrooms and other vegetables. After reading what the other reviews say about running out of the filling and winding up with extra pasta - i concur. Make extra filling because you will not be able to use all of the noodles.
This was a big hit and i will definately make it again.

Great vegetarian recipe. I increased the veggies all by about 1/2 cup and chopped them fine (shredded the carrots) to aid in rolling. I used an entire 16oz block of mozzarella saving about 1/2cup for the top. I think I probably used more than 1/3 cup per noodle but they rolled easily. I will add more spices next time. As other reviewer recommened I may try stuffing large shells next time.

Excellent twist on a classic dish. Next time I will use zucchini instead of broccoli. I also used whole wheat noodles in an attempt at making it more healthy which worked well. I ended up way too much veggie mixture for the allotted space in the pan, so I used the noodles that broke to make second smaller casserole with sauce, noddles, veggie mixture, more noodles and sauce on top. It was nice because now I have dinner for another night this week already prepared. Was really good with Italian bread and I will add a side salad next time too. The only down side was rolling the mixture into the noodles and transferring it to the pan - messy! Tasted great though. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good recipe but not the best one I've had. First of all as all the other reviewers said the 9 noodles were sufficient for the amount of mixture, so save yourself from making too much or you will have to put the extra in the refrigerator. Secondly, there was no call for salt - I would add 1 tsp of salt to the mixture or enjoy the ready meal with some finely chopped capers. What I had the biggest trouble with was the amount of sauce poured on it. People were saying there was not enough. I thought it was TOO MUCH. Just put 4-5 tbsp of sauce maybe a couple more spoons if you're sauce crazy and add some water. I'll avoid the sauce at the bottom and top thing which I never do, but I wanted to follow this recipe right. Also I found the carrot and the peas made it too sweet for my taste, but maybe you like your food sweet. I used a can of peas and chopped fresh carrot. Anyway it worked out - it's still tasty. Next time I'll increase the mushrooms ( I could barely taste), add more garlic, some salt to taste and maybe some oregano for flavor. Thanks for reading

Very good and very easy.  I 100% agree with all the other review that say you only need 1/2 a box of lasagna as that was absolutely perfect for me.  I had no issues with the rolling.  I stretched the noodles out on foil and that held them in place while I filled them and after that rolling was a breeze.

Awesome. Used large shells because they're easier to stuff. Was generous with my broccoli and mushrooms (mini portobellas) and added a cup of chopped baby spinach. Seasoned the veg with 5 cloves of garlic, basil, oregano, cayenne pepper and also used 2 eggs instead of 1.

Very good!  Added, some red & yellow peppers - shredded the carrot and diced the remainder of the veggies.  Was hesitant to add the peas - but glad I did.  Used large shells in place of the lasagna noodles.  Even the non-veggie guests ate this up - no left overs.  Will be making again.

Wow! This was an absolutely wonderful dish! I served this for my husband and I, and we both loved it. It is very tasty and unique. The only difference is that I used 8 lasagna noodles, and halved some of the ingredients. Great, Great recipe!

WOW!  Sooo exceeded my expectations.  Followed other reviewers' suggestions and used 1/2 box stuffed shells and it was very easy.  As a personal preference, did zucchini instead of mushrooms, red pepper instead of green peas and spinach instead of broccolli with 2 eggs.  Can't wait to make again - thanks for a great recipe!

Yum-O!  I served this for dinner for my vegetarian sister and several other guest that were not vegetarians.  Everyone loved it and my sister asked for the recipe.  I added basil, oregano, pepper, and 2 extra cloves of garlic to the sautéed vegetables and also used two eggs. I'll definitely make this recipe again!

So tasty and flavorful!  We did make a few modifications though because we're picky and didn't want to have to go to the grocery store;  no mushrooms, peas, or onion.  Shredded the carrots.  Added 4 oz ricotta cheese, extra garlic, and adobo seasoning to sauteed veggies, substituted veggie broth for wine.  And we only made 8 rolls... which was PLENTY to fill entire dish, and serve 2 of us for 2 meals.  Will definitely try again!

The filling is very good! Next time I'll try it as a filling for stuffed shells.

I used pasta tubes instead of lasagne noodles.  I also added some dried basil and oregano to the veggies while cooking.  This is delicious and filling.

Instead of making the veggie rolls, I made a lasagne, which was faster.  I added the veggie mixture, extra sauce, and mozzarella between each layer.  Delicious!  Thanks for the inspiration!

When I first read the combination of ingredients I thought "no way".  But there were so many highly positive reviews I simply had to try the recipe.  I shredded the carrots and used manicotti instead of lasagne noodles--much quicker.  Stuffed 8 manicotti and used the remaining filling in an omelet the following morning.  Did falter and use a spaghetti sauce with Italian sausage in it.  Somehow these ingredients create an absolutely AWESOME dish.  Will make again and again!

Made this recipe last night...it was great!  Shredded the carrotts, added some chopped red pepper, one extra egg and some extra cheese.  Served with marinara sauce.  This is a definite keeper!

My family just loved this, I will make again very soon.
I made a few small changes to it.
instead of chopped mushrooms I used crutons and omitted the onion in favor of green pepper. I added potato chunks instead of Broccoli and subsituted tomatoes and red peppers instead of peas and carrots. 
I also added 2 Lbs of ground beef and 1 Lb of ground pork.
I baked at 425 for 40 minutes and then added 1 cup of cottage cheese and let bake for another 10 minutes.
we loved it!

Delicious!  Substituted fine chopped mushrooms for the peas. Used matchstick carrots. Reduced the amount of wine.  Used large shells and stuffed them (instead of rolling lasagna noodles).  Sprinkled extra mozzarella over the top.

These are the best! I suggest if you are using jarred sauce make sure it's a good one. Our meat eating cousin was over the night I made these and he went home and raved to his wife how great they were! The only deveation I made was to add one jar of Prego to my homemade sauce so I would have enough. Which I actually had too much. But with a salad  you have a great meal!

I have made this recipe several times now, and it is ALWAYS a big hit. It's amazing how much flavor these rolls have. I have been asked for this recipe several times. This has become my "back-up" recipe whenever I want to make something I KNOW everyone will like.

These were very good. My boyfriend said that they were better than regular lasagna and he eats meat. I didn't use the carrots or peas, and subsituted spinach and red bell pepper. I also made my own tomatoe sauce. Thanks for the recipe.

These were really awesome, but next time I'm going to leave out the carrots.  I just don't think they went well with the other ingredients.  I also plan to add both red and green peppers next time to give it a little extra flavor.

To make prep. time easier I used the mannacotti pasta tubes and inserted the veggie mix using a cake decorating tube. I also used one of those pampered chef choppers (this alone saved me about 20 minutes). My husband is a VERY picky vegetarian and he loved it!

This is an excellent dinner! Instead of 
carrots and peas, I used a package of 
frozen spinach.  I also used a 16 oz. 
package of mushrooms instead of just a 
cup. To reduce fat, I reduced the olive
oil to 1 tbsp, and used egg substitute,
low-fat mozzarella and parmesan cheese, 
and low-fat spaghetti sauce.  Add Molly
McButter to pasta cooking water to add 
buttery flavor.  Excellent recipe, and 
great as leftovers too!

I made this just as the recipe stated. For me the vegetables didn’t work well together. I gave 2 stars bc it didn’t taste great but I was able to eat it. I found this very easy to make. I had no issues rolling the lasagna noodles. I made my own sauce and used all fresh vegetables. I felt there was something missing from the filling. Almost like it could have used a ricotta cheese or something bc the mozzarella wasn’t enough and it lacked moisture. Thankfully I used extra sauce or this would have turned out very dry. Unfortunately I would not recommend this dish.

So good! A bit time-consuming but worth it. Subbed some spinach for the peas and added 1/2 lb. browned pork sausage. Probably used 1/2 to 3/4 of the box of noodles. Following other reviewers' suggestions of chopping veggies small (1/4" dice) and laying out noodles on aluminum foil helped with rolling. Used a spicy sauce which gave it a nice kick. Definitely a new favorite in our house!!

This was very tasty. I did leave out most of the mozzarella cheese in an effort to be lower in fat, which made rolling these impossible (the filling just wouldn't stay together inside the noodle. So, I compromised and made a layered-style lasagna instead. Still delicious, even to my meat-lover husband!

This recipe was very time consuming and we found the result to be less tastey than plain old vegetable lasagne.

I'm SOO glad I got a food processor before making this recipe. Really cut down on slicing, chopping and shredding! However, even with the processor, this recipe is a little bit of work. However, it's very good, and I made a large batch and served it to about 15 people -- who loved it!

This is WONDERFUL! I only wish it didn't take quite as long to prepare.

We used this recipe for our community kitchen, so we made enough for 2 rolls each for 12 people.  I thought it was a bit difficult to roll them, but the finished product was excellent!  Very tasty.

These were so good!  My family invented the phrase, " where's the beef?", and they really enjoyed this.
