I thought this was a great simple quick bread recipe.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and used 1 cup of milk and 1 1/2 cups of cheese.  I also added a package of italian dressing mix and decreased the salt to about 1/4 teaspoon.  I thought it was great.  My bread didn't crumble like other reviews had trouble with.  The crust was crisp, but the bread was soft and fluffy.  I will keep this recipe on hand the next time I was some fresh bread in a hurry.

I made this bread to go with some potato soup, and it was the perfect accompanyment.  I took the advise of some other reviewers and increased the amount of cheese to 1 1/2 cups and the milk to 1 cup.  I also sprinkled some garlic powder and a touch of cayenne into the batter. 1/4 cup of sugar seemed like a lot for a savory bread so I cut it to 2 tablespoons. Next time I'll cut it to 1 since it was still a little too sweet.  After baking for 20 minutes, I sprinkled about another 1/2 cup of cheese on the top of the loaf, then continued baking.  We all enjoyed this very much with our soup.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this recipe twice using a parmesan-mozzarella mix instead of Cheddar, and it turned out great! Then, I decided to try a carrot variety by replacing the cheese with 1 cup finely grated carrot, doubling the amount of salt and adding 1 teaspoon spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, whatever you like) and it was AWESOME! A big hit with my family and friends!

This was ok.  I used 1 cup of milk so the bread would be less crumbly.  I suggest using sharp shredded cheddar because the mild cheddar wasn't strong enough to add flavor to the bread.

This is "good." My daughter in particular liked this bread but it was a little too dense for my tastes.  Per other recommendations, I used 1c milk, 1 1/4c sharp cheddar cheese, added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and added some Italian seasonings (apprx 1 tsp). I also added 1/4c parmesan cheese. It took a little longer to bake - the top started to brown b4 the middle was done so after 30 min, I reduced the oven temp to 375 and baked for an additional 10 minutes. The bread had a great crust while the middle was nice and soft. Although it was good, like I said, just a little too dense for me. If you like cornbread type breads, you'd probally enjoy this recipe. My daughter and boyfriend sure did!

This bread was a hit with both me and my husband. I've had requests to make some and send it to work for his co-workers. A little on the sweet side...you might decrease the amount of sugar by one or two tablespoons.

I gave it 5 stars all around.  It is a good recipe for what it is, a quick bread.  Next time I might double the recipe or use a smaller loaf pan.  The bread was kind of short.  Still, very good and very fast.  Thanks Inari!

Perfect as is. I have a problem with people changing all the ingredients and measurements. Please just rate the recipe as is or make up your own.

Was easy to assemble but overall, not a stand out recipe.  Try adding a little garlic or onion powder to give the bread a less baking soda/powdery taste.

This is really good bread.  Cut down the sugar to 1/8 cup and used half cheddar and half Monterey Jack.  The consistency is similar to cornbread.

This is a great recipe!! Unfortunately I used a loaf pan that should've been donated to the Smithsonian Institute's Antiquities Department a long time ago. And I shouldn't be allowed to bake. The middle came out of the pan separately from the crust so I didn't have any slicing problems:o) Nevertheless, we ate the entire thing straight out of the oven & I'll be getting new bakeware tomorrow! I just love these win-win situations. Thanks:o)

This couldn't be easier! My husband loved it with our veggie chili. I used 1 1/2c shredded cheese blend, added two diced serrano chile's and a whole bunch of minced fresh garlic. I followed others advice and used one cup of milk and less sugar. Great fast batter style bread. I usually "do" yeast breads. I just wanted something faster for dinner. This recipe is very forgiving and you could do just about anything to it. Thinking smoked cheese with sun dried tomato would totally rock! It also stayed nice and moist for the next two days. You should really try this. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I thought it was horrible.  It wasn't very cheesy, it wasn't very flavorful, and it half of it got thrown away in my apartment...the only thing I can give to it was that it was easy to make.

I made this recipe twice this week and both times I modified the recipe.  Just like everyone else, I used 1 cup milk and 1 1/2 cup of aged cheddar cheese.  I also reduced the sugar amount by half, and i added a teaspoon of garlic powder.  The first time I made it, it wasn't the best.  In fact, I hardly liked it at all.  The crust was great but the inside was dense and way too moist.  It wasn't fluffy like bread is supposed to be.  The second time, I sifted my dry ingredients.  It turned out great! The inside was not too moist but not dry, the texture was wonderful.

This is a great starter recipe...I always pretty much follow recipes as stated when I first make them.... this took minutes to prepare...very easy had all ingredients... the only thing I did different really was use whole wheat flour instead of the all purpose flour.... and I added a little more cheese.. next time I will add garlic and even more cheese... I just made it to go with ham and potatoe soup also from this site... I had a piece with just a tad of butter on it... simply delicious right from the oven... u really should try this recipe.. this one is certainly a keeper for me .. to go with all my homemade soups etc.... and recipe has so many possibilites.... thanx for sharing this recipe......

Added a bit of pesto and more cheese to the mixture and served it with a pasta dinner. It was pretty good. Will make again. :)

This bread is deeeelicious!  Since the person who submitted the recipe mentioned that it was a bit crumbly, I added extra olive oil.  Just played it by ear but it may have been about 1/2 cup.  It went great with chili, and stay moist and edible for a few days.

Do not add sugar. Also, as suggested, I added garlic, 2 cloves, black pepper, and 1.5 cups cheese. I'm not sure if I would not make this again as it wasn't "delicious"; it was bordderline good/ OK. Maybe the sugar messed up the flavor.

This bread is awesome! I used cake flour instead of regular, that way I didnt use the baking powder or salt, 2 tbsp of sugar, 3/4 cup of mozarella and a 1/4 cup of parmesan and 1 cup of milk. I also threw in a 1/4 cup of Italian Shake N Bake to add flavor. 5 minutes before the bread was done I threw on another 1/2 cup of mozarella, and WOW! The bread was not crumbly at all and was so moist, I will definitely be making again!

FANTASTIC.  I too followed the recommendations of 1 cup milk and 1/5 cups cheese.  I used coconut oil instead of canola, and added several shakes of mrs.dash.  This is cheesy, savory, crunchy and soft all at once.  I KNOW this will be a family favorite for years to come.

A good soda bread; I used 2/3 cup Gorgonzola and 1/3 cup cream cheese, cubed, instead of cheddar and it was nice; reduce the salt if doing this, though. I also used the spiced olive oil that cubes of feta are canned in instead of vegetable oil. Yum!

This was a good quick bread.  I took the advice of thequalitycookdotcom and used 1 cup of milk and extra cheese.  I also added some garlic powder.  This went very well with the Chicken Corn Chowder I made.  Thanks!

Great tasting bread! My family loved it.  I followed the other users sugesstions and used 1 cup milk, 1/2 tsp salt, added 1/2 tsp garlic powder and only 1 Tbsp sugar.  The texture was not crumbly and it was not sweet.

I left out the sugar completely.  I liked it that way and probably would not have liked it with the sugar.  This was a really tasty and moist bread.  I'll make it again.

I had to make this bread with all the mixed reviews.I used 1 c of milk and garlic powder as suggested by other reviews.This bread is crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.It is a bit on the sweet side.I would make this again except I would omit the sugar and add more cheese and spices.Great bread to play around with different ingredients.

Oh. My. Goodness. This is delicious! I followed other people's advice because I didn't want a failure out of this: I used 6 oz. finely shredded extra sharp white cheddar cheese and 1 cup of milk ( instead of just 1 cup cheese and 3/4 cup milk). It was so cheesy tasting with a crisp, crunchy outside crust yet tender inside. I could live on this alone!

Good, but definitely tastes like a cornbread.  I was hoping for more of a dense white bread.  Still good, but probably will look for something else next time.

I followed suggestions to increase the milk (1% worked fine) to 1 c. and the cheese to 1 1/2.  Also added garlic powder and Italian spices.  The results were delicious!  No problem with crumbling, it was actually pretty moist.  Definitely a keeper!

EXCELLENT.  This was very quick and easy.  I used 1 1/2 cups sharp cheddar cheese, a full cup milk, and a touch of garlic powder as other reviewers suggested, and it was PERFECT.  This is a sweet bread, but we like it just the way it is.  I will definitely make this again, perhaps adding some oregano or rosemary for an extra touch.  Thanks for posting!

I took this out of the oven about 1/2 an hour ago and have been waiting patiently for it to settle, it smells so good!! I followed other reviewers advice and increased milk to 1 cup, decreased sugar to 2 tbs, added 1 tbs garlic powder and 1 tbs onion powder, some chopped green onions, and 2 tbs Italian seasoning (the same one I use in pasta sauce recipes), and sprinkled some cheese on top for the last 10 mins of baking time. I also had to turn the heat way down for the last 10 mins or so, as the outside had a beautiful crust, but the inside was still mushy. Came out beautifully! Savory and cheesy, with a crisp thick crust and soft delicious inside. I agree that it's not the best "bread" recipe ever, but  an excellent quick and hearty accompaniment bread. We'll have this with a light chicken salad for dinner tonight. Thanks for the basic recipe, I'm sure you could do all sorts of variations with this recipe, next time I think I'll try parmesean, basil and sundried tomatoes!

Love this bread! It is great, quick and easy. I always approximate the cheese and it turns out great. If you want it a little sweeter just throw in another 1/4 cup of sugar. I change it up depending on what I'm serving it with. We love it!

One more thing, I always cook my in my cast iron pan - the crust turns out great.

This bread turned out great, not crumbly at all. I increased the cheese by a 1/2 cup and increased the milk by 1/4 cup. I decreased the sugar to 1 T and added 1 tsp. garlic powder and 1/8 tsp. black pepper (I think I'll use more of that next time). So easy to make and the bread was moist of fluffy; cooked exactly in the time prescribed. I'll be making this again and again!!

Pretty good for a quick and easy bread.  My husband and kids liked it as well.  To prevent crumbling, cut the bread in thick slices while it is still hot. Leftovers are good toasted.

Reading previous reviews about how crumbly these were, I didn't make mine into a loaf.  Instead, I made drop biscuits out of them.  The texture was fine this way, but I thought they were way too sweet.  It could be a personal preference there, but I would definitaly prefer a savory cheese bread to a sweet one.  I'll stick to the Cheddar Bay Biscuits recipe found on this site unless I find another one that's better.

This bread was good. My husband loved it. I added in 1/4 t. garlic salt in place of the salt and suggested garlic powder. I also did not have any milk and so I used 1/2 and 1/2 and the bread did not crumble like others have posted. From now on I will use 1/2 & 1/2. Thank you for a quick and easy bread recipe!

Im giving this one 2 stars because it is a very easy quick recipe, but the taste was just not good! 
The first time I made this exactly as the recipe calls, it was too sweet. The second time I made this I cut the sugar in 1/2 replaced the milk with buttermilk and added a little pepper and baked at 375F, looked nicer than the first but hardly any cheese flavor and both were a little crumbly. Wont try to make this again.

YUM! made this one day when I had made a big pot of cream of celery soup. I did increase the milk to 1 cup and the cheese to 1 1/2 cups (or so) as suggested in the reviews. Such an easy recipe. It would be delicious with stew.

Tastes great!! I usually add a pinch of black pepper, 2/4 cup raw organic sugar, and 1 1/2 cup of cheese. Gives it a bolder taste. This recipe also works great with whole wheat flour.

I used two cups of cheese and 1 cup of milk as well as some seasoning including garlic powder and oregano. I also covered the bread with cheese with about 10 minutes to bake. It worked well since I was serving it immediately.  The bread came out very moist and not like cornbread which I was trying to avoid.

It was good...but didn't taste very cheesy.  Next time add more cheese....different cheese....more salt...some butter (or something, I'm brainstorming here?)  It's a decent starter recipe though and served us well.  Thanks!

This bread has a nice crunch on the outside and is crumbly on the inside. I made it using mild cheddar which didn't give it much flavor- it tasted more like a sweet bread (because of the sugar), so next time I will use a stronger flavored cheese, like sharp cheddar. All-in-all, very good, and easy to prepare. It's a keeper!

This bread was great!  The only changes I made was a bit less sugar and a mixture of white cheeses instead of cheddar.  We had it with ham n beans and it was delish!  My daughter helped me make it...she's 4.  It was her first bread.

I added about a tsp of garlic powder,  increased to milk to 1 cup, decreased the sugar to 3 tbsp. and used 1 and 3/4 cup of cheese.  The only cheese I had on hand was a "Mexican mix"  of colby, cheddar, mozz, and monterrey jack. My  4 yo daughter said "This is better than Pizza Hut!" Very good garlic cheese bread. (I gave it 4 stars since I modified it)

This recipe was so fast and simple yet delicious!  My husband and I really enjoyed this bread.  I increased the milk to 1 cup total as other reviewers suggested but kept the amount of cheese about the same.  The first day yes, it was crumbly, but the leftovers did not crumble when cut.  My tip is that to make this a great garlicy bread I added a bit of garlic powder which also made it smell great!

This was awesome!  I did the following -increased cheese to 1 1/2 cups, increased milk to 1 cup, omitted the sugar and added a can of diced green chiles.  It was really moist and delicious.  Made it for my husband, sis-in-law and father-in-law and they all loved it.  This one is a keeper.

We thought this was great, considering the amount of time it takes!  I upped the cheese to a cup and a half and then listened to others and added 1/4C more milk as I thought the dough looked like it needed the help.  It accompanied our roast beef dinner perfectly and will be made again for sure.  Thanks.

This bread is very tasty! I followed the recipe exactly except I increased the milk to 1 cup as others suggested and used a combination of mexican & mozzarella cheese. It has a very nice flavor (not too sweet) and texture and didn't crumble at all. Next time, I might try an 8x5 pan because the loaf didn't rise very much and my baking powder was fresh.

Very, very good!  I did make a few modifications: per previous reviews, I increased the milk to 1 cup; I also decreased the sugar to 1 Tbsp.  I used garlic salt instead of regular salt.  And, I threw in a little parsley and added a little bit of shredded provolone cheese in addition to the cheddar.   It was moist and cheesy and flavorful, and not crumbly.   I will definitely make this again!

I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and cut back the sugar to 1 1/2 Tablespoons, and I only had olive oil on hand.  It didn't rise much, and I thought it was a lot like cornbread, which is fine, just really crumbly.  It tasted okay, but not too much flavor.  I think it would be really yummy with some garlic or herbs in it.  
It was very easy though, and fun to make with the kids!

I agree it'a bit on the sweet side, but it is definitely not a disturbing taste.
It is good, not super. I'll keep this recipe until something better crops up...

I tried it because the recipe just sounded really good.  I read the reviews and they were mixed, but I thought, eh-I'll just try it.  We did not like it at all. Way too sweet and just overall not a good flavor.  Will continue looking for a good cheesey bread.

Did add 1 cup milk. Texture was nice and moist. But...I didn't think there was enough of a cheesy taste to the bread. I just tasted salt. I used a sharp cheddar. I think next time I will use an extra sharp cheddar or add some parmesan cheese, reduce the salt. I wanted this as an appie to go with garden vegetable cream cheese. It was OK. But a nice slice of this with some unsalted butter and modification would be my idea of delish. (The original recipe is actually the Betty Crocker cheese muffin)
Made this recipe again. Added 1/2c more cheese. Sprinkled top with 1T parmesan. No sugar. Kicked it up to 4 stars! Keeper.  Added 2T fresh chives from garden as well..My 30 yr old son devoured the whole loaf

Yummy and fluffy. I added a bit of garlic powder for flavor. Next time will follow some other tips so it doesn't crumble so easily. Otherwise, the flavor was nice.

I liked it I added a splash more milk. As well as I used mozzarella cheese. I also had to lower the temp by 25• due to elevation.

This is soo good! If I could give it more stars, I would. I followed the recipe to the letter, and it came out moist and fluffy. The only thing I'll change the next time I make it, is to cut back on the sugar, but that's just a personal preference. This is outstanding just as written.

Just made this for dinner tonight.  I followed the other reviewer's advice and raised the milk to 1 cup.  I also used white whole wheat flour and cooked it in a muffin tin instead of loaf form, so the cooking time was a few minutes less.  Everyone loved these and I will make again!  Thanks :)

Not sure what happened here, but my bread came out more like a huge cheese biscuit than bread.  I followed the recipe to a "T" with the exception of less sugar, just a tablespoon.  Oh, well, it was fun to try, and the first slices out of the oven slathered in butter were tasty.  But as it cooled it just became one big brick.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

I don't taste any cheese and it is VERY sweet! I try to make recipes as close as possible to the original the first time but I followed some reviewers' advice and added 1 cup of milk and 1.5 cups of cheese bc I don't want crumbly bread. I used 1 cup of sharp cheddar (that's all I had left, I kept nibbling at it) and 0.5 cups of Italian cheese mix. I'd definitely recommend using at least 2 cups of SHARP cheddar! The consistency is exactly what I want from bread though, definitely add the extra milk and cheese. I'm going to give it another go with extra cheese, less sugar and see how it turns out. Not bad, but not what I was expecting either!

Not good at all. I followed other reviewers' recommendations and increased the milk to 1 cup, the cheese to 1 1/2 cups, and decreased the sugar to 1 tbsp. Strange texture, strange taste.

I love this recipe! I found that cheese bread muffins were just as good as a big loaf. I also switched out all of the vegetable oil for applesauce. It sounds strange, but it so good tasting! It also a lot healthier.

This is an excellent quick bread.  I changed it to an Italian cheese bread by substituting 1 1/2 cups of shredded Four Cheese Italian blend, 1 cup milk, 1 tsp dried minced garlic and 1 tsp Italian seasoning.  The possibilities of this bread are endless.  Next time I'm going to substitue the milk with beer.

i put savory, coriander, and marjoram (i think) and used 1 cup of yogurt instead of milk.  i used whole wheat flour, too.  i really liked this with italian cheese mix and a little sharp cheese.  i might prefer butter to olive oil, but hubby liked the taste of it.  thanks!

This isn't so much bread as a giant tasty biscuit. I approve. No fuss, no rising or kneading required. Fast and yummy.  I just made bacon, potato and leek soup and this is a perfect accompaniment.   Changes I made: I used jalapeño cheddar cheese and a Swedish cheese from Ikea that I didn't care for on it's own. I reduced the oil and sugar and added a little more flour. Also, I put a pan of water in the oven to make it extra crunchy. :)

I loved this. I was searching for something quick and easy and this fit the bill perfectly. I used a dark 9 in round pan and took it out a few minutes before the timer went off (I did the toothpick test). Aside from adding garlic powder and onion powder, I didn't change/sub anything. My husband loved it, LOVED it. The consistency wasn't too flaky at all. I served it with a pasta sauce and used it to sop up all the sauce. This made a good dinner, great. Thank you!

This is a good, quick and easy recipe. It's inexpensive to make, too. I modified it a little, using ideas of my own and some I got from other reviewers: I eliminated the sugar and replaced the oil with apple sauce to make it low fat. I added 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda. I used extra sharp cheese (you can use more cheese to make it cheesier). I added 1/4 cup of jalapenos (you can use more or less jalapenos depending on how hot you want it).

We had this tonight with the Black Bean Vegetable Soup from this site.  We loved it.  As per others' reviews, I added 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp Italian seasoning, doubled the cheese, increased the milk to 1 cup and decreased the sugar to 1 T.  I sprinkled a little shredded cheese on top for decoration a few minutes before it was done.  The bread was perfect at 35 minutes.  This bread was dense and moist, not crumbly at all.  The whole loaf was gone in one sitting.  I'll be making again soon!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This bread is very easy and looks pretty, but I wasn't a huge fan of the flavor. It's a strage combination of sweet and sharp.

I made this JUST as the recipe stated to do so, but added 1/4 cup of diced jalapenos.  This was PERFECT for the guys at the superbowl party :D

This is very good as long as you do the 1 cup butter and 1 1/2 cup cheese.  I also added garlic powder and italian seasoning.

Made this a few nights ago as a substitute for cornbread to go along with chili.  It worked splendidly!  Same consistency without the gritty-ness of cornbread.

I changed the recipe a tad, added 1 cup of milk and 1 1/2 cups of strong cheddar cheese. Bread was crumbly and lacked flavour. Will not be making again.

I tried this recipe once and changed it a little bit and it came out moist and you could definetly taste the cheddar. I went with one cup of milk and two cups of cheese (I used shredded cheddar from Dierburgs.) I also added garlic salt and garlic powder.

This was not very good.  I added extra cheese and it still didn't have a very cheesy flavor and the bread was not good enough to stand on it's own.  Both my kids are MAJOR bread eaters and neither of them would eat this bread.

This is a pretty good bread. I added extra cheese and milk like many others. I also added garlic, Italian seasoning and cayenne. The bread was good. I would make it again with my changes. It seemed a bit like biscuit dough to me. Next time I will make drop biscuits with it.

Very tasty!  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I did make a few changes.  I increased the milk to 1 cup, increased the cheese to 2 cups, decreased the sugar by half and finally added in a teaspoon of Durkee St. Louis Style Garlic Pepper Seasoning.  We had it with pasta and caesar salad, was a great accompaniment
with the meal, yummy!

Forgot to mention in my previous review -I used the suggestion to add only 1 tablespoon of sugar along with the teaspoon each of the spices. Will try dried basil next time instead of parsley. DO MAKE THESE!

This is an awesome recipe that is very versatile.  I've made it without the sugar and added diced green peppers and ham and it is a hearty bread along side soup or added apples for a breakfast bread.  Very simple and works every time.  Thanks!!

We like this a lot - but I can see why other reviewers would say it is a bit too sweet for their liking.  It is a sweet tasting bread, but if you use a sharp cheddar it cuts through the sweetness very nicely.  Also, as suggested by another reviewer, we increased the milk to one cup, but left the cheese at 1 cup; also added some garlic powder - was a great addition!

This was only okay -- definitely not fabulous.  I took the suggestions I read and added more milk, more cheese and some garlic powder.  My husband really didn't like it, and I thought it was pretty mediocre.  It's very dense and definitely sort of crumbly.  We only ate a little bit then I froze the rest thinking I'd like it again later.  I just ended up throwing it away from the freezer.  It's January now, and it's been there since this fall if that tells you anything.  We won't be making this one again despite it's ease.

I liked this recipe. Since the author said it was a bit crumbly I added a scant half cup of apple sauce and it was not too crumbly at all and added no taste. It was good and smelled great while it baked. Thanks!!

Great basic savory quick bread recipe. I made 3/4 cup of the flour whole wheat, 1cup milk, and about 1-1/2 cups shredded mild cheddar. I also reduced the sugar to 1 T, and added about 1/8 t cayenne and 1/4 t garlic powder. Moist on the inside, crumbly on the outside. Yum!

I made this today - it came out just before my son arrived home from work & he went crazy over this bread !  I'm not kidding he ate almost 1/2 the loaf . So I guess I will be making this many days of the month . LOL  I also used 1 C of milk & xtra- sharp cheddar cheese - no crumbly fall apart whatsoever. It was perfect to cut even while still warm .

I didn't really have issues with the texture, but the sugar is totally unnecessary in my opinion and it could use some onion flakes or powder, or even garlic to add flavor. 

I'd second other suggestions I've seen of doubling the recipe in a normal-sized bread pan as well.

This was good.  I was ,a king spaghetti and wanted something like  garlic bread, but did not have anything to quickly make it.  Tried this recipe and it was greatly  Did not rise as well as I would have liked, but still good.  My husband really liked it.  Will make again.  Quick and easy.

Followed Navy_Mommy recommendation and increased milk to 1 cup and 1&1/2 cup of cheese. The bread was still crumbly but tasty. Reminders me more of a corn bread or banana bread.

I absolutely LOVE this bread. I was skeptical about putting in the sugar but it added the perfect sweetness. I did use sharp cheddar as that is all I buy.  Almost added garlic but so glad I didn't because of the sweet taste. It is a little crumbly but not bad. Came out very moist. I also do not have a bread pan so used an 8 x 8 pan and baked for 20 mins and it came out perfectly!! My 7 year old autistic daughter who is a very fussy eater even liked this bread. Delicious!

I liked the idea that this was a quick bread using baking powder instead of yeast. I  made this using whole wheat flour and for the cheese I used a combination of 1/2 cup of parmesan and 1 cup of grated mozzarella, as another reviewer suggested.

I added an extra 1/2 cup of cheese inside the bread and an extra 1/2 cup on top during the last 10 min. Less sugar and more milk. It rose beautifully and had a nice golden color!

This is an easy bread. I lowered the amount of sugar and increased the milk by just a little. It was very yummy but it was too moist to slice. The texture was more like a cake. We ended up eating it with a fork. Haha. But the taste and ease will earn a place on my list of do again. This is a good basic start to alter depending on what flavor your going for. Next time I will try adding a different cheese and herbs or maybe even bacon.   This would be great with a big serving of chili or stew over the top to soak up the juices.

Having read 180 reviews about this recipe, some more closely than others, I chose to make the original recipe first. I was looking for something just a little different from the daily soda bread my husband grew up with. This recipe has a nice flavour, mildly cheese-y even though I used extra strong cheddar. I liked that hint of cheese, because I wanted bread, not cheese. It was quite crumbly, but in hindsight it may have been because I used skim milk. So I am going to make it tomorrow with whole milk, and see how it goes. That may solve the issue with the texture. This will be my exploration recipe for the week, though, so after tomorrow I'll play around with some of the ideas that previous reviewers mentioned. Of course, my husband will be the final judge! He also gave it 4 stars. **UPDATE** It is now mid-march, since first trying this in December, and I have made it with added sundried tomatoes - very good; then with pesto - good; and with passata, very good; and with bacon bits- OK. Always with cheese, the basic recipe, but adding these other flavours for extra difference. It is 4 star all the way, and now my basic quick bread for bake sales, gifts, and unexpected guests.

I did as others suggested and used 1 1/2 cups cheese and 1 cup of milk.  Yet still not cheesy enough for me.  Texture this way was great and did not crumble.  Only problem was it is way too sweat and bland.  I will make again, but will add more cheese, less sugar and as other reviews said, I will add dry Italian Seasoning mix.  I did enjoy the sliced green chilis I added to batter.

Holds true to the title, is very Quick and easy.  Used about 1 1/2 cups of Sharp Cheddar.  Taste is good, may try it again except next time use Shredded Romano for a sharper bite...  Also will try the 1 cup of milk.

This turned out really well. On the suggestions of others I used one cup of milk and 1 1/2 cups of cheese ( I used a mix of medium cheddar and Parmesan). I added a tsp of herbes Provençal  to the dry ingredients. Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper.

Tried this recipie with jambalaya and found the sweetness of the dough was the perfect compliment to the savory dish.  I did use the extra milk and extra cheese.... extra old cheddar inside and old cheddar and parmesan on top.  But I decided the sweetness of the dough might make a great loaf too.  I skipped the cheese and folded 2 medium sized diced apples coated in white and brown sugar and cinnamon into the dough just before it went in the pan.  Then I cut  1 tbsp butter into 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon and 1 tbsp of flour.  Spread over top as a crumble and bake.  It took extra time, around 45 minutes.  Just keep.poking it!  The result was absolutely amazing!  Delicious moist apple bread.   Great for.french toast.too!

Loved this! I took the suggestion of others and used a cup of milk, and 1 1/2 cups of cheese. 
I think I might also try to cut the sugar and use garlic as was suggested by another person to make a savory bread. 
That said, this bread is sweet and delicious. 
Thank you

I have a gluten disorder, so I made this recipe with a cup-for-cup exchange gluten-free flour.  It's really hard to find tasty gluten-free bread. This recipe was delicious and not at all crumbly. I sliced it with an electric knife. I shared it with friends who are not gluten-free and they loved it, too! Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Very good and easy. Not really what I was expecting but still delicious. It's a little on the sweet side, kinda like cornbread, but not near as dense. I didn't taste much cheese, but I used medium cheddar. Next time I will cut back on the sugar and add extra sharp cheese. I will make this again.

Delicious.  I changed it up a bit and used garlic cheddar cheese and used my muffin top pan and made individual rolls.  Also, I made them gluten free as I have celiac disease.  They were so good, I've got a second batch going now and will have to post as I used buttermilk in this batch rather than milk.

3. add fresh rosemary
4. add 1/2 cup cheese after 20 min.
5. take out after 30 min.

LOVE this recipe! It's easy and quick, and even better the next day (if it lasts that long :D). Like others, I increased the cheese to 1-1/2 cups and the milk to 1 cup. I also added two minced garlic cloves for extra flavor. It's a very versatile recipe - would be great with parmesan cheese and italian seasoning for Italian night. Next time I going to try it as muffins, with chopped bacon, green onions, and substitute sour cream for some of the milk!

I made this recipe almost exactly as described with the minor alteration of using only half the sugar.  I thought the flavor and texture to be perfect, my family loved it and I will be sure to make it frequently in the future.  In fact I can imagine it as a base recipe I will try experimenting with in both savory and sweeter (cinnamon, maple syrup, and carrot as one reviewer suggested.  Thank you so much Elizabeth Sarah!

This recipe produces a very moist quick bread!  I substituted almond milk added a tsp of dill and a 1/2 cup of Granny Smith apple.  Delicious!  This is definitely a keeper!

I wanted a quick and easy bread that I didn't have to knead or wait for it to rise.  No yeast was also a plus.  This was VERY quick, easy, and delicious!  I didn't have cheese but I did add in some chopped artichoke hearts, mushrooms, and garlic.  I used the 3/4 cup milk it called for and it was just fine.  I used almond milk though instead of regular.  I will definitely make this again and continue to add various ingredients for different tastes.  Great bread!

I changed the recipe a bit. Upped the milk to 1Cup. Used entire block of seriously sharp cheddar, about 2 Cups. Also added cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and italian seasoning. Came out fantastic. Very dense bread, but excellent sliced, and toasted with a little butter the next morning. May try to incorporate pepperoni next time.

Quick and easy cheese "bread" that is perfect with chili or soup. Not for sandwiches - more like cheese tea bisquit.

I wish I could give it 3-1/2 stars.  It doesn't deserve a low "3" it's not aweful or a bad bread but I ususally rate things that aren't a definate "GO-TO" recipe but worthy of keeping around as a "4"  This recipe is just a so-so, edible-but-not-desirable recipe.  The presentation of the the bread was good, made me & hubby excited to try it.  But, the taste left a bit to desire.  It was more like a biscuit in bread form (which isn't a bad thing) but it needed something more, too bland.  Some suggested adding herbs or even Italian dressing seasoning.  Both, I think, would maybe help improve this bread.   I'm not going to give up on improving it...it's got potential.   Even eating it as you would a biscuit would help, maybe some jam or honey butter would be good.  It just wasn't the hearty bread to go with a soup dinner, like a traditional bread would be.

It's far too sweet with the sugar, even with just a tablespoon, so I omit it completely. The consistency and flavor remind me of the biscuits at Red Lobster. I would recommend allowing the bread to cool for awhile before cutting it. Otherwise it falls apart. Excellent with soup, spaghetti or hotdish (yes, I'm Minnesotan).

SPICE IT UP!!!  I followed alot of people's recommendations about lessening the sugar (2 tablespoons) and upped the milk (1 cup).  But since I like the spice I added 2 heaping table spoons of chili garlic sauce and probably about 20 or so jalapeno rings (which I always keep on hand...but I am sure you could use banana pepper rings) chopped really fine.  I also upped the cheese to 1 and 1/2 cup but I mixed it up...old cheddar, parmesan, mozza, emental, paderno...whatever I had on hand.  Sooooo good!  Really pretty and super good.  Texture is very much like banana bread...held together fantasticly!  Ate it with pasta...but can't wait to have it with red pepper jelly and cream cheese!

I made the adjustments that others suggested, 1 cup milk, 1.5 cups cheese and 1 T sugar.  It was pretty good, but very dense.

Quick and Easy as promised. My cheese loving little guy thought it was too sweet and I agree so for the next loaf I'll use less or leave out the sugar completely. I added Parmesan cheese (1/4 cup), dried mustard(1 tsp) and dried garlic with parsley (1/2 tsp-Morton brand) to the dough to up the flavor a bit. Great with chili!

I only gave it 4 stars because you have to alter the recipe itself for it to come out great.   Add 1 & 1/2 cup of cheese 1 cup of milk  pinch of sugar  It was so good and it didn't crumble at all like some people were saying. When it only had 5 mins left in cooking I took someone else's idea and sprinkled cheese on top. My one year old son loved it and it was soft for him to eat since not all of his teeth have come in yet. It doesn't need topping or butter just eat it as it is!   YUM! YUM!

i agree with some of the last reviews to cut the sugar a bit. i did find it a bit sweet for a cheese bread recipe. i added a splash more milk as it seemed to be a bit dry and about 2 cups of grated marble cheese and it turned out great. huge hit with my kids and hubby. this recipe is a keeper for sure

A good 'base' recipe and I made some changes too including upping the cheese to 1 1/2 cups, upping the milk to 1 cup, cutting the sugar to 1TB and cutting the baking powder to 2teaspoons. But very yummy and will be making again for sure!

I also was glad to have read the comments (thanks dianemwj!!)and modified it by increasing the cheese to 1 1/2 c. and the milk to 1 c, only putting in 1 Tb sugar, adding garlic and onion powder plus a dash of cayenne pepper and adding 1/2 c more cheese on top part way through baking. I used a mixture of mild cheddar and parmesan and romano. It was phenomenal! If I had made it according to the actual recipe I probably wouldn't have liked it as it would be way too sweet. I once made a Tastefully Simple beer bread mix with garlic and cheddar added to it but did not like it because it was too sweet. I imagine that would be how this bread would taste. I didn't want a crumbly texture as we were having it with soup. It turned out nice and moist and flavorful...I wanted to eat the whole loaf!

This came out very good. I made modifications based on personal preferences as well as recommendations. I used 1 cup unsweetened soy milk because we're not milk drinkers and this is what I have on hand. I've never had any problems with this substitution in baked goods. Decreased sugar to 1 heaping tablespoon. Added about 1/2 teaspoon onion powder into the dry ingredients, 2 heaping teaspoons minced garlic into the wet ingredients, and put in about 3-4 tablespoons total fresh chopped herbs (Italian flat leaf parsley and marjoram from my garden), increased total cheese to 1.5 cups, 1/2 cup of freshly grated Parmesan. I think the finished product is pretty darn good. When I make it again I would increase the salt to at least a teaspoon, it could definitely use some more. It's definitely not too sweet with the heaping tablespoon of sugar; what's called for in the original recipe would be way too much for my taste.

This is pretty good, but has WAY too much sugar.  I would go with other reviewers and scale it down to 1 T. at the MOST.  Otherwise it kinda has a sweet taste to it, which seems a little odd for a cheese bread.  Also, I added extra cheese as per other reviews, and I quadrupled the recipe to make for the bread co-op I am in.  To the quadrupled batch, I added 1 1/2 T. garlic powder (I think I might try 2 T. next time, it needed a little bit more) and 4 t. Italian seasoning.  I might try upping that amount too next time just a tad.  I also liked someone else's suggestion of cubing the cheese to put in.  But definitely agree to add MORE cheese than calls for.  I rated it 4 stars, because with the above adjustments, I think it would be a 4-star recipe, maybe even a 5-star :)

This recipe was useful when I realised I had 2 more people for dinner than I originally thought. I reduced the sugar to just 1T, added a couple of pinches of cayenne pepper and took other reviewers advice and upped the milk to a cup. It went very well with our pasta dish and evryone enjoyed it. Many Thanks Elizabeth Sarah.

It was good, my kids all ate it so that makes me happy. Could have had more flavor, so I have it 4 stars. I used whole wheat flour to make it more healthy (another reason I'm glad everyone ate it!).

I tried following the other reviews by adding:
1 cup milk, 1 1/2 cup cheese and only 1 tbsp sugar. 
Think the original amount of cheese on the recipe would be sufficient. 1 1/2 cup cheese is too much, came out very dense and heavy but moist. Will follow amount of cheese stated on the original recipe next time. This is a good cheese bread recipe (good flavour and smell) but not the argentine cheese bread i was looking for.

This was good, not what I expected it to be but pretty good.  I added more milk and cheese, cut the salt and sugar.  I baked it into muffins.  It came out a lot more biscuit-like than I thought it would.  I think reducing the baking powder would change that a bit.  It was good; we ate them with a salad.  The flavor of the cheese kind of got lost in the bread but they were still good.

I really liked this bread. The consistency is much more like cornbread than bread. I followed the suggetions of others and reduced the sugar and used extra sharp cheddar and pepper jack cheese for the extra flavor. We had it with tomato bisque, but I think it would be an excellent bread to serve with any soup or stew.

The bread turned out amazing! I don't cook that often (mainly because I'm still in the habit of eating from my college dining hall 3 months out of school) but this was so easy. I took the advice of some of the others and added more cheese and milk to the bread (i'm a huge fan of cheese!). I also added added some garlic and cheese to the top about 20 min. into the baking process. Next time I would add some stronger cheese just so that you can really taste it, but me and my girlfriend loved it! It was tasty and easy to make.

A great easy cheese bread.  I sometimes add chopped pepperoni to the mix.  It is so good to have with a salad.

As others have suggested, I used more cheese and cut down on the sugar.  The texture of the bread was nice, but I didn't care for the taste at all.  The flavor of the cheese didn't stand up to the taste of the dough, and the dough wasn't particularly good.

Expected cheesey pull away bread, but it had the consistency of cornbread w/o the corn meal. I did modify it based on the suggestions, and was happy that I only used 1 tbsp sugar & 1 cup milk.

Yes, they're a little sweet.  Next time I will sprinkle the cheese on top so I can taste it more, since I could not really taste it mixed in.  I added fresh parsley and candied pumpkin seeds on top.  Yummy!

The best thing about this recipe is the texture.  I made it once as is, and then I made the following modifications with much succes: I used about a tablespoon of sugar instead of 1/4-it was too sweet, and didn't work with the cheese.  I also added some minced garlic, parsley, and some onion to give the bread more flavor.  It was fantastic!

I cut this back to a 3 because I made it as-is first (which I rarely do and wish now that I hadn't!).  It tasted like the Jiffy mix cornbread with a biscuit texture.  Hubby liked it because he likes sweet cornbread, but I wanted something savory...if I'd wanted cake, I would have made cake!  Next time I make it, I'll follow suggestions of omitting the sugar.  It should be great once you take away the sweetness.

This bread came out well. I omitted the sugar and used 7 grain flour instead of all purpose. Came out great. the only thing I was disappointed with was it was VERY VERY salty!!
