We liked these sandwiches pretty well but it is VERY salty and in general has a very overwhelming flavor.  I would like to try it again sometime with my own pesto, which tends to be less salty.  And also not layer the ingredients on quite so thickly.

This was very good! I used roasted red peppers instead of sun dried tomatoes.

This sandwich has the perfect balance of flavors and was very easy to make. I was able to make the sandwich while the oven was preheating. I did add a piece of ham to the sandwich but it is equally good without. This recipe is sure to be another favorite for a tasty and quick lunch.

I used ciabatta bread instead of pita, and added lettuce and slices of fresh tomatoes.

Made this today to go along with the red pepper pasta. It was fine... I liked it alright, but I think in the future I'd pick a different sandwich. I love love love goat cheese and sun dried tomaters but this just didnt do it for me that much. I followed the recipe exactly! But it was really fast! Thanks

Thank you for an amazing recipe! Rather than using a pita I used a high fiber whole wheat tortilla and spread the ingredients on one half and then folded over. So easy and so delicious!

I made this using a whole wheat tortilla and cooked it like a quesadilla.  Love all the ingredients seperately but it is really rich when they are all combined. I think it was the sun-dried tomato that pushed it over the top for me.  I cut down on the proportions but it was still pretty rich. I'm thinking fresh basil and fresh tomato would be better.

My husband LOVES these.  He still makes them as a snack often.  He likes to experiment with stuff to put in them.  Most of the time, he leave it just the way it is.

I thoroughly enjoyed this sandwich.  I made it on 100 calorie whole grain pita rounds and eyeballed the ingredients.  I didn't expect to like the sundried tomatoes, but together these flavors just all worked.  I will be making this again.

This was such a great alternative to the typical lunch and sandhwich I normally do.Im trying to eat less meat and this makes it so worth it! I suggest buying your pesto from Whole Foods and the rest of the ingredients.Their homemade pesto is so fresh. What a tasty and super easy treat!

I made this exactly as stated--using a whole pita rather than half, and I LOVE this. I used plain goat cheese, next time I might try an herbed goat cheese, but as is, this is such a tasty recipe--a great combo of flavors and very easy and quick. If you like goat cheese and basil pesto, you can't go wrong with this. I did have black and red grapes on the side, and it was a really great light lunch. I'll make this several times more; thanks for submitting this.

I used whole wheat pitas and only used 3 oz. of goat cheese for 3 full pitas.  5 ozs of goat cheese was a little too much in my opinion.  I also brushed the tops with some olive oil to make them a bit crispy.  Added ham to hubby's and he preferred those.  They were super tasty but next time I will add some more veggies, maybe some peppers.  We had salads on the side for a good meal.

I'm not a huge pesto fan, but I enjoyed this a lot. I pretty much just eyeballed the ingredients, and added some shredded romaine lettuce. I'm sure I'll make it again. Thanks, Alesa!

These are great for a quick lunch.  I used roasted red peppers instead of sun-dried tomatoes because that's what I had.  I also added deli turkey slices.  I love goat cheese, so that really hit the spot for me!

Tastes great for such a simple sandwich. I used feta (I think that's goat cheese at least...) and added some halved fresh grape tomatoes. I have never really liked sundries tomatoes but they went well with the feta. It all worked together so nothing was too overpowering.

Not bad but it is a tad salty as some others mentioned.  Didn't have pita so just made a grilled cheese out of it.  Good when your looking for something quick and easy.

Adding fresh tomato made the difference for me!  The fresh tomato adds a delicate element with the light juices.  The flavors of the sundries, pesto and cheese are wonderful together but are heavy. Add fresh tomato and it is heavenly!

I should have listened to one reviewer who said they added tomatoes and lettuce. I don't know if I mismeasured, but I found it almost too much saltiness. I'll probably give it another try at some point, but it's not a favorite as of yet.

Maybe the pita bread I got was too dry/thin, but they didn't turn out like the picture. I don't think stuffing the pocket is the right thing to do.

This seemed to be a slightly skimpy sandwich.  Unfortunately, I discovered that I no longer like goat cheese and DH hates pesto.  Not the dish for us.
