I have to admit - I was skeptical, but I was hungry for something different when there wasn't much in the kitchen. This is an *excellent* one-dish meal, perfect (like it says) for college students like me!

I have made this several times now and it's always great!  What makes it extra yummy is using Velveeta Extra Thick cheese slices.  I think there are 10 in a package and I use the entire package. I use an 8x8 glass dish and put half of the slices in the middle and the rest on top.  This keeps well and the left overs are great.  Thanks so much for this awesome recipe!!!!

I made this recipe for my family and everyone liked it! Even my picky child. I did however use sharp cheddar cheese instead because my family loves cheesy foods. I will definitely make this one again. Thanks Dawn.

This is about as easy as it gets...I used a bit more egg noodles andd added an extra can of tomato soup along with 1 can of corn and 1 can of green beans (both drained)...put 3 of the slices of cheese in the middle of the mix and the last 5 on top...25 minutes in the oven for a complete meal...was great the guys loved it as well...I think the only thing I would do different next time is use more cheese =

Well I reviewed this once but somehow it disappeared. So here I am again. First of all this is decent for an empty cupboard meal. It used items I usually have on hand and made a huge huge pan full. I topped half of this with biscuits at my husband's request. This was okay and will fill you up but it isn't something we would fix again. It needed something for flavor as the vegetable soup taste was pretty dominant. It was easy to fix and made a decent comfort food. Thanks Dawn I enjoyed trying out your family recipe.

My husband is a very picky eater but he liked the flavor of this casserole although it didn't especially suit me. Next time I think I would add another can of tomato soup as it needed some moisture. Also I might add a can of corn or something 'crunchy' to liven it up a bit. Overall easy good recipe.

Thanks all for the good reviews! Try chopping up an onion and put that in when you brown the meat. I actually forgot to put that in the original recipe when i posted this recipe and we did originally use Velveeta cheese. I was not a fan of cheese on it when i was handed down the recipe but over the years i can never get enough on it. I've also found that the thin egg noodles not the wide egg noodles work best because the same amount of the wide noodles soaks the moisture up and leaves it dry. This recipe is so easy and basic it has so much room to alter it in so many ways to anyone's liking but seriously chop an onion - HUGE difference! So sorry i forgot it originally. Those of you who were not impressed may change your minds!

The name of this dish makes it unattractive. However my entire family loved it and the left overs were gone the next day! Very easy to make too!

This was total comfort food. So easy to make and the only changes I made were to double the tomato soup and add more noodles. I needed to stretch the dish. This is a keeper.

I love easy comfort food and this was perfect. It is a little uneventful but adding a few spices really perks it up and makes it very tasty. Great recipe!

How easy and tasty is this? Even a kitchen clod like me was able to get it right. Would like to try it with ground turkey and a wild mushroom soup instead of the veg. It even tasted nice right out of the pot without baking and cheezing. Sort of a do-it-yourself hamburger helper.

I got mixed reviews on this recipe. My kids said it was "pretty good" while my husband refused to even eat it after one bite. He said the tomato soup taste was too strong for him. Too bad probably won't try this one again.
