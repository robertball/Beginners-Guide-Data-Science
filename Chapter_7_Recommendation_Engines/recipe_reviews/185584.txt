Muy ricas. La masa necesita más sal y yo también agregué un poquito más agua para una consistencia más deseable. Siempre omito las acetunas cuando hago las empanaditas, a mi no me gustan tanto.. pero igual las tuyas las hice y resultaron riqiusimos. Gracias!

My mother is from Chile and this recipe is almost exactly like hers.  She used green olives with pimentos instead of black olives.  An easier recipe for the dough is:
four sticks of butter melted
one cup of milk
four cups of flour
mix, cover and refrigerate over night
let the dough sit at room temp for about 20 minutes and it is easy to roll, flaky and perfect
brush empanadas with a beaten egg lightly before baking

This is for the dough only: it wasn't bad, but it wasn't the authentic empanada dough I was looking for.  It wasn't flaky or pastry-like enough, so I'd say the proportions of butter and flour would need to be altered.  If you aren't used to eating real empanadas, then this dough will do just fine, but if you are cooking for Latinos, you should keep looking for a better recipe.

I had more filling then dough and it seemed the dough was a little dry but the more i worked it the less dry it became. I also used groundbeef insead because whenever I've been to chile that is what I would get plus I could not find ground pork. Very good. Esp liked that I could make the dough and it turned out great!

Love the combination of the olives and raisins in these chilean-style empanadas.

I made this recipe and found: 1- the filling to be very good and flavourful I used ground beef instead 2- the dough as described was too dry and hard to handle so I added water until it became soft and elastic (perhaps due to variation in flour) 3- i used the amounts for 18 empanadas but made 85 mini-empanadas for a party.

I have just made these. They are delicious! I had a teacher from Chile who used to bring empanadas to class. They taste exactly the same.

I made this first time ever making Empanadas and it was a HUGE hit. I will definately be making this again. The filling is so good - everyone asked what was the slight sweetness inside and they could not guess it was the raisins.

These would have been better if the dough had more flavor. All the work it took to make them wasn't really worth it.

Great recipe! I studied in Chile last fall and for my first time making empanadas they turned out pretty good. I'm not a big olive person so those were left out the only other thing I might change next time is using maybe 1/2 cup of raisins. I felt like there was a lot but they were still great. Also I would consider getting pork and cutting it myself for the meat mixture. Thanks for a great recipe though!:)

This was very nice and easy to make although I had assistance from a stand mixer to make the dough. Otherwise I think the dough would be a lot of work. Next time though I'll probably put some chilli flakes in it. There is a little bit of heat but I like it spicier.

Excellent empanadas! I have never eaten Chilean empanadas besides this ones but the dough of this empanada was very similar to the ones I have eaten in Argentina. My filling was a bit different: bell pepper onion ground turkey (instead of beef or pork) with the rest of the spices. The empanadas turned out excellent! It can be used as a great base for other meat empanadas! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

My empanadas came out delicious! Next time I won't put the cornstarch in the cup of water. I had to add more seasoning after that. Didn't really need the cornstarch. I also read how bland the dough was so I added oregano and Italian seasoning to the flour and brown sugar to my butter flavored shortening and milk mixture. Definitely gave a great flavor to the crust of my delicious empanadas. A lot of work but worth it. Got meat leftover so I'll make more tomorrow for work.

The dough is dry and tasteless even after I added more water and salt. If you would change the dough recipe it would be much better.

My husband lived in Chile for 2 years and has eaten a lot of "authentic" (for lack of a better word) empanadas. We liked these but next time we'll go a little lighter on the raisins.

Excellent! My parents were from Chile as well and I have made these from recipes given to me by my relatives but never made with pork until now. Thanks!

Five stars for the dough. It was so easy to make and tasted delicious. I can't comment on the filling because I made my own.

I used only the filling portion of this recipe since I already have an empanada pastry that I like. The family liked this recipe a hit with everyone. The only thing I would do differently is use a bit less of the chopped black olives and add some chopped green chilis to the mix. There was more than enough mix to fill numerous empanadas. I make mine small 5 inch circles and we had about 24 and enough mix left over for another ten at least. I served the remaining mix over a hot rice for a quick lunch.

I was so excited to find this recipe. I lived in Chile for a year and have been craving empanadas ever since. These weren't as good as those I had in Chile but pretty close. Since other reviewers were saying the dough was too dry I only added 4 1/4 cups flour and used 2 sticks of butter instead of shortening and the dough was not dry at all and was very easy to work with. I put the dough in the fridge while I made the filling then took it out and rolled it.

Loved the flavor of the filling. I used currants instead of raisins (thought the smaller version would blend better). The dough was a bit hard to work with. I think next time I'll use less flour or more butter. Also found that the thinner it is rolled out the better.

Being from Chile our typical empanadas are made with beef not pork. The dough should be light and flaky or it would turn too dry. I will make this recipe with beef and report the results.

Excellent filling recipe!! I didn t include the raisins (personal presence). I used a roll-out prepared pie crust instead of making the dough from scratch and it turned out perfect! I suggest making them a bit larger than a cup or cookie cutter will give you. Chilean husband says it reminds him of home.
