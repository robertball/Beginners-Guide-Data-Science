Scaled this down to 2 servings and made as written. This didn't look the prettiest but the flavor was great. The pickled jalapeno really made this one stand out. I actually made 3 different vegan ceviche's last night and this one was my husbands favorite. He said it had a smoky flavor and one that stood out. We did both agree that it needed more cilantro and so I added it but other than that I wouldn't change anything next time.
