I made a few change to this recipe as well. I have made Mexican Wedding Cookies for more than half my life. It was taught to me by my Auntie Nacia when I was in high school. I use powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar. I have used one teaspoon vanilla extract, real not imitation, and one teaspoon almond extract. You can also flavor these cookies with rum, frangelico, kahlua, or any of your favorite spipping spirits. Sift your sugar and your flour to make your cookie dough light in texture, before and after baking.

I love this cookie recipe.  It is quick and simple, and great for any occasion.  I used 3/4 c. chopped pecans (the small package of chopped pecans found in the cake mix aisle at the grocery store) instead of almonds.  I only chilled my cookie dough 1 1/2 hrs.  They were delicious!  They had great flavor and did not crumble or fall apart when baked.  This is an overall great cookie recipe.

This was my first shot at making wedding cookies.  Although I used pecans instead of almond, these were/are excellent!!  I even received raved review from the girls I work with.  Thank you for such a yummy recipe.  I have to say that I have had wedding cookies in the past that were awful.  This is the perfect recipe!  Merry Christmas!  I made these again this year and they were still excellent.  I used pecans and walnut together and I only baked them for 8-10 minutes maybe because my cookies were smaller.  These are addicting!!

These cookies were simple to make, and would be simple enough for a child to make (w/ adult supervision).  Commonly known as Russian Tea Cakes, they are also referred to as Mexican Wedding cookies.  I made the batch twice -once following the recipe, the second making some subtle changes.  Here are the changes I made.  I swapped the regular sugar out and replaced w/ 10x confectioner sugar -this produced a smoother texture.  I left out the water, and added 1/4 tsp of salt.  I reduced the amount of nuts to 3/4 cup and replaced the almonds with pecans. 
I also added 1 TBSP of vanilla caramel powdered dairy creamer to the powdered sugar, when I rolled the cookies in it...and WOW is all I can say!
The first batch was good (a 3.5 star rating) but I enjoyed the second batch better thus the five star rating

I couldn't get the powdered sugar to stick to the cookies after they had cooled...might try rolling them while still slightly warm.

These are great cookies; however, I made a few changes.  I used confectioners' sugar instead of granulated white sugar, sifted the flour, and used pecans instead of almonds.  They are like pecan sandies in confectioners' sugar.  I made them for my christmas cookie tins.  I made them ball shaped and called them snowballs when anyone asked what they were.

I made this recipe for a Spanish project for the whole class. It turned out bsolutely amazing and everyone loved them.  They're best if you put a ton of powdered sugar on them.  They are also very easy to make. I have never baked in my life and they turned out great!  It's a great recipe for a beginner.

This was a great recipe!  I did use chopped walnuts in place of the suggested nuts because I prefer a softer nut with these cookies, I also used powder sugar in place of granulated because it does give it more of a "melt in your mouth" texture.  Other than that, it is a keeper in my holiday baking!

I made these for the holiday's and they turned out great.  I added a pinch of salt to the recipe.  I also added red sprinkles to the confectioners sugar which made it a little more festive. I'm not sure why the recipe states to refrigerate it for 3 hours.  I'm don't think it's not necessary.   Great tasting cookie!

I made it w/o any changes.  I made it 3 times in one week while my entire family was out of town. Memorized the recipe, and ate them all by myself.  No guilt, no regrets, no sharing.  And because the good fat of the almonds was there it canceled out the bad fat of the butter.  Did not gain any weight.  LOL.  woot.

These cookies are very easy to make and melt in your mouth! The traditional recipe calls for almonds, but I also like to use finely chopped walnuts or pecans because of their softer texture. The secret to keeping the powdered sugar on while not having to use a whole box of powdered sugar is to dredge the cookies the first time while still slightly warm, so the powdered sugar gets melted and is a bit "tacky." Then allow them to cool fully, then re-roll them in powdered sugar. They will cover completely and look beautiful, and the sugar will stay on! For Christmas, I add a final light dusting in red or green sugar sprinkles over the powdered sugar.

I may sound like Paula Deen but don't short the taste of the recipe with anything but REAL BUTTER.. You can also use this recipe for a great cookie dough pie crust, Just spread dough in pie pan before chilling in the fridge...Cold dough makes the crust flake.  This recipe will make 2 pies

These cookies were very easy to make.  I didn't chill the dough as suggested because I used a small cookie scoop to shape them.  Since I used chopped almonds, I used 2 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. almond extract, and 1 tsp. water.  To make coating easier, I put the powdered sugar and cookies in a large ziplock bag and shook it to coat.  These will be a hit in my holiday cookie platter!

My mother made cookies very similar to these for years. I used powdered sugar instead of regular sugar (as someone else suggested), chopped pecans instead of almonds, and almond extract instead of vanilla. There was no need to chill the dough before baking. The cookies were pretty cool when I rolled them in powdered sugar, and the sugar stuck just fine. If you roll them in sugar too soon, the cookies will crumble. Also, I know from experience, these cookies freeze well. Thanks for the recipe!!

what's not to love about these addictive tasty treats! Growing up these were also called "snow ball cookies" or known as "russian tea cookies" but whatever you call them they are so delicious and they disappear fast. Instead of white granulated sugar I used powered sugar. I did not have any almonds on hand but used walnuts instead, rough chopping them. I added more nuts because I love the nutty flavor and crunch in my cookies. I also added a pinch of salt and I made 18 round cookies, golf ball sizes. The dough was easy to put together. I baked 325 for 20 minutes. while they were luke warm I rolled them into the powered sugar and let them sit (resisting the urge to eat them while they cooled completely). These cookie melt in my mouth and are so yummy with the nutty crunch of the nuts and rolled in tons of powdered sugar. The powdered sugar in the dough really make the texture of the cookies come out much better (lighter). Usually I wait until the holidays or a special occasion to make these cookies -but today I didn't need a reason to make these!

These cookies are very moist and delicious.  Not to sweet and the flavor of vanilla really shines through.  I would recommend doubling the recipe, these will go quick.  Also mine baked for about 20-22 minutes.  I made about 1/2 balls with the dough and got 20 cookies.  I also halved the almonds and chopped them first.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Works wonderfully as a gluten free cookie by substituting gluten free flour and insuring all of your other ingredients are gluten free. I use Jules Gluten Free Flour.

I don't know what happened but I could not get these to turn out the way they were suppose to.  I followed directions exactly EXCEPT I kept them in the refridgerator longer.  They just didn't cook correctly.  Also, after tossing in powdered sugar they got real mushy as the sugar didn't 'dry'.  I made this twice wanting them to work but I couldn't do it.  I won't make again b/c I just can't do it correctly (DRATS)!  I wish it would have worked.

I used walnuts because I had them on hand - they came out great. I think either nut would work fine.

Thanks for the recipe -- it's just what I was looking for. I wanted a melt-in-your-mouth cookie and to enhance that I used all confectioner's sugar. I used pecans as they are softer and have the flavor I wanted. I toasted the pecans lightly and then chopped them finely. I also added a pinch of salt. I refrigerated overnight. After baking and cooling I coated them liberally with powdered sugar, a lot more than the recipe calls for, and let them sit undisturbed for awhile. That way the sugar sticks. One change I would make next time: They flattened rather than remaining as balls, so biting one causes powdered sugar to fly! I'll make them quite small next time so you can pop a whole one in your mouth.

I truly adore these cookies, which I call "tea cookies" more than I call them mexican wedding cookies. They are delicious with coffee or tea, and I normally replace the almonds with walnuts or peacans. I find the flavor to be better. These "butterball" cookies are excellent, and everyone who has tried them, loves them! You can add little accents like perhap a little bit of lemond rind or lemon extract to the dough to flavor it differently. I also like to roll the balls in the sugar when they are warm. It makes a nice icing like consistancy.. mmmm!

These are great cookies. Use butter instead of margarine for richness and I used ground up pecans instead of almonds and got raves from a co-worker who stood over the plate and ate them all!

My mom made these cookies for years and what she did was make 2 batches. She would color one green and add pecans and the other red and add walnuts. And she also only used confectioner's sugar. 
They are the perfect Christmas cookies!

Awesome cookies!  Very easy to make!  I substituted walnuts for the almonds (had them already) and no problem.  I made about 8 dozen for a work function and they were all gone!  I tried sugaring the cookies before baking the first batch and I didn't see a difference.  I did as others suggested and sugared the cookies while still warm and then again after they had cooled.  They were very very sugary.  Yum!!

NUM!  Mexican Wedding Cookies are my FAVORITE!  I was so happy to find this recipe!  It's so simple too!  Although I found that instead of rolling the cookies after they cool, it was best to roll them first when they are fresh out of the oven, let them cool completely, and roll them again.  It gives them that yummy layer of sugar that is just divine!

I've been making a similar recipe for 30+ years. I grew up calling them 'Portuguese Wedding Cakes', but the only change is powdered sugar rather than granulated in the dough, like others have stated. They really do melt in your mouth!

This are great! I substituted pecans for the almonds since that was the only thing I had on hand.  Other than that I didn't make no changes.  Although the recipe calls for a very small amount so I hade to make more batches.

the perfect recipe. I prefer finely diced almonds - the almond flavor is essential for the mexican wedding cookie. also very important to follow the advice on rolling the cookies twice in powdered sugar (first time when they are hot so it will stick the second time)

I tried many recipes for snowballs also known as mexican wedding cookies and this by far has got to be the best of them all.  I have baked these and brought them to work many times, they never last long.  Excellent Recipe!

This recipe is so easy.  The only problem is the time you have to wait for the dough to chill.  But they're great cookies so it's worth the wait.  I've gotten nothing but praise for the cookies I made.

Loved these cookies once everything was fixed! I followed the recipe to the letter and the batter came out crumbly???? Is that normal? I added enough water to make it moist so I could shape it into balls and that helped. Please help me with my issue or if it's normal!! Otherwise they are sooooo delicious!! :)

This is my go-to recipe for Mexican Wedding Cookies.  They are always a hit.  Just keep an active eye on them while they're baking; they are a little temperamental.

This was my first time making these and I'm very pleased with the end results. I tried making the crescent version but it was hard to shape the soft dough so the were a little odd shaped but no matter. I rolled the cookies when they were warm and the powered sugar melted which gave it more sticking power when I rolled them a second time. A few cookies just exploded into crumbles while rolling but most of them made it intact. I loved the flavor and was disappointed when my party finished off the last one before I could hide some for myself. I grounded up walnuts and really liked the taste.

I was very happy with this recipe.  I only made one change - I substituted pecans for the almonds due to availability.  I coated the cookies with powdered sugar by tossing them in a zip top bag, which cut down on the mess.  I coated some while warm and some after they had cooled completely.  I prefer waiting until they cool.  True - not as much sugar sticks to the cookie, but it they turn out a little sticky if you coat them when they are warm.  Thank you for a great recipe.  I can't wait to get up in the morning and have one - or five - with my coffee.

These cookies ROCK.  They were so good and so easy to make.  I used cashews instead of almonds because I like them better.  Tasted great.  I will make these again often.

I prefer using confectioner's sugar rather than granulated, in the main recipe.  Also, there are so few cookie recipes using almonds--why use pecans in this recipe?  I toast the almonds whole in the toaster oven, then finely chop in blender.  Melt-in-your-mouth good!

This was my first try at these little cookies.  They were fantastic but I also had a time trying to get the powdered sugar to stick.  I rolled them right out of the oven warm, let them cool for a few and rolled them again.  Some sugar did stick.  I tried shortening my cooking time from 20min. to 12min.  Didn't help the powder sugar but they were flakier and much better. I found I have to be careful about not making the balls too large also. I used pecans which I think is traditional.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will be part of Christmas gifts this year.

Absolutely loved this cookie! I made one addition to the recipe.  Before I rolled the cookies in confectionery sugar, I brushed them with melted butter which took away any dryness and caused more sugar to stick to the cookies. People commented how my cookies were not dry when most wedding cookies are and they kept coming back for seconds.

Very good recipe.  My mother used to make these and I wanted to find something similar.  I took the advice of other reviewers and rolled the cookies in confectioner's sugar as soon as they came out of the oven and then again after they cooled completely.  The sugar stuck tight.  Thank you for sharing!!

I followed this recipe exactly and though delicious, the cookies are so delicate, they break when you pick them up.  Wondering if I did something wrong.

I just made a batch of these cookies yesterday and they came out great.  I did just use 1 teaspoon of vanilla and added about 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and they came out great everyone loved them.  I will make another batch today and for Christmas make some to give as gifts.

Great cookies! Used confectioners sugar instead of regular sugar to give this a crumbly shortbread like texture. We prefer pecans better than almonds for this type of cookies. With such few ingredients, you must use a quality grade butter such as AA or A.  This is really good but I only gave it a four because it wasn't quite like the one I tasted in San Diego, CA.

Made some revisions: used powdered sugar in place of regular sugar and used chopped walnut because thats what I had in the house.  Tasted awesome - but the cookie crumbled & fell apart when trying to roll.. Not sure if I did something wrong..

I've made these cookies following the recipe and I've made them changing the type of sugar and the type of nuts.  Whatever you decide the recipe is EXCELLENT!

I just made these, they are sooo delicious! And easy to make!   Like many other reviewers, I substituted confectioner's sugar for white sugar. I also added an extra smidge of vanilla and dipped the cookies in powdered sugar while they were warm, the sugar stuck better this way. I used almonds and chopped them coarsely in the food processor. They now have a delicate almond flavor.  I also refrigerated my dough for about 2 and a half hours. I'm very impressed with this recipe, thanks for posting!

This is a recipie that I make for my family and friends every year at Christmas. I make several batches using different extract's, my favorite is peppermint flavor. This year I am going to try lemon and orange extracts, I'll let you know how they tuned out. Seriously, I don't think that you can ever go wrong with any flavor you choose with these cookies.

These are really good, but I'm not sure about the 3 hour chill time. Mine was  hard as a rock after 3 hours and I had to let it sit out a bit before I could form the dough into balls. Suppose it could be my fridge but 3 hours seems excessive. Ultimately it was a good cookie.

It kills me not to give this 5 stars. For once I made the recipe exactly as written.  My mom makes these with pecans, but I love almonds so went with the recipe. I used the recipe I printed out years ago so forgot the recommendation to use the powdered sugar vs granulated. The dough is dry and is supposed to be, but they didn't harden and have the crisp afer cooking like I remember. I think the problem was the almonds. I used a hand held food chopper and I don't think they were fine enough. The larger nuts are chewey. If I use almonds again, I'll use the food processor or just go back to pecans. Make sure they are cooled comepltly before sugar otherwise the sugar melts and they become gooey.

I'm giving these 4 stars despite the fact that I screwed up this simple recipe!  I only used 1 stick of butter (1/2 cup) and couldn't figure out why the batter was so dry.  I added about 2/3 cup water and formed the balls anyway.  I did use powdered sugar instead of granulated and added 1 tsp almond extract.  Even with all these changes the cookies still turned out pretty good!  Next time I will use the correct amount of butter and 1/2 tsp almond extract.  I think they will be perfect!

I used powdered sugar instead..gives a very light texture. I also tried it w/ one t vanilla and one t almond extract and turned out very nicely. This essentially turns it into my childhood traditional family Christmas cookie, pecan sandies. They are our favorite!

This is probably my favorite Christmas cookie, but I'd never tried to make them. Just ate others'. This year I'm  baking cookies to take home for the holidays so I thought I'd try this. So good! I subbed powdered sugar and sifted both the sugar and flour. I used half/half walnuts/pecans finely chopped. And one teaspoon vanilla, one teaspoon almond. Will add more almond next time- and there will be a next time. I didn't experience any crumbling. Thank you for a favorite!

1.  Use REAL butter.
2.  Roll baked cookies in confectioner's sugar while warm.
3.  Roll again in confectioner's sugar when cold but use FRESH sugar.

YUM! My changes: orange/tangerine juice for liquids and lots of coconut flakes. I didn't have any vanilla so I squeezed a Cutie tangerine (I have also used orange/lemon zest). I didn't chill for long (1/2hr in freezer) and they came out a little flat, but oh so tasty.

I have always wanted to make these cookies and have finally done it.  I did substitute confectioners sugar for the granulated sugar and used very finely chopped pecans.  These came out fantastic.  They melt in your mouth.  Be sure to roll the cookies in the confectioners sugar when they are still warm.  That will make the sugar melt to the cookies and give it that oh so sweet coating that makes these cookies so yummy!

This Mexican Wedding Cookies are delicious.  Light and not too sweet. I,like other readers used powdered sugar instead of the granulated sugar. When I took them out of the oven I let them cool for about 5 minutes and then carefully with a spatula  I put them on the wire rack( otherwise they will crumble) and sprinkled powdered sugar and let them cool.  Once cooled I sprinkled them again with powdered sugar. They do expand when baking so I made mine very small so you can just popped them in your mouth! For Xmas I am baking these cookies but this time I will try the recipe with cinnamon.

I am very unimpressed. I made two batches of batter and let it chill overnight. It was too difficult to actually get the batter from the bowl and shape them, then they turned to liquid butter in the cookie pans. Finally I put them in muffin pans and only half turned out right while the other half turned to . What did "come out" were paper thin, and tasted like . 

DO NOT TRY THIS RECIPE

When I was a child and I was learning to cook I used to make these all the time.  They are very good and simple and you usually have most of the ingredients.

mmm... melt in your mouth! easy recipe.  Followed other reviewers suggestion to use powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar, ommited almond extract and pecans(didn't have any available).  Made balls about 1" in size and baked for 20 minutes, cooled them for about 8 min and powdered them with sugar.  Wll defenately make again and again.

These were good but they turned out very dry and crumbly and were hard to  make into balls so I had to mix in some more of the creamed butter and sugar. I also did use powdered sugar in place of the granulated as others had suggested. If I make these again I think I would add some coconut to them for a kick.

Great Recipe! I also substituted almonds with pecans and added almond extract. I noticed not a lot has been said concerning cookie consistency. This cookie needs to be a teaspoon sized ball so that it doesn't break apart after baking. I tried multiple sizes and the best consistency was with the small sized cookie. The large size was delicious but didn't stay together and fell apart. Happy baking!

This was a great, easy recipe. Before trying it, I made some changes as well. I followed the other reviewer's advice and switched the granulated sugar for powdered sugar. I then used pecans instead of almonds and I used a caramel flavor syrup instead of water. I also only chilled for an hour instead of 3. They were great!

These tasted great, but they flattened while baking. They ended up completely flat like a chocolate chip cookie. I've gone over the recipe and I don't see where I went wrong. I plan to try again to see if I can get them to keep their shape.

These are my favorite cookies to make at Christmas. Don't over bake these cookies or they will be dry. The dough freezes well if you just want to make a couple at a time.

These cookies have been one of our family favorites for years.  I double the recipe, and usually get about 11 dozen nice bite size cookies.  They are super easy and very quick to make, but are also very quickly gone! =)

as written, this recipe is not good. Even the oven cooking time is off. And what is the point of refrigerating the dough for 3 hours??! There are better recipes for this traditional cookie, this is not it.

these cookies are HEAVENLY !  My only regret is that I didn't double or triple the recipe !!  I only had 3/4 cup almonds and used about 1/4 cup of walnuts.  I had started the oven timer on the low end of the recommended baking time and had to add 3 minutes to the time (I made them big), I end up making about 30 of these.   YUM, can't wait to go to the Christmas Party today!!

I first made these in high school in 1957. We used chopped cashews and rolled them into small balls about 1" in diameter. As far as whether to coat them with powdered sugar when warm or when cooled, we did both! We rolled them while warm then let them cool and rolled them again. These are one of my faVORITE COOKIES.

Toasted the almonds first, used all powdered sugar, sifted the sugar and flour, added more vanilla and some salt.. SO good! Also, per some earlier reviews, I did the final sugaring after they cooled- turned out GREAT!

I made these cookies for my spanish class. I felt like this was a great way to look into another culture. They were very easy to make and fun. It was interesting to find out information about the spanish culture by making these delicious cookies.

I made these cookies and they turned out great. everyone loved them,they were perfect as a going away gift to the bride and groom.I doubled the recipe and made the cookies a bit smaller so they were one bite cookies, less messy that way for party guests.The only problem I had with them was that I had to coat them 3-4 times in powdered sugar since I did as the recipe suggested and powdered them first when slightly warm,so the powdered sugar became doughy like on the cookies, so I recommend letting them cool completely before powdering them in the sugar.

Couldn't be an easier or more delicious cookie, I have made this so many times since the holidays I don't need the recipe. This is my girls favorite cookie that I make. Thanks for sharing this easy recipe.

ok, I made a few changes to suit a craving I've had lately for lemony powdered cookies, this is what I did: followed recipe replacing vanilla extract with lemon extract and also omitted completely the nuts (added a little extra flour instead to attain more 'firmness' to the dough). Small bite sized pieces on the cookie sheet and baked 17 min. Fantastic!! Will definitely make again and again! :)

My husband loved these cookies! We made two batches; one to give away and the other we ate. [oink oink :)] We did not find it necessary to chill the dough. We did as others suggested and use powdered sugar instead of granulated sugar.We used pecans; turned out great.Smaller sized balls seemed to bake better. Thank you for this recipe; we ate a similar cookie at a party last summer and we had been wanting to make some. We are going to make another batch tomorrow. yum yum

I am very unimpressed.  I definitely should have read more reviews and swapped out the sugar.  These cookies are way too dry and not tasty at all and as others have said the confectioners sugar doesn't stick well to them.  I will be searching for a better recipe for this cookie.

I made these cookies for the cookie exchange for work. I made this and rolled sugar cookies (which I also got from Allrecipes.com). These cookies were so easy to make. I just changed to the 1 cup conf. sugar and rolled when still warm engough to handle. Came out PERFECT!!

Split the dough in half.  Use food color to make 1/2 red and the other 1/2 green.  It makes a fun Christmas display.  Suppose you could even dye them blue for the jewish holidays.

this was ok.  I think that I will try it next time with the powered sugar instead of the regular sugar.  It lacked something.  My mother use to make these for us when I was a little girl.

these cookies are a bit too buttery for my liking. my family didn't care too much for them, but that wouldn't be the cookies fault. i'm more of a choco chip cookie type. i'm not making this one again. o yeah, if you dont feel like waiting for 3 hours, just wrap the batter before you go to bed and it'll be ready for baking in the morening.

These tasted like dry, unsweetened crackers.  My friend tried to come up with something decent to say when I gave him one but I totally agreed.  I should have stuck with the classic recipe on the back of the powdered sugar box.  I think using powdered sugar in the cookies must make a huge difference.

I just made these and they are great! I used pecans because that was what I had on hand. I creamed the butter and sugar for 5 minutes and my cookies came nice and tender. I was able to get 40 cookies out of this recipe using a 1 1/2 T cookie scoop. I sprinkled the cookies with powdered sugar while warm. I baked for 17 minutes on silicone mats.

Didn't do any freezing and they turned out great! My oven cooks uneven so I baked my tablespoon -sized spheres for 8 minutes, then rotated the pan and baked for 8 more. I got about 35-40 cookies in this batch. I also used the unsalted mixed nuts from Costco instead of just almonds.

Next batch i will probably try adding cinnamon and maybe less sugar.

Delicious, fun, and easy to make! Thank you!

Really great recipe. The only thing I changed was to use pecans instead of almonds. I just didn't have any almonds. The cookies came out great and everyone that has some raved about how tasty they were. I'm definitely going to use this recipe again.

I saw all the comments saying you couldn’t get the sugar to stick so i have made these tons of times and i always put them on a cooling rack over the sink brush the tops with butter and then heavily dust them with powdered sugar and it works great

I did my first batch by recipe. They came out dry, more like a Sandie. I made another batch and used vanilla bean paste and less flour. I added caramel drizzle over them and then dusted with powdered sugar. Good. I am going to use lemon paste instead of vanilla next time.

I added a half tablespoon of cinnamon and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also changed unsalted to salted butter and used powder sugar instead of regular sugar. Also when cookies were still warm I rolled them in powder sugar then sifted some on top after about 20 min's in the fridge. :)

I’ve loved these since I was a little girl. My Mom used to make them around Christmas time. There are a couple of tweaks I like to do; 1)Add a tablespoon of whipping cream to the batter, 2) Add 1/4 cup of chopped pecans, 3)Instead of 2 tsps of vanilla, try 1 tsp of almond essence, and one of vanilla.

I followed this recipe exactly as written, with the exception of the 3 hour cooling period for the dough. Due to time constraints, I let my dough cool for 1.5 hours. The recipe was super easy and quick. Cookies turned out great! They were a big hit with my husband and kids. Will definitely be making this again!

Even with the powdered sugar it still tastes salty. I think it could have been the butter. I’m going to try and add more powdered sugar.

I made these in Home Economics class in the ninth grade many years ago.  (This is the first time I have made them since then. ) They are very bland until  rolled in the confectionery sugar, then they melt in your mouth.  I will make these again!

we used crisco instead of butter and the cookies turned out a bit flat. The taste was still very good! We used the almonds that are used in salad;they are thinly sliced almonds. They were crumbly a bit; my favorite Mexican Wedding Cookie consistency.

I'm madly in love with these cookies. I made them exactly as the recipe suggested except I used walnuts (I'm going through a walnut phase) and added 1 tsp almond extract. Delicious. As another reviewer noted, if you roll the cookies once as soon as they're cool enough and then again after the sugar has melted, it sticks really well. My father banged his fist against the table top after trying them, which is his ultimate compliment for food.

Too much white sugar since they're coated in powdered sugar...Walnuts make them dry, so I use pecans for sweetness and moisture.

These were perfect!  I actually liked that the dough had to be refrigerated for a while - gave me time to clean up. . I made them as per the recipe with one exception, I substituted confectioners sugar for granulated in the cookies.  The were the perfect consistency, didn’t crumble easily and tasted delicious.  I made them for a friend's birthday celebration and would post a picture but had none left over!  One lady loaded a small plate to take home. I will definitely make these again.

Bernie,

Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe! 
Instead of using almonds, I used walnuts.
I added more water slowly, since I live in South Florida, it tends to dry dough out faster as well.

I enjoyed making these cookies espcially with some simple ingredients. I substituted the almonds for pecans.  I'm not a big fan of this type of cookie, but they were really good. I'm making a couple batches now for a birthdy party.

                  Thanks for the recipe

Easy to make and delicious. And they stay fresh for days (if your kids don’t eat them right away).

The taste is very similar to cookies we make in Serbia called “vanilice”. We usually make them very small as a nickel and then glue two of them with jam.

Was an easy to follow recipe. I thought it was a little dry, however I never made this type of cookie before and the person I made it for said they came out perfect. Used half vanilla and half almond extract. Will use this recipe again.

This recipe was great and resulted in a terrific cookie. I made them  as “snowball” cookies during Christmas. I substituted 1/4 cup of the flour for almond meal,  and used 1 cup  chopped pecans.  This recipe yielded about 3 dozen cookies.

The taste was fine, but I couldn't get the cookies to roll into a ball (or any other shape). I ended up patting them into a cake pan, making bars out of them, and sprinkled powder sugar on top.

I love to try out new recipes and I was very excited to make these as they're one of my favorite cookies, but it came out differently than I was expecting. It was my first time making them so I wasn't sure what to look for in the dough ans thwy came out flat and sticking together. It felt like the firat time I made chocolate chips cookies as a preteen again. I want to try it again and get it right, any suggestions to avoid gravity in the oven?

I love these cookies! They are so easy to make. I used walnuts instead because that’s what I had on hand and they came out great. I’ve tried other recipes and while the taste was good the others were way too crumbly. These hold their shape well so they are good to travel with. Once again....YUM!

Excellent cookie.  I used pecans  since it was all I had.  Perfect cookie for any occasion.

I've been using this recipe for many years and I think its perfect and so delicious.  Many recipes for these cookies call for confectionary sugar instead of granulated.  I have tried it but they weren't as tasty as these cookies.  For best results I chill my dough overnight.  Yum!

We've been making these since I was a child. It's a super simple recipe and perfect for kids to join in and get their little hands messy. I normally switch out the almonds for pecans or walnuts just to switch up the flavor. Just make sure you don't make them too big, else they don't cook in the center and taste weird. I've also made a version with Splenda for my diabetic family members. Even tho the Splenda bags says it's a 1 to 1 ratio to real sugar, I find that blend and add 1.5 cups of Splenda instead. I'd also wait until the cookie is cooled before rolling in the powdered sugar, else it's melts and sticks to your fingers when it's warm.

Recipe is super easy to follow. I substituted walnuts for the almonds because that is what I had on hand. I put the dough in a sealed container in the freezer for one hour  and then transferred to the refrigerator to speed up the chilling process. Super easy and you can bake on one cookie sheet . If I was making them for an event I would definitely double the recipe.

It's a 5-star with these changes: definitely grind the nuts - I used pecans; absolutely substitute a tsp of almond extract for one of the tsps of vanilla - I use pure Mexican vanilla; and, sift the flour. They come very close to the Mexican Wedding Cookies I treat myself and family to in Mexico. (Bucerias - Pie in the Sky, if you're ever there.)

Fantastic recipe--I got a ton of compliments at Thanksgiving dinner. However, I took some of the reviewers' advice and the cookies  were a success because of that. I used 1 cup chopped pecans instead of almonds; I used one teaspoon vanilla extract, and one teaspoon almond extract; and because we didn't have butter, I used shortening instead. I rolled them into nickel-sized balls and baked for about 17 minutes. So happy with the results!

Delicious! I have made a similar recipe from this site that uses walnuts (Russian Tea Cakes), but this is so much tastier. My husband loved these and said they were one of the best things he'd ever eaten.

High altitude.  This does not work. I think if the water was omitted and a tad more flour. We r at 6100 ft.  They tuned out very runny. We ate the crumbs. Very good on ice cream.

A few very important points. First, I detected no benefit to refrigerating the dough, mine became hard and very difficult to work with.

Next, if you use a 1-tablespoon measure for each ball you'll get about 3 dozen wondrous little cookies that are incredible at a potluck.

Lastly, I only had 1t vanilla left so I used it and 1t almond extract. It added so much to the aroma and taste of the cookie! I also used walnuts because I didn't have almonds. Boy, what a great, easy, fast and delicious cookie!

Oh - and try rolling a few in cocoa powder instead of powdered sugar!!!

These were some of the best cookies I've ever made. I took the suggestions from the comments and 1) Used 1 tsp vanilla and 1 tsp almond extract and 2) Rolled the cookies in the powdered sugar while they were still warm. Delish.

I followed the recipe exactly and while the cookies tasted good, they were a little dry and crumbly.  No complaints from the other eaters though.

They were perfect, easy, and great with some drinks after dinner!  Made them for a Cookie Exchange and different from most!  I loved them!

I used Pecans  instead of what was in the recipe, but worded great!

I didnt add the water, but I creamed the sugar and butter VERY well..so I needed another half cup of flour to hold it all together. I used a combination of pistachio, almond and walnuts. I also used half vanilla and half almond essence. I used a small ice cream scoop to mould the cookies. I find the less you handle the dough with your hands, the fluffier it is. The end result was just out of the world.  Thank you for the recipe...this is a keeper.

I made this but didn't  taste great, I  know its from omitting  the nuts(I'am allergic  to nuts ). So thats probably  why they didn't taste well. ???? I have to find a recipe  similar  that tastes good without nuts.

I replaced the white sugar w/ powdered sugar. Used pecans, and added 1/4 c. diced maraschino cherries to the batter.  So much fun!

Very easy recipe to make. Cookies turned out buttery and with good texture. I used chopped pecans and granulated sugar.. I will try powdered sugar next time just to compare.

This recipe is HORRIBLE.  We followed it to the letter and they did not come out at all.  We gave up and found another recipe.

Woah, what can i say, my mom and i made this and let  me tell you that it is great! The only thing that we changed was the almonds with pecans and i do not thiink that we kept it in the fridge for 3 hours, maybe i am guestimating about 1 an a half hour or 2 hours.....Well again thank you for the recipe, i am planning on making more todayy.

Delicious! This is my go-to cookie recipe. Definitely add a pinch or two of salt when making these, or else they turn out a little bland. I also like to add almond extract for a bit of extra flavor. Try rolling these in a mix of cinnamon and powdered sugar-- it's even more delicious this way!

Yummy. Substitute a little rice flour for the wheat flour. It has almost no gluten, and gives the cookies a nice, fine crumb with a snappy bite! The cookies also last longer in the freezer.

These turned out so yummy! I used powerded sugar instead of white sugar in the dough and instead of using 2 teaspoons of vanilla I used 1 teaspoon each of almond and vanilla extract (I love almonds).  They  were super delicious and perfectly almondy!

I chose to use the powdered sugar based upon the reviews. I also used pecans and vanilla extract because I had those on hand. Based on previous experience, I knew to roll them while still warm.  These cookies were awesome, and I am looking forward to trying them with almonds and almond extract. On a side note, these will be placed in special bags and used as guest favors for my niece's baptism.
