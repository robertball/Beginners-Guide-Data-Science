So sweet they should be a dessert, not a breakfast item!  I used spelt flour, which cooked up into nice crepes.  The peanut butter mix was difficult to spread on the delicate crepes; I was concerned they would tear, it really needs to be thinner!  The combination of the rich chocolate and the fat in the cream seemed to make the sauce extremely sweet; maybe a few drizzles would have been more appropriate than trying to cover the crepe!

I did gluten free flour mix and it came out really good. I think next time I make it I'm going to add a Raspberry sauce with it. Really good. Made it for Valentine's breakfast.

This recipe was submitted as a dessert, not a breakfast item. I am not sure how it got categorized as a breakfast crepe...all I know is that it wasn't done by me...the person who developed and submitted the original recipe.
