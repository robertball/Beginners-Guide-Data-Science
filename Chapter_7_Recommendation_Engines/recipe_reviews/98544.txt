What a great, easy idea for brocolli. I loved the flavor, but found that the brocolli was pretty tough. The next time I cook brocolli this way (and it will now be a favororite method) I plan on tenting it with foil to keep it a bit moister.

Ya, I know..it's my recipe, but I forgot something :)  Don't forget to taste!  It might need salt and pepper! Enjoy!

This truly is pure genius! The fresh garlic and drippings added just the right seasoning. I microwaved the broccoli for 2 minutes prior to adding to the pan which shortened the cooking time in the oven.

I cooked "Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style" (submitted by Sue Rogers on Allrecipes.com) and then cooked my broccoli using this recipe.  The spices from the chicken mixed with the broccoli and garlic were phenomenal.  The only problem I had it that my broccoli didn't get done anywere near the time suggested in recipe.  Next time I will cook broccoli in microwave until it is almost done and then cook using this recipe.  Thanks for a WONDERFUL EASY way to make broccoli special!!

This was a very easy recipe and will make my broccoli this way anytime I roast chicken!  My kids loved it.  I did add a bit of butter and a splash of water since there wasn't very much chicken drippings.  (I used a store-bought roasted chicken and used the drippings from it and heated in the oven while I had another side cooking in the oven) It did take a bit longer than indicated.  The temp was at 400 degrees and it took close to 20 mins.

So good Kristin! Added a few more seasonings and roasted the broccoli longer than suggested. Some parts were even a little crispy which made it especially delish. Thank you!

This recipe sounded way too easy to be so good, but AllRecipes ratings never lie! It was excellent. The longer you cook, the softer the broccoli gets, so I taste test occasionally for crunchiness.

The idea of the chicken drippings intrigued me.  What great flavor they’ll give the broccoli, I thought.  That, accompanied by the rave reviews, led me to anticipate something delightful, a real treat.  I didn't go through the trouble of roasting the chicken myself, but I did buy a rotisserie chicken, with its accompanying wonderful drippings, expressly for this recipe.  I was disappointed in the result.  The broccoli never really got tender (let alone in 5-8 minutes) and, frankly, was surprisingly even on the dry side.  If I was to do this again I’d steam the broccoli first and then toss it with the drippings, skipping the oven-roasting altogether.

I usually roast my chicken on top of my vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, onion, carrot, potato & garlic  all rough cut). Salt and pepper veggies and garlic and toss with just enough extra virgin olive oil to coat lightly then place seasoned chicken on top & roast. I've done whole chicken and chicken thighs, both delicious!

It should be against the law to throw away chicken drippings.  LOL!  For all the "scaredy cats" who think pan drippings are "bad for you" just skim the layer of fat off the top.  The bottom (darker color) of the "drippings" doesn't have fat!  Sheesh!

We used frozen 'California Mix' veggies and it was great. Do make sure to season to taste. Not healthy, but quite tasty!

Excellent trick !  I also microwaved the broccoli first...just for five minutes to take out the hardness, but the drippings did the flavoring perfectly.

Never in a million years would I have thought of this. Thankfully, I found this recipe because it's an incredible way to make broccoli! (Used the Cornish Game Hens With Garlic & Rosemary recipe drippings - and roasted for 9 minutes).  KEEPER!

I will NEVER roast another chicken without making this broccoli! I used a defrosted bag of baby broccoli florets and drippings from the "Roast Sticky Chicken-Rotisserie Style" recipe on allrecipes. Was so delicious! Really can't wait to make this again YUM!

This was convenient and very easy! I cooked the broccoli for 10 min in the drippings from my roast chicken. Next time I will degrease the juices first to cut down on fat. Thank you for a great idea!

We really liked this, much better than roasting with olive oil. I was lazy as well and used garlic powder and a bit of sea salt. Great way to eat your broccoli.

I've had this recipe in my recipe box for a while. And I was making 'Salsa Chicken' from here and thought this would work perfectly; and it did. I cooked my broccoli a little first, then took my chicken out to rest, tossed the broccoli in the salsa chicken juices and put under the broiler for a few miniutes. Excellent, I'll make this again for sure.

I really expected this to be awesome.  Broccoli is always good,  but this wasn't really any better than my normal recipe.  It was very easy however and,   just not quite as good as I had hoped.

I really liked this as did my family. My husband's only gripe was that there was no cheese for his broccoli...but, that could easily be fixed. I made a lemon infused roast chicken by stuffing the cavity with onion, garlic, lemon, lemon thyme and Rosemary as well as injecting the chicken with lemon juice and garlic.  So, when I reduced the dripping down and tossed the broccoli in it, it paired really well with our chicken! I will definately make this again! Thanks!

What a clever idea! I bet this would be great with asparagus, too, or any other veggie that could roast quickly. The only thing was the timing ... the amount of time is takes for these to cook is dependent on how hot your oven is, how firm/soft you like your broccoli, and how small you cut up your florets. Mine were ~ two-bites-each sized florets, in the oven for about 12 minutes at 400 and they came out cooked and just slightly crisp. Gotta love having one less pan to wash. Brilliant!

A good way to cook broccoli.  Very easy and practical.  I wish allrecipes.com had half-star ratings so my husband and I could split the difference.  He gave it a lower rating (3 stars) as it is a bit fatty cooked in the chicken drippings.  I would've given it 4 stars but I gave in to his rating.  I took the advice of another rater and left the broccoli in the oven longer (about 15 minutes or so) and that was great.

I only rated this 4 stars because it wasn't THE best way to have fresh broccoli, but it was so simple to do and great on the plate! Even my husband-to-be who doesn't particularly like broccoli enjoyed them.

I'd give the taste about 4 stars, but the ingenuity and ease gets the extra star.
I was dubious, but it's tasty!  My only quibble is I would like more precise measurements for broccoli vs. drippings -- like how much the head of broccoli should weight per 1/4 cup drippings. Make sure to use just enough to moisten, as the recipe says; too much and it's soggy, too little and it scorches.  I also used the stems of the broccoli cut into chunks.  Very nice.  Thank you for the great idea.  I wonder if it would work on baby potatoes?  MMmmm.

I needed a side dish in a crunch and felt like making a roast chicken anyway.  I was skeptical, but boy, was it good!  My boyfriend said "Once again, you've outdone yourself."

Although my chicken was spicy, the brocoli had no great flavor and was actually greasy.

Best broccoli ever!!! I paired it with Juicy Roasted Chicken from this site and it was perfect. No extras were needed. I did follow the advice of the other reviewers and microwaved the broccoli first. If I would have had more time, I would have put it in raw and roasted it longer. You have to try this recipe!!!

I cooked a whole chicken in the crock pot, and when the chicken was done, I just took it out and put the broccoli in to cook in the drippings. I stirred in some garlic powder and cooked it on high for maybe 45 minutes. Next time I would either cook it a little longer or microwave it for a minute or two first, as other reviewers suggested, since it was a little crunchier than I prefer. Not the most exciting broccoli recipe, but the easiness made up for that. I'll probably experiment with more seasonings next time.

Really tasty! I love finding purpose for the pan drippings when I bake chicken thighs. Added s&p. The bits of roasted garlic were ????

So simple but so good, I used a bag of frozen broccoli florets heated 2 minutes in the microwave before putting it in the pan. I left it in the oven a little too long and they came out a little crispy on the bottom which gave it a different texture that I loved. This will definitely be a go to side dish when I make chicken from now on.

It was pretty good. It gave it a good flavor but I have to agree, the broccoli was a little tough. I definitely suggest roasting the broccoli a little longer. Other than that, I found this to be a decent recipe, as long as I don't think about the roasted chicken drippings.

I thought this had a Wonderful flavor.  I could see if your chicken isn't roasted in something very flavorful then your broccoli may not be flavorful. I didn't have to add anything except the garlic and I used 3 cloves that I sliced up(we love garlic).  You do need to adjust the amount of drippings for the amount of broccoli.  I had 3 small heads of broccoli in the bunch I got at the store.  I cut up and I did use the stalks, I just thinly sliced them. I used about 1/2 cup of great drippings.  I cooked mine @ 350 for 20 mins. Could have cooked a little longer.  I understand that I added the stalks so that is why I had to cook longer than what the recipe called for. I had cooked the chicken a couple of days ago and remembered this recipe so I just saved the drippings and today I pulled it out and used it, so glad I saved it!

10-28-12:  Made along with "Chicken Breasts with Olives" recipe, using stuffed green olives from Sentry's olive bar and a jar of sweet pickled cocktail onions.  6-12-15:  Made with "Deviled Chicken Legs".  Very good.

So good and so easy when already making roasted chicken. I had to add a little salt to my broccoli.
