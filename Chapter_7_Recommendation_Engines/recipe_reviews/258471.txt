4.23.18  My pear was pretty ripe, and I think that’s why the topping ended up just a little mushy.  Flavor was awesome, but the texture wasn’t the best, so I’d suggest you not use a pear that’s overly ripe like I did.  Also, you may want to cut back a bit on the time that you bake the crostini because it crisps up very quickly once it’s under the broiler, so you could end up with something that tastes like a cracker.  The ingredients are harmonious, and I wouldn’t hesitate to serve this to company.  KerriJ, thanks for sharing your recipe.

The only change I made was that I actually caramelized my shallots.  The directions in the recipe do not equate to caramelized onions, as it states in the title of the dish.

The taste is great.  I think next time I may make a balsamic reduction to drizzle on the final product.
Thanks for sharing your recipe, it is really good!
