This is a nice looking dish. It was  good, but  I added garlic powder, old bay, and a bit more cayenne pepper. Thank you for the clear instructions and recipe Chef John :)

This recipe was a perfect foundation! Super easy to put together and tastes delish. I know some people had mentioned that it was a little bland. So, to overcome that, I added a little more garlic (3 cloves), and some spices (oregano and basil).  I added 1/4 cup of parmsean cheese, only used 1 package of cream cheese, and added 1/2 cup of sautéed spinach. Also, I'm sure it would taste better with real lump crab meat, but I used imitation crab meat which was $3 instead of $15, it still tasted wonderful and gave it great crab flavor and texture.  This dip was gone in 30 min, and even my pickiest guests thought it was amazing!! I will definitely make this again and again.

I have made this recipe for several group meetings and it has been loved!  However, since I live in rural Costa Rica, I have had to substitute for some of the items! Had to use canned crab (drained), leave out the tarragon (not available here), and use local cheeses (mostly goat) since other cheeses are imported and cost $7+/- an ounce! I did add a few jalapeno peppers (finely chopped).  I also made it with mushrooms instead of the crab (canned crab is $5 for a small tin) and it went over well! I highly recommend this recipe and know that it can be varied and still be great!

The bread bowl sounds wonderful but I threw everything into a crock pot the night before. I put it on 3 hours before my guests arrived the next morning - stirred it up once it was hot. I threw down some crackers and while my family was chowing down someone suggested tortilla chips so I put those out as well! It was a big hit and super easy to do the night before so that I could focus on other aspects of my cook out!

This was a great base recipe, thanks Chef John.  I was looking for recipes for the holidays but didn't want to make as much so first I cut the ingredients by half for the trial.  I also used 1 T parsely in place of the tarragon because I'm not a tarragon fan.  I am lucky enough to live in the NW so I used Dungeness crab.  I also added 1 1/2 tsp of Old Bay and 2 T parmesan cheese to the mix.  I also used about 1/4+ tsp of cayenne as I like spice.  I used the marinated artichokes from Kirkland brand at Costco and drained and eyeballed 7 oz.  I also used sharp cheddar in place of the white cheddar as both are strong flavors and added parmesan to the top to mix with the cheddar for browning.  It was a fabulous flavor but a tiny bit runny so I may cut a bit of the sour cream or mayo next time and maybe add a bit more cream cheese.  I also didn't bake or serve in a bread bowl.  I cut up and lightly buttered french baguette and baked for 12 minutes at 400.  All in all a really good recipe that will be a huge hit at the holidays.

We made it with some left over king crab (I know, right!?). I loved the way all the flavors blended, added about 2T of hot jalapeno juice to add just the right amount of kick. It is just a bit bland, but hey you can always add spice, much more difficult to take it out. Good stuff!!

I am not sure why people haven't rated this recipe? It was last year's Superbowl treat and we loved it.  This year I have crab I caught out by the Farallon Islands just outside San Francisco bay, compared to last years store bought container crab this years should be delicious!!!  MMMmmm  I can't wait to have this again even if my beloved Forty Niners didn't make the superbowl.  Go Manning and Denver. No way I can root for Seattle sea peasants  :)  

Thanks for the recipe Chef John you are "the" man

I made this recipe for a New Years Eve party I attended. I followed this recipe exactly and found the recipe perfect. By midnight there was none left except the bread bowel which was going to be enjoyed the next day. I wish I could have found a gluten-free bread to make this in so I could have enjoyed the best part!!!Only thing I couldn't do was discard the top and inside of the bread...great for dipping/spreading...even if I couldn't. I was tempted to add more garlic, tarragon, or green onions...glad I didn't. Perfect blend!! Thanks you, Chef John, this recipe was perfect and appreciated by all!

It is a wonderful recipe!!!!  First of all THANK YOU Chef John!!!  I twisted my recepie by adding season artichoke hearts, in addition to the cheddar I added parmesan on the top to give it a some crunch, and if you can not find tarragon use dill it works great with this recipe. Try it with parmesan crusted baggets too.  This is an OMG recipe!!!  Sorry, I couldn't even get a chance to take apicture of it, no one gave me time, oh well next time.

This recipe was sooo good. I purchased some live crabs from The Wharf as we Washingtonians call it, had them steamed and pulled the crab meat from them. I used garlic powder as that was all I had, I added one cup of grated Parmesan cheese and instead of just plain white cheddar I used Kraft four cheese ,
Mexican. THANKS A MILLION CHEF!!

not sure if people were using quality ingredients when they said "bland". good cheese, real fresh herbs and veggies, and actual lump crab meat (not imitation) it turned out fantastic. i used a stand mixer to get a good consistent mix for the combining step.

I thought it was quite good. I had a couple of minor changes including  increasing the amount of red pepper used.... I just kept adding until i could taste just a little heat. Also substituted artichoke hearts instead of the bottoms.

I loved all the flavors that go in to this dish.  I used some crabmeat that I got from Costco, and we all thought it was quite fishy tasting, so that kind of ruined what I know would be a perfect dish!  That didn't really stop us from eating it, however.  I love using the artichoke bottoms rather than the quarters that most recipes call for.  Thanks again, Chef!

I made this with a few minor changes - I only used 1 tsp tarragon, 2 cans of lump crab meat, and artichoke hearts but only used the bottom halves that are more soft.  I was able to find white sharp cheddar cheese.  Everyone LOVED this dip.  I didn't make it in a bread bowl though and served with triscuit thins.

Delicious! I did put in some grated parmesan cheese and I only made half the recipe because I am only having 4 guest including me! It just ate a sample oh it's so good! I will always make this recipe I live on the coast and everyone loves to go trapping crab. So I always have fresh ingredients but I use canned crab if I have to.

It was very tasty, but the cheese on top made a crust and blocked the heat from getting to the dip. If I kept it in the oven longer, the cheese on top would have burnt. Next time, I would add the cheese towards the end. Also, I would use this dip as a filling for crab rangoons.

I made this for Thanksgiving today. The only things I did differently were that I had no fresh tarragon and used dried, and that I halved the recipe.

Despite soaking my lump crab in milk (the way I would liver--which I also made today!), I would not say it had a "fishy" taste but the crab taste was very, very overpowering.

So my biggest recommendation is to use FRESH crab and cook it yourself when making this recipe. It was okay. Not great. I blame it on the lump crab.

I won't make this recipe unless I get an ingredient list that doesn't leave anything out. There is supposed to be some amount of cayenne pepper mixed into this dip, but it isn't listed. There is a pinch of cayenne listed which you sprinkle on top, but the video shows a good amount being used before mixing the dip and the directions also say to add it. Anybody out there know how much I should use? I'd love to make this, but want it to be great.

I made this for the holidays.  All I can say is AMAZING.  I did use real crabmeat... and I doubled the amount.  Also I sautéed the onions with some of the butter prior to adding.  The smell was wonderful.  Will definitely make again.

I'm from Maryland and jump at a good, creamy crab dip! All I could taste in this one was the lemon, everyone agreed. The remainders sit in my freezer, awaiting a citrus loving friend or the trash! Chef John's prime rib recipe is fabulous though

Made this with fresh jumbo lump crabmeat and it was delicious! Everyone loved it. It made so much I had to freeze half of the recipe. But you must use real crabmeat and must be jumbo!

Not bad. Too much lemon. Could not taste the artichokes at all. With some changes, I would make again.

This was amazing! Very simple recipe and easy to follow directions. I used the mini bowls which allow for more than one setting. I also used fresh artichoke and crab, and added spinach. Looks like a found a new addition to Super Bowl snacks!

Made it, but reduced the cream cheese to half a pound. Turned out to be spectacular.

I followed this recipe EXACTLY as stated and I thought it was amazing. It was for a holiday party and people commented that it was "too seafood-y tasting" which actually I enjoyed. Will definitely make again.
