If your bread is too dense try beating the batter longer next time. In the original recipe It stated to beat for 5 min. I know this seems extreme, but it will help. This helps whip more air into it. When Allrecipes listed this recipe they modified it.  Patricia Bergstrom

since it's impossible just to follow a recipe ( and believe me, this cornbread is as good as gold when you do the original ), here are a few variations on the theme which jazzed it up for my picky crew: switch ingredient amounts between the cornmeal and flour; let the milk/cornmeal mixture sit for 10 minutes or so and whisk it a few times; use half white and half light brown sugar; mix the whole batch for at least 5 min. on low speed; bake in a glass pyrex and reduce oven temp by 25 degrees.  then soften some butter in the microwave, mix with honey and a pinch of salt ( to taste ) and slather this righteous bread with that spread.

If you try this cornbread, with a few suggestions, you will never make another cornbread recipe.  I rated Grandmothers Buttermilk Cornbread from this site as the best ever, but this surpasses that one by a long shot!  It is very important though to read reviews where the submitter of the recipe says to beat the entire concoction for at least 5 minutes before dumping it into the pan to cook.  I must admit, I was very skeptical - every bread recipe in the world talks about not over-mixing.  But I couldn't find my staple recipe and feeling adventurous, I gave it a try.  So glad that I did!  What I did was 1) Half the recipe and only use 1/4 c sugar instead of 1/3 c. 2) While the milk/cornbread mixture is sitting for 5 minutes, give it a good whip with a whisk 5-6 times, 3) Beat the entire concoction at least 5 minutes (and set a timer) before dumping in the pan, 4) Put about 2 TBL butter in a 10" cast iron skillet to melt in your 400 degree oven for about 5 minutes while you are beating the mixture then take it out and pour in the cornbread mixture (believe me - this will make all the difference in the world - it is very important to cook it with a cast iron skillet) 5) Only bake it for 20 minutes!  This will yield you the most fluffy, corny, airy, moist, slightly sweet but not to powerful to go with anything, piece of cornbread heaven in the world!!!  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe!!  It is my staple from now on - I am not even looking for another!

I made this for a big gathering this past Sunday.  I made it to go along with both a white chili and a regular beef chili.  It was awesome!!! Note that I did make the suggested changes below: I used 2 cups cornmeal and 1-1/2 flour; I soaked the cornmeal for 10 minute; I added 1 full cup of sugar and I baked it at 375.  It was wonderful.  This one's a keeper!  Thanks y'all!

This was my first time making cornbread from scratch, and it turned out great!!  I followed the advice to whisk the mixture for 5 minutes before pouring it in the muffin pan, and there were no problems.  I lowered the cooking time to 25 minutes since we chose to make muffins.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This went over very well at dinner. I think my only issue was the corn bread taste wasn't very strong. It was very light compared to others I've tasted and I tend to like very strong flavored cornbread. However, if you're into a lighter cornbread, you'll probably really like this recipe.

I'm afraid this corn bread recipe is nothing at all like a 5 star recipe.  It was dry and tasteless.  I followed the recipe exactly, used fresh ingredients, and even left it in the oven a bit less than the time called for.  I regret making it for company.  :-(

My husband and I have made this recipe several times and we love it.  This is a sweet, dense cornbread, but I find that it's sweetness is a good complement to a spicy chili.  It keeps fairly well, but any cut edges will dry out quickly -- however, since the bread is dense, it will still be moist just beyond the cut edge. Only cut off as much as you plan to eat at a time.  We also like this at breakfast with a little molasses.

It wasn't bad, it wasn't great, it was just so-so. The flavor was very light although the bread was of average weight for corn bread. Not sure what to say- wasn't sweet, wasn't corn flavored, wasn't buttery, wasn't much of anything...

After the previous reviews I expected something spectacular, so I was a bit dissapointed.  Good, but would not rush to make it again.

Excellent recipe!  Very moist.  Used honey instead of sugar, otherwise kept everything else as written.  Baked in muffin pan for 27 minutes, until muffin tops were golden brown.

I've been looking for this recipe for 30 years -- this cornbread was amazing!  I'm not sure why some people said it didn't have a lot of "corn" taste, as I thought it was perfect.  It is a heavy, sweet, cornbread, so if you're looking for light and fluffy "old-fashioned" (dry) cornbread this may not be what you're looking for.  I threw in a can of (drained) Niblets corn, and per other reviewers, adjusted the corn meal and flour to 1-3/4 Cups each, and it was the recipe I've always wanted.  My husband isn't a big cornbread fan, and he couldn't stop eating it.  I served with the "White Bean 'n' Ham Soup" on this site, and it was a perfect meal.

I run a cafe that serves comfort food, including three soups a day. When I wanted to try cornbread with my chili one day i tried this recipe. It was such a hit that I make it to serve as an option to buns every day. The customer response has been terrific. I have substituted portions of whipping cream when I've needed to use it. I double the recipe and pour it into two lasagna pans. It stores well in a plastic box and I stick it under the flame for a few seconds to crisp up for serving. Awesome!

I made half of this recipe as muffins (12 regular) and baked for about 15 minutes.  I also used melted butter instead of oil.  I liked the more cake-like texture as I don't care for the more gritty taste of the corn meal.
**I just tried using honey in place of the sugar. . .I don't recommend this.  The cornbread is soft and almost chewy.  I'll stick to using sugar as the recipe turned out great that way.

This is a great recipe.  DO NOT skip soaking the meal in the milk.  Also, DO stir by hand for five minutes after all the ingredients are combined.    I made this to go with my husband's chili.  He doesn't like cornbread because it's "tasteless and boring" and he ate 3 pieces!  He was also miffed that this cornbread overshadowed his chili.  Everyone at the table loved it.   Excellent.  It's in my recipe box now.

My family LOVED this cornbread.  I did add a small can of drained, diced jalapenos and some shredded cheddar.  This is a great recipe to customize, and will be my staple cornbread from now on.  Thanks for sharing!

I baked this two weeks ago and it was rubbery as stated by some reviewers.  After some thought, I realized that I had old baking powder.  I baked it again with new baking powder and it was five star, just like my grandmother's.  Bakers should make sure that their baking powder is fresh

This cornbread is great! My husband doesn't like cornbread because it always seems gritty and heavy. This bread was perfect, a nice light corn taste,not to sweet and very light and moist. I can't wait to eat my lunch (Yay! leftovers). Perfect with the slow cooker taco soup on the website.

This is a simple and delicious cornbread.  If you do not like sweet cornbread scale the sugar back a bit.  I however do.  I kept it as is.  I love it.

The best cornbread I have ever made.  Next time I'll decrease the sugar to 1/2 cup though -- it was a little too sweet.  Moist and cakey.

I just read some of the reviews on this that said that they didn't like it and that they said it was tasteless and one said it was DRY!!!  You had to have done something wrong.  I have been making this for 2 yrs now and it is the best D*** corn bread we have ever tasted.  My Mother is from the South and my Father from the North, and they both say that it's the best they have ever had.  I am a very accomplished cook and know what good food is and have quite an sophisticated pallet for food.  If you have read the other reviews that said that it wasn't good, DON'T listen to them.  If you follow the recipe right, you won't be disappointed.  One thing I do though, is measure the corn meal in a measuring bowl ( such as Pampered Chef) and them pour said amount of milk into the bowl, whisk it together and let it sit.  When it settles, it might measure less, but don't worry about it, it'll be fine.  It measures less for me and I get told how great it is.  Thank you so much for this recipe! :D I hope you enjoy it.

This was the best cornbread. My husband and I like cornbread that is just a little sweet. This was perfect. It was very moist and held together perfect.

This recipe GREAT.  Easy, fast and ALWAYS turns out perfect.  I have a business where I cook meals @ home to sell to families and I have used this recipe over and over...raving reviews.  Also as a manager of a bed and breakfast I served it with Chicken & Dumplings for dinner, slam dunk every time.  ONE minor adjustment, when it says "grease the pan", I put in 1/2 stick of butter in the pan, place the pan in the oven to melt the butter. When all the butter is melted, I pour in the batter.  Gives the edges a crispy, buttery taste.  To die for!

This was the best recipe for cornbread I have ever tasted!  No more boxed cornbread for me.  It is very very moist and dosen't crumble like most cornbread.  (If I could I would give it ten stars!)Thank you Patricia for such a wonderful recipe!

This cornbread is not dry in the least.  I bake it in a cast iron skillet and get a really crisp crust on it and the inside stays moist.  Excellent reheated.

Easy and delicious.  Reduced sugar to 1/2 cup.  I like to sprinkle paprika on top for a little color.  I generally serve 1/3 with dinner (usually chili) and freeze 2/3 of the bread in a plastic freezer bag.  This helps control our carb intake (yum!).  The other 2/3 of the cornbread can be thawed for other meals.  I like to slice it into cubes and toast it in the oven to accompany stews, chili, salads as a hearty crouton.

I just made this and it turned out perfectly! I must admit, I made several adjustments based on everyone's comments, so my 5-star rating is a bit skewed. I increased the cornmeal to 2 cups, reduced milk to just over 2 cups, reduced flour to 1 1/2 cups, increased sugar to approx 3/4 cup, and reduced oil to a bit less than 1/2 cup. It cooked pretty quickly in my oven - only about 20 min and it was done. We lived in Montreal in the 70's and used to by these things called Corn Toasties from the grocery store (so good with melted butter!). This flavour & consistency is the closest I can remember to how those tasted.

This cornbread recipe is hte best I have gotten off of the net.  It is quick and easy, but best of all it is DELICIOUS!!!  It has a subtle sweetness to it also.  The only modification I would make is to possibly add corn.  It is great without it though.  I highly recommend this recipe.

UMMM!  Word to the wise: soak the corn meal for about 15 minutes - no more or the bread will be too dense and raw or doughy in the middle as one baker commented.  I added a tablespoon of vinegar to the milk for that buttermilk effect. Tnis is one of the very best corn breads I've ever served - a hint of crisp on the outside and just perfect crumb on the inside... Thanks for sharing!

Had to make this after seeing all the 5 star reviews and it is indeed very delicious! The batter was very runny when I poured it into the Pam-sprayed pan, but that is how it looks because it turned out just fine. Absolutely scrumptious hot with butter and honey!

I don't know what makes a corn bread worthy of 5 stars, but to me this corn bread just wasn't that special. I followed the recipe exactly and it wasn't all that moist. It was OKAY. I probably won't make this again.

Great and easy to make.  Quite moist and flakey.  One thing though is that it was a little to consistent in texture, not like some cornbreads that have a grainier texture - perhaps due to the cornmeal I used (stoned ground yellow cornmeal).

This corn bread is amazing! I like to substitute one of the cups of milk with a cup of yogurt. It makes it that much more moist and rich. I really like using a thick product like greek or icelandic yogurt to make it more decadent.

I have made this twice, and this cornbread came out delicious!  I soaked the cornmeal a bit longer than recommended, about 10-15 mins.

I mixed for between 5 and 10 minutes.

The first time I didn't soak or mix as long, and it came out a little too dense.  The second time, with those changes, it came out PERFECT!

This is a delicious, tender, sweet cornbread.  I made it into muffins and used freshly ground corn.  They came out perfect...a little crispy on the outside and tender and moist on the inside.  They are lighter in texture than other cornbread muffins I have tried.

Excellent results.  This is the first recipe that I've seen where you soak the corn meal, but it makes perfect sense.  I baked it in a cast iron skillet and it rose beautifully.  It was sweet and moist - perfect with the stew.  I think it could easily be converted into Mexican cornbread with the addition of a few ingredients.

My search for a moist cornbread is over-this was dense and tasty, not dry at all. I did use less sugar, I'm from TN and we don't make sweet cornbread. Otherwise, perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

I've been using this recipe for several years and it's still the best.  Always moist and fluffy and enough to feed all six of us.  I preheat the Pyrex pan with butter as this helps with moistness and sticking, though it's fine without this step.

I made this strictly according to the recipe. It turned out to be the best cornbread I have ever eaten and to give further credit, it was the first time I had ever attempted to make cornbread, so that should tell you how easy it is.

Delicious!  I added about 3/4 cup of freshly cooked corn to the batter at the end, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I let the cornmeal mixture sit for about 10 minutes, but I don't know why I would otherwise get a huge air pocket in the middle while baking.  Great recipe though!

I made this last night for a soup supper (green chile stew + ham and bean soup) and it was a big H-I-T.  I think I would like a different ratio of meal/flour, more cornmeal, but everyone loved it as is!

I also expected something great after all the good reviews. I followed the recipe exactly, including the sit time and the whisking for five minutes. It turned out awful. The flavor was okay, but the texture was terrible. Instead of being "moist" cornbread texture, it was gloppy and sticky, more like corn pudding than cornbread.

Best cornbread I've ever had! I did use half whole wheat flour and half all-purpose - which is normal for me when I bake.  Also, I did cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup.  The first time I made this I baked it 30 min. at 350 by accident - it turned out good, but I baked it at 400 for almost 30 min. the second time and I think that was better.  Soaking the cornmeal makes a huge difference in the texture - I ended up soaking mine for 45 minutes while preparing other food for the meal, but 5 minutes should work just as well. I served this with baked Ham, then we had the leftovers (because it make a lot!) for breakfast the next morning. Very very good recipe!

This is by far the BEST cornbread I have ever eaten.  It is very moist with the perfect amount of sugar.  I have a huge sweet tooth but my husband doesn't - and we both loved this cornbread.  I have never written a comment on this site - but I felt that this recipe deserved it.  If you are like me and have never liked cornbread because it is too dry and bland then you will LOVE this cornbread.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.

This was pretty good, although it didn't blow me away like I thought it would. I did take others suggestion and added an extra 1/2 cup of cornmeal and reduce the flour by 1/2 cup, not sure if it affected the overall taste. I like my cornbread sweeter and the bread was moist (like a cake);  I like mine drier.  I'll keep searching.

Good, but I am still searching for the perfect cornbread.  I like it a little sweet.  Also, try serving it with honey butter.  Just mix some honey with regular butter until smooth - yum

This really is the best corn bread recipe I have ever used. I was recently laid-off from my job, so when I ran out of milk and couldn't buy any more, I substituted water for the milk, and the bread turned out just as good. A personal tip for the bread- I like to lightly sprinkle sugar on the top of the batter just before baking. Makes the top crunchy and tasty.

This is super cornbread. Making it with Italian grind polenta gives it a great texture. I also pre-heat a cast iron pan in the oven, melting some butter in the bottom; then pouring the batter in - SUPER crust that way.

I only gave it 4 stars since I did make changes.  I swapped the flour and cornmeal requirements since I wanted a bit more 'corn' taste.  I also added 1 tsp vanilla since that is what I've tasted in the corn breads I like best.  I also dropped the bake temp to 375 deg. for 25 minutes and still ended up with a 'crust' on the bottom and sides but a light moist cornbread.

I did not 'over' stir for 5 minutes as so many have suggested, as  this is how gluten develops.  Muffins and cornbread should be stirred only long enough to get all the ingredients stirred in and may even have a few lumps.

This is not as dense as a pound cake but it's not as fragile as many cornbreads.  It would hold up well to bean dishes or chili.

I usually make the 'Grandma's' recipe but decided to try this one because it didn't call for buttermilk.  It was not a successful tria. and I ended up dumping the entire batch.  I did take away the technique of soaking the cornmeal in the buttermilk, which I did in Grandma's recipe.  It came out more delicious.  Thanks for the tip.  
To anyone making this recipe I would definitely advise against using so much flour (maybe 1 - 1 1/2 cups) and over mixing.  I'd mix it by hand until just blended.  I followed the instructions and it came out dense but in a doughy way and flavorless.

This is my go to cornbread recipe with a couple of modifications.

I use less sugar most of the time - usually 1/4 cup.  And I always substitute 1 stick of melted butter for the oil.  Occasionally I'll add some frozen corn and green chilies and maybe some cooked breakfast sausage.

To save time, I've started just mixing as I would any other quick bread, mixing dry ingredients and adding wet ingredients, skipping the soaking.  There is probably a difference but we like it fine that way and I like saving those few minutes.

I use a somewhat coarse cornmeal but the bread still has a soft texture.

My husband said the other day that he used to enjoy the box mixes that he always made before we were married but that the cornbread I make now ruined those forever :)

People on here rating low need to check to make sure they followed the recipe exactly and read the 1st comment which was by the author.  Allrecipes edited out the very important step of beating the mixture for 5 minutes.    This recipe is amazing.  It is the sweetest, most dense cornbread recipe I have found.  I don't change the recipe one bit unless making it specially for something in particular.  If I'm serving with chili, I add a bit more sugar to complement the chili.  Sometimes I add corn to it to add the taste, but this recipe exactly as written is fantastic!!!  Just be sure to follow the directions and amounts exactly, especially the first time you make it.  If it turns out dry or anything, you did something wrong.

This is my favorite recipe for the style cornbread that "I" like.  It's cake-like and sweet.  My DH, on the other hand, likes it non-sweet and little to no flour in his.  The battle rages on and neither of us is yielding a lick!

All Recipes has two fantastic cornbreads, this one and Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread.  Both are super and if you don't have buttermilk, make this one. Don't overmix. I do like a can of drained corn niblets in the bread.  I mix the dry ingredients ahead of time and then fold it together, pop in the oven, and have a fresh hot cornbread to serve with a salad dinner or soup.

This is my favorite cornbread!  It is sweet and moist.  I use it as a side for nearly everything!  Occasionally, I'll decrease the milk by 1/2 cup and add 1 cup creamed corn.  I made stuffed cornbread (with chili and cheese in the middle) and both my DS and DH scarfed it down and asked for seconds.

Never given a bad review before, and I wonder if I somehow did something wrong, but no. I followed this to a tee. The Cornbread turned out heavy and uncooked, back into the oven for more than what ended up to be twice the cooking time, still just a big pan full of heavy wet dough.

I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8x8 pan.

Nice texture, grainy and interesting.  The flavor is a little bland, probably not as sweet as the average person is used to (albeit more authentic as is).

Loved this. Made this recipe with the exact ingredients, but let the batter rest for 30 minutes and used muffin tins. Very moist and full of flavor, sweet but not overly sweet - just perfect and easy to boot. Will definitely make this again.

I've never had cornbread this moist!  I followed the recipe to a T and it came out perfect.  I agree with others, the trick to it being so moist is to soak the cornmeal for atleast 5 minutes.  Not a very sweet recipe, but I'm sure you could change the sugar to 1 c. if you wanted it a little sweeter.  Very good!!

I made muffins instead of a loaf - very good.  Cooking time was about half.

I have made this several times and it is the only cornbread recipe that I have tried that gets raves from my children.  They beg for me to make this and absolutely love it.  Thank you so much for a recipe that makes my picky eaters HAPPY!!

This is a very good recipe.  It's very moist.  I used only a 1/2 cup of sugar which made it was just the perfect light sweetness that I like in my cornbread. Great recipe!

I scaled this down to 7.5 servings and baked it in a 9x9 pan, which was more than enough for 2 people. I added about 1/2 cup thawed frozen corn. To store, I put the leftover cornbread, pan and all, in a gallon-sized ziploc bag. Stays good even after a few days! *****

Good basic cornbread recipe. Substituted soy milk and came out just fine. Might up the sugar by 1/4 cup next time for a slightly sweeter flavor.

While I don't doubt this is from her mother in law in Canada, it is just the recipe from the back of the Purity cornmeal bag (the most common brand of cornmeal here in Canada). The only thing different is this recipe uses half the baking powder stated on the bag, and it says to leave it soak for 10 minutes.

I use this recipe (with the extra baking powder) all the time, and usually buy my cornmeal bulk, so I refer to this site to get the recipe. I always half the recipe to make 12 cornmeal muffins or 2 mini loaves, since it doesn't really keep. 

Also, you can substitute almond or soy milk just fine in this recipe, and add a lot less sugar or use honey if you want, or whole wheat flour works fine too.

I made this to go with my chili for Super Bowl. Everyone loved it! I made it using the recipe ingredients exactly as written. I did mix all wet ingredients together(after the 5 min. cornmeal soak) before I incorporated it into the dry ingredients. The result was rich, flavorful cornbread with an every so slight sweetness. This is the only recipe for cornbread I use now.

My husband made this at my recommendation. The flavor was passable but it was a bit gummy in the middle and not very fluffy. Need to read other reviews to figure out what makes it "perk" up.

I normally do another cornbread recipe on here, which is so moist, it's almost like a dessert. I was looking for something that was a little dryer and pair better with chili. This fit the bill perfectly. I also cut up the leftovers & made it as the base of a breakfast casserole the next day. Very tasty.

I chose this recipe for the great reviews, lower sodium content and because it uses oil instead of butter.  Due to health concerns, I omitted the salt and substituted light olive oil for the corn oil. I also reduced the sugar to 1/4 c sugar and 1/4 c splenda.  It made 22 medium sized muffins which I baked for 20 minutes.  They were golden brown and yummy.  I decided on muffins because they freeze better.

This is good! Maybe I like this because I am from Canada, where the recipe originated from :) Little bit sweet I thought at first, but it actually goes really well with my pork chili. I added about 2 tsp lemon juice because I like my cornbread with a slight lemon-y taste, and it is great. Found that the temperature was maybe too high, as the edges got quite browned and crunchy quickly. Will experiment with temperatures and bake times next time.

I really thought this recipe made a great starting point, but like many other people I made some alterations:

I HALVED the recipe, so this will explain my measurements:

I used 3/4 cup of flour instead of 1 cup, and 1 cup of cornmeal instead of 3/4 cup. Basically put, I switched the cornmeal and flour measurements. I also used CORN GRITS instead of cornmeal because I love the texture.

I used buttermilk instead of milk. And I let the milk and cornmeal sit for about 10 minutes, together.

I also defrosted about 1/2 cup of frozen corn and mushed it up a little bit to bring out the juices and mash the kernels so they aren't so big.

Another person suggested cream corn - great idea! Just make sure to reduce the milk by a little bit if you are going to use cream corn.

I used brown sugar instead of white sugar, I used butter instead of oil, and I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour.

I baked them in muffin tins for about 20 or so minutes. Delicious! They didn't even need butter or anything. Perfect as is. :)

This is great.  My husband has been bugging me for 'good' cornbread for ages, and know I've found it!  I made it exactly as written the first and it was excellent.  The second time I had no corn meal so I subbed polenta, plus I wanted it to be gluten free (earthquake victims asking for GF donations) so I subbed GF baking mix for the flour baking powder and salt -- it was perfect.  Husband said it didn't taste any different!

Excellent cornbread - definitely the best recipe I've found so far. I used a 9 inch glass pie plate and it came out perfect, and stayed moist for several days (I left it in the pie plate and cut wedges as needed). I think it would work really well in muffin tins, will try that next time.

Awesome recipe, customized it for gluten free -

Used Featherlight GF flour mix instead of All Purpose, almond milk instead of milk, egg replacer and honey instead of sugar.  A little wet with the honey, so I'd probably cut down the amount of milk by a 1/2 cup next time but awesome!

I was dubious when I saw how much sugar was in this recipe. Even cutting the sugar to 1/3  cup it was WAY too sweet. more like a corn cake than cornbread. It was only fit for eating with buttermilk or as a dessert.

I cut the recipe in half, used part brown/part white sugar, and threw in some defrosted corn kernals.  I cooked it in a 9 inch round glass dish, and found that it didn't cook all the way through even after almost an hour.  We finally started dinner without it, and when we did get to it, it was still too wet in the middle.  And I agree with the reviewer who said it didn't taste sweet, didn't taste buttery...didn't really taste like much of ANYTHING.  Lots of people seem to like it, though, so I guess all I can say is to make sure you test it out before planning to serve it to guests.  I'm glad it was just my hubby and me tonight.  :-)

This was my first time ever making cornbread, and this recipe turned out GREAT.  I made it exactly to the recipe (which was SO EASY).  Cooking times were accurate and it turned out perfect.  I think I found my cornbread recipe... first try!

I swapped the cornmeal and flour amounts and upped the sugar to 1 cup as suggested and it was delicious.  Halved the recipe and baked it in a 8x8 for 22 minutes. Will definitely make it again.

This cornbread is very light and delicious.  My husband really liked it and ate 2 pieces - he usually is not too fond of my cornbread!  I, too, increased the cornmeal to 2 cups and decreased the flour to 1 1/2 cups as recommended by other reviewers.

AMAZING!!!  this is now my staple cornbread recipe!  i did what other reviewers said and swapped the amounts for the corn meal and flour, so 2 cups of corn meal and 1 1/2 cups of flour.  this is a fairly dense recipe and i even beat it for 2 mins, but this is how we like it.  other recipes are too cakey and dessert-like, and this one tastes like it was made to go with chili... YUM!

If you soak the cornmeal for 15 minutes you get an excellent, almost chewy textured crust, never crumbly.  Uuuum good cornbread.

Loved it! Sweet & moist... a cake-like cornbread. A perfect compliment to smokey ham hocks & beans. My husband went back for seconds, which he never does for dry, Jiffy-style cornbread. Delicious leftover, we both had a big slice with butter for breakfast. Next time I will take others' advise and switch the flour and cornmeal amounts, just to see how it turns out. For more of a savory cornbread I will reduce the sugar by 1/2... YUM!

This was delicious! I've never made cornbread before, and this was easy! I made the recipe as suggested. I cooked it in a bacon coated cast iron skillet. Yummy! Thanks!

Substituted 2/3 cup honey for 2/3 cup sugar called for and substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil (SO MUCH better for your health with all that good saturated fat). Wowee this was so delicious, I'm throwing out my other cornbread recipes and keeping this one. Thank you!!

Super yummy! Just what I was looking for. I didn't bake mine for the full amount, so it turned out very moist. Next time I would add in creamed corn or corn to the batter.

I've made this recipe 20+ times and have passed it onto many others overseas.  ALWAYS a hit!!! I'm celiac, so I substitute gluten free flour with no problem.  If making for myself (and not a party) I often substitute plain yogurt for 1/2 the butter to make a bit more 'healthy'.  Freezes and reheats well, always gets rave reviews!

Delicious!! After reading other reviews I made the following changes: switched the cormeal/ flour amounts, let cornmeal soak 10 minutes, added a full cup of sugar, beat 5 minutes. I also drizzled a little honey on top before baking. It had lots of flavor and was light and moist. I'm going to bring it to a potluck BBQ and see what everyone else thinks!

My family did not like this recipe.  I made it exactly as written.  I usually do that the first time I make a recipe, then note what I will change the next time.  I am surprized at all the good reviews.  It was heavy, too sweet for our taste and did not have a corn taste at all.  I am in the South and this is not like any cornbread that I have ever had.  Sorry, I will not be making this again.  It just wasn't for us.

This is the best cornbread I have ever had anywhere (including all restaurants).  It is cake like without being dry, not too sweet and not to bland.  Excellent!  Thanks for sharing

ps:  Reducing the recipe using the "Servings" calculator worked just fine.

I really liked this recipe. I've made it twice now. The first time I did exactly as the instructions said. It came out perfect, but I found that after it cooled and the following day the cornbread was a bit crumbly. The second time I added 1/2 cup of plain yogurt and baked them in a muffin pan. The yogurt helped them stay moist even after they were cool and days later.

Super!  I put in a "heaping" TBS of baking soda just for a good rise.  And I cooked it as muffins in a muffin pan at 375 for 23 minutes with the leftover batter in a small bread pan.  Awesome.

I have cooked so many different cornbread recipes over the past few years.  Usually ending up just buying a mix.  Well, this recipe is wonderful and I will not have to buy any more mix.  I did not add all of the sugar because I was afraid that it would be too sweet and it was perfect.  Only added about half the sugar.  I think this would be good with all or none of the sugar!  Thanks!

A little on the bland side but liked the denseness.  Didn't crumble like some cornbread recipes.  The whole pan was eaten and my really picky 10 yr. old liked it best of all.  Go figure!

Throw out all of your other cornbread recipes, this one is a keeper!! I think that soaking the cornmeal is the trick. This cornbread cooks up moist and delicious! It actually prompted me to make a batch of chili just so that I could have another reason to keep eating it! YUM!

I'm eating left-over ham and beans right now. Thankfully, there's also a little Homesteader Cornbread left. It's gotta be the best cornbread I've ever tasted. Don't tell Grandma!

Great recipe, but it tastes better if you replace the milk with whipping cream and double the amount of sugar.

I have used this recipe again and again over the years, and everyone I serve it to LOVES it!  It is simple and tastes great!  I changed a couple of things due to my baking habits.  First, I use butter instead of Veggie oil.  Also, we like a little less sugar, so we use about a little less than what is recommended.  Overall, excellent recipe!

I'll try this one again. I was following one of the suggestions about cutting recipe in half. Mixed up great, but just when I thought I was ready to pour into the pan I notice I had forgotten to add the egg and oil. Crossed my fingers and added them mixing into the mixture well. Poured into iron skillet and put it in the oven starting out for 20 min. Had to leave it in for a few minutes longer. It never browned but looks and tastes good. Hoping next time I make it I get all the stuff in before mixing and not just when I'm ready to pour into the pan. Will make again.

great recipe, I modify it by using 1/2 coarse cornmeal and 1/2 fine which gives it a nice crunchy and still moist texture.

I love this! It is better than the boxed kind. This is so easy! I didn't have the specified pan, so I used two square pans and put them in for 25 - 30 minutes. They came out perfectly. I am so making this again!  :)

It's was excellent cornbread!  So moist and it didn't fall apart or crumble like other recipes.  My new favorite!  It's very important to follow the submitters instructions in the reviews to mix it for five minutes and don't forget to let the cornmeal soak... Excellent!!!

This is the best recipe for cornbread I have ever used. I can't ever follow a recipe exactly though so of course I tweeked it just a bit.  As others have mentioned I switched the measurements for the cornmeal and flour to 2 cups cornmeal and only a cup and a half of the flour.  I also whipped the cornmeal and milk quite a few times with a spatula while it soaked.  As for the dry ingredients I sifted them all together twice before adding the wet ingredients and I chose to use golden Cisco melted instead of oil.  I then cooked at 300F instead of 400F and the bread has turned out PERFECT every time!  Edges are golden yellow and just the right crispness and the center is nice and moist! Made this quite a few times already and not sure how anyone can say anything bad about it.  If they do, it's not the recipe, it's them!

This is my go to cornbread recipe for chili.  I use the following modifications: no sugar, buttermilk instead of regular milk and olive oil for vegetable oil.  I've made it by the book as well and while good, being from the south, I just can't abide by sweet cornbread.

It was good, but too much flour. If I make it again I'm going to follow other reviewer's suggestions and switch the flour and corn meal amounts.

I've tried many over the years, and this is the best! I recently learned that I am gluten intolerant, so I substituted gluten-free flour for the all-purpose flour, and the recipe is every bit as delicious.

I made this recipe because of all the 5 star ratings and the simplicity of the recipe.  I have to agree that it is 5 star worthy.  I made it in a loaf pan and added 1 cup shredded cheese and poco picante seasoning to give it some spicy kick (3 tbsp.).  I will make it again!

A good, basic cornbread recipe. A little dense, but it holds up well to beans. Good flavor, too; not too sweet. My changes (since no one can just follow a recipe as written): I substituted whole wheat flour for all-purpose, and olive oil for vegetable oil. I cut the amounts in half and baked it in a pre-heated 12-inch cast iron skillet that had been prepared with butter.

Very tasty cornbread, but mine did not look like the picture.  I was hoping for more of a crispy outside, but I mostly got a cake that had more of a bread texture.  Next time, I think I'll try a different pan or baking option to get more of a crust on it.

Just what I wanted!  I did take other reviewers suggestions and switched the cornmeal & flour amounts.  Then I poured the batter into a preheated iron skillet with a bit of melted shortening.  Was delicious with honey butter.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe fairly closely. I took the advice of some others and let the cornmeal and milk sit longer and I also stirred the whole mixture longer. I added mostly white sugar with some brown sugar and a bit of honey. It was moist and slightly sweet!  I also made muffins and baked it for about 22 min. and they were perfect!

A tasty cornbread, and not bad for my first attempt!  I cut the recipe in half as there were two of us.  My fiance is the self professed cornbread connoisseur, and he said it wasn't bad.  I didn't mind it myself, but found the bread somewhat grainy.  If making next time, I would likely soak the cornmeal a little longer.  Overall, not too bad!

Try this at 350 degrees, for only 30 minutes and if you really want something awesome, try mixing in corn grits(NOT regular grits) with the corn meal.  Any combination will do.  I've even tried all corn grits, and it still works.  It definitely adds some crunch to it, and the lower heat and less cooking time makes it SO moist!  Enjoy!

Absolutely delectable.  My family loves it!  Its a bit sweet, we cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup.  I also use 1/2 cup melted unsalted butter instead of veg oil and 1 cup ww flour, 1 cup white.

This is my all-time favourite cornbread recipe.  I've taken it to pot-lucks with many requests for a copy.  The only change I make is I like it to be slightly sweeter so I'll add closer to 3/4 cups sugar.  Definitely a keeper!

Very good recipe--I followed it almost exactly (with exception of baking at 375 degrees F and adding 2 tbsp. jalapeno peppers).  The cornbread rose beautifully and was soft and fluffy (not oily, greasy or too crumbly like other recipes I've tried).  Some reviewers spoke of the cornbread being dense/heavy, but I found it to be just the right (however, I let the cornmeal soak for 10 minutes, and I sifted the flour mixture before adding the oil and eggs).  The only drawback is that the cornbread was lacking in flavor, even when I added 2 tablespoons jalapeno pepper (seeded and chopped).  It also was not very sweet (but that's ok, as I like to add honey and butter when I eat it).  I will make this again but I will do as other reviewers suggested and switch the amounts for the flour and cornmeal (2 cups cornmeal and 1 1/2 cups flour) and perhaps reduce the baking powder to 2 1/2 teaspoons.  Also for more flavor, I will add a whole jalapeno (seeded and chopped) and 3/4 cup thawed frozen corn.  I think that this is a great foundation for cornbread that you can alternate it to your own personal tastes!

I did like many suggested and switched the amounts for the cornmeal and flour. I also reduced the sugar to scant 1/4 cup as I do not care for sweet cornbread. EDITED: For us, this was much better the next day re-heated a little in the microwave. It is slightly better than my go-to recipe!

Only changes made were the addition of half can of creamed corn and a handful of fresh chopped jalapeño.  Really good!  Very moist and dense with just the right amount of sweetness.  Great with chili.

I just took this out of the oven and had a slice.  Despite the drastic change I had to make, it came out surprisingly good. Found out I had no eggs, so had to make an egg substitute with flax seed. I think if I'd beat it on a higher speed it would have been much lighter.  Flavor is great, otherwise. It was just a little on the dense side. The 5 is because I know the recipe would have been perfect if I'd used real eggs

VERY EASY!  I kept telling my boyfriend "this seems deceptively easy" when I was mixing it together but I was pleasantly surprised when I got a gorgeous golden loaf of cornbread at the end!  I think this recipe is a great base to start from and could easily be tweeked to individual tastes.

Delicious!  Moist yet fluffy.  If you love sweet cornbread, this should be your go-to recipe!  I added a few dashes of nutmeg and Oh My!  Wonderful!

This cornbread was okay. I usually make the Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread from this site, but I didn't have all the ingredients that I needed. I would suggest using that recipe rather than this one.

Try using honey instead of sugar.  This makes for a very moist bread.

I've tried many different recipes and I finally found THE one. I made this tonight for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit! The cornbread was moist and delicious. 5 stars from the whole family!

I just made this and ate some hot from the oven, and it came out great! I followed the recipe as written, except there's no way my family could eat so much before it goes bad, so I halved the recipe and made it in a 9x9 square pyrex. I expected to have to really reduce the cooking time, but it still took a little over 30 minutes at 400 degrees. Great recipe!

Not as sweet as Jiffy cornbread, but it was moist and more true-tasting.  We loved it - especially slathered with butter and honey!

This was the first time I've ever made cornbread from scratch as I usually just buy the packaged stuff at the store.  I thought this was a great recipe and very easy to make.  My husband loves cornbread and he gave it two thumbs up.  The only real change I made was I swapped the amount of corn meal and flour as others had suggested and was sure to mix the batter for a good 5 minutes before pouring in pan.  This one is a keeper and part of my recipe collection.

Love this recipe.  I always add pepper and then whole kernel corn, too.  I buy the individual frozen servings and put pop them right in while I'm mixing.  Delish!!

Very good! I beat the mixture by hand for 5 minutes and still found it a bit on the dense side. Next time I will use an electric mixer. Very yummy and will make again for sure!

Loved it!  This is a very moist, tender cornbread.  Not crumbly like the recipe I've been using for years.  I didn't add the whole 1/2 cup of oil - more like 1/3 cup instead...  I might try upping the cornmeal more next time, but it was a great recipe as written.

Tasty, though I will make it sweeter next time. Good moisture. Might swap out some oil with applesauce to cut out fat...Don't think you'd taste the difference, and would add moisture, which is never bad in cornbread.

Majority ruled and it's a five star rating. However, as the cook ;), I think it was more like a 3 or 4. It is thick. I made it twice. Knocked it off the table the first time and shattered glass all over it. Man, I was frustrated by that move! First time I blended for 5 minutes. And the 2nd time I followed suggestions and beat for 10 minutes. It didn't make enough of a difference. I think it has an average flavor but tastes way better with maple syrup over top. It just wasn't the right fit for me.

I made this cornbread for a chili party with some minor changes and it was a huge hit.  I substituted 1/2 cup of sour cream for 1/2 cup of the milk; 1/3 cup of honey for 1/3 cup of the sugar; and butter for the vegetable oil.  Add 1 cup frozen, thawed sweet yellow corn.  I whisked all of the dry ingredients including cornmeal together and all of the liquid ingredients together.  Combined both and and let sit for 10 minutes.  I heated the ungreased pan in oven for 10 minutes, sprayed the hot pan with vegetable oil then poured batter into the hot pan.  My oven had preheated for about 20 minutes to insure that it was very hot and I baked the cornbread for a full 35 minutes.  The result was a crusty exterior with a moist, dense, sweet bread.

My teenage sons devoured nearly this entire pan in one sitting, delicious...after reading the reviews, I decided to use a classic technique to help improve the texture: let eggs come to room temp, separate, beat the whites until they form soft peaks, prepare recipe as directed gently folding in the egg whites last. This helps add volume (air) and can be used for any cake, quickbread, pancake etc. recipe.

Tried so many other cornbread recipes, and this is the best so far. Moist and sweet...nice with butter. I halved the recipe but used 1 cup cornmeal and 3/4 cup white flour instead. Also used both white and brown sugar. Whisked the batter for 5 minutes before pouring in the pan as advised by others. My oven cooked it in only 25 min at 375.

I made this recipe exactly according to the recipe (for once) and the end result was good.  Had I reviewed the recipe last night after we ate it for supper, it would have received 5 stars, but I waited until today and I'm glad I did.  While the bread was very good last night (still warm out of the oven), it was significantly dryer today (requiring a lot of butter to give it some moisture).  The texture of the bread was almost cake-like, but I suspect that's because I soaked the cornmeal in the milk for 5 minutes, but then I also whipped all the ingredients in my Kitchenaid mixer for another 4 or 5 minutes.  So I will likely make this again because the flavour was very good, but next time I won't mix it for quite as long.

Very light tasting and easy to make!  I halved the recipe, used an 8x8 glass pyrex, baked at 325 for 25 minutes.  I did only use 1/4 cup of sugar so my bread really didn't taste sweet.  I served this with the No Tomato Chili recipe.

This is my new cornbread recipe.  The only thing I changed was to substitute melted butter in place of the oil.  I thought it was great this way, but if you prefer a granier cornbread, I would switch the amounts of cornmeal and flour.

I just made this and it's the first time I felt compelled to sit right down and write a review. I followed the suggestions of others about beating the batter for longer, and this is the best cornbread I have ever eaten! I will make this recipe every time I make chili. And the honey butter on top is awesome.

This is such an awesome cornbread. Our church uses this recipe when we serve chili for special occasion dinners. We add white corn to the recipe. Bev who runs our kitchen gets teased that she picked this recipe because she is from Canada. Well you Canadians sure know how to make cornbread good!!!!  Thank you for the recipe.  I highly recommend it. Tina Fox - Lake Arrowhead, CA.

Yummy Cornbread. Not too sweet, not too salty! It was really great straight out of the oven with lashings of REAL butter spread on it (my idea of heaven!!!). I served this with Chilli Ricks from this site. Great combo!!!

This is by far the best cornbread I have ever eaten!  It is so moist that it doesn't even need butter.  I made it for my husband's family, and they didn't know that cornbread was not supposed to be dry.  They said it tasted like cake.  I will NEVER make another cornbread again.  Thanks a million!

When I owned a coffee house, I used to offer this cornbread with soup. It was so successful that people wanted to buy it without the soup. This bread almost seems to have a moist pudding like filling. The best I have ever had. Make sure you get cornmeal that is not enriched because I bought the enriched by mistake and it was pretty crumby. The cornmeal should be yellow with texture not like flour.

This cornbread recipe is the best one I've ever tried.   It is moist and cake-like with a hint of sweetness.  In the past two weeks every family with a new baby or an illness has received cornbread along with chicken and rice soup.  I've gotten great responses and now am sharing the recipe (and the website) with loads of friends.  Just don't forget to mix the batter for more than 5 minutes!  I've even put the 15 servings size recipe in an 8x8 pan, decreased the oven temperature to 350 degrees and left it in for twice as long.  It turns out great!  Thanks Patricia B. for sharing this recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and we were delighted with the results.  It was the best cornbread I've ever made.  My husband would have preferred it slightly sweeter but I found it to be perfect.  It was not too light or too dense and came out a lovely golden color.  There was enough for two meals and I was tempted to make it again for a third and fourth night.  I'll never use another recipe!

I made this about an hour ago to go with some chili I am making for dinner. I have been making cornbread the same way my whole life using a traditional southern recipe passed down through my family. So it was a big step for me to try making it another way. This is pretty good bread. My family nor I like sweet cornbread so I didn't use the amount of sugar called for. I have always wanted to make mexican cornbread. This seems like it would be the perfect recipe to use when making that, so next time I am going to add other ingredients for that. I'm not sure if I like this better than my usual cornbread, but it is a bit different and worth making again.

This recipe is great!  I have made it a few times and it turns out delicious and moist everytime.  For a change, this recipe is the perfect amount for 12 muffins as well.  I eat them for breakfast all the time.

This tastes great right out of the oven.  It's slightly sweet, and because I didn't soak the cornmeal in the milk for the whole 5 minutes, this cornbread has the firm texture similar to that of Cracker Barrel.  I shared some with a couple of friends, and they described it as tasting like Jiffy cornbread.  I used egg substitute and skim milk which did not detract from the flavor at all.  Also, I had to  halve the recipe (ran low on cornmeal) so I baked this in a loaf pan at 375F for 35 minutes.

Delicious! I was low on milk so I used 1 1/2 cups milk and one 14oz can of cream corn. I wasn't certain about switching the flour and cornmeal amounts so I compromised and used 1 3/4 cups of each. My sons, who detest anything even remotely related to corn, ate it up. My youngest even took a leftover piece to school for lunch. Definitely a recipe I will use time and time again.

I've been looking for a good cornbread recipe - most of the ones I've tried have been really dry, crumbly, and tasteless.  This one is great though, I will definitely be making it again.  I followed others' suggestions and let the cornmeal soak for 10 minutes rather than 5.  I also switched the flour and cornmeal measurements.  I had to make a couple of other adjustments as well - I only had 1 egg so I used it and 1/4 cup egg substitute.  I was also just shy with the vegetable oil so I added some olive oil to make up the difference.  I also added some fresh corn kernels.  I might add a tad more sugar next time to see how it tastes as I like my cornbread a bit on the sweet side.  Overall, VERY tasty cornbread recipe!

I took others' suggestions and switched the amounts of flour and cornmeal.  I also let the ingredients soak for 10 minutes, as suggested.  The result was a VERY moist and tasty cornbread, which was much better than any box mix.  My hubby would like it a little sweeter, so next time I will use a little more sugar. I still rate it 5/5 with my minor adjustments!

I too give this 5 stars! I took other reviewers' advice and switched the amounts of the corn meal and the flour (which I recommend), and after letting the milk and corn meal sit for 10 minutes, I mixed everything with my electric hand held mixer for 5 minutes. I then baked it on 375 in a 9 by 13 glass dish for 30 minutes, which was perfect....really kept it moist. It's the perfect consistency and doesn't fall apart at all. The only complaint I have is that I added too much sugar. I used the new Splenda baking product that is a blend of Splenda and sugar. Pay attention if you do this, as you need to cut your portions by half per instructions on the back of the bag! I didn't and the cornbread was way too sweet. Also, buttermilk was perfect with this. This is now my new cornbread recipe.

excellent! No more store bought mix! This is easy and has a wonderful taste and texture! Sweet and delicious! Served with spicy vegetarian chili and now, one week later using the remainder in a cornbread salad. Has a pretty color when done! Company raved about it! I made no changes to this fine recipe. Try it the Tidewater VA way- with a little maple sauce poured on top. Thank you.

This cornbread tastes good and is easy to make.  Goodbye Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix!

It has become a staple in our house.  I usually cut my recipe in half and baked it in a cast iron skillet.

[Scaled half-recipe ingredients:
3/4 cup cornmeal
1 1/4 cups milk
1 cup flour
1/2 tablespoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup white sugar
1 egg
1/4 cup vegetable oil]

**update:
I originally rated this recipe back in 2004.  I'm back in 2016 with an update:

I have never made jalapeno cornbread, but I tried it using half of this recipe, folding in 2 diced jalapeno peppers after mixing everything else together.  It was awesome, and now I am a cornbread rock star!

This was excellent!  I add fresh roasted green chili peppers, chopped, to this recipe when I make it for a pot of beans.  I also use it as the 'base' for Mexican cornbread.  I suggest, use this recipe as is or as a 'basic' and let your imagination loose.

Mmmmm mmmmm good!  I grew up hating cornbread.  My family never made it, and all I knew about cornbread was what we received with our school lunch.  Yuk!  But this one is quite nice . . . not gritty, not too sweet, doesn't fall apart, nice & moist . . . can't say enough.  Husband still doesn't care for cornbread (although he says this is better than others), so I wait until my folks are coming over to make this & they take half home.  They love it, too.  Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe.

I made this with the slow cooker taco soup and it was great. Everyone raved about it. The mixing for five minutes is the key to making it light and this was left out on allrecipes, I found it by reading other reviews. I will be making this over and over because my family really loved it.

This was the first time I made cornbread, and it turned out better than I had expected.  It had a good taste when warm.  However, it was extremely dense - rather like a brick, as another reviewer aptly put it.  It wasn't good the next day and sat in my stomach like lead.  The recipe makes a huge amount - I didn't want to scale down in case I messed it up but now half of it will be wasted.  I'm planning to try a different recipe next time.

Simply a fantastic and easy cornbread to make and eat!  I make this whenever I make chili...actually the "Chili IV" recipe (type that into search on this site) goes perfectly with this cornbread recipe.  This is now my new standard cornbread recipe!  Simple and delicious.  Prep time is 15 minutes if you're moving really slow...the oven isn't preheated when I finish mixing the few ingredients for this yummy bread!  It's about 5 minutes prep time...great for busy people.

Superb recipe! I added an 8-oz. can of drained corn and sprinkled the top with raw sugar as suggested by others. Great cornbread...great tips...great website! How'd I ever do any cooking before you guys came along?! Good thing I have unlimited internet access or I'd be broke.

Hands down, the best cornbread recipe I've ever tried. I usually make a buttermilk cornbread on this site. But I was out of butter so I searched for one with oil. I was also out of sweet milk (!) so I used my buttermilk and 1 1/2 tablespoons each of baking powder and baking soda to adjust.  Perfect!  But I think it will be just as good if all I have is regular milk.  Definitely my new cornbread recipe. It rose so high and was so light and delicious!!

It was excellent. I cut the recipe in half as there is only my daughter and I eating. I added some chopped raw jalapeno, cheese and 1 tblsp of sour cream. It was fluffy, moist and yummy with the chili. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This cornbread was delicious! I did have to bake it for quite a bit longer than it says in the recipe, but it still turned out fantastic!

Tried this for the first time tonight.  Switched the cornmeal and flour amounts, soaked the cornmeal in the milk for 10 mins, and whisked it for 5 mins before baking.  It hardly rose at all and the center is very doughy.  Will not make again.

I am from Texas where we love our cornbread and I have to say this is the BEST recipe I have ever made. I usually don't like my cornbread sweet, but this is not overly sweet and the sugar adds that little extra touch to make this recipe absolutely perfect! Thanks so much for sharing. I will never use another recipe!

Ok..I had EVERY intention to follow this recipe to the letter.  I thought it would go well with my split-pea soup.  What happened?  Star Trek happened.  One of my favorite episodes.  1. I used 3 cups of cornmeal.  2.  1 cup of (self-rising) flour.  I whisked the eggs, then 1/3 cup of sugar, salt, and I then I poured in, 4.  1 and 3/4 cup of milk that was about to sour, smelled edible to me. 5.  I heated up the oil in the pan I was using 6.  Then poured the liquid into the dry ingredients. 7.  I stirred about 2 minutes 8.  Then poured in the heated oil.  9.  I rushed through this hoping I could finish before my kid got home from school. 10. Then I realized that I should have read the entire recipe and stirred..oops mixed for 5 minutes at least to make it lighter.  Well forget that, it was on its way to bakersville. With time to spare as Kirk and crew got out of the Mirrorverse. The result??  Best freakin' cornbread I have ever made!!  Thank-you so very much!!!

This recipe is so bad that I became a member to rate it.  Dense, heavy, gooey block.  Browned on top and egdes, toothpick came out clean, but still a raw layer in between a wet, solid mass.  Inedible.  I did the extra beating recommended by reviews.

I made this gluten free by using 1 cup rice flour, 3/4 cup potato starch flour, 1/4 cup tapioca starch instead of the 2 cups of normal flour. (All other ingredients the same.) Worked like a charm. This bread was GREAT! Everyone went back for seconds on the bread. Next time I will double the salt.

Finally!  A cornbread recipe that tastes amazing!  It's the perfect mix of light / fluffy, moist, and the much looked for cornbread texture.  I'm done searching:  this is our cornbread recipe from now on.  I only made one change due to dietary needs.....I used plain rice milk instead of regular milk.  Thanks for sharing this fabulous recipe.

Great cornbread recipe!  I cook it in my cast iron skillet, and it turns out perfect every time.  Make sure that if you use cast iron, you oil it heavily (I use olive oil), and put it in the oven while it's preheating.  You never want to put a cold cast iron skillet in a hot oven!  And besides, it gives the cornbread a beautiful crust!!

I love this recipe!!! It is almost like a cake, very moist, very good tasting. What I did to change the recipe a bit was to put 1/3 cup white sugar and 1/3 cup of brown sugar instead of 2/3 cup of white sugar. I ended up letting the cornmeal and milk mixture sit for 15 minutes. Not on purpose!! I had something come up and when I got back to the recipe, it had been 15 minutes. After mixing all of the ingredients, I then added the eggs and oil at the very end. Don't know if this made a difference or not.
I will make this recipe again and again!!

I totally deficent at making cornbread! Which is weird because I am a great baker. But cornbread never turns out for me. I usually stick to the pkg. mix but everyonce in awhile I tried to make it from scratch. This one didn't work for me either...not the recipe's fault, mine. Here that sigh? Bottom hard, top sank. But I don't want to take away from the recipe's rating so I am going to give it 5

The first time I tried it I immediately tweeked it, but it was a great starter point as I do not bake much.  So all I did different was add a tablespoon of tumeric to the flour mixture, to add a bit of taste on that golden colour.  Also I added a pinch of chilli-pepper flakes.  In addition I added about 3 tablespoons of plain yogurt, and I mixed all together for a few minutes.  I aslo did as others have posted, 2 cups of cormeal and 1 1/2 cups of flour. Turned out awesome.... the kids loved it.

I thought this cornbread was very dense. I was looking for a fluffy cornbread type recipe and this one wasn't what I was looking for. The taste was fine, but I didn't care for the texture.

This recipe isn't bad, but it would take a few tweaks to get it to be my go-to cornbrean recipe.  I added 1 tsp vanilla, diced pickled jalapenos, corn kernals and shredded cheese, and it still was pretty bland.  I think if I ever made this again I would add more salt.  Again, not bad, just not much flavor, you need to add your flavor to this basic recipe.

I have been searching for a good cornbread recipe (not too dry, not too floury, with just the right amount of sweet) and I think this is it! Because I was short on a few staples, I ended up doing equal parts cornmeal and flour (1 3/4c. each). I also used 1/3c. white sugar and 1/3c. brown sugar.  Otherwise I made the recipe exactly as stated. I even beat the batter for 5 min. with a mixer as many posters recommended. Mine baked in a glass 13x9 inch pan at 400 for 30 min. and it was perfect. Absolutely delicious warm with butter.  I served it with the Zesty Slow Cooker Chicken Barbecue recipe from this site. Homesteader Cornbread is my new go-to cornbread recipe. Thanks!!!

Love love love this recipe...had this along with baked chicken for nephew's birthday dinner...
Generally add some molasses to my cornbread, but this one is just as the recipe is written, although I did double the recipe...very little leftovers!

I love this cornbread!  I used this recipe twice and it is my favorite version of cornbread.  It  turned out very moist and the perfect texture for me.  Maybe some cooks left their bread in the oven too long and it dried out.  Mine is restaurant quality and pairs well with the chili con carne recipe on this site.

Great recipe. I reversed the amounts of cornmeal and flour but otherwise I didn't change a thing. Make sure you let the cornmeal soak a good 5-10 min and when beating the mixture work plenty of air into it for a nice fluffy cornbread that isn't too dense.

This was excellent cornbread, and not too dry.  I did make a change however, I substituted 1/3 cup of honey and 1/3 cup white sugar instead, because I don't like using so much white sugar and I wanted the extra stickiness of the honey.  Add the honey last so that it doesn't lump up the batter.  Otherwise, I did everything the same and it was so delicious and easy.

Great recipe. I live in Colorado and didn't have any high-altitude baking issues. The only modification I made was reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup, bumping up the salt by a pinch, and substituting a 1/2 cup melted, unsalted butter instead of oil. To prevent clumping, I tempered the warm butter with some of the cooler batter separately, before adding it to the rest of the mix.

I made this exactly as the recipe called for. It was delicous, moist and gone in no time. My son visited for a few days, and I'm making it again for him to take home with him.. He loved it!!! Thank you for sharing.

I've never been a huge cornbread fan, but this one is excellent!!  I let the cornmeal & milk sit for 5-10 minutes, mixed everything by hand for 5 minutes as several people recommended, then I baked it at 375 for 30 minutes.  It came out light, fluffy, & perfect.

I made this to use in a cornbread stuffing. It worked ok for the stuffing, but as plain cornbread it was very bland and dry. I followed the recipe as written. Wouldn't make again.

Hmm, not something I'd make again.  These turned out very gluey.  Not the texture I expected or like from cornbread.  I usually use the recipe on the Albers Cornmeal - which I didn't have none hand  - so tried this one.  Sorry, not a fan.

This cornbread is delicious. I didn't have standard cornmeal (really hard to find in the UK), so I subbed in polenta. I made it into minimuffins. I think they're going to go over big at my Thanksgiving dinner!

---DENSE CORNBREAD--- I’ve read of some people baking very dense cornbreads. I don’t beat the batter for 5 min though (which apparently helps by incorporating air into the batter?) - I’m afraid that might make a chewy cornbread (since overbeating causes gluten from the flour to develop) which I’m not a fan of. I make sure to SIFT the flour into the measuring cup, to ensure I don’t take too much flour (which results in too dense cornbread). It’s best to weigh flour since it’s often packed to various densities when we store it, but if you’re lazy and would rather use cups (like me :) sifting the flour helps hugely. It works for me, so hopefully it helps someone else! :) ---ADD CORN--- If you want to add corn like I did, omit 1/4 cup of milk (since corn releases some water). When you’ve made the batter, mix in 2 cups of frozen corn coated in 2 tbsp flour (helps suspend the corn, I think). ---Other--- I find 1/2 cup sugar is plenty sweet. Great with chili, taco, or on its own. As other reviewers said, switching the amounts between the flour and cornmeal is good (though I don't mind keeping the original amounts), and use half white and half brown sugar. I halved the recipe and baked it in a 10” (I think) round glass pan in my toaster oven for 28-30min – lovely, moist cornbread. I've made the original recipe several times (5 stars!) and lately decided to experiment - very easy with this versatile recipe!

Flavor was there, but it was dense and not great.  I should have read the reviews first!  Didn't mix enough.. I will try again, but my first try was almost yuck..

This is an easy cornbread recipe that turns out great. I suppose I make quite a few changes, but that's out of personal preference. I'm sure the cornbread would be great as written as well. Here's my changes::: I don't eat eggs, so I use ener-g egg replacer instead. I replace most of the oil with unsweetened applesauce (fewer calories) and use raw turbinado sugar instead of granulated white sugar (raw will give a little more of a crunch to the top, which I prefer.) I use either skim milk or plain light soymilk for these, whichever I have on hand. & lastly I don't use a pan, I line a 12 count muffin tin and it's the perfect amount of mix for 12 muffins. This is now my go to cornbread recipe (with my preferred changes of course).

Made this for my southern family & they loved it.  

I used only about 5 teaspoons of sugar;  also used self rising flour, so left out the salt & baking powder.

Instead of a pan, I used a cast iron skillet, which I put just enough oil in the bottom of skillet to cover it completely, set it in the oven for about 5 minutes to heat the oil.
(Test if ready by flicking a few drops of water from your fingertips on oil, if it pops up oil is hot enough.)

Take out hot skillet and pour in mixture as recipe advises.  Cook as directed.  Bottom will come out nice and crusty with nice flavor.

Followed the recipe to the "T" and it was moist and delicious. Slightly sweet but not too sweet. I made half the pan into jalepeno cheddar cornbread by placing sliced fresh jalepenos on one half at the beginning of baking, then adding cheddar cheese for the last 5 minutes. This has made it into my go-to list.

This was a delicious recipe.  I did change it a bit.  I only used 1/4 cup non processed cane sugar and melted a cube of butter in a cast iron skillet then poured the batter in and baked.
The family loved it!

This is awesome!!  Did soak cornmeal for 10 min. in the milk, and after all ingredients where together beat for 5 min.  Product rose nicely even at 7860 ft elevation and cooked in a motor home micro - convection oven.  Husband raved and he doesn't care for cornbread!!!!

This is delicious! And quick, easy, and uses basic ingredients! I followed the recipe exactly (baked for 30 mins), and it turned out perfect. This does make a large pan-full, so unless you're sharing with lots of people, it may be best to half it. My only advice, as others have said, is to not skimp on the cornmeal soaking time. 5 minutes was fine for me, but don't do less or you might regret it!

First time to make cornbread from scratch and it was SO easy and SO worth it! The family loved it! (kids 5&10). My husband said it was the best he had ever had and kept commenting on how it wasn't grainy. A major plus!

Simple and seemingly decedent this is the cornbread my family wants!

Fantastic!  First time making cornbread for me.   I used 2C cornmeal, 1.5C flour, and Nutiva's Coconut Oil vs Veg Oil.  

My 9X13 was being used, so I baked it at 375 with a light gray cookie sheet. Came out dense, moist, and tasty!   

If you try the coconut oil, warm the milk to melt down the coconut oil first.

I made this recipe and used half whole wheat flour/unbleached white for my flour and have to use brown sugar/splenda because my husband and is diabetic.  Originally I was going to make corn bread from a book but wanted to calculate enough for 1 1/2 recipes and it tuned out that it needed 4 cups of milk and had already asked my husband to pick up buttermilk for me so I substituted it. I also substituted apple sauce for the oil which I routinely do. It turned out GREAT.

This is AMAZING. So moist and delicious. The only thing I changed is making the 2/3 cup sugar 1/3 cup of white and 1/3 cup brown. I've already made this several times.

I made several changes based on other reviews and my own tastes. First I too did 2 cups corn meal and 1.5 cups all purpose flour In addition I used only 1 cup of milk along with a can (about 1.5 cups) of cream corn. I then beat it for a minute or so with a hand mixer. Also I added a bit of lemon juice to that batter and finally I used butter instead of oil. The results...a very nice cornbread that I hope my guests will enjoy!

Basic recipe, delicious results. I made this to go alongside my homemade chili. The cornbread was tasty, just a bit moist and a touch sweet. I was very pleased with my first attempt at making cornbread (using this recipe). I gave the recipe 4 stars because it is not a gourmet recipe or anything but the simple goodness is worth every bite. I will be using it again.

A hit with picky eaters! I did not follow the recipe as listed here on the website. Instead I followed the suggestions of numerous cooks here: switched the cornmeal/flour ratios (2 c. cornmeal, 1 1/2 c. flour); soaked the cornmeal and milk for WELL more than 10 minutes (more like 20); did 1/3 white sugar, 1/3 brown sugar, which I packed, not sure if I was supposed to pack it or not; baked it at 375 degrees for 25 minutes in a 13x9" glass, Pyrex baking dish (electric stove).

Other changes I made: used almond milk instead of cow's milk and King Arthur whole wheat flour. Admittedly it did have a slight, wheat-y taste to it, but not bad. It came out delicious! I like sweet-ish cornbread and this was about the same as I would expect from the good ol' Jiffy box. This was my first attempt at cornbread from scratch and it was a winner!

One last note: I wonder if the low raters here measured their flour correctly? Not everyone knows how to measure flour (my mom taught me at a very young age). I spooned the flour into the measuring cup and then leveled it off with a knife, moving the straight edge of the knife across the top of the measuring cup back and forth until the flour was level. Of course any straight edge will work, I've just always used a knife. I imagine, if you measure the flour wrong that might make your cornbread taste real dry.

This was so good!  I did switch measurements for flour & cornmeal as did a lot of reviewers.  I also cut the recipe in half and baked in my 9" diameter cast iron skillet...it was gone within 30 minutes!!  Will make this often!!

I halved the recipe and cooked it in a preheated cast iron skillet that I greased with 2 Tbsps of unsalted butter.  Cooking this way created a very brown, cripsy crust with a moist center.  The recipe was wonderful, but  bit on the sweet side.  Next time I will put less sugar and a little more salt.  Thanks for such a great recipe!  I will definitely use this from now on!

This was good, but a little bland.  I did follow the recommendations of other reviewers and switched the measurements of the flour and corn meal.  I also cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup because I do not like sweet corn bread.  1/4 cup was more than enough.

Wowza! I followed other reviewer's suggestions ~~~ then watched the angles kiss the tongues of my guests.
Here's what I did:
1) Switched the flour ratios
2) Let cornmeal/milk mix stand 10 minutes
3) Used 1/3 C. white sugar & 1/3 light brown
4) Beat the batter for 5 minutes w/ a whip 
5) Added 1/2 can creamed corn 
6) Warmed & whisked together equal amounts of butter and honey, then drizzled on top of each slice.
7) Served with ham & bean soup ...but that's another story.

Definitely the best cornbread we've ever had.  Tastefully moist and rich with a nice corn flavor.  So often you can't taste the corn in cornbread, but it tastes wonderful in this recipe!  Rises beautifully!

The taste was fine, but it was a mediocre cornbread overall.  I beat it for quite a while to make it lighter, but it had a chewy texture.  I guess I'm looking for a different texture.

To make this less healthy and more delicious, I used whole milk and melted lard instead of oil. Man oh man, it was amazing in the cast-iron skillet. Thank for the recipe update too!

Keep finding excuses to make it!  Used 1/3c brown sugar and 1/3c white sugar.  Soaked cornmeal in milk while gathering everything together- approx 5 minutes.  After it was all mixed, I beat it in the mixer for 5 minutes.  Poured in a deep 9" pan and it kept together perfectly.  Delish.

We really liked this.  I used water and dry nonfat milk for one cup of the milk and it worked fine.  It was not dry at all which is a frequent problem with cornbread.  I might add a touch more sugar next time  but will definitely make this again!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Bread was fluffy and moist as promised.  We liked it but we didn't love it because it didn't taste "corny" enough for us.

I just took a pan of this delicious cornbread out of my oven and I can tell you this....it's wonderful!  A teensy-weensy corner seems to be missing.  *shrugs*  It's just me living here so I halved the recipe and baked it in an 8 x 8 pan.  I used the suggestion to swtich around the cornmeal and flour amounts but I have a feeling I could have left it as the original recipe was written because I used freshly stone-ground cornmeal from a store here in the Smoky Mountains. The cornbread has a nicely raised dome in the center, very moist, and a cake-like texture.  This will definately be the only cornbread recipe for me from now on.  (almost the whole row is gone now since I started this review....*embarrassed to admit that*)  ;0

This was delicious and very tender. I was craving some cornbread with a little sweetness and this hit the spot. I halved the recipe and put it an 8x8 and it was a nice height (about 1 and 1/2 inches).

This cornbread is excellent.  Moist and dense and not too sweet with a very balanced flavor.  I made it for the first time yesterday for a potluck dinner to go with chili.  It was a hit.  The only change I made was I used butter instead of oil.  I also ended up soaking the corn meal and milk about 10-15 min, more by accident than anything.   I definitly see the potential of the recipe for customing it.  I want to make it again with a little more sugar and I want to try changing the flour/corn meal ratio.  I look forward to a spicy variety as well as cooking it in my cast iron skillet.    Excellent.

Great recipe! The cornbread came out exactly as described, crispy outside and moist inside.   I put a healthy spin on it by replacing 1/2 cup of vegetable oil with 2/3 cup of yogurt (still used oil to grease the pan though).  In addition, I put in a can of whole kernel corn in the batter before pouring it into prepared greased pan.

What I made was five starred, but I made a few modifications: A lot of people were going to eat it so I added another half of the recipe. I swapped the amounts of cornmeal and flour, and added polenta. First mixed the 4 1/4c milk with 3c cornflour and 1/4c polenta. I added more milk because it seemed like it could use more moisture. Let sit for 15 minutes. Added 3 eggs and 3/4c oil and mixed well. Combined 2c flour, 1.5T baking powder, 1.5t salt and 1c sugar (could have only put 2/3c though). Then added to the cornmeal mix. Poured most of it in a preheated, oiled cast iron skillet and baked.  The rest I made into muffins. It was a hit with all ten people who devoured it!

Really good cornbread. This one wasn't light and fluffy like others we've tried, but rather was dense, moist and cake-like.  Was perfect with our turkey chili tonight.

I like cornbread when I go to restaurants, but never had any success when trying recipies at home. Usually they come out bland, dry or just tastes gross. I thought I'd give it another go again after stumbling upon this recipe...and is it ever good! This will be the only recipe I use from now on. It was moist and slightly sweet. We had it with a spanish soup and it was so tasty. I might try throwing in some extras next time like green onions or something, but plain is also very good.

I took other reviewers' suggestions, using 1 C of mixed sugars, 2 C of cornmeal, 1-1/2 C of flour, then gave the cornmeal/milk a good 10 minutes.  I baked it in a glass dish at 375 and it came out very nice.

I made this recipe the other day for a pre-Thanksgiving dinner and my friends thoroughly enjoyed and found the bread very filling. I decided to bake the cornbread in mini loaf pans because I wanted each individual piece to be crispy. Also, I added 1 cup of corn to give the cornbread more texture and flavor.

I followed this recipe to the tee and I never knew cornbread could be so moist and delicious.  I think the key is as stated, letting the batter mix at least 5 min. I just let it go in my Kitchenaid mixer and baked for 30 min. It went perfect with the Ultimate Chili recipe I made on this site. I will never buy boxed cornbread again. Thanks!

I baked this for 50 ppl for Thanksgiving and it turned out deliciously moist and wonderful! Substituted 1/4 c sugar for honey and left the cornmeal soaking in milk for 15, not 5, minutes.

Just made these to go with some hatch chile chili.  I used what I had at home (blue corn meal instead of regular & almond milk instead of regular milk) and they came out great! I baked them in a muffin pan for 25 min., recipe makes 18 cornbread muffins. I'll make a bit of honey butter to go with the left overs!

Made exactly as written, except I had no vegetable oil and used coconut oil instead.  This will be my new cornbread recipe!  Turned out perfectly -- so light and moist, not too dense at all.  VERY good with a little shredded cheese sprinkled over the top before baking.

Sweet and cakey like we Yanks love it!  Great flavor/texture.  Nice crown, even at high altitude!  One problem, I checked it after 30 mins at 400 and it was browned but still soupy.  Reduced temp to 350 and cooked an additional 40 minutes.  Still turned out good, but barely done in the center and almost too brown on the edges.  Next time, I'd just do 350 for at least an hour.

I make this in 4 12x16 pans, recipe multiplied by 10 for the store where I bake.  The customers LOVE it and I have been told it's the best cornbread they can buy in San Francisco.

Not sure what all the complaints were about.  The bread I made was fabulous.  Even my picky 16 month old had a couple of pieces.  It came out moist and crumbly with just the right amount of sweetness.  I did modify the recipe somewhat and took the advice of a few.  Here's what I did (I was only making it for me and my daughter so I halved the recipe):  replaced half the white sugar with brown; added just over 1/2c of frozen corn; beat the mixture on low for 5 minutes; baked in a loaf pan at 375 degrees for appx 37 minutes.  The only things I may do differently in the future would be use all brown sugar and add some chopped green chilies (I like it spicy).  I will make this again.  Thank you for sharing!  :)

I followed the directions to the letter. For some reason, by the time the center was cooked, the bottom and sides were burned. I might try two smaller pans next time instead of one large one. Aside from the burnt parts it tasted wonderful and was just the right balance of corn flavor to sweetness. Overall, very yummy!

A good crusty, light cornbread, but personally, I like my cornbread thick and moist. I'd suggest using buttermilk and adding a tablespoon of honey!

This turned out nice. It is dense but good and has a great crust. I only used 3 TBSP of sugar. I also added a bunch of fresh chopped sage and chives. I was thinking of using it for stuffing. It would make a nice herbed bread with dinner though with a nice flavoured herb butter (maybe a little dill in the butter)

This recipe is THE BEST cornbread I have ever eaten!!! I grew up on Jiffy and will NOT be going back. The texture and taste are out of this world! Please make sure you read the directions carefully. The recipe calls for 2 1/2 cups of milk. The directions don't include the milk but make sure you add it! Thanks for sharing.

This really is top-notch cornbread!  Slight changes I made: grease a 12" iron skillet and set it in the oven as the oven heats up. I stir the wet ingredients into the dry and mix just till they are blended then I let the batter rest again another 5 minutes before pouring it into the hot skillet. This makes the batter puff up nicer I think. The hot skillet makes for an outstanding crust. I'm making this cornbread again -- today!!  It's awesome with some frozen corn tossed in the batter too.

Best cornbread I've ever eaten!  Moist without being too heavy.  Only thing I did differently was to cut the sugar almost in half and added a few drops of hot sauce and about 1 1/2 cups grated cheddar cheese.  Served it with chili, and it was a hit!

I honestly don't know why I made this.  I'm not a corn bread person - never have been.  I made chili for dinner on this cold, snowy evening and, for some inexplicable reason, corn bread sounded like a good side.  Made this just as written except baked it in a Pampered Chef 4-section mini loaf pan (vs. the 9x13 pan).  This came out just plain yummy.  Corn bread, where have you been all my life?!  I thought that making the mini loaves would shorten the time but I still needed to cook it the full 35 minutes (might've been due to my geriatric oven) but this was really good.  I did not see the note about mixing it for 5 minutes so next time I will have to try that but, even without the extra mixing time, no complaints from this corn bread hater!

This was excellent. I'm trading making meals for a friend for child care. She hates to cook and loves children and I need a break and love to cook. Anyway, I paired this with an enchillada dish and they went crazy over it. So did my husband since I kept enough to fill two ramikens. The results were delish!

This is a great cornbread recipe and almost exactly what I've been searching for.  I grew up in Texas and my mom always used Martha White's Cornbread Mix.  However, living in Boston now I cannot find that in my stores.  The only change I made to the recipe is that I use far less sugar.  I used only 1/4 cup as I don't like my cornbread sweet.  I also think it could of used maybe 1/2 tsp more salt...maybe.  I'm going to try it again today and I'll will update my review to confirm if that was a wise addition.  Also, I make my cornbread in a 10 inch cast iron skillet.  I put about a tblsp of vegetable oil in the skillet (just enough to coat the entire bottom of the skillet) and let the skillet heat up in the oven before I pour in the cornbread batter.  It comes out nice and crisp on the edges that way.  (Just the way my mom and grandma did it!)***UPDATE***  I made used 1 1/2 tsp of salt and it really made a difference in the flavor.  Now I have the PERFECT cornbread recipe!

I love this cornbread recipe...I make it all the time. You don't have to do anything to it differently, just mix, combine and bake. I allow my cornmeal to soak while I mix the rest of the dry ingredients.  I mix the eggs and oil into the milk and cornbread. Then combine the two bowls together, couldn't be easier. Love it, Love it , Love it!

This was so much better than the standard cornbread...it's a bit denser and thicker and did I mention much yummier.  Throwing out all my other cornbread recipes.  You cannot go wrong with this one.

Delicious and moist with a great corn flavor! Made to go with chili con carne tonight and this came out as a great accompaniment. Not too sweet, nor too heavy; a perfect light crumb. The first time my boyfriend had cornbread and he loved it! Thanks Willow's Mom!

Way too much cornmeal but the recipe yields good bread. Next time I cut down to 1/2 cup and and added some sweet corn to the batter. It was good corn bread.

I usually just use a cornbread box mix but it was a special occasion.  I decided to make it from scratch. This recipe was easy to make as well as moist.  For those who have felt it wasn't sweet enough I think you are used to eating the cornbread served at restaurants.  Some of those are like eating cake with a little cornbread mixed in!  I even have one of those recipes and you add vanilla instant pudding.  This recipe is the real thing.  I'm glad I tried it.  I don't think I'll be using the box mix anymore.

Reminded me of pound cake; dense and sweet.  I prefer a light textured cornbread, but this was a nice enough change from the 'traditional.'  Baked in a large loaf pan & a mini loaf pan.  The batter rose quite a bit, and it took 50-60 minutes to bake at 400 degrees.

I've tried several cornbreads from this site and this one is the one I'm keeping.  The texture is just right for cornbread.  Moist and sweet, but not cakey.  I took the advice of a couple reviews and switched the cornbread and flour quantities.  I also added light brown sugar for half the sugar as well as a dash of vanilla.  (I like sweet cornbread)  It was PERFECT.  Again, this will be my staple cornbread recipe from now on.  THANKS!!

FANTASTIC delicious easy cornbread! I used butter instead of oil and added 1.5c of dried cranberries. I made muffins instead of a pan. I baked them at 375 for 20 minutes. I made 28 muffins, but obviously without the cranberries there would be fewer.

Tried this tonight to go with chili.  Soaked the cornmeal for about 10 minutes I think (not on purpose) and I couldn't find my wisk so I used a fork to just mix/beat up the batter until smooth. (perhaps just a minute or so?)  I added grated cheddar cheese and topped it with some more when it came out of the oven.  The texture was lovely and light.  The flavour was a bit dull, however I know that some savoury herbs will do the trick.  By far the best corn bread recipe  I've tried. ----   OK, here's an update--grated sharp cheddar, chopped garden fresh red peppers and jalapenos added to the batter made this recipe POP!

I used corn oil, instead of vegetable oil. After all, this is a corn-based recipe, and it's a bit healthier choice. It made a great accompaniment to the Boilermaker Tailgate Chili recipe. 
March 2017 update: although I've made this several times, I've down-rated my initial rating. Because it's quite dense,  I took another reviewer's suggestion and used an electric beater and beat the mixture for 5 min.   It made no difference...if anything, it came out ever more dense, to the point that it looked like it hadn't baked through enough. I even tried baking for another 15 min, but there was no improvement.  I won't be using this recipe again.

This is our favorite cornbread recipe!  Will end my search for the best, as this is it!  Awesome when warm, with butter.  Will try 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white next time.

Made just as instructed - excellent! Maintained structural integrity for buttering - which is good, I hate a too crumbly cornbread. Was sweet, but no too sweet.  Paired with Terrific Turkey Chili - great dinner!

I took other suggestions and changed cornmeal to 2 cups and flour to 1 1/2 cups. Bake in pan less than 9 x 13 but not 8 x8 and you will get a very moist, dense delicious corn bread.

This was my first time making homemade cornbread, and I really liked it. I made the suggested changes about reversing the cornmeal and flour amounts, used 1/3 C white sugar and 1/3 C light brown sugar, let the cornmeal & milk (I used soy milk) sit for ~7 minutes, and mixed the batter for 5 minutes exactly. I also added 1/4 C honey to the batter for extra sweetness. I baked it in a 9x13 pan at 375 for 30 minutes. The result? Yum! Yes, it was a bit cakey, like other reviewers said, but I personally like cakey rather than crumbly. The taste could have been a bit stronger... it was lacking some flavor for some reason. But overall, very tasty and very easy to make. Be advised, this makes a LOT! If you're not having a feast of some sort, I'd suggest just making half the recipe. I don't know how I'm going to eat the rest of mine!

This cornbread is delicious! I halved the recipe and baked in an 8x8 pyrex pan for my husband and I to go with chili. It is incredibly moist with just enough sweetness to balance out spicy food.  I'm making it for a second time tonight and can't wait to eat it!

I made this just like the recipe said, plus I mixed the batter for 5 minutes like someone suggested, and this cornbread was SOOO dense--like when bread doesn't rise... the taste is pretty good, but I will NEVER use this recipe again... so dissapointing!

Very very good...so sweet I ate it for dessert.  I might reduce the sugar next time and switch the flour measurements for the cornmeal measurements so it's more like cornbread and less like cake.  However, I might not change anything.  It's great as is.

I'll never buy that boxed garbage corn muffin/bread mix again. This is PHENOMENAL. I had some fine-ground cornmeal on hand and was looking for a recipe to use some of it up in, and I was shocked at the difference between this and the store-bought mix. This recipe made THE BEST cornbread I've ever had.

It was really good.  I think I did something wrong though because the cornmeal was crunchy in the bread, and did not taste good at all.  I used polenta instead so maybe that was my problem?  Or maybe I didn't let it soak long enough in the milk?

Great recipe! Followed the recipe exactly and it came out wonderful. I definitely suggest stirring the ingredients for a longer peroid of time as suggested earlier to ensure the bread rises. Absolutely delicious with chili!

i don't even like cornbread, but i made it to go along with dinner one night and the kids loved it. i have made it 3 times since, i have never even taken a bite but everyone loves it.
i made some adjustments so can only give it 4 stars - let the cornmeal sit with the milk for 10 mins or more, melted butter in place of oil, 3 tbsp brown sugar and 7 tbsp splenda as hubby is diabetic.

YUM!! I have been on the prowl for a really moist cornbread recipe, and this is it!! My whole family loved it.  I did the half brown/half white sugar and also made the butter-honey glaze (2 TB butter, 1-2 TB honey, pinch of salt).  Delicious! Will definitely make it into my regular recipes.

Once I read Leacher's review I knew I had to try this recipe. Who could resist "in your face" cornbread? I was not disappointed. I've never made better cornbread! Since I am very set in my ways I did substitute buttermilk for the plain milk and melted butter for the vegetable oil. My kids ate it up like cake! My husband enjoyed it with butter and honey. I crumbled mine into black bean chili.

This is the best cornbread I've ever had. I highly recommend it to anyone who hates the dry, crumbly nature of most cornbread. I have made it several times now (including one meal which required me to substitute soy milk because of a guest's dairy allergy) and every single time it has turned out so moist and delicious that you don't even need dessert!

I halved the recipe and used a glass 8x8 pan, along with substituting unsweetened soymilk for dairy milk.  I also added 1/3 c. frozen corn kernels and about 2 Tbsp. minced jarred jalepenos.  The sweetness of the bread and corn compliment the heat from the jalepenos.  This is a great base recipe--quick and easy and tasty :)

I love this recipe!  I love that it is dense and you can spread your butter on it easily without it falling apart in your hands.  I baked for about 30 minute, could have gone 5 more minutes, but in my standards, the cornbread was perfect because I like when doughy things aren't fully baked (like brownies).

Just like she said- moist and fluffy.  Turned out perfect and we will keep this as our new standard for cornbread.  I can't eat chili without it! Also makes a great corn dog when hot dogs and shredded cheddar are added.

Absolutely delicious! If you want a more savory (less sweet), fluffy, crumbly cornbread- then this is NOT the recipe you are looking for! If you want a sweet, very moist and dense cornbread--almost like a corn cake that can completely stand alone, not just as a side--then this is it. YUMMY! Great with butter after baked or without. For once a recipe me entire family gobbles up. And I have picky eaters! This is the ONLY recipe I use and have made it many, many times. I have successfully used powdered milk and water in place of liquid milk and it tasted no different. We also use fresh ground cornmeal from a local mill- it really makes this recipe even that more delish!

perfect. not too sweet, not too grainy, nice texture, golden color. i loved it. the ONLY thing is....it starts to get stale around the sides really quickly. my advice is to leave it in the pan you baked it in, and cover it while still warm. (not HOT though) that way the cover will keep some moisture in. i just had a piece the next day and it's still very moist and not stale.

I make this a lot. My family thought it neded to be a just a little sweeter, so I sprinkle a bit of granulated sugar on the top just as the bread starts to set up when baking.

This is a great base recipe for cornbread.  The first time I made it exactly as written and it was delicious.  The second time I added a minced jalapeno and some dried rosemary and it was even better.

Great, moist, easy cornbread recipe! Made this today to go with slow cooked chili. I added about 1/4 cup drained creamed sweet corn for more texture and it turned out perfect.  Great with a dab of honey butter!! (equal parts butter and honey...for a sweeter spread, add up to equal part powdered sugar also)  Thanks

I made the following changes for a ligher corn bread with a nice bottom crust. Spray canola oil to coat the inside of a 10-inch cast iron skillet. Place skillet in cold oven and turn on oven and heat to 400 F. 

Mix 1-1/2 cups of corn meal....1/2 cup all purpose flour....1/4 cup granulated sugar....1 tablespoon baking powder....3/4 teaspoon salt. Wisk together in a mixing bowl.

In a 2-cup pyrex measuring cup add....1-1/4 cups milk....2 eggs. Wisk until smooth. Heat in microwave 45-seconds to bring to room temperature. Add 1/3 cup canola oil. Wisk until smooth.

Wisk wet ingredients into dry ingredients. Wisk until smooth. Pour batter into the heated cast iron skillet. Bake 30 minutes or until knife inserted in center comes out clean. You can also use a non-preheated 9x13 inch baking dish.

yummy!  I substituted thirty percent whole wheat flour to make it more healthy.  And I cut the sugar a bit.  Delicious!

Made it agin with all white flour and upped it to five stars.  I have made this many times since then!

This is the best cornbread I have ever tasted!  I've made it several times -- always with perfect results.   The only changes I've made have been when I use whole wheat flour instead of white:  then I add a little extra sugar and oil.   GREAT recipe, thanks!

My first try at making homemade cornbread and I'm so glad I found this recipe!  With a first run, I try to follow the recipe to a tee and, if necessary, do my own personal tweaking with subsequent runs, if necessary.  That said, I followed this to the letter and am happy to report that no modifications are necessary imho.  Absolutely the flavor and texture I was looking and hoping for. I baked for 42 minutes and it had a beautiful golden crust. Thank you for posting this recipe!

Wonderful! Crispy top, sweet & dense. I made this for my turkey stuffing, and made it GLUTEN-FREE by substituting besan flour (also known as chick pea flour) , found in international food sections of your grocery store.
Delicious!!

Soaking the cornmeal in the milk definitely helped, making this cornbread one of the best I've had as far as texture.  The flavor left a little to be desired, but it was very delicious when crumbled into the soup I made with it.  I'll definitely keep this recipe on hand, but I might tinker with it some.

This is my first time making cornbread from scratch, not a box. This recipe was very easy to follow and the result was amazing. Two men who were raised in the South ate some and said it was very good and very moist. It didn't crumble and wasn't dry at all. The only thing I wasn't sure about is the recipe says to put mixture in prepared pan but doesn't say how to prepare it. I just sprayed Pam on it and guess it worked fine.

was more "cakelike" than the cornbread I am used to. Guess I should have known that before I made it. Oh well, no harm, no foul!

It was my first time making cornbread and I was thrilled with the way it came out!! I've had cornbread before but I always thought it was too grainy, this recipe was not. Sweet, dense and full of flavour. Made it for a family dinner and they absolutely loved it!!!

This had great flavor, was very dense, heavy. A good recipe. A little heavier and denser than I prefer, but I might make it again. Not too grainy, gritty,  or coarse.

OK but nothing special -- tasted like the standard recipe on the side of the cornmeal box.  Also, we prefer using butter over vegetable oil.

This cornbread turned out great, although I made a few modifications. I used corn flour instead of flour, used 1 1/2 cups cream and 1 cup milk for the milk, used 1/2 cup melted margarine for the oil, and added a can of corn run through the blender. It turned out with a great crust and nice and fluffy on the inside.

This was really good - went perfectly with the chili that I served with it.  I followed others' suggestions and switched the cornmeal and flour amounts.  I also let the cornmeal soak in the milk (I used soy) for 10 minutes.  I kept the prescribed sugar amount, but used splenda instead.  It tasted great, and got many compliments - thanks!

I was looking for a recipe for cornbread that wasnt TOO sweet. If  I wanted to make cake.... I would =) I dont want to. I want to make cornmeal,haha. This recipe was great. I switched the quantities for flour and cornmeal and let the cornmeal and milk set for 10 min. per  others suggestions. I also made the recipe to be 1 1/2 times and then had more then enough to  fit in a 9 x 13 pan. This made it possible to reduce the temperature to 375 and produce really thick cornbread slices like they have at Marie Calendars! I loved it!

This was excellent!  I did what others  suggested and reversed the amounts of flour and cornmeal.  Although I did not increase the sugar, it was sweet to my taste and I might decrease the sugar the next time I make it.

Great Recipe - Thanks! I'm an experimenter, so here's what I did different (for a 1/2 recipe yealding 7.5 searvings)...1 C. 1% milk + 1/4 C. whipping cream (that's what I had), 3/4 C. flour + 1/4 C. ground flax seeds (for more fiber & omega 3 & less carbs), 1/3 C. unpacked brown sugar.  Hand whisked for 5 full min. Baked in an oiled glass loaf pan for 45min.  Came out golden & crisp on outside w/nice crack down center.  Tastes crunchy on the outside, very moist & just the right density/fluffyness on the inside. Like it a bit sweeter (I guess I shouldn't have cut down ;) ).  I will use 1/3 C. packed brown sugar next time, and maybe add more flax seeds for a nuttier texture. It's a keeper!

This cornbread was pretty good.  What we liked:  it didn't crumble apart when you took a bite; nice, light sweet taste.  What we didn't like:  other than being a little sweet, this cornbread was pretty bland.  I followed others' advice and switched the cornmeal and flour amounts and also whisked for five minutes before it went into the pan.  Maybe it needs a little jalapeno.  Still better than most cornbread recipes I've tried.  But I'm still looking....

I'm from the south and have tasted A LOT of cornbread.  So believe me when I say this is DELICIOUS!!  I did make some minor changes-- I flip-flopped the flour and corn meal amounts to make sure it didn't have too much of a cake-like texture as others have said.  Also, I kept the amount of sugar the same, BUT I mixed some of it into the batter and reserved a small amount to sprinkle on top just before baking (also per suggestions here).  I didn't think it was too sweet, but it is sweet.  My husband also said it was "good;"  this is a compliment from him because he usually says everything is "okay."  I halved the recipe b/c it was just the two of us, and it just fit into my 8-inch cast iron skillet.  We ate this with the yummy Vegan Black Bean soup also on this site.

This is the only cornbread recipe I ever plan on using!  I cut some of the fat and calories by using 2 egg whites to replace one of the eggs; 1/2 cup sugar substitute instead of real sugar; and only 1/3 cup of oil.  Excellent!

I made this cornbread for my vegetarian thanksgiving dinner this year, not only was it not too dry, not too sweet, not too salty, and not too HEAVY, it also looked absolutely beautiful on my table.  this is my new favorite cornbread recipe, and i'll be passing it on to future generations.

This is a really good corn bread if you add some canned corn, jalapenos or cheese.
Otherwise I found it to be a bit bland just by itself.

Yummy!  Moist and good.  I will definitely make this again. I don't suggest you make this in a large loaf pan though.  I did and the middle was a little too dense.

I lost my best corn bread recipe and was looking for another to replace it.  This recipe was even better.  Wonderful!  Thanks Patricia!

I thought I had the perfect cornbread recipe, but this one beats it.  The only thing I do differently is use half whole wheat flour and half white flour, because I like it coarser.  This is the best cornbread I have ever tasted!

I was skeptical of this recipe because I personally like a cornbread not a cake like corn bread and it had alot of sugar, I did cut down some of the sugar and I was very impressed! I thought it was very good, thanks for  sharing

I have searched long and hard for the perfect cornbread recipe, and I've finally found it!  Of course, it sparks the great Southern debate--Can you put sugar in cornbread?  My answer is, ABSOLUTELY!  This tastes like dessert!  But if you're one of those southerners who is offended by the addition of sugar...find another one.

My husband was floored! I made it to go with a chili mix we got from the Women's Bean Project, and he thought the cornbread was better than the chili (which was great!). He said that he's bringing some of it to his mother so she'll know he's being well fed. I liked the idea of adding corn, so I added an 8 oz can (drained) and reduced the milk by about 1/4 cup.

The best cornbread I've ever made!  The tip about soaking the cornmeal in liquid is great. I cooked it in a cast iron pan-- perfect crust!  I used honey instead of sugar, and it had just the right touch of sweetness.

Noticed some complaints about this recipe. Did not use an electric mixer. Beat the heck out of the dough. It turned out moist and delicious. Drizzled honey on it just for a little extra sweetness for breakfast. I’m removing one star from it because it is blander than other cornbreads I’ve had. But it’s so easy to fix with different toppings and sauces! I might throw in some fruit next time. Oh and it was a little dense but cornbread is supposed to be! It’s a hearty bread meant for long work days and harsh weather!

Woah, best corn bread recipe I have ever made. I prefer to make baked goods from scratch...no mixes with questionable ingredients and GMO, bleached, bromated flour! But, my corn bread from scratch usually comes out too dry. This recipe is perfect! I baked a half batch, and the specified amounts are easily halved. Very tasty and gets a nice crust on the bottom and top.

Wow!  I don't usually rate recipes despite the fact that I have been using this site for over 15 years!  This cornbread is amazing!  And like other reviewers I used light brown sugar instead of white.  Then, only because I didn't have enough milk, I made this with 1 & 1/2 cups of whole milk and one cup of fat free half and half and it made it even more moist than the first time I made the recipe as written.  I bet these would bake into great muffins too! Make this, you will love it!!!

5/2017: I made this cornbread recipe for the first time today. I used buttermilk since that is what I had on hand and I use it more often for baking. I also made muffins, and reduced the baking time to 15 minutes. The muffins were soft and moist. Very tender! Wonderful with butter and honey. I think soaking the cornmeal in the milk really helped with the final texture. It has taken me many years to find a decent cornbread recipe that is moist...this is it! Will definitely be making this recipe again in the future!
6-24-19 UPDATE:  Today I made this recipe using my corn-stick pan. They turned out WONDERFUL!! Crispy on the corn imprint side, soft and tender on the inside. Best & most versatile cornbread recipe ever! When I make the batter I whisk it for at least 5 or 6 minutes to make sure it is smooth with no lumps. I also preheat the cast iron pan that's being used and pour the batter into the hot, oiled pan. Perfect every time!  :)

I've made this twice now. Followed recipe exactly. It was really easy to whip up! I don't see any need to change anything. It's amazing!!!  Dense, moist and delicious! Per some other reviews I did take some extra time to wisk. (5 minutes-ish) It was an absolute hit with my family and guests both times I made it! I'll never buy boxed again!

We used a cup and a half of buttermilk and a cup of 2% milk mixed and "fluffed" the corn meal every couple of minutes while the rest of the dry ingredients come together. I place a cast iron skillet in the oven and preheat it at 400*. Half of a white onion and 3 jalapenos (half seeded, half with seeds) finely diced and sweated down then added to the batter for some spice and some color. I use a cup of white sugar vs the recipes 2/3 because I want to taste the sweetness. When the oven is ready, toss two tablespoons of salted butter into the cast iron and let it melt and brown in the oven. This will give an awesome buttery crust to the cornbread. Then add the batter and bake for 25-30 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean. Still my favorite base recipe for my "doctored up" corn bread!

I used this advice: "switch ingredient amounts between the cornmeal and flour; let the milk/cornmeal mixture sit for 10 minutes or so and whisk it a few times; use half white and half light brown sugar; mix the whole batch for at least 5 min. on low speed; bake in a glass pyrex and reduce oven temp by 25 degrees." Plus replaced oil with melted butter.

This really did not come out good for us at all. I followed the recipe, including the submitters tip for mixing it for 5 minutes after combining. It had a rubbery, gummy texture to it that just was not good. I did like the idea of soaking the cornmeal in the milk. I've never done that before, but now I don't know if that contributed to the bad texture. Sorry. Thank you for the recipe though.

Perfect cornbread.  Lovely texture and great flavor.  Used egg whites instead of whole eggs, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly.

After trying several cornbread recipes from this site, this one is my favourite and I've made it countless times over the years. These are my pro-tips:  The first thing I do is let the cornmeal soak for at least 5-10 minutes, often longer, as I assemble the remaining ingredients. I usually whisk the egg and add it and the oil to the cornmeal mixture. I sift together all the dry ingredients. Mixing it for at least 5 minutes helps with the fluffiness. I also always use a cast iron pan that I heat up in the oven with some oil (or bacon grease if I have it) in it. Add the batter quickly to the hot pan and put it back into the oven. 

These things ensure a perfect result. I've made half the recipe in the past, and it also always turns out. The cornbread doesn't keep super well (it dries out somewhat though can be revived with a gentle nuke), so only make as much as you can use up within a day or two.

This is my go to corn bread recipe!!! Cooking/baking doesn't come natural for me if you know what I mean so finding a recipe that turns out great every time is great! My kids abc husband love it! I substitute sugar for honey and the oil for butter. :)

This was very tasty! Texture was awesome. I followed the recipe exactly and I will make a few changes next time. It needs a little more salt to bring out more flavor and a little more sugar.

I created an account on this site just to comment on how great this cornbread is!!  I've never made corn bread before, and I am so impressed with myself right now. I subbed in unsweetened applesauce for oil, and demerera for white sugar, and made them into muffins (2doz). I also beat the mix for 5 minutes, like everyone else said, and only baked for 25 minutes. My husband made a bit of maple butter and BAM! These are so good.

I tried the recipe and it was amazing! i did have some issues with it being undercooked but that was because I used an improper pan. Otherwise it was very good. I am from the south, Georgia and it tasted like I was home again.

I made this with buttermilk because I had some on-hand that I needed to use up, and it was the best homemade cornbread that I have ever had! It was super moist, perfectly (not overly) sweet and had great texture. I don't even want to know how many calories it has per serving! Haha. But regardless, I WILL be making this again! :) Thank you, WILLOWSMOM99!

I made Grandmothers Buttermilk cornbread last weekend and this one today.  This is my favorite! I only cooked it for 25 minutes, I think if I cooked longer than that it would of been too dry.  This is moist and has really good flavor.  I found Grandmother Buttermilk recipe too sweet.  This one is perfect!

I found that this recipe didn't have enough "corn" taste to it and was too sweet and dense, it was a dense cake at best.

Awful. You cant taste the corn flavor at all.  It tasted like a sugar cookie with little sugar and no butter.

This was a total fail for me.  I did everything according to the recipe and it came out like a hockey puck.  The flavour was fine but I'm sure glad I didn't have company over!

What an odd texture... it was moist all right, to the point that I wasn't sure it was done even after the knife came out squeaky clean, and spongy and dense, even though I did follow the submitter's note to beat for 5 minutes before pouring it into the baking dish. It sliced and served without crumbling at all. I think I prefer my cornbread to crumble a little. The flavor was mild; nothing noteworthy. Edible but will not make again.

I'm another baker in love with this recipe. It's simply delicious. I have made it as-published (without the extra mixing) and it comes out fine (I like my cornbread a little dense). I've also made it in a loaf pan, and once I worked out the extra cooking time, it's fine. My favorite tweak, however, is to omit the salt and baking powder and use self-rising flour instead. Delicious and fluffy! Thanks for this recipe. It's the only one I use now!

This was a great cornbread recipe. Often when I have tried to make cornbread it is dry and crumbly. Thiis one was not at all. I even used gluten free flour for the added regular flour (coconut flour kind) because my grandson is allergic. Everyone loved it. I did follow the recipe for soaking the corn meal and milk first and then mixing all the ingredients for 5 minutes. I put a glass dish with a tablespoon of butter in the oven while it preheated so the dish was already hot when I added the mix. It was moist and had a good texture.

This recipe was perfect the way it is called out in the recipe and directions. I think it is important to let the whole mix stand for at least five minutes in the pan undisturbed before baking.  This created some nice air pockets in the cornbread that were noticed by my guests.

I thought this cornbread was great (and so did my husband). I did beat the batter for the suggested 5 minutes and baked it in a cast iron skillet. Crunchy good on the outside and moist in the middle.

This cornbread recipe is one of the sweetest and most moist I have tasted. Follow the directions carefully. On my second batch I mixed the eggs into the flour, salt, and sugar before adding the cornmeal and milk. It came out kinda lumpy.

This is exactly the recipe I have been looking for.   Because I prefer the texture of my cornbread to be a little heavier than cake, I took the advice of the reviewers who suggested switching the amounts of cornmeal and all purpose flour.  So I used 2 C of cornmeal and 1 1/2 flour.  Baked it in a cast-iron skillet.  No problems at all - Easy Peasy!! Hmm delish.  I love it, and so does my family.  Thanks for sharing.

Loved this recipe with some modifications. First I halved the recipe and subbed heavy cream and 1/2 1/2 for the milk and used melted butter instead of oil. Used a bit more butter than called for. As one reviewer mentioned the submitter of this recipe said it is important to wisk all the ingredients for 5 minutes before pouring batter in to your dish. I did this and my shoulder was not happy with me afterwards lol. It did make for a light, fluffy and MOIST cornbread. Finally found my recipe. Thanks to all the buzzers who helped steer me in the right direction. I took tips from all of you who answered my post. I also only cooked it for 20 minutes and it turned out perfect.

We like our cb a bit sweeter so on second batch I added 2 table spoon stevia and used skim milk to try to counter the added fat of the butter we lathe on to it.

Amazing! I followed the recipe to a tee but the only thing I changed was that I pre-heated an iron skillet in the oven at 500 degrees for about 10mins and then I lowered the oven to 375 and poured everything in the skillet. It was done in about 15mins! Even my husband who isn't a cornbread fan LOVED it!

This was a really good cornbread. I love making it from scratch. I left this mixing in my mixer like 10plus minutes buy mistake only because someone came to my door....maybe that's why it fluffed up more then I thought it should, however, it was perfect for what I was making it with.....chili! Will totally make again.

PERFECTION!
I read thru the reviews so I made a few changes as suggested.  For years I have looked for "The Perfect Cornbread Recipe", I have finally found it.
I used 2 1/2 cups corn meal (heirloom, organic blue corn meal), soaked it in the milk (organic) as suggested and then used 1 cup flour (organic wheat flour), I used the 2/3c sugar and it turned out PERFECT!  If you like a sweeter cornbread I would suggest using 1cup sugar but I wouldn't go less than 1/2c sugar, it isn't sweet, at this mixture it is perfect
I love that it makes in a large pan as there are 2 of us and I like to have plenty left over to freeze for an easy dinner night.   
The remaining pieces are cooling now so I may freeze them!
THANK YOU FOR A GREAT RECIPE!!!!

Haven't tried this particular recipe, but since its almost word for word of my mother's recipe, think its just fine. The only difference is, my mother used hot milk, or hot water to soak the cornmeal in. And my mother used cornbread as a quick dinner bread all the time, she learned from her mother who learned from hers, so its as authentic as you can get! This idea that cornbread is only authentic if its got corn or hot peppers or whatever the fashion is, is a relatively new ides, corn bread is a quick bread, when you haven't got time to make a more time or space consuming bread, cook it in the skillet, and its even a one dish to mix, and cook!

LOVE this recipe!! SO good and you can tweak it too! Want to try it with a little extra zing? Add grated cheddar and some sliced jalapenos. Oh yes I did!! Save this recipe. Seriously. You'll be so glad you did!!

We liked this recipe. It had a good taste, and it doesn't crumble at a touch, so it was easy to pick up and eat. My only change was that I had to use half white and half brown sugar, because I ran out.

WOW!  This is now my only recipe for cornbread.  I did add shredded sharp cheddar to the batter.  Used a cast iron pot, preheated in the 400 degree oven (melted 2T butter in it), for baking the cornbread.  Just lovely and incredibly moist.  I did let the cornmeal and milk sit together, with wisking every minute or so for at least 5 minutes.  Excellent flavor.  Would have loved to have put in some fresh corn as well, but did not have any on hand.  Thank you, Willowsmom99, for this recipe and thanks to all for technique suggestions!

This recipe is great alone, but but kind of tasteless so I tried it with these variations:
•use all brown sugar and use a little more than the original amount
•add a 2 capfulls of pure vanilla extract when mixing all ingredients together
•add 1 can of sweet fancy grade yellow corn also when mixing all ingredients together
•and use a little more flour than recipe calls for
If you try this it is much better than the original. I hope this helps! :-)

This was fine. I thought it was a bit bland, dry, and smelled "eggy" to me. Personally, I think the Vegan Agave Cornbread Muffins from this site are much, much better.

I made this exactly as written, but I used a cast iron skillet (in the oven) with some melted butter.  This was the tastiest corn bread I have ever made.  I have tried several recipes on this site and this is the one I'm keeping.  So good.

Moist on the inside, crispy on the edges.  I halved the recipe and used white corn meal.  Baked it in a brownie pan for 25 minutes.  Had it with Chef John's White Bean Chicken Chili.  Divine!

Cornbread perfection! I followed the recipe exactly, vigorously mixing the batter for several minutes before pouring it into the pan. It was sweet, fluffy and airy, and is now my official "go to" cornbread recipe.

It was perfect. I adjusted the serving size to 8. I've never baked anything from scratch before. This came out just beautiful. It was delicious. We don't keep regular milk at my house, so I used Almond milk. Thank you for sharing.

This is my new go-to recipe for cornbread! I serve it whenever I make the Ultimate Chili recipe from this site. If there's any left over (rarely!), I warm it up for breakfast with butter and blackberry preserves. Wonderful recipe -- thanks!

Normally I make a recipe as written before I play with it, but this time I couldn't help myself. I tweaked the recipe a little, adding an extra 1/4 tsp of baking powder and 2 Tbsp of honey, and substituted for the cow's milk with almond milk since we have a dairy allergy in the household.  

I wanted to make muffins instead of a big pan of cornbread, so I decreased the oven temperature to 375 and filled 24 standard muffin cups 2/3 full.  I baked the muffins for 15 minutes and they turned out nice and light with that hint of honey flavor I was looking for.

I love this cornbread.  I am from the South and make it WITHOUT the sugar.  I use self-rising flour and leave out the baking powder and salt.  And I always use olive oil instead of a vegetable oil.  OK, so mine seems like almost a different recipe, but it's good.  I think the soaking the corn meal in the milk must make the good difference between this and ordinary cornbread.

Let me tell you that this is a super cornbread recipe. I followed the suggestions for changing it a  bit from SARGEQ and I just took it out of the oven. 2 cups of corn meal and 1 1/2 cups of flour with a cup of sugar. SUPER!

This was good. I made it exactly like the recipe--next time I will switch the cornmeal/flour mixture, like suggested by others. It needed just a bit more corn flavoring for our liking...but we still gobbled it up!

Made it as is, but reduced down to 8 servings and used an 8X8 pan. LOVED IT!!!  Next time I make it, I will pay more attention to the amount of salt I add since I didn't measure and really needed more.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

This cornbread was so tasty! It makes a good sized pan of bread too, so you won't have to worry about not having enough! Very easy to follow. I didn't change a thing. My husband even complimented me on it and he normally despises cornbread! That's how I knew this was a keeper. It's a good go to recipe!

Delicious flavour.  I added about 1/4 cup parmesan cheese to the dry ingredients and reduced sugar to 1/4 cup.  I beat the mixture for the 5 minutes as suggested by many reviewers and somehow it didn't work for me.  I made the bread into muffins and they didn't rise at all.  It was like eating little cornbread tarts, but with a little garlic butter spread over the warm cornbread, it more than made up for the lack in height.  Next time will try just folding the wet and dry ingredients together and then baking.  Definitely worth another try.

This recipe came out too dense for me.  I mixed it for 5 minutes as some reviewers said, but it was still really heavy.

Made three batches of this for a party - it was a hit with everyone. I reversed the amounts for cornmeal and all-purpose flour and added half a can of green chillies to each batch.  Delicious and moist. Will make again.

This doesn't have the texture of the cornbread I grew up with. It seemed very heavy, rather than light, golden, and crusty as one would expect. It's likely just a different type of cornbread than I grew up with. Apparently many love it by the good rating, but it isn't for us.

I added ground chilies to the mixture and sprinkled some on others. This made a difference.  they are okay for a snack and will do in a pinch.  With a few tweaks it has the potential for fantastic

I have been looking for years for a cornbread recipe that wasn't crumbly, slightly sweet and makes a lot! I found your recipe about a year ago and have been making it ever since. This is the BEST cornbread I have ever had. My family absolutely loves it with my navy bean soup. Thanks so much for sharing this moist, slightly sweet, delicious recipe.

Fantastic--At last I found a recipe for good, crusty cornbread.  I halved the recipe and cooked it in a preheated iron skillet.  Since my corn meal was finely ground, I also used all corn meal and no flour.  It was delicious.

I followed the other reviewer's advice and beat the mixture well for at least 5 minutes and this cornbread came out delicious! There's only 2 of us but it is so tasty we have devoured almost all of it in less than 24 hours! Thanks for this great recipe!!

Good flavor and moist. I used the electric mixer on low for 5  minutes and it wasn't dense; it had good texture. I didn't realize how much it made though. Next time I'll cut the recipe in half!

It was fabulous!  I used self rising corn meal.  So it was light and fluffy.  Did not fall apart.  Liked the sweetness, too.  Too, I cooked it in a cast iron skillet in the oven.  "I" got raves, thx so much.

WOW - FIrst time making cornbread and it was delicious..three tweaks - split sugar between white and brown, mixed all ingredients in a mixer on low for 5 - 10 minutes and baked at 375 in a glass dish for 35 minutes.
best ever - especially with my homemade chili!

Nice and firm, but not hard, and just sweet enough.  My husband prefers a little softer bread, but I think it's perfect with stew or brown beans!

I was looking for something to go with chili and this is it!  It is sooo fantastic.  I added a few pickled jalapenos too.  But it was so easy and tasty!
And as this recipe is from a fellow Canadian, I had to try it.  Glad I did!

I pretty much only use recipes with great reviews, and I was honestly a little dissapointed in this one. I must be used to sweeter cornbreads. I didn't feel this was special enough. It is super moist and makes a ton, my husband and son both love it, but it's not my favorite.

This is a very nice, basic cornbread that I've made twice. The first time was with cornmeal that I got from the corn-grinding I'd attended that weekend. The second was made with store bought cornmeal. Same results. 
I actually love sweet cornbread--like the Jiffy mix kind :)  My mom hates that kind and this reminds me of what I grew up on...though she never followed a recipe, I think it's very similar.

My favourite cornbread recipe as of yet. Absolutely loved the texture. I will definitely be making this often. Substituted melted butter for the oil and baked it in a round cake pan.

I made this last night to go along with homemade turkey soup and I must say, it is the BEST cornbread I have ever made!  I followed the recipe with 2 exceptions:  I did not have enough oil so I used melted butter instead and I added about a teaspoon of vanilla.  My son, who is not a cornbread lover, said it was fantastic!  This will be my go-to recipe from now on!  Thanks for sharing!

I made this exactly as the recipe said and I thought it was delicious and super easy to make.  It is very dense, but on a cold winter night this with some turkey chili was perfect!  It would be very easy to modify this to your taste by adding herbs, jalapenos, or cheese!

This is good if you don't want a super sweet, really cake-y cornbread.  This is real cornbread.  Great with chopped jalapenos (mix them in with the flour to get them even), cheese, and chopped poblanos on top.  Make sure to beat it for 5 minutes. It really does help.  Great as a base for taco salad or Navajo tacos as a change.  This works well with whole wheat, as well.  Just lessen the wheat by about 1/4 - 1/2 cup.  And beat really really well.

I thought this cornbread was missing something.  It was moist, yet bland.  Unfortunately, my household did not like it enough for 3/4 of the pan to avoid being thrown out...

I followed the recipe exactly but cut it in half because I didn't need that much at one time. My family loved them! I made them into muffins & also mixed the cornbread for 5 min in mixer like others suggested.

My daughter can't have cow milk.  I used coconut milk in this recipe instead and it was fabulous!  Very moist and flavorful with just the right sweetness.

This cornbread is a bit different than the kind I was raised eating.  Much sweeter and more cake like than I am use to eating.  My kids really enjoyed it.  I used buttermilk instead of milk and used an iron skillet that was hot when I put in the batter (gives it a crisper crust).  Good but I think I will follow the recommendation next time to switch the amounts of flour and cornmeal to give it more of a corn taste.

I have made it several more times.  Definitely switch the amounts for the cornmeal and the flour.  Let it soak properly and I agree with the others to stir that batter for 5 minutes at the end.

Looks terrible, but tastes pretty good.  I must have done something wrong with the recipe because the mixture was VERY liquidy, and it took forever to cook.  I also turned the temp down because it was cooking really fast on the outside and hardly at all on the inside.  I added about 1 cup of sugar and switched the cornmeal and flour amounts as per other reviewers.  I'm really not sure why it was so liquidy.  Maybe less milk next time.

This recipe was very simple to make and was a hit at our recent Thanksgiving dinner. I'm making it again tonight to go with some BBQ pork and beans. Absolutely delish! Unlike some people, we didn't find this too sweet -- perfect as is.

Like many of the other reviewers I found this cornbread to be moist but pretty flavorless. Good with butter and honey but not very good plain. Grandmothers buttermilk cornbread much better.

I loved his cornbread recipe.  I did let the cornmeal and milk soak 10 minutes or so and I made sure to not only fluff up the flour mixture but mix the batter well so it wouldn't be as dense.  The taste and texture were excellent.  The only flaw was I would have like the bread to be a little thicker so next time, i will put it in a pan smaller than 9x13.  Enjoy!

Best cornbread I ever had.  Halved the recipe and baked in 8X8.  My daughter needed a cornbread to bring to school for Virginia/Indian studies.  I didn't want to cheat and use a mix! Very easy to make.

This recipe is so great! It was perfectly sweet and moist! I didn't even need butter on mine. I changed the recipe to make it more healthy by exchanging whole wheat flour for white flour and used skim milk. I also used a heart healthy oil instead of regular cooking oil. This is my new favorite recipe!

It was easy to make.  I'm sad to say that I didn't like it as directed (made it exactly as directed).  The crust seemed too heavy, and it wasn't very "cornbready" for my tastes.  I will say though, it came out moist and fluffy and baked through perfectly in 30 minutes.

The flavor of this bread isn't very "corny".  It was light and moist but really very mild.  Actually, the texture was more like cake than that of corn bread.  I would try adapting with more corn meal and less flour if I made it again.

I chopped a jalapeño pepper and added it to the batter. The slight heat from the pepper combined with the sweetness of the bread was delicious! The bread was perfectly moist and went great with turkey chili.

I made this exactly as directed, but I did not like it at all. It is sweet, but lacks flavor. I think I like a more corn-flavored cornbread. Otherwise, what's the point?

Cornbread came out very dense. Flavor was good, but cornbread was not light and fluffy as I am used to eating. I will try some other recipes.

I used raw sugar and almond milk (because that is what I had) and Bob's Red Mill Cornmeal which is very finely ground.  This is simply the best cornbread I have ever had.  The recipe makes a large cake, enough for leftovers, which are still moist days later.  YUMMERS!

Followed recipe to a T and it was like clay. I cooked it for 35 mins, tested it and it was goo, ended up cooking for 50 minutes. Brown crust, hard gloop inside.

This recipe is great!  I followed the basic premise of the recipe and only changed 2 things... I cut the sugar in half and did 1/3 cup honey and 1/3 cup sugar, and I substituted applesauce for the oil just to cut down on the fat a bit.  My very picky dad and husband both LOVED this cornbread recipe - despite hating every other one I have ever made.  So I guess this is the "keeper" recipe.

Excellent!  I cut the sugar in half since I don't like it too sweet, and added a can of yellow corn and a small can of diced green chiles.  It was delicious!!

This was dense and kinda gelatinous.  I did what others recommended - I beat it in the machine for over 5 minutes, but it did not help.  I did switch the amounts of the corn meal and flour, and I did soak the cornmeal in the milk for 10 minutes.  It didn't work so great for me.  Maybe next time I'll try separating the whites and yolks and beating the whites then folding them in.  I bet that would fluff it up a bit.

If you're looking for Southern cornbread, this isn't it at all.  This is most definitly Yankee cornbread.  Needs more sugar.  I had high hopes for this one.  It looked great, smelled great but tasted bland.  I was definitly less than impressed. It didn't go over well at all for dinner. If you DO decide to make this recipe, be aware this makes ALOT of cornbread.  (And add some sugar too!)

Very delicious flavor, delicate crumb--made a few changes, of course. I halved the recipe to make muffins, it made 8 lofty beauties. I cut down the sugar a little, added 1 1/2 tsp baking powder, as well as about 1/2 C cheddar-jack cheese and about 1/4 chopped chilies (sorry, I don't know what kind--somewhere between jalepenos and green chilies on the hotness scale). Baked at 400 for 15 minutes. Totally delicious with our barbecued beef, then had one toasted this morning with a scrambled egg on it.

Wow! This was my first try at making my own cornbread and i am now addicted. This was phenomenal! I followed the suggestions of a reviewer and lowered the oven temp to 375 and also mixed the batter for 5 minutes to add some air to it. Honey butter on top and i could have eaten the whole pan, but we shared with the neighbors instead =)

This recipe was very moist and a great consistency; however, I felt that it had too much of a flour taste and not enough corn taste.  I did beat the final batter for five minutes, which made the bread rise very nicely in the oven.  Also, I used plain, low-fat soy milk to make the recipe non-dairy.  I think if I ever made this again, I'd definitely add more corn meal and less flour. I just couldn't get over that flour taste.  And I might add some honey or brown sugar in place of some of the white sugar.  This recipe was good but not great.  Thanks, though!

I make this all the time.  Just got on Allrecipes to print out another copy, because the one I printed a year ago was too used!   Other reviewers mentioned that it goes with chili. I also like it with lots of different soups, like ham and bean.  With five kids, I find it's a great way to stretch many meals. I have substituted whole wheat flour for part of the white flour with good results.  If you would like to decrease the sugar, I have cut the sugar in half and nobody seemed to mind.  Also, I find that my 11-year-old son is able to handle making this recipe with a little supervision.  It's always nice to have a hand.  Enjoy!

It's a good basic cornbread recipe.  Mine came out moist on the inside and a little crispy on the outside - perfect.  The flavor is good, but a little lacking.  Next time I'll probably use some honey and buttermilk to add a little extra flavor.

This was really good cornbread, I changed a few things. I switched out half of the flour for wheat flour, half of the sugar for brown sugar, and half of the oil for applesauce. Turned out great! Made delicious muffins :)

This isn't bad, but it's not as good as a real Southern style cornbread recipe that I have and may submit one day. I would recommend cutting the sugar/sweetener to 1/3 of what's in the recipe. That's the biggest problem with most cornbread recipes - too sweet. But for Yankees this would be a good transition to the real thing.

This was very tasty! I was looking for a light corn bread that my cornbread-hating husband might like- he hasn't tried it yet, but I like it. I used white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, and brown sugar instead of white. Then I covered it with butter and honey and ate it all by itself. Yum!

This is a fantastic cornbread recipe!  The best!  We added finely chopped onions for added flavor and moisture and also used our cast iron skillet to bake it in (had to cut the recipe by 1/3).  A keeper for sure!

To make a smaller amount, I halved this recipe and poured the batter into a bread pan (smaller/deeper) instead of a 9 x 13 pan.  I was worried about it maybe not cooking all the way through but it turned out beautifully!  Otherwise, I followed the original recipe.  The only thing I may try next time is to add half cup of fresh sweet corn (when in season) for some extra texture.  This bread is fantastic to accompany any creamy soup, black bean and ham soup or chili.  It wasn't too sweet, too moist, too dry.  We loved it as is...and I am usually never satisfied with recipes the first time.

I've made this as-is, and I agree with other reviewers that it's also a great base recipe for experimentation. My latest variation was a low-fat, non-dairy, non-wheat version (applesauce instead of oil, rice milk instead of dairy, masa harina in place of flour, and egg substitute just because I was out of eggs). That also worked well, if you need to adapt the recipe for dietary needs.

Very good texture, not too crumbly. I would have liked a little more corn flavor but I would still make it again.

This was my first time making cornbread from scatch.  It was wonderful.  I used it to make my cornbread dressing.  I cant wait to make it again for chili.  One thing I did note was that the recipe doesnt say when to put the 1/2 cup oil in.  I put it in with the cornmeal and milk before I added it to the flour mixture.

Everyone loved this.  I followed the recipe exactly - (only mixing it until combined - not 5 minutes like the old recipe apparently said to do.)  It came out light & fluffy.  Perfect sweetness.  Great recipe!

This was so good, i made this cornbread as muffins tonite to go with a beef lentil stew it was awesome. Added brown sugar and white sugar half and half. let cornmeal sit in milk 10mins and beat it a lil longer , it wasnt too dense and just the right of sweetness.

Very nice. The kind that I grew up with. I hate when cornbread is too sweet and was happy to find this one was not. This one is a perfect side dish. Mmmm!

Well I'm not sure how people got a dry bread out of this...it's very moist and tender. I like the flavor. The reviewers who said it isn't "very" anything are right. It's just a balanced flavor. I made muffins out of mine, and was perplexed for awhile about why the bottoms got overdone before the tops got done, and then I remembered I switched out the sugar for Splenda. So note to self: (Cook at a lower temp if using all Splenda). Thanks for the recipe! EDIT 11/19/10: This is still our favorite recipe for cornbread. I add just 1/2 cup sugar for a not-too-sweet version, and the full 2/3 for a sweet version (we like both kinds, but with different entrees). Soaking the cornmeal really does make all the difference here -- the cornbread comes out so tender, moist, and fluffy, that it's almost a shame I'm busy dehydrating a batch in the oven for Thanksgiving dressing :=) All that work putting the moistness in just so I can take it back out -- but this is bar none the best cornbread recipe I've tried from here, easily modified to anyone's tastes. Sub melted butter for oil if you like it buttery; or sub buttermilk for milk and switch the baking powder to 1 1/2 tsp. baking powder + 1 1/2 tsp. baking SODA. Do not straight sub whole wheat into this recipe without adding EXTRA liquid, though, I've done that & wasn't impressed with my results. Thanks again for our favorite cornbread!

This is THE BEST cornbread recipe. The only thing I did differently was follow another reviewer's suggestion and beat the mixture for 4 or 5 minutes with my hand mixer. I've made this twice in just over a week, and both times the hubby has raved about it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the suggestions about beating for 5 minutes, using half brown sugar, switching the amounts of flour and cornmeal, and lowering the oven temp. The texture was good and the taste wasn't bad, but it still lacked flavor.

Needs much more sugar... I gave it 4 cause it was easy and this was my first time making corn bread.  ??? do i add the eggs and oil then add to the batter?  do i mix the eggs as to scramble then add oil does it matter?  as you can see i am a beginner cook.   Next time I will cut in half and add nibblets.

I made these to serve with chili.  They were good by themselves but not with chili since they were sweet.  Will make them again.  They will probably make good cornbread muffins, too.

I did think 2/3 cups sugar was a LOT so I changed it down to 2 tablespoons and it was still sweet but it was ate, I'll tell you that. It did a good job but I think I'll stick to good old country cornbread.

This was very easy to make.  I followed the recipe as listed but allowed 10 minutes for the corn meal and milk to sit.  My husband loved the bread and I think I am going to make it for Thanksgiving this year.

Thought this was very good...only had about 1 1/4 cups of cornmeal so added more flour.  Also used 1/3 c honey and 1/3 c. sugar.  Used 2 cups of milk since I added about 1/2 can of creamed corn...Place pan in oven for about 10 mins. then sprayed it and added the mix.  Baked for almost 30 mins - but could have taken it out earlier. Very tasty - I like mine sweeter - but have to let others eat it too!! LOL

This was exactly what I was looking for in a cornbread recipe. I had just made chili and forgotten to make cornbread to go with it, so I scurried around to quickly find a straightforward recipe that I could whip up. This was it! I topped mine with a bit of butter and honey and it was so good. My mom was in heaven...lol.

I followed the recipe exactly and was very displeased. My boyfriend (who will eat anything) didn't even ask about seconds or leftovers. :( It was bland, the outside was rubbery and the inside was too wet. I tried to cook it longer thinking maybe it wasn't done, but then the outside turned hard. Perhaps it was the fact that I used rough organic style cornmeal instead of the store bought boxed stuff?

This recipe has become one of my "famous" dishes to serve to friends & family. It's so easy and everyone always RAVES about it!  I usually make the standard recipe but this last time it was for a party so I made them in mini muffin tins - same temperature but reduced cooking time to 10mins - so tasty and easy to serve to a crowd.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe :)!!!

This cornbread was a very big hit at my house. The only change I made was to brush a little melted butter on top of it during the last 5-10 minutes of baking and it was great.

This was so good. More like cake than cornbread. I reduced it to 12 servings and used splenda/sugar mix and it was delicious. I cooked it in a black iron skillet. I loved the texture.

A great starter recipe, though I would make quite a few changes. I love the idea of using half white and half brown sugar, adding a little honey, and substituting some of the oil for butter. It has a light corn flavor that slowly builds, so for more of an initial punch I would do as suggested and use more corn meal and less flour. The texture is fantastic and I love that lightly crunchy crust!

My baking powder may have been bad, so it turned out more like a spoon bread.  Still pretty good though.  Next time I'll turn the temp down to 375, teh outside was a little crunchier than I like it.

Thank you, i've been looking for a cornbread recipe that would impress my grandmother, she loved but she said it wasn't "cornmealy" enough. made it again and added 1/2 cup cornmeal and less 1/2 flour. the bread was a little heavier but had the texture and taste she was looking for. great recipe thank you

Very good. I like my corn bread a little sweeter though. Maybe I'll experiment with creamed corn next time.

This was a great recipe. We made them into mini muffins to go along with a lentil chili, they were such a hit! I made a couple of changes though. I used vanilla rice milk and soaked the cornmeal for about 15-20 min, whisking occasionally, before I continued on with the instructions. also, I used the suggestion of using half white sugar and half brown sugar. This recipe was sweet, moist and not too dense at all!

Good texture and was moist. I used 1 cup white flour and 1 cup masa harina(mexican corn flour). I usually cut the sugar amounts in recipes, but instead I thought this could have used a bit more than called for.

Hands down the best cornbread we've tried.  Subtle sweetness and soft interior stays well with the crunchy exterior.

I substituted soy milk for milk and it was pretty darn good. dense and crumbly- but in a good chewy kind of way. Served with smart balance and Chicken Taco soup from this site.  not a great muffin recipe- but a good in pan on the table dish.

This was a great recipe. It was very moist. I substituted 3/4 of a cup of the milk with the juice from a can of corn, and also added the corn. I also chopped up some wickles (wicked sweet pepper strips) and added those, they added a little bit of a kick. But, I think that it would have been just as good without those. I would like to add a tip to making cornbread. I bake my cornbread in a cast iron skillet. I put a little bit of canola oil in the skillet and put it in the oven while it is preheating. The hot oil makes the crust crispy, and it doesn't stick. DELICIOUS!!!

I made this recipe as directed, including beating the batter for a full 5 minutes.  It came out dry and crumbly.  We didn't eat much of it with our chili.  I ended up using the uneaten portion to make cornbread stuffing a couple of nights later.  The cornbread stuffing was decent.  Overall, I think this cornbread is too dry and not sweet enough for my taste.  Will continue to search for better recipes.

This was a really good recipe.  I read the reviews, and I did increase the sugar to 1 cup. I think it would have been fine with the original amount. I also melted butter, and honey and brushed over the top-once the bread was done cooking.  This was really great.  My husband took some of the leftovers to work, and one man said it was the best cornbread he had ever tasted.  What a compliment! Thank you for a great recipe.

This cornbread was ok, but very easy to make if you don't have yeast. I divided the sugar into half brown and half white, per someone's suggestion. I think that helped. Also it was a bit on the flour side. Other than that it was good and I will make it again.

This was pretty good. I had to make mine into muffins, and they had a crispy outside with a soft insidse. Very good contrast of texture. The only thing I would change is to put more sugar in next time. I like my cornbread nice and sweet.

This is probably the best Cornbread I've ever had.  My husband made it for us and both of us loved it.  However, if you don't like sweet, you should take out some sugar.

This was the perfect combination of sweet and savory for me!  There are only two of us, so I made the whole recipe, but split it into two 8x8 pans instead of a 9x13 so I could pop one in the freezer for another time.  I cooked them for about 23 minutes and they were perfectly moist.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

I can only say how stunning this recipe is.  It had the best crispy edges and moist middle. I used a 9x9 pan, and it was so dense and flavorful.  I like it better than flat thin cornbread.

Finally a cornbread my husband will eat! he usually complains about them being to dense and dry - this one turned out great. I did follow the suggest by another reviewer to seperate the eggs and beat the whites seperately and add them at the ene otherwise followed recipe exactly.  Will be making this one again.

Made this recipe from my own stone ground corn that had been canned in 1993.  My husband and I looked at three different recipes worrying that the old corn would not taste good.  This one is the winner.  It was fabulous.

I made this on last whim tonight and was short 1/2 c. of cornmeal.  So I omitted 1/2 c. of milk.  This bread was delicious!  We normally have some left over, but the kids cleaned up the whole pan.  Great recipe, thanks!

My husband likes a sweet light cornbread that he refers to as Johnny Cake... so I've been looking for awhile for a recipe (besides the Jiffy Mix box). This wasn't it. Based on the reviewers comments, I was expecting a "fluffy" cornbread, which this was not. 
I needed a pan of cornbread & followed the reviewers recommendations to mix the ingredients for 5 minutes. It added air all right - which developed into pockets  - resulting in an uneven top of the pan. At 30 minutes the pan was still pretty pale - so my total backing time was extended to 34 muinutes. The cornbread was done, but it was VERY dense. There are other recipes out there - most notably Golden Sweet cornbread. I'll probably make it the next time and hang this one up as a good try.

Great cornbread!  I followed other member suggestions and switched the cornmeal with the flour.  Since the only pan I have is 10 x 13 NOT 9 x 12, I decided to bake it in a glass loaf pan.  Living in high altitude, i extended the baking time to 1 hour at 425 and it came out great!  A wonderful accompiament to a hot bowl of beef stew.  Comfort food on a cold winter night.  How I love winter cooking!  Thanks again.

This is my keeper cornbread recipe.  I accidentally added twice the amount of sugar and salt.  It still tasted good and was very moist, although it made it very chewy.

My new cornbread recipe.  I was actually just looking for a basic recipe to use as a base for cornbread dressing.  I used the one off the back of the Aunt Jemima cornmeal bag yesterday and it was AWFUL.  So, i turned to good ol Allrecipes today and found this recipe.  Just enough sweetness.  I cut back a little on the sugar since I was doing this for dressing, but will use the full amount when making cornbread for the family.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was easy and tasty.

I made this cornbread last night without any changes. I found it to be very dense and moist. I like the fact that it doesn't crumble as you butter it. It is not overly sweet and would go well with pretty much anything. It got rave reviews from husband and kids, I thought it was good.

This is great bread! My husband loves cornbread so I know he'll flip over this. Reduced the recipe to 8 servings and baked in an 8x8 dish for 25 minutes. Turned out perfectly!

This came out great. I halved it to only make enough for four, used brown sugar (as Grandma always did) and I greased the pan with bacon grease. This went well
with my homemade chili mac.

Loved the recipe!  I cut everything in half so it would not make so much and it turned out great.  Nice and fluffy and just enough sweetness.

What I liked about this recipe: It's super quick and easy! It made a nice, dense cornbread and came out well the first time.  I added 3 sliced jalapeños, and it turned out great.  What I did not like as much: the flavor did not taste very "corny" to me.  Maybe I'd add more cornmeal or some corn to the mix in the future.

this has got to be the moistest cornbread! I have tried ALOT of cornbread recipies and this is by far the best.The old saying that cornbread is so dry it just about caves your head in to swallow, and that if its moist it isnt cornbread its CAKE..certainly doesnt apply here. This is definatley moist,sweet,great textured cornbread!

Maybe it's because I'm a true southern gal but I wasn't that impressed with this cornbread.  It wasn't bad it just wasn't as good as I expected with all the great reviews.  I think if I make it again I'm going to adjust the amounts of cornmeal and flour and add a little "southern" bacon grease in place of some of the oil.  Definitely bake in an iron skillet.

Delicious and very moist!!  I ommited 1/2 cup of the corn meal just because I thought it would be too much.  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  It's a keeper.

A fantastic cornbread with a lovely flavor and texture. Followed the recipe to the letter, and beat the mix for 5 minutes before baking. Highly recommended, and a great basic bread amendable to variations.

I made this recipe exactly as written and beat the batter for 10+ minutes.  I didn't care for this recipe at all.  The cornbread was very dense after cooked and did not have enough corn flavor.

This was a good recipe, but nothing that I was overwhelmingly pleased with. If you're looking for a good go-to recipe for cornbread, this would be one to keep on-hand. Be advised, though, that it doesn't keep well. Twenty-four hours after baking it the bread was already inedible.

This is a great basic recipe but it makes too much for my small family so I cut the recipe in half and used my 8" cast iron skillet to bake.  A more traditional method of baking, make sure you preheat your skillet as you are heating up your oven, I used vegetable shortening just before putting in the batter.  When it sizzles, you know it's gonna be good!  I also reduced the sugar just a bit and instead of adding vegetable oil to the batter, I added melted butter. C'mon - this is cornbread!  Used whipped organic butter with honey when serving.  Family loves this with good old Tuna Noodle Casserole.

This corn bread was not very good! I took everyones advice and switched the flour and cornrnmeal amounts. It did not work for me. I soaked the cornmeal as directed. The bread came out flat and dry.

This was a VERY dense bread.  I beat it for the full 5 minutes that was recommended, but still really wet and dense.  More like a pound cake than a corn bread.

Really good!  Very sweet and moist.  I didn't have yellow cornmeal on hand, so I used white cornmeal.  I split the batter - one to include pieces of corn and the other to be just as written.  I actually liked it better without the corn pieces.  I missed the cornmeal texture a little bit, but the taste of sweet corn was there.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Next time, I will try it with the yellow cornmeal.

I followed the alterations that JWGASA suggested at it turned out perfect!!! Especially with the melted butter and honey. A good way to put a little more flavour into the corbread is to add a small pinch of paprika. I also found that covering the grease in the pan with bread crumbs makes the crust crispier.

OH MY!!! This is DELICIOUS...I've been looking for a cornbread recipe for years and I've found it. After taking it out of the oven I slathered Honey Butter (from this website) and it not only made it taste AMAZING but it gave the golden corn bread a beautiful glaze! WOW AMAZING =) THANK YOU

This is excellent cornbread - SO moist and full of flavor. I'm going to reduce the sugar to about 1/3 cup next time. We like to top ours with butter & brown sugar, so the cornbread itself doesn't need to be very sweet.

First time making cornbread..this recipe is absolutely OUTSTANDING!!!  Some adjustments made:  switch the measurements for cornmeal and flour, substituted melted butter for the oil, added 2/3's of the sugar and the remaining 1/3 honey.  Definitely let the cornmeal soak for at least 15 minutes and mix all the ingredients for the full 5 minutes in stand mixer.  Served with homemade chili...RAVE REVIEWS from the family.

good, cake-y cornbread.  Fry up some bacon next day and then brown leftover cornbread slices in the bacon grease. Crumble bacon over and Pour warmed maple syrup over all.  Mmmmm...good reason to have the leftovers from this large recipe.

I was highly disappointed in this recipe. It tastes more like corncake than cornbread.  The texture is smooth and dense , not crumbly or that nice cornmeal texture.  If I were to make this again I would reduce the amount of flour and egg by half

Yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly and this is by far the best corn bread I've ever made.  I did mix it for five minutes as suggested and it just melts in your mouth.  I don't like greasy cornbread, and this is not greasy, just very moist.  I'm even eating the leftovers for breakfast!  Thanks for submitting this recipe!

I usually don't like cornbread because it's crumbyly, but I loved this kind. It's soft, moist, and delicious. There is no need to change the recipe at all because it is perfect.

Great recipe!  I used 2 c cornmeal and 1 1/2 c flour, and cut the sugar to 1/2 c.  I think the oil can also be reduced to 1/3 or even 1/4 c because mine was oily on the surface.  Delicious even when I didn't have any spreads!

This was a great recipe. I used different flours; spelt, brown rice and tapioca instead of wheat and soy milk and margarine to make it wheat and dairy free (cuz i'm just like that) and it still came out really well. thanks!

This is fantastic!  So sweet and moist.  I substituted almond milk to make non-dairy and everyone raved.

The best corn bread I've made!  This is my go-to recipe for corn bread from now on.  When I feel like going lower fat, I sub some low-fat sour cream for some of the oil, which makes it even more moist!  Can't beat that!

This has become our all-time favorite cornbread recipe! It is the only one I use. I hear "Oh, wow, you made *your* cornbread! (That is a huge compliment for me, a born and bred Yankee, haha) I don't change a thing except the cornmeal usually sits mixed with the milk for longer than the 5 minutes as directed in the recipe.

I read the reviews and thought it might be a little dry, so I added 3 tablespoons cream cheese to the milk and blended it. I also dotted it with butter on top half way through cooking. I will definitely make this again. It is dry without butter on it but I'm going to keep working on it. It turned out beautifully in photos!

This was pretty good, and I was pleased considering it's the first time I've made cornbread that wasn't from a mix!  I halved the recipe and added a touch more salt, plus I used applesauce for half the oil.  Also, I don't have an electric mixer so couldn't beat the batter for 5 minutes.  Regardless, the cornbread is quite tender and lovely.  Next time I'm going to swap the amounts of flour and cornmeal so it has a bit more of the texture I expect from cornbread, and also add honey because we love honey sweetened cornbread. 1/4 cup of frozen corn kernels would be a great addition as well. All in all, I quite liked this recipe and think I'll hang onto it!

Yum! I've never eaten cornbread before!! Now I'm going to make and eat this often! I cut the recipe in half. Whipped the eggs very well first. Whipped the batter before pouring it into the baking dish as well. It came out beautifully soft with a lovely crunchy crust and lovely cakey texture. Took only 20 minutes to bake.

This is simply soooooooooooooo delicious!  It is THE BEST CORNBREAD EVER!!!! I soaked the cornmeal in the milk for about 15 minutes and beat it for the full 5 minutes.  I baked it for 30 minutes and it was light in color- but perfectly cooked.  This is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO goood!!!!!!
Thank you!!

WONDERFUL!!!!!! I have never made cornbread before, and my husband was leary of this recipe because he is used to the old southern cornbread. I'm new to cooking, and it made me feel great when he said "this is the BEST cornbread I've ever had". :-) Top with butter/honey spread...delicious! Very moist. I have never liked cornbread before this, and now I love it! Goes great with the "Flatlander Chili" recipe on this site.

Perfect cornbread even with my modifications to make it a little lighter. Used splenda for sugar and applesauce in place of the oil. Made a nice cakey consistency and crispy crust. A little honey on top, yumm!

I replaced the sugar with honey, as my husband doesn't tolerate sugar. Wonderful! You can cut back the honey a bit as well, to around half a cup.

We found this recipe to be rather bland. My husband, who LOVES cornbread, wasn't wild about it. We prefer the "Golden Sweet Cornbread" recipe from this site. It is sweeter and more cake-like.

This is it! I have been trying to make corn bread for my husband for the past 8 years. Nothing is as good as his Grandmother's (they are from Texas)! When I read this recipe and reviews I fgured it had to be close. The ingredients are about the same as any other corn bread, but the soaking of the corn meal totally changes the texture. It is more dense and almost chewy compared to the fluffy cake like corn bread I usually make. Whahoo! I'm so glad I finally found this recipe! Because you know, in our house, we can't have chili or any soup without corn bread!

I fixed this to go with pot roast recently.  I followed the directions to the "T" and it came out very dense.  It reminded me of "fry bread".  I'll not fix it again.  It did have a good flavor though if you like your cornbread on the heavier side.

Pretty good cornbread...I took others' suggestions of increasing the cornmeal to 2 cups and reducing the flour to 1 1/2 cups.  I soaked the cornmeal in the milk for 10 minutes and then whisked everything for 5 minutes, as recommended.  I found the bread still to be a little dense.

This recipe was wonderful. I'm not a huge fan of cornbread because it's usually too dry, but this was moist and delicious. I made a few changes: I made it with rice milk (soy & dairy allergy), and with canola oil instead of vegetable oil. I also reduced the sugar to 1/3c. so that it isn't a sweet style cornbread. I'll make this over and over again!

Amazing! Tastes so moist and sweet, it was absolutely perfect! I am vegan, so I used egg substitute and vanilla soymilk and it turned out perfectly! I made a double batch and served it with some vegan chili for a Halloween party, it was all gone before any of the other food! Will definitely make again, thanks for the recipe!

So delicious and moist.  Serve warm with butter and honey.  We put it in the fridge so it keeps longer and then heat it up in the microwave, and it maintains its texture well.  Life is always better on the homestead!

Good taste, not too sweet. I came out very dense though and I'd like something with a lighter texture. It tasted like a sweetish fluffy polenta. The batter looked a little too wet to me but I followed the recipe exactly for a change. I even followed the submitters advice to beat for 5 min. to "lighten it". I think that is a really good base and I will work with it to see if I can get what I'm looking for. This recipe has good flavor and it isn't too grainy like some others. I think that soaking the cornmeal is the key here.

Very good! I cut the recipe to fit in an 8x8 pan and we enjoyed it with chili. Everyone loved this cornbread. A little more work than opening a box but definitely healthier and I enjoy cooking from scratch for my family :)

Wonderful, easy recipe.  Made for a BBQ and it was a big hit. It was so moist and tasty.   I plan to try with the 50/50 flour next.  Thank you

I loved this cornbread. At thanksgiving in 2006 I used this recipe for my dressing in the turkey and add the favorites to finish out the stuffing mix. My family loved the dressing. I will continue to use this recipe. 
Great job!!!!

New Found Love For Cornbread.  I tried this recipe with the Butte Creek Mill Cornmeal and was totally surprised at how moist and sweet my cornbread was.  Soaking the cornmeal in the milk is the key and a wonderful tip I am now passing on.  Thank you so much!

This was good, moist cornbread. It had a nice texture and was not too sweet. I'll make this one again. Thanks!

I've been looking for a great corn bread recipe and this was almost perfect. I like my cornbread sweet and while this was sweet, I could have had it sweeter. Still it was moist and the whole family loved it. I made it with a veggie chili recipe from here. I cooked it for 30 mins because I don't like it overdone.

This recipe has become our standard cornbread recipe.  It has just the right amount of sweetness, and is suitably dense and moist.  It's not too crumbly, but I would suggest leaving the corn meal to soak a bit longer to help with the graininess - though perhaps this is a problem with the corn meal I use!  It is, of course, fantastic with butter fresh out of the oven, and my wife discovered it makes a great snack when combines with a few slices of Black Forest ham.  There's no better compliment to a nice big bowl of chili.

Very tasty, wonderful recipe. Everyone I make this for loves it. The last friend I made it for says it tastes more like corn cake! Always moist, pleasantly sweet, good corn flavor too. One update: you might want to store these in the fridge. I had them on the counter, and three days later they got a strange smell and I found mold growing inside (probably because they were so moist)! I think this would have been prevented by being in the fridge. Next time, at least in summer, that's where the leftovers will go.

I make it with skim milk and also use 1 cup whole wheat flour with 1 cup all-purpose flour to make it a little healthier.

This is the best recipe for sweet moist cornbread I have found.  I just made it in to muffins and they probably won't last past today!  Thanks so much!  I've been searching and searching for just this recipe.  I'm bringing the recipe back up here to Canada.  =)

It was yummy and easy to make, but i feel it could have been better. Best right out of the oven, does not sit very well. Not super dense, rather fluffy. But overall pretty good.

I halved this recipe and baked it in a skillet in the oven. I didn't read the directions and just mixed all of the dry and then added the wet along with about a cup of corn. This was light with a great crispy/chewy crust and excellent flavor. It's been a while since I've had good cornbread and this definitely was good.

Great cornbread recipe.  I added a chopped jalapeno (should have done two!).  I also let the cornmeal sit in the milk for around 15 minutes.  The flavor was perfect. Not too sweet.  I made this to go with chili.

I am used to a more light cornbread so the second time around I made it with half a cup less cornmeal and half a cup more flour. I also added another half tablespoon of BP and it lightened up quiet a bit. I also didn't soak the cornmeal I just mixed all my dry and thn just added the wet and then gave it one good stir! It took about 5 minutes to whip up and about 40 minutes to back. I used a 9x13 ceramic dish. Otherwise I loved the sweetness, just enough and it keeps about 3 days with out drying out.

this was very easy and it looked amazing when i first took it out of the oven and cut it up. unfortunately it sat out for about 20 minutes and it very quickly became stale-like around the edges..i've never had that happen with any cornbread recipe before. still it tasted the way corn bread should.

This is my new cornbread recipe.  I halved the recipe and had plenty for my family of four.  Cornbread is moist, not dry or grainy.  It was also sweet how I like it.

I truly dislike cornbread; however, this recipe is wonderful.  I made one change by mistake, I doubled the soak time for the cornmeal (was helping kids with homework and lost track of time). It is not at all gritty like other recipes.  This one is a keeper - thank you for sharing!

YUM YUM!!!  Loved this recipe.  I, too, cut the recipe in half and made muffins.  Just the right amount of sweetness, and a little cake-like, which I love.  Will definitely make again!

I was in a pinch and needed a recipe that I didn't need to run to the store for, I was a bit dissapointed.  Overall I thought this was a very dense cornbread.  I served at a potluck, and while it was all eaten, there were no raves.  I followed the reviews and mixed batter for 5 min.  I did make half the batch as muffins and baked for 15 min.   I propably will not make again.

Easy to make, but not what I was looking for. It was very very dense and it tasted kind of funny...not sure if it was too sweet, or not sweet enough. It was just weird corn bread for me. I will keep on looking for others!

Will not make again.  Nothing special - very boring.  Not sweet enough to be sweet cornbread, and certainly not regular corn bread - somewhere in between.  Nothing special about the texture - mine was not particularly dense or moist.  I followed the recipe and other's recommendations to let the cornmeal soak for 15 minutes. The only modification that I made besides that is that I added corn to mine.  Slightly disappointing considering the hype.

I'm sorry, but I soaked the cornmeal, beat it a more the second time and it still came out heavy and mushy in the middle. I thought it was an error on my part the first time,  so I gave it another try, nope it was equally as bad. I feel bad for wasting good ingredients plus my time. I'm glad you others enjoyed it.

EXCELLENT recipe. I didn't have any cornmeal, so I used 1 1/2 boxes of Jiffy to replace the cornmeal and it still came out great. Very thick, moist and full of flavor. I will definitely use this recipe for Thanksgiving/Christmas this year.

Very good cornbread!  I made it exactly how the recipe says, except I soaked the cornmeal for 15 minutes.  It turned out great and is good the next day with honey on top of it.

Great recipe! I substituted organic whole wheat flour and date sugar. Appearence changed, but the taste was great!  Next time I think I'll add some creamed corn as one of the other reviewers suggested.

i made this recipe the other day with a batch of chili to take to my husband's office for all the starving guys...i was embarrassed by the cornbread!  it was very bland...the texture was good tho, not dry like alot of cornbread...i'll definitely add something more to this recipe the next time, like maybe creamed corn and cheddar cheese as one reviewer suggested...

This cornbread comes out very dense and heavy-- more like a cake than cornbread.  It tastes good, but it's so heavy that one slice is like a whole meal.  I think I'll look for something a little lighter next time.

Very good.  I put the cornmeal in the milk and brought it to the boil before using it in the recipe so it didn't taste gritty but it went down really well at a Cowboy Cookout I did.

This really was the best cornbread that I have ever tasted. I loved how it was soft in the inside and crisp on the outside. I tried the reviewers suggesting of switching the amounts on cornmeal and flour. I am curious though what this would taste like with the original amounts. I will have to try it.

What a delicious recipe!  I made a whole-grain version by using whole wheat flour and stone-ground cornmeal, and the results were fantastic--very moist and excellent flavor.  Yum, thank you so much for sharing this!

This went directly in the garbage.  It tasted like sand, though I followed the recipe exactly...I don't get it.

This recipe deserves a BLUE RIBBON!   Family fell in love with it the first time I made it--and they even made it the following day it was so good.  I like it especially with the recipe for Chicken Tortilla Soup I on this site.

This really is awesome cornbread. I had to substitute a small amount of brown sugar because I ran out of sugar the first time I made it and liked it better. I used a couple Tbsp of brown and cut the overall sugar down.

This was REALLY good!  Even my very picky four year old loved it!  I did make one change, I used Stone Ground Whole Wheat flour instead of regular...DELICIOUS!  A Keeper!

This was really great cornbread and stayed moist for a couple of days wrapped up in the refrigerator.  Great just by itself.

Let me start off by saying that a 5-year-old could make this corn bread.  It is SO easy and SO tasty!  I made it for the Super Bowl this year along with my Turkey Chili and got glowing compliments from everyone at the party.  This recipe has the perfect combination of sweetness and heartiness.  I will definitely be making it again soon!

I thought that this cornbread was fantastic, and I didn't change the recipe at all. Next time I will swap the amounts of flour and cornmeal just to try it. I covered with saran wrap and it was moist and fresh the next day.

This was a great recipe!! I did follow the advise of the other reviewers. I switched the flour and cornmeal amounts. Also, I had a 1/2 pint of whipping cream that I needed to use, so I used 1c of that then added 1 1/2 c of regular milk. Usually I used buttermilk in cornbread, so I guess the whipping cream evened it out. I put veg. oil in my glass pan, covered the pan and then poured the extra into my milk mixture (after the meal had soaked in milk for 10 min). I also added a tablespoon of vanilla (just to see what would happen). This turned out great!! great color, great texture!! My family loved it. This is definately a keeper!!

This is what I always thought cornbread should taste like.  It was sweet without being overpowering, and moist.  It wasn't gritty or cake-y.  It was wonderfully, sinfully delightful.   *Unfortunately it did not keep well overnight and there is quite a lot of it so I had thought it would keep better.  It dried out and lost its wonderful crust.  I wrapped in damp paper towel and microwaved it for a few seconds and it regained enough moisture to be great again, but make sure everyong eats it right out of the oven for the full experience.

A very nice, sweet cornbread. Because of it's sweetness, it doesn't take additions like jalepenos well, but very nice as-is.

Great!  I made these into muffins instead,and with a little trial and error on how to bake them, the end result was very good.  I did add 1 cup of sugar, too.  Do NOT use muffin paper cups for this.  Pour 1/4 cup of batter into each well greased section and bake at 400* for 20 minutes. Makes 22-24 muffins.  Delicious.

This was pretty moist, not quite as good as Boston Market's. I forgot to spray the non-stick pans so it stuck a little. I made it in two round nine inch pans instead of the 9x13. Served with homemade honey butter and chili mac. Yum!

Wonderful. Do not plan to make any other cornbreads. Too good!!! The best secret for me though is bake it in your cast iron skillet. -Update- it is a few years later and I am still making this. I have changed to making it muffin style d/t to time and space restraints but still reliable.

I made this for a party and it went quickly, the only problem I had was that the top was browning and the middle 2 pieces were still kind of raw and I had to throw them out, I would use a 9X11 and not an 8X8 like I did! Yummy though!

Easy and very moist. My teenage son loved it! I liked it, but thought it might need more cornmeal and less flour next time. It had a definite cake-like consistency from the flour. Overall a good recipe.

This was good, but I prefer my cornbread sweeter.  I didn't read the instructions correctly and made it in an 8 x 8 inch pan and it took forever to cook, but it gave the outside a nice little crunch!

I used  my  2.2 Qt. Pyrex rectangle baking dish and used bread flour. It was delicious. My husband told me several times how good it was and how he was going to take some to work for the guys. Of course I have to make more since it is almost gone. My picky 7 yr old loves it too.

The best cornbread I've ever made. I've used it in stuffing at Thanksgiving and served it on its own, and it's always a hit. I find it works great for sopping up the sauce in Gerry's Enchilada's (on this site) and other saucy dishes. It's also just sweet enough to eat plain, and nice and moist!

The flavor of this cornbread was good. It was not as moist as my usual recipe (which was temporarily packed away, if you wonder why I didn't just use that!). It was a decent recipe and earned a solid three stars.

I followed this recipe exactly, and used the resulting bread as a side dish.  

This cornbread *is* very moist, and it certainly does hold-together in cleanly cut pieces.  The flavor, too, is fine...though not remarkable.  Most problematic about the cornbread that resulted from this recipe was the rubberiness that I assume is the result of lots of milk and lots of flour.  Butter, honey, and our other toppings didn't soak in; they just ran off the sides.  

I prefer a crisp crust outside and a soft, somewhat crumbly (and absorbent) inside, and so I will not be making this recipe again.

We love this cornbread!  Very moist.  I use Ener-G egg replacer...I'm sure it would work w/soymilk to make it a completely vegan recipe.  I always make it with "Insanely Easy Vegetarian Chili", which is also an awesome and easy recipe.

I agree with the reviewers that said this had no flavor whatsoever.  It was moist enough, but it mostly just tasted like flour with a hint of sweetness.  The only apt word is blah!

Not bad at all, though I found it a little bit bland. Maybe I'll add some real corn next time. It's sweet with a nice texture, not too crumbly. I sprinkled some sugar on top and baked it for 30mins (at high altitude). It didn't turn out too cakelike at all like some mentioned. My husband liked it, too, though he prefers the real corn muffins I usually make.

This wasn't bad, but still just not what I'm looking for....it is moist and stays together, but was a little too dense.  I'll keep looking.

I have always had trouble making cornbread.  This was an easy recipe and most of all my family loved it.  My son does not like regular milk so I substituted with Soy milk and it was delicious.

easy and tasty.

I use the Aunt Jemima's self rising corn meal, so I just leave out the salt and baking powder.

I suggest putting a cast iron skilet or dutch oven in the oven during pre-heat.  Then take it out, spray it with non-stick vegi oil, then pour the batter in, place in oven. It gives it a nice crust.

It gets rave reviews every time I make it.

Very good, moist, dense, slightly sweet cornbread.  My husband poured some real maple syrup over it and gave it a thumbs up.

This one was GREAT!  I used it in a Texas-theme meal.  I discovered that I was out of Vegetable Oil, so used Olive oil instead and it was still yummy.  WARNING:  Because of the high milk content, it does not keep well at room temp.  It will become very stinky, slimy and GROSS if left on counter for a week by your ungrateful visiting relatives. Eaten FRESH, its VERY YUMMY!

If you like moist and flavorful, this is for you.  I chopped up a small, well-drained can of crisp corn and added it with minced dried onion for a great corn cake result.  Delicious, and everybody loved it, even the kids.

I thought this was nothing to write home about.  It came out very dense and almost uncooked.  I even beat it for 5 minutes as others had suggested to no avail.  I'll not make this again, and I will keep searching for a good cornbread recipe..  Disappointing.

Not the greatest cornbread I've ever had. I was looking for a more cake like texture. I found this spongy and dry. It also had very little taste to it. Will not be making these again.

I've been making this for several months now, and I can't tell you how many people have asked me for this recipe. I refer them to this site! This is so wonderful, quick and easy!!! I am just writing the review now because I pulled it up in my recipe box yet again to make it with some beef stew..just perfect.

I didn't care for this cornbread. I've always used the recipe on the side of the box of cornmeal. I didn't realize how great my cornbread was actually turning out until I tried the Homesteaders recipe....it was like a dense brick. But maybe that's what everyone else likes about it(?)

My husband and I live off of Jiffy Cornbread, but I wanted to try something different for a true down home meal.  My husband said it's the best cornbread he has ever had, even compared to his southern grandma's homemade cornbread.  I like it and I made it for coworkers as well.  They enjoyed it, too.  Thank you!

I thought this recipe was good, however, my husband didn't like it at all, though he is still stuck on the boxed variety his mother used to make--I'm trying to convince him homemade is better!!  I didn't change anything, however if I make it again, I will halve the recipe, as it made entirely too much for the two of us.  I also think it could have a bit more of a cornmeal taste, so I may substitute some of the flour for more cornmeal.  Overall, a good recipe that I will try again with some small changes here and there.

I could not get over how quick and simple this was to make. Both my wife and I love it. She has even gone as far as to say, "It is as good or better than a famous restaurant we go to in Port Orange, Florida, when we are on vacation"!!

My friend brought me a chunk of this with some Taco Soup she made from this web site too.....I said, "I think this is the best cornbread I've ever tasted...and the MOST moist".  She said, 'Hmmm, that's fuuny...the comment from the submitter of the recipe said the very same thing!!"

Excellent cornbread!  Served it with Tex-Mex corn Chowder, also from allrecipies.com, and both were a big hit.  I took the advise of other reviewers and halved the recipe and it was plenty.  Will make this again and again.

My boyfriend and I made this the night before thanksgiving to take to dinner. It was excellent when coming out of the oven. We made half with fresh jalepeno slices. One review said that it was dry the next day so we covered it with a moist towel and in a container to help prevent it from drying out. But it didn't help--if you make this, eat it right away and it is excellent, IT DOES NOT KEEP!!!

When it is said that this is "the best" corn bread ever...its the truth! Even my 10 year old son mentioned how moist and good it was.
The only corn bread recipe I will use from now on!

I made muffins for Thanksgiving and they came out very good.  However, they don't stay too well.  Later in the day they could've been weapons, but that may have been due to the cold weather.  I will definitely make again just to be sure!

I made this cornbread as part of a southern dinner at my sister's house. It was okay, but nobody complimented me on it or anything. I guess it was just your typical cornbread. No offense, but nothing to rave about. However, I noticed that, within a few days, it had already begun to mold.

Best cornbread I ever tasted! Took others' advice and baked it in a 8" cast iron skillet. I sprinkled about a tablespoon of sugar over the top and it browned beautifully. Served with honey butter. YUM!!

Served with honey butter, the first words out of my husband's mouth, "This is incredible!" - Updated review... substituted applesauce for 1/4 of the oil, worked great!  Have also used half white, half wheat flours.  Texture is still wonderful, but the color isn't the bright yellow we're used to with cornbread.

This was amazing!  As a traditional Southern cook, I've been trying to find a cornbread that my both my Yankee husband and I like and this is it!  It's a perfect combination of the two styles.  I fixed it in a cast iron skillet to get the crust I like and took the advice of other reviewers and sprinkled sugar on top.  This was truly the best cornbread I've ever had!

I live this this cornbread, and more importantly, so does my husband! I usually make it at least once a week, and it's the best I've ever tasted. It doesn't crumble all over the place, and tastes great reheated. Best EVER!

 I’ve made other recipes for cornbread  before and the soaking of the cornmeal is the reason their recipe isn’t grainy!

I'm not sure what happened - several reviews suggest the original recipe was changed, because it used to include a 5 minute mixing time. Something else much have changed or this recipe just isn't so great, because I followed the instructions as listed plus beat the batter for an extra minute (it was so wet there was no point doing more, air wasn't incorporating in) and it's very dry, very dense, and quite bland. It's edible at least, but not a 5 star recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly, even noting the original poster's subsequent comment to beat the ingredients for 5 minutes.  Unfortunately, for whatever reason, my cornbread did not rise at all and after 30+ minutes was just a rubbery dense mess of dough.  It was especially unfortunate because my in-laws were here for dinner.  I'll be sticking with grandmother's buttermilk cornbread recipe from this site (only tried this homesteader one because of the larger serving size).

Awesome cornbread!

My husband prefers a bit sweeter, so I will add 3 c. sugar rather than 2 2/3 c. the next time I make this cornbread.  The aftertaste is wonderful!

This cornbread turned out great - I did a dairy free version and used one can of coconut milk and topped off with almond milk to get the 2-1/2 cups.  I also tried the hint where I mixed the milk and corn meal and let it set for about 20 minutes.  Came out super light and fluffy and didn’t fall apart too badly.  A keeper!

This was so delicious! Got requests for seconds from all 5 people in my house... followed the note posted in the comments to mix the batter for five minutes and it absolutely made it light and fluffy. I did reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup and some family members thought it should be a tad sweeter so next time I may use the full 2/3 cup. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was amazing!

This recipe made a light, fine-grained almost cake-like cornbread.  It was very, very good.  I will probably change the corn meal to flour ration to give it more corn flavor next time.  But, it is a very recomendable recipe.  Try it, bet you like it.

I made it exactly. Let milk and cornmeal sit for more than 5 minutes   I let it sit before putting in oven.  it was done 10 minutes early.  It was way too dense. Heavy   Little taste of cornmeal. Embarrassing. Was for company.

This is my favourite recipe. The only things I did differently were 1) add honey to make it slightly sweeter and 2) bake it in a cast iron skillet. Sometimes instead of milk I use almond milk with a squeeze of lime to make a non dairy buttermilk and to me it comes out even better

WOW! Best cornbread I've ever had. My hubby loved it so much I'm making another batch today, just finished the first one yesterday. I soaked the corn meal in milk for 10 minutes, beat the batter for 5 and added a small can of corn. I used a Pyrex pan and lowered the temperature to 375. It came out perfectly at 30 minutes. No crumbling! Wonderful! Will make often.

Very easy, clear recipe and came out as presented.  It is forgiving of improvisation.  I used butter milk instead of milk and mixed in corn kernels from 3 ears.  I reduced the sugar 1/3 by preference.  I froze half and eating  on the other half

It was excellent.  I took the advice of the others—more corn meal, less flour and for me just a little less sugar.  I kept the mixer going for 5 minutes.  Wonderful!

Light and fluffy! Not overly sweet. Just right. I messed up and didn’t soak the corn meal in milk but I have no complaints with how mine turned out. Went perfectly with our jambalaya. Thank you for sharing your recipe. Perhaps the people who thought it was dense need fresh baking powder? Mine rose up beautifully.

Took a few tips from other reviewers - swapped the cornmeal and flour measurements and used half white and half brown sugar. I also ran out of vegetable oil so I subbed in ghee. I baked it in a bread pan instead (I prefer it loafy) and it took about an hour to bake.

The perfect cornbread - I make it a couple times a month. It's turned out perfectly every time. Everyone goes crazy for it. People who don't normally like cornbread love this because it's so light and moist.

I used buttermilk and omitted the sugar, flour., salt and baking powder. I use White Lily cornmeal and I bake mine in a cast iron skillet. It is perfect with my changes.

My favorite cornbread recipe. Always gets rave reviews and requests to make again. I suggest reducing the sugar by half if you add savory mix ins, like bacon pieces, cheese and/or jalapeno. Also, don't ever skip soaking the cornmeal in the milk.

excellent cornbread recipe. I used a 9 inch round pan and it was quite tall, and moist. while soaking the corn meal, I stirred it a lot to help it absorb the milk. I also 2as trying to kill time, so I beat my eggs with a whisk until they were quite fluffy, and added the oil to that, mayonnaise-style, until I had a really nice egg/oil emulsion with lots of air trapped,and then added that to the everything else. I didn't the beat the finished mixture for a long time, just enough to get everything mixed, and it turned out beautifully. I used slightly less sugar than called for, otherwise followed the recipe, and got a nice strong corn flavour. this was probably the best cornbread I've ever made. it's really big, though! I had guests so that worked, but be warned! it makes a lot of cornbread!

Delicious! It's a light and soft corn bread, and easy to make also. The recipe is great, and it came out well. Would recommend starting out with 30 mins in the oven, but overall it's an awesome corn bread recipe! Definitely better than Trader Joe's mix! :)

I loved this. As many others have said, it is not as sweet as most cornbread but I liked the light touch of sweetness. Very airy. Will make again.

This was my 1st time making it, and I took the advice of two people on here.
I halved the recipe so I didn't waste a bunch of ingredients if I did mess up. Did equal parts of cornmeal - flour ratio, substituted the milk for buttermilk, kept whisking every so often the cornmeal and buttermilk. I actually kept it longer than 5 mins together cause I was a mess! But that might've helped moistened the cornmeal better. Sifted flour, baking powder, salt, sugar (1/4 c white sugar) and whisked that. Then added the cornmeal mix, egg, 1/2 c melted butter, and 1/2 drained canned corn. I wasn't sure I did something wrong since my batter was not near runny, I added a bit of vegetable oil, but I think it would've been fine without. With that being said, there was in no way could I use a whisk, so I just used a wooden spatula/spoon to just mix it up. Stuck to the 5 mins mix by hand. Used a glass pyrex loaf, and set the oven at °325. It took a longer than 30 mins, not sure how long I left it in for, but went with the clean fork method and took it out to cool. For my 1st time, it was perfect. Some minor mistakes I could correct myself on, but this is the kind I love and I'm sticking to it.

I read some reviews and I mixed for about 7-8 minutes. Super moist. Also cut the recipe in half and made in a loaf pan.

Just made half the quantity as there are only two of us. Reduced the amt of sugar so the bread was not quite so sweet. It was quite crumbly when hot but settled down once cooled.

This is hands down the best corn bread I've ever tasted! I've been hesitant in the past few years to make corn bread because I always find it so dry and crumbly. This was incredibly moist and so delicious! I checked the comments first and made a few changed to the original recipes. 
1-I used even amounts of cornmeal and flour (1 3/4 cups each)
2-I used 1/4 melted butter and 1/4 vegetable oil.
3-I added maybe 1/4 cup of creamed corn (I was using it in another recipe anyways so thought I'd throw some in here)
4-I beat it for 5 minutes on medium high. This was an important step and you could actually see the batter getting larger in the bowl!
5-while I was beating, I put my 12" cast iron pan in the oven with about 2-3 tbsp of butter. 
I made this 3 days ago to go with some chilli. It's STILL moist and so delicious! I will definitely be making this again!!

No changes. Being a Brit married to a semi southern boy who likes things i have never heard of this was my second cornbread recipe. The first was used once and i swore i would never touch the stuff again it was like eating dust BUT this was amazing and wonderfully moist,  with a big pot of chili it will be a go to recipe from now on...  i am told we are having the left overs with eggs tomorrow morning yet another new experience!

I’m in Canada and have been looking for a recipe that doesn’t call for a box of jiffy cornbread mix. We LOVED this one. I served it with a spicy/sweet pumpkin Chili last night and it went over with the whole family!

Simple, quick and delicious. I almost always have these ingredients on hand. Try substituting applesauce for the oil for a healthier yet equally moist alternative!

Major yum! Soaking the cornmeal first works really well. Don’t overbake- light golden top is perfection .

Just like I remember my grandmother making.  I  let it soak for nearly an hour, not for any reason other than I have little kids! And I only had 1 egg left, so I thought I would try it anyway.   Worked out great.   I'm sure the extra egg would help hold it together more, my batch turned out more like a cake than traditional heavier cornbread, but it was delicious.

Oh my goodness!! I have never had such lovely cornbread.  Soft....almost like a heavy cake, no crumbling apart or dryness.  The level of sugar in the recipe was perfect in my opinion, but if you like sweet cornbread, you may want to add more sugar or honey. Mixing the ingredients with an electric beater for a full 5 min IS THE SECRET!! Seriously...set a timer and do it!  I made it following the ingredients exactly and it was wonderful!  I also made some alterations and it was wonderful too!  The 2nd batch I changed the measurements a little,  cornmeal 1 3/4c and flour 1 3/4c and add 1 can drained sweet corn.  This can be diversified with cheese or peppers, etc. What a fun recipe!  I made this with Southern Ham and brown bean soup from this site and it was too wonderful for words!

This was my first time making corn bread from scratch. Made as suggested. husband loved it. Texture was cakelike and sweet but not too sweet. I did add melted butter before adding batter. Next time want to try iron skillet suggestion just to see.

12/30/18  Sweet, and very moist.  The leftovers remained moist for 4-5 days in its cassorole dish covered with foil.  The first time I made this I used a 9" pie dish.  I wouldn't recommend that, because it won't evenly bake, (batter significantly rises in the center), plus all the batter doesn't fit !  I'd baked it in the toaster oven and the top became crusty.  I like the crunchy crust on top so next time (Today !) I'll turn the broiler on near the end of bake time & see if it 'crusts.'  It's Soup Season so I especially appreciate that the carbs are much lower than other starch (roll, bread, etc.) options.  I sometimes have a piece for dessert, because it is like cake !  I bet it would pair very nicely with ice cream !!  2/4/19  I've made this several times with 2c cornmeal,  and 1.5 cups flour, as another reviewer suggested:  Now That's cornbread !  I still like the 'more like cake version :-)

I love making this cornbread, I find letting the cornmeal really soak up that milk helps grately. If you don’t it will be really gritty.

We liked it fine. As corn cake we’d give it a 4. As a traditional corn bread, a 3. I don’t think i’ll Make it again.

I made this recipe for the first time thanksgiving morning and followed the recipe exactly, and it was completely tasteless.  It tastes like absolutely nothing.  So I made a second batch using the suggestions SargeQ's made in their review of using 2 cups of cornmeal, 1 1/2 cups of flour, and 1 cup of sugar.  Now that cornbread was amazing, but the original recipe has no taste whatsoever.

I followed the recipe as I like to do my first time making a dish. It was … ok. It had a great texture but the flavor was just really bland. Served it with cinnamon honey butter which helped. I’d probably make it again with a few mods because I really did like how moist and dense it was (but not too dense).

It was so bland.  I couldn't eat it.  Thank goodness I baked it the day before Thanksgiving.  I have time to try a different recipe.

I beat the batter for 5 minutes as the recipe submitter suggested.  Really liked it!  I decided to make this recipe because each serving was only 234 calories and it makes a 9x13 pan.  Put some butter on each piece while warm, yum!  Will definitely make this again.

The batter seems that it would be amaizing the problem for me was in the directions I didn’t see that I had to make a well in the flour and mix those things into the dry first so I didn’t get a nice runny batter like seen here I’ll make sure to do that next time

Followed the recipe to the letter and whisked the mixture for five minutes, like other reviewers suggested.  Baked for 30 minutes and it came out really dense.  In fact, it looked like fudge.  No idea what went wrong ; I did wonder if it would have been better in a smaller pan and at a lower temperature.  Won't be using this recipe again.

I changed the baking powder to a combo of baking soda and cream of tartar.  I like the texture better.  I like that this recipe used a higher ratio of cornmeal to flour than most other recipes.

It was a nice moist cornbread but a bit heavy. I think if I beat it longer it might be lighter. 
I’ll make it again.

I've made this recipe several times now and every time it comes out moist and flavorful. I agree with others to whisk the batter for a bit more fluffyness, but other then that I did no other alterations. Its best served with honey butter, which I whip up in my quisinart. I've made this for Sunday dinner with my family, a labor day party with friends and family, and just my fiance and I, and I always get rave reviews!

Made with my own fresh ground cornmeal, this received rave reviews from the folks I made it for. The only thing I did different was to use two cups of cornmeal and two cups of flour. Followed the suggestion and gave the cornmeal a good soaking  with the milk and egg and then used my whisk to beat it well. When I make it just for my husband and me I will cut the sugar by half as I don't like sweet cornbread, but I have been making cornbread for 50 years and this recipe is definitely a keeper

The only changes I made were to use whole wheat and white flour. 
It turned out perfectly, moist with flavour. Perfect cornbread.
I suspect the variations in flavor intensity, have something to do with the cornmeal used. A chef I know adds a can of creamed corn. I have done that and had really good results. Adding bacon fat as part of the vegetable oil also adds a nice touch .

This is one of my family’s favourite quick breads! Whenever soup or chili is on the menu they ask me to make this cornbread. The only change I make is cutting the sugar to 1/2 cup.

Moist, I did mix it for five minutes by hand before pouring it in the baking pan. I substituted flax seed for the eggs, and it still rose very well. We had a buttermilk white corn flour, and that worked well.

This was pretty terrible.  I did the 5 minutes of beating, as suggested, but it turned out very dense, not light and airy at all.  Tasteless, too.

I’m not sure what all the hype is about with these reviews, this cornbread has pros and cons but wouldn’t rate it 5 stars.  
Pros:  the taste is very good, that of most of the other cornbreads I’ve tried that didn’t have any added ingredients like corn or  jalapeño  Etc.   It was fairly easy to make, I made the brewed in a glass Pyrex Esther than muffins. 
Cons:  it was way too dense.  Cornbread should be dry in the middle, airy and fluffy, and unfortunately this wasn’t.  
If anyone could suggest how to amend this recipe so the result was dry airy and fluffy Rather than a paperweight it would be great best recipe ever.

I followed some advice in the comments: i used 2 cups cornmeal and let it soak for a while- like 10 minutes. or more, giving stirs a couple of times. lowered the flour to 1.5 cups, and used a hand mixer to  blend for five minutes at the end.  I melted 2 T salted butter in my dish before adding the batter. When done, the bread was about 2" tall, brown on the bottom and golden yellow on the top and so tasty!  I thought it had a bit of a bitter aftertaste, so I will have to check my baking powder, but it was not as bad as some other cornbread I have had (I am sensitive to that taste). Served this with a bowl of homemade chili con carne. This will be my recipe from now on.

While this was definitely moist and had the right amount of sweetness, it didn't have much flavor. I won't be making it again.

I honestly can't imagine a better cornbread!  This was to die for and I've never said that about cornbread before. The adaptations I made were exactly like COOKINLOVE's: I soaked the milk and Cornbread mixture for at least 5 minutes and whisked it often. I used half a cup of sugar instead of 2/3. (Next time I will also reverse the cornbread and flour amounts because I think it would make it even better if that were possible).  I beat everything together for 5 minutes on my KitchenAid on low and while that was beating I melted 2 tablespoons of butter in a cast iron skillet in the preheated oven. I scraped the beaten mixture into the pan and then I baked it for 20 minutes. This wasn't quite long enough for me and so I put it back in for another five and it was perfect!!! We couldn't stop eating it.

Okay.  Made it without any of the suggested modifications.  Next time would try some as it was a little bland.

Best cornbread ever!   To make it a bit more "corn tasting," I actually used 1/2 corn flour and 1/2 regular flour in this recipe.  Turned out excellent!  Entire family loved it - especially my husband who just LOVES his cornbread!

Great recipe!  should have read some of the notes, didn't beat for 5 minutes, so was a little dense, but delicious warm with some whipped honey butter!!  My family, including 3 year twins loved it.

Made this exactly as written, except that I baked it in two silicone bread pans.  Took it out just a few minutes early and cooled on a wire rack.  It tastes wonderful, and was so easy to make!

Only used 1/2 cup of sugar and it turned out very good.  My oven must run high since they were done at 25 minutes (I also turned it done to 375 for the last 10 minutes since they were looking done already).

I made this before Christmas for a party and wasn't that impressed, but folks liked it.  It did not have much cornmeal flavor, but was moist and didn't fall apart. I made again and followed the recommendation of switching the amounts for corn meal and flour and added a cup of sugar and wow, what a difference!

I used 2 cups cornmeal and 1 1/2 cups flour as others recommended, and a little less sugar. Also used butter not oil. Cooked in a 10" cast iron pan ( 1/2 stick butter melted in pan before adding batter) and it was filled to the brim. had to cook at 400 degrees  for a LONG time before it was set - probably about 40-45 minutes. I used medium grind corn meal so it still had grit even after being soaked, which we liked. Great basic recipe I will use again and keep modifying with additives like green chiles, cheese or corn.

I’ve never made cornbread before and I messed up the “beat for 5 minutes” part, (I thought it said leave for 5 minutes) and this turned out awesome! It had an excellent flavour and was very moist. It did turn out a bit dense but I think that was my fault for not beating long enough. I thought it was going to be a lot harder to make but this was so simple and quick! Definitely will be saving this recipe.

I cut this recipe in half since I’m USUALLY the only one who eats it. My husband ate a piece and packed two pieces with his lunch tomorrow - and he hates cornbread due to the course, dry texture. This is super moist, but not “cake-like.” It’s hard to explain why it’s different, it’s just good!

This is a super easy recipe to make. I added frozen corn and it was quite a hit in our house. I had to put half of it immediately in the freezer so I wouldn't eat it all in one sitting.

This wasn't an exciting version for me.  I made a slight error during execution (which also resulted in the battery being beaten longer than 5 minutes) and got a super dense bread with little flavor. I will try another recipe for my next foray into cornbread.

I’ll be honest, usually things I make don’t turn out very good. But I made this exactly as called for and my husband loves it and so do I! We are still eating it 3 days later and it is super moist and flavorful after sitting out covered on the counter. Will 100% make again!

Was very good . If you like a sweet cornbread this is a great recipe. I tried to use it in a stuffing but I found it too sweet for that application. Next time I would cut back on the sugar if it is for dressing.

Unlike other raters, I found this cornbread to be so-so. I like mine weightier and more "cornmeal-prominent".

My family always asks for this cornbread. It is exactly what my Grandmother made - and yes, we lived along the Canadian side of the St. Lawrence River. The beating of the mixture is definitely necessary.

I only had one egg, so I added a little more oil, and it still turned out delicious!

This was a wonderful cornbread.  I substituted buttermilk for plain milk and it was excellent.  Everyone loved it.

This was amazing! I followed recommendations of other reviewers and left the mixer going on low ~5 minutes. I also added 1 cup frozen corn at the end - which turned out perfect for this slightly sweet, moist cornbread.

Agreed that beating or stirring for five minutes is important.  I do think this recipe was different from the one I initially saved in my AR faves.  I couldn’t find my old school recipe box today and so sought this out on AR.  I knew something was missing, and the other reviewers state so here.  This is the best cornbread ever and the stirring is important.  I seem to recall that the stirring at the end was actually ten minutes.  I have a stand mixer so that will be no problem.  Thank you for this recipe, hubby loves this version.

I made this exactly as written, and it is the best, most moist cornbread I've ever had!  Cornbread has always been too crumbly for me, but this holds up so well and is absolutely delicious.

Easy to make, with ingredients I had on hand and didn't have to run to the store for.  Came out great.  Used it for a side dish and again for stuffing.  A keeper!

Oh, so good.  The recipe is great.  I did reduce the sugar significantly, but added about a tablespoon of honey.  I also added about a quarter cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  Following cookinlove’s advice, I melted butter in a cast iron skillet and baked it  for about 34 minutes.  I’ll definitely be making this on the regular.

Gave only 4 stars because mine came out a little dense.
Could have been cooks error!

This was great! I made some modifications. I'm living in Athens at the moment so I decided to 'Greekify' it for fun... used olive oil, swapped the sugar with 1/3 cup Greek honey, substituted 1 cup of the milk with thinned Greek yogurt, and changed the 1 tbsp baking powder to 1 tsp baking soda to account for the increase in acidity... the result was maybe not the most traditional cornbread, but so fluffy and tasty!

I add a little extra egg, cornmeal and oil to mine. I like it to be a little more spongy than dense. This recipe is pretty similar to mine though. Love it!

Amazing! I don't like cornbread in any fashion and I ate two pieces! I followed the suggestions of halving the recipe, using a little less sugar, mo' buttah, and cooking in a cast iron skillet and it was perfect!!! My kids ate every little crumb!

7.6.17  I made corn muffins, ended up with 16, baked the first batch for 19 minutes @ 400ºF which turned out just a little too brown around the edges, although the muffin didn’t taste overbaked.  But we eat with our eyes, so the second batch was 17 minutes, and that’s how long I’ll bake them in the future.  Only modification to the recipe was to reduce the amount of sugar (personal taste preference).  Texture is classic cornbread with a light, moist, non-crumbly texture.  We enjoyed this so much that I think this will become my go-to recipe.  Homestead Cornbread was published on this site many years ago, has had lots of reviews and is obviously still popular.

I cut back on the sugar and only used 1/3 of a cup since I don't like sweet cornbread. Turned out great. Cooked mine in cast iron pans and it took a little less time.

Wow, what a recipe. Cornbread was my last thing to master and I'm so glad I did it this way. It looks like a lot while you're making it, but.... once it's cooled and you start digging into it you'll wish you had made more. It has all that wonderful cornbread taste with the perfect sweetness that doesn't go overboard into jiffy mix land. You'll still want to snack on this long after you finish the meal.

Followed recipe ingredients exact but baked in muffin tin. It made 12 large and 24 small muffins. Cooking time was reduced (they were done after 25 minutes). Love this and will make again.

I had to half the recipe because I didn't have enough cornmeal.  Because I had already sprayed the 9 x 13 I just put it in there and set the time to 20 minutes instead of 35.  It turned out lovely.  Not too sweet/cakey and good with the chicken quinoa chili I made

I loved this cornbread. I have for years made Allrecipes Golden Sweet Cornbread. They are both good but slightly different. The Golden sweet recipe is more sweet and slightly cake like. It kind of reminds me of Boston Market cornbread. This is slightly less sweet, quite dense, yet very moist. It also rises quite tall. I would definitely make it again. I think, it could pair with more meals. I thought it had a sort of buttery flavor despite the missing butter. I used safflower oil for the oil in the recipe. I accidentally left it in the oven for about 5 minutes more and it came out perfect. Thanks!

I love this recipe, as is or with my particular changes. I usually use 1/2 c brown sugar instead of the white sugar and cut back about 1/4 c of milk and add a few tbsp of plain yogurt and a drained can of whole corn.

It's not very moist at all. I wanted to stay try to the recipe before altering. So this review is strictly The recipe, sure there's things you can do to make it more moist, but that wouldn't be reviewing the actual recipe. It bothers me that people gave this five stars with their alterations because I tried it thinking it be really most as is.

This was a great recipe, very fluffy and tasty. I ran out of sugar and only had half, and it was still sweet. I cant have gluten, so for the flour i used 1/2 rice flour and half a mix of almond and coconut flour. My kids couldnt tell the difference!

Excellent. Followed recipe but used buttermilk and melted coconut oil and made half recipe.  Turned out great.  Will make again and maybe add jalapenos and cheddar.

Delicious, good consistency, but sweeter than I am used to. Next time, I will put less sugar. Then again, it depends what you eat with it.

I made this cornbread with no edits to the original recipe, and the whole family loved it! Even my mom (who makes homemade cornbread from memory every week) said it was delicious! This will be my go-to recipe from now on!

Made corn bread according to directions. Put in oven, but even after one hour cooking, the center was too wet. I think the amount  of liquids need to be reduced to 1 1/2 cups milk and 2/3 cup oil.

I baked it in a greased cast iron pan.  Turned out good.  Next time I may try using a little more cornmeal and a little less flour.  Overall was tasty!

Amazing! Very moist and tasteful. I cut back the sugar and added honey to give it a natural sweet taste. I also added blueberries to some and is delicious. I followed someone's advise to beat the entire mixture for 5 minutes to make them fluffy, and in the end, something worked!

This recipe can easily be halved. I put it on top of my Mexican casserole, and bake through. Sometimes I also add cheddar on top.

I made a half batch as I was only cooking for one. It took almost an hour for it to cook. Twice the cooking time for half a batch is ridiculous. The flavour was decent but fairly bland. I crumbled it over my chili and it soaked up the juices nicely.

This was an easy recipe to make dairy free by substituting soy/almond milk. Added just a touch more sugar because I like sweet cornbread. Very good!

I make this cornbread all the time and it's always a hit! I do make some substitutions, though. I use only whole wheat flour, soy milk instead of dairy milk, applesauce in place of the oil, and honey instead of sugar.  This lightens it up a bit and makes it a little healthier. It's always good, especially with apple butter! ??

First time making corn bread from scratch, easy recipe to follow and I really loved it, I added some corn to the batter and it made it extra special. Really happy with this recipe next will add just a bit more sugar.

I took the suggestions of others and switched the measurements of the cornflour and flour.  Also added one cup sugar as another suggested. And a squirt of honey. As I suggested. Very good!my husband ate 1/4 of the pan before I even had a taste.  I know if he likes it it's good!  Thanks for the recipe and the measurement suggestions from the reviewers.

Good recipe. It is moist, easy, and quick to make. Also, it is easy to modify for specific tastes, such as adding jalapeño and cheese, or making it sweeter with a little honey or something. I frequently use this recipe.

I found this recipe years ago and it is hands down the best corn bread. I grew up in the deep Appalachian mountains where cornbread is hard as a rock and virtually tasteless. My husband always had New England style, so sweet you might think it was cake. And this bridges the gap perfectly and then some. I make it weekly and everyone loves it.  I do make one change and that is using bacon grease/lard instead of vegetable oil(Kentucky). Thank you for this recipe

I used lard instead of vegetable oil, and half & half instead of milk, and added just a sniff of nutmeg. I think it's the best corn bread I've made. I got distracted while making It and had to leave all the mixed ingredients about 45 minutes which may (or not) have enhanced the end result.

This recipe is a keeper. I baked it in a buttered cast iron skillet and it turned out wonderfully moist on the inside, with a golden crust on the outside. The entire family enjoyed it. Since my husband likes "gritty" cornbread, I flip-flopped the flour and corn bread measurements, so it would have more texture. Per the author's suggestion in her own review, I beat the batter for a few extra minutes to whip more air into it. I also soaked the corn meal in the milk for 10 minutes since I used 2 cups instead of 1 1/2. Finally, I added 1 tbsp of honey, just because :)

This is the cornbread recipe I've been looking for...sweet and not as coarse and dry as most. The texture is almost muffin like. I halved the recipe only because I was short on cornmeal. It worked just fine.  I also took another reviewers suggestion and beat the batter for 5 minutes. Used my kitchen aid stand mixer. I think this would make some great cornbread stuffing this will be my go to cornbread from now on.

This is one for my 'go to' list.

Great cornbread, made  it exactly as the recipe says to.  It makes a big pan full, so be ready to eat a lot!  On first bite I felt like it needed either a bit more sugar or a bit more salt, depending on preference for sweet or savory cornbread, but after it sat in the pan for a day it was just right (much like how iced tea is better the second day, I suppose?).  I might try it with a touch of honey in the mixture next time to see how  goes.

Will make it again, however following instructions the center was not cooked.  Ended up bread loaf breaking in half and uncooked batter spilling out.  Shoved back in over (both halves, with the oozing batter) and let cook for another 20-30 minutes.  Much better.  I think 180C for at least an hour might work better.

Printed this out years ago, and it is our go-to cornbread recipe. Over the years, I have made a few adjustments to suit our taste:reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup, increase cornmeal to 2 cups, and use 3/4 cup each of white and whole-wheat flour. If we have leftover corn in the fridge, that goes in, too! Always get compliments on this. :)

I was looking for a cornbread casserole recipe where onion, peppers and hot dogs were used.  Unfortunately they all called for corn bread mix. As I wanted to make my cornbread from scratch I found this one. I made it according to the author's directions including  beating it for 5 minutes. I added 1 1/2 c. grated cheddar cheese 3 green onions finely chopped , 1 c green pepper and 12 veggie hot dog cut up. I sprinkled 1/2c grated cheddar cheese on top. The flavour of the corn bread was exactly what I was looking for, and it was a huge hit! Next time I plan to use jalapeno peppers and grated Monterrey Jack cheese.

As others suggested, I used:
2c cornmeal (not 1.5c)
1.5c all purpose flour (not 2c)
1c white sugar (not 2/3c)
Soak cornmeal for 10 mins.
Do beat it for 5 mins, it makes it less dense.

Wonderful! I followed Willowsmom99's advice to beat the batter for five minutes. I had some leftover fresh corn, so I added a few handfuls to the batter after it was done beating.

I have used this recipe several times and my family loves it!  The first time I did find it a bit dry so I substitute 1 can of creamed corn for a quarter of the milk. Makes for a moist and a bit sweeter side for a spicy smoked chilli. ?

This was great.   The cook time was off for me. I had to bake it a bit longer than posted. About  12 minutes.   Made this to go with BBQ chicken and I have half a pan left to go with broccoli cheese soup tomorrow. Nice recipe. I also used coconut oil.

This was just ok.  It was dry and didn't have a lot of flavor.  I prefer one that actually has a bit of sweetness and some corn flavor to it.

I have been using this recipe for over a year now, it's a go to fav in this house. I normally make it in conjunction with red beans and rice. Around thanksgiving I just do less sugar and add some savory spices for the cornbread stuffing :)

Didn't change anything other than using a 12" iron skillet generously greased and splitting this magical potion into two batches to keep baking time to 35 minutes.  Thanks for posting this excellent recipe!

I have never made cornbread before and this recipe was very easy to follow. It was absolutely delicious with a little bit of butter spread straight from the oven, although it didn't really need it. Will definitely make again!

Excellent recipe that's delicious and easy to make (I almost always make a pan of it whenever I'm having chili).  The only change is that I usually use less sugar than the recipe calls for (1/2 cup instead of 2/3 cup).

This is the first cornbread i've ever made so i followed the directions exactly,  and it turned out fabulously. It was effortless to make, and it got eaten in a matter of hours.

I have made this recipe twice. The first time I followed other reviewers' advice and beat the batter for longer than 5 minutes, cut the sugar in half, and cooked it in a pre-heated cast iron pan. The cornbread turned out okay but was far too dense.

The second time I made it I halved the recipe and followed the original proportions. I once again used a pre-heated cast iron pan. The only change I made to the ingredients was to add 1 tbs of vinegar to the batter just before pouring it into the hot pan. This is to activate the baking soda, creating little bubbles that end up giving the bread a slightly lighter texture.   I only beat the batter for less than a minute, following the logic that beating batter develops the gluten and results in a tougher final product. Half-way through the baking I buttered the top of the bread to give it a nice golden crust. The result was excellent! I will make it this way again for sure.

This cornbread is moist and sweet.  My family and guests loved it. I used 1% milk instead of buttermilk and still turned out great.

Really liked how easily this recipe came together. I had read some of the previous reviews and decreased the sugar. We still found it too sweet as a savoury cornbread. Perhaps only 1/4 cup of sugar next time. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This bread has the right balance of sweetness and density with the very decadent flavor you will expect from a cornbread. A great side dish to ribs.

I've made this several times.  It halves well into an 8" square pan.  I've added both a few red pepper flakes and some frozen (thawed) corn kernels to the batter as well.

Awesome recipe.  So yummy I just want to eat it all. I made mine in a silicone large muffin pan.  Excellent with the chili I made and then a great dessert too with some raspberry jam spread on it.

Oh my gosh! I made this for my family and in a week the whole thing was gone. If u want to make this be prepared for it to be gone. When it got out of the oven the whole kitchen smelled of fresh sweet homestyle cornbread. If u have a sweet tooth I would suggest adding some warm honey and it will be perfect!

This recipe has been one of my staples for years...it is easy to make and there are never leftovers.  I just made it vegan, so coconut milk and egg replacer (Ener-G) AND gluten free with a gluten-free flour blend (Manini's), and it turned out wonderfully.  I don't think anyone would ever say this cornbread is "dry and tasteless".

Medium grind stone ground cornmeal, as long it soaks in the milk, makes for full on taste. Sometimes  I use a third to half whole wheat flour along with white, adding in 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for moisture . Agree with 375 oven esp with metal pan.

This cornbread is sweeter and dense/firm, but still very soft and moist. It's not as 'crumby' as most cornbreads I've eaten, but I really love the texture.
Using a good quality cornmeal ensures you get none of those tiny hard bits often found in packages of corn muffin mix.

The cornbread is wonderful!  I was in a hurry so didn't get a chance to read the reviews for modifications (and I always do this!) to the original recipe, so my cornbread turned out dense and looked a little underdone....but done. I will make the suggested changes next time!  It got ate with zero complaints!

Fantastic. I read the recommendations, beat the batter for 5 minutes and used a scant 2/3 cups of sugar. Otherwise, followed this to the letter. We had it with chili and my family loved it.

One of, if not the most moist & simple cornbread recipes I've ever tried!  Delicious hot and as leftovers.  As other reviewers suggested, I soaked the cornmeal & milk longer than instructed, used half or less sugar, and against my so-called better judgment beat the dickens out of the batter (at least 10-15 mins).  I added a can of Niblets corn and lightly remixed before baking it in a large cast iron skillet filled w/4-5 T of melted butter.  Baking time took longer than noted but it was well worth it!  We served it with turkey chili but I can't wait to try variations with diced green chilis, cheese, etc.  Thank you Canada!

I made this to go with chilli & used another reviewers suggestions of 2 cups cornmeal, 1.5 cups flour, 1 cup sugar ( the rest of the ingredients as listed in the recipe). Baked for approx. 45 mins at 375. It turned out wonderfully, very moist. Put a little warmed maple syrup on the side & we all ate it with the chili AND for dessert! This is by far the best recipe I have found for cornbread...it's not too dense or dry. Caution: this won't keep for very long...eat immediately or freeze.

I've made it with oil and with butter, I like the butter better! Sounds bad but the batter is so good, we spoon the bowl empty.

I made this as a test batch for something I'll be making for Friendsgiving. It was super moist, as the recipe said it would be and not too sweet. Overall it was great. The whole batch was gone within a few days, thanks to me and my parents.

This was pretty good! I made sure soaked the cornmeal in water for about 10 minutes and mixed for the whole 5 minutes. Texture was great.  Not dry or gritty at all! We like sweet cornbread, so I increased the sugar to a cup (half white half brown) and it still was not quite sweet enough for us...that is the only reason I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5. I will add another 1/4 of sugar next time :)

I prefer cornbread with corn kernels inside, but I thought I would give this a try. The bread is a bit dense and a bit bland.

I omitted the sugar because I do not like sweet cornbread- but I do like this cornbread- I will be making it again but I know that I will have to leave it in the oven longer because  the middle was still raw and I will be cutting the recipe in half  lol- it was a lot of cornbread. I do think this would be a great recipe to use  for dressings during the holidays!

I have made this a dozen times, and think it has the best texture of any recipe I have tried. My only alteration was to use 1/2 cup sugar, as my family is trying to reduce sugar intake. No difference in flavor, in my opinion.

Great recipe that I have made hundreds of times. Sub in white corn meal and replace some or all of the vegetable fat with equal amounts of bacon fat and you are golden. As others have stated this recipe benefits from working in some air into the batter so don't be afraid to beat it for 5 mins or so.  And addition of jalapeno and cheddar or corn niblets makes and excellent variant.

The texture was nice and moist.  In all fairness it was great with chili, however, when eaten alone smothered with butter it was lacking. I am going to try it smothered with honey & I am sure that it will improve the taste. My husband liked it.

I've never been the hugest cornbread fan, coming from the Midwest, but I have to say I will make this recipe - as is - no changes, for the rest of my life.  Superb!  the baking time & temp was accurate & I had no issues with this dish (which is always welcome when trying something new). Served fresh out of the oven with butter for a side dish.  Thanks for submitting.

I love this cornbread. I have made it numerous times, but yesterday I read some of the reviews & saw that the submitter suggested that the batter be mixed for FIVE minutes. I decided to follow that suggestion (rather than mix it as a quick bread - ie: mix dry with wet ingredients, just until combined). My cornbread came out quite dense - especially in the middle. I will go back to treating the batter more gently & enjoy the lighter crumb that I get with a quick bread method of mixing.

:D  This is an AWESOME recipe!  Finally!!  MOIST cornbread!!

The only  changes I made in the recipe:
-Substituted the milk for water and lactose free powdered milk 
- Used brown sugar instead of white
- Added 1 Tbsp Maple Syrup

This is by far THE BEST cornbread recipe I have EVER made!!  Melt in your mouth moist!!

**Tastes really good with: jam, garlic butter, maple syrup...
(I can't give you any more examples right now, because my belly is really full!)  I'm sure that ANYTHING you like would taste great with this!!

This turned out excellent. It was moist and flavorful, did not fall apart. The only changes I made was,  I halfed the recipe and added a small can of drained whole kernel corn and some diced jalapeño peppers. My husband also said it was excellent!

This is my favorite cornbread recipe, it is so moist! I would not eat cornbread until I tried this recipe. I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. My friends always ask to take some home if I have leftovers.

It was really moist. My husband liked it because it had flour in it and it gave it a bit more of a cake consistency. I didn't like it because I like my cornbread without flour and very grainy.

Amazing starter recipe. Goes good with a honey butter spread or with chili.  Super easy to customize, too. You can add  herbs to make it more savory (up the amount of salt, too) or you can add a bit more sugar to make it sweeter. You can add whole corn to add texture, or swap buttermilk for the milk.  Great texture, density, and mixes very consistently.

Amazing corn bread. I have made it just as is, but also with diced jalapeño and cheddar cheese. My kids fight for the leftovers.

Replaced the table sugar with 1/2 cup honey. Tip:use the same measuring cup as the oil. Better flavor, and moist. I also used this recipe for my waffles. I added a mashed banana and a teaspoon of cinnamon to the waffles. Delicious.

I have made this recipe several times and it always turns out great. Whole family loves it. It tastes even better the next day. I did take the suggestion of mixing for 5 minutes other than that I don't change a thing. I have to say this is best cornbread recipe hands down!

My family loved it. I baked in my iron skillet. Perfect cornbread. I used butter instead of oil other than that this is a great receipt.  Thank you

Most moist cornbread ever! Revisions: I swapped the cornmeal and flour quantities, I too whisked it for 5 minutes, I added a cup of grated Monterey Jack cheese to the top halfway through baking, and I baked at 375.

usually not a fan of cornbread. I followed the suggestion for less flour more corn flour, and more sugar. Instead of using oil since my house hold suffers high cholesterol I used unsweetened apple sauce. I also have a small gas stove that likes to fry things so I cooked it 30-40 minutes at 325. Turned out good especially drizzled with honey

This was a very easy recipe. I followed it exactly, it turned out awesome. This is the most moist cornbread i ever had. I am going to make it again right now but as muffins. I will add chives, jalapeno, and cheese. I hope it turns out.

Was pretty good, kinda sweet with the amount of sugar the recipe calls for. I'm used to using plain old Jiffy cornbread muffin mix, which is what I like, but when I moved I couldn't find Jiffy anywhere, so I made this recipe. It's not like the Jiffy stuff, but it's still good. I followed the recipe. Next time, I'll take other reviewer's suggestions and beat the batter longer and use a bit less sugar. I think that will help it taste more like the cornbread I'm used to.

EDIT: Okay, it's been a few days since I made this recipe, and I can't stand the taste of it anymore. It was way too sweet, had a funky taste, the bread itself was thick and heavy.

I live in the South where cornbread typically doesn't include sugar, but I prefer this recipe over any others I've tried. I read the reviews and beat the batter for five minutes on low in a stand mixer. I also included about 2/3 cup corn because I like the look of the kernels in the bread. The cornbread was almost like a cake. It rose beautifully and came out fluffy. Everyone loved it, including my husband who isn't a huge fan of standard Southern cornbread. I have served this a few times with chili, potato soup, and a curry stew, and thought it was the perfect complement to each.

Truly fool-proof recipe! I didn't have the proper cornmeal so I used polenta.  I didn't have the proper white flour so I used unbleached flour.  Didn't have granulated white sugar either.  I had to use brown sugar and I only had 1/4 cup of that.  I did have salt and reasonably good baking powder and good eggs.  I even had to make up powdered milk!  Soaking the polenta worked great.  Thanks for the note Willowsmom.  I blended all the liquid items (milk,oil and eggs) and let it sit for 15 minutes.  I beat the batter again before adding the baking powder, salt and flour.  By then the oven was hot (which aided the baking powder). It came out great!  It absorbs butter very well.  Was great with chili.  Thanks!

Hands down this is the easiest and BEST cornbread to make. Didn't have buttermilk on hand but added a splash of vinegar to the cup of milk and let sit briefly then followed recipe EXACTLY as written. Family immediately said how good and moist it was. Must try it will not disappoint. First review I've ever done because it was so good:)

Just made the recipe and it's in the oven. I did have to substitute mayonnaise for the eggs and oil because I'm on a strict budget and out of eggs. I also noted the sugar not listed in the ingredients list but I don't add sugar to cornbread anyway and its why I chose this recipe. I don't feel it would be right to star rate because of the substitution. (Mayonnaise cake, chocolate, tastes great so I figured why not try it!)

I've made this twice now and LOVE it. Cornbread is a big part of my Southern cooking history, and I love this simple from scratch recipe. This isn't sweet and not bitter, not salty...just perfect for anything you want to pair it with. I'm making cornbread stuffing today, and I just took a bite of the cornbread ahead of making the stuffing...it was perfect!

Cooked perfectly, very light and fluffy but flavour was a bit too mild for me. Might try again with buttermilk and a bit less flour.

This recipe is back as a Thanksgiving encore in our house.  The cornbread is delicious, moist, looks gorgeous, tastes fabulous.  I did not tweak this one bit.

I highly recommend this as I think it's the best cornbread I've had in my entire life.

This corn bread was very good. It made a large amount, good for a crowd. It was dense and held it's shape but was not dry. I am giving 5 stars because although I feel it needs more cornmeal, it was well liked by my family as is. Other comments have mentioned the lack of corn flavor, I completely agree and will use more cornmeal and less flour in the future. However, as is, taste was great just missing a strong corn flavor. I baked for 30 minutes and mixed batter for 5 minutes as recommended by reviewers, it was perfect. Definitely will make again.

This was my first time making corn bread and I'm happy I chose this recipe. I followed others advice and mixed it for 5 minutes before I baked it. It was delicious. It went very well with the spicy chili I made as well. The approved too which made it worth keeping.

This recipe was great! My first time making corn bread from scratch and it was definitely a hit. 
My only suggestion would be for those who like a sweeter taste to add a bit more sugar. Also, soaking the cornmeal/milk mixture for 10mins is a good tip, as well as beating the batter for 5mins longer. Overall, a really great recipe!

I was looking for a "from scratch" cornbread recipe to go with Boilermaker Tailgate Chili for our rainy Sunday dinner. This was just what I was looking for. I'm not sure why I made an full recipe when there's just two of us so I'll freeze leftovers to use for stuffing later.

This cornbread is great - soft and cakey which makes it perfect for dipping in soups and chilis.  I did not bother using more than one bowl and it still turned out perfectly.  Easy and delicious.  Thanks!

Having never eaten or made cornbread before I thought I'd give this a go! I made a slightly smaller batch and didn't put in all the sugar but it tastes great and went really well with the veggie chilli I made. I think I would put even less sugar in next time I make it. Goes really well with apple butter, too! Great recipe - thanks for sharing :)

I tried this recipe hoping that it would be light and fluffy like my moms always was when I was a kid but instead it's very dense and bland.

I have a honey cornbread recipe that my family has loved for years, but this tops it.  It is moist, light and fluffy.  I freeze individual portions of whatever I make and this freezes beautifully. It was wonderful with my mother's chili recipe that I made yesterday.

This cornbread was very good.  I followed the recipe as written, but baked it in a cast iron skillet with melted butter in the bottom.  This is a must as it gives the bread a nice crisp skin and soft bread inside.  It would have been a bit better with more cornmeal.

I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and it was amazing. If you really want you cornbread to be sweet you might watch to add some honey, you can taste the sugar in the recipe but I wouldn't consider this recipe to be very sweet.  We like to drizzle honey on our cornbread so the recipe was perfect for what we needed.

I really liked this cornbread. The only thing I would different is put less sugar in. Maybe half. I found it a little too sweet for my taste. I added some jalapenos for a kick, and my husband and I both really liked it.

Being Australian, we have never tried corn bread before until this week, when we made a dry and tasteless version. We searched around for a better recipe and this worked. A half quantity was perfect for our family, but it won't be a regular as we find the idea of cornbread a little strange. The recipe is fine though, managing to taste like corn even though there is no fresh corn in it.

I tried this recipe over the weekend as an aside to a pot of chili and it was FANTASTIC! I have never taken the time to comment on a recipe before, as I'm pretty new to getting them from websites like allrecipes.com, but I was very pleased, my husband loved it and it was all gone in about 24 hours. Well done WILLOWSMOM99!!!

It does lack a bit of flavor, but it's very easy to make and the proportions make a lot of cornbread. I would tweak it a little to make it more sweeter and add butter on top once it's done baking to soften the crust.

I did 1/3 cup honey and 1/3 cup sugar to get that sweet honey taste in the cornbread I love so much. And changed the veggie oil to Crisco instead, to make it really fattening. Only 4 stars becuase of the changes i made otherwise great recipe.

I like a moister cornbread than this makes so I added another 1/4 cup of milk. I also did not have oil and had to substitute butter (did not realize I was out until too late).  I also split it into 2 8in pans instead of one 9x13. Still baked it for 30 min. My family loved it. Next time I make it I will try it with the oil.

I made this recipe with half&half coffee cream instead of milk.
This recipe turned out fantastic. I baked it for 30 minutes at 400' 
I would not cook a moment more.   It made a dense spongy
Bread perfect for BBQ meal.

I loved this recipe!  It was the tastiest and simplest cornbread ever.  As with all quick breads, do not mix it too much.  Once its combined, leave it.  It only took 25 minutes for mine to cook.

Love, love, love, this cornbread recipe FOR CORN STICKS ONLY.  Really - our family only likes this recipe when we make it up as corn sticks *with these modifications*: swap quantities of flour/cornmeal, use whole wheat flour, use raw sugar, soak cornmeal for 5-10 minutes, bake in preheated corn stick pans w/melted butter - but not overfilling them at all - perhaps underfilling them.  For that purpose, we truly love this recipe.  Nothing else compares to the crisp crunch of this recipe when a lot of crust is involved, even when/if this recipes is not whisked for the five minutes recommended in most reviews.  Oh! the crunch when this is made with a bit of butter melted in pre-heated corn stick pans???? ---  it's really wonderful!  For other ways of baking cornbread though (muffins, in a cast iron skillet, etc.)?  We have other favorites.

This recipe is great. I actually take it camping and mix the milk, cornmeal, oil and eggs together in one container and all the dry in another. Just mix them together, and cook in a Dutch oven in the fire. Super fantastic and simple and tastes great. I think the cornmeal likes soaking for a day or two. I've never had a failure in my oven, or Dutch oven with this recipe.

I read a couple of reviews and beat the batter for five minutes before baking.  It turned out so well that it is going to be my family's new staple!

Worst outcome I've ever had with an AllRecipes recipe. Very bland, extremely heavy, very moist texture with (as many people have observed) little "cornbread" taste to it. Even extra cooking made no difference. Followed all of the top-rated suggestions (e.g. extra mixing). Another reviewer suggested it might be the inclusion of the oil that has this result and I wonder if that's the case... Will be trying a new recipe next time.

This was fine but not my kind of cornbread, I guess. I sought a recipe for a 13 x 9 sheet because my normal recipe makes 6 x 9. I will admit that I didn't beat the batter for 5 min. I also made adjustments that I thought would better suit me, changing cornmeal:flour ratio to 1:1 and reducing the sugar to 1/2 c. Still too sweet for me, but flavor was fine.

I followed this recipe to the dot (even let the cornmeal sit with the milk for 5 minutes) and unfortunately, my cornbread was burnt on the edges and dry on the inside. 
This is what I suggest for the recipe: 1) The length of time the recipe suggests is too long - perhaps, 20 to 25 minutes ought to suffice. 2) Milk, egg, and butter should have been used, and mixed together first, instead of pouring in the fat (vegetable oil) near the end. 
Otherwise, I think it has potential to be a great recipe.

Very good, dense, sweet cornbread.  Everyone loved it.  My boo boo was that I baked it in a 9x9 pan, and figured out my mistake when it took over an hour to bake.  The recipe forgave me and still was perfect.  I just covered it with foil when it got brown and just kept checking it til it was baked adequately.  This was wonderful with lima bean soup from this web site.

Wonderful recipe.  I followed exactly as posted with the exception of allowing the mixture to sit for approx 5 minutes, whipping several times. I also added in 2 diced jalapenos, cooked bacon and old cheddar for a little extra something.  Turned out beautifully! This is a keeper for my family.

This was fantastic. I made a tiny change. I substituted butter for the oil and flipped the measurements of the flour with the corn meal. My family of 8 loved it!

I found this recipe easy to make,  and I quite liked its taste. I will make again , but might use the suggestion of mixing longer for a little lighter cornbread.

Good cornbread but a little too cake like. I'd recommend swapping out the flour and cornmeal measurements and increase sugar to 1 cup. After the modifications I give it 5 stars!! Either way my kids loved

Hi Patricia, thanks so much for this recipe. I have never made cornbread before and it turned out brilliantly. Made it for our extended family Christmas lunch and everyone loved it. I happen to live in Vancouver. Where in Canada does your mother-in-law who gave you the recipe live?

Great tasty recipe. This is my first homemade cornbread and I made it for a crowd to go with chili and it was a huge hit. I did not have all purpose flour so I used self rising and left out the baking powder. I will definitely make this again and again!

Excellent recipe! The only thing I did different was to use 1/2 of the sugar called for in recipe (a personal preference for less sweet cornbread). A yummy pan of cornbread!

I followed the recipe exactly except for switching the flour and cornmeal measurements around due to some suggestions I saw in the reviews. I also baked it in one of my cast iron skillets. The cornbread came out nice and fluffy (I don't like super dense cornbread) and with lovely golden crispy edges. 5 stars for sure :)

Used melted unsalted butter instead of oil, doubled the salt and borrowed the vigorous stirring from other reviews.  Delicious, about to use as a stuffing.

This is by far the best cornbread recipe I have ever used. Even better than my moms and she was an awesome cook! It is just the perfect density, I did adjust the sugar a tad. I've been using this recipe for years. Never had the need to try any other after this.

I just made this cornbread. It was fairly moist. But I thought that it could have more corn flavour. It tasted a little watery even though there is no water in it.  I would make it again. I made a plain one in an 8 in. round pan and it took only 24 minutes in the oven. I used the rest of the batter in a glass loaf pan, I added bacon pieces to the batter and topped it with shredded cheddar cheese. That one was much more flavourful but took longer to bake.  add about 10 minutes more to baking time. It was light and fluffy inside but the outside had a hard crust since it had to bake longer. I would suggest baking it in a cake pan so it won't be as deep as the loaf pan and won't need the longer baking time.  enjoy!

I don't really know the all the differences between Northern and Southern cornbread, but this recipe delivered exactly what I wanted cornbread to be:  it was moist and flavourful, with just enough sweetness and super easy to make.   
I made sure I beat the batter for 5 minutes in the mixer as WillowsMom99 recommended, I added a can of drained corn, baked it in a cast iron skillet and served it with honey butter and chili.  Everyone raved about it and had second and third helpings.  Will be my go-to cornbread recipe from now on!

This was just OK. It was my first time making home made cornbread, and it was just your average cornbread!  It did not taste very sweet at all, and I followed the sugar serving recommendations.  If you like your cornbread slightly sweet (I did not taste any sweetness, just savory), than perhaps add a bit more sugar.

Based on other reviews, I made a few changes and absolutely fell in love with this cornbread!! First, I flip flopped the flour and cornmeal amounts. This helped give it a heartier flavor. Second, as it was resting for five minutes, I would give it a good whisk every minute or so. Then, after this resting period and after adding the remaining ingredients, I beat it on low speed of my electric mixer for five minutes. (Apparently this direction was part of the original recipe, but got left out somewhere along the way. But it is important because it gives the lightest texture to your finished product!) And lastly, I added a bit of honey to my batter before baking. OMGosh, it was soooo delicious!!

I just tried this recipe...hmmm..sorry to say it had no corn bread flavor,  or at least what I expected from what I remember to be corn bread. I search for another recipe.

I found the bread to be a bit dense and not sweet. I guess I like a little more sweet in my breads :) I may exchange the white sugar for brown next time and let the cornmeal stand a bit longer. Hopefully this will make a difference.

Won 1st prize at Church competition.  Add a little more sugar next time.  Beat at least 5 minutes to incorporate air into mixture.

This is the best cornbread recipe, ever! have been making it for years but the original recipe, which I have, has it made in a 12" cast iron skillet and as far as I am concerned, that is the only way to make cornbread! su2u

My husband didn't like cornbread until he found this recipe. Moist moist moist. I usually put it in a pan one size down from recommended and bake it a tad longer. I find that makes it even MORE moist!

Loved it! Actually, forgot the salt and cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup... Was very moist and still sweet.  Not "crumbly" at all.  Great cornbread... may add actual corn next time to see how that goes.

This is the first time I made cornbread by scratch and amazingly I had everything I needed.  I followed this recipe exactly.  The mix seemed a little runny to me and it made me a little nervous but it was all for naught.  The cornbread was moist with just the right amount of sweet.  I made this for chili tonight.  I think next time I'll add some honey for a sweeter taste.  As it is, this is a great, simple recipe.

This is THE BEST cornbread ever! Absolutely delicious, moist, tender, and my children gobble up the entire pan in one day.  I admit I help them.  I'm a southerner and down here we don't add sugar to traditional cornbread, but I am here to say that this is one tradition I am willing to break.  This recipe is too good to squabble over tradition.  I apologize to all my beloved southern kinfolk, and recommend that you try this.  I guarantee y'all will like it.

Good, but too dense, I read the reviews and did as told, I also would of liked more corn flavor. Was hoping for something more fluffy. I will play with this recipe until its just right tho.

Great recipe. I have made this on several occasions including my best friend's wedding rehearsal dinner. I also swap the flour and cornmeal measurements and reduce the oven by 25 degrees. I like it a little sweeter so I add more sugar and I use brown sugar instead of white. When the bread is done I brush a little butter on top and broil it for a few minutes to give the top a nice golden brown colour. I also finely dice a jalapeño pepper with the seeds removed to give it a great smokey pepper taste and a little heat. I have never served this and ended up with left overs. I have also made a gluten free version for my girlfriend's Dad and cousin who both have gluten allergies by using rice flour and baking it a little longer. It comes out more dense and doesn't rise as well but it is still delicious!

Turned out moist & delicious!
I let the cornmeal soak in the milk for a while. I also used 2 cups of cornmeal and decreased the flour. I whisked it all together and let it sit.
Also I baked at 375 for 30 mins then at 400 for another 5. 
Will make again!

Every fall, my Memom sends me a big box of local South Georgia cornmeal to use for my dressing recipes. I always have a lot left over and need to use it up, so I make cornbread. I've made this with and without the corn (my crew really doesn't do corn) and it's great either way. I've also used this recipe as a base for my cornbread dressing (leave out the sugar) and it's great.

This is my keeper cornbread recipe!  It's always turned out great. When we go camping, I measure all the dry into a big ziplock bag. Then on the night I make it, pour in all the wet ingredients. All the kids get a turn squishing the bag to mix it all up. I bake it in cast iron skillet and a cast iron wedge skillet. Everyone loves it!

I increased the cornmeal & sugar by 1/2 cup each - positively delicious! Moist & sweet. My mom made cornbread often when I was young, and this recipe won her approval as well, which says a lot :)

I have been using this recipe for several years and it turns out every time! So easy and so delicious! We will never used a boxed corn bread again.

It was pretty dry, but slathering on some butter solved that problem. I usually don't like cornbread, but this didn't have too strong of a flavour, so I liked it; good for dipping in chili.

I used gluten free all purpose flour, 2 cups cornmeal instead of 1-1/2 cups, 1/2 cup sugar (as I don't like too sweet a taste) and cooked for 30 min. I too beat the mixture for 5 minutes.  It came out perfectly.

I just made the recipe as is and tasted it....OMG....so moist and delicious.  Since i am not a great fan of white sugar, I put 1/2 brown and 1/2 white.  I found the cornbread sweet enough this way....I will definitely make again....

Moist and cakey and sweet, which is how we tend to like our cornbread! It was maybe just the tiniest bit flat-tasting - next time I might add more salt. (I use kosher salt, which is less salty than table salt, so that might have done it; I also used a packet of dried nonfat milk with enough water added to yield 2.5 cups, so that might be the culprit, too.) I made muffins, baked at 400 degrees for 15 minutes, and the recipe yielded 24 regular-sized muffins. This is an almost perfect recipe. Thanks!

I made this cornbread to tone down the spiciness of a black bean soup I made. And it was amazing! I have never tasted a cornbread so sweet and airy in my life! Will most definately be making this again

Nice texture, but I wanted a stronger corn taste, so I increased the amount of corn meal and decreased the amount of AP flour.

The best corn bread I've ever tasted!!....and I'm from the South!! It is more like a cake than bread!

I added an extra egg and used 1 1/2 cups butter milk and one cup milk.

Very good!! Turned out perfectly! If I had to pick out one thing, I would add a touch less sugar (just a personal preference.)  Also, try substituting about a half-cup of the cornmeal for cooked quinoa for added super-nutrients. I did, and it turned out great!

The best cornbread I've made ever. I halved the recipe (8 servings instead of the origial 15) and followed the instructions. (First, I watched the video as I am a visual learner). I did NOT beat for 5 minutes and my bread came out great! 
It was MOIST and just the right amount of sweetness. Served it with a cajun 10 bean "soup" that I bought from the store. My husband loved it. We've made cornbread from scratch before, often using freshly ground cornmeal from a mill we visited. Ran out of that and used some regular old plain cornmeal that I've had in the fridge for about 6 months. It was perfect.

This wasn't exceptional, but it wasn't terrible, either.  The only change I made from the original was that I used 1/2 c sugar instead of 2/3 c.  It was plenty sweet like that.  I beat it for a full five minutes, which resulted in large air pockets at the top and bottom of the bread and a dense center.  It was a bit dry and not all that flavorful.  This will probably not be a repeat recipe for me.

When I baked this, it took a bit longer than necessary, and the middle was still a little uncooked while the top was very dark. I would definitely use this recipe again, but I would adjust cooking temperature to avoid the previous issues.

I never rated this one the first time we tried it.... but thought I would now as it has become a family favorite.

Add some jalopenos for a little kick.  Or not.  We found the recipe perfect as is and it goes perfect with our favorite chili.

This cornbread was very good, but it was a little too sweet for me. Next time I will reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup. The batter was also runny, but it turned out fine.  Very dense as others said, but I will try whisking longer. Also, I did not soak the cornmeal in milk which may be why it was runnier.

This is a great cornbread recipe. The cornbread is moist and flavorful. However, the cornbread is also a bit dense, and it must be cooked in a 9X13; it looks a lot like a cake!

I made this corn bread last night and my whole family loved it. My husband said that I should use this recipe and nothing else, and actually wanted to eat some this morning. This is now my "go to" corn bread recipe. The only change I made was I added 3 tbsp of 100% melted butter. It came out perfect! The recipe actually yields a lot so if you don't need a lot I would half everything. I have a family of 6 and this was enough for everyone, and we had plenty of corn bread left over.

Delicious! 

Most cornbread I make is too dense and dry, but this was fantastic. I added chopped jalapeños, made muffins instead of bread and cooked for about 25 minutes. I wouldn't trust anyone that says this is "dry and tasteless". I tend to double or triple spices in recipes and found this bread very flavourful.

I tried this. I liked the flavour, but the bread turned out a little dry. Perhaps it was my timing, and my over temp. Would try again though.

Wonderful classic cornbread recipe!! Followed recipe exactly except I used butter instead of oil and it was delicious, moist and flavorful.

Very good recipe. As others have said it is dense and moist. It is a little more like cake than the cornbread I'm used to. I added a can of corn and reduced the milk accordingly. I followed the suggestions and did beat the batter for quite a while and I also added a couple of teaspoons of baking soda. I made a double batch and made it in bread loaf pans; it needed longer baking so after 30 minutes I covered the loaves with foil and baked at 350 degrees for another 10 minutes.

Having read the reviews about it drying out so quickly, I stored the uneaten cornbread in Tupperware as soon as it was cool enough to not sweat. The next day it was still as moist as when newly baked. Another time I'll reserve some of the cornmeal to add with the flour as I like a pebbly texture. Loved it with the Insanely Easy Chili.

I was surprised at how bland this was, what with all the raving reviews. I have never made corn bread before, but I took the advice of reviewers and switched the amounts of the cornmeal and flour and let the cornmeal and milk (I used almond milk, but that shouldn't make a bit of difference, and I used it to substitute milk all the time) soak for 10 minutes rather than 5. I wonder if honey instead of sugar and butter instead of oil would have improved the taste. Disappointed.

I LOVE this recipe! I wanted to let anyone out there looking for a dairy free version of cornbread that when you make this recipe with rice milk it is AMAZING! it is moist, the sweetness of the rice milk blends so perfectly with the corn to give it a lovely sweet corn taste! Happy cooking everyone!

It was my first time to make cornbread from scratch. I made TWO pans to feed the family. It was pretty good I added a stick of melted butter a little bit of pepper to mine it was pretty dang good.A little to cake like for me. It did stick well together and tasted great but I think I will add more cornmeal to my next attempt THANKS for the recipe!

This was not what I was looking for. It was posted as a moist cornbread, yet was far from moist. I agree that this was not a 5 star recipe. I think perhaps buttermilk or sour cream should be added to give it some moisture. I will continue my search to other cornbread recipes.

A great cornbread recipe! I made it gluten free by using sorghum & white rice flours with about two teaspoons xanthan gum. It was delicious. I will definitely use this recipe again.

This was very good. My only complaint was that it was not "grainy" as I expect cornbread to be (maybe because of the 5 min. soak) Following others I did switch the flour & meal amounts, beat batter 5 full min., increase sugar to full cup and reduce temp. by 25* for pyrex.

I had a big chili dinner for family and friends this past weekend. I just knew cornbread was a must and since I have never made it from scratch before the hunt was on for the perfect recipe. This one fit the bill and instead of a baking dish, I used a preheated and butter cast iron skillet. I got lots of compliments and will be using this recipe in the future for all of my cornbread needs.

I loved this recipe.  After making it as directed the first time, the only thing I changed the second was added about a 1/2 cup or so of honey.  Gave it more flavor, in my opinion.  Other than adding the honey, I wouldn't make any changes to the recipe.

It turned out wonderfully. Dense but fluffy at the same time. Not too crumby. Where it calls for oil I used half butter-half oil. My husband asked me if it was from a box because the only 'from scratch' cornbread he's had was like a brick :)

My favorite cornbread recipe! Makes a really moist and dense cornbread - not dry and crumbly.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect after 30 minutes.  It is not an overly sweet cornbread, but top it with some honey if you like.  Next time I am going to add some jalapenos to it!

Great!  Make 1/2 recipe for 8x8.  Full recipe makes 48 mini-muffins - cook 15 minutes.  For full recipe, added 2T flour, a little less oil and baking powder.

This recipe is not very good.  It is far too sweet , heavy and dry.

Wow.  This is wonderful!!  I mostly followed the exact recipe.  Did soak the cornmeal, which I've never heard of, and then I added 1 cup of sugar instead, and really wish I didn't!!  I love sweet cornbread, but 1 cup was too much!!   Other than that (which was my fault) it is excellent!!

I followed the directions in this recipe to a T, and I was sadly disappointed. The flavor just isn't there. The texture was too dense. It's not a terrible cornbread, just not impressive.

One thing in its favor was the ease of prep.

I had to bake this for twice as long as stated in the instructions, and I should have whisked the milk and eggs little longer to make more fluffy, but overall delicious.

This recipes has quickly become my go-to cornbread recipe and in fact I'm just about to make some to use for stuffing!  I love the accessibility of the recipe, using products we all have on hand, so no last minute trips to the store for buttermilk.  It's moist, a little sweet, and so easy to make.

I've made this dish twice now, and the first time I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out good.  The second time, I doubled the recipe so I could make stuffing with the extra, and increased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  I forgot that I was supposed to soak the cornmeal and just combined everything, but it still came out great!  I think the increase in sugar made it better than the first time.  Definitely not going back to store mixes again!!

It hard to give an actual review since I made some changes according to other reviewers. I switched the corn meal and flour amounts and slightly lowered the sugar. The taste was great, it was really dense however and I think that's from the changes. However, it looked really heavy and dry so not alot of people ate it, but it WAS good. However I think I will stick to my normal cornbread recipe

YUM!!  This is a great recipe!  I made it just as the recipe says and it turned out perfect!  I agree with mixing it for 5 minutes, it makes it better!!  I am from Canada and this is up to my standards for the best cornbread!

I will be adding at least half the amount of sugar the next time I make this. In my opinion, this recipe is good for a breakfast-type sweet cornbread, but I was looking for something more savoury to go with chili. I think when I reduce the sugar it will be just right though.

I made this for a dinner party, with some very minor variation. That is, I drizzled honey over the top once I took it out of the oven. I really like it, but I think next time I'll add honey or an additional 1/3 cup brown sugar to the mix

Delicious cornbread! I too, lost my favorite cornbread recipe and have been trying to find another. Well, I think I may have found it! It's a little sweeter, and very moist...everyone loved it! Like KB of Pantego TX, I mixed the wet ingredients into the dry and let sit for 5min., and used a 12in iron skillet, heated in the pre-heating oven.  It gave the bread a really nice crispy crust! Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the only cornbread I make now. I made a couple changes to the recipe but that was just to suit my taste. I add about 1/2 cup of creamed corn to make it even more moist. I also used brown sugar instead of white.

I made this gluten free, using 2 1/2 c corn meal, 1/2 c gluten free baking flour, 1/2 c corn flour, and 1/4 tsp xanthan gum.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe.  Very good cornbread!  Thank you.  It was just as yummy with honey butter as it was with chili and cheddar cheese!  :)

This came out great! It was more moist and cake-like than most other corn bread recipes I've tried. I had success in halving the original recipe's ingredient measurements and baking in a 9-in round cake pan at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.

This was a great base recipe!  The cornbread turned out crumbly and light (for cornbread).  I modified a bit by putting in 2 cups milk and 1/2 cup honey, used brown sugar instead of white, and put in 1 tsp vanilla.  The family loved it!

Made this to go along with the "Cajun Chicken and Sausage Gumbo" recipe I found here (which is awesome!), and it complimented it perfectly.  Folled the tips to soak the cornmeal - turned out great!

I followed the recipe to the T, except that I added some canned corn kernel (drained and rinsed).  The bread turned out too moist in the middle. After 30min, the centre is still undone. Increasing the baking time - in attempt to fully cook it - caused the exterior to be slightly burnt, but the centre still slightly too moist.

Nothing special, I was expecting something really sweet and cornbready but moist.  It was moist and fluffy, but didn't have a strong corn taste and maybe not as sweet as I would have liked.

I made this to accompany black-eyed-peas last night and it was absolutely wonderful.  I'm glad to have used it as my first attempt at homemade cornbread!  Some say it's too light and a bit dense - but those are the exact reasons I loved it.  It wasn't overpowering but it still held just enough flavor.  I did bake it for 10 minutes less than the recipe called for, but my oven is old and cooks very, very hot.  I actually could have stood to remove it a few minutes sooner but it still turned out wonderfully.

I made this exactly as written. When I combined all the ingredients, I left the mixer on for a few minutes to get it really whipped. Not bad, not the best recipe in the world but it's so easy you can't really complain.

I made this cornbread for the first time this afternoon -- it was good.  Very fluffy and moist but not the most flavorful.  I did soak the corn meal for about 10 minutes and whisked for the five minutes recommended.  I loved the texture but will probably tweak the recipe to add a bit more flavor -- probably with buttermilk and/or salt.

This is a tasty, moist cornbread. I made it and one of my friends, who doesn't like cornbread, thoroughly enjoyed it, so much so that he got more than one piece.   The second time i made this i substituted whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour and it came out just as delicious, admittedly it is a little crumblier but it also seems sweeter.  This would be a great cornbread to sweeten with a little honey, brown sugar or extra white sugar in the baking.  Delicious

I used buttermilk instead of regular milk since I had a carton I needed to use up, but this recipe made the best cornbread I've ever tasted. Best of all, it's ridiculously simple and low maintenance. The boyfriend cooed over it, so it will definitely be part of my regular rotation.

This wasn't really what I wanted in a cornbread. I felt it was a little bland in both texture and flavor. I like more of a cornmeal texture and taste (and more salt would have helped). On the good side: it was moist and held together well. My 10 year old son really liked this cornbread. I did the mixing for 5 minutes part.

Love this cornbread... I made a healthy version with: whole wheat flour homemade unsweetened applesauce (instead of oil)  Oh, and I also switched the cornmeal and flour amounts. I also love using this recipe to make muffins...It makes a lot! =D

Sort of in between a sweet cornbread and a buttermilk cornbread, this recipe was nice but not the best I've tasted. 

Second Attempt: used apple sauce instead of oil...needs a bit more sugar and next time would whip it for five minutes like OP states in comments...to fluff it up a bit.

I switched the amounts for flour and cornmeal, and sifted together flour, baking powder and salt.  I let the cornmeal soak in milk for 10 minutes before mixing everything together.  Also, I used honey instead of sugar and olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  They turned out great! If you are going to use olive oil though, make sure its good quality because you can taste it a bit.   Half the recipe made 12 muffins.

What did I do wrong?  Halved the recipe correctly, used more sugar (almost 1/2 cup for the halved recipe).  Beat 5 minutes and baked immediately.  It came out bumpy, overly smooth looking, had to take out early as it was about to burn.

This is a very good cornbread recipe.  If you like soft, moist, not-too-sweet cornbread, this is for you.  It was easy and cooked beautifully!  I have a family of 5 and could have cut the recipe in half and probably still would have had some leftover.  We are southerners who prefer sweeter, grainier cornbread.  Next time I will increase the amount of cornmeal and sugar and decrease the amount of all-purpose flour a bit.

This cornbread was just the way I like it - not too sweet, not greasy, but moist on the inside and crunchy on the outside. At first I didn't think it was done because it was so light and looked bubbly, but it was done at exactly 30 minutes. I switched the flour and corn meal (as suggested by other people.) To save time, instead of mixing the batter for five minutes, I beat the eggs by themselves until it was fluffy and added it to the mix. I used Rice milk instead of regular milk and it still tasted good. For me, texture is more important than taste for corn bread, and this was the best.

Seemed a bit, as my husband said, too eggy.  Maybe I soaked the corn meal too long but we just didn't enjoy this corn bread.

I followed JWGASA's review (the second one listed) and this turned out great!  I even forgot the eggs and it was still delicious.  Also, the honey butter was a definite hit!!  Will be making this again and again.

Pretty good! It's the perfect cross between homestyle southern cornbread and restaurant cornbread. I followed the recipe exactly except I heated the oil in the pan before filling and the bottom crust came out tastly. My cornmeal was course, and I may use less course cornmeal next time. Overall this is a pretty easy recipe that tastes great... not dry at all!

I put the ingredients in my KitchenAid and let it run for five minutes, then rested it before baking....it turned out fluffly and delicious. I will definitely make this recipe part of my regular rotation.

This is now my default cornbread recipe.  I was making it for turkey stuffing and was going to do from a mix but when I saw how simple this recipe was, I decided to give it a whirl.  It was the first time I'd ever made it from scratch and WOW!  It was SO moist and flavorful.  Just lightly sweet, not overpoweringly sweet like so many I've had.  It held it's shape when cut and didn't fall apart in my hands.  I used polenta style cornmeal and the consistency was perfect.  My husband (the world's pickiest eater) doesn't like cornbread and even he ate some and said it was good.  It was yummy with just butter, I also tried with some honey and very yummy, but my favorite so far is topped with some raspberry jam.

I have been looking for a cornbread recipe my aunt use to make. It was flat and dense and grainy. I hoped this was it but it's not. I was disappointed in the taste of this and will continue searching. In the mean time I'll go back to my usual recipe.

I know this recipe is from Canada, but for all of you folks making cornbread for the first time thought I should let you know that true southern cornbread does not use sugar and uses buttermilk in the recipe.  My in-laws are from the midwest and prefers the Canadian version here but I can not eat it that way.  :)

I have had a lot of cornbread in my lifetime. I grew up in Texas where we regularly ate beans and cornbread. This recipe is definitely one of the best cornbread recipes that I have made. It is very moist, not too dense and just the right amount of sweetness.

Best 'from scratch' recipe I have found! My family of 10 has always preferred a name brand mix and I could never find a recipe that they liked. I finally did. The changes I made was using olive oil instead of veg. oil and buttermilk powder/water because I was out of milk.  I doubled the batch making one 9x13 and 4 mini loaves from it. The loaves I froze for later and we just ate them. Wonderfully moist and flavorful!

PERFECT!!! Based on preference and reviews, I used a mixture of ap flour, cake flour and masa. Also, used honey for 1/4 of the sugar.  Brushed muffin tin with melted honey butter and brushed the tops as well before baking for 18 mins. Halved the recipe and got 9 good sized muffins. Hands down, the best corn bread I've ever made... A touch sweet, but not overly, good corn flavor (but I subbed part masa which adds more cornyness), no bitter aftertaste, wonderful crispy outside (honey butter helped!) soft moist inside, not at all mealy or too dry and crumbly. Might try adding some whole kernels next time, and/or a sprinkle of smoked paprika, and next time I won't halve the recipe now that I know how good it is!  UPDATE:  This freezes vey well. Made an extra loaf, froze it wrapped in foil, then a couple weeks later thawed it and threw it in a 350 oven (still wrapped in foil) for about 30m.  It was so moist and delicious!!! Next I'm gonna try cubing it and baking the cubes to make 'croutons' to use in stuffing =)

This was my first time making cornbread from scratch. Maybe I have been brainwashed by Jiffy, but I prefer a drier, crumbly cornbread. This bread was moist and dense...almost cake-like. Not what I was expecting/preferred. I also felt like it did not have as much of the corn flavor. I am going to try the Buttery Corn Bread recipe next.

Fantastic! I followed others and used a bit more cornbread, a bit less flour, and whisked the whole mixture for a good 5 minutes. Yum!

My husband stated this was THE BEST cornbread he's ever had! Moist, not crumbly, some sweetness but not too much! I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who wants a basic cornbread to go with any meal! :)

This is the best cornbread recipe I've ever had the fortune to make and eat.  What I quickly found out is that you have to cook it in a 9x13 pan and if you beat it with a whisk a bit longer than you think it needs it tastes even better.  Whenever I want to have bread with dinner this is the recipe I use. Heartily recommended.

I loved this!  The perfect cornbread. I made up a bunch of dry mix ingredients and stored in ziplock baggies for a quick dinner. Think of it like making my own box mix without the chemicals!

Great recipe, but I had a quart of apples a friend had canned and she wanted the jar back, so I threw them in the cornbread.  Amazing!  more like dessert than cornbread..  Blueberries will be my next addition

It was pretty good... I added a tablespoon of Vanilla extract.  I wish it had a bit more flavor.  Maybe I will add honey to the mixture, and a bit of brown sugar.  other than that, it was good, but not great.

My husband and I found most cornbread recipes rather tasteless or very dry.  This recipe is terrific; it's the only one we will use from now on.

Very moist and tender cornbread - and so easy to get great results.  Made it with 1/2 brown sugar and soaked the corn meal for 10 mins in the milk.  Wow - totally brought out the nuttiness of the meal.  So glad for the tips that were left in the other reviews!  This is my cornbread recipe now.  Thanks for sharing it!

This was my first time making cornbread from scratch. I wasn't sure how this would turn out b/c the directions didnt specify whether to use self rising corn meal or regular. Also the pan size wasn't mentioned on the original recipe that I printed(from a while ago). I now see that a pan size has been added.  I bought self rising and cooked it in a 9" round pan. I didn't add all the sugar it called for, I used just barely over 1/2 cup. I had to cook it for almost 50 minutes for the middle to cook completely. Once it was FINALLY done, it tasted great. The top was a little crunchy, next time I'll cook it at 375 for 60 minutes. That should make it about perfect. I will def. be making this again though. Bye bye Jiffy!!

Good cornbread. After I started making this recipe, I noticed I was out of vegetable oil, so I used butter instead and still turned out good.

i choose this recipe b/c i liked the fact there was no butter! yay for guilt-free cornbread! i took the advice of other reviewers and also switched the amt of the flour and cornmeal. came out a bit dense but not bad. i will take the recommendations of others and maybe beat the milk/cornmeal mixture next time. served w/ chili, excellent!

Very good! I used buttermilk instead of milk, and increased the buttermilk to 2/3C and let it sit with the corn meal for at least an hour before proceeding with the remainder of the recipe. It turned out great!

Made this customized for a serving of 10 becuase I only had 1 c of cornmeal.  Followed recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  Even my husband who is not a huge cornbread fan said, "Very good Babe!"

I love this cornbread. Everytime I make it, I get soooo many yummy thanks. I do however add 2 tbs flaxseed meal and substitute whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose.

Delicious cornbread. Whisking it for 5 minutes made it light and fluffy and not so dense. We added real butter to make it a little sweeter and it was great!

This was the first time I made cornbread from scratch and it was a big hit with the group I made it for. Everyone was talking about the yummy cornbread. The only reason I took away a star is that it did turn out just a tiny bit dense (after whisking for 5mins as recommended) and it started to dry out rather quickly (the leftovers were about an hour old when I went for seconds and noticed it a bit dry). Other than this this was easy to make and fabulous!

Wonderful!  Easy to make and just sweet enough, especially when served with honey butter.

This is the first time I make cornbread. I absolutely love it. As well as everybody that tried it. It came out very moist with a nice crust...we could not stop eating it. My boyfriend said it's the best one he has tried! Thank you for sharing!

I'm giving this recipe another 5 stars. DELISH !!! Follow to the letter and don't forget to beat the batter the required time. So moist... I got compliments galore the Thanksgiving that I made it ! Thanks for sharing, Patricia.

This is the best cornbread I've ever tasted!  My family loves it too.  It turns out the best when I bake it in stoneware and I use 1 cup sugar instead of 3/4.  DELICIOUS.

I followed the recipe just as it said without making any changes, and I like it just how it is.  Yes it's a bit dense, but delicious none the less.  It's a very easy recipe too, which I always like since I can't spend a lot of time in kitchen.  Having chili for dinner tonight for sure (maybe lunch too!).  :D

If you like typical "American" food meaning VERY SWEET or VERY GREASY then this bread is not for you.  This is a very subtle bread and is delicious.  I too followed others suggestions and switched the Corn meal amt and the flour amt.  I also used a Medium coarse corn meal.  When it was done baking I brushed on a little melted butter and honey.   This bread is awesome and a keeper.  If you are looking for a typical American corn muffin (like in bakeries around the US) this is not for you.  This is what real food should taste like!

This is a great recipe.  The trick is to beat the cornbread a lot (put more air into the batter).  You can also use brown sugar instead of white sugar and it comes out fine.  It's just sweet cornbread.

I took the advice of someone else and reversed the cornmeal/flour measurements. It was ok.  Reminded me very much of a Banana loaf consistency (dense) which I was half expecting.  I can definatly see this going well with somehting spicey like chili.  I would make this again perhaps with some modifications.

I thought this was a really good basic cornbread.  I also switched the cornmeal with the flour and it turned out delish!  One day I will spice this up a bit and add some hot peppers, onions, corn, and cheese for an extra special Mexican Cornbread!  Thanks for the recipe!

Used this cornbread recipe last week and everyone really enjoyed the cornbread.  I did switch the cornmeal and flour as suggested by other reviewers and it worked great.  Made again yesterday for a crowd of 50 to go with a pot of my homemade vegetable beef soup.  Was a huge hit.  Nice and moist, the best cornbread I have made from scratch, ever.  Will use this as my basic cornbread mix from now on.  Had some left overs that I put in the freezer to use when I make cornbread dressing at Christmas.  I used Splenda in place of sugar and worked great.  I did reduce the amount of sweeter used because I did not want the cornbread sweet this time since the soup had a touch of Splenda to counter the acid of the tomatoes.  Thanks for the tasty cornbread recipe.

My family seemed to like this recipe. I thought it was a little to dense and lacked flavor from the cornmeal. After reading reviews I will try the recipe again and beat longer.

Amazingly moist cornbread! I thought that maybe I undercooked it at first because it was so moist but it was thoroughly cooked and thoroughly delicious! The only change I will make next time is to soak the cornbread in buttermilk and add a little more salt. Otherwise, perfect recipe!

AWESOME! I subbed in 1/3 cup sugar with 1/3 cup of honey and the all-purpose flour for white whole wheat flour for the earthy goodness. I also drizzled a little honey on top. The cornbread turned out super moist and held its shape well.  Remember to check the cornbread to make sure it doesn't burn!

I made this recipe exactly like the recipe and cooked it for even longer than the recommended time and the centers were still too soft. One pan I made had a center that was almost completely uncooked. It tasted okay to me but not great and the group of people I made it for hardly touched it.

Well the muffins turned out "okay" but if you are looking for an old fashioned cornbread I would keep on looking further.  These didn´t have enough corn taste for me, something was missing.  There are enough cornbread recipes on Allrecipes so I guess I will keep on baking!

Perfect if you're looking for a light, sweet cornbread. A family favorite around my house.

This recipe was pretty good, although I did make a few changes.  First of all, I cut the recipe in half.  I substituted honey for the sugar and melted butter for the veggie oil.  I then cooked it in a greased (butter) cast iron skillet.  It turned out to be smoother than other cornbread I have made.  Maybe something to do with the soaking.  Thanks for sharing!

This was good, but not "the best I've ever had."  It's the same as the packaged stuff you'd find in the baking aisle... so if it's cheaper for you to make it from scratch and you have all the ingredients on hand, then it's worth it.  It tasted very average to me and seems like a good starting point for customizing... adding ingredients to make your personal touch. It wasn't good warm out of the oven and we had to wait until it was room temperature before anyone liked it.  And then, like I said, it was just average. I'm not fond of making things from scratch to come up with "average" so I'll probably spend the $2 and buy the package next time.

A great recipe that yields a big pan of delicious cornbread! I did end up making a few modifications though. I soaked the cornmeal in only 2 cups of milk for 10 minutes.In addition, since I like my cornbread chunky, I added a whole can of drained whole kernal corn to the batter. However, I reserved half a cup of the corn "juice" from the can and added it to the batter, rather then the additional half a cup of milk, giving it an even richer corn flavor. Overall, the cornbread was very moist, dense,not too sweet, and had a great flavor.

Very nice but a bit sweet for our liking.  Served with chilli.  I was craving cornbread and this sort of did the trick.  Not as nice as a traditional cornbread though(cast iron skillet and a wood stove) but a good alternative.  Will make again but use less sugar.  Living in the UK I used polenta which I think is the same as cornmeal!

This was mediocre. Not what I was expecting. It just didn't have enough TASTE for me. I used 2 cups cornmeal and 1 1/2 cups flour and I am really glad I did. But I was looking for something with more taste. I think I will stick to my old cornbread recipe.

This is a great sweet cornbread, very moist and easy to make and tastes a lot like those mixes you get only better. I substitute soy milk and flax "eggs" to make it vegan.

Excellent recipe.  Instead of the 2/3 cups of sugar, I substituted with Splenda blend and added 1/2 cup of creamed corn but that was it.  Great taste.  thank you!

Very good cornbread.  My husband is a very southern man and he said it was one of the best cornbreads he's had!  Now that's a compliment.  Update: 11/25/09 - just made this again and followed the suggestion to beat the mixture together for at least 5 minutes.  Made a very light, yet stick together cornbread.  Just perfect!

This cornbread was amazing!  I followed others' advice and switched the amounts for the flour and cornmeal, soaked the cornmeal for 10 min., and beat the batter for 5 min.  It produced a dense, moist cornbread that everyone loved!  I served it with honey butter at a turkey dinner.  I will definitely be making this again!

Very easy recipe.  The middle was a little gooey for my taste, but that may be because I cooked it in an iron skillet instead of a baking pan.  Tasted wonderful.  Next time I may try putting a little honey-butter on top a few minutes before it's done.  Definitely will make again.

I had high expectations for this cornbread after reading the reviews.  And I went into it ready to fall in love since I'm a big fan of cornbread and tend to like any food a little on the sweeter side. But this just didn't blow me away. Mine seemed to have an odd aftertaste that I didn't care for. Maybe that's attributed to the brand of corn meal I used but alas, I won't make it again. I'll stick to the Jiffy mix!

This is not at all soft and fluffy...it is quite dense.  Different from what I have expected and read about.  I soaked the cornmeal for 20 mins, but I didn't mix it in a mixer for > 5 mins.  Could that be the reason?  I also added a tablespoon of honey.  It is quite disappointing.  It turned up flat and dense.

This is really good cornbread.. I hate dry cornbread and I never have had this one come out that way. I make this a few times a month and my kids cheer when they smell it. I do cook it in a larger pan and it isnt as dense. Thanks for sharing

I'm not sure what this was missing, but I definitely like the Jiffy box mix cornbread better than this. I followed the recipe, and it was good, but not as good as the box mix stuff. Not sure if my inability to locate my cast iron skillet is what detracted from this or not. I may try again after trying a few other recipes on here.

I actually joined the site just to add a review here...this is the best cornbread that I've ever tasted.  I let the cornmeal soak for 10 minutes, and mixed the whole thing with a stand mixer for 5 minutes.  It was amazing.  We had it with dinner last night and today when my husband was making a menu for the week he kept thinking of meals that went with cornbread because he wants to have it again already!

I made this recipe for the first time following the ingredients exact and it turned out perfect and delicious! The only thing I did different was use a cast iron skillet to cook the bread in and it turned out awesome. This sweet, cornbread recipe is a keeper.

This was my first time making the bread.  I made it exactly as the recipe said and it came out great.  I wasn't sure at first about the cornmeal mixture (milk + cornmeal) but it turned out great.  I am going to try another poster's suggestion of 1/2 white sugar & 1/2 brown sugar the next time.  All in all my husband loved it!!!!

Great recipe! I used 1/3c dark brown sugar (didn't have light) and 1/3c white sugar as suggested by others. The corn bread was so delicious, and a rich egg yolk color. It did take a good 40+ minutes to bake though-which I'll plan for next time.

This is my favorite corn bread recipe.  I've been making it for about 4 years now and decided it was time to rate it.  Since there are only 2 of us, I cut the recipe to 1/3 and bake it in my small cast iron skillet which makes a nice crust on the bottom no matter what recipe you use, but this one is Excellent!

I baked this cornbread before reading the most recent reviews which expressed concern about the recipe, however, it turned out just fine for us.  I served it with flank steak seasoned with a spicy mexican dry rub and black beans with jalapenos and the sweetness of the cornbread was a very nice balance with the spicy steak and beans.  I will say it tasted less "corny" than other cornbreads I have made.  Next time I might swap the flour measurement with the cornmeal measurement.  The texture was nice...it was a high riser.

Delicious. Taking other reviews suggestion I put it in the kitchen maid and left it going for about five minutes so I would get that fluffy taste. Wonderful. Thanks

My husband doesn't usually care for cornbread, but he even said he wouldn't mind having this one again.  I let it soak for about 15 minutes.  I mixed it in the kitchen aid for 10 minutes, but it was still very dense.

I'm not a cornbread fan, but this is the best I have personally had. My family thoroughly enjoys it each time I make it, and it is not that hard to make. Beat it longer than recipe says that way it is not too dense, and allow to sit the entire 5 minutes :)

I just made this today, and to my delight, it turned out beautifully. I was a bit worried, because I didn't use an electric mixer at all (just let my boyfriend go at it for a few minutes :P , but it was delicious. Dense, moist...mmm. Thank you!

I have made this too many times to count and it always turns out great! Normally, I reduce serving size to 6 and use 1 egg instead of less than one egg. I mix ground beef with salsa, cumin and chili powder and put in pan, spread cheddar cheese and sliced black olive then pour cornbread batter over (2.8 liter casserole dish). Cook for about 30 minutes at 395 degrees (or longer if you like drier cornbread). Always turns out great! I have made lots of cornbread looking for the best one and I think this is it. Soaking in milk for 10 minutes is the key for me.

Crisp on the outside, moist on the inside.     Perfect! My family liked the crunchy bits of cornmeal - the result of soaking for the recommended 5 minutes.  Lost my favorite sweet cornbread recipe, but found that, because of the yummy crunch of this one, I may just stop looking.  Very good!

WOW Moist!!
1. Whoever said mixxing it for 10 minutes was a genius. I just left the batter in the blender and did other stuff. 2. My one comment is that this did not hae much corn bread flavor but that might have been because I used white corn meal!! Otherwise AMazing!!

i love a sweet, high, moist northern cornbread. the secret of this recipe is SOAKING. i soak for up to 20 minutes sometimes when i'm busy, and recognized that the corn bread turns out even MORE moist than before with no loss in height.

I add a can of corn and use wheat flour instead. The white flour version was delicious too. This recipe is a keeper; I make it for Thanksgiving, Christmas...any occasion I can think of really.

Not bad, but not exactly bread. When I looked at the ingredients and quantities, I thought it would make a sweetish cakey bread, which it did. 
Tasted great, but not exactly what homesteader cornberad is supposed to be.

Wow! Loved it. By the number of great reviews, I see that many others loved it too! I am not that great at baking and I almost cried tears of joy when it came out perfect! 

Thanks!

Best cornbread I ever made. Didn't change a thing, although I might reduce the sugar slightly when I make it again, which I surely will. It was a big hit at my house, especially with my 3 year-old granddaughter. Thanks for a keeper.

que horrible! ok.  i gave it 3 stars because i am sure there is no possible way this recipe can be as horrible as my cornbread turned out.  it has to be me.  any pointers on this one?  my cornmeal completely separated to the bottom and the top (under a lovely golden brown layer) was gooey and uncooked even after 40 minutes.  the whole production was oily, rubbery and awful.  someone help me!

This recipe was GREAT!!!  Not too sweet, not too gritty, just right.  The honey butter was a nice touch to sweeten it a bit if you wanted.  This was a hit with my entire family.  I switched the amount of cornmeal and flour and used butter instead of oil.  I also greased the glass 9x13 dish with butter to give the edge a nice flavor and a subtle crisp.  It worked great!!

This is a good solid corn bread recipe.  The outer parts tend to be a bit dry whereas the middle sections are more moist.  This is my only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  I sprinkled some sugar on top of the pan before putting it in the oven and it sweetened it a bitmore.  This was a hit with friends and prefect with chili.

Though this baked a little more slowly than we thought it would, probably because we had to use a medium-sized pie pan instead of a 9x13, this was delicious. Moist, dense but not too dense. We will definitely make this again.

This just doesn't cut it for me. It's acceptable but why just settle? I found it too oily, which kills some of the flavor and to sweet (and hear my friends say I've got all sweet teeth :) I really think cornbread needs to be cooked in muffin tins, not lined with paper but generously buttered or greased for that crisp outside. I'll keep looking.

Obviously my family is in the minority, but we did not like this cornbread at all.  We found it very dry, even though I followed the directions and soaked the cornmeal, and lacking in flavor.  Because I used King Arthur organic white whole-wheat flour instead of white, which could have changed the texture a bit, I am rating two stars instead of the one star rating my family and friends gave it.  This recipe is probably not for you if you like a moist, cake like cornbread.

Perfect! Just Perfect! I have been searching for a cornbread recipe, and after 5 or 6 different recipes (or imposters) I found this one! The only change I made was that I switched around the amounts of Flour and Cornmeal. I didn't even wait the 5 minutes so the cornmeal could soak. I just threw it all together and it was UNREAL. It was thick and rich, with the perfect amount of sweetness. It isn't one of those fluffy sort of conbreads. It is dense and full of flavor. The Yellow Cornmeal just gives it the most gorgeous color too. Perfect crust on the outside, too. I can't say enough about it. It's amazing. My new cornbread recipe.

This is such an amazing cornbread recipe!  I made mine into cornbread muffins and put hotdog thirds in half of them--I really suggest this!  They are so good warm with butter or a sprinkling of melted cheese.

This came out beautiful.  I followed the directions exactly.  The only thing I would change is to add more cornmeal and less flour....but that's only my personal preference.  Other than that, it was delicious. Would definitely make again.

i've attempted to make cornbread about 5 times so far, all previous attempts ending in the trash. this recipe was excellent; moist, soft, with just the right amount of sweetness. i followed the recipe exactly with the submitter's recommendation to mix for 5 minutes. goes great with honeyed butter.

I have made this cornbread twice in one week and have gotten amazing reviews on it.  You have to make sure that you let the milk and cornmeal set for the 5 min.  That must be the reason for the moistness of this bread.  I have definitely added this recipe to my personal favorite cookbook, where all my family's faves go.

Thanks to the author for the most amazing cornbread I have ever had....

My husband and I love this recipe!  It's so easy--we make it all the time.  It's the perfect consistency and not too sweet like other recipes we've tried. It's delicious with pork green chili.

I followed the recipe exactly, and I thought it was a touch too sweet.  My other half liked it, although we don't eat CB that often.  It was a cake-like consistency and the edges were crunchy.  Next time I'd like to add creamed corn and I'll reduce the sugar.

I just tried this cornbread last night and was slightly disappointed. It looked beautiful, cut well and was neither too dry nor too moist, BUT it didn't really have a lot of corn flavor to me.  It was good, but not great. I do think that this would be an excellent cornbread to serve to people who are new to cornbread, as it does have a very nice texture, and the milder corn flavor would appeal.

This is one of the best cornbreads I've ever eaten. Moist, sweet but not too sweet. I made it just as written, took it to our Bible study group. They gobbled it up immediately and everyone asked for the recipe.

I was not that impressed with this corn bread. I thought it came out very dense and kind of dry and the left-over were even dryer. I like my corn bread light and fluffy and this for sure was not. The taste was pretty good, just the texture wasn't. My husband really liked it though.

Very good cornbread. Followed the recipe exactly. Came out not too dry and very delicious!
My boyfriend thinks it could be a little sweeter, but I like it the way it is.

I've never been a huge cornbread fan, but I cannot get enough of this stuff! I made it with chili for a group of about eight college students, and it was completely devoured. I've shared it with everyone I know, and it's been very popular! I followed the recipe to a T, including the recipe writer's suggestion to beat for five minutes, and I couldn't be happier. Great results!

My mother-in-law who was born and grew up in Georgia probably would not consider this  cornbread. It is more like a cake! It is not the type of cornbread that goes into the cornbread dressing (that was why I made the cornbread to begin with). But  it is so yummy I am eating it with my afternoon tea! It is the first time I even attempt to eat cornbread after it becomes cool. I have finally found the kind of cornbread that would make all my non-cornbread eating friends in Tokyo love this "southern" staple.

I found this to be a great recipe. My boyfriend is lactose intolerant and allergic to wheat so I substituted 3/4 cup rice flour for every cup of wheat flour. As well, I substituted the milk for vanilla flavoured rice milk. I soaked the cornmeal for a good 15 minutes. Instead of baking it in a large baking dish, I made muffins. I don't think I will do this again as the cornbread really stuck to the paper muffin cups. Regardless, however, the cornbread turned out nice and moist and the taste is wonderful with just the perfect amount of sweetness. Thanks for the recipe.

this cornbread was the perfect consistency and it looked perfect, but it was very bland.  not sweet at all.  I prefer cornbread that tastes closer to a corn muffin.  this wasn't even close.

Very moist, which is what I was looking for. The only thing I will do differently next time is beat the batter a bit longer to alleviate the density of the final product.

This turned out really dry for me.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding some cheddar cheese.  It took about 45 minutes to bake (the center was still soupy at 30 minutes) and the edges ended up too brown due to the extra baking time I had to add.  I'm going to stick to my last cornbread recipe.

Delicious!! Was expecting a crowd for chili, so I doubled the recipe using  a 9x13 AND a 9x9 glass baking dish and baked cornbread at 350 for about 50 min. Came out great...nice and deep, not flat. I also used half milk, half soy milk and heaping tablespoons of baking powder as suggested. Everyone loved it.

Best cornbread my husband, friends and I have ever had! The only thing is I have always used Baking Soda instead of Baking Powder and it turns out so moist and fluffy! Even though it's the wrong ingredient, I will continue to make it like that bc it's soooo good!

Outstanding cornbread.  I made it dairy free by using plain, unsweetened soy milk and it turned out great.  I baked it for only 30 minutes.  Very moist and sweet - good consistency.  Excellent, easy recipe!  I love that I didn't need to pull out my mixmaster too.  Will definitely make this every time I make chili - was a perfect compliment to chili.

I had my heart set on a sweet cornbread (as described), but this cornbread is not that sweet. The texture was fine, but the flavor was lacking.  My family liked it, apparently I'm the only one that did not.

Very good.  Enjoyed it thoroughly.  I was surprised with how heavy it was.  Yummy!

Would not make this again, it was OK but don't think I would call it cornbread. We are use to the real southern cornbread and this was more like a cake.

I followed the recipe, but did add additional 2tbsp apple sauce to the batter! Turn out to be very moist and just right! When I checked at 30min, mine was completly done. I'll check it more frequent and sooner next time.

The cornbread was a little on the dry side, or so I thought.  All of my guests seemed to enjoy it though and it did end up tasting a bit better the next day.  Perhaps, do in part to the fact that I wasn't concerned about anyone other than myself enjoying it the second day.

In my oven it only needed 25-30 minutes.  Otherwise it was very tasty, especially with honey butter.

I really like this cornbread. I used white whole wheat flour and white flour together and reduced the sugar to just 3 tablespoons. 2/3 cup of sugar sounded too sweet. I like cornbread with just a hint of sweetness. This is a recipe that I will make again and again.

I made this recipe last night and it's the best cornbread that I've ever had.  I even managed to make it without having ever made cornbread before.  It's got a sweet hint to it, but it's not overwhelming.

I really liked this recipe. It doesn't fall apart as easily as some cornbreads and it is very easy to make. My husband has a cornbread recipe that calls for 3 cubes of butter and I was happy to find a recipe that's quite a bit healthier and still delicious.

I thought this cornbread was the best!  It has a very nice texture and tastes great.  I am rating it a 4 because my husband did not like it.  He said the texture was not cornbread but more cake like which it was.  But it is great!

Since I'm not American I didn't have an idea how "real" corbread tasted like. This was a lot more like a sugar cake than bread, but I guess it was good. Certainly not what I expected, but good. =3

This cornbread recipe is my absolute favorite. I always feel like I'm having dessert when I eat this. Depending on my mood I will put less sugar in, it's still a great corn bread, just doesn't taste like cake ;)

The cornbread was really easy to make, but I expected more.  It was really dry and needed just a little more sweetness.  Even with the above, it went well with the Mexican Chicken Soup from this website.

We love this cornbread!  I do make a few substitutions b/c my 1 year old has a milk allergy.  I use soy milk to replace the milk and it works great.  I also  use 1/2 whole wheat flour, just to make it a little more wholesome.  Try it, however you prefer. I think you're going to like it.

i have tried dozens of cornbread recipes and this is the best one yet and definatly  better then the box stuff. i'm not sure what the other people did to mess up there batches but i will definatly make this again and again and again.not greasy at all. a little more salt needed next time. but other wise it had the right amount of sweetness and texture was a little different but overall a delicious corn bread.

This is cornbread I've been looking for.  So simple, and so good.  I always use a stone ground cornmeal, and make it into muffins.  Then I top it with a honey/butter glaze (equal parts of melted butter and honey mixed together).  This tastes just like Famous Dave's muffins (minus that smokey flavor).  YUM.  These are good.

Terrific! I usually add something, though. It's perfect as is, though. I like to add corn or dried parsley. And you can adjust the sweetness.

Eureka!  I was looking for a recipe that made danser cornbread (kinda like the kind at Golden Corral), and I definitely found it in this one!  The only change I'm going to make is to add a little more sugar, and that's only because my husband likes his cornbread sweeter.  Otherwise, I LOVE this recipe and I'll definitely be making it again!  Plus, it makes a lot more than most recipes, which is good, b/c I, my husband, my dad, AND my son all love cornbread so it goes pretty quick!  Thanks for posting!!

I've never been a fan of corn bread so when my boyfriend asked me to make it I had no idea where to start.  I read the reviews for this reciepe and decided to try it. All I have to say is that I'm a fan of corn bread now!!!

This cornbread was good, but I like a sweeter cornbread personally. It was also too dense for my liking, whereas I like a more fluffy cornbread. There is definitely better cornbread recipes than this one, so I would try another one first.

Flavorwise, I like the Waikiki cornbread recipe from this site better.  Texturewise, this is much better.  Very firm and moist and does not crumble or fall apart easily like the other recipe.  This recipe was also very easy.  Actually, my seven year old made the cornbread!  I just supervised and helped when needed.  I served this with lentil soup.  I will continue to use this one for soups and chilis but the other one for thanksgiving and christmas.

I have never made homemade cornbread before and this is very easy!  It's VERY good with chili!!  I like it alot better than the box kind, but my family thinks it needs a little more sugar...it's kind of bland.  All in all, I will make this one again.

I have never made cornbread before and honestly I've always hated the stuff. This is a completely different story! It is incredible. Super fast and easy to make. I was concerned there was going to be too much of it but my 2 and 6 year old daughters gobbled it up! I really like it too. I made some honey pecan butter to go with it and it came out perfect. This is  going to be a keeper in my family!

Not at all impressed. The only change I made was using melted butter instead of oil and it was flavorless, dense and not sweet at all. I would definately suggest adding more sugar. Who knows, maybe I should of used oil...but who doesn't like butter on their cornbread : )

The 5 minutes is a long time....but well worth it. This cornbread is sweet, moist, and golden brown. I make it in a cast iron cornbread pan, so I can only make 8 at a time, I bake and freeze the rest to use later. It is even better later.

A very good sweet, moist cornbread recipe. The only change I made was that I used a self rising cornmeal mix (all I had at the time). I like a little bit more of a grainy texture to my cornbread (like at the Cracker Barrel), but my husband, who is not a cornbread fan, ate this up.

I made muffins with this recipe. We didn't like the taste or the texture. We like a sweeter cornbread. It was bland and rubbery. The paper wouldn't peel away without pulling clumps of muffin with it. Maybe it had to do with the brand of ingredients I used.

This is absolutely the best cornbread I have ever made! And I've made alot! The only change I've made is that I use a cast-iron skillet to cook it in the oven instead of a 9x13. I think it gives it more flavor and a crispier crust! Yum!

This is the best cornbread recipe.  It has made an appearance at every holiday and chili cook-off for the past three years!  Be sure to use a cast iron skillet for baking.  Tastes great with a little butter and honey!  Yum!

too dense for my taste and also way too much batter for the one pan in the directions so it took forever to bake

This was very easy to make, but when I made it turned out a little dry.  Otherwise it tasted great.

Great cornbread for making cornbread dressing (stuffing).  I didn't like it alone.  But I've been looking a long time for a cornbread for my dressing and this is it! Thanks.

i dont know what i did wrong but i followed the recipe exactly and mine separated in the oven leaving a sweet mush of flour on top and a dense corn layer on the bottom, plus it was really oily and when i took it out of the oven i put it on a kitchen towel and it soaked through the towel with oil... gross. i used half a cup like the recipe says.  anyways hopefully yours will turn out better but i am looking for a new recipe

This recipe turned out awesome.  I didn't change a single thing.  It was moist and fluffy... fluffier than any cornbread I've made before.  I took it to a dinner party and professional chefs complimented how good it was.  I think next time I'll add some jalapenos or green chilies and cheese and serve it with chili.  Awesome.

Although the flavor was very good (I halved the amount of sugar), this came out flat and rubbery. Plus I was irritated that when you print this recipe out there is no pan size on it and I had to call a friend to go online for me and tell me what it said.

Everyone loved it! This cornbread was very moist. I cut down on the sugar by just a coupld of TBS and I think next time I will make the recipe as is, because I'd like to try it a bit sweeter. I like things saltier than most, I think, so next time I will add just a bit more salt. Baking time was accurate.

My boyfriend considers himself a cornbread connoussiuer and he loved it.

This was a really great recipe.  We are cooking low fat and this was a perfect replacment for the high fat cornbread.  I used egg beaters instead a real egg and added a little taco seasoning to spice it up a bit.  It was really good.  Next time I think I'll try putting a small about of creamed corn.  This one is real keeper if you are trying to lower you fat intake or not.

This is good and very moist.  For this southerner, it's a bit sweet for me, but I'm sure for those used to sweet cornbread, it's perfect.  I'll keep the recipe, just cut back on the sugar and hope it stays as moist!

Fantatic cornbread.  Just sweet enough, just fluffy enough.  I baked it in a square tin for 30 minutes exactly and it came out perfect!  I greased the pan with shortening.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to do that, but I did, and it came out of the pan with no problems.

Was good. A little more cakey than I'm used to, but good. I'm thinking I'll have a bit less flour and more cornmeal next time.

The cornbread was very moist with a golden brown crust.  It did not taste gritty like some cornbread and was pretty sweet.

Good basic recipe and easy to make. I like my corn bread sweet so next time I'll put a little sugar. We eat it sliced with butter. Yum! I have a recipe I usually make. I'll have to put them side by side to see which is better because they are both very good. Not grainy!

Very EASY to make. I'm an American living in Australia and every year we host a 4th of July BBQ.  This year I made this to go with some veggie chili. Everyone raved about this bread - many have never had cornbread before.  The guests were eating even if they didn't have the chili.  I made this the night before and just popped back in the oven to re-heat for about 10 mins before serving.  Best if served warm. The little that we had left over we ate with breakfast the next morning- I would recommend toasting however-  toasted on a hot plate or griddle.  I will be making this again.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out really well. However I found it to be a bit bland tasting, it just seemed to be missing something - spices maybe? Good basic recipe, but I'm going to keep looking for something with a little more flavor.

This is wonderful cornbread!!! I made muffins and they had a nice golden color...slightly sweet. Crunchy on the outside and moist and tender on the inside. Absolutely delicious!!! My husband hates cornbread and he didn't really mind this one. He prefers bread over cornbread, but that's ok more cornbread for me!!! Will make again and again when I crave cornbread! Thanks!

This was good. I wish it would have been a little more moist. Maybe I cooked it too long? I'll try it again. It definetely had a nice taste to it though. Also very easy to make!

This was exactly the kind of recipe I was looking for.  There are thousands of ways to make cornbread and this is the way I like it.  I did however 1/2 the amount of sugar and cook it in a hot, oiled iron skillet for a crispy crust.

What a wonderful recipe!!!  I made this on Sunday for a church picnic, it went over great!  I used condensed milk, and also added 1/3 stick of butter to the recipe.  It was to delish!

Tastes beautiful, made exactly as is.
This fills 2 9X9 pans for me, which is a lot. We just loved it, but it wasnt' as good the next day, heated up. Super right out of the oven though, and is great, as another reviewer stated, w/ the chicken tortilla soup recipe on this site!

This is an excellent recipe & is everything I hoped it would be.  I've been looking for an excellent cornbread recipe for years & finally found it!

I served it with chili, sour cream & cheese & it was excellent.  

It was moist and held together well.  Soaking the corn meal in milk before mixing helped it not be grainy (something I've never liked about cornbread).

I thought this could actually be just a bit sweeter.  It was moist and dense, so I will try it again with a little more sugar.

I am Texan, born and bred.  This is the best cornbread I have ever eaten, hands down. I usually half the sugar, cause we don't like it too sweet.  My friend from Mississippi and I could eat a pan of this with some cold milk. When I serve this, people ask if I made it from scratch or if it's a mix.  They always take home the recipe.

A delicious cornbread!!! I'd only ever made cornbread from a box before and was a bit intimidated by this but this was fantastic!  My only change was that I used buttermilk instead of milk as I was out of milk.  The taste was a little too tangy right out of the oven, but by the time we ate it at dinner the tanginess was gone and it was a moist, sweet cornbread.  Thanks!

This is my staple cornbread recipe. The first time I made this, I didn't have any baking powder on hand, so I used self-rising flour and cornmeal, and it turned out very nicely, so this is how I make it everytime.

I tinkered with this recipe so much, I'm not sure what the original product is supposed to taste like. I switched the ratios of cornmeal and flour. I put in half whole wheat for the flour. I used flaxseed meal instead of veg. oil. i threw in corn, onions, and pepperjack cheese. I used yogurt instead of milk. I baked it in a cast iron skillet. I only used half the recipe. I will eat this for the rest of the week, and be happy.

Its hard for me to rate since it was first time I tried cornbread but I liked it. I switched the flours amounts according the other reviews and soaked cornmeal for 10 min. I reduced rec by half, used 9x9 pan and baked for 15 min. I do not think it needs additional sugar, it was sweet enough for us. Next time I will add jalapenos peppers for my husband.

Excellent!  Very moist and great consistency - will definitely make again.  Only suggestion would be to perhaps increase the sugar to 1 cup (I'll try that next time) - it was mildly sweet (and very good), but we usually like it a little sweeter.

This was the first recipe I ever used to make cornbread.  Turned out great, my kids ate it up and I also used it as the base for a stuffing.  I defintely don't need to look around for any other recipe.

Simply fabulous!  This recipe produces a dense, rich, moist, flavorful cornbread with a moist interior and a cripsy exterior.  This is rather sweet, which we like.  The best cornbread recipe we've tried.

Fabulous! Made it exactly as listed but didn't soak the cornmeal. I just mixed the dry ingredients and then the liquids and then combined the two. Perfect! Served it with chili--comfort food doesn't get any better. Think I'll make some more right now!

I was looking for a real flavorful way to make cornbread and I was delighted with the results I found when trying this recipe.  This cornbread is great with a meal or by itself.  I like to serve it with butter and a glass of milk.

This cornbread is exactly what the doctor ordered for my daughter and I! My mother, more of a Kentucky traditionalist, disagrees, prefering, instead, the dry non-sweet bread she knew in her youth. But, we just come back for more of this wonderful treat! We eat it various ways, both just with butter or margerine, all the way to slicing it and serving it like a cornbread pancake. It is easy, and easily worth the little trouble it is. We have also switched the amount of flour down, and the cornmeal up, as other commentors recommend. It's just a variation on the prize. Try this one!

Yum - very moist and tasty.  I halfed the recipe, but used l cup each of flour and corn meal, added half a cup of shredded sharp cheddar and a 4 oz. tin of fire roasted green chilies.(slightly drained) It was VERY well received by my husband, who has used the same old recipe forever and thought nothing could beat it.  This beats BIG TIME any recipe I've ever used. He asked me to make sure I kept this recipe for next time, and I certainly will!

This was very good.  Very moist.  I did listen to other reviews and switched cornmeal/flour amounts.  Next time I will halve the recipe as it makes a ton.  Thank you, will make again!

Terrific!!! Made the switch between the cornmeal and flour and soaked cornmeal for 10 min as suggested.  Upped the sugar 1 1/4 Cup (my bad) because I like my cornbread sweeter.  Thank you to everyone who contributed in making this cornbread awesome.

Not good.  Amusement Park Cornbread from this site is way better.  Lacking sweetness and texture is not good.

WOW! This was much better than I expected it to be.  I served it with a chicken tortilla soup and it was such a comforting meal.  The cornbread is wonderful as leftover too...20 seconds in the microwave made it hot & fresh again.  I'll be making this often!

Great recipe, but I made corn muffins with the changes suggested in the other reviews -- switched portions of cornmeal and flour and used 1 1/4 cup sugar instead of 2/3.  My family loved it!

I've got to agree with the previous 2 reviews - the texture of this cornbread wasn't good.  Very rubbery, with a not-quite-done feeling to it, even after the prescribed baking time.

Nice, sweet corn flavor, but the texture was somewhat rubbery.  Made a ton, which was unfortunate because it wasn't a big hit so there were tons of leftovers.  Toasted the day-old, added butter and honey - that was pretty good.  Still, wouldn't make it again.

Excellent recipe!  The bread was very moist and had a nice flavor.  I've only ever made cornbread from a mix, but am living in Scotland and don't have mixes available.  I found this recipe just as easy and tasty.

This turned out good, moist and good texture.  I had some limitations though - it was a group lunch thing and all we had was a small toaster oven, so I had to use a 9x7 baking dish.  I should have scaled down the recipe, but I didn't and the middle started oozing out over the top of the cornbread, which was already cooked.  Ooops!  :)  It cooked longer, about an hour, but in the end it tasted really good, it just didn't have that perfect cornbread appearance because of the toaster oven I had to use.

Good recipe!  I have not made cornbread before (well, other than Jiffy brand boxed cornbread!) and was very pleased with the results.  I followed other reviewers' advice and swapped the amounts of flour and cornmeal.  I also followed the advice of soaking the cornmeal for at least 10 minutes (instead of only 5).  It turned out great, thanks for the recipe.

OK, this really is the best cornbread recipe!  Followed the directions almost exactly - except I added the eggs and oil to the milk/cornmeal mixture, then added in the dry (after leaving the milk/cornmeal mixture sit), and that I used almost a full cup of sugar.  Next time I will use a little more than a cup of sugar.  mmmmmmm.  Thanks!

This recipe is AMAZING! I added 1/4 cup chopped jalapenos & 1/4 cup whole kernal corn that I just mashed a little with a fork. I added that in after everything was mixed. Other than that, I followed it exactly, & it made amazingly moist, yummy cornbread. The cooking time & everything was very precise.

This is by far the best cornbread we have ever had. I couldn't believe how moist it was. We like Boston Market's cornbread, and actually that is what I expected. This was way better! The only change I made was I added 1 1/4 c sugar, I let it stand for 10 min, and beat it for 5 min on low per other suggestions here. I will definitely make this again!

Very good!  The only thing was that I wasn't sure what size pan to use and I use one too small, so my bread is a little thicker than I prefer (still wonderful).  I would use a 9x13 next time.  Great recipe.  Thanks!

I'd never made cornbread from scratch before I found this recipe.  The corn bread was absolutely wonderful.  It was nice and sweet, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  I can't wait to make it again.

I like my cornbread to be cooked into a cast iron skillet.  I think that is where I went wrong with this recipe.  My cornbread came out very heavy.  I had to cook it about 10-15 minutes longer than what the recipe called for because the middle was too “doughy.”  What I did like about it was that it did not fall apart like the “Sweet Cornbread” recipe I tried, but it was too heavy.  Maybe I will try it again in a 9x13 pan like the recipe calls for and then I will hopefully have better luck.

This cornbread was the best I've ever made.  I added about a tablespoon more sugar to make it a bit sweeter and a tablespoon more milk to make it a little more moist.  Everybody loved it.

I thought this was only ok.  I was disapointed becuase of all the raving reviews.  It wasn't very corny and it stuck to the pan.  I wasn't sure if I need to grease it or not, so I didn't.  It also cooked alot quicker than the time listed.

Soaking the cornmeal in milk makes all the difference. I would often take in my cornbread the wrong way or something and it would make me choke on the dry mealyness of it (best way to put it). This is the most edible and tastiest cornbread I've had. Everyone I've served it to has asked for the recipe.

This is by far the best cornbread I have ever made, and only the second best I have ever tasted.  First, of course, always stays with Grandmama!!  I use this for bread and I use it for stuffing and it's wonderful for either.  I get raves on it and pass along the recipe every time I get asked.  Good going, Patricia!!

I didn't find much flavour in this cornbread. The texture was bang-on, but it wasn't sweet and didn't really taste like anything... 
I made individual loaves instead of one large loaf. I think final cooking time in the mini-loaf pan was somewhere in the 18-minute range...

This is truely the end all be all of Cornbread.  I love cornbread when it is moist and hate it when it is dry.  This is by far the most moist and enjoyable cornbread I have ever tried. Two yumms up from me. by the way I know a single batch should be enough, but my family insists on a double batch so they can have it for dessert with honey butter or jam as well.

This cornbread is delicious- very moist with a hint of sweetness, lightly crisp on the outside. It is as if I were at someone's grandmother's home eating good old fashioned country cooking. There is not a better cornbread recipe to be found! (I served it with Chili con Carne II by Fay Jones and it was the PERFECT meal. Thanks so much Ms. Bergstrom!!!

By far the best cornbread recipe I've tried from this site!  I made it as written, and after tasting, did not feel I had to make adjustments!

This cornbread turned out great! Next time I will switch the corn meal and flour amounts as others suggested and it will be perfect! I will also cut the recipe in half because it made A LOT of cornbread...I used a 12 inch round pan!

I've never had cornbread before so thought I would give it a go. It was so easy to make and turned out delicious! The only change I made was the cooking time. It took about 45mins to cook through. I used a loaf tin which I am not sure is the right tin to use. Unfortunatley my Fiance decided he doesn't like cornbread - all the more for me :)

Cut recipe in half and used a 8x8 pan.  Did not have much cornbread flavor but everyone still ate it and it went well with the spicy chili we were having.  I am not sure how to increase the cornbread flavor - maybe increase the cornmeal and decrease the flour?

Very good, super easy. Just what I wanted. I'm not sure if it's cheaper than the box version, but it's just as good or better, and I always like to make homemade *anything* when I get the chance. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

This was the best ever!  So tasty, moist and sweet and not dry at all.  My only problem was that even after 50 min or so, it still wasn't done in the middle.  I followed the recipe in the cookbook, not online, exactly.  In the book it tells you to use an 8 X 8 pan and this is wrong!  No wonder mine was not done!  So be careful and only follow the online recipe.  I will definately try again.

This cornbread was just "okay".  Nobody in my family thought it was the "best ever".  The first batch, I tried substituting the oil for applesauce but we didn't like it and didn't eat it. Almost always applesauce works great as a substitute.  My kids did notice though that putting Cool Whip on top tastes pretty good with the cornbread instead of butter :)

This was a very quick and easy recipe, and it tasted so good!  I LOVE cornbread, but never found the right recipe, but this is IT!  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was perfect.  Next time, I think I'll add a bit of honey to the batter!

My husband is a BIG fan of cornbread. My old recipe was his grandma's, so he was skeptical of a new one. He absolutely loves these! Mine are still O.K. the second day, but they've been devoured by the time the 3rd day rolls around.  Haven't had a problem with them getting hard.  Everyone else loves them, too!  They're not as course as most corn bread, but nice and moist!
The only cornbread recipe I'll use now!!!!

Tasty, tasty, tasty.  The only thing I added was a little sugar and to keep it from 
sticking to the bottom I rubbed the pan with butter than dusted some cornmeal
on the bottom making sure to discard the excess.  Yum Yum and no mess!!

My husband absolutely hates cornbread and I love it so I've never attempted to make it at home. I made chili and this cornbread and I saw from the corner of my eye that he snuck a little corner of my piece....I didn't say anything. Then he got up from the table and came back with a piece of it with a big grin on his face and quietly sat down like nothing happened. When he looked up he saw me staring at him and we both cracked up laughing because he swore he would never go near cornbread.....until now. I call this the miracle cornbread and it's a keeper.

when it comes to breads and cakes i usually flunk that part of the test however with this recipe i found it so easy i had to question myself several times if i was doing it correctly, for sure i thought it would come out like complete slop. However not only was it easy to follow it came out almost perfect.  Maybe it was me, but i just thought it needed to be a little sweeter. But other then that this is one of the best cornbreads yet.

I only had a cornbread once that I loved and have not been able to find anything close to it.  This is my first attempt (and last) at making it myself .  It was delicious and oh so good still warm.  I was a bit disappointed in it the next day as it had already lost a lot of its moistness even though I wrapped it tight.  But this a.m. grilled up a hunk in the frying pan with butter.  Mmmm!

Awesome cornbread!! Didn't know cornbread was so easy to make!!! Very moist and tasty, great with the Easy Chili recipe or even just butter!! It wasn't as sweet as the Boston Market cornbread, which I usually love but find too sweet...

Good, but not as moist as I had hoped.  It was somewhat dry, but maybe that's my oven.  I may try to make it again and take it out earlier.

I found this recipe very easy to work with and it yielded pretty good results. My husband nearly ate the whole thing at one sitting.

I did substitute however some of the all purpose flour with whole wheat and soy flour, 'cause I'm a bit of a "whole grain girl"; but all in all it was a great recipe.

Thanks

I think I made a mistake by cooking this in a loaf pan, which made the time to bake over double the recomended time, so be sure to use a shallower type of pan.

This is an excellent recipe for nice, sweet, moist cornbread.  It could use some improvement, but definitely a keeper basic recipe.  My husband thought it could use a bit more cornmeal.

Unbelievably moist!  My husband and I love it.  I won't use any other recipe.

Been searching for an excellent corn bread recipe and my search has ended.  I baked it in an iron skillet and it came out great.

I thought this moist, cake-like cornbread was good, my mother raved about it,
and said it was the best she's had in years...I liked how I was able to make it in
a jiffy.   I liked this recipe alright, but  am still partial to my grandma's corn-bread!

Was rather disappointed with this recipe.  Would have been a-lot easier to make Jiffy Corn Muffins from the box - and perhaps it would have tasted better too.  Or maybe, an error was made here.
Don't know but would not make again.

This was my first attempt at homemade corn bread and it was great.  I will admit to not
being a cornbread lover, but this was good. I made this for my parents and they really
enjoying it.  They put some honey on top and it looks great, really moist.  I will make
again! *****

This is our new favorite cornbread recipe.  It is just fine to make a big pan for my family of four as it goes away quickly.

This is very tasty, with a cakey texture.  Next time I'll cut the recipe in half, because it made two round cake pan sizes.
