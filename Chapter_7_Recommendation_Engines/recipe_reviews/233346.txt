I love this smoothie and thought the slight peppery bite from the cabbage was pleasant. I used a cup of cabbage because it was easier to measure. I did have to add more water and added a few more ice cubes to blend it to a consistency I like. I also used frozen black grapes. This recipe is very similar to the recipe in the Vitamix book my blender came with. I read somewhere that if you portion out and freeze cabbage it helps to 'temper' the bite so if you find the cabbage taste to be too much you may want to try freezing it. I picked a small young fresh green cabbage and maybe that helped.

I substituted cherries for the grapes.  The cabbage was quite noticeable, so next time I will cut down on that.  Great way to start the day!

My smoothie looked pretty much like the picture. All I have to say is yikes, the cabbage flavor was spicy strong. I followed the first reviewer's suggestions and cut the amount of cabbage by half. Glad I did that. I used all frozen fruit, so I had to add 1/2 cup additional water to get it budge. I made 1/2 smoothie and got 1 serving. I used red cabbage, which I have found uncooked does take on a strong flavor. I might have to try green cabbage in smoothies and see if that makes a difference. I was told by Vitamix consultant, that cabbage was one of the vegetables that is undetectable in a smoothie. Must have been referring to the green variety.

I thought this was pretty good. The peach and cabbage complement each other well.  Thank you!

I made the recipe for children to sample it at school!  I had quite good laugh listening to the kids' and staff comments.  Children had to guess the ingredients and the "intruder" which is usually a vegetable.  I couldn't help but laugh when a child ask me:  How do we write coleslaw!  Although it was good, it really tasted like coleslaw.  I did freeze the cabbage first as suggested by an other person.

I had about a 1/4 of a green cabbage that needed to be used, so I used that. I didn't have grapes so I substituted unsweetened OJ for those and the water. It wasn't awful lol.
