Wow, this was great! The selling point for me was the fact it had no sugar or artificial sweeteners in the ingredients. I used a fairly ripe banana and a combo of frozen raspberries, blueberries and blackberries instead of the strawberries and it still came out beautifully.  This recipe is def. going in my smoothie rotation.  Thanks for sharing!

Way too runny and and did not at all taste like strawberries! More like a banana milk kind of thing.

It came out really good!! Wasn't too sweet or too bland. I used one package or light and fight 100 calorie banana yogurt. I also used 1 cup of  frozen strawberries instead of half. I also used 1 cup of 1% milk and 1 package of truvia diet sugar. I didn't used almond milk or almonds, but it was still perfect for breakfast!
