Great alternative to the traditional yams and marshmallow recipe. I have a few suggestions though. First, take the other reviewers advice and boil the sweet potatoes first since the apples do finish much quicker. The sweet potatoes did take extra time to cook, longer than the stated time. 
Second, double up on the brown sugar and flour mixture. The casserole will be much sweeter and taste much better. Third, add more apples to the mixture. Otherwise, you hardly taste them. Furthermore, this is a great recipe and with the changes, I will be making this again!

DEFINITELY COOK THE SWEET POTATO **FIRST** BEFORE PLACING IT IN OVEN WITH APPLES. No matter how small you chop the potatoes, it ends up taking 3-4 times the amount of time specified without them being cooked beforehand. I also agree with a couple of reviewers who mentioned that the recipe for the sauce was too little. It may work well to make extra and add a little at a time. Otherwise, this tasted DELICIOUS!!!

Made this last Thanksgiving and just had a call requesting it again this year!  I found the sweet potatoes and apples I purchased were HUGE! - so I doubled the rest of the recipee and used 2 casserole dishes.  Before placing in oven I microwaved each dish 5 minutes then repeated another 5 minutes(alternating dishes).  This helped with the complaint I read a few reviewers had with the potatoes not cooking through - and I only needed to cook them in the oven for 20 minutes total after that. It was a HIT!

Before I found this recipe, several reviewers had already mentioned pre-cooking the sweet potatoes and increasing the sauce so that's what I did the first time I made it.  Excellent!

Great recipe!!! It has been a hit with my entire family and I've been making every Thanksgiving and Easter now for about 2 years.  Thanks Genny and AllRecipes.com.  The only change I've made to the recipe is that I slightly boil the cubed yams in water with cinnamon sticks first then layer it with the apples because I found that the apples cook much faster than the yams if the yams are not pre-cooked.  I also added slivered almonds on top...yummy!!!

Made this for big family Thanksgiving dinner. It was a big hit. Followed the advice to cook the yams first.  This is a must!  A little on the sweet side for my personal taste.  I ended up making it again the following day because there was none left over.

My family and I loved this recipe.  I found that the sweet potatoes needed extra time in the oven.  Next time I'll cook them first, then add the apples and sauce.  For a sweeter dish the sauce could easily be doubled.  My wife who doesn't like sweetened vegetables even raved!

I looooved this casserole - and so did the rest of my family!  The recipe was requested several times!  I cooked the sweet potatoes first in the microwave, then put them in the casserole with the apples, this way it baked in 20 minutes total.  Such a wonderful alternative to the typical marshmallow or nut topping casserole.

This was a big hit with my family. I definantly prefer it over the traditional marshmellow versions. I did take some advise here and microwaved the sweet potatoes before using and increased the glaze to 1 1/2 as much as the recipe.I also used dried cranberries instead of raisins. I soaked them in water for about 20 minutes before using. Turned out great and was done in the recommended cooking time.

Took quite a bit longer to bake than recipe indicated, but it's likely the yams I chose were larger than the recipe intended.  For that same reason, I ended up increasing the brown sugar/water/butter mixture part way through baking because it just looked to dry.  Regardless, it was very easy and got big raves at Christmas dinner.  A nice, less sweet alternative to the traditional "sweet" sweet potato recipes.

Delicious.  I served it for Thanksgiving and it was requested again for Christmas.  First time I cut the potatoes fairly thin and partially steamed.  Next time I cut in chunks and par boiled.  Prefer the latter.  I also added dried cherries instead of raisins.

As other reviewers suggested I cooked my sweet potatoes first.

This was a huge hit on Thanksgiving! The tangy apples compliment the nutty sweet potatoes.

A 2004 and 2005 Thanksgiving potluck hit with requests for recipes.  Definitely boil sweet potatoes and double the sauce recipe.  I used Golden Raisins this year, but did not double the amount, just because many people don't like raisins.  I'm interested in trying the craisins next time.  I used a fruit preservative to help keep the apples from browing as they are sliced and increased the amount of apple to almost 3 apples.  Also followed the recommendation to use 1 part flour, 2 parts water for the sauce thickener.  Thanks for the great recipe and suggestions!

I tried this recipe for my family last Thanksgiving Day.  It was such a hit that it will be on our menu for the holidays from now on! Very moist and delicious. More like a dessert than a vegetable dish!

Well I should have read the reviews.  I think you could avoid boiling potatoes if you: use three apples and two potatoes; chop it all fairly finely; add extra water (maybe 3/4 or 1 full cup); and leave the lid on the WHOLE time, so you get steam action going.  The potatoes on the top weren't soft enough, but the bottom was good, sweet and generally yummy.  After a night in the fridge it all tasted better, though, and more bits had softened.  Since it does taste good cold, it could be a good make-the-night-before dish and then the hardness wouldn't be much of an issue.

This is very yummy.  I sliced the potatoes like chips and cooked them in the microwave to make them soft first.  YOU HAVE TO DO THIS!  I have made this before w/out doing this step first and it is never ever done in less than 1 hour because of the sweet potatoes taking forever to cook.

This was good but I thought it tasted more like a dessert than a side dish.  It reminded me of apple crisp.  I made this at Christmas so to avoid having to put it in the oven with the turkey I cooked it in the microwave.  It took about 10 minutes on high power.  I also sliced the sweet potatoes instead of cubing them.

Really good. You MUST cook the yams first, and it's a good idea to double the sauce. A keeper.

Very good as is, the only thing that I added was after this had finished cooking and was cooling down, I dotted butter over the top and added crushed pecans.

This recipe was a total bomb at my Thanksgiving!  It needs more of the sauce, otherwise it tastes like apples and potatoes in a pan.  It sounds much better on paper.  Very boring and uneventful when made!

What an awesome combination.  Tastes fantastic.  Made this for a recent dinner party, and a guest who said "yuck, sweet potatoes" ended up having second helpings!  I did have to bake for closer to an hour, but to cut down on time this can easily be prepared in the microwave.  Just toss raisins, apple and yam slices with the flour and cinammon, mix water and brown sugar and pour over, and cook on high covered for 8-10 minutes or until tender.

This is very good, almost like dessert.  You  definately have to cook the yams before putting the apples in or you will have applesauce.  The lemons really top it off!

We loved this recipe! I did boil the potatoes for 25 minutes before adding to the other ingredients. I would NOT increase the brown sugar in this recipe - everyone felt that it was already sweet enough, possibly a little too sweet. That may be because I used Gala apples but I don't think it made that much of a difference. I loved the lemon flavor. Next time I will use more than 3 slices. Thank you for a recipe that everyone in my family loves!

This was excellent!  It tasted like a pie filling!  I left the skin on the apples and layered them on the bottom of the baking dish.  Then layered canned sliced sweet potatoes on top.  Then dumped a bunch of golden raisins on top.  Then I made the sauce and poured it on top without mixing it in and baked in that way.  I didn't use the lemon slices but instead put a touch of lemon juice into the sauce mix.  It was great... better than I thought it would be!

I made this for the first time to take to a potluck of mostly strangers, and everyone really liked it- several requests for the recipe. I baked mine at 375 for the last 20 minutes, and then went 10 mmore minutes uncovered at the end. I also did 50/50 raisins and "craisins"-I don't know if this is a side or a dessert (warm with a scoop of ice cream??), but it is perfect for either!

I made it exactly as indicated and the sweet potatoes did not cook all the way. If I had boiled them first, I think it would have turned out much better. The apples were good and the sauce was too.

Made this for Thanksgiving.

It was very, very dry and uncooked.

Ended up recooking it afterwards and adding some more traditional items to it such as marshmellows.

One major flaw for this recipe is the cook time.  I and two of my co-workers tried this recipe for Thanksgiving and were very displeased that it took THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT THAT IT SAYS!  I stuck this dish in with my Turkey, and it didn't finish until the Turkey was done, almost 3 hours later.  3 Hours!  Really!  I'd suggest to anyone using this recipe to use a heck of a lot more butter for the moisture, and cook it covered for more like 1 1/2 hours at 375.

this was an excellent recipe with one minor problem recipe calls for 1/2 cup water (8Tbs) of which 1/3 cup (5.3Tbs) are added with sugar leaving aproximately 3 Tbs for for combining with 3 Tbs flour to thicken = dosen't work. Needs a 1 to 2 proportion (example if you use 3Tbs flour need 6 Tbs water) other wise lumps result and cannot be sieved out.  A winner at Thanksgiving this year!

...although I didn't experience making it. I Introduced a friend to this website and he invited me over to try it. Mmmm good, and I really don't eat sweet potato's. It is a mix between a meal and dessert with the apples and cinnamon:)

Mom makes this with cranberries instead of raisins. Just cook 1/2 bag of cranberris with  cup of sugar and cup of water and boil on stove top until cranberries start popping. Looks very Christmasy

I am actually in the process of cooking it right now, but should have read reviews first. The potatoes are taking way long to cook. Instead of raisins also, I used dried cranberries. I tasted it after the 40min and besides the potatoes still being crunchy it tastes awesome. Next time though I will be cooking the potatoes a little before hand.

I adore this recipe.  However, I learned to cook the sweet potatoes/yams and apples first.  Then layered and made mix.  It's so yummy, it's almost like a dessert.  I've had raves and requests for this recipe every time I make it.    Have been making it quite a while, but first I dotted with butter, sprinkled with cinnamon and sprinkled brown sugar over each layer, with a bit of flour on top.  It comes out pretty much the same.

I made this recipe twice in two weeks after being given a bushel each of sweet potatoes (yellow & white) and apples. I tweaked the recipe with additions of cloves/ginger/nutmeg/Chinese 5 Spice/dried orange peel/and a dash of vanilla.  Family & friends couldn't decide if it was better as a side dish or a dessert!!  A definite keeper.

I made this recipe last Thanksgiving when I got stuck making yams.  The recipe was a hit!!  I have never had yams but had to try it since I made it.  Everyone including me loved them!!  Adults and kids.  I made it exactly as written with no problems.  People even asked where I got the recipe. Very easy recipe and tasted delicious.  I will definately be making them again.

A new Holiday Favorite!  The whole family loved them.  I did make some modifications to the recipe, made it gluten free and I cooked in a slow cooker, not backed.  I used and even mix of fresh yams and sweet potatoes (did not cook first).  I read multiple reviews and some people suggesting increasing the brown sugar mix, I do not suggest this, it was plenty sweet for us.  I used fresh cranberries instead of raisins.  Once the water and brown sugar were mixed, I added 3/4 - 1 cup of cranberries to the mix so that they had time to simmer with the mixture.  Instead of adding flour, I added cornstarch (use 1/2 the amount suggested for flour).  One of the good suggestions from another review was to add the apples later, the potatoes take longer to cook.  I left the potatoes and mixture in the cooker for about 2-1/2 hours on high, mixing/folding about ever 45 minutes to make sure all was cooking evenly. then added the apples and lemon. (which by the way, I did not peal the apples.  Our apples were small right now, so I added more than suggested). Using the slow cooker was nice because it did not take up additional, very precious, oven space.  I hope you and your family enjoy this as much as mine have.

I tried this recipe for this year's Thanksgiving and got a big thumbs up from the whole family.  Definitely a repeat performance dish. And... it's pretty!

The prep time was vastly longer than the recipe indicates (and I even scheduled extra time since this was my first attempt), and next time I use this recipe, I am going to pre-cook the sweet potatoes before I peel and cube. It took a whole lot of time to bake -- the until tender part -- about an hour and 20 minutes! Additionally, depending on the size of the apple -- you may only need one apple for the casserole if the apple is large.

It's undoubtedly my own fault this didn't turn out quite right for me. I sliced the sweet potatoes in about 1/4" rounds instead of dicing. The result is that it wasn't done when it should have been and took at least another 25 minutes to cook. However, the finished dish was fantastic in flavor and appearance. I will make this again.

We made it with tart apples from our old tree. I sort of estimated the measures because the recipe doesn’t say how much the potatoes or the apples weighed. But I think it is very adjustable.

This has become a holiday favorite and is requested every year.  I use craisins instead of raisins.  I also par boil the yams for 5-8 minutes.  Then cool and cube.  Reduces baking time which I find is longer than the time the recipe indicates.

I always love yams on Thanksgiving but my family never makes it, so I decided I’ll make it this year!  I saw almost everyone wrote to precook yams or they won’t cook in the amount of time on directions.  So I steamed them for about 30-45 min till they were soft.  I also saw a lot of people saying the sauce wasn’t enough so I doubled it and that there should be more apples so I added one more.  It came out ok.  Flavor good but I felt it had too much sauce.  Maybe 1 1/2 times the sauce would have been ok.  To me it tasted more like a dessert.  Like an apple pie without the crust.  Not sure if I’d make this version again tho it was pretty and different than normal Marshmallow yams.

This took far longer to cook than stated, however I did not pre cook the potatoes as others have. First I covered the dish with parchment paper and then foil(acidity in lemons will eat foil) then baked til almost soft(about an hour) removed the foil and continued to bake another 20 minutes as stated. It turned out pretty darn good. I would make this again

This was a hit at our family dinner!  I used canned yams and two Granny Smith apples and left off the lemons. Per recommendations here, I doubled the sauce but don't think I will next time.

As an alternative to making candy yams for thanksgiving, I made this dish.  It was delicious.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and made a second batch of sauce.  The next time that I make this dish, i will probably omit the raisins from the second batch.  As i have just learned, that my family is not that crazy about raisins but i couldn't tell as they gobbled it all up.

this recipe was so easy to make. I substituted dried cranberries for rasions. It came out with a funny platsic-y taste thought-If I made it again I'd be sure ti rinse the dried friut REally well! not likely to go on my thanksgiving table again.

I made this twice recently, once for a friend that just had triplets and another for my family.  My friend and her husband raved about it.  My childen even seemed pleased which is not easy to do with a new vegetable dish.  Thank you Genny for submitting this recipe!

This was my first attempt at cooking yams, therefore I searched the internet for a suitable recipe. This one caught my eye. The casserole was amazingly easy to make and with the helpful hints of previous reviews they were delicious. My boyfriend was skeptical at first, but he really enjoyed them. I will definitely make this dish again!!!!

This is probably the best yam recipie I have ever had! The apples add just the right flavor. It's not overly sweet but has just enough to keep my mouth watering for more. This will become a family holiday recipie for us!

Super Dish!  The combinations of taste and texture were very good.  An easy dish to create and a superb compliment to roast beef, pork or poultry.

I made this recipe for my first Thanksgiving diner.  It was such a easy and fast recipe and very easy to follow.  My family loved it and asked for the recipe.  It was a nice change from the usual sweet potatoe and marshmallow.

I loved this recipe.  Its not to sweet.  The apples add a unique flavor.  I made it at Thanksgiving and shared it with my sister to make for her X-mas dinner.  Even my daughter who hates sweet potatoes ate it.  Thanks Genny!

Tastes great,perfect for Thanksgiving!  And pretty too! However I had to modify the recipe a bit. It needed 5 sweet potatoes (mine were smallish) and extra brown sugar. The cooking time also didn't work for me.  Instead of 20 minutes for the sweet potatoes to cook, it took me more like an hour. Despite the tweaking, this recipe was a winner!
