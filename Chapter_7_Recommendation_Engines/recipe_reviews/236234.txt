This recipe was so good my hubby and I went and bought an entire lamb for the freezer. Can't wait to try it again. I did use basalmic vinegar instead as I had no car to run out and buy saba but I will look for it to have on hand for next time. Thanks Chef John AS USUAL!

I had never cooked lamb before, and thought this recipe sounded perfect for my first try. This is an awesome recipe, and the lamp turned out amazing! The meat was so tender it fell right off of the bone, and the flavor was absolutely delicious! 
**I couldn't find Saba at the grocery store, so I used Fini Modena reduction of Balsamic Vinegar with Porcini Mushrooms. FANTASTIC!!

Well that was delicious!  Used balsamic as I was too lazy to go find Saba!  Also used rotisserie chicken seasoning and water since I was out of chicken broth.  

This was probably one of the best things I've ever made.  So good.

Made this for our monthly cook club and it was a big big hit.  Even my buddy who said "I don't like lamb" loved it. When they showed up at the house the smell made him a believer. LOL. Also just a note I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out perfectly. Cooking it until it was really tender was the key. ;) 

Now, I just  need a couple more recipes to use up the other 2/3 of a bottle of Saba.  heh.

Thanks Chef John.  Keep those great recipes coming.

This was one of the best meals I made.  My family loved it. The saba made my whole house smell divine.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

Follewed recipe as is and it was great. However, needed to cook longer, probably because shanks were quite large. Will make again!

I've never reviewed a recipe before but just had to.  This was delicious and tasted like it had been made with the finest wine.  Meat literally fell off the bone.  Can't wait to make again!

Couldn't fine Saba not even at Total Wine store SO I used Balsamic. I didn't notice it at the end, but this was very good. Next time I'll try without vinegar to se if there is a difference

This was quite the gourmet dish. I pressure cooked a 3 lamb shanks, used a full body red wine instead of Saba. The flavor was out of this world. I will definitely make this again.

I made the recipe exactly as directed.  I even ordered a bottle of saba online and waited for it to arrive before making this dish.  The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender and I thought the sauce was very tasty.  My husband remarked that it was the best lamb he ever had.  Personally, I've decided that I just don't truly enjoy lamb.

I cooked the shanks an hour longer than the recipe called for, but they were still not done. I think next time I’ll make  them in a covered pot and take the top off the last 15-20 minutes. The taste was great. It’s a very good recipe. It’s just the cooking method that didn’t work fo me.

i followed the recipe pretty closely other than using balsamic vinegar vs. saba.  It was only OK for my family and me.    I really don't ever end up liking cinnamon in savory dishes, but this was so well reviewed and I wanted to stick with the recipe, so I kept the cinnamon in.

I didn't have saba or aged balsamic but I did have regular balsamic (Kirkland brand). I made a reduction out of that to use in place of the Saba and it turned out rreally good! I was worried there would be a vinegary taste since the house smelled like vinegar for the first 2 hours of cooking but there was no vinegar taste. I bet if I had used Saba or aged balsamic this would have been divine instead of just really good

We bought lamb shanks because they looked delicious and was something new.  When we got home, we realized that we had no idea how to cook them!  Followed this recipe and it worked out great!  We did substitute regular balsamic vinegar for the saba and was still delicious.  I can only imagine how good it could be with it!
