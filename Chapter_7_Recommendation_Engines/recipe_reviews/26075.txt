this recipe took preparation but was not too much to handle. the chicken i used turned out a bit dry and my friends were afraid of the amount of onions used and when served said 'why didnt you tell us you were making spanish rice?' -- but it was delicious. i was in love.

This was quick and easy to make and tasted very good.  The only change I would make is to add already cooked rice since I found it takes longer than the recommended time to cook the rice completely and you have to add extra liqiud to make sure the rice cooks and doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan.  Overall though a good recipe and I will make it again, my husband loved it!

This certainly has a kick to it!  My husband loves chicken and rice, so it's nice to find a new recipe to cycle in every once in a while.  It's easy and different from the usual routine.

I found I needed to cook the chicken and rice longer than it called for.  It wasn't quite done after browning it and then cooking for 25 minutes.

An easy chicken and rice casserole dish! The salsa adds great flavor to the rice and makes a nice one dish meal!

My family loves this recipe. Just a warning: If your family does not like things spicy "hot", use Mild Salsa.  Thanks
