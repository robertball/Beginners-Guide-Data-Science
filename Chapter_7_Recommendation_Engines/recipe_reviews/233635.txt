My mom (Iowa native) makes this.  It's one of my favorite mom dishes.  Like Areena noted, it's better if you put a little of the soup mixture and some cheese inside the tortilla, too.  Again, this is not intended to be real Mexican, hence the title. ;-)

I never rate a recipe without trying it first, but I'm making an exception because one of my friends makes a casserole exactly like this and it's delicious.  In fact, I found this recipe while searching by ingredients because I lost the recipe my friend gave me.  It's not gourmet by any stretch, and I usually avoid processed foods like canned soup, but this is good, easy comfort food for a crowd.  Just don't expect it to taste like Mexican enchiladas; different thing altogether.  The only thing my friend does differently is mixing in some of the sauce with the ground beef filling & adding a little cheese on the inside as well.  I add jalepenos, but that's my thing.  I think you'll like it if you try it.

This was darn tasty! Full disclosure, I'm a vegetarian so I used Gardein crumbles and cream of mushroom soup. Other than that, I didn't make any changes. Kids loved it!

These are really good.  I made one pan according to the recipe except with cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken and I made one pan gluten free with corn tortillas and spicy taco seasoning and double the green chilies.

I would recommend making 10 flour tortillas because that is how they come in a pack and then you would get more sauce/cheese on each one instead of squishing 12 roll ups in one pan.

Great alternative to tomato-based versions. My husband has horrible acid reflux, but loves Mexican. This did not bother his stomach a bit.  Satisfied the whole family. Served lettuce, tomato & other toppings on the side so everyone could build it their way.
