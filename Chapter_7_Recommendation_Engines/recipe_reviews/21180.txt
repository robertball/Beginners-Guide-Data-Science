Made this for Christmas morning.  I doubled it in a 9x13" pan because it looked so yummy.  I used regular raisins, added about 1 tsp Cinnamon, and used about 1/2 c whole milk in place of the rest of the nonfat evaporated milk (1 can=1 1/2 cups).  It was excellent.  I served it with a dollop of plain yogurt, which complemented the sweetness very nicely.  Very quick and easy.  What a wonderful way to start off Christmas Day!  Thank you for the recipe.

This was fair at best.  Rather bland.  Needs lots of extras to work.  Rum definetly would have helped some.

I enjoy this recipe. I just added rum extract and pecan to the recipe. and I made some salt pecan caramel to go on top. I will be making it again.
