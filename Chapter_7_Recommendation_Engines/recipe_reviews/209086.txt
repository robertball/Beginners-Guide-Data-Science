My husband absolutely loves this!  I use 2 cans of the big pillsbury cinnabon cinnamon rolls and 2 cans of apple pie filling.  Very yummy!

Made this for a small group of friends expecting to have some leftover.  The pan was empty in a matter of minutes!

this was really easy to put together and it wasn't too sweet.  Will definately make this again.
