This recipe really tastes just like chicken salad. The family liked it. I cooked the chicken in extra light olive oil and Morton's Nature Seasons. I didn't change anything about the recipe except the mushrooms. I mean 16oz has to be an error?? I used a 4 oz can of sliced mushrooms and that was plenty. I used wheat bread because that is what we had. It tastes like toast on top of hot chicken salad. I'll make it again.

I have made this recipe about a dozen times in the last 3 months.  It is 'one of life's simple pleasures'.  I've  used any precooked chicken, skin removed and de-boned as needed.  I use brown rice cooked with chicken broth.  I toast the almonds.  A smaller jar of mushrooms is okay.  I also add frozen peas or other froz veges to the mix.  Important.  DO NOT SUBSTITUTE the MAYO!  The consistency is perfect due to mayo instead of milk.  I find the measurements do not matter as much.  I've used more rice, less chicken  and it was just as good.  My man looks forward to this and to the leftovers.  He usually hates leftovers.

This was a very good chicken dish.  I made a few changes.  I added some pineapple tidbits, sliced grapes, and used fresh mushrooms.  Instead of using buttered bread for the top, I  just sprinkled some bread crumbs on (I was trying to save on calories).  This dish also tasted great the next day.  I would recommend toasting the almonds before adding them to the casserole - it gives them a great flavor.

It was easy to do and good, but it lacked that "bam!" I like.  Of course this was a last minute thing and I had to substitute ranch dressing for mayo, and green onions for celery and beef for chicken (okay, kidding about the chicken).  I'd recommend some zesty spices as an addition.

Since I don't like onion, I leave them out.  Otherwise, I love this recipe.  It's easy to make and tastes great!

This was good but not great.  I accidentally used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of chicken.  And I forgot the onions.  I don't think these changes made a big difference.  I added some garlic salt and some fresh tarragon (because I had some that needed using).  I had some sourdough bread that was getting old so I used it for the bread topping.  DH ate and declared he liked it but I doubt I'll make this again.

I had to use bread crumbs and chicken broth instead of rice and cream soup since that was all I had. I think I used too much celery, but other than that it turned out really good. I will make this again. Maybe if I follow the recipe exactly it will turn out even better.

tastes more like chicken noodle soup (probably because of the cream of chicken)...ok as a casserole, but not like the chicken salad I imagined. Mostly just tasted like hot mayo...

I made this recipe as is.  It was pretty good.  The veggies were crunchy like chicken salad.  Everyone really liked it, and it made a good amount for a large dinner.  Overall, I'd give it a thumbs up.

This tastes nothing like chicken salad to me, but it is good. It seems more like a variation on this site's Easy Chicken Casserole which has sour cream in it instead of mayonnaise.  All that said, I liked this variation. I was afraid the celery would still be crunchy and uncooked, but it was perfect. Next time, I would like to add more almonds for more crunch. The one thing I did differently this time was to use crushed crackers on top instead of the bread called for just as a personal preference.
