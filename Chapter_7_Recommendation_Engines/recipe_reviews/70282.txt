It's not often I'm this impressed when I try a new recipe.  I often rate the recipes I try highly, with five stars, but it's difficult to differentiate when something I try is even better than that. This one is.  I was tempted to used roasted red peppers for this, thinking the fresh red bell peppers wouldn’t provide enough flavor. Wrong.  I added some fresh minced garlic for complexity and depth but other than that I didn’t deviate from the recipe and, other than adding salt and pepper, won’t the next time I make this either.  Interestingly, it was equally as delicious without the sour cream as it was with it. I served this with “Simply Parmesan Chicken,” recipe also from this site, and linguine, but the possibilities for using this are endless.

I was pleasantly surprised by this sauce.  The only change I made was adding 3 cloves of garlic (I may add more next time).  Once the sauce was pureed, I poured it back into the pan and tossed in some cooked jumbo shrimp for two or three minutes and served it over rice with a side of steamed green beans.  This was a nice change from the usual cream sauces and not as heavy.

This was great! As recommended, I added 3 cloves of garlic and did not have sour cream so used dairy cream instead and it was wondeful! I served over white fish and it was a big hit at dinner last night.

Absolutely scrumpdillyishush! This tasted like a roasted red pepper sauce without the work of roasting and peeling. I will never roast them again. This was very tasty!

This sauce is absolutely incredible, and healthy too! I added a little garlic to the recipe, and used very low sodium chicken stock and light sour cream. I ended up placing the sauce on top of baked skinless boneless chicken breasts. The meal was perfect in every way, and looked so gourmet.

We didn't get why this was rated 5 stars so many times. Maybe I did something wrong? I used garlic instead of shallots but besides that we did everything according to the recipe. We don't have a blender so we used a mini food processor which made it pretty smooth. I think the main thing we didn't like was that it had little flavor. We put it over Orange Roughy. It needs something but I don't know what.

I made this with leeks and sauteed the veggies in some basil flavored olive oil.
Then I poured it over some grilled chicken.  My husband and I thought it was great.  Next time I'll try it with some fish!  Thanks!!

We really liked this-- we used it as a sauce on a chicken sandwich.  We tend to like spicy foods, so we added some cayenne pepper at the end to give it some bite.

Delicious!!!! I made this for friends, and they absolutely loved it.  I added three cloves of garlic, some oregano, a little extra sour cream, and a little half and half, and it turned out lovely. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

This has a mild yet delicious flavor.  Have made it several times and served it over ravioli.  I do add garlic, oregano, and used light sour cream as other reviewers mentioned.  Can't wait to try with chicken and shrimp.  To the reviewer who used garlic instead of shallots, you need the mellow flavor of the slow cooked shallots rather than just a teaspoon or two of garlic.

Made this to a "T" and it was pretty bland and tasteless.  Probably won't make it again.

YUM, YUM, YUM! This sauce exceeded my expectations.  I did add some garlic as others suggested and used all chicken broth and no wine (I didn't have any wine on hand).  I also used low fat sour cream.  The color of the sauce was beautiful.  I served this with Fried Green Tomatos sprinkled with a little bit of goat cheese.  The sauce complimented the tomatos perfectly!  Thanks for a great coulis recipe!

I could eat this with a spoon!  We had it over pork tenderloin medallions and it was wonderful.  I forgot to add the sour cream and it was never missed. It was so easy to make I wasn't sure it would as good as it is but I trust the opinion of several previous reviewers.  Thank you so much, Skapino!

Great quick sauce when you have some peppers you need to use up. I of course added some garlic (always), salt and pepper. Very good basic sauce to add to many things like chicken, white fish, or even some shrimp would be good.

Will update my review once I remake this.

I followed the recipe and had less sour cream than the recipe and included 1/2 cup of 2% milk (to make it creamy). I thought the recipe is just okay. When I remake this again, I think I will use a "sweeter" white wine instead of Chardonnay. The dish turned out thin (I probably should put more sour cream next time) and kind of sour (that's why I am thinking use sweeter wine next time). I also added salt, pepper, and paprika to taste. It was not amazing but it was palatable. Will tweak it next time and hopefully it gets better.

Yummy! I added a couple of drops of Tabasco and served over a grilled elk tenderloin with mushroom rice (the recipe from this site. I used a white basmati/quinoa blend).

So delicious! I added two cloves of garlic and used 1/2 cup of heavy whipping cream instead of sour cream. I paired it with parmesan crusted chicken. This recipe was delightful. I look forward to trying it with salmon and shrimp, also.

This was lovely. I did take the advice of others by adding about 3 cloves of minced garlic, some oregano, crushed red pepper, and a dollop more sour cream. It's a pleasant sauce I served it on pasta with chicken. The leftovers were even tasty. Would definitely make again.

Cooking just for myself, I used half of a red onion and half of red bell pepper. Unfortunately, I had no wine and doubled up on the chicken broth instead. Still came out delicious. Will definitely be making this again! :)

Wonderful flavor! served this with cod that I just pan sauteed in little olive oil salt and pepper and roasted asparagus.I didn't have shallots so I used quarter of a yellow onion and three garlic cloves. Super easy to make and healthy if you use low fat sour cream! Thanks for sharing Skapino!
