I did enjoy these. After the potatoes were done I cut them open and drizzled the remaining hot sauce that accumulated in the bottom of the foil, added a dollop of sour cream and sprinkled chopped cilantro on top. Thank you ggustin.

Mr. LTH really enjoyed this potato, but said it wouldn't be his "go to" choice.  I'm not nearly as much of a potato lover as he is and only had a bite or two to add my two cents to the rating.  It was good, but nothing remarkably different from a regular baked potato.  The recipe submitter is correct when he states these will NOT be HOT.  The Red Hot imparts flavor, w/out heat.  Thanks for the recipe, ggustin!  (Photo will be added when I'm able to upload to AR...)
