Very good.  Did make a few changes.  Used closer to 2# of ground beef, drained with the chopped onion. Didn't drain the corn or the beans.  Added a tiny can of diced chilies.  Also added about a cup of beef broth.  Brought all of that to a boil and then dumped the elbows in uncooked.  Let it simmer for 15 min or so and then added the cheese.  Mmmm.  I actually used the Mexican flavored Velveeta.  Gave it a nice kick but still creamy.  This way it is a one-pot meal!  We enjoyed this very much and will make again!

This was a quick and easy dish, just what I was looking for tonight.  I made one change: instead of salsa and Velveeta, I added 3/4 of a jar of 23oz Tostito's queso dip.  My 13 month old ate it up!

This dish was wonderful! I had all the neighborhood kids come over to ask for some! I omitted the corn (not a corn lover) and added more cheese. Then I garnished it with sour cream, cheese, guacamole & tomatoes. It's definately wonderful either way. I love it!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was wonderful.  I scaled it down to 3 servings and added 2 Tblsp taco seasoning mix only because we like spicy.  This is a keeper.  I used American cheese only because I didn't have the Velveeta and it was yummy.  Served it with a toss salad.

Enjoyed this one.   The only change I made was use grated cheddar and mozerlla chesse.   We do not like processed cheese.

This is a great recipe! It is one of the few recipes that my entire family will eat. I don't always keep Velveeta on hand, so I have used cream cheese and a bit of shredded cheddar in place. Still yummy, cheesy and creamy!

I don't think the name goulash quite fit this dish but it had a nice little kick to it from the salsa and it was a hit with the family. Made lots for leftovers.

Very good, almost a one-pot complete meal. Kid-friendly, too. I made this with gluten-free pasta. I used a prepackaged shredded Mexican cheese blend instead of the Velveeta, and threw in some diced seasoned canned tomatoes with the salsa just because I had some left over in the fridge. Next time I think I'll add some sliced black olives.

Loved this dish!  I found this tonite after realizing I had Salsa but no Spaghetti Sauce.  I followed it pretty much exact except substituted 1/4 can of tomatos with green chilis instead of corn.  It added just enough heat (if you want more heat you can add more tomatos).  I also used whole grain penne pasta.  Will make this again- Thanks Tonja!

My family loved this easy dish...I used 1lb of extra lean ground chicken instead of beef, added a can of diced green chilies, 1/2 pk of taco seasoning, a little extra cumin, corriander, and dried cilantro leaves. This is a great base dish, but did not seem like the salsa was going to cut it with flavor so I added some. Used egg noodles, corn and black beans. The cheese melts nicely and this a great one pot meal. Again my family realllly liked this one, and thanks!

I should have read the reviews first....it was very blah, if I make it again which is doubtful, I will use fresh jalepeno in the meat when browning, mexican veleeta for sure and a can of green chiles when I add the beans at the end!

Easy to put together and done in less than an hour so it's great for a weeknight meal too. I used onion powder 1 tsp. and a mix of Julio's mild salsa as well as a foil pouch of Taco Bell chunky salsa that was saved from a taco dinner kit. I didn't have any beans and used frozen corn. I added the dry macaroni right to the pan of beef and just added 2 cups of water, brought it to a boil and then turned the heat to med and let it simmer until the pasta was done and the sauce was to the consistency I liked. I loved this and would fix it again gladly, but my hubs wasn't so fond of it and would rather not have it again, although he said it was "Okay". Thanks Tonja, I have some left for my lunch tomorrow!

Great recipe! I added more hamburger, maybe an extra 1/4#. I also put in some beef base to beef it up a little. We didn't have pinto beans so I used kidneys instead. No salsa, so I put in two cans of Rotel. No elbows so I used large shell macaroni instead. It was very good and everyone gobbled it up and smacked their lips for more!

Made a few changes - we needed to double the recipe, and we used 1 can of corn, 1 can of diced tomatoes with chiles, and substituted a tall jar of queso instead of salsa and velveeta. There was a picky child eating with us, but next time I will add cumin, cayenne and chili powder. We did as others suggested and served with sour cream, avocado and tortilla chips.

I tripled this recipe since I was cooking for a big crew. We enjoyed this quick and simple recipe, but it was a bit on the dry side, so I added a can of Rotella and a little more salsa than that called for in the recipe. My wife thought it was delicious. I enjoyed it too. It's fool proof with plenty of room to tweak based on your own personal preferences.

This was okay but I would much prefer either goulash or nachos instead of a combo of both.  Will not make again.

1 year old and 3 year old loved it, teenager hated how it looked so next time we may try it with less salsa and cheddar cheese sauce instead of velveeta! Other than that it was super easy and there was plenty left over to freeze for a busy day!

I left out the corn and added Rotel tomatoes in place of part of the salsa and used queso for Velveeta since I didn't have any.  I added about 1/4 cup of pico de gallo  and it turned out great.

I left out the corn and beans. I can't eat either. I also used total instead of salsa. I've made this 
many  times for years and I Love it. Sometimes I'll make it with sausage and spaghetti. It makes a great main dish. Served with cornbread.

YUMMY!  I added a bit more velvetta - about 3/4 pound and used 3/4 cup chunky medium salsa and 3/4 original rotel - instead of 1 1/2 cups salsa.  I think it would be best with pound and a half of ground beef.  I also used around tbsp of taco seasoning mixed in.  It had quite a kick - I will definitely make again.

I really appreciate this simple recipe.   Made the recipe as written.  Then, due to personal taste preferences I added 1 small can diced green chilies, cumin, garlic powder, 2/3 cup chicken broth, and the whole jar of salsa (just a little bit left in the jar).  Since I did not have pinto beans I used black beans.  My husband, son, and I will use this recipe again.  Really enjoyed!

This was very tasty and a great alternative to plain old goulash that shows up fairly frequently in the rotation for us living on a fixed income.

This was a simple dish for a quick weeknight meal.  I normally like corn in Mexican dishes but didn't feel it fit in this.  Maybe it was all the cheese.  I also added taco seasoning to my meat for some extra spice.  Kids loved it.  Def keeping in rotation

Changed it up a little used taco seasoning for flavor, black beans instead of pinto, frozen corn and a can to diced tomatoes. Added one additional can of water and the pasta uncooked.....one pot wonder!

I forgot the beans but I did add green peppers. It was good, though my 6 yr old thought it was spicy. I'm not sure why. Next time I'll add sour cream to hers. It was really good.

This was pretty easy to make. I did make a few changes though. I used hominy instead of corn, seasoned the meat with garlic powder and cumin. I, unfortunately, can not handle anything spicy anymore, so the salsa alone made almost to spicy. The other suggestions with Rotel, or Mexican Velveeta would probably have been fantastic!!

This is a  very adaptable recipe.  I think the corn is important because of the texture it adds.  Also, make sure you use sufficient ingredients with spice/seasonings or it will be bland.  Someone recommended trying black olives.  The flavor was too pungent.  Happy Cooking!

This was pretty good! I added 6 frozen peeled, chopped tomatoes, 3 fresh chopped small jalapenos, added 3/4 lb shredded cheddar rather than velveeta, added chili powder, cumin, salt, pepper and garlic powder to the 1 1/2 lbs hamburger and 1 full chopped onion after it had browned. I wish I had used velveeta because it could have been cheesier...over all though my husband and I liked it and enjoyed cooking it together on a week night.  From start to finish it took about 35 minutes. I was going to make goulash (hamburger macaroni hot dish), but the Mexican version looked better. We added about 1 lb. (16 oz. bag) frozen corn, 1 pint of canned black beans because that's what we had instead of the pintos, and I will make it again. We made it with a curly longer macaroni called Cellentani (made by Barilla). I think it needed salt after it was done, but my husband says I like salt a bit too much. We had it with a dollop of sour cream on the top.  I think it would also be good with crunched up tortilla chips sprinkled over the top.

This is a fantastic nacho topper.  Layer chips, spoon on this stuff, another layer of chips,another layer of this stuff.  Lettuce, sour cream topped it off.  I tasted it before cooking the noodles.  I don't think I would like it w noodles.  Rice maybe.  I used 1 can undrained ranch style beans.  I would have liked to add half can of rotel but didn't feel like going to the store.  So for lunch- scratch goulash and bring on nacho supreme!

The best part about this recipe is how adaptable it is based on what you happen to have on hand.  I have found that the amounts listed in the recipe are really just suggestions -- add as much or as little of any of the ingredients (if at all) as you want.  I used 1 lb ground beef, 1 lb of Velveeta, and 1 lb of elbow macaroni.  I didn't have beans, so I used some of the Trader Joe's Cowboy Caviar in there, which added some spice and color. You can't screw this up!

Very good - I changed the elbow macaroni to small shells (only because we had Mac N Cheese the night before). Also added a packet of Taco Seasoning to meat mixture.  Added a dollop of sour cream and some extra salsa on top.

This was fantastic 'fresh' (I ate it for leftovers for lunch and it wasn't that great of a 'reheat' meal). 
I made this a 'one pan' meal, and used my 12" skillet/pan. Cooked the meat and drained then added in the corn (not drained) and pinto beans (not drained) also I added 3cups of chicken broth (didn't have any beef broth on hand) and then added in the noodles (uncooked). I let that all come to a boil and cook the noodles for a good 15 minutes. I love when I can just use one pan for dinner and not have so much to clean up afterwards!!! My husband LOVED this and said it needs to be a monthly dinner! I served with fresh tomatoes on top as well as sour cream.

Two of my three LOVED this, my third didn't like it at all.  I thought it was awesome as well as my parents (we had them over for dinner).  Overall, it was a hit except for one strange child that didn't like it for some reason.  

I love spicy food, but I'm the ONLY one if my family :(  I think this a great way to introduce kids to spicy food. I had a pretty mild salsa, but it did have a little zip to it.  My oldest said, this is spicy, but kept eating it because it was so good.  My youngest didn't say a thing, just ate it.  Will definitely make again, will use a different brand of salsa for my picky eater.

Very good. My husband liked it, and he does not usually like things "mixed" together.  I did replace the can of corn with a can of hominy.  I thought we would like the taste of it more than the sweetness of the corn. It does make a HUGE amount. Great for leftovers or a family,

Used most of the ingredients listed but also added a can of green chile sauce and some taco seasoning and Cilantro mixed in with the meat concoction.  Used Cheddar and Mozzarella along with some sour cream.  VERY easy and fast.  We enjoyed it.  Great meal if you're on a very strict budget.

Quick and Easy.  We doubled the recipe (We have three kids), but we probably should not have done that.  This made an enormous amount!  I also like things spicy, so after I cooked this I added some Frank's Hot Sauce to it and it was delicious.  I pretty much stayed true to the recipe and it worked out well.  I did have to add about a cup of water halfway through the cook time, but that could have been due to the doubling of the recipe.  Will make again.  Thanks for a quick and easy recipe that my kids will eat.

Love it! Made a couple of times, really easy, and really yummy! I use shredded cheddar since I typically dont have Velveeta in the fridge.
