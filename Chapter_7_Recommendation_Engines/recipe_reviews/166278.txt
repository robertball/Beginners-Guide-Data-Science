I thought this recipe was delicious! Just the right amount of tangy and spicy. The only thing I changed was that I used about 1/4 cup of pickled jalepenos instead of fresh. I also used chicken breasts that were quite large and cut along the length into cutlets so they were quite thin. I marinaded for about 3 hours and they had lots of flavor. It was still spicy enough for my family, who enjoys spicy food. I also doubled the marinade and boiled the leftovers down to use as a sauce over the chicken. Served it with brown short-grain rice and steamed veggies. Yummmy! Can't wait to make it again

I like this recipe, 2nd time I have used it.  This time I added the fresh lime zest from the limes before I juiced them.  This is delicious on the grill.  Very healthy meal!

I only made slight changes to the recipe, using more minced garlic and pickled jalapenos instead of fresh, and fresh squeezed orange and lime juices.  I marinated the chicken for ~8 hours.  I used my indoor electric grill (not like a George Foreman grill), and did not have enough room to cook all the chicken so broiled the others.  I liked the grilled chicken better and basted it as it cooked, making sure it did not dry out.  Served with a tossed green salad, delicious!

Wow! This was beyond great. I marinated the chicken overnight and used thighs as I find they are juicier. It had the right amount of heat. I also made a sauce from the leftover marinade and added cream (half and half). It finished off the dish perfectly.

This chicken is good. You have to make sure the chicken is browned on both sides or you are going to have the bland flavor. Also, I added adobo and garlic powder to it. These ingredients enhanced the flavor.

Was not impressed with recipe, marinated chicken for 6 hours and it was missing something. A good base to add to. Thanks for the recipe.

I marinated my chicken for two days due to something coming up and I have to say it was very flavorful. My only issue was the chicken was so dry. I have never really used my broiler before so wasn't sure on the time so followed the time listed and it was way to much for what we had. Next will cook less time and keep a better eye on it!

This is great as fajitas. Grill the chicken, with peppers and onions, serve with guacamole, sour cream and cheese. Great dish, served on tortillas.

I liked this, but it didn't have as much jalapeno flavor as I would have liked. I was only able to marinate for 2.5 hours, as I got home from work late (lousy Chicago traffic!) I'll make this again, but let it sit much longer, and perhaps add more than two jalapenos. Thanks for the recipe, Suzanne.

Very good, used four jalapenos and kept the seeds still not that hot, but had some heat.  Left in fridge for two hours (short on time) and grilled on skillet. Was very juicy and tender will use this again.

I didn't have fresh jalapenos, so I substituted them for about a quarter cup of marinated ones and I also used skinless chicken breast halves bone in. I marinated the chicken in a ziploc bag for 24 hours and I still found that the flavour was not pronounced. Too bad. The small pieces that tasted were delicioud though. Not sure how to make the flavour more pronounced... maybe the real jalapenos would have made a difference.

Two stars because this lacked heat, and I used 6 jalapenos.  I used this on  chicken and the taste was interesting, but is nowhere near complex. There are  several lime/orange juice sauces/ marinades on this site.  Strongly suggest you try one of them.
