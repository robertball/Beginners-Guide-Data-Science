This recipe is a great starting point for those who want to get creative. Loved the garlic and the lemon zest, they added a great little bite. We found it a little lacking on the cheese flavor so we added 1/2 cup smokey sharp cheddar cheese and also tossed in about 1/8 cup bacon bits. Overall this was a good recipe and I will be making this again!

This turned out so cute and festive! I could see adding some tiny diced red & yellow pepper pieces as "ornaments" on the tree as well!

This is a festive presentation. I do think it needs some extra sharp cheddar cheese, worcestershire, & bacon pieces for more flavor. I added the cut up red bell pepper for more presentation. I used dried basil in the cheese and only fresh parsley on the outside. I will make it again but adding the cheddar.

I used this and modified based on the ingredients I found at the store last minute.  
I used Philadelphia  cream cheese and mixed in a shredded asiago, parmesan and Romano blend (could not find havarti), and this was yummy!   I added chopped chives  to the  fresh parsley.  I used both minced garlic and garlic powder.  I shaped the trees and then added basil pesto to the outside (the store was out of fresh basil!) then layered on more fresh parsley and chives.  Finished the the little cranberry “ornaments”..

I brought this to my office Christmas Potluck, and it was the hit of the buffet.  Not only does it look perfect on a Christmas Buffet table, but the flavor combination is also wonderful.  I would go a little heavier on the lemon zest than what the recipe calls for.

Beautiful idea. Good flavor, going to try dressing it up a little next time. Be sure to allow time to soften for service.

Delicious, festive and really versatile.  I left out the lemon zest and added a little bit of prepared pesto--everyone loved it at the party and it attracted a lot of attention!

Fun recipe! My friends were very impressed. I added 2 tsp. of worcestershire for extra flavor & decorated my tweet with bacon lardons. The video was super helpful for making my tree. Will make again!
