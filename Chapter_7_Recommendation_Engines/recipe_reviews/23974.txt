yummy LOW FAT sub: white sauce with 1% milk.  Heat 2 Tbsp butter, 2 Tbsp of flour and stir on  low heat.  Add 1 c of milk slowly.  It's creamy enough.  We also added shrimp at the end and it was very tasty.

This is one of my favourite recipes to make, but I've made some changes to suit my tastes.
Instead of sweet sausage (which works great) I used hot italian sausage. The pasta I chose was fresh fettucini. A couple shakes of red pepper flakes made it just spicy enough to avoid ruining the other flavors. I also added some fresh ripped basil in right near the end to brighten up the peas a bit.
Try it out!
Hey, I see njmom thinks like I do! Amen on that basil at the end.

Very good when followed exactly. Delicious and creamy. To make it more alfredo-like, add the Parmesan cheese to cream sauce before pouring over pasta. Either way, it's delicious!

Yum.  Didn't have cream, so I made a roux  using 2 Tbs. fat from mild Italian sausage and 2 Tbs. flour then used milk.  It was perfect! And very "creamy".

This was so good! I did as someone else suggested and after the sausage and peas were ready, added a bit of flour and then milk to thicken it up and cut the fat. I did add some heavy cream a bit later, but only maybe 1/2 cup. My whole family really enjoyed this meal, including a husband, brother-in-law and 3 and 1 year old boys.

This dish was neither complex nor difficult but that doesn’t mean it wasn’t incredibly delicious and satisfying.  I deviated from the recipe somewhat, deglazing the pan with a good glug of white wine,  then reducing it almost completely before adding the cream.  Also, the peas needn’t be cooked for five minutes – tossing them in just before serving is all they need.  The pasta does absorb a lot of the sauce, but rather than adding more cream I simply added some reserved pasta cooking water.  “Super Easy Spinach and Red Pepper Salad” completed the meal.  Our bellies were pleased.

Fast, Easy and Delisious! I made this in a pinch! I always have Italian Sausage in the Freezer and I always have Pasta on hand for those nights when I don't feel like "cooking". I was looking for something different to do with pasta and sausage and I found this, a nice white sauce. We use spicy sausage, we love the kick! Everyone, especially my husband, loved it. I love it especially because in 20 minutes, I have a complete meal. Add bread w/ butter and a salad if you like.

I made this for my family last night and it was a huge hit! I used 1 cup of heavy cream & 1/2 cup of half & half. I also used previous suggestions and added ground pepper and fresh basil at the end. Definitely a keeper!

Very easy, very simple, and VERY tasty!  I cut the recipe in half for just myself (with some leftovers for lunches) and added several heavy shakes of Penzey's Aleppo pepper for a bit of "bite".  You could use half hot Italian sausage with half sweet Italian sausage for the same effect.

I didn't find this recipe to be creamy and I used heavy cream.  It was too watery for my taste.

I don't know, but I think people are afraid peas. I made this for the staff at the school where I am the cook. I thought this was very good, but the staff didn't seem to like it very much. I'm faulting the peas. I like peas. My family liked this so I would try this with your family. That's why I'm giving it 5 stars. We aren't afraid of peas. LOL

Not bad. While I prefer my recipe for bow ties with sausage, tomatoes and cream just a *tiny* bit more, this was a nice change of pace nonetheless. Because my hubs has a bad head cold (and because his tastebuds are dead lol), I wanted to stray away from heavily spiced foods. If I were to make this again, I'd have make a few changes to better suit our tastes (I know my hubs would think this is too bland otherwise...). A good dose of basil or Italian seasoning would add much needed (and lacking)"oomph." Alternatively, a spicy sausage or a combination of sweet / spicy sausage would also do the trick. NOTE: Add the required Parm cheese to your CREAM and whisk to incorporate it. If you are looking for an alfredo-like sauce, this is a MUST (even tho you'd need a LOT more of it to resemble true alfredo, adding the Parm DID add SOME flavor). Be sure to garnish your pasta with cheese as directed, but definitely add some to your sauce as well. Served with garlic breadsticks, this was a decent, no fuss meal. Thanks for sharing, Elaina. :-)

Add some sherry to this (to taste) and it puts it over the top! Also added some red pepper flakes and about 10 X the garlic. Good enough for company! Also added quite a bit more of Parma cheese. I added it right into the sauce.

This is really good and something different for pasta.  I use frozen Brown 'N Serve links (6 links+3 tbsp water = 1/2 lb) and rainbow rotini pasta.  Don't forget to add salt!

This is a delicious recipe! And so easy!! I see many people have used different pasta shapes than rigatoni and thats quite fine.  However, with this type of sauce (thick and chunky) you really want to avoid the thin noodle type pastas (like spaghetti or fettucini) as these pasta shapes are typically used with much thinner or just creamy sauces like your basic tomato or alfredo sauce.   The chunky sauces like this one is work MUCH better with larger shaped pasta that have holes or nooks and crannies in them to "trap" the chunky sauce in.  Perfect examples are fusilli, cavatelli, penne, bow ties, shells, rotini, or even elbow macaroni.  Point is, the sauce gets trapped in these large holes so you get a taste of all the ingredients in every bite.  If you use spaghetti or fettucini noodles, the cunky sauce just slides right off the pasta and you're left with a big pile of sauce at the end that you have to eat with no pasta.  Hope this helps everyone out in finding the perfect pasta shape for your meal!  Have fun with it!

Very nice basic recipe. I made some changes based on what I had and my likes. I used 1 lb HOT Turkey sausage, Fat Free Half and Half as that is what I had, added 1 medium onion chopped and added 1/4C grated cheese into the sauce.  I will definitely make this again as it was quick, easy and very tasty for what was literally a 15 minute meal.

Used 1 tbl minced garlic and instead of heavy cream used a white sauce (2 cups milk, 4 tbl butter, 4 tbl flour), and added 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, and 1/2 cup parmesan cheese to the sauce.

Took advice to make a bit healthier. Made a roux out of skim milk and left off the parmesan. Great easy dinner.

Had some sweet Italian sausage and wanted to try something different.  I didn't have any heavy cream so I used 1.5 cups of milk and 2 tablespoons of flour...sauce was creamy and thick.  My 5 year old ate all of her food and said it was very good.  Would have given it 5 stars if she would have asked for seconds.  Needed a bit more seasoning IMO.  Will make again.

We enjoyed it but I agree with others - this is not "Creamy" at all and I did not change a thing to this recipe.  My sauce turned out very thin.  I was disappointed - I thought this would turn out like an alfredo sauce - but it didn't.

I was looking for something with Italian sausage and no tomatoes and this fit the bill perfectly.  It's easy to make and tastes great.  I did make my sauce with some half & half and skim milk, and per other reviewers, did add some parmesan to the sauce.  We both really liked the taste and it's a "make again".

I just tried to lighten up this recipe a bit, so I used half-n-half thickened with a little cornstarch, and also added in some sliced baby bella mushrooms.  It would also be good with hot Italian sausage for a little kick!

Well my husband and I really loved this dish. I made it as described except for the clove of garlic (didn't have any). Can't convince the little one to enjoy the peas yet, but I gave it 5 stars because the adults will definitely eat it again lol.

This was really good, it didn't look that great, but very tasty.  I did drain some of the olive oil and sausage grease out before I added the cream...but very tasty.

Absolutely delicious!  The only change I made was to use linguine instead of rigatoni.  If you are true to the recipe and use heavy cream, the trick to a thicker sauce is to increase the heat until it boils then turn it back down and let it simmer for about 5 minutes or until desired thickness

Excellent.  I lowered the fat as others suggested by making a roux of cornstarch and sausage drippings, supplemented by a little Smart Balance, and then added 1 C. lowfat milk.  My kids devoured it.  I would have preferred it a bit spicier, but they wouldn't have eaten it that way.  I will make this again.

This recipe has become a staple in our house! I use chicken sausage since that's the only sausage I can find that is all natural. I also use half and half instead of cream. Such a great recipe!

My son has requested this for his bday dinner for the past  20 years.  This year , however, I made it "lighter".  I used turkey sausage and nonfat 1/2 1/2. I did need to add some cornstarch to thicken it.  I also always use ditalini pasta and always have . Delish!!

I made this a while back but forgot to review it. I thought it was really pretty good. However, I didn't even make the whole package of pasta, and I felt like it needed more sauce. I added some milk and that helped. Good recipe, thanks!

I bought the wrong kind of sausage, but it still worked. When I sauteed the garlic, I threw in onion, red bell pepper & mushrooms. I also added quite a bit of black pepper. Thanks for the recipe, it was good!

I used link sausage instead of ground. And I used fresh snow pea pods instead of frozen peas. I also added a little extra garlic and a sprinkle of crushed red pepper. I would recommend using a little more heavy cream. Very good. Thank you.

Hubby was late coming home for dinner, so the kids and I ate first.  When he finally did get home, he scooped some of this on his plate, and one of my boys said, "That's not enough."  My husband took another scoop, and the boy said, "You're gonna want more."  Hubby later said he would eat a trough full of this pasta.  VERY, VERY, VERY GOOD!

Excellent recipe. Used hot italian sausage and some red pepper flakes. Added another 1/2 cup of cream because we like things creamier - half & half works too.

I substituted the Italian sausage with Garcia's beef sausage and added basil & fresh ground Pepper. This dish was an Enormous hit! At home and at the office.
In fact, after my co-worker's finished theirs, another co-worker came in, smelled the aroma and I got in trouble for not bringing some for that co-worker. Definately a keeper!

This was a great, quick dinner. I'm rating it a four because the cream sauce would have been too thin without my adding flour to make a roux. So I added the butter, about 1.5 tbsp flour, blended, and then slowly added the cream, then simmered until thick. I also added chopped onion in with the sausage (used smoked beef sausage), and added basil and red pepper flakes, as other reviewers suggested. It was quick, easy, and very tasty!

Nice comfort meal.  Nothing fancy, just warm and cozy.  Comes together quickly for a fast meal after church or a busy weeknight.  Have made this a few times.  This time I used diced up kielbasa for the sausage and melted the cheese in with the sauce, with extra cheese to grate on the top for any who desired.

Good and super easy!  Followed some of the other reviewers' comments and switched the heavy cream with 1.5 cups of milk and 2 tablespoons of flour to make it a little more healthy and it turned out great!! Nice and creamy and pretty thick too, also added basil and pepper to the sausage and peas as they were simmering for some extra flavor.

This recipe is a very basic, but great dish that can be thrown together very quickly. I have had this recipe as is, but my preference is with just a little more flavor so I add some Emeril Original essence seasoning and use chicken sausage. There are so many variations to this recipe. It's a keeper.

Excellent...made just as stated.  Once you put the sauce over the pasta, it soaks right in and gives a wonderful flavor.  I do not even like peas but I liked this.  We used petite peas.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent recipe but I made a few changes. For pasta, I used a tri-color pasta. I mixed mild and spicy italian sausage and added sun-dried tomatoes. It was one of the best I've had in a while.

I love this recipe!   It was delicious and enjoyed by my husb. and 3 yo daughter.  I modified it to cut back fat/calories as follows: swapped sweet Italian turkey sausage for the reg. sausage; used half & half (maybe 3/4 cup) instead of heavy cream, I did use butter, but only 3 tblsp, and used some of the reserve from the pasta water (about 3/4 cup) to make up for the rest of the cream.  I also added the parmesan to the entire mix while it was still cooking (toward the end) to thicken the mixture. Oh, and while the sausage browned, I added minced onion (dry) and a couple small shakes of crushed red pepper, dried basil and oregano, and a little garlic salt to taste. Even with the turkey sausage it was very delicious.  Thanks!

Great recipe! I used turkey sausage and added a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes. I also used a mixture of heavy cream and skim milk, the sauce still thickened up nicely. Quick, simple, and delicious! I will definitely make this again!

This was delicious!!! I am going to try and make the low fat version. We like a lot of meat in this house, so I added extra sausage and extra peas (yum). I also added a little extra heavy cream and a couple tbls of flour. LOVE IT!!! Thanks :)

Everyone loved this recipe, even my very picky Irishman, lol!  Beautiful recipe!  The only change i made was to stir in 1/4-cup flour to the sausage and peas before adding the whole milk (substituted for cream as i did not have cream...gorgeous!)...this made a lovely sauce that was just perfect...will definitely be a family favorite from now on ;)

The sauce was a little runny at first, but once it sat for about 5 minutes, it turned out perfectly! It's a bit high-calorie for me, but well worth it. I'll try suggestions for a lower-cal/lower-fat version next time. A fantastic treat!

I changed this recipe up quite a bit and it was good.  I like the combination of peas with sausage.  You can use whatever pasta is in your cupboard.

My wife and I enjoyed this dish very much.    I added some diced onion in with the sausage while browning.  I did not use heavy cream.  I chose the 2 Tbs Smart Balance, 2 Tbs flour an one cup milk route.  I did this in a separate pan and brought it to a boil while whisking to thicken.  It was thick enough for us.  I did not use all 12 oz of the peas.  That's a lot.  Also, we felt the rigatoni was too large a pasta for this dish, and one pound is way too much.  I'll use penne or fusilli the next time.  Because there will definitely be a next time.  mmmm.

I thought I was on my own for dinner and planned to eat cookies, but my brother came over again so I whipped this one up. Turned out good - we're full and happy. I didn't find this bland at all like some reviewers did. It must depend on the sausage used. It bordered on to rich for me, but good. I did add lots of cracked pepper, cuz I love it. Thanks!

My family enjoyed this. A few modifications: I used bowtie pasta and what was left of a pint of 1/2 & 1/2 in lieu of the heavy cream, also used twice as much parmesan, plus a pinch of salt. Will likely make this again.

I wasn't overly impressed with this as is. The sausage tasted a little odd to me with the other ingredients. I will probably make again but omit the sausage all together and just have pasta and peas.

This was pretty good for a quick weekday meal. However, if I make it again I will take the advice of other reviewers and use spicy sausage or add basil. I made the recipe as written and found it a bit bland.

I didn't have any heavy cream so i used half and half. I also added a little water with some beef boullion in order to increase the liquid. This turned out very well and was very flavourful. Its simple but delicious!!

Nice to have a white cream sauce for a change then always having spagetti sauce!  
This dish is wonderful!!  We actually added a mix of vegetables instead of just peas.
Very good for the kids!  I will be sure to cook it for a family gathering.  Everyone 
will love this.

This had very few ingredients but tasted great! I did season my sausage while browning and again when sauce was almost done.. otherwise it would've been bland. Next time I will try adding shrimp as another mentioned!

This dish is so flavorful, but I wish the sauce was thicker.  Next time I make this I will make the sauce thicker in a separate pan and add it to the meat after it thickens.

Five stars with a few personal modifications to lower the fat content a bit and add more flavor.  I still used 1lb bulk pork Italian sausage, next time I may try italian turkey sausage.  After browning the sausage and draining the fat I added 2 tablespoonsful flour before adding 1&1/2 cups fat free half &half, along with the peas.   This allowed the sauce to have a slightly thicker consistancy. I also added 1/2 t Tony Cachere's creole season, 1 t fresh cracked pepper and salt.  Skipped the addition of butter, didnt feel it was necessary and it wasnt missed.  Finally I added the parmesean to the sauce as well as a little more on top.  Delicious and will defiantely make again.  Nice and easy recipe for a week night or nice enough for gatherings and holidays since so easy to double.

Delicious! Following the recipe exactly except I'm adding the parmesan in with the cream because it makes it nice and cheesy like alfredo.  Thanks for that tip!  This is quite the fattening dish so I'll only be making occassionally.  It is wonderful though, try it out!

Bf loved it! I was concerned that the sauce looked a little thin, but I'm not a meat-eater, and he thought it was great.

I made this yesterday and it was very yummy and simple!! My husband loved it.  A couple changes I made was I used ground mild italian sausage, I also used 2 cups of heavy cream instead of 1 1/2 cups.  1 tbl of olive oil instead of 2.  This is something I will for sure make again.  Thanks for sharing!

For being such a quick and easy meal to make, this was fantastic!  I followed the recipe except I probably used fewer peas than it called for.  I would probably still make a few changes now that I've made it.  I think instead of cooking the garlic in oil I will cook it in the sausage grease after the sausage has started.  I had to drain my sausage before adding the cream last time and I still might have to this way, but I'll give it a try.  Also, I'll cook the entire package of sausage-which is about 1 1/4 lbs.  My husband ate some of the leftovers today and he said it tasted even better than the night before.  I just really enjoyed how tasty this was and how quick it was to make!

The cream makes it way too heavy.  I substituted 2 cups chicken broth.  Much lighter and flavorful.

Hubby thought it was a good starter; I thought it was really tasty.  Didn't have any cream so made it with 1c 2% milk and 1/2c half and half, thickened with a little cornstarch, and it was perfectly creamy.  Also added some grated Romano cheese to the sauce, which was added a nice flavor.

One of our family's favorites!  I have made this numerous times and there are only a few minor modifications I made (mainly to save on calories/fat): Use 2 Tbs of butter rather than 4 and use light cream in place of the heavy cream.  I also thicken the sauce with flour near the end of cooking to make it creamier.  I use sweet italian sausage although hubby and I would prefer hot but too spicy for kids.  We add red pepper flakes to ours to give it a little spice...delicious!!

This is a favorite in our house.  I have made some small changes and use half and half with a little corn starch and I also use sugar snap peas and broccoli and I also use turkey sausage to make it a little healthier.  My kids always eat this up so it is a regular here in our house for dinner.  Thanks for sharing.

I had 3 servings!!!   I had to use elbow pasta since that's all I had, and I added extra Parmesan cheese in addition to red pepper flakes for a kick.  This was sooo easy to make.  All my sauce got sucked up by the pasta, so do not expect this to be a saucy dish.  Mine was NOT dry though.  The Italian sausage adds a lot of flavor too.  Great way to use up those frozen peas sitting in the fridge.

This was very good. To cut back on fat, I used 1 cup of 1% milk and 1/2 cup of half n half thickened with 2tlb flour. I only used 2 tlb butter. I used 1/4 cup of Parmesan Cheese. I also added a Pint of Grape Tomatoes sliced in half. Cooked till tomatoes softened. Quick weeknight meal. I will make this again.

This was pretty good, although I did lighten it up a little bit.  I subbed ff 1/2 and 1/2 for the heavy cream and I diced turkey sausage instead of the pork sausage.  (Caution, using this method produces a very thin, but still tasty, sauce)  I also topped with some fresh basil.  My dd couldn't stop complimenting me on a fantastic meal.  Thanks for sharing!

A delicious way to sneak in peas for the finicky ones!  I am only 1/3 of my family that will eat them, and yet not a complaint heard!  In fact, I got rave reviews.  Thank you for this recipe.

This turned out really well and everyone loved this! Only change I made was I added more parmesan and a bit more cream to make more sauce. I first started adding the extra cheese and it started to get dry so thats why the extra cream was needed. This really was delicious, and quick too. Thanks (:

We loved this!. I used mild italian sausages and added some red pepper flakes. I also used regular and fat free half and half instead of cream. After about 5 minutes I added 1T of parm to the sauce to help thicken it. It does take a little time to thicken but mine was perfect. Added more parm at the end. Delicious!

This was FANTASTIC! I made just as the recipe said to, but the sauce was very watery so I added about 1/2-3/4 cup grated parmesan to thicken it up a bit. It was a hit with my family. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very easy to make..and tastes really good also! I substituted pasta shells for the rigatoni..and found there was way more than 4 servings! But it still tastes good re-heated. Thank you for this recipe! I will be making this again.

Wanted to try something with noodles that wasn't red sauce and had some italian sausage- so, here we are! I did leave out the peas (family preference) and used 1% milk instead of heavy cream. I also added some flour towards the end to thicken it up. Whole family liked it- would make again.

This was amazing!!  Added a bunch of extra cheese while it was still on the stove and it formed a "sauce" that was comparable to alfredo.  So quick & easy to make.

This was very tasty even though the sauce was a little thin,  I expected the sauce to be a tad thin so I used rigatoni pasta.  The pasta made the combonation a success!  I will definately make it again but may try adding a few different spices to add just a bit more flavor!

This was a definite hit at our house!  I only made one modification.  I made it thicker by mixing flour and milk,,It was great!  Next time, I think I will substitute the sausage with prociutto..(I know that is spelled wrong..sorry!).  But a great sauce..thanks!

I picked this recipe to use up some extra sausage. Little did I know my kids would start REQUESTING it! The sauce is thin, but nobody was expecting otherwise. The creaminess adds a rich flavor but leaves the ingredients "uncoated". (which is better for the one lactose intolerant family member)

This was delicious, I used a rue to thicken it, since I didn't have heavy cream on hand.  Thank you to the other ladies who suggested.

Used sweet turkey sausage to cut calories. Also to cut fat, used low fat evaporated milk and 2 tbsp of butter. Would have followed recipe as written but had to try to cut calories and fat as possible. Still, very tasty. Took my leftovers t lunch and coworkers commented each time how good it looked and smelled.

I've made this recipe a few times and while it's good, I find the sauce to be too  thin as written and needs a little something else flavor wise. In changing things up, I've made a cauliflower alfredo sauce to go with this recipe as well as a homemade gluten and lactose free alfredo that we enjoyed much better with this recipe (mixed some of the alfredo in with the pasta and topped bowls with additional sauce if desired). Overall, this is a good recipe that's quick, easy to make, and easy to adjust to your liking. Thanks for the recipe!

Well, not sure if we’ll make this one again. We might go for it with the addition of pure vanilla extract and several heaping spoonfuls of our secret Italian spice mixture (pepper flakes, chili powder, cumin, basil, thyme, rosemary, and a dash of nutmeg). The vanilla really brings a dessert-like quality to any pasta dish! And please do use FRESH peas if you are considering this dish. We threw our ice box out years ago!

Great recipe. I didn't use the exact measurements, and still turned out great. For example, I used only about 3/4ths of a cup of heavy cream and put extra garlic. Although I'm sure the full amount of heavy cream would still taste absolutely delicious, using half cut some of the guilt.

Yum!  This has been in my  favorites for a while and I just tried it.  It is delicious though I did tweak a couple of things.  First I used more garlic (3 instead of 1) and more parmesan cheese (about 1/4 cup).  I used less than a pound of pasta but I used mini farfalle and that always  seems to go farther than regular pasta.  I just kept stirring it in until it looked right and wound up using about 2/3 .  Finally I used fresh peas because that's what I had.  I put the lid on the pan while the peas were cooking and kept tasting them until they seemed right.  My family thought this was delicious and it was so easy to make!!! Great recipe.

This was VERY good. The only thing I did different was that I followed a previous commenter’s suggestion and added the Parmesan to the cream sauce while cooking. Also added a couple pinches of kosher salt. Family loved it.

I will make this again for sure. I did swap out the rigatoni pasta for whole wheat penne and heavy cream for coconut milk because of my daughter's dairy sensitivity. The sauce was a bit too thin, but I added some cornstarch to thicken it up.  I also added a variety of frozen veggies and fresh tomato other than just peas. Next time I'll make it with fresh basil like I read in the comments.

This is not bad at all;  it was very creamy, almost to the point of being kind of bland. Maybe there would have been more flavor if I hadn’t drained the fat off the sausage, but  I just can’t intentionally leave that much grease in a recipe. Maybe  it would help to use spicy sausage.

I absolutely loved this dish and would certainly make it again.  I used much more garlic because I love it so much.  I used sweet sausage but added a little crushed pepper.  I didn't have enough heavy cream so added milk and some parmesan cheese and let it thicken.  Threw in the frozen peas in the last couple of minutes along with fresh pepper.  Thank you for the great recipe!

I love this recipe. I used linguine pasta since it’s the only available in our kitchen and for the sauce I followed the low fat substitute as suggested by one of the readers . I added few diced carrots and added our leftover pepperoni in the mix. It’s still good in spite of the few changes. I will definitely be making this again.

I didn't like the flavor with italian sausage only. I used milk and thickened with corn starch. Deglazed with a little wine.  Added parm to sauce. Added fresh basil to top off. Used a recipe for mushrooms from Smitten Kitchen. Added them to this dish and that made it a 5.

We loved it!   Very easy to make, quick, and quite tasty!   Even tho it was my first time making it I made a couple of updates based on other reviews - came out perfect!   BTW - I do not cook regularly...

I added the parm cheese in the last couple of minutes of cooking the sauce.   Someone mentioned it helped thicken it.   At the same time I put in a sprinkle of flour.  Not much at all.   Came out nice and thick.

I also added a sprinkle or two of crushed red pepper while simering.   Nice little spice.  Might get the same effect by using medium sausage instead of sweet.

The other modification I did was used bow tie pasta - I just like that better.

One other note for the other beginners out there - I left the fat from the sausage in.  I was not sure since it was not stated, but based on my outcome I would do that again.

Came out great!!

I had to use a 2% milk/flour/butter mixture instead of heavy cream, and used ground Italian sausage instead of sausage in casings. 

Next time I will try using SPICY Italian sausage from the casings/cut into rounds, and add ground red pepper, and lots more garlic and Parmesan. My cold might be worse than I thought, but I could use some more spice in this dish.

Is there another vegetable that would work as a replacement for peas? I keep trying, but cooked peas aren't a favorite of mine--and my kids feel the same.

I used another reviewer's suggestion to use white sauce instead of cream, and was happy with this. I swapped out the rigatoni for some orecchiette pasta that I had in the cupboard. I used spicy Italian sausage for a greater kick. My husband actually liked it, and he doesn't comment on meals much. It was also easy and quick to put together -a big plus in my book! I will be making this again.

I subbed evaporated milk for the cream and only used 3 tbs butter. I had to cook the sauce for longer than 5 minuets (more like 20). I also added red pepper flakes and used more like 1/4 cup of parm and mixed it in. It was delicious!

This recipe is very good.  I seasoned the ground pork like I normally do with garlic powder, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper.  I also added chopped onion and diced red pepper to the ground pork.  Then followed the recipe with no other changes.  Turned out great and I will make again.  Thank you for sharing.

This was liked by the family and I will make it again.  It did seem to need additional seasoning (salt/pepper); I might use more butter next time for additional creaminess but it was good.

I used frozen peas and Aldi's Sweet Italian turkey sausage. I didn't have a wooden spoon, so I used a regular spoon. Since I used a small skillet to serve only one serving, I wished I made a bit more of the sauce. But overall, delicious and filling.

This was OK.  It was good just not a ton of flavor. Glad I made it but will not try again.

Not a hit at my house.  To many peas and not enough sauce.  I didn't enjoy the Italian sausage either.  It makes a really big batch so since we didn't care for it there was a lot left over. Won't make again.

This is a simple recipe. I used about a cup of cream. I also added some asiago to it.  I used about 2T parsley.  Turned out very good. 

This is a good recipe for a quick and easy meal.

Like everyone else suggested I used some flour and 2% milk instead of half-and-half. This was a good recipe, but not nearly enough of the white sauce for 1 pound rigatoni.  Kids loved it.

My family Loved it! I followed the suggestions of using half and half . I also added 1 1/2 tablespoon of Italian seasoning, & 1 tablespoon of red pepper flakes (my family likes a lil spice). It was delicious. Thanks so much for sharing

Delicious.  Very easy and basic recipe, can easily substitute the meat and veges with whatever you have on hand and make a quick meal.  The red pepper was necessary, or at least add something with a little pop... otherwise, it may be too bland.

I made this using half mild and half hot sausage and a little extra parm. I also used 2% milk instead of heavy cream and only 3Tbs butter. Like others the sauce did not thicken so much, so I just saved a little pasta water and added cornstarch and then put that in the sauce to thicken it up. It turned or very tasty.

Great recipe! 
I used half & half instead  of the heavy cream to cut back a little on the fat and it was plenty creamy enough.  I also substituted broccoli for the peas and everyone loved it.

1st time I used a mild Italian sausage, and I found it was good, but lacking pizazz...so my 2nd time I used hot Italian, and I loved it!!!

Followed the recipe exactly. Super easy. Whole family loved it. Husband had 3 helpings. For a slight twist, I added some pancetta and kept some of the Italian sausage as links and sliced them up into the pasta. I liked having the additional flavors and textures.

This was a really good recipe.  My picky eater husband ate it, but said it was too creamy.  I thought it was just right.  I used Johnsonville sweet ground sausage in the green and blue package.  It was easy to find the ingredients in the store and  also easy to prepare.  Will make again, but maybe use less cream.  For my dish, I mixed in a dollop of  Grey Poupon mustard and it was delicious.

Came across this recipe when looking for something different to do with our fresh peas from the garden.  Made it as recipe states, but added onion.  Thumbs up from the husband who even took left-overs to work for lunch the following day.

I enjoyed this pasta dish very much.  After reading the reviews I was concerned it might be bland, so I used 1/2 lb Sweet Italian Sausage & 1/2 lb. Hot Italian Sausage.  I also added about 1 t. of Spicy Italian Seasoning.  I cooked the Rigotoni in water with chicken stock mixed in the water to flavor the Rigatoni.  It was good and I will make it again.

I made this as written the first time and it was fantastic! I just made this again and I used a 22oz jar of Prego Roasted Garlic Parmesan instead of the heavy cream and garlic, and butter. I did this because I had it and wanted to use it up. It was convenient and really good!

Easy to make, fast, and very tasty. Added a little fresh ground pepper to the plate. Next time will try adding a sprinkle of fresh chopped parsley. It just seems to call for it.

This is great. I've made it 3 times now, the last two with spicy Italian sausage and that adds some nice kick. Since I never have cream around I used the milk, butter, flour substitution, and omitted adding butter.  Salt and pepper to taste and do add the Parmesan cheese right into the sauce. It was creamy enough and I even had to add a little milk at the end. Used bow tie pasta as I didn't have rigatoni. Repeat and eat!

This dish was amazing. After reading some of the reviews for this, I was a little concerned about the sauce not being thick enough. After following the directions, my concerns were justified. At 5 minutes, the sauce is too soupy. I let it simmer for another couple of minutes and it was just right. The only addition I made (and it was an extremely minor one), was to add a dash of salt and then some pepper. This is definitely a recipe that I will be adding to the rotation. My partner and roommate hoovered theirs down.

I used small shell pasta instead of the rigatoni. I also thickened it on the stove with parmesan cheese and served it right from the pan. Delicious light spring supper.

I will make it again. After reading the reviews I decided to add 2 Tbls. of flour to the sausage and butter and then add the half-in-half, 3/4 Tsp. Thyme and 1/2 tsp. of Marjoram. I didn't add oil at the beginning and next time I will drain the fat off the sausage. This is an easy, delicious recipe and easy enough to make healthier without losing flavor!

I thought I had a bag of frozen peas when I started this recipe and come to find out, I didn't have any.  I substituted a bag of frozen spinach instead and my family liked the recipe.

Made as written - I thought it was definitely lacking so I started adding things that other reviewers did - more garlic, more cheese, more liquid (I'd used all the heavy cream so I added 1/2 and 1/2) some red pepper ...  I thought the sauce was way too thin, even after letting it cool a little to see if it would thicken - so I added some corn starch to a bit more 1/2 and 1/2 and slowly warmed it some more - sauce thickened up some.  It's lunch for us tomorrow at work so I'm hoping it will taste better after it sits in the fridge overnight.  Easy recipe, which was nice!

I found 12oz. of peas a bit much. Instead, I used about half that amount. Also, I seared whole pieces of garlic (instead of mincing it) before adding the sausage. Finally, I tried about a cup of milk (didn't have cream on hand either) and two tbspns of flour mixed with the hot sausage fat drippings. I'm gluten-free,  so I used gf-rotinnis.... impressively light- probably because I left out the cheese.

Very Good and easy to make.  Make less sauce. 1 cup cream. 3 tbs butter and 2 tbs flour. Melt butter in microwave stir in flour. Add to cream heating on the stove.  Add Parmesan cheese to cream sauce.  Pour cream sauce over sausage and peas blend in pasta.  Grate more cheese over dish.

What a great recipe.  Thanks for sharing. I now have a new way to cook sweet Italian sausage. The only thing is mine didn't come out creamy. So I added 2 c of milk, 6 Tbsp flour, and 4 Tbsp butter. I also added Adobo too. It was great.

Used 1 cup heavy cream and then ran out so I used 1/2 cup half-and-half.  Tasted great, I would probably try to pull back on some of the fat next time- 3 tbs butter and less cream.  Also thought the recipe needed a little salt and ground pepper.  My husband and kids loved it as it was.

I loved this recipe. It was easy, and super fast. It was so yummy. I browned the sausauge with some onion, in addition to the garlic. I also added a few dashes of red pepper flakes to spice up  the sweet sausage. I will definitely make this again and again. Thank you!

This recipe was great and extremely easy to follow. I did however alter it with ingredients. I used mixed veggies with peas, carrots, corn, and green beans, I used provolone and cream cheese because I thought I had Parmesan and I didn't, and I used turkey Italian sausage, grilled chicken strips and shrimp.  It was delicious!!! Thanks for the recipe.

I was disappointed with this recipe.  Very bland.  The sauce was too runny and it had little flavor.  If I every make it again, needs minced garlic and cream instead of milk.

This was very good! My young teenage kids liked it and so did my husband, so that itself gives it 5 stars in my book. It fed us for many days. I made exactly as is, but used whatever pasta shape I had on hand at the time.

This is a favorite at our house! I typically use evaporated milk instead of heavy cream. I also use a few cloves of garlic. pressed & a whole 5oz container of shredded Parmesan.  If I have links & don’t feel like removing the casings, I cook them & then slice them up.

We could easily eat this on a weekly basis! So yummy & quick. One night I started making this & didn't have the cream so substituted whole milk, was not as creamy & thick but did work when in a pinch. Toddlers love it too.

Very good. I doubled the sausage and added 1 pint of cream. I also added 3 TBSP of Parmesan cheese  to cream sauce. 

I did not cook the garlic in the oil. I cooked it with the sausage. I also drained the sausage after browning and then returned it to the pot and then added the remaining ingredients.

This was not too good. I'm not sure if I missed something. It really lacked flavor I think it needed more garlic. I don't think it is worth all the fat and calories in this dish to make it again.

This was fantastic. My wife, who doesnt really like sausage, couldnt get enough of this and wanted to know if there was leftovers so she could take some for lunch. I used 2 cups of Cream, added in some sliced Red Peppers, and Pepper Flakes, used Hot Italian Sausage. At the very end, i added some Flour just to thicken up the sauce and it was fantastic. It looks very nice as well with the white pasta, green peas, red peppers, and black/brown sausage.... VERY good

Yum!  I made this for lunch today and it went very fast.  This is creamy and delicious just like it says.  It also came together in a snap.  I served Parmesan and fresh cracked black pepper on top.  My kids said this is a keeper and I concur : )

This was a very quick and easy weekday dinner.  I made a couple of changes and additions.  I used whole milk instead of heavy cream - the sauce was a bit thinner, but it was still very tasty.  I also added frozen pearl onions and canned mushroom stems and pieces.  I wish I had fresh parsely on hand since I think it would have given the dish a great freshness.

i had to make changes to make this work but i still think this dish deserves a five. fisrt to make it healthier i used sweet turkey italian sausage. i added about 1 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes to create some heat. after i browned the turkey and cooked the peas i added 2tbsp of flour to the mixture to be able to thicken this up when the butter and milk were added. by adding the flour i was able to use 1% milk as the liquid and got a nice thick cream base. i also used raiatore pasta becuse i thought they would be nice becuse of their size. this is a keeper.

I made this exact the first time and thought it was just ok..a little bland but not horrible. I made again with some changes and found it had much better flavor. I minced 2-3 garlic cloves and some onions with hot sausage patties instead of sweet cut up. Instead of milk I used 1/2 and 1/2 added some fresh graded romano and parmesan cheese to the cream base (the fresh grated will melt into the cream sauce). I did thicken sauce right before taking it off the stove with cornstarch. I think this is a recipe you can easily change to suit your personal taste quite easily.

Very good but heavy.  We couldn't eat a lot of it.  I would try just making a white sauce with 1% and using that instead of the cream.

Every one in my house gave it five stars. I thought it was pretty good but maybe I needed it a little more of a kick like red pepper flakes or black pepper. I think i'll try this again with spicy italian sausage.

So easy and so good. I too used flour and milk for the sauce with just a little bit of heavy cream. Very filling, and great for a fall or winter night.

This was good, I did make it with milk in place of the half & half (what I had on hand),also I added 1/2 onion,extra clove of garlic,3/4 c parm cheese, and about 3 T chopped fresh parsley.Still thought it could use a kick so I sprinkled with crushed red pepper flakes and regular pepper-then it was awesome.Like others stated I really liked the easy and quick preparation of the meal.

Very good!  I did add some things just to put more on the plate...not b/c it needed it.  I did WW farfalle, added some onion in with the garlic, added a can of diced tomatoes and added some parmesan to the cream to thicken up a bit.  Also added in some fresh chopped parsley.  The flavor was spot on.  This would be good as stated as well.  Thanks for the recipe

This was very good and simple. I used mini fussili pasta and hot italian sausage and did the low fat version that cookingoncaffeine wrote in her review with the white sauce. I wish that I had made more sauce because it did get a little dry, I was going to make more sauce but I was out of milk LOL. This would be fantasic with mushrooms and onions added to it! Will make again thank you!

Everything tasted great, however the sauce was super super thin.  I did not alter the recipe and I used the heavy cream, but it was still very thin.  I decided to let it sit and thicken like you do with boxed macarroni and cheese and it worked fine.  After that it was great.  I also added the parmesian (plus some extra) to the sauce (instead of adding to the top) and we added an extra clove of garlic which helped the flavor of the sauce.  Very yummy! and easy!

Pretty good. Very simple and so fast!  I used a sun dried tomato sausage instead, which turned out great.  The only alteration I would suggest is to the sauce. The cream and butter alone tastes rather bland, which makes any bite you take WITHOUT sausage very plain and boring. It needs a little more flavor to it, maybe some garlic salt?

Made as instructed I found it bland.  I added some extra parmesan, salt, cracked pepper and plenty of basil.  It was so good I called dibs on the leftovers.  Thank you for the recipe.

Opted for the lower fat option...made a white sauce with 1% milk..Very good!  I think next time, I'll add more peas, just because we like them.  But will definitely make again!!

Very yummy change from normal "pasta sauce" dishes.  Hubby and kids ate it which is always a good sign.  I didn't have a problem with my sauce being too thin and I followed the recipe as is (except for reducing it to about 3/4 so we wouldn't have a ton leftover!)

Pretty good, but I think it needed a bit more garlic...or something. I can't quite put my finger on it. I altered the recipe for health purposes and used fat free 1/2&1/2. Mostaccioli was my pasta of choice.

Really good recipe! I used spagetti noodles instead of the rigatoni and my husband and daughter loved it! Also, I didn't have frozen peas on hand, so I used canned peas and it was wonderful. Quick and easy, but absolutely delish!! Love it and will keep the recipe on hand for future uses.

We thoght that this was only okay.  We did eat it but I will not be making it again.  Maybe it was my fault, I never use heavy cream. I replaced it with fat-free half and half. I also added extra freshly grated cheese.

I changed a few things. I used chicken sausage and penne pasta and sliced onions instead of peas. I also made a low-fat white sauce with flour and 1% milk, as another reviewer suggested, and it was great. It doesn't need all the extra fat and calories. Family scarfed it down.

just some minor changes from the original. (and using already mentioned ideas.) used garlic powder. halved the peas to taste and subbed in a red bell pepper instead.  used spicy sausage. some all purpose flour to thicken the sauce.  black pepper and some red pepper flakes in the sauce as well. delicious, easy, and spicy. a keeper.

Great recipe!  I used half&half to save on some calories.  I think I will do as one reviewer suggested and use low fat milk and maybe turkey sausage next time.

I loved it! I used spicy italian sausage instead and thought it complimented the sweetness of the dish really well. I used some fresh ground parmesean and really loved it. I would recommend using a little more half & half or milk because the sauce turned out to be really thick,I like more runny sauces for white sauce on noodle dishes.

Delicious pasta!  I used mild italian sausage and after it was done browning, I removed, sliced then returned back to the pan to cook all the way through.  Very good, everyone enjoyed it!

This is a favorite of mine and so easy to make~  I do add some corn starch to thicken the sauce a bit and add salt and pepper to the sauce.

Yummy!

Delicious! I made this because I didn't have many ingredients on hand. Wow! I was surprised that such a simple recipe could be so tasty! It was even better the next day.

Great recipe.  I added my own twist by adding one finely chopped small onion and along with a pinch off essence as the cream sauce was simmering.

I followed this recipe exactly and found it to be bland, it definitely needed something.  I'm not sure if I will make it again with some changes...might be worth a shot with some fresh greated cheese melted in the sauce and some basil.

Very good, sauce set up fine.  Needs a few seasoning add-ins.  Doesn't look like picture.

I make this one over and over again. Thanks for a great recipe. I use Italian sausage mostly, but have used the chicken sausage with equally yummy results!

this was absolutely delicious.  my boys (early 20's) who NEVER eat pasta unless it is covered in a red sauce ate it for dinner and then again as leftovers the next day :)  Will definately make this again.  Simple...simple...simple
