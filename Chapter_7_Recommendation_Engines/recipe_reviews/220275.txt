My mom makes this every year for a family BBQ. She lost her recipe and this is it exactly. We just cheat and use cool whip instead of making it ourselves. Thanks for posting this!

I put crushed pineapple (drain juice and make the fruit dry) and strawberries (slices) and also drizzle chocolate syrup on top. AWESOME!

I used to make this and lost my original recipe. I switched out the fruit salad for the pineapple that was in the original recipe I had. Sounded much more appetizing than the fruit cocktail. We made it for a church feeding program. It was very well received.
