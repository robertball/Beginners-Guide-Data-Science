Instead of white rice, I used wild rice. I did not have fresh chile peppers, I used one 4 oz. can of mild diced green chilies. I also upped the garlic powder to a full teaspoon. After tasting it, I added a teaspoon onion powder and a little red pepper flake. Not a bad soup, I liked that it was quick, easy and used pantry ingredients.

Giving this a 4 star based off of how easy it was and that it used staple ingredients. I do however feel it could use some jazzing up. It has a Southwest/Tex-Mex feel to it to me and so next time I might add some beans, corn, cilantro, black olives, and top with tortilla chips. Regardless, I will make this again and play around with more ingredients. Thanks for sharing!

Great base recipe for adding whatever you love! We and only had sushi rice and barley, so I made pearled barely in place of the rice. So good! I would t even know where to find fresh chili’s in my area, so I used a 7 oz can of diced chili’s with the juice. We also added beans and corn because our toddlers love them. Because of the barley, corn and black beans, I used 4 cups of stock instead of 3, and it worked well. They are also obsessed with sour cream, so a dollop went on top. This is an amazing recipe, even before I added the extras at the end!

Love this recipe. I didn't have fresh chilies so I used one small can of mild and one large can of hot chilies. It gave a great kick to the soup. The only other thing I changed was I used garlic infused olive oil. Hubby loved it. I loved it. Great cold night soup and not a ton of calories!
