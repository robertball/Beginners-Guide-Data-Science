Recipe Group Selection: 15, February 2014 ~ The lemon dessert was beautiful when it came out of the oven, but within 5 minutes they all fell.  I don't think it affected the taste, but it sure did the appearance.  I liked the taste and texture, but my family and extended family did not.  I think the lemon taste comes through a little stronger when the dish is warm as opposed to room temp.  I'm glad I tried, and I liked it, but doubtful I will be making it again as I don't need to eat 6 bowls!

DELICIOUS!  This is a nice blend of custard and sponge cake.  I loved it served warm and hubby loved it cooled down.  It's great either way.  No changes are needed to the recipe.  The cooking time was right on.
Thank you Adrian for sharing such a DELICIOUS recipe!

This recipe is a great new find!! These lemon sponge cups do have a delicious cake top and a creamy custard underneath. I had a cup of Half 'n Half that needed to be used so I used that and then added 1/2 cup of regular milk.  The lemon I used yielded almost a tablespoon of zest and 2 1/2 tablespoons of lemon juice. Even though the recipe does not indicate to oil the cups, I did lightly spray with oil before filling. Adrian23, thank you for sharing this delightful recipe.  I will definitely make it again and again! I voted for and made this Recipe Group Selection for the week of February 15, 2014.

Great recipe, but one cup of sugar was a bit much. I will try 3/4 cup for the next batch. Also, the mix will fill four 4x2" ramekins. Thanks for posting!

Recipe Group Selection for the week of February 15, 2014 – I was a little behind getting to this for Recipe Group, but I’m so glad I did.  This is a wonderful dessert, especially nice served with fresh fruit.  The sponge cake portion of the dessert never browned nicely for me, but I’m sure that’s due to my oven.  However the flavor was wonderful and  lemon custard was creamy and delicious.  Expect the dessert to settle as it cools.

Grandma lived in California many years ago, used to make these delicious lemon cups. she had a Meyer lemon tree in her garden, (Meyer lemon  have a sweeter, less acidic flavor and very fragrant smell) 
Her recipe is exactly the same as this one, except, that she use 5 TBSP of the Meyers lemon juice and 2 tsp of grated peels, scalded milk.
They were so delicious, Meyer lemons are not available out side California, I miss grandma's delicious lemon cups so much.
