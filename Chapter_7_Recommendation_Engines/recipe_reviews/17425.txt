Per the recommendation of one of the other reviewers, I halved the amount of chocolate called for in this recipe. The result: awesome. By lessoning the amount of chocolate, the great pecan filling was enhanced- not covered up. I expect I will make these again. Yummy!

These are great!  I increased the pecans to almost 2 cups and I used only about 1/2 cup chocolate chips instead of an entire bag of the pieces as directed.  I just sprinkled the chocolate chips over the top before baking.  I think they'd be far too rich with an entire bag because this was plenty!  Everybody loved them.

The bars are very tasty, but the chocolate was a little overpowering.  If i make them again i will cut down on the amount of chocolate chunks.

Wonderful recipe. I substituded walnuts for the pecans and did not have corn syrup on hand so mixed 1/2 C brown sugar with 1/4 C water. It turned out nicely and everyone has been snitching pieces from it nonstop since it got out of the oven. I will be making this again.

My family loves these rich bars, but I've changed the recipe just a bit: instead of using a whole package of chocolate chunks, I use about a half package of Nestle caramel chocolate swirl morsels instead :)  The result = a not-so-overwhelmingly-chocolatey taste with a creamy caramel addition.

These are probably great for older kids, but mine is only 2 years old, so they weren't particularly "kid friendly" for him...These are really yummy!!  My husband could not get enough of them! Just be careful not to overbake...corn syrup gets very chewy and hard when it is overbaked (happened a bit on the edges of the pan for me).

This is far and away the BEST recipes I have ever used from allrecipes.  Love it!  The first time I made these exactly as written and they were the best thing I've ever eaten, but hubby thought they had too much chocolate.  The next time I used 1/2 bag of chocolate chips instead of the chunks per his request.  I prefer the recipe as written, but either way, these are delicious, and very easy too make.

These were so good and so easy to make! I made the recipe exactly as is, except without vanilla because I didn't have any and they were still delish. Very sweet and very chocolaty. One thing that I would add is these get better after a day or two. They were good straight out of the oven but fell apart a bit. By the next day they held together well and the flavours just seemed even richer. I just covered them and left them on the counter and they seemed to taste better every day!

These are very good and are a much easier alternative to pecan pie.  I followed recommendations and used only 1 cup of chocolate chips.  I wish I'd used the full 2 cups.

Great recipe! I made a couple of changes, because I didn't have any chocolate chunks around. I used regular semisweet chocolate chips instead...and a whole 11.5 oz seemed a bit extravagent. I cut it down to 1 1/2 cups, and then used 2 cups of chopped pecans. The result was incredibly fudgy, moist, chocolaty bars with an awesome pecan crunch! The chocolate chips melted into the filling a bit, and made it taste rather brownie like. Also, since the recipe didn't state which kind of corn syrup to use, I ended up just using up a couple of almost-empty bottles I had lying around. I used probably 1/4 cup each of regular syrup, brown sugar syrup, and dark syrup. It worked just fine. Thanks for sharing the recipe...it's a winner!

I'm giving this 5 stars because it was so easy to make and I received rave reviews from the folks in my office.  As other reviewers mentioned, the sides do get a bit crunchy and should be trimmed - but why throw away?!  They're great dipped in coffee.

These are wonderful.  I am not a great pie crust maker, and I appreciated how much simpler this was than making a traditional crust.  My husband's favorite pie is pecan, and he also loves chocolate, so I made these for him for Sweetest Day.  He absolutely loved them.  I don't really like pecan pie all that much, and I think I ate as many as he did (within two days the whole pan was gone, and there's just the two of us here).  I used broken up milk chocolate bars for half the chocolate, and substituted pecan halves for half of the chopped pecans.  I put the chopped pecans and 1/2 the chocolate in the batter as instructed, and put the pecan halves and the rest of the chocolate on top of the bars before baking.  I am betting this would work well for a potluck or when serving a big crowd, or any other time when serving up a traditional pie may be messy or difficult to do.

Fabulous! Like little bites of pecan pie. Didn't have any chocolate chips so I chopped up 3 chocolate bars. YUM. I think it would be good even without the chocolate. To prevent sticking to the pan, spray with an oil spray. no more sticking! It would be a sin to throw away any of these goodies!

Very good. I was looking for more of a cookie dessert, but you really need to eat this with a fork. Delicious in any case.

I followed the recipe exactly, but the crust on these did not turn out well--tasted like unbaked flour and butter.   Don't know if baking longer would have helped or not.

I have made these for the past two years during the holidays everyone who is a chocolate lover and likes a little twist on pecan pie love them. I have never had to take any home ahter a party. The one down side of this recipe is that the outside alway stick to the pan and is kinda hard. I usually just cut 1/4inch off the outside.

This is a great recipe using half the recommended chocolate. When this is my substitute for pecan pie, I omit the chocolate.  I line my baking pan with foil and spray with PAM.  My solution for "leaky" crust is to substitute 2 refrigerated pie crusts, cut and pieced together.  This is so yummy and easy to serve. After cooling I cut into about 20 pieces, place each in a flattened cupcake liner, and guests serve themselves every Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Also, this freezes well.

Yummy!I had made it just for my family, but some visiting relatives liked it so much they took most of it home.  I made it again the next day for a dinner at a friends house and almost everyone had seconds!!  I will make it again.  One tip, it's even better the next day.

Fantastic.  I add 1 T of bourbon/brandy and more pecans.  I also sprinkle the chocolate chips on top of the crust before I pour in the filling (use less chocolate).  These are always a hit--parents crowded around the platter at a school event and ate them all.

This is such an easy recipe and very tasty as well.  I added a customized version because I made a couple of changes.  I added 1/2 cup of finely chopped pecans to the crust, which made it very tasty.  Since semi-sweet chocolate can be a little overpowering, I used milk chocolate morsels in the same quantity as stated in the recipe.

These cookies were easy to make and delicious. I made them for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them. I followed the directions but used chocolate chips instead of chunks. They had a rich chocolate taste. I noted one rater halved the amount of chocolate which would give them more of a pecan pie taste.

Everyone loved this!  I used walnuts instead of pecans and half the amount of chocolate chips with some regular and some dark and it was amazing!
