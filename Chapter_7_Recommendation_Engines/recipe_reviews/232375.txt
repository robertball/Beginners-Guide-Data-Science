I’ve made this recipe a few times. Parties never fully cooked through in the pan. Tried partially frying and then baked them at 350. I finally figured out the best way—just bake. Grease the baking sheet and bake at 350 for 30 minutes. Patties were perfect and not at all greasy.

Before seeing this recipe I used the exact recipe I use for making my Italian meatballs and the only differences between that recipe and this one is,I used a 1/4 cup of milk and fresh parsley. Also, I don't bread them. The next time I make them I'll add some sort of heat factor. I pattied mine up the day before and allowed the flavors to marinate. #Yum

These were delicious. I used 2 chicken breasts which made 4 solid patties. I used about a teaspoon of salt, only used a quarter onion, personal preference. My 7 year old liked it! With cheese, mayo, Dijon mustard, spinach lettuce and tomato on a pretzel bun :)

Really good.  I used a whole onion instead of a half. I used sweet red chili sauce, as a condiment, and they were great.  My wife loved them too.

These are great. I made this recipe x4 and cooked all the patties, let them sit to cool then stacked them into a ziplock and put them in my deep freezer. The next day I microwaved 1 minute each side. While this recipe replaces my need for the Don Lee chicken burgers (That costco isn't selling anymore...) I did find them to be a little bland. I will be adding a little taco seasoning next time or a little more salt. I also did not coat the patties in crumbs, I just added it all to the mix. Great recipe all around though.

I didn’t have regular hamburger buns, so I formed mine into squares to make chicken patty melts (I used Colby jack cheese) and they were delicious!!

I added a heaping teaspoon of Stacey's Hamburger Seasoning (the recipe is also on this site) to the burger mixture. I also let the mixture rest for a few minutes burger mix before forming into patties. These patties were not bad--I think the added seasoning helped them. These were extremely economical and simple to make.

My husband is a huge red ,eat eater. He loves his burgers. Since I can no longer eat rad meat, he thought he would try this with me. It surprised me because he said he didn’t like chicken/turkey burgers fryer the last time I made them. He raved about these for days and even printed out the recipe! We will definitely be having these often this summer! We did not cook in oil, but used a cast iron pan with olive oil cooking spray! Amazing burgers!!!

If I could give this 3.5 stars I would. Taste was fine but to get the wet mixture to kind of form into shape took the entire 1/2 cup of bread crumbs.

Big hit! Only big deviation from directions is we grilled the burgers. Great taste and texture.

Very good!!  After making my own chicken patties, these will be the only ones we will eat from now on.
I left out the garlic as I wasn't in the mood for garlic.  I added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper for a little zip.  It's very good!
I used Panko Italian bread crumbs in the chicken patty mixture and plain Panko bread crumbs mixed with a little Italian Panko bread crumbs for the coating.
Make sure you cook until the inside temperature is 165 degrees or higher.  I always like to cook my chicken a little higher.  You can finish in the oven if the coating is done but the temp isn't 165 yet.

Great recipe. I didn't coat with breadcrumbs. For those who said mixture was too mushy, I whisked the egg and poured in half, and it was perfect. Also recommend putting them on wax paper or something similar, because the patties  will stick to a plate and be a bit difficult to pick up, if made in advance.

These were super quick and easy to make.  They were also delicious.  My nine-year old at four nice sized burgers.   I will play with the ingredients to switch up the flavors, but this recipe will definitely be in our rotation.

I added some diced green peppers and a jalapeno to give it a little heat!

Made it as is, Only flavor, was the spices added. Really quite bland. Might be ok for someone who can't eat red meat. I won't make it again.

This was my first time making chicken burgers and they came out great!  Easy to make with simple ingredients I always have on hand. Followed the recipe and they were very tasty. I think it pairs well with a crunchy slightly acidic side like cucumber salad or cole slaw.  Will likely become one of my go-to dinners.  I can add variety by easily changing the seasoning .too!

Delicious, Quick and Easy! In order hold the shape, I did have to make extra of the breadcrumb filling and also added some panko. Also to the meat mixture I added a little shallot along with the onion and some fresh chopped basil. They were delicious!! Thank you for this easy, healthy recipe!!!

Delicious! I didn’t have onions on hand so I used onion powder and they turned out great. Topped with Muenster cheese, lettuce and mayo. Definitely going to make these on the regular.

I used a little panko with lemon pepper I had on hand. I did add an extra 1/4 cup of panko to stop from the wetness. Very good recipe. I would make again. All the onion adds a good crunch! Served on onion rolls with some spicy mustard, red onions, and pickles!

I loved these burgers. They were easy to make and very tasty and I would definitely make these again. Hint: If you mix the egg into the chicken and let it sit for a few minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients it tends to be less sticky.

I have made this recipe many, many times. We love it. I do add more bread crumbs and cook them on a Foreman grill.

Delicious,  I didn't have any great expectations as the recipe looked so simple. Sometimes simple is awesome and that was what happened here. My only sub was regular bread crumbs , adding Italian seasoning t hat since I didn't have preseasoned crumbs,  These are great as a slider or just by themselves

It was a great recipe! I did add chopped green pepper and used
crushed saltine crackers in place of the bread crumbs.

Good way to get away from plain old burgers. Def having this again.
