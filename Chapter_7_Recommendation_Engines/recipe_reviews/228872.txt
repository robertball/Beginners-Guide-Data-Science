Very easy and pretty good. I made it on a skillet rather than in the oven because I needed it to cook faster. Instead of mirin, I used sweet marsala (I looked up substitutions and that was the top suggestion, a sweet wine. Sherry wine or white wine with a bit of sugar added to it can also be used)

This was AMAZING!  I am going to make the sauce again this weekend to put on grilled porkchops!  My whole family loved it.  Also, I made extra sauce and mixed it with rice noodles.  Yum!

Great recipe, nice and easy, but personally I would a little less ginger maybe only 3 teaspoons, I found it slightly overpowering. But a great recipe. Goes really well with these beans; http://allrecipes.com/recipe/chinese-buffet-green-beans/detail.aspx

I really liked this recipe!  I was skeptical, but happily surprised.  I followed the sauce recipe exactly except used chicken broth instead of mirin (not a staple in my kitchen).  And the only other changes I made were using one less breast and adding shrooms and onions.  One tip, which others have also suggested, use low-sodium soy sauce.  It was pretty salty and I added no salt to the meat or veg when sauteeing.  I also did this on the stovetop instead of in the oven.  I will definitely make this one again!

Awesome!  I keep my ginger in the freezer and didn't realize I had so little, which amounted to about half of what is listed in this recipe.  To us, and we're ginger lovers, and it turned out to be a perfect amount.  Didn't have the sweet wine but used Rice wine vinegar and 1/2 tsp. sugar. We loved it, grandkids have asked for it since and their mom asked for the recipe because the kids were asking for her to make it at home.  Very tasty, served with Asian style sticky rice, steamed broccoli and the end result was perfect!!  MANY thanks!!

This sauce is delicious!  I cut my chicken into strips and cooked them up in a frying pan with some oil and then put it all over rice.

This was a wonderful recipe! It was so good!!

Just to caution folks, I used regular soy sauce because I didn't have low-sodium  soy sauce and it came out a bit too salty. I would definitely recommend using low-sodium soy sauce as the recipe indicated.

Super easy!  I didn't have low sodium soy sauce so used 1/3 cup regular soy sauce.  I also used white wine instead.  I cooked 22 min in the oven and it was very moist.  Served over rice with edamame.

I LOVE teriyaki chicken, and the best thing about this is that you bake it. REALLY simple!! It's seriously tasty. One improvement, tho, as in all chicken dishes: USE DARK MEAT!!!! MUCH more flavorful, not dry and really tender. STOP worrying about a few extra calories, dump the dry chicken breasts, and use boneless thighs instead. They have them at the store and are not only tastier, but MUCH, MUCH CHEAPER!

The recipe called for WAY too much ginger, and I only used half of the amount that it called for because I didn't have enough to begin with. It also didn't have much taste at all, probably due to the low sodium soy sauce. Very bland.

Tasty and simple. I would make it again, although I find it unnecessary to bake it when a skillet or wok will do. I used another wine for the recipe because there is no japanese wine where I live.

This was fabulous! I did not have minced garlic, fresh ginger or mirin on hand! I used ground ginger and used garlic powder on chicken breasts front to back. Instead of Mirin took the advice of the first reviewer Pro "LatinaCook" who gave suggestions for substitutions...I used cooking white wine. I did use low -sodium soy sauce as well. It had the perfect balance of salt and sweetness! I also used the Fried-Rice Restaurant Style recipe and used a cup of frozen mixed veggies and a bag of frozen brown rice, then went by the recipe. I put the chicken on top of this and served and everyone loved it! Thank you Jennifer for posting this delicious recipe!

AMAZING!  Followed the directions 100%, loved it.  I did add fresh pineapple and red and yellow bell pepper after I followed the directions just to add color.  I think next time I will cube the chicken into bite size pieces.

This is wonderful! I halved the sugar like many of the reviews suggested and it was a winner with my picky family (two toddlers, and a carnivore).

I made this as directed in the recipe.  When I saw it called for 1/2 cup of white sugar I hesitated but went on as no other reviews had commented on a burnt sugar taste.  Within 15 min in the oven the whole house smelt like burnt sugar.  The amount of ginger and garlic were fine for us and in fact may have saved the dish as they could over ride the burnt sugar smell & taste.  Maybe we are more sensitize than some to that taste.  I will not be making this again.

Love this sauce SO much. We've been cooking in in the crock pot instead and it's wonderful! Make the sauce like usual. Arange chicken breasts in the bottom of a crock pot and cover with sauce. Cook on low for 8 hours. :) SO tender and SO delicious!

Excellent. Followed the recipe exactly except cut the ginger in half as other people had suggested. Found it could have used a little more so will try 3 teaspoons next time

I have been making chicken teriyaki for years with a different recipe..  It has always been good.  But this is by far the best chicken teriyaki chicken I have ever made.  My husband went nuts.  My 92 year old father who has no tastebuds left also loved it.  My 25 year old son who is home temporarily between Army assignments referred to this sauce as liquid gold.  It was perfect.  Using the low sodium soy sauce gave it such flavor.  My only change to the whole thing was using turbanadi sugar,  I had no white.   This one is a keeper folks.  Serve it with rice and I made the Winter Fruit Salad from this site.

nice! my husband LOVED it. I did make some adjustments - put only half sugar,I did not have sweet wine so I used regular... also cubed chicken and fried in skillet, no need for baking, it is much faster this way... I served with rice and steamed carrots. Thank you so much for this amazing recipe!

I took  1.5 pounds of chicken breasts and cut it into cubes.  Then I stir fried the chicken, added 32 oz of stir fry vegies & stirfried, and then added the sauce stir fried until thickened and served over rice.  It was just like teriyaki chicken at my favorite chinese restaurant!

Very Yummy!! While I used all the same ingredients, I made a couple modifications in preparation (I'm bad I know). 
I mixed all the ingredients (except the water and corn starch) and pour it over frozen chicken breasts in a gallon zip bag and let it marinate overnight in the fridge, then since I was in a rush to cook after work, I pulled the chicken out of the sauce, chopped it into chucks and sautéed in a skillet until brown then dumped the 'marinade' on it and added the water/starch. It thickened up beautifully and was so tasty!

The flavor was mellow and subtle but very good. It would be better if marinaded for a day, in my opinion.

This was soooo scrumptious. The only substitutions I made were to use 1 t. powdered ginger instead of fresh and sherry instead of mirin. OMG, it was so delicious. I was thinking this marinade would be great on salmon and on steak tips, too so may try those. If you like teriyaki flavor, try this!

A very easy dish that turned out wonderfully! I will often serve this over white rice or with homemade fried rice and it's been a hit in our household.

I did not use mirin or red pepper flakes, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. The sauce was amazing, we used it on the sides as a dressing too(broccoli and sweet potatoes) Definitely a keeper only wish I had made more the chicken!

Don't do what I did which was to use regular strength soy sauce! Low-sodium is a MUST! Despite my screw up, the flavor was delicious. I substituted rice wine vinegar with 1/2 tesp sugar for the mirin wine and had to use ground ginger instead of fresh. I will do this again with all the correct ingredients next time...it was an easy recipe.

I just made this tonight I loved it. Yet my boyfriend don't like spicy but he still said it was delicious. But lol he can't handle to heat. I did not have to Japanese wine so I used Masala wine.  It was delicious. And I only used 2cps of soy and one tablespoon of red pepper flakes.  Bc yeah it was really spicy of I used 2tablespoon

Yum! Very simple and totally delish! The only change I made was adding some onion (we love onion)and cubing the chicken, otherwise stuck exactly to the recipe and loved every bite. Served over rice with some steamed broccolini and carrots.

Loved this!  Very tasty and simple.  I couldnt find mirin but found sake cooking wine.  I will use less sugar next time as it was a little sweet.  This sauce would be great on ribs to.  I made fried rice and everyone loved it.

Can't wait to try this again. Even my picky 19yo son said it was "pretty good." High praise for a millennial. Honestly, the made-from-scratch teriyaki marinade and sauce was heavenly. I used extra ginger and garlic. The baking made for a creamy fall-off-the-bone tenderness. This will be a go-to meal for our family.

This dish as insanely salty.  I used reduced sodium soy sauce and still couldn't eat it.  It seems like it needs something to cut the saltiness of the soy sauce.

Great recipe and the sauce came out great! I will do this again. Also I didn't use the oven just cooked the chicken separately and then added the sauce. Simmered for ten minutes and played. Next time will add veggies and onions to provide a pop of color. Overall great recipe

Wife and I enjoyed it last night. Would make again. Used four chicken breasts instead of 12 thighs but did not alter the amount of Teriyaki. I might use less teriyaki next time.

Excellent. Followed recipe exactly which I always do first time out. The thighs were done after 50 minutes cook time. Tastey and moist. I only cooked 6 thighs since there are only two of us but I did make the  full amount of sauce and had about half left over. Will definitely make it again.

My family LOVES it! My kids ask me to make this weekly. I found the sauce thickened in less than 10 minutes, not complaining about that. I omitted red pepper flakes so not too spicy for the kids. I make 1.5 the sauce and save a little for people to put a little on after it is cooked if they want. The saved sauce is super strong and a little goes a long way.

I made this last night. It was delicious! My boyfriend is extremely picky and he said it was "delicious" "a win" and even gave me a thumbs up. I substituted chicken broth for the wine, and omitted the red pepper Flakes. I don't really know how much ginger I used. I kept cutting some and using a garlic press to put it in the sauce then tasting it. I made the sauce on the stove in a pan and used chicken cutlets. I put the chicken in an oven bag then put the sauce in the bag and baked it on 350° for 25 minutes. The chicken was so tender and delicious. I will definitely be making this again.

Ugh, almost unbearable for me. I gave most of it to my other half. Super salty, and yes I used the Kikkoman LOW sodium soy sauce. The man enjoyed it well enough but I really couldn't eat it.

This was good.  I used 8 chicken thighs and cut down the ginger to 2 tsp, but to me the ginger taste was still too strong.  Next time I will cut down to 1 tsp.

This was wonderful! I took advice from different viewers and added less ginger and I cubed the chicken, cooked it in the wok with some truffle garlic oil and then simmered it in the sauce. I cooked the sauce just as the recipe suggested. Served it over rice and made Asparagus with Lime and Ginger from this website. Yuuummmm

Made this for my family tonight and I was pleasantly surprised.  It was very yummy and tasted better than I expected. The prep work was was easy.  I took the raw chicken breast and cut them into long slices and placed them in a baking dish wiht the sauce. Cooked for about 30 min. Delish!!

Thanks for the recipie! My son, pickiest eater ever, liked it. The only thing I did different was sprinkle some ginger instead of fresh.  I  wasn't sure if I should cover it or not though . So covered it for 25 min.  Chicken didn't seem cooked, then uncovered for another 5

Thanks again!

Substituted garlic and ginger powder,as I hadn’t any fresh in my fridge.  Is.so used low sodium soy and only 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  Everyone devoured it.  Makes a great sauce for rice or vegetable topping too!

I poured this sauce over an entire (10) pack of thighs , multiple times and then stir fried a ton of our favorite veggies and then chop the chicken up and add back in when ready to eat.  It's a delicious little sauce and puts a really nice glaze on the chicken by the time it's done backing.

The sauce was great. I’d keep this recipe just for that and use it on other meats or other cuts of chicken as well. It didn’t take 10 minutes for my sauce to thicken though. Maybe more like 5. It was definitely hard to scrape my baking dish after this was in the oven, but the flavor of the sauce was really enjoyable.

This homemade teriyaki sauce is the best we have ever had.  It was very simple to make and the fresh ginger made all the difference.  Will definitely make again.  Only suggestion would be to cut the chicken into small bite sizes and then cook.  That way the chicken gets more of the sauce in each bite.

My family loves this recipe, including all the children! It's so easy to make and you can easily add veggies and toss with the teriyaki sauce, if you like. Sometimes I double the sauce to make sure we have enough to to around. The only thing different I do is use 1 tsp dried ginger in place of the fresh, and sherry instead of the mirin wine.

This sauce is really thick and sticky and says on the chicken when baking.  I used boneless thighs and baked at 400 degrees for about 25-30 minutes.  I like this recipe a lot.

I made this for my Sweetie who thinks he's the teriyaki authority. He loved it! I did tweak some, as I always do, but the base was a perfect jumping off point. He told me to keep thi s one scrounge because he wants to try it on pork and fish, too.

LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED LOVED this recipe, if you don't you didn't make it right! It is the BEST Teriyaki Chicken ever! We didn't have Mirin sauce so we subbed with chicken broth and it was perfect! Also, we just had dried ginger and it was fine!
With the white rice I sprinkled it with 5 Chinese spice so was the perfect match to the Teriyaki Chicken! Side salad with avo we sprinkled on Dill and Paprika was great!
We had THE PERFECT DINNER, we will have soon again!

Very nice recipe. Everyone liked it. I changed it slightly but would be great as is. Here is what I did differently. I used sherry wine instead of the one called for. I cut the chicken into large chunks and cooked them in the pan with the sauce for about 15-20 minutes stirring occasionally. I also covered the pan for a couple minutes. Oh and I added a package of sliced mushrooms. Delicious served with jasmine rice with peas and carrots cooked into the rice. Salad on the side.
Edit: I made this again but with skinless, boneless legs and instead of cutting them into pieces I just sautéed them in a little olive oil first, then added the sauce to the pan and cooked for a few more minutes. I made the mistake of adding salt and pepper to the meat before sautéing and the dish was too salty. Despite that, it was really good over rice.

Very easy recipe to follow and it turned out delicious! I ended up putting some of the sesame sauce aside and stir fried vegetables and low mien in it. My only advice is to make sure the sauce simmers long enough to thicken up! My sauce ended up being a little watery than I expected but it still tasted great nonetheless.

Partially cooked the chicken breast on the griddle on high to seal in the juices, then diced and placed in baking dish covering with the sauce, covered the dish with parchment paper  (I don't use aluminum foil) and finished cooking in the oven. I doubled all the ingredients for the sauce, except only used 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of freshly grated ginger. Served with jasmine rice, steamed brocolli, hot jasmine tea, and purchased lomein from the local Chinese restaurant. This was a big hit starting with husband all the way down to the 14 year old. Taste so authentic, it was good!

Great recipe, I did it a little differently and deboned some thighs, wrapped the skin around the thighs and fried them in peanut oil to get a nice crunchy skin. When I ladled the amazing teriyaki sauce on them, it stuck like glue and was off the chain..thank you, thank you...

This was pretty good. I stuck to the recipe (except I used brown sugar instead of white). I also browned the chicken in an ovenproof skillet before adding the teriyaki sauce and then popped the whole thing in the oven - for about 10 minutes at 350°F. It was tender and flavourful. One thing I would suggest is to use a good quality soy sauce, it makes up the bulk of the sauce so the better the soy sauce, the better the result.

This creates the perfect Teriyaki sauce!  My family loves it.  I cut up chicken in small pieces and fry in a wok with coconut oil.  I then remove the chicken and fry up some veggies.  I remove those and then make the sauce in the same pan.  I used a little less ginger and I used dried ginger.  Also didn't have mirin so I used white wine mixed with a bit of sugar.  After  sauce had thickened I added back in the chicken and veggies.  Served over white rice for my husband and riced cauliflower for me!  Delicious!

This is delicious!! I used ground rather than fresh garlic, but it was still incredible. Most of the way through making the sauce, I realized I grabbed chicken thighs instead of breasts at the store! I cooked for 30 minutes with them completely covered by the sauce and I couldn't be happier. Going to try this on salmon sometime as someone else suggested.

This was yummy and got a big thumbs up from the family.  We agreed that adding some vegetables to the sauce would be good.  Will try that next time.

Would be better on the BBQ where it can be basted more frequently to build up a thick, sticky sauce.  Don't skimp on the red pepper flakes.

Delicious!  I made as per the recipe with the following exceptions: I used Gewürztraminer in place of Mirin and I diced the chicken breast before mixing with the sauce and baking. I covered the casserole dish for the first 20 minutes and had it uncovered for the rest of the baking time. I will try leaving it uncovered next time. I agree with the previous reviewers, definitely use low-sodium ingredients.

This dish is fantastic! There were no leftovers. However, I highly recommend using low-sodium soy sauce only. Otherwise, It will be a bit salty.

My family loved this chicken. I made it on the stovetop with boneless skinless chicken thighs. I drained the fat and browned the chicken well before turning off the heat and adding the sauce. I will probably serve this with a fried rice next time and some quickly cooked zucchini and sprouts.

Perfect!  Just as good as eating out!  I will use this as my to to Teriyaki sauce in the future.  I did not have the mirin, so I used a white wine I had in the fridge.  The sauce is delicious.  I am serving it with steamed vegetables over short grain brown rice.
Happy happy cook!

I made the recipe exactly as directed except that I did not have LOW SODIUM soy sauce. So mine was VERY salty. Anyway, I still loved the recipe and served mine with white rice and chopped broccoli which I steamed with the rice as it cooked. It is so easy to do and gréât for a day when you don't really have time to cook.  I would make this again and again. I think the leftover chicken will also be gréât on a salad with a bunch of crispy vegetables and maybe even some pineapple. By the way, the recipe makes a lot of sauce.  (Oh, I iforgot I did not have any mirin so I used sherry.  It was good anyway !!!) And one last thing.  The sauce has a lot of sugar in it so keep an eye on it so that it does not burn in the 400 degree oven.

I cut the chicken into small chunks then browned it in a skillet. Then I put it into a baking dish and poured the sauce over it. I served it with the baked rice. I only put 1/4 of the ginger that was recommended in the recipe and 1/4 of the red pepper flakes. Next time I will add a little more pepper flakes, but I will keep the same amount of ginger. It was delish!! My family loved it also!!!
I think it would be fine to cook in a covered skillet on top of the stove, but since I was making the baked rice, I went ahead and put it in the oven.

Sauce was far too salty, even with low sodium soy sauce.  At 400  degrees, the chicken was burned.  If I were to make this again, I would use half soy  sauce and half water to cut the salt.

I made this exactly as described and it was excellent!  For the record though, this is pretty much "General Tso's Chicken".  I usually prepare this dish on the stove top, with Sun-Bird General Tso's Chicken Seasoning Mix, which does not require baking.  However, this (baking) method seems to coat the chicken better so that it tastes more like what you expect to get at a good Chinese restaurant.  Serve it over white rice with a little butter and Garam Masala mixed in.  Or, if you are adventurous, skip the Garam and go with crushed red pepper.  Also, a little chopped up broccoli, peppers (mild or hot), or minced butternut squash (or all three!) added to the sauce will give it an extra oomph!

This was a hit with my family. I substituted the sugar with Xylitol to keep down on the carbs, went 50/50 soy sauce/fish sauce because I didn't have enough soy, and I didn't use any Japanese wine because I didn't have any. Even so, it turned out fantastic and everyone enjoyed it .  The best part? Super, super easy to make!

I made this recipe for the first time today. First, it was really easy to put together. I tried to follow the recipe as written, but I didn't have mirin so I substituted low-sodium chicken broth.  I paired this dish with basmati rice and sugar snap peas cooked with a little olive oil, green onion, garlic and pepper. Ultimately the chicken came out well - plenty of sauce to keep it nice and moist too. It did taste a little ginger-heavy to me, but I think that opinion can vary widely - my fiance loved the rich ginger flavor. I'd definitely make this again.

okay, it was a 'use the items on hand' kind of day so i was forced to make replacements but it came out amazing and i li8terally can not stop eating it!   so firstly i sliced my chicken breast up and dredged each piece in the cornstarch.  then i pan fried it in some olive oil.  the substitutions i made were white wine vinegar in place of the mirin and regular soy sauce (who uses low salt? that stuff is nasty!).  also i used 1 tsp of powdered ginger, garlic powder and onion powder as well as a generous hit of sriracha in place of the chili peppers.  
All the subs keep the same spirit of the recipe and it is definitely a keeper in my books!

It was certainly better than some of the other teriyaki chicken recipes i've tried. Be certain you use low sodium soy sauce.

I cooked this last night and it was a big hit.  My husband turned his nose up at it until he tasted it and then said, You need to bottle this stuff.  It is great.  We had made rice to go with the chicken and put the sauce over the rice and it was fantastic.  Gonna do this again and make the rice, add some mixed veggies and shrimp and put the sauce on for flavor and have shrimp fried rice.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated, but I didn't have mirin. It came out okay except the recipe called for too much ginger. The ginger over powers the entire dish, so next time I would cut it down by 1/2.

This was awesome! My husband couldn't stop praising me and teased that it was actually take out ;) I also only used 3 tsp. ginger, but they were heaping. I have a baby so made it earlier in the day (nap time) and put it in the fridge till I was ready to bake it. It was easy enough that my 10 year old helped too! I will definitely be making this again. Thanks Jennifer!

Did not use the full amount of ginger and still found it to be too much. Flavor wasn't great, actual chicken came out dry and bland. Edible but not really enjoyable. You win some, you lose some!

Awesome!  My picky family loved it and has requested that I make it again.  Per other reviews, I only used 3 teaspoons of the ginger, and slightly less than 1/2 cup of sugar, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I found that the sauce thickened up really nicely on the stove.

Too salty for our tastes and the soy sauce was overpowering (I used lite La Choy soy sauce.)  My mom is always urging me to cut down on the salt in my cooking but this was too salty even for me.  Odd taste.

I did not change a thing except to change the servings amount to 2 servings. I fixed it with Asian mix vegtables that I mixed in with Brown
Rice and the rest of the sauce. Was quick, easy, and delicious. I might
cut down on the sugar a bit, but that's all I would change. Thanks for 
a great recipe and I'll never buy Teriyaki Marinade again.

We really enjoyed this recipe. The chicken was unbelievably moist, even for white meat. I didn't have any fresh ginger, so I substituted 1 tsp of ground ginger, and used rice wine vinegar instead of mirin. I like to follow the recipes exactly the first time I try them, but I just used what I could find in the house. I also cooked the chicken for about 40 minutes, until the rest of dinner was done - rice and roasted brussel sprouts. The sauce thickened nicely on the stove, but it made a lot of it - would even have been enough for double the amount of chicken. It was a hit with my family and I will definitely use this recipe again - very versatile!

I just made this tonight and its a keeper!!!  Everyone, including my husband who does not like boneless, skinless chicken, went for seconds.  I did take the suggestion of using a bit less ginger.  The recipe made enough sauce that I was able to spoon extra over the chicken.  The sauce went nicely over the rice I made with it also.

I've made this a number of times and I always forget how good it is. I serve it over rice with steamed broccoli because it sops up the sauce best. If there are any leftovers they're even better if that's possible. I make it exactly as the recipe calls for.

I LOVED THIS recipe! I used chicken thighs, because they were on sale, and used less ginger as per other reviews, but kept everything else the same.  My husband said keep this recipe on hand!

This was good but just a heads up, if you use regular soy sauce or tamarind sauce, as I did, 1 cup is way too much.  It could probably be reduced to 1/2 cup to reduce the saltiness.

I love terriyaki chicken, but didnt like the taste of this one. Find it better tasting and simpler to use premade marinades & basters.

We liked it.  I cut up the chicken in chucks because I thought that's what the picture looked like.  It cooked great this way.  Very flavorful.  Juicy.  Tasted like a restaurant meal.  
Dh liked it too and he's picky about his sauces.  He likes them thick and this was.

Great!  I think 200C is too hot for the chicken, next time I'll put it at 180 for the same amount of time.  The sauce is amazing though - even though it was reduced on the stovetop, no burning in the oven.

This recipe was fairly good and easy to make. I decided to do it on the stove top per some other reviews and because I can never get chicken cooked just right in the oven. I used a package of chicken breast tenders to cut down on prep time as I like my chicken bite-sized. Anyway, this called for WAY too much sauce for me, I left with about half of it after all was said and done, which I love having extra sauce but it was just wasteful. If I make this again, I would probably cut the recipe in half besides the cornstarch because the sauce was still a bit runny even after having time to cook and set. Anyway, the flavor was great, I liked the mix of sweet and spicy. I used Low-sodium soy sauce and I think that was the perfect amount of salt. I also didnt have fresh or ground ginger so I had to make due with crystallized, but it was still very tasty. I added a bag of freshly steamed stir-fry veggies and served over rice. Overall, a good recipe, just found the extra sauce a bit wasteful. Thanks!

Surprised myself on this one.  Teriyaki sauce is not hard to make.  Will make again.

Wonderful recipe! I used chicken broth instead of mirin since I couldn't find it where I live, and low sodium soy sauce as suggested by other reviews. Doubled the sauce so we would have plenty for our rice and veggies. Flavor and consistency was perfect. My husband really liked the heat from the red pepper flakes.

This was so easy to make as you just put the sauce over the chicken and pop it in the oven.  I used regular soy sauce, and it was much too salty, but the flavors were wonderful and the chicken came out very tender.  My husband loved it.  I will get the low sodium soy sauce for the next batch.

This dish was excellent. Prep time only 15 minutes. I substituted cooking sherry for the Japanese wine. Served with Saffron rice and steamed broccoli. This dish has a little kick and a lot of flavor.
