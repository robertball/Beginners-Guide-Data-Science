This was a huge hit with the boys. I was able to make each one their own personal "egg flipped over" with their own favorite cheese. My husband said this is almost as good as an omelette! I served this with home fries and homemade vanilla-glazed chocolate doughnuts. Very satisfying breakfast for my three men.

This is absolutely the best egg recipe.  It's very easy for kids to make and it's delicious!  I'm not just saying this because Cristiana is my favorite niece either!  She's well on her way to becoming a terrific cook!

Great recipe! I add just a bit of both onion and garlic powders.  Perfect on an toasted English muffin with a slice of Canadian bacon!

One word....Y-U-M-M-Y!!! I made this for my 4 year old son who does not like eggs and he gobbled it up and asked for another. The second time I made it, I sliced up honey ham lunch meat and whisked it into the egg and milk and he really liked that. He asked that next time I make it with bacon. This is perfect for us to because he stays home full time and is an only child so I can make this small and quick! Thanks for sharing. Kim

Very good. I make this as a sandwhich. I use american cheese. This is like a moons over my hammy at the resturant I work at. I like a meat added to mine. Ham is a good choice.

I used a slice of American. I make as directed but also just fry the egg and flip and place cheese also. I have taught this recipe to my children also.

Easy, quick and delish!  This is a nice change from scrambled eggs.  This would be great to roll up with link sausage inside for kids!

For a kid's recipe, I will give this 5 stars. My 2 year old gobbles is up, and even my egg-hating 4 year old ate it. I would suggest using a small skillet, the first time I made it in a large one and the egg spread out too far. 
Thanks for the idea!

This is tasty!  Just one thing to remember, if you make more than one of them, turn the heat down a bit and add more butter. The first one came out way better than my second, but it's a easy, tasty breakfast none the less!

So I sort of glanced at the ingredients and didn't even bother reading the directions. I only had grated cheddar cheese and probably not even a tablespoon at that...gave it a pretty nice crunch. I didn't even read that I was supposed to scramble the eggs with milk either but somehow it worked out.
