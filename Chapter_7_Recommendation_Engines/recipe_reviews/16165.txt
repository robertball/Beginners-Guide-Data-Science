So savory and yummy! Where I live I can not obtain beau monde seasoning, so I used thyme instead, per another reviewer's suggestion.

I cubed last night's roast, along with the left-over carrots, onions and potatoes from the pot. I made a nice amount of home made gravy, which is so superior to store-bought and so easy as well. Mixed all and covered with the batter for a home made biscuit mix (can be found easily on-line or on this site). Lovely, and fills a huge casserole..Quite a comfort dish and great served with green beans and a jello salad.

Tasted like the inside of a low priced frozen pot pie. My preference is quick but tastes like you spent a lot of time. Try it if you like the frozen!

Very delicious! Instead of using canned gravy as called for, I would really recommend making gravy from scratch (this site has that recipe, too!) - it doesn't take any more time (you can work on the gravy while the potatoes and carrots are cooking) and makes a HUGE difference (as in, "tastes like frozen" versus "can I have seconds, Mom?") Also, I subsituted thyme for the Beau Monde. An excellent chilly night/comfort food dinner that stuck to my family's ribs!

I made a few changes to the recipe but we really liked it!  I used leftover roast and gravy and added, in addition to the carrots and potatoes, a clove of garlic, 1 cup sliced mushrooms, 1/2 cup diced celery and 1/2 cup frozen peas along with a teaspoon of worchestershire sauce.  Didn't have jarred beef gravy so added a packet of dry gravy mix to the gravy I had leftover. Omitted the Beau Monde seasoning because I didn't have any.  Only problem I had was that by the time I added all the extra veggies I had enough to serve about 10 so doubled the topping.  We have lots of leftovers but it was delicious and really very easy!  A great way to use up the leftover roast.  My husband called it beef stew with a crust!  Will definitely make again!

I made this for lunch today. It went together quickly, and the first thing my husband said was MMMM!  He really enjoyed it.  Maybe the other reviewer used a poor grade of gravy or meat.  I used Heinz gravy (substituted mushroom because that's what I had on hand) and I used chopped up left over prime rib.  Also I added garlic and sauteed it with the onions before combining.  Anyway, I thought this was a tasty dish!

Will definitely make this again.  Added celery, garlic, and frozen peas as was suggested.  Threw in some McCormicks steak spice.  Husband liked it!

Delicious way to turn leftover roast beef into another meal.  Husband and 2 year old loved it too. Added corn as I had it leftover, didn't have beau monde like I thought I did so used a garlic and herb seasoning.  Also used half homemade gravy and half jar.  Underside of crust in middle didn't cook all the way after 25 min so put in for another 5.

I made our family's German/Austrian recipe for Rouladen Sunday evening and was wondering what I could do with the four leftover rolls I had. This was the perfect solution! I just sliced those babies up, used whatever gravy I had left and added a can of mushroom soup, along with all the vegies suggested the recipe. Instead of placing the mixture in a pie crust, I served this in individual French onion soup crocks and topped with a Bisquik crust. Twenty minutes in the oven and we were good to go. Thanks so much Steph!!

Deinately make your own gravy, and couldn't find Beau Monde seasoning so I used Herbs de Provence and we all thought it was a great way to use up leftover roast beef.  It did not taste like a frozen meat pie, my DH would not have put a second forkful in his mouth if it had, he hates frozen meat pies.  Thanks for posting this, it goes in our regular file.

A very good way to use leftover beef.  It does need to cook longer than 30 minutes - more like 40-45 for the crust to bake.  Many things can be added to it if you want.  Thanks for the recipe.  Will make again.

This was a great recipe with lots of options for alternatives.  The only thing I did that was majorly different was I made a bottom crust out of biscuit mix and baked it in the bottom of the casserole dish before I added the filling and the top crust.  It was DELICIOUS!!

This turned out pretty well...the only thing that didn't work quite as I expected is the underside of the crust didn't solidify nicely...I think the recipe needs to point out that the filling should be HOT when the crust is spooned on top to avoid this.  Also, I didn't have the seasoning on hand so I skipped it (and the bouillon) and it was seasoned enough for my family's taste.

I tried it but I used left over pot roast, with all the stuff already in it, and added mashed potatoes on top under Bisquick crust. Also added corn and Worcestershire sauce. was yummy.

Just OK. I am never impressed with baking mix crusts. Maybe some day I'll learn to stop making them :-) The filling seemed to have too much gravy and not enough meat and veggies, which I wasn't impressed with but my husband liked. According to him, there is no such thing as too much gravy.
