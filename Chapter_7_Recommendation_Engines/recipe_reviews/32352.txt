I find that a strawberry daiquiri will always turn out better using fresh strawberries and superfine sugar.  Using superfine sugar will disolve instantly.  If you have a good blender, blend granulated sugar (alone in the blender) for a good 20-30 seconds and you'll get your own superfine sugar.  The rum quantity was great.  I would leave out the carbonated beverage, though, because it takes away from the strawberry flavour.

Made some changes ... but who doesn't?  1/2 cup sugar sounded too much, so I decreased 1/4 cup.  Used a combination of Roses lime juice and fresh lime juice.  Instead of lemon juice, substituted prepared orange juice.  Be sure to blend this long enough to give sugar time to dissolve.  Fantastic cocktail.  My husband and I enjoyed a pitcher of these, congratulating ourselves for the $$ we saved, rather than ordering one after another in a bar!

This recipe has some definite potential! It was tasty, but just too sour for my tastes. I'll make it again, but with less lemon and lime juice. The consistency was just right, and the pinky hue made it fun to drink .I made it without rum.

Very good!  This is a great cocktail if you don't care for a strong alcohol taste.  I subbed club soda for the lemon-lime soda.  I rimmed the glass with granulated sugar.  I recommend sweetening the drink with simple syrup or superfine sugar, as the regular granulated sugar can be a little gritty.  Use extra soda instead of rum for a refreshing mocktail.  My kids love to drink these (without the rum, of course) in a fancy glass rimmed with sugar and garnished with a lime wedge.  Delicious!

I made these for a bunch of 40+ women at my little sister's 40th birthday party and they were a huge hit. I try to avoid sugar so I used fresh strawberries I cut up the night before and sweetened with Splenda and because I forgot to buy lemon juice I used a sugar free lemonade mix in place of the lemon juice. The girls loved them, thanks for a great drink recipe!

Kids love it obviously without the alcohol.  My husband and I love it with Citrus Bacardi and Citra soda.  This is a terrific recipe.

Quite tasty.  We like a sour kick.  I used 3 c. of fresh strawberries, Key West Lime juice and fresh lime juice, juice of two fresh lemons and zest from the lemon and the lime.  Myers Rum gives a nice flavor.  Must say I am enjoying it.  Refreshing on this 90 degree day. I omitted the carbonated soda.  It's not necessary.  The soda would enhance a nonalcoholic version.  Alas, we are lushes.

Perhaps due to our inferior blender or not, but either way, the ice was too much for the blending and I had to cut down on the amount.  Also left out the soda, and put in a wee bit more strawberries.  Loved the touch of lime and lemon, though!  Would definitely make it again.

Very tasty. I did cut down the amount of lemon and lime for my own personal preference. I also cut down the amount of alcohol. Do not let the cocktail fool you, even with a little less alcohol this packs a punch and it's so delicious you won't realize the amount of alcohol you're consuming!

This was very delicious. I used a liberal amount of fresh strawberries - almost an entire carton as they are very cheap in-season. I also mistakenly bought frozen limeade concentrate instead of soda. When I made the limeade up, it worked fine. My friend who is not much of a drinker requested additional rum. We almost doubled the amount of rum (bottoms up!), and the drink still masked the flavor very well. I would HIGHLY recommend, but I would also highly recommend buying FRESH strawberries for this drink.

I'm giving this less than 5 stars, because I'm mildy  and don't think I made it right. I 'eye-balled' the ice (how do you measure ice anyway?) and felt there was much too much ice. I also cracked my blender and half the ingredients came out and I re-did it. And my blender really sucks and is old. But despite all that,  my frosty concoction turned out pretty good! It could use more strawberry taste, but if I didn't put in so much ice... :)

Wonderful daiquiri recipe! A perfect balance of berry, citrus, and rum. Usually I fiddle with recipes after the first try, but with this one, there's no need.

This gets rave reviews every time I make it! And it doesn't matter whether I use fresh-squeezed lemons/limes or use the pre-squeezed juice in bottles or whether I use fresh or frozen strawberries. The only thing that really makes a difference is using powdered sugar rather than regular, since the regular doesn't dissolve or distribute evenly. I'm also liberal with what 4 oz. of strawberries means to me. I've tried this with raspberries, too, and am looking forward to trying it with mangos. Mmmmm! Thanks for the great recipe!

I found this while looking for something else and I'm in love! I love this recipe. I thought it would be too much ice but it turned out perfect. I put a couple extra strawberries in but the lemon and lime contrast is perfect. Mine was a little thick to pour at first but I highly recommend this recipe. Thanks!

I opted out of the lime & lemon juice and just used a lime&lemon carbonated soda I had on hand. Decreased the ice to 4 cubes since my strawberries were already frozen solid through. Perfect!

I really liked this recipe. I was looking for something to make with rum other than Mojitos, but I only had strawberries. Well, this was perfect!  Changes: I tripled the strawberries (fresh) and next time I will decrease the sugar since the strawberries have their own natural sugar. All I had was club soda, which worked out great! But I LOVE club soda. I also used fresh lime juice and a little more rum than called for :)

Oh my goodness; I made these for cinco de mayo and they were wonderful. Made exactly as directed. So much better than mix. I bought a bag of ice at the store for easier preparation and was glad. Thank you

Made these for a get together with the girls at work and we loved them.  They are not too sweet, which I really liked.  The only thing I didn't like was that you could easily drink a lot of these and not remember the rum!!! (Maybe that it is not so bad!)

Very nice sweet and tart balance.  I was out of any sort of lemon-lime soda so I substituted Gran Marnier.

Perfect recipe! Big hit at an all girls get together I had recently. I used frozen whole strawberries, I did make a simple syrup and used 1/2 c of that, sweet and sour mix (I had it so I used it), and but the blender on slushie. Everyone loved them and if too sweet, added a squeeze of lime into the individuals glass to suit their taste :-)  Make some non-alcoholic ones tonight for our Sunday movie night! Thanks for this recipe!!

I made this for my friend's birthday party, another friend made Vodka crush, everyone thought the Vodka crush was great until they tried my Daiquiris. After that everyone put the crush down and never touched it again. My small party of 5 insisted I make 3 more batches and raved about it all over facebook. This cocktail is an epic win ;D

These were really good and went down so easily!  I didn't follow the measurements exactly, but it was probably close.  I used Coconut Rum instead of regular and oh my goodness!  I highly recommend you try it that way.  It was the perfect amount of sweetness for me, without adding any sugar.  Will definitely make them again.

This was a great recipe! I was attracted to it for it's use of fresh lemon and lime juice. I doubled the amount of strawberries and made in 2 batches. This will is surely a recipe I will use again and again.

I added more strawberries, but otherwise kept it the same. Delicious!   In a normal size blender, you'll need to make it two batches.

These are great! I only had fresh strawberries, and I think I used more than the recipe called for...I also did not have lime juice. Instead of Sprite I used a strawberry flavored calorie free sparkling water, which I highly recommend! I wasn't going to add it at all but without the liquid my blender couldn't handle it. Excellent strawberry flavor :)

I had a party this was a hit! Both men and women loved it. They commented that it wasn't that sweet and it didnt give them a stomach ache. I did try to save calories and used splenda instead of sugar and diet soda. I had to half the recipe because it didnt fit in my blender, but i used the same 4 oz of strawberries and 3/4 cup alcohol. I also put 4 fresh strawberries in each batch. The boys drank it with jack daniels, girls had canadian club.

this really is the best strawberry daiquiri!  This was great.  I only made half the recipe each time so it would fit in the blender.  I probably used double the amount of strawberries and along with the sugar I added in some grenadine for extra sweetness.  It really was great!  I honestly couldnt taste any of the lemon lime soda in it, so if you dont have that ingredient it may be fine not to use it.  This will be the way I make strawberry daiquiris from now on!  No more of that nasty strawberry bottled mix.  Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good.  I added a few extra strawberries to it (I only had fresh ones) to bump up the flavour.  My husband loved them, he thought they were better than the canned version!

I used fresh strawberries....and tried the recommendation to blend up my sugar since I could not find my superfine sugar....i ended up adding confectioner's sugar...yummm!!!  Did not add the carbonated bev...the strawberries, rum and sugar were enough!  (I think I would have overflowed the blender if I had done so...)

I don't like beer or wine so my husband makes these for me!  We make them virgin for the kids, then add the rum at the end for the grown-ups. We always use some fresh and some frozen strawberries. I think he estimates the quantities according to taste, but does use this basic recipe every time.  We need to come up with another name for them, though, because the kids have started telling people about how they love drinking strawberry daiquiris!

We made this for a couples dinner party and everyone said it was the best they have ever had.  We added a bit more rum than called for, used fresh squeezed lemon and lime juice and superfine sugar.  The sour taste was great compared to your typical super sweet daquiri mix from the store.  We will certainly make this again and again!

This was perfect!  The only change I might recommend is to use crushed ice rather than cubes.  This took our Osterizer out for a ride, but the drinks were well worth the hassle!

Excellent recipe. Easy to prepare, I had to purchase a new blender, for a rookie like me. Can't wait for Summer and a big picture of Frozen Strawberry Daiquiris on the deck.

If you make this recipe you will probably find that it is a little too sour. Needs to cut back on the lemon and lime juice. Overall a fun drink to make.

These were awesome! I cut the recipe in half and finished these off all by myself! Sometimes I have a hard time making a blended drink taste as good as those I get at a restaurant. Not these, they were great!

So, the first time ever, I followed the recipe to the tee, and...not so good.  Way too much citrus favor, and not sweet enough.  I'm going to do it again, as I am on a quest to making the perfect daiquiri.  I didn't  read the reviews prior to making this, so I'll take some of the suggestions as well, and let you know hoe it comes out.

It is indeed the best strawberry daiquiri I've ever had! I used fresh strawberries, fresh lemon/lime juice and orange-flavored sparkling water ('cause I didn't have any lemon-lime soda) and a tiny bit of peppermint oil. Garnished with a spring of mint and a lime slice.

OMG and don't drink it too fast...I got two or three brain freezes before I slowed down! LOL

For those that want more of a strawberry flavor, omit lemon and lime juice and add some strawberry liqueur. (Don't use strawberry schnapps!)

Pretty delicious. This is the only daiquiri recipe I've ever made, so I don't have much to compare it too. I don't know if all of the ingredients are necessary, like both the lime and lemon juices. I've only ever made it with Captain Morgan, not Malibu. And I add significantly more rum than called for.

We used 1/2 Stevia and 1/2 sugar, didn't put in the lemon-lime soda, and used fresh strawberries.  Also we used less ice (mostly because our blender was maxed out). Yummy!

I used fresh strawberries and left out the lemon lime soda since I didn't have any and these turned out pretty good.  Next time I would use a little less ice and maybe more stawberries.  I also saw another recipe that used triple sec...  I think this is a fantastic basic recipe that you can tweak to your own liking.

My husband wanted something with frozen strawberries and white rum so I told him to look up daiquiris.  He ended up making this recipe scaled for 4.  I know he didn't measure the strawberries so he needed to add more liquid.  Instead of using lemon lime carbonated sode we used fresca and he ended up using the entire can.  It was wonderful!  We'll make it again, especially with the fresca.

I used key lime juice instead of lime juice to give it tartness.  Next time I'll cut back on the ice--it seemed to be too watery.  Not bad as written; but needs to be tweaked.  Even with my changes, something is till lacking, but I'm not exactly sure what...

Was absolutely great! I do suggest doing the 20 second thing in the blender with the sugar.  Just think how much money you save by making these yourself.

This was so good!  I omitted the lemon and lime juice because I thought that would make it too sour.  I used coconut flavored rum and that made it have a very "tropical" feel.  I will make many more batches of it this summer.

I followed the receipe and took the reviewer's advice to cut back just a little on the lemon and lime juice - these are the Best Strawberry Daiquiri's.  I used Barcardi's Rum and won't change a thing for the next batch.

Good recipe but a little too tart for me. I melted the sugar with the lime juice on top of my stove in a small saucepan took about 5 minutes, let it cool, while I was loading the other ingredients in blender. I used frozen berries which I let thaw, no soda.

Made with fresh squeezed juice and strawberries - delicious!  My husband and I enjoyed  thesse on a hot summer night - We forgot to  add the lemon-lime soda at first sip, took it to the next level when added.

I made this exactly as stated by the recipe. The lemon juice and lime juice were overpowering. The strawberry seemed to only provide coloring.  If you like a lemon lime daquiri then this is great.  I didn't not like this at all.

The consistency of the daquiri was perfect though. It wasn't too thick or too watery.

I think the fault was in me and not the recipe.  I only had frozen strawberries and quickly found that had to be defrosted before my blender would blend.  Then the strawberries  were the sourest I've ever tasted.  Going to try this again but with fresh strawberries.

I followed the recipe with the only change being use of coconut/pineapple seltzer water in place of the lemon/lime drink.  The drink was fabulous.  For the second batch I added a banana  to the strawberry and it was also delicious.  When I used the base recipe again I substituted the lemon with a freshly squeezed orange and still added the lime.  This recipe is very  versatile and all combinations I have made have been raved about by my party guests!

I had company from the U.K.  And  a gallon bag of fresh/frozen strawberries.  I made this cocktail for us in a flash.  He was so impressed with how good the drink is, he can't wait to go home and share the recipe.  I eye balled the measurements  and it was fine.

Next time I make this, I am going to increase the amount of strawberries to at least 5 ounces and I'm going to make a simple syrup with the lime juice, lemon juice and sugar to make sure the sugar is completely dissolved.  I blended it for quite a while last time and I still had sugar at the bottom of my glass.  I also left out the lemon-lime soda - it didn't seem right to add it - unless you are leaving out the rum, then I would add it in.  As far as taste, this was just as good as, if not better than any daiquiri I've ever ordered out... so good!

Main thing is, reverse the amount of frozen strawberris with ice, so it will actually have a strawberry flavor.  I used sweetened Roses Lime juice (and no lemon), and Agave syrup instead of sugar.  Delicious, and actually tastes like strawberry.  Oh, I used a whole cup of Rum! No soda...ugh!

I also made some changes... Definitely reduced the sugar by half! Love the lemon in addition to the lime, it adds another layer of tropical flavors! Yum. ??

Yum!!  Made these last night and everyone loved them.  Used fresh strawberries right from the field as that's what I had on hand.  Also didn't have lime juice but they were still terrific.

I used peaches instead of strawberries. No lime juice (out) but added spiced rum along with Bacardi. Yummy.

Grabbed the first recipe that popped up in a search for 'strawberry daquiri.' I used a combination of sweetened key lime juice concentrate and fresh-squeezed lemon juice with frozen strawberries and a splash of diet 7-Up added to the blender at the last moment.. It was the perfect consistency and flavor.. Just enough tartness to stand up to the sweetness of the strawberries & sugar. I am saving this recipe for future use, it's amazing!!

It was REALLY hard to make. It didn't say to crush the ice, and I like it with much more soda and lemon juice.

I thought this recipe was great! I've made it twice. The second time I only had about 2 cups of ice so I added more strawberry and it turned out great! I used lemon-lime seltzer water for the carbonated beverage and highly recommend it. My boyfriend thought that the sugar was too gritty the first time so we blended just the sugar and the liquids together first before adding the frozen ingredients

I made a smaller batch of these, and ended up doubling the amount of strawberries and rum, and using superfine sugar instead of table sugar.  Other than that, kept everything the same.  Really delicious!

Very tasty base, although we altered it to a point where some might say I ought not review... Anyhow, we made virgin daiquiris using a total of 1 cup of lemon lime soda, 1/3 cup of standard granulated sugar, 1/4 c of lime juice, 8 ounces of frozen strawberries and 4 1/2 cups of ice/ Great change of pace to accompany dinner.

The whole family loves this recipe!  We prepare it without alcohol so the kids can enjoy it as well, then add a little vodka (instead of rum) to our individual adult glasses.  We've tried many other recipes lately, but keep coming back to this one!

Used 1/2 the recipe and replaced fresh strawberries for a whole banana. Amazing. Hint: Bananas are best over ripe!
