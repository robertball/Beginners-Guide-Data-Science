Thank You Very Much. I will be having these with my family at home as well as at work...

This was awesome!  It was easy to make and a really nice flavor.  I took it easy on the spice in the marinade but only because my husband is not crazy about really hot food.  But I added a few drops on the shwarma itself, mmmmmmm   I did BBQ it and it turned out good.  I added a mix of chopped onion, cucumber, yellow bell pepper, grape tomatoes, and baby spinach.  Seasoned it with garlic powder, salt, and pepper.  This was a perfect summer meal that was easy to make!!

I found this very tasty.  Next time I make it I will not do it in Pita Bread, I am going to try it with veggies and potatoes or rice.   Very nice thank you Irene

These were really great. A tip for slicing the meat really thin: Freeze it first for at least 30 minutes. Makes it much easier.

This recipe for Schwarma was delicious. Not to spicey and so good that my whole family(include little brothers and sisters) were wishing I had made extra. The only change I made was I used home-made flat bread instead of Pita bread. This is a winner!

One adjustment...

I omitted the Mace.

And still...Man .. oh ... man is about all I have to say.  It was heavenly.  Just like back in the Middle East.

We really enjoyed this, it reminded my daughter of the stuff by the same name she had had in Spain, and she loved it. I think I would rather grill it (we'll try that next time as that's the way it was done in Spain), but this took little time overall and would make a great summer meal--light and pleasant on a hot night. It was not quite as spicy as I expected once cooked, we also sliced open the pitas into pockets, but we enjoyed the light flavor and the speed of cooking made it especially nice at the end of a busy day.

Enjoyed this recipe and I made as directed, except used 1/4 tsp. hot pepper sauce. Since the chicken is marinated so much in advance the meal is a snap to pull together after work. I added chopped red pepper and shredded lettuce to the pita along with the other veggies, and served with tzatziki.

great taste! I made my own pitas and made more of the "marinade" and used that for my base. Stuffed with lettuce on top and a drizzle of ranch. Delicious!

Great recipe.  Had with couscous, hummus, and salad.  Quite tasty.  We experimented using the Foreman grill to cook.  Figured it was easier to clean than the grilling racks.  Only took about 1.5 minutes to cook through on high.  Still a bit messy to clean up, but when something's that good, it's worth the extra scrubbing.
Will definitely use again!

Even better than anticipated.  I used nutmeg instead of mace and nonfat yogurt works well.  I also didn't have Pita bread so I used whole wheat soft taco size tortilla.  Very Good.  Thanks for the healthy recipe!

This meal had a very strange smell and taste.  Even the cooking stage smelled strange.  We ate it but something got lost in the translation.  We are very big fans of Middle Eastern food usually, but not this time.

I absolutely love this. I've had it with nothing but ranch dressing and then with all the toppings and it is just as good either way. Be sure to warm up the pita bread though, that's when it tastes especially good.

I thought these were amazing. My only gripe was that all of that chicken did not fit in one broiler pan, so the dinner that I thought would be on the table in under 10 minutes wound up taking me more than half an hour because I had to work in batches. Still, these had amazing flavor and we both ate way too much.

This was a very easy, tasty recipe to make.  Instead of broiling the meat, I grilled/stir fried it in the marinade, and it turned out very tender.  I also allowed my guests to build their own schwarma with additional condiments such as hummus, feta cheese, and olives.  All in all it was a successful, simple meal.

Marinating overnight then broiling the meat was messy and time consuming, and it was bland after all that. Won't use this recipe again.

Easy to make and very tasty. Even my son, who only likes food from a box, thought this was good. Used chicken this time, need to find some lamb for next time.

This was pretty darn good! I only marinated it for a few hours, but it still had good flavor. We cooked the breasts whole on the outdoor grill and the sliced then up. Served with thinly sliced pickles and homeade tahini sauce. Yum!

Looking for a recipe reminiscent of the Turkish street food I ate in Russia. I added shredded cabbage, fried potatoes and drizzled hot sauce (siracha)  over the contents.  Not quite what I was going for but it sure was good.

It was good as a base for a pita or a wrap so it did do what it was supposed to, but there was a weird smell while it cooked and it definitely needed way more spice or tang. I found it sweet in a way. I did omit the mace because I didn't have any so maybe that was why. Not sure if I'll make it again. but at least I can have sandwiches this week ....i guess

Schwarma Haiku: "This was a neat meal. Fun to decorate pita! Subtle marinade." Wish that I'd been able to marinate overnight (it was more like 6 hrs. for mine) and I also wish that I had a proper broiler pan (improvised w/ foil.) The one thing that was beyond difficult was flipping the chicken half-way thru the 5 min. broil when it was "thinly-sliced" - maybe I shouldn't have cut SO many thinly-sliced slices, but I just couldn't flip them all, and ended up getting more frustrated (and all of us ready to chow down!) than anything else. But as far as taste and presentation goes, it was really fun to stuff the pitas w/ the cucumber, onion, tomatoes and chicken, and drizzle in Ranch. I think I'd like to try the marinade on just chicken breast next time, and put on the grill.
