I liked this but my family did not. Sprinkled with pwrd sugar instead of serving with syrup (post pic). Also, baked on a pizza stone instead of a cast iron skillet.

It is a very tasteful recipe - I really enjoyed it! What I liked most, though, was that it doesn't need pancake mix, which is something I can't easily find in my country..
You should try it!

This is a delicious recipe, though we use milk instead of cream.
Try topping with powdered sugar and lemon instead of maple syrup.  YUM!

I tested this recipe 4 months ago and now I am forced to fix this pancake for my family weekly!  It is so easy, much easier than conventional pancakes since it's all done in the cast iron skillet.  And it's even BETTER the next day.  I always serve it with frozen blueberries warmed in syrup.  It is the BEST!

This was a very good and easy recipie....the only reason I'm giving it three stars is because what made it a five star recipie in my home was the buttermilk sauce I made to go with it that's listed in the German Pancake and Buttermilk Sauce recipie a few recipies up......they're AMAZING togehter!!!!!! My two year old and his 5 year old cousin had seconds and even thirds a hour or so later! YUM!!!!!

My whole family really liked this.  I made the buttermilk syrup that I saw someone else post about in another review.  It is more of a custard than a pancake though.  The pan size might have alot to do with that.  If it were thinner it would be more pancake like.  Mine ended up about 1.5 inches thick.  I used a 3 quart frying pan.

AWESOME. Bf said it was the best meal I've ever made him. I'm with the other reviewers - the bechamel sauce mentioned in other reviews is a must! It completely makes the dish.

HMMM, I'm not sure but maybe I did something wrong.  I thought it was alright but my son who does not like eggs did not care for it.  It had a strong egg taste.  It also did not look anything like the picture.  Mine was very smooth on the surface.  I  had baked it double the time and it came out the consistency of custard in the middle and with the edges a little thicker.  After rereading the recipe I did find I did not follow the instructions,I mixed the liquids together first then poured the flour mix into it rather than the other way around.  I will definitely have to try this again So I can give it a better rating, because I just can't stand screwing up a recipe and I don't think it's a bad recipe.

Mine didn't puff in the middle, but did nicely around the edges and uniformly in the middle. This recipe is AWESOME. My kids wolfed it down (they're 2 and 3). Definitely great in a cast iron skillet!  UPDATE: I've made this recipe several times now and have found it works well with just milk (2 c. milk, no cream) and especially with canned milk. It's amazing, even in a pinch!

This is like one, huge popover!  Although mine didn't rise in the middle.  Only the outsides did.  I will try 1/2 as much butter next time because it was "floating" in the middle.  Also, I used sea salt instead of table salt, I don't know if that would make a difference?  Still, it's very good!

We ate this pancake with maple syrup, and it was great. It is so plain, however, that it can be dressed up any way you like. We will consider using strawberries and cream, peaches with sour cream and nutmeg, or jam or marmelade with sour cream or clotted cream. This is definitely a keeper for us.

This was a hit with my day care kids, and a great source of protein. Best of all it was soooo easy.  I think this would be great for my family because you can all be served at the same time. And there does not have to be a poor sole at the frying pan flipping pancakes.  I didn't have cream so used milk and it was still very good.

My husband really liked this, but I didn't. I think I prefer a more traditional, fluffy-on-the-inside pancake. I took other reviewers' suggestions and made the Buttermilk Sauce from the "German Pancake with Buttermilk Sauce" recipe to go with this, and while that was outstanding, I will not make this particular pancake again. I will keep searching for a 1-pan pancake, but thanks for the experience--I had not cooked a pancake in quite that method before :)

First if you are thinking buttermilk pancake you will be disappointed. This is a custard type pancake. I followed the recipe since this was the first time I made it and will probably follow other reviewers suggestions to skip the heavy cream and use milk. If you have a really good pan you won't need all the butter. Mine never puffed up very high in the middle and I had to cook it an extra 5 minutes, but it still turned out great. I had homemade blueberry syrup, but this would also taste great with a savory topping. Since you also have to cool it it will take at least an hour from start to finish. The recipe says to stir until smooth, but to get that I had to whisk it and not use a spoon to stir. I will use this again and can't wait to try a different type of topping.

Pretty close to being a Yorkshire Pudding. Probably lends itself more to being accompanied by something savoury rather than something sweet.

Delicious! My kids loved these with maple syrup.  I thought they were even better with homemade apple butter.  Didn't have cream so I used milk and they still turned out great!  I love the custard consistency!

This has a more chewy/gooey texture because of the eggs to flour ratio, but I loved it.  I topped it off with a strawberry and powder sugar topping.  This would be great to make for company.

I used light cream instead of heavy and added a little fresh-grated nutmeg into the batter.  It was so delicious and easy to make.  My kids loved it.  I served it with powdered sugar and fresh fruit.

This works great, but agree with readers that have substituted part (or all) of the cream.  Might as well cut out a few fat calories if it will still work just as well and taste great.  I would also advise, as others have, to add a teaspoon of vanilla and a little grating of fresh nutmeg.  Those flavors always enhance and enliven any kind of baked breakfast thing like this.  I don't know why anyone would make this expecting it to turn out like a regular pancake and complain about the recipe when it doesn't.  It is obviously more of a dutch baby style pancake and it SHOULD have a custardy interior.

....at first I thought that this wasn't all that impressive...now that I'm back probably for the 7th or 8th time to remake this pancake I guess I'm sold. I now crave this poofy egg goodness.

I made this recipe first exactly as printed. (You really shouldn't review a recipe unless you have made it as written.) I thought it was very good. The next time I made it with just milk instead of milk and cream. I thought it was just as good, if not better, without the cream. I have also been adding extra flour, about 1/4 to 1/3 cup. I think it makes for better texture. Try topping this with lemon and powdered sugar like a German Pancake.

Excellent baked pancake. I have never made one before, so I cannot compare. But, I have made a lot of pancakes from recipes where they come out flavorless and dry. This pancake is wonderful, moist (custard-like) and full of flavor. The 6 serving recipe can actually be cut into 8 servings. One was enough for me, while my husband ate two slices. I had mine with organic 100% pure maple syrup and it was divine. The center did not puff up when cooking (or I missed it), but the sides did. So, I took it out of the oven when I saw the sides drop a little. It worked out just fine. Delicious! I will make these again.

Only 4 stars cuz the recipe writers didn't think important to specify skillet size! After pouring into my prepped 9" cast iron skillet, it was too late to turn back. Took an hour to bake but still turned out delisheous! I sprinkled with powdered sugar instead of using syrup. Custard like inside and it did cook through but more cake like in appearance than a pancake-- Use a larger skillet my friends!

I substituted gluten-free flour for regular flour and plain yogurt for the cream.  It worked beautifully! It is really delicious.

This recipe is delicious.  Instead of syrup, I warmed apple pie filling to go on top and sprinkled it with cinnamon sugar.

My family made this the other day for a quick brunch, and the general consensus was that we'll definitely make it again! We served it with whipped cream, and that was certainly the preferred topping. We used medium size cast-iron skillets, but had to up the bake time to 45 minutes. I think next time I'll try adding some lemon juice/zest to it, to give it a boost in tang. :)

My family and I love this for breakfast.  It is easy to make.  I add 1-2 tbsp. of almond or lemon extract for a little extra flavor and I double the recipe and cook it in the same size cast iron skillet.  It makes for a thicker pancake which is more filling and still tastes delicious.

Made this for my inlaws. They all really liked it. I was okay about it...thin crispy edged pancakes are more my speed. If I make it again, which I might just cause it is something different, then I think next time I'll add some cinnamon to the batter, and maybe top it with powdered sugar as others suggested (with more cinnamon!) or another sauce as recommended by others instead of syrup. I think that might tip me more in its favor instead of comparing it with regular pancakes!

I didn't think my kids would go for this due to the custard-y texture but they each gobbled down two wedges, and that's saying something since they're all still five and under!  Glad the hubby was already gone for work, because between me and my 3 oldest boys we ate the whole thing. :)  Baby sat on my lap and longingly wished he was big enough for solids.  'Nuff said.

This was good.  Made as written except added a tsp of vanilla and cooked it in an oven proof pan- not a cast iron skillet.  Middle puffed up about 15 minutes in and was cooked thru about 10 minutes early.  I did not need the butter in the pan.  Tasted like a giant crepe.

With the buttermilk syrup everyone recommended, this was awesome! It's really just like a custard almost and it was soooo soft. Surprised by how salty it was with how little salt there was though.

Super easy! All 7 kids and my husband loved it. Was enough for one large cast iron skillet or 10 pie slice sizes. They all begged for more. We had other breakfast sides to have breakfast be more filling. Totally will make this again. Thank you for the recipe. ( Oh- also I added one teaspoon of vanilla )

It needed a few more minutes in the oven, but the flavor was delicious and reminded me of a similar dish I ate as a child living in Vienna.

This turned out great! I used a cast iron fry pan & thought it was coming out of the thing until it “set” and shrunk back into the thing! This was very tasty; the pleasant surprise was the “custardy” texture. Thought this would be a strong breakfast option for guest or a weekend breakfast/“brunch-y” thing for just the 2 of us with coffee on the deck...I think the only change was adding vanilla flavoring concentrate...

I added 1/2 tsp vanilla and still found the taste a little bland. I agree with others, this would be awesome with fresh fruit, or compote, or even bacon!

I loved these Austrian Pancakes. They have a pancake flavor and almost like a omelet flavor as well. It was really easy to make and tasted delicious. I put powdered sugar, whipped cream, and cinnamon on mine and that made it even better. I'd definitely make it again!

I have never made this style of pancake before.  This was easy and fun to make.  I cooked this about 7 minutes longer than recipe instructions.  These would be best served with fresh fruit.  They are a bit heavy but really good.  I will make them again.   Thanks for the recipe!

A keeper! used 1T sugar (can use 2T in future), 4 little farm eggs, 1C fat free milk & 1C heavy cream, abt ½ tsp vanilla (will up to 1+ tsp), 1T butter in cast iron pan (will use 2T in future to keep from sticking). Used blender stick to really smooth it out. Cooked for 30  min (ate half which was great also), but went back in for 10 more min & then let set for 5-10 min before serving. Overall, raised perfectly, bubbled a little & then settled down. Excellent. No eggy taste, just pancake with "custardy" body. Will be trying leftovers soon.
