Good.  I think next time I will dust the tofu in cornstarch before frying.

I would have given this a 4.5 if it were possible.  Wasn't able to find lemongrass so had to substitute cilantro which did a fine job but maybe not stellar.  Made the recipe exactly as written otherwise and loved the delicate blend of flavors for our plant based/gluten free palates.  I think we enjoyed it especially because it was a crisp fall evening, just right for a pot of lovely soup.  One more treat were the colors in our bowls.  Wish I would have taken a picture.  We both ate seconds and that speaks for itself.

This was delicious.. my only change was not chopping up the lemon grass. I cut it into chunks and slit open one side to infuse the flavor... I cant handle the pithiness of lemon grass but I like the taste.  I did find this a little on the sweet side so I added a shake of red pepper flakes
