This was pleasantly delicious and soothing. At first it did not seem to appetizing but I was glad I made it. I do not have a cold but was looking for something soothing.  I scaled the recipe back to serve 1, and as suggested I used 1 tablespoon of honey and fresh finenely grated ginger. I did not strain the mixture. Definitely will be making this again. Thank you!

I did not add the cinnamon. This not only taste delicious, but soothes a sore throat.

I like it a lot. I added a tad more fresh, grated ginger root and more fresh lemon juice. Its going to be our new winter and fall drink. We will even try the fresh orange juice and probably ice it in the hot summer and spring months.

I doubled the recipe but not the honey (I used raw). To me it tastes like a hot cider w/o the apples.  I have a cold so this is the yummiest way to lick it.  Highly recommended.
