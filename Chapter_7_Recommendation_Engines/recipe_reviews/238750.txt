I used this as a filling for stuffed red bell peppers and it was amazing.

I had a lot of sweet potatoes and searched for an easy, healthy recipe for dinner--this came up.  I used 2 cans of enchilada sauce from the pantry and cooked dried black beans instead of using canned, but did everything else according to the recipe. These turned out SO good!  My children are usually iffy on sweet potatoes, but they really liked them in this dish.  I will be making this again!

I cooked it for my family, and everyone loved it! This will definitely become a "regular" in my house. It is a great Mexican dish to make!

It was a hit in my house, though not extraordinary enough for a 5 star rating. Really good, no complaints, will make again!

We used corn tortillas rather than flour. It was delicious. We will make this again.

LOVED IT!! So easy to make!! The only part that took a bit longer than I expected was removing the seeds in the peppers but everything else was easy! The seasoning was delicious!!
