This recipe was so delicious and smooth! The longer it sits, the better the flavor. Who the heck can let it sit though? Cheers!

Wonderful recipe.  However, it needs to be noted that Everclear grain alcohol (or Clear Springs, whatever brand) is NOT 151 proof.  Grain alcohol is 190 proof.  Don't waste your time searching for 151.

I hollowed the recipe to a t and I put a jar in the freezer and froze solid, was not expecting that. I also put apple slices in it. Apples got dark looking after a month. Taste kind of got worse after that. Besides that a great recipe. Next time I'll do unpasteurized cider and possibly more everclear.

I have made this recipe once as directed, once with modifications. If making standard recipe size (75 servings), I would recommend only 3 cups of sugar and five cinnamon sticks, as the cinnamon-sugar flavor is a little overpowering in the original. the liquor content is spot on. I am a heavy drinker and it often takes tons of (straight) rum to get me drunk. just 1-2 servings of this will get you DRUNK. if you are sensitive to the taste of alcohol, no worries. If you make this properly, you will not taste the alcohol at all. amazing recipe and a total hit at my Christmas parties! thank you!!

I cut the sugar in half and it was still too sweet. I will consider adding less sugar next time.  Overall great fall drink!

Cut back on white sugar to 1 cup and brown sugar to 1/4 cup. Still sweet but not too sweet. Makes it good to drink.
