I have made this recipe several times altering different aspects each time and to me this is the best cookie recipe ever. The changes I made were 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter instead of 1 cup butter, 3 cups flour and 5 cups oatmeal, not 4 and 4, 4 teaspoons of vanila instead of 2, 3/4 cup of the candy not 1 cup and add 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Also these cookies bake up best when they are large. I roll the cookie dough into a ball slightly larger than a golf ball. If you try to make smaller cookies you end up with a lot of the candy and chocolate chips on the outside of the cookie not baked inside. I always make the full recipe and freeze most of them. These are delicious fresh but tend to stale quickly. I freeze any cookies that won't be eaten in 3-4 days. They defrost quickly and taste as though they were baked that day

These were awesome! I made a half batch which was just right.  I substituted peanut butter for the butter and made sure to have lots of M&M's.  I used my hands to press dough into balls and baked just 10 minutes.  They were chewy and stayed fresh.  My new favorite!

WHO would actually complain to your face about your cookies???  

This recipe is the best!  I make this not only for my family, but for church functions, friends, etc.  This makes a huge batch of delicious cookies.  The texture from the oatmeal, chocolate chips, and M & M's (which is what I use) is perfect.  These cookies turn out perfect every time I bake them. I attribute this to the stoneware which I use to bake cookies.  I also use real butter in place of the margarine.  (Cookies without REAL butter just taste blah, in my opinion.)  I have had many requests for this recipe.  Thanks Linda!

These are some of the best cookies I have ever eaten!!! I read previous reviews and here's how I adjusted mine. Baked at 325 for 13-14 minutes, no burning. Instead of maragine I added an additional 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of peanut butter. Next time I may change to add a little more peanut butter, because I like the taste of peanut butter, it was not overpowering though. Since I made this for bake sale I used red and blue M&M's for the candy. I also sprinkled red, white and blue sprinkles on top before baking. They looked so festive. BEWARE this recipe makes a ton of cookies I ended up with like 9 dozen, you may want to half the recipe.

These are FABULOUS!  I substituted equal amounts of peanut butter for margarine, but I'm sure just butter would be wonderful as well.  I used the pampered chef large scoop for the size and patted them down just a bit before baking...perfect!  I didn't grease the cookie sheets because I used one of those Tupperware silicone wonder mats, worked great.  I can't say enough about these cookies, I've been searching for the "staple" monster cookie recipe and quite pleased this is it!  Thanks for posting it!

These are a very good cookie; a pleasant change from the usual choc chip.  I followed the recipe as is, but next time I will increase the amount of M&M's and use mini choc chips as opposed to regular.  My first batch was rather thin, so the following batches I increases the cookie size in hopes of having a chewier cookie.  Looks good so far, but they aren't totally cool yet so they may still fall.

My husband came home from work raving about Monster cookies that another wife sent in.  So, I figured I needed to try them.  They are pretty good and easy to make.  A really nice change from plain chocolate chip cookies.  They are huge though.

"I made these today for Valentine's day
for my Sunday school class and my own kids.
I used 3 cups of holiday candy pieces and
1 cup of chocolate chips.  Like the preceeding
review, I didn't use margarine, I used 1/2 cup
butter and 1/2 cup peanut butter instead.
Shaped into 2 inch balls or larger, and placed a 
giant craft stick in the center of the balls. I 
than flattened slightly with a fork.  I did bake
them for 14 minutes, because I think everyones
ovens are different. After cookies are cooled wrap in holiday goodie bags.  These were the best
monster cookies ever.  Thanks they were a big
hit!"

Great cookies.  Makes a ton of cookies.  40 giant ones!  I used 2 1/2 sticks butter and 1 cup of peanut butter instead of margarine(next I will try with all butter).  Also I dropped by 1/4 cupfuls onto ungreased cookie sheets and baked at 325 for 15-16 minutes and they were perfect. Larger cookies like these need to be kept in airtight container.  Mine didn't go hard.   Very delicious and full of so many great flavors with crunch on edges and soft in the middle(overcook and they will be hard in the middle- that's why take out at 15 minutes).  Can't wait to try and add some coconut or maybe some milk chocolate and semi sweet mix next!  I used old fashioned oats but next time I will either blend them first or use the quick  cook ones-because they were a little crunchy in the cookie.  Good share-THANKS.

Great recipe.  I made about five batches of these for the school bake sale.  I changed just a few things.  I used 2 cups of butter instead of 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of margarine.  I measured out the oats then ran them through the blender before mixing in.  I used 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips, 1 cup of milk chocolate chips, and one cup of M&Ms.  I set the oven for 325 degrees instead of 350.  I measured out about 1/4 cup of batter, rolled it into a ball, then pressed it down a little bit on the cookie sheet.  I left them in the oven for about 16 minutes.  The cookies turn out to be about 4 inches across.

These are my most favorite cookies! I made them first about a month ago, and have since made them several times! They're great! After reading through most of the reviews, I made the following changes: I used 1.5 cups of peanut butter, .5 cup of butter, .5 cup of margarine, and 3 cups of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar. Also, I use between 2 and 3 cups of oatmeal (instead of 4) and break it down real good in the food processor. They are the perfect blend between chocolate chip and peanut butter cookies! Everyone who's had them likes them and asks for the recipe! The last batch I made, I ended up doubling because I got mixed up with the salt, so I made giant cookies and gave them to neighbors. To do this, roll balls that are 3-4 inches big, and flatten them slightly with your hand before baking. Again, these cookies are fabulous! Try them, you won't be disappointed!

I quadruple checked the recipe to make sure I wasn't missing anything...because the dough was so dry.  I've never seen anything like it...it was like raking through sand.  That's even after adding peanut butter to the recipe which should help hold the mix together.  When baking, they didn't spread like cookies should...couldn't even tell that they were baking unless I checked the bottom.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the peanut butter, which should have been an aide instead of a hinder...had to add a few tablespoons of water to get a better consistency.  Everyone loved the taste though...I'm still teetering in the middle over this recipe.

I made the same changes that many others did: instead of margarine, add another 1/2 cup of butter onto the 1 cup already listed (for a total of 1.5 cups of butter) and 1 cup of peanut butter.  These came out awesome!  Everyone loved them, and it does make a TON of cookies!

These turned out really good.  A great way to spend time with your kids or grandchildren. Though the dough was a little sticky, we let sit in fridge for about an hour before putting on  baking sheets and baking.  Yummy!

I make cookies at least once a week, so I've tried A LOT of recipes.  This one was so tasty, easily one of my very favorites.  I didn't alter the recipe at all, and they turned out wonderful.  I did chill the dough before cooking.  I made them a week ahead of a wedding shower, froze them, and they tasted awesome a week later.  Just like I had made them  earlier that day.  It makes a LARGE batch of cookies.  If you aren't making for a big event, you may want to half the recipe.

Luckily my boyfriend and his friend eat anything, but in my eyes, they are not up to par. I have been baking for years and years and have made monster cookies before that were pretty good. I thought I'd try this new recipe for something different, and I will never make this again. I would not put margarine again, and put maybe 1 tsp of baking soda to 2 tsp of baking powder. They were so flat and never set. Monster cookies are to have a larger circumference as well as height.  Not making this again. I was absolutely embarassed that these turned out so terrible.

Great cookies, but in the grand tradition of allrecipes, I altered them somewhat.  The only monster cookies I've ever had, had peanut butter in them, so I added 1.5 cups p.b., omitting margarine, used butter flavored shortening instead of butter (I like soft and chewy), used 3 cups of b. sugar and 1 cup w. sugar, and finally mini chocolate chips and mini M&Ms-2 cups.  These were some serious cookies-very tasty.

YUM!!! These are awesome cookies... big and chewy and delicious. I did use peanut butter in place of the margarine and it added a great flavor. I also doubled the vanilla. Nobody can turn these cookies down! Thanks!

Super Yummy!  I was looking for a monster cookie recipe that didn't contain peanut butter so my daughter could take them to school in her lunch.  I halfed the recipe and used butter in place of the margarine.  I made the cookies large and baked them for 12 minutes @ 350.

Pretty good cookie. I baked at a lower temperature, so the cookie would spread out and bake the way I prefer it. I also used a 1/4 cup measuring cup to scoop out the dough and I rolled in into balls and dropped on the sheet for a larger cookie.

I never thought I would be one of "those"..that rate a recipe based on changes I made.  HOWEVER, I did read several reviews on this recipe and decided that I love peanut butter so much I had to try it in this cookie.  I used 1/2 cup of p.b. instead of 1/2 cup of the butter.  Next time I will do a full cup, but this recipe turned out awesome!  I have only tried monster cookies once, and they spread all over the pan and weren't like cookies at all.  This turned out super!

I made these once now every time my kids have a youth event, I'm asked to bring a batch.  People who don't like oatmeal cookies are always surprised when that ask about what is in them.  Thanks for giving me a fool proof recipe that makes lots of big cookies.

I made these for my stagecraft class as a post exam treat last semester. They were such a huge hit that I'm doing it again (it's a traditon now).  Everyone loves these cookies. one boy ate 6.

Very yummy cookies!  The only change I made was that I used all butter instead of margarine.  They turned out perfect, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Next time I might try adding peanut butter to replace some of the margarine/butter as other reviewers have suggested--but these were delicious as is.  Thanks Linda!

Absolutely spectacular cookies.  I also bumped the heat down to 325 and cooked for a little bit longer.

My experience: do NOT use margarine!  I am normally a big fan of margarine in cooking, but it makes these drier and not as creamy.  Only salted butter will do if you want these to be the best.

WONDERFUL...I used 2 sticks of butter instead of margarine (just because that is what I had on hand).  I will make these again and again!

This is really a 4.5 star recipe for me.  I have made these twice. Both times I halved the recipe and substituted peanut butter for the margarine. The first time I added some extra m and m's, but it was hard to get them all worked into the dough. I had some left at the bottom of the bowl. The dough is very thick. I "worked-in" my candies and chips this second time. I also used white choc. chips this time, but prefer the regular semi-sweet, maybe because they go better with peanut butter. Definitely take these out before they brown if you like chewy cookies. I shaped my cookies to be slightly larger than golf balls, and gently pressed them down. I get about 30 out of half the recipe making them this size.

The only real change I made was to use shortening instead of margarine.  Like others have said, margarine just didn't seem 'right'.  I also halved the recipe and I still ended up with a ton.  I used mini M&M as well.  In my opinion, these cookies are fabulous!  Nice a chewy the way a good cookie is meant to be (in my books at least).  I will be making this one again.  I may try substituting half the chocolate chips for peanut butter chips, or using peanut butter as others have said.  Either way, these cookies are good just the way they are.

I have made these several times, as they are very popular with my kids.  I always cut the recipe in half, and still get plenty of cookies.  I also only use butter.  These are very easy, and come out great every time!

These are not monster cookies.  I would call them oatmeal chocolate chip cookies.  And, I'm not impressed.  Mine turned out crunchy and blah.  I should have stuck with my go to recipe instead of trying something new.

I am giving this 5 stars because my husband and son say they are great.  I do not eat cookies but they smelled and looked good!  I did substitute the 1 cup margarine for 1 cup peanut butter per other recommendations.  I felt they were a little hard to mix up and actually used my hands to "knead" in the chips and candies.  They did keep their shape when baked and are not too hard or crispy.

These cookies are an absolute hit every time I make them!  Instead of 2 cups chocolate chips, I usually use 1 cup choc. chips, 1 cup cornflakes or chex-- gives them an extra crunch.  The recipe makes a TON of cookies though... you might want to reduce the # of servings, or freeze part of the dough.

I cut this recipe in half and it's a good thing I did because just half a batch made a TON. I made a few changes, just for what we like in our home. I doubled the vanilla, used half chopped pecans and cashews in place of half of the oatmeal, ground the oatmeal down in my blender for a smoother consistancy and upped the amount of M&M's. (I only had dark chocolate peanut M&M's, so I used those. A whole family sized bag, that is.) I also added half a package of Reese's peanut butter chips just to use it up. I used my #40 cookie scoop to make uniform cookies. 350* for 11 minutes was about right for these. Very good. Note: This gets knocked down to three stars because they dry out so bad and get stale. Wasted ingredients is no fun.

The only change I made was cutting the recipe in half and these cookies were very gooey when done, the middle was almost uncooked...I left them in a bit longer the second time and they were too hard....would not make again.

These cookies tasted good, but they were flat and spread out all over the cookie sheet. It seems to me that the recipe calls for an excessive amount of shortening (I have never heard of using both butter AND margarine), which may be the cause.

I am the poster of the recipe.  I am so pleased to see that so many people have enjoyed this recipe.  I realized that in my description I forgot to mention I got the recipe from a restaurant I used to work at.  That is why it makes such a large batch.  I actually half the recipe when I make it too!  At the restaurant we would bake a whole batch, fill the cookie container and freeze the rest.  Then pull out cookies as needed.  They really do taste chewy after they thaw out, but are even better if you microwave them for a few seconds.  At the restaurant I used to send my through the bun toaster and then top with vanilla ice cream.  Delicious!  Makes a great cookie sundae.

Amazing!!! These are like the huge store bought cookies or the kind  you might get from Panera and other popular restaurants.  Keep in mind that they do not spread so pat them out to the size  you want them to be before baking.

These are absolutely the best cookies...EVER!!  My kids, their friends, my husband, his friends, church...everyone asks me to make these cookies.  Sometimes I make them REALLY big and wrap them individually for my kids soccer and basketball games when I am to bring the snack!  I am making a smaller batch now for church.  They work well for really any occasion and they ALWAYS get gobbled up!!

I have lost count of the number of times I have baked these awesome cookies!  I love the fact that there is no peanut butter in them so they are "school friendly".  We have made them for bake sales, and people rave about them.  My kids even made some for their teachers this year for Christmas (our teachers accept homemade treats) and they loved them.  I don't make any changes to the recipe other than I don't bake them for the full 10-11 minutes.  Usually 8 minutes or so.  Our family likes cookies on the chewier side, so I watch them closely as not to overbake them!

I really liked these cookies. I went with some suggestions and substituted the margarine with peanut butter, otherwise I left the recipe the same. It gave it a hint of PB without being overpowering. My family gobbled them up! Cookies like these are why I don't bake anymore unless I'm baking for church or something. I couldn't stop at just one!!

I have finally found 'MY' cookie recipe!  Delish!  This makes alot but is so easy to throw together because it is the perfect sized batch to fit in my big Kitchen Aid. And with no peanut butter or nuts it is ok for school lunches.  I am taking some to 4H later on this afternoon.

This is my favorite cookie recipe!  I've been making it for about 6 yrs. and I always get rave reviews.  I substitute peanut butter for the margarine and make 1/2 recipe.  I use the med. Pampered Chef scoop (about 2 T.) for each cookie and bake for 11 min.

This was ALMOST 5 stars, because I think all monster cookies should have peanut butter! I followed the recipe and added a 1/2 cup of peanut butter when creaming the sugar, butter and eggs. They turned out fantastic, but I did have to bake them about 11 minutes to get chewy cookies. yum!

these were okay.  Alot of ingredients for what turned out to be an average cookie.  Be careful to pull out before they actually look done, or they will harden.  Also, this recipe makes ALOT, even when halfed

Excellent.  Crispy on the outside, soft inside.  Baked at 300 for 13 minutes in convection oven.  Used 2 c chocolate chips, all whole wheat flour, and didn't have enough rolled oats, so used oat bran to round up the measurement (2 c quick oats, 2c oat bran).  Didn't have enough brown sugar, used all white sugar.  Great aroma.  Thanks for the recipe.

These are sooo good!  You can add anything into this batter and they're still delicious (raisins, pnuts, walnuts, etc)  I've never made a combination that wasn't delicious!  They freeze really well, too... just pop them in a freezer bag so you don't have to worry about them getting stale.  You can eat them frozen or pop them in the microwave for a few seconds.  Delicious!

These were a huge hit with my family and coworkers.  I used 2 other reviews: I made them golf ball sized and flattened them a tiny bit on the pan and baked for 14 minutes.  I also omitted the margarine and used 1/2 C more butter and 2 C Peanut Butter.  Delicious, beautiful cookies!!!

These were very good, and a great cookie for when you can't make up your mind between chocolate chip and "candy coated chocolate" cookies.  I used all butter and the first batch burned on the bottom.  I reduced the oven temperature to 325 degrees and the following batches were perfect.

I substituted peanut butter for the full amount of margarine.  Then, I flip-flopped the amounts for chocolate chips and M&M's, because who doesn't love M&M's?  Brought these to my bowling league night and they disappeared!  I also had requests for the recipe.  I had left some at home for my husband, who doesn't like sweets that much, and he ate them up quickly!  I would call this recipe a definite success!!

FABULOUS recipe.  Cookies are one of my favorite things to make, but this was my first attempt at Monster Cookies, and the family *loved* them. My husband asked me to make some for him to take to work next week so he can brag about them.  That's quite a vote of confidence.  They only variation I made was to use Butter Flavor Crisco instead of butter and margarine.  I use it for all my cookies; it's my "secret ingredient".  I also added a handful of chopped peanuts, just for a bit of texture and salt.  This is a keeper!

Great recipe!  Was asked to make cookies on short notice, so had to use what I had in the house.  I never have margarine, so I used all butter.  Didn't have any candy pieces, so used coconut and butterscotch chips along with the chocolate chips.  I also forgot to put in the salt.  Turned out great!!

This is a great recipe,  I changed a few things in it,  only because I wanted to, not because it needed it.  I replaced the cup of margarine with 3/4 cup natural peanut butter and 1/4 unsweetened apple sauce.  I ground almonds and used that as part of the rolled oats,  I also replaced the semi-sweet chocolate chips with white chocolate chips and added white raisins.  They are delish!!!!  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is great, I did make some changes due to personal preference, but I'm sure it's a keeper either way! I used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup margarine, and 1 cup creamy peanut butter. I also used 6 cups of oats and 2 cups of flour. My roommates couldn't get enough of them and they were gone by the next morning!

These are very good.  I believe I over mixed my butter/sugar mixture so they were rather flat, but still very delicious.

These are a very good cookie!  I dislike margarine so used all butter in these.  They came out chewy and the taste was good.  We will more than likely make again.

These cookies have become somewhat of a legend in my family the past few years, that's how great they are!  I make them for all special occasions, and as an amazing comfort food (feeling down? Eat these cookies and you'll perk right up, I swear!)

I use a lot less white sugar, about one cup instead of two (otherwise it's just way too sweet for me), and I like to add a bit more flour and oats, because I like my cookies more doughy and thick (the kind that look like little mountains, rather than the flat, gooey kind).  I also use butter rather than margarine, but that's a personal preference.

It's very easy to change this recipe to suit your tastes - less chocolate chips, more M&M's, Heath toffee pieces, walnuts, add cinnamon and maple extract for an autumn-themed cookie, or use peanut butter chips for a salty-sweet treat.  It's a huge recipe, but it easily halves or even quarters for smaller servings.

Needless to say, I absolutely adore this recipe and all the things I can do with it, thank you so much for putting it up! :D

Great recipe. I only gave four stars because I used peanut butter (chunky, because I like the texture it gives the cookies) instead of margarine. I think that is the only thing you need to change when making these cookies. But they are wonderful! I halved the recipe and used an ice cream scoop for the dough and still got 32 cookies.

These big cookies were a big hit at my most recent family gathering.  We had some left and discovered that the cookies (wrap individually in saran) freeze really well.  The recipe was much better with the following changes:  a) 1 1/4 c. peanut butter for the butter; 2) 2 c. m&m's & 1 1/2 c. chocolate chips; 3) added about 2/3 c. coconut; 4)doubled the vanilla; 5) used 1/3 cup scoop and flattened to bake.

My husband has been bugging me for weeks about monster cookies, so I decided to make some for him.  I followed the recipe with a few minor adjustments:  I omitted the margarine and added 1 1/2 cups of creamy peanut butter, I used mini semi-sweet chips and mini m&m's.  I also made the cookies big (about golf ball size).  When I put them on the baking pan, I patted them down a bit to ensure even cooking time.  This recipe made a large batch - even with the bigger size I still made 26 cookies!  My husband loves them - for sure will be making them again!!

I gave this 4-stars because I made my own revisions. I substituted peanut butter for the margarine and added only 3 cups versus the 4 cups of rolled oats. I also recommend not making them real big like some said. They spread out and if you make them with an icecream scoop it is a good size. I also baked at 325 versus 350 and found it cooked them more evenly. By making them real big I got 2 1/2 dozen versus the 6 stated. This is my new go-to monster cookie recipe. I may add raisins next time as well. What's not to love, you get 4 of your favorite cookies rolled into one!

First of all, I bake ALL the time. I made the recipe exactly as written and the first cookie sheet did not turn out at all, I actually had to scrape them off and ended up with a giant mound of cooked mess. I added more flour, and more baking powder and got a somewhat edible cookie with the rest of the batch, they still stuck some so the bottom of the cookies have hollow spots.  It feels like ALOT of people had to modify this recipe to get it into something they "loved". I will not be making these again. I'll just use another Monster cookie recipe from this site that doesn't require modifications.

I halved it, its a big recipe, and added coconut for a little more kick. Also, I didnt have enough oats so just added another cup of flour. Turned out great! Chewy in the center and crispy on the sides! A big hit at work.....  Thanks!

Had this recipe suggested by a friend and it was fantastic! We add 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon which adds a little zest. I shared these with my parents and sometimes when I come home the ingredients are waiting for me to use! Definitely a goodin!

These cookies are good but not what I am used to... as I was mixing the batter I realized there was no peanut butter in the recipe! So I added a half cup. I wanted to add more but I didn't want to alter the recipe too much out of fear they wouldn't bake right. They turned out okay but still didn't have enough peanut butter taste and ended up harder than I had hoped.

These were SO good!  I've never had monster cookies without peanut butter & I was very excited to find this recipe as I have a niece with a peanut allergy.  Thanks for posting this!

This is a huge recipe. I wanted about 1/2 so I used 1 1/2 cups of butter, 1/2 cup of peanut butter (instead of the butter / margarine the recipe called for) and then 1/2 of all of the other ingredients...and it still made dozens of cookies!

These are the BEST! I did make a couple of changes though...instead of using butter I replace it with an equal amount of peanut butter.  Also added a small amount of light of light corn syrup...maybe about 1 teaspoon or so.

I made these cookies with the following substitutions: I used all butter, no margarine.  I used mini chocolate chips and mini m&m's, to insure that each cookie had both. When I used regular chips and M&M's I received complaints that some cookies did not have chips or candy. I would suggest adding the chips and candy pieces to the wet batter, before you combine with the dry ingredients. The first time I made these, I followed the directions, and when I added the chips /candy, it was difficult to incorporate in to the batter.  It felt like I was trying to mix it in to  cement.  I also added cocoa nibs, insted of nuts, and it really enhanced the flavor. These were the best cookies I have ever made! My husband took them to work, and returned home with requests for the recipe. This is my new favorite cookie recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I didn't find these to be anything like a monster cookie.  I cooked them and they came out very thin, and stuck to the  pan.  The only thing I could really taste in them was the chocolate.

I made these cookies for a co-workers going away party and everyone loved them. I'm even getting requests for the recipe. I halved the recipe, which was more than enough and substituted 3/4 cup peanut butter for a 1/2 cup margarine, 3 cups of quick oats instead of 2, 1 cup of flour instead of 2 and I added an extra tsp of vanilla. I also used 1 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and 1 cup of mini candy-coated pieces instead of the half the recipe recommends. Upon recommendation, I rolled the dough into golf ball size balls and smashed them down into neat circles with a spoon, baking 6 at a time. The size was perfect and the cookies turned out AWESOME. I did end up with a couple left; be forwarned that after 4 days, the cookies will be stale, however I look forward to making this recipe again and freezing some for the holidays. Thanks!

These cookies were so good!  I did alter the recipe though...I halved it first off, and instead of butter subbed in peanut butter.  Also, I cut out about 1/2 cup of flour and put in extra rolled outs instead.  I added butterscotch chips in too, but wished I hadn't since they were the overpowering flavor (but still good!).  They came out huge (I used an ice cream scoop, and didn't press the dough down at all once on the sheet), chewy and great looking!

My husband doesn't like chocolate, so I made a couple of changes.  I replaced the 1/2 cup of margarine with 1/2 cup peanut butter. And I took out the chocolate chips and M&M's and used about a cup of Reeces Pieces instead. I followed a couple other reviewers in the cooking time--I baked them at 325 degrees for about 15 minutes and they were nicely browned but still soft and chewy inside. My husband took one bite and started saying how good they were! I halved the recipe and got a lot of cookies--12 JUMBO and about 15 regular/large size. This is my new favorite peanut butter cookie recipe! Thanks for sharing!

THESE COOKIES ARE EXCELLENT!
I was looking to make the same monster cookies you buy from Sobey's Bakery (IGA) and these have oatmeal, which I wasn't thrilled about at first... They are everyone's favourite... It makes 2 icecream pail's full and I've made them SEVERAL times -- Candy pieces-- Smarties are a must!!

After looking at MANY different recipes and reading lots of reviews for this one on this site; I used several of the other's suggestions and this is what I came up with.  I used 1 1/2 cups of peanut butter, 1 cup of butter, 2 3/4 cups of brown sugar, 3/4 cups of white sugar (this was plenty sweet for our taste). I increased vanilla to 2 Tbl. only used about 3 1/4 cup flour, increased the oatmeal to 5 cups and used half quick cooking and half regular.  I also followed another's suggestion and ran this through my mini food processor. I used 1 cup of mini chocolate chips and 1 cup of mini M&M pieces, 1 cup of chopped pecans and 1 cup of coconut. Made golf ball size rolls, flattened slightly and baked for 11 minutes at 350. These came out looking really nice, not dry, held their shape and tasted great! Soft and chewy.  I got 6 dozen out of my recipe with cookies about 3 inches across.  I have never eaten Monster Cookies but I liked the idea of them having peanut butter and I followed another's suggestion and made a few tweaks of my own.  That said, I still think they are a 5 star but since I made so many changes, I wasn't sure how to rate this.  I think you could really just "play with" this basic recipe.

I made a half batch of these cookies in case we didn't care for them.  I used the original recipe, thought I did find my dough quite wet so added more flour.  The cookies baked for about  14-15 minutes and came out beautiful and full.  They fell flat when they started to cool.  Once fully cool, I bagged them, and they promptly fell apart.  That said, they are delicious.  I made them for a harvest crew, and though they were chunks rather than cookies, the men raved about them!  Though I am disappointed they didn't stay together, I'd probably make them again.

I made this recipe with some crushed cereal in place of some flour, I milled the cereal and half the oats in the food processor to have a finer textured cookie.  Also used whole wheat flour and lots of 5 spice powder.  Used raisins and chocolate chips, which both taste great with the spices.  I replaced the egg with egg replacer powder and used all vegan margarine. The cookies turned out sooooo goood!  I was worried cause the dough was a little crumbly but they are nice and chewy soft.  hmmmm yum.  Try this one.  Would be great with peanut butter and coconut for a more authentic monster cookie.  Overall I think this is a great base recipe to improvise off of.  Thanks Linda!

I also halved this recipe, and made a few alterations.  I used 3/4 cup light butter, and added about 1/2 cup peanut butter.  I cut up lots of nuts and reduced the baking powder to 1/4 teaspoon.  Baked my cookies at 375 for 10-12 minutes.  My husband and kids loved them.

i'm guilty of not following the recipe exactly but instead the tips of others: bake at 325 degrees for 13 minutes, substitute peanut butter for margarine, halved the recipe (yield 4 dozen cookies!).  tasted great right out of the oven but they were solid rocks the next day.  there are much better recipes.

This recipe was great.  I didn't have the mini M & Ms so I substituted Skor bits and they turned out fantastic.  The cookies are not too sweet or buttery,just very yummy.  I have many recipes for chocolate chip cookies but this is my new favorite.  Try them!!!!

My girlfriend has begged me to never make these cookies again as she loved them SO much. I substituted the butter for peanut butter, added 1/3 cup coconut, 1 cup peanut butter chips, 1 cup chopped walnuts. Everything else I kept the same and our family raved about them.

I followed directions exactly and baked for 10 minutes but cookies didn't quite bake enough and were breaking apart.  Taste was great though so will make again and take others advice and mix in peanut butter and will bake a little longer.

these are the best cookies.  I always substitute some peanut butter for some of the butter/margarine.  Everyone who has tasted them, loves them.

We all LOVED these cookies.  I used 1 cup butter flavored shortening instead of margarine, added peanut butter, butterscotch chips, and chopped pecans (to accomodate the changes I cut the chocolate chip and chocolate piece amount in half.)  This was the second time making these cookies and they were just as wonderful with the additions as they were the first time.  I also took the advice of others and baked at 325 degrees on Silpats (instead of greased cookie sheets) for 14 min.  This recipie made seven dozen cookies.

We baked these the other day to treat the construction workers remodeling our basement; they were a huge hit!  The cookies that we took down quickly disappeared and not even a crumb was left behind.  The rest of my family enjoys these as well.

Maybe I'm just "picky".  Flavor was good, but it wasn't the outstanding cookie that I thought it would be.  I followed someone's advice and used all butter.  They didn't store real well as they were easy to crumble.  I would add more M&M's also, and maybe some other goodies.  The hunt is on for that extra special cookie though!

These did not turn out at all for me. It was a big crumbing mess that didn't form into a cookie and I threw the whole thing out. I was confident I mixed the right amounts so when I looked for a different recipe I noticed none of the other monster cookie recipes had flour. My second batch with no flour (from a different recipe) was perfect. Obviously lots of people had good results on this one but I'll stick with the no flour recipes.

These were yummy!  I added a cup of peanut butter chips too.  I also used what I had open and added a very full cup + of milk chocolate chips to a half cup of semi sweet chocolate chips.  I topped some of these with m&ms just to make them look better for the kids.  I used a small ice cream scooper so they were fairly large.    Many people love them!

I gave these 3 stars because they tasted really good, but like some other reviewers said the dough was really dense and dry and the cookies would not spread in the oven at all. I looked up some other recipes to compare ingredients and amounts, and this recipe looks to have too much flour/oats in it compared to the fat content. The only changes I made was to substitute peanut butter for the margarine ( I halved the recipe and used 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup peanut butter). There seems to be a lot of good reviews too, so I am not sure what they did differently to make the cookies come out right. Very good flavor though, I ate a fair amount of the cookie dough lol.

I love these cookies so much! They're always perfectly chewy, and I love a cookie with a respectable amount of oatmeal.  The chocolate/candy pieces can be subbed out for any kind of mix-in, I just did toffee and cashew and they turned out awesome as well!  
Thanks so much Linda, these are my go to cookie recipe!

So good!!! But I cut the recipe in half as I definitely did not need 70 cookies! When I cut it in half, I just took the margarine out completely and added just a cup of butter! I prefer to only bake with butter and they turned out incredible!! Definitely will bake these over and over again!!

My sister is the original poster of this recipe so I've eaten the cookies exactly as the recipe states and they are good. BUT, here's MY tweak on the recipe which I yields cookies that stay chewy for several days sealed in a freezer bag or container without getting stale. 

I never buy margarine because I like butter on everything. LOL So in place of margarine I used 1 Cup Butter Flavor Crisco. (This keeps them from going stale as fast as they would using all butter.) I also added 1 Cup of Jif Creamy Peanut Butter. That's it! Absolutely delicious! 

Unlike some reviewers, my kids & I think this recipe makes just the right amount, about 50 Large Cookies (using the medium sized Pampered Chef scoop, heaped with dough.) We ate a bunch hot from the oven. I froze 1/4 of the cookies in a freezer bag, but alas, we finished the rest in like 3 days and pulled out he frozen ones right away, not even allowing them to thaw.

I use a Kitchen Aid mixer and this dough fills up the bowl to within an inch from the top. Stirring in the candy & chips at the end is a bit challenging, but worth it. I like pecans or peanuts in cookies so Maybe next time I will do 1/2 a batch with nuts for the adults & 1/2 without nuts for the kids.

Super, super yummy! I made two batches. I did the first exactly as the recipe stated. They turned out marvelous. The second batch I wanted peanut butter so used 1/2 c margarine 1/2 c butter and 1 c crunchy peanut butter. Delish! Either way these were superb. I froze half of the dough in balls and when we want some

Was this supposed to be 1 cup PEANUT BUTTER (not butter)?  I didn't read through the recipe thoroughly and though there was supposed to be peanut butter included.  Found it to be a little bland without it.

A very good recipe. I also tweaked it by using one cup butter or margarine, 1/2 cup oil. Used the Cup of brown sugar and one cup splenda.Mixed 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon with the flour. Used the last bits of candy in the house, remnants of cheerios and cornflakes and gave a few gentle turns of the mixer. Turned out great! The original is a really good recipe tho, so try it first! Thank you!

They taste great. But they are so flat! And I've always known Monster cookies to have peanut butter. They are so flat, they break apart when you take them off the pan or pick them up. I'm adding a little more baking powder to see if that helps. Not sure if I would do this recipe again.

I stick pretty close to the original recipe, but I never use margarine so just substitute all butter instead. I love that the recipe doesn't have peanut butter as many monster cookies do! I like to send these for school treats and most schools no longer allow nuts in classrooms, so this version works perfect! I use a small Pampered Chef Cookie scoop and bake about 15-16 minutes. I also find mini-chips work best for me and use a blend of quick oats (which are more broken down) and rolled oats, along with M&M candies. They're always a hit!

These cookies were awesome!! They did not last very long in my home. Only change I'd make is adding more smarties, but that's just my preference!

I've made these cookies for years. They are probably my absolute favorite home baked cookie. We usually give some out as Christmas gifts. I think the flavor is amazing and I love them best 5 or 6 days later.

these cookies taste good but were a little bit flatter than I like them.  I'd add a bit more flour to thicken them up.

(I made these cookies for a bake sale.  I am known for my 'fabulous' cookies.  However, I got nothing but complaints about these cookies.) Old review!  ha, didn't know I had made these before....11 years later....
Made for another bake sale. Substituted shortening for margarine and following the shortening directions added 2 TB water.  I used this recipe as most monster cookie recipes have peanut butter & we have an allergy here. Also used white chocolate chips in place of 1/2 chocolate chip amount.  I use the medium cookie scoop and cooked a little longer...13 minutes. Delish!

This was a really good cookie. But I would of liked it to be fuller. So next time I would use peanut butter instead of butter and add more m & m's and smarties.

I took these to work and everyone LOVED them! I actually added more peanut butter and 1/2 cup of butterscotch chips too, just for fun. But a couple people asked for the recipe and they were definitely a hit!

These were really great! I did use peanut butter in place of butter and I found the mixture getting somewhat dry when mixing so I only used 3 cups flour and 3 cups oats. Very tasty and the kids love them!

These cookies were delicious! I only made half of the recipe and I followed MJSJSMITH's ideas, using 1/2 cup of peanut butter, 1/2 cup butter flavor shortening, 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar and a 1/2 cup of white sugar. I also used kosher salt,  bread flour instead of all purpose flour, and chocolate chunks instead of chocolate chips. The dough was a bit crumbly but the cookies came out great(crispy on the outside, soft and chewy in the inside). Wonderful cookies!!!

I could screw up the lords prayer when it comes to baking cookies but these were the best things I have ever baked hands down ! The recipe is huge so I scaled down to half.Subsituted the candy coated chocolate for raisins and baked at 325 instead of 350 about 14 minutes. Crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle ! Awesome !
