I made this for an office potluck - I just put the spread into the crockpot on low- once it was melted together I turned it down to warm and it was awesome!  I had slices of crusty bread for everyone to dip with.  The office loved it!!  I got 10 requests for the recipe that day.  Then I made it for a football party and even the men were raving about it!  I added about 1/3 envelope of Knorr vegetable soup mix to the recipe and added some more cheese :)  - for a little something extra.

I had this last week at a small party.  I couldn't stop eating them!!!  I found the recipe here and just made it for an informal dinner party and what a hit it was!!!!  And EASY!!!! It can't get any easier. I, also, used a bit of this and made stuffed mushrooms with it.  They were fabulous!

I can't stop making this recipe!  It is great. My husband loves the original recipe and I make my with added chopped tomatoes and mozzarella cheese instead of swiss.  Either way this is a keeper!! Next time I might even try adding some real bacon bits just for a different taste....

Love it!  Ok, so I told my hubby french bread, he heard texas toast.  I used it anyway and we were blown away.  I'm terrible with a broiler and burn everything so I decided to bake this at 400 and it was perfect.  The cheese melted and got a little toasty on top and the toast was browned on the bottom and the middle was nice and soft.  Really fab!

I was so excited to see this recipe!  I have been making these for parties for about 2 years. 
The one thing that REALLY makes special these though is to add diced bell pepper to the top before baking.  Dice the bell pepper VERY fine, and just sprinkle a few (maybe 4 or 5) pieces on the top of the little toasts (I use a skinny baguette loaf sliced up) before baking.  For a holiday party it is pretty to dice up red and green bell peppers!
I bake these in a 400 degree oven for about 10 or 15 minutes.  
The spread can be made ahead a couple of days and kept in the fridge.  I have also gone ahead and spread it on the bread slices, topped it with the peppers, and placed them all on a cookie sheet covered with plastic wrap in the fridge for a few hours.  Great make-ahead party snack!

I thought this was very good.  Mixed it all the night before and added about 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic to it.  We then assembled it the next day right before we baked it.  I would have liked a bit more cheese, but that could be my fault; I just eye balled it instead of measuring it in a measuring cup.  I will be making this again.  Oh, I brought it to work, assembled it and threw it in the toaster oven at 350 for about 7 minutes and then toasted it so that it got nice and brown on top.  Coworkers loved it and I had to give them the recipe too!

These were really good.  Very flavorful, super easy, and quick to prepare.  There were four of us and the whole batch was gone in less than 5 minutes.  The next time I make them I might try toasting the underside of the bread before spreading and broiling the topping on the other side.  Very tasty!

Hubby loved it, but next time I think I will add some finely chopped onions to the mix.  Also, I used Miracle Whip...oops! I won't do that again (real mayo only)! I made with fat free everything and with a whole wheat french roll-yummy!!  Thanks :)

Yum! It was definitely creamy and I like the flavor the Italian seasoning gave it. I like to try a new bread every time I make a pasta dish but this one will stay on my favorites. There is a distinct mayonnaise flavor for anyone who may not be a fan.

Sorry, did not like it at all.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Too much of a mayo taste.

I consider myself to be a "salt-aholic" but this was even too salty for me. Maybe half of the seasoning packet next time.

Excellent! A tad on the salty side, but very yummy and versatile. We used co-jack rather than Swiss in the two times we have made it, but will definately try it with Swiss next time. Thanks!

I've made this half a dozen times for different potlucks and each time there's not a drop left.  I make the cheese dip in the crockpot, then have bread for dipping.  Outstanding!

LOVED THIS!!  I made a small amount of this for two pieces of french baguette for Hubs and me last night.  I really liked the Swiss cheese in this, which made it different from your typical garlic bread.  Glad I didn't make a whole loaf, because I could have eaten the whole thing! LOL!

Awesome!  I put in my Little Dipper crock pot and served with a sliced french baguette instead of broiling it, since I was taking it to a party.  Everyone loved it and I think heating it in the crock pot makes it even better because the flavors have time to mix during the warming process.  Used shredded Italian blend cheese.  Yum!  Can't wait to make it again.

this cheese bread is so yummy!! the first time I made it I used Italian cheese instead of swiss (its hard to find swiss in our small town grocery stores) and it was awesome and so easy. the second time I made it with swiss and it was good also. I do prefer it with the Italian mix cheese that is how I will make it in the future. You don't have to make it all at once either I only did enough bread for the 4 of us and put the rest in the fridge for a meal later in the week and it was still great.

This was a simple and yummy treat!  It went great with chicken parmesan and a tossed salad.  I used colby jack cheese because that's what I had on hand.  I will definitely make again!  The entire family loved it!

This was okay - there was just way too much of the topping.  If I make it again I will put it on MUCH thinner and bake for a couple of minutes before broiling.  The bottom of the bread was very soft.

super yummy!! It was a bit salty, but I think that was my fault because I added Parmesan cheese to the mozzarella. Will def. make again maybe adding tomatoes and/or bacon.

I thought I was not putting much on the loaves, which I split but left whole, but everyone thought there was too much cheese spread.  Personally, I think this would be good with just a smear.

Yum!  Instead of broiling individual slices I spread on both halfs of the full loaf and baked it for 10 minutes or so and then sliced.  I like the dip idea - I'll have to try it.  Very creamy!

I would have to rate this 3.5 stars. This was good, but it took a little time to grow on me. At first when I tasted it I didn't like the sort of 'sweetness' in it, but as I kept eating it I started to like it a little more. I'm assuming the sweet taste was from the italian dressing mix. Hubby like it pretty much, but said that he liked some of the others I've tried better. I may try this again, but we'll see. Thanks for sharing. :)

Love this recipe!  Just be careful not to load with too much of the cheese mixture, the italian dressing can be a bit overpowering. A thin layer of the mixture is all it takes. This is great as an appetizer or as a side dish.

I made this for BBQ we were having at our home on 4th of July and everyone loved it (even the kids that don't like sour cream or mayo).  Everyone asked me for the recipe so I knew I had keeper!

I was skeptical about this recipe. But man was it good! Very creamy and very rich. I had two changes: First, didn’t have Swiss cheese so I used Monterey Jack. Melted up so nicely. Second, I was serving this bread with a really garlicky main dish so I didn’t want it to be anything like garlic bread. So in place of the Italian seasoning packet I added my own dry herbs - mostly rosemary, along with a bit of oregano, thyme, and salt. OMG, the rosemary flavor was so delicious and looked so pretty swimming in the creaminess. Definitely will make again- thinking this will make a great Super Bowl party food if sliced up into strips.

Excellent!    I used Italian Blend cheese and added Knorr's Vegetable soup mix.  I took this to an office potluck and received rave reviews.  Because it was a potluck, I did as one person mention and put this all in a crock pot & served with sliced baguette bread.  Will definitely make again!

Liked it, first time making it! However, it was a little bit too salty for my taste. I'll blame my cooking abilities on that one though, I'll definitely give it another try, but next time with less mayo and about half the amount of dressing.

This recipe is amazing!  I made just a few changes after reading other reviews, first I used just a tad less mayo, half pkg of seasoning, added crushed red pepper and finally, I used Mozzarella and Provolone cheese! I baked bread 10 minutes then added spread, then broiled! I served it with La Charrette wine and it was fabulous!  Definitely make this again and again lol! Thanks for recipe and all the helpful suggestions.

Good, but the bread definitely needs to be toasted in the oven before adding the rest and baking.  Soggy middle ruins it otherwise.

Made this w/spaghetti dinner last night and the family loved.  I followed the recipe exactly (well almost - didn't measure the swiss cheese - just grated off the block till it looked like a good amount) but there are endless possibilities for modifying this to your taste.  I've got some fresh garden tomatoes that I think I'll dice and add to the next batch - yummy!  Thanks for the great recipe Kim!

I used sliced sandwich bread and deli sliced swiss cheese and a little more sour cream than the mayo. I thought this was good went great with beefy baked raviolis from this site.

I'm eating it now! It's delicious! I used frozen garlic texas toast instead of french bread. So I had to thaw the bread and instead of the broiler I put in my little convection oven and it turned out very good. Next time I might not use the garlic toast cuz it is way too rich to eat often. But just this once is alright.

I made this bread for a dinner with a bunch of friends.  It was a HUGE hit.  Everyone loved it.  I couldn't find shredded swiss cheese, so I just used shredded italian cheese.  I also added a little more cheese than the recipe called for.  This was a delicious recipe.

I use this in place of traditional garlic bread when I make italian dishes. I didn't have a packet of dry italian seasoning mix, so I added oregano, basil, and some crushed bay leaves. I also added a little cumin to give it a bit of a  kick. It turned out FANTASTIC! I've made this recipe on more than one occassion, and it's very rare that there are any leftovers!

This bread is so yummy !!!!  Creamy Cheesy Bread coupled with a big salad makes a great summer meal.  Since I tried this recipe 2 weeks ago my family has requested this almost everytime we sit down to eat dinner.  A keeper for sure!!!

This was good. It wasn't fantastic though. I would probably make it again.

Did I do something wrong? It was very easy but not the best taste. I will try it again and add less mayo and Italian dressing.

I really like this, but I had miracle whip light on hand so I used this instead.  It was a little bit tangy, still really good but will definitely try the mayo next time to get the full effect.

Good, but I found it a little salty for our taste.  I suspect it was the brand of dressing mix that I used.  I will definitely try again and either 1) use less of the seasoning or 2) try a different brand.

Shouldn't "generously" apply to each slice of bread.  It was way too cheesy.  I'd apply a thin layer next time.  Also watch closely...they tend to burn quickly!!!
