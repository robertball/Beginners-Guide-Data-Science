Delicious!  I used large, shelled, defrosted, cooked shrimp.  For a more spicy taste, add chili powder.  I served it over pasta twists.

It was alright, just glorified spaghetti marinara with shrimp with way too much onion.  I don't think we'll be making it again.

If you are looking for something that is very tasty, super easy and quick to prepare, look no further!  Everyone loved this dish "as is", but it is also very adaptable, if you wanted to add other ingredients, such as mushrooms, etc. Can be made spicier, if desired, just by adding a touch of hot sauce.  Hope this helps and enjoy!

Too much prep for something that is not that good.  Terrible as leftovers.  No really worth the effort.
