I normally notice the vanilla protein powder in smoothies, but not in this one. I didn't think it needed the honey, and left it out. The recipe didn't specify if the coconut milk was canned or not, but it's what I used. I'll make this again!

Great tasting smoothie. I also used coconut water and my pineapple was frozen so I eliminated the ice cubes.

This was really good and refreshing. I used coconut water in place of regular water, and it was fantastic! I'll definitely make this again, and I'd like to try freezing the pineapple first next time.

I really enjoyed this. I replaced the water with almond milk for extra creamy flavour. The sweetness of honey was perfect.

This was very tasty! I only had  regular coconut milk and after reading the fat content, I only used half and put in more pineapple. Still turned out great and I will make again to the recipe.

Very nice and creamy. I used coconut water instead of regular water, it added a nice touch. A very tropical flavored smoothie to start your day in a healthy way.

If you like pineapple, this is fabulous! Refreshing, naturally sweet, delicious!
