1.9.20  Very similar to gazpacho, this is a very nice chilled soup. I thought it was ideally spiced with just a little kick from the jalapeños, but overall, very mellow.  And to say I like its nutritional breakdown is an understatement. The only change that I’ll make in the future is to increase the dill weed, one of my favorite spices that I just would like to taste more (personal preference here).  I live in Florida and seldom have to deal with cold temps, so this is a soup that will be made year round for us.  Solid recipe and will be made again.
