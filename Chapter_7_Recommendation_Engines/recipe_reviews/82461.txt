These were really quite nice, but the onion soup mix made them a little bit too salty. Will see what I can do with modifications.

What a novice idea!  These were actually very tasty.  Not hard to make the hearts.  But... you only need 1/4 of the cheese and mushroom mixture.  And that is probably too much.  And....  Samantha (Bewitched) couldn't make these in 10 minutes.  Plan on closer to 30 minutes.

Very yummy! In order to get the filling inside the meatballs, my meatballs turned out really big. It was easier to shape them into hearts than I thought it was going to be. Our Valentine's Day lunch company liked them too! The meatballs made great leftovers- we put one on a bun, added some ketchup and mustard and had a hamburger! Thanks for the recipe!

These are really cute!  I used a pound of turkey and got 4 big hearts.  Instead of the onion soup, I used coriander, nutmeg, garlic powder, salt, pepper, parsley and onion flakes to season the meat.  When had been in the oven for 20 minutes, I poured over a sauce made of a can of cream of chicken soup, 1 1/4 cups light sour cream, 1/2-3/4 cup milk, 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce, 1/3 cup white wine, a sprinkle of salt and a sprinkle of parsley.  Baked them for 20 more minutes.  The sauce was great over the meatballs!  Also, what worked best for me when making the meatballs was to just make the 2 sides shaped like rounded triangles, put them together and seal the edges, and then form it into a heart shape.  Oh and for some reason I could only fit about a tablespoon and a half of the filling into each one, I'll try to do more next time.  A chunk of cheese and some mushroom slices might be easier to handle.

We really loved these.  I gave them four stars because I made changes:  used one pound ground turkey and one pound ground chicken, used mozzarella b/c I didn't have Swiss, mixed everything together at once, and threw in a handful of Penzey's Spices pasta sprinkle.  I made 12 round meatballs and then served them over mashed potatoes with a bechamel mushroom sauce.  Everyone, including kids, loved them.

My husband and I loved these!  I actually cut the recipe in half, and formed the meat mixture into a meatloaf, instead of meatballs.  It was incredible, and will definitely be on our menu again in the future!

Good and easy recipe!  I made spaghetti and meatballs for Valentine's Day. My boyfriend LOVED it!  Next time, I might follow another recipe and mix ground pork in too (the fat from the pork makes them more juicy)!

These were amazing. Normally my meatballs turn out okay, but these finally got a thumbs up from my husband. I added a jar of baby food beef for moisture, just like the Ground Round does. Simply perfect.

This was decent. I think I will use mozerrella next time and a little more seasoning. The swiss kind of got lost in the meat flavor. Made meatball subs with provolone on top the next day and they were good.

Made these for Valentine's day for my boyfriend - they certainly were CUTE, but a little dry. If I had made them a tad bigger they would have been better, so more stuffing could fit. Next time I will poor some beef broth over them and cook a little less time so they are more moist. On the whole, though, this was a great recipe for the special occasion.

I made this for my husband this weekend and he was extremely impressed. They have wonderful taste! These would make excellent hamburgers if you make bigger meatballs and flatten them into patties. We plan on trying this during the week!

Made this for my family today and they LOVED it ~ even most of the kids who are typically fussy.  I only used 1 envelope of Onion Soup Mix to 2 lbs of beef and I used Mozzarella Cheese instead of Swiss because that's all I had.  My daughter wanted to know if she can have flower shaped ones next time...what have I started?  These would probably be good in regular patty shapes, too and maybe a bit easier than hearts.  I agree, is more than 10 min prep but I used a cookie cutter which seemed to help.

I overcooked mine by cooking for 45 min.. dried it out...  in the future, I’ll make hearts  a bit bigger than palm sized cause they shrivel up.
