Hi, all.  I'm the Cathy who submitted this recipe, and I'm glad to be able to share it with those of you who have been enjoying it.  It is still my favorite dressing.  I just wanted to step back in and make a few comments for those who weren't satisfied.  It was mentioned that the dressing tastes like biting into a plain onion, and that it was hot, and another used a red onion and not all the sugar.  You will notice the onion ingredient says "1/2 a SMALL onion".  This would be approximately 1/2 cup chopped, and please do use a mild white onion.  The hot onion definitely makes the dressing hot and bitter.  The kind of onion used will affect the flavor of the dressing.  Another used just garlic salt and recommended not to use the extra salt.  The recipe doesn't call for garlic salt but garlic powder, which has no salt in it.  Yet another didn't use the onion at all, only an Italian seasoning packet.  In my opinion, to write a review on a recipe requires you follow the recipe as written and not make substitutions, otherwise you are writing a review on the recipe as you changed it.  I hope you continue to enjoy this fabulous dressing, and for those who didn't enjoy it, you might give it another chance using the instructions as written.  Then if you don't like it, you'll be entirely justified in your opinion!  Happy eating!

My husband always orders Creamy Italian dressing in restaurants, but I could never find a good version at the grocery store. I had all the ingredients on hand and literally whipped this up in five minutes; he tried it and said, "That's the one! Don't change a thing!" Thanks, Cathy!!!

This dressing was really great - the key is to let it sit overnight before serving because once the flavors meld it is wonderful.  I did change the recipe a bit - I used bottled minced garlic rather than garlic powder and did not use onion in the dressing at all (because since I was using lots of onions in the salad it just wasnt necessary to have it in the dressing - and I thought that the garlic substitution made up for it).  The only thing I didnt like about this dressing was that I used dried Italian seasoning - maybe mine isnt a good brand or something but I though it made the dressing taste very fake-herby or something (although once you mix it with the salad you cant tell that).  Next time I will definitely use fresh herbs - basil, oregano, tarragon, parsley and rosemary - that makes it a little more expensive to make but it is so worth it to pack all of those fresh herby flavors into the dressing.  Recommendations for a great Italian salad to go with this dressing: Iceberg and Romaine lettuce, plum tomatoes, provolone cheese, broccoli, red onion, garbanzo beans, pepperoncini, roasted red peppers and homemade croutons (these are KEY - get really well seasoned fresh croutons from the farmers market).  I made an enormous amount of salad and my guests devoured all of it!

After reading the reviews I decided to do everything exactly as the recipe called for.. but add the sugar a bit at a time to make sure it wasnt too much. In the end I only used about 3/4 of the sugar but the dressing is incredible. This is def the new house dressing in THIS house! Thanks so much for such a simple yet amazing recipe.. I cant wait to have company over so I can show it off!

I used half olive oil mayonnaise, half fat free sour cream, I used six green onions sliced thin and I doubled the spices. Awesome dip for raw vegetables. You should have heard me. I was just "mmmmm'ing" away. I did thin it down a bit with fat free milk. NOTE: I did NOT add the sugar, but that's a personal choice not reflective of the recipe.

I somehow thought this would be quite thick, but it's quite liquid and pourable after going through the blender.  I really love it over pasta type salads, but also works well on greens.  A real keeper (meaning I keep it in my refrigerator all the time)!

This is a delicious salad dressing; I'll definitely make it again.  It reminds me of the house dressing served at one of my favorite Italian restaurants.  The spices and the mayo blend together perfectly.  Thanks for sharing it, Cathy!

Overall, very tasty.  I used Hellman's light mayo and a little under 1/2 cup of a vidalia onion.  I also added some minced garlic and a bit of basil.  This was great over a garden salad with garlic croutons and shredded Parmesan cheese.

I actually made this last night, but when I tasted it, it wasn't very good, so I thought that maybe the flavors needed to meld a little more.  Well, I wasn't very fond of it today either.  I used a red onion and that may have altered the flavor some (it did turn a shade of pink).  I didn't use all of the sugar either so maybe that was it as well.  I'll try again and maybe that will change my mind.  ;)

Wonderful dressing!  In addition to the garlic powder, I added 3 cloves of minced garlic and doubled the italian seasoning...it came out perfectly seasoned (but we like highly seasoned food) and got RAVE REVIEWS from my boyfriend.  Be sure to not use more than half an onion, though...i decided to use about 3/4 so as not to have a 1/4 onion left over and it was quite pungent.  Great recipe!!!

This is so good! I halved the recipe, used a sweet white onion, and omitted the sugar. I used it for a pasta salad with rotini, fresh mozzerella, tomatoes, banaana peppers, and peppeoroni. Amazing!

I love this dressing. Over the past few months I have developed what we like best: 3/4 mayo and 1/4 cup olive oil, 2-3 TBS white or red onion, a bit less sugar, a bit more red wine vinegar and the addition of a pinch of poultry seasoning. I always use fresh garlic in my home but for this recipe the powdered is better - it becomes just too too much with fresh garlic.

Terrible!  It was like biting into a plain onion.  I don't know if other people used a different kind of onion or not, or if they reduced the amount called for, but using half of a regular onion made it entirely too strong.  I definitely won't be making this again.

A superb homemade salad dressing!  I can imagine that this dressing would make for excellent veggie dipping too.  The dressing tastes rich and full, though quite thin, which suits me fine.  Clearly, those reviewers that recommended leaving the dressing in the refrigerator overnight, allowing the ingredients to meld together - were right on target.  The dressing tasted very good within an hour of when I made it, but as good as it was last night, when I tasted it a few minutes ago after resting in the refrigerator overnight, the taste was astoundingly good!  Make this recipe - you just won't believe how good it is.

This dressing is wonderful.  My five year old daughter even likes it and she hates everything!  I use fat free mayo and leave out the sugar.

This is pretty good! I used a red onion (which according to the submitter is a no-no), becuse that was what I had on hand. I only used about 2 Tbsp of it though, and found that it was the perfect amount of this type of onion. I can see where using 1/2 of a small "onion", as the recipe calls for, may be too much.  I will be using this as a dressing for toasted Italian subs, so I am sure it will be perfect.

Oooh, this is delicious!  You MUST make it the day before: it is good the first day, and fantastic the second day!  Just threw everything in the blender.  It's so easy!  I can't believe I was paying for premade dressing when this is so easy and so much yummier!  I used light mayo, and it turned out great!

Very, very good! This dressing was a hit with the "ranch-only" eaters in the house. My only complaint was the lingering onion taste, long after dinner was over. I think when I make this again (and I will), I will use a bit less onion. Otherwise, very good, thanks Cathy.

I have been making this dressing for probably 30 years now. I got it from the label on the mayo jar.  It is absolutely the BEST!  I do mine in the blender, and I use a little less than 1/2 cup chopped onion.  Always a white onion, never a red one.  As Cathy stated, if you will follow the recipe, and use the ingredients listed, you will get a great dressing.  If you choose to use (for instance) garlic salt instead of garlic powder, and then omit the salt, the dressing just will not turn out like it should.  I have a tendency to "guess" at some of my measurements when cooking certain dishes, however, there are some recipes that need to be adhered to exactly in order for it to turn out. This is one of those recipes. I make a simple salad using mixed greens, grape tomatoes, and black olives.  I pour the desired amount of dressing over the salad and mix to coat.  Then I sprinkle it with a little dried dill weed.  It is a perfect match with any Italian dish.

I would not even call this creamy italian.  You might as well just slap some mayonaise on your salad.  Too thick and mayonnaise dominates taste.

PERFECT!  We're not italian dressing fans, but was going all out with an Italian dinner and thought "How can so many reviewers be wrong?"  So I took about a minute to whip this up, (seriously thats all the longer it took in the processor) too easy-too good!  A new house favorite. Busy moms-try this!  Thank you from the bottom of our happy stomachs.

I found this to be just a little too mayo-tasting so I added some extra vinegar.  Also next time I would decrease the sugar to a 1/2 tbs. - it was just a little too sweet.  However this is a really good recipe, though.

After my grocery store stopped carrying my favorite salad dressing, I opted to try this recipe & I'm so pleased that I did.  I've made this recipe on a few occasions & enjoyed it every time.  I followed the directions, as I usually have the ingredients readily available in my kitchen.  I concur with the other users here... careful with the onion.  This recipe couldn't be any easier!

Really good and easy to make.  Keeps very well in fridge.  Lightened up a bit with Low Fat Mayo and it still was great.  No reason to buy dressing bottled again.  Great for company.

I love this dressing.  Made mine in the processor - very easy and delicious.  The onion flavour was perfect.  Will definately make this all the time.

I will never buy bottled dressing again!  This was my first try at dressing - and what a difference.  I tastes even better after a day in the fridge.  My husband was dipping his bread in it and eating - and he is picky!

I tried this recipe for a small dinner party.  Everybody loved this dressing.  Have already given the recipe to several people and will continue to use the dressing for all types of salads.

An excellent creamy italian!!  Be sure to cover and let this "season" in the fridge for a couple of hours.  When the flavors meld...it's wonderful!!  It's going to be a regular at my house.  Thanks Cathy!!

I was looking for a new salad dressing that had a lot of taste and was creamy.  This one filled the bill and it was excellent.  I followed the recipe right to the letter and both my husband and I loved it.  This is a keeper!

I really liked this dressing so did everyone else who tried it. I added a little extra vinegar and now use it exclusively. I like it much better then store bought dressing.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe. I live in Spain and I needed something to whip up really quick on a Sunday afternoon for my company's picnic. No stores open at all so, I looked up pasta recipes. I found this one and let me tell you--it was gone in the blink of an eye! Each time we have a potluck, everyone asks me if I'm going to bring pasta salad with the special dressing! It's a hit! Congratulations!

This was very good.  I used what I had on hand which was 2 cloves of garlic, crema mexicana, mayo, a  little sour cream, 1/2 small yellow onion, dried basil, 2 tblsps white wine vinegar, 3/4 tblsps sugar (I would cut this down next time--maybe 1/2 tblsp), sea salt and fresh cracked pepper.  Really loved it!  And easily adaptable to ingredients you have in the frig or pantry.

Brilliant dressing! So easy to make, with tossing it all in the blender.
Did use sjalots instead of white onion, bacause that was all I had. Used it on a cold pasta salad, everyone loved it.

Excellent!  At first I though it tasted too much like mayo and almost added more vinegar, but I'm glad I didn't because after it sat for an hour in the fridge it was perfect.  I am sure I will make this one regularly.

Hubby asked me to try to find a Creamy Italian Dressing like the one Pizza Hut served years ago. I put a request on the RE and "K-Dub" suggested this recipe.  It was perfect! Hubs said this dressing isn't exactly the same...but it's better. He declared it one of the best salads he's ever had. I followed the recipe with the exception of using White Wine Vinegar in place of the red (what I had on hand). All of the ingredients just go together perfectly. Thank you K-Dub for your help and thanks Cathy, for sharing!

I agree wholeheartedly with the comments by the recipe's owner/poster Cathy - it's not fair to give a recipe a poor rating if you didn't follow the exact ingredients/directions...  However, I just HAD to change a few things - primarily in an effort to cut back on the fat in this recipe.  I used 1/2 c. mayonnaise and 1/2 c. fat free plain yogurt.  I also used a full teaspoon of homemade Italian Seasonings (equal parts basil, oregano, thyme, and half parts marjoram, sage and a touch of rosemary).   Since we don't use red wine vinegar I substituted for natural, unfiltered apple cider vinegar instead... blended everything together and it was divine.  The onions I had on hand were a bit strong, but the the flavor overall was still great.  A sweeter onion such as a Vidalia, Walla Walla or Texas Sweet would have been better suited for this recipe.  I also used fresh garlic instead of powder for a slighter more crisp garlic undertone (garlic powder has a bit of an aftertaste to me that I'm not particularly fond of).  Overall this was still amazingly tasty and much less fat!  Give it a try!

I needed a quick dressing to go with a salad to take to work tomorrow. Read this recipe and made it in less than 5 minutes. I used some red onion instead and it's not too strong. This is very yummy, a perfect 'new' recipe for my collection!

Wonderful, if a little intense.  I cut the onion to 1/3.  I used it as a salad dressing on day 1, added a big tablespoon of mayo on day two, and tossed it with cucumbers, and used it on day 3 for a veggie dip.  Day 4 - there was no more.

Scrumptious! I've served this at several dinner parties now and this always gets rave reviews.  The consistency is perfect when I use regular mayo, but when using reduced fat I have to thin it out a bit.  Make sure the onion you use is small, or consider using only a quarter and taste it before adding any more.  Whips up so easily with my stick blender...  fabulous recipe!

I thought this recipe was excellent, but it really didn't go over good with the people I served it to.  I made it for a neighborhood cookout, then found out one guy is allergic to mayo, and another lady doesn't like garlic.  Whatever....  Other people ate it, but I didn't get any compliments on it.

I tried this recipe several months ago. My husband and I absolutely love it!  I have had many requests for the recipe. It turned out great using only the garlic salt.  I don't think the additional salt is needed.  Be careful that you only use a mild onion. Using a strong onion can overpower the other ingredients.  Enjoy!

A+++++   Made this yesterday afternoon to serve on the side with spaghetti sauce and ranch dressing for Hoagie Bake.   This dressing is GREAT, couldn't find bottled brand, had all the ingredients, and used my Betty Crocker hand blender.  I did add a couple tablespoons of milk to thin it a little more and cut back sugar to 2 tsp per a previous reviewer.  Perfect!  Thanks for sharing Cathy, it'll be a regular at our house.

Yum! I thought this was a great salad dressing -- much better than any bottled creamy italian! I added just a little squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Also used low-fay mayo (you cannot taste a difference). Will definitely be making this again!

I wasn't impressed with this the day I made it, but it transformed overnight.  I did find the flavors a bit too strong for my toddler so I used an extra glob of mayo.  I used the mellower version to make cole slaw.  It was the first time my little guy would eat cabbage ever! Unfortunately, I didn't know how well it would go over and only make about 2 cups of slaw.  Poor tot was licking his plate, fingers and spoon.

This recipe is becoming a staple in my house. I cut the calories a bit by adding a couple of heaping Tbsp of sour cream or plain yogurt as part of the 1 cup mayo (you still get the great mayo flavor). Also because I like the little onion chunks, I grate my mild, small onion on the box grater and add juice and all to the dressing. It keeps a week or more in the refrigerator, getting more tasty each day.

I picked this recipe for my daughter since creamy Italian is her fave.  I added a little onion powder, parm cheese and red pepper.  My husband said it was the best dressing he'd ever tasted.  My daughter took one bite and said we'd never need to buy dressing again.  This is a keeper.

LOVED this dip with a minor adjustment.  After reading submitter's update on this recipe, I used on 1/4 cup minced yellow onion.  After tasting, it still had a stronger onion flavor than my family would like.  I added an additional 1/4 cup of mayo and a teaspoon of sugar.  We like the recipe better than the C.I.Dressing II.  My family really enjoyed this and they are big ranch dressing fans, so this dressing really made an impression!

Didn't care for this one so much.  I did substitute the red wine vinegar with balsamic vinegar...maybe that's why.  Still, I won't be making it again.  It just isn't tasty.  Not horrible, but not good.

I THOUGHT THIS WAS JUST OKAY BUT I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MY FAULT. I USED MIRACLE WHIP(WHICH HAS A SWEET TASTE) INSTEAD OF MAYO AND I WENT AHEAD AND ADDED THE SUGAR(MISTAKE). SO IT CAME OUT VERY SWEET. NEXT TIME I WILL MAKE AS WRITTEN AND PROBABLY CHANGE MY REVIEW.

Although this is a good recipe, I don't consider it anything like the commercial creamy Italian dressings.   It was very sweet upon first taste, and I think I could have used a much sweeter onion, as it has a very "oniony" aftertaste.  Altogether not a bad recipe, just not what I was after.

Cathy, thanks for submitting!  This was a winner in my book.  I didn't change a thing.  The flavor and texture of this dressing is so good!  People trying this dressing should definitely adhere to your follow up review recommending the use of a mild onion.

Very easy to make....whipped up for dinner party last night and my husband really enjoyed it.  Quite different from reg italian dressing.  Omitted onion and substituted an italian soup seasoning packet and still turned out fine.

This salad dressing recipe is great. We had tried on our own several times to make a tangy flavorful dressing like this one, but we couldn't get it just right. 

 This dressing is fabulous. It even works, if you substitute the mayonnaise with miracle whip, or even low fat/fat free dressings. I even used it for a different touch to cole slaw. I barely got any because everyone sucked it down. You can't go wrong with a dressing like this. You don't even need salad to eat it, you can just dip your favorite veggies in it, and instant snack time heaven!!!!  Good Job Cathy, Good Job!!!!!

I've made many, many homemade salad dressings over the years trying to avoid all of the chemicals/additives in the commercial products.  I have to say that this is hands down our favorite and will be a regular resident in our refrigerator.  I used a Vidalia onion, keeping in mind that they are quite a bit larger than your typical "small" onion.  I'd say I used 1/4 cup onion which was perfect.  It is rare for me to write a review but I rely on them heavily, so I felt it only fair to recommend this recipe so that others can enjoy.

Love, love, love this! Thanks for the delicious recipe. The only thing I will change next time is to reduce the sugar to 1/2 tablespoon. It was a little on the sweet side for me, but most everything is anyway. My husband thought it was perfect! This will be in my fridge always now! I'll never buy Italian dressing again! Thanks so much!

Made this last night.  Hubby and I both LOVED it.  He usually doesn't like Creamy Italian and prefers bottled Ranch.  He told me not to buy anymore Ranch.  This reminded him of what his mom used to make.  I followed Cathy's directions and used my new Immersion Blender to whip it up.  Worked beautifully.  I'll always keep this dressing in my fridge from now on.  I think it would be good over veggies too.

This dressing is awesome!  Just the right blend of spices, and the red wine vinegar breaks down the mayonnaise into a creamy dressing.  I whipped it up to use it with the Fisherman's Quick Fish recipe for dinner.  Thank you for an easy and delicious meal!

Though I don't love reviews that tweak the recipe 10 different ways then pronounce how great it is, I DID add some roasted red pepper for color--and it turned out great.  Just mixed it up and served it right away, so I'm sure it'll be even better tomorrow.

This was very good. Not sure what others were talking about when they say it's thick because mine turned out like liquid. Easy to pour over my salad. Maybe because I mixed it all in the blender. It does taste a bit oniony but I like that. I do think next time I would like to try it with green onions instead.

It's delicious with summer tomatoes- and I made it with low-fat mayo, so it is also very low in calories and fat.

I made it as is... tasted it... and it needed some more Italian seasoning and garlic powder. I maybe doubled or close to doubled both. I'd recently purchased (from a quality vendor) my herbs and garlic so I'm pretty sure it was just not quite there for me. I like my dressings to be pretty flavorful. 

I used this on a pasta salad with tomatoes, sliced onions, cucumbers, olives sliced in long quarters and it was fantastic. I had some dressing left over and I really look forward to using it as a salad. 

As the recipe stands it is not quite up to 5 stars since I had to add more seasoning. However if I try it in a couple days and it's too strong I'll come back and update my rating. I *did* consider that the herbs may marry and get stronger over time.

Love it! I used a green onion (it's the only kind I like raw) which made the dressing a lovely pale green color :)

This dressing is my new favorite. I used white vinegar instead of red wine vinegar and it was perfect. It also is a good dip for raw vegetables.

This made a wonderful dressing for a pasta salad that I had to make w/very little notice! Next time, I plan on adding grape tomatoes, carrot strips and perhaps some cucumber.

Delicious! I made this exactly per the recipe, except that I took about 1.5 T of the chopped onion out of the food processor because it looked like a lot.

So, so good.  I used red onion (it's all I had) and it turned it pretty and pink.  Really yummy, even my two little ones (3 & 4 years) gobbled up their salad.  Thanks!

We thought this was good. I made it twice, once with Hellman's Mayo and once with a store brand mayo.  There was a huge difference in taste.  I'd recommend Hellman's.  This also makes a good amount of dressing so you may want to alter the recipe if you won't be eating it within a few days.

Really liked this dressing!  I had to sub white wine vinegar for red because that's what I had and I used a little more fresh ground pepper because that's what we like.  Next time I will omit the sugar or scale it back.  Used on a pasta salad and it was delish!

I initially followed the recipe exactly, but it was very thick and mayonnaisey, so I thinned it out quite a bit with about 1/4 cup nonfat milk and tripled the amount of vinegar.  I also added more seasoning.  I think next time I'll just add about 1/2 the mayo and leave all other quantities as is.  With the adjustment, it turned out excellent. We've used it for dressing in wraps and on salads.

I got so many compliments on this dressing on a dinner salad I made.  It was so delicious and extremely easy to make.  I just have one recommendation and that is to chill it before serving, it will help it to firm up a little bit and make it a little creamier.

I made this dressing on the weekend to take to a dinner party to put on the pasta salad I made. I was very easy to make and it went down a treat. I'm not sure how the consistency should be in terms of thick to runny, although I think it came out okay. With the different varieties of mayo it can be hard, although I was very happy with the result and will make again to add to lots of salads and also hamburgers! Thank you for sharing.

I usually use vinegar of choice or vinegar mix. But I wanted something creamy yet vinegar based. Something similar to ranch but with a good taste, no preservatives, nor odd taste. I like to add more vinegar so it can be runny and not thick. I love this recipe and have been eating it for days now.

I've made this recipe many times, and have gotten nothing but rave reviews from family and friends. I usually make it exactly as described, just doubling on occasion. The only other change that I occasionally make is using fresh garlic cloves instead of garlic powder - as my family and I love garlic, and sometimes I will add crumbled bacon (my favorite alteration). On a side note, sometimes I have forgotten to add the salt, and haven't missed it. But, I seriously do not think you will ever regret trying this recipe, as it is my go to recipe for dressing when I am making pasta salad!

I loved this dressing! I made a half recipe and didn't feel like taking out my mini processor so I just mixed it all in a small bowl, and chopped the onions finely. So much better than the store-bought stuff and so easy to make. Thanks Cathy...this is a keeper! UPDATE 10/21/15:  Added parmesan cheese, and it's even better! Pretty close to one I really like in an Italian restaurant in Boston's North End, too.

I avoid buying prepackaged foods and instead try to make as much from scratch as I can. For the past few years, that has included making my own salad dressings. This is by far the BEST creamy dressing I have ever made. I followed the directions to the letter, thinking that I'd probably end up altering the recipe to my taste next time I make it. But, no need! This turns out perfectly exactly as written.  I already can't wait for my next salad!  Thanks so much for sharing =)

I have searched for a creamy homemade dressing for ages, and every one came up short in one way or another. This one is a HOME RUN. The flavors are exactly on point. So delicious. As a dip, I keep it exactly as is (delicious with every raw veggie I can think of). As a salad dressing, I add 2-3 T of olive oil and a splash of milk to thin it just a bit (and add a bit more herbs to account for the volume). This is just a consistency preference. Delicious! I'll never look for another creamy dressing!

I needed to dress up a pasta salad that I'd made from the box so I made a 1/2 recipe of this dressing and used it.. it was very, very good.  I'd make this again for sure.  I like the creaminess of this better than an oil & vinegar based dressing.

Wow, talk about authentic!  The bonus is how easy it is to make.  I do recommend letting it sit overnight to let the flavours meld together.  Thanks Cathy!!

Very yummy dressing! I used all the ingredients listed (the mayo was Smart Balance light mayo), and added a little bit of fresh chopped basil and rosemary because I happened to have it on hand.  I also added an extra tablespoon of vinegar and 2 tablespoons of milk to make it easier to pour. My husband keeps raving about this dressing!

I made the recipe exactly as directed. I do not think you can change or substitute ingredients if you are going to review the recipe, because you are then reviewing YOUR version of the recipe. Having said that, "1/2 of a small onion" would be better if described in weight; a small onion is subjective; and what kind of onion? I guessed and used a white onion. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and loved it. It can always be seasoned to taste, once made -- to your liking. But as directed, this recipe is everything a creamy Italian dressing should be.

This is a really, really good dressing exactly as written.  I have had many people ask for the recipe. Tonight I used it in a pasta salad with tomatos , peppers, olives, but any vegetable you like would work equally well.

It is an extremely good dressing that is very simple do make. I just like to add about a 1/4 of a cup of shredded asiago cheese to add a little bit more flavor. Thank you Cathy for sharing an excellent recipe.

This dressing was so easy to make. I didn't change a thing on this recipe.  My entire family loved it, which says a lot, since I have yet to make something they all like.  It's great as a cracker dip too.  How do I know this?  Because I just made a batch of dressing and it's gone because my two sons ate it with crackers and thought it was amazing.

I made this dressing for the shelter meal tonight. I've made it before. One of the best dressings I've ever had. Although, it's not flavorful enough. I added a bit more italian seasoning, but it wasn't enough. So, everything besides onion and mayo I tend to double, even the vinegar. I also used shallots instead of onion since I was out of onion. I think that could be a good substitute for people who think that onion is too much. It's a bit milder and sweeter than an onion. I'm not a fan of bottled Italian dressing which tends to be loads of stabilizers and chunks of unidentifiable stuff in a golden or plain white creamy dressing. Every recipe I've found, with a few tweaks, has been just amazing. I freakin crave this dressing when I make it! I'll have 3 salads a day just so I can use this dressing.

This is my new favorite! I am always looking for recipes that I can tweak a little to fit a low carb diet without changing the flavor too much, and this one worked out perfectly - I used onion powder instead of the chopped onions and 2 tsp. of Splenda in place of the sugar. It was delicious and is the closest I have ever tasted to my favorite restaurant dressing. I may add a little extra garlic powder in the next batch, even though it is good as is - we just love garlic in my house. It turned out very creamy and thick enough to use for a vegie dip as well as a salad dressing. Thanks for posting this!

Delicious!  As someone else said, it is as good or better than the house creamy italian dressing at our favorite italian restaurant.  Thanks for sharing. (Out of preference, I left out the sugar and it is still delicious). I am done buying store salad dressings.  I have so many bottles of dressing in the frig that were only used once.  What a waste.  This is much more economical.  Thanks again.

I used fat free mayo to cut back on the calories. I followed the recipe exactly, let it sit in the fridge for a few hours. I tasted it and thought it was good, but a tiny bit bland. I added another splash of red wine vinegar, and a bit more Italian seasoning. Perfect. I look forward to using this on a pasta salad.

This was so quick and easy to make, but I wasn't able to let it sit as long as I wanted it to. It still tasted fantastic though. I would definitely add more garlic and leave out the onion if you're going to be using onions in the salad.

This was okay as an onion dressing.  I followed the directions to a T and used a yellow onion.  Tasted very peppery and had a strong onion flavor.  I served it on a wedge salad with feta cheese and avocado which tasted good but nothing like creamy italian in my opinion.

This is pretty good. Made a half batch to see if my family would like it. Came out really thick, had to thin it out with about 1/4 cup milk, or it was as thick as mayo. Anyway, this is a great alternative to Ranch (which I can't stand), because its nice and creamy. Its also very flavorful and easy to make.

Tasty!!  I will never buy dressing at the store again.  My only complaint is that I thought it was a tad bit too sweet.  Easy fix, though:).  Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely perfect!  I love creamy italian, but never really found one that was exactly how I wanted it until this recipe.  I used low fat mayo and it still came out just right.  Thanks for the delicious recipe what will be used again and again!

I used this with pasta salad, and I must say the dressing got better (and thicker) as it sat. At first it tasted strongly of onions and was quite thin. After a while in the fridge it became thicker and settled in flavor. It was pretty good on our pasta salad, but I would probably use less onion next time. I used red onion, and I would do that again, just use less of it.

This was delicious. I made it with basalmic vinegar just because that's what I had we were out of red wine vinegar, and it turned out really well as is. I made a double batch and used some for a pasta salad, and it was a hit. I will definately use this recipe again.

I just made this for a family get together we are having tomorrow, and I am disappointed.  It tastee very sweet and onion-y (and I was careful to use just a small amount of onion).  I also could really taste the mayo.  We don't usually eat many creamy dressings, so maybe I am just not used to a creamy dressing taste.  It is also possible that the flavors will come together and it will be better tomorrow. Update- the family all liked it.  I still didn't but I am not an onion fan, so maybe that's the problem.

This is an excellent recipe. It was impressive .  When ready to serve I blended it thru the salad rather than on top.  I used it on romaine  lettuce and added grape tomatoes, black olives and onions. I served it with Italian chicken and pasta.

I used half mayo and half fat free yogurt, worked great. Otherwise kept to the recipe. Definitely need to let it sit overnight before using. Too sweet for my tastes, and I think I would like more vinegar, but otherwise I thought it was good. Will try again with some tweaking.

Excellent as written.  Too oniony - no way, just follow instructions.  I bumped up the Italian seasoning to 1 tsp and the pepper to 1/4 tsp for personal taste.  Very good, very easy, will be keeping this in the fridge at all times.

Our family recently started a new diet that does not include any artificials or preservatives and have been looking for a really good salad dressing.  I am so glad that I finally found this one!  It is sooo good!  That is absolutely wonderful.  We use it on salads, the kids dip chips in it, it has many uses in our house!  Thank you so much for sharing!

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out really good.  I was impressed, but my husband and I thought it was too sweet.  The only thing I would change is to add a little less sugar, I might only add 2 teaspoons next time and see how that works.

Excellent.   I made it as directed - maybe using a little more (homemade) Italian seasoning a called for. :) This makes a wonderfully thick, creamy dressing.  If you would like a thinner dressing, add buttermilk until desired consistency.Thanks for posting!!

Mmmmm! This dressing was just delicious. I followed the recipe as written, and it didn't need a thing changed.  I definitely recommend using the onion (a half of a small mild one), because it adds so much flavor.  Even my husband and son (who have very different tastes and both picky) loved it!

I think this should be called Creamy Onion Dressing.  If you really like the taste of raw onion, I'm sure you will love this dressing!  Unfortunately I do not.  I used about 1/4 cup of a white onion, and it was waaaay to strong for my liking.

Hey Cathy, New to the site but been around the culinary world for quite awhile, this is one of the simple basic recipes that really hits home, I substituted the onion with a 1/4 shallot.  Thank you! Fred

Great recipe and very versatile.  I make it all the time for at-home salads.  I save myself from having to wash out a blender by just mixing the ingredients in a cup and leaving out the onion. Voila; instant italian!

I made it per the instructions and the set of tips that Cathy posted afterwards and really enjoyed it.

I ended up using Splenda rather than regular sugar and I added a little more vinegar to taste and tried to be conservative with the (yellow) onion.

Unbelievably good!!  I just made it a few minutes ago because every dressing in my fridge looked incredibly unappetizing.  This was just perfect.  I eased up on the onion, only because I didn't have much, as well as the red wine vinegar.  I also used 1/2 c light mayo and 1/2 miracle whip light because that was all I had.  Really fantastic stuff!  Thanks!

Cathy, I use this dressing a LOT because I can never find a creamy Italian dressing that I like.  I think it's perfect the way it is (being Italian), especially if you follow the directions. My mother used to make it this way and I just never watched her close enough.  Thanks for sharing!  PS--those I haved served it to for dinners absolutely love it!

Good basic recipe. I don't like my dressing so tangy so next time I will reduce the red wine vinegar to less than half. Usw whatever combiation of herbs you have on hand if you don't have italian seasoning. I used parsley, thyme, rosemary, and oregano. Add the sugar gradually to your liking.

I made this and brought it to an office luncheon yesterday and it was a big hit.  Everyone wanted the recipe!  I took the recipe writer's suggestion and used about 1/4 cup chopped of a mild white onion and we didn't find the onion taste overpowering at all.  I will keep this recipe in by recipe box for sure!

really, really good. i sent the onion through the grating blade on my food processor and then switched blades before adding the rest of the ingredients. it really minced the onion, almost liquified some of it. i used it in a pasta salad with olives, tomatoes, grated carrots, and cheddar cheese. the boyfriend loved it too!

I would just like to say I am a salad dressing freak and was just making a salad for a party i have to go to tomorrow and ran out of my usual dressing and just decided to try something a bit different and came across your recipe and decided to try it as i had all the ingridients needed.
I always make my own salad dressings but dont usually make creamy ones.
This dressing is fantastic! I loved it!
so much so i kept licking the blender once i bottled it!!
Great recipe Cathy!! two thumbs up from a huge salad dressing critic!

I followed this recipe to the letter.  It was not as creamy as the creamy Italian dressings I like in restaurants, but this was not a deal breaker for me.  The dressing was lightly sweet and had a good flavor, but it did not have enough of the "tang" that I love in creamy Italian.  I think more spices are needed, or perhaps less sugar.  This was a good dressing, but I will keep looking for that perfect recipe.

This was really good. My daughter who doesn't usually like creamy salad dressings asked for this again the next day.  I refrigerated for a full day prior to serving to allow the flavors to blend fully. It has a good mild italian taste. Yum!

I followed the instructions exact and found it tasted too much like onion and vinegar. I think both need to be decreased a bit. You can always add the rest if you think it's needed but you can't take out!

Delicious!  I omitted the onion and changed 3/4 tsp italian seasoning to 1 tsp italian seasoning plus 1/2 tsp pizza seasoning.  Also I used homemade mayonnaise.  It was so good!  Even my 2-year-old couldn't get enough of it on her sandwich and carrots.

I substituted Splenda for the sugar and left out the onion so that I would have 0 carbs in my dressing.  IT WAS GREAT!!! I love it.  The only reason I gave it a 3 for the kid friendly area is because I have not tested on children. Thanks Cathy.

Hubby and I loved it. Added a little extra fresh Italian herb mix and a pinch of fresh garlic, will definitely make again! Like the recipe says, don't use garlic salt, there's a difference between gralic salt and garlic powder. I used fresh minced garlic myself.  And yes, watch the onion. I used a mild yellow onion, and only half of one.

This was a keeper. My husbands exact words "This was AMAZING!" I made a few changes or should I say added. I added a little minced garlic for a bit more texture and garlic flavor, we are a huge garlic lovin' family. I was all out of fresh onion so I used dried minced onion and soaked it in the red vinegar to dehydrate the onion. Added a splash of white vinegar and about a teaspoon more of red wine vinegar. That was all and then I stuck it in the fridge to meld. Plan on using the dressing for chicken bow tie pasta salad. Which I might try adding some grated parmasan to the dressing. But this was a great recipe. I also didn't blend it. I just mixed it with a spoon until well mixed. I am not into cleaning up extra dishes.

Wow! Just made this and before the flavors have even had a chance to meld it tastes fantastic, like I can’t stop licking the scraper and bowl. The only adjustment I made was switching the sugar for 2 drops of liquid Stevia. Perfecto! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I made this recipe as written, and boy, was it good!  My daughter needed a dish to pass for a birthday party, so she helped & made a large veggie pasta salad.  It's also good as a dip for veggies, hot wings & over baked potatoes.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I LOVE THIS DRESSING! I am on a low carb diet so I used full fat mayo and stevia instead of the sugar. This is by far our favorite dressing! We especially love to put it on top of a healthy green salad with some cut rotiserie chicken and chopped eggs added! This is our go to dressing!! kudos!!!

Fantastic recipe. I cut the sugar down just a tad, and used raw minced garlic and added a capful of raw AC vinegar along with the red wine vinegar. Great recipe, and we use it on homemade hoagies.

This is my update from the 3/4 rating I gave it. My initial rating was that it was thick and just not tasty.  I decided to make it in the morning for a 2pm Eagle Scout event, therefore, it only set for four hours. Like other reviewers said, letting it set overnight really will make it delicious.  It is thick, so thinning it out might be better for some, like me.  It is dangerously delicious :)!!

I loved this, but because I made a change (a necessary one, IMHO), I didn’t give it five stars. I made it as directed, but reduced the sugar to one teaspoon. I started with one, intending to add more if it needed it, but it was just perfect without the extra two teaspoons of sugar. The flavors really pop. We used the whole recipe on 6 dinner salads.

It was good, but really- for us, too thick. I added 4 Tablespoons of milk & the consistency was better.
I also added 2 Tablespoons of fresh Parsley. This cut down the richness and brought a brighter flavor to it.
I will definitely make this recipe again with the minor adjustments I made.
Thankyou!

I’ve made this recipe several times for years. The onion does reflect the taste. I followed the recipe to the tee and always receive rave reviews. I was out of onion so I substituted with  1/2 cup shallots. Usually I use the 1/2 small onion (sweet onion).  Even though it altered the flavor, the shallots brought I milder taste, yet still wonderful. Just served it with iceberg lettuce.  Every time I make I run out of salad.

Absolutely divine straight out of the food processor.  I'm licking my fingers and spatula.  Used 1/2 cup fresh sweet Vidalia onion and even without sitting and marrying flavors it's not oniony at all.  I added a pinch on red pepper flakes so I can tell the difference at a glance between the ranch and Italian dressing in the fridge.  Excellent recipe!

I discovered this recipe just in time for summer!   Not only is it delicious on fresh green salad, it's also my new favorite sandwich spread.  I'm also going to add it to my next pasta salad, in place of some of the mayo - it'll definitely add some zing.  A friend who tried some and fell in love with it thinks it'll be a prefect veggie dip, too!  (I sent him home with a little jar and your recipe ;)  Great, easy-to-make, multi-purpose dressing.  thanks, Cathy!

Oh I was looking for this  dressing,  many thanks to post it.  I made it several times but to my surprise it works sometimes perfectly and sometimes its little off ! The reason I figured out is you have to be careful with the onion , if you put more onion than the right amount this recipe doesnt work well.  The  recipe calls for small onion but you pick small onion 10 times  you will get 10 different size/amount.  If the author can give precise onion amount in tsp or tbs that would be highly appreciable.

Love it!! The only change I made was I omitted the garlic powder and used a fresh clove of garlic. Letting it refrigerate overnight really makes a big difference as it does allow the flavors to blend. No more store bought for my family! I’m afraid I would have a riot on my hands!

I loved this dressing!  I followed the recipe for the most part.  The only change, since I had no onion, was to sub 1 teaspoon of onion powder . Other than that I followed the recipe as written.  No more bottled dressing for this household.

This salad dressing was pretty good.  It wasn't" knock my socks off good". but I liked it.  I read the review of Cathy who posted the recipe and I agree with her about making the dressing as the recipe calls for before you start posting bad reviews.  When I made it just as the recipe calls for it tasted a little too sweet for me and I like sweet.  I put it in the refrigerator until I wanted to use it tonight and the extra sweet taste was gone.  If anyone is thinking of making it I'd go ahead and give it a try.

Wonderful as written. I didn't change anything and thought it was very good. For my personal taste I think I will try it with less sugar next time. Thank you for a great dressing recipe.

I made a few changes and it was perfect for us. I left out the salt, switched 1/4 of a cup of mayo for sour cream, and only used 1/4 of small onion.

Perfect as written. Just for my taste added 1/2 T more red wine vinegar.  Very good. Better after few hours in fridge.

My brother in law claimed to hate Italian dressings of all kind until I made this. Now he requests it. Go easy on the sugar (you can always add more, but can't take away) and add fresh herb if you have it- a small amount goes a long way.

Followed exactly except for the Italian seasoning which we don't keep. We put some fresh basil, oregano and thyme in the blender.   Omg it was great   So thanks for the recipe and it was great on steamed veggies too

I just made this and used it immediately. I know it may  be better the next day but, it was still delicious to me. The only change I made was to add a little olive oil and splash more vinegar as it was really thick and burning up my blender. Otherwise I made it as written and, thought it was delicious!

Made as written.  A terrific creamy Italian salad dressing!  For those who changed the recipe, it would no longer be this recipe.  One either likes or doesn't like.  Me?  This is perfect as written without any ingredient standing out on it's own.

I made a couple changes, but I'm so happy for this recipe because it was a huge hit with everyone I had over for memorial day. I did not pay attention to the amount of Italian seasoning amount, so I added too much! What I did to dilute it was to add a half regular size container of sour cream and add another tablespoon of sugar. I didn't put onion in it. But, I will next time definitely. And, there will be a next time. It's our new favorite dressing. I even mimicked the recipe for chicken salad as well. My husband couldn't stop eating it! Also, people might think it's fattening or whatever, but what salad dressing isn't? On top of that, at least you know what's in the dressing!

LOVE this dressing! I made it about a year ago as a vegan dressing for a friend's veggie pasta salad. Vegans and non-vegans alike loved it. I now make it, non-vegan, exactly as the recipe calls for, but I like a little more bite so I also add at least a half of a shallot. Absolutely amazing! It's on my permanent dressing list. Thank you! :-)

This is a great recipe. I added just a little less than half cup of Vidalia onion and a little less than the amount ofsugar called for in the recipe.

i know most hate when someone totally changes a recipe & then rates it.  but i have to give credit to the chef posting, this was a winner winner.  changes: i dislike mayo (use organic or make my own but still really dislike the flavour) so i subbed yogurt...we have a sublime company that makes organic greek yogurt, i put a teaspoon of mayo in as well, a bulb of organic garlic, & the herbs,  & some red pepper flakes, hot sauce.  let it sit for a day---& it was fabulous.  thank you so much.

I agree ...it isn't helpful to rate the dressing if you are not following the recipe by the author.  I made this tonight,  it was excellent.  I made a change, instead of onion, i used a little onion powder, only because i needed a small batch, so I wanted to whisk instead.  I'm positively sure blending w onions would be delicious.   When i need a large batch, I will definitely use my blender.  For itslian spice, I used oregano and basil.

It's good but it's too sweet for my taste. I will probably make it again but cut the sugar back by a teaspoon or so.

As is, it gets 4 stars but you can tweek it some.  I recommend cutting back on the sugar 25% and use a Vidalia onion.  Also Balsamic vinegar seems to work better than red wine vinegar.  I added 2 tbsp. parmigiano reggiano cheese to give it a more robust flavor.  Do yourself a favor and make your own Italian seasoning, that way if you want a little more basil and less oregano or tarragon you can make your own adjustment to the seasoning.

My husband loved this!  I made it exactly like the recipe except my red wine vinegar was pomegranate infused.  I was careful not to use too much onion so I measured 1/2 cup.  I used lite real mayo.  It made quite a bit  so saved the leftovers for later this week.

I love this dressing, as does everyone who tries it. I switch between light and regular mayo - both work well. I'm generous with the seasonings and typically add a tad extra sugar to taste. My immersion blender mixes it perfectly. Just delicious. Thanks so much for the great recipe!

I made this for the first time tonight and followed the recipe exactly. I did not make any changes at all and it was amazing! Perfect with our salad on a hot night.  This will be a staple in our house from now on. It wasn't too thick or too runny. I used my food processor to blend it and stored it in a glass dressing bottle. My husband loved it!

I'm officially changing the name of this to "Awesome Sauce" because that's what it is! Here's a tip, I made this on the fly and all I had was red onion. That's why it turned out pink! If you are put off by the color then you'd better follow the recipe to a T!

I just made this for the first time and used it right away. I can already tell this is going to be a favorite in our house, and I know it will be better after the flavors meld. The only change was  white wine vinegar - didn't have the red. And I know my onions are feisty, so I cut back on them. I love making my own salad dressings because I can control what goes in them. Thanks, Cathy, for a winner!

The first time I made this, I was looking for something to mimick a dressing at a restaurant that I love. I used it on an Italian salad with salami, artichokes, black olives, garbanzo beans, red onion, cucumber, & tomato. I thought it was SO good! It was gone in a week! I made it again today with a few tweaks: I used apple cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar, added in a bit of buttermilk to thin it just a tad, about 2 TBSP each of red and green peppers,  I was more heavy handed with the spices and added some smoked paprika. BOOM! So great! So happy I can now create this salad at home!

This dressing received mixed reviews in my house. I thought the flavor was good, although it did have a strong onion flavor.  I did only use about 1/2 cup of onion as suggested by the recipe author in her review.   The only thing I didn't like was that it was very thin and didn't cling to the salad. It was just slightly thicker than milk.  I used a good quality mayonnaise, so, I don't know if my onion had quite a bit of juice in it, but, it definitely needed to be thicker for my taste.  My husband didn't like the dressing at all.  He thought it had too strong of a onion flavor, was too sweet, & didn't taste like a creamy Italian dressing at all.   I might try again, but, use less onion and sugar.

I've made this dressing several times now & we all love it! I used a milder onion as suggested & it did not overpower the dressing. I love that this recipe is easy to make & the ingredients are things you usually have on hand. Simple yet full of flavor!

THIS IS DELISH!!..I think it deserves 5 stars but with the few minor changes, I had to give it 4...I only used half the sugar and half the vinegar...I stirred well then put in mason jar in fridge to let set...was perfect texture...I think maybe the blender would make it a little too liquid.

I decided to try a quick pasta salad and wanted a creamy Italian dressing. I really had no idea if there was such a thing having only used the typical one. I decided to search "Allrecipes" and was surprised and pleased to come across this one.  I made it according to the recipe and was so happy with the outcome that I quickly shared it with my sister and both of my daughters! It really was my kind of recipe: few ingredients, easy and delicious! Thank you Cathy for sharing!!!

Love this dressing.  Making salad dressings from scratch is still relatively new to me, but this one is a keeper and we have made it three times already since we first tried it about a month ago.  Love being able to avoid the preservatives etc. in store-bought bottled dressings.  So far we have made as written (except once when I accidentally used too much onion), but plan on trying soon with minced garlic instead of garlic powder.  Definitely note Cathy's 10/10/2003 comment stating that onion should be about 1/2 cup.  And sweet, of course.  Thanks, Cathy!

REALLY good. I did of course change it some.
I used homemade mayo, didn't add sugar, used a red onion, and used Italian Dressing Mix (minus the sugar in it) on this website for the Italian seasoning.
Very delicious! This will def be a regular item in our house.. maybe with some feta cheese thrown in there every once in a while :D

Terrific dressing!  I used a smaller amount of Splenda instead of sugar and used reconstituted dried onions as I had no sweet fresh onion.  Very tasty & extremely easy.

Small is so relative a term- I think the recipe needs onion, but start with a little and maybe add if needed. 
I used whole garlic, two bulbs the first time, one the second. I think the onion and garlic are what makes it yummy but be careful it is not too overpowering. It benefits from being made in advanced. Work with it to your taste. 
This rating is not based on store dressings- I don't know any good store dressings. But it has been a great find in my house, easy and quick, a keeper!

Overall it was a decent recipe, however, next time I am going to half the onion as it was overpowering in my opinion.

It was amazingly good! I tried it EXACTLY as written and couldn't have asked for a more perfect blend of spices.  You can add it to pasta for a cold pasta salad or just a dip.  After only a few minutes of completion, it was so tasty.  I think when the onions and garlic powder start to really work their magic, it will get even more flavorful.

I halved the recipe, since there's just 2 of us and wanted to be able to use it up in a couple of days.  Used a small clove of garlic instead of powder and added about a tablespoon of grated Parmesan cheese.  Used my immersion blender to mix it up.  We really liked it!

Really like this creamy italian. I used onion powder because I just wanted to mix it by hand.  That was really the only change I made. I suppose you could sub other vinegars or lemom juice. It was pretty thick and probably could be thinned a little with milk, olive oil etc. So many possibilities. Will def. make again and again Thanks Kathy!

I was in need of a Creamy Italian Dressing without garlic, and this was very good. Of course it would be better with the garlic but what's a hostess to do when a guest has an allergy.

I did not care for this recipe. I used fresh homemade mayonnaise and followed the recipe exactly. Perhaps it comes out better with commercial mayonnaise, though that wasn't specified in the recipe.

Looking for a last minute recipe, I happened to have everything on hand, so I gave it a shot. From the search engine screen, there was part of a review, raving about fabulous and perfectly proportioned ingredients. I have to agree. Sensational! Everyone loved it when I made it on Mother's Day, yesterday! Including my mother-in-law. :) It's now written in my family recipe book! Love it! Thanks for sharing it!

I have made this for up to 80 people and they seek me out to ask what they had just eaten on their salad.
It is my signature dressing!

So easy to make, I supervised while my 5yo put together all the ingredients.  She was so proud to have done it "all by herself"!  Used all organic products.  The only change I made was raw agave for sugar, to accomodate a family allergy. Delicious! Definitely a "keeper' recipe!

Fantastic. I've been searching for a good creamy italian since the manufacturer discontinued my favorite brand. After the  many failed attempts I was a little wary about trying this recipe so I halved it. My family loved it so much I'll need to make a double batch next time. THANK YOU

Very good!! I’m glad I tried this one!  I served this on a simple salad of mixed greens, chopped green onions, some specialty strawberry tomatoes (they look sort of like strawberries), and my homemade croutons.  I chopped my onion very finely because I didn’t use a blender, just whisked the ingredients together.  I also cut the sugar back to 1 t.  I served this with the Recipe Group recipe for this week, Crispy Italian Chicken Topped with Mozzarella, which was a nice pairing.  I’ll be making this one again!

We enjoyed this, but I do feel that something was missing. Mybe some more vinegar or extra spices? I can't put my finger on it, but I definately plan to play around with it and suit it more to my family's tastes. Mine came out quite thick, so I just added a little milk to thin it out a bit and that worked out fine. Like I said, this was good, and I plan to play around with it more. Thanks for sharing. :)

It's been years since I have had Italian dressing, but I needed some for another recipe on this site, so I figured I would give this a try.  It is pretty good.  I used half as small yellow onion and it was not at all oniony as one reviewer had mentioned - perhaps they used a larger onion than I did.  The only alteration I made was to sub 1/2 tsp minced garlic for the garlic powder.  That seems like a nice amount, you can taste the garlic but it is not overpowering.  I am looking forward to seeing how it tastes after it has rested overnight and allowed the flavors to mingle, but as of now, I am pretty pleased with the recipe, it gave me what I expected and needed, although it did not knock my socks off.

I just made this for a pasta salad because I was out of dressing. I followed the directions exactly, except for adding a little more pepper simply because we are pepper people. I was delicous and great on the pasta salad. Thanks for the recipe!

Really good and easy to make.  I made two changes because of my diet: 1) I used agave syrup in place of the sugar since I don't eat sugar and 2) I replaced the mayo with sour cream because I don't eat canola oil BUT this was really good and I'm adding it to my salad dressing rotation.  Thanks for the recipe.

Sensational!!  Kind of combined this recipe with another Creamy Italian Dressing recipe on this site.  But used this as the base.  Followed to a T as written, then added 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 tsp dried oregano & about a 1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese.  Simply delicious!!

This was a great salad dressing. I used a shallot instead of an onion because I felt an onion might be too strong for my taste.  I also added 1/4 cp of fresh shredded parmesean cheese because I add cheese to everything.  It is my favorite dressing and so easy to make!

This turned out fabulous.  Make sure you follow Cathy's advice (the first comment) re: onions.  I used 1/2 C. chopped sweet onion and it turned out perfectly - not bitter or overly sharp.  In fact, my onion was so sweet that I didn't need the sugar and had to add a little lemon juice to cut it . . . So make sure you taste it before sweetening.  Otherwise followed recipe exactly, using homemade mayo instead of store-bought.  My husband says this is the best dressing ever and it really livens up a dinnertime salad (especially if used on dark greens with red/orange peppers).  Also makes a very good veggie dip!

UPDATE: MADE THIS FOR THE 2ND TIME (ENTERTAINED AGAIN!). MY GUESTS LOVED IT!!! This was great! I was making dinner for a guest (and my fiance) a couple of weeks ago and could not find a salad recipe I wanted to make; the ones I found were too labor-intensive - I was running errands all weeekend and didn't have much spare time to spend in the kitchen making any of them). Since I had bought a bagged salad mix the week prior, this was perfect! I was able to use up something that would have otherwise gone to waste AND my dinner guest LOVED this!!! Prep couldn't be easier too (I didn't even have to chop my onion!). My only regret is that I only mde half the recipe (I only had 1/2 cups worth of mayo left in the fridge) lol! :-( Other than adding a little milk to thin to my liking (as is, this is very thick - almost too thick, IMHO), I made no other changes. If it weren't for the thickness issue, I would have given 5 stars, but tastewise, this is certainly deserving of the most superb rating. I think this would be an excellent dip for veggies as is. Thanks for sharing! :-)

A nice way to change up your salad. It's similar to my favorite dressing at the neighborhood Italian restaurant. I had to sub dried minced onion but it still turned out fine. I would try real onion next time and I bet it would be even better.

I'm giving this 4 stars because the onion I had was very strong. I used a 1/2 a very small white onion and the taste was so over powering but I think I bought a very strong onion because I used the other 1/2 in the food I was making and that also had a really strong onion flavor. I cried while cutting the onion so bad I had to stop and walk outside. My boyfriends mother also walked outside because it was making her eyes water also. I plan to make this again and hope I get a good mild onion this time! Other then the problem with the onion everyone loved the dressing and asked me to make it again. p.s. can you give me a suggestion on how to pick out a good onion, I always buy the plain white onions and have never had any problems with them being so strong. Thanks

Just made this and it tastes fabulous right out of the blender.  If it wasn't so dangerous I would have licked the blades.  Can't wait to see how much better it gets after refrigerating!

I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars! OMG, it is so delicious!  I will never buy store bought Italian dressing again! I used chopped Vidalia onion, which is mild and sweet, and only 1T. of white wine vinegar because I didn't have the red kind plus a splash of Worcestershire sauce (W-sauce).  Fantastic on salads and even as a dip with fresh veggies.  The key is to let it refrigerate overnight.  Thanks millions Cathy!

This was awesome!  I did what another user did and grated the onion into the blender with all the other ingredients.  It is so flavorful that you don't need a lot on your salad, thus cutting some calories.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I make  chicken tacos with store bought creamy Italian dressing, but from now on I will use this instead.  I made it exactly as written and love it! For my tacos I may try it with half mayo and half yogurt to cut the fat a little.  Thanks for sharing.

This dressing is easy and different. I accidentally put too much pepper in, so I added a tbsp of olive oil to mellow it out, and it was good that way. Used low fat mayo and it was still plenty creamy. Thanks!

I didn't have Italian Seasoning, used a bit of Rosemary and more oregano from the cupboard.  I added about 1/4 cup of fresh basil from our garden.  I added a bit more vinegar and a bit more sugar for our taste.  We ate this over chopped cucumbers and cherry tomatoes from the garden as well -- yum!

I loved it.  I used non-fat yogurt instead of mayo, and cut the sugar by just a little bit, and it was great.  Very good for you and lots of flavor!

Delicious!  Even a friend who hates onions raved about it- then I told her there were onions in it!  I used Mayan sweet, and since my onion was medium, I used about a third of it.  I will make this again and again.

I did scale this down to make only 4 servings (which was really only 2) and i used miracle whip instead of mayo.  other then that, i followed the recipe exactly.  At first it tasted way to   mayo-ee for me so i added another two tsp of red wine vinegar, some lemon juice, and a little bit of EVOO to thin it out. Very good! Thanks Cathy!

I've never made homemade dressing before, but this turned out great!  I used my food processor to mix all the ingredients, but I wasn't able to get the onion quite as finely chopped as I'd like (my food processor has limited attachments).  Maybe a blender would be better.

We followed the recipe exactly.  This was very good.  We put it on a basic tossed salad with head lettuce and a bit of romaine.  It is a bit sweet.

This was good, but the vinegar made it a bit sharp for my clan. I didn't have the time for the blender, so I added 2 T. of minced dried onion. A teaspoon of basil added a nice touch. Update: I made this again, but this time used the food processor. It was excellent, creamy and tasty and not sharp at all. Only make this if you have the time to do it right.

Excellent!  No more store bought in this house!  Came out a little thick so I added a tablespoon or so of water.  Wonderful - can't wait to try it on sandwiches, pasta salads etc.

I didn't have any lettuce, but spooned some over canned artichoke hearts (in water, not marinated).  I literally licked the plate afterward.  This dressing is so good.  Oh, and I used about 1/2 cup of green onions because that's all I had...I highly recommend using them!

Made this as written.  This dressing is so simple to make yet so tasty.  

I used the herbes de provence of the Reflets de France line (we got it from a friend).  I dont think it is too expensive but the company uses good ingredients to make the product it seems.  

Anyhow, the dressing was very good with just a few ingredients, I will be making this creamy dressing (instead of the store bought ones) from now on.

I made this just yesterday and felt it was way to heavy on the red wine vinegar..that is all we tasted. I did like the consistency and the flavor of the herbs...probably won't make it again though.

Excellent dressing recipe. Anytime I am asked to bring a salad to a cookout, this dressing is always requested. I also have tried shallots in stead of the onion and it turned out reaaly good also. Definite keeper!
