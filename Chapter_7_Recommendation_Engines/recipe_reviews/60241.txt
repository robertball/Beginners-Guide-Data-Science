I used 2 cans of cinnamon rolls from ALDI, unrolled them, separated into 4 strands, braided them together and formed the braids into a ring.  I'm from New Orleans and usually make one from scratch.  This was the BEST kingcake we've ever had!!!  I used the icing that came with the cinnamon rolls and sprinkled colored sugar.  AWESOME!  My kids are so happy to have fresh king cake in IL!

I'm just wondering what the correct dough is? Is there a name brand you can recommend? I plan on making this later this week and I want it to come out right :-) Thanks!

It is so frustrating to read a review where the individual didn't follow the directions and cries fowl when it doesn't come out right.

I followed this recipe exactly as shown, with the correct sweet dough, and it came out great.  I will certainly make it again.  It is so much cheaper than ordering through a real NOL bakery to have sent up the East Coast!

I had to make 5 cakes for a Mardi Gras party.  This cake tasted great and is easy.  I only cooked my cake for 30 minutes as I burned the first one at 40 minutes so make sure you really watch it like the recipe says.  The only thing I changed was that I used only one can of frosting and then I just used colored sugars to make the pretty colors. It was going to cost me $20 a cake at the bakery and I estimate that I spent about $8 a cake. I will make again.

This is the 2nd year I have made it for Mardi Gras. Usually I am person who bakes everything from scratch, but l was short on time last year and had never been to NO much less made a king cake before so I gave this a try and it was so good I made it again this year. The recipe didn't specify, so I used Pillsbury orange sweet rolls because I thought it sounded more New Orleans (not that I have any idea, prob it is not) and I really think the orange added to it and made it hard to tell it was from a can versus plain old cinnamon rolls, though you can use them if you don't like orange. I lightly molded them together to form a ring and baked for 20-30 min. NOT 50-60. Keep an eye on it so it doesn't burn! These rolls come with their own icing, which I think is plenty. For me 2 cans would be too much. The orange-flavored icing is good but because it has a pale yellow-orange color to it the food coloring for the purple is a little tricky. Last year I followed the directions on the back of the food coloring box which calls for more red than blue. Bad idea, it turned out brownish. Instead stay true to this recipe and use equal amounts red and blue (I used 3 of each). Great recipe. I would not have thought of it. Thanks a lot!

This recipe was super easy and the cake turned out beautifully! I also was unsure about the type of dough to use and would appreciate a note of clarity from the author(or anyone else who has made this). I used canned cinnamon rolls and pressed them into a tube pan. I was unable to do any weaving like the recipe stated but the results were very nice. I found that 2 cans of icing were way too much and I will only use one can next time. One reviewer stated that one of the tradtional King Cake colors is purple. You can buy Neon Food Colors that has a bottle of purple. I will be making this again!

My sister and I wanted to have a Mardi Gras party for our girls, and this cake was the perfect way to make things cheap and simple.  I bought 3 cans of cinnamon roll dough from the refrigerated section of the store (with the pizza doughs, crescent rolls, and refrigerated cookie doughs).  

I just unrolled the strands in each can (mine came in about 6 strands), smashed them together, folded in half and rolled a little.  I repeated this with each can, shaped the 3 logs into a ring and smooshed those together, twisted them a little bit, and then baked.  It only took me 25 minutes to bake, so do watch the time carefully (I know my oven is a little hotter than most, but I think 50-60 min. might burn for most people).  I forgot to cover with foil, but will do so next time.  

I used the icing that came with the cinnamon rolls, and added food coloring to the 3 tubs of icing to make green, yellow, and purple.  I cut a hole in the bottom of the cake, stuck the baby in and filled it back up and iced over the bottom (which did make things messy!)  I didn't do as neat a job as I could have, but we were just having fun.

Everyone raved about this cake (more so than when I bake from scratch...ahem!).  The kids had a blast with it and want to make another cake again soon.  I think this cake does not have to be limited to Mardi Gras--my sister said she would like to make this for a brunch (minus the food coloring and plastic baby, of course!).

Thanks for the great idea!

This makes a great king cake! To get purple, mix the blue and red colors like the recipe explains. I've used both the sweet orange roll dough and generic cinnamon roll dough to make this, and both cake out great. Everyone loves eating it, and it looks great too. Toppings: I colored vanilla whipped frosting with gold and purple (red+blue) food coloring, and then used green sugar sprinkles for a most festive look. THANKS FOR A GREAT AND TIME-SAVING KING CAKE!

This really was super easy. I've only made King Cake from scratch once prior to this cake and I would have to say this cake is easier and tasted better. I didn't understand the directions very well so I just layed the 18 cinnamon buns upright in a tight circle. Cooked and decorated as directed but added colored turbinado sugar. It was beautiful! Served with Colleen's Slow Cooker Jambalaya, Cajun Dirty Rice, and corn on the cob for Mardi Gras/Fat Tuesday 2012.

will have to 'do-over' with regards to constructing the cake... i was short on time and read reviews where the person just mushed it together and rolled it out. i thought i would try my version of that. when they baked, they separated. i will try to unroll and braid when i have more time. i like A LOT of icing {esp to hide the separation of the rolls} but i still only used one can of icing, and had a bit leftover. i choose to use crystal sprinkles instead of tinting icing--- HIGHLY RECOMMEND... so much easier and it seems pretty authentic looking to me! can't wait to dig in and taste... {4 stars because directions weren't as clear as i think they could have been regarding construction, but that could just be me!}

This recipe was great! Why go spend a lot of money on a premade King Cake when you can make a tastier and cheaper one at home?? This is a keeper for sure. I used the Pillsbury Cinnamon Twists..it came with icing and I did not use food coloring, only the colored sugared sprinkles. Tasted great! Will definitely make again!

Just like the name says, this recipe is super easy!  I've never tried to braid dough so I wasn't sure if that part would be difficult, but decided to try.  Braiding the dough was a cinch!  I used 2 cans of cinnamon rolls & 1 can of orange rolls.  I used the icing that came with the rolls as well as a bit of vanilla frosting, colored them, and drizzled them over the cake.  Took it to Bible study and everyone gobbled it up especially my pastor who is a Louisiana native.  Everyone thought it was homemade & asked for the recipe.  I kept my secret though!  :)

This is such a fun recipe!  I made it for our Saints Superbowl celebration.  Only needed 1 tub of frosting and cinnamon rolls like other reviews have said.  I added in 3T of milk to the tub of frosting and I only used sprinkles because I cannot find food coloring anywhere!  Loved it!  Side note:  If you have leftovers, cut yourself a slice and heat it up in the microwave for 15-20 seconds.  Yummy!

Easy to make with children. Don't by Pillsbury cinnamon rolls unless you want to roll all of them out.

I just made this for Mardi Gras in Los Angeles.  I used 2 cans Pillsbury Cinnabon rolls and they include a little container of frosting in the end of the can.  Plenty to spread around.  I just placed the buns together on a cookie sheet in a wreath shape.  Fast and easy!  Keep an eye on them.  It took about 10 min to cook.

Since the picture shows the traditional colors, I'm guessing that you mix the colors to come up with purple.

What a fun and super easy way to brighten up a routine day at work or at school.  I made 3 of these cakes for 'Fat Tuesday 2014'.  My hubby took 1 to work and I took the other 2 to school.  Everyone loved it! I used 2 cans of cinnamon rolls and 1 can of orange rolls.  I separated the rolls, braided them and formed a ring.  They baked at the 350° but they only took 17 minutes to bake.  To frost, I used the icing packet that came with the rolls and added some 'Grocery Store Frosting' from AR to the mix and added food color gel.  I hid a plastic baby in each cake before they were iced.  I printed the story that goes along with the history behind the cake and warned people to look for the baby before eating their piece.  A fun day that was enjoyed by all, and as easy as this was, I will surly make them again next year! Thanks, BUDDHAFULDREAMER for sharing your recipe.

This is awesome! I was looking to do something different for a baby shower and this was perfect! I used 3 cans of cinnamon roll dough, smooshed it together & Rolled it out on waxed paper.  I baked just until firm and  then drizzled icing over it! Delicious! Thank you!

Sorry, it was lumpy. These rolls are precut and not made to be unwound.  I was hoping they might taste better than the last time I tried them several years ago.  Nope, still artificial. Give this recipe a pass and patronize your local bakery.

I made this last night for a Mardi Gras party, and it was a huge hit!  Was easy to make and looked really great with the colored icings and sparkly green and gold sprinkles that I added.  Everyone had fun looking for the babies - I put 2 in mine.  I used canned whipped white icing with milk added to thin it, and it tasted great.  Thanks for this easy and fun recipe.

Worked out great! Instead of drizziling the frosting all over, I did sections of the colors. I thought it looked prettier

Well, imagine my surprise when I realized that my Pillsbury cinnamon rolls weren't in pinwheels like they used to be. I should have read more of the reviews to see that others just rolled their dough together and formed the ring. We just made king cake rolls and colored the icing that comes with the rolls and sprinkled a little clear sugar crystals on top. Kids enjoyed it and we had fun. We were making it just for us so no big deal. Kinda reminded me of monkey bread. I liked the idea of making ourselves b/c my main complaint with store bought ones were that they were too dry and way too much sugar and icing on top. I know, that's the point but I'm trying not to turn everyone in my family into diabetics if I can help it!!

I love this! Being from Louisiana I missed having a king cake in California. Everywhere here was charging an arm and a leg so I'm so glad I found this recipe. My husband loves it.

Super Easy. I only had 2 cans of cinnamon rolls so I clumped them together into one long roll. I put them in a round cake pan. I didn't need a giant king cake I was just testing it out for myself and the kids. My sons step mom is from new Orleans so he has tried it. I have never had one so I said well lets try to make one. It came out easy. I decorated it in the colors with the frosting that came with the cinnamon rolls. It looks wonderful, it's soft, a little too sugary for breakfast more of a desert cake.

It tastes fine but it just tastes like  canned cinnamon rolls. I should have known better after reading the ingredients.

I made this for the Superbowl and it was a hit!  Great idea for future Mardi-Gras parties as store bought King Cakes in Western MD are unheard of!

They are right that this is super easy, but I took it an extra step further.  I figured why make icing when it already comes with icing.  So, I rolled out 3 long strands of dough with the 3 cans of cinnamon rolls.  I then braided them, and formed them into an oval.  It only needed to bake for about 15-20 minutes.  It came out perfectly cooked!  I let it cool, and then spread the icing onto the top of the cake.  I sprinkled with purple, green, and yellow sprinkles, and then hid the plastic baby.  I decorated with some of my old Mardi Gras beads.  It turned out beautiful, and was very tasty too.

I've used AllRecipes daily for about 5-7 years and I think I've commented on about 3 recipes.  Last year I made another version from scratch (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/8144/mardi-gras-king-cake/?internalSource=similar_recipe_banner&referringId=60241&referringContentType=recipe&clickId=simslot_1) and this year I made this one.  This one was SOOOOO easy and the kids ate the whole thing immediately!  

I used 3 cans of Pillsbury cinnamon rolls and only 1.5 of the included icing.  I just opened the rolls and put them in a bundt cake pan (I couldn't quite figure out the instructions about unrolling them and braiding them - unrolling the rolls would've lost a lot of the cinnamon-y filling).  I baked for about 35-40 minutes (I was kinda just winging it without a timer).  Came out PERFECTLY and was so much easier than starting from scratch.  Thanks!

Did the best I could putting this together.  Tasted like what it was...refrigerated cinnamon biscuit dough. If I ever want to make a King cake again I'll use another recipe and do it from scratch.

It was wonderful, but I have a child that is allergic to red dye, so I had to use yellow, purple, and blue instead. When I did that, nobody knew it was for Mardi Gras.

I had intended to make a King Cake from scratch for a gathering, but time got away from me. With the great reviews this got, I thought I would try this instead, and I'm glad I did. It was tender and delicious.  Based on that alone, it would have gotten five stars.

 To me, the recipe wasn't clear, but based on my understanding of how King Cake looks, it seemed I should have taken the dough in the can and made it into one sheet of dough that could be folded and rolled. I don't know if I used the wrong kind of sweet roll (Food Lion Orange Danish) but it was impossible to make a sheet of dough out of it. I did the best I could, but the strands kept separating. I wound up twisting them into a log, then wound the three logs together into a ring. Based on advice from several reviewers, I lightly covered it with foil for about half the bake time, then removed the foil. I baked it for 25 minutes and it was a perfect golden-brown.

Back when I was trying to mash the dough into sheets, I spread it with a little peach preserves. Couldn't really taste it at the end, but it may have helped keep the dough moist. Also, instead of making purple, green, and gold icing, I used half a can of vanilla icing and mixed it with one of the orange icing packets from the sweet rolls. Af

Haven’t tasted it yet but I could see how it could be good! I used cinniman rolls as my sweet rolls. But bought way too much frosting. I also didn’t roll it properly so it’s a onesie!

Excellent! I’ve made the true-to history cake and simply did not have 1/2 day to devote to a cake. To other reviewers, I followed the recipe, period. hints I provide are based upon environmental factors, humidity, heat and cook time. I live in Hawaii, for those who must compensate, awith the environment can appreciate that For those who prefer orange OR cinnamon rolls, there is a brand (starts with “P”) orange rolls with cinnamon, adding depth and flavor, the end product will NOT taste like canned breakfast rolls. Granted the directions as to how to braid the dough are confusing, I just studied the dough and figured it out on my own.  Open the can of orange cinnamon, 2 sets of 4 strips.  Lay 4 strips on a baking mat, make sure they’re the same length, squish together strips to make one strip. Repeat with remaining 4 strips. Take the 2nd strip and weave over and under twice, you’ll have a braid. Repeat for remaining 2 cans, place 3 “braids” on large cookie sheet, squish ends together to make one circle. Use your hands to make an even circle of braided dough.  I believe varying cook times are dependent upon the size of the finished dough ring. With the type canned rolls I used the ring was 16” diameter. Generic or old-style smaller canned rolls will net a smaller ring.   Use the foil as recommended, Check the ring about halfway through cook time, remove foil, and bake, at least in my set timer for 5+ minutes, not done, another 5+ minutes,

I want to make this but the recipe is hard to follow as far as directions to put this together. But I think I can figure it out.
