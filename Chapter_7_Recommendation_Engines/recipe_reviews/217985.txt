This is a very authentic Puertorrican Mofongo recipe. If you are not from PR will probably not know a few things: The mortar and pestle to be used is made of wood, look in the auction site for "Puerto Rico mortar" and you will find a lot for sale. If you run out of olive oil, the canola oil used for frying can be used as a substitute. In the States you can find Howard's Fried Pork Skin, they are very good for this recipe. When mashing the fried plantain, first add a pinch of salt and 1-2 cloves of garlic to the mortar and mash a little with the pestle, then, one by one, add the plantain chunks and mash. Once you have an homogeneous mixture the mofongo is ready. Run a knife or spatula between the mofongo and the mortar walls, turn the mortar upside down, and bang against the counter top; you will get a nice mofongo dome. Or, push the mofongo against the walls of the mortar, leaving the center hollow, and fill with your favorite seafood stew; eat directly from the mortar...Yummy!!!

Very good!!! I couldn't find the pork rinds so I crisped 3 bacon strips and ground them up. I also put about 1 tsp of butter in the mix together with the olive oil. YUMMMYYYYY

This is delicious but rather labor intensive.  I don't know what sort of mortar & pestle the author of this recipe has, but I found the mashing of the garlic and plaintains difficult in my modestly-sized marble one.  It definitely took more than 15 minutes!  Does she have a LARGE authentic Puerto Rican wooden one (as seen on Man vs. Food)?  The result, however, was wonderful (I ended up using my "boat motor" to puree it).  I made this as my sister's b'day dinner (her request) along with "Camarones al Aijillo."  Would not make again due to the difficuly of preparation, but thanks for sharing just the same.

I'm Puertorican and I don't own a Puertorican pestle or mortal(pilon) and it is my second time making it.  I just got creative and I used a deep round bowl with a small baking rolling pin and used the round edges  of it to mash the plantain.  I creamed the garlic in the food processor.  I also used the food processor to only beak in tiny pieces the pork skin.  I used a combination of green plantain and slightly yellow ones.  It is not that complicated to make it.  It came out great and delicious to be my second time making mofongo! Thanks

The recipe was very easy to follow. It came out very tasty and tasted like home, Puerto Rico.

I made mofongo for the first time using this recipe, and it was delicious. My Puerto Rican husband mentioned that I could boil the plantains instead of frying them so I will try that next time. I will absolutely be making this much more often as it was not nearly as difficult as I thought it would be.

This was my first time making mofongo and it turned out delicious!!  I added a few slices of bacon as I was mashing the plantains but followed everything else exactly. It was pretty easy and a big hit with my boyfriend who loves Puerto Rican food!

It was absolutely delicious! I used a bit more olive oil than what the recipe asked for so that it would be easier to mash the plantains. I also switched to bacon and it turned out great!. It was my first time making mofongo and it really made justice to the ones I've bought at restaurants here in Puerto Rico. We agreed it was even better, a definite keeper!

Been to PR 3 times and have eaten a lot of mofongo there.  I tried to bake the plaintains to make this recipe healthier, although I still used a good bit of oil.  I thought it was a little dry in the end, but this was probably by fault, and the raw garlic was overpowering.  However, the flavor was still good and it went really nicely with the garlic shrimp recipe on this site.  Next time I think I will add a yucca or a potato for a smoother mash, and my cousin who cooks a lot with plaintains suggested boiling, which may accomplish making this dish healthier while avoiding the dryness.  I think I will also cut down on the raw garlic.

I suggest you find the correct type of green plantains. They need to actually be more like green bananas than the sweet plantains you know. When you are done, you can put the mortar upside down in the oven at low heat until the food becomes loose from the mortar. Another thing that can be done if you are not liking the slight spice or sting of garlic, is to put the whole cloves to cook in a small amount of oil for a little bit. After that you can crush it in the mortar and pestle. I will cook it again and continue to modifying it as I go. If I find the perfect mix I will share it here.

If you don't have a mortar and pestle, use a wooden spoon. That is what I used and it did the trick. However, I also used the minced garlic that comes in a jar rather than the cloves. That helps ease the labor process if you don't have a mortar and pestle as well. AWESOME

I love this dish, served with traditional rice and beans.  I add some Adobo for a little kick.

I substituted the oil to an oil of my preference which made no change to the taste of the end product.

Easy and delicious!  Had all the ingredients for the recipe and some left over Puerto Rican red beans I made so decided to combine the two.  Traditional I would serve with stewed shrimp but was also great with the beans. 

Added a pinch of salt to the motar making it easier to crush the garlic,  added a few  plantains  at a time as I mashed with the pork rinds .   The salt from the rinds is more than enough to season the dish.

Will make over and over again!!
