This is the best gooseberry pie I've ever had. The excessive tartness of gooseberries is eliminated with the sour cream and sugar mixture. I've served it numerous times and guests have always asked for more.

YUK this pie is way too sweet and the recipe did not have enough gooseberries. I had to use 3 cups of them. Next time I make this pie I will also halve the amount of sugar.

I received 2 1/2 cups of gooseberries from my CSA and I made this pie for my family reunion. I followed all of the directions except I used 2 1/2 cups of gooseberries in one pie. The pie turned out delicious and I was complimented several times at the reunion.

I'm very proud of my single gooseberry bush which yields enough berries for 1 pie. The pressure is on for a good recipe and this one was great creamy but not too sweet. We'll try it again next year.

I planted a gooseberry bush and had about a cup of gooseberries so I made this pie. I used the smaller size graham cracker crust and also cooked the gooseberries for about 5 minutes and cooled them and mixed everything together. I didn't have a top crust on it so it wasn't all that pretty. This was the first gooseberry pie I've ever tasted in my life but I thought it was the best tasting pie of ANY kind I've ever had. I should have more gooseberries next year and will add maybe 1-1/2 to 2 cups. I can hardly wait!

I tried gooseberries cooked first time with this recipe and loved the results. However I made the sugar half white and half brown added an extra tablespoon of flour and another cup of gooseberries. An unusual yummy flavor!
