Too sweet the condensed milk taste is rather strong and the texture just isn't right. I made this in my counter-top ice cream maker and after the churn cycle it was still rather runny so I put it in the freezer to set. After 7 hours it still did not have a good ice cream consistency. I think we will probably be throwing the rest of this out because it's syrupy tasting and not creamy. I make ice cream quite often but this is one recipe I will not be using again sorry.

I love ice cream and my ice cream maker gets used 2-3 times a week if not more. I made this recipe and it was a huge hit at my house! I have never seen ice cream disappear that fast. What are you waiting for? Try it!

Great...but I found it to be almost too sweet. Next time I'm gonna leave out the sweetened condensed milk...
