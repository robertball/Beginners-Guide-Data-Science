This is fabulous. I added orange marmalade as I had only one orange and added some cinnamon. It has gotten rave reviews

Rather a flat bread.  Was baking powder as an ingredient left out of the recipe?

The flavour was good but it was pretty flat.  I'm thinking the recipe should've included baking powder?
