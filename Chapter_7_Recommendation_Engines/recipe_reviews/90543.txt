Easy and delicious. The whole family enjoyed it. The only change I made was to use low-fat cream cheese instead of heavy cream. Delicious, and great left-overs. Thanks.

Delicious and tender chicken and green beans, but there is very little sauce (this could be my fault because I subbed 3T milk + 1T of cornstarch for the heavy cream, but I doubt it).  Served with bowtie pasta tossed with olive oil and seasonings.

This is a delicious way to use those fresh summer green beans.  I made it twice, the first time as written.  The second time, I added 1/2 cup chicken broth while sauteing the chicken, which made it a lot more moist and flavorful.  It also made the sauce too runny in the end.  Next time, I think I will add just a few tablespoons of broth.

Great basic recipe-open to additions, I added a can of diced tomatoes, a few italian herbs, used fresh green beans, and served it over whole wheat pasta.

This needed a few touches and it was great!  First, it was lacking salt and pepper.  Second, I added a touch of chicken broth along with the green beans.  When the beans were cooked, I removed the cover, allowed the broth to cook off, then added the cream and Parmesan cheese.  I used shredded Parmesan because I think it has better flavor.  I served this as is, but it would be great with doubled sauce over rice.

This is a great meal for those hectic days when you need something quick. I didn't have fresh or frozen green beans so I used canned and it still tasted good. I liked that I had everything on hand. I made it with steamed rice and my family loved it, including my 2 two year olds. I gave it four stars because it seemed like it was missing something. I will make this again but next time will try and add my own touch to it. Thanks for the recipe!

A simple, yet filling meal.  Easy and quick when you don't have a lot of time on your hands.  I thought it needed more garlic, so I added about 1 tsp. garlic powder.  Tossed in some sliced fresh carrots, too.  Served over rice.  Wonderful!

This is so good my husband licks the plate. I've made several times and now I add chicken stock w/the oil to keep the chicken moist. I sometimes add mushrooms, but I definitely double the sauce. It's great!

Pretty good, not amazing, but not bad, a little dry. I added 4 pieces of bacon, a couple teaspoons of sherry and chicken stock, but it was still dry. I also used 1/3 cup of cheese instead of 1/4. I added mushrooms as well. Next time I will add more chicken stock and/or cream, and maybe some pepper.

What I loved was the idea of using the green beans as a "substitute" for pasta-- you can just serve the dish as is. What I didn't love was that there just wasn't enough flavor. I had to adjust quite a bit to get it to taste great. Thanks for the idea, though! :)

This recipe was a hit at my house. I tweaked it a bit based on other reviews. I sauteed some chopped bacon in the oil, then added the onion and garlic, then added the chicken. I also added some cream cheese along with the parmesan cheese and cream. A dash of sherry completed this great dish. The only way I could think to improve this recipe would be to add some pepper. Be careful of adding too much salt if you use bacon like I did. I served this over rice. My husband could not stop raving about this dish. Thanks, WannaBChef!

Very easy, quick and tasty.  I added a handful of shredded cheddar to the parmesan, and only used milk for the sauce instead of cream, and added salt and pepper, of course.  My daughter loved it.

So easy to make and yummy too!  This is the second time we've made it. Lower in carbs and still very filling and a "stick to your ribs" kind of meal. 
I did add bacon last time (yummy!) and this time I substituted some grated cheddar for some of the parmesan cheese and it was delicious too!

This was quite good, although I admit a small modification. I didn't have any heavy cream, so substituted a can of cheddar cheese soup for the cream and cheese.  Served it over potatoes, and it made a good meal.

Delicious!! I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, salt, red pepper and pepper. I also added a few extra garlic cloves, a whole diced onion, and 3 slices of turkey bacon and 1/4 cup of water after the chicken was browned to keep everything moist. Super easy and customizable. Thank you for the recipe!

Great way to use up green beans in a new way!I collaborated all of the reviews and was asked to keep the recipe, i cooked the chicken in chicken broth, in a separate pan i cooked mushrooms, a chopped orange pepper, onion and garlic. At the end i added fresh green beans and about a cup total of lite cream, Parmesan and flour. I stirred that until think and chopped the chicken and put it all together. Served with rice. Next time I will cook the green beans longer for more of a soft pasta texture. My boyfriend kept picking at the leftovers and said he kept thinking they were noodles until he bit into them. Besides the cream and cheese this was a very healthy filling dinner.

Superb. I did  kick up the flavor a few hundred notches by adding fresh rosemary. Seconds always requested and never any leftovers! Paired with sautéed mushrooms, bell pepper, carrots  and broccoli and sour cream mashed potatoes.

Loved this simple and quick dish....I read some reviews before cooking this so I had planned to make extra  sauce as a few reviews said the dish was dry.  I added half a cup of chicken broth and used half a block of cream cheese.  Served it over rice and it was delicious, a huge hit with everyone in my family.  Next time I will serve it over pasta.

Loved this quick and easy. Fried the onions first because we like them very brown, then added the chicken chunks, and minced garlic. Let that cook for a bit, and add in green beans but it seemed dry then and so I needed about 1/2 cup of liquid. I was steaming a separate pot of beans for my husband who is a vegetarian, so used the drained bean water for the liquid to add to the chicken pan. Also added in chopped almonds and a shot of soy sauce. Added 10% cream, grated parmesan cheese, and two large spoonfuls of cream cheese. Continue to cook with a lid for just a bit and stir often. Beans were very firm still, so next time they may need to be steamed ahead of time in the microwave for a bit first. Loved it!

Absolutely easy to make and delicious! I added more cheese and cream because I had a lot of green beans. I paired it with brown rice.

I liked these alot - but they still need a little something else - Made without meat as side dish.  Used myzritha cheese; use parmesan or romano next time and use cream (only had milk).  Also - carmelize onions and possibly something crunchy like pecans at the end

After reading the reviews I went ahead and heavily altered this recipe. But first, as a note to those of you using chicken breast: place the meat in a plastic baggy and pound the meat into a more uniform width.  This will make cooking moist chicken far easier!

I only had chicken tenders on hand. I salted and peppered and marinated them in Dijon mustard for a half hour while I got the onions, garlic, and beans ready.  I cooked according to the recipe, browning the meat on both sides before throwing in the onion, and then roughly 2 minutes later, the garlic.  I also poured in a healthy dollop of white wine (between 1/4 and 1/2 cup) and set it to simmer while I cooked up my noodles.  I added the green beans, added a bit of garlic salt on top of them, and let the entire thing cook down for roughly 20 minutes.  I added 3T of 2% milk at the end, removed everything but the sauce, and let it reduce while I finished the noodles.

Cooked like this, the chicken came out moist, tender, and super flavorful.  In the future, I may cook the green beans only on top of the chicken, as they absorbed the mustard flavor more readily than the meat. Next time I will squeegee more of the mustard off before tossing it into the skillet!  I served it on top of Rotini pasta.  If I do this again, I will serve it on white rice instead.

It was good! My picky kids even ate it. I used fresh green beans and added a cup of fresh mushrooms (they were delicious). I had no cream, so I used 1 Tablesoon milk, and 2 Tablesoons Rondele cheese spread. It worked!

On a hunch, I threw in a handful of herbs de provence and it became a little more divine! Also, a cup of leftover rice since I didn't have any good bread to serve with it... LOL

Made it once and was a little disappointed.  This time I added rosemarry, pepper and shredded carrots and I think that made all the difference.  Everyone loved it!
