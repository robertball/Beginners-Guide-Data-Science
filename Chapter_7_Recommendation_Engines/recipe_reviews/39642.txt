Fantastic! I used a box of fresh sliced mushrooms and added a 15 oz can of beef broth instead of water. Also, I dredged the steaks in flour before browning and baked it about 2 hours. You could cut it with a fork and the gravy was wonderful on mashed potatoes. This is real comfort food!

Steaks were nice and moist - gravy had good flavor.  Only complaint is that there was WAY too much of it!  Consider paring down - I'd probably only use one can of soup and mushrooms next time.

Yummy!  We never eat pork, because it's usually tough and tasteless.  This was our first try with pork steaks.  I'll never buy pork chops again!  We've made this with the suggested cream of mushroom and have tried cream of celery and also with cream of broccoli.  We've liked it all three ways.

I used boneless porkchops instead of pork steaks. First, salt and pepper both sides, then brown in 2 TBS melted butter over medium high heat for 1 minute per side or until golden. Don't peirce porkchop, use tongs to flip. Place chops into crock pot. Add rest of ingredients substituting Condensed Cream of GOLDEN mushroom soup for one of the cans called for. Also, I subbed 1/2 the amount of water called for with a little white wine and chicken broth. Cook on low for 6 hours or until chops are cooked through. 
So good with sauce served over chops and mashed potatoes.

Well...I couldn't find pork steaks...so I used boneless porkchops instead.  I browned them in oil and butter and transfered them to my slow cooker.  I added the rest of the ingredients to the pan (except the water...I used about an 1/8 cup of red wine instead) and scraped up the brown bits.  Poured this over the meat and let it cook on low for several hours. I enjoyed this recipe...thanks Angela.

This was a good recipe, but I couldn't for the life of me find a can of water. I had the poor stock boy at the grocery help me, and bless his heart, he tried. Unfortunately we couldn't find it, so I had to use water from the sink. It still turned out quite lovely, and I will definitely make it again.

This was my very first time eating pork steaks, so I didn't know what to expect as far as the meat goes.  But the end result was good.  The pork was very tender, not quite a chop, not quite a steak.  I cut the soup to 1 can & used the entire packet of onion soup mix, which resulted in an overwhelming onion flavor.  Even with the soup cut in half, this made A LOT of gravy, plenty for the 4 steaks.  I threw in a 1/8 c. of white wine that I had left over.  I would make this again, nice every once in a while meal.  Thanks Angela.

This was yummy & very tender. I will be making it again & again for sure my Husband loved it.He usually doesn't care for Pork because it can be dry. I used fresh mushrooms, added the mushrooms & onions to the pan after browning the pork. to this & added the soup, water, dry soup mix. salt & pepper. Then poured it over the pork. Next time I will use less Salt.Thanks for the Recipe.

This recipe was awesome with garlic mashed potatoes!  My husband ate the gravy on the potatoes until it made him sick!  I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned, and I think it really helped the flavor.

Thanks for a great way to cook pork steaks!! (had always cooked them under the broiler but hated the mess!) followed the recipe except only used 1 can mushrooms and didn't have onion soup mix so subsituted a dry onion gravy mix packet--worked wonderful great way to tenderize this meat and would absolutely make again!! I also read the review who thought it made too much gravy--my suggestion if you love gravy over potatoes/rice/noodles DO NOT decrease the water amount--I did and would have easily utilized the additional gravy.

Excellent gravy-smothered meal! Browned in garlic-infused olive oil (big fan), set meat aside and cooked fresh sliced mushrooms and chopped onion in the pan for 5-6 minutes, added a glug of brandy (2 to 3 TBS) and set on fire.  Stirred in chicken broth in place of water, soup, dry onion soup mix and Worchestershire. Added meat and covered pan with alum foil, stuck in oven for an hour and a half. Simple, tasty, comforting - and flambe!

Wow! I made this in my crockpot, and admittedly, I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I never do. But I used the basic stuff - the two cans of soup, no water, two packages of fresh mushrooms instead of canned, lots of garlic, the onion, the soup mix, and LOTS of worcestershire. I cooked it about 6 hours in the crockpot, and it was WONDERFUL! My fiancée keeps calling it stew instead of just steaks, which makes me think I could have probably added additional vegetables, but this was really, really good and we will definitely make it again.

I had two small pork roasts I tried to cut them uniformly.  I then followed the recipe exactly but made two pans and added sour cream in the second dish. and topped both with browned slivered almonds.  FANTASTIC!  While baking I added some potatoes for fast mash potatoes.

I used thick boneless center cut pork chops.I added the onion to the pork chops as they were almost done browning, for flavor and to carmelize the onions. The pork turned out very tender but I did not like the gravy it made. It was Way to salty.I will Not make this again. I suggest not adding the last 3 ingredients (water-soup mix and worcestershire). The soup itself has enough salt.

Wonderful.  It made my house smell so good.  I sauteed sliced onions and fresh mushrooms in olive oil before adding to the crock pot with the meat.  I used a 15 oz can of beef broth instead of the water.  The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender and very tasty.  Served with butter and parsley egg noodles and green beans.  I can't wait to have leftovers tonight!

I washed & halved new potatoes & put them in with the pork steak & did everything exactly like recipe.. Try it with the potatoes, it made the potatoes taste so great also.. My husband loves this more than any others I have made... 5 stars definitely

Made this last night for supper. I did not add the dry onion soup and instead used a teaspoon on Kitchen Bouquet for color just to cut out some sodium. Everything else stayed the same. The meat and gravy were awesome. Fall of the bone tender with good flavor. A new way to cook pork steaks.

Wow!!!!  I substituted the meat with filet mignon and used golden cream of mushroom which makes the world of difference!  The meat just melted in our mouths!  Served with green beans and mashed potatos.  The cream of mushroom sauce made the perfect gravy!

Great flavor, tender meat but was a bit too greasy for our tastes. Next time I will use boneless pork chops. Less fat maybe?

I actually prepared this recipe in the crock pot, and considered the outcome to be "comfort food".  I would suggest that you purchase low sodium soup, and add salt at the table.  It was a bit salty, but pretty good overall.  I served it with smashed potatos, and even my two year old cleaned his plate!

This was delicious.  I used my crock pot and cooked it as recipe states except cooked in crock pot for 8 hrs. on low. The flavor is excellent and the best aroma fills you home.

I cooked this recipe exactly as written, and served it with rice and green beans, and my family loved it. Even my picky daughter asked for seconds of the meat.The steaks were fork tender and very flavorful. A definite keeper.

This is a wonderful and easy recipe.  The only changes I made were:  used 8 oz. fresh mushrooms and did not add Worcestershire sauce.  I also added a splash of skim milk to the soup/water mixture.  Delicious comfort food to warm up the house on a cold winter day!

Very easy meal, super delicious.  I skipped the browning stage and they still came out wonderful.  Used fresh mushrooms (8 oz) since I needed to use them up.  This was the first time that I have used pork "steaks" and believe it or not I have several packages of them in the freezer from when we got our whole pig last year.  Didn't know what they were or what to do with them.  Thanks for helping me out with this piece of meat.  I did add some fingerling potatoes while the steaks cooked too.  Very satisfying meal.

This was O.K. Nothing horrible but nothing great. It just didn't have that special something. Way too much gravy; so much I didn't know what to do with. It served its purpose of filling our bellies tonight for dinner but I won't be making again.

DELICIOUS! The onion flavor is quite strong, but personally, I don't think this is a bad thing. The pork steaks were moist and flavorfull. A great recipe for when you're in a hurry.

It was a very good recipe!  I found it almost a little salty, but I loved it nonetheless.  I'll try it with fresh mushrooms and less onion powder next time, but this made a great meal with real mashed potatoes!

This is a great way to cook pork steak.  Our steaks were the shoulder pork steak, a little fatty but plenty of meat.  I thought 90 minutes to cook was way to long, but it made the pork really tender and yummy - Thanks

Too much pepper, but that could be my fault---too much "gravy" or "sauce" with two cans. Didn't care for the canned mushrooms as they had a rubbery texture. Will make again, but will use less spices and 1/2 the amount of cream soup. Served it with a side of corn and some rice; as I was only serving 2, I had leftovers for 3 additional meals (froze for work dinners).

Should be able to give more stars because this deserves them!  So yummy!  DH absolutely LOVES this.  I usually cut the recipe in half for the 2 of us, with a bit for leftovers.  Follow the recipe otherwise, so very worth it!

First try on this recipe came out very good.  Can't wait to try it again.  I made some slight modifications just because of availability of ingredients:  didn't have onion powder so used paprika instead, used chives instead of onions, used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom, and skipped the mushrooms over the top.  Next time I want to add the mushrooms, fresh ones.  I also think any reasonable 'cream of' soup would work well (mushroom, chicken, celery, etc).  I put rice on the side this time, which was good, but I think next time I'll do mashed potatoes because the sauce that it ends up making sounds perfect for mashed potatoes.  Despite my slight adjustments for what was in my cupboard, I think this recipe would be great as is, or with your own personal adjustments.

One of my husbands favorites! I used one can of cream of mushroom instead of two and only half of a package of onion soup. Also be sure not to cook too long, if they are thin sliced, they dont need to bake that long or they will dry out.

My family absolutely loved this! I used bone in pork chops because it's what I had on hand and they came out so incredibly tender and juicy...I have NEVER had pork chops this good! Even my mother-in-law (who is a lap band patient and has trouble eating most meats because they are usually too dry and get stuck) could eat this with no problems and has requested that I add it to the weekly rotation. I did change a few things after reading the reviews but it's a great base recipe for just about any type of pork. Here is what I did differently: cut the mushrooms, soup, onion soup mix, and onion in half; substituted half a can of beef broth for the water; cut out the onion powder all together; after browning the steaks and removing them from the pan, I added the chopped onion and mushrooms to the pan and sauteed a few minutes in the drippings, then added the rest of the ingredients to the pan for a few more minutes, then poured it all over the pork chops and cooked the full hour and a half. They really are fork tender and super juicy! And great flavor! I will be making these again and again...in fact I'm making them tonight with mashed potatoes and the Baked Asparagus recipe from this site..yum!!! thanks so much for this awesome recipe!

This is one of my family's favorite ways to eat pork steak/pork chops. If I am using pork chops, I will bump up the amount to 6 or 8 pork chops. I also use lemon lime soda instead of water. The pork chops fall apart and the mushroom soup/onion soup mix/lemon lime soda make an excellent gravy over mashed potatoes.  There's never any leftovers.

This recipe is awesome!!!!!!!!! I used 8 pork chops, bone in, because that is what I had in the freezer. I followed the recipe exactly except because I had 8 pork chops I was concerned that I might not have enough gravy, so after I covered the chops with the mushroom soup mixture I poured a jar of pork gravy on top last. I baked it at 250 for 3 1/2 hours. Boy was it tender and tasty! Not runny at all, not too much gravy either, I had just enough gravy to go around and enough for leftovers tomorrow. Next time I will try the pork steak, because I prefer the dark meat it is much juicier than the white meat.

This is a really good recipe, but I have to give it 4 stars because there is WAY too much sauce. I say this even though I halved the sauce ingredients, and there was still SO much of it. I did use golden mushroom soup instead, which was very tasty. Halved the onion soup mix, water, and just used that one can of soup. I thought the package I had taken out of the freezer was pork steak, turns out it was boneless pork chops. I baked them at 400 for 35 minutes and that was just perfect. Very, very tasty... great served with mashed potatoes and green beans. Thanks, I'll make this again but drastically cut the sauce down. :)

It was good.  Didn't really taste the seasonings, maybe I should have added more, but didn't want to overwhelm it.  It was nice and tender with a lot of juice to it.  I'd make it again.

We tried this recipe tonight.  I followed the ingredients, but put it in the slow cooker on low all day.  It was very tender.  My husband loved it, I thought it was a little too mushroomy.  The gravy was really good over our homemade mashed potatos.  Will try again maybe next time not using as many mushrooms.

Excellent. made some minor changes. The markets steaks were too thin, so we subbed with nice inch and a quarter thick boneless pork chops. Used a mixture of Olive oil and Sesame oil rather than vegetable oil. Julianed a medium red onion rather than chopping. Used a mixture of Balsamic vinegar and Sherry in place of the water. Used button mushrooms rather than sliced (So the wife could pick them out as she can't eat them but likes the flavor of them), didn't have any onion soup mix so used a packet of pork flavored Ramen powder mix. Also after browning the chops, Moved them into a crockpot. Sauted the onion in the same oil mixture, then transferred them to thetop of the chops, added the shrooms and the sauce mixture and cooked on high for six and a half hours. Came out extremely moist and fork tender. And the gravy was absolutely perfect. Paired with the Lemon-Butter Red Potatoes from this site.
If there was ever a 10 star rateing, this would get it.

This was great!  I cooked in the crock pot and used white wine/chicken broth instead of water.  Also subbed golden mushroom for one of the cans of mushroom soup as others recommended.  Very good.  Served gravy over mashed potatoes.

Family loved it.  My 3 teenage boys devoured it.  A little salty for me.  I will just reduce the onion soup mix next time.  Still a great recipe!

I served this on top of brown rice, and the family loved it!  We always BBQ pork steaks, so was glad to find a new way of cooking them inside, since the grill and deck are covered with snow.  Thanks for sharing :)

Outstanding!  You would think the steaks would dry out.  I modified the recipe by omiting added salt, slicing the onions (makes a better presentation), and cooking in a large electric skillet.

We thought this was pretty good.  I had never had pork steaks before and it was quite tender.  The only thing I changed was instead of chopping the onion, I sliced it so my picky children could take them out.  I left the amount of ingredients as is because I made mashed potatoes with this recipe and it made a nice gravy for the potatoes.

I used red wine instead of a can of water, and only one can of cream of mushroom soup, based on other reviews that said it made way too much sauce.  This sauce was perfect for 3-4 chops.  I only baked it for one hour, and the boneless pork chops were tender and moist.   This meal was tasty; however, we prefer the Mushroom Pork Chop recipe on this site.  The is a huge difference between fresh mushrooms and canned.

Thanks Angela! I needed a recipe I could leave in the oven for a couple hours. Cut the recipe in half, turned the temp down a bit and they came out just fine. Only used 1/2 can mshrm soup and thinned with milk... 1 tsp. onion soup mix, and sauted the onions in with the browning steaks (used thick center cut pork chops), tossed a spring of fresh rosemary under the foil. Served with twice baked potatoes. Yummy dinner!

The pork turned out very tender.  The flavor wasn't bad but it was just way too overwhelming.  The onion soup mix is very potent.  My house smelled like this recipe for 24 hours (at least) and it left a strong aftertaste that lingered for hours.  I would only make this recipe again if it met 2 requirements:  make it on a day that you can have your windows open to air out the house and serve it with a minty dessert to cover that aftertaste.

I made this recipe but halved it for two. I used boneless pork steak. I forgot to halve the Worcestershire sauce however. Instead of water I used white wine and used fresh mushrooms. I would make it again however would eliminate adding any salt as the mushroom soup and onion soup mix has enough. Overall we enjoyed the recipe and I wouldn't hesitate to make it again.

This was a pretty decent meal, but I think it would work better with a drier meat such as pork chops or chicken breast. All in all, very good.

Excellent recipe.  I used boneless pork loin chops, dredged and lightly browned, then baked.  The only change I made was reducing the cream of mushroom to one can - it's all I had on hand, but it worked out fine.  You could cut them with a fork when done.  Thanks for sharing!

Oh my ! ~ This was Wonderful. My husband kept saying how good it was. And almost with each bite he would look at me and give me a thumbs up =) I TWISTED it UP though ~I used what I had on hand. 4 medium to large Pork Steaks,1 inch thick. Subbed mushroom soup with 2(10.75 ounce) cans cream chicken soup. 1 carton fresh mushrooms chopped. 2 med onions chopped. 4 cloves garlic minced. 4 tbsp Worcestershire sauce. 2 (10.75 ounce)cans water. 8 bay leaves. Combined canned and dry soup, water, Worcestershire sauce, and 1 generous tbsp flour. Mix well. Put aside. Chopped all veggies and put aside to rest.Sprinkled salt and pepper, garlic powder on one side only of Pork Steaks. Fried in heavy pot approx 3 to 5 min. each side. *** Stacked in CROCKPOT with Bay Leaves layered between each steak. Put CROCK on warm and covered with lid. Placed onions, garlic in drippings and cooked for 5 min. Added mushrooms, cooked 3 more min. Add soup mixture heat to boiling and cook 4 to 5 min, stirring often. Pour gravy mixture over Pork Steaks in crockpot and cook on high for 2 to 3 hours.  Note: I cooked mine for two hrs. We ate them with rice. Steaks were tender, we didn't need a knife. Would have been even more tender, had it cooked for 3 hours. Gravy had a super flavor. Every flavor seemed to burst. Nothing was over powering. If you try this TWIST UP ~ I sure hope you enjoy it =) oh... and don't eat the Bay Leaves LOL

I made this for dinner tonight, and it was a total hit! Kids loved it, so that makes it a winner in my house. Will be making this again! I did make a slight change though...We don't like mushrooms, so I omitted them and I used cream of celery rather than the cream of mushroom soup. It was really awesome!

Followed the recipe exactly, except omitted the mushrooms as we didn't have any and added diced garlic and parsley... and this was awesome.  Being from the south we grew up on this and we called it 'Smothered Porkchops'.  This is always good and filling. Makes a great Sunday dinner. Served with mashed potatoes and green beans. I also used this same recipe for cut up chicken pieces and it  was just as good. Be sure to brown the seasoned chicken pieces in a non-stick pan before putting it all in the oven.

Wow what an easy and awesome meal. Local grocery store didn't have any pork steak so I substituted Iowa chops and baked for an extra 15 minutes in same pan I browned in removing extra veggie oil before baking. Also left out the mushrooms and onions as my kids aren't big veggie eaters, but still super awesome and fork tender. Thanks for sharing!!!!!

Easy to make, and very delicious. I tend to dread the pork steaks in my meat pack, but this has changed that. It also makes the steaks tender enough that my 17 month old son can enjoy it as well.

This dish was absolutely amazing. My husband loved it! I did however make a couple changes. I used boneless pork chops and I lined the pan with sliced potatoes. The soup mix made a wonderful gravy. I will definitely make this again.

Loved this!  I have never cooked with pork steaks before and this really made them great.  Next time I think I will use boneless porkchops though. They seem less fatty than the pork steaks. 
Over all, this will become a regular at our home.

Excellent recipe! I dredged the steaks in a seasoned flour, then browned. I also used baby portabellas and thick cut onion, dredged them in the same seasoned flour and browned them up in the same pan as the pork with a little oil. With the 'shrooms, onions and yummy bits and pieces in the pan, I made a gravy with the cream of mushroom, a little milk and water. Then poured it over the steaks in the crockpot. Cooked for 6 hrs and it melted in your mouth. The gravy was wonderful with mashed potatoes!

Great recipe base.  I altered it by not using canned soup.  I used leftover gravy about 2 cups.and added a cup of water. They came out so tender and juicy my husband loved them.   I will do this one again.

Good recipe! Changes I made were used fresh mushrooms, lightly sauteed mushrooms & onions after browning pork, and used beef broth instead of water.  Served over broad noodles and completed meal with steamed mixed vegtables. Anticipation grew from the aroma while it was in the oven. Whole family really enjoyed the meal.

I don't give a lot of 5 star ratings, but this one certainly earns it. I followed the recipe for the most part. AFter reading the reviews, I eliminated water, used a little cola (less than 1/2 a can) and used golden mushoroom soup, just for our preferences. Took some time to brown them, but other then that, recipe is a cinch. Cooked for 2 hours on 325 and it was fork tender like it had been in a slow cooker. I'm using the base of this recipes to try a new stroganoff recipe tonight, so thanks for posting this one! PS. it was the first time I had used pork steaks as opposed to chops, which I'll use this recipe for as well.

It was very tender and delicious.  subed the water for beef broth and left out onion powder since it already had onions and the onion soup.  I used a little less than the full package of the onion soup too.  It did not turn out salty like some of the others had mentioned.  We love extra sauce to go with the mashed potatoes we were having with it so I kept the amount as written.  I would recommend reducing the sauce.  Since I was  doubling the recipe, including the amount of steaks and not sure if my dish was not big enough... it should have been fine but it made a mess in my oven and my 2nd mistake was to put my oven in self clean mode later on ... LOL!  All the alarms were blasting around 10:15 pm and the smoke was horrible and so was the smell but I would make it again now that I know better. :)

This is a great go-to recipe for a busy night. Following the suggestion of another user, I made it in my crockpot - so good! The whole family loved it.  Toss it all in the crockpot on high around noon and you'll have a perfect dinner ready by 5.  I quartered 5 potatoes and put them on top so when the meat was ready I could pull them out and mash them. Delish!!

This is a great recipe.  I was trying to figure out a way to make porksteak indoors since it was too cold to grill and these were wonderful.  I had 5 large porksteaks so I added an extra can of cream of mushroom soup and I used cream instead of milk.  The gravy went great with garlic mashed potatoes.

I just made this recipe the other night, Since I got a pack of pork chops and some mushroom still sitting in my fridge and other ingredients was able to be found in my pantry. I was so tired from work already and want something fast and tasty so I can just eat and rest up and watch some tv. This recipe was quick and tasty , I am definitely gonna make this recipe again and again and many more.

OH MY!! Was this ever a hit at my house!  Husband wanted to drink the gravy with a straw.  Mushrooms, onions, and gravy made him a very happy hubby!! I only had one can of mushrooms, but I was still so happy that I had everything on hand to make this!  It's a great meat recipe!

This was fantastic!  The meat was so tender and the flavor was awesome.  I took one of the other suggestions and tossed some quartered potatoes in with it. They went very well with the gravy.  This will become a regular in our house!

Until tonight, I've only had pork steaks (pork butt steaks) on the grill w/ bbq sauce. This was a nice variation. Very good flavor! Was concerned about the dish being too oniony and salty, but it turned out great. Subbed fresh shrooms for canned. There was ALOT of sauce. I served over egg noodles but it was a tad too runny (possibly due to the fresh mushrooms). Next time I plan to add a couple of potatoes (wedged) to the casserole dish to absorb some of the liquidy goodness. Thanks for the recipe!

I just thought this recipe was just OK.  I am not a huge fan of pork steaks due to the fat content but thought I would try this as an alternative to BBQing.  The flavor was there but I just couldn't get over the fat on the meat (which , of course, I knew might be an issue).  If I made this again I think I would use boneless pork chops as a leaner alternative.  The meat was flavorful and fork tender, though, which is a huge plus in my book.  Worth trying again with a few changes.

Delicious! I used cream of chicken soup instead of cream of mushroom. I also cooked pork chops instead of the steaks at 375 and served the gravy over white rice. 
Will make it again.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I did use thin boneless pork chops (since they are less fatty), cooked everything in the crock pot for about 3 hours on high, and didn't add the additional water. The chops were very tender.

My whole family loves this recipe, which is a rare experience.  The only thing I change is I leave out the onion soup, just because I never have any on hand.

I used boneless pork shoulder steaks in this recipe.  I also only had one can of cream of mushroom soup so I used a can of cream of celery soup as well.  I baked these as directed in the recipe and they were so tender.  The gravy was awesome over red skinned smashed potatoes.  Very simple, yet super delicious!

I had never bought pork steaks before and did so just to try this recipe.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, and it was FABULOUS!  My family is still talking about how much they loved it.  I will never buy pork chops again! Adding to the "family favorites" archives!

I loved this..I made it exactly as written and it was easy. A very nice change from frying them. I will use this over and over again. My steaks were thinner than what I should have used so I should have reduced the cook time but that was completly my fault. For thinner I would bake for about 30-40 minutes. This was great thanks for sharing!

I thought this was pretty good, however I think next time instead of the onion soup mix I will put in two or three teaspoons of minced garlic as the onion was very over powering. My grandchildren thought so also.

I threw this in the crock pot before leaving for church.  The steak was very tender and tasty.  I might add a little more spice next time.  Easy to get together though.

Excellent.  I look for new ways to cook pork steak since it is usually on special at my grocery store and makes a cheap meal.  I cooked this in the crock pot and halved the recipe-cooking only 2 steaks.  I rubbed the partially frozen steaks with the salt and pepper then added the onions and used fresh garlic instead of powedered.  They fell apart and were so flavorful, not always true of pork steak.  We ate this over biscuits and mashed potatoes.  I will definately make again.

This was soooo yummy!!  My husband and kids don't like mushrooms, so I used a cream of potato soup I had on hand, and didn't add the 'shrooms.  I also baked it longer until it was very tender, as 90 minutes wasn't tender enough for us....I can't wait to cook this for my parents who love mushrooms as much as I do.  It was a 5 star recipe without the mushrooms...I'm sure it will be even better with them!!

I am glad to find another way to cook Pork Steak. Pork Steak is $1.50/lb and much more tender than beef. The sauce gives a savory taste to the pork. We enjoyed it with Rice-a-Roni. Thanks

This recipe is the first one I make as soon as it starts to cool out, and I stock up on soup and soup mix just for this! I only used one can of soup. The only other thing I did differently was to mix the last 4 ingredients (along with the liquid I drained from the mushrooms) into the pan after I'd removed the steaks... this picked up any flavor left in the pan, and saved me a bowl to clean! Thank you for such a good recipe!

I usually hate pork steak becouse its tough, but buy it becouse its cheap. This recipe made it soooo tender and flavorfull, it just fell apart like a slow cooked roast. And it was so easy. I used an uncondenced soup one time and made it with condenced the next, but only one can and half the water. Wonderfull!!!

YUMMY! I totally cut corners on this one and it still turned out amazing. so tender and the gravy, mmmmmm, so good. I thought it would just be another average mushroom pork dish but it really surprised me. It's definately going to the top of my favorites list. You owe it to yourself to try this one!

This was good.  My family liked this.  We have a difficult time finding good recipes for pork steaks.  Since we buy our pork as a pig and have it butchered we do end up with a lot of pork steaks which I find difficult to serve with variety.  This was a good change.   Thanks for the recipe  I made a few changes however.  I didn't salt and pepper the steaks (which draws the juices out and will dry them out considerably).  I also didn't sear them.  I normally would because that also will help them retain their juices, but my steaks were fairly thin and I worried that searing them would have cooked them to much for 90 minutes in the oven.  I didn't have dry onion soup mix so I used dry vegetable soup mix which was very good!  I also used dry white wine in place of the water and fresh mushrooms in place of the canned.

I modified this after a first try making it according to directions. While both turned out pretty good, my modification included sauteeing the onion first then doing the whole thing on the stove top. I think that worked better.

This recipe tasted delicious and was very easy too.  I was very impressed with the tenderness of the pork.  I used the left over gravy over rice.  It could also be used to make sandies with the left over meat for a quick lunch.

My husband and I absolutely loved this recipe.  I've always had trouble with pork being too dry, but this was fantastic.  It came right off the bone.  I used 1 can of condensed cream of mushroom soup and 1 can of the golden cream of mushroom soup.  I made mashed potatoes and used it as a gravy like one of the other reviewers suggested.  We loved it.  I definitely will make this over and over again.  Thanks!

Really great easy way to jazz up pork chops!  I only used 1/2 pk onion soup mix though because sometimes it makes things too salty for us, and I only had cream of chicken soup and it still turned out great.   My daughter who isn't a big pork chop lover, came back for seconds, thanks!

The gravy was excellent.  But it would have gone with beef better than with pork, I think.

This was GREAT! I used Pork Chops instead of pork steaks, and doubled the recipe. I only used about 3/4 can of water because we wanted a thicker gravy. And it turned out so delicious...The down side: NO LEFTOVERS!! This recipe is a keeper.

Delicious!  A change from pan-fried pork steak and easy to prepare.  I would recommend boneless steaks or deboning blade steaks proir to cooking.

Very GOOD!  It makes a very tender pork steak...just crumbles off the fork while eating.  The gravy is perfect to put on mashed potatoes or a good noodles sauce.  This recipe is a KEEPER!  TERRIFIC!  Thanks so much for sharing it!

This recipe is GREAT!!!  I've made it three times already.  You will enjoy it.  It's also good with fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  Pork comes out very tender.

Don't add the salt--there's plenty in the soups. I cooked it in a convection oven for about 65 minutes and it turned out beautifully. Family loved it!

This was really good.  I didn't have any onion soup mix so I used a packet of au jus that I had in the cupboard.  Everything else was left the same.  The family loved it.

Changes I made were, after frying meat, put in crock pot, topped with sauce and onions and a hand full of baby carrots, cooked for 3 to 4 hours on high.  It was tender and delicious. served with rice.  Its a keeper!  On the future menu, for sure.

I was looking for a recipe for POrk steaks since they are inexpensive and my husband loves that they’re meaty. I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try since I had everything I needed to make it on hand.
I followed the directions with the exception  of using 2 big Pork Steaks instead of 4 and they turned out fall offthe  bone phenomenal!
 MY husband loved it!!!

My husband adores this recipe!  It's a very classic meat and potatoes kind of dish.  If you like mushrooms then this one is for you.  I didn't make any changes, I followed the recipe and it was a complete success.  I would suggest making potatoes to go with it.

It's a house favorite over egg noodles. I tend to cut the steaks into smaller pieces for easier serving. This Iowa household loves it!

This was so tender and delicious! I also loved the flavor of the gravy and that I didn't have to add anything to it, it was perfect consistency right out of the oven. I did fry the steaks in flour too and only added 1/2 cup of water which probably helped the gravy get thick. I also recommend using fresh mushrooms.

This was delicious and tender. For speed, I broiled the seasoned pork steaks while I sautéed onions and mushrooms, then added the steaks and topped with the mushroom soup and water. It simmered 15 minutes and was so flavorful with a rich gravy. My husband loved it and we'll definitely make this again

It was very easy to make; however, for the initial meal it didn’t seem to have that much flavor.  I was tremendously surprised when we had it as a leftover there was much more flavor in the dish.  That being said, I decided to keep the recipe and try it again at a later date!

one of my husband's favorites. I skip canned mushrooms and buy chopped fresh. they cook down just fine in the crock pot for 8 hours on low. Maybe less time, but I throw it in before I leave for work in the morning

I was able to make this as a gluten free meal just by using GF cream of mushroom soup and instead using a onion soup mix, used regular dried onions and of course one whole onion chopped in pieces. Also shortened the cooking time to about 60 minutes.

Delicious!!! I kept it as close to recipe as I could with what I had on hand. Only changes were a can of french onion soup instead of soup mix and water. I also didn't brown the meat first - made no difference in final product. Absolutely a crowd pleaser, easy and a keeper for us!

I solved the  "too much gravy " problem by peeling and slicing 6 medium russet potatoes and placing on bottom of greased casserole dish. This was delicious! Also poured a small amount of gravy on bottom of dish before laying potatoes in dish.

I received some pork steaks in a freezer pack we got and had no clue how to make them.  I found this recipe and these were the best!  They were so tender and melted in your mouth.  I normally don't care for pork, but these were amazing!

This dish was really good, my entire family liked it. Even the picky eaters. In the recipe it says that salt and pepper are optional, however I wouldn't add any more salt seeing as it is plenty salty without it. Also I omitted the onion soup mix cause that would just be over kill in the salt department. Overall this is a great main dish.

Absolutely delicious. Only thing I changed was the mushrooms. I used fresh because my hubby hates canned. Will be making this again very soon.

Very much comfort food served on rice.  I made my own onion soup mix from this site using salt free beef bouillion.  I also used fresh mushrooms.  I will make again.

The gravy is rich, and if you follow the recipe, you'll have more than enough. I froze mine. Someday, I'll serve it over a batch of No Yolks noodles.

Wow! This recipe was awesome!  Everyone loved it!  There were a couple things I did differently though.  I ended up using 8 steaks.  I didn't feel like taking the time to brown each of them in the pan so I put them on the grill instead for 10 minutes or so before placing them in the oven.  Also as they grilled I didn't add any salt due to the other reviews.  I know a lot of the other reviewers said that the recipe made to much gravy, but how can you make this with no mashed potatoes?  Next time I will most likely double the soup portion.  This had a great flavor, and very tender without being mushy.

This was an amazing recipe.  Made the pork steaks so tender we didn't need knives. Also, I cut the recipe in half and it worked perfectly.  My husband was so surprised that the meat was pork steak! Will definitely do this again!

I made this exactly as written and it turned out fantastic! I agree with others that there is moooore than enough gravy. We didn't mind but next time will probably cut it down. This was my first time trying pork steaks and both my hubby and I loved it. Great, simple recipe!

I'm from the Midwest, so we eat a lot of pork steaks...and I gotta say, my husband gave this rave reviews!  He told me it was by far the best pork steak recipe I've ever made!  You could probably do this with one can of cream of mushroom and a little less water, but I followed it to a tee and we all loved it!  Keeper!

The was delicious! I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand (Worcestershire, onion soup mix) and I only had one can of soup and one can of mushrooms, however, this made plenty of sauce and I used 5 steaks. I took another reviewer's suggestion and added beef broth instead of water. I also added about 1Tbps of ranch dressing. Not sure if that made any difference since I didn't taste it but everything came out wonderful! I will make sure I have all of the correct ingredients the next time I make this :)

Awesome! I used fresh mushrooms. The only thing, I would probably use less water in it. I wanted more a smothered pork chop. But still, it was delicious! But I must say, the meat was so tender that I didn't even need a knife to cut it. It was falling apart as I tried to put it on the plates! Delicious!

This was very good however I sauted the mushrooms and onion with a little red wine before adding to the meat. I also used a slow Cooker. Turned out great. We had it with mashed potatoes. Yummy.

I didn't have onion soup mix so I added a splash of soy sauce instead. I browned the meat removed it from the pan and cooked onions and fresh mushrooms until they released their liquid to de-glaze the pan. Then added the soup and poured the sauce mixture over the browned meat. Cooked covered at 250 for 5 hours while I was at work. Came home to heaven!

Warning: Making this recipe will cause hubby to act like an ape, tell you this is caveman food, gunt, smile, and fill his plate a couple times LOL! The recipe is rather easy and flavorful. The one thing I want others to note is: do not double the gravy makings when doubling the meat. I had already doubled the gravy amount not thinking it would be a huge deal, until after the entire dish was completed and uncovered from the baking process. I had well enough gravy for several batches of mashed taters and biscuits. However, it's not a bad thing, but really if you double the meat, it's not neccessary to double the gravy. Will make again. It was really really delish.

This was very tender.  However, I wish that the amount of salt and pepper the author used would have been included rather than saying "to taste."  Instead of using onion powder, garlic power, salt and pepper, I used Seasoning Salt.  I used the same amount I would normally put on hamburger patties but this came out way too salty.  I guess with the sodium content of the dry onion soup mix and the Worcestershire sauce it may have made it too salty.  Lesson learned.

I made this tonight and it was "fire", as quoted by my husband.  He loved it and so did I.  I accidently picked up cream of chicken/mushroom soup, but it turned out great.  
I also don't understand how people can give less stars because THEY CHANGE the recipe and then rate THIS recipe.  If you change the recipe, then don't rate the original.  Really.  lol
Thanks for this recipe and I'm looking for more ideas now.  :)

Very good! I made with 2 large bone-in pork steaks. Used one can of soup, no mushrooms, one packet of soup mix, and instead of water, I used half a can of dry sherry. Baked at 325 for 90 minutes. A fatty cut of meat but oh so tender and a very comforting meal with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli!

My husband, who is from Iowa, was very impressed and I was too.  Easy, fast and delicious.  I used Campbell's Cream of Mushroom Soup with Roasted Garlic.  The pork steaks are sooo much cheaper if you can find them.

I used thick, 1 1/2 inch, boneless pork chops instead. Usually this kind of thing turns out dry chops for me, BUT this was nice and moist!  HOWEVER, I did cut the cooking time to ONLY ONE HOUR.  I fried quickly on nearly high till browned on each side to seal the juices in before baking.

I followed the advice of some of the other members and cooked this in the slowcooker for 6 hours. The pork was so tender, it fell apart. Even my 2 year-old ate it.

Until I saw this recipe, I had no idea what Pork Steaks were. I tried it, and instead of using water, I too substituted it with Beef Broth. Made GREAT gravy for the mashed potatoes and vegies, and this meal overall is an A+!

WOW!!! I would rarely give any recipe 5stars, but this was fantastic!  We ususally do pork steaks on the grill with BBQ sauce, and were pleasantly surprised with this alternative. I had to make it without mushrooms, as my mushrooms weren't as fresh as I thought and it was still great.  I also added half wine (a claret) and half beef stock instead of the water, and think it tasted great and gave it a slightly darker sauce which we like.

This dish turned out great! I left out the mushrooms, because I didn't have any. I also used regular boneless pork loin chops instead of pork steaks. And I used chicken stock instead of the water for the dish. I served it over egg noodles and thought it was a great quick meal. I also decreased the cooking time to about a hour, I thought 90 minutes would be too long.

This was really good.  My husband and 3 kids all enjoyed it.  I did change up the soups and used 1 cream of mushroom and 1 golden mushroom.  It gave the sauce more richness.  I also adjusted bake time to 2 hours at 325 degrees.  Slower cooking = More tender meat.

The pork steaks were very tender and the gravy had a nice flavor.  I did saute the onions and mushrooms in the pan after frying the steaks and used fresh mushrooms.  Also used low fat soup.  This makes a ton of sauce so unless you are making a ton of something to put it over I would cut it in half.  Good but we didn't go gaga over it.

I used bone-in pork chops and one can each of golden mushroom and cream of mushroom soups.  After an hour in the oven I checked on it and was very nervous, the onion soup smell was overpowering.  I was also leery of the long cooking time, but it didn't seem very tender yet so I added a healthy amount of white wine to the sauce stirred it up and hoped for the best. It came out FANTASTIC, very tender and flavorful... I would definately make again!  There is a TON of gravy so serve it with some mashed potatoes and enjoy.

This was good but I just realized I can't eat pork steak cause it's way to greasy for my stomach.  I gave the rest away.

I had a pork roast on hand and skipped the skillet part and threw it into the crockpot as is and tweaked the recipe a bit.

I could have chopped up the pork roast but it would have cooked too fast so I chopped it up at the end. 
I used 1/2 can of beef broth for the water.  Was a bit soupy so I added some cornstarch to it to thicken it up a bit for a stew like taste at the end. I added carrots, onions and potatoes in the last hour of cooking and threw in some rubbed sage too.  My mouth was watering as this was cooking.  Tasted so good!  A very unique flavor.  My hubby  couldn't get enough of it. Definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

sorry, but not too impressive. about the only way to salvage it would be to toss it out and order a pizza.

Fantastic!  I've always loved pork steaks - my grandma used to bread and fry them, and as I grown-up I've always done the same.  Tried this last night when I was out of bread crumbs and the pork was already thawed.  The only thing I did differently was used dried onion because I didn't have a fresh one, used white wine instead of water, and added a few shakes of herbes de Provence after browning.  The steaks were tender, juicy and all around succulent, and the sauce was amazing.  My hubby usually suffers through pork meals because I love it, but he went crazy over this one.  I served them on a bed of very lightly buttered egg noodles tossed with fresh parsley.  We will definitely make this again and again!

Wonderful!!  Whole family loved it.  The lil kids, even 16 mo old, requested 2nds and 3rds.  Very tender, moist, seasoned just right.  And, the gravy is delicious on mashed potatoes.

This was wonderful and so easy. Next time I will not add as much water because I would prefer a thicker gravy. The pork steaks I used seemed rather large, so I only used 3. I will make this again! Thanks!

This was so good! We didn't have any leftovers. We used fresh mushrooms and cooked it all in a crockpot for 7 hours on low. The meat just fell apart. Yum

This was edible by all but loved by none.  The sauce was not good...IF I make again I will cut down the onion soup mix by half or eliminate altogether.  The meat was nice and tender though.

This was terrific!  Next time, I will add less salt, and Will probably cook about 15 mins. less.  Pork steaks were tender and delicious!  Hubby says it's a keeper!

My whole family loved this dish! I followed the recipe except I used fresh mushrooms and added them along with the onion to the pork steaks while browning.  I will definitely be making this one again and again.

Very good.   I didn't like the looks of the pork steaks at the market so I used boneless pork chops.   I also browned the pork on a gas grill instead of in a skillet with oil.   The meat was just a tinge dryer than I expected, but it was still very good.

This recipe makes the best pork steaks I've had.  I cooked them all day on low in the crock pot after browning them.  I used cream of celery soup, and instead of water I used beef broth.  I also had a carton of fresh mushrooms, so I used those.  Family loved the dinner.

This was so good. I bought some pork steak today for the first time and was looking for something simple. It was a little salty, but I think I just added too much. The flavor and tenderness were just right though!! Thanks!

Yum, Yum!!! Very easy and delicious.  Made a few slight changes: used butterflied boneless pork chops (to cut down on the fat content) and an 8 oz. package of fresh mushrooms instead of canned (also used 98% fat free mushroom soup and browned the meat in spray butter rather than oil).  Served with mashed potatoes - definately a keeper.  Gonna try with chicken and chicken soup!!!

I used boneless pork chops instead and they were fantastic.  I also cut the canned soup & mushrooms to 1 can each and used 1/2 a pkg. of the lipton soup mix.  The pork was so tender you could cut it with a fork and the flavor was just great.  Will make again and again...

This recipe was delicious!  Since there is only my husband and I, I prepared two porksteaks.  I followed the recipe, except for I only used one can of cream of mushroom soup (b/c I only had the two pork steaks and not 4).  The flavor was great, and the excess soup mixture was not only a great covering for the pork but baked potatoes as well!
