This is what I have seen in different places called fry bread fried dough or sometimes even just fritters. In any case you usually can get this at a carnival or fair with fruit topping or powdered or granulated sugar or something like that. The pumpkin was a subtle touch and if you didn't know it was in there you might miss it as the flavor wasn't very strong. I might add some pumpkin pie spice to get a little more flavor in them. The recipe as is makes a LOT of 2" rounds and it could take you a long time to go through the dough if you use a small pan like I did so be aware of how many you need. I probably made about 40 with the original recipe. The dough was extremely wet and stuck to my hands so maybe I did something wrong. As I went along though the remaining dough dried out a bit and got a little tough to work with. I would say these are best when fresh out of the pan. After a day they are a little soggy but still very tasty. This is a good recipe!

It was okay but I wasn't a big fan. It was pretty bland and the dough was very sticky so that it was hard to make the balls to fry. Mine didn't really puff up that well and ended up doughy in the middle (my fault though I'm bad at frying things). I added some spices and a dollop of molasses to addd some flavor but it didn't help that much (and probably helped the dough become even stickier).

This recipe is for a fry bread...so why is there a picture of a LOAF of bread??? It is NOT made that way in the recipe directions either. The Indian Fry Bread is made by frying not made in a loaf.

This recipe was very bland and very sticky. I do believe if you add salt and pumpkin spice to this recipe it would be much better.
