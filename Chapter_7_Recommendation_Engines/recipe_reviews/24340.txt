Well, it's not a party without these little bite size treats! Who knew two little ingredients could produce something so good! I use a pizza cutter to cut the crescent dough and I always spray a bit of Pam so nothing sticks. I serve these with a variety of dipping sauces - bbq, honey mustard, spicy brown mustard, dijon, apricot jam mixed with a bit of bbq sauce, the possibilites are endless! One thing is for sure, these are always a hit and you're guests will definitely thank you!

I too have had these pigs in blankets before and have made them myself with the biscuit dough. I thought I would really like the crescent dough version but I actually think I like the flaky biscuit dough flavor and texture better. It probably doesn’t matter to a bunch of guys watching a football game though. I do admit I did use store brand crescent dough. Maybe that made a difference. For those who are confused about how to get the triangles to work here’s the technique; The crescent dough is basically a rectangle cut into large triangles with diagonal cuts from corner to corner of the rectangles. This makes the large triangles, in truth, 90-degree triangles with points off to one side. To make 4 small triangles out of each large crescent roll, 90 degree triangle, for the little cocktail size sausages: Lay one of the (8) large triangles out flat with the point pointing at you and the square corner on the left. About 1/3 of the way down cut the point off the triangle making 1 of the 4 small triangles. (Set that one aside or immediately roll it around a sausage.) You now have sort of a lopsided rectangle with 1 square corner (on the left) and one corner sticking out at an angle (on the right).  From the bottom edge (farthest away from you) move your knife leftward from the angled corner, on the right, about 1/3 of the length of that bottom edge. Make a diagonal cut to the upper (closest to you now) right-hand edge corner, where you cut the first small triangle off. You now hav

A variation I use as appetizers: cut each crescent roll into two triangles, otherwise they are too big for the sausage; brush the top of each triangle with your favorite BBQ sauce; place one sausage on the long side of each triangle and roll up; bake. Addictive!

I  have been making these for years!!  The way I make mine is to take each crescent rectangle, cut another diagonal, then straight down the middle and across like a + sign. If you do it for each rectangle it will give you enough to wrap 32.  I also brush with egg to give it a rich golden color and they come out beautiful.  My kids love them especially with the little cheddar smokies.

Ok, who doesn't love these? They are great any time of the year especially football season! Especially good served warm with mustard. Side note: I've found that one crescent can be cut in four strips so that one container of eight can wrap 32 cocktail sausages. Hope this helps! :-)

My mom used to make these on Sunday after church for a quick easy meal before we all had to rush off to soccer or volleyball or some other thing we were doing that day.  I use biscuit dough and regular sized hot dogs...we also split the hotdog and put in some cheese.  Thanks for the post and some great memories.

These are always a hit at our house - I often add them to holiday brunch.  I use a pizza roller to cut the triangles; it goes very quickly with little sticking.

Just made these tonight. I was able to cut each triangle into three  triangles so I was able to work with 24 smaller pieces of crescent triangles (some were deformed triangles, but the shapes didn't really matter much once they cook). One can of Pillsbury Crescent Rolls come with 8 triangles. I used about half of the Lil' Smokies package. These were good, but just a little salty for my and my family's tastes. It tasted better when we dipped it in maple syrup or mustard. I'll try these again, but will use a less saltier dog.

Instead of cocktail dogs, I used breakfast sausage links. When you portion the 8 perforated crescent rolls into 2 long rectangles, you can place 2 rows of 4 links.  Roll them like cigars, and then slice them into bite size pieces. I got about 16 bite size pieces out of one package of rolls and 8 links.  Yummy! Would be great with some mustard.

Not sure why this is a recipe.. it's right on the package of crescent rolls (at least the ones I had).  But, it's good and a good idea starter.

Can't go wrong with these! I just pressed the crescent roll triangles together and cut them into strips (the short way), then cut those in 1/2, stretched them enough to fit around the sausage and they were perfect in 12 minutes. Served them with BBQ sauce on the side. 1 pack of rolls covered just about a whole pack of sausages- I think I had 3 or 4 sausages left over. These don't last long, I'd recommend making a double batch! Good served warm or at room temp.

I make these using the Cheddar Lil' Smokies and serve it with the cherry preserves/BBQ OR grape jelly/BBQ sauce. They last about ten minutes.

Really good, my boys loved them.  Fifteen minutes was a little too long in my oven.  (I should've watched them more closely.)  especially delicious made with cheddar smokies!

cutting the crescent rolls per someone else's review- using pizza cutter, take each rectangle and cut another diagonal (opposite direction of the one thats already there), then cut vertical and horizontal to make +.  this gives 8 triangles per original rectangle...32 mini triangles per can (perfect for a pkg of smokies).

I make this the exact same way and people always love these pigs in a blanket!  

I just take each cresent roll and cut the triangle in half (into 2 skinnier triangles) with a pizza cutter.

Yum! I could not figure out how to cut the crescent rolls to get 24 triangles out of each (should have read more reviews) so I ended up using two cans of crescents for 32 piggies total. I did add a little square of cheese to each piggy. I think each piggy has the right amount of crescent dough on it. They are tasty and will be gobbled up at my event tonight! Mine took more than 15 minutes to cook.

Pretty good. I thought using Crescent Roll dough made this a little swwet, but it was quick and good overall. I used normal hot dogs cut in half as I find cocktail hot dogs too salty.

Quick, easy - and one of the hits of my Halloween party. I should have made a double batch. I served them with honey mustard for dipping - and I used lil cheddar smokies. These were tasty and fun. Thanks for the recipe!

My boyfriend loves these! I cook the sausages for a minute on the stove first--just to get them warm, and to get rid of that "liquid" that packaged meat has sometimes. I also add some cheddar cheese and cook following the directions on the can--after all the sausage is already cooked and warm and it doesnt take much to melt cheese.

Dividing the crescents into fifths was a good math exercise for the kids when they were little. We like this made with smoked sausages with cheese and mustard to dip them in.

This variation of what I grew up knowing as "Pigs-in-a-blanket" is a tasty appetizer.  I changed the recipe just a bit, and used apple cinnamon breakfast sausage.  Wonderfully delicious.  The kids (and myself of course) devoured them.

I doubled the recipe and also cut the triangles of the crescent dough in 1/2 and there wasn't even 1 left about 5-10mins after i put them out. Fabulous!!

Everyone loves this easy appetizer/snack....especially my kids!  When we have food days at work I will make them with a touch of sauerkraut and a dash of spicy mustard...reuben rollups!  They are always gone in no time.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I love these!  I always serve them with a side of honey mustard dressing as a dip.  Very quick and delicious.  You can experiment with the cresent dough and see how many different shapes you can make these.  Pigs in a sleeping bag...you get the idea. ;)

My husband makes these all the time for get togethers and they are phenomenal!!!  They are always a hit and the first things to go at parties!  You can enhance the recipe by putting mustard or cheese on the crescent roll before wrapping the little smokie.

Easy and delicious. I made it for the first time to take to a Christmas social of “finger foods.” Served with Zatarain’s Creole Spicy Mustard as a dipping sauce. Doubled the recipe and there were none left! Will definitely make again!

I used 1 can of dough and cut each crescent roll into 3rds, making 24 piggy wiggys. All my grands loved them and ate them up! Next time I’ll make double.

I read the other reviews before making this and microwaved the mini sausages for 45 seconds before making. I used Lit'l Beef Smokies and Pillsbury Crescent Dough and I came out wonderfully! I definitely recommend making this! It is fabulous! I cooked it for 15 mins at 375 F. For mini sausages you can cut each triangle of dough into 3, making it 24 triangles in one package of dough. This was a huge hit for my homeroom luncheon and I will definitely be making this again.

It isn't gourmet but it was great football food. I used buttery crescent roll dough and cut each triangle into four strips. I used Lil Smokies instead of hot dogs. Delicious.

Piggy Wiggys definitely turn the party around! They are great for parties, sleep overs, and family get togethers! I took them to one of my own sleepovers, and they were gone in ten minutes! And not even everyone got some! I would advise you though… bring more than one batch to a get together with more than three people, because they'll be gone before you can even say, "Wow! Those were great! Let me have another one!"

So I didn't end up using the two ingredients listed lol. The amount of dough and sausage is not very good. If you are making this for a BBQ or party, you should make at least 3X the amount listed. I made this for my office and got two packages of each. I was only able to have enough dough to make one entire package of the sausages. So the next time I make this I will probably buy 4 of the crescent roll packs and two sausage packs. That should make enough for about 25 people. The amount I made only fed 15 roughly and each person didn't get to have more than 2 each. I only ate one so that more people could have some lol.

I also cut each triangle into 3.  If you rinse the little smokies in water and pat dry, it solves the problem of them being too salty.

Any easy to make appetizer.  It even tastes great if you add some bacon.  My husband has made a dip to go with these with Jack Daniels BBQ sauce, mayo, and maple syrup.  It's great either way and you can do so much with this easy recipe.

I used Hillshire Farms chicken sausage and one can of crescent rolls for 40 sausages. I cut each triangle into 3 or 4 pieces using a pizza cutter. I placed the piggy wiggy on a parchment lined cookie pan for easier cleanup and baked for 15 minutes. Served with BBQ sauces and mustards--horseradish and regular mustard. I prefer the chicken sausage which is less greasy than any other sausage. Delicious!

Great taste and so easy too!  Made some with cheese and without.  (The cheese did tend to melt out of the crescent, even with careful placement, but they were really good regardless.) Will definitely make again.

Just as it should taste! I even used turkey dogs and still thoroughly enjoyed these. No need to do anything but tear dough at perforation and roll up the dogs. We served at a bachelorette party where we called them porkers in bed.

What is not to like about this simple but delicious recipe? I made one batch while the guys were outside playing football, and only 2 were left when they got back inside. They whined so much I had to make another batch, which disappeared equally fast. They really are good!

I have made both ways with mini dogs as a snack or with regular hot dogs also slit in the middle and put american cheese inside then wrap. The recipe is on the side of the cresant roll can.

These were really good - I used hot dogs and added cheese.  :)  Even my kids loved them!  My mom said she used to eat them as a kid too.
