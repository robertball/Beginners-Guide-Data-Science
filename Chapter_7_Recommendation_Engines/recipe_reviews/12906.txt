The first person to taste this chili asked for the recipe!  I did make the following changes and additions...3 chicken breasts instead of 4, 1 can of diced green chilis, 2 teaspoons fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder, 16 ounce can of diced tomatoes, and 2 teaspoons sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes.  OTHERWISE, this was a great recipe and will be added to my winter repertoire!  Thanks.

This recipe has become a staple in my house.  I find that simply throwing it all in together in one step turns out just as good.  I cook on low for 8 hours, and then just stir.  The chicken just falls apart.  I add some cayenne for a kick.  Very yummy.

So yummy!  I used black beans, as others had done and I used frozen corn because I just can't stand canned corn.  I took the chili and made chicken enchiladas with it, it was wonderful!  You can eat this as a chili or use the meat for tacos, enchiladas, taco salad, etc.  You are only limited by your imagination!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Unlike everyone else, I followed the recipe precisely, and it was still delicious and so, saved to the "recipe box."

I baked the chicken the previous night and so it marinated all day in the fridge with the salsa and spices. I may try adding black beans the next time. Yes, there will defintely be a next time!

This is a great recipe!  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to drain the juice from the corn or the beans, so I reserved it to see how soupy it would be.  I ended up not adding the juice, so it would be heartier.  We put the chili in tortillas, added sour cream & shredded cheese, and ate them like burritos. Had chips on the side as well.  I used kidney beans, black beans, and regular corn.  I also added a can of chopped tomatoes with green chiles.  This recipe would be great for a group of people. (I used a 5 qt crock)  We had a lot left over with 3 people eating, so I am going to try to freeze my leftovers.

Oh so yummy!!  I always stray from the original recipe some.  I used frozen chicken breasts and cubed them after it cooked for a while.  I added a can of diced tomatoes chili style, medium salsa, black beans, pinto beans, kidney beans, diced green chilies, mexicorn and white chicken chili seasoning.  I also used a little chicken broth so it wouldn't dry out.  It was excellent!  Served with tortilla chips, sour cream and shredded cheese!  Can't wait for lunch leftovers :-)  Thanks for sharing.

Like others, I added a can of green chiles and used black beans (personal preference).  For sake of time, I used a can of white chicken breast in water...tasted great, wouldn't have known the difference.  Served with cheese, sour cream and avocado.  Leftovers will be tacos.  Thanks!

LoVeD this one! I started cooking in the morning though. No need to cook through the night unless you have to have it ready to eat by 8 am! I used fresh salsa instead of that yucky canned stuff. Instead of putting it in a bowl, we rolled it up in some whole wheat/corn tortilla's and added red onion, cheese and shredded lettuce. I'll make this one again for sure!

what a tasty soup. it was perfect considering the horrible weather we are having! i took the advice of another viewer and used enchilada sauce instead of salsa. it was very good that way. i used fresh garlic instead of powder, and i used more chicken then called for jsut because we like a very hearty chili( and because the enchilada sauce i used was a little thin)I was very pleased with the taste, may add a couple more spices to it in the future...

I am simmering the last of this now and it smells wonderful and the taste is great. I did my own version. I used 6 breast and instead of salsa, I did 2 cans of enchillada sauce because my family hates salsa. I added 2 cans of chicken broth so it wasn't so thick.  I also added just plain canned corn and 3 cans of chilli beans in mild sauce. Can't wait to eat for supper. I will defiantly make this recipe again.

I'm giving 4 stars even though my husband thinks this soup/chili is the only thing he'll ever need to eat!  I just got tired of it before finishing my bowl.  It has a ton of flavor, but maybe too much chicken??  I will definitely be making it again for him, but I do think I will cut the chicken in half to 2 breasts.

this was delicious and tasted exactly like my all time favorite soup: southwest tortilla soup from chilies!! i only had 1 cup of salsa, so used 1 cup of diced canned tomatoes as well; added a can of diced green chilies, and substituted black beens for the pinto beans..it was amazingly easy to prepare and tasted incredible topped with cheddar cheese, green onions, sour cream and crushed tortilla chips...the best part about it though is that by day three of leftovers, it tasted even better than the first day!!

This is the best chicken chili recipe I have tried.  I doubled up on the spices and added a chopped jalapeno and a can of green chilis.  This is a great healthy, hearty chili for a cold winter's day.

Great healthy chili recipe. I made it for Superbowl Sunday and it was a hit. Changes to the recipe:  I used 3 boneless chicken breasts and that was plenty. As other reviews did, I added a can of diced green chili peppers, 1 whole fresh jalapeño pepper, and fresh garlic and a can of small diced tomatoes with jalapeños. I doubled the spices and used small red kidney beans. I cooked the chicken salsa and minced tomatoes on low for about 6 hours (no need to do this overnight) on low and then added 16 oz bag of defrosted frozen corn and the beans and cooked on low for another two hours. I may add another fresh jalapeño pepper the next time.

This is so easy and so good!  I made it as directed and used frozen chicken breats.  Put the cooled chili in individual bags and froze.  I take one with me to work, put it in the fridge, and nuke it for lunch.  It's really good!

This was very good. I made it just as written so I could give it an accurate review. Very easy. Turned out very thick. I can see it would be easy to adjust according to personal taste.

Couldn't believe how easy this was, or how GOOD!  Did add the canned chilis, substitued fresh garlic and black beans, and combined canned diced tomatoes (Mexican style) with some leftover salsa and simmered all day in a crock pot.  Throw a little lite sour cream before serving, and WOW!

Very Good!  Thanks for the recipe!  We are trying to stick to a Heart Healthy Diet and I was glad to have something other than the blah Chicken and rice.  I used low sodium everthing except for the salsa.  Not sure how to cut the sodium on that one.  I also used red kidney beans.  Yummy..Yummy!

Great recipe for a cold night and some football!  The chicken did not take nearly as long as the recipe called for.  I cooked it for around 4 hours, then shredded it and added all the other ingredients.  I used frozen corn instead of canned and added a can of chicken broth.  Next time I may try using it as burrito filling as some of the other reviews suggested.

super easy and great!  thanks!  i added a can of diced tomatoes, because i love tomato.  i also used black beans instead of pintos (just what i had on hand).  i am gone all day and have to use my "10 hour" setting on my crockpot.  it turned out perfect! chicken was tender.   definitely a keeper in my house!   if anyone's wondering - this is 2 weight watcher points per serving.

I made this in our new crockpot for my new husband. I usually make fairly elaborate meals with multiple pots and pans and clean up, and had never used a crockpot before. Threw the ingedients in before I left for work, dinner was ready when I got home. Super easy, one pot clean up. I served with sour cream, tabasco on the side and tortilla chips. My husband had three servings!  He told me it was one of his favorite meals I'd ever made!  I added a can of black beans, a can of green chiles to the mix. Delish and plenty of leftovers which were even better the next day!

I literally had all the ingredients in my slow cooker in 7 minutes flat... WOW.  Now THAT is a quick meal.  And this chili is SOOOOO good stuffed into tortillas with some lettuce and sour cream. Heavenly!  Thank you, Sarah Jane, for such a great quick meal.  Perfect for this busy working woman!

Made this using a "fresher" refrigerated salsa from the produce section, added a can of diced tomatoes and used chickpeas instead of pintos or kidney beans. It was fantastic!  Going to make it again this weekend.  Really tasty with a nice shredded Mexican cheese blend on top.

WOW!  This was so easy and delicious, even my DH who said "you don't but chicken in chili, make sure that Domino's is on standby", ate 2 bowls!  The only think I did differently was cut my chicken into cubes and cooked it in some EVOO with the spices.  Threw it in the slow cooker with everything else, plus a can of Rotel Tomatoes.   DH says, "make sure you work this in to the rotation!" Thank you so much for sharing this yummy meal!

Added 3/4 to 1 cup chicken broth, 2 cups frozen corn thawed, 1 can pinto beans and 1 can black beans drained, 2 tblsp minced garlic, 1 can tiny diced tomatoes, 1 can diced green chilies.  About 45 minutes before done add corn and beans. My husband who  has always said my old chili recipe was his favorite raved about this one.  Best of all it is low in calories.

I give this recipe 5 stars because I have been making it for almost 10 years now & have only made minor tweaks.  It is tasty, easily editable, can easily feed more if you have surprise guests (just add more beans & corn, no one really notices) and takes about 5 minutes to make.  What is not to like?  I have made these changes over the years - the night before I follow the recipe and I add a can of rotel, and few splashes of hot sauce.  Day of I cook it up but just throw in a bag of frozen corn & a can of beans; I find you don't need mexican corn if you use the rotel, and I almost always have everything on hand except mexi-corn.  Thank you Sarah Jane for a great recipe!

I joined AllRecipes to review this recipe. I am eating a bowl of this chili as I write.  This recipe is wonderful!  I have made it probably 20 times in the past year or so. It is so easy and so tasty!  I am asked for the recipe all the time!
Here are my modifications (from other reviewers): I use black beans instead of pinto, use plain corn, add a can of diced tomatoes and a can of green chilis.  We top with sour cream, grated cheddar and Fritos.  
I am on the South Beach Diet right now and without the corn or fritos, this meal qualifies for even the strict Phase 1 diet plan!

Wonderful and simple to make! We have had this many many times.  It has made it into the regular rotation at our house.  

Here are some variations.

1) experiment with all kinds of different salsas.
2) black beans and pinto beans
3) add chicken stock to make it more soup-like

Tonight I am trying pork!  How could that be bad right?

The whole family ate it! That in itself is amazing. Mine was not soupy like in the picture. It was much thicker.  The hubby and I ate it in tortillas and the kids ate it out of bowls. I will make this again. Especially since it was SOOOO easy. Oh, I did do it all at once, not overnight.

Very good. I used pace picante sauce which is a thinner than salsa so I decided to add a can of tomatoes with chilis. It was good and flavorful. Instead of using the chili powder I just used part of a chili seasoning packet I had. It's very meaty, I used three good sized chicken breasts and it was very meaty with little broth. Still delicious though.

not sure how to add 1/2 stars--this was SOOO easy and good--I added a 4oz can of green chilies--used about 2 tsps of jarred garlic instead of powder--no corn (didn't have any & not a big fan of corn in chili or burritos)--cooked for about 8 hours, shredded the chicken, added a can of drained & rinsed black beans--cooked for 2-3 more hours--and put in large flour taco shells--added lettuce, onion and whatever toppings we desired--very good--I love easy and good crock pot recipes--thanks for sharing!

Delicious but will try a different proportion next time - seemed like it could use more ingredients other than chicken.  I used 1.5 chicken breasts instead of 2, black beans instead of pinto, and frozen corn instead of canned.  Next time will try the same plus a can of kidney or pinto beans, can of diced tomatoes, can of diced green chilis, and top with sour cream, green onions and sliced black olives.  Great as dip, burritos or tacos.  Want to try on greens for taco salad, and as enchilada meat.  Yum!

Great recipe!  I have made this about four times now and have come up with my own variation.  First off - I poach the chicken in chicken broth then shred it and add it to my crockpot along with a big jar of salsa, two cans of mexican corn, two cans of drained black beans and the seasonings.  Mix it up and let it cook away in the crockpot for about four hours on low to let all the flavors blend together.  I haven't had a problem with my black beans getting mushy or anything and I have let it cook for up to six hours.  I serve this with crushed up tortilla chips, sour cream, mexican shredded cheese and green onion.  The whole family (even my picky eater) love this.  Make double the recipe and save it for later on in the week for a taco or burrito filler!

I did not find that this chili had much flavor at all.  It isn't bad, just kind of lacking.  I think it may have something to do with the salsa I used, but am not sure.  I'm not sure I'd try it again to find out.  I also like chili with a bit more broth, which this does not really have.  I might consider making a taco with the meat tomorrow and seeing how that tastes.

Delicious! We get tired of regular chili so this is a nice change up. I put black beans & sweet corn in mine along with pre-mixed chili seasoning. Used a can of ro-tel and about half a jar of salsa. Top with some cheese or sour cream & put on a flour tortilla...can't beat it!

I started out following this recipe but ended up changing it so much that I hesitated to rate it. The one thing I really got from it was to use salsa....I never would have thought of that and it was an excellent addition!  I used a 16 oz. Jar of medium salsa and a 6 oz can of jalepeno salsa.  I hate shredding any kind of meat and will avoid it at all costs so I cubed my chicken (2 large breasts)and sauted it in a little olive oil along with one chopped 
onion. Threw that in the slow cooker along with 1 can drained and rinsed black beans, 1 can chili beans and 1 can pinto beans, 1 can tomato sauce, 2 cans rotel tomatoes with green chilis, the salsas and about 1/4 cup of chicken broth. Left out the corn because we don't like it in our chili. Seasoned with 2 1/2 tsp. Garlic powder, 1 tsp. Sugar and just used 2 packets of chili seasoning mix. I have always found this has the perfect blend of seasoning for chili so that is what I use. Ladled the chili over top fritos and topped with shredded sharp cheese and chopped onions. Next time will probable add at least one more chicken breast but this was Absolutely delicious with just the 
right amount of kick!

This is a really good recipe, but if you're craving more traditional chili this might not be for you.  To me if was more like a chunky tortilla soup.  After my initial tasting I added a few dashes of hot sauce & topped with greek yogurt and it was delish!

Very good, hearty, and so so easy.  I didn't cook the chicken overnight, but cooked everything together for about 4 hours on high, then shredded the chicken and cooked another hour on low.  I put in bread bowls and added avocado and sour cream for lunch.  This makes a ton of chili--I packed a couple of bags for the freezer, and we still have enough leftovers for a couple of meals.  We really enjoyed this one.  I added a little bit of chicken broth and a little more salsa since I had a bit leftover and didn't want to put it in the fridge.  I thought about adding sweet peppers but didn't think about it until it was too late--I'm sure it would go well in this.  Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved this one and it couldn't be easier.  I multiplied it by 1.5 so I could use a 28 oz. jar of "Great Value" medium salsa from WalMart and the 6 chicken breasts I had in the fridge..    Instead of the mexicorn I used a can or regular corn and added some minced up red bell peppers.    Next time I will add a can of tomato sauce because my teenage daughter commented that it was perhaps a little too chunky and she'd prefer it a bit more "saucy".    All in all, it's an inexpensive tasty family supper.

So absolutely delicious!  You just can't beat a slow-cooked chicken chili.  After reading the reviews I decided to just throw everything in together and cook on LOW for 8 hours and it was wonderful.  I added cayenne pepper as well as a little bit of our own blend of taco seasoning spices and served topped with cheese, sour cream & crushed tortilla chips.  Divine!

Yum!  This is delicious!  I chunked the chicken instead of shredding it and added the following, 3 cloves of fresh garlic minced, 1/2 cup chicken broth, can of pinto beans, can of black beans, can of red kidney beans, can of mexican two-tone corn, can of diced tomatoes with green chillis, jar of medium chunky Pace salsa,  a packet of white chicken chili seasoning mix, and some extra powdered garlic and onion, salt, pepper, & chili powder.  I also added a sprinkling of red pepper flakes, but next time want to add a little bit more heat (spiciness).  I served it with fresh guacamole, sour cream, shredded mexican cheese & tortilla chips.  This was a hit and everyone who tasted it loved it!  I'll definitely be making it again, and adding some cayenne or something to heat/spice it up a notch. Thanks for the great recipe!  It's so easy and tasty!

I make this with homemade salsa, homemade taco seasoning and two cans of black beans. This is excellent to eat on for lunch during the week. Filling and cost-effective. A half cup of this is really good over half of a baked potato. NOTE: If you have a partial rotisserie chicken, that'll work in this recipe well.

A wonderful chili recipe! It was a nice alternative to the traditional beef and bean chili. I added one can of chopped tomatoes and their juice to the slow cooker in the beginning. I used kidney and black beans since those were the only ones I had on hand. After a garnish of sour cream, shredded cheddar cheese and onion, this recipe became a fmaily favorite!

I added a can of chopped tomatoes and used black beans instead of pinto.  It was very good but lacked a chili taste.  Next time I will add more chili spice.  I used the suggestion of tortilla chips and cheese which made this a kind of tex-mex dish which we really enjoy.

The aroma was so good it woke me up at 1am.  I added a couple of extra cans of beans and some diced tomatoes since it was VERY meaty.  Overall, one of the best slow-cooker recipes i've had!

Very Tasty.  I used 1 container of fresh hot salsa, 1/2 jar mild salsa, 1 can of mild green chilis.  I cooked everything for 7 hours, shredded the chicken and added a can of rotel, frozen corn, pinto and black beans (cooked from dried beans instead of a can).  Then I cooked the chili for another 4 hours.  This is very easy.

Was excellent! I used 2 cans of pinto beans and 1 can of kidney beans and chicken tenders. I cooked it on high for 1 hour and 30 minutes and put it on low for 3 hours. It was great! Thank u for the recipe. An easy 5 star dish!

This was so easy and delicious! I threw the chicken and salsa (I used this recipe: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/salsa/detail.aspx ) in the pot in the morning and left it for about 6 hours then added the corn and black beans (instead of pinto) after about 6 hours. 
The chili wasn't very soupy--It was more of a shredded chicken with beans and corn but it was AMAZING! It tasted delicious.
Instead of using it as a soup I put it on homemade tortilla chips.  It worked great as a topping. 
With the remaining chicken I am going to use it as a burrito filling with tortillas.
Very versatile dish and super easy to make!! :)

I made this recipe exactly as stated and it turned out great.  I did not drain the liquid from the corn or beans and the consistency was perfect.  However, there was a lot of chicken so I think you could easily get away with 2 or 3 breasts instead of 4.  I am looking forward to trying this with different salsa and bean combinations such as pineapple salsa with black beans. Yum!

I am giving this four stars because it smelled wonderful, but seemed to be missing something in the way of flavor kick. My hubby suggested maybe a little taco seasoning next time. I also would do 2 or 3 chicken breasts as another review suggested because it was mostly shredded chicken. I loved the combo, though, and hope to make this again with a little pizazz...Thanks!
**I am updating my review to a "5" because we did a re-try on this recipe after the leftovers were frozen and thawed a week later. This must have been the trick for the flavor meld, because I would NOT have added anything the second time, and it was very good! Fresh out of the oven was not the flavor best for this dish! Definitely needed a little time to "meld."

This recipe was really good - but I wouldn't call it chili.  I definitely had something else in mind when I picked this recipe.  It's great though to fill tortillas with and have chicken tacos - a very easy, versatile recipe.

This was a hit. I used 3 frozen chicken breasts and just put everything in all at once including adding an additional can of red beans. Cooked on LOW 8 hours and it was awesome!!! We put it on top of crushed tortilla chips and topped with shredded cheddar and sour cream. :o)

I gave this recipe four stars out of 5, mainly because while it had an excellent taste, it didn't have the consistency of chili.  It was way too thick.  But, not wanting to give up on a great taste, I modified it a little and used it as a filling for enchiladas.  I rolled about a two tablespoons of the mixture plus a tablespoon or so of shredded jack cheese into each corn tortilla, ending up with a full 12 enchiladas in a 9 x 13 pan.  Then I topped in with a can of enchilada sauce and some more cheese, baked at a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes.  Delicious!  Plus there was a good amount of chili left over for freezing and using another night.

Since I just bought my crock pot the day before, I didn't feel comfortable straying from my first recipe, so I made it exactly how it is written, including starting it the night before (it helped that I go to bed late, so I started it at 1am!).  The chicken was sooooo moist and tender, I'm glad I cooked it overnight!  Since it wasn't clear in the original recipe, I did take others' advice and didn't drain the corn or beans.  No, not really the consistency of traditional chili, but I'm not going to knock the recipe over semantics.  AWESOME with tortilla chips and my kids loved it!

Would give 5 stars, but I never use store bought canned food so. . . . I added my own beans I soaked the night before.   I cooked a chicken breast on the stove until almost done then followed the instructions.  Added fresh corn that I had canned myself.  Served with homemade corn tortillas.  Flavor was really good.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I really don't have anything to add from what others have said, except that you DEFINITELY don't want to use extra chicken ... there is barely enough broth as it is.  Serve with shredded cheese, sour cream, Fritos or other corn chips. :D

This recipe was extremely disappointing.  I added fresh garlic, bought a great salsa, used black beans (two 16 ounce cans), 3/4 cup chicken broth, and diced tomatoes.  I thought I had followed must of the improvement tips of others.  I thought this chili was bland and boring at best.  No one in my family liked it and there has been a huge fight over who HAS to eat the leftovers.  No one wants it.  I will go back to making my beef chili recipe from weight watchers which is 300 times better!

I made this last night and it was VERY good.  I'm not sure what I did differently, but it only took 4 hours on low, and there wasn't that much liquid in it by the time it was done. (Maybe it's my crockpot?) Next time I'll try adding a can of tomatoes and maybe an envelope of taco seasoning or more chili powder for a little more spice.
Update: I just made this again and added 1 can of tomatoes with green chilis and increased the spices.  It was a solid 5!!!

Loved this recipe. I made some modifications by seasoning the chicken with the spices and than "dumping" the rest of the ingredients on top. I used 1 can black beans, 1 can northern beans, 1 can rotel tomatoes, 1 can corn, small can chopped green chilis and a chopped onion along with refridgerated salsa. Cooked 6 hours on low and than shredded the chicken. This was great with some cheddar cheese on top. Also rolled in tortillas topped with enchilada sauce and cheese and baked.

This is a great recipe! Easy to make and great for company.  I serve it with Spanish Rice, avacado, sour creme, cheese, cilanto,and homemade salsa.  Sometimes we eat it in a bowl with tortilla chips and sometimes wrapped in flour tortillas. I do agree with one of the other reviews that the salsa you choose has an affect on the chili. My friends and guest alike all love this. Thanks for sharing it!

I use Salpica Roasted Corn & Bean Salsa with this, add diced tomatoes and black beans instead of pinto beans.  It is a HUGE hit wherever I take it! Awesome recipe!

Fabulous recipe, although I did make some modifications based on other reviewers suggestions.  I added a can of petite diced tomatoes and a can of diced green chilis and used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  Also, because I only had frozen corn, I used that instead of the canned corn and I substituted black beans for the pinto beans (just my family's preference).  It came out great.  We prefer to use it as a burrito filling along with some rice, shredded cheese and sour cream.  Even my four year old thinks this is fantastic.  She asked if I could make it every night.  I'm guessing that it would freeze quite well.  I may make a double batch in my 6qt crockpot next time and freeze half.  That would make an extremely easy meal even easier the second time around!

Wow!  Very good.  I added about a cup of cooked rice, some tomato sauce and diced tomatoes, and a can of mild chili beans.  We liked a little kick as well so I threw in a few dashes of cayenne pepper.  We just ate the 2nd day remains rolled up in tortillas.

This was fantastic!  Great flavor and the chicken was so tender!  I used black beans, because I just like them better.  Also, since I used more chicken than the recipe calls for (chicken tenders instead of chicken breasts, but it all shreds up in the end anyway), it was so thick we rolled it in tortillas.  Delicious!  (And so easy!)

Very easy, different main dish to try.  Didn't like the looks of it cooking, but when it was done the tasting said it all.  Wonderful.  We eat ours as a dip with corn chips and added cheese and sour cream.  Yummy!

Absolutely delish. I have to say, I didn't look at the instructions prior to getting things together...the day of. Hadn't realized it was a slow cooker recipe and when I realized. I quickly ran decided to use the precooked chicken I had on hand, chunked it up smaller and followed the ingredients and instruction, but just combining the ingredients all together. I did noticed to my own accord, it needed a little more liquid. Now I will say, in the ingredient list, it didn't say whether or not to drain the corn and pinto beans...so I didn't drain. And after cooking for an hour, I realized it did need slightly more liquids, I added a small 4 oz can of tomato sauce with an additional 4 oz of water. I can say, that had I followed through with the directions, I might have had a little more liquid. But since I realize that my pho-barb, I made accomendations to adjust when it was needed. My family loved the recipe very much and can see me making again. This time, to the recipe. ;-) It was really good. TY

I didnt like this very much, I followed the directions almost exactly except maybe i had 5 chicken breasts..I added a little water, it seemed thick..not much.  I added some slap Ya mama cajun seasoning, pepper and a little cayenne.  it was very bland! :-( Next time I would double all the seasonings and double the salsa and maybe do some things others suggested

This was delicious and EASY, I don't have a slow cooker so just used my stove and cooked it all afternoon.  My only recommendation is to perhaps try a low sodium salsa as it was just a little too salty at first.  I added some boiling water to the mixture about 15 minutes before I was going to serve it and it was fine.  The chili is also a great topping for a salad or stuffing for a burrito the next day!

This was a lovely change to the usual chili.  I used Ol Del Paso salsa (mild) and just used regular corn (hubby doesn't really like corn in the first place, so I didn't want to go TOO weird with a first-time recipe).  I also added a can of diced tomatoes and glad I did because I think the salsa would have been too overpowering on it's own.  We both enjoyed this recipe - Only change next time would be to add some some tomatoe paste as well as hubby and I found it a bit too watery.  But excellent change and a bit healthier too from regular beef chili!

Delicious!  I didn't have time to cook the breast overnight so I just picked up a whole roasted chicken from the grocery and shredded it.  It adds a lot of flavor.  I just put it in a pot on the stove and it cooked within 30 minutes. This mixture can be used for tacos, tortillas.  This is very similar to mixture I put in my enchilada casserole.

Good!  I added about 3/4 can of chicken broth and still coulda used more!  It would have been SO thick!  Also definitely making my own salsa next time for this one cause the one I chose was a little to sweet for me.  Overall good flavor.  Thanks!

This was delicious! I made it for a friend who just had a heart attack (since it's very good for you) and he loved it.  So did my picky husband.  I did use a little more salsa towards the end.  About another half a jar.  Otherwise perfect.  Will make again and again.

This was a HUGE success my family. After browning the chicken I dumped all of the ingredients in the pot and cooked it on high for 6 hours. I shredded the chicken when it was finished and it was amazing!

We really liked this-I didn't put the ingredients in the slow cooker the night before I made this-I just let the chicken simmer for about 6 hours on low and then shredded it and added the corn and beans and let those cook together for another hour.  Great meal.

The taste was okay, but the texture reminded me too much of BBQ chicken (and since I don't enjoy BBQ, that was a bad thing).

This is so yummy! I add about 4 cups of chicken broth. It's great in the crockpot, or you can boil the chicken in the chicken broth and then chop it, and add the chopped chicken back to the broth with all the other ingredients and simmer until flavors are blended and everything is hot. Great with or without cheese.

This was so!! so!!! good!!!!!  I cut up the raw chicken into cubes.  Added a small can of diced green chilis, a 16 oz can diced tomatoes, and 2 teas of sugar.  Went to work..Came home to the house smelling so yummy. Cooked on low, for 11 hours!!!  Was a cold rainy night and this hit the spot.  Served over spanish rice. Will be one of our favorites!!!

My kids and I enjoyed this.  Next time I will probably decrease the chicken a bit.  It was very thick as is.  So I decided not to drain the corn, and to only partially drain the beans and this did the trick.  For those thinking the recipe calls for you to cook the chicken overnight- I don't think this was what was intended.  I think it means marinate the chicken in the salsa in the fridge overnight.  I didn't do this but it was plenty tasty without.

Made my whole kitchen smell great. I used frozen chicken breast, but learned it made tearing the chicken up harder. I also used black beans instead of pinto. I also added 1 can of chicken broth for more flavor and added parboiled rice.

So very easy to make and such a wonderful flavor this chili has.  I did add some red pepper flakes for some added punch and corn chips crushed on the top of each serving.  I have made this 3 time now in the past two months!

I'm eating this right now, and it is wonderful. I followed other reviewers suggestions and added a can of black beans and diced tomatoes. I also slightly increased the amounts of the spices and I threw it all into the crock pot at once and cooked it on low for a little over 8 hours. Perfect for a cold, dark day!

My husband ate three portions he loved it so much. It's so easy - you don't really have to shred the chicken. I drained and put the corn and beans in about 20 minutes before serving so they wouldn't be too mushy.

I made this as a healthy, low-fat hot lunch that I could enjoy at work.  As it was cooking today, I loved the aroma and--I admit it--I had to life the slow-cooker lid a few times to taste it.  I can't wait to have some at lunch!  I did add a can of tomatoes with green peppers and onions, as well as about 1.5 cups of vegetable broth to thin out the texture a bit, to meet my preferences.

This recipe won't make it to my recipe box unless I change it quite a bit. I followed the recipe, but it was very dry and looked more like a stew. So I started to doctor it up. First, I added a can of stewed, diced tomatoes. Still not juicy. So I added a can of enchilada sauce (it was all I had in the house). I also added 2 tsp. minced garlic. Now the soup was too tomatoey, so I added 2 tablespoons of cocoa. Much better, but the chicken seemed out of place. IF there is a next time, I will follow my suggestions, but use ground beef instead of the chicken. I have a much easier, and better tasting recipe for chicken chili!

This is very tasty! I used 6 breasts and doubled all other ingredients.  Served over rice and the whole family loved it.  I will definitely be making this again.  Next time I may put the mixture in tortillas - would make great enchiladas.

Very good but I wouldn't serve it just as an entree, best wrapped in tortilla or over rice or potatoes. I did it exactly as recipe.

This was very good.  I used 2 cans of Rotel instead of salsa (I was out) and added black beans and a can of chili beans.  I also added some chicken broth to dilute it a bit.  Very delicious.

This recipe was so yummy.  Made enough to freeze too. I added a little stock to the chili and think it added an extra touch.

Definately a keeper.  Thanks!

EXCELLENT! My husband's chili has always been "top dog" at our house, until I made this chicken and corn chili. We can't get enough!  I followed some of the tips from others who have tried it and it comes out great!  I cooked the chicken for a couple of hours on high in the slow cooker and then shred it and add the other ingrediants, then turn to low for a couple more hours.  I use black beans and a can of white Northern beans instead of pinto, regular canned corn, and a can of Rotel and small can of green chilles.  That's what's so great about this recipe, you can throw in whatever suits you tastes and it turns out great every time.  Will definitely make over and over again!!

We really liked this.  I used frozen chicken breasts and just chucked them in the slow cooker with the salsa in the morning.  When I got home I added the other ingredients (I used black beans and added a can of Rotel) and cooked it on high for an hour or so.  Ready just at the right time for dinner!  And, this may have been the easiest recipe I've ever made.  Next time I will add more vegetables but I loved the flavor.

I made this for my husband to take to work, so I didn't get to taste it personally and, even worse, I have to rely on his report back to me. :)  At any rate, he said the chicken was amazingly tender and flavorful.  He started it in a crockpot as soon as he got to work in the morning (he's a firefighter) and was able to eat it for dinner that evening.  He said it was ultra-easy to prepare, (although I had also premeasured the spices for him).  The only difference in the  version we tried was that we used black beans and regular corn, then served it with shredded cheddar and sour cream on flour tortillas.  He said it was definitely a recipe to use again and he felt our kids would love it.  He said he would have liked to have eaten it with some extra heat, like jalapenos, but I don't think it would be fair to lower the rating on the recipe for that... we tend to like things extra hot.  Thank you for a healthful, easy, and tasty recipe.

This one really deserves its five star rating!  Yummie!  I needed it for a large crowd.  I sliced 4 whole chicken breasts horizontally to make 8 halves(approximately 3 pounds total) and then doubled the rest of the ingredients in a large crockpot.  Although instead of doubling the pinto beans, I used just one can of pinto beans and then one can of black beans.  For our taste, it took just a smidge over 1 teaspoon of salt and 3/4 teaspoon of pepper.  I put the crockpot on low at 11 p.m. and it was perfect at 5:30 a.m. the next morning.  I just turned it off for a little while until I was ready to add the corn and beans and let it cook for another 2 hrs. 45 minutes.  Wonderful recipe - Thank You!

Wow... this was pretty good stuff.  I also added 1 can of diced, canned tomatoes, and an extra can of corn and 1 can of small white beans including the extra juices.  I even bought a rotisserie chicken from the market and shredded the chicken before adding it to the crock-pot thus making this recipe super easy and delicious.  We used it as filling for burritos and had plenty of leftovers to freeze.

Oh, this is soooo good ~ incredibly warm, filling & satisfying. All of us loved it!  I did make a handful of changes ... only used 3 chix breasts, doubled the cumin & used 1 can black beans & 1 can kidney beans (instead of 2 cans pinto).  After reading other reviews, I was afraid it would be too dense (I really wanted something more soup-like), so I added a can of chix broth.  I wish I had some tomatoes to throw in ~ would have been a great addition.  After cooking, we spiced ours up with some hot sauce & red pepper flakes ~ need a bit more oomph for our family's tastes.  Garnished with shredded cheddar & served corn muffins on the side.  Perfect cold-weather dish ... highly recommend this recipe.

WOW!  This was fantastic and went FAST.  I made some alterations, based on other reviews: add one can diced tomatoes, used fresh salsa, frozen corn, used black beans instead of pinto, and added a can of red kidney beans.  Will make again and again, I'm sure!  Especially good with sour cream, cheddar and cornbread!

This was very good!  I, too, made some changes.  I only had a little bit of salsa so I added a can of diced tomatoes.  I used 2 chicken breasts.  I had about 2 cups of homemade chicken broth in the freezer so I threw that in too.  Then I used black beans and frozen corn.  Served with light sour cream and corn muffins.  A great meal!

We really enjoyed this dish.  Even my 15-year-old loved it.  We wished we had thought to include flour tortillas on our shopping list... but instead we had tortilla chips were also great with it!  We'll have this one again and again.

Oh man, this was amazing! I couldn't find any Mexican style corn so I just used a can of regular corn and a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies. I also used about half the amount of chicken. I wasn't sure how thick it would come out, so I decided later to add about a cup of chicken broth and it came out the perfect consistency for my taste. I will most definitely make this recipe again!

Such a simple, bare bones recipe yet very flavorful! This is one I'll put right into my 'kids night to cook' folder as it would be dead easy for them to pull off. Yay! I followed the recipe save for using frozen corn and a can of diced green chilies for the Mexican style corn which isn't an item found on my grocery store shelf. I would recommend leaving the salt out until you do a taste test at the end as it likely will end up too salty for you otherwise.

Extremely easy to make.  Didn't come out as spicy as I was hoping, so I'll make adjustments next time.  Isn't exactly what I'd call a chili, either, but as others have written, I'd use it to make tacos or a part of other meals.

SO EASY... and fun to change it up.  It's great for a beginner.  Don't be afraid to spice it up.. Or even drain it a bit and use for taco's!

very good! I used 8 frozen chicken breasts, more than doubled the spices, one can of mexicorn, one can of regular corn, 2 cans of black beans, one can of diced tomatoes and a large jar of medium heat salsa. Shredded the chicken and served as chili day one and made tacos with it on day two.

I used black beans, regular corn and a can of diced tomatoes with green chillis.  I just threw it all in the crock pot together and then shredded the chicken about 30 minutes before serving and added the corn.  I was kinda worried when it was cooking because it didn't look like it had enough liquid after I shredded the chicken and it smelled kinda bad.  But it was really good!  We put cheese and sour cream on it.  Even my picky husband liked it.  Tonight we are putting the leftovers in soft tacos.  Will make again.

Pretty good! Threw everything in crock pot at once. Chicken was frozen so cooked for 8-9 hours. Also threw in diced tomatoes with chilis. Topped with sour cream, cheese and Fritos/

I didn't see any need to cook chicken breasts for a long time, so cut them into bite sized chunks, sauteed them in veg. oil after sprinking with some of the seasonings, then added 1 cup of Pace picante, 1 can of mostly drained Ro-tel tomatoes, 1 can of mixed chili beans (pinto/black/kidney), a 11-oz can of yellow/white shoepeg corn, and to the other seasonings, added a tsp of oregano and coriander.  Simmered for about 30 minutes on low heat, and it was delish!

Very tasty quick chili. Best slow cooker chili I'm had ever!! I didn't have any salsa so I substituted it with a jar of bruschetta and it was still fantastic! Great served on a bed of steamed basmati rice. I also didn't have pinto beans so I used red kidney beans and it was still very good.

Super recipe. Will probably be my staple for easy-to-make chili for a long time.  Followed the recipe almost exactly.  Used regular frozen whole kernel corn rather than canned Mexican style. My choice for salsa was a store brand Southwest style with some corn and black beans in it, great blend of spices, too. Also, for the pinto beans, I used Bush's chili beans.  With chopped onion and shredded cheese toppings, and a healthy sized square of buttered corn bread, you're in for a real treat. Try it, you'll like it.

This recipe was awesome with a little tweaking! (I can never "just follow" a recipe! lol) I did everything this recipe called for, plus I added green chilis, black beans, and chili stewed tomatoes. I also drained all the can goods. I turned the slow cooker off about 30-40 mins. before I served it, so the chili could thicken. We ate this over fritos and dolloped with cheese and sour cream. It was fantastic and my husband just loved it! He asked me to make it for our next supper club dinner! Definitely a keeper! :-)

My husband and I thought this was delicious. We added tomoato juice to make it not so dry. It was only dry though because I think our crock pot is so new or maybe just really hot.

There is hope for even us last minute cooks!   I threw all the ingredients in the crock pot on High (chicken cut in quarters) at 4 pm.  At 6, I fork shredded it. At 7 I rolled the mixture into flour tortillas and up into a 9x13 pan, topped with cheese...baked for 30 min. Dinner on the table shortly after 7:30! It was AMAZING! really delish!

This was yummy! I did use black beans and a can of green chilies. I also just threw everything in the crockpot. Cooked on high for 4 hours and it was fantastic and super easy, couldn't ask for anything more.

This turned out way better than I expected! This was my first try at a non-beef chili, and I was apprehensive, but it turned out great. Since I am not a fan of peppers, I added regular corn instead of mexican, and used about a jar and a half of salsa instead of just one. Also, not having read the recipe too closely ahead of time and finding myself out of time, I dumped everything in the crockpot at once that morning and ignored the "4 hours before, add..." thing, and it came out just fine. Will make again!

The flavor is great but the "chili" concept is hard to understand because there is not much liquid in it.  I read some reviews; but many of them don't talk about what they added to actually make it chili.  1 cup of salsa does not make enough liquid for 8 servings of chili. I have made it twice and served in on brown rice both times.  It is very good but would prefer more liquid.  Maybe next time I will add some tomatoes and some chicken broth. Any other ideas?

This recipe deserves a 2.5 stars. It's hard to believe I'm reviewing the same recipe that has gotten such stellar ratings because this recipe was mediocre at best. Maybe I did something wrong? I made a few alterations to the recipe but nothing too crazy. First of all, I slow cooked the chicken with all the spices including minced fresh garlic instead of garlic powder(4 breasts) with one jar of salsa on its own and shared the same experience as a few of the other reviewers in my crock pot burning up on the sides. Took awhile to scrape my pot clean too! The chicken was kind of on the charred side after that! I was able to salvage the majority of the meat though, discarding the crispy edges. Then I added the pinto beans (3 cans), diced chiles (1 can), an extra jar of salsa, and a can of enchilada sauce and let it simmer on high for 2 hours. The result was "chili" that tasted like Hormel, straight out of the can but who was I fooling? The majority of the ingredients WERE out of a can, I just expected it to taste more homemade since it took FOREVER to cook. I'm NEVER making this recipe again. If I want a good chili I'll make the "Fantastic Black Bean Chili" that is also on this site and is as "fantastic" as its name implies. Glad some of you enjoyed this recipe though!

this was ok for me, maybe because i didnt use salsa.  I used rotel.  I just thought it was lacking.  I used 2 large 
chicken breast cut in to small cubes.  1 can of pinto, 1 can of black beans.  I added 1/2 yellow onion chopped.  I added some tomato sauce and water.  I also added chili powder, garlic powder, oregano, and cumin.  At the end i added some masa harina.  We enjoyed it for the football game, but I dont think it made a big enough impression on us to repeat this recipe.

Awesome chili recipe. I thought this sounded pretty good, but it really surprised me! I only made minor alterations... I only used 2 chicken breasts, 20 oz of salsa, and added a can of great northern beans along with the pintos. I used a cheap salsa from Aldis and it was still phenominal. I just threw everything together in the slow cooker and set it on high for 5 hours. Then I took the chicken out, shredded it, and stuck it back in. Set it to low and let it simmer for 3 more hours. Served with sour cream and shredded cheese. Absolutely delicious!

As soon as my husband took his first bite he started swooning....he loved it! We did not start it the night before.  We added everything in the a.m. and set  for 8 hours on low although it was on warm for an additional hour prior to eating. We followed the recipe except we added a can of black beans in addition to the pinto beans, extra corn, two chopped garlic cloves instead of garlic powder, small can of chopped green chiles and a 15 oz can of fire roasted diced tomatoes in addition to the jar of salsa since alot of reviews said their recipe turned out dry.  We also added a little extra chile powder to our preference. The chicken breasts were added whole (about 1.5 pounds) and shredded the last half hour of cooking.  It was plenty juicy enough as we did not drain any of the canned ingredients.  Served with chopped advocado on top along with shredded 2% sharp cheddar and a dolop of low fat sour cream.  Served with corn bread on the side. Cannot wait to have again, it was amazing.

I thought this was ready good and fairly easy to put together.  I cooked the chicken in the crockpot on high for an hour and a half and then on low for a couple hours.  I added 1/2 cup of chicken broth to the chicken/salsa mix as well as two TBS. of minced garlic.  I doubled the corn, used 1 can each of black and pinto beans and put in a can of diced tomatoes.  It was great served with shredded cheese and sour cream on top.

I love this recipe.  I don't cook the chicken overnight though.  I just start it the morning we want it for dinner.  I've made it several times but liked it the most with an extra can of mexicorn and a can of rotel.  I also add about half a cup of water to the salsa/chicken.

I didn't do the night before thing.  I just dumped everything in my crock pot.  I cooked it on high for 3 hrs, shredded the chicken and then cooked it on low for another 3. I used black beans like some others suggested -- really good.  I also added a can of rotel.  I will definitely be making this again.

MMM! This was delicious and so easy.  I served it with shredded cheese and sour cream and some homemade flour tortillas.  My husband loved it and he hates chicken.  I can't wait to make it when it gets cold, it is a good snowy day recipe.  Oh and the wonderful smell...mmm.  I didn't have any problem with lack of liquid, I think it depends on the kind of salsa you use.  I did only cook it for 7 hours total.  Next time I think I might garnish it with a bit of cilantro too.

I also didn't follow the advice of leaving the chicken in the slow cooker overnight.  I am sure that it would have dried it out.  I just dumped everything in with a whole can of chicken broth and let it sit for about four hours.  Then, at the last minute I added a can of corn and it turned out awesome!  This was the best chili recipe I've ever tried.  I'll definitely keep this one!  Thanx lots!

This recipe looked like it was going to be so good.  I followed the directions exactly.  I put my salsa and chicken in the crock pot after dinner (about 9:00).  About 3 a.m. I awoke to a burning smell!  I don't know if the author of the recipe left out adding extra water or if my crockpot is particularly hot natured (on the low setting as directed), but there was a burnt black mess in my crock pot!  If I make this again - I will definately add extra water - or maybe start it a little closer to dinner time!

Delicious! Just made this tonight. I followed some the other reviews and added: tomatoes, kidney beans (instead of pinto) and fresh garlic. We ate in in tortillas with fresh tomato, onion, and grated cheese. Very good and filling.
I cooked it the same day in the crock pot, it was done around 6-7 hours on low.

Amazing!!  Following other reviewers, I added one can of enchilada sauce, I used 1 small bag of frozen corn insted of canned corn, and instead of pinto beans, I used one can of kidney and one canof black beans.  My family LOVES this recipe.  So easy and so delicious.  A lot of chicken, though - which makes it a hearter dinner.

This recipes is fabulous.  Have made it half a dozen times and it always hits the spot...filling and full of flavor.  I also add a 15 oz can of tomato sauce, use frozen corn, chili beans instead of the plain pinto ones, and fresh chopped garlic (can buy it in little jars if you don't want to chop it yourself).  Don't forget flour tortillas and grated cheese for an extra hearty meal.  Yummy!

This was a good chili and a FABULOUS chip dip.  I did add quite a bit more spice, as well as black beans and a little water.  Served with sour cream and shredded cheese, my husband and I couldn't get enough!

Loved it. Made it Super Bowl Sunday. Used black beans instead of pinto and bone-in breasts. Really good. We also topped it off with some cheddar and sour cream.

LOVE it.  I kept the recipe as is, other than adjusting the cook time for the chicken.  6-8 hours would have been too long.  It doesn't have a lot of liquid, but it is VERY tasty.  I will definitely make this again.

I subbed 2 cans diced tomatoes, 2 cans green chiles for the salsa, and added 2 sliced carrots, some chopped elephant ear garlic, a lot more cumin than the recipe called for, and some cayenne.  Also used 2 cans black beans instead of pinto.  Turned out delicious and very thick and hearty!

So of course I made some edits..I used one can of black beans, one can of pinto beans, one can of diced tomatoes, and only two chicken breasts and this turned out great.  I wouldn't really call it chili but it is a yummy main dish served over rice! Will definitely make again.

This is the Chicken Chili recipe I've been looking for! I used two cups of leftover cooked chicken that I made in the crockpot earlier this week as well as homemade beans opposed to canned as that's what I had. I added a can of diced tomatos with chilis (undrained) and used regular canned corn, though chopped up some fresh chilis to add some more heat. Aside from that I tossed everything into my slow cooker at once and let it go for the full 8 hours. The result was a delicious hot meal that looked visually appealing with all of its color too boot! I will make again and again!

This is absolutely fabulous and easy! This was the very first slow cooker meal that I ever made, and now my husband and I are so excited about finding more recipes. I can believe how the chicken just fell apart. I did use fresh garlic as suggested by others, and also added a little more some cumin and chili powder and a can of chili beans. Thanks, Sarah Jane, for this great recipe!

This is a great recipe! Definitely comes out thicker than the picture makes it seem... but still extremely delicious and versatile!  You can make it as spicy or as mild as you want, and it's great with cornbread... and great leftover!

This was a great recipe for a cold day, and the only suggestion I would make it that it would be great with baked tortilla strips in it, and I recommend not draining the can of corn to add more liquid.  Very flavorful and without adding tortilla strips, it is a great low carb meal.

I just made this today and oh man! so good!,I didn't think there was enough juice in it either because I really wanted it for leftovers after church tommorow so I added some chicken broth and veggie broth,it really added some spark to it and the mexican style corn I added to it,had chipolte peppers in it so...at first I was like 'Okay' then in the middle of the bowl,the heat likes builds up on you. Wow! this is a great dish!

We loved this Chili, I used both Black and Pinto beans. Toped it with some fresh cilantro and diced up avacados and a little sour cream. Very tast and different than the regular chicken chili I make in the crock pot.

This (as a base recipe) was amazing! I added black beans, fresh tomatoes, fresh garlic, green pepper, a can of green chili peppers, and a larger amount of said spices, but wow! We ate some as chili, some in tortillas, and some as a dip with tortilla chips, but in all variations it was great! Will definitely be using this again!

I've made this twice, both with delicious results.  Once I made it in the crockpot in only 4 hours....still great!  I've used frozen corn instead of fresh...still great!  I've used black beans instead of pinto...still great!  I chunked the chicken at the beginning and, you guessed it..still great!

This chicken recipe is not a chili, or soup, or stew. It just makes a mountain of shredded chicken. Now the recipe gets four stars because it is really good chicken, just not a chili. I would make this again and use it as a filling for enchiladas or something similar.

This was delicious. I added black beans and used a smaller can of corn, and used two chicken breasts instead of four, but it was very good, I will definitely be using this again. Also, I only cooked the chicken on low for 4 or 5 hours before it was ready to shred, and then I put the rest of the ingredients in for 2 hours and it turned out great.

Great low-fat recipe. I followed recipe as stated and added a 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes and green chilies to juice it up a bit as it looked dry.

Love this recipe!  I've made it twice, and each time I freeze half of the batch to use later.  I omit the corn and use one can pinto beans (drained) and one can black beans (with their juice).  I also add 1/4 t. cayenne pepper to add some spice and used 3 cloves chopped fresh garlic instead of the powder.  I think next time around I might add a touch more cumin, also. Would be really thick to eat as a chili, so we served it with all the fixings for tacos/burritos. Yummy!

I made this again last night because my husband requested it (which is RARE in my house). I didn't have any chicken breasts so I used 8 chicken tenders. I cooked the first part on high for 3.5 hours. After shredding the chicken, I added the corn (regular because I didn't have mexican corn) and the beans (2 cans of pinto beans), and turned the slow cooker on low for 3 hours or whenever we decided to eat dinner. I did omit the salt as we like to scoop up the chili with tortilla chips. It is perfect. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this. Thanks.

I love this recipe! I've made it a bunch of times now and my husband thinks it makes the whole apartment smell lovely! The only change I make is using canned "chili ready" tomatos bc they're way cheaper than salsa and I like the taste better.

After reading the review of others, I made a few changes: used 3 large chicken breasts instead of 4, black beans instead of pinto (personal preference) and then added a can of diced tomatoes with chilis. Be sure to rinse and drain the beans before adding to cut down on the sugar. Served with fresh cilantro, sour cream and shredded mexican blend cheese. It was very good.

Really good and really, really easy!  I used fresh salsa and only used 3 chicken breasts--as a few mentioned 4 would of been too many.  If you use 4, you really need to increase the corn and/or beans or salsa.  We enjoyed it, but, it was a strange consistancy---kind of between a chili & dip for tortilla chips.  Still, will make again just need to add more liquid.

Wonderful!! Made it a budget meal by adding just one chicken breast, and it was wonderful. Omitted salt and also used home-made beans and frozen corn to drop the salt content (which is already considerable from the salsa).

Great stuff.  I don't keep Mexican-style corn around, so used frozen and then just added some more "Mexican-style stuff."  It might be my slow-cooker, but leaving something on low all night is too much, so I turned it to warm for the night and then turned it up to low when I started adding other ingredients.  What a great way to cook chicken!  (I think I've only ever cooked already-chopped chicken in the crock pot, which admittedly, I've not used too often to begin with.)  I really hate shredding chicken, but this just fell apart when cooked this way.  Took away much drudgery!  Sprinkled some cheddar on top, but wished I'd had some sour cream around.  One poster put it on rice, and that sounds like a great idea.

This is such a great dish for a chilly night!  I love making it because it's so easy (I have the recipe memorized now), and easily adjusted to fit your own taste.  I substitute frozen corn for canned, sometimes use black or kidney beans rather than pinto, and usually add more spices (I love garlic and heat!).  Such a classic recipe, I will probably never grow tired of it!

My boyfriend and I loved this recipe... it was so easy, too!  I substituted the pinto beans for black beans and added some extra rotel because I thought it was getting a little dry (however, this was probably a bad idea b/c it ended up being a tad bit soupy after the beans and rotel were done simmering)... but it was delicious served over tortilla chips and topped with cheese!  My boyfriend couldn't get enough!

Yummy! I followed the recipe very closely and this "chili" turned out beautifully! I didn't cook it over night as the recipe suggests, but opted to defrost the chicken and cook it on high for 4 hours and then low for the remainder of the day. I started it at 10am and it was done by 5pm. I used Newman's Own Thick and Chunky Natural Salsa. I drained the cans of beans and corn so that it wasn't too soupy and I am really glad I did that. We served the shredded chicken on tortillas with cheddar cheese and sour cream. It was sooo good! It had a lot of flavor, but was not spicy. If you want it to be super spicy, just choose your salsa wisely and add a little more spices when you cook it. This recipe could easily be adjusted to suit anyone's taste buds. My family (including my two year old) loved it as is! THANK YOU so much for sharing!

UPDATE: I have made this 3 times already! I love it! Thank you so much for this recipe; I can't get enough of it!

I make a double batch of this about once a month.  It's fantastic.

But try this:  mix this with some warm refried beans and use it as a dip for chips.  Awesome.

My husband and I just had this for dinner tonight and it was delish!  Mexican is my favorite food, and since I've been on a diet I haven't been able to eat much of it at all.  This recipe let me indulge in my fave food without feeling guilty, and my husband (who is really tired of blah grilled chicken) loved this!  I used 5 chicken breasts, 3 cans rotel (mexican & original)instead of salsa, 2 cans mexican corn, 2 cans black beans and fresh cilantro.  I didn't drain the rotel or corn and there was plenty of juice to cook the chicken. I used ALOT more of the spices than the recipe called for and added some freshly chopped garlic.  I took advice of others and piled it in a low fat/low carb tortilla with reduced fat cheese and scooped up the rest with healthy blue corn tortilla chips.  AWESOME!

Very good, but I changed a bit - Pressure cook chicken with 2/3 of a large sweet onion, 2c.chicken stock, cumin, chili powder and 4 cloves of garlic for 20 min.  Shred chicken, add beans, 24 oz. black bean and corn salsa, extra cumin and cilantro.  Simmer 10 min.  Serve with sour cream, green onion and sprinkle of cheese. Delish!!!

This is so easy and quick and it is truly delicious!!!
Instead of cooking it in the slow cooker/crock, I cooked it in just 20 minutes using a pressure cooker.

Make this, take it to a potluck, and just wait for the compliments to roll in! :-)
I didn't have cumin, so I left it out. I used a half a pouch of chicken taco powder (Old El Paso makes it) instead of the chili powder, as well as a can of black beans, white kidney beans, and two cans of corn niblets. I added a can of diced tomatoes (thanks to the reviewers' comments), as well as an entire carton of low sodium chicken broth. It really filled up the slow cooker, which made it hard to transport, but it was worth the little spill in my car! We served it with grated cheese, sour cream, and jalapeños on the side for those who wanted to jazz it up even more.
Definitely a keeper! Thanks!

It was okay.  The kids didn't like it at all, and I thought it was just okay.  I followed the recipe exactly until I tasted it and decided to add more chili powder and cumin.  It was definitely more like a filling for a burrito than a chili...it had very little sauce.  We served it over rice.  My husband said it was good over rice, and just okay otherwise.  I probably won't make it again.

Pretty dry.  I followed the directions almost exactly.  The only thing I did different was start it in the morning.  Maybe next time I will use a salsa that isn't as chunky and maybe one that is more soupy. My family loved it and I will add it to my recipes.

Because I had huge breasts(!) I only used 2 and it was plenty of chicken. Actually I added a can of black beans also because there were not enough beans in it. Otherwise I made it exactly and we loved it!

I tried to stay as close to the receipe as possible.  I could'nt find mexican corn so I used regular.  The flavor and consistancy was perfect.  We served it with chunks of avocado, sour cream, cheader cheese and tortillia chips.
I put my chicken, salsa mixture in at 9:45am on high for 2 hours then turned it down to low until 2 hours before I was going to serve it.  I then used two forks and mashed the breasts.  They were so tender they shredded themselves.  30 Minutes before serving I added the corn and beans.  I will be making this again.

This recipe is great!
I was a little short on time, so I sped it up a little by simmering the chicken for about 30 min in a large stock pot with about 1/2 a cup of water, then added the salsa and letting it simmer for another hour.
I then, removed the chicken and pulled it apart;then, I returned the chicken to the pot and added the remaining ingredients.
It still came out fantastic. I can't wait to actually use a crock pot and make it according the the recipe.
This was a real hit!!!!!

Very easy, and tasty, but the cooking time needs to be adjusted. After cooking  overnight and again the next day, everything ended up mushy - especially the chicken.  A few hours on high would probably suffice.

Pretty good. At first I wasn't loving it too much but with every bite it grew on me. Topped it with shredded cheddar cheese. Now I can't wait to have it for lunch tommorow.

WONDERFUL!!  I roasted the chicken thighs the night before to speed up the process.  Everything went into the crock pot at the same time and let it cook on low for the entire day. I did add diced green chiles for a little more zip. I also added leftover enchilada sauce because it was on hand.  What a differenc. This is definitely a keeper.

This recipe was excellent. My husband loved it! I used a teaspoon of minced garlic on top of the garlic powder because we love garlic and I just used non name brand chunky salsa. I was surprised on how delicious this was. I threw everything in the pot for quickness and 6-8 hours later.. YUM!! Of course I did add a little bit more cumin and chili powder. But its all up to you on taste. :o)

This was my first experience with a crock pot.  I am a newlywed, and my husband and I had some friends over a couple weekends ago and I made this for everyone.  I was a little nervous since I had never used a crock pot before, but it turned out really good! Everyone had seconds!!  I did add another can of tomatoes and only used black beans.  We will definitely be having this again soon!

This was good and very easy to make.  I used some leftover "taco chicken" meat that I make in my crockpot (chicken, taco seasoning & chicken broth) and finished the recipe as listed.  Only other thing I did was add a can of black beans and a can of Rotel.  Only thing I will do differentlty next time is use frozen corn since I don't like the taste of canned corn.  Okay, I guess I have completely changed the recipe!  I do it to a lot of soups and chilis.  This is a great starting point for me.  Thanks for your recipe!

Excellent full flavored dish. Not too spicy yet has plenty of zest. I followed some of the suggestions by adding 2 cans of black beans in lieu of the pinto, used fresh garlic and added 1 can of stewed tomatoes in addition to the 16 oz of homemade salsa. Definitely a keeper.

Yum!  My hubby loved this recipe--said he'd eat it morning, noon and night.  Also gave to an 80-something friend, who gobbled it up.  The reviews were helpful - I used diced tomatoes and chicken broth to help with the lack of moisture issue.  Super easy!  Definitely a keeper.  You might have chicken-cooking dreams if your slow cooker doesn't vent well overnight.  :)

Absolutely fabulous!  I made the chili as directed (use HOT salsa, though) and made available (brown) rice, chopped onion and shredded cheese as "toppings."  I also warmed tortillas; most of my company ended up using the tortillas as "pockets" to put the chili into.  Absolutely WONDERFUL!

Once again, I love AllRecipes.com for saving my skin: type in "chicken" and "salsa" in ingredient search, use the 'soup' category, and shazam!  Here's this recipe.  And you can't beat it for simplicity!  Based on other reviews I used a taco seasoning packet (actually, a recipe for one off this website) and a can of tomatoes.  It was very thick once the chicken was shredded (EASY after those 8 hours!) and the corn/beans were added.  I needed a soup insead of the thick stew since I was feeding a crowd, so I added a qt. of chicken stock (the organic range chicken kind from Cosco).  I think it would have tasted better to meld the tastes longer with the stock before eating, as both my husband and I thought it was just "ok", but I wouldn't say anything was "missing", there was definitely good flavor that was waiting to come out.  However, everyone else loved it.  So I'll definitely do it again, and would like to make it as written to use it in tortilla shells.  This recipe makes my list of ones to keep!

This was very easy and quite good.  I don't have the time/patience for starting cooking the night before and all into the next day.  So I turned the slow cooker to high for about 3 hours before shredding, then cooked it on low another 2 hours.  I would highly recommend adding a little broth - about 1/2 cup - to keep it from being too dry.  I also highly recommend sour cream and FRESH cilantro to made it extra yummy.  Don't use dry cilantro flakes, it just doesn't do the job.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  I added 1 large container of chicken stock/broth to the chili so there was more liquid for it to cook in.  I also precooked the chicken and shredded it beforehand.  It was wonderful and all my coworkers want the recipe since I took my leftovers into work!

This makes a great chicken soup too with the addition of a can of chicken broth!  In lieu of the canned corn I add a bag frozen corn and chopped & sauteed onion & red bell pepper.  This dish is a family favorite.

This is one of the first recipes I made with my slow cooker and I keep coming back to it.  It's so easy and everyone loves it.  I add a couple diced up serrano or jabanero peppers to when the chicken cooks to add some spice.  I also usually add red and yellow peppers when I add the beans and corn.  This gives me a really thick chili that goes great with crushed-up tortilla chips and a dollop of sour cream on top.

A great, versatile recipe!  I used fresh salsa and black beans - it was very thick, so we used it as a taco filling with corn tortillas and cilantro.  Will defenitely make again!

This has a wonderful taste but I have a question. After I added the beans and the corn it turned really watery. Any ideas why?

I followed the recipe and added 1 can diced tomatoes and 1 can diced green chilis.  I didn't drain any of the canned foods before adding to the pot.  Mine cooked in half the time (I have a large crock pot).  Consistency was great!  My husband and I loved this.  Made one night with homemade tortillas and the following night with fresh cornbread muffins.  Soooo Gooood!! Makes alot, and very filling.

This has a lot of flavor, but, chicken overload! I would use only two breasts next time and two-three cans of beans next time. Also, didnt have a lot of time, so I cooked chicken on high for an hour, then cooked for on low for 3 hours. The chicken fell apart, so I knew it was ready. Also, upon other reviews, I added a can of broth and a few more ounces of salsa, so it turned into a true 'chili'. Overall, a very tasty chili, beats the ground beef kind any day.

Very good taste, though not as much liquid as I would like. I exchanged pinto beans for kidney and blank beans and added extra corn as well a can of tomatoes. I would probably add some chicken broth or tomato sauce next time to make it more of a soup/stew.

My husband's friends hosted a chili contest and it won!  Very fun! I used an extra chicken breast and added some more salsa, as well as a can of diced tomatoes and a can of chiles. I also added a can of chicken broth and chili powder, cumin and some cayenne pepper. And fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder.  It was excellent!

Good but not as the recipe stands. By supper time (on the second day)and I added the required ingrediants it had the consistency of a casserole rather than a soup or chili.  Therefore, I added 1 15oz can tomato sauce and a can of chili beans.  Much better! Sprinkled cheese and a dollop of sour cream over each bowl.  Tasty.

Super easy and surprisingly delicious! May swap to black beans next time, but the pinto were good. Only used 3 chicken breasts, about 1.4 lbs total. Topped with cheese, sour cream and tortilla strips. Teenager and hubby enjoyed this dish too

Cooked on stove.  Boiled 6 chicken thighs in 3 cups of water and the spices.  After about 20 minutes, added the jar of salsa, 2 cans of black beans, 1 can of white kidney beans, the corn and 7 oz diced chilis.  After about 15 minutes more, took the chicken out and shredded and then put back in.  Pretty awesome!

I made this again and had no black beans or corn mix so I used two cans of green beans and it was very good!

A nice solid chili, I used black beans instead of pintos like many others. Mine was a bit more soupy then thick, but I still enjoyed it. I also realized after the fact I had my slow cooker on a lower heating setting then I should have.

I thought this was a bit boring and a little too sweet for my taste.  I'd prefer a thicker sauce and more of it.  I left out the cumin because I'm not a fan.  Perhaps the folks who liked it put in lots of spice to make up for the lack of flavor?  I definitely would suggest adding another can of beans, but I won't be making it again.

First of all, this recipe looks nothing like the chili in the main photo, but that's ok, because it was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, with 1 tsp of pepper and 2 tsp of salt. I will definitely make this one again, and next time I will double the recipe so I can freeze some. It only served about 4.

I used two cans of black beans instead. Added one can of chopped green chilies. Will decrease chicken to three breasts next time.

Excellent recipe! I followed another reviewers suggestion and just put all the ingredients in at the same time. It was so good! Next time I'll probably do one less chicken breast and an extra can of beans.

This was great and my family raved about it! I made a few changes. I used 3 cloves of garlic instead of garlic powder, I added about 2 tablespoons of chopped white onion. I had no pinto beans so I used 1 can of black beans and 1 can of garbonzo beans. I added a can of tomatoes and used all the spices it calls for plus cayenne pepper for more kick. I had no corn on hand but it was not noticed. The wonderful thing is the chicken basically shreds by itself once in the crock pot for  6-8 hours so that step was skipped.It was great because I used it as soup but my family put it in a tortilla for chicken burritoes and topped it with sour cream, lettuce, and salsa. WONDERFUL recipe. Thank you for sharing!

The flavors were nice and I love that it was simple with non-processed ingredients but as written it was a thick filling and not like any chili I've had.  In order to try and remedy this I added a 15 oz can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilis and 32 oz chicken broth.  I let it sit overnight to blend the flavors and it was good.  Still had some zing to it (I had used a jar of Frontera Grill salsa) but kind of felt like Tortilla soup without the tortillas.

Such a simple recipe for the busy cook!  I only used one large chicken breast and it was plenty.  I also used black beans instead of pinto.  I will be cooking this one again.

I make this all the time but I realized I might have been reading the recipe wrong because the chicken is usually over cooked and the overall recipe is a bit dry. This time I added some Chicken broth after I shredded the chicken and that helped. I usually cook it for 6 hours then shred it and cook another 3. Next time I will cook it for 4 or 5 hours, then shred it and continue cooking another 3.  I also, like many others add black beans to this.  I serve it with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream and sometimes Triscuits.  Great recipe and super easy to make

GREAT GREAT recipe for a cold day or just when you are feeling a different style of chili!!  I followed the recipe exactly but instead I used kidney beans (I think you can add whatever you want and it will still taste great).  Can't wait to make it again!

Similar in flavor to Slow Cooker Taco Soup, but simpler. A little on the thick side but quick to put together. Threw in everything together and put on low for 8 hours.

Added 8 more oz of mild salsa, 1/2 can of hot green chilis, 1/2 Onion, substituted rinsed black beans for the pinto and it was really good.  Garnished with cheddar cheese and sour cream.  Will make again.

Yummy chili, I'll be making it again. For my tastes I added water to thin the chili, about a salsa jar and a half. Many people prefer their chili thick like the recipe, if that bothers you just add water rather than complain about it in a review. I also add everything to the pot in the beginning and it turns out fine. Thanks very much for sharing.

Amazingly delicious, healthy and easy! I usually double this recipe in my slow cooker. I've also cooked it on high for less time in a pinch. I like to add extra kidney beans and corn. I serve with cheese, sour cream, guacamole and tortilla chips. This is my go to for larger groups or if I'm making a meal for someone else. Everyone LOVES this! It heats up well, too! I've never had leftovers enough to freeze, but I imagine it would freeze well, too!

Very tasty. I did not change the ingredients. However, I did change the prep. I set my crock pot for 6 hours. Cubed chicken & cooked for 3 hours w/ spices & a fresh, chunky salsa. Then added beans (drained) & corn (not drained); cooked for 3 additional hours. The flavor was great. Served w/ sour cream, shredded cheddar, & tortilla chips. Next time, though, I will drain the corn because my chili was a little more like a chunky soup, and I like a thicker chili. I will also try using fresh garlic and adding some cayenne & green chili peppers as I do prefer a little more spice to my chili.

Delicious recipe! It has wonderful chili flavors and a touch of sweetness. Super easy because there's no chopping involved, just threw everything in the crockpot and set it on low for 8 hrs. 

Instead of pinto beans, I added a can of black beans and a half can of great northern beans drained. As others have suggested, i added a can of Rotel original diced tomatoes with green chillies. Halved the cumin because my Pace chunky picante sauce was already medium spice, didn't want it overly spicy. Added 3/4 cup chicken broth for more liquid. Turned out a perfect consistency (other reviewers have noted it comes out thick). Oh and just 3 chicken breasts were plenty.

Made this Recipe for a Pot luck event...It was a total hit!  All I did was use a Medium hot Salsa, and I doubled all the ingredients.I also used Black Beans instead of Pinto (personal preference) It turned out fabulous!  I was disappointed...not a drop of leftovers :)

Loved this! Added the green chilis, used pineapple salsa and black beans (not the pinto), and did the frozen corn as mentioned in a few reviews.  Added some rice towards the end - and WOW!!!  Absolutely delicious.  Total keeper.

This is a great recipe, we love the flavors, however it is not the chili I was thinking of. Needs more liquid... I have added more salsa, which is good, but we use this for everything from Quesadilla filling to enchilada filling: roll in tortillas, place in baking pan, cover with Mole sauce and shredded cheese of choice.. Delicious!

I received a crock pot for Christmas. This was the first recipe I tried, and it turned out delicious! As some other reviewers mentioned, I just put all the ingredients in the crock pot and cooked on low for 8 hours. This chili was tasty with corn tortillas. Thanks for the great recipe!

Yummy! And so simple! I also just put it all in together and cooked for 8 hours on low, I used crushed garlic instead of garlic powder (about 1.5 tsp) if you are sensitive to spicey foods I would go easy on the chilli powder. I'd love to try it with a little sour cream!

Our new favorite meal!!  I add a can of Ro-Tel and use frozen corn and just use 2 chicken breasts.  I just throw everything in the crock pot and cook for about 6 hours on low.  I shred the chicken about 30 mins. before I want to get it out.

This was a fantastic quick crock pot recipe!  The only thing I added was a can of black beans because we like those as well.  It was good and spicy (due to hot salsa I used) just the way we like it.

I just made this for the first time and love it!  Great recipe and easy to follow.  In order to avoid the watery soup that I see others posting about, I would drain the beans and corn and just add a little bit of the bean juice for flavor.  With this, my chili came out very hearty!  Also, I used Newmann's Own Natural Chunky mild salsa and added extra Chili powder to boost the flavor.  Couldn't ask for an easier and more flavorful chicken and corn chili.

Did not add the beans and cut the salsa so I could just eat the chicken. Put it in some tortillas with a little beans and cheese and then baked. Presto chicken flautas! Yum yum :)

Made this two nights ago and it was a big hit, I added only 3 chicken breasts and did NOT use a slow cooker. This will be made again and again - thank you.

UPDATE: MADE THIS TODAY, BUT THIS TIME I ADDED A 15 OZ. CAN OF ROTEL (I KEPT EVERYTHING ELSE THE SAME). GARNISHED BOWLFULS WITH SHREDDED CHEESE, SOUR CREAM AND SCALLIONS. YUM-O! Not bad. While I don't feel this should be classified as "chili," I enjoyed my bowl of "soup" very much. :) This is a basic, foolproof recipe that lends itself well to personal adaptation. I pretty much followed Sara's directions to the letter, but would recommend making a few (minor) changes next time around. As another reviewer mentioned, I too was confused as to whether or not to drain my corn / beans. I didn't and feel this may be the reason my chili was "soupy." Because I could only find a 15 oz. can of Mexicorn, I used that instead of the 11 oz. can called for. I also accidentally picked up seasoned" pinto beans. Since I decided to make this spur of the moment (there is NO need to cook overnight), I just threw 4 frozen chicken breasts in my slow cooker and proceeded as directed (which worked well!). Based on my experience with this recipe, here's what I recommend: a) decrease the amount of chicken (3 breasts is MORE than enough) and b) add diced tomatoes to give this a thick, chili-like consistency. Served with a sprinkling of Monterey-Jack cheese and blue corn chips on the side, this was a decent, no-fuss meal. Of course, my fiance didn't think so (he's not a fan of beans), but he wasn't supposed to be home for dinner tonight anyways lol. :) Thanks for sharing, Ms. Jane!

This was the perfect meal for a rainy, dreary night.  The smell in the house while this was cooking away was so yummy!  I added a can of green chili's and used chili beans instead of pinto beans.  I also added about 1/2 cup of chicken stock based on other reviewers' suggestions.  Served with crushed tortilla chips, sour cream, and shredded cheddar cheese.  It could have used a bit more "spice" so I'll use HOT salsa next time instead of medium.  Very hearty, very delicious.

placed chicken and salsa in slow cooker on low before work.  when i got home,it was semi-burnt.  Chicken was tender but salsa was all crunchy.  Made anyway but wasn't good-maybe it would taste better if not overcooked

I added 1 can diced green chili, 2 cans chili beans and 3 1/2 tsp chili powder. I left out the salsa because the consistency seemed thin. After I shredded the chicken it was perfect. Delicious will make again. ;)

Will use homemade salsa in the future--jarred salsa was a little soupy.  Otherwise, sooo good!!!!  Added a can of diced tomatoes w/jalapenos and two cans of chopped chiles.  MMMMM.

Very good as is, but with some changes its a 5! We cooked it on the camp fire in cast iron which added to a great taste. So, we didn't cook the chicken then shred it. I just cubed the chicken.  Instead of canned salsa I used fresh home-made salsa (tomato, green pepper, onion, cilantro, and a touch of hot sauce) plus a small can of tomato juice. I also used black beans and frozen corn, instead of canned corn.

We did not like this as written.  After we doctored it up with a couple quarts of canned tomatoes and a whole lot more chili powder it turned out a lot better.

This does not have the consitancy of chili.  It has a good flavor.  I served it over frito chips with shredded cheddar cheese on top.  It is not a recipe that I will be making again any time soon, but was okay.

I definitely will not be making this again.  It was a big pot of very bland and dry chicken that wasn't even good enough to make burritos out of.  I did not make any changes to the recipe!

It was a very good recipe, very simple. The cumin and chili powder really fill the house with a wonderful smell as it cooks (I always made chili with william's chili seasoning), and the taste is very savory. Topped it with shredded cheddar, green onions, and sour cream, served with tortilla chips. Will definitely keep this in our monthly rotation!

Great healthy recipe!  So easy which is a huge plus with little ones!  Like some of the others I put it all in the crockpot at the same time and cooked on low for about 8 hrs.  Next time I make it think I'll drain the black beans (I substituted for pinto) to make it thicker and use it in tortillas.

I put the chicken (only used two breasts) into the crockpot when I got up in the morning...no need to cook overnight if you are having for dinner...6 hours is plenty. This was SO easy and quite yummy! I will make it again. I think I'd like to try black beans as suggested...sounds great!

This was a great base recipe. I did make changes, because I always change recipes to suit my tastes. I used boneless/skinless chicken thighs and just simmered then in the salsa for a couple hours and i was able to pull them apart with just the spoon I was using to stir them every once in a while. I also used black beans instead of pinto, and I added the juice of one lime and fresh cilantro right before serving, and these additions made it really good. We served it with sour cream,and shredded cheddar cheese. With these changes. Yum!

I gave this 4 because I made a bunch of changes. Black beans instead of pinto, used 2 cans chicken instead of breasts, added 1 can diced tomatoes, fresh garlic and onion.  Delish! Making it again for Super Bowl Sunday.

I used 3 chicken breast instead of 4 because mine were big.  We put the mixture in burritos with cheese. This was very good although I'll add more spice to it next time.  BF and I had to add some tapatio for hotness.  I will definitely make this again!  :)

Great recipe, easy to put together.  I did cut up an onion and put it in when I put in the beans and corn.  I also opted to double the recipe as I had a 6 quart crock.  Otherwise, simple, easy, thanks!

Great chili. Very hearty and satisfying. Didn't give it five stars because I thought it was a little bland. Next time I'll add more spices. Found that it was actually tastier the next day. Overall, a very good basic chili recipe.

This went over well at the in-law's but I didn't think it was anything like chili.  I used shredded leftover turkey from thanksgiving and dumped everything in the slow cooker to sit until we were ready to eat.  Everyone seemed to like it but it was more like soup than chili.  I served cornbread and tortilla chips on the side and sour cream and shredded cheese for toppings.  Maybe I'll try it again using chicken breast and following the recipe more closely to see if it comes out more hearty and chili-like.

I love this!  I usually use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  I also add chicken broth and use black and great northern beans. I put it in tortillas with enchillada sauce on top and bake for a bit.  Wonderful!

I was short on time so I boiled the chicken breasts, shredded them, then simmered everything in a pan on the stove top. I made burritos with the chili and some rice, topped them with grated cheese, then baked them in the oven til the cheese was melty. Turned out great. Husband especially liked them.  Thanks!

Very simple and very filling. I love that it only has a few ingridents and has very low calories. it's hard to find low-cal items that are filling. This one is an A+

This was delicious!  A couple additions:  I added a can of diced tomatoes and used black beans instead of pinto.  Fabulous with sour cream and cheese as a topping with chips.

Very good. I used a can of stewed tomatoes as I didn't have salsa on hand and only two large Costco breasts. If you don't want to add the corn and beans - then use as a filling for tacos, enchiladas, burritos, etc. and have rice and beans on the side. It made a lot for my family of 3.

Ok. This recipe is by FAR the best one i've found yet on this website!! I use 2 jars of salsa instead of one, and 3 chicken breasts (4 seemed to be way too much, especially if your only using 1 jar of salsa) and i use canned black beans instead of pinto. Oh, and i dont even bother letting anything sit around in the fridge to marinade. I have found it tastes exactly the same if you cut that step completely. My husband and I eat this once every couple of weeks. NO LIE. we top it w/ sliced jalapenos, sour cream, shredded cheese, and green onion, and eat w/ corn chips! These are amazing as a base for a nachos instead of usual ground beef, and great as a burrito. Follow my steps, and i guarantee if you already love this recipe, you will now love it even more!

This is a good recipe that I made a little better by adding some sweet italian turkey sausage and almost twice as much corn. I also used salsa from a Mexican restaurant that makes it fresh every day. Wow, what a difference. Served over yellow rice and with a little garlic brad for dipping it was a hit. I'll make this one again and again!

I used only one chicken breast, but it was rather large (Tyson). Only had frozen corn on hand so substituted that for the canned. Came out very thick, less liquid-y than others' pictures suggest. Instead of the night before, I placed the chicken in my crock pot the morning of and shredded after 6 hours. Very tasty, similar to a beef chili but with a touch of Mexican flavor.

Didn't like it at all.  I used my favorite salsa to slow cook the chicken over night.  By early moring the salsa had burnt on the sides, because of the lack of moisture.  I added a can of chicken broth to give the meet something to cook in.  I also think it smelled kind of funny with the salsa cooking.  Anyway, I added the ingredients exactly as the recipe stated and it was lacking flavor.  So I think I ended up adding a good bit more chili powder (3 or 4 tbsp.), and cumin.  I also diced up a chipotle pepper.  This made it ok, I will definetely never make this recipe  again.

What I made was based loosely on this recipe, but came out DELICIOUS!  Here's what I did differently: used 1 1/4 lbs. chicken breasts, 24 oz. jar black bean & corn salsa, added 2 c. chicken broth, 1 tsp. bottled minced garlic, added 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes, 15 oz. can black beans (drained), added 15 oz. can dark red kidney beans (drained) & 1 1/2 c. frozen sweet corn (instead of canned mexicorn).  I cooked on high for about 4 1/2 hrs. total.  This is GREAT, a must try and will definitely make it into my regular rotation with the above changes.

Made this with hot salsa and the black beans.  I also added celery and green onions along with some crushed red pepper flakes for a little more zing.  It was very good and easy will absolutely make it again.

Good basic recipe but did some adjusting. First poured a bottle of good beer into the salsa and chicken mixture. Cooked on low for about 6 hours. In the morning I added a can of Mexican corn, Ranch style beans, black beans, two chicken bullion cubes, and additonal chili powder, cumin along with some onion salt.  Cooked on high for two hours - not thick at all like others said. Maybe the beer helped? Served with brown rice, non-fat sour cream and 2% cheese.  Will make again with my changes.

I thought this was good, though a little dry (thus 4 rather than 5 stars). I added a can of Rotel, and that helped.

While trying to decide what to make for dinner tomorrow night I asked my hubby for input, his reply "make another pot of the chicken chili and corn, it was great".  So, there you have it, no more taco soup or chili for us for a while, the chicken chili is now in regular rotation in our house.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe.  Try it with black beans, it's super too.

It seems like other people really enjoy this, not sure why I'm different but it's basically cooking the chicken in a jar of salsa. It was just OK, not as good as other chicken chilis listed on this site.

I want to say this was great and I loved it very much and really it is kind of healthy for you.  My mom adored it.  I did add some stuff.  I did add chicken broth to make it more soupy and black beans,but this is great and will defiantly make it again.

This recipe has 2 of my favorite things~fast and delicious!  Used pinto beans and black beans but no corn. I did not make this in the slow cooker~I made it on the stovetop..mmmm I'm going to try using the leftovers in enchiladas. I would say this recipe is pretty healthy too...not much fat, low in sodium and lots of fiber

So good you'd never know it was so easy! Be sure that you pick a good salsa to use. I usually have all the ingredients on hand since I usually have a bag of frozen chicken breasts so it's a good "go to" meal when I don't know what else to make.  Leftovers make great burritos or quesidillas.

My husband loved it enough to eat 3 nights in a row without complaint!  I added a whole vidalia onion, a red pepper, some shredded carrots, and used black beans.  We served it over brown rice with cheddar cheese on top.  Great!  Would be good served in a toasted tortilla "bowl".

I really liked this one.It was very simple to make. I put the chicken in, in the morning, had it cook all day. It was great.Would be good in a burrito or over some chips with melted cheese over.Thats how we ate the left overs. It tasted great! Great on a cold day. Will make again.

Very good! I had my doubts while it was cooking (I didn't do the chicken the night before) but this was super yummy. Even my picky husband liked it! Serve with some saltines and shredded cheese.

this was just ok.  it smelled a little funny.  i think it was the beans.  i may make it again using black beans.  also, the cooking time was WAY too much.  i cooked it about 8 hours and my chicken was already starting to dry out.  i added a can of spicey tomatoes w/ chilis and about a cup of chicken broth to keep it from drying out.

This was ok.  Very easy to make, however, it lacked something extraordinary.  I could definately tell it was from jars and cans.  I like a recipe that uses jars and cans, but tastes homemade... this wasn't it.

After reading other reviews, I added a chopped onion, chopped pepper, can of chicken broth and can of black beans to entire recipe.  I started it in the morning, cooked on low and it was ready by 5 for dinner.  Can be doubled for larger crock pots.  Will make it often, my family loved it!

My husband and I loved this recipe! I doctored it up a bit with a can of diced tomatoes, black beans, chopped onion, and jalapenos.  I threw it all in the crock pot before work, and when we got home it was ready to eat. Quick, easy, and very tasty!

Easy to make and VERY good. We added a bit of cheddar at the end, as we always do with our chili, but I'm sure it wasn't necessary. Thanks!

I have made this chili so many times, and always get good results. I think you can control how much spice with the salsa you choose, my favorite is to make it with a green salsa. I don't cook it overnight, I find it works best for my schedule to start the chicken in the morning, shred after 6 hours on low, eat after 3-4 more hours.

I have had to doctor this up a fair amount.  I think that the boneless skinless chicken breasts are too lean for slow-cooking (mine were done after about 4 1/2 hours...any longer, and they would have been dried up).  I agree with earlier reviews concerning the small amount of liquid for cooking...mine burned, too.  The flavor is bland (needs more spice and/or smoky flavor), and I don't see how it would EVER be the consistency of chili...it's more of a burrito/wrap filling.  Something is not right with this recipe.

I myself didn't care for the pinto beans, but the rest of the family ate this up.  Next time I will probably use black beans.  I didn't start this "overnight".  I started in the morning and we were able to eat it that same evening.

I probably won't make this again.  This was bland when following the recipe as stated.  I had to add more chili powder, red pepper flakes, rosemary, and an extra dash of salt. It still remained just ok although it did improve some when left overnight.  Very easy dish to assemble though.

This was pretty decent hearty soup, but I wasn't wowed. My husband ate it as soup while I ate it as a taco salad topping, so I will say that it is versatile and simple  to prepare.

Made this today - didn't start it overnight, so I put the chicken in on high for 1 hour, then low for 3 hours, then I shredded the chicken.

I used 6 chicken breasts (some were a little big), doubled the spices, added 2 cans of diced tomatoes with green chiles, and used 1 can of black beans and 1 can of kidney beans.  For the salsa, I used Newman's Own Roasted Garlic Salsa.  Served with tortilla chips - everyone enjoyed it!

This came out great! I substituted black beans for pinto since I like them better. I also served it with homemade corn bread which goes very well with this hearty chili.

5 stars!  I really like this!  I used 2 cans of beans by accident, but I like beans, 1 pinto and 1 black bean, it was still great.  I wasn't sure I would like the salsa base but with the spices it was perfect.  I served mine with cornbread muffins and it was a hit.

This recipe is wonderful. I used a pressure cooker in place of the slow cooker. 1st- Cut chicken breast into 8 peices(4 peices in half), season with salt, pepper, cumin, chili powder to taste. 2nd- Pour 1 can chicken broth, 16 oz. can salsa, 3 cloves chopped garlic, and chicken into pressure cooker. Cook for 20 mins. 3rd- Take pot off the heat, shredd the chicken with 2 forks. 4th- Add all other ingredients ( 1 more can chicken broth, 2 cans diced tomatos, cilantro, corn, black beans, RESEASON if needed. Bring to a boil for 5 mins and it's ready to serve. Adding cilantro and boiling the soup really add more depth of flavor rather then using it as a topping.

This was very good.  I used black beans since I didn't have pinto and served it with crunched tortilla chips.  It was very flavorful and not too hot for our mild-mannered pallets.  11/12/13 - Since my original revew, this has become one of my most-cooked recipes.  I simply toss frozen chicken breasts in the crockpot, cover with the salsa and spices and shred it when I get home before adding the beans (2 cans of black beans) and corn.  It's great with tortilla chips, instead of crackers, and I've used the left overs in tortilla casseroles.  If you want it spicier, just use hotter salsa - we use  mild to medium.  Really a great recipe.

A+++  This recipe is wonderfully easy and delicious.  I prefer to stretch the recipe by adding two cans of pinto beans and one can of black beans.

i've been searching for a hearty chicken chili for sometime & am very pleased how this one turned out. i followed the recipe as written with just a couple modifications: using "chili addict's" hot salsa & substituting dried anasazi beans for pinto beans (simmer them first until almost tender). my chili came out thick & spicy! serve in a bowl with warm cornbread & you're set! thank you sarah jane!

No No NO.  This is not a good recipe nor is it a bad recipe.  It is just food.  Nothing to rave over.  I did add a can of tomato sauce and some red pepper.  It still wasn't enough to make this anything worth making again.

Wonderful taste and flavor. And so easy to make. I didn't do the crock pot thing and merely shredded my chicken breasts (cooked) and added the ingredients. I did add a little bit of chicken broth just to thin a tad but left everything else the same. Husband added a dash of Tabasco for some extra heat. Great with cilantro, cheddar cheese and sour cream.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! I simply can't rave enough. I added 1 can of Rotel (tomatoes and green chilies) and 1 can of chicken stock after shredding the chicken. Top with some crushed tortillas, cheddar cheese and sour cream and you have something spectacular. This will become a staple in my house :)

Great recipe!  I also used chili beans, and added a can of rotel and an 8 oz can of tomato sauce, and it was perfect.  It was very easy, was spicy enough even for us texans and is healthy too.  We will be making this a lot this winter.

I added diced tomatos as others did.  Like the other suggestions.  I was surprised at the taste.  My first time making chili with chicken.  AND, it is only 3 points on the Weight Watcher Diet plan for 1 cup serving!  Great!

This recipe was easy and different.  My 12 year old son ate two bowls.  I used fresh garlic and added green chilis.  Maybe next time will add can chopped tomatos.

My husband liked this recipe, but I did not care for it much.  It was bland, so, I added more chili seasoning.  I will not make this again.

This turned out better than I imagined. The only differences I made were 2 teaspoons of minced garlic and used cannellini beans instead of pinto. Will make again for sure!

My favorite eeeeasy dish and my go-to for football gatherings and bring-along to parties. A winner. People stalk me down at those events to ask for the recipe. I always keep on hand frozen bagged *sweet white corn just in case. Always use sweet white corn, not Mexican style. I add whatever beans or spices I have on hand to substitute. However one thing I stick with for sure is *Pace Picante Sauce. Have tried several types of salsa, Pace works the best for me. One time I didn't have chicken broth, which a lot of these recipes ask, and it was fine. Just made sure I did not drain the canned items. Easy to adjust the amount of chicken too. When the I often get lazy and don't measure, think it would be hard to screw this up. We just got a Yedi Insta-Pot so will try it in that next. Happy winter cooking friends!

Everyone liked it, even my 3 year old. It wasn’t too spicy for him made as is. You can always add your own hot sauce. Some are the chili by itself or made tacos with it. Great with some fresh cilantro too!

Made pretty much as per the recipe but added some green chile peppers as I only had regular corn. Everyone loved it - I will definitely make again and possibly add jalepenos and some crushed tomatoes next time.

TRIED TO FOLLOW RECIPE EXACTLY but didn't have corn.

We really enjoyed the mild flavor of this chili and as you'd expect it tasted better on day two. Froze well in individual portions for left overs.

First timer on all recipes and wow did I hit it with this one!  Super good!  Super low calorie!  Added green chilies and canned tomatoes.  Great weight watchers dish. 1 cup is 4 points.

This one is GREAT!!!  We loved it as leftovers as well....  Are you supposed to drain the corn and rinse the beans, or just pour the whole can complete in?????

I made this for a potluck at work, I switched out the boneless breasts for 16 boneless and fat trimmed thighs and doubled everything else.  It was mild enough that everyone enjoyed and the entire batch was gone in less than 30 minutes.

This was great. I Used three chicken breasts instead of four added a can of diced tomatos with green chilis, used frozen corn instead of the canned corn and fresh garlic instead of the garlic powder.

This is great.  Of course I changed a lot of things, most importantly, I didn't use a slow cooker.  I used a 3 lb rotisserie chicken (cooked already) from BJs and just shredded it.  I used the red beans, 2 cans of enchilada sauce, one can of tomatoes with green chilils and a "natural" salsa from the store.   (I took a lot of ideas from the people below.)  I also added chicken stock.  I used frozen corn instead of canned (bleh)   I didnt double the spices, but you could if you like an extra kick.  It's REALLY GOOD,  serve with grated cheese and a dollop of sour cream and Frito scoops for dipping!  YUM

This was good but not great.  I think the chicken ratio to beans and corn is too much.  I only used 2 chicken breast and it seemed perfect can't imagine if I had used 4!  I also added one can of diced tomatoes with green chilis b/c it just didn't seem like chili without tomatoes.

This was delicious, quick and easy. I was getting over a bad head cold and I wanted something that was easy but tasty on a cold winter's night. This was it. This will be a regular meal at my home from now on!

I made a big pot and the family loved it. My husband don't even like left overs but he ate some the next day and took some for lunch. My sister and her family came over and couldn't stop raving about it. This is a keeper.

I gave it 3 stars because to make it more like chili we added a ton of tomato juice and chicken broth. Then added more seasonings.

Great recipe, although I did put everything in at once and added a few things;  large can diced tomatoes and crushed tomatoes, small bag of frozen corn and lima beans (we just love them), and two small cans of green chilies. Not too thick or too thin, just perfect!  Think it would have been too dry without the tomatoes and frozen veggies.

Great& easy! My chicken was already cooked so I just cubed it, followed all the rest but I had to add 2 cups of broth to have something more than just meat& veggies.

Like many people I doctored this a bit. First off I used thin sliced chicken breast that I cut into small pieces. I swapped out the pinto beans for black beans, used frozen corn instead of canned, used fresh garlic and to get it up a notch as my family likes spicy I added some crushed red pepper.  I have a larger crock pot so I actually used two jars of Salsa as well, but kept everything else pretty much the same.  I made some quick corn bread as well. I put the meat spices and salsa in before I went to work, when I got home put in the beans and corn and we ate it about an hour and half later.  Long story short it was excellent. Yummy, super easy , fast to make and a huge hit. Will definitely make again.

I followed the recipe exactly (portion-wise) and at the end there seemed to be way too much chicken. It was more of a chicken dish than chili. If I were to revise the recipe, I would use only 2 or 3 chicken breasts, double up on the salsa and beans and I think it would be perfect. Unfortunately I had too much chicken and after sitting in the slow cooker for 4 hours, then shredded it and sat in the slow cooker for another 3 hours, I believe my chicken absorbed all of the juices and soupiness. Nevertheless, it was delicious especially eaten with rice.

Good basic recipe, but I made a few changes. I used 4 pretty large chicken breasts, so there wasn't much liquid after they cooked and I added 1/2 carton of chicken broth. Also added a can of rotel to add in more flavor so it wouldn't be watered down. Also, used a can of black beans in addition to the pintos. My family LOVED it!

The whole family loves this dish.....I added a couple more cans of pinto and kidney beans and tomatoes, diced, as it seemed too much chicken.
You also have to remove the chicken bones before serving.

I made this, but in my hurry I just threw all the ingredients together at the same time, and cooked for 8 hours. It still turned out really good. I took others advice and added a can of green chilies and used black beans instead of pinto. Was really good for enchiladas with a little bit of cheese.

This recipe uses chicken breast--which means there really is no need for such long cooking time. Chicken was perfectly cooked, moist and tender and easily shredding after 1.5 hrs on low. Any longer than that you're going to dry out your meat.
Also, I cut the amount of chicken by half and it was still more than enough!

I liked this, but I made a few changes. I added a packet of taco seasoning. I also added a jar and a half of salsa. If followed the way the recipe is written there is not enough liquid. I also added sugar . After the changes it was awesome!

I added water to make it more like a chili/soup. Before that it was more like a dip. Adding the water may mean I need to re-season it a little but we will see. First taste test proved it may be okay with the added liquid.

Fantastic recipe! It was so easy to make and so tasty.  I put the chicken breasts in frozen and used extra chunky salsa and all the spices listed (I added cayenne as well). My slow cooker doesn't have any settings so after about 4 hours I checked on it and the chicken pulled apart easily.  I threw in frozen corn and I used half black beans, half kidney beans. Another hour and it was ready to go! Will definitely be making this again.

I didn't realize I made this a couple of months ago, but back then I only rated this as a 3. My guess is I used the pinto beans. This time I used black beans and we loved it! We'll definitely make this again.

Excellent!  I took this to a chili-cookoff and won hands-down!  I took the suggestion from the other reviews and added chopped green chilies and used the beans I had on hand - a mix of black and red.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

This is the first recipe here that I really didn't like! Even though I added more seasoning to it, it simply had no flavor in spite of extra chili powder and a can of chicken broth. It felt like the chicken didn't really absorb the spices so everything was very bland.

Easy to make, my wife said it was a little spicy, but I think that was because I used hot salsa. Next time I will use mild.

Very quick meal to assemble -- put everything in all at once.  Turned out very good.  Used fresh salsa instead.  Also used frozen regular corn and added a small can of diced green chilies.  Used pinto and black beans.  Was too soupy at the end (most likely due to water given off by the fresh salsa) so added a cornstarch/water slurry to thicken.  Didn't add any salt -- but served with corn tortilla chips which added enough salt to the entire meal.

Amazing!!!! So flavorful, so delicious! Possibly one of the greatest things I've ever eaten. I served it with tortilla chips, scallions, sour cream and cheese. If I could give this 10 stars I would.

I have made this recipe numerous times and it is always a hit, I even used it for a chili cook off with my coworkers a number of years ago and was selected as the person who brought the best chili, I gave credit to this recipe immediately, of course.

I wanted it for lunch so I used 2 cans of chicken instead of the chicken breast.  Also added 1/2 onion and 3 cloves garlic and browned them on the stove.  Added 1 can cream corn and 1 can regular corn instead of beans!  Will make this again!!!

We love this! I make two changes:
1. Sub black beans for pinto--just my preference
2. Sub 1 C of frozen corn for the 11 oz can of Mexican corn. Double the cumin and give an extra sprinkle of chili to compensate.

*I cook this all day long--with all ingredients--so it's ready when we get home from work. Tastes great this way; don't know if I'm missing anything since I've not been able to add ingredients along the way as written.

We enjoyed this.  Your choice of jarred salsa can make or break this dish, so choose a great one and don't sell the recipe short.  Delicious!  I drained the corn and beans.  Made as written is great, but it was great the second and third times with personal changes.  It is a great and easy base for something you can make really complex on your own.

I made this exactly as directed and it was delicious! I'm sure whatever salsa you use will make a big difference, (I used H-E-B Medium Salsa) but I really enjoyed this and so did my guests. I'll definitely make it again; it's very low maintenance.

This was really good - I'm giving it 5 stars because it was really tasty even though I don't think it qualifies as chili.  There was not enough liquid so I added chicken broth which turned it into a soup. Topped it off with tortilla strips and it was great!

My husband and I both loved this.  The only changes I made were upping the spices a bit, minus the cumin because we don't like it.  I also used frozen corn because I don't like canned corn.  Otherwise followed it exactly, and it turned out great!  The house smelled delicious when I got home from work, and there's nothing better than having dinner ready before I even have my coat off!  Thanks for this recipe!

Really simple to make and really tasty! I only cooked it on low for about 6-7 hours total, adding the corn and beans for the last 30-40 min. Additionally, I added a few dashes of both cayenne pepper and nutmeg plus I doubled the chili powder. I will definitely make this again.

This was great. I loved the salsa as the sauce. We dumped everything in all at once and turned it on low. A few shakes of hot sauce and a dollop of sour cream. Wow this hit the spot. As I was eating it I thought it would be so good rolled up in a burrito. I see others thought the same thing!  EASY, TASTY and low cal. Got to love it. 
We subbed Navy beans for the pinto.

Delicious! Definitely add some cayenne if you prefer spicier. And, as others have suggested, this makes an ideal enchilada filler.

We liked this meal - ALOT!  Will definitely be making it again.  I was a bit hesitant because we don't care for spicy food, but we don't mind if if it's mild.  I used mild salsa, and I didn't add the chili powder - I only sprinkled a little on top before turning on the slow cooker.  We topped it with sliced green onions and crumbled tortilla chips. I'm planning to make a new batch next week and bring it to the office Christmas party. I only used one pound of chicken breasts.

Love this simple crockpot recipe! I made some adjustments like other reviewers like adding diced tomatoes, I use rinsed black and kidney beans (just preference) and will add in chicken broth if it ends up being to thick.  I've also learned that 4 chicken breasts is way too much chicken.  I usually use 2.  I also really like the various Newman's Own salsas. Top with cheddar and sour cream (but really don't need to if you want to keep it low-cal) and you'll have them requesting this meal again and again! :)

This recipe is bizarre. There is no liquid! I just made it, and it looks nothing like the picture here. I would like to know where all that broth is coming from, because I'm currently looking at a pile of chicken in my crockpot, with corn and pinto beans mixed in. Maybe we'll eat it wrapped up in tortillas, because this is definitely NOT chili.

My husband went back for thirds!!! I did follow the advice of some of the reviewers and used this as a 'base' recipe and added a can of chiles, diced tomatoes and black beans. When it was done I thought it was a little too thick so I added a little chicken broth and let it sit for another 1/2 hour on low to heat up evenly.

I made this for dinner last night as written.  Like another reviewer stated, it is better suited as a dip than an entrée.  My husband and stepson didn't care for it much.  I thought the flavors were good.  The leftovers were MUCH better the second day as a quick lunch served with tortilla chips.  Due to the lukewarm response at my house, I will not make this again.

Decided to try this for a summer gathering at my house and it went over so well! As with most things crock-pot, it was so easy, but it was also delicious. 

I did tweak it a little. I doubled the recipe but only used 6 chicken breasts which was more than enough. I ended with a little less "soupiness" than I was hoping for, if I do it again, I will shred the chicken a little less and leave it more intact. I also used black instead of pinto beans and frozen corn instead of canned corn and put everything in at the same time rather than doing the chicken first, this might have been the reason a little more liquid disappeared too. Finally, I cut up a couple chopped poblano peppers to add some kick, I think the dish may have been a little too bland without them.

We really enjoyed this. I had leftover chicken so I made this stovetop and substituted northern beans for pinto. I still just put everything in at once, heated through and then let simmer on low for an hour or so. I used homemade salsa verde. Servings are always so varied on recipes like this but this one was dead on for us.

After 4 hours in the crockpot on low, the salsa was dried out. I was glad I did not do as instructed and leave it in overnight. I added a can of diced tomatoes and some chicken broth to moisten. The flavor was just okay. I've found better chicken chili recipes with more flavor.

I made just as written, did not drain the juices from the corn or beans.  Flavor was great, but very thick for a soup.  We ate over tortilla chips and would have been great in a soft tortilla.

Super easy and yummy recipe. My husband had three servings! I substituted black beans for the pinto and used canned corn.

Although this recipe has a lengthy cooking time, it was quite easy to prepare and the end product was excellent! I was a little nervous the first time I made this as I was unsure how long to cook the recipe (I doubled it as we had guests) but the time suggested worked well. I also used bone in chicken breasts (trimmed) and used Tequila Lime salsa, low sodium beans and a little extra spice to season in place of salt. All my guests from a variety of cultures devoured this! There was nothing left! By the way, this chili pairs great with some warm cornbread, even on a summer's day!

This recipe was great! I used left over turkey from Thanksgiving.  I am not a turkey fan but had to get rid of it.  The chili came out delicious.  Like others I added kidney beans and black beans with the pinto beans.  I also added some diced green chilies. I will definitely try this recipe again with chicken this time.

Nice and easy.  Chicken is fall-apart-tender.  It makes a quick simple meal in a pinch and with the right toppings it can be very satisfying.  Not gourmet but a good weeknight supper.

My family loved this!! I used black beans in place of the pinto beans and added one tsp. more of the chili powder and cumin.  It made it spicier, but; WOW!!! I will definately make this again.

This is THE best chili I have had in a long time.  I'm sure you can jazz it up if you're into eating fire, but this tastes great even if you stick to the recipe.  The only change that we make is that we also add a can of dark red kidney beans in addition to the pintos.  Excellent, frequent lunch/dinner!

Glad I read the reviews before making.  This certainly does not make enough liquid to call it "chili".  I used it as filling for tacos and quesadillas.  It was a BIG hit.  Very tasty. Not sure if my crock pot is too strong, but it certainly didn't take as long as the directions stated to cook. Enjoy!

Holy WOW!  This recipe is just awesome! The only things I did differently were to add two cans of black beans (not drained) in place of the pinto beans, and I added about a half cup of water towards the end of cooking (since some of the moisture seemed to have evaporated during cooking).  This is definately a keeper!

This was a delicious recipe! I added a little more spice to mine because the pinto beans seemed to make it really sweet. I also used black beans. It is definitely something I will make again!

I tried this recipe thinking I would leave the corn out - not a big fan, but I ended up making it exactly according to the recipe and loved the taste!  The next time I made it I substituted the pinto beans with black beans, added onions, green peppers and mushrooms to make enchiladas.  This recipe is so versatile, you can start with the basic and change it up for other uses.  Thanks!

The recipe as stated was pretty good, but I ended up making a couple changes which made it much more to our liking.  I felt it was way too much chicken to not enough veggies so I replaced two chicken breasts with chopped carrots, bell peppers, celery and onion.  Also, after tasting it with just the salsa and spices, I ended up adding a jar of spaghetti sauce and a can of black beans so it didn't taste like, well, salsa!   I didn't think my two young kids would like it that strong.  I had to let it cook a little longer with the lid off to not be so watery.  It's a great concept and I know I will use this idea again, thank you!

This was a delicious recipe.  I had used a 26 oz jar of salsa, so I increased the amount of chicken.  I cut up some onions and garlic and threw them in there.  At the end I put in a can of tomato paste to thicken it up.  Yummy! Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

This is so easy and fabulous!  I even used frozen chicken breasts and had it on low for 8 hours, then shred the chicken and add the rest. Sour Cream, cilantro and cheese on top make this perfect!  It is a beautiful presentation and so easy!

This is a great recipe and very easy to 'throw' together.

I modified my recipe a bit and added:

-Black beans instead of Pinto beans
-2 jars of salsa (1 tomato & 1 salsa verde)

It came out great!  Granted there are only the 2 of us, we had a lot of left overs!

Pretty good recipe-but I did add a bigger jar of salsa-26oz-and used great northern white beans-very thick, so I added a can of chicken broth, which thinned it out a little. Served with sour cream and chips or wrapped in a tortilla. Will make again.

Pretty  good looks like barbecue with beans and corn added. Very easy meal but not sure what to serve with it. Maybe Restuarant coleslaw from this site.

This is one of the best and easiest chili recipes.  I doubled the recipe as we have lots of people eating here. I, like others, substituted black beans - a personal preference.  I made enchiladas the first night then everyone just ate bowls of it.  It got rave reviews!  Will definitely be making this again.

Tasty, but definitely not a "chili" as you wouldn't want to just have this in a bowl as a main dish. Good in a flour tortilla as a burrito & would definitely work well as an enchilada mix!

This was a good recipe. I made it for a superbowl party but it didn't make as much as I would have wanted. Although there were only 6 adults and kids at the party and there was still enough leftover for a medium sized bowl for both myself and my hubby. I got the chicken, a jar of On The Border salsa from the store, and a packet of chili seasoning (only used half or so) mixed up at night. Edited: I also added a can of Rotel. Then about 5 am I poured it in the crock pot and turned it on low. Let that cook for 8 hours or so. Shredded the chicken, put it back in and poured in a frozen bag of corn that is ready made for chili (had other good stuff in it besides the corn) and a half a can of black beans. There just wasn't enough in my pot for the whole can I thought. I'm glad b/c it was a ton of beans as it was! It was the perfect consistency in my opinion, but my hubby said it was a little too runny for him. I put out frito chips, shredded cheese, tortillas, sour cream, and a pan of corn bread (Marie Calendars and it was good!) for people to add to their bowl depending on how they wanted it. Most used it as a dip. I ate it as a bowl of chili. I had another jar of salsa and a can of chili beans on hand, but didn't add it b/c I thought it would be way too runny and way too many beans if I did!  Thanks for a great recipe!

this was great- very easy.  i used one can of enchilada sauce (instead of salsa), six chicken breasts, a can of diced tomato w/green chilis, and a cup of chicken broth (could have used just a half- little soupy).  i threw everything in in the morning, and pulled the chicken out to shred around hour 5 1/2 and found it to be done, so i left it on warm until the "big game".  served with cheese, sour cream, and jalapeno wheels.  loved it!

Very Good and Very Easy!  I only used 3 ckn breasts and thought that was plenty.  Also used plain corn and added a can of diced green chili peppers.  I ended up adding some diced tomatoes and cheese. Served it with crushed up tortilla chips and sourcream.  A keeper!

Tasty.  It burned overnight on the bottom of my crock pot, but not so bad that we couldn't eat it.  I added black beans like a lot of others suggested and it was great.

this stuff is awesome!!!  i actually just made it a few weeks ago--in the middle of summer!  i don't change anything in the recipe.  the only minor thing is that i wish it wasn't so salty, especially because i scoop up the chili with tortilla chips!

This was a good recipe.  The only difference that I made from the original recipe was that I added one can of chopped green chiles. The only thing is that I wish that it was a little more "soupy."

This was a great recipe!  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs which shredded so easily after 6 hours.  I used a can of mixed beans because that is all I had, and I added a large can of diced tomatoes (I really think it needs this).  It turned out great!  I will definately make this again!

This is my go to recipe when I have a busy day.  And my family LOVES it!

I have used frozen chicken breasts and regular frozen corn, and increased the amount of the seasonings. We like things spicy. I also add black beans. 

Even with the frozen chicken breasts I have cooked this on high for 4-5 hours and had it ready for dinner.

This is such a good recipe!!  I have never made this in the slow cooker, I always make this on the stove.  I can whip this together in no time and it is so tasty!  I follow the recipes ingredients, except I add black beans instead of pinto beans.  This is a recipe to keep in your files.  Soo good and soo easy!!  My kids like this too.  What kid doesn't like chicken and corn?

I loved it.  although leaving the chicken in overnight made it a bit stringy, next time I'll just toss it in in the morning and let it cook all day.  It was good, will be making again.

I cooked the chicken on high for one hour than added the other ingredients and cooked an additional 3 hours on low (works better for my schedule). Used black beans instead.  Ate on top of lettuce for a salad and with corn tortillas as a wrap. The whole family loved and it is so easy. I did not prepare overnight.

I love this stuff.  It is so low calorie and so good!  You can add whatever you feel like too.  I make a big pot of it and freeze half.  It's wonderful for snacks and lunches, if you have a microwave at work.  I always make Golden Sweet Cornbread from this site when I make this.

This has quickly become a weekly meal in our family. So easy and so yummy. We eat it as chili-I do add a can of rotel and some broth or water. I also use black beans instead of pinto. We like to layer it over corn chips with lots of cheese. Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

Excellent Recipe! My entire family loves this dish, as do I. I added a large can of crushed tomatoes and like it better. The other way was a bit too thick and this thins it out some without being too soup-like. Still a hearty chili! 5 stars!

Didn't pull out the slow cooker as I only had some pre-grilled frozen chicken breast slices.  I put it all in my large dutch oven and added some fresh yellow, red and poblano peppers.  Also added a can of chili ready tomato.  Served with Shredded white sharp cheddar and minced vidahlia onion--very good!

Wow! Excellent recipe.  Used Paul Newman's Roasted Garlic Medium Salsa and this gave the chili a little bit of a kick.  Everyone at the party we had raved about this chili and it was so easy to make!  I did add a little extra liquid b/c once the chix is shredded it is very thick.  I added 1 can each of kidney and black beans - I think you could what ever beans you favored b/c the recipe is so basic and flexible.  Definitely will make again and again! Thanks!

This gets five stars for taste.  Doesn't really cook up like chilli though.  Half of our family ate this as chilli, the rest of us used it in corn tortillas to make a soft taco.  Wonderful flavor though.

Tastes good, but doesn't really identify as chili in my book unless altered.

I loved this chili!  Didn't have time to cook it in the slow cooker, but it came out fine.  I used Southwest salsa, frozen corn, and left over chicken.  Served with 'excellent and healthy cornbread' from this site and green onions.  Thanks!

This recipe was excellent.  We ate it twice - once as a burrito filling, and second (leftovers) as a hearty soup.  My 4 year old and husband loved it.

This was a really easy recipe.  I look for low fat, high fiber, high taste and this fit the bill.  I took the left overs to work and everyone raved over it! There are a lot of different ways to change it up too!

My family loves this recipe.  I have made it a few times and vary it a little each time.  Each variation has been great.  Sometimes black beans, tomato sauce, other times kidney or pinto beans or both and rotel tomatoes.  It definately needs more tomato. Great!!

Wonderful recipe!  It was a little thick, as others have mentioned.  So I threw in a little tomato sauce and cut back on the chicken.  I think I added more beans too.

Very easy and versatile recipe. I didn't have a full jar of salsa, so I substituted and used 1/2 cup salsa, 1 can of diced tomatoes and a can of chicken broth. I combined that with all of the seasonings in the recipe and let the chicken marinate overnight. Then I cooked it all day long and it turned out perfect! Great low-fat recipe!

This was super easy and filled the house with wonderful smells. It got rave reviews from my husband and two co-workers and I loved it too! I used a can of "Chili Beans" instead of just pinto. Served it over a tortilla with cheese and a dollop of sour cream on top. Next time I ewould use hotter salsa and a little hot sauce to give it more punch.
