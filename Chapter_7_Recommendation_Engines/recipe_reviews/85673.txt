I made this last night.  I used Ghiradelli chocolate chips and the amount of cream called for in the recipe.  I also substituted Kahlua for the Rum.
It was smooth and creamy and RICH.  We dipped strawberries, bananas, marshmallows and potato chips.
Quick and easy.  I will definitely be making this one again!

Made this fondue last night for my  boyfriend's birthday party.  It was a huge hit.  I used 3/4 cup heavy cream and the texture was perfect, never separated all night.  I used an electric fondue pot to control the temperature.  Served with pretzels, strawberries and sandwich cookies.  I will be making this recipe again!

This fondue recipe is so easy and delicious! It is quite thick and a tad grainy, I would add a bit more cream next time I make this. It is also a bit sweeter than I'd like so if you like the chocolatey taste without all the sugar, I recommend using bittersweet chocolate chips.

This is the only normal looking recipie I could find on here...and it's great!  It's pretty thick...but boy oh boy is it good.  I don't think the alcohol is necessary, so those who don't have any at the time shouldn't stress.  It's really easy to make: but heads up: prepare your food to dip before you start making it.  I learned that from experience.  I've dipped strawberries [absolutely mouthwatering], tangerines [tangy and sweet= addicting], apples, bananas, and chilled angels foodcake.  Marshmallows are pretty good too.  =]

I didn't have rum on hand so I made it without it and it still turned out great!

This recipe was super easy, and sooo good!  I had a fondue party, and this was perfect for desert.  We dipped strawberries (my fav!), Oreos, graham crackers, marshmallows and pretzles.

A wonderfully easy and delicious recipe!  My guests raved - I served it with pretzels, doughnuts, sponge cake, bananas, apples & marshmallows.  Also, I added some milk chocolate to the recipe.

We followed the recipe exactly and it was really runny so we added almost a whole second bag.   After that it tasted really good!  (still a bit runny)

For three people, scale the recipe to 4-6 servings...depending upon the depth of the chocolate love going on. Best dippers...banana, raspberries, strawberries, pound cake, and pretzels.
