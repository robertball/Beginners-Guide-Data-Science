A little tip with the cream cheese/milk blending.  I noticed that a lof of people have posted complaints about lumps.  The trick is to not put the cream cheese with all 4 C. of milk or you will get lumps no matter how high you turn on the blender.  Mix all of the cream cheese with a small amount of milk until smooth and slowly add the rest of the milk while blending and the mixture will stay smooth.  I hope this helps!

This is incredibly good, I have friends beg me to make it! The only thing I do differently from the recipe is to put a layer of chocolate icing underneath the pudding mixture to make it taste just like an eclair. I use the icing from the recipe on this site called "Eclairs II" submitted by Patty. With the addition of chocolate, this dessert is irresistible! I also take the Hershey's Syrup and drizzle it in lines over the top of the Cool Whip and run a knife tip accross to make a pattern, which comes out very pretty. The chocolate *REALLY* makes this dessert. Hints I would offer are, try and spread the dough mixture as evenly as possible in the pan before baking but don't get upset if it puffs all over the place and looks unshapely. Just give the big bubbles a squash as you assemble. The cream cheese and milk don't like to blend smoothly, start with a little liquid at a time to encourage the lumps to go. I've never had it seem lumpy in the end, even when I wasn't able to get it totally smooth. If you are really feeling decadent, try using half and half instead of milk with the pudding. I never have leftovers of this!

Is it possible to be in love with a dessert? I saw this recipe and tried to find an excuse to make it. So a work function came up and I whipped it up for that.  The dough part may seem intimidating, but it's very easy! After baking, it bubbles up quite a bit, but i just pushed the crust down to the bottom of the pan to lay flat for filling. I spread a whole jar of hot fudge in the bottom of the crust, then proceeded to fill with the pudding/cream cheese mixture. By the way, as users mention, make sure you beat this VERY well to get the clumps out. I had to put the whisk attachment on my kitchenaid mixer and put it on high to make it smooth. And furthermore, it doesn't taste anything like cream cheese, but it turned out perfectly regardless so I'll still be sticking to the recipe. I topped with the cool whip and drizzled Hershey's chocolate syrup, then also added crumbled chocolate cookies on top. I could probably eat this whole pan myself! One important thing to note, this tastes like a gigantic eclair, so I personally would name this "Eclair Pie" since it doesnt seem at all like a cake, or like a cream puff. Highly HIGHLY recommend.

Great recipe I made it using two 9" pie plates and cooked the pastry for 20 minutes. The second one we froze and ate later it was just as good as the first!

This recipe was absolutely amazing, although we liked the corner pieces best (the middle pieces can be a little sloppy, and it's tastiest to have a little of everything in each bite!), so I'd recommened making this in two 8x8 inch pans rather than a 9x13. Will make this again and again!

Mmm, mmm. Like a lot of other reviewers, I added a layer of chocolate at the bottom (the icing from the Eclairs II recipe--I do NOT recommend canned frosting). Next time, I may just melt some chocolate chips with a little butter for the bottom layer. Anyway, I took this to work (in addition to making a smaller pan for home), and it was a total hit! Oh, I also put chocolate curls on top rather than chocolate syrup. This made a VERY pretty--and tasty--dessert.

I made this for Christmas and everyone loved it.  I divided the recipe into 2 pie plates and also added the chocolate frosting over the shell before adding the filling.  The cream puff paste is VERY sticky when trying to spread it in the pans, but I sprayed my hands with Pam and that worked great.  I will make this over and over again!

This cake was fabulous!!  My mom made our family's favorite cake and I made this one.  For the first time ever... the non-favorite was eaten!!  In my family that is a true testament for greatness!  Make sure you spray a flat spatula with cooking spray to push the dough around the pan.  Otherwise it will stick to it.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was delicious.  I was amazed that this actually tasted like a cream puff.  I used 2% milk and french vanilla pudding.  The cake was served to a group of friends and they all seemed to enjoy it.  I was also amazed at how the shell puffed up the sides of the pan.  The presentation was unusual and pretty.  I'll definitely make this again!

This was dynamite. I've always liked eclairs (my favorite dessert)and after the first taste I felt like I could gobble up the whole 9x13 pan, in one sitting. The dough stuck to the pan to some extent, making it difficult to lift a serving and have it stay in one piece. Other than that, awesome cake - and easy to make, too. This is going to get made many times. Thanks for sharing it.

Not sure how this will taste, but it was easy and sure smells good.  The individual components tasted just fine by themselves.  I made this for tomorrow's Christmas dinner with family.  They will let me know how they feel about it, and I will edit review then. UPDATE: The family went nuts.  They loved it.  The only changes I made were adding a double batch of Eclair II icing on the bottom and sprinkling green and red sugar on top.  Garnished with a little hot fudge topping right before serving.  My sister in law demanded that for Christmas next year, all she wants is one of these cakes all to herself!  :D  GREAT Recipe! THANKS!
~ANOTHER UPDATE~
Made this April 9 with chocolate pudding, in a springform pan, with hot fudge sauce on the bottom.  Presentation is very nice, easier to spread batter in the springform pan.  It was very good also, but I think I slightly prefer the orginal flavor, of French Vanilla pudding.  Yum!  Either way, this is an easy and impressive dessert and I'll be making it many times.  Don't forget to let the cream cheese soften first, then blend with about a cup of milk then add the rest of the milk and you won't have any lump problems with the filling!

I made the wonderful cream puff base, but instead of the filling listed I made a tiramisu filling(mascarpone cheese, whipped cream, coffee liqueur etc.). I grated chocolate on top for an extra crunch. It looked and tasted great! (I have put up a picture.)

This is the most delish cake I have ever made! I used half and half instead of milk since I wanted a creamier filling and it came out fantastic. I made it for my son's 23rd birthday and it is his newest favorite. Also, the tip of putting a layer of melted chocolate on the crust before the filling does keep the crust from getting soggy. I melted about 1.5 cups of choc chips, mixed with 2 tbls of butter and a little milk to smooth it out, then smoothed it over the crust with the back of a large spoon. I recommend this for any special occasion!

I made this cake over the weekend with my 7 year old daughter...and it was a hit everyone LOVED it even my picky 2 yr old son. After the "puff" cooled I frosted the bottom and sides with chocolate frosting then added puddin and the cool whip on top.  It was all gone by the end of the day, this was a real easy and quick cake. Really good for the spring/summer season :)

I was so tired of plain old cake and frosting that I decided to make this for our daughter's birthday cake. One bite and my husband and other daughter both said 'I want this for my birthday!'. No kidding, it was that good. I put a layer of Magic Shell on the crust then put it in the freezer so the chocolate could harden, then put the filling on. The chocolate kept the filling off the crust. Mine did not stick or get soggy. I also put magic shell on the top and chocolate bar shavings. Thank you so much Nancy! I know I'll be making this one again and again. Especially when we want a cool summer dessert!

This could be one of the best desserts I have ever had!  The only thing I changed was once the crust cooled, I spread a jar of fudge topping (found in the ice cream section) over it.  Then I topped that with the pudding.  Also, instead of cool whip, I would strongly suggest making your own whipped cream!  Beat 1 c. heavy cream with 1/4 c. confec. sugar and 1 tsp. vanilla.  Since I used the fudge topping, I omitted the syrup.  Plus, I think the bright white whipped cream looks appetizing on its own without the chocolate on top.

This was one of the prettiest desserts I have ever seen!! It tasted great too, and I don't even like cream cheese!  I can't believe how easy this was to make, it was done w/in 2 hours and I even used real whipped cream and made chocolate covered cherries to top it off.  This cake got great reviews and people going back for seconds, will definitely keep this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This cake was fabulous and so easy to prepare! I cut the recipe in half and used a 9 inch springform pan. It fit perfectly. Don't be afraid if it looks like the dough is scarce before baking. It puffs up wonderfully, hence the name! Will absolutely make again!

Instead of chocolate syrup(which isn't very much like chocloate at all) try this: Buy a product called Nutella. It's a chocolate-hazelnut spread, very good! If you can't find it at your supermarket, try an italian speciality store/deli. Combine the Nutella and whipping cream in a small bowl. Heat in the microwave for about 30 seconds until warm. Stir the mixture. Drizzle the chocolate-hazelnut sauce atop the cake.
1/2 cup chocolate-hazelnut spread (Nutella) 
1/4 cup whipping cream 
(or make more depending how much you want/need)

YUM......so, so good and so easy to make. Instead of the 9 x 13 pan, I did use 2 9" cake pans and made 2 for 2 different birthdays. Huge hit with both recipients. The one change I made was using butter flavored shortening instead of butter for the shell. I was out and didn't have time to run to the store.  I did drizzle with with a ganache and also used it to coat the inside of the shell per some other suggestions, to make it more like an eclair. Also used the handy tip about mixing in the cream cheese with 1/2 C of milk to make it nice and smooth before adding the rest of the milk and pudding mix. It made it lump free. Will make again.

DELICIOUS! I make cream puffs all the time and never thought to go this route.
 I too spread some melted chocolate(1 cup semi sweet chips mixed with a tsp of butter) onto cooled crust.  For the pudding mixture I whipped cream cheese then slowly added in liquids-which I did 2 1/2 cups milk, 2 1/2 cups heavy cream-much richer flavor-I thought the filling was too stiff-so that's why I added extra milk/heavy cream.
Also for my taste preference I made fresh whipped cream(2 cups heavy cream, 3/4 cup conf sugar squirt of vanilla-whip til stiff peaks form) to top with and skipped the chocolate syrup.  This turned into an decadent dessert that was sooo yummy.

I made this for my husband for Valentine's Day. I ended up making two 9" pies instead with it. Turned out so tasty. Baked for 20 minutes. I let the cream cheese get to room temp before trying to blend it with the milk. used my hand mixer and had little/no clumps. I melted 2 herseys milk chocolate bars with alittle butter to make a "sauce" to put on the shell. After cooled the sauce hardened and gave alittle crunch to the pie...so good. It looked so professional and tasted so good. I took one of the pies to my inlaws since they watched my daughter so we could have dinner alone. My Mother in law said it was her favorite pie EVER and didnt want to share with anyone. and my husband who isnt a big dessert or sweets fan loved it.

A wonderful recipe.  Other recommendations are worth the effort.  Make sure the dough is smooth in the pan before baking this stops large air pockets from forming.  And the layer of chocolate(from another eclair recipe) on the cooled dough before adding the cream cheese mixture makes the difference from "cream puff" to eclair. And if you want the cream cheese mix to be smooth make sure you add only a small amount of milk till the cream cheese is thinned out, then add the rest of the milk with the pudding.  All in all a great recipe.  A hit every time I make it.

Talk about simple and easy.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and made two 8x8 pans and baked for 20 minutes.  I also used a dark chocolate frosting that I heated slightly in the microwave as the first layer.  I think it really needed the extra.  I used French vanilla pudding and Hershey's syrup to finish it off.  The cake was a huge hit and tastes just like a cream puff.  It was fun and easy and I will keep in mind for the next time I need a desert.

I have made this recipe for years. In fact, I made this for a Tea House when I helped get one started.  My recipe is slightly different. The crust is the same, but I spread it thinly in a jelly roll pan instead of a 9x13. It's important to Pam Spray it first.  It will bubble up.  The filling is (2) lg. 8-oz cream cheese, (2) large instant vanilla pudding, 4-1/2 cups cold milk (not skim), 1 Smuckers chocolate fudge syrup.  Mix pudding & milk.  In separate bowl mix softened cream cheese, then add 1 cup of the pudding, then add the whole mixture to the rest of the pudding. This way the cream cheese doesn't get lumpy.  Add cool whip and drizzle with syrup.  Smuckers is thicker and I dot it over the cool whip and take  toothpick and marblelize it.  I usually store it in a half sheet cake box that you can buy from the bakery.  It's best made the night before.

Delicious! Simple to make! What more could you ask for?!  I was a little surprised when I checked on the pastry/crust as it was baking, and the crust was puffing up unevenly in all directions! I poked the puffiest parts with a fork so it would deflate and flaten out (good idea).  Perhaps it would have flattened out by itself as it cooled???  As others recommended, spread the pastry with chocolate frosting and didn't fill with all the pudding.  Lastly, I used real whipped cream for topping (add sugar and vanilla extract to desired taste).  YUMMY!

Easy to make.  Made the filling the day before.   Even though I mixed a little milk into the room temp cream cheese, I still had tiny lumps in the pudding.  Took advice of other reviews and made the "eclairs II" icing and put a thin layer on the baked pastry.  Most people really liked the dessert.  I thought it was too sweet.  I think I might have preferred it with real whipped cream.  This was fine for something different. Probably won't make again.

I made 2 cream puff PIES instead of making one in a 9 x 13 pan. With the addition of the chocolate icing added to the cream puff crust, it did indeed taste like a cream puff!  I used Sanders Hot fudge topping as the chocolate icing and drizzeled it on top of the whip cream and it was perfect...not too sweet, nice and light!  It was a Thanksgiving favorite among many other pies this year!

We had a girls' get-together last weekend, and one of the gals brought this.  A real crowd pleaser!  She added some almond extract to the pudding mixture, which imparted a very elegant flavor.

I make home made cream puffs all the time but this cake is easier than making individual puffs. however I prefer home made pastry cream for the filling. tastes best to me. avoid putting the filling on the cake untill just before serving to keep it crisp.   The cream puff base makes the best crust for any kind of cream pie!  tastes like it came from a high end bakery!

I made as stated. I agree that the crust tastes quite "eggy" (and I did bake until med dark brown like suggested in reviews)But... don't cream puffs usually taste eggy? I think so. And I thought the amount of filling was perfect. . I loved the way it puffed up over the edge of the baking dish:it was beautiful and rustic looking. I will make again but will use French Vanilla pudding (or a homemade custard),add some vanilla and try adding milk in place of one of the eggs. I won't add sugar though, it was sweet enough for our tastes. Good idea, and a very nice dessert!

I love making this cake for dessert for Easter lunch.  I was closely following the recipe and came to the point where the pudding mix was to be added to the milk/cream cheese mixture.  I was beating the final mixture, but the pudding never thickened!  What was wrong?  I retrieved the pudding boxes and found they were not the instant pudding.  What to do!?  I poured the mixture into a pot and cooked the mixture - cream cheese and all.  I was afraid it was going to be ruined, but I thought, what have I got to lose?  I cooked the milk, cream cheese and pudding mixture (low heat) and it thickened nicely and I couldn't tell the difference between that method and the one that uses instant pudding.

SUPER delicious and rich! It's a nice alternative to the timely process of making individual cream puffs. It's also a lot messier since there is very little structure within the cake, but still delicious!

Second time making, rave reviews and an empty dish to take home from a friend's dinner party.  After reading the reviews, followed the tips for blending and it was lovely.  Used a pint of Half n Half then added whole milk to make my 4 cups.  Smeared Nutella on the bottom of the crust, this totally makes the cake. Also added 1/2 tsp vanilla to kill the instant pudding "processed food" taste.  Sprinkled cocoa on top for color.  Made in a 10" Springform pan, much nicer presentation than 9 x 13 cake pan which I used the first time, and everyone gets a serving of the amazing crust.  Absolutely delish!

Such a hit! I made this for a group of people over for dinner at my Mom's and my Mom doesn't like to eat sweets--she had three servings, all after 7pm (Imagine that!). With that said, this dessert satisfies both the sweet tooth and those who don't like things too sweet. I did what others suggested-- add the milk slowly to cream cheese to avoid lumps. I also used the recipe from "Eclairs II" to add chocolate before the pudding and it turned out really great this way. However, next time I am going to try to just buy ready made ice-cream meltable fudge from the store, in order to save time. I am sure it would be just as good. I also used FRENCH vanilla pudding, which really made a difference and half and half instead of milk. The only questionable thing was in Step #2, the directions say that the dough will "pull away from the pan" and I wasn't entirely sure if it was ready or not, but everything turned out fine. Super easy and such a crowd pleaser! I called it my "Giant Eclair Dessert" and definitely recommend trying this!

Genius idea and yummy dessert, but didn't really taste like cream puffs.  I followed the recipe exactly except I topped with chocolate eclair frosting instead of the syrup.  I would make this again for an easy and crowd-pleasing dessert.

This is delightful! I scaled the recipe down to 18 so I could do it in a 9"Springform pan for presentation purposes. Never having made cream puffs before I had no idea what to expect with this. Screwed up the amount of butter (tripled it) to start and had to throw it out and start over. Really fast and easy. Not sure if my dough needed a little more flour, it was really sticky, but I got it in the pan and up the sides. Looked like a volcano once it cooked, just poked the middle down, added chocolate pudding mix (it was what I had to use), cool whip on top and drizzled melted nutella and peanut butter mixed on the top. I refrigerated in the pan overnight and gave it to my dad for his 82nd birthday. It was so good!! The crust part held it's shape after taking the side off and wasn't soggy after refrig overnight. It looked very nice. Thanks Buchko!

Amazing!  It really puffed up but after it cooled I just pressed it with my hand and it was fine.  I was afraid the egg would "cook" when added to the hot flour mix but it didn't.  I cut the recipe in half and used one big box of the vanilla pudding.  Gonna go now and have some for breakfast!

Wonderful recipe. I needed it to be a finger food so I made individual servings using my muffin tins(I only cooked them for about 15 min.). They turned out perfect. I followed the advice of others and put a layer of chocolate on before the pudding. I used the satiny chocolate glaze from this site. Delicious!

This is a 4 star as is, but with the Eclair II chocolate filling addition it is a 5* !. It is easy,  delicious and has great presentation... I baked mine is a 9" springform pan.  This created a bowl like cake with high sides to hold all the yummy filling.  Baked for 28 min. Recommend it !!

This was SO good and SO easy! What a great combination!  Took this to a family reunion and EVERYONE wanted the recipe (those that were lucky enough to get a piece that is!)  I followed one reviewers suggestion to use the Eclairs II frosting recipe from this site to spread on the baked crust.  It would NOT have been near as good without this.  I think next time I will double the chocolate frosting layer and make in two pie pans so I can make one with vanilla pudding and one with chocolate for the chocolate lovers!  I was asked to PLEASE bring again next year!

I have been making Nancy's cream puff cake for years.  It is unbelievably delicious! I am frequently asked to make it - even people who don't like cream puffs seem to love it.  

I prefer to use one box each of vanilla, white chocolate & cheesecake flavor pudding mix. After much experimenting, here is the method I have come up with to avoid cream cheese lumps in the filling: First, mix only the dry pudding and milk together by pouring the milk into a large bowl, adding the dry pudding mixes & whisking for a minute or two. Put the softened cream cheese in a separate bowl (I think the 1/3 light cream cheese works better because of it's softer texture).  Add one large spoonful of the pudding mixture to the cream cheese and blend thoroughly with a spoon until there are no lumps.  Add another spoonful or two of pudding to the cream cheese mixture until well blended.  Then, add the rest of the remaining pudding to the cream cheese mixture all at once & whisk by hand or use a hand mixer on low or medium. 

Instead of chocolate syrup, I prefer to use either hot fudge sauce or melted chocolate chips.  I drizzle chocolate over the shell before adding the pudding mixture & then over the Cool Whip.  The melted chocolate chip sauce hardens a bit on the top of the cake once cool. 

I make this in a 9x13 glass baking dish which has been very lightly sprayed with cooking spray so the shell doesn't stick too much.

I usually use at least one box of cheesecake pudding to add a richer flavor.  I'll spread an entire jar of Nutella over the shell before adding the filling.  Always a hit.

Thanks for a great recipe! Very versatile and you can definitely use your imagination to create your own puff cake.
I added about two tablespoons of sugar and 1/4 tsp. of salt in the pastry crust; I think it brings out the flavor of the puff pastry. For the pudding mixture, I used a can of condensed milk and omitted a cup of milk and a box of pudding mixture. And instead of the cool whip, I beated a cup of heavy whipping cream with two tablespoons of sugar and a tablespoon of bailey's. Finally I topped it off with a crust of the turtle delight magic shell by Smucker's. Next time I plan on making a banana rum puff cake..can't wait!!

My dad has diabetes and I am following Weight Watchers so I used neufchatel cheese, no-sugar/no-fat instant pudding, skim milk and Lite Cool Whip.  It came out wonderful.  My family, who are usually skeptical about "light" desserts, thought it was excellent.  Even my mom, who dislikes sweets, had two servings!  I plugged the recipe as I made it into the Weight Watchers Recipe Builder and it calculated each serving to be 3 points.  This recipe is definitely a "make again".

Just made this for the bunco girls.  Everyone loved it.  I followed a previous reviewer's idea of pouring a layer of Chocolate Fudge Magic Shell between the crust and the pudding.  I will make this again.  Also, there were no clumps of cream cheese as others have had...I have a Kitchen Aid mixer and I used the wire whisk attachment and mixed ROOM TEMPERATURE cream cheese with milk,  pouring the milk VERY slowly...no lumps.

This is a cool and refreshing dessert.  My family loved it, in fact they challenged me to make individual desserts.  My husband suggested to use a cupcake pan and to fill it with chocolate pudding instead. So I presented it to my family again, and they loved it.  I did combine the cool whip with the pudding mix which made it lighter, then I sprinkled powdered sugar on top. I get requests all the time for the cupcake version!!

This tasted great. It was far too much pudding for me, though. I made the filling and opted to put only 3/4 of it in. Next time, I would halve the filling. The next day mine was soggy.I probably should have let the filling thicken more. Also, would agree with other reviewers to put in two small pans.

I love chocolate eclairs and when my mom said she did not enjoy making them, I decided to try this recipe and it was fabulous!!  Like other reviewers, I added another layer of chocolate on the bottom and I also used canned frosting.  I thought it worked well, just gave it a grainier texture compared to the pudding.  Next time I would used less pudding because the pudding becomes overpowering and you don't really taste the cream puff.  This is definetely a keeper!!

What a great recipe!!  My family just loved it. I added chocolate icing.  After the eclair is cooled, I spread chocolate icing on it, then put the pudding filling on, the whipped cream and chocolate syrup.  For the icing - I got the recipe from the Eclairs II recipe from this site.  I doubled the icing recipe.  Delicious!!!

I love this and make it often with some changes. I soften the cream cheese in the microwave ( in a bowl) for a minute or so and then I beat it until it's smooth and creamy, then I add the milk a little at a time until it's a thick smooth paste and then I go ahead and add the rest of the milk- no lumps. Before I put the pudding mix on, I paint the cooked and cooled pastry with melted dark chocolate and let that set ( save a little to drizzle on top!). I don't like cool whip in this dessert so I whip 4 cups of heavy cream along with 4 tablespoons of dry pudding mix, 2 teaspoons of powdered sugar and a teaspoon of vanilla until stiff peaks form. This whipped cream is delicious and won't deflate even after a few days in the fridge.

I was amazed at how that crust puffed up! Easy to make, impressive to serve. Like other reviews, I spread fudge over the bottom of the crust. Serve the same day.

I LOVE cream puffs! This recipe is very easy, light and tasty -everyone loved it and asked for some to take w/them even my brother Mr. non-sweet who doesn't usually like desserts.  I made it the same day (first time) thought the cake would get soggy to my supprise w/one piece left over it was eaten the next day and the cake was fine so, next time I would make the night ahead and not worry about the cake getting soggy.  One note to be sure and "bake" throughly (until golden and puffy) otherwise your cake will taste too eggy. This is a new #1 favorite for the Holidays and potlucks.

Sorry but this just didn't do it for me.  It tasted like pudding on a cracker.  Oh and then there are the little lumps of cream cheese that I couldn't get to go away no matter how fast I turned my Kitchen Aid to.  It didn't really matter because you can't tell there is cream cheese in it anyway.  I'm serious...it is basically pudding on a crust with some whipped cream on top.  Not going to be making this again anytime soon.

This was a good dessert but nothing incredible or different. It didn't really have a WOW factor. At first I was alarmed at the crust rising and "puffing" up, but when it cooled it was perfect!I agree with one reviewer who said you couldn't taste the cream cheese. I am not big on making things from a box. I may try homemade vanilla pudding and chocolate sauce if I make this again. The pudding was a little overwhelming.

My daughter, the aspiring chef, made this for a French class food project.  I barely tolerate sweets, but after tasting this treat, I would forever make eating this cake an exception.  It was absolutely divine.  She did buy cook and serve pudding in error, but cooked it with the cream cheese, and it still came out excellent!

There are no words to describe how fantastic this cake is. My guest were fighting over the last piece. It is very light and refreshing. Instead of chocolate syrup, I used a chocolate sauce recipe that was made from semi-sweet chocolate squares, corn syrup and heavy cream that is used for dipping fruit. Frankly, I think the recipe is awesome enough to stand alone without the chocolate sauce or syrup.

OMG!  Way past good. I used French Vanilla pudding and almost lost my fingers.  I recently tried  banana pudding and again watch it, your family and friends will hurt you to get to it.  LOL  I like anything that is simple, and I can have this done in 1 hour and in the refrigerator.  I';m trying chocolate at Christmas.

Fantastic!  Though I would call it more of an "eclair cake".  I cut the recipe in half and prepared it in a round 9 1/2" cake pan.  I got SO many compliments and was even told by my sister in law that this is her favorite dessert I've made.  Even tastes great the next day though the crust is soggy by then.

Very good!  I messed up and purchased the small size boxes of pudding.  Man did I panic. I ended up using all three of the small size vanilla pudding and only 3 cups of milk.  Tasted divine!  Couldn't stop eating the filling.  I took suggestions and put a thin layer of fudge under the filling.  I love this recipe.  Tasted great.

I loved this recipe except the filling seemed a little too thick...I added a half tub of cool whip to the filling mixture and it still seemed not creamy enough. Next time I'll add a full tub of whipped cream to the filling. Still delicious though. UPDATE***I mad this again over the weekend and added a layer of nutella on the bottom before adding the filling. DELICOUS!!!!

This is incredibly good, but it's best when refrigerated a few hr. or overnight! Next time i would try using 2 pie plates. I had no trouble spreading the pastry into the pan! I put my cream cheese in the blender with 1-2 cups of the milk and it didn't get lumpy. I used Hershey's syrup, but next time I will try the satiny chocolate glaze from this site for a richer chocolate taste. I will make this again!!

Creamy and delicious! My addition because I didn't have chocolate sauce was to chop up a chocolate bar and sprinkle on the crust right out of the oven and then let it cool. I can't wait to try with different flavours of pudding and fruit. Yummm!

I'd say 3.5 stars, if I could.  4 because it was super easy to put together.  3 because the filling didn't taste like anything extra special.  But the kids and guests devoured it, so it's all good!  I'll be making this again!

The pastry was authentic, but the filling was not nearly as good as a real cream puff filling.  I would not make this again, unless I found a decent filling recipe.

Very good, but I changed a few things, and I think I would stick to the original recipe next time. I made it in a spring form pan, so it looked exactly like the picture posted, and I would do that again. I put in one package of chocolate, and 2 packages of vanilla pudding and I should have stuck to only the vanilla to make it truly taste like a cream puff.

Very yummy and easy! I recently made it for a fathers day cookout and was a hit. One tip.. I made the chocolate sauce from the eclairs II recipe (recom. by others) to layer between the crust and filling - make sure to add enough water to thin out the chocolate and spread a THIN layer on the crust. Mine was too thick and it hardens up. Will def make again. Thanks!!

I thought this was good but my hubby and his friend loved it. To me it is a little too sweet... Something about the combo of cool whip and instant vanilla pudding and choc syrup. I think it would be better with homemade custard and real whipping cream. But it's definitely easy! I would make it again with some tweeking.

This is so freaking good! I only had one package of pudding so I scaled the milk down to 2 cups and the filling turned out great(I have used a mixture like this for years for another cake recipe I make). I also think that was plenty of filling, so I'll probably keep making it that way. For the chocolate part I melted some chocolate chips with a spoonfull of peanut butter in the microwave and I put that on top of the crust before the pudding mixture and drizzled it over the top. I love this recipe and will make it for years to come. Thanks so much for sharing!

Thanks for a great recipe, family says it's a keeper. I made it as written and it was great that night. After reading reviews I tried it again with a few changes. I baked crust in 2 pie plates, I divided the cheese 'n milk mixture and made one batch with vanilla pudding and choc garnish; the other batch with butterscotch pudding and choc garnish. Thanx for the tip to mix cr cheese and milk. Delicious

Baker's Joy is the secret. It pops right out when you use that. I used Sugar Free Pudding, added a tsp of vanilla to kick it up. Used low fat cream cheese and fat free cool whip. It was delicious! No need to add all those extra calories with regular ingredients. Family felt alot less guilty eating a piece after a large meal! Crust definately puffs way up. I think I would pay more attention to getting it up the side more to make it thinner. I pushed it down when it came out of the oven. Definately will make it again.

Oh so yummy!  Very easy to make.  As I started to make the pasty crust I was thinking that 4 eggs were too much.  I got a fork and the eggs mixed in nicely, no problem.  The filling was a little lumpy and I mixed the milk into the cream cheese a little at a time.  Next time (and there will SO be a next time)  I'm going to mix the milk and pudding together and then soften the cream cheese to slightly warmer than room temp and see if I cannot get rid of the lumps.  However, it didn't affect the taste at all.  I also took the advice of another reviewer and spread chocolate frosting (I just used a store bought frosting) onto of the pastry before I put the filling in.  SO YUMMY!

This is absolutely delicious and so easy to make. The only thing I did different was use 3 cups of milk and 1 big box of inst vanilla pudding. I would rather have more puff than cream, just a preference. The flavor is awesome.

I must say I was quite dissapointed after the 5 star rating.  I made it exactly as written- mistake.  I would also use 2/3 the filling that it called for, maybe more whipped topping... it sure could use that chocolate layer everyone discusses here too.  Not being a real instant vanilla pudding fan, I believe I would make my own pudding for the middle as well.  None of the kids from two families would eat it.

Okay, we loved the filling and the chocolate, but the crust part was disgusting!  It puffed up beautifully and it looked nice, but it was way too eggy tasting!  It needs to be less egg tasting and a little sweeter.  We just scraped all the stuff off the crust and ate it by itself!  I am thinking maybe I will try using a puff pastry next time for the bottom layer.

My daughter loves cream puffs so we made this for her 16th birthday. I was a little worried about the taste of the cream cheese but it doesn't shine through. Wonderful cake tastes like the real thing. I will be making this again tomorrow. I added a little vanilla to the filling. YUMMY!

It looks pretty with the coolwhip and chocolate sauce, but got better reviews taste wise without them on top.  Maybe because it tasted like a traditional cream puff that way and less like a dessert one would pick up at the supermarket.  This was much preferred to traditional cream puffs around here.  Cream puffs are hard to perfect (they fall all too easily, hard to keep it puffy) and the ratio is off with normal cream puffs because in order to get the desired amount of pudding with your puff, it's  a mess to eat!  All in all this recipe is a winner.  I'd give it 5 stars without the coolwhip and chocolate, but I'm a basic cream puff kind of girl. One last note: from experience, this pudding mixture is the best I've come by as far as complimenting the "crust" so well.  A "keeper" for sure!

So easy (foolproof, actually!) and so good.  I made this the night before for a coworker's birthday.  I was concerned that that the pastry/cake may become soggy sitting overnight, but it wasn't.  We had an office full of women "oooohing" and "ahhhhing" over this.

Instead of using all vanilla pudding, I used one white chocolate, one cheesecake, and one vanilla.  I also stirred in a tablespoon or two of Nestle strawberry Quik.  It turned out great!  I loved the texture of the crust.

Very good. I only used about 2/3s of the pudding. It was a little runny on bottom. I used skim milk so that may have been part of the problem. I also added chocolate frosting on top of the crust before adding the pudding. It didn't look too good after I cut it because of the juice under the crust but to my suprise the crust didn't taste soggy at all. I will definetely make this again- I will not use quite as much skin milk in the pudding next time.

Really good. I've never made cream puffs before. I guess I've been too intimidated. But the puff turned out wonderful. I thought I'd make this extra special by using "Bird's Custard" which is a cooked custard and although it was good I think it would have been equally as good had I just used instant "french vanilla". Will try that next time.

This is great!  Try with sliced bananas and/or

Oh my this is to die for!!!  I had to change up the recipe quite a bit, I used homemade vanilla pudding (from this website) for the filling and topped with a pint of whipped heavy cream sweetened with 2 T. sugar.  It was so wonderful, I can't wait to have company over so I can serve this again!!!  Thank you so much for the recipe.

This was great, I used 2 pie plates and placed a layer of chocolate glaze on the crust before filling, I also couldn't read that day and I folded in the Whipped topping to the filling and it turned out great, Had dinner company that evening and everyone thought great dessert. Mother-In_Law thought it was even better than regular pies...

I’m giving this recipe 4 stars because its idea served as the base for my own altered recipe. I cut the dough measurements by half so that I’m left with a thinner dough both on the bottom and on the sides (I just couldn’t stand the inch wide dough on the sides). I also only bake it for 25 minutes and not the instructed 35. Anyway, I also used a Spanish type of rich vanilla pudding mix called Maizena instead of the pudding and cream cheese combination. For the whipped cream I use whipping cream, some confectioners’ sugar and a little vanilla extract. Finally for the chocolate touches that this recipe calls for I use some semi sweet kisses melted with milk (but only for the top since I don’t add the bottom chocolate layer before adding the pudding). 
This recipe truly those create a good starting point for anybody wanting to make a decadent yet smooth dessert that will blow everybody’s socks off!

I have mixed feelings about this cake. I make cream puffs/eclairs from scratch and thought this would be a nice time saver instead of having to fill each pastry individually. I was very pleased with the end result after baking the dough, it was a golden brown and  puffed. I made it in a spring-form pan. The filling I made as directed using french vanilla pudding mix and in place of the milk, half 'n half. Gradually mixing in the liquid a few tablespoons at a time into the softened cream cheese will help prevent lumps of cream cheese in  mixture. What I did not like was that the pastry became soft/soggy from the filling. This was disappointing. Flavor was great though.

Very good.....very rich and a little piece goes a long way. Like others have said, the dough looks kind of ugly when it comes out of the oven, but smushing it down works. Will make again.

My rating is solely for the 'cake' part of the eclair as I used 'Pastry Cream' for the filling (recipe from this site), melted chocolate + butter + wee bit milk for the chocolate syrup (to spread over the crust before the pastry cream) and whipped topping for the top. The reason I've give this only four stars is because I found 2 eggs a bit much (I made half the quantity). To me, 1 egg seemed quite sufficient and ofcourse a less-fattening option. Since this was half the quantity, I baked this for approx 17-20 minutes. Next time I make this, I will pipe them onto a cookie sheet to make individual eclairs. Thank you Buchko! And thank you reviewers for all your comments! :)

Made with all low fat ingredients (smart balance, fat free whipped topping, lowfat choc sauce and sugar free, fat free jello pudding) and was a huge hit at a fish fry we went to.  I will make this again and again...

It's sooo easy! I made half of the recipe in a large pie plate and it fit perfectly.  Nice dessert to serve at a small party. The only thing I did not have chocolate syrup, so I microwaved semi sweet chocolate chips with butter and spread that on the pie shell.  The texture is different because the chocolate hardens a bit after assembling the pie.  I will use the pie crust recipe again and alter the fillings for fun.

Great recipe! I made this in a 9" spring form pan. Came out easily and made for a nice presentation. I followed the suggestions of others reviewers regarding the chocolate over the crust. If you are looking for a different dessert this is it. Rave reviews!

I had the clumping problem, too.  The flavor was good but I hardly tasted the cream cheese. I did what other reviewers recommended and used the icing from Eclairs II and used it on top of the cream puff dough before adding the filling, and that was really good. I just did a small dollop of frozen topping instead of spreading it around, as that stuff is just too sweet for me.  The cream puff dough is a classic recipe and that was perfect. I need to tinker with this more to suit my taste, but thank you for the recipe, Buchko.

This is really good.  The base did puff up but after it had cooled a bit I was able to push them down a it.  I did think that it had about 1/3 too much pudding filling.  Next time I'll cut that down a bit.  I also added a thin layer of caramel on top of the base, then drizzled a little chocolate sauce on that, then put the pudding and whipped cream over that.  I think it helped keep the base from getting soggy (I was a little concerned about that).  Everyone in my house loved this.

My oldest saw this recipe and requested it for his birthday. It turned out to be such a hit. There wasn't a single piece left and all the guest have already pre-ordered it for *their* birthdays. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, 1% milk and Lite Cool Whip. It was still very rich and full of flavor. I think the full-fat ingredients would possibly be even too heavy. Thank you for the awesome recipe!!

This was a lot easier to make than what I thought it would be.  And it was DELICIOUS!  I used french vanilla pudding and drizzled hot fudge sauce and caramel sauce over the whipped cream layer, then took a toothpick and dragged it through to make a pretty design. Everyone loved it!!  Will be making again soon.

This was delicious. As suggested by another reviewer I put a layer of chocolate on the pastry before adding the pudding and it was perfect.  I messed up and had to do a combination of vanilla pudding and banana creme pudding. (yummy mistake ) Took it to a potluck and it held up well on the table.  Many compliments on it. Thanks for making me look good.

What a novel idea!  I halved the recipe and prepared it in a round cake pan.  I found the dough for the crust was hard to spread -- I had to work it for several minutes with my fingers.  I assume this is a traditional cream puff dough, but it's probably not so difficult to deal with if you're actually making cream puffs with it and not using it to make the crust of a cake.  Instead of using chocolate syrup, I melted real chocolate and drizzled it over the cake.  The recipe does not state that it needs to be refrigerated to set up; however, I would recommend chilling for a while before slicing.  I cut mine up right away and the filling was not set.  Overall, though, yummy, tasty cake.  I think it would be a nice WOW dessert to serve to guests.

Super easy to throw together.  I made this for people at church and they really liked it.  The only thing is that my pan started overflowing.  I only put 8 oz. of cool whip on top instead of 12 and that was plenty.  Instead of hershey's syrup, I bought a can of choc. frosting.  Following another reviewer, I spread a layer of it on the cake before adding the pudding mix.  Then I heated up some of it to drizzle over top.  I thin it needs the extra chocolate to be like an eclair.

Delicious! Very light dessert.  I followed other reviewers advice and made the chocolate sauce from the eclair ii recipe on this site. Also put a layer of chocolate sauce on pastry before pudding layer.  Make sure to beat cream cheese with 1 pkg of pudding and slowly add milk to avoid lumps.  Definitely a keeper!

I thought there was too much pudding mixture and didn't use it all, it didn't firm up very well. Don't put chocolate on til last because it gets watery.

Yummy.  Definitely use the Eclairs II icing, it gives it that little chocolate boost.  A bit messy, I'll try the pie pan version next time.

Oh so good.  I read other reviews and combined many of the suggestions:  Yes, the crust bubbles when you cook it.  Just press down with a spatula while cooking. I may add sugar next time to sweeten the crust a bit. I used French vanilla pudding and that made it tastier!  The cream cheese never fully blended in the pudding mix, but it really doesn't hurt the taste or presentation. I may even add more cream cheese next time. Before I put in pudding mix, I also added Smucker's hot chocolate fudge on top of crust (the kind you put on ice cream). Added chocolate syrup and chocolate shavings on top. I almost left this pie (more of a pie to me than a cake)at home because the crust looked odd and the cream cheese issue, but I brought it and apologized that it was a first try. The family ate it up on T-day and wanted more! It was oh so good and pretty easy to make.

It was a good dessert, but mainly the creamy part. The "crust" part was too eggy and soggy for me - however, my fiance liked it. I might try it again some time, but with one less egg.

This was awesome!!  I cut the recipe in half and used an 8x8 pan.  I also melted ghirardelli chocolate chips and butter and put it on the cake, as others recommended, before adding the pudding mix.... sooo good!  My friends ate every drop!

This is my all time favorite dessert recipe. When we hold potluck at work my coworkers beg for this dessert and copies of the recipe.  I have found that if you want to avoid lumps, make sure the cream cheese is at room temperature.

I had this recipie at work one day, and did not care for the filling. I do not like boxed puddings. So I made my own version, Coconut Cream-Cream Puff Cake.
I made homeade Coconut Cream Vanilla Pudding, (the recipie I use for Coconut Cream Pie, and then put meringue on top instead of whipped cream. It was absolutely wonderful.

So yummy.  I also call it "Moon Cake". I think hot fudge tastes much better than Hersey's syrup.  I leave out the cream cheese because I never can get out all the clumps! Try it, you'll love it, and so will your guests!

This recipe is great. I was worried that the  crust wouldn't turn out, but I think it must be fool proof!!  I made the recipe sugar free by using sugar free pudding, sugar free cool whip and sugar free chocolate syrup.  It was a hit!!

Like everyone else said, this was great!  Really rich and different from the usual.  My husband liked the change of pace.  I didn't hsve cool whip so I made whipped cream with 1 c heavy whipping cream, 1/4c sugar and 1t vanilla.  It was really good.

My grandmom makes this quite often and I couldn't read the writing on the recipe card she gave me. I came looking for it here and it's the same recipe! This is a classic around the house and very light and delicious. It's also great with a few strawberries thrown on top.

Oh boy. Yummy! I cut the recipe in half and made it in a 9 inch glass pie pan and cooked it for twenty minutes (thanks to the reviewer who suggested that). I also made the glaze from eclairs II (from this site) and put it on the bottom. Next time I would just use chocolate syrup like the submitter suggests. This was very, very good. I will definitely make it again.

This dessert was fabulous!  Next time I will soften the cream cheese longer to avoid the lumps.  It makes alot of filling, so I reserved a cup or so and served it to my kids as pudding-they loved it!  Also, I recommend using the chocolate topping from Eclairs II(that topping makes a yummy dip for strawberries too)...It makes a perfect cream puff/eclair dessert!!

I have been making this recipe for years.  I also found that there was too much of the cream mixture, but, it is too good to cut in half.  Instead, I double the puff mixture.  You may need to cook the puff mixture a little bit longer.  I also drizzel chocolate Magic Shell on the top instead of syrup.

Thank you! This was AWSOME! I made this for my daughter's 12th Birthday cake,and everyone really enjoyed it! The only thing I would do different is let the cream cheese get to room tempature before mixing. Other than that it was GREAT!

WOW!This was really good. The crust is so tender. I also had a problem with my cream cheese/milk mixture.  Next time I will beat the cream cheese alone for a min. or so, then add the milk. Thanks for the yummy recipe!

ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!  I like others suggested, used a can of chocolate frosting on the cooled crust, then proceeded with the rest.  I didn't even need the chocolate syrup.  We used this for my Mom's 67th birthday because she loves Cream Puffs.  It tasked like a combo of an eclair and a cream puff.  You have to try this!!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Hi Therese!

If your a cream puff fan, you'll love this cake! It was delicious. My only problem was the chocolate on top ran. I used the squeeze bottle chocolate syrup which I guess was too thin. Next time, I'll either omit it, or find a thicker chocolate to use. This recipe is a keeper!

How AWESOME this recipe is!!!!  Yum!  I made it for a church social, and it was the first to go!  Kids and grown-ups alike liked it.  I can't wait to try variations... (strawberry/banana?  chocolate pudding? coconut creme?).  EVERYONE who tried it asked for the recipe.  Thank you, thank you!

This is always a hit at family get togethers. It kind of seems like an over the top dessert, it is! The changes I made were to use the chocolate glazing recipe from Eclairs II on this website and use it liberally!

This recipe was SO GOOD!!!  My whole family loved it and it was so rich!  The only thing is, I don't know how to blend the cream cheese into the milk, and I ended up with small chunks of it in the filling.  It wasn't bad, and the texture it gave was actually nice, but could someone help me with that?  Anyway, this is a superb recipe and I can't wait to make it again!

Made this for a family dinner tonight.  Used the bakery cream recipe from this site instead of the pudding mixture as the filling- if you bake you will have the ingredients in your pantry, and use less artificial ingredients!!  Also used real whipped cream instead of frozen whipped topping, and hot fudge sauce as the chocolate topping.  It was wonderful!  I made the pastry in the 13x9 pan as directed and it came out beautiful, will be making this many more times!

This is my husband's favorite dessert! I confess it is AWESOME! I make my own pastry cream (using 4 1/2 c. milk) and whipped cream and I melt some milk chocolate chips with butter & cream for a layer under the filling and drizzled on top of the whipped cream. I've made this many times. It's always a hit wherever I take it.

I used coconut pudding because I'm not wild about the medicinal taste of vanilla. With coconut pudding and the Eclair II frosting, it was DELICIOUS!

Delectable! 
Very easy.  I did take some advice from other reviewers and made the eclair II icing and put some in the botton of the shell prior to adding the filling.  Also, made the filling with whipping cream and only 1/2 of the cream cheese. Also, I made a top layer of crust.  Super easy and liked by all.

Very good pastry recipe, at first I had the heat too high and I cooked the dough too fast in the pot, so I remade and was delighted with how fluffy the dough was! I also didnt have pudding mix, so I creamed the cream cheese with about a cup and a half of sugar in a saucepan, added in 3 tablespoons vanilla and a quarter cup of flour, then I added the milk gradualy, after bringing it to a boil I added one egg white and stirred until it was thick enough to my liking (a bit thicker than regular pudding) It was amazing :) also used a little homemade chocoalte syrup on top instead of store bought!

wonderful!!!  Must add chocolate eclair icing to the bottom before the cream cheese/pudding layer and add to the top of whipped topping.  It is soooooooo much better than using bought chocolate syrup.

I thought this was pretty good but definitely beat the milk slowly into the cream cheese and make the cream cheese fluffy first.....might cut down on the pudding mixture and use less pudding,maybe 2 pkgs and less milk...otherwise very good.

My sister in law makes a cake similar to this one. For less messy eating and awesome presentation, she makes two shells and sandwiches the filling between the shells. It's great. She sprinkles some confectioner's sugar on the top shell.

I made the filling by itself and froze several bags of it. I use it to fill crepes and plain cream puffs. It's good to have this on store for emergencies!

I was very skeptical of this crust, but mine turned out perfect.  I made the filling by whipping the cream cheese well first and then alternating the pudding powder and the milk.  This was quite a lot of filling, next time I might scale the pudding and milk back for 2 pkgs, instead of 3.  I used real whipped cream on top also.  This was great and the leftovers were good as well, although not quite as nice as the first day.  This would be great for a crowd as there really are 8-12 generous servings.  Very yummy and impressive!!

I was feeling lazy and decided to use a golden cake mix for the bottom instead of making the choux pastry. I only poured about 3/4 of the mix in the pan and made 8 cupcakes with the remainder. Everything else I kept the same. My family loved it!

Pretty good!  Made this for a church function & didn't have any leftover.  Next time I think I would prefer a little less filling, but that is just a personal taste.  The only change I made to this was that I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla to the pudding/milk mixture because I wanted to really punch up that flavor.  I beat the cream cheese until it was smooth & then (per other reviews) slowly added in the milk; turned out great with no lumps.

We must be the lone dissenters in recipe land.  This was OK.  I felt the pudding filling was VERY bland.  I think it needed some vanilla and maybe some sugar.  The dough was not sweet and neither was the filling. We didn't sweeten the home made whip creme that much because we thought the filling would be sweet.  This was just OK for us.

This recipe is DELICIOUS. I had some guests come over and they LOVED It. It is quick and very easy to make. :0) I agree with what others have said, if you mix a little milk in with the cream cheese rather than the entire 4 cups, you won't have any lumps!:0)  Thank you for the wonderful recipe

Followed the recipe for the crust exactly but it tasted very eggy. Maybe it was because I used fresh eggs? (we have a farm- if you've never had eggs that weren't purchased as a grocery store you don't know how different they are!) Also didn't puff up as much as I hoped it would.

Fabulous! Really good. It was literally devoured by all! I made sure I cooked the "crust" till really nice and brown. This made it quite firm texture and not wet inside. My friends were still talking about today (5 days later) I loved all the credit!

wow what an easy recipe and what a huge hit!  I followed the instructions and the only mystery was my pie shell got really really tall.....Not sure if this is normal...but it worked out well since it created a bowl effect and gave lots of room for the goodies

So yummy! It was very easy to put together and tasted great. I made a couple of changes- I halved the recipe and made it in a pie plate and it turned out great. Also, I spread hot fudge on top of the crust before I put the pudding mix on, just to add a bit of chocolate and I actually wish I would have put a bit more on- it definitely adds. Finally, I don't particularly like Cool Whip so I used real whipped cream with just a bit of powdered sugar. It was SO tasty and took hardly any extra effort. I will be making this again.

Really a must try, if even just for the novelty or ease of making cream puffs/eclairs for a crowd.  I used a basic pastry cream ("Pastry Cream" on this site, by Kevin Ryan) and chocolate glaze, topped by whipped cream for an over the top birthday "eclair cake." Delicious.

A-Mazing!! I added a layer of chocolate fudge frosting before putting in the filling and it made it even tastier! This is a great pot luck recipe - I always get asked for copies when I make it!

WOW! One of the best desserts I've ever made! I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great. Some people mentioned adding a chocolate layer for interest, but I don't think it needed it at all. I might play around with it next time, just for fun. Use chocolate pudding, or put sliced strawberries on top. Also, using low fat cream cheese and cool whip would make it healthier, but I don't think it would detract from the flavor at all. Little tip: this kind of crust does not keep very well, so I wouldn't make this dessert more than a couple hours before eating it. Enjoy!

I took this to a barbecue and it was a huge hit!!!  Very good!  I liked how easy it was to make and it tasted like a cream puff.  Next time I will skip the cool whip and use homemade whipped cream for an even more authentic cream puff taste.

This was way good. I halved the serving size and then I used heavy cream instead of milk (only because I had very little milk and had to save it for cereal the next morning) anyway, it was SO rich!!  It was pretty awesome.  I also took the advice of others and added chocolate layer to the middle.  It was superb!!

Make it sugar free !  I've been making this for years, and have found if you use sugar free pudding and sugar free cool whip it is just as yummy.

Amazingly wonderful! I followed the tip of adding a little hot fudge sauce to the shell before filling with the cream mixture. So easy, ans it looks very impressive.  I also made it in two pie plates, and it turned out looking exactly like the photo! E X C E L L E N T !

This was AWESOME!  I made it for Valentine's Day and it worked SO well.  I used some melted chocolate between the puff and pudding layers.  Next time I am going to use chocolate pudding...and a little less of it.  I like the pictures of it in the pie dishes too.  I think I'll also do that next time.  Thanks for this recipe!

A bit too soggy to me - and I was expecting more of an eclair type of flavor/consistency. I did put the chocolate on top of the puff as other suggested and it still just didn't do it for me....

This is a fantastic recipe.  Everyone loved it and it really does taste like a cream puff. I sprinkled milk chocolate chips over the crust when it came out of the oven and let a chocolate layer form and then put the remaining layers over the chocolate.  It made it taste really good and the hard layer of the chocolate added a new dimension of delicious!

I got mixed reviews when I made this for Christmas.  My sister-in-law said that it tasted like a donut (which it did) and my brother gave it 3 stars (but he doesn't like pudding, so his vote doesn't count).  I would say that it was 'ok', but nothing that I would crave to make again.  I found that the cream puff bottom stuck to the bottom of the pan, so if I made this again I would spray the pan.  This was good and the kids liked it, but I don't think that it was great.

This is an outstanding recipe.  When I make it, however, I mix together the pudding and the cream cheese, then add one cup of milk, mixing it well, then another cup of milk, etc., until all four cups are added. That way, it gives for a creamier pudding (eg, less/no lumps).

I made this for 8 Firefighters and they LOVED it. My Firefighter son asked if I could make this for his upcoming birthday.  

Interesting that as we read through the reviews, most of us have gotten away from a true Cream Puff and created an Eclair-like recipe instead.  I did the same, adding 1/2 package of melted milk-chocolate chips on top of the pastry before adding the pudding mixture.  Then I used chocolate shell topping over real whipped cream.  I think next time I'll try chocolate pudding instead of vanilla, as I think that would be even better!  (I've only given it four stars instead of five because I made it as an Eclair and not a Cream Puff.)

I have this same recipe from my mother and it is ALWAYS a hit with our family. My son requests this dessert every chance he can. Instead of cool whip we use whipped heavy cream. My mother is European and hates Cool Whip so we substitute.

This turned out very pretty.  But the cream was a bit lumpy, as others mentioned.  I used the chocolate shell recipe from this site in between the crust and the cream...yum!  Everyone seemed to think it was delicious...the lumps just bugged me.

I made this for a church get together and it was a huge hit! Everyone loved it. It's a great dessert because there really isn't anything like it. I will definitely make this again and again!! Oh, I did add the chocolate frosting on the bottom (on top of the puff before the filling) from the Eclair recipe on this site, as other reviewers stated. I thought that it was just right. Yummy recipe!!!

This cake was very tasty.  The only changes I made was the use of cheesecake-flavored pudding instead of vanilla, and the addition of the Eclair chocolate per other reviewers' suggestions.  The reason I gave it four stars was I found it a bit difficult to remove from the pan, and shortly after making it, the bottom was somewhat soggy.

Great, different cake.  I used to round pans.  My pudding was lumpy because I used the mixer to blend the cream cheese and milk!  Bad idea.  Be careful of that part.  Lumps don't come out!  Tasty recipe.

Very tasty.  The only thing I'd change is the amount of pudding mixture in the center...it needs either less pudding or another layer of the pastry to enclose it.  I think I'll try making it in 2 smaller pans next time like another reviewer suggested.  My kids loved this cake.

Oh my goodness, this was wonderful. I love this cake, and I make it for lots of people. the only thing I had trouble with was spreading the puff stuff in the casserole dish - I suggest you try using some wax paper and your hands to spread it. thank you so much, rave reviews whenever I make it! cara

Awesome recipe! Couldn't believe how easy it was to make. I didn't add the whipped topping, I decided to sprinkle the whole thing with powdered sugar.  Everyone loved it!

This was delicious! Kids especially enjoyed it. I had small lumps in the cream cheese/milk mixture. Probably due to the cream cheese being at room temperature, but the milk being very cold. It looked like bits of cottage cheese mixed with the pudding! Oh well, I will make it again and try to have both at the same temperature so they combine smoothly. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe has intrigued, but intimidated me, but I finally tried it.  Loved it!!  Read lots of reviews and incorporated the following:  springform pan, 1 c. extra whipping cream/milk for pudding, melted chocolate chips w/butter UNDER pudding to prevent sogginess, and real whipping cream (about 1.5 c.) for topping.  It was beautiful and super yummy and got rave reviews!  Made it the day before, except added the whipped cream topping before serving.  The only problem I had was from not removing the pastry from the spring form base - and it was a little sticky when I served it.  Maybe a light spray of Pam before cooking?

I did the puff in a spring form and it turned out beautiful.  Filling was good also, but I thought a bit heavy with the cream cheese.  I put banana over the puff and then the filling and then whip cream.  I decorated the top with banana also.

Easy, and simple. Make sure you let things cool before the next step. If you make this to take to an event, make two. One to take, one for home. Don't depend on any you take coming back home...

DELICIOUS
I used a 10" springform pan instead of a 9x13" pan.  I also softened the cream cheese a little more than room temperature (in the microwave for 10 seconds) and it seemed to work pretty well.   Because I am on a lower carb diet, for the filling I used 2 Cups heavy whipping cream, 1 Cup of half and half and 1 Cup + 1 TBSP 2% milk.  I also used sugar free vanilla jello instant pudding.  I made this for a work potluck and NO ONE could tell the difference.  I will definitely make it again!

This was fabulous!  Made it for a birthday party and everyone was raving!  I did take some tips from other reviewers, baked in two 9 inch pie plates, and put one in the freezer.  I halved the pudding recipe and added a splash of vanilla.  For topping, I made 1 cup of whip cream and sweetened with a little icing sugar and vanilla.  Instead of chocolate topping, I garnished with fresh strawberries.  Next time I think I will try sliced banana on the shell before adding the pudding.  Thanks for a delicious, easy dessert!

This recipe got a huge thumbs up from my coworkers. I tried to make this as close as written, but I didn’t have enough pudding mix, I only had the large box of vanilla pudding, so I added that to the whipped up cream cheese and then added 3 cups of milk slowly. So much easier to make then cream puffs!

Question:  I usually use my food processor instead of the beaters to get a smooth cheese/cheesecake filling
Do you think that would work?   
It's a great recipe!

It wasn't great. It wasn't bad. I put a layer of chocolate between the the crust and pudding (as suggested by others). The crust was very sturdy. It wasn't tough...it held together and would have been difficult to get through with a plastic fork.

I followed the recipe exactly for a neighborhood block party.  It was a huge success. Everybody loved the creamy filling and the cream puff crust was perfect. This is a very easy dessert, looks fabulous, and tastes just like a cream puff.  I also slowly added the milk to the cream cheese. No lumps.

I  wasn't sure of the exact pan size to use.  I know it said 9x13, but there is a big difference between a glass one where the long end has an upward curve, or a ceramic one with straight sides.  Was making for a church supper and started with the ceramic, but wasn't happy  because I it didn't come up the sides as the recipe indicated.  So, I made another one in my glass one.  That one scared me because it looked like there wouldn't be enough room for anything else after it puffed up like crazy from cooking!!  Everyone raved about it, but I noticed not all ate the bottom crust (think it was a little too thick).  If I were to make it again, I think I would use my glass dish, and reduce it to 3 eggs  (and reduce butter, water & flour accordinly).  I also used another reviewer's suggestion and put (canned) chocolate icing between the crust and pudding.  Not a good idea - it wanted to slip off when plating.  Wasn't till later I read not to use canned.  Live and learn!  Also slowly incorporated the milk w/the cream cheese & had no problem.  Overall, I was happy with the end results of both.  Sure I will make again

Gluten free and fabulous dessert! I am an avid all recipe user and this is my first review if that gives you any hint of how awesome this recipe turned out. When making the dough, I substituted regular flour for GF Cup4Cup. The end product was outstanding and my non gluten free extended family raved over it, even returning for seconds of this rather than the homemade cheesecake. One hint that I learned in a similar recipe: after you take the soft ball dough off stovetop, place dough in mixer and mix until you no longer see steam (approx. 3 minutes). Your dough will then be cool enough for the eggs.  In addition, I read many reviews and incorporated several of the good suggestions including: 1. I halved the recipe and baked it in a 9 inch springform pan, baking for 20-25 minutes. 2.  I used the eclair II chocolate recipe as a layer over the puff as well as to drizzle on top.  3. I mixed the room temp cream cheese first,  then mixed in a cup of milk until foamy... etc. pudding was nice and smooth. 4.  I made my own whipped cream using 1c. whipping cream, 2 Tbsp. granulated sugar, and 1 tsp. vanilla. My sister, who has been gluten free for over 6 years, mentioned a few weeks ago that cream puffs were the one gluten item that she missed terribly. She was speechless when she had her first bite, literally bringing a tear to her eye. Thanks everyone for this recipe and wonderfully helpful reviews.

Been making this recipe for years and it never fails to delight guests! I definitely love it most with a layer of hot fudge topping between the crust and pudding layer. It looks beautiful and people always want to know who brought it! No leftovers!

I liked the idea of a spring pan so used my largest one...about 10".  If you do so, push the crust dough higher on the sides.  That way when it puffs it will create a cupped crust and hold the filling better.  Makes a pretty presentation.

I loved this. definitely don't forget the chocolate syrup. total makes it.  i cooled the custard completely before adding it to the cool  crust and don't forget to cook the custard as the pudding mix suggest before you cool it.

This is a great recipe.  I have done both the vanilla and chocolate pudding (my favorite).  When blending the cream cheese blend it with the milk slowly.  I usually drizzle it with caramel and warmed hot fudge topping.  Everyone ask for the recipe and this is the dessert my husband will ask for on holidays and his birthday.

I've made this in a springform pan, and it rose soooo high!!!  Very impressive desert, and appears to be a ton of work, but it's simple, and it's AMAZING!!!  I've had to make it a LOT, as the more people who try it, the more orders I get...I don't know ANYONE who doesn't LOVE it!!!  I followed this re I've, without making any changes ~

This was good. I took the advice of others and blended a bit of milk with the cheese to get it creamy. I only used 2 boxes of pudding and less milk. I also spread a layer of the eclair icing mentioned by others below the pudding mixture. Boy was that good. I made the crust as written  it didn't taste too eggy.  It tasted like a cream puff.

So good! And easy! I followed the recipe except I just added some melted chocolate chips before I poured on the pudding mixture. I took this to Sunday dinner with my family, and while we adults were still eating our first helping, my 2 year old niece (with chocolate all over her face) held out her bowl and said "MORE!" That pretty much summed up the rest of us too.

what a fun, easy dessert!  really does taste like a super-sized cream puff.  the (spreadable) dough does puff up, including in the middle, but once completely cool, the middle flattens enough for the filling. we subbed 1 lemon pudding for vanilla- really good w/hint of lemon. baked on silicon mat, as it does stick alittle. adults and kids will love it!

This was wonderful - easy & impressive to others!! It's the same recipe I use when I make eclairs - just done in a different and easier way...LOVE IT!!! I used white chocolate and french vanilla pudding - all half & half - "Easy Chocolate Bundt Cake Glaze" on this site which happens to be the BEST and easiest chocolate anywhere! Made these for the Christmas party at work - will also make them for my families. Thanks so much for such a great idea.

I couldn't be happier!!!  This is fantastic!!!  I thank the reviewer who explained mixing the cream cheese with just a small amount of milk will prevent lumps.  This is my FAVORITE dessert now.  Easy to make.  Sooooo yummy!!!  It also travels well in the car.

it's a great recipe. But I think if people are going to post recipes on here they need to be very detailed. I ended up with lumpy pudding mixture because I did not know to add a little bit of milk with the cream cheese at a time. I should have just read the reviews first. Because other people have added that in the review to let us know that important detail.

I actually just used the cream filling for a recipe i needed help with, boston cream pie/cake.  I ended up making a 9 inch yellow cake cutting into half horizontally. I made a nine inch cake thin mocha chocolate layer and the chocolate glaze from the actual recipe. Made an awesome and tasty layered cake

A must try. I too had lumps with the cream cheese, even after letting it get to room temp.  I think next time, I will buy the whipped kind in the tub and use that. Even after beating it for an eternity, it was still a little lumpy.  However, when I presented the finished product to my guests, no lumps appeared.  Magic? I dunno, but this is the first dessert I have ever made where every single guest asked for a second helping. Hand down, just plain awesome!

This recipe was delicious! My family absolutely loved it!! I only made one change to the whole recipe. Instead of using 3 packages of vanilla, I used two vanilla and 1 chocolate. This tasted exactly like a cream puff. The cream cheese was a little difficult to mix with the milk, but you couldn't really tell after it was finished. Great recipe and will make again!!

So yummy! And surprisingly simple. I make mine in two glass pie plates, spread hot fudge on the bottom of the crust, add a little vanilla to the pudding, and sprinkle shaved chocolate on top of the whipped topping.

My mother-in-law makes this cake, and passed the recipe to me. It is absolutely one of my all-time favorite desserts! After reading some reviews here, I think I might have to try putting chocolate in between the "puff" and "cream" layers- sounds like a good addition!

Such a crowd-pleasing dessert and so easy. I also added melted chocolate chips to the top of the base and used the icing from Eclairs II for the top -- which I think is KEY! Herhsey's syrup wouldn't do it justice, however the eclairs icing does not spread well, so it's difficult to make it pretty. Made it for a Labor Day picnic and will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious!  My hubby (who is not a sweet eater at all) ate 2 large pieces yesterday.  I added a layer of Hershey's hot fudge sauce to the cooled pastry.  I'll be making this often.

Excellent and surprisingly easy.  I used hot fudge sauce over the baked layer but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  Makes a ton--I will cut the recipe in half the next time I make it.

I altered only the amount of vanilla pudding (used a large box instead of three small ones). The pastry is AWESOME!

Very yummy!!! I followed a couple suggestions --> used less eggs.  I really liked the "crust" would maybe double next time because it makes a ton of filling.  Will make again!

This is THE BEST.  I sent my husband to the store for the ingredience for this and he brough back 2 vanilla puddings and one banana.  It lasted about 2 hours with 4 people in the house.  it was sooo good.  I am making another one tonight.  Hopefully it will last a little longer :)

OMG!!! This is one of the best dessert I have ever made. I followed other reviews and added the chocolate layer. I was gonna try the eclair II redipe like everyone said but ended up not having the stuff. I did 2c choc chips 1/2c evaporated milk, 1/2c butter... aka fudge! We ate it without refridgerating it was excellent can't wait until it sets! FYI the pastry part REALLY PUFFS!

I make this cake all the time and it's fabulous.  I have made it with vanilla, french vanilla, and banana pudding and they are all good.  The banana is my favorite.

Made the cake with the layer of chocolate from the eclair II recipe using Milk Chocolate Chips instead of the semi sweet chips.  Everyone loved the cake.  It tasted just like a cream puff!  Will make it again and again!

My Grandma makes this exact recipe at least once a year and my entire family loves it.  I have made it a couple of times for gatherings and it is always a hit.  I have never tried it with the extra chocolate or any other variations.  I will say that for anyone like my Grandma whose hands can't handle making true cream puffs any more, this is a great alternative!

awesome!! i just made this for the first time the other day for a ladies' meeting.  got RAVE reviews.  it's hard to stay out of the little bit that was leftover.  i did follow some of the tips that some other reviewers had given (especially blending the cream cheese and milk - gradually).  i also put a chocolate frosting over the pastry layer.  makes a nice little addition.  very very good.  can't wait to find another excuse to "have" to make this!!!  :-)

Great recipe!  I've made this a few times now.  I've finally figured out how we like it best.  First, I do add whipped chocolate frosting to the puff before adding the filling.  Great touch!  What I've found that has made the biggest difference is using Cook and Serve pudding.  I've never cared for instant pudding in anything.  I cook the pudding with the 4 cups of milk in a saucepan until boiling.  I remove from heat, then add 8oz of WHIPPED cream cheese.  It melts right in to the hot pudding (no lumps)for a smooth, rich texture.  It's perfect!  It cools while the puff is cooling. Even though it takes longer to make, I think it's totally worth it!

The recipe was great!  Next time I will try a bit less pudding filling in mine because I like the "crust" with a little bit of filling.  Everyone I made it for liked it a lot!

Just watch this disappear.  Don't think there'll be a piece left for you the next day.  The next time I make it, I'm going to melt about 1/2 cup of peanut butter in the chocolate syrup for a more fudgey taste.

I've made this twice and it's always a hit. The first cake was drizzled with chocolate and the second was toped with fresh strawberries. A friend requested I make it for an upcoming baby shower. I think this time I will top with strawberries then drizzle with chocolate. Thank for sharing this easy recipe that has a big WOW!! factor.

This is such a delicious and easy dessert! My dad used to make this when I was a kid and I was so happy to come across the recipe on here! It is even better than I remember it! I took the advise of some other bakers and spread some chocolate on before the pudding - I used ganache. It really did make a difference! I served this to friends and handed out several copies of the recipe.

This was really good.  We can't quit eating it!  The time to cook was less than what the recipe indicated.  The dough part cooked in 23 minutes.  Just watch it carefully and remove when it's puffed and slightly golden brown.  This recipe is a keeper!

The only teeny critque I'd have is that the crust stuck to the pan somewhat.  But I added some chocolate frosting on top of the crust and then layered it with the pudding as some had recommended.  That pudding mixture is SO good!  Everyone loved it! 5 starts

These were so good. I cheated and used Grand's Bicuit as my crust.  I used my rolling pin and flattened biscuits out to a 9x13 pan then followed the filling directions to a T.... My family loved these and all of them thought they tasted like Long John Doughnuts...Excellent recipe thank you for sharing..

This recipe is amazing - never knew cream puffs were so easy to make.  The dough turned out without a hitch - however, I didn't have the right size pan, so I just made couronnes (got the idea from a french cookbook) and then stuffed them with the filling (cut across and add filling).  Oh, and my filling ended up having these tiny little lumps in it - maybe my cream cheese was cold, but it was delicious anyway.  Update:  I found that there was too much filling for the amount of pastry, but that is purely a personal preference.

The only reason I gave 4 stars to that recipe is because I didn't like the bottom part.It was dry.The filling was excellent,though.

I made this to take for our Easter dessert today and it was a hit!!  Not heavy and a nice light dessert to have after a big meal!  Have only three pieces left out of the pan and that will probably be gone before tomorrow!  I made my puff shell last night and than made the filling this morning.  Use room temperature cream cheese and slowly add the first cup of milk with the mixer going.  You may still have a few small lumps, but nobody is picking over their piece to find them, they are too busy eating this delicious dessert!!  Thanks for sharing!!  YUMMY!!!!!

Thank You For Posting This!!!! OMG it saved me. I have made this before using another recipe. Sometimes it turned out and other times it didn't.(The pastry shell). Well I thought I'd make this for my dad's birthday tomorrow. I have found it tastes better made the day before. 
In my recipe when you were cooking the flour mixture you added the eggs and cooked.Also greased the pan. Well in the oven it started to puff up in just one spot then fell and it was all flat when done. So I went to this site and found this recipe. It's in the oven as I type. It is all puffed up. Yippie.
I have never put a chocolate layer before the pudding. But I an planning to now. I have always put the Magic Shell on top and we've like it. I will add this to the middle too.  Thanks again

I did make changes to give this a 5.  I think it's WONDERFUL as a pie rather than a cake. (It makes 2 pie shells) I've renamed it Eclair Pie.  I did as others did and used the chocolate from the "Eclairs II" recipe and spread it on the crust of the pie.  Don't forget to make sure all the lumps are out of the cream cheese and only add a little milk before adding the rest.  I totally omitted the whipped cream only because I'm not too fond of it.  Deliciously creamy Eclair Pie!

This is good!  I really like the edge & corner pieces of the cake, the middle pieces seem too creamy.  But it's all good!  Definetly do the chocolate syrup on top that really makes this dish for me.

Just baked this today for my boyfriend's birthday and so far, so good! We're going out to dinner now but he's already looking forward to returning so he can eat the cake. Update: We loved this dessert! I just finished the last two pieces and am looking forward to making it again.

this was a big hit at my work, my only problem was my crust was a little tough? Don't know if that's just the nature of the pastry or if i did something wrong, but still very delicious!

Awesome! Tastes just like an eclair, but easier to make.  I'll use real whipping cream instead of cool whip next time, and try it with hot fudge instead of Hersheys syrup.

i love cream puffs, so i had to try this.  i was expecting the crust to be flakier, but mine was sort of chewy, but the flavor was very good. i took advice from other reviewers and added a layer of nutella between the puff layer and the pudding, and i used cool whip on top.  it was perfect!  i can't wait to make this for company!

It didn't have the success I expected reading the great reviews. Almost nobody took a second part which is very unusual among our group of friends. I thought personnaly that there was way too much pudding mixture and that's all you could taste. I would recommend cutting the amount by at least a third. I used whipped cream instead of coolwhip. I put somme chocolate sauce on the crust as suggested by others but I think it would be as good without it.

I love this recipe. The only variation I made was to heat a few blocks of baking chocolate, powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla on the stove and pour that over the puff part before the cream cheese filling goes over it. I highly recommend this recipe!

This was good but not good enough to make again (so many other recipes to try).  I made two packets of Dream Whip instead of Cool Whip because I just like it better.  I was a little disappointed I couldn't taste the cream cheese and I used one cream cheese flavored Jell-o (even though I know there's no cream cheese in cream puffs).

Yum, yum, YUM!!! I am making tomorrow (4th time!), and will try chocolate pudding mix in the filling topped with Cool Whip. I've found that we don't care too much for the chocolate syrup. The cream cheese adds a great richness!

This was great.  I made A LOT of changes though.  The bottom crust remained the same.  For the filling I added 2 packages of cream cheese, vanilla and 2 small boxes of vanilla pudding with 3 cups of milk.  Before adding the filling to the crust I made the chocolate glaze from the Eclairs II recipe.  Finally, I did not add the cool whip at all, but served a dallop on individual servings (for those who wanted it).  Everyone came back for seconds!!

I definately give this recipe a thumbs up. Quick, easy and delicious. Without a doubt a five star recipe. I made this recipe using sugar free pudding (white chocolate), skim milk and low fat cream cheese and it still had a great taste without all the calories.

This is THE best. I took it to a dinner party and everyone was raving. This is not a "heavy" dessert. I was a little scared when I took the cream puff out of the oven because it was so big. How was I going to fit all the ingredients into the shell? It did work however and I have a great recipe I'll make many times again.

Very easy and very yummy...the kids really enjoyed this recipe.  Just be careful when baking bottom crust.  I didn't get mine perfectly even and it bubbled like a cream puff does making the crust very uneven.  The pudding mixtured covered that up thought....delicious!

Loved this!  I was scared to make it as I've never made cream puffs before but it worked great.  I followed the recipe exactly, next time I will use 8oz. whipped topping and chocolate frosting instead of syrup.  Great recipe, thanks!

I was in charge of the dessert for Easter this year. I made this cake and everyone just sat and made mmm and oh's for about a minute after the first bite. Needless to say it was a huge hit. Very easy to make and my Mother-in-law took the recipe to work and bragged. What better gratification than a bragging Mother-in law.

I used low-fat cream cheese, skim milk, lite cool whip and then topped it with fresh strawberries and a bit of Hershey syrup and got raving reviews and requests for more! Fabulous recipe. Heard about it on my country/western radio station :-)!

Enjoyed this very much, wasn't too sweet and was refreshing, and best of all, it wasn't too taxing on the cook!  Would definitely try this again.
