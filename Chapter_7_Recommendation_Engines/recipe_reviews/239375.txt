Home Grown Zucchini & Tomato Cheddar Bake Haiku: "This was delicious. Don't think it needed bacon. (Did I just say that??)" Yes, as most people will agree that bacon DOES make a good thing better, but I don't think that this recipe needed it at all. The lovely fresh veggies are already snuggled in a warm smoosh of cheese and sour cream that I don't think the bacon really added anything, other than an additional serving of guilt. Well, no not really - we ate this up heartily. Children included. It reminds me of a Thanksgiving side dish that I've adopted from my grandmother's recipes that is squash and zucchini (no tomatoes nor french fried onions though) baked w/ mayo, sour cream, parm and Velveeta. Veggies made sinful! This WAS a great recipe though and we'll gladly make it again!

I thought it was good. My husband gave it 2-3 stars. I didn't have the seasoning so I used garlic powder, oregano, pepper & parsley. I didn't use bacon and I don't think it needed it.
