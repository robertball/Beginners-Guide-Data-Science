Only thing I added was the flour suggestion from another review. The chicken was wonderful. It was crisp and flavorful. I will definitely use this recipe again! Thank you!

I used regular cheese flavored crackers, and although it was fantastic, I will be experimenting with other flavor crackers next time. I served it over garden rotini with marinara sauce but any pasta and sauce combo would complement this chicken.

I ended up needing a little more flour and goldfish crackers but other than that this recipe was perfect. I used the regular cheese crackers and the flavor definitely came out. It would be interesting to experiment with other flavors like pizza. Regardless, this was fast, easy, full of flavor, and one I would make again. Thanks for sharing!
