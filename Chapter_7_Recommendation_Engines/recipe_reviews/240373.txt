TERRIFIC!!!!  First time I followed the recipe.  second time I used tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, and diced tomatoes instead of juice and whole tomatoes.  I also used chicken stock instead of beef.  Both versions were absolutely delicious!!!!  I served it with grilled cheese croutons and shredded Romano cheese. It is VERY filling, so bring your appetite.  My husband, who almost never has much interest in leftovers, took a double helping to work the next day.  This one goes into the rotation today!

I love this recipe! The only thing I did different to it was I used fresh baby spinach instead of frozen. And I shave big curls of fresh Parmesan on top. Delish and yumminess! Would recommend and definitely will be making again!

Edit;  I used chicken stock instead of beef broth and it was even better!!!!

This is a nice soup...but as it cooked and I kept tasting I found it needed a lot of salt, a little sugar, and about 1/2 cup white wine.  I also added granulated beef bullion to enhance flavor and increase salt.  I did use fresh spinach and the soup is filling.  Served with garlic/cheese french bread.

The only thing I did differently was added a can of Red Gold diced tomatoes with Green Chili’s for a little extra kick. Oh, I also used fresh spinach. I put the spinach in during the last 10 minutes of cooking. This soup is superb. I will make it again!!

This recipe is delicious! I followed the recipe except I added diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes. I usually do not tomato soup, but this recipe has changed my view on it! The cheese tortellini makes it the perfect combination. I also served this with cheesy garlic Texas toast. This has quickly become one of our favorite meals.

I love tomato soup and tortellini's...good idea to combine them. I used tomato soup instead of juice, stew tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes, and baby spinach instead of frozen. I would make this again and try fresh tomatoes next time.
