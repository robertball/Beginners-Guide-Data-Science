Very easy to make but I thought it was a bit on the bland side. For additional flavor I seasoned it with Emirl Lagasse Essence. The hardest part of this recipe was actually finding Knorr's Red Beans & Rice. Found it at the 4th market I went to. Don't think I will make it again.

I had to use Zatarain's Jambalaya because two grocery stores both had 15 varieties of Knorr but not this one. I used a full pound of sausage and it made 6 good size portions. Tasted great but too spicy for my 6 year old.
