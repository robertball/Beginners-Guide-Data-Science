I am the submitter of this recipe and would like to let you know that when I made this with a different all-purpose blend and found that I needed to add an extra 1/2 cup of sparkling water to get the right consistency so be advised that you may need to adjust liquids here, depending on your flour blend. Also, the breasts should be cut into fillets or pieces.

6/2/16: My review is for the batter mixture itself as I used it for a fish fry. I used Pillsbury GF all-purpose flour along with a GF lager (Two Brothers). As written, the batter turned into more of a dough consistency. So, I did need to add extra sparkling water to the blend (about 1/2 cup), as the recipe author indicates in her review, along with another 1/4 cup of the beer to get more of a liquid consistency. The consistency could be described as pasty/glue type of consistency. The end cooking result was PERFECT airy texture and did not fall apart during frying. It was not grainy and taste wise, people won't know it's gluten free. I thought more salt could be needed, but again I didn't use it for chicken and veggies. I made a second batter to add more dry seasonings (Salt/Pepper, Garlic/Onion powders, and paprika) for the fish fry and accidentally added a little too much water. It was delicious as well, but didn’t stick to the fish as good as the original batter. My non GF husband liked the taste of both, but the texture/consistency of the 1st batter was much better. UPDATE 9/6/18: Pillsbury GF AP flour seems to work best. I’ve tried with Better Batter flour and can’t seem to get the texture right. Last night, I used the Pillsbury and Redbridge beer with no problems for walleye fillets (cut up some in pieces and other fillets battered whole). Delicious! Made this a couple of weeks ago with chicken tenders and they were perfect. Many thanks to BQ for this recipe!

I used the batter recipe for cod, and it worked beautifully.
