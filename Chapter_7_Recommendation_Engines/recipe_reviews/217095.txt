I made this recipe with a bit of a twist using bowtie pasta and bottled poppy seed dressing. I also deleted the cucumbers because I do not care for them in salads. The onion and green pepper provided just enough flavor with the creamy poppy seed dressing.  It was fantastic and my husband loved it! It is a great summer meal.

Very good mix of flavors.  I will half the sugar next time, just a bit sweet for my taste.  This salad was a huge hit at the last BBQ.

This was the most bland, flavorless dish I have ever made.
