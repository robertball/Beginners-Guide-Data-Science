Not bad at all....the grated lemon peel isn't necessary, though.  For the adventurous, add hot pepper flakes to taste...gives it a nice kick.

We enjoyed the fish and the sauce, we just weren't sure that we liked them as a pairing.  If I were to make this again, I would use the sauce very sparingly.

This recipe has potential to be at least 4-star but as-is definitely 3 or less (I'm being generous). I used fillets of sole, and seasoned as follows: 1/2 tsp. EACH onion powder, garlic powder, lemon pepper, paprika & chili flakes with 1/4 tsp. salt and breaded with a cornflake/panko mix. The fish is BLAND, even with my additions. I'm thinking these should be pan-fried instead of baked in the oven to get crispier, increase seasonings and breading. Now, the sauce... Reviewers mentioned it was too thick or didn't pair well with the fish. I think it helped the fish a bit, but it too needs tweaking. I used only 1/3 cup of [regular] apricot preservers (the chunky kind- I chopped up the fruit for it to blend more evenly), juice from half a lemon, zest from said half of lemon, 1 [heaped] tsp. of Dijon mustard and roughly 2 tsps. of sugar to cut the tartness a bit. I would definitely use less lemon juice next time (my fault, obviously) but I'm wondering if orange zest and juice would be a better fit with the apricot jam (or maybe use citrus marmalade instead?). Maybe something 'hot', or rather, 'spicy' could be what the sauce is lacking. I will try this again and experiment. Served this with 'Lemon Pecan Pilaf' from AR.

Very good!  The whole family enjoyed!  I used flounder, regular apricot preserves and spicy brown mustard.

it was very flavorful, but really thick. If I were to make it again I would thin it out a little and use it more sparingly
