These are really easy for kids to make for their moms. I did. And my mom loved them! She said that they were just as good as the resturant ones. And it was so cool how they puffed up like magic. I don't know why that happens, but it's awesome to watch!

great recipe, made me think about growing up, I assumed that the egg amount was wrong( some times our chefs hit 9 instead of 3 on the keyboard, ) I added a little nutmeg to mine and some vanilla, cut a little flower and WOW how simple and awesome

I had never tried Dutch babies before, and am not sure if they are supposed to be so eggy, or more of a pancake.  I think I will try another recipe that does not call for so much egg.

These are excellent! My mom serves them with homemade applie pie filling, leftover from Thanksgiving baking. Or use canned pie filling in different flavors. These go great with sausage, and we even eat them for dinner.

I have never had anything quite like this before, but I liked it and so did my dad, who ate it plain even though I offered him butter, jam, and real maple syrup. I enjoyed mine with a little butter and about a tablespoon of real maple syrup on top; I found it light, fluffy and just sweet enough! I didn't think it was "too eggy" at all. The only thing I might change about this recipe is to add a dash of fresh lemon juice and a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter.

One warning: please don't forget to grease your baking dish! Use Pam, olive oil, or even butter - just make sure you grease the bottom and sides! I forgot and my Pyrex baking pan wound up being a mess of browned-on egg that was quite a chore to clean.

I also felt these were a little 'eggy.' I am going to try one with less eggs as well as another rater.

They are suppose to be eggy. Squeeze lemon juice over it along with sprinkled powdered sugar.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These were delicious! I made 2 dinner plate servings (it made for a much thicker pastry). I added 1 tsp vanilla, 3/4 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and used only 5 eggs to the mixture. Served them topped with cherry pie filling,dusting of powdered sugar and a dollop of cream. Mine stayed "puffed" and not "eggy". I will definately make this again!

Too eggy! Tasted more like an omelete, not something to eat with powdered sugar and berries (which is what I was looking for).  I tried the recipe twice and had the same problem.

this recipe is easy, feeds the family, and is quick easy to clean up after and it pleases everyone down to those who like maple syrup to apple sauce on top, or just the light powdering of powdered sugar.

I've been making dutch babies for years and thought I'd give this new twist a try with the whipping cream. It tasted O.K. and it did fluff up like a Dutch Baby, but the taste and the texture wasn't at all what I was expecting.. Maybe it was the cream...I don't know. I do know that 9 eggs is way too many. I'm going to stick with my tried and true recipe consisting of 3/4 C. All Purpose Flour, 1T. sugar, 3 eggs, 3/4 C. milk and 2 T. butter melted in a 10" oven=proof skillet. Heated at 400 degrees for 15-20 minutes.

we loved this! I only added 5 eggs instead of 9. I also added a tablespoon of sugar, a tablespoon of cinnamon and a teaspoon of vanilla. When it was done I sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top!

I've had these at restraunt in Minnesota and they called them panakokken.  These are really good with chopped up apple and drizzled with caramel sauce and ice cream. (makes for a very rounded breakfast!!)

This is more of a Puff Pancake, or German Pancake, than Dutch Babies.  Dutch Babies are supposed to be small, round balls of dough deep fried and covered with powdered sugar.  At least those are the Dutch Babies I've had.

Works for low carb diet. I had tried another recipe for this and it never puffed up and came out more like a baked pancake. I don't know if it was the flour to liquid ratio or perhaps the salt but this recipe turned out a beautiful light and fluffy delightful treat. I did bring the eggs and cream to room temp before preparing and halved the recipe. It served three of us very well sprinkled with lemon juice, powdered sugar and some sugar free maple syrup. Thank you for allowing us to have a breakfast "cake" without all the carbs!

The dough didn't rise at all! It tasted OK
