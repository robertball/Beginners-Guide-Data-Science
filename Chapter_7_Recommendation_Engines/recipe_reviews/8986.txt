Good and easy to prepare. The recipe asks for an excessive amount of pepper, making the dish very hot. Had I also added the indicated 2 T of hot sauce, a hole would have been burned through the pot. Glad I tasted before adding hot sauce and was able to thus prevent the dish from becoming inedible.

This calls for way too much pepper!  Cut the pepper to 1/2 or even 1/4 teaspoon, and it'll be delicious.

I didn't use the chicken in the recipe, as I only needed a side for our lobster dinner last night. I used basmati rice and my own medley of vegies. The whole family enjoyed this very much Gayle!

I made the vegetable version and it was the perfect side dish for my daughter's birthday dinner Grandson ate 4 large helpings. It was easy to prepare leaving my attention to the more complicated main dish.

This reminded me of chicken soup gone wrong where all the broth had evaporated. It is a one timer recipe for us. I did cut back to a quarter tsp of black pepper as recommended and instead of the hot pepper sauce, I used a couple dashes of cayenne which made it peppery enough.

We didn't care for this very much.  Sorry!  I'm not sure why, but the flavors just did not seem to work together.  I LOVE black pepper; it's among my favorite spices.  This, to me, is what made this even possible to eat.

This was delicious!  I was looking for a great chicken & rice recipe & found it here...so moist, too. I did modify it to suit my family's taste, however:  I did omit the hot sauce & next time I will also leave out the pepper...it was too hot & spicy.  Also, I substituted a carton of chicken broth for the bouillion cubes (I personally don't use them because of the MSG.)  Because of the amount of broth, I didn't need to add the water.  Also, used just one bag of vegetables & that was plenty.

I'm really glad I read the other reviews before starting and only used 1/4 tsp pepper, because even with that this was getting pretty hot. Very very good, tho! I put in peas, carrots and onions with a scrambled egg. Excellent, easy recipe! My chicken came out a little chewy, but all in all tasted great. Thanks!

Very quick and easy recipe! I used my own spices and chicken drippings instead of boullion. It smelled great and tasted even better.

Very easy to make! I didn't add the veggies and had them on the side. The chicken was a little dry and I'll wait for the rice to cook a little more before adding the chicken. I took other's advice and only put in 1 tsp of pepper. We also thought that 1 Tbsp of the herb spice blend was too much - we had green stuff in our teeth. But overall I'll make this again.

Excellent recipe. I will use this again. I did omit the bay leaf. As my "salt free spice" I used Italian seasoning. Very easy to make!

I should have read the other reviews before making this.  Beware--there is way TOO MUCH PEPPER.  I have no problem with spicy foods, but the flavor of the pepper was overwhelming--it's all you can taste.  I will probably try this again, but cut the pepper by at least half or maybe entirely.
