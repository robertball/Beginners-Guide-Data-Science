Awesome!!! My co-workers loved this! A few things I will change though: 4 large eggs instead of medium eggs. Also, add a teaspoon of cornstarch to the sugar before mixing to minimize the weeping (syrup drops on top) of the meringue. But this was awesome!!! I just dipped a spoon in the meringue and pulled up to create the cute peaks. =) THANKS for the awesome recipe!

Exceptionally awesome! The meringue on top is a nice, sweet change over having whipped cream. We absolutely loved it! I will use this recipe over and over again, and plan to make it a new tradition to my family as well. Thank you! :)

I have always been a fan of sweet potato pie, but this recipe tops them all.  I predict that this recipe will be a family favorite handed down for generations.

I had a similar (or the same) sweet potato pie which I was a child traveling with my family.  I've been looking for the recipe ever since.  Thank you for posting this.  I made it as a pudding - no crust, no meringue.  Used 1/2 c. agave nectar instead of sugar.  Still could use less sweetener if desired.  I'm now almost 72 years old and my long search for this recipe is over.

I never thought I'd say this but I think next time I'll use less sugar! 3/4 c makes it very sweet. But it was good!

I am going to make this for Thanksgiving. The only change I will make is to cream the butter and sugar for about 5 minutes before adding other ingredients. I think this incorporates the sugar better. Can't wait to try this recipe!

Absolutely fabulous!!! I made this for thanksgiving and my family is begging me to make it again for Christmas. So yummy!!!  I think I will use a pre baked crust this time though....my roll out crust wasn't strong enough to hold the mixture after baked and it fell apart as I was serving it. Still delicious though.

I used too many potatoes. I could've used a touch of flour in the filling and cooked it longer. I really filled the crust to the brim so the pie ended up a little runny. Tasty though. My next attempt will be better!

I made this pie and the only thing I did was add lemon juice to the sweet potato, it was awesome. Making it again now by request.

This has gone down really well, even my husband, who doesn't like sweet potato pie, has enjoyed it, The only change I made was using  soft dark brown sugar instead of white sugar in the  filling , and it has turned out lovely . Will definitely be making this again .

This was the hit of the party! We put marshmallows on top and also did 1/2 cup white sugar then 1/4 cup brown sugar.  It disappeared within 10 minutes.

I made it on christmas eve to eat it on christmas day, but overnight the meringue released some liquid sugar and it got the crust a bit wet... Do you think next time i should just bake the crust and filling, a add the meringue the next morning?
