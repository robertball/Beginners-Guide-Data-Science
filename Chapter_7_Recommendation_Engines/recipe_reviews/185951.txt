Loved these.  Not only are they quick and easy, but they are not overly sweet.  My daughter was excited to help with these, especially since she loves PB&J.  We used strawberry rhubarb preserves, and did not add the vegetable oil to the peanut butter.  If it's heated, it becomes easy enough to drizzle without the oil. Thanks for a fun, great recipe! *Here's a tip to get them to look like my photo--Instead of using my thumb to make the indentation, I use a 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon measuring spoon.  Press it in the center, and you'll get a perfect spot to place your jam or jelly.

I have been a faithful visitor to this site for years, I love this resource. But I confess that it wasnt until tonight, after making this recipe that I was motivated to join. I HAD to write a review. These are simply the BEST cookies I ever had!!! And btw, my 5 children all agree, now THAT is an event!

I saw these through my fb wall and made them right away, i used saltless butter, mistake... always use butter with salt because it balances out all the flavors, i used a 1/4 teaspoon to make the holes as one of the othere reviewers had said to do and it worked great, i put pineapple jam into 1/3 of the dough and berry jam into another 1/3 and mixed peanut butter and chocolate chips into the rest and they all turned out great! awesome with a cup of something hot.... will make again!

I used strawberry preserves instead of the grape jelly.  They were a huge hit and I had none left over.

In response to how to get the holes even - this is what I do.  I make almond flavored shortbread thumbprints with homemade cherry jam.  Once I have the dough rolled into balls, I use the cap to my almond extract, dip it in flour, then press evenly into the dough ball.  It doesn't stick and it provides the perfect size for the jam.  They spread out nicely in the oven.

My head reviewer (husband) calls them "thick" and required milk to wash down the cookies--which he says is a good thing. He tried the shortbread with grape jelly and a dollop of peanut butter. The cook (me) reports they are very easy to make, didn't stick to the silpat, and held their shape well. All around winner!

I don't know if it was me or the recipe, but these cookies spread horribly, to the point that they were inedible discs with a sticky coating of melted jam covering them.  Maybe I just did something wrong, but I definitely won't be making these again.

YUM. I filled with strawberry and grape jam, alternately. Also, I filled a ziploc bag with the peanut butter [no oil] after reading the others reviews, zapped it in the microwave for 30 seconds, and then cut a teensy hole in the tip to drizzle. Then sprinkled with powdered sugar when they had cooled completely. BEAUTIFUL! (:

The cookies were delicious!  Although, I couldn't quite get a perfect small hole in the center of the cookie with my finger.  My cookies turned out kind of mis-shapened.  If anyone has any suggestions on how to get them to turn out like the pic - please let me know!  I used Strawberry Preserves instead of Grape Jelly.  And I heated up a couple tablespoonfuls of PB in a plastic baggie (placed in a mug) and every 10 seconds, I took out the PB in baggie and mixed by massaging the bag of PB.  Then once it was softened I cut a VERY small hole in the corner, and squeezed (for drizzle) the PB on each cookie - turned out really well!  And no veg. oil was needed.  I would also recomend making them smaller, using smaller balls of cookie dough to begin with, maybe 1" verses the recomended 1.5".  Overall - YUMMY!  I WILL make again!

These are definately good. My girls(2-4) both loved them and my 4yr old loved poking the holes in them. I only did 2 things different, I only had 1 1/2 cups flour so I added 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and for the peanut butter I didn't add the oil, I just microwaved it for 15 sec and it was nice and runny. The best way to drizzle the pb is to put them on a plastic placemat close together and just drizzle that way. I made a mess when I tried doing them idividually. The cookie part made me a little nervous cause there really isn't much to them but they turned out nice and crispy.

Soooo good. Just made them for my husband and I coudn't keep my hands off them! My picky 2-year old loves them too. Flour up your hands and the dough is easy to handle, no need to regrigerate. Just like a pb&j only so much better! I will be making these again and again! I wouldnt change a thing! Thank you so much!

I think these are awesome and they get rave reviews. Couple things make sure your dough is somewhat chilled to prevent spreading and I use peanut oil to thin the peanut butter out (That's really personal preference). I put a dollop of peanut butter on top when they came out of the oven and let it just blend it and it looked great!

Delishish cookies, not to sweet. So well balanced. Fantastic alone or with milk or coffee. I was not familiar with short bread cookies, so was nervous about not adding eggs, but trusted the recipe and it worked out fabulous.  We used grape jam, strawberry jam, blueberry jam, and apple butter.  Ended up with about 18 cookies.

I agree with the other person who said these just spread and filled the pan.  Couldn't even pick one up.  Not sure what the problem is as I followed the recipe exactly.

I definately will make these again. But wish there was a tip on how to reduce chance of them splitting alittle close to the jelly center. Mines came out fine, but I can see how other users came out with messy cookies.

I gave this five stars for being what I assume is a great recipe. I, however, messed up, and used only 1/2 a cup of butter. When I noticed the dough was too dry I figured it out. Instead of more butter I added 1/4 of a cup of peanut butter, and omitted adding the last 2/3 cup of flour. So, essentially this is a different cookie, but also yummy.

Perfect!  Added a small dollop of jelly when out of the oven.  Used blackberry, raspberry and grape.  Drizzled with peanut butter mixed with 10x sugar.  Cooled in fridge.  Very good cookie plain (no jelly).  Try with almond, lemon or orange extract.  With or without jelly.  See recipe for regular drizzle glaze.

I made these using only wheat flour, as I did not realize that I had no white flour.  They were delicious.  My sister and mom, not huge fans of grape jelly, didn't care for them much, but my dad, other sister and I loved them.

Made these once just to get in the Christmas spirit, and then ended up making them two more times to share at Christmas parties. Awesome recipe.

These were so easy and they came out looking just as yummy as those in the pics.
