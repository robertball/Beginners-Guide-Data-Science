I doubled this recipe in order to have leftovers for meatloaf sandwiches for my husband's lunch. I made one big loaf in my Perfect Meatloaf Pan instead of mini loaves. The Stove Top I used was Savory Herbs and I used Sweet Baby Ray's barbeque sauce because that was what I had on hand. Though this meatloaf kept it's shape and was moist, it needs a little more "oomph". My husband and kids all told me they thought barbeque sauce inside the meatloaf would have been better instead of water. Next time I make this, I'll play with the recipe a bit.

Flavor was good on this, but the texture was too mushy and way too bready. It needed double the meat and half the bread. Both hubs and I agreed we would rather not have this again. I will use the cooking method of mini muffins loaves though as it worked out great. Thanks.

These were super flavorful! My husband absolutely loved them. The amount of glaze for this recipe was a little bit much, so next time I think I'll half that, but it was still really yummy and I will be making these again.

This recipe has ruined me for any other meatloaf. I make half with BBQ sauce and the other half with ketchup and mustard. Delicious!

I had to use what I had in my pantry, but this recipe turned out great. The only extra thing I added was a southwestern seasoning mix to the loaf mixture. My daughter, who rarely eats meat, ate it up!!

These were great. So easy to make and I love the idea of the muffin pans. I did add one egg because previous reviewers noted it wasn't sticking together. Otherwise followed without changes. Will make again. With the bbq sauce on top, had lots of flavor. Without that, would be slightly bland I think.

This recipe was pretty good for an easy weeknight meal. I didn't bother with the brown sugar, as the barbecue sauce was sweet enough on its own. Also, baking them in muffin cups, brilliant. I used 80/20 ground beef, had no problem getting them out, and was able to leave the bulk of the grease behind. Will make again.
