Made this for lunch and it was great.  I did change a few things.  I used roasted garlic instead of the infused olive oil.  I also used a little Italian seasonings as well.  Will definately make again.  Thanks for the post.

Wow! I wasn't sure what to expect with these, but they were so delicious. I modified the recipe a bit by adding pizza sauce, but I think they would be great with or without it. This is a great idea for an appetizer or a meal. All the taste, without the carbs.  :)

I am not following the South Beach diet but I thought this was such a unique idea and gave it a try.  It was terrific!  I topped the portobello the same way I would have a regular pizza crust.

This recipe is really good!  I have made it without cooking the tomatoes first, and I think that it is better that way.  I also added a little basil pesto and goat cheese to some, which is really awesome.  This is a low carb favorite!!

I added a little low-fat feta to this and cooked them on the grill.  They are so tasty and filling.

I'm on phase 1, and I'm pretty sure I can eat this.  Anyways, this was a good replacement for pizza.  I put slices of reduced fat salami, peppers, and green onions on top.  They were piled high and a little messy but were still very good.  I also used dry basil and lots of oregano on the tomatoes, and it was very flavorfull.  These hit the spot on South Beach!

This was wonderful.  I did cut back a bit on the basil, and next time I'll chop the tomatoes up a bit more, but apart from that I loved it.

I used mac nut oil instead of olive oil and salsa instead of tomatoes  - delicious and easy to make. Even my veggie-hating husband liked it!

I'm giving this 5 stars because it is cheap, quick and easy and my husband loves it.  I didn't like it that much. He will eat all six portobella pizzas, if given half a chance.  Experiment with the amount of cheese, cooking time,garlic and spices.

These were really good. I used some Italian seasoning mix and had them in the oven for about 10 minutes as they were still cool after the suggested cooking time.

Don't look at the picture that goes with this recipe! It doesn't look anything like the finished product.  This was great. My husband and I are on our 2nd month of South Beach and I was craving pizza. This was a perfect fit! Definitely add pizza sauce and I also topped it off with "Presti's Pizza Seasoning". It had a great pizza flavor. We also cooked them for 8 minutes and I think thinner mushrooms taste better than the real thick ones.

Made these for a quick lunch and YUM!  It's so easy and well healthy.  I used a pizza sauce from an Italian store and some mozz cheese and on my pizza I added some finely chopped onions (yum!)  My toddler loved it...I made 2 only so we could try it.  Next play date I'll definitely be making these for the kids!

Big winner in my house - anything that looks like pizza is awesome. And this is a good healthy alternative. Will make it again for sure.

I found this recipe to be interesting.  I worked in a pizza restaurant for a few years in my late teens.  I found, however, that as this recipe does not call for dough it all falls apart when you try to serve it.  The photo shows a beautiful dough crust.  The recipe has forgotted to include it.  The idea was good and I have made it again with a crust, however, this is very different from that in the recipe.

great, but the regular mozzerella was overpowered by the mushroom and basil.  Buffalo mozzerrela is a must.

Pretty tasty. I didn't fine any mozzerella and used co-jack instead. Also, didn't have any basil, fresh or dried, so I used just the oregano. Used garlic out of a jar. Came together very quickly.

I'm rating this 5 stars because I changed the recipe.  I used wheat pitas as the crust, sauteed the portabello mushrooms, tomatoes and basil, added some Classico Spicy red pepper sauce and mozzarella cheese with some extra oregano, red pepper flakes, and garlic powder.  These rocked!

This was delicious. I got a little creative and added ricotta cheese on it and black olives. But I really enjoyed it and my 21 month old loved it too.

This was just okay, but perhaps would be better if I used fresh basil & fresh tomatoes; the recipe in my cookbook called for sun dried tomatoes(Do NOT use them in this recipe!!) & oregano. I will try it w/ the basil & fresh tomatoes instead; also cook for longer than directions state if your Portobellos are thick like mine were. All in all, a good basic recipe with lots of potential!

Tasty & a nice addition to the veggie list. I did use some leftover pasta sauce, and a new shredded mozzarella cheese w/basil & sun dried tomatoes in it. Really good, I'm ready to make it again tonight!

I used creminis (baby bellos) and put them in a circle to make the "crust."  I also added some pesto and left off the tomatoes.  They were very yummy, although nothing like a pizza this way. I will definitely make them again, although I'll use larger portobellos next time and more garlic.

Perhaps I undercooked them but the mushroom was still quite cool, as was the sauce (leftover and taken from the fridge). I ate it out of my hand, like a piece of pizza and may have found it's texture to be better had I used a knife and fork. I shouldn't rate it so low, sounds like I just didn't get it right.

Yum. Very filling. My husband loved the parts where the cheese was, but wasn't too impressed with the rest. Next time I will cover each mushroom with cheese and add the tomatoes on top. Overall very good for a meatless option.

Very good.  Grilled the tomatoes in a grill pan and used a 5-cheese Italian blend.  Flavorful, but the mushroom were still pretty "raw" after 6 minutes.
