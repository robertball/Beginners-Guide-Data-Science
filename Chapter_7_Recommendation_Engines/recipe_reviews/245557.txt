I had no idea what these were but decided to give them a try- glad I did! I followed the recipe exactly except I added vital wheat gluten (protein) and a dash of milk to help the mixture stick together more.  I used regular size muffin tins, sprayed heavily, and filled them 3/4 full, then patted down. They turned out great! Not crumbly either.

Turned out great, used 1/2 cup coconut oil ,1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce for the 1 cup butter.

Aussie bites are my favorite and I was so glad to find this recipe! They aren't an exact replica but pretty close! To get close to the original, use dates and apricots in the mixed fruit. My sunflower seeds have an aftertaste so in the future I might leave them out. These cookies are normally crumbly so be careful taking them out of the pan!

These are the best muffins ever. It is just as good without the butter or brown sugar for an even healthier version. I just left them out without substitutes and they are still great. Thanks so much for this recipe.

I made these exactly according to the recipe and they were absolutely scrumptious! They are as  good as Costco Aussie bites if not better. My only complaint is the high calorie count and because they are so good it's difficult to leave them alone lol

We had been buying a local store's private brand, but they seemed to stop making them. This recipe turned out  just as good. We used raisins and dried apricots as the fruit. Our yield was 72, the last 4 of which our grandson helper did without the fruit but added some peanut butter. These four required extra time and fell apart,(needing a binder?) but he loved the taste.

Very delicious (and healthy, though not light on calories), but they tended to fall apart after baking; had to eat from a bowl with a spoon.  I tried another batch and squeezed them down well before baking; that seemed to help somewhat. Perhaps freezing and then serving before fully thawed would help too.

Excellent!  My household goes through a bag of these from the store in a day.  I thought I'd try to make it myself, and I found that someone else already did.  Thanks!!!!

The bites I've purchased are wheat-free, so sadly, I won't be trying this recipe.

Good, but not as good as the ones from Costco. I'm trying another recipe next with the quinoa and canola oil... these are a bit too dry as the ratios are laid out for my taste.

Flavour was good, but added some water to help the ingredients stick together.  Next time I will do what kmarie 21 did and add a bit of milk and vital wheat gluten to the mixture.

Tasty, but I'm not sure I would say particularly healthy! I will likely make them again though.
