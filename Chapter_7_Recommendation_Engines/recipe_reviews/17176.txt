I've made these twice. The first time, I made as directed, and found the texture not right due to the egg whites. The Swedish Pancakes I'm looking for aren't fluffy at all- they're more thin and eggy in texture. This morning I made a batch without separating the eggs and they were perfect (and a lot easier and faster to make, too). With this change, this is my new recipe for Swedish Pancakes. Thanks!

I made these last night and was concerned no soda
was in them but they were so lite and fluffy.My 
husband and his dad raved about them. His dad 
said they tasted like the best "secret recipe" his 
wife used to make.

I enjoyed these pancakes.  They were kind of flat (are they supposed to be flat?  I folded them up like they do at IHOP). They were really good smothered in butter and spinkled with cinnimon and sugar.

I just did as some reviewers did and mixed the eggs in whole- I don't have the patience to do the egg whites on a Saturday morning.  They came out GREAT though.  Mine came out less like crepes and more like really thin pancakes, but it's not supposed to be as paper thin as a crepe anyway- if you want crepes, look up a recipe for crepes, and make CREPES, but don't make a Swedish Pancake recipe and then be disappointed b/c it's not a crepe!  Consider the Swedish Pancake a middle ground between crepes and regular pancakes.  To me the batter consistency is PERFECT because they were super easy to flip and I've gotten frustrated with crepes before, but these were no more difficult than "regular" pancakes, and not as heavy to eat.  I had mine with a little bit of sour cream and blueberry preserves, rolled it up, and Mmmmm!!!  We made these with Dutch Babies II and although that one was better IMO, these were stil 5*s all the way.  Seriously, if you love pancakes YOU MUST try the Dutch Baby.  I might not make "fluffy" pancakes for a long time, I think I'm more partial to these "flat" ones now =)  Update:  Wanna know the BEST thing ever?  these Swedish pancakes with Bluberry preserves and sour cream rolled up inside and then topped with LEMON CURD... OMG!!!  A-MA-ZING!!!

Love these! They do remind me of the ones at IKEA.  I halfed the recipe and they came out great. I buttered them and had lingonberry sauce. What a yummy Saturday treat!

these are so yummy and just like my friend's grandma used to make for us as kids.  only draw back is that it's time-consuming to make.  I only do this once in a while, my kids love them - too bad I have high cholesterol and can't eat them (but I do taste it) - YUM!

We have always made a simplier version of this recipe w/out the sour cream.  We were very pleasantly surprised how yummy these were!  The only downfall would be using 4 eggs and then another 4 egg whites...a lot of eggs when you make a double batch for a family of 5.  On more frugal months, this wouldn't work for a tight budget.

Thse pancakes were so wonderful, they were so close to my fathers pancakes. Insted of cooking them in oil I used lots of butter. I had fresh blackberries to top them off with. They make a lot of pancakes and  I doubled the recipie and so many left over. I think I'll freeze them and see how they come out If your looking for the IHOp style of sweedish pancakes there not it I'm still looking for those but you will enjoy these!

Exactly like my grandma use to make. I make a berry reduction for a topping with whipped cream or fill them with sour cream and raspberry jam. I always have to triple this recipe when I make it. Our family of 5 devours them faster than I can make them. :)

I dont really see how these are different from crepes.  I feel the batter must be thinner, so that when you turn the pan, it spreads more easily so you can have a very thin pancake.  Mine are thicker, not at all like the lacy pancakes I get at a local pancakes house.  I enjoyed them as crepes, but I may add more milk to these in the future to see if I can get that thin lace-like pancake.

I made these this morning and my family loved them! I did not separate the eggs and they tasted just like I remember them. I also used a 1/3 measuring cup to pour the batter onto my skillet, because that's how I remember them also! So yummy!

A very delicious recipe that is quickly made and fairly easy (hardest part: separating eggs).  If you like to cook breakfast then try this recipe, especially with the traditional lindonberries (or any other berry).

These pancakes took a little extra work but they were worth it.  I'm a great cook but for some reason I stink at making pancakes for my husband.  He loved these and so did my kids!!

These were delicious, better than any other Swedish pancakes I've attempted!  I had no sour cream on hand, so I added lemon juice to 1/2 heavy cream, to sour and thicken it slightly; then I added1/2 c. milk to substitute for the 1 c. milk in the recipe.  The egg whites in this recipe make each result lighter and fluffier than more familar recipes which are easier but produce a less crispy, more -- rubbery? -- pancake.  Amazing how special these are when the ingredients are so similar to the basic, insipid traditional pancake that has to be drowned in syrup and butter to render it some flavor.  But these come right through, so enhance by going light on the garnish:  light but good preserves or fresh fruit, even better.  Syrup: bad!  I'm grateful for this lovely start to our weekend!

This was really good but I think it needed more sugar so I added  1 tbs and it was great.  I also didn't want it fluffy so I took the advice of another reviewer and didn't separate the egg whites.  My husband loved these and said they were like the 49'er flapjacks he has at Pancake House.

These pancakes were ok, but they were not the traditional thin, eggy swedish pancake I expected; especiall for all the extra work they take I was expecting better. I did add some more milk at the end and they were better.

These were excellent!! I made these special order and they went over very well.  I had some trouble getting them very thin because by the time I put the batter on the griddle it started to cook and it was too late to spread it out.  But the taste was delish.  Served with dusting of confectionary sugar and a mixed berry syrup that I made with 1/2 bag Trader Joes frozen mixed berries (raspberries, blueberries and blackberries), 2 T sugar and 1 t vanilla bringing to boil on the stovetop, letting it cool to thicken a bit.  Thanks Emma!!

These were really yummy, especially with ligonberry preserves.  However, I did use a lot of bowls and created quite a mess.  One other not, it is important for the skillet to be hot, but make sure it is not too hot!

These taste more like polish omelets (fluffy) than Swedish pancakes that I ate at the Swedish breakfast. However they were very good but too much work and dishes to clean. Next time I will try "ILOVEBEINGMOMMY" suggestion and don't separate the eggs for thinner and easier version.

I've tried a lot of pancake recipes and this one is the best!  I did enhance it a bit - I added Tahitian vanilla, Braeburn apple slices  on top right after putting on the griddle, and cinnamon sugar.  Yum!  This will probably be the only recipe I use for pancakes again - unless I'm too lazy to whip up egg whites.

I don't know if there is an easier way but I give this four stars because although they were delicious, it took me a very long time to make. Each pancake took about 2 minutes and the recipe made at least 25 pancakes so I was standing in the kitchen for quite a while just for the actual cooking part. So it all took a little over an hour to finish. Any suggestions would be great. Also, I added quite a bit more milk in order to be able to turn the pan and have the mix spread throughout; about 1/2 cup more. I will make these again, though, because they are so good. We topped them with butter, jam, and a dusting of powdered sugar. yummmm.

I made this for an International dinner at my son's school.  It was a hit!  I couldn't keep up with the requests for more.  Thanks for sharing.

These are the best! I have made the crepe style Swedish pancakes in the past, but these are by far the best. Light and airy and full of flavor. I also used butter. I served them with lemon curd one morning and got raves from the family. Thanks

Just like my husband remembers them!  I added a little more milk and cooked them at medium-high heat, not high.  Great taste and really fluffy!

A waste of 4 eggs.  I found the flavor bland.  I added lemon juice for a zip, but this made the pancakes taste tinny.  I won't make again.

These are quite good, though they are more like crepes than traditional pancakes.  Beating the egg whites makes all the difference in the world - they are fluffy and have a nice consistency.  I wanted to add fruit to them while cooking but I didn't because they are so thin.  I guess next time I'd probably cook up some fruit to serve on the side.  A nice departure from the ordinary.

Excellent recipe.  If you want a thin, less 'cakey' pancake, do not let the batter 'pool' in your skillet.  Only pour enough to barely reach the edges when the skillet is tilted around.  If you pour too much batter, the consistency (and taste) will be quite different.

Fluffier, tastier, and much healthier than regular pancakes, these fluffy, delicious swedish pancakes are a little more work than regular pancakes, but definitely worth it.

Tastes like our favorite thin restaurant pancakes! We did not separate the eggs, just beat them together. Cooked over medium heat in butter & topped with blueberries!

Awesome! We loved these! It took a little bit of experimenting to figure out how to cook them correctly (lower temperature helped), but after the first 3 the rest turned out great and delicious.

I liked this recipe.  A little more time intensive than past swedish pancakes I have made, but worth the extra effort.  They turned out great!  I took some light sour cream and added a little sugar and marionberry jam.  That's what I filled them with.  Easy and tasty!  I will make them again.

They were pretty good. My family hosted an international exchange student last year, and she made these pancakes. I have been looking for the recipe she used ever since, and I finally found it. These work well with jam. We put ice cream on them, and they are amazing!!! Thanks for writing this recipe!

Was not sure these would be thin enough, but I used the back of the spoon to smooth them out and they were very good.

Here are my changes for perfection. Add 1 TBs vinegar to the milk and let sit for 2 minutes.  Add 1 TBs baking powder to dry ingredients. Only whip up 2 of the eggs whites. It's like fluffy crepes. I'm so happy.

I was hoping to find a match for the pancakes my grandmother made when I was a child and this recipe did not disappoint!  I did not separate the eggs as I don't remember them being made that way, and they turned out just like grandma's.  We eat them with a thin layer of sour cream with a tiny bit of sugar sprinkled on top of the sour cream for "crunch," and sometimes adding fresh berries as well.  We also would have them as a savory lunch by filling them with some meat browned with taco seasoning, shredded lettuce, diced tomatos and a bit of shredded cheese.  Thanks for sending me down memory lane with this recipe!
