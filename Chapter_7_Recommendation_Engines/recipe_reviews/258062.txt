I really liked this a lot. I haven't had congee aside from what I have made so  I dont know how authentic this is... it is very tasty.  The only thing that kept it from being 5 stars was the fish.  It was fine and I ate it, but when I made this again, I will use something else other than fish I just couldn't get  used to the idea of fish in this.. I will use cooked chicken I think instead.
