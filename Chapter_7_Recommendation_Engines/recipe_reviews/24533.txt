Did not like this recipe. Shockingly enough, neither did my chocolate lover 3 year old daughter. Was tasteless. If it weren't for the chocolate chips, I think it would have been like eating styrofoam.

I give it 5 stars after i changed a bit. I added the whole egg instead of the egg white and added more chocolate chips. I also had to bake them for 17-18 mins. And I added sugar to the tops before baking like sarah lynn said. They turned out great!

The muffins tasted like apple cinnamon muffins not choclate chip. The recipe can be modfied- just use apples instead of choclate chips.

Yummy & moist. I prefer to add an entire bag of chocolate chips though so they are super chocolately! I also sprinkle sugar over the top before baking, this leaves a yummy coating like a sugar cookie!

These muffins were NOT really good at all. They stuck to the wrappers, all you could taste was cinnamon and they didnt taste anything like chocolate chip muffins.

I love this recipe because you dont need butter or oil.!  I find them filling and the kids love them. I make them even more filling by adding 1/4 cup of bran and 1/4 cup ground flax.

I don't know if I did something wrong but these muffins came out terrible.  They stuck to the paper cups, didn't rise enough and they didn't taste good.

I added 1/4 cup oat bran,a full teaspoon of vanilla extract and a tablespoon of ground flax and  used whole wheat flour.  A nice light muffin. I used non stick spray to coat the muffin pan. The muffins did rise.  Next time I will probably add another 1/4 cup of chocolate chips. I did not add the walnuts nor the cinnamon.

I added cocoa powder as I wanted them to be more chocolatey.  Probably won't make them again.

This recipe was more cake-like. It stuck to the muffin liners and had no taste although I used sweetened applesauce and even added honey, as well as cocoa powder. I might try this again in the future, adding lemon juice to the milk first, adding more honey and cocoa powder, and more flour. I also used a whole egg rather than just the whites as suggested above. The muffins rose fabulously. With a little tweaking, this can turn out to be a great recipe!

After reading the reviews, I added an extra egg white and an extra 1/2 tsp baking soda.  They did end up rising well, possibly because of those additions, but the bottoms stuck to the muffin liners so bad I could only eat half of each muffin.
I initially rated this 2 stars but bumped it up to 3 after they were gone.  I thought they actually tasted very good and would make them again, with the changes I used the first time.

Muffins are moist, soft and delicious. Used mini semi-sweet chips to melt easier in oven.  Substituted buttermilk instead of regular milk. 

Baked for about 20 minutes. 

Turned out great !

Turned out great! I doubled the recipe, used 1 1/2 cups all purpose flour and 1/2 cup coconut flour. I also added the brown sugar/applesauce mix to the flour, then added the milk, then the extra flour. Also used a whole bag of chocolate chips. Will use this recipe again!

I made these muffins for my diet since they are low-calorie, and they turned out really good! I didn't have applesauce or walnuts though, so I left them out and they are still pretty good ;)

I first made this as directed but even the batter tasted to bland for me. I added 1/4 cup coca powder and 2 tablespoons of white sugar and upped the milk by about 1/4 cup. Came out delicious and very moist.

The muffins turned out looking and tasting odd. I will not be making them again.
