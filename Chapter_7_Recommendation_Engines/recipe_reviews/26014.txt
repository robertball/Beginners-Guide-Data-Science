This is a good recipe. I have made this frosting in a bakery (7 1/2 gallons!) and this recipe is similar. I used real butter, evap. milk and followed the recipe except for adding extra coconut and more pecans. Also, regarding the cooking time, the best tip I can give is to let it come to a full rolling boil, then it will begin making a 'smacking' sound as the bubbles pop. Let it 'smack' boil for at least 5 minutes, turn off heat, add other ingredients and you will have no trouble with it thickening. The eggs thicken it, like in a cooked pudding.

This Frosting is great. I have used this frosting for about 3 years now on my German Chocolate Cakes and it always turn out great. Here's what I do for the perfect frosting. 

First of all I use it on a 2 layer 9 inches round cake so I have to double the recipe because as it is written, it is not enough frosting for a 2 layer 9 inch cake.  I beat together the milk and egg yolks in medium saucepan, and then I stir in the sugar and butter. I stir with my whisk until the butter has melted, and then I put on my timer for 20 minutes. I continue to cook and stir my frosting over medium heat.  When the 20 minute timer goes off, I remove it from the heat and then I add my vanilla, coconuts and pecans.  Then I let the mixture rest for about 15 to 20 minutes before I try to spread it on my cake.  You will notice that when you take the frosting off the heat it will be a little runny but after you add the coconuts and pecans and let it rest it will thicken up.  If 20 minutes is not long enough for your frosting to thicken just let it rest until it gets to room temperature. You have to let the frosting rest for a while so it can thicken. Now you are ready to spread the frosting over the cake.  I hope this helps.

This is an excellent recipe. You might want to edit to say cook 10 minutes as it only says cook until thickened. I brought it to a boil on slightly over medium heat then cooked for 10 minutes stirring often. Added the coconut and nuts and it thickened perfectly. If it didn't thicken for others, they must not have cooked long enough. Linda

This is what the canned frosting from the store is trying to taste like--but failing.  After you make this, you'll never eat the canned stuff again!  So good.  Regarding the directions, I would add "mix & heat the milk, sugar, and butter, and then add by spoonfuls to the egg yolks in a separate bowl, mixing while adding.  Add about three or four spoonfuls and then put that yolk mixture in the pan with the rest of the mixture".  Also, I always remove the chalaza (the little white squiggly thing in the egg).  Otherwise, you may find it cooked in your frosting--yuck.

This is a really great recipe but I found that it was better when you double the amount of vanilla and add more pecans and coconut. Also it is much better when using real butter.

The only changes I made to this recipe were to use 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, toasted my coconut on a baking sheet in a @350 oven (Google "how to toast coconut", if you are not sure how), and increased the amount of coconut to 2-1/2 cups. I like the nutty, crispy taste of toasted coconut. This is a very good, easy, and great tasting frosting, that I used as frosting for my Samoas cupcakes. I highly recommend it!

This is a wonderful recipe! I can just eat spoonfuls by itself. It was a big hit with us. You do have to double the recipe if you are going to frost the sides of a 2 layer cake.

Very good! I took advice of others and added 1.5 c of pecans and 2 c coconut. I brought to a rolling boil (smacking bubbles and everything, I was afraid it wasn't going to work) for 6 minutes, stirring often, took off heat, and added pecans and coconut. Was thick right away. This is a keeper! So easy.

I tried making this and the first time it turned out great, then the sugar crystallized over night, so there were little bits throughout.   The second time it was just grainy,  The recipe I was following said to cook it 12 min med heat, but maybe it wasn't  hot enough, or not cooked long enough.

I swear I have always bought canned frosting but one day read the ingredients and was disgusted by how many things on the list I couldn't even pronounce. For my husbands bday I made him a chocolate cake and found this recipe for the frosting. I have never made homemade frosting before so I read through the comments and took the advice to let it boil for about 15 minutes. I did not change anything else and I can honestly say we will never be able to use store bought GC frosting again. This recipe is brilliant.

I love this frosting...very easy to make. I didn't have evap. milk so I only used the fat free milk that I have in the fridge; still turned out great. I'll try with evap.milk next time. Thanks for posting this!

Didn't thicken up as much as I expected.  Maybe I'll try cooking longer next time.  I will make it again.  I don't have any kids at home, but I'm sure my grandson will like it.

I can't believe I messed up this recipe, but I did! I made the same mistake as MHHUGHES and mixed up the first 4 ingredients using a full can of milk instead of 1 cup. It had been cooking for awhile so I only added another 1/2  cup of sugar and let it continue to cook for another 10 minutes or so. I added extra vanilla, coconut and nuts too. It wasn't as good as I know it will be next time but it was tasty anyway. My recipe now has the measurements highlighted and circled so I will do it right next time.

LOVED this recipe! We just needed a frosting to top our leftover sugar cookies and i couldn't pass this recipe up. Even after my sugar cookie was gone I was eating this frosting by the spoonful. (Did I just say that outloud?) I followed it to a T (just about... I just didn't add as much coconut and I omited the pecans) and it worked out great for me! I WILL be making this again.

Turned out great for the cake balls recipe on this site.  I made a boxed german chocolate cake and this recipe complimented it great!!  I even left out the pecans entirely!  Boiled for about 10 minutes and let thicken in the fridge.

Followed commenter Christine's advice.  I had no idea my favorite frosting was so easy to make! I put in a little organic almond extract with the vanilla for an extra nutty taste.

The bread pudding itself is amazing! I used chocolate chips instead of raisins second time. I didn't care much for the sauce but my husband loved it. The second time I made German chocolate cake frosting without the nuts and coconut and it fit my taste better, more caramely. Thank you for an awesome recipe!

This is the recipe that I have used for years. I change one thing on this recipe. That is on the pecans. I use 1/ 2 cup pecans and 1/ 2 walnuts. You can not even tell that the walnuts are in there at all. It is really good enjoy.

Excellent! So much better than the can stuff! I followed a previous reviewer's tip and brought it to a "smacking" boil and let it boil for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. It thickened right up and turned out perfectly.

This was delicious!!  I whisked it just about the whole time.  Once it started to bubble, I cooked it for 12 minutes to make sure it was thickened enough.  I also toasted the coconut and pecans in a large dry skillet (at the same time) before adding it all together.  Will definitely be saving this recipe!

If I could give it more than five starts, I would. This is perfect for German Chocolate cake. I made one for my husband's office using this frosting and it was gone before noon. Thank you for sharing, I'm saving this recipe.

This recipe made my my first homemade pecan/coconut icing a YUGE success!
My Tweaks and Tips:
For deeper color I sprinkled 1/8 tsp of instant coffee into the egg yolks, whisking well (you won't taste it). I tempered the yolks before adding them to the mixture, steadily stirring and scraping with a silicone spatula up to, and 10 minutes after reaching a boil. I used 2/3 tsp vanilla extract and 1/3 tsp liquid butterscotch flavoring.

Delicious! I doubled the recipe and followed exactly, but toasted the coconut and pecans. I would definitely recommend doing that. I let it simmer for 15 minutes and it thickened perfectly.
The recipe as written would probably cover a 9x13 cake just fine, but I made a triple layer cake and even after doubling it, it could have stood to have a bit more frosting. Next time I will triple and let my hubby have the extra. He'll think he's died and gone to heaven

Excellent! My electric stove burns a little hot....so i only cooked the frosting base about 15 mins (when it bubbled & popped and burned my wrist!) it was perfect consistency to use right away after i increased amt. of coconut to 2 cups and nuts to 1-1/2 cups

From the start I  cut the sugar in half.  It didn't change the integrity of the frosting, if anything, it is enhanced the flavor of the nuts and coconut.  Yum, yum

This made enough to frost 2 dozen cupcakes but with not a lot able to liberally frost them.  I did slightly brown the butter first to give it a deeper richer flavor then let the butter cool slightly before proceeding with the recipe.  I also tempered the eggs.  Easy recipe, a synch to prepare.  I think next time I would slightly toast 1/2 cup of the coconut to give it a bit more oomph.

Seriously good.  Not a fan of canned frosting, so my oatmeal cake topping had been doing double duty on German chocolate cakes.  I made this just as written and it was excellent.  Next time I'll try some of the other tweaks.  Thank you for sharing!

Made just as recipe called for but I doubled it to cover a double layer cake.. It didn't set up as well as I hoped but I might need to boil it just a tad bit longer for the bigger batch..  Will make it again...

also want to mention to use a heavy saucepan or it might scorch it

I love this recipe, however I don't care for the flavor  of evaporated  milk, so I used 1/2 cup ev. Milk and 1/2 cup cream. I also increased the coconut  to 2 cups and the pecans to 1 1/2 as recommended  by others.

I totally screwed up and put all the ingredients in the pot instead of thickening first.  So I simmered it a bit longer and put it on the Black Magic Cake from this site with Satiny Chocolate Glaze in between the layers.  It was a great cake.  I'll have to try the recipe again as intended to see if there's a big difference - but as I made it, it was like coconut topping I've used on Thanksgiving yams before.  So..still kinda perfect for Thanksgiving.

Great recipe...Yummily rich.  But, to make it really wonderful...Toast the pecans ..... It makes a world of difference!  I toast them at 350* for about 15 minutes...cool them before adding to frosting.  I toast my nuts before adding them to any of my baking.

This is a great recipe. I toasted my coconut and my pecans, as other reviewers had mentioned. It really does increase the depth of flavor. I would add that the vanilla should be added with coconut and pecans off the heat. Cooking it with the custard burns off much of the flavor.

The ease of preparation earned this recipe 4 stars. To obtain the correct consistency you'll need to increase the amount of coconut to 2c., and pecans to 1.5c. minimum. It does thicken up while cooling. One con is that the cooked milk, sugar, & egg base  comes out very blond in color. Next time will attempt with lt. brown sugar. Blondness compounded by my using dry-toasted chopped slivered almonds in place of pecans because it was what I had. Also was improved by using salted butter, plus a healthy pinch of salt.

The best coconut pecan recipe I have found!  My taste buds told me it needed a bit of salt so I added just a pinch and it brought out more flavor!  This is definately a keeper!

Really good recipe, butter tastes the best.  My grandson calls it candy frosting.  It's really good on dark chocolate cake.

This is the best!  I didn't add the cornstarch but "smack" boiled it as suggested by another reviewer for about 7 minutes.  I also added more pecans and coconut.  The cake and this frosting are going to be a hit at our "Hello, Dolly!" cast party!

DELICIOUS! I followed the instructions given by reviewer MSBETTYE. It turned out perfectly. If you choose to toast the coconut and pecans watch them carefully! I had to redo my coconut because I let it scorch a bit.I put this on top of a boxed chocolate cake mix but beacause of this frorsting it tasted home made.

I made this recipe (twice actually) for my husbands birthday.  He loves german choc. cake and I rarely make it.  The first time I had already started the heat and mixed in the eggs a little to late. There was chunks of eggs whites through out.  I had to dump it out and start fresh.  I made sure to mix all ingredients together first and then started heating, stirring continually.  This turned out amazing.  I don't love this kind of frosting that much and found I couldn't keep my fingers out of the leftovers.  I had doubled the recipe because I was making a double layer 9 inch cake.  I had plenty of frosting. I will make this again!

More like pudding than icing.  Not sweet at all.  No one asked for seconds.

Excellent! i agree that you should cook the mixture for 10 mins.  I tried a few other recipes, but this one is about the best

I didn't read the recipe correctly and added 1 CAN of evap. milk instead of 1 CUP. Well, when I realized my mistake, I hastily added more of all the other ingredients. It still was not as thick as it should have been, but the flavor was great.
