This is a great simple to make dish. I had no idea that so few ingredients can make such a delicious meal. I used sour cream.

I liked this as a nice creamy tomato chicken dish. I used bone in chicken thighs, and a sprinkle of paprika...just a personal preference. Simmered longer to reduce the tomato sauce before adding the cream. Tasted like a creamy chicken cacciatore. Will probably make again.
