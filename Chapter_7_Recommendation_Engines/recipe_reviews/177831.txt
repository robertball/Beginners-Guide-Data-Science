These were kinda runny so I'd cut down on the milk. Hubby thought they were great.

Very yummy side dish!  My boyfriend loved it and requested it again.  I will agree it's a little runny...I will try and balance it out with more potatoes next time.  I also used chives flavored sour cream & sprinkled crumbled bacon into the recipe for a baked potato taste.  Two thumbs up!

Flavor was delish! It was definitely a bit soupy/runny...so next time I'll probably add more  mashed potatoes to balance the can of soup.

It was okay. I am not the best cook, and was one of my first times cooking for people. It turned out way different from what the picture looked. And didn't taste or look like "potato bake" more like cheddar soup. The taste was regular.
