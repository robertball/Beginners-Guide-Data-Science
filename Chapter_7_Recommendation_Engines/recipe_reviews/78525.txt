This basic recipe has been a favorite in my family for fifty years. We omit the celery, and add diced pieces of cheese..Velveeta seems to be the most popular, cheddar came in a close second..

Out of this world!  I JUST made this - it hasn't even chilled yet and I can't keep my fork out of it.  I couldn't decide between bean salad or corn salad, so I made this and added  a 15oz can of drained sweet corn (I tripled the original recipie first - I had a 52oz can of kidney beans).  Also subbed green onion for regular (had 'em), and chopped uo a dill pickle instead of sweet relish.  I'm a goof about altering recipies (not always with good results), but this one surely doesn't need goofing with.  Thank you sooooooo much for sharing this!! My new favorite salad!

I did not care for this recipe.  It sounded quick and easy and it was, but with dubious results.  The mayo was all I could see and taste, there was really no other flavor in the "salad." I chilled it overnight hoping the mayonnaise flavor would subside compared to the relish and salt and pepper to no avail.  1/2 C. of mayo was a lot making it heavy and gooey. I won't be making this one again.

This was a good salad, but it won't knock your socks off.  I don't like sweet relish so used dill relish instead.  I also used green onion instead of regular onion as I didn't want a strong raw onion taste.  It was good, but I'll probably add more dill relish next time & maybe some dill weed & a sprinkling of parmasean cheese.  It's a good salad, but needs a little something added for my taste.

I was surprised to find this recipe. My grandmother has made kidney bean salad for years. I gave it five stars because it's similar, a great start, and a good change of pace. Kidney beans, onion, celery, and mayonaise are the basics. My grandmother always added to the basics and made it differently depending on what was on hand. I make my dressing more like potato or macaroni salad dressing. I mash 2 hard boiled eggs, add my mayo, a squirt of prepared mustard, and a splash of pickle juice. I also spice it up a bit with little garlic powder, a touch of salt and pepper, and maybe a pinch of cayenne or paprika. My grandmother always used either chopped pickles (dill and/or sweet) or chopped cucumber. Optional items would include cheese (Velveeta, Colby, or mild or sharp cheddar, try your favorite cheese), peppers (green, yellow, or red), and even a chopped apple. The trick to this salad is to make it before the rest of your meal so that it has time for the flavors to meld a bit.

I give it five starts IF you add 1 teaspoon of curry powder. That's the best ingredient and they don't have it in there!! And I use Dill Relish instead of sweet, it gives it that dill/curry flavor that's amazing.

This recipe is great! I left out all the ingredients and made up my own and it was fantastic!  No, really I just left out the relish and celery and used 1/4 cup of mayo.  It makes a cool and simple al fresco summer lunch served on a lettuce leaf and accompanied by hot corn bread, a tossed salad and iced tea.

This was a very quick & easy salad to throw together with ingredients I had on hand, so that's a plus! We liked the combination of flavors, but agree that the recipe calls for too much mayo. I used 2T and it was plenty for our taste. Other than that, no complaints and no leftovers! Made a great side dish to our Sloppy Joes II dinner.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I love kidney bean salad and this tastes just like the deli's. It was very easy to prepare and very good. I didn't use the whole 1/2 cup mayo. Just added to taste. I didn't want to put to much in--you can always add extra but can't take it away. I also added some small cubes of diced sharp chedder. I will be making this myself instead of purchasing, again.

This is an old recipe I was pleased to find again.  I substituted chopped dill pickle for the sweet pickle relish, used light mayonnaise seasoned with a dash of onion powder and a T. of dill pickle juice, and proudly served a dish very much like one that was a childhood favorite.

Great salad I remember from childhood. I omitted the relish and added a few tspns dried cranberries, and a chunk of granny smith apple chopped and a couple tablespoons toasted pine nuts. Delicious.

I was looking for something new to do with kidney beans besides just heating and eating them from the can.  I found out that beans are good for diabetic's, and so I am trying to get more beans into my diet.  My husband and I just loved this recipe, and we will for sure be making it more often.  I did however make a few changes like I didn't have sweet pickle relish, but I did have dill relish.  I do not use mayonnaise, and so I used miracle whip instead.  I also rinsed off the kidney beans because of the redish brown juice from the can.  Great!!!!!!!

This was SO easy and SO yummy!  I used green pepper instead of celery, because I didn't have any celery.  I am imagining this in a pita....maybe with some fresh spinach leaves and some tomato slices....yum!

I have used this recipe for over thirty years.  The only thing I do differently is I add celery seed.  This recipe is nutritious, simple, delicious and always a hit.

3 generations, grandmother, mother, me have been making this recipe.  I don't bother measuring anything.  I do add a pinch of garlic powder, a pinch of sugar, and a splash of yellow mustard.  Also rinse the beans well.  We absolutely love it.  Cold salads are a favorite of my family.  Pea, kidney bean, potato and macaroni.  Love them all!!!

I finally found a bean salad I love! This is basically an old family pasta salad, minus the pasta - good for a low carb diet, or just for quick prep (you don't have time to cook pasta).  This salad is good even without the 1 hour in the fridge.  I used dill pickles instead of relish and only more like 1/4 c. mayonnaise, but otherwise left this unaltered.  Delicious!

Brings back memories!  However, I chop all ingredients super small (except beans) so the kidney beans are the real star!  Also, I add a half of a finely chopped carrot for an extra touch of sweetness and crunch.  Mmm mmm good!

I love this recipe!  It is the best. Since we like beans, I started adding 1 can of Garbanzo Beans and instead of sweet pickle relish, I dice up a couple of Kosher Pickle Spears.  And, for us, we don't add any eggs. 
This is a hit with family and friends. It is great to take to work for lunch!. Thank you Jackie for an excellent job :)

This is an outstanding recipe just like we used to have years ago. The only change I made was using small sweet pickels chopped into small pieces rather than the relish and adding a teaspoon of the juice from the pickel jar.

This is one of my dad's favorite's and we had often growing up. I had forgotten all about it until I saw the recipe here so I had to try it. Wow, this tastes exactly like my Mom's recipe! Better the longer it chills. My guys didn't care for it, but I liked it, maybe because it was nostalgic? Easy to make. Good flavor. I used Miracle Whip.

I searched high and low for my Grammy's recipe.  This is it!!!  It brings back so many memories.  Thank you:)  I did follow the recommendation of one review to add a little of the mayo, refrigerate for a couple hours, drain the watery juice and add the rest of the mayo.  This did keep it really creamy.

I made this for church potluck yesterday...after reading the reviews I used 2 cans of kidney beans and one can of corn, substituted dill relish for sweet relish, and doubled eggs, relish, celery and onions (I used red onions) and everybody loved it....way to much mayonnaise...and I love mayonnaise...I did read the previous reviews about to much mayonnaise but I love mayonnaise so didn't cut back...next time I will as the ingredients does not sock up the mayonnaise like pasta and potatoes.....

My grandmother made this salad when I was a little girl!  She used chopped up sweet pickle gerkins and added some of the sweet pickle juice, instead of pickle relish and Miracle Whip instead of mayonnaise.  I don't care for kidney beans, but love them in this salad.  Thanks for the great memories!

My husband loves this. I use 1 can of light kidney beans and 1 can of dark. I have cut the mayo back to 1/4 cup and use spring onions.

I love kidney bean salad. Have made for years but I use Miracle Whip instead of mayo and chopped sweet pickles instead of relish. It is better to set in refrig overnight so the flavors meld. But I am sure this version is just as good. Just a matter of taste. Yummy!

Made this first time a couple of years ago. I dont use pickle, but add diced red apple (with skin on) and cheese, we like jack and cheddar mix. Make sure you cut eveything same size. Celery adds a nice crunch, next time maybe some walnut nuts.

I too have made this recipe for years. My recipe doesn't call for the pickle relish but it does call for 1/2 cup grated carrots and 1 whole cup of chopped celery.  More celery gives it a nice crunch and the carrots add color and nutrition. Give it a try...

This was perfect with about half the mayo and twice the celery. That said, though, I can see why nobody's posted a picture--the salad looks rather unpleasant (but tastes fantastic, I swear!).

I always use recipes as "guidelines" so I altered this a bit but it came out amazing! 

I used mayo, couple pinches of sugar, pepper, salt and vinegar. 1 can of kidney beans, 4 hard-boiled eggs, chopped around 10 dill pickle slices into tiny bits and a splash of lemon juice. I wasn't optimistic but it is so good! I will definitely make this again:)

Had some kidney beans, that I needed to use, thought I would try this recipe, because it was quick and I had all the ingredients. It turned out better then I thought it would. I was really good, I can see myself making this again and again, thanks for sharing such a great and easy recipe

Thanks, Jackie, for the great recipe & the memories!  My mom used to make this salad when I was a kid but I had forgotten all about until I saw it here.  I made it exactly as stated only I cut everything in half (I live alone) & it's perfect.  The recipe would be easy to double or triple for a crowd.  Thanks again!

This is a recipe from my childhood that I had totally forgotten.  Never had it with celery, but I'll give it a try.  My mom always chopped sweet pickles for it, so a little bigger chunks than using relish.  I'll try it though.  And I think that the mayo needs to be added a little at a time.  It shouldn't overwhelm the salad which sounds like a problem that many were having.  It should just coat everything, not get soupy!!

Yum!  I made this salad today and my husband and I both enjoyed it.  I have been trying to duplicate the Kidney Bean Salad at a restaurant we like.  We thought this tasted much like it.  I did omit the egg but still, this was a nice bean salad.  Thank you so much.

OMG!  This is soooo good.  My husband is the big kidney bean salad fan in our family, so I made this for him, then... I taste-tested it (a few times).  I made a few changes suggested by other reviewers; I used green onions instead and extra celery.  I also added an extra egg and skipped the relish, hubby wrinkled his nose when I asked his opinion.  Made this for a party that isn't until tomorrow, I'm sure I'll get plenty of compliments (I probably should've made a double batch), we'll see...  P.S.  I wish I could rate this recipe 10*'s

I just made this and put it into the fridge to chill somewhat before I dug in AGAIN! I didn't know how everything would taste together, but I knew I liked everything individually. I did add some corn like another reviewer plus add some cubed cheese like another reviewer plus more celery, as I love celery. Something no one in my house will eat but me, but I'll be making it often! Love it!

Our Family LOVES this recipe.  First time I made it, followed recipe exactly.  Well hubby does not like onions, so now we add cucumbers instead and I add Dill weed instead of the relish.  AMAZING... And even better the next day for a great lunch.  Thank you so much for sharing!  It is now one of our main recipes we rotate once a month into our meals! A+  Plus add sweet frozen corn!

This recipe is similar to one my mother made with the exception of the egg. Hers contained chopped tomatoes, bell peppers, and cucumbers  as well as the other listed ingredients. It is a refreshing and delicious summer salad! Tastes even better when chilled.

This recipe has been in my family for 3 generations.  My grandmother (I'm 60+) added ketchup to the recipe, but my family has never done that.  There's always a can of kidney beans in the pantry.  Celery and pickles always in the bowl.  Sometimes green onions, celery seed, salt and pepper, sometimes diced apple... never eggs.

This was soooooooo good!! I'll use less mayo next time. I used green onions since I was out of regular onion. Very easy to make and super tasty. I didn't give it a chance to chill because it was just that good. Will make again and again.

I was the only one in my family who came close to liking this, and I think that's because I'm such a fan of kidney beans. Sorry it didn't work for us.

OMG. I thought this was a private family recipe that only we knew about. Except for the relish (we chop up sweet gherkins) it is exactly like Dad, Grandma and the Aunts used to make. Love it!

This was a very easy and good salad.  Made it this morning for our Easter dinner.  Since I used a white onion that is more pudgent, I only used 1/8 of a small onion and 1 egg. I also put in a pinch of cayenne pepper to make the flavors pop.  I will use this recipe again.

I did not include the eggs (for no other reason other than I didn't have any to hand)but did include a bit of dill as suggested by another member. I also noted that some others thought the salad had too much mayo/relish, so added both ingredients just a bit at a time until I was satisfied.  Tasty & wll probably make it again.

Wow! Fresh, healthy quick fix. I added a chopped carrot for a little extra nutrition and it didn't affect the taste at all. Be sure to use mayo and relish to your own liking rather than just taking someone's word for it.

This was OK but can't see what is so fabulous about it.  Kind of a strange combo of ingredients.  I too used chopped dill pickle since I don't like sweet relish, and I also always use fat-free Miracle Whip for mayo.  It was all right, but the only way I'd make it again is if I just wanted a way to use up some ingredients.

Yes, this salad isn't the prettiest, however, very tasty. I didn't feel like chopping fresh onion so threw in a tbsp of dehydrated instead. I mixed the wet ingredients first, drained/rinsed kidney beans (1 can light & 1 dark) & let them dry off in colander. I also added about 2 tsp splenda for a slight sweet taste. Let it sit overnight then added the chopped hard cooked eggs before serving. It was really GOOD, thanks. You need to add salt  to your liking as well.

Very good and simple to make.  I always thought bean salad looked awful at family gatherings, but now that I'm pregnant I find it quite tasty!!  And to keep calories down I used Hellmans Light, because it is the Best :)

Delicious, nutrious, and easy.  I use green onions, low fat mayo, and usually add extra celery. This is now a regular side dish.

I am always struggling to find new vegetarian dishes for my daughter and we really enjoyed this one.  Easy to prepare and very tasty.  I used one 19 oz can of beans and some frozen corn, because she is crazy about corn.

Wow! this salad is not only yummy, but easy to throw together with things you might already have on hand. I used pepper relish instead of pickle since that's what I had available. It is also very colorful.

My mom had a recipe like this that someone shared with her while she was in the work force over 50 years ago.  We used chopped celery to extend the recipe and 1/3 cup of sweet pickle relish to decrease the mayonnaise content.  This is my favorite bean salad!

This is a very good recipe.   However, to add a bit more flavor, I added two tables of dill relish,  one teaspoon fresh lemon juice and 1 teaspoon of dry mustard.  The dry mustard and lemon juice seems to give it a bit more character.

This recipe is good. I didn't add relish as I did not have it. However, given how easy,fast, and the availability of the rest of the ingredients, this recipe deserves to be made over and over again especially if in a hurry. It works well as meal or as a side with roasted meats.

6.6.18  We love all kinds of beans, and if there was a quick and easy go-to side dish, it’s kidney bean salad.  The only change I made was adding some chopped cheddar simply because that’s the way it was served when I was growing up.  Classic comfort food at its finest IMO!

Love this recipe AS IS! Duke's Mayonnaise is a must in mayo based salads. Hellman's is good, too. Makes a huge difference. I also drain, rinse, and dry off extra moisture from my beans so the amount of mayo is perfect. Also prefer red onion and white pepper. This is so delicious and everyone loves it;

I learned to rinse the kidney beans in a colander very well to eliminate any bitterness. I prefer Miracle Whip but that's a personal choice. These two things together make the salad taste perfect to my family.

I love this recipe!  Have made it several times.  Sometimes as an appetizer with crackers.  Many times I have  served with two other salads: fresh, sautéed tuna or salmon on Boston bibb lettuce and tossed salad or broccoli slaw.  Family and friends love this kidney bean recipe.  Dolly

I used 1/2 the mayo and sweet relish that the recipe called for, and still think I could have used less. While this recipe is fine, I think it could use something else. I added a clove garlic and a bit of Dijon mustard to give it some more flavour, but it needs further tweaking still. I will probably make it again, but will have to keep experimenting with the right combination of ingredients.

I used Miracle Whip in lieu of mayo, and not so much of it - used 3 eggs, and purple onion, added chopped green pepper and a dash of ACV. Very tasty, and simple!

yum..yum..yum.. I thought it might be bland, but it was very tasty even before chilling.  I added finely diced green pepper and cubes of cheddar cheese.   I also mixed red and yellow onion for color and it enhanced the taste.  I will definitely be making this again!

Love this recipe. However, I did make a few changes. I left out the relish since my husband doesn't care for it. I did add fresh chopped parsley, another hard boiled egg and a sprinkling of paprika. I, too, used green onions for a milder flavor.  My family and friends love it. I serve it with baked ham or turkey, since it's goes so well with leftovers/sandwiches.

I felt this salad was lacking in flavor, so I added some chili powder and cumin to give it a kick.  Another reviewer suggested curry, which I will try next.  This is a good, easy, basic cold salad that just needs something else to perk it up!

This is exactly the recipe I've been looking for.  Tastes just like my mother's.  I substituted green pepper for the celery, mainly because I didn't have any celery.  I agree with others that it was way too much mayonnaise.  I suggest adding a dollop at a time until it is the consistency that you want.

This was a hit!! I was in a hurry to make it and didn't have time to boil eggs so I left them out.  I added a little more celery and used dill relish instead.  So yummy and went perfect with our BLTs.

The secret to this recipe is to mash the hard boiled eggs with the mayo, basically making egg salad and then add the other ingredients. I am also cut the mayo by using some plain greek yogurt.  Be generous with the mayo/yogurt - adding more or less to suit.  The end result should be a nice creamy salad.  Everyone will want to know the recipe!

Soooo Good and Easy to make! I substitute a couple of things for this recipe:  I use a dill pickle instead of relish, use green onions instead of a regular onion and I add about a teaspoon for a little more zest lessening the mayo.  It's a little healthier and the dill pickle adds another layer of crunch.

Very good, healthy recipe. The only advice I would give is to not use too much onion; otherwise, it will overpower the rest of the ingredients. I used light mayo, and it came out great and tasted even better after a couple of days.

This is my new favorite salad for the summer of 2012! I loved it . . .  I sat down to have a bit for lunch and ended up eating the entire bowl. I love beans, so I was pretty sure I would like it, but the flavor is amazing. I think it might be the combination of eggs and relish along with the beans??? Regardless, this recipe is a keeper.

This recipe has also been a favorite in my family for decades. The only difference is that we add a pinch of cayenne pepper for a little kick and a dash of mustard.  It's best served cold and after the flavors have a chance to blend together.

Great recipe, this has been a quick fix summer salad in my family for years. I dontt use onions or celerly and use chopped sweet pickles in place of sweet relish. Add Mayo to desired consistancy. I'ts a winner, thanks for sharing.

I just made this recipe and I like it very much.  I'm going to try red onions the next time though, I need to kick it up a notch (I may have lived in the south too long).

I was reluctant to try this one because of it mostly just being kidney beans but it was great with the eggs. I'd probably season the dressing more next time.

We had a bunch of kidney beans so we used them with this recipe.  It's a pretty good mix.  Used soy mayo rather than the real stuff and it turned out well.  Will make again.

I liked this until I added the mayo - I didn't care for the flavor, and it made it really unappetizing looking. Would make again, but without the mayo obviously. Thanks.
