I have been a student of German for 10 years now. This is the best recipe I have found for Lebkuchen in these ten years. My college professor commented that they taste authintic (he's German) and I also won my boyfriend's heart (or should I say stomach) over with these. My daughter also loved helping me.

The recipe did really well until I added the sesame oil...the sesame overwhelmed the entire mixture.  I am wondering if I used the correct type of sesame oil.

Very authentic, and easy to use.  I have been looking for a practical Lebkuchen recipe for years, but never found one that properly converted the measurements, ingredients and temperatures for English/American use.
I used this recipe this year for Christmas, with much success.
The Lebkuchen produced by this recipe can also be used to make a Lebkuchen house.

This is very good, I made this Sat. and I didn't have light seseme oil, I used toasted seseme,it was alittle heavy covering taste of spices, its still turned out good but definately use LIGHT oil in this, also, there is a break in the flour mix with the oil, and then add spices, best thing to do is mix your spices in with the flour mixture, make sure your dry ingredients are all mixed evenly together then add the wet. But its very good....

An excellent recipe. The dough, however,turned out a bit dry and crumbly(almost like streusel topping). By adding 1/4 cup of orange juice the mix held together resulting in a fine product. Added sugar glaze to the 24 pieces, stored in 2 layers each in 2 tin cans. Kuchen looks "yummy". Can hardly await the sampling in 2 weeks.

This was a very tasty recipe I may have actually used more spices..... I've never made a "quick bread" without eggs so I got nervous and added one..... it came out fine..... The recipe may look odd but it turns out nice. I think the general idea of this cake especially without the egg.... is for a honey spicey cakey brownie..... chewy and dense like a brownie...... very yummy..... I iced mine with a simple sugar (confectioners sugar) icing... although its sweet enought without it. I also ommitted the candied fruit and added rasisins and almonds..... I also think this cake would be nice with nothing (rasins almond etc.) Don't put too much icing (if you use icing) it will be too sweet.

These turned out really good but not as good as what my dad made.  Being a little homesick they did hit the spot.  Thank you.

I love this. Most recipes make drop cookies, which is a modern update, but not what I was looking for.  As for commenters who have used sesame oil, there are TWO types of sesame oil available.  One is roasted and is used in Asian cooking, especially Chinese and Korean cuisine. The roasted oil is dark brown in color. The other is a clear cooking oil used widely in South Asia because it doesn't have as distinct a flavor as mustard oil, coconut oil and isn't as unhealthy or expensive as ghee.

Dense, spicy, not too sweet, excellent with black coffee. The spiciness mellowed nicely after two weeks. I didn't have enough honey so I substituted molasses, and it worked fine. I didn't like the store-bought dried peel that I used, so next time I'm going to experiment with other options. A really nice recipe, and I'll definitely make this again.

I wasn't sure of what type of sesame oil and I only had toasted on hand.  I used about a 1/4 of that and the rest canola oil to make the teaspoon.  Tasted great!

My parents are from Germany and we always celebrated Christmas with German Christmas baking. My favorite is Lebkuchen. I have tried this recipe and love the amount of spices in the recipe. I replaced the candied fruit with dried cranberries and did not add the sesame oil as I do not remember this being in previous recipes. I remember a thicker Lebkuchen though. This one is thinner. It baked well and I am looking forward to trying it.
