Let the fish marinate in the orange juice about 4 hours, with a few sprinkles of pepper and other seasonings, then reduced the marinade in a pan on the stovetop and used that concentrated OJ for the topping and baking the fish. Used regular bread crumbs and a reduced amount of dried basil for the topping. 15 minutes in the oven was just about right.  Delicious and great flavor!

I just wanted to add a note here for everyone that you can substitute the butter for 1 tbsp of extra virgin olive oil and it tastes great! Or you can do This classic sauce of sauteed butter, parsley and lemon juice is fantastic. Definitely saute the garlic or else it will taste too raw, even after it's baked. I have used this sauce for almost all types of fish- true cod, halibut, basa, tilapia, sole, trout, and salmon. All tasted superb. ALWAYS increase the garlic. For 4 filets, I use 3 large cloves, 3-4 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoon lemon juice. Just make sure you always have less lemon juice than butter or else it will taste too lemony -even when doubling/tripling it. For a large filet of salmon, I triple the amount. Lightly salt and pepper the fish for more flavor and I sometimes add 2-3 tablespoon of buttered bread crumbs or finely crushed (buttered) ritz crackers for an extra crunch. And of course, fresh parsley is better than dried and use real butter, never margarine. 3 stars for original recipe, 5 stars for slight alterations. Simple and flavorful marinade that still lets the flavor of the fish shine through. TIP- do NOT bake for 30 min, especially tilapia, which is so thin. High temperature, quick cooking time is a rule of thumb for all fish. For this, I did 400*f., for 10-12 min (at most!). If filets are super thin, try 8-10 min. I like it thank's for the recipe to play with. Grpa

Excellent recipe, just make sure to put it under the broiler to get a nice crunch on top. I also used freshly squeezed orange juice and some zest for extra orange flavor. It was delicious paired with some orange glazed carrots and rice with orange zest, cranberries and pistachios. Yum.

Tilapia is such a mild fish that unless you top it with something that’s a bit bold, it can end up bland, and unfortunately, I think that’s what happened here.  I marinated the fish for 4 hours, poured additional OJ over the fish before the topping went on and it went into the oven, and I found there was no orange flavor at all...real disappointment.  If I were to make this again, I wouldn’t mix the chopped basil into the topping, rather, sprinkle it on after the fish came out of the oven which I think will ramp up the flavor a bit.  Also, I baked for 15 minutes, the topping hadn’t browned at all, so I put it under the broiler briefly to get some color and give it some eye appeal.  Of course, I then ended up overcooking the fish.  If I were to make this again, I’d probably cook the fish for about 12 minutes, allowing for some time under broiler to brown the topping, and then not overcooking the fish.  It wasn’t bad, it simply didn’t have much flavor, and it wasn’t really good, either..  SuperN, sorry, wish I’d been able to give your recipe a better review.

First of all -- Don't discard the mainade!   Pour it in  pan, boil it and reduce it slighly for a few minutes before adding a pinch of cornstarch to thicken it up to a glaze.   I drizzled this over my end product and voila!   Amazing.   And it adds the mildest flavor or orange.   I'm not sure you'd taste any orange otherwise and I marinated it over night.  (Would I even bother wth that step next time?   Hmmmm...)  The grocery store did not have tilapia at the tme, so I picked up a pound of filet of sole.   Worked great.   Sole is super thin, so I broiled it start to finish for about 5 minutes.   Toasts the crust up nicely as well.    If you're a garlic lover -- triple it.   If you're a salt person, this will need a sprinkling of that as well at the end.  A really wonderful and light fish dinner.

I'm 33, attended culinary school in college and always hated fish. I hate the smell, the taste and the texture. Finally, my husband of 5 years talked me into trying talapia. I followed this recipe. Turned out delishious! I love

I used 1 pound of Tilapia (6 pieces). The butter seemed like too much, so I substituted aro9und 3 Tbsp of olive oil. I followed another reviewers suggestion, and reduced the orange juice form the marinade to around a half cup on the stove, then poured it over the fillets. The bread crumbs on the top were nicely browned with out using the broiler at around 13 minutes. The fish was moist, flavorful, and delicious. We served it with rice and broccoli. (ANd a nice bottle of wine :) )

This was really good. I'm not big on seafood,  but,  my fiancee is. We loved it. I used Italian seasoning instead of Basil,  and Orange/Pineapple/Banana juice instead of straight OJ, and Italian flavored Panko crumbs instead of plain...but,  followed the measurements and cooking times...very good.

Just OK, Quick, and usually have ingredients on hand. Thought there was to much butter in the topping.

so my husband and I have recently started trying to eat better and this is the first recipe of fish that I tried from Allrecipes. it turned out pretty great. I did follow some of the reviews and I used the marinade and boiked it down with a bit of cornstarch and made it into a glaze. Also I left the basil off until the very end and added some Valencia orange peel seasoning at the very end. I didn't need to put the broiler on but I don't think it would hurt anything. the only thing I would say is that I personally would definitely cut down on the amount of butter used in the panko crumbs topping. though I did adjust the amount from 4 fillets to 6 fillets. so maybe if you just stuck with the amount of butter called for with the four fillets you'll be just fine. Other than that I put it on a bed of spinach greens with rosemary potatoes and string beans and it was a big hit.

I just made this dish. Not bad at all. Prep work was very easygoing, hard to mess it up. For me, I would suggest a more meaty of a fish next time I would make this dish. Not knowing what to expect for the final product I thought that the butter topping would have melted a lot more than what it did. Maybe a few tweaks to the topping and that's about it. Delicious all the same.

Followed recipe pretty close - did add the red pepper - but I'd go from 1/8 to 1/4 tsp. -- also, used cilantro instead of basil- and finally, crisped it up at end of cooking by turning on broiler ( HI ) for 3-4 minutes - made the topping crunchy and good.  overall, pretty good recipe for tilapia.

Only marinated for half hour, added lemon & lime juice to panko mix which I liked a lot! Probably no need to discard marinade so would use it next time. Definitely needs little salt & pepper but super easy and would make it again as always looking for ways to cook tilapia! Yummmmm

Marinated the Tilapia in OJ, garlic, and dried basil all day.  I sauteed the garlic in 1/2 the butter and olive oil.  Added the marinate with a pinch of red pepper powdered and reduced it to a thick sauce.  I added fresh basil to the sauce.  I salted by fish and covered them in Gluten Free Panko, poured the sauce over it with some more fresh basil.  I cooked it uncovered in the oven.  My family loved it!!!! Huge hit.  Trying this with chicken next time

This was a great change to cooking tilapia!  I took others' advice and added 1/8 t red pepper flakes to the orange juice.  I was also concerned that the orange juice wasn't strong enough so I used concentrate and only added 2 cans of water instead of 3.  That made for a stronger marinade.  The taste was subtle and the sweetness of the juice and the slight hotness of the red pepper was perfect.  It's definitely a keeper!!

I read the one existing review for this recipe and thought... Hmmmm maybe I shouldn't make it. But then I figured ah, what the heck!!!  So I used the review to help me in my modifications... I basically followed the recipe exactly EXCEPT I replaced the fresh garlic with half a packet of onion soup mix since I noticed that there really wasn't any other seasoning included in the recipe. And I used dried basil instead of fresh. We actually really liked this recipe ... It is fresh tasting with a hint of sweetness from the juice.  A definite do-over for us!!

I followed the recipe exactly and was very happy with the results. The fish is mild, but that's fine by me as the orange, garlic, and basil combination made for an excellent flavor. I'll be making this one again.

Followed recipe exactly but broiled for 5 minutes at the end to get a nice crunch on the topping. I recommend doing that. This recipe was fantastic. Looking forward to making again.

There's a somewhat similar dish I remember from a Middle Eastern cookbook, except that it's fried. Grated orange zest, finely chopped parsley and crushed pistachio kernels are mixed with fresh white breadcrumbs. Fairly thin fish fillets are then floured, dipped in beaten egg and coated in the crumbs before being fried in a mixture of butter and olive oil. Excess fat is poured off, the pan deglazed with orange juice and the resulting sauce poured over the fish immediately before serving. Crunchy, juicy and utterly delicious!

I liked it ... agree that it needed a little kick though. I did put a mango salsa on top which helped a lot! For my husband, it was too sweet though.

Simple and good. Didn't have orange juice so used what I had on hand which was pineapple juice. Didn't have time to marinate which prob would be so good, but I dry rubbed with the spices then poured the juice around then basted half way through. Great base recipe that can be modified with what's on stock!

Delish! I made this tonight and loved it! I am currently doing WW (weight watchers) so I substituted 'I Can't Believe It's Not Butter' spray for the butter. Also, I didn't have just orange juice, so I used pineapple orange juice and marinated about 4 hours. I used regular bread crumbs and minced garlic. A delicious recipe that's easy to make!

This was pretty tasty.  I think I put more garlic in than called for and that made it extra tasty.  I also added grated orange rind zest to the bread crumbs which gave it a nice orange flavor.  Generally a great recipe.   Oh...I cooked it a bit longer since I had alot in the pan, they were still great and the top was nice and crispy.

It was a nice, easy dish that turned out pretty tasty. I would have added salt and pepper to the marinated filets before putting the butter mixture on top. I don't know, but I needed to add another 10 minutes to my baking to get my fish to be flakey.

This was just okay. I put some orange zest in ours for a more pronounced orange flavor, which was great. What we didn’t care for was the topping, it took putting the oven on broil for 5 minutes to get it to brown. I think I would omit the 1/2 cup extra of orange juice that it cooks in, next time. Otherwise taste wise this was good.

Good basic to start from - added orange zest, red pepper flakes, dried basil, tumeric, salt & pepper to marinade.  Saved the marinade to do the reduction suggested by others....used less butter with breadcrumbs.  Served it over a bed of lightly sauteed swiss chard that I poured the reduced marinade over.  Lovely, light flavor - with a bit more complexity from adding spices.  Everyone loved it - will make again.

Tilapia is a pretty bland fish, flavor-wise, but this had a lovely hint of orange. The panko crumbs gave it a nice soft crunch.  I will definitely add this to the dinner rotation.

I made this and substituted fresh squeezed ruby red grapefruit juice for the orange juice. It was really good. My 11 year old said it just disappeared off her plate. Using fresh squeezed juice gives you little chunks of pulp and they just added more flavor to the end result. Only marinated for a couple of hours, it was still full of flavor.

Great recipe! Was looking for something different than the norm to make for dinner.  This recipe was simple & delicious.  I used a peach mango juice instead of OJ because it's what I had on hand.  I was pleasantly surprised that the juice was not an overpowering flavor despite letting the fish soak in it overnight.  I also used fresh basil from my garden, just cut it in small pieces.  I had to bake the fish a little longer than what the recipe called for. I will definitely make again.

I'm not a fish lover by any means, but I eat it because it's good for me. But this recipe made the tilapia delicious mainly I think because of the breadcrumb topping. Two small changes I made were I didn't use as much orange juice as called for (1/2 cup) just before putting into oven, and when I made the panko topping I melted the butter instead of softening it (that seemed like it would make it too difficult to sprinkle on top of the fish). Next time I would make a little more of the topping it was so good. I served it with a Watercress, Avocado and Orange Salad recipe I found on the Food Network site. Beautiful presentation, and very refreshing!

Fish was too wet. Will try cooking on a cookie cooking rack placed in a jelly pan next time. Also, orange juice reduction was too runny after ten minutes of boiling. Will cook longer next time or try a different juice.Paired this with the Romaine and Mandarin Orange Salad with Poppy Seed Dressing from this site.

The only exception to the recipe was that I sprinkled Old Bay on both sides of the fish before baking it. Tilapia is such a mild fish, it needs A LOT of flavor. It didn't have as much orange flavor as I was expecting. My kids liked it but it wasn't their favorite, neither mine.

Tasted great, the last 5 mins of cooking I put it under the broiler to crisp up.  For the topping I mixed left-over pesto with orange juice and breadcrumbs, very easy and delicious

I used salmon steaks instead of tilapia. Did not put more orange juice on the salmon after they marinated. Used 3T of butter and 1 cup of bread crumbs and a teaspoon of basil paste instead of fresh basil along with the 3T of orange juice and minced garlic. Next time will add more salt. Very good!

My husband likes fish and even he didn't like this. I don't like fish so i am a bit biased. I took one bite and had to spit it out. I don't know what happened, but the flavors didn't mesh with the fish. the orange juice made the panko soggy and weirdly clumpy. just a bad blend of flavors i guess.

Great recipe except I prefer a crisper topping.  Next time in last 5 or 8 minutes will put on broil. Will definitely fix again. By the way, I put a teaspoon of Creole seasoning in orange juice to marinate overnight.

This was sooo delicious. I didn't marinate in freezer but only marinated it in fridge for 30 minutes. I agree with another person here, I put it in broiler for 4 minutes to get the crust real golden brown and crisp. I did add some Parmesan cheese to the crust, not much 1tble spoon and I did season with salt and pepper and added a dash of lemon and orange zest as another person here did. LOVE IT!

This recipe has great not too sweet flavor. I had to substitute unsweetened finely shredded coconut for the bread crumbs because I needed gluten free. I did reduce the sauce on the stove top as recommended by a review as my fillets were very thin and cooked quickly. I also placed the cooking pan high in the oven close to the heating element to allow for a bit of browning.

The kiddos didn't like it, but they wouldn't know delicious if it smacked them in the face! I broiled the fish to make the best part :the crunchy topping. I only marinated for an hour,  don't know if it made much difference. I did reduce the orange juice marinade afterwards with cornstarch, but the cornstarch turned lumpy. Yuck for texture,  yum on taste. Will make it again for sure.

I marinated it for 8 hrs. Gotta say, it did have an orangie flavor. No one liked it.  And the flavor was very bland. No flavor.

Every time that  I make this recipe I never seem to make enough. I usually only let the recipe marinate for a few hours. (I'm pretty terrible at meal planning). I have yet to serve it to anyone who hasn't loved it.

Loved it! I wish I had marinated it overnight like the recipe suggested.

Good flavor, but surely took longer to prepare the mixture than is listed.  Seemed to be too much orange juice too cook in, and my mixture seemed soggy.

It may have been just me..I'm rather new to cooking up stuff like this.  Again, it was good..but wasn't exactly what I expected.  Not sure Id go through all the trouble again to make this one.

Yum! I added a little more garlic and did what someone else suggested and baked it for 13 min then broiled for 3. I sprinkled some extra panko on top before I baked so they would get crispy. I made some extra of the butter mixture and reduced it with some orange juice in a sauce pan and it was delicious drizzled over the side dishes.  Made with Israeli couscous with toasted almonds and dried cranberries. Will definitely be making again.

Good! Next time I am going to replace 1/2 the butter with mayo. We made it in the grill for 15 mins.

Very good. Broil leftovers - even better. Ok with salmon, but tilapia is better

My husband loved this.  Me not so much, but will probably be making it again.  Made a sauce of orange marmalade, a little spicy brown mustard, and horseradish to serve along side.

Used hog fish,  3 fillets.  Used about 3 cloves of garlic and added orange zest to the topping mixture.  Salted fish before adding topping.  Really liked it,  had to broil at end for about 5 or 6 minutes to brown. The oj in the baking pan turned into a sauce.  Tried making a sauce with the marinade but ruined it with too much cornstarch which became lumpy. Great recipe, nice orange buttery crunchy flavor.  My 10yo son ate all his fish,  he liked it,  so that means it's good!

This was okay.  I did take another reader's suggestion and made sauce from the leftover marinate which saved the dish.  I doubt we'll be making this again.

After reading all of the reviews (thank you s_march), I marinated the Tilapia for a full four hours in an OJ with just a pinch of red pepper flakes. As suggested by BARNKITTY I reduced the marinade by about a third then baked it a full 14 minutes. It was very good and would prepare again.

I found it easy to prepare. The flavor was not strong enough. I was only able to marinade for half hour though, that could make a difference. Otherwise it was delicious.

It was pretty good did what the recipe said except for dried basil instead but it did take me more than 15 minutes for baking and I think next time I will try broil first a little like the first guy said.  Otherwise this was good and had sweet taste from orange juice.
