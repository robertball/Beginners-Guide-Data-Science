This turned out pretty good.  It was extremely easy when I used my mini food processor to chop everything up.  I used a red bell pepper instead of pimento peppers, and used fresh seranos as well.  One person asked me for the recipe.  The plate got cleaned up fast even though I made enough for 35 people.  Used fresh Trader Joes salsa, and decorated with cherry tomatoes and parsley for a stunning platter!  Thanks for telling me to double the cream.  I did, or else it would have never been enough.  Next time, I will double the rest of the ingredients as well.  Made 8 12" tortillas, spread thin.
I have made this over and over and over from requests from friends at pot lucks to the point that I am tired of making it, but all my vegetarian friends love this a lot! And, it is never enough!  They always ask me to make more.  I usually use twice the amount recommended for the number of people attending... and it is the first dish to go.  I serve it with fresh salsa from trader joes, very nicely presented in a chip and dip platter. A little time consuming if you are making that much, but worth it for the folks that love it.  Try it! I gave it only 4 stars initially (I thought it was good but not stunning), but everyone has loved it so much, that I must update to 5 stars.

A co-worker of mine had made some similiar to these, however without the hot sauce.  I only put in 1 T. of hot sauce and thought they were spicy enough.  I also added 1 T. Ranch Dressing Mix.  They were great and everyone loved them.

This is fabulous.  An aquaintance of mine from many years back used to make these for parties and I was glad to come across the recipe again.  For all of you out there who have a problem with the oozing, after mixing all the ingredients together, refrigerate for about one hour before spreading on tortillas.  If the mixture starts going soft again, stop and refrigerate some more before spreading again, I found this helps alot, especailly for those of you who like it to be thick.  DELICIOUS!

These are perfect for Christmas parties since you have white cream cheese, red pimentos and green chile peppers.  Very delicious.  I like to double the recipe during the holidays then only do step one and freeze the logs.  When I have a party to attend or throw, I defrost that day and cut when I get to the party.  I serve Salsa on the side. Thanks for the great appetizer!

This is the perfect make ahead app.  Very nice when you need an app that doesn't need the oven for baking or reheating.  I sometimes use creole seasoning instead of the hot sauce.  And I always serve salsa on the side.  Guests love them.  My family thinks they don't like black olives, so I use about 1/2 can.  When my they asked what's in them I said cream cheese, mexican chiles, and seasoning.  They eat them with gusto, none the wiser.

I have made these multiple times for various occasions.  I have not found one person that does not love them, and I have a hard time not eating all of them before I serve them!  This is a great recipe and you can not use some of the ingredients and still have a delicious result.

Love this recipe! I actually increase the amounts to make enough to cater 200 people.  I also add some shredded cheddar cheese to the mixture and lay 2 slices (side by side)of lean lunchmeat ham before rolling.  This is an easy appetizer to make for any gathering; wedding, shower, tailgate, graduation, holiday, etc.  
For catering I use:
3 lbs. cream cheese, 15 oz. can black olives, 20 oz. diced green chilies (drained), 20 oz. diced pimento (drained), 10 green onions, 3/4 c. Frank's Red Hot Pepper Sauce, 3/4 c. fresh cilantro, chopped, 2 c. finely shredded cheddar cheese, 4 (24oz.) pkgs. sliced ham and 40 tortillas.  Spread 6 T. of mixture on each tortilla. (A little more than 1/3 c. but less than 1/2 c.) Lay 2 slices of ham side by side. Trim tortilla along the long sides of the ham and roll from bottom to top. Chill until ready to slice and serve.

Delish! Excellent with or without cilantro.  I use only 2 T. of hot pepper sauce.  My husband always begs me to double the recipe so we will have leftovers.  Even when I do, sorry honey... all gone!  These are a definite crowd pleaser... they're always gone in a flash!

3 TBLS OF HOT SAUCE!?! Yikes-now that's spicy!! Although I did not use NEARLY that much pepper sauce (I did it the smarter way, added a few dashes at a time and mixed until I could taste the heat that we prefer). But as I was "taste-testing" - I thought to myself that they were kinda "boring" (other than the spice attack on your tongue). I made one tortilla roll-up and still thought they were boring SO I added a little taco seasoning (homemade, also from this site) and mixed it in. A little better but now my taco spice addition reminded me of those 7-layer taco dips instead of a roll-up-with a kick. These are okay but it is unlikely that these will ever show up on my appetizer tray. Thanks anyways!!

These were okay, but would've been improved by a salsa dipping sauce-- I forgot to put it out. They were rather plain looking, maybe they would've been improved by using spinach or tomato tortillas (for color). I probably won't make these again, they just don't have anything really special to offer.

INCREDIBLE!!!  LOOK NO FURTHER--THIS IS THE RECIPE!!  I made this for an after-church fellowship and they were gone in a flash!  Even the kids ate them!  I altered the dish a little...try it:
add (1) yellow/orange pepper
add 1/4 cup Pace Medium salsa
double cream cheese
After rolled, and ready to cut:
top each hor'd'euvre with a (light) spoonful of crushed nacho tortilla chip mix
The mix: 2-3 handfuls of regular nacho tortilla chips, some salt and pepper to taste.  Put in plastic bag and cruch with rolling pin.  Mix well in bag.  Spoon out to top each sliced roll.  For a colorful topping, use dyed nacho chips. KEEP THIS HANDY--IT'S A HOSPITALITY STAPLE!!

Love 'em! Served them at a party with salsa & everyone raved about them! They have just the right mix of spiciness.  
**I did have some issues with rolling them though & found that trimming the round edges of the tortilla to make it square before filling really helped.

I have always enjoys work picnic because my boss made these divine, creamy, jalapeno tortillas.  I don't care for olives and so left them out but follow the remainder of the recipe to a T.  I choose not to rill these up but to layer tortilla, spread, tortilla, spread, etc.. ,refrigerate and slice into wedges with a pizza cutter.  I also serve with chunky salsa. 
I have made these three times, for friends and family, in the last week and have plans to make them for a get together next week.

One note: Be sure and DRAIN WELLl when the recipe says drain. Or it's a bit soupy. Also, I added some sunflower seeds for a surprise crunch and it was a BIG HIT! I also served with 3 different types of salsa: sweet (mango), regular, and roasted. DELICIOUS!

Yum!  Definitely a keeper for parties because it can be made a day ahead.  When I opened the can of diced chilis they seemed too mushy, so I substituted with a fresh mild pepper finely minced.  The pimientos I replaced with chopped green olives stuffed with pimientos.  Also added a squeeze of lime juice.  I only sliced a few tortillas at a time and kept refreshing my platter during the party.  So easy!

I love this recipe since it is SO versatile. Switch out the black olives for green, add some ham & BAM! You've got Cuban roll ups. These are fantastic just the way they are though. The only thing that I find is that I need 2 packages of cream cheese. If only one is used, then there isn't enough to spread, then we have ended up with too much tortilla than filling. Thanks for posting!

These are delicious and easy to make.  I served them at a party and have been asked by many guests for the recipe.  I would recommend using a another 2 - 3 ounces of cream cheese as the filling ran out before the tortillas.

This recipe was okay.  My husband complained that they tasted bitter.  I followed this recipe exactly as it was written and found that three tablespoons of cilantro was probably too much.  I also had to spread the cheese mixture pretty thin to cover ten 10-inch tortillas.

Super yummy & very easy!!
They do seem a bit soggy after sitting over night, so I'd recommend to make only a few hours in advance.

Not a hit at my party for Thanksgiving. The flavor was good, but I guess I was hoping for a more substantial roll.  I also added 1 more package of cream cheese since I had 10 tortillas to do. Otherwise, the spread would be very thin on them thus making the roll up smaller. They were so small in general once I rolled them up in the tortilla. I wish I can find the recipe for Costco's Hye roll-ups. Those are delish! Sorry, I'm going to look for another roll-up recipe for next time.

Maybe I did something wrong?  These did not taste very good...I didn't have dipping sauce with it...maybe that made the difference.

Great recipe.Had to bring something to the office for a Mexican pot luck birthday lunch. Read the reviews & double the cream cheese for sure & use only one tablespoon of pepper sauce.Had to keep my husband at arms length but he stole some anyway. Said where's mine?? 
 My co-workers raved over this & ate them all.

These are always a hit at parties.  The only thing I didn't have on hand was the sliced pimento peppers, so I used a red bell pepper chopped very finely The hot pepper sauce livens it up just enough so they're more interesting than just the cream cheese flavor.  My group of friends loved them, but if it were more than 4 people or so, I would double the recipe.

Replaced pimento with red pepper, replaced green chilis with half a jalapeneo pepper, best thing ever, great to pack in luches as well, or stuff into celery.

This recipe is awesome, everyone requests it for a function.  I dont use black olives, dont like, use diced jalepenos instead of green chilis, lots of hot sauce and double the cream cheese.

I used diced red pepper instead of the pimento.  Was wonderful, and still had that little splash of red color.

I thought these were good. I followed the recipe, except I used 12 oz of cream cheese. I think next time I make it, I will spread the mixture, then top it with fine shredded cheese and then roll.

Excellent! I fixed 60 servings and had nothing left. People loved these. I added hot salsa on the side which really finished them off. I used half the cilantro and that was plenty the flavor was really strong. I was a little worried about all the overpowering ingrediants but it came out perfect.

This is a great recipe. I have had it in my recipe box for years. For a bit of different flavor, try adding a few dashes of  garlic powder (the kind with parsley bits in it). It' great!

This is the best.  My husband didn't think he would like it, boy was he wrong.  Everyone was asking for the recipe.  I did change it a bit, by doubling the cream cheese.  Be sure to spread the mixture thin or it oozes out.  Only one of the kids didn't like it, but she's a very pickey eater.

Used Spinach Herb tortillas, did add a tbs of dry ranch, but it wasn't necessary, used 2 tbs of hot sauce (Franks's) and that seemed like PLENTY, might even go with only 1 tbs next time.  Thinner layer is better than thicker layer and I made 4 wraps, sliced in 1 inch spirals can feed a lot.  It was pretty but I don't know if they were good enough to make again.

These roll-ups were really good. I doubled the cream cheese in this recipe as previous reviewers had recommended.  I served these at a party and they were a big hit.

I just made these for our Superbowl party. I made the filling the night before and rolled them the following morning. So easy to make! I didn't get alot of feed back from them, however, the tray was gone. I doubled the cream cheese as others suggested and I still did not have enough for 10 10' tortillas. I was only able to fill 5. Next time, I will either triple the cream cheese and double the rest or use smaller tortillas. I will definitely make again!

This was great!   I added a little more cilantro and a handful of FINELY shredded cheddar cheese - only because I had some and wanted to use it up.  After reading another review, I added 1/2 of a ranch dressing seasoning packet.  This helped pull it together a little (a lot of the ingredients add water even if you drain).  I also found that it cut the "sour" taste tobasco sauce has for me.   I think this recipe is a 5 star AS IS - but if you tweak it to your personal taste - can't go wrong!!

This was a very simple recipe! I added an envelope of taco seasoning to the cream cheese and beat that together before adding to the rest of the ingredients. I also added grated mexican cheese. It was wonderful, thanks for the recipe!

I really liked the flavor of these rollups. They were definitely spicy and delicious! The only negative I have about them is they tend to get really soggy if you save them in the fridge overnight. I was looking forward to indulging the next day and was disappointed to find the tortillas were completely soggy, giving them a mushy consistency. Yuck. Otherwise, they were great - I just wouldn't plan on keeping the leftovers.

Very good, but I made a few changes. No cilantro, cut WAY back on the tabasco, added an extra green onion, and used spinach and tomato tortillas for color. I also added about 1 tbsp of fiesta ranch dip mix which really gave it a great flavor. The recipe as-is covers about 8 tortillas (not 10). I doubled it for my two parties.

Very easy to prepare and makes a lot, which is nice for a gathering.  I put 6 party picks in each tortilla before I cut them, then arranged them on a platter.  Next party, I'll double the recipe.

I have to say I was skeptical when I first read this recipe that it could get such a high rating with those ingredients. But it is incredible. I have made them twice and there is not one left on the plate. I do put more of the mixture in each tortilla, but that is just a preference. Superb!

Solid, easy, good flavor. The hot sauce gives it a nice kick. I'd use smaller tortillas next time. Living in Texas, most every grocery store makes tortillas in house that are smaller and fresher than the mass-produced kind. I'd recommend those, plus the filling will create a larger pinwheel. Set out the cream cheese for a while! It is hard to whip while still the least bit firm.

I have made these several times as a "go to" last minute appetizer. The only complaint I have is that you really need to use an extra container of cream cheese, because when you spread the mixture onto tortillas, you need extra for the edges. Otherwise you end up with ends that have no filling in them.

Fantastic!  I used whole wheat tortillas which was the only thing I change.  Caution: the recipe as published will in no way give you 60 one inch pieces.  I doubled the recipe and even spread thin got about 3dz pieces.

Awful! They taste like you mixed every pickled item in your house with cream cheese and thought the idea would be better by rolling it in a tortilla! There's no substance to them, you can't cut them without spewing the contents all over, they're salty and briney, just all together not good. I'm also not please that I spent $20. to buy all the ingredients.  Atleast I wasn't banking solely on this dish to be the hit of my party.

These are great! I ended up using 1 & a half blocks of cream cheese, no pimentos, 2 tbsp of cilantro, & only 1 tbsp of hot sauce. (I left the other ingredients the same.) I was able to make 7 large tortillas. Next time, I will use more hot sauce, and two blocks of cream cheese. 

I also spread a small amount of filling I had leftover on a slice of french bread & toasted it in the oven for a few minutes for my lunch. Yummy!

This was not great. Its the first time since I started using this website more than two years ago, that I disagreed with such a large number of positive reviews. However, most of the ingredients in this recipe are canned, and that is how the final product tastes...like it was full of canned and processed stuff...not good.

Following other suggestions, I refrigerated the mixture for an hour before assembling the rollups. They were still a bid runny, but had great flavor. I used minced red onion and added a handful of shredded cheddar cheese. Omitted the cilantro, as I don't like it.

Made these as written except omitted the pimentos. Hubby said they were "just OK". No one in my family was too excited about them. They weren't bad, but didn't show me anything special either. Won't be making them again.

Thank you for the ideas, I was able to take this recipe, followed all steps.  Then I did a second flavor roll-up using one of my spice packets I got at our local home and garden show roasted red pepper.  Both flavors had rave reviews at the birthday party I took them too.

Made this recipe for a baby shower at work.  Only had 1/2 a block of cream cheese so I added a dollop of sour cream and split the recpe in 1/2.  Didn't have the cilantro on hand but turned out tasty anyway.  Has a nice kick to it without being too "spicy."  Next time I think I will do as other members and add some shredded cheese.  Will make again.   **Update: I let this sit in the fridge overnight before taking to the shower and they became "spicer" overnight.  Still a good recipe but will cut back on the pepper sauce if making a day in advance.

I got a lot of compliments on these at a party. I left out the green chiles because they smelled really weird. Other than that, the recipe is great as is.

These were great, but you have to double all ingredients to fill your tortillas. Suggestion: Use spinach tortillas for extra color!

I really thought these were great, as did my guests. Just make sure to really finely chop up the green onions.  Nice balance of hot with the chilis, and cool with the cream cheese. I used a flavored tortilla (spinach) and I thought that was a good touch as well.

This recipe was excellent - served at a party and everybody swooped down on them, gobbled them up and demanded the recipe.  They have a bit on zing to them - I also mixed up my own simple dip for them.  I combined some salsa in a jar with sour cream and sprinkled cilantro on top - everybody wanted this simple recipe as well.  Enjoy!!!
PS - I made them the night before and cut them the next day - they turned out great!!!

I gave this 5 stars because it was a big hit at my last party. I would rate it less because I had to make changes but none the less it was good. I also recommend doubling the cream cheese and add the hot sauce to your taste. It got great compliments because the cream cheese balanced the hot nicely. I mixed cream cheese with hot sauce and hot peppers then sprinkled scallions, olives and red peppers in a line pattern before rolling so they looked great when rolled and cut.

Wow! These little nibbles are really good! I make tortilla pinwheels alot for parties and such, but had never tried this recipe. These definitely brought rave reviews from my co-workers, and I will make them again for functions in the future! Oh, by the way, the recipe calls for 3 tblsp. of hot sauce. I thought this was a little too much, especially for a company function. I only used 2 tblsp. and this was plenty. They were still very spicy. Thanks for the recipe!

These are really easy to make and yummy to eat!!!

They were a little soupy (make sure you drain the chiles and pimentos well!!!
I added more cream cheese to make the mixture more spreadable and it worked wonders!

I have made the twice now and the only thing I do different is I double the cream cheese and I use a can of diced jalapeno's instead of the pepper sauce.  I cannot tell you how many people have asked for the recipe and they always eat every bit of them. Great recipe!

Good for a quick and easy appetizer, but nothing spectacular flavor-wise when eaten by itself.  A dipping sauce is a must with these, otherwise its just like most other roll up recipes.

These were simple to make, but in the end we weren't impressed.  I only used 1Tbs of hot sauce which was plenty for us.  However I think what turned us off was that the tortilla got too doughy, so the texture was unappetizing.  I wanted to love this, but it was not meant to be.

These were very good and well liked by my co-workers.  I'm glad I read the reviews ahead of time.  I doubled the cream cheese and cut down the hot sauce to 1 tbs and added 1 tbs of ranch dressing mix and they still had a nice zing to them.  I also added some shredded cheese to the mix.

Appertizers are my absolute favorite !!!  These are a great easy item to make and try different variations of, one of my favorite is to use cream cheese, finely chopped jalpenos (or crushed red), green onions, minced garlic, and cayenne pepper. All amounts of ingredients can be altered to each persons individual taste and spice level.  I reccomend trying it out!

I think this recipe is overrated. I followed the recipe exactly and was not impressed. It was edible, but not delicious as I had hoped it would be. I love all the ingredients.. just not together. Spice was not a factor for me. I live in Texas so I'm no stranger to heat. I will not be making these again.

This was probably the simplest "snack" recipe that I've put together.  I took it to a barbecue (used spinach and tomato wraps to make it festive) and it was gone within 30 minutes.  Everyone enjoyed it.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Very good! Really easy to make. I substituted the pimento peppers for jalapeno peppers because they didn't have any at my grocery store. I only used half of the 4 oz can and it had a nice kick. Really easy and everyone loved it!

Make sure to use full strength cream cheese, not the pre-whipped kind as it is too thin.

Like everyone else, I add my own little changes to suit my family's tastes but the base recipe itself is wonderful.  I have to hide them in the fridge to keep my teens from eating before the event.

After reading the reviews, I was ready to love this recipe.  I did not care for it all.  When I made it, I added only 1 1/2 tablespoons of hot sauce to start.  The hot sauce taste was so strong that I added another 4 ounces of cream cheese to tone it down.  At that point, I thought the mixture tasted okay.  After setting overnight, however, the roll-ups tasted like black olive in hot sauce - that's it.  My husband likes black olives and hot sauce but did not care for this combo.  They were convenient, good looking and held their shape but next time I'll try ranch mix, cream cheese, bacon and cheddar cheese!

Holy mother of god this is hot if you prepare it as-is. I used two packages of cream cheese instead of one, and only two tablespoons of hot sauce and it was pretty spicy! I think it also depends on what kind of hot sauce you use.

Very good.  I did add a package of dry Hidden Valley Ranch Fiesta Dip to the ingredients.  Added just the right amount of flavor. Make plenty as they always seem to go fast.

I didn't really follow this recipe, but rather used it as inspiration for my own to fit my own tastes - I HATE cilantro! I double the cream cheese, use spinach and tomato tortillas, chop both black olives and green (spanish) olives, use loads of scallions, and add salsa to the mix. I usually use medium or hot salsa and omit the tabasco sauce and chiles.   They're always a big hit :-)

This was my first attempt at making roll-ups, but it will not be my last.  I needed a recipe to take to my son’s confirmation dinner and this fit the bill.  I made one recipe on spinach tortillas, one on tomato and one on regular.  The platter was beautiful and the taste was superb.  I did take a couple of other suggestions.  I doubled the cream cheese for each recipe, cut the hot sauce to 1T, left out the cilantro and substituted chopped red bell pepper for the pimentos.  The color was pleasing and the taste was great.  Try this recipe – you will like it!

This was quick, easy, and delicious.  I made it this weekend for a baby shower, and had quite a few people asking me for the recipe.  I also added to the cream cheese a packet of the ranch dip mix before adding in the other stuff.  It gave it a little extra flavor which everyone liked.

Excellent and very flavorful! I doubled the filling recipe, but used the original amount of tortillas and it was perfect. Next time though I will leave out the cilantro-personal preference. There wasn't a bite left!

This was a BIG hit!  I tried to spread the mixture on the tortillas thin, like the other reviews recommended, but I think I may have done it too thin for my taste.  There were a few empty spaces that I had to fill after slicing, so next time I will put it on a little thicker.  I think the "oozing" of the filling is just a part of the process, and it's not that hard to scrape the excess off and use in the next tortilla.  It was a little too spicy for kids (they were 8 & under), but that was expected.  The adults loved it, and they were very pretty on the platter!  We will use this one again--thanks!

I have been using a similar recipe for years and people always love it!  I do not use olives or cilantro but I do add sour cream, cheese, tomotatoes, and jalapenos.  You really can use all sorts of ingredients and not go wrong!

I didn't mark these as "hot," and one guest sputtered a bit after popping one into her mouth. Live and learn. For those who love some "bite" in their food, these are great! Don't spread the cream cheese mixture too thick, because it'll just ooze out when you roll up the tortilla.

I've made this a bunch of times since finding it here.  I've changed it up a bit depending on what i had on hand at the time, so it's never exactly the same. But for a quick, easy appetizer it rocks! Toss in some capers, or pitted green olives. or..... Mix it up, don't be afraid.

I used siracha for the hot sauce and it was pretty spicy using just 2 TBS. To cut the spice I added lettuce which was nice, made the roll ups bigger and added some crunch and texture.

These always go over very well!  I use 1 to 2 tablespoons of Tabasco instead of pepper sauce.  They are pretty spicy with that much Tabasco.

I'm sure these will be good BUT I had problems with the recipe.  For one the volume made did not come close to being enough to spread on 10 10" tortillas.   You have to really spread it thinly.  Also, what type hot sauce??? Here in TX there are lots of different hot sauces.  It seems like a lot if I used Tabasco so I just did it by taste.

Office party hit. I doubled the cream cheese, doubled the cilantro (since I didn't have green onions) and added 1/2 cup of sour cream. Turned out great. Since I added the sour cream it lessened the hot sauce so you could also add more to your taste.

Found this recipe on the website about 2 years ago and have been making them ever since! Very easy to make, just be careful and don't spread too much filling on the tortilla because it squirts out the side when you roll them up.

These were really good.  I couldn't find pimentos that day, so I bought some jarred whole roasted red peppers, and it turned out to be for the best, they gave it such a wonderful favor.

I only really made these because I had things in the fridge that needed using up. They were an unexpected hit! I used jarred roasted red peppers instead of pimentos, and jarred jalapeno slices instead of canned chiles. I upped the amount of olives as they weren't terribly flavorful. Turned out great. Thanks!

I made this for Christmas Eve because we always have a big Mexican dinner and I thought these would be fun. They turned out really yummy! I only used 1 tbs of hot sauce instead of 3 and they were spicy enough for me. Also, the recipe only made enough to cover four 10 inch tortillas, not 10. But once they were cut up it still made plenty. Next time I think I might use more cream cheese though. I wanted to use red and green tortillas to make it look more festive, but I couldn't find any, but I think the color of all the peppers and stuff made it look really pretty even with regular tortillas.

My mom always made these for get-togethers.  They're pretty good... I used to eat them one after another, but being vegan can no longer do so.  Anyway, a classic recipe you can use over and over again.

I often make something very similar to these (minus the cilantro and hot sauce).  I mix two packages of cream cheese with a dry envelope of Fiesta Ranch and add black olives, green chilis and pimentos.  Make twice as many as you think you need because they go so fast!

This is good but I made a few changes. I add a packet of dry Italian dressing to the cream cheese & use slightly less peppers unless you like it very spicy! I also add ham slices & shredded cheese before I roll it up. Also, as other reviews have mentioned, wrap it in foil before putting in therefrigerator & it will be easier to slice.

I liked this a lot, but for me the recipe didn't make enough filling to use up 10 tortillas.  I only got 4 large tortillas out of it.  I added some salsa and a little cumin and omitted the olives, they were gone before anything else on the table!  Great recipe and I will do it again.

This was very good. I give it 4 stars because I found it a tad bit bland, but once I added cilantro, a bit of sour cream, cumin and chili powder, they were great! Not one was left over!

I looked for a recipe that would be good at a company picnic potluck and chose this one. They were OK when I tried them at home, but when they warmed up to room temperature they were NOT GOOD. Because they were only OK even cold, I give it three stars. The best appetizer is Sausage Parmesan Puffs (do a search)...you wont regret it!

These are yummy, HOWEVER, you definitely need to double the amount of cream cheese!  I used vegetable cream cheese, which added extra flavor, as well as some shredded cheese.  You can really play around with the ingredients, but be sure to use twice as much cream cheese!  It's a keeper!

Very good.  I only made a few small changes...I did double the cream cheese, and I substituted a little onion powder in place of the green onions, and red bell pepper in place of the pimentos.  Everyone loved these at our NYEve party!

I recently made these for a holiday party and everyone loved them. The guests who know I usually make a similar rollup commented on how these were far better than the ones I've made in the past.

I think the fresh cilantro was what gave it the extra "oomph" and made what could have been yet another so-so, mostly canned/prepared ingredient-filled appetizer fresher and more flavorful. 

I couldn't find pimentos (that I could afford) so I increased the chilis (an extra tablespoon or so) and green peppers (used 5 instead of 2). I also cut down the hot sauce to 1 tbsp. 

I loved this recipe and will definitely use again.

My party goers loved this -- once they tried it.  They were a little put off by the appearance, but once I convinced them to try it, they were hooked. I may add a little cheese next time, and don't slop too much mixture onto the tortillas; that makes them difficult to roll and stay rolled.  

Very tasty!

Delicious and different appetizer. Took it to work potluck and received some positive comments and two requests for the recipe. Only thing that kept me from rating it five stars is that I was only able to get 1/2 the amount out of the recipe, actually used just four tortillas.  Other than that -- superb!

I made these roll-ups for a party and everyone loved them, and I mean LOVED them.  I'm a person who is into "quick and easy" so this recipe was right up my alley. But the best part was how delicious they are. The women all wanted the recipe so I turned them on to this website.

I do change this recipe for the sake of the children in our family who like just a little heat. I reduce the red pepper sauce to only 1 tablespoon, not 3 as called for. I also add a half a teaspoon of salt. Everyone loves them. They get better with age, too! If there are leftovers, they seem creamier and the flavors have formed a wonderful marriage.

Making them now without the pimentos, and cilantro. We used 1T of hot sauce. I wish the recipe told us how much to use for each tortilla, we had to guess and hope they turn out ok

This was pretty good. I have definitely more successful just dumping random things into a bowl of cream cheese and spreading it on a tortilla. The Tobasco was WAY too much...I love spicy and Tobasco in particular, but I am so glad I only but in 1 Tablespoon. I also added about 1/2-1 cup of shredded sharp cheddar, which helped cut the tobasco a lot.

Very tasty - I used 2 tbsp hot sauce rather than 3 and it was still plenty spicy.  Loved the combination of flavors.  It was so quick and easy;  perfect for a quick-to-make appetizer.

I think there's a lot of room for improvement with this recipe and I will trip to make it again. But I ran into a few issues.
First, my mixture was too liquid-y. Even after refrigerating over night it was still too liquid-y. This could have been that I didn't drain the chiles, olives, and pimentos enough, however - therefore maybe use fresh as much as you can rather than canned to avoid excess water. 
Also, I only did 2 tablespoons of Frank's Hot Sauce and added 2 ham splices to each roll up after reading some one else's suggestion. I recommend adding even more ham to make a heftier roll - plus it complements the creamy mixture, well. 
Next time I also might try freezing the cream cheese mixture before spreading so I can get a thicker layer in the roll up. Will try again!

This is my go-to appetizer.  It is very easy to make.  Just as some others had mentioned in their review, I just add hot sauce until there is just enough heat.  Every one has such different heat tolerance that I rather have them add more hot sauce on their roll if they wanted because there is no scraping it off once it's in the mixture!

I think the recipe was good, except I found it didn't use enough cream cheese.  I used 12 oz of cream cheese and actually only got 7 tortillas out of it.  Excellent flavor combinations, it went over well at the Superbowl party!

Be sure to double the cream cheese.  3 tablespoons hot sauce is too spicy, use 3 teaspoons.

Pretty good recipe to start with. I recommend adding the flavor you want to spice it up (green chiles, diced pimentos, etc.).

I made these for a wedding shower and they were a big hit.  No leftovers and easy for people to graze.  I will be making these again!

I didn't have diced chiles so I used jalapenos instead.  Only used 1 Tbl of hot sauce ( thankfully) and tried fat free cream cheese.  Unfortunately they did not tast too great and I'm taking them to a party.  The true test is how many get eaten so we'll see.

Yummy! I tweaked some stuff just because I didn't have all the ingredients. I did follow the advice of others and use double the cream cheese. I didn't have olives. I used a red pepper instead of pimentos. I didn't have any green onions-or onion salt, so I threw in some garlic salt! I also added a little salt and pepper as well. I didn't think this was too spicy at all...maybe I didn't use the really spicy hot sauce. Thanks!

I have always loved these roll ups but never put in the review.  I like these because the added heat gives these appetizers just what they need to make them different.  The flavor is great!

Very good alone or with salsa on the side . I ended up using 7 or 8 taco shells with the recipe. Using only 2 tsp of hot sauce, I wanted everyone to set the heat they wanted by having a couple different salsas on the side for dipping.

I doubled the entire recipe. Topped with a cilantro leaf and small piece of sweet red pepper.... great presentation for our office holiday luncheon. I also gave eack a tap of "salsa en polvo" made by a company called Valentina and sold at mexican grocery stores.. it added just a tiny kick!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I threw a holiday cocktail party and made these.  I couldn't believe how fast they were eaten.  The only change I made was adding 1/2 of a habanero pepper because I knew that some of the guests like very spicy foods.  It was a great addition to my food selections.

I always get rave reviews when I make this . The only changes I make are instead of the green chiles, I dice up 2-3 whole pickled jalapenos and leave out the cilantro.
Awesome Appitizer !
