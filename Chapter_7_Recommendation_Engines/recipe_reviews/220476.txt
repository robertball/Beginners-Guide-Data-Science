Outrageously good!  This recipe ties for 1st place for most amazing thing I've made from this website.  I made it because my fianc√©e really enjoys a good dumpling and we haven't found a good dumpling spot yet in our area. She said that these were among the best she's had and better than any restaurant and I couldn't agree more -- great work with this recipe!

I actually didn't use shrimp and did a straight pan-fry of the "all-veggie version" the author mentioned in the description box by substituting 1/3 lb shitake mushrooms for shrimp and otherwise following the recipe (also with bok choy and edamame - didn't try spinach though).  In addition to the sweet soy sauce, I did a spicy peanut sauce I saw on another site (two spoonfuls of peanut butter, hoisin sauce, and sri racha mixed to taste and cut with water) which went extremely well with it.
