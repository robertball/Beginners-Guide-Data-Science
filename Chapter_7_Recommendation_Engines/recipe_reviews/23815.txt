My daughter is a blueberry fanatic.  She loves this recipe.  I suggest adding a tsp or 2 of milk to get all of the dry ingredients incorporated.  Also, I found that I get about a dozen in a half muffins when I make them.

These were easy and awesome.  I substituted splenda baking sugar mix and used whole wheat flower to make a healthier muffin.  For those who complained about a lack of a crispy top I have a suggestion:  before baking sprinkle the tops with granola and brown sugar, then put a tiny bit of butter or honey on top to make it all stick together!  My husband absolutely loved these! (btw, I used stawberry yogurt and 1/2 blueberries, 1/2 mashed banana)

I used banana, natural (plain) yogurt, a dash of maple syrup & some chopped pecans.  I also halved the amount of melted butter to cut some of the fat.  I can't wait to make some with the Summer fruit that will be avail. here in Australia very soon.  Mango, strawberry, peach - the combinations are endless!

This recipe has to be one of the best muffin recipes I have ever tried.  I make these muffins at least once a month!  Instead of the 12 muffins that the recipe calls for I use a huge six-muffin mold.  The muffins come out looking and tasting better than almost anything you'd find in a cafe!

A moist, tasty and versatile muffin recipe.  I have made them several times with varying ingredients.  Non-fat yogurt works well, and substituting canola oil for the butter cuts down on the saturated fat if that's important to you.  An interesting variation is using lemon yogurt with fresh (or frozen) cranberries.  Delicious!

Very moist, very delicious! I used whole wheat flour and substituted half the amount of sugar with Splenda. I used fat free strawberry yogurt and made half the batter with blueberries and the other half with strawberries and bananas. Yummy! I love this recipe! I'm going to make orange-flavor muffins next.

I used fresh blueberries & plain yogurt. Not a bad muffin, for using yogurt. These rose just enough that they developed a nice round crown, but not a large crunchy top, like I prefer.  Next time I'll fill the tins closer to the top. Still, very moist, good flavor, and a little bit of crispness because the tops turned golden (ahh, real butter). I'd make them again - can't wait to try some variations with different yogurt!

So yummy!  I used half whole wheat flour, and a Splenda mix for the sugar.  Still turned out great.  I made them with peach yogurt and diced strawberries and they were moist and flavorful.  Will definitely make these again - there are so many ways to switch up the flavor!

It wasn't as moist as I expected it to be but the taste was good. I used peach yogurt with apple chunks. I used half the sugar.

What a great muffin recipe!  I used fat free french vanilla yogurt and 2 c. fresh cherries.  I used 2 TBSP. of melted butter and 2 TBSP. of veg. oil for added moistness.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of almond extract.  There was enough batter to overfill 12 muffin cups and they came out perfect in exactly 25 minutes.  I can't wait to try other yogurt and fruit combinations!

Loved these!  After reading other reviews, I used 1 cup whole wheat and one cup AP flour; and reduced sugar to 3/4 cup.  In terms of the wet ingredients, to avoid the dryer muffin others described, I added a banana that was on the older side along with the blueberries, and a little milk.  The battery is really thick, but don't let it freak you out - they turn out fabulous.  Before baking sprinkle brown sugar and some cut up walnuts on top, then lay a little slice of butter on top.  It makes a wonderfully light crispiness on top.

What a lovely recipe! I have discovered that substituting sour cream for the yogurt works well, as does oil for the melted butter. If you want really super fabulous muffins, I'd recommend sprinkling some Turbinado (raw) sugar on top to get a crunchy, sweet, yummy topping. However, if you were to follow the original recipe, these would still be fabulous! I cannot count the times I have made muffins with this recipe. Whether I used diced peaches, berries (raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries tend to be an amazing combination), or a combination, they always turn out swell.

This recipe is so simple, but so good. I don't like to review recipes when I modify them, but I don't think my changes affected what matters. I used 1 cup of plain Greek yogurt, which mean I also had to add milk to make it moist enough. The 4 tablespoons of butter give it a fabulous outer texture without adding too much fat. I also used evaporated cane sugar instead of refined sugar, and added a dash of salt. So moist and perfect. This will be my go-to recipe for blueberry muffins.

Wow! This has to be one of the best blueberry muffins I've tried so far from this website. I followed the recipe to a "T". This recipe does call for 1 (8 ounce) container blueberry flavored yogurt. I already had 2 (6 oz) yoplait mountain blueberry yogurts, and rather than wasting half of a container I added the rest of the 4 oz to the batter. I had exactly 2 cups of fresh blueberries. The batter was very thick just as the submitter advised. I filled the muffin cups 2/3 full and while baking it rose up nicely. The whole house just filled with "blueberry" aromas...Mmm. It took exactly 25 minutes to bake the muffins and I ended up with 18 nice ones. The top of muffins were a nice even golden brown color and I could see all the blueberries popping out from all over the muffins. The muffins were very moist, not at all dry, full of flavor, nice looking and fresh tasting. Easy to put together, baking time is accurate, wonderful results. I couldn't be happier!

3rd Review.  Chocolate ones again using 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 AP flour.  Subbed 2 Tbls canola oil+2 Tbls applesauce for the butter.  Turned out fantastic!!_______________________2nd review---Because these muffins were SO moist I decided to try making chocolate chocolate chip muffins (I haven't found a good recipe yet...everyone I've ever tried turned out really dry!).  I replaced 1/2 cup of AP flour with cocoa, instead of butter used 4 Tbls of canola oil, and I used 3 (6oz) containers of Chobani vanilla yogurt, and 1.5 cups of chocolate chips.   I also had to add a little bit of water.  The batter is really thick.  Turned out FABULOUS!! Not quite like the grocery store chocolate chocolate chips muffins but pretty darn close and WAY more healthy!!  I'll give up a tiny bit of taste for it being a ton healthier.  Next time I'm going to use 1/2 whole wheat and the applesauce and see how that works -----------------------------------------

1st Review---I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose.  I used 1/2 cup regular sugar and 1/4 cup brown (reducing total sugar to 3/4 cup).  I replaced the butter with 2 Tbls of applesauce and 2 Tbls of canola oil.  I also used Chobani greek yogurt.  Mixed it all up and it was WAY dry, the flour wouln't even incorporate.  I'm guessing that the greek yogurt has a lot less water than regular.  I ended up using 3 (6 ounce) containers of blueberry yogurt.  These are WAY moist and yummy!  Pretty healthy too with the subs :)

These are great! Mainly because my boyfriend, who does not like muffins, ate three of them before I could say boo. I used raspberry yogurt and frozen strawberries (thawed and cut up a bit). I cut the recipe in half so I used an egg white. Wonderful quick recipe to make with stuff I keep on hand :) Update: Made these again, I could only find a 6 oz cup of yogurt so I added a couple Tablespoons of half and half (because the batter was really very thick!). Convect baked at 350 and it took a little over 20 minutes. I got 15 muffins out of the batch.

This is a really good lowfat recipe. I did make some changes, as others suggested such as increasing the amount of baking powder to 2 tea, I also used half brown sugar and half white sugar. For the flour I used 1/2c white four, 1/2c oats and 1c whole wheat. Just to spice it up, I added a strusel of 5 tb brown sugar, 2 tb flour and 2tb butter with cinn. and nutmeg to the top of the muffins, they were wonderful and even better after they sit overnight! thanks for the great recipe!

Very good. The recipe is wonderful as is, but I made some changes based on my family's dietary needs and preferences. I made these using all white whole wheat flour, coconut palm sugar and plain yogurt. I also used 2 Tablespoons of butter and 2 Tablespoons applesauce instead of 4 Tablespoons butter. I used 2 cups blueberries, 1 banana mashed, 1 Tablespoon almond extract in addition to the vanilla, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon. I also made a crumb topping with whole wheat flour, oats, coconut palm sugar, 1 T butter and cinnamon. The topping was a nice addition, but not entirely necessary. These muffins make a sweet hearty breakfast or snack. Thank you so much for the recipe.

These were just OK.  Since the yogurt I typically buy comes in 6 oz containers (not 8), I used one container and part of another.  I ended up getting 16 muffins.  After 25 minutes, the tops were a little bit dark, and the muffins ended up dry.  I would recommend checking these before the 25 minutes.  This recipe isn't bad, but it's just not worth making again.

Really tasty and healthy muffins.  Easy to make, too.  :)  My healthy/taste subs: 1 cup AP and 1 cup WW flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 1 cup fat-free blueberry yogurt, 4 Tbsp oil, 3 tsp vanilla extract.  Other kitchen subs: additional 2 tsp baking soda because I had no baking powder.  Topped with streusel made of: 5 Tbsp brown sugar, 2 Tbsp AP flour, broken pecans, 2 Tbsp butter.  Baked as instructed and it yielded 12 regular muffins.  Be warned, though, that the combined muffin mix is VERY THICK!  Out of curiosity I did NOT add any extra milk or liquids to the mixture...  and they turned out fine!  Muffins rose as expected, plus they looked + tasted great (very fruity, but not excessively sweet/unhealthy, which is what I dislike about the ones in coffee shops).  A+ in my books!

My go to blueberry muffin recipe is close to this one. These are very good. Mine call for 2 1/4 c flour and 3/4 cup sugar also no baking soda and 2 eggs. To those who add milk, this batter is suppose to be very very thick almost like cookie dough. You have to trust the recipe. for those that it did not rise for you must have left something out or not enough or your baking powder may be old. These come out moist and have a beautiful crumb. It blows me away that someone changes the recipe then complains that they did not turn out good. Try making them by THE RECIPE

This recipe is great for anyone trying to lose a few lbs.  You can use lighter products like Dannon light n fit yogurt  (any flavor) & change the fruit to match the yogurt flavor.  Since Dannon yogurt is only 6 oz, I also added 4 tbsp 1% milk.  They are delicious.  I know I will be making this recipe over and over trying new flavors.  This time I used light & fit strawberry yogurt and 1 c blueberries and one lg banana, chopped. Also used 1/2 c splenda and 1/2 cup sugar.  Usually I will not rate a recipe if I have changed it, but I know if the lightened version is very good, the original version must be wonderful also.

Great recipe!  I added more baking powder, 1/2 tsp of salt, 3 tbsp of sour cream and substituted 1 cup of blueberries with 1/2 cup of chopped apple and 1/2 cup finely chopped rhubarb.  And I used oil instead of melted butter.  The muffins came out light and fluffy and very moist.  They were a big hit with the husband and kids.  i will definitely use this recipe again with the above changes!

This recipe is awesome! I made these in a mini-muffin pan and found that I could turn the oven down 250F and cook for 16 min and they'd be done.  It makes two pans.  Don't fill the  cup too full or it will have a flat top instead of puffing up nucely.

These muffins were so moist, and turned out perfect. Thank you! I had some banana to use up, so that was the fruit, along with strawberry yogurt. Linda

I rated these muffins, but I rated them in the wrong recipe!  I had on the orange muffins which I had just made and they are very good too.  I am sorry...my rating is in the orange muffin section.  Well, anyway as I said, these muffins are delicious!  I made blackberry, raspberry, strawberry and blueberry muffins with the same flavored yogurt as the fruit I used and they were so moist and looked so pretty on my serving tray.  Everyone thought they were great, so I will be making them quit often now.  They are so easy to make.  Thanks!!

I made these today using red raspberry yogurt and frozen unsweetened red raspberries....oh my they are very moist and slightly tart from the berries.....just heaven.  I subbed 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour, 1 cup all purpose flour, and 3/4 cup splenda.  I did have to add a splash of milk as the batter was so so thick.  I made 12 regular sized muffins filling the tins up completely.  Very very good.....thank you for sharing this amazingly versatile recipe.  Will try again with blueberries and again with blackberries :-)

Well, first, mine didn't look anything like the picture but the taste is fantastic!  I didn't have straight blueberries but had the triple berry mix from Sam's.  I should have chopped the larger berries so next time I'll do that.  The color turned a bit green looking so I wouldn't serve them to anyone else (looked a bit like moldy bread).  I used vanilla lowfat yogurt (what I had on hand) and then followed the rest of the directions.  They really puffed up and spilled over the tops of the muffin papers but it still was very good flavor.  I'll be making these again.

I love them! They're moist, delicious and perfect. I used half brown sugar and half white, plain yogurt, canola oil and flavoured it with apples and cinnamon. Absolutely fantastic! A very thin crispy crust formed on the top and the insides were soft and flavourful. Will definitely make these again! :)

Excellent recipe.  I use plain yogurt, though.  Might be very sweet if you use blueberry yogurt and all that sugar in addition.

I didn't make this exactly as is...I doubled the recipe, and used 1/2 spelt flour & 1/2 white flour. Also, I used a combination of peach, vanilla, & raspberry yogurt with blueberries & strawberries. (I had to get rid of some individual sized yogurts!). I also made them in jumbo muffin pans and got about 12 with a bit of batter left over that I won't likely use. Delicious!!

I made the recipe almost as written, except for the amount of sugar included. Love this recipe in general-- the consistency of the muffins is fantastic, and I love that it uses up the random extra yogurt I usually have. But it is WAY too sweet! I doubled the recipe & put in 1 1/2 cups of sugar & it still tastes sweeter than cake. Next time, I'll make this with lemon zest, plain yogurt & cranberries and cut the sugar even more.

Even though my DH hates muffins...i had frozen blueberries that i wanted to use.  i reduced the amount of sugar by half, as the blueberry yogurt and the berries themselves are very sweet already.  i added a splash of milk to make blending the berries easier, but the batter still turned completely purple! I also added a tbsp of maple syrup of a bit of difference. when reduceing the sugar i read that it is prudent to increase the vanilla so i did to 3 tsp.  then i turned the batter out into a well buttered loaf pan and baked for about an hour...it was a hit!!  serve warm, sliced with butter!  i like to partially thaw the frozen berries in the hoped that they won't shrink up too much and causee the batter around it to become mushy, but still no luck in figuring that out.  maybe next time i need to try dried blueberries that are reconsitituted partly...will let you know as i will make this again!!

This recipe inspired creativity and I made them 100% organic whole grain. These are going to be a breakfast staple at our house! I used 1c ww pasty flour, 1c old fashioned oats. You can use any flavor yogurt with any kind of dried or fresh fruit. I used a 6 oz. yogurt and so I added a few tbl. milk. I used canola oid instead of butter for lower cholesterol. I halved the sugar (i used brown) and it was still too sweet for me maybe because of the kind of yogurt I used or because I put in date crumbles which are very sweet? Next time I will only use 1/4 cup of sugar. My toddler LOVED these.

These were too sweet, did not rise, and melted all over my pan at an even level.  We enjoyed the overall idea, but the quantities and ingredients are not correct.

Delicious!!! I used 3/4 C. brown sugar,and added 1/2 tsp. salt, & 1/3 C. milk and the rest of the original recipe.  Mine were mango apricot yogurt with frozen wild blueberries (I like them because their small).  The only other difference I made was that I put the blueberries in the dry ingredients instead of the wet so the flour would help suspend them so they wouldn't sink.  They turned out perfectly!!  I will use this recipe over and over again!!
THANK YOU!!!

Really, really good muffins!!  First time I made them with plain yogurt and a little raspberry jam thrown in and fresh blueberries.  They were full of berry flavor and very moist.  The second time I made them with mocha yogurt and chocolate chips.  Again, they were very good-tasting and moist.  I also used half whole wheat flour and half white as well as brown sugar instead of white.  I will use this recipe often after searching for a long time for a great muffin recipe.  Thanks for posting, Jacky!!

These muffins were excellent! I made several changes though, i replaced 1/3 cup of the flour with bran, i used 2/3 of a cup of splenda (not the blend, plain old splenda) to replace the sugar, i used 1 egg beater instead of an egg, 3/4 of a cup of sliced strawberries and 1 cup of mashed bananas instead of blueberries and a 4 oz container of strawberry Light n' Fit (Dannon) yogurt, as well as 4 oz of rasberry Light n' Fit, brought the calories down to about 116 and they're still delicious!!

what a great idea!  These muffins are soooo incredibly moist and the variations are endless.  I used a CAN OF PEACHES and PEACH yogurt (Dannon w/fruit on the bottom...that is what was on sale) and added 2 oz more of plain yogurt.I made a crumb topping with a hint of cinnamon, brown sugar, flour, and butter and they were just wonderful.  This has become my new favorite muffin recipe because of ease of prep, variation possibilities, inexpensive to make especially when yogurt and canned fruit are on sale, and the moistness.  They looked like a picture when they came out of the oven.  Made 8 giant bakery style muffins.

This recipe is SO FUN!!!!  I have found that the best way to get a crunchy top is to use the custard style yogurt.  My favorite way I have made this recipe is the use banana strawberry yogurt with a half cup sunflower seeds, half cup dried mixed fruit, half cup chopped almonds and hald cup milk chocolate chips (ok, maybe a little extra on the chips!!).  I also added just a little milk and brown sugar.  These muffins are AWESOME!!  I am craving them right now thinking about it.

My son and I thought these were great.  I substituted 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for 1/2 cup of the regular flour, just to give it a little extra fiber.  It did not affect the flavor of the muffins (not enough for me to notice anyway).  Surprisingly, they were even better out of the refrigerator the next morning than they were the night I made them!

These muffins were beyond moist.  I used strawberries and strawberry yogurt in my variation.  My fiance voted for 5 stars, but I think they lacked the optimal sweetness I craved.  Overall, though, very good texture; more like a heavy cake than a muffin.  Next time I'll sprinkle some sugar on the tops.  Mmmmm!

I have made these several times because they are so easy and versatile, not to mention my kids love them! This morning I used black cherry Greek yogurt, a large mashed banana, subbed brown sugar for the white, added an extra teaspoon of vanilla, and a half a cup of semi sweet chocolate chips. My oldest said this was the best combo yet. Have fun with this recipe, the possibilities are endless!

These are okay, but not great. The search continues for a better blueberry muffin recipe. (The recipe made 18 muffins.) 

The batter is extremely thick. I followed the suggestion of another reviewer and thinned it out with a little milk just to get most of the flour incorporated. Because the batter is so thick, the blueberries clumped together in each muffin. This resulted in two-thirds of the muffin being a clump of blueberries and the other third being completely blueberry-less. Although I didn't think it was possible for a blueberry muffin recipe to call for too many blueberries, I think this one does.

Very good and moist. Another reviewer was exactly right when she said using mixed fruit yields moldy looking muffins so do not make these if giving them away. My son won't take them to his college roommates because they look gross although he doesn't have a problem with eating them here!

These were fine, but the recipe needs a little salt.  The recipe is also pretty dry so incorporating fruit isn't easy and you tend to get some muffins with clumps of fruit and others with none.

Easy and delicious.  The 'batter' is more like dough.  I used fat free greek yogurt (it was thick I had to add a bit extra) and blueberries.  This is going into my library.

The Best!  I add 1 tsp lemon flavouring and cranberries as well...soooo good!  If I'm feeling healthy, I'll add 1/3 cup oats and increase the sour cream, but it works just great the way it's written!  YUM!

These were g
reat!  Due to allergies I used vanilla soy yogurt and 1/2 cup applesauce (egg replacer) plus 1/2 cup organic apple butter bc I ran out of applesauce plus our vegan butter sub. Earth balance.

Delicious. I was trying to get rid of some yogurt before it expired (vanilla) and only had half the amount of blueberries it calls for left, but these still turned out fantastic.

these muffins were good and easy to make.  i followed the recipe the first time but used vanilla yogurt and frozen blueberries.  The second time I made them with vanilla yogurt and chocolate chips (I just had to try it out!) and they were delicious- 5 stars- moist yummy and a real treat!  I realize they are no longer "fruit and yogurt" but definitely worth trying if you're a chocolate fan!

I've made these with apples (spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg), bananas, and mangos.  We always have a ton of fruit in the fridge and this is a great recipe for using up and not wasting overripe fruit.

For some reason I get 24 muffins out of this recipe and I've made it twice.  The first time I used diced, canned peaches.  The batter was thick but not doughy because the peaches added some liquid and the muffins rose a lot when baking.  They had nice, tall crowns.  Texture was great (moist and tender) but the flavor was kind of bland to me.  The second time, I made blueberry muffins and added 2 teaspoons lemon extract in addition to the vanilla .  I knew the batter would be thick so waited to stir them in until the dry and wet ingredients were sufficiently combined.  This time the batter was really, REALLY thick and more like dough, as others have described.  My muffins rose some but did not get the tall domes.  They however taste great and the texture, again, is very nice.  I adore lemons and the lemon extract really improved the flavor I think.  What I will probably do next time I make the muffins with blueberries or another fruit that doesn't contribute a lot of liquid is add a couple tablespoons of water to the dough so they have taller crowns.  Very good recipe!

These were deemed "excellent" by my daughter who does not even like blueberries!  I used light agave sweetner in place of the sugar (3/4 cup) and baked them at 325 for an extra 5 minutes.

I've made these several times and they always turn out great.  I use half whole wheat flour, 3/4 c sugar (and it is still sweet) and about 1/2c milk because the batter is hard to stir.  I think as written the recipe is too sweet because the yogurt is sweetened.

Love these! I use different fruits for variety, and whole wheat flour for the all-purpose and ground flax (about 1/4 c. flax, any more and they don't turn out, and then the wheat) and 3/4 cup sugar.  Make these almost once a week as a quick breakfast for my kids before school. YUMMY!

Yum!  Just made these muffins and they came out delicious.  I changed the recipe slightly. I used a mixture of whole wheat white flour and regular flour, reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and added the only fruit on hand which were raspberries.  In addition, I put the batter in 6 large muffin tins and baked them for an additional 5 minutes (since I live at altitude).

I just ate one of these from my first batch and it was delicious! I used passionfruit yogurt, passionfruit and some white chocolate chips. These were incredibly moist, if I was to critique anything it would be that they are too moist! Has anyone tried making these with nearly no butter to lower the fat content? (I know I added chocolate but next time if I don't...)

These are really delicious.  Used fresh blueberries, substituted applesauce for butter.  The tops of mine weren't sticky, but a lovely golden brown.  My batch made 24 medium sized muffins.  My favorite part is that they don't look like pale moon rocks with bits of bluish green in them... thanks for sharing.

Awesome recipe, such pretty golden brown muffins! I made half a batch and ended up with nine nice sized muffins! I used strawberry yogurt and fresh blueberries from our own bushes and also used a whole egg. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and I'm glad I did! It was perfect. Next time, I want to try lemon yogurt with blueberries since those flavors work so well together! I'll make this easy and low calorie recipe often.

First off, these were HUGE! Which is definitely a good thing. I loaded the batter into 12 muffin cups (and I do mean LOADED) because I can't stand having to use only part of a muffin tin for a recipe (personal pet peeve). I subbed whole wheat flour and used a fat-free, organic french vanilla yogurt and fresh blueberries. These are a huge hit, and the best part, with only one egg in them, I can eat them too!

I love blueberry muffins - however, these were not very tasty.  The consistency was more chewy/dry, than fluffy/moist.  I would stick with "To die for blueberry muffins" on this site -- although it has 1/3 more calories/fat, I would rather have 1/2 of one of those muffins, than a dozen of these muffins.

I wans't sure they's come out because the mixture was very crumbly when made with vanilla la creme yogurt.  Used a tad more baking powder for the rise, added sugar to the tops for crunch.  Pretty good!

These just came out of the oven 15-20 min. ago and I just tasted them. The flavor is nice I used lemon and vanilla yogurt with fresh peaches and walnuts. They're very moist but they didn't puff up the way I would have liked them to. The good thing is that this is one of the only recipies that actually do make 12 muffins. Maybe next time I'll try adding a little more baking powder to them to get them to puff up the way I'd like. They are very dense and moist but I'd like them to be a bit less dense and still moist....let me play around with it.  2 Hours later......cooled off and tried them again, strange texture and a bit too moist. I think that may be because the peaches were very very ripe. As I said before I'm willing to try again.

GREAT muffin for moms that want to use up those leftover pieces of fruit from the kids! i changed it slightly, with a doubled recipe, i subbed 1 cup of flour for 1 cup of wheat germ, used whole wheat flour, halfed the sugar and used brown instead, then used chunky banana pieces, diced apple and a couple leftover yogurt cups (i think vanilla, rasp and blueberry) VERY thick batter but it makes a VERY moist muffin!

I made this with plain, lowfat yogurt, reduced the sugar to 3/4 c.  Delish!  I also tried this with fresh white peaches (which were in season), 3/4 c sugar, and plain, full-fat yogurt--also very good!  This recipe produces a very light, cake-like crumb which is moist and tender.

My family loved these!  I changed a few things to make them healthier and my kids still ate them right up.  For one of the cups of flour - I used wheat flour.  Instead of 4T butter- I used 2T butter and 1/3 cup ground flax seed.  I also used plain fat free yogurt.  They were still YUMMY!

These are fabulous!! I used 3 cups of diced apples and 2 containers of lowfat Apple Turnover yogurt along with a teaspoon of cinnamon. Spread it with some cinnamon butter - YUM! I even doubled the recipe to send some to my son's preschool for snacktime. Thanks for a great and versitile recipe!

simple and delicious!  I made these muffins with a mix of vanilla and apple yogurt and apple chunks.  Topped them off with some sugar in the raw which added a little sparkle.  A must try recipe!

Awesome recipe! Very easy, moist and yummy!! My muffin hating husband even liked them. I used banana strawberry yogurt, 2 chopped frozen bananas and a tin of strawberries. Topped it all off with toasted coconut. I found I had to bake them 5 minutes longer. I will be making these again and again.

These muffins are amazing!  I use less sugar and butter than it calls for and they are still perfect.  These are a great way to use up strawberries in the summer, and they make a great banana muffin as well, especially with a berry yougurt.

This is my new favorite muffin recipe!  They have a lightly browned, crunchy top (very important in my book) and great flavor - very moist.  I used peach yoghurt with frozen blueberries and they turned out great (the frozen berries made the batter blue however).  This is one of few recipes I've tried that I actually got a dozen muffins from too.

When they say the batter is thick...they mean thick!
I used half whole wheat flour, half white; peach yogurt; and added some dried fruit and streusel topping.  They were good, but not great.

I made it yesterday and they were gone by tonight. I have to admit, I used half the amount of flour (on accident) and they came out so fluffy, obviously, everyone loved them. I used blueberry chobani yogurt (it has jelly on the bottom) and used raisins instead of blueberries. Today I put the right amount of flour, cherry chobani yogurt and dried cherries. You can't go wrong with this recipe even if you alter it! Delicious!

I love this recipe. We found that you can use just plain yogurt, or even sour cream. It comes out the same.  I also used 3  different kinds of fruit and it turned out amazing!

Great recipe with tons of flexibility! Due to what I had in the fridge, I scaled to 18 muffins (and got an even 24 out of the recipe) and used half whole wheat, half white flour; plain yogurt; and fresh strawberries that had been chopped and macerating in sugar for several days. To account for the sugar in the strawberries, I reduced the sugar in the recipe by 1/2 cup. These turned out amazing!

Made these with half whole wheat flour and with 0 percent fat plain organic yogurt and they turned out delicious. They weren't too sweet, which is a problem, I feel, with many blueberry muffins. The recipe made 15 muffins for me. Thanks!

They were great - they were moist ad just sweet enough.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used 6 ounces of yogurt and 2 ounces of sour cream (cuz my yogurt is in 6 ounce containers - no other reason!). I used a frozen blueberry, raspberry, blackberry mix. I was a little bit afraid of the consistency of the batter but they turned out beautifully

I made this recipe this morning because we are preparing for hurricane Sandy and are expecting long-term power outages starting as soon as tomorrow.  I was looking for a way to use up all the yogurt I had in my fridge (too much for us to just eat) and this recipe was perfect because not only did I prevent the yogurt from going to waste, but the muffins are perfect to add to our stock-pile of storm-friendly foods that don't require refrigeration or cooking!  I didn't have any fresh fruit on hand, so I used two 6oz containers of yogurt per recipe and it turned out perfectly.  The recipe made 1.5 dozen cupcake-sized muffins.  I made strawberry-banana muffins this morning and am about to make a few more batches using blueberry-strawberry and cherry-vanilla yogurt.  Thanks a million for sharing this recipe!!

Instead of blueberries, I used up my summer peaches and peeled and chopped two cups of peaches.  I also used plain yogurt instead of blueberry yogurt and cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup.  Absolutely delicious!

Great low fat, low sugar muffin recipe.  The finished product may not be the most aesthetically appealing but they certainly are delicious-and much healthier than traditional muffins! 

A few alterations I made...

I used 1/2c of all purpose flour and substituted 1/2c. of sugar with stevia. I also used brommel and brown buttery spread instead of butter and blueberries from the freezer (i purchased them fresh and froze them for convenience/increased shelf life).  I baked them for 25 minutes in a large muffin tin. Made 7 large muffins. Will make these again!

There were okay. The peaches I used were already sweetened so I used a little less sugar than called for and they seem to be lacking something... Also, my muffin cups were really full and tops kind of spread out - should have gone for 15 instead of 12.

these were fantastic.  I used pineapple instead of blueberries and I didn't have any baking powder so added a little more baking soda.  LOVED these.  Mine turned out a little crispy on the top and super moist inside - a great combination.  Gonna make them again this afternoon but will use the baking powder this time.  I also want to try coconut flour with this as well - maybe next time. Update - made them again but with gluten- free flour and a cup of drained crushed pineapple.   Not as moist as the first time but still pretty yummy.  I would add more pineapple and maybe leave some of the liquid in. Give it a try!

Great recipe!! I followed the advice of others and made a few changes...First I cut the sugar (don't like sweet things), so I used 1/2 cup sugar, and 2tsp of baking powder, and used oil instead of butter...
I made 3 batches one with vanilla yogurt plus 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips (for the kids) smelled very yummy!
Another batch with strawberry yogurt and 2 cups strawberries and then another using 2 cups mixed berries...
The batter will look dry, but don't worry they will turn out nice and moist!
Great tasting muffins... will make again, and again and again (taste like fruit explosion muffins from Timmies, except no jam filling (which I believe you can do with this muffin))

Delicious. Reduced sugar to 2/3 cup and skipped the vanilla. Batter is more like dough and the berries didn't distribute very evenly, so I will try spooning in a bit into each muffin cup, adding berries, then layering with another dollop of batter.

Made these with the kids using some vanilla yogurt as we didn't have any blueberry yogurt. We added the zest from one lemon to the batter while mixing. Didn't have fresh blueberries so we folded in some frozen ones just as the batter was ready to avoid having blue batter. These came out fantastic. The lemon zest was the perfect compliment.

I used a whole container of fresh strawberries (coarsely chopped) and strawberry yogurt (2% milk fat) instead of blueberry. I chose to use canola oil instead of butter and added a generous splash of milk to help the batter come together a little better. Moist and full of fruit these were good, but missing a little something to really bring it together. A spice? Maybe. These could easily be adapted into a healthier recipe.

These were pretty good.  I used vanilla yogurt and the last of a bag of frozen strawberries.  The kids loved them!  Definitely not my favorite muffin ever, but still good.  I usually try to make things healthier, but I followed this recipe as-is.  I made 12 muffins, but I could have probably made closer to 16 - they were huge!

I love blueberry muffins but I never eat them because of the calories and fat. I was so excited to find this recipe. I made this exactly as written but like others I had to add a couple tablespoons of milk just to get the flour to incorporate. (The batter was thicker than cookie dough) They came out extremely dense and moist with a fairly flat, sticky top. I would've liked them to be a little less moist and dense but they were pretty good and I will make again. Since I was the only one eating them, I froze some and they do freeze very well.

I had some problems with these muffins. I had to add extra water because I couldn't get all my flour absorbed. But then when they came out, I admit that they were delicious, but they were so moist that it wasn't really a muffin. The cooked muffins would stick to your fingers, so it was a bit strange.

I tried these muffins to use up some wild blueberries I thought I had and had them all mixed before I realized that the blueberries were in the bottom of the freezer under 500 lb. of frozen beef.  So I baked them anyway with only the few blueberries in the fruit bottom yogurt.  They were delicious!  I served them to my neighbor the next day and she asked for the recipe.  We both thought they would be even better with the berries.  So that is my next attempt.

5 star Outstanding muffins with these modifications: Added 12 oz blueberry yogurt & 1c fresh blueberries,  plus zest one orange and put 3/4 amount in batter and reserve 1/4 to top muffins with sprinkle of sugar. Important: generously grease & flour muffin pans. Fill only 3/4 full as these do expand quite a bit and run over the muffin cups.

***** This is my very first time making muffins. This recipe was so easy and delicious. I forgot the butter but they were still very moist. The only change I made was using soy yogurt instead of regular. I think I'll put a little salt in next time. Thanks.

A very tasty muffin and easy to make.  I used frozen blueberries which made the batter very very thick so I added a touch of milk to thin it down a bit.  I also used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose.  They came out very light and moist.  Will definitely make them again.

Amazing flavor!!  Much better than any of the muffin mix pouches.  I would have never thought to add yogurt to muffin mix!  I did add the 2 T. of milk as another reviewer suggested.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe...I will be making this for my family for many years to come.

These have a sort of spongy texture, which I love. I used fat free peach yogurt, and think there are many flavours that would be good, like lemon. I used applesauce instead of butter. And my blueberries were frozen, which made no difference. I doubled the recipe, and froze most of them.

best ever yogurt muffins! I made some changes: use plain light yogurt, only 180 gr sugar (not 200 gr) and dried cranberries insted of fresh blueberry. So moist and soft and the best moment to eat them is when they are light warm.

Great base recipe!!  Like others, I modified the recipe just a bit.  I used 2 6-ounce containers of blueberry yogurt, cut the amount of sugar in half, and added a 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg to give it a little spice.  I also reduced the butter by half, but maybe next time I will use all 4 Tbsp.  I didn't have 2 cups of blueberries either, so I used what I had left from the pint I bought at the store (a little less than 1 cup).  The muffins came out really good.  I will use this recipe again with modifications for other varieties of muffins.  Next, I plan to try it with vanilla yogurt and dates with nuts.  The possibilities are endless!!  By the way, thanks for the tip about only spraying the bottom of the muffin cups.  I will never use the paper ones again.  The muffins just popped right out of the pan after they had time to cool.  Thanks again for a great recipe!!  It's a keeper!!

I loved these muffins - made exactly like the recipe, except used plain yogurt instead of flavored....was a bit worried that they might not be sweet enough, but they were perfect for me (sprinkled some granulated sugar on the top for the kids!).  The best part was how they looked - the muffin tops were perfect and did not cave in (unlike the experience of another reviewer).  Next time I might add a bit more vanilla, and a pinch of salt for that extra flavor.  Thanks, Sue, for sharing this wonderful recipe.

These were great! Very moist.  I used vanilla yogurt and frozen blueberries (dusted with flour).  I can't wait to try other fruit. 3/22 - I made these again with vanilla yogurt, apples and cinnamon.  They are great.

Great recipe that allow me to use up frozen blueberries and any type of yogurt on hand but something went wrong when I took them out of the oven to taste whether they were done.  The muffins toppled like 'souffle' which has never happened before with other muffins so I will definitely have to try this again.  The batch was moist and smelled wonderful.. just funny looking crater faces for muffin top.

I used to make this recipe with my mother all of the time when I was child, and was glad to find this on here, as I'd lost mine when the kitchen flooded.  These muffins are exactly how I remember.  I've made them a few times with my son with different combinations (strawberry banana, mocha chip, raspberry lemon) and they've all turned out wonderfully.  Highly recommend this recipe, as the muffins freeze well and toast nicely in the oven on those cold mornings.

These muffins are so moist and fluffy. Overall, an excellent recipe with great flexibility. I had very ripe bananas and strawberry yogurt on hand, and it turned out so yummy. I would recommend when combining the wet and dry ingredients that if your batter is too dry and thick, to add milk until it looks the consistency of Elmer's glue. I am definitely going to try this again with other combinations of fruit and yogurt flavors.

I used lemon yogurt, 1 Tbls lemon juice and a tsp of lemon zest.  I also added some milk because the mixture seemed a bit dry, I would say about 3/4 cup.  They were very tastey.  I would cut down on the sugar next time but they were very good!  A keeper for sure!!:)

This was pretty good, used peach yogurt and fresh peaches. I would prefer if the tops were not so soft and sticky. I'll keep this recipe in the recipe box but I'm not sure how often I'll make it. Will be good when I have fruit to use up.

I doubled it, used plain yogurt and grated a whole lemons worth of peel into the dry ingredients.  I also squeezed the juice from the lemon into the wet ingredients.  Used frozen blueberries.  They were yummy and super moist.  Loved the lemon blueberry flavor.

These are pretty good.  I used a 6oz container yogurt (recipe calls for 8oz container) and then added about 1/2 cup skim milk (might try closer to 1/3 cup next time).  My healthier version: I used 1 cup AP flour and 1 cup whole wheat.  I used 2 TBS applesauce and 2 TBS melted butter.  I also used fat free light yogurt.  I did get about 14 muffins out of the recipe.

These were so good!!!  I love them.  Substituted strawberry yogurt for blueberry and used frozen blueberries. I think that the frozen berries may have added more moisture.

I had been looking for a muffin recipe for muffins made with yogurt. In my recipe I substituted oil for the butter, and I also used splenda for baking for the sugar. I also added a cup of cut up fresh strawberries along with the one cup of blueberries. I also add 1/2 cup of 2% milk  along with vanilla flavored low-fat or regular vanilla flavored yogurt. I also used this same recipe to make banana muffins and just added low-fat butter milk for the milk I had added. The muffins were a hit with family and were a hit when I took them in to work. I just tweaked the recipe to my liking and loved the outcome.  So you can make these healthy or you can make them non-healthy. So thanks to the original created this recipe!:)

Pretty good.  I used lemon yogurt, frozen blueberries, and added a little milk as others suggested.  I also halved the sugar as the yogurt is so sweet.  Next time I will use plain yogurt and lemon zest instead.

I make these and bring them to work. They are demanded. Here are my changes: I use 1c unbleached all purpose, 1c whole wheat, 1/2c wheat germ, 1c whole oats, 8oz sour cream , 3/4c sugar in the raw, 2tsp ginger and cinnamon and 1tsp nutmeg. I also just throw frozen blueberries into the batter, they hold together better when mixing . I also top w/granola cereal and a dab of honey prior to baking. They have a great texture, like a heavily caked granola bar. It sounds like a pain but it comes together quick.. mix the wet, mix the dry, stir and bake. 12 muffins.

I used blueberries and they came up delicious and really moist (and I have no baking skills).  For the mix, I ended up using a couple tablespoons of milk as recommended by another reviewer. They were surprisingly easy to make.

Very easy to make, and they look like a bakery muffin and so good and moist. I cut the sugar in half and always use vanilla yogurt with all fruit.  My favourtite is when made with both blueberries and raspberries combined, made in mini loaf pans.  I get 8 minis with this recipe.

EDIT: This continues to be my "go to" muffin recipe. There are so many muffin recipes out there, but with that comes a lot of fails. This one is reliable! The variations are endless, and does well doing a half batch. I use Greek yogurt now, half the sugar, nutri flour and add a bit of almond milk if it looks too dry. The dryness depends on the brand of yogurt I use.

The addition of yogurt makes these muffins so moist!  Following the other reviewers, I cut down on the sugar, and they tasted just fine.  The only problem I have with these muffins is aesthetic-- they come out looking really blue from the blueberries.

not so great--i made two batches of these yesterday, one with berries, the other with peaches, and neither one of them was exceptional. i found them to be too sweet, with a texture more like a quick-bread than a muffin. they were also flat instead of rounded, but that may be an altitude problem.

Yummy! I made the muffins using fat-free blueberry yogurt and added a few extra tablespoons of fat-free sour cream to make them extra-moist. (Oh, and my sweet-tooth craved a tad more vanilla.) All in all, a fantastic recipe - moist and very blueberry!

Fantastic and healthy muffins for grab-n-go breakfasts.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour, f/f wild berry yogurt and reduced the butter and sugar amounts.  Made mini-muffins, each with a whole blackberry in the center... but the variations are endless.  Thanks!

These muffins are YUUUUUUMY! I use plain yogurt and strawberries; tasted like STRAWBERRIES & CREAM! :) Definitely a keeper! My fiance was like a child. After tasting the batter, he kept asking: "Are they ready yet? Are they ready yet?" (While the muffins were baking... hehe) Thanks for sharing your great recipe with us!

I tried these the other day using vanilla yogurt and frozen blueberries, and they came out very moist and attractive. They really are quite simple to make, and you can change the fruit and yogurt combos to so many things that these won't get old any time soon.

I have tried countless muffin recipies, all which have been dry and dissapointing.  These were a nice and yummy surprise!  I used plain yogert - which was all I hand, and they turned out great.  Give this recipe a try.

LOVED THESE MUFFINS!  I used blueberry yogurt and frozen blueberries (didn't need to thaw or rinse them), and put a topping of softened butter, brown sugar, and white sugar before I baked them like another reviewer suggested.  They were PERFECT & AMAZING.

Wonderful texture, very moist and the flavor is great. The only thing I did different was I made up a mixture of brown sugar,regular sugar,chopped nuts and a little bit of butter and sprinkled on top of muffin just before I put into the oven.  I have made many different types of muffins but these are going to the top of the list..better than most that I have bought in specialty stores...family loved them.  Could use most any type of fruit but I would definately use same flavor yogart to add to the intensity of the flavor of finished muffin

great recipe! I tried a version with 1 cup whole wheat flour replacing 1 cup of white flour, used melted smart balance (no trans fats) spread instead of butter, honey vanilla yogurt, and instead of fruit I used 1 1/2 cups trail mix (enchanted forest mix). It was good and healthy for my 3 yr old - he loved them! This recipe is really neat because it is so versatile. Can't wait to try it with lemon yogurt and fresh blackberries...

I used fat free vanilla yogurt.  Used two cups of mixed frozen fruits.  The bag had raspberries, strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries.  Don't know how I did it, but I forgot to put any of the butter into the batter.  The muffins came out pretty good.  I don't think that the missing butter made much of a difference.  The tops overflowed a whole lot and got huge (but everything cooked all of the way through).  I didn't think that these were all that (except for them being so cheap and easy) but my husband really liked them and ate them all up rather quickly.

These muffins are very good.  The batter was so thick, however, that the fresh raspberries were mashed during the mixing process.  I would've preferred to keep the berries whole - next time will try using frozen berries instead of fresh.

I baked a batch in the morning and the whole house smelled wonderful. I used mixed berry yogurt and added 2 cups of blueberry, rasberry, and cranberry mixture. The muffins were moist and taste yummy! Thank you for such a great recipe.

I was skeptical since the batter was so thick, but these turned out perfectly and were super yummy.

Best muffins ever I call these Cloud Muffins cause they taste like a pillowy cloud I've made them many times with not just blueberries but applesauce and apple pie filling and more they are delicious!

If you have extra yogurt that you need to use up quick then these are good but they aren't the best muffins ever. The texture isn't as good as a regular muffin. Still a handy recipe to have to avoid food waste.  I'll make these again someday when I have old yogurt.

Okay, so I did change some things: half WW flour, 1 T lemon juice plus zest, vanilla yogurt, as that was all I had, a bit of milk because the yogurt wasn't enough. Jacky probably wouldn't recognize this, but they are good! I was worried that I couldn't get the dry ingredients to work in entirely without pureeing the raspberries, but even that worked itself out in the magic of baking. It's clear, though, that I need new baking soda.

I really like this recipe.   It was easy to make.   The muffins did look sort of flat when they came out of the oven, but were still cooked in the middle.   My daughter enjoys eating them.

Will definitely make again! I am in the process of making them for all the dad's I know for Father's Day. Make sure not to overstep the batter or the end result will be chewy. In fact, it is better to under stir and leave some "dry pockets."

These are SUCH good muffins!  I made them with frozen mixed fruit and they turned out amazingly well!  The recipe made 12 regular size muffins and then 10 mini muffins. Super moist and low fat!

Made these with the kiddo. We used raspberry Greek yogurt and frozen cranberries. I had to add about 1/3-1/2 c of milk (almond coconut milk) because it was WAY too dry, but they turned out delicious. Moist, not too sweet, a good go to recipe for muffins. I'll probably experiment with alternatives to the white sugar because I just don't like having that much sweet when the fruits in there.

So stinking good!!!!  I wanted them to be a little more healthy, so I used 1/2 and 1/2 white and whole wheat flour.  So 1C all purpose flour and 1C whole wheat flour.  I had previously frozen some Porter peaches this summer so I diced them up.  Had between 1.5-2C of peaches, diced.  I also used 1C whole milk vanilla yogurt.   And 4T unsalted butter, melted. These may be the BEST muffins I've ever had.   Keeping this recipe for eternity.

This recipe is simple and the muffins were awesome.  When I noticed the batter was on the dry side, I added 1/4 cup of milk. Very nice!

I just made these with a few tweaks: I used 6 oz of strawberry yogurt, 2 bananas, and a Honeycutt apple with skins. I used 1 cup of all purpose flour and 1 cup of whole whest flour. I baked them for 20 minutes because I used my cupcake pan. They are moist and delicious. So as is, not sure how the recipe is but they way I did it, YUM :)

Very moist muffin recipe. I did a variation because I did not have blueberries or blueberry yogurt. I did however have strawberries, bananas, and strawberry yogurt. It turned out delicious. I used Greek Gods brand strawberry vanilla yogurt. I took 2 medium bananas and one pint of strawberries and smashed them up in a ziploc bag. Then, I cut a hole in the corner and piped it into the flour mixture. If you don't have blueberries you must try this variation. I also thought about using apples and honey vanilla yogurt...may try that next.

Usually I don't write reviews, but recipe really deserves it! I tried to make these muffins 2 times and both times they were very tasty, moist and fluffy! Fast and easy to cook! My husband said they were the most tasty muffins he ever tried!

PS: I have to say that I made  a couple of little changes to this recipe. First I put 3/4 cups of sugar instead of 1. I also didn't put 1 t spoon of baking powder, just 1 t spoon of soda. And also I had very thick yogurt, so I mix it with a couple of tv spoons of milk. I also used frozen blueberries, which I washed and dried up with paper towels, so they won't color the batter in crazy blue color :) at the end i sprinkled every muffin with sugar. Muffins were awesome! I recommend it to everyone!

Very nice muffin. Scaled to make 9 portions, this recipe makes 24 mini muffins (2x 12-mini-cake/muffin pans). I made this recipe gluten and dairy free by substituting Pamela's Baking Mix for the flour, Earth Balance Spread for the butter, and Silk soy blueberry yogurt for the yogurt. Came out great. To experiment, I did sprinkle a little cinnamon and sugar on top of half the batch, and that did add some flavor, but plain was delicious on its own. Baking time for the mini muffins was about 18-20 minutes. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made these for a family gathering - they were gone before I even tasted one.  I made mine with big, juicy and fresh blueberries.  The best~ Thank you!

This is my second review.  I made these again today with strawberry yogurt, fresh strawberries and a banana.  I made them in my mini muffin tin and followed the view of another who advised to bake at 250 for 15 to 16 minutes.  DON'T DO THAT!  Bake at 350 for 15 minutes is perfect.  I had to bake the first batch way too long.  The ones I baked properly are so yummy!

omgoodness!  these were incredibly moist!  i changed a few things so i could share these with my toddler.  i used plain yogurt and subbed grated carrot for the fruit.  so really i made carrot and yogurt muffins, but really the base recipe works so well!  just the right amount of sweetness, too.  i also subbed coconut oil for the butter to make it healthier for my lil' guy.  i've been subbing coconut oil in all my baked goods that call for butter, and haven't missed a thing :)   this recipe made 24 absolutely perfect mini muffins.  i split them with my son, and we both LOVED them.  perfect recipe for my arsenal, thank you!!!

This is a delicious recipe! The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is that I do think there needs to be more liquid/moisture in the recipe than as it is written now.  I did as another reviewer suggested and used 2 6-oz cartons of yogurt rather than 1 8-oz, and the muffins came out perfectly.  But I could tell as I was stirring the batter/dough together that any less and it would have been impossible to really incorporate everything well. I used blueberry yogurt and fresh (chopped) raspberries. I also subbed 1/2 c. white whole wheat flour for part of the total flour amount. These are delicious and came out looking smoother than the ones in the photo. This will  be my "go to" berry muffin recipe from now on!

These were good I used peach greek yogurt and sliced apricots because that is what I had on hand.  I then topped them with a vanilla powdered sugar frosting (lightly). It tasted summery and different than the usual combinations

I use plain,low fat Greek yogurt, which isn't as sweet as the fruit flavored ones. These muffins are dense and look nice and have nice cracked tops when baked.

mmm These are great, but I twisted it up a bit. For super healthy muffins I replaced flour with spelt flour, I replaced sugar with real liquid stevia, I used plain whole yogurt and real blueberries and instead of vanilla I used honey. Of coarse everything is organic :) So this is great for diabetics because I used no sugar.

This is a decent muffin recipe. I used  some blackberry soy yogurt I had to use up and it worked well. I used coconut oil in lieu of butter and whole wheat pastry flour instead of all-purpose. Four stars because it didn't blow me  away.

I an truly puzzled by the pictures of these blueberry muffins on the website.  The muffins look cream coloured with the blueberries sprinked throughout.  I don't know how this is possible using this recipe!  The batter is very stiff and dry (even though I doubled the yogurt) and you have to stir it ALOT to get the flour incorporated.  The end result is purple batter and of course purple muffins!!  BUT.....are they ever good!  I make many kinds of muffins (as my husband loves them) and this is among the best I have ever tried.  I was tempted to throw the batter into the garbage when I saw how stiff and dry it was; I was sure I had done something wrong.  But I am really glad that I didn't because they are superb.  Moist and tender with an excellent blueberry taste.  I will be making these often.  Thanks, Jacky (whoever you are).

This recipe is so easy to make. My husband loves blueberry muffins, but comlains about not having enough blueberries in them. There was no complaining with these muffins. I added a couple more tablespoons of yogurt to mixup the dry ingredients better. These beat anything you could ever buy.

Love these!   I used fat free yogurt and also used applesauce instead of the butter.  I also used 50/50 white and wheat flour.  The last change I made was to cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.   I've made these twice, first with lime yogurt with strawberries and kiwi, second with raspberry yogurt with raspberries and blueberries.  Thanks for the great recipe, even with the calorie cutting measures, they were still great.   I imagine making them as written woudl be a 10 star!

These are great muffins.  I could not find any 8 oz yogurts so I used a 6 oz blueberry Greek yogurt (loaded with protein) and added a little milk to make up the difference.  Calling this a firm batter is an understatement - but don't be afraid.  These muffins are moist and delicious.

Absolutely my new favorite blueberry muffin recipe! I will try using plain yogurt next time only because I didn't like the blue color my muffins turned from the blueberry yogurt.

The dough was kinda thick, I had to put a little more yogurt in it. The texture is real nice, its almost like a cupcake. I put a little cinnamon to give it a little more flavor.

I made these muffins this morning. They were delicious! Light and fluffy, and not too sweet. I did add a sprinkle of raw sugar to the top before baking. I will definitely make these again.

great recipe only i made these with frozen strawberries instead, also added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. i also subsituted the sugar for 1/4 cup of agave nectar much healthier for you.they took a little longer 10 mins more to cook as i believe the frozen berries exuded a little more juice than fresh, altogether a great muffin and a good size portion too.

Just finished making the Fruit & Yogurt Muffins and they are wonderful very moist. I did get 18 muffins maybe my pans are smaller. I used the light yogurt and frozen blueberries.

Pretty good muffins.  I used vanilla yogurt, but other than that small change, I followed the recipe exactly.  The top was nice and crusty, and the inside was very moist and much fluffier than I expected.  I filled the muffin cups almost completely full (because that is how much batter I had), and they still puffed up nicely.

These muffins were delicious!  I made a batch last night and they were almost gone by this morning, meaning they were a thumbs-up from the teenage boy in the household.  I didn't have blueberry yogurt on hand so I used plain instead.

Great flavour, but not as moist as I was hoping they'd be, but that may be because I didn't use enough fresh fruit. I'll try more next time, and to leave them in the oven for slightly less time.

These were excellent muffins, great texture and color.  I used nectarines and vanilla yogurt (low fat) and replaced the butter with canola oil and added cinnamon.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Will be making these again.

I've made these twice now in the past week.  First was half and half strawberry and blueberry, the second was peach and cherry.  My boyfriends family absolutely loves them!  We'll have a few for dessert and the remaining get eaten for breakfast or taken for lunch.  Absolutely delicious!

Really good recipe. The batter was so stiff I had to add 2T milk to get everything mixed properly. Next time I will sprinkle tops with sugar for a little something extra.

YUMMY!!! These were so great I could not wait for them to cool off!  I agree the batter seemed to be a bit dry when mixing but they turned out great!  I added a sprinkle of white sugar on the tops of mind before putting in the oven.  WONDERFUL recipe! Cannot wait to try other versions!

These muffins were amazing!  I added vanilla yogurt, and 1 cup of frozen mixed berries and 1 cup of mashed banana.  They stayed moist for over a week!!!  The perfect recipe if you've got some yogurt to get rid of. My husband raved about them.

I'm with the others that say that the texture was just too weird and that it's too much dry ingredients for the wet to incorporate.  First time I tried it I tried adding a little milk, but didn't like the result.  Thought it was b/c I altered the recipe.  So next time I made it exactly as the recipe read.  Still didn't like the texture.

Made healthy-I used 1.5 cups wheat flour and .5 cup quit cooking oats, worked just fine. I cut the sugar in half and they weren't very sweet, but that's ok. Used fat free yogurt and frozen blueberries. Yummy!! I'd say it was a nice mix between muffin and bread. Maybe if I made it more sugary it'd taste a little better but to keep it healthy, this is still a treat!

These came out pretty delicious! I didn't have enough blueberries, so I added some strawberries in the mixture. Also, when I was mixing the dry and wet ingredients, it didn't seem like it meshing well, so I added an extra teaspoon of (blueberry) yogurt. After baking, there are little pockets of yogurt in the muffins! Not sure if I should put them back in the oven, or keep them in the fridge, but it's really good!

I first made this recipe in 2008 when we ended up with large container of plain yogurt after company left. Just made another batch (again after company left). We freeze lots of blueberries every year so we make it with 2 cups of frozen blueberries and use 6-cup muffin pan (need to bake about 10 minutes longer).

Great recipe. We used frozen blueberries (slightly thawed) and french vanilla yogurt since we did not have blueberry yogurt on hand. We also added about 1/2 cup of ground flax seed. These came out soooo moist and yummy. We will definitely make these again!

The batter is very difficult to combine. I added a bit of milk and it still took a long time and effort to mix it all together. I used frozen blueberries (the recipe doesn't suggest either fresh or frozen) as I usually do in muffin recipes, and since it took so long to mix it all together the muffins turned a yucky sea monster green color.. not pretty. As for taste? Just okay. They are a bit dry. I won't be making these again.

I wish you could give rating in half-star increments! This is a 4.5: great recipe, lots of potential for different variation. I tried blueberries and about 2 tsp. of lemon zest, which turned out beautifully. The tops were a little sticky, but my family and I like our muffins that way, so it worked out fine for me! These were lovely and moist even though I used plain nonfat yogurt. I did add 2 T. of skim milk to loosen the batter just a touch. Next time I'll lower the sugar to half a cup and use  whole wheat flour for half the all-purpose but I can definitely live with just 4 T. of butter for a dozen great muffins! Thanks for sharing.

Very good muffins!  I used 1/4 cup applesauce and 1 tbsp canola instead of the butter and only 1/2 cup sugar.  I used equal amounts of fat free blueberry and fat free vanilla yogurt as I didn't have enough blueberry.  My only (small) complaint would be that I found them to be a bit too 'sticky/wet' (the tops), but that could be a result of me lowering the cooking temp, so will definitely repeat.  These did not lack in flavour at all, very yummy.

Awesome! I used a large banana, four strawberries, the rest of the 2 cups from blueberries, and plain non-fat yogurt. This was perfect for cleaning out my fridge. I made a dozen muffins and a mini loaf.

I loved the outcome of this "muffin" although it tasted more like a bread for me, still delicious! I used whole wheat flour instead of regular, replaced egg with egg substitute and replaced the sugar with splenda and only half the butter. I also used the fiber one yogurt and added small amount of oats and pecans. I used the strawberry flavored yogurt with smashed bananas...sooo good! Can't wait to try other flavors. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

These were absolutely delicious.  I used apricot/mango Greek yogurt, 1/2 sugar - 1/2 Splenda and substituted 1/4 C flour for oats.  I also sprinkled brown sugar on the top before they went into the oven and it gave them a nice top crunch.  They needed an extra 10 minutes in our oven but turned out perfect.

I made these last night.  The flavor is wonderful!  I did change a few things; I added about 1/4 cup of skim milk to thin the batter a bit (I could hardly stir it) and I substituted vanilla yogurt for the blueberry because that's all I had on hand.  I also added 1 tsp of lemon juice because I like the combination of lemon & blueberry flavors.  I will definitely make these again!

Yum! I doubled this recipe, used oil instead of butter, and added a shake of cinnamon. I chose Liberte No-Sugar-Added 6-grain strawberry yogurt. I didn't end up adding fruit, though I did add about 1/3 cup whole milk so I could get the batter properly stirred. These rose wonderfully and made great bread and a lovely loaf, with a thick, chewy crust. Yum! The batter was also very tasty. What a great way to use up yogurt & fruit!

We all liked it. Our yogurts were 6 ounces each. The batter was so dry, I added 12oz of yogurt. The muffins were kind of a weird consistentacy, too doughy even though toothpick came out clean. I cooked them another 7 minutes or so. I cut the sugar down too.  They are very good. Not your normal muffin consistency but plenty of yummy blueberries!

This recipe was super. I do however have a tendency of altering recipes sometimes. With this one I used 1/2 of the margarine called for and used whole wheat flour. I also added a handful of white chipits and a handful of chopped walnuts. For the fruit,I had some very ripe bananas and I used vanilla flavoured yogurt. Kids haven't tried them yet but I'm sure they'll love as I do. Thanks for this recipe. It's a keeper.  Shorti

This was a really nice recipe to try. I cut the sugar down to 2/3 cup and also the butter down to 2 Tbsp. I used low fat vanilla yogurt and just over 1 cup of frozen raspberries. I did get the sort of purpley effect in the batter but it looked great. Next time I will add the raspberries last for a different colouring effect. I baked the muffins ( 12 regular sized muffins ) for 20 mins @ 140 degrees ( forced-fan oven ) and they turned out really nice. Bottoms & tops were nice and brown with no burning and the centres were cooked. I will make these again and try different variations of yogurts ( all fat free ) and different fruit combinations. Thanks again for the posting!

Wow.  I am not a muffin fan.  At least a cakey muffin fan (I like the scone/bisquit variety), but I thought these muffins were FABULOUS.  I needed a way to get rid of yogurt and blueberries, and this fit the bill perfectly.  Even my husband loved it and he's not into baked goods.  The only change I made was using plain lowfat yogurt instead of fruity yogurt.  I also sprinkled a little sugar on top and dotted with melted butter for a nice finish.  Excellent!

I have made these twice, both times they have been DELICIOUS!!!  The first time I used low fat vanilla yogurt and the second time I used low fat maple vanilla yogurt.  Also, I read some other comments and added extra baking powder which seemed to really help.  To cut the fat I used egg whites and a butter substitute (Smart Balance).  Will make again and again!

I used lowfat strawberry yogurt and some frozen strawberries I had from last season in my freezer.  when the strawberries thawed they made their own juice.  I mashed them with a fork and added them to the recipe with the juice.  my 6 and 3 yr old boys devoured them!!!!!!  these are now a family favorite...plan on trying blueberry and peach next!!!!

Very good recipe. Incredibly moist and delicious. I substituted about one cup whole wheat flour for white flour. I used plain yogurt and added about two tablespoons of strawberry jam. For the fruit, I used bluberries and raspberries. I used large sized muffin tins and the batter rose well. I will definantely use this recipe in the future.

Very tasty.  Made exactly as directed, however, we did not have the blueberry yogurt, so used what we had on hand, which was strawberry yogurt.  My daughter brought it in for snack for her 3rd grade class and she reports it was a big hit.

These came out really well with raspberry yogurt and raspberries (frozen). The flavor is good and they had a nice appearance. I found that the amount of batter was perfect to make 12 standard muffins.

We love these.  Have made them numerous times using different fruits and yogurts and all have been great.  I usually cut the sugar down to 1/2 C and I use a non stick pan and spray it also and they never stick.  These are also so easy to make.

I thought my first batch were a bit bland but everyone else seemed to enjoy them. I added a bit of cinnamon to my next batch and put cream cheese and blueberry jam in the middle as a filling and this made them a bit yummier!

I'm not much of a baker, but these turned out well.  They were dense, but good...

I substitute the blueberries with 3 ripe bannanas, and add chocolate chips. They are pretty good I have to make them atleast 2 times a week!

Awesome recipe. Bursting with blueberries and so delicious. I found that it made such big muffins, I had to add about 5 minutes to the baking time, otherwise I made it exactly as posted and it was perfect.

My kids love these muffins!  They are so moist and plenty sweet for my family.  Can't wait to try them with other fruit/yogurt combinations!

moist fruity muffins. I put blueberries and strawberries together in these delicious muffins. Colorful and a great pleaser.
