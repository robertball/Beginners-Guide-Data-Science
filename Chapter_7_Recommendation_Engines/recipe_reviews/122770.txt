I love scrambled eggs and I love avocados, so I just had to try this! I cut the recipe in half and added some onion, red pepper and garlic. Once the egg mixture was done I added some cheddar cheese and let it melt. I left the bacon in strips and wrapped everything into warm tortillas - YUM!

I love avocado, so maybe my opinion is biased, but this was an excellent combination. I didn't bother to cube the avocado, just used a spoon to scoop out small chunks, then beat the eggs before pouring in.

Oh and if you've never cut an avocado before, just take a sharp knife and cut lengthwise from stem all the way around. There is a hard seed in the middle, you wont cut through.

I've been making this for years, but put the bacon in the egg mixture, and wait until the eggs are almost set before adding the avacado. I then love to add bites of avacado to the top for garnish. YUMM. Glad to see I'm not the only one who is avacado crazy.

Very good and very easy.  I used low-fat milk and topped with a little shredded cheddar cheese.

Awesome recipe, I really enjoyed it and it was quite filling.  I didn't use milk for dietary reasons.

I found this to be a wonderful light brunch!  Not to heavy but a distinct flavor of avocado in with the eggs.  I diced up some thin sliced ham and sub that for bacon, used low fat milk instead of regular and sprayed the pan lightly with oil to lighten up the recipe.  Over all it was great!  My boyfriend who is an amazing chef enjoyed it too.  Goes well with HP sauce or hot sauce.  MMMMM!

We make a similar dish with bacon,avocado,and a little mayonnaise in an omelet with mozzarella cheese.  And we serve it at our Bed and Breakfast. Guests love it.

This was actually better than I had expected it to be. It was very mild flavored and the bacon added that something special to it. This was great served with corn tortillas and salsa. The only thing negative was the eggs got a green tint to them after cooking with the avocado, so the visual wasn't so appealing on this dish. Thanks, I'll fix this again.

Hubs and I generally eat nice breakfasts on the weekends and we try to stay away from things like waffles, pancakes, and French toast.  That means we eat a lot of egg breakfasts and it's nice to find something like this recipe that adds some creativity to the same ol,' same ol.'  I added chopped mixed color bell peppers, minced jalapeno pepper, onions and garlic, which made the dish colorful - and it never hurts to add veggies for extra nutrition wherever you can.  The avocado is so mild it really doesn't add a whole lot taste-wise, but it makes this SO creamy, not to mention that it is considered one of the great super foods.  I topped this off with a little shredded cheese, more for garnish than anything else.  Hubs opted out of this as he didn't like the idea of avocado mixed with warm eggs, but I enjoyed it.

I made these eggs for breakfast this morning.  I liked them, although I think I'd probably mix in the bacon next time and eliminate some of the milk; it always makes for watery scrambled eggs, but I forgot that fact when I dumped in the milk.  Bf thought it was a weird combo but then said we were having green eggs and ham.  Maybe I'll mash them next time and prove him right!  ;o)  Thanks for the recipe!

Very very good. For a little zing top with a light salsa,   wife uses catsup on anything with eggs, but salsa is a refreshing boost.

Delicious! I loved it. :) I had to minus the bacon out of the recipe though, the bacon that I had in the fridge went bad. :( Oh well, it tasted great without it anyway!

I wasn't thrilled with this.  I like avocado, eggs and bacon...but it didn't quite seem to work together.  I thought it was a bit bland.  If there was another ingredient to give it more pizazz, it might be fine...but as is, it wasn't great for me.  I'm not a sassy cook, so I wouldn't know what would work to make it better...

I eyeballed the ingredients. Really liked the egg/avocado/bacon combination. Not something I would want all the time, but definitely nice for a change. Thanks, Sundra!

Followed the recipe - not much flavor - maybe cheese and some onions would help? The bacon helped it along.

This is a great recipe for avocado lovers! I halved the recipe, though. I didn't have bacon, so I used bacon bits to top. However, I decided to cook onions and garlic in butter for two minutes, then I added about a cup of frozen spinach and cooked until tender. Then I added the egg, milk and avocado mixture. It turned out delicious! I also topped off with shredded cheese blend. The opportunities with this recipe are endless!

Thanks for the starting point. I added chopped tomatoes; onion and sprinkled with goats' cheese instead of bacon. Goats' cheese is my favorite combo with avocado. The salt and pepper are important to add flavor.
