I have always made pies.  They're my specialty you might say!
Up until this past thanksgiving, I always used the pastry recipe that has been in our family cookbook for generations.
However, last year I moved 2000 miles away, and left my cookbook at my mothers.
When thanksgiving rolled around, the night I was to make the pies I couldn't get a hold of my mom to email the recipe to me.  So, I found this one online which is a very similar, but uses lard instead of crisco.
I'll never tell Aunt Phyliss, but this one is SO MUCH BETTER!  WAY flakier, a little easier to work with I found, and still tasted great.  I totally recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a pie crust recipe that will WOW everyone!  Take it from an experienced pie maker!

This is the best pastry crust I've ever tried, and I've tried MANY (the next closest would be the cream cheese pastry from "New Joy of Cooking").  It handles beautifully and is indeed flaky -I baked a piece alone with a bit of sugar on top just to see and taste, and it had quite a few layers and a lovely flavor.  The egg and baking soda make it puff (just a little) nicely.  The only difference is that I didn't need the whole cup of liquid, as I live in the Pacific Northwest and my flour must be kind of "wet", as I needed only 7 ounces of liquid to get the right consistency.

A beautiful crust indeed.

I have made many pie crusts over the years and this is by far the best tasting and the easiest to work with.  I made it in the food processor and took just minutes to make.  I used enough to make a 2 crust pie and froze the rest.  I took enough out to make another 2 crust pie and let it thaw at room temperature and it was just as good as the first one.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

It was very easy to make.  The first time I made it, I followed the directions exactly and I agree that not all the liquid was needed.  Otherwise, it was an excellent recipe thanks so much for sharing!!!

I have been using this crust for over a year since finding it on this site.  Everyone who has tasted it has said what a wonderfully tasty and flaky crust it is.  I do not always need to use the full liquid portion. I suggest that one adds it gradually and goes by feel.  This crust freezes so well and that makes it a great time saver.  Thanks Michelle for sharing.

I originally submitted this over 8-9 years ago.  Over the years I have made some changes.  I now leave my lard in the fridge and cut it into small cubes.  I also now use my standing mixer to make the pastry (with the flat beater) slowly adding the butter to the dry ingredients.  Finally I gradually add the wet ingredients.  Like many reviewers have mentioned the full cup of liquid is not always necessary.  Add it gradually until a ball forms.  It usually takes me 5 minutes.  To all of you who've commented on it being "gooey".  I would recommend you re-try the recipe, adding the liquid a bit at a time while stirring.  You can even use a food processor (according to a friend of mine).  I hope you enjoy it.  Michelle

For those who feel that there is too much liquid just beat your egg and add water to bring it up to the one cup mark.  This is perfect every time.

Thank you so much for this pastry recipe.  This is the first one that has actually turn out for me! Its easy to make and very flaky. I don't require all the liquid I use about 6 or 7 ozs. When I make it I always bake up a brown sugar and butter packet for me while my pies are baking.  Also this recipe freezes very well. 
Thanks again

I just LOVE this recipe!  I used it at Thanksgiving and got RAVE reviews on it.  It is easier than shortening type crusts and is much flakier.  It makes a few crusts so there is extra to freeze and use for later.

I subbed shortening for the lard, which converted is 2 CUPS.  The substitution worked great.  Like other cooks, I only used about 3/4 c of the water mixture.  Used my kitchenaid for the whole thing - took all of 5 minutes.  I used this crust with the Cherry Pie III recipe from this site.

This was my first pie crust and it turned out as promised...flaky and tasty, although I didn't have an easy time working with it...I assume that is probably characteristic of most pie crusts though.

My g/f was absolutely in heaven from this pastry. Was my first attempt at pastry, and it was magnificent. I thought it was a bit on the sickeningly fatty side (obviously due to the lard). ADVICE: don't make it unless you have a cutting machine. I was cutting the lard for about 1.5 hours with knives to get it to blend properly with the dough. Ouch!

I've gone through both shortening and butter phases in my life when it comes to crusts.  Suffice it to say, now that I've finally discovered lard, I may not be going back.

This is an excellent recipe, I like to use fresh lime juice in place of the vinegar though.

Also a note to the perfectionist, this is not a real flaky pastry, its a short crust pastry.

Contrary to the other reviews, I did not care for this pastry at all....didn't like the brown sugar taste and didn't like the consistency of the pastry. Will not use again.

Don't know what went wrong but I've tried the recipe twice and both times it came out just a big gooey glob.  To get it into any type of rolling consistency, I would have had to add so much additional flour it would have tasted awful and had the texture of something similar to plywood.  Just a lot of wasted time and ingredients.  Think I'll stick with what I've got and used for years.

Very flaky, will never go back to another (similar) recipe.  However, the reason for only 4 stars is that, in my opinion, this recipe needs at least 1c more flour to start with.  It's misleading with the recipe stating 1c. water, however the directions are quite clear. But there still needs to be more flour to begin with, otherwise you risk over-working the dough. My recommendation is to keep the liquids as per the instructions (1 cup total)but increase the flour at the start.
It's a nice, soft-ish, workable dough. I got 6-9"shells out of it.  I used shortening (Fluffo or Crisco) as I never have lard in the fridge but I always have the shortening in my pantry.  Perfect with the additional flour.  My go-to recipe here on out.

I tried this recipe, but was doubtful when it called for baking powder. Boy was I glad I tried it, my husband and daughter loved it! My husband told me to throw away my old recipe and keep this one. It works great just mixed up or froze and used later!

I am an experienced pie-maker who was leery of trying another pastry recipe besides my gramma's. Dare I say this one was better? Amazing! Thanks

you have to realize people come with a variety of up bringing- and the quality of their taste and style could be higher or lower than you might see for yourself...  GOOD could mean nothing to you if the person reviewing ate POOP all their life... and just because someone made something all their life doesn't make them the one to seek advice from
