11.5.16  Followed the directions as written, and I did add the optional sliced olives (which I would do again).   Just a little bit on the salty side for me (but then I did add olives), so Iâ€™ll cut that amount to 1/4 tsp in the future.  You get a little crunch from the cabbage, a pop of sweetness from the pomegranate seeds, and those olive slices add a bit of saltiness to the potatoes.  The dressing was perfectly balanced. I'm not sure if you'd call this a salad or a potato side dish.  Whatever, it was good!   farah,  thanks for sharing.  *****UPDATE 11.7.16*****  FYI in case you're interested, we ate this both chilled and warm, and preferred it warm.
