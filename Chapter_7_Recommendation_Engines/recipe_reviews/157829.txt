This is a good starter recipe for me. I did make some changes for my personal and family's tastes. I used the zest from two oranges (some zest reserved for the glaze I made) and their juice in place of bottled juice. It was just the ticket to mask the cake mix taste and make this taste like a fresh, homemade, from-scratch cake. I used a bundt pan and instead of cream cheese frosting, I used a glaze of confectioner's sugar, a tad of butter, and some of the zest and juice. DELICIOUS! Definitely a keeper!

I made the mistake of not reading this properly before I told my daughter-in-law I was bringing a orange/pumpkin breakfast loaf for our weekend visit! I went ahead with it and super happy I did!  This made a fabulous loaf (I didn't ice it) so incredibly moist and delicious!

This is our new family favourite cake!  I mistakenly made it the first time with too much pumpkin and it resulted in a delicious, moist, "cheesecake" - like dessert.  I make it both ways now... and to ice it I simply whip cream cheese and icing sugar and then fold in whipped fresh cream.... out of this world!!!
