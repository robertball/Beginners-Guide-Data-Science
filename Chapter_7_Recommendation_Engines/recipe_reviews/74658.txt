These turned out really well for me.  My changes: 1 cup of brown sugar for 2 cups of white, 3 cups of peaches instead of 2 cups, 1 cup apple sauce and 1/4 cup oil for instead of 1 1/4 cup oil, added some dried cranberries. My sister called me the muffin queen!

This is one of the best muffin recipes I've ever tried.  I say best because I've often had difficulty baking muffins that actually puff up tall in the pans when baking, and this definitely makes delicious, springy, moist muffins.

I agree with a few posters that some additional liquid can be used, which was my method for baking.  However, I don't think this takes away from the recipe because it may have to do with the freshness of the peaches used.  Very ripe fresh peaches would not require as much liquid to make a substantial batter.
I have also tried baking the recipe as a loaf, and that came out equally as good.

I also think this is a very solid recipe that is open to changes - some cranberries or nuts would make nice additions.  But on its own, it's wonderful.  I highly recommend it.

These are very good muffins.  I followed other users' advice and added a half cup of milk to the batter, which helped.  The first time I made these they burned around the edges, so the next time I used paper baking cups to line the pans and cooked them for just 20 minutes; they turned out perfect.  I definitely recommend using fresh peaches rather than canned.  These muffins have a great texture and aren't too sweet.  Thanks for sharing!

My gosh these were good!  Used fresh peaches right off the tree and boy, oh boy, you can surely tell the difference between the fresh and canned ones.  Only thing I did differently was to add peach colored sugar crystals to the top of the muffin prior to baking.  BTW - these freeze beautifully.  We just finished the last batch that were in the freezer from last Aug/Sept and they still tasted like a little bit of sunshine!!!

I cut this recipe in half. Because I didn't want to use half of an egg, I used both eggs and cut out the extra two tablespoons of vegetable oil. As with all muffin recipes I make, I used a teaspoon each of baking powder and baking soda. This recipe was okay--the muffins came out dry. If I were to make this again, I'd add a teaspoon of vanilla as well and maybe add some pureed peaches as well in place of some of the oil called for in this recipe and to make up for some of the liquid that's missing. For a half recipe, I got 12 muffins that were on the small side. I baked mine at 350 and they were done a just under 20 minutes.

These muffins were great...I didn't have fresh peaches so I used canned in natural juice. I also thought the batter was too thick so I used about 1/2 cup of reserved juice to loosen up the batter. I made 12 muffins and a loaf of bread out of this recipe. On top of the muffins I added a tiny bit of cinnamon and sugar and on half of them sliced almonds.
We will be making these again and again.... Thanx for the recipe!

This is the best recipe ever. I followed it exactly. I had wonderful results. I had peach muffins in a local chain restaurant here in Georgia. I bought a bucket of their batter. 
This recipe leaves their muffins way behind. Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

Great peach muffin! I love fresh peaches and this muffin recipe is a great way to use them up. I used 2 tsp. of cinnamon vs. a tbsp and 1 & 1/2 cups of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. I also addded 2 tsp. of vanilla. I love the large muffins that Perkin's Restaurant has, so I baked these in 8 Texas sized muffin cups. I topped them with turbinado sugar before popping them in the oven. Overall, very good.

Loved this recipe, especially the simplicity! Batter thickness worried me at first until I added the peaches which were really ripe.  After that, didn't need to add any additional liquid.  Came out perfect and tasty.  Only modification I made was for my diabetic parents.  Substituted 2 c sugar with 2 c Splenda.  Also added 1 more cup of peaches (approx. 7 peaches total).  This then made 24 muffins in my silicon muffin forms with some leftover.  Will make this again and again.  Might even try diff. kind of flour.

I used 3 cups of chopped peaches and the muffins turned out very tasty, moist and peachy.  6 very large peaches gave me the 3 cups.  I also used almost double the cinnamon, 1/2 cup olive oil, 3/4 cup applesauce, 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups AP and baked them for only 20 minutes.  My peaches were slightly bitter so I didn't adjust the sugar at all and they turned out perfect that way.  It made 24 total regular sized muffins.  To get the skins off, I use the trick of putting the peaches in boiling water for 1 minute which also makes them slice & chop very easily.

I actually have a question or two. I am having a brunch for my daughter's graduation this weekend. I decided to do a practice run thru on these muffins. Two things: first, the recipe made 22 muffins. Did I do something wrong? And two: is there anyway to freeze muffins for a few days so I can use these on Saturday? Thanks!

They're pretty good. As it was said before the batter is REALLY thick and 1/2 cup of milk helps to cut it a bit. 

The only other problem I ran into was that the parts around the peaches (in the baked muffins) were very gooey and did not bake very well.

These were REALLY good, but did need that bit of milk as others suggested.  The key to "fluffy" is the amount of air you have in your batter.  Which means, do not "beat" your batter.  Using a fork, fold your batter gently 4-5 times, then turn and scrape the side of your bowl and fold 4-5 times more.  Continue until it is just moist.  STOP!  You are done.  Now add in any fruits you wish to use and JUST fold in enough to seperate the fruit and gently put into your pan.    I decided to put this batter into a 12" decorated bundt pan and it turned out wonderfully!  Took about 90 minutes though. (start checking at 75 min).  I also sprinkled a butter/brown sugar/flour/oatmeal in the bottom of the pan which added a little crispy to the top.  MMMM good!  For colour, I added 1 cup of blueberries to.  This was great and I will definetely make in the form of muffins to!

This recipe was delicious it tasted a lot like cinnamon but when you got a piece of peach it was delicious. The only problem was I tried this recipe on a hot night and my mom was not too happy that it heated up the house. But she wasn't too mad because the next morning she brought one to school with her. Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent!! I had some fresh peaches to use up before they went completely bad on me. These were a big hit with the family! We could not stay out of them. I followed the recipe with one exception (if you count the nuts, then it's two)...Instead of using the full amount of oil called for,I used 1/2 c. of oil and used applesauce for the remaining oil. This is a keeper! Thanks.

Delicious! My husband (semi-picky breakfast eater) wasn't too excited when I told him what I was making, but then ate half a dozen by himself. I didn't need any extra liquid since my peaches were very ripe and juicy. I don't know where 16 muffins came from...I got almost 3 dozen out of this recipe. I would definitely use paper liners, too. Since the recipe made so many, I didn't have enough, and the ones I baked without the liners stuck to the pan quite a bit...UPDATE: I just got some more paper liners, and made these again with a couple of changes. 1 cup packed brown sugar instead of 2 cups white, and replaced 1 cup of the oil with applesauce. They are just as yummy, and healthier, too! I'll make them like this from now on.

Giving this a 5 star rating even though I made changes.  The changes were not because of the recipe, but due to lack of ingredients needed. Because of other reviews, I scaled the recipe down to 8 (1/2 recipe) and still made 12 muffins.  This is going to sound crazy...but the muffins came out AWESOME!  I substituted the oil with melted butter (equal measure). I used cornstarch in place of the eggs (2 Tbsp per egg). I used a 15 oz. can of Lite peaches in pear juice in place of the fresh peaches and I did add some of the juice since the mixture was dry (I didn't measure, just poured). I also subbed 1/2 of the sugar with brown sugar. The muffins came out awesome!  Some type of topping would be good but not needed. Definitely a "keeper". Thanks for sharing!

Excellent muffins!  Moist and flavorful.  I made the following changes:  substituted 1 cup wheat flour and 1 cup oat flour (ground oats in my food processor) for 2 cups of the all-purpose flour; substituted 3/4 cup applesauce for 3/4 cup of the oil; and reduced the amount of sugar to 1 cup.  Healthier and yummy!

I used half whole wheat and half all purpose flour, added 1 tsp baking powder, used 1 cup fat free sour cream for 1 cup oil, added 1 tsp vanilla and reduced sugar to 1 cup. Made 18 large muffins that baked in 25 minutes perfectly, very nice change.

Great recipe - very yummy! Even my *extremely* picky husband loved these!  Modifications: I used 3 c. fresh frozen peaches, 1 c. brown sugar, 3/4 c. white sugar, 1 c. applesauce & 1/4 c. oil.  Next time I make these (& there WILL be a next time!), I will sprinkle coarse sugar on top, or maybe a streusel... like a peachy coffe cake!

Absolutely delicious! I read through all the reviews for ideas on how to improve the recipe. This is what I did: Used 1/2 wheat flour, 1/2 AP flour; 1/2 melted butter, 1/2 olive oil; 1/2 white sugar, 1/2 brown sugar; added a good glug of vanilla extract, and a handful of walnut pieces. The recipe made 12 large muffins which I baked at 395f for about 22mins. Next time, I'll add more peaches and walnuts. Thanks!

Just had to try this one after moving to Niagara in peach season.  Delicious, moist muffin.  I cut back sugar by 1/2 cup and also used 3/4 c. apple sauce in place of 3/4 c. of the vegetable oil (still used 1/2 c. vegetable oil).  I'll make this one again next year.

Got rave reviews from co-workers with this one.  Used frozen peaches.  I got 24 muffins out of this recipe.

Really enjoyed this recipe. I used fresh frozen peaches I had in the freezer, once thawed drained most of liquid and used recipe as written. The only other thing I did differently was to sprinkle the top with a bit of sugar.

I just made peach jam with my mom and thought, "There has to be something I can do with these peels instead of throw them away." So I thought I'd run them through my food processor and bake them in something. I searched for peaches recipes found yours for peach muffins. I had exactly 2 cups after I processed the peach peels (from 7 large peaches)! Let me just say that my 3 teenage boys and their friend devoured them! Thank you so much for this recipe! Try it with your peels next time. :)

Great muffins! Light and moist, with great peach flavor. Like other reviewers I did make some changes - 1 c applesauce for 1 c of oil, 1 c brown sugar for 1 c of the granulated, and added 1 tsp vanilla. The batter was the perfect consistency after adding the peaches. I filled the cups 2/3 full and sprinkled raw sugar on top before baking. My yield was 22 muffins.

I adjusted the recipe down to serve 12 and followed it exactly.  I thought they were mediocre at best.  Lots of peach, which I liked, but they were greasy -- too much oil! Andy they didn't rise much. I will look for a different recipe

These are really tasty!  I used a can of peaches and 1 fresh peach.  I also cut down the oil to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 cup of apple sauce.  They cooked quickly. I probably will use a little less sugar next time though.

I made several changes.  Bake at 375F instead of 400F.  I changed oil to butter, used only 1 cup.  I added 1tsp of vanilla and mixed the sugar with 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar.  I also added a 1/2 cup of milk.  They are little mini personal size cobblers!

My neighbor gave me some peaches last week and I had no idea what to do with them, so of course I came to Allrecipes.  Found this recipe and it sounded very simple.  The only thing I didn't like was how much oil was in it so I substituted the oil with one cup of applesauce and only used a quarter cup of oil.  I also added a crumb topping with some flour cinnamon, brown sugar and a dab of butter.  They came out awesome!  I love this recipe and it will go down as a new favorite.

I bought some fresh peaches and needed to use them so tried this recipe and so glad I did. I put them in large muffin cups and it makes 8 large muffins. I put a crumb topping on them before baking of 1/4 c. white sugar, 3 T. flour, 2 T. butter, 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  Baked them at 375 for 30 minutes. Perfect. I took them to a friend that had been sick and could not eat and she wanted to try these. She loved them. Said those are her favorite at a famous restaurant that serves big muffins in their bakery and these stood up to them. Thanks for the recipe. I will be making these again. I froze some also and they reheat great.

Definitely tasty and original! I added a strudel topping to give them a bit more sweetness, and I also added pecans to the recipe. The dough was a bit dry as other reviewers have mentioned. So, I added about one tablespoon of milk.

These were really tasty and moist.  I only adjusted the recipe by adding about a teaspoon of vanilla and about 1/2 cup more peaches.  My girlfriends and family loved them and they were even delicious the next day.  FYI- The recipe made 24 muffins and there was only 1 left the next day. :)

I followed this recipe exactly except for adding a teaspoon of vanilla and I was 1/2 a cup of peaches short. I added a tablespoon of sugar to my peaches as well and it made a nice syrup.

The batter was EXTREMELY thick, like a cookie dough. I thought I had done something wrong but I persevered. I added the peaches and it loosened up a little, but not that much.

I was tired and ready to go to bed so I just spooned them into the muffin pan.

They looked wonderful when they came out of the oven and when they had cooled down enough to eat.....

WOW! They taste SOOOOOOO good! (Especially after the spiced peach oatmeal muffin fiasco. DON'T waste your fresh peaches on that!)

But back to the peach muffins......It doesn't taste like a peach cobbler, to be sure. It tastes more like a cookie! Reminds me of snickerdoodles. Then when you get a bit of peach with it, it's like a party in your mouth!

The only change I would make is to add a cup of peaches to the 1/2 cup I was short. 

My daughter wants me to add that it's so sweet it makes your taste buds go wild.

This is a recipe I will definitely make again.

Pretty good. Only reason its not five stars is because there isn't a real strong peach flavor. My daughter thought it was a snickerdoodle muffin with fruit. I cut cinnamon in half because it seemed like a lot, glad I did (and I love cinnamon). I topped mine with turbindo sugar which added a nice crunch and shiny look. Will likey make again. (I used canned peaches so I suppose it could have made it less "peachy" flavored).

Turned out awesome. Tastes like mini cobblers without the mess! I accidentally mixed all the dry ingredients instead of making an oil mixture with the sugar. Still turned out great. Will definitely make these again!

These are delicious!  I did make a few changes though:
- one cup of vegetable oil
- only one cup of sugar (they're still plenty sweet; if you have a real sweet tooth, you could go higher)
- I used about three cups of canned peaches
- I also sprinkled the tops with rolled oats and cinnamon before baking
- Bake for 20 minutes!
I would definitely recommend these- they're like a fluffy cobbler!

Fabulous, light, fluffy muffins.  I took the suggestions of some other reviewers and used more peaches (4 whole ones, peeled and pitted, then run through a food processor), 1/2 cup of milk, replaced 1/2 cup of the vegetable oil with applesauce, and then cut the sugar back to adjust for the fact that I'd used cinnamon applesauce.  I ended up using 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown.  They were done a couple minutes early too, so keep an eye/nose on them.

i tried the version that used 1/4 c oil and 1 c applesauce to lessen the fat.  i would make the recipe as is next time as i found it lacked the muffin soft/light consistency.  sometimes substitutions just are not worth the quality of your final product!!  please note that i didn't let my substitutions affect the rating of this recipe.

I made these changed sugar to 1 1/4 cup white sugar and 1 cup dark brown sugar. Also used canned peaches because I didn't have fresh :-( They were wonderful I'm sure fresh would be to die for! I topped with Demerara sugar and slivered almonds. A real keeper!!!! Thanks so much for the recipe!!!

Peach cobbler taste in a muffin.  I cut the sugar back by 1/2 cup and they were still plenty sweet and flavorful.  I was able to make 12 regular sized muffins and one loaf pan for my freezer. A keeper for sure.

These were delicious, though mine turned out more like a sweet bread (like pumpkin or zucchini bread) than a muffin.  A wonderful summertime treat.

Very tasty but too sweet.  It may be because I used canned peached.  Next time, I will add half the sugar.

Not sure what I did wrong, but these were extremely dry. I even added milk like suggested, but I couldn't even eat one! :( Oh, well, will keep looking.....

I used fresh peaches in these muffins and followed the recipe exactly. I've made them three times now and none of the batches worked out. They were crusty on the outside and doughy in the center. The doughy flavor was yummy but certainly not servable. I do realize this could be due to some error on my part so I wouldn't discourage others from trying them. I just know I won't be making them again.

This reciepe is wonderful I changed it a tiny, I added 1/2 cup of milk, extra cup of peaches, I let them sit with a few tbs. of sugar which helped the juices draw out of the peaches. I only added 1 cup of canola oil. They are so moist. Terrific.

My family really needed to use up some peaches so I picked this recipe since I figured I could freeze some. I made a healthier version by using whole wheat flour for a half of the total flour, mostly unsweetened applesauce for the oil, and using anout 1-1 1/2 cups of sugar. Still, they were very moist. Next time for a little more flavor, I'll add some ground nutmeg. I wouldn't go out of my way to make these, unless I had some too ripe peaches. Pretty good!

These are great! However, like someone else's stated review...I just cannot follow a recipe all the way through. I made some modifications because both me and husband are diabetic. 

I took some suggestions from the other reviews and really tweaked some ingredients to suit us. 

I used 2 cups white flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour. Used 1 cup sugarless applesauce and 1/4 cup oil. 1 cup Splenda and 1/2 cup Splenda Brown Sugar. 

Added 1 cup chopped Mutsu apple (because I like the crunch of it), 1/2 cup dried cranberries, 1/2 cup chopped walnuts, 1 teaspoon baking powder and 1/2 cup fat free sour cream. Some of these are suggested by other reviewers and that was very helpful to me.

I did coat all the fruit and the walnuts with the combined flours, as someone else suggested. 

I ended up with 24 cupcake sized muffins and 12 mini muffins.

BTW my husband is eating them as I type this - but the real test will be our neighbor down the road. He's the muffin man in these parts! He'll either give me a two thumbs up, or a two thumbs down! I'm pretty sure I'll get them up tho'! :)

Yummy! These were delicious. I made some substitutions. I used 1 3/4 C lightly packed brown sugar in place of the white. I used 2 tins of peaches in natural fruit juice, drained. I used the drained liquid in the wet ingredients in place of 3/4C of the oil. Finally, I sprinkled some raw sugar on the tops before baking. This recipe made 18 regular muffins and 1 slightly flat (but delicious) cake. My husband loved these and was thrilled they were so light. Definitely a make again recipe.

Wow, these are truly amazing. I did follow others advice and added 2 tsp of vanilla, added 1 tsp of b. soda and powder, 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1 1/2 cups of white sugar, 1/4 cup of milk. I also used 2 1/2 cups of peaches. My peaches were off our tree and they were quite juicy, but I still needed 1/4 cup milk. They are truly wonderful muffins. A keeper for sure for us. ***made these for a 2nd week in a row. Again, amazing! I had so much batter I was able to make 12 regular muffins and 6 large muffins.

Loved this recipe. Definitely did some doctoring up though.... 

- I used 2 cups all-purpose flour + 1 cup whole wheat pastry flour
- I used 2/3 cup apple butter + 1/3 cup of greek yogurt in place of the oil
- Added 2/3 cup of vanilla coconut milk
- Cut the sugar to 1 cup
- Added 3 cups of peaches

It was fantastic! Made more than enough for 12 muffins and then a small loaf of bread. Highly recommend!

We live next to a peach orchard and pick peaches once a year, usually about 50 pounds or so.  I found this recipe years ago and have made it every year.  I don't make the muffins, but the bread.  This is a very good recipe.  The bread freezes very well, and is wonderful for breakfast with a hot cup of coffee.  At first I was a little hesitant about trying this recipe because of all the vegetable oil that it calls for for, but found that the oil is what makes it so moist.  This is a recipe I will continue to make through the years.

Very good and easy recipe. I substituted 1/2 cup of the oil for 1/2 of applesauce, 1/2 cup of white sugar for brown sugar, and added a 1/2 cup of milk. They took a little longer to bake, but were very yummy. Next time, I think I'll add a pecan-crumb topping for some texture.

These were pretty good, but not anything really special--thus the 4 stars.  They were just good muffins with peach pieces in them.  They might have been a little more interesting with chopped walnuts, but had grandchildren for brunch and was sure they wouldn't like the nuts.  Would make them again if served with another kind of muffin also, so that they would be complemented by the second type of muffin.  I did also make the pumpkin apple streusel muffins on this site for the brunch and the peach muffins were nice with them.

These got really brown in the oven and were generally kind of unattractive, plus they used too much sugar and oil for my personal tastes---hence only four stars.  But the taste was great, and everyone at GCF loved them.  Great use for Farmers' Market peaches!

My husband and I enjoyed these muffins. I tweaked the recipe a little in an attempt to make them a bit healthier. I used 2c regular and 1c whole wheat flour, substituted applesauce for half of the oil, and decreased the sugar to about 1.5c. I also added a splash of milk since the batter was a little stiff. Mine were perfectly done at 20 minutes. They had just the perfect amount of sweetness for a quick tasty breakfast. Will definitely make again; may even try with apples instead of peaches.

So good. I actually made half the recipe and still got 12 muffins, using two eggs and white whole wheat flour. The batter is stiff until  you stir in the peaches.

I made this recipe exactly as stated with the exception of making half the amount.  The dough is thicker than the usual muffin batter which made me check the recipe again to be sure I wasn’t missing an ingredient.  If you want a prominent peach flavor, I recommend adding more fresh peaches than the recipe calls for.

I made a small batch of 4 giant muffins.  I didn't bother to peel the peach because the skin is so thin it's not a bother.  I also stirred in small cubes of cream cheese and used half brown, half white sugars.  I ended up stirring a little milk in too and sprinkled turbinado sugar on top before baking.  Smelled like pancakes in the oven, lol.  Had to bake almost 10min longer than specified since I made big muffins.  These came out quite yummy!  I will make these again!

Made the muffins and the loaf of bread at the same time.  The only recommendation I would have is to use more peaches.  I was looking for a strong peachy taste, but didn't get that.  I like for people to bite into what I bake and be able to identify what they're eating. Still very tasty!

I had lots of delicious peaches so I was looking for a way to use them up.  My grandkids love cupcakes so this recipe caught my eye.  I made the following adjustments to the recipe:  following other readers advise I used half white and half brown sugar, I decrease the oil to 1 cup and I added an additional 1 cup of peaches.  Absolutely fabulous.  Will definitely make again.

These muffins were awesome! I used honey instead of sugar and replaced 1/2 cup of the flour with oatmeal. Also just added 3/4 cup water to make the batter a bit thinner, after reading the reviews. Turned out sooo yummy. Thanks for the recipe!

LOVED these hot from the oven.  They are so tasty--perfect blend of cinnamon, sweetness, and peach.  Next time, I will serve them with vanilla ice cream, as they taste like a fluffy cobbler.  (A couple of changes I made--used 1 part wheat, 1 part white, and 1 part wheat germ for the flour mixture; subbed half applesauce for the oil; did half brown sugar instead of all white sugar.)

OMG!  These were wonderful!  Thank you for your tips Jibber. I was worried when I saw the 1 1/4 cup oil.  My batter turned out moist and fluffy.  My muffins were bronze and delish!

This recipe is my favorite for fruity muffins (along with a Hummingbird Bakery recipe). I've used  it with peaches, pineapples and bananas so far, and it's always superb! The only change I usually do is that I try for the fruit to be moist in some way, so the muffins turn out moist too. And I have to add that I'm a disaster with the oven! Anything that doesn't have to go in the oven, I can do, but baking is not my forte, and still this muffins come out beautiful and delicious every time! Thanks a lot for the recipe.

There is nothing wrong with the recipe, but it is hard to get anything to have a really nice, intense peach flavor, outside of eating a peach or making a cobbler.

I had to use up a few peaches that didn't taste very good when they were fresh.  They were the kind of peaches that were gross and mushy, so I didn't think that this recipe could work with them.  Anyways, I was totally wrong!  These muffins were fantastic!  The only minor changes were that I subbed 2 cups of sugar with 1 cup of brown sugar.  I also added half a cup of crushed pineapple in the place of 1/2 of oil.  Surprisingly good and easy!

I blended the peaches so they were more of an applesauce consistency. I increased the amount of peaches to 3 cups and then cut the cup of oil (only using 1/4 c.) I love the flavor of cloves with peaches so I added cloves (that's a matter of taste. I used a tablespoon but many may find that overwhelming.) I also doubled the cinnamon.

Gooey, not super sweet, goodness!   I changed a few things: instead of 1 1/4 c. oil I used 3/4 c. applesauce & 1/2 c. oil;  1 c. brown sugar instead of 2 c. white sugar; 2 1/2 c. of really ripe peaches. I would also do 1/2 the cinnamon next time because it was a little much for me!

kind of surprised at all the 5 star reviews this has gotten. it's not a bad recipe but just not worth 5 stars in my opinion. i made up the batter just as it's written, then realized the reviewers are right, it's too thick. added 1/2 C milk and it was still pretty thick. added an extra cup of chopped peaches and gave it a go. first batch overcooked at 20 min. second batch was fine at 15 min. but the muffin was still pretty dry. not bad, but could have been better.

Pretty good muffin.  They were a little dry.  I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  I purried most of the peaches so there weren't as many chunks (my kids don't like the fruit pieces).

I just made these this morning, and they turned out great. Would also be great base mixture for apple, banana, blueberry as well. -Changes: 2 cups peaches=@3 peaches, would use 1 or 2 more peaches, they were delicious. Also added 1 tbsp vanilla and 1/2 cup milk!!

great recipe, and so easy!  My version:  3 1/2 c. peaches, melted butter instead of oil, only 2 tsp. cinnamon, plus 1/2 tsp. ground cardamom.  As my family says:  Yummola!  I also made these in mini muffin pans. Takes about 15 min. to bake.

These were great! They rose well and have a lovely deep brown color. I had to add ~1/2 c. milk as others suggested to thin the batter. I substituted splenda for all of the sugar and added 1 extra tsp of baking soda based on the Splenda box recommendation. I made peach & blueberry as well as a peach & strawberry batch and both came out great.

These are, hands down, the best muffins I've ever had. They were not dry at all, not too sweet, but extremely flavorful. I did not find the need to top it with butter-or anything for that matter!  I did make a few changes. I added 1/4 tsp of orange extract, and added a handful of blueberries. I also was a tad bit of afraid of using 1 whole tablespoon of cinnamon, so I used 1 tsp. When I tried the muffin, that seemed enough to me.  Also, these were definitely done at 22 minutes (in my oven). Also, I don't know what pans you guys are using, but the batter I had made just one short of two dozen regular sized muffins.   I also found that five small peaches equaled to the needed 2 cups of chopped peaches (in case that helps anybody out :) ).  This is a fantastic, delicious, healthy, and very fast recipe. Thanks FBGMOMOF4!!!

The best muffins I have ever tasted, and so incredibly good it's motivated me to write my first review.  Per other suggestions, used 4 peaches, half whole wheat flour, half brown and half white sugar, walnuts, and orange soaked cranberries.  Mmmmm. Then tried applesauce instead of oil.  Mmmm. Then half ground flaxseed and half applesauce instead of oil with still whole wheat flour---then as my husband said, "Tasted a little more like homework."  I have made them 3 times this week w/the variations.  When these muffins are at the top of recipes on this site, I can't wait to say I knew them back when they only had 100 reviews.... ;)

My whole family loved these muffins!  I did as others suggested and added 1/2 cup milk and an extra cup of peaches.  They were nice and moist.  I used 1 cup whole wheat flour, 2 cups white.  I also decreased the baking time to about 20 minutes.

Oh, these are good. I didn't have quite enough peaches, so I made a half batch. Out of a desire to make the recipe a little more interesting, I added a splash of vanilla and swapped a little less than half the white sugar with brown, as well as sprinkling the top with a little extra brown sugar for a more interesting texture. My only problem with this recipe is that the muffin itself is a bit bland, when compared to the delectable, soft peach bits within. I'm planning on making these again, but I'll replace a quarter cup of oil with one pureed or crushed peach. This would also help make them moister - they already are, but more couldn't hurt.  I would also advise you not to worry if the batter seems very thick before you fold in the peaches - their juice will take care of that.

I did exactly what the recipe said and it turned out very oily and strange.  I had a feeling the muffins weren't going to do well in the oven.  They cooked too fast on the outside so I ended up with dark brown on the outside and raw batter on the inside.

This recipe was great!  I made the following "tweaks" - I substituted whole wheat flour for half the white flour and added 1 tbsp gluten to ensure the muffins would be fluffy.  I also substituted half the white sugar with brown sugar and 1/2 cup of the oil with OJ.  Then I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  These were absolutely delicious!  My son and I couldn't keep our fingers out of the batter.  I ended up making 26 muffins out of this recipe.

Wonderful recipe.  I made a mini version for my daughters pre-school class.  I substituted applesauce for part of the oil, added a pinch of nutmeg and baked for 12 minutes in a mini muffin pan.  After cooling partway I dipped to tops of the muffins in melted butter and then cinnamon and sugar.  They were a big hit with teachers requesting the recipe.

This was a good recipe, I too needed to use some peaches. I added more than the 2 cups called for and I used frozen peaches with excellent results. My husband and 2 kids have eaten a bunch already, I may not have any for our road trip tommorrow! :-)

Used light brown sugar instead of white, and added a brown sugar/cinnamon sprinkle on top before baking for a nice caramalized sugar crust. I also added a bit of nutmeg. Baking for exactly 25 minutes is perfect! I used paper muffin liners for easier clean-up. They were delicious. Probably most any fruit can be used with this recipe.

Did 1 cup oil plus 1/2C sour cream. Closer to 21/2 C peaches. Added 2T peach juice also as the batter seemed a lil dry. Topped with strudel topping of equal parts oatmeal, flour, sugar, butter and 1T cinnamon. Made 12 jumbo muffins. Baked @350 convection.

I substituted the oil with 1/4 cup organic salted butter and 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce. I followed the recipe exactly and used all organic ingredients. They came out super moist and fluffy and very good! However, they were way too sweet and next time I will use 1 cup of sugar or 3/4 cup of sugar.

These turned out quite nice following the recipe as written except one substitution of apple sauce for oil.  Next time I would cut out 1/4-1/2 cup sugar as I felt they were a little sweet for my taste but my husband and son liked them just as they were.  Will be making again.

Just finished making (and eating) these.  WOW!  Let me start my saying I love muffins but they never seem to work out for me the way I hope.  The texture is never quite right  But, these were excellent.  The texture was perfect and the taste were spot on.  I could see using these as a base with any fruit or even without fruit since the cinnamon gives them such a great taste.  The batter was VERY thick and I was tempted to add milk as some reviewers suggested but I decided to just stick with the recipes as written.  I'm glad I did!  I used fresh peaches.  I only had to cook mine 20 minutes and I'm glad I checked then because I think 25 would be too long.  This recipe is a keeper!

I do not know how my taste could be so different from all the reviews I had read about "best muffin ever" and "great".  I followed the recipe but  used some applesauce as several reviewers suggested and did not beat the batter much as was suggested.  They were dry and heavy as soon as they came out of the oven, and I did not overbake (actually they took closer to 18 minutes, not 25.  I am so sorry that I wasted all those delicious peaches.  If anyone has an idea of what went wrong , let me know.

These were good. I made them with less sugar, and half the oil. I replaced half the oil with applesauce. I used canned peaches & it turned out fine.

These were delicious. We had a lot of extra peaches and I was trying to figure out what to do with them so I made this. I cut out half a cup of the sugar and they were still really good. I already made two batches and plan on making more soon.

This could have been a five star recipe, but I made it AS IS (I always do the first time, if I intend to rate it), and it was only okay. The high sugar content caused them to almost burn at 400. I turned it down to 325 to finish cooking the center and just salvaged them. They're good, but a bit bland, overly sweet, quite greasy, and very dense. Next time, I will increase the moisture so they get a better rise (some milk, perhaps), use only one cup of brown sugar, add way more fruit (some raspberries or cranberries would be great), a touch of vanilla, and less oil (or applesauce instead of half the oil). These have potential!

Yum! This recipe is delicious! I followed some other reviews and substituted one of the cups of white sugar with 3/4 brown sugar and they turned out perfect! I also used fresh peaches.  I made 24 muffins with this recipe.

I baked these at 375 for 15 minutes in mini muffin tins.  Bakes 48 muffins.  Turned out great, the kids loved them :)  I didn't need to add any milk or anything, I used the ingredients as written.

These muffins were delicious . I edited the servings to 12 but still ended up with 16 muffins.  I made the following revisions to the adjusted recipe: used 2 1/2 c flour, 2 tsp cinnamon, nearly 3/4 c of canola oil, 4oz cup of unsweetened applesauce, 2 eggs, 2 cups of peaches (could have used more though), 1/2 c white sugar/Splenda and 1/2 c light brown sugar and I added 1/4 c of whole milk.  I used a 1/4 c scoop to fill the muffin cups to about 1/4inch from top.  And I topped them off with a mixture of 2 Tbsp of white and brown sugar, 2-3 Tbsp of chopped walnuts and @ 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I baked them at 350 for around 15 min and they were perfect.  The only thing I need to figure out is how to disburse the peaches evenly through batter.  My entire family enjoyed even my 1 year old twins and my almost 4 year who said they were delicious!!!

Great way to use up peaches. I've made this several times, always with healthy changes and subs. I change the servings to 12, using 1 c AP flour, 1 c WW flour, and 1/8 c each ground flaxseed and wheat germ. I also sub Splenda blends (1/2 white, 1/2 brown) for the sugars, and 3/4 c natural applesauce and 1 6-oz ff peach yogurt for the oil. I like to throw in cinnamon and vanilla as well. Always very moist. I usually make mini-muffins baked @ 375 for 20 min.

This was a great way to use up that big bag of over-ripe peaches from the tree! The bread was very tasty and had a perfect consistency, but I did have a problem with the oven temp--the muffins got too done on the outside before the middle was done! I would try baking them on 350 max next time. Otherwise a great recipe! Thanks!

Muffins turned out great, I did substitute about 1/2 c. applesauce and did 3/4 c. oil, and added about 3 cups of fresh peaches, and a splash of vanilla. I also made up a quick struesel topping with flour, butter, brown sugar, white sugar, cinnamon and pecans and topped them with it before baking. My kids loved them,  I will make them again next time I have lots of peaches to use.

Very good, tastes like peach cobbler! I used 1c whole wheat pastry flour and 2c bread flour. I too, as advised by other reviewers, added maybe 1/3c milk to the batter and a tsp of vanilla. I made THE BEST streusel topping in my food processor: 1/4c (leftover) candied pecans, 1/4c quick cook oats, 1T whole wheat flour, 1tsp cinnamon, 4T cold butter all pulsed until crumbly. I sprinkled this on top before baking a little over 20 minutes. I got 30 regular size muffins and used 5 good-sized pretty soft peaches. Thanks, will definitely make again!

These muffins came out good and got rave reviews when I took them to work.  I used canned peaches instead of fresh but all worked out in the end.  Next time I will used just one cup of oil instead of the cup and a quarter.  I also used one cup of white sugar and one cup of light brown sugar.  Will make again.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly, out of some things, low on others. Here were my revisions: replaced 1 cup of flour with 1/2 cup flax and 1/2 cup wheat bran, used 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup coconut oil for the vegetable oil, and added 1/2 cup of vanilla almond milk. These were the lightest, fluffiest, perfectly sweet and peachy muffins I've had in years. I ate half of them in one shot.

I absolutely love these muffins! I had a bunch of peaches to use up and I love that the recipe has cups of peaches rather than whole ones because it's easier to measure in cups - fruit is different sizes. I used half white sugar and half brown. We put in the fridge overnight and ate cold the next day YUM YUM YUM

It was very good. I'm not into peaches. Closest thing I eat is peach cobbler and even then I'm super picky. However my husband loves them. So, I decided to try something with peaches that isn't too hard or time consuming. I did as a lot of people recommended and added a 1/2 cup of milk. Because the batter was very thick. And also a teaspoon of vanilla. I was very happy with my results. Yum ^_^

Very tasty muffins but I could only give it 4 stars because there was no way I was using 1 1/4c. oil in a recipe! I planned to substitue in 1c. apple sauce for 1c. oil, but someone (DS) had eaten it all without my knowledge, so I substituted 2 mashed very ripe bananas for 1c. oil instead. Turned out very well! Other changes: 1c. white sugar and 1c. brown sugar (adding the white sugar to the peaches at the very start to draw out the moisture), and used 3c. peaches instead of 2 (~ 4 peaches).

Had to make changes, to make it a great muffin. Lowed temp to 375. Added 4-5 very ripe peaches, finely diced peaches. Tossed peaches in 1/2 cup white sugar. Used 2.5 cups brown sugar instead of white. Added 1/2 cup milk to liquids.

Delicious! I reduced the oil & added pureed peaches instead of apple sauce (as per previous reviews). The peach puree added to the peachiness of the muffins! I cut the amount of sugar in half to make them less sweet & used brown sugar instead of white. I also added a cup of craisins (dried cranberries) & sprinkled slivered almonds on the top before cooking. They were a hit:)

Yum! I used 3 ripe peaches chopped, subbed brown sugar for 1 cup of the white, applesauce for half of the oil, and baked it as two loaves of bread. The peach flavor is subtle, but I like the chunks of fruit in the bread. Good way to use up ripe peaches, if you like breakfast breads/muffins! And I had no problem with mine being dry.

A+ recipe! Delish (with some modifications): only use fresh, ripe peaches. I used approx 10 leftover ripe peaches (small to medium sized)- did not peel, no need to because once cooked you cannot tell no difference. Chopped roughly. Only use 3/4 cups of veg oil (1.25 cups is a bit excessive for just muffin consumption). Add 1 tb of nutmeg (or more if you wish for taste). Used only white sugar and worked fine- no difference to brown sugar, unless you want to make some sort of topping. Cook at 400 degrees for 20-22 mins as per instructions. Note: this will make approx 16-18 large muffins, dependent upon how to distribute them. MUST spray muffin pan with Pam spray or something along those lines- if not, will stick to no avail. Enjoy! This recipe is amazing- fresh fruit taste with a hint of sweetness and nutmeg/cinnamon. Ate two immediately out of the oven and rest will probably be gone by tomorrow by family! :-)

These were good - moist but crispy on top.  I added a 1/2C of milk and 3cups of peaches. Sprinkled tops with cinnamon sugar.  Made 24 muffins.  Cooked them for 18-20 min.

Delicious! I have made these several times and every time they were spectacular!

I used 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour, reduced the sugar to 1.25 c., used 3/4 c. applesauce and 1/2 c. oil.  I increased the peaches to 2 1/2 c. and added 1/2 c. of blueberries.  I have used apricots instead of peaches as well. They end up so moist and sweet every time.

I made some modifications to this, as I felt there was too much sugar and oil and not enough liquid. Boy am I glad I did! I put 1.5 cups of sugar and they were certainly sweet enough (I might even cut out more sugar next time). I also dropped to 1 cup of oil and added 1/2 cup of skim milk to make the batter more runny. It turned out very well! I'd make them again!

A 5 stars for peach-y muffins! I used 5 very RIPE peaches. I blanched them in boiling water for 1 minute to get the skin off of the peaches. As I was chopping them up all the juices were coming out so I added as much as I could to the batter. I had about 2 1/2 cups of chopped peaches. I also used 1 1/4 cup of applesauce in place of the veg oil. This was the only adjustment I made to the recipe. The batter will be thick but when you add the chopped peaches along with its juices it will make for a nice consistency. The baking time was approximate. The were lovely pieces of peaches all over the muffins including the rounded muffin top - very pretty. The muffins were moist, light and refreshing. I smelled and tasted nothing but peaches. nice! Using only fresh ripe peaches with its juices made for a wonderful treat. I actually yielded 36 servings using regular cupcake muffin tins. I didn't have a texas size muffin baking pan. My only small criticism would be that it was kind of hard to get the paper liner off around the muffin. Other than that everything was fine.  Next time I may bake loaves 2 instead. Thank you FBGMOMOF4 for sharing this wonderful muffin.

These are just so good. My family loves them. I add a bit of milk to make the batter more moist. I cut the recipe in half and it makes 12 regular size and 12 mini muffins! More than enough. :)

LOVE LOVE LOVED this recipe, I used 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar, and a bit of vanilla,  the batter was very thick, but the peaches were extra ripe so that added more juice.  This would be wonderful as a bread too, great recipe!

Excellent recipe. I ended up getting 22 muffins and used four peaches. I think I may add another peach or two next time to increase the flavor. My husband is not a huge muffin fan, but he really enjoyed these. Thanks for the recipe!

These muffins are a hit!  I did like others and used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  I also used 1 cup applesauce and only 1/4 cup veg oil and added a bit of milk.  Absolutely amazing!

This was a good muffin recipe although I did make a few minor changes.  I added 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar instead of 2 cups of white.  I also added in 1/2 cup of milk.  And because we like a crackle top I sprinkled the top with a mixture of sugar & cinnamon

Great! My whole family loved these, even the slightly picky husband! I made a few changes: I used unbleached organic all purpose flour, 1/2 cup honey and 1/2 cup organic sugar in place of the 2 cups sugar, a little extra salt (since a couple of reviews said they were bland), and melted organic unsalted butter in place of the oil (as we don't eat refined oils). I used fresh, ripe peaches from the farmers market.  Very good, will definitely make again and again!

We used half the oil (3/4 C) and instead of 2 c white sugar, we used 1 c brown sugar and 1 c white sugar.  We used really really ripe peaches.  They came out excellent.  The batter is really moist after you add the peaches.  I feel like we could have dropped the oil down further.   I definitely would have tried the 1/4c oil + applesauce method, but I didn't have any applesauce on hand.  25min was a little long I think.. but that could easily have just been my oven.

This was really yummy.  Like others, I added milk, but I am not sure it is really necessary.  I made 18 medium muffins and one small loaf with this recipe.  Great for both bread and muffins.

These baked very quickly!  I made mini muffins and I really had to watch them...minutes mattered.  Great texture and flavor.  I omitted the cinnamon for a mixture of vanilla/almond flavor and they are amazing!  Came together easily and popped right out of the greased muffin tins.  Kids loved these!

IThe first half-batch of theses muffins I bakedfor 22 minutes at 400 and they all burned.  I baked the 2nd half at 350 for 22 minutes and they were perfect.  Still, they were really missing flavor.  That is even after adding 1/2 cup of peach juice.  For me, these were a big dissappointment.

These are wonderful, a moist spice muffin with juicy peach bits.  I did change one thing, instead of 1 1/4 cup oil, I used 1 cup applesauce and 3/4 cup oil.  This batch also made 30 muffins!  But the more the merrier when they are this yummy.  This recipe is a keeper!

I tweaked this recipe quite a bit but gave it five stars because it is a really good base. Plus my muffins were delicious. I finally had  perfect rise and top. I did 2 cups whole wheat and didn't have enough peaches so I added apples. Still only had a cup of fruit (my daughter wanted piece of the apple). I only used 1 1/4 cup of sugar and added molasses.  Great recipe! These were perfect but I'll still try it with more fruit next time.

Too much sugar and too much oil for a breakfast muffin. Next time I will use a recipe that has milk as an ingredient and also has more of a cake like texture, this was too course.

Very good muffins.  Tastes a little like Amish Friendship bread with peach chunks(next time I'm adding cinn/sugar to the tops before I bake them).  Lovely!  If you are looking for an extreme peach taste in a muffin this isn't the recipe for you, but I thought it was delish!

These were awesome!  They puffed up like they were supposed to and were delicious.  I sent some home with my mother and brother when they came to visit and they raved about them.  This is an excellent basic recipe that I will use again and again.  Thanks for posting.

These were a good way to use up overripe peaches, they tasted good but still not as peachy as I was looking for.  I added 4 chopped peaches, 1/2 c of milk (per other user suggestions) and next time I would add some peach extract to give it a little kick.  I also cooked these at 350 for 20 minutes, and made these into mini loaves as well.

These were AWESOME! I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups white flour, and instead of 2 cups white sugar I substituted 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup of NuNaturals MoreFiber Stevia Baking Powder.  I also added about 1/4 cup of milk, an extra 1/4 cup of peaches, and a dash of nutmeg to the recipe like previous reviewers.  These modifications made the recipe healthier and my muffins came out incredible, not too sweet with perfect texture and full of flavor!

I read the other reviews and modified this as follows for a wonderful, moist muffin (18): used 1/3 whole wheat flour (3/4 C + 2T = 1 C white--though an entire cup would not have hurt the results), 1/2 T cinn., 1/2 tsp corriander, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 C oil, >1/2 C pureed peaches + 1/2 tsp orange extract, 1 C Splenda, 1/2 C Spenda brown sugar, 3 C peaches, and 3/4 C walnuts. Cooking time was about 22 minutes. Yum!

I made this recipe into breads, and it was okay.  I actually doubled the recipe to make 4 breads, and because the peaches were so ripe, I cut back to oil to only 2 cups instead of 2-1/2.  The breads cooked fine and were extremely moist.  The only flaw in this recipe is that it wasn't overly flavorful.  With peaches having a mild flavor addition to the recipe, I felt it needed a boost somewhere, possibly in the spice area.  I should have followed some of the other reviewers and added to it.  I will probably use this recipe again, but use the bread slices as a base for an ice cream dessert, or for a fruit shortcake.

Yummy!  Substituted some healthier ingredients (1 cup wheat flour, replaced half the oil with applesauce, and used Splenda baking blend instead of sugar), and it was excellent!

Very good muffin.  Kept recipe as stated except for adding a splash of milk as per other reviewers.  Only draw back, hard to get out of pan.  I didn't use liners and this usually isn't a problem but I would recommend liners for these.

This recipe is really easy and very tastey! I followed it exactly. The mix did seem a bit dry so I took other people's advice and added a bit of milk, maybe a tablespoon or two to get the right consistancy. Thanks for posting!

Very tasty. I think next time I may swap out some of the oil for apple sauce like others have mentioned to cut the calories a bit. My batch came out with 22 muffins, but the cooking time was still perfect.

These were so good.  I made several changes to use up what I had on hand and make these a slightly healthier.   I added 1 c. mango/peach flavored applesauce (mainly because my son refuses to eat flavored applesauce :) and a 1/4 c. oil to replace the 1 1/4 c. of oil.  I thought that was just too much oil.   I also put 3/4 c. brown sugar, 3/4 c. white sugar to replace the 2 c. white sugar.  I added 1 t. vanilla (just because I love vanilla in just about everything).  I also added 1/4 t. nutmeg and 1/2 t. pumpkin pie spice. I only baked them for 20 minutes and might have still overcooked them.  They still turned out great.  Moist and very flavorful.  Thanks for this great, easily adaptable recipe!

Loved it with healthy substitutions:  whole wheat flour (3/4 c plus 2 T whole wheat flour = 1 cup white flour), sugar free applesauce instead of oil, only 1 cup of white sugar. I also prinkled cinnamon sugar on the top before baking. We went peach picking and used the best ever peaches from The Peach Tree in York, SC. Delicious!

They tasted really good, I did add 1/2 cup of milk, and attempted to make a strusell topping which made them cave in a bit and didn't look pretty, but that was my change in the recipe. They tasted great otherwise.

Wonderful recipe! I have made this as a bread twice now, with great results. I increased the peaches and decreased oil and sugar. I also sprinkled wheat germ on the top for added nutrition. This is so simple, uses ready ingredients, and turns out beautifully. I love the reddish color from the peaches too.

These are wonderful!  Moist, tender and flavorful.  This recipe made 24 regular-sized muffins.  I substituted 1 cup of the flour with whole wheat flour.  The batter was very thick, so I ended up adding about 1/4 cup milk.  I made up a double batch of the crumb topping from the highly-rated "Banana Crumb Muffins" from this site and sprinkled on top.  I recommend this recipe, just be prepared for a lot of muffins!

WAY too oily.  I should have gone with my instinct and cut way back on the amount of oil called for, and added yogurt or extra eggs for some of the liquid, but I gave the recipe a try as is, and I regret it. Not that the muffins tasted bad; they didn't, but they were very oily. They tasted like cookies to me, rather than muffins, and didn't have enough peach flavor, but everyone liked them. Next time I will cut back on the cinnamon also, which I think added to the cookie flavor. Oh, and I also had a problem with the recipe making more muffins than it said.  You could cut the recipe in half and still get a dozen decent-sized muffins.

A great muffin recipe to use fresh peaches! I'll make these again! I used whole wheat pastry flour for 1/2 of the flour amount. A recipe that works to "play" with according to your taste and "healthier" versions if desired.

I cut the recipe in half and baked mine in a loaf container, using 3 large peaches that I chopped up, and subbing applesauce for half the required oil. As as result, I'm sure, of using applesauce and not measuring my super juicy peaches, I have juicy pockets around my peach chunks (which are rather large.) But--still delicious. I'll just heat the slices up when I serve them and dollop with whipped cream or ice cream, like a peach pie, but without the mess :) As far as flavor goes, it tastes like apple bread with peaches instead of apples. My peaches weren't nearly flavorful enough. I think I probably won't make peach bread or muffins again--I really prefer the apple version of this sort of thing, so I'll probably find other things to do with peaches!

I left skins (very nutritious) on peaches and blended them with wet ingredients (to limit chunks of fruit). Cut oil in 1/2 using apple sauce.  Added a handful of dates and nuts.  Easy & good recipe for a novice that allows room to build on it.  Thank you!

These muffins are yummy and great for that "quick on the go" breakfast or handing to the kids as they go out the door for school. I did make a few changes... first change (which I used on advice from another reviewer) instead of the 1 1/4 cups veg oil I used 1 cup cinnamon spiced applesauce and 1/4 cup veg oil, second change instead of the 2 cups sugar I used 2 cups Splenda (I'm diabetic) and third change was that I used 3 cups chopped fresh peaches instead of the 2. I also made 24 muffins instead of the 16 and baked them for 16 minutes. Since I made my muffins a little smaller there aren't as many calories per muffin (trying to watch my calorie intake). There's about 175 calories, 3 grams of fat and 31 grams of carbohydrate per muffin. Definitely a recipe I will make again! Thanks for sharing!

These were quite good. I used 2.5 cups of peaches, and could probably have diced them finer. I used half WW flour, as well as an applesauce/oil/ground flax seed mixture (as I always do for quick breads), and forgot the milk that many suggest. It would have benefited from some moisture, but the flavor was good and got compliments! My muffins were overdone at 23 minutes and mini muffins took 15 minutes. This recipe made 12 muffins, 12 minis, and I had leftover, so filled 2 ceramic ramekins, also.

Made this for brunch today and it was amazing!  And, I'm not a huge fan of cooked fruit!  The only changes that I made to the recipe were: used melted crisco instead of veggie oil because I was out, added 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1/2 cup of milk and 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.  I also added an extra cup of peaches because we has some that were about to go bad.  Mine were perfectly done at 20 minutes.

oh, yum!  I made these with nectarines that were going to go bad if I didn't use them quick.  I followed the recipe and used the exact ingredients.  I ended up essentially turning my nectarines into a puree, as I don't like large chunks of fruit in my muffins.  These were so good.  I used 2.5 cups of nectarines as that's what I ended up with, and they came out so moist.  Everyone in the house liked them, which makes this an automatic keeper in my book!  I will definitely be making these again.

i loved these! especially great right out of the oven. the color was amazing too. i added some brown sugar on top before baking and it gave the muffins a crisp top. the only thing i did not like was how fast they started molding, maybe my over-ripe peaches were to blame. but jeez, i put them in the fridge and the next day there were mold spots.

We were desperate to use of some of the 113 pounds of peaches we picked when we saw this recipe.  We call it "magic muffins' now.  This is simply the BEST muffin recipe I've ever used. SO good!

Very good! I replaced 1/2 cup of the oil with applesauce and used about 2 1/2 cups of peaches. They smell and taste great!

Well, I was looking at peach pound cake the same time I was looking at these muffins and I used 1/2 cup oil, 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 cup sour cream.  Used 3/4 c. white and 3/4 c. brown sugar (plenty sweet).  Also, added 1 t. vanilla extract and 1 t. Almond extract and only 1/2 t. salt.  Also increased to 3 cups of peaches.  Guess mixing and adding to this recipe wasn't a bad deal!  These are great and very moist.  Made muffins first and then 2 loafs next time.  I also mashed some of the peaches and made a 'glace' using that and some powdered sugar.  This one is a Keeper......thx

Like others suggested, I added 1/2 c. milk and 1 c. chopped peaches.  I also halved the sugar (I don't like things too sweet!) and replaced a bit of the cinnamon with nutmeg instead.  Also, the muffins were perfectly done after 20 min. at 400F. The result was delicious, but next time I will definitely add some nuts, like pecans or walnuts.

These were very good.  I added 1/2 c. milk (they were still really thick) and another cup of peaches.  I also sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top before baking.  Thanks!

I added 1/2 milk and sugar only 1 1/2 cup, and needed to bake about 25-30 min. Great recipe!!! Become soft and very taste! I make muffins for first time and it was very very easy.

Partially because I am a compulsive tweaker (I really can't follow a recipe for the life of me!) and partially out of necessity, I've made the following changes: Instead of 2 cups of white sugar, I put one white and 3/4 c brown sugar, and I only used 3/4 c of oil and one individual Mott's Peach Medley Fruit Sensation. I also added 1/2 c of sour milk, and when the muffins were cooling, I butter the tops and sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar as another reviewer had done. They are AWESOME. But not a healthy breakfast type of muffin... delicious all the same.

It tasted great, but this should be called peach or cinnamon cake. It was really good, I got lots of compliments but I will probably bake this a cake the next time I make it. I had to give it four stars because this is CAKE not a muffin.

I wasn't so impressed with these muffins the first day but on the second day, my husband and I just couldn't get enough of them. I made them with mashed peaches but I think next time I will mash 1/2 to 2/3 of the peaches and then throw in the rest chopped so you can get some nice peach chunks in each muffin. They're great for breakfast muffins or just as a snack. Definitely will be making these again.

So tasty! I took them to a brunch, so I brushed butter on top and sprinkled with cinnamon-sugar.

eta: I have made this several times now with different fruits. Hubby's favorite is half cherries and half peaches. In fact, today is my hubby's birthday and he requested these muffins instead of cake!!

These muffins are very good.  I used canned peaches mainly because I was tired of looking at the huge can in my pantry :-)  I added some milk as suggested by others since the batter was so thick.  These are very moist and tasty.  I will have to try them with fresh peaches next time.  My husband loves these.  Thanks for the recipe!

Love these muffins. I followed the recipe with just a small change. I used 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce & 1/4 cup of canola oil in place of the 1 1/4 cup of oil. Used fresh canned peaches as that is what I had and chopped them in small pieces. Baked as the recipe called and turned out perfect so much so I made a second batch and being diabetic I did the same but used 1 cup Splenda & 1 cup sugar (unrefined organic sugar) and they were perfect also. Will make again trying with chopped apples. thanks for this recipe so much can be substituted in place of peaches.

These are awesome!  I live at high altitude, so I reduced the soda to 1/2 tsp and added 1/4 tsp baking powder.  Having read other reviews, I reduced the oil to 1/2 C and added 1 C apple sauce.  I also used an extra peach.  The crumb is divine.  Thanks so much for a keeper!

We liked this alot!  I also added 1\2 of a cup of milk so that it would be a batter. I made it for an owner of a bed and breakfast. I'm anxious to hear how her clients liked it. I will be making it again.

I added candied ginger and subbed some apple sauce for oil to make these great muffins. They only baked 20 mins and were done. Also it made more like 19 not 16 which was a bonus. Great way to use fresh peaches up. Thanks for the recipe!

This makes a delicious muffin Lots of peach chunks to bite into.  Nice balance of peaches to cinnamon. At first I thought it was missing a topping, but they were yummy without it. A simple recipe anyone can make. I'm making my second batch today.

Good muffins, I followed recipe pretty much exactly except used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 all purpose flour;  did not add milk or any other liquid as others did; batter seemed kind of weird and sticky, I was worried the muffins would be tough but they were fine, I actually got 18 regular size muffins and only baked for 20 minutes at 400 but that could be my oven or the fact that the fresh peaches I used were not overly ripe; oh I also did not peel the peaches, just washed under running water to remove the fuzz! I used 3 large peaches all together.

Great recipe!  I bought a box of peaches and needed to use them before they spoiled. These muffins were wonderful. To make them a little healthier I followed a reviewers advice and replaced the oil with applesauce, and used brown sugar instead of white.  I also substituted white whole wheat flour.

I made these with 50% white whole wheat flour, 3 cups of fresh diced peaches (from the farmstand) subbed out almost 1 cup of oil with applesauce, subbed all of the sugar with 1 cup of brown sugar, added 1/2 cup of milk, added sanding sugar on top of the muffins and added 1/2 T nutmeg. If I made these again, I would decrease the nutmeg, increase the amount of sugar slightly reduce the amount of whole wheat flour, sub out less of the vegetable oil and take the skin off of the peaches.  The healthy substitutions made the muffins more dense, dry and not sweet enough.

Didn’t have muffin liners, so opted to make 2 loaves. Added chopped pecans. Reduced white sugar to 1 cup, added 1/3 cup packed brown sugar. Baked 2 loaves, 350 degree oven, 45-50 minutes. Really good. Will freeze one loaf for later. Great recipe, minor modifications.

Delicious ! Used less peaches 2 1/4 c. Added 1/4 of milk. Worked best in standard muffin pan for 25 minutes . The muffin top pan I used needed less time @ 20.

Pence Orchards peaches are in season in Washington, so after I gathered up about 10# of peaches (most to freeze, but some for eating NOW), I decided on muffins.  Very good, I did add  vanilla (good addition) and replaced 1/2 cup white sugar with  brown sugar.  Next time -  because the peaches are sooo good, I will use less sugar & try without the brown sugar.

Added a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg- loved the added spice alongside the cinnamon! I suggest cutting up your peaches pretty small- bigger chunks were kind of strange. My family drizzled homeade peach syrup over the top and it was AMAZING!

I had way too many ripe peaches so decided to look for a peach muffin recipe & came across this one. I changed it up a bit. I made them gluten free & instead of vegetable oil I used olive oil & melted butter. These were by far the best muffins I have ever made & my friends & family agreed! These muffins are just as good the next day which is rare for a muffin. This is my new go to muffin recipe. I intend to use it all the time & just change up the fruit to whatever is in season.

Made these muffins the first time today and followed recipe as stated, but, added 1/4 cup milk and 3/4 cup chopped walnuts.  Will definitely make this recipe again. Made 33 muffins , bake at 400 for 18-19 minutes.

I followed the brown sugar suggestion and substituted 1 cup of brown sugar. I split the mix between 1 loaf pan and 12 muffins, the muffins came out a bit heavy but the loaf is fantastic.

This is a great recipe. I'm taking away one star for the huge amount of sugar! I used half the sugar - 1 cup -  and it was delicious. I also reduced the oil to 1 cup and added 1/2 cup if apple sauce to replace the moisture. I love the taste of vanilla so I added a splash. This would also be excellent with apples instead of peaches.

I read a TON of reviews. Used many of the suggestions, but am disappointed that I didn’t follow my gut when it came to baking temp and duration. 25 minutes at 400° was way too long. I took them out after 20 minutes and the bottoms were burnt. Next time I will bake at 325°.  I had to cut off the bottoms of the majority of the muffins.

Made this with fresh ripe white peaches. Like many who commented here, I used three peaches instead of two. I also substituted 1 cup of the oil with 1 cup of applesauce, and used oil for the remaining 1/4 cup. I used 1 cup of packed brown sugar in place of the 2 cups of sugar. Lastly, I added a brown sugar crumble on the top of the muffins before baking. (Brown sugar crumble: 2tbs flour, 1/8tsp cinnamon, 1/3cup brown sugar, and 2tbs butter cut in. Mix to a crumble and sprinkle on muffins).  These were phenomenal! They did stick to the muffin liners, which I’m thinking may have been because I substituted the oil. I’ll try to spray the muffin tins and cook directly next time to see if that helps.

Very tasty. Halved the recipe and substituted 1 cup AP flour with 1 cup wheat flour and it worked great. I also used very soft peaches with skin on, which I was worried about, but it was fine. I will add an oatmeal/brown sugar topping next go around for texture and a touch more sweetness. A "Keeper".

These were delicious! I cut the recipe in half and it still made 15 muffins.

Here is what I changedto make healthier: I did 1/4c applesauce and 1/4c olive oil instead of the vegetable oil. I used 2 eggs so I wouldn't waste half an egg. I also reduced sugar to half a cup and used coconut sugar in place of white. Pleasantly surprised with how tasty and moist these were! Definitely a keeper!

These are such great muffins. My family LOVES them. 
I did make some changes to make them Gluten Free.
I substituted the flour for GF Flour ( cup for cup) and the oil for Coconut oil semi melted.

great recipe.
Made 16
All directions mostly followed except
I omitted cinnamon, added 2 tsp vanilla   1 tsp baking powder plus 1/2 cup buttermilk.
Mine baked  25 minutes at 400F.
Moist and yummy.
A great recipe for other fruits such as berries, apples, pears, plums etc.

Very moist & delicious. I used three cups of peaches, as other cooks recommended, & one tablespoon of cinnamon. It made eight huge muffins. 
The 2nd time I made them, I froze the batter individually in paper muffin cups & baked a few at a time (unthaw for about an hour first). They’re also wonderful using 1.5 cups of apple with 1.5 cups of peaches together.  Sprinkle sugar & cinnamon on top with a few pieces of peaches or apples on top to make them extra  beautiful.

This recipe is great and you can certainly use canned peaches if that’s all you have. I used canned peaches added about a 1/3 cup of brown sugar and 1 tsp of nutmeg and cloves and allspice. Made it very “fall-y” :)

I made it in 2 loaf pans as suggested as I didn't have enough muffin tins.  I didn't have enough fresh peaches, so I added some drained canned peaches to make up the difference.  I also added about 1/4 cup of milk to the batter.

I made this as directed and followed the instructions of others in the reviews. The added lemon juice was just the thing to give added dimension but I think cranberries would be even better. I’ll be including those next time. :)

This was my teenagers fave this year! Fresh peaches from the orchard make all the difference. So easy and delicious for back to school. I tripled it and froze them??

Added cinnamon, nutmeg and a pack of instant mudding to dry ingredient. Did 1 stick of butter, 1 cup of oil and 1 cup peach juice from can plus vanilla extract. Glazed with Apricot Jam! 


Outstanding muffins! We gobbled them up and used some of the batter for a cobbler cheesecake.
  
 Great base recipe to try different fruits also!

These are dangerous.  :)  I listened to the suggestions about using half brown and half white sugar.  I also used the peach juice from chopping and added that to the oil/egg mixture.  Extras I used were a dash of vanilla and a dash of nutmeg.  They are soo good!  It doesn't hurt that I used fresh Michigan peaches that we picked the other day.

Really good, easy to make. I used minnie loaf pans. Set oven temp to 350, and cooked about 25 minutes, or until the toothpick came out clear.  I have a gas stove and  my altitude is 5000 feet.  I have a peach tree and used some that were ripening on the counter. Love this recipe, made them again

I live in the South and summer is a great time for peaches. I love getting some yummy, juicy peaches from a farm stand and making these muffins or breads. I added some ginger and nutmeg to give the muffins more of a cobbler taste. I also use half brown sugar and half white sugar, which adds a nice caramelization.

I subbed 1 of the cups of regular flour with 1 cup of coconut flour and 1 of the cups of sugar with 1 cup of splenda. I also added 1/2 a cup of milk and emulsified 2 additional peaches and added them to the batter. These additions yielded 24 sweet and moist cupcakes with half the calories, and only 11 net carbs.

I used 1c. applesauce plus 1/4c. oil and used half white/half brown sugar.  Added chopped pecans.  Mashed half the peaches along with the slices.  I would cut down on the cinnamon,  but otherwise these muffins were good, not great, but good.

It’s awesome to come back and see what others think of your recipe and their changes. In the original recipe, I did use peaches that were extremely ripe, hence my hurry to use them.  They definitely had plenty of juice to add to the batter. ?? I posted this recipe before I even thought about “healthy”, now I’m quite a bit more aware...older! I use applesauce for oil and often use maple syrup/agave/brown sugar for sugar. Sometimes I just use my ninja and pulse the peaches to get them distributed throughout...and I ALWAYS add pecans to them if my boys aren’t eating them (crazy kids don’t like nuts!) I also use this recipe with strawberries and blackberries that are extremely ripe.  It’s just the last step for my fresh fruit before it’s too far gone for anything. The best thing about baking is, contrary to what most think, if you have a general knowledge of baking, you can pretty much wing it.  Most things I do now are not measured and are using up things I have on hand...most turn out great (some, thank goodness only few, fail)

LOVE these muffins.  I had peaches in my freezer for awhile (1-2 years when I bought a case) and wanted to use them up. These are AMAZING!  My only adjustments were a little less baking soda (since I'm in the Denver area at 5,200 ft in altitude), and I added 3 cups of peaches (again for extra moisture for the altitude). I had one last night warm from the oven which was delicious, but even this morning at room temperature, they are moist and yummy.  I will definitely be making these again.

This was a delicious recipe to use freshly picked peaches. I did use 1 1/2 C whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 C all purpose flour instead of 3 C all purpose flour. I also used 1 C brown sugar and 1 C white sugar instead of 2 C white sugar based on other reviews. I did substitute some of the oil with applesauce and added 1/2 C of dried cranberries to the mix. The muffins were very tasty and moist. I was able to make two dozen regular muffins and two dozen mini muffins from the batter. I cooked the mini muffins for 12 minutes.

Only change  was to add a 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon to batter.  Used ripe, fresh peaches but these had very little flavor.  Middle of the muffins were a bit doughy; might should have cooked a little longer. Doubt I will make these again.

I had fresh local peaches and was looking for a muffin recipe. This sounded delicious!  1 cup of fresh peaches mixed with 1 cup frozen fresh blueberries made a nice flavor combination. I also substituted 1 of the 3 cups white flour for 1 cup almond flour.  The mixture gave the muffins a little more rustic texture and was delicious. My muffin pans must be a bit smaller so, I made 24 and I cooked them approx 5 minutes less than the directions. They turned out perfect!

Absolutely delicious.   I made 18 small muffins and 1 loaf of bread.  The bread I  baked along with the muffins until they came out, and then I turned the oven down to 350 and baked another 20 minutes or so.  Turned out great.   I used 3 cups of peaches and added a splash of vanilla.

Really delicious! All I had was frozen peaches. They were good and chopping them before totally thawing made them easier to handle. Added a pinch of nutmeg, subbed half the white sugar for brown, added a tsp of vanilla and subbed about 3/4 cup of oil out for applesauce. Made mini muffins, rose beautifully, tasted great! Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved these. I didn't have fresh peaches, used 2 (14 oz) cans peaches instead. Also added 1/2 C. buttermilk and swapped 1/2 c applesauce for part of the oil. Used 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar. I added a generous amount of sliced almonds  &  cinnamon, nutmeg & sugar on top before baking. Was careful not to over mix, it made 12 muffins and  one 8x4 loaf. So very yummy!

Loved these muffins.  I had peaches that were about to go bad, and searched "peach muffins" on a whim.  They turned out deliciously!  I took them to work, and everyone loved them.  You can definitely taste the cinnamon, and I've thought about remaking them using apples for a yummy fall muffin.

I substituted 3/4 c of the oil with greek yogurt, 1 cup brown sugar for the white sugar, and I used canned peaches, and my family loved these. Thanks for the recipe!

These were a hit with my 14yo son & coworkers! I try to make new recipes without any changes....but I had to do a couple. I went half and half on the sugar--white and light brown. I went half and half on the spice--cinnamon and nutmeg!

My only other recommendation is to chop the peaches small. Mine (I used canned, by the way) weren't chopped very well and so there were big chunks of delicious peaches here and there versus mini-bites everywhere!

This recipe made 15 cupcakes, the leftover batter I poured in a loaf pan where it made a very short loaf.

This turned out nice and sweet, and I cut the sugar in half! I used canned peaches, drained and patted dry, and had about 2&1/2 c. of peaches total. Everyone I served them to ended up taking some home, too!  Definitely a keeper.

The batter as given is very thick. I thinned the batter by adding the reserved peach juice. The night before I made the muffins, I prepped the peaches by blanching, peeling, and slicing off the pit and letting them sit in a strainer over a bowl in the fridge. I also cut back 1/2 cup of sugar since the peach juice added sweetness.

Wow, way too oily for me. There is a distinct oil taste and the bottom of the muffin cups are swimming in oil. If I make again I would lower the amount of oil and substitute for some applesauce.

This is a cinnamon muffin more than anything else. You could probably substitute any kind of fruit and it would taste the same. I used 3 cups of peaches but more wouldn't have hurt. As other reviewers suggested I did have to add some milk to get it to the right consistency. Overall I would make these again, and add more fruit.

I would make this again. Using other  reviews, I added vanilla (1+tsp) and I used 1 1/4 C  applesauce and 1/4 C. oil in place of the 1 1/4 C oil.  I initially used just  1 C applesauce, but the batter seemed to thick and I was worried it would turn out dry, so I added the extra applesauce. I think 2 cups of sugar is a bit much, but the kids liked it.  My daughter even suggested I replace the peaches with apples next time.

Thee were okay, but they bottoms burnt. I could definitely see switching white sugar for brown to bring out the peach flavour, as it was less than flavourable. May try it again with some changes or just look for a new peach recipe

These muffins are delicious. I only had enough peaches for half a batch, so I cut the recipe in half. I simply cut all the measurements in half except I used 1 tsp cinnamon,
1/2 + 1/8 cup oil (I used applesauce for part of this: I emptied one of my kids' cinnamon applesauce pouches into the measuring cup and then filled it the rest of the way with canola oil), and 1 egg + 1 flaxseed "egg substitute" (soak 1 tbsp ground flaxseed in 2 tbsp water for 5min). Next time I would probably try adding milk like other reviewers have done, to thin out the batter a little bit. But these were yummy regardless. They didn't last long, we gobbled them up.

These were really tasty. I was worried when putting the batter into muffin tins as it was rather thick, it resembled more biscuit batter than muffin, but I didn't need to worry as the muffins turned out fluffy and nice. I was out of cinnamon so used vanilla instead, but the cinnamon would have been lovely. This will be my go to peach muffin recipe now.

I also did some substations, I added 1 cup baby food i think it was mixed fruit and 1/4 cup oil. I also used 3 cups peaches and 1 cup brown sugar instead of the 2 cups white that it asks for.

I made these last year. We liked them but my kids didn't care for the chunks of peaches.

This time I made the following changes - used 1 cup of packed brown sugar in place of 2 cups white sugar; used 1/2 cup of oil and 3/4 cups homemade low sugar applesauce; I cut 2 cups of peaches (with skin on) and pureed in my food processor and peeled and diced one peach so there were small pieces of peach in each muffin; I cut back on the cinnamon (used one heaping teaspoon) and added 1 tsp baking powder.
I have littles so I made mini muffins. This recipe produced 3 dozen mini muffins and one loaf of bread. 
Yum!

I also upped the peaches to 3 cups, subbed in applesauce for the oil and modified the sugar content.  I used 1 cup brown rice syrup and 1/2 cup white sugar.  Very nice.  It was a little loose so I added some quick oats for texture and they turned out beautifully.

Turned out great. I substituted half of the oil with unsweetened apple sauce and half of the sugar with brown sugar. Also, since peaches are not in season, I used canned peaches in peach juice which I drained and chopped. I think the extra moisture from the canned peaches helped with the moisture problem that some of the other reviews mentioned. I baked it as two loaves and they came out really nice.

I was short on time, so baked it in a 9 inch circular cake tray. came up beautifully, took me 30 minutes at 200 C. The only substitution I made was using canned instead of fresh peaches, but I'm very happy with the cake... will definitely make again.

Delicious! Obviously, like everyone else here I have tweaked it a little, due to the assortment of available ingredients at home, and simply, my urge to add something a little extra. Instead of veg. oil I have used half margarine and half grapeseed oil. Instead of white sugar I used brown. Here is what I added that made these muffins simply amazing: a tbsp of each - pumpkin seeds, dried cranberry and hemp seeds. Tablespoon of vanilla extract really made a huge difference.  This recipe calls for 400 degree oven temperature, which I personally wouldn't recommend to everyone, due to the fact that all ovens are different. If I baked at 400 in my oven, my muffins would come out burnt on the outside and wet on the inside (speaking from experience). So my oven did really well with 355 and I baked muffins for 30 min. They came out perfect! Will do it again!

I followed the loaf timing and these were just perfect!  After reading a handful of reviews, I decided to substitute the 2 cups white sugar with one cup brown; substituted half the oil with applesauce; added a handful of dried cranberries. Great for using leftover peaches(I had some frozen from this past fall).

These were wonderful!  I did make some changes but my 5 star would still be there without them.  Did 2 tsp. cinnamon as some recommended along with 1 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil.  Only other change was to add some blueberries for a peach melba taste.  They were great!  Co-workers gobbled them up.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Really worked well.  We don't get fresh peaches so I used canned. Substituted 1 cup Demerara Sugar for the two white, reduced the oil to 1 cup and subsituted a bit of the syrup to the required moisture. Everyone loved the results. Thank you.

The batter was like glue, and once baked they were dry and tasteless.  Even after I added extra peaches and some raisins.

Delicious! I cut the oil to 1 cup and used close to 3 cups peaches (which was about 6 peaches, roughly chopped then mashed coarsely). Ended up with 18 muffins and a small cake.

What a delicious way to use up those "less than perfect" peaches - you know, those mealy or not very sweet or juicy ones! Once they're ripe (but still not great for eating fresh), they're perfect for this recipe. I've only made it once, exactly as written. I loved the crunchy top and moist texture. I'll try reducing the amount of oil next time (just so I won't feel so guilty eating a second slice).

Took these to a girls breakfast and loved them. I made them  with the smaller muffin pan. I did use fresh peaches (3 cups), used 1 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. This helped with the moisture in the batter.   I used 1 cup brown surgar instead of 2 white. Also added a small cube of caramel in the middle which was perfect.

I substituted 1 cup of flour with whole wheat. 3 eggs for 1 cup Apple sauce and half a cup of oil for 1 /2 cup more of Apple sauce. Brought this to a dinner with friends and the kids ate them all within minutes.  I also only used 1 cup of unpacked brown sugar instead of two cups white sugar.

Added walnuts because I love them. And I had nectarines that were very ripe and I needed to use them. These muffins are fantastic. Made the basic recipe as written. So good. Will make these again.

Just didn't work at high altitude. The batter was stiff so I didn't add the extra flour I would usually add. Coarse crumb and fell miserably. I think this would need too many adjustments to make it work at this altitude (6800 ft)

My favorite recipe for peach muffins so far! I followed recipe exactly except for adding an extra cup of fresh peaches. I shared some of the muffins with friends and family and for that they gave me their peaches to make some for them. LOL. I ended up making lots of muffins and a couple of loaves (we did prefer the muffins) and shared the recipe. Thanks for posting.

These are FANTASTIC!!!!  I do have celiac's and cannot use regular wheat flour.  I used the Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 Flour, applesauce instead of oil and 1 cup of brown sugar- no white and like others I added vanilla, probably 2 tsp.  Thank-you for posting this.

I added about 1/4milk, 1.5 purée banana and instead of white sugar, added 2/3 cup Splenda. I also added topping of cinnamon, unsweetened coconut flakes and some oats. Only baked for 15 min. In my oven. Absolutely love these muffins and will def. make again.

These were great! I altered just two things: 2 cups whole wheat + 1 cup white flour, and reduced the sugar by about 1/3 cup. It was still very sweet and could be reduced a bit more if desired. The batter seemed really weird while I was stirring (felt like my arm would fall off it was so stiff) but they really turned out excellent!

I made a few adjustments
-Instead of 2 cups white sugar used 1 cup of brown -3 cups of fresh peaches and I mashed slightly in my second batch- added 1/3 a cup of milk- instead of all oil, used 1cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup of oil.  I also cooked the second batch for only 17 mins as the 20 mins at 400 was too long

The first time I made them I burned them.  The second time I cooked them @ 375 and kept a close eye on them.  I used fresh local peaches from the Texas Hill Country.  I also halved the recipe and added 1/4 cup of milk.  1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar.

Yum!  I did the 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce. And I lessened the sugar to 1.5 cups. Only because I like something not too sweet and then I have the option to warm it up and out some honey butter or jelly on it :)

These are wonderful.  I changed to portion size to 11 muffins (only had 2 eggs), but the ingredients still resulted in 17 regular size muffins.  For the flour, I used 1 cup bread flour, and the remainder whole wheat.  I also substituted 1 cup apple sauce for the veg.oil.

OMG! I loved this. It wasn't the most appealing looking muffin I have seen, but the taste more than made up for it. I used fresh peaches and used whole wheat flour. I added a cup of fresh blueberries so my kids would eat them. They thought just peaches didn't sound good. LOL Anyway, I didn't alter anything else and LOVED them. I already ate 3 and just took them out of the oven a little while ago!

This recipe is amazing! I cut it in half as well and made the following tweaks: 2 eggs (when cutting in half it wants us to use 1 1/2, I rounded up to 2:)),  used white sugar for 3/4 of the recipe and brown sugar for the final quarter, used whole wheat flour over white and coconut oil for my veggie oil. I went with mini muffins as well so I cut the baking time down to 15 mins. Turned out light, fluffy and delicious!

This was a great recipe! I tried to make it healthier and used all whole wheat flour, and applesauce instead of oil.  They were definitely dense and a little crispy after the 25 minute cooking time. Not the recipe's fault, I just have to adjust to my changes.  My family does not mind a denser muffin, so all I need to do is decrease the cooking time a little. The cinnamon really went well with the peach taste, but I would decrease just slightly, to maybe 1/2 TBS. I LOVE peaches, so I wanted to taste it just a little more. I also used Trivia baking blend instead of sugar, and we really liked the sweetness level. Great recipe that can change to fit personal preference! Oh! And fresh peaches do taste better. I have tried both.

They were simply delicious. Now the substitutions.. Melted butter instead of oil. Added ½ tsp cardamom powder. Reduced cinammon to ½ tsp as well. Added ¼ cup chopped walnuts. Replaced 3 cups of AP with.. 1 cup oat flour and 2 cups AP. Reduced sugar to 1 3/4 cup.  Mix everything in your food processor with the dough blade. Reduced oven temp to 375 degrees and muffins were done in exactly 25 mins. 
Simply moist, porous and so soft. Use foil lined muffin cups and no clean up. Hubby thought they were store brought :)

This was awesome. I will admit i took some of the suggestions below, as well as some of my own. I used 1 cup of brown sugar for 2 cups of white, 1 cup apple sauce and 1/4 cup oil for instead of 1 1/4 cup oil. Also I used whole wheat flour. I added a splash of vanilla and pureed the peaches because I don't like lumps in my muffins, lol. Delicious. Came out perfect at 25 minutes, though made 12 muffins the way I made it. I realize this is not the original recipe made this way, but I feel it is easily adaptable and that to me means those are the best recipes.

I followed this recipe as stated and the problems with it are : the muffins came out with an oily aftertaste, not a strong peach flavor, an oily smell in the house while baking . My kids and I didn't are for these.

I love this cupcake recipe. The cupcakes come out very tasty and moist, the top is chewy which I love. I am going to use this recipe for my future cupcakes. The only downside for me is this is a bit too sweet for me but other than that everything is perfect. Oh, I also add 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract.

Delicious!  I don't usually bake or consider myself a good baker but these turned out so good - the fam was very impressed!  Added a half cup of milk and used 1/2 cup oil and the rest applesauce as some of the other reviews suggested.

Yummy! I was out of eggs so I substituted 3/4 cup of applesauce and they still turned out really good. Also, to intensify flavor, I processed the peaches which also added more moisture. Will make again!

These were delicious! Being health conscious, I made a few swaps:

Flour: 1.5 cups of white whole wheat and 1.5 cups white all purpose
Sugar: 1 cup white sugar, .5 cup brown sugar, .5 cup truvia sweetener 
Oil: 1 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1/4 cup vegetable oil 

Great way to use up some peaches. I also threw some blueberries into part of the batch. mmmm! 

Overall, very good, not too sweet and moist even without all the oil! 

I yielded 20 regular-size muffins

I made these last week! I cut the recipe in half and got 12 muffins.  I used can peaches.  After reading the reviews I decided to take the juice from the canned peaches and simmer it on the stove in a sauce pan until it reduced to about 1/4 cup and added it as my additional liquid.  I also added a crumb topping I got from another peach muffin recipe on here. Great recipe and a big hit.

Yummy!  The only things I did differently was - because I don't like putting so much oil in my baking, I substituted a cup of the oil with 1 cup of plain yogurt. (I still put 1/4 cup of oil in only because I ran out of yogurt).  I added a tiny bit of vanilla and I put 1 cup sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  I also threw in 1 teaspoon of baking powder too. My peaches were fresh and quite ripe.  My gas oven cooked them to perfection at 23 minutes.  VERY good recipe and I will definitely be using it again!  Thank you!

DON'T CHANGE A THING! These won second place at a church muffin bake-off in a field of skilled veterans (I'm only 30!). They were only passed by chocolate walnut, and you really can't top that! I used fresh, very ripe, Colorado peaches. Wowza! 

I've tried the recipe as stated and also with some applesauce for part of the oil. They're still good with the substitution, but the wow factor drops because they're not as moist.

Side note: if using dark nonstick tins, you may get burned muffins unless you adjust time and/or temperature.

I tried this recipe this morning but I wasn't read the comments so I didnt add milk. It was a mistake because after the 15 minutes bottom of my cakes a little burned so I turned off the bottom of the pan and I continued to cook. The result is satisfying they're really delicious. This is one of the most delicious cakes you can do with the peaches

I used 1 cup white flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup old fashioned oats instead of white flour.  I substituted the oil with vanilla Greek yogurt and 1cup agave instead of sugar.  3 cups of peaches were perfect!  I also added a streusel topping.  Very good!!!

Great recipe!  I increased the peaches to 2.5 cups and substituted one cup of oil for one cup of applesauce (I still used 1/4 cup of oil with it).  I also added a crumb topping which added a nice texture and sweetness.  I used fresh peaches picked just a few hours earlier.

First of all, they have waaaay to much oil - probably about 3 times as much as necessary. The oily flavor overpowers the peaches, which you can barely taste. Secondly, they stuck to the pan really badly, and ended up coming out in crumbles.

Made these muffins as written except used canned peaches.  They were awesome.  The whole muffin was encased in a crispy, caramelized shell like a muffin top.  Probably because there was so much sugar in the recipe!  So not sure I would eat these on a regular basis.  They're more like a treat.  Also 25 minutes at 400 was too long and burned the edges.  375 for 20 min worked better.

Would like to try the suggestion of using brown sugar instead of white and applesauce for part of the oil.

A great muffin, quick and easy to mix and bake.
I read some of the reviews before making these muffins for the first time.  I prefer brown sugar so as a few readers suggested, I used it instead of white sugar and also used canned peaches, reserving the juice and using the juice in place of oil for a healthier muffin.
They baked up in 25 minutes and were excellent right out of the oven with butter.
This recipe has been added to my favourites and I'll be making it all the time.

These were very enjoyable muffins.  I used a combination of peaches and mulberries, mostly because I ended up being short on peaches and added a tsp of almond extract.

I got excellent reviews.  Changes made 2 cup all-purpose flour and 1 whole wheat white, 3/4 cup each brown and white sugar, 1 cup oil and 1/4 half and half, 1 tsp baking soda, 3 cups peaches. They were delicate and flavorful.  A few  had tops that wanted to come off without the bottoms and had enough for 12 muffins and one 4x8 loaf. Will make again for sure.

These muffins are so delicious! They are beautifully moist and wonderful..........a new favorite for me.  I followed recipe as it was and found no need to use extra liquid.  The next time I make them, I am going to cut back on the sugar and cinnamon a bit.  Thank you for a great recipe!  Oh yes, they did make a lot more than 16 muffins, and I was thrilled with that.

Yummy and easy. Breakfast is often a struggle in our home. These came together easy and turned out fabulous! My kids loved them. We are allergic to eggs so I used 1/2 cup of apple sauce in place of the eggs. Yummy! Thank you

The muffins rose great. Quite dense. I added 1teaspoon vanilla as batter seemed to be tasteless, used fresh peaches. Next time I'll try adding milk also and more cinnamon and use butter instead of oil.

WAY too sweet...I always think muffins should be sweet but not like dessert in the morning and so I would try these again with either half the sugar or maple syrup to make it a bit more healthy..other than that they were super moist .

I had a couple peeled peaches left over from making jam.  I followed the advice of one poster and used 3 cups diced peaches (Ninja blender) and substituted 1 cup of applesauce for part of the oil.  I also used 1 cup of brown sugar instead of 2 cups of regular.  I also used whole wheat flour, as is my habbit.  One batch made a dozen muffins and a loaf of bread.  Definitely shorten the suggested oven time on both.  These made for a tasty and nutritious breakfast.

I made this recipe exactly as written and it was excellent. I took the skin off peaches that were a little too squishy to just eat, let them sit in small bowl overnight and then baked them the next day. Great recipe!

I just found this recipe and it was amazing.  I changed a few things to make them a bit healthy as I am a nanny and try to keep the snacks on the "good and healthy" side.  I subbed 3/4c of vanilla greek yogurt for one cup of oil and only used 1/4c of oil.  I split the flour and used 1 1/2 white flour and 1 1/2 wheat flour.  And just a suggestion to add more peached.  The kids loved them, the mom loved them, my husbanf even loved them and asked me to make some for us.  fabulous great tasting recipe!

This is delicious! The only changes I made were to add 1/2 cup of blueberries and 1/3 cup orange juice (because the batter seemed extremely thick) and I made it in a bundt pan instead of muffin pans (baked for 1 hour). It turned out incredibly moist and tasty! Definitely use fresh peaches if you can :)

These muffins were so good & everyone who tried them thought so as well.  Always a little leary about making a new recipe, but turned out so nice with our local fresh peaches

Nothing special. I reduced the cinnamon, but still these muffins had no peach taste except for the chunks of peach themselves. These were kind of a waste of good fresh peaches. If I was to make these again (which I probably won't) I would try the tip to use applesauce to replace some of the oil, but instead of applesauce, i would use peach puree. Maybe then they would have more peach flavor. Not bad muffins, overall. Just not worth the bother.

I used gluten free flour, substituted one of the cups of sugar with a cup of Splenda, and added 1 tsp vanilla. They were amazing!

Loved this recipe...Instead of all that oil, I used 2 of the small applesauce cups and less than half cup of oil, and about half cup of milk, and sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the second batch I made! I also used just 1 cup of sugar and they were not too sweet, they were perfect!

Good tasting - I used 3 cans of peaches instead of fresh - I rinsed them and chopped them up into small pieces. I also made it using Cloud 9 gluten free flour. Instead of 1 1/4 c oil, I used 2/3 cup fat free vanilla yogurt and 1/2 c coconut oil, melted. They turned out really nice!

These are dense, dry, and way too sweet! I followed the recipe to a T.   I made peach muffins a couple years ago that were amazing, but can't find the recipe for them anywhere. These weren't even close and I won't be making them again.

These muffins are so delicious!!! And super easy! I used a cup of white sugar and a cup of brown sugar instead of 2 cups of white. They needed a lot less cooking time than the recipe said, 15ish minutes instead of 25, I don't know if that might have had something to do with the sugar change perhaps

I didn't have fresh peaches but wanted to try this recipe so I used canned peaches & used a little of the juice to loosed the batter a bit.  I put it in a 9 x 9 pan, sprinkled it with brown sugar & baked it at 350 for about an hour.  It turned out really good!  My daughter has been eating it for breakfast for the past couple of days.  Thanks for the idea!

I did not care for this recipe. Made exactly as written: the middles sink, and it's hard to remove them from the pan. Wayyy too much oil.

I had 4 fresh peaches that needed to be eaten, so I tried this recipe.  It was delicious!  I added about 1/4 cup of skim milk, as recommended by other reviewer, and sprinkled the tops with sugar crystals before popping them in the oven. Came out perfectly and my kids have devoured them! Thanks for the great recipe!

These muffins had so much oil your fingers stayed greasy while eating.  They were too dense and the oil over shadowed the peaches.  Will not make again.

I had lots of fresh peaches to use up so I thought I would try this recipe.  It was great!  so yummy!  My 2 year old and husband liked it.  So moist and just the right amount of cinnamon.  I added a little less sugar than called for since my peaches are really sweet and it turned out great.

The taste is pretty good. But like some people said, the batter was very dry that it was more of a dough than batter even after adding the chopped peaches. I think I added about 3T of milk (didn't measure) to thin the batter. Also, for the oil, I used part oil, part applesauce, and part peach puree (to bring out more peach flavour). Only added 1t of cinnamon and I think 2t would have been tad bit too much for my family. I also added 1t of vanilla. Maybe less flour may do..? Taste-wise it was alright, but needs some more experimenting.

I made the original recipe except for one change made out of necessity:  adding some liquid.  When mixing the batter prior to folding in the peaches, the batter formed a ball - like bread dough.  While adding the peaches helped, the batter was still VERY dense.  I added about 1/4-1/3 C. milk.  Also, baked for 24 mins and muffins came out a bit dry with the four in their own tin being dark on the bottom.  Will reduce baking time to under 20 mins next time.  Also cut down on the sugar as they were very sweet to my tastebuds.

OMG these really are fabulous!  I added almond slivers on top (mainly for looks) and my baking time had to be increased.  My husband does most of the cooking in our household and rarely likes anything I make, but he really enjoyed these as did my sister and brother-in-law.

Awesome! The taste is amazing! I dowed 3 in the whole time I have been writing this review. Opps! did I just admit that? Anyways, I added a 1/3 cup of sunflower seeds because I didn't have quite enough peaches. My family likes nuts and/or seeds added, and put a little wheat bran in the mix for added fiber. Thanks for sharing!

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because I don't think is is exceptionally good for you with all the white flour and sugar.  I will try some of the other suggested changes when I have an opportunity to go shopping first.  I was looking for something quick with the ingredients I had on hand.  

I added 1/2 tablespoon of ground ginger; 1 teaspoon of vanilla and dried cranberries.  I also used jarred/canned peaches (because I had them).  

I made two loafs and they came out great.  I actually wanted to make muffins, but after I got all the ingredients mixed together, I found that I only had six paper muffin lines - so peach loaf it was!  YUM!

I was planning on making a peach pie with some fresh peaches I was given, but didn't end up with quite enough to make the filling.  I cooked them up in this recipe, brought them in to work and everyone raved about them.  I got a few "Best muffins ever!" comments. Awesome.

This recipe is fabulous! I took the advice of others and added 1/2 cup milk, which actually allowed me to get 24 muffins out of this recipe. I was short on white sugar, so I used 1 c white and 1 c brown sugar. These muffins were perfectly sweet! Additionally, I used paper liners and baked for 20 minutes, instead of 25, which was perfect. I will probably use this muffin recipe as a base for various mix-ins... Too often, the muffin is a boring vessel for the mix-in ingredient. This recipe is an extraordinary exception!

I halved the recipe and got 12 perfect muffins. These are DELISH!!  I was going to freeze some to take on a trip next week, but I think I'm going to have to make another batch for that! I followed the recipe exactly except for adding 1/2 cup chopped pecans (remember this was for half the recipe -- I would use 1 cup if making the whole recipe).

I love this recipe. I've been trying it with all sorts of fruit as well--apples in these muffins are absolutely divine, and raspberries (my boyfriend's favorite :D) are delicious. I can just imagine blackberries and blueberries would go over just as nicely. Thanks for this yummy treat!

Delicious!  Like others, I added a little milk to the batter and increased the amount of peaches.  I also cut down the cooking time to 20 minutes and temperature to 375 in my convection oven.

YUM!  Replaced 2 cups white for one white & one brown sugar - also added a crumble topping ( quick oats, softened butter, brown sugar, cinnamon - squish together until crumbly and put on top before baking)  Delish!  Served hot with some vanilla ice cream :)

I gave it a 4 star because of the taste it was moist and I did (like other reviews) added about 1/2 cup milk other than that I followed to the letter.  I did make loafs.  I recommend turning down the temp to about 350 I didn't and they burned around the edges ( I didn't read anywhere to turn down or cut the time for loaves) They were still moist but burned around the edges.  But overall a good tasting recipe just will make changes when I make again

Very yummy and a great way to get through my excess supply of fresh peaches!  I sub'd as follows: 2 cups wholewheat + 1 cup oak flour in place of white flour.  1 cup coconut sugar instead of 2 cups white sugar.  1/4 cup coconut oil + 1 cup applesauce instead of oil and I added 1 tbsp vanilla. I also made 2 loaves instead of muffins and baked for about an hour.

This recipe is excellent.  I made a dozen muffins and then took the rest and put it in a small loaf pan.  I also used some of the suggestions such as adding milk, using 3 cups of peaches, and adding cranberries.  I was very happy with those alterations.  I didn't have any applesauce on hand, but next time (I have more peaches) I intend on trying the applesauce substitution.

These muffins turned out delicious! They are super easy to make. I added more peaches (3 cups) and some milk (about 1/2 cup)and they were SO good! They were nice and moist... and you could add any fruit to this recipe!!

I used mostly fresh peaches but added in some fresh cherries as well and this was one of the best muffins ever. The texture was great and so was the flavor. 
The only change I made was only using half of the oil and the rest was natural unsweetened applesauce.

Made these recently for a pot luck play date and they were a big hit with everyone ages 20 months - 37!  I switched applesauce for oil but that is only because I was out of oil!  Excellent and will make again for sure!

I followed the recipe except using 1/2 cup applesauce and 3/4 cup oil and these were wonderful!  Made 24 muffins for me!  The second time I made them, I subbed some applesauce but also used half brown sugar and half whole wheat flour.  The result was a bit more dense but still really good!

Never made peach muffins before. But now, these will be a staple in my home! I followed the easy recipe to a "T" and used the most ripe/sweeteset peaches. Baked for 15 min and cooled. To add extra decadence, I drissly honey over the top before I devour it. Although, the muffin is excellent all by itself.

Very good and moist.  It also keeps very well, and we are enjoying them 2 days later.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  Next time I will use some peach extract instead of cinnamon.  Great basic recipe though, and they rose very nicely.

Wow, these were way too sweet for us. Even the kids commented on how it was hard to eat a whole one for the sweetness. Aside from that, the recipe worked out alright. I did add half a cup of milk as others did. If I made it again, I'll use either half the sugar, or follow another's suggestion of only 1 cup of brown sugar. I'd also decrease the cinnamon a bit - maybe 1 1/2 tsp. If you're looking for a peach cupcake, this might be just the recipe for you.

Very good.  I made the recipe as written, although I halved it because I only had 1 cup of peaches.  I ended up with 18 muffins, but didn't fill them too full because I though they would rise more - they didn't.  The batter was thick, but my peaches were pretty ripe and juicy.  At 400 degrees, my muffins only took 12 minutes - and even then the bottoms were slightly burned.  Next time, I'll fill the cups fuller and lower the temp to 350.

I made this once, tweaking based on other reviews.  And though it was very good, we still felt that it needed a more peachy flavor and a little something else.  I just finished making them a second time and think I've figured it out.  I used 1 Cup Whole Wheat Flour and 2 Cups unbleached AP flour.  Instead of all oil, I used 1.5 cups pureed peaches, sprinkled with some raw sugar (from 3 small peaches) and 1/2 Cup melted coconut oil. I added 1 tsp vanilla, and used only 1 tsp cinnamon.  I used only 1 Cup of raw sugar, and 2 large peaches yielded the 2 cups diced (Vidalia Chop Wizard works beautifully for this), which I also sprinkled with sugar.  I don't peel the peaches for either puree or diced.  What really made these stand out was that I added a cinnamon crumb topping: 1/3 Cup Sugar, 1/2 Cup Flour, 1.5 tsp Cinnamon and 1/4 Cup room temp. Butter (use pastry cutter, fork, or fingers until crumbly) - a heaping spoonful on each muffin before baking.  They were perfect after 22 minutes: moist, just sweet enough, and actually peachy tasting!  This made 32 full sized muffins, and with the changes I would give it 5 stars.

This is a great muffin recipe.  It is moist, and has a nice airy texture.  It just doesn't taste like peach.  Yes, there are peaches in it, but it tastes like a cinnamon muffin.  For a muffin (and also great as a coffee cake ring), it is well above average, but if you are looking for something infused with great peach flavor, this isn't the one.

Exceptional!  I can't tell you how many compliments I got on these muffins.  One of my friends heated it up and served it with ice cream.  It is so goohy it is almost a cobbler.  Double it and freeze.

Oh my goodness were these ever fabulous! Just a couple of changes, I used 1 1/2 cups butter (melted) rather than oil. And heeding the advice of others I wanted to add a bit of liquid so I added 1/2 cup half & half. I used 3 full cups of very ripe and juicy fresh peaches, diced. They came out perfectly crusty on the top & soft & moist inside. What a great Summer treat! Thank you!

Delicious, easy recipe!  I've made these twice so far.  First time followed recipe exactly, 2nd time used some reviewer suggestions, used cinnamon applesauce to reduce oil (I used prepackaged applesauce cup) and 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 1/2 cups white sugar, also approx. 1/4 milk.  In the first batch, I thought there weren't enough peaches so in the second batch I doubled the peaches.  I used fresh peaches, peeled and chopped them, then covered them with a small sprinkling of sugar and set aside while I mixed the other ingredients.  The second batch yielded 28 muffins loaded with peaches and took 23 minutes to bake  Yummy!  This is a keeper. I will definitely make this again-thanks!

WOW! I am not exaggerating when I say that I had to force myself to leave the kitchen so that I did not eat all of the muffins myself.  These are delicious!!! I agree that 1/2 cup of milk helps, otherwise they are perfect!!!!! Thanks for sharing.

Good and tasty peach muffins. I used peaches from the can, and it turned out delicious. I like the cinnamon. I'm still not quite sure how long you should bake and how long you should let sit, because some of them were still doughy even though the outsides of them were browning fast.

Very tasty! I used apriums instead of peaches (i found them @ sams club, they look like baby peaches and taste like a mix between peaches and apricots to me) and I used 1 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil because I couldn't justify using that much oil in one recipe. I had to add extra liquid to mine because the batter was way too thick so I used 1/4 cup chai tea (which complimented the fruit nicely!) and 1/4 cup milk, and I substituted 1 cup of white sugar for brown. I also sprinkled the tops w/ cinnamon/sugar before I baked them. Id make this again if I ever have peaches (or apriums) that need to be used, I will make sure to chop them up really good though because I liked the smaller chunks of fruit rather than the bigger chunks.

These were okay--just not spectacular. Peaches are one of my favorite fruits, and I guess I expected to really taste the fruit. I used one cup of fresh peaches and one cup of chopped, canned apricots (I didn't have enough peaches), and I thought for sure that they would be noticeable, but they weren't. The muffins just tasted like cinnamon muffins. They were nice enough in texture. I did substitute some of the oil with unsweetened applesauce. It was suggested to wait a day to serve the muffins, so I'll see if they taste better tomorrow.

I didn't want to make a full batch, but I still came out with 12 muffins using: 1-1/2 cups flour 1/2 cups whole wheat flour 1/2 tsp baking soda 1/2 tsp salt 3/4 cup vegetable oil 1/3 cup milk 2 eggs 3/4 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup white sugar 1-1/2 tsp cinnamon 1/2 tsp nutmeg splash of vanilla extract 1-1/2 cups chopped peaches I filled greased muffin cups and baked at 350 (but it was a dark pan) for exactly 20 minutes. They came out SO YUMMY! I'll definitely be making these again. With all kinds of add-ins!

I am new at making muffins and these were some of the best tasting muffins I have ever, ever eaten in my entire life (and I'm kind of old).  My mother-in-law tasted mine and had to go make some of her own.  They were awesome too.

I would resist the urge to add milk.  It is very thick batter and you sort of have to wrestle it into the muffin papers, BUT peaches are very moist and it sorts itself out during baking. Adding milk and making the batter moister will likely result in difficulty gettig thing fully cooked around the peaches (as another reviewer commented)

Tasty, some of my muffins sunk in the middle.  They have a nice tart taste.  I thought apples would taste well with this, I would not recommend using.  Would make again.

Very good muffins but still not the exact peach muffin I am looking for.  Our local store, Wegmans, makes the best ever but only for one month of the year.

This recipe was delicious.  I made it as the recipe indicated.  They came out of the oven very dark and I was afraid I had burned them but that was just the color that came out. We added struesel to the top of half of my muffins.  By themselves these muffins were excellent but with a smidge of butter in the middle it was delectable.

I thought this recipe was good. I cut back on the oil and did 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. They were a little drier than I would prefer, so I will definitely add twice as many peaches, maybe some walnuts, and some apple sauce. Otherwise, a good recipe for how easy it is (and its just so easy) and so good with coffee.

Update:  First made this in 2009 as bread.  Now in 2016 I made again - finally - as muffins and I much prefer that.  I did use 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar and I added the 1/2 cup of milk.  Used a heaping 2 cups of peaches and they do seem to work better in muffin form.  They are delicious!
From 2009: This is a nice recipe.  I made it into 2 loaves of bread.  I would recommend adding another cup of peaches if you're making bread. I couldn't really taste them. I didn't find the cinnamon to strong at all and they have a lovely flavor, just not enough peach. Oh, I also added a 1/2 cup of milk.

This batter was very thick, even after I added the peaches.  It was pretty dense and a tad too sweet for me--I'd say that a little more liquid and some more peaches would do it for me.  I made it into a bread--the recipe submitter's note that it makes 2 loaves is a bit misleading, as I halved the recipe and ended up with a very small loaf.  I have smaller bread pans, as well, and my breads tend to be taller as a result.  I'd think this could easily make a regular sized quick bread.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these this morning with fresh, juicy  peaches.  I only had 1/2 cup oil so I blended peaches to make up the rest and it worked wonderfully.  I will probably continue to do it that way as the oil sounded like a lot and I often sub applesauce for part of the oil in recipes.  I worked quickly so the peach Purée did not darken.  I also found the batter plenty moist to scoop into the muffin tins.  I got 26 muffins.

Great Muffin recipe! However I did cut down on the sugar by 3/4 cups and replaced some of the oil with yogurt. It is a thick dough but the muffins come out moist, fluffy and still pretty sweet. The timing and temperature on the recipe was perfect. Thank you for the recipe. I'll be making these again!

Made following recipe (but added maybe 3 T applesauce as my peaches weren't overly ripe and the batter needed a little more liquid.  Baked in mini muffin pan for 15 minutes and turned out excellent.  I love the bits of peach so I will add more next  time.

We always buy peaches from the local wholesale club but can never eat them all without them going bad.  So, I wanted to bake with them, but not a pie.  I was pleasantly surprised when I found this recipe!!  I did make a few changes:  I used all whole wheat flour, rapadura instead of white sugar, all butter, and I didn't peel the peaches before I chopped them up.  These muffins turned out moist and VERY good!!  Not too sweet, but sweet enough from the peaches.

Definately will not make this recipe again. The flavour was not bad, but they didnt even come out like muffins! Just sugar explosions, way to sugary and terrible texture, not nice and cakey. We picked at the tops a bit and didn't eat the rest. Do not recommend.

I have made these several times, always to rave reviews. I use 100% whole wheat pastry flour, and usually use a healthier sweetener, such as Succanat. I also usually use melted butter instead of oil. The cooking time is a little high, if you leave these in for the full 25 minutes, they are going to get brown on top. I think 20 minutes is about perfect for these. They are quite yummy, they really showcase fresh summer peaches nicely!

good muffins... Using less sugar is always an option and I found that using just under 2 cups was plenty sweet. I cut back on oil too, and used some water and added a splash to make it mix better in the end. The peaches do release juices when they are baking so don't worry if the batter seems thick, it's not. Thanks again. Also added a dash of ground ginger and a splash of vanilla extract

I made these today and they were amazing! I chopped the peaches ahead of time and topped them with 1/3 cup of sugar and let them sit for a little over an hour. I think the sweetened juice really must have done the trick since I did not have to add milk. I also reduced the cinnamon and added a tablespoon of vanilla (I can never follow a recipe exactly). I wanted to put a streussal topping on them but my food processor blended instead of making crumbs of my brown sugar, butter, flour mix so I dropped clumps of that on top and it sank to the bottom of the muffin and melted into an ooey gooey caramel center in the middle of each muffin. I will make these again and again.

Very very good.  I cut the recipe in half (it said it would make 8 muffins), used 4 small peaches that I cut into small chunks, used 1/2 cup packed brown sugar instead of 1 cup white sugar, used 3/4 whole wheat flour and 3/4 cup white flour, used 1 egg & 1 egg white, 1/2 cup applesauce & 2 tbsp oil and a dash of milk. I also used 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. I dressed up the muffin tops with some rolled oats and brown sugar.  I baked them for 20 minutes, they made 10 muffins and they were perfect!

These muffins are awesome! The only changes that I made to the recipe was increasing the diced peaches to 3 cups and adding 1/2 cup milk. They were so moist, even the next day. The recipe make 22 regular size muffins; I froze half. Thanks for sharing this outstanding recipe which is a real keeper!

These are a really great spice muffin, not so much  of a great peach muffin. They were a great use for my frozen bagged peach pieces though and I will probably use it again for any questionable fruit that needs a helping hand in the flavor department.

This is one delicious recipe.  I bought and peeled 2lb. of good-sized, very ripe peaches. I was careful to capture all the juice. Then I used my hands to mash and puree the peach meat and juice. It ended up using 2 1/2 cups of peaches and I think it was plenty because I had chunks and can't imagine it being any moister than it was.  I also found that I had so much batter that I decided to make a loaf in addition to 12 muffins. I didn't want 2-3 dozen muffins. It's makes a lot of batter. The loaf cooked I think for 45 min. at the same temp as the muffins.   There's probably enough batter to make a bundt type cake too.  Will DEFINITELY make this again.

Yum!!  I made these to take to my Sunday School class and couldn't resist trying one.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  My peaches were really ripe and juicy - no extra liquid needed.  These were really good.

First time I did this recipe in a loaf pan,I followed it to the letter. Batter was way too wet and it took ages to bake, and  I ended up burning the top besides. So on my next attempt. I reduced the oil to just 50ml, and made up for it by adding about 1/4 cup of milk and more peaches, which I pureed. Also reduced the sugar to 300g as in my opinion, the peaches were sweet enough. Other alterations were adding 1 teaspoon of mixed spice and chopped walnuts. Batter came out nicely thick and "spoony". This time I carefully kept an eye on the oven, and put foil over the top of the pan in the final 20 minutes of baking. Cake came out nicely browned and tasted great. Will probably do it again, adding perhaps coconut or sultanas for variety.

I made this as a loaf.  Tasted GOOD, just not as PEACHY as I would have liked.  The cinnamon could probably be reduced a bit.  Very moist on the inside and crusty on the outside, so a good quick bread recipe overall...just not a lot of fruit flavor, if that's what you're looking for!

These are delicious. I cut the recipe in half and still ended up with 10 muffins. They actually taste better a day or two later. Very moist and flavorful.

These were very good! Super quick and easy, and a nice new way to use up our summer peaches. 

I used just-picked peaches, and thus they were moist enough that I didn't need to add liquid. However, I can see how that would be needed with less juicy peaches. 

I took a few suggestions from here as well - added a little nutmeg, and 1 cup of whole wheat flour.

I used a 1/2 cup of milk and peaches I canned last summer and these turned out delicious. As soon as they got out of the oven I topped with butter and a sugar and cinnamon mixture. They were a little dry the next day but still excellent!!

These are wonderful!  Be warned though, they are more of a peach cobbler muffin than a healthy breakfast fruit muffin.  These are so yummy though and as other reviewers mentioned, would be good with a number of fruits!

Just made this and it is fantastic! The only alteration I made was adding half a cup of milk to the batter. They were also done in closer to 20 minutes than 25. I will definitely be making these again.

I thought this recipe was very good.  I like nutmeg, so I cut back the cinnamon and added some.  I also added the suggested 1/2 cup of milk, we live in high altitude, so more moisture is needed.  My grandmother taught me to dissolve baking soda in fluid before placing it in the recipe to avoid its flavor when finished, so I put it in the milk.  Since my peaches lacked a little flavor last year, due to drought, I added a little peach flavoring.

These are really good.  The base with out the peaches can also be mixed with any other kind of fruit.  I split the recipe, adding peaches to half and rasberries to half.  Everyone who has tried these has loved them.

Excellent way to use up peaches.  Delicious.  Added some salted pecans to batter and baked 10 min additional at 350. Wasn't quite done at printed time.  Maybe the pans were a tad small..

Followed the recipe exactly.  I only set the timer for 20 minutes and when I came back, the muffins were overcooked.  If I were to make these again, I would definitely cut back on the sugar.

i love the texture and softness of the muffin.  i used canned peach, and it's possibly because of that that I didn't get a peachy taste.  Should up the peaches next time.  Also, I only used 1 teaspoon cinnamon and it was still way too strong.  Also added about 1/3 syrup.  Lastly, I was surprised how much muffins this made.  It made about  36 cupcake sized muffins!

Thought this was ok-good.  I made 12muffins and then used the rest for a bread.  The muffins were good but "wet" around the area where the peaches were-maybe need to coat the peaches with flour before baking, don't know if that would help. Don't know that I will make again!

This recipe was good.  I think the trick is to mash your peaches.  This gives you the extra moisture that some reviewers said was lacking.  I didn't add any milk.  The batter turned out just like muffin batter is supposed to. I am going to go eat another.  Thanks!

This recipe tastes really good. The dough was really strange though. Extremely thick and not your normal consistency of muffins or bread. It was quick and easy to make. Messy though. May try to play with it a bit because the taste is very good.
