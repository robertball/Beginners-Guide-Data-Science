I think I agree with Gera21.  I tasted before adding the vinegar then after and think it spoiled it somewhat.  So I added 1 more Tbsp of maple syrup and that seemed to really help.  Served it with a dollop of sour cream and bacon bits.  Will definitely be making this again.

This soup is DELISHES despite the few ingredients .   Besides cutting my thumb while cutting the squash it was a painless recipe for someone like me that doesn't have any patience for standing in front of the stove.  Will definitely repeat, minus the injury lets hope.

Another brilliant, successful Chef John recipe!  I had some leftover stock and veggies from my St. Paddy's day corned beef and cabbage, and some extra cubed butternut squash from Costco taking up room in my fridge.  I decided to search for a Chef John version of butternut squash and voila!  Here it was.

The only things that I did differently were to use the (strained) leftover stock and cabbage in the soup.  I did everything else to a T and the depth of flavor in the soup was just spectacular!  I absolutely loved the zing and flavor of the apple cider vinegar.  I will thank you forever, Chef John, for all that you do!  This one's a keeper.

It was spectacular!  I made a few changes.  I used dried sage, a tiny bit of maple syrup I had left and added a few pinches of stevia brown sugar.  I didn't use any cream but the bacon crumbles on the top really made it extra special.  I look forward to making it again!

This recipe was good until I added the vinegar. It killed it for me. 
I would definitely make the recipe again but next time I'll omit the apple cider vinegar. To balance the sweetness I'll just add bacon bits as a garnish...

I just tried my first bowl of this soup. I made it per the recipe, and I wouldn't change anything. This is a wonderfully flavorful soup that I will continue to make throughout the rest of the fall and winter and plan to take with me to the family Thanksgiving dinner.

We had an overabundance of butternut squash in our garden this year, so this recipe was a life saver for preserving the good bounty of the garden! I made A LOT of this soup and canned it- it is delicious! Pureed everything in my vitamix, so it is super smooth. It is great to pair with some homemade rolls or bread for a warm winter meal. I have never added the creme fraiche, and think it is perfectly fine without it. Would just make it more elegant- because it is still superb without the extra creme. Will be making it next fall if our squash does well again. I'm looking forward to it!

Very good! I had never made squash before so I dont know if I properly cooked them, since it was hard to get off the skin. Didnt have sage so I used some fresh rosemary. (Also doubled the butter because I hate my heart). If I had smoked salt would have used that.

Overall amazing. This will enter my rotation of weekly soups.

This was the best Butternut Squash soup that I have ever had. The whole family, even the 2 year old, went back for seconds. I did not add the creme fresch at the end as my grocery store doesn't carry it this time of year. I will make this over and over exactly as it is written. Super easy! Oh, I don't have an immersion blender so I used my Ninja blender and it was the perfect consistency, no chunks. Chef John, you continue to be my favorite go-to!

After reading a bunch of reviews I decide to make it my own and followed the vegetable ratios generally and the spices mostly.
I added a few celery sticks that had seen better days and didn't measure the carrots. Just chopped up 3 medium sized ones. I had a couple sweet potatoes in the fridge peeled and in need of something to be done with them so they got chopped and added to the pan!
I've decide that next time (and there will be!) I will peel the squash prior to roasting as my hands don't work well and I found it harder to scrape the squash out of the skin than to peel it raw.
I went out and bought some maple syrup to give this a true chance and was a little on the fence about the cider vinegar.
After straining the soup, which I left on the thick side I decided to sample the leftovers in the strainer with cider and added it 1/8th of a teaspoon at a time to the bowl.
Without the cider vinegar, I thought it was a little on sweet side and wasn't too sure of how I felt about a whole pot of it. After the cider added I thought that while I liked it some better it was missing something.
I added salt & pepper and it still was a little shy of great. I went back to the recipe and realized that I hadn't added any cayenne pepper. I sprinkled some on, mixed it in and finished off the bowl of soup. The cayenne pulled it all together and I can't wait for the creme fraiche to be ready and try it again!
This is a recipe that I would serve to friends and will be making fairly regularly this

This is my new favorite soup.  I almost followed the recipe exactly.  As I was roasting the veggies, I noticed everything but the squash was done much sooner than the squash, so I pulled it out and left the squash in.  I am glad I did.  I missed one piece of onion and it was very burned.  I also forgot to add the vinegar at the end.  I don't know that I missed it.  I thought this was terrific without.

Another great Chef John recipe. One note though:  don't cut your carrots and onions too small, they will get done way before the squash does. Also, I leave the skins on the garlic cloves and then just squeeze out the pulp or pull the skins off afterward. They are much easier to peel this way. For even more depth of flavor, add a few thyme springs while it simmers. Just remember to remove before blending.

This recipe started with a disaster. The mix of onions carrots and garlic burned to a crisp well before butternut squash became soft. Threw the onions out, chop more onions and garlic and sautéed the mix on stovetop. Washed 1/3 pound of baby carrots and steamed them for 20 minutes on stovetop. When all vegetables cooled off, put them through food processor. Placed the veggies into Pot,  diluted with homemade chicken stock and water to desired consistency, and simmered for about 45 minutes.  Toward the end of simmering  added lots of honey, sage butter, salt and pepper, small piece of ginger,  organic apple cider. 
Bottom line – do not roast small pieces of vegetables in the same pan as 2 huge chunk s of butter nut squashes , the small pieces are likely to burn before two halves of butternut squash  get ready.  Chef John, you should know better than giving this advice. On the other hand, flavoring the soup with sage butter and apple cider was an excellent idea. This is why I'm giving 2 stars to this recipe.

This was so good!  I was looking for a fully blended soup without tomatoes after hernia surgery. As others suggested, I tasted it before adding the vinegar and decided it didn't need it. I also skipped the onions because of the surgery, which I normally would have included. It was still fantastic; I can't wait to be able to make this with onions!  Thank you so much!

Excellent soup on its own or as a luxurious bisque - just add a bit of sherry before serving. 

Also makes a good base for seafood, specifically lump crabmeat. Based on suggestions of others, I omitted the cider vinegar.

It was delicious!  Made like recipe except used only 1/2 tsp vinegar & made a bundle of ground sage to put in browned butter. Also used 1/4 cup of half & half & garnished with bacon. A little time consuming but so worth it. Yummy!

Delicious! I tasted the soup before adding the vinegar, and determined it was incredible without it (also, I didn't have any apple cider vinegar, so that worked out well for me). There are already so many layers of flavor with this soup with the roasted vegetables and sage butter, so it's not missing much without the vinegar. I will definitely be making this again.

I am not a fan of butternut squash anything. But when the CSA gives you a 6lbs. butternut squash, I made this recipe. I followed it to a 't' and it was amazing! The dash of cayenne was a great touch!

I'm doing backflips over how delicious this soup is!  Wow.  I usually dislike butternut squash soup because it's too sweet.  This one is velvety (thanks blender) and has savory depths of flavor.  Bravo!  Such a winner.   Inexpensive, no squash-peeling,  healthy.  I can't say enough.  I made it exactly as written except that I tasted it before the cider vinegar and decided it was perfect without.   My husband loved it too.  Definitely making it again.  And again.  THANK YOU!

This makes for a very tasty soup. I was not able to follow the recipe exactly since I didn't have all the ingredients and due to some of  my forgetfulness. Half way through the roasting, I added half a red pepper with the vegetables. I forgot to brown the butter since I didn't have fresh sage. I had used dry thyme on the roasting veggies.  I made a broth from the bottom of the roasting pan after removing the veggies. I didn't bother to strain the soup. I omitted the creme fraiche since I didn't have any, but I don't think it needed it either. My husband thought it was a great soup too, and that is saying a lot for someone who is picky about soups.

It was delicious eventually... However, the squash was still hard as a rock after an hour. Maybe because I used a roasting pan with high sides? Anyway, after baking it more, nuking it a few times, it was finally tender enough. It tasted great following Chef John's recipes.

This is my favorite butternut squash soup recipe. The sage infused butter make the flavor so rich. Roasting the squash is the only way to go.

The only change I made was that I had peeled and cut my butternut squash before I found the recipe. So I just added the cut squash to the onions, carrots and garlic and roasted as directed. I also had homemade chicken stock that I used.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  My guests asked me for the recipe also, which I was happy to share.

Chef John has become synonymous with delicious and well written recipes!  This is no exception. My husband and I love squash soup and I am always searching for creative and tasty new ways to prepare it. This surprised because it was so simple yet created such a wonderful blend of flavors.  I didn't roast the vegetables, because I was using thanksgiving leftover squash.  I simply sautéed the onions and carrots until they just started to brown then added the squash and crushed garlic, the remaining ingredients!   I can't wait to make this in a cold winter day when I have the time to roast the vegetables as called for.   Thank you Chef John for another great recipe!

The brown butter made a huge difference! Straining the soup was much harder than it showed on the video - it took me a good 10-15 minutes and sore arms but this step made the soup velvety smooth. Loved how it turned out!

Made this for Thanksgiving last year instead of appetizers.  Everyone loved it and I felt better for serving something healthy! I'll be making it again this year, but I don't have fresh butternut squash from my garden - I'll have to use store bought. I hope it turns out just as good...

Made this exactly as it was written, and it was fabulous! I garnished it with toasted Pepitas & sour cream instead of crime fraiche. My husband, who hates squash, absolutely loved it and said it was one of his favorite soups I’ve ever made! Next time I think o will cut up the squash into chunks before roasting because it was too hot to scoop it out, and I think getting more carmelization on the squash would make it even better! This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I've made this twice and both times it has turned out so wonderfully. It definitely has a gorgeous autumnal sweet flavour with a bit of heat from the cayenne and tang from the vinegar. I would suggest going for a larger more middle-aged butternut for this recipe rather than a young, early season butternut. The second time I made this the butternut was slightly underripe and it was quite difficult to scoop the flesh away from the skin without the whole squash breaking apart. Otherwise I would say you can make it exactly as written without any issues. 

I didn't have creme fraiche so I subbed in some full-fat sour cream and it was delish. Happy souping!

Delicious flavor and great consistency. The sage butter adds a great note.  I also added a sliced tart apple to the roasting pan. However--I know vinegar. I love vinegar. But 2 tablespoons is a lot to add all at once. I would suggest adding a teaspoon at a time to taste. I probably ended up using closer to one tablespoon. Two would have killed it. I would definitely make this again and again.

Followed the recipe exactly except I substituted onion greens for the chives.  Everybody loved it, even my husband who thinks he doesn’t like squash.  This is definitely a recipe I’ll be making again.

Would absolutely make this soup again— very hearty and savory!!  One of the ingredients for success was the nutty sage brown butter— I threw in the buttered sage leaves in the soup (as in the video)!  I did as suggested and put the soup through a sieve..... also blended it in a blender— same consistency, and the blender was easier .  I did not add the cider vinegar— just made it last night, so will have some today—may try it with the vinegar.... will see which one selection I like best!
Absolutely scrumptious!  Used ingredients as measured— came out to 12 cups of soup.

made several versions from AllRecipies - and this is by far the best.  I did add some cloves and pumpkin spice, as well as a bit of cream at the end to my taste, but as directed was very good as well.

Super tasty, easy to make and very flavorful. The brown sage butter added a very nice touch! Made this soup with Toasted cheese sandwiches made using  Sourdough bread, arugula, apricot preserves, provolone, swiss and a sprinkling of chives inside. Finished with flake salt on both sides of bread.

It was a snowy day.  I had a butternut squash and most of the ingredients. This soup is delicious. I can hardly wait to make it with all of the ingredients.  Changes of necessity this time  were dried sage instead if fresh, and for the first time in forever I didn't have fresh garlic! I used 1/2 tsp of garlic powder added to the broth stage. Also added just 1 tsp if the Apple cider vinegar per other posts. I didn't have a strainer course enough but the texture was still smooth. Also the squash needed more roasting than the onions would tolerate so had to separate them early. will definitely make this again. Thank you again, Chef John.

A wonderful recipe. The only soup changes I made were to add 1/2-2/3 of the suggested amounts of broth, syrup and vinegar and adjusted to taste after simmering (thanks to previous reviews!). My husband crumbled bacon and I fried more sage leaves in butter (meatless Monday) & crumbled over sour cream dollops.

As usual, when I make a recipe it is revised due to not enough this or that.  I had only 1 small onion so I added some leftover boiled potato & a few chopped up celery sticks. The directions didn't say whether to keep the sage leaves or remove so I pureed them into the batch.  More chicken stock required (1L) and fresh ground pepper.  Voila another butchered recipe that turned out tasting excellent.  And yes, I'll do it again. Cheesy baking powder biscuits made this recipe a must-do-again for our current, chilly Cariboo weather.

Best butternut squash soup I have ever had.  The sage butter really make this dish.  A perfect Fall soup. 

I find it easier to peel the butternut squash first, before roasting it.  Once it comes out of the oven, it's hot and takes a long time to cool down enough to handle.  I don't have that kind of patience, and scooping hot roasted squash out of the skin is about as fun as it sounds.

I have made squash soup before, but this recipe is definitely the much tastier version.  The sage-infused brown butter was really cool!

This is the best butternut squash soup recipe I have ever made. You can totally eliminate the creme fraiche if  you are dairy free... It's rich and delicious..

This soup is delicious.  Made it just like recipe with the exception I only had red onions.  Was so aromatic and tasty with them.

Oh my goodness, this was delicious! I omitted the apple cider vinegar and cayenne pepper, as other reviewers suggested. It did not need it whatsoever. I topped it with a few goat cheese crumbles and crouton pieces for a crunch. I’ll be making this each time I get a butternut squash and carrots in my CSA box for sure!

I have many good butternut squash soup recipes but this is definitely the best. I made it exactly as demonstrated (There seems to be a couple of details missing from the written instructions.) I used sour cream but will make creme fraiche the next time.

I'm not exagerating at all when I say this is one of the most amazing soups I have ever tasted.  We recently started a diet with no wheat, soy, sugar or pork.  We were only on day two when I fixed this.  I used sour cream instead of creme fraiche but that was my only tweak.  My sweetie said it was the best soup he has ever tasted.  It is rich and hearty and we have enjoyed it for two days since.  I will be making this often, especially as fall and winter approach.

wow. just wow. worth the cooking times. 
I made everything as written except I needed to sub ground sage for fresh sage - I'm sure there'd be a richer profile with the fresh but honestly, this was so good that I would do it again this way. 
after the blending, I omitted the apple cider (because I didn't have it, and other reviewers said it wasn't necessary - and I agree. full depth of flavor without it!) and instead of creme fraiche, i put in a dollop of nonfat greek yogurt. 
delish! very filling.

We loved this! Thank you Chef John! I loved the roasted veggies that added another layer of flavor. This is now my go to recipe for Butternut squash.  I have made it with the vinegar and without both are good but my hubby prefers no vinegar. This is a keeper.

It ended up tasting ok but I found the garlic a little overpowering. I followed the recipe exactly and it was too thin. Refrigerated overnight, bought another squash, baked it an hour and added to the soup with immersion blender. Even though my vegetables looked like the video, must have been darker as the soup was darker looking as well. Not as pretty as pictured! I love squash soup but would try a different recipe.

I made this for Christmas dinner 2017 at a friend's house.
Changes I made:
1.	I added one granny smith apple because it was specified in another butternut squash recipe that I had originally planned to make. 
2.	I used a little dry sherry in place of some of the chicken stock.
3.	I used sherry vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar. 
4.	I simmered it longer than specified, but if anything I think that improved it.
When I first tasted it I thought it was too "earthy", perhaps because of the sherry and sherry vinegar, but I guess the extra simmering drove off some of the volatiles and the addition of the crème fraiche soften the edges because in the end I thought it had improved, and it was a big hit with the other guests.
UPDATE: I made it again and it was better this time, probably because I was more careful to pick out the vegetables that were overly roasted (charred), and I did a better job with the brown butter. I again used a little dry sherry in addition to the chicken stock and sherry vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar. 
Since it was just for my wife and me I skimped a little on the details: sour cream instead of crème fraiche and green onions instead of chives because that what we had on hand.
I still really love this recipe and will make it again.

I did add a little cream to each bowl as I served it. The soup was fantastic! The touch of cider vinegar gave it a little balance against the sweetness of the squash and carrots. I will make it again!

Finally a really good butternut squash recipe! My squash was probably 1/2 the size so I cut the recipe in half with the exception of the carrot. I kept the carrot at about a cup because my carrot was large. I cut up my squash and roasted with the rest. 
I had 2 cups homemade chicken broth so I had to use 1 cup water with a bullion cube. I didn't have fresh sage but I had dried sage and used 1/2 tsp for my halved recipe.
Turned out wonderful! Definitely a keeper!

I made this according to Chef John's instructions, but knew it wouldn't be sweet enough for my husband.  So instead of following the ingredients exactly, I added 5 c. chicken broth and one cup of leftover mulled cider.  I also added one Golden delicious apple when I put everything into the stock put. It is delicious with these additions, but would have followed recipe exactly if my husband didn't have to have a lot of sweetness in his foods. Curse, but this time, really was outstanding. I also added about a T. of brandy at the end.

Chef, I typically do not rate or review but the exception is when I come along recipes that are exceptional, simple, flavorful and do not need any tweaking..
 This Butternut Squash Soup fit all the criteria and was a pleasure to consume.
 For anyone thinking of NOT putting this soup through the strainer  don’t do it. This last step insures that velvety texture.
 Well done Chef John!!!!

Loved it!  Adding the vinegar really helped liven it up, but I think it was a bit too much.  Next time I'll halve the vinegar and add more maple.  Also I think instead of roasting the squash and other veggies together, I'll just sautee the veggies while the squash softens in the oven.  Half my veggies burned.  I might add just a touch of nutmeg, too.

Did not change a thing.  It was yummy.  There are a lot of steps to this recipe, and it did take some time to prepare, but it was worth the effort.  This is now a seasonal favorite.  I served it with Chef John's creme fraiche, and chopped chives.  Put out a hearty bread and you're good to go.

I loved it, but I'm watching my calorie intake so I left the butter out and just sprinkled a little bit of chopped fresh sage over the top and a dollop of Greek yogurt. Thank you, this  is my favourite Butternut squash soup ever!

Made as written, this was a very tasty soup!  Such a good Fall flavor and soup is always good when the weather is cold and rainy like it is today!  I did only add 1 t. of the vinegar, as I was afraid of not caring for the flavor as so many others had reported.  I'm glad I did, it would have ruined it for me.  I did make the Creme Fraiche that Chef John speaks of in the video.  It takes 2 days, so plan ahead...but very much worth it!

I followed the recipe exactly and this is delicious! The vinegar really balances everything and I feel the cayenne is a must. I think this could easily be tweaked to your taste. Probably more onions and garlic for me or a bit more maple syrup would be awesome if you have a sweet tooth. I'll definitely make this again.

I really enjoy watching Chef John's segments and often learn techniques that extend beyond the particular recipe at hand. I stayed predominantly on the recipe with happy success. The biggest problem was not having enough leftovers, so next time I'm doubling up!

I normally love Chef John's recipes. I won't make this one again though. It is A LOT of work and time for what turned out to be a so-so soup. The flavor was fine. I omitted the cider vinegar as many other posters suggested. I did set aside a small serving of soup that I added a few drops of the vinegar to and I agree that omitting it is the way to go. If I ever did decide to do this again, I would absolutely by the peeled and pre cut butternut squash. Removing the skins after roasting was a messy pain in the neck, an the skins certainly don't add anything to the flavor. I'd just toss the cubed squash with the onions, carrots, and garlic and roast that.

When I made it the first time, I followed the recipe, although it tasted good, thought the onion flavor was too strong.  Roasting is my favorite method for root vegetables, but it takes longer to make this soup and more dishes to wash.  The second time I made it, I cooked the vegetables in the chicken broth, and reduced the onion to about 2 Tablespoons.  Each time I made it, was for 50 servings.  Topped it with about 1 tsp. of browned butter.

I was afraid to try the vinegar so I left it out. I doubled the cayenne (at least) since we like it spicier. And I used my regular blender and skipped the straining. It came out beautifully and was very well received. Next time I'll try a little vinegar and see what that does....and I used all vegetable broth to make it vegetarian.

Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my.  This soup is beyond fantastic -- I would give it 10 stars if I could!  Even my four Afganst teenagers wolfed it down.  Quite a complement since they tend to be wary of anything "different".  You've done it again, Chef John!  Bless you.

One of my fall favorites! I peel and cut the squash in chunks to roast with the other veggies (wrap the garlic cloves in foil so they don't burn).  Curry and a thumb of fresh ginger are delicious simmered in the broth. I use my immersion blender, and add coconut milk to the finished soup, instead of creme fraiche. Also, I don't add vinegar.

Great soup base!! I omitted the vinegar,  cayenne pepper, and creme fraiche. Instead, I added a half cup of half and half, some extra salt to taste, and shredded rotisserie chicken. We will definitely be making this again!

Very delicious!  The reason that I gave it four stars instead of five is that, like a lot of other reviewers, I thought that the cider was a bit much.  I threw in a tablespoon of brown sugar to counter the sour flavor, and that did the trick.  I do believe that the cider adds something, but the next time I will add it a teaspoon at a time to find the correct balance.  I confess that I added more than a pinch of cayenne, too!  I love the sweet/spicy contrast.  The only other change I made was using vegetable broth instead of chicken because I am a vegetarian.  This one's a keeper!  I'll make it again for sure.

This is fantastic, and the only thing I did differently was to add beer to make it the consistency I prefer, as I do with most of my soup recipes.
Everyone who tasted this soup, asked for the recipe!

Followed the recipe, using a bourbon infused maple syrup and omitted the vinegar.  Topped with sour cream and pumpkin seeds... delicious and extremely smooth texture.  A keeper recipe! Thanks for the video, it was helpful.

I've made this several times since discovering the recipe last fall. It is simple, delicious, and makes a full meal paired with bread. Don't skip straining the soup. It's the difference between a nice soup and fancy, wow soup. The hardest part is clean up (roasting pan, skillet pan, strainer, blender, pot).

Best I have had but had some trouble with recipe as written. Did not work to roast carrots, onions with the squash. Will do separately in future..also carrots and onions only need about 30 minutes. Used half the vinegar and I think it helped. Omitted creme fresche but topped with ground pepper, crumbled bacon and sour cream. Overall very tasty!

This was delicious. I can't really add anything else that hasn't already been mentioned; except that the Apple cider vinegar makes its even better. I wouldn't suggest omitting it, even though it is good without. It just finishes the flavors. The only small change I had to make was using sour cream instead of creme fraiche as a topping. I didn't try bacon, but I can only imagine it would be even better. Everything is better with bacon.

My whole family loved this recipe!  Unfortunately I burned the vegetables that I cooked with the squash since it took the whole hour to cook the squash and I cut up the veggies too small.  I fixed this by sautéing fresh onions, carrots and garlic in the sage butter prior to adding the broth and the scoops of squash.  The flavor was amazing with the roasted squash and the sage.  I strained the soup after using the immersion blender and the consistency was just right.  Thanks Chef John!

I this my favorite of any butternut soup that I've tried. My four year old LOVES it (without the pepper), as does the rest of my family (with the pepper). It takes some time but it's worth every minute. I use Braggs apple cider vinegar and I disagree with other posts. The vinegar is really needed to balance the flavors.

Great soup - roasting the veggies really made the soup special. I used veggie stock to make it vegetarian and it still turned out wonderful. I am not too fond of apple cider vinegar, so instead of dumping in the entire 2Tbs, I just added to taste. One of my favorite soups so far.

Made this recipe and my husband loved it. He had three bowls. Really good. Loved the roasted taste.
It is time consuming but well worth it. Not a fan of the vinegar either.

This was really tasty!  The family just loved it.  I did not roast my butternut squash; put it in the microwave instead.  But I did roast my carrots and onions.  I also added some leftover cooked Syracuse potatoes to the soup, blended all with the immersion blender, and it was fantastic - so creamy and delicious!  I also used mostly turkey broth, along with some chicken broth.  This is a keeper for every Autumn!

Though time consuming, the roasted veggies were  so rich and thus the soup had a nutty fantastic flavor...I had to use  sage pwdr, put it into the butter....and threw in a pinch of  curry...this  soup has become  everyones favorite. It is  easy to freeze, and then reheat, I skipped the creme fraiche, as it was unnecessary. The soup is creamy and easily adjusted..ie  one time I added 2 tart apples and this was also delicious....worth the effort..

Unbelievably delicious, heaven on a spoon! My husband says it was better than any high end restaurant has produced. I made it just as written except I added some diced green pepper and I eyeballed everything instead of measuring. Can not wait to make this again!

Chef John has done it again!  This soup is hands -down  the best butternut squash soup I have EVER had, much less made.
I made this exactly as written  with 2 additions.  To make up for the weight of the squash, I used 1 sweet potato and in order to use it up, I added 2 peeled and sliced parsnips along with the carrots. 
The rest was as written.
The smooth, velvety texture was heavenly and you can taste the full favor of the roasted vegetables.  Roasting them and allowing  them to develop their sweetness really takes this soup to a whole other level.
Thank you, Chef  John!   This soup will be making an appearance on our Thanksgiving table this year and in our future Thanksgiving celebrations!

I just made this in my Vitamix. Put half the roasted vegetables,  3 cups of vegetable broth, 1 tbsp of pure maple syrup and the melted sage butter. It came out great! This soup doesn't have the typical butternut squash taste which I love! Thanks, Chef John!

This was amazing!! Happy that there is no cream cheese involved. I used homemade stock and I'm sure that added to the flavour! Hands down I'm making this again. Chef John never disappoints!

I added a little more maple syrup and cinnamon - my family went crazy for it - no leftovers!

This soup was outstanding!! I followed the directions pretty accurately. I didn't use fresh sage leaves, but some ground sage and I didn't add the creme fraiche or chives. I'm sure the addition of the creme fraiche and chives would have made it even better. 
I had to leave the house for a few hours after the veg was roasted, so I let it set in a pot on the stove in the middle of step 5 (right before you bring it to a simmer). It still turned out great.
