Wow loved this recipe.  The house smelled great while this was cooking.  Only change I made was add some mushrooms because we loved them.  Also before I had heated the oil and bay leaves I had prepped the meat, onions and mushrooms ahead of time this to prevent the burning of the bay leave as per one reviewer had mentioned.  Then as they were frying prepped the tatters and carrots.  Will be making again.

Recipe Group Selection:  17, January 2015 ~ This review is based on only my DH opinion.  I made this with venison rather than beef, that was my only change.  He loved this dish!  He loved the texture, the venison, the veggies and the broth, and he does NOT like Guinness® beer!  He said the combination of the ingredients worked really well together.  I purchased 1 can of Guinness® for this recipe.  I freaked out when I poured the Guinness® in the pan. There was something in the can that moved. I got a flashlight to see what it was. It was a milky white ball. I told my hubby I thought it was an eyeball. He assured me it wasn't, but he took the can apart to be sure. LOL Never having purchased a can of Guinness® I wasn't aware that there is a ball of nitrous.  It helps create the foamy frothiness when you pour out the beer.  All that being said, hubby loved his dinner and told me to "feel free to make this one again!"  Thanks dad2twins, for sharing your recipe!

made for recipe group 1/21/15: First of all, the flavor was really good and it was easy to prepare so I would make it again. However, the bay leaf burned in the pan before I could add the beef. I removed it and added another when moving to the oven. My only change was to use leftover, medium rare beef with a little extra broth to compensate for juices that fresh might have contributed. I halved the recipe, so used a 3qt pot, and after 2 hours the carrots were perfect, the potatoes were just done, and the onions all but disappeared. It came out of the oven with no liquid. There was a light coating on the chunks but I could have easily ate this from a plate with a fork. Since the description says to have some sopping bread handy, this was not the texture I expected. It tasted great but I then I added another 1.5 cups broth to get to what's in my photo. I would make it again but with more liquid from the start(both beer and broth so as not to change the flavor ratio).

Recipe Group: here's how I really feel! Guinness=Magic. This is the epitome of beef stew, which is incidentally torture to make because your house will smell divine and you can't eat the source for three hours. This recipe cannot be improved in any way. Thank you, thank you thank you.

Made for Recipe Group. A good basic beef stew with bonus-Beer! Gives it a good flavor. I like that it preps on stovetop, then goes into the oven. Thanks for the recipe!

Recipe Group.  Pros...no tomato products or canned or packaged soups.  Easily cooked in the oven with no chance of burning in my overly hot slow cooker.  Meat and veg perfectly done in 3 hrs.  Cons....very bitter &/or sour taste. No beef flavor.  I added a TBS sugar about 2.5 hrs which improved it considerably.  The only tweak I made  was to omit the potatoes.  I served this over green beans.  4 stars from DH, 2 from me so 3 over all.  Guess I'm just not a Guinness fan.

Recipe group 1/17/2015:  I love the flavor the beer imparts to this.  The veggies and herbs this calls for are just right.  I will make again.  Not sure what I will do with 3 more bottles of Guinness, I I bet I think of something!  :-D

With a regular supply of moose I am always looking for a way of taking the edge off the gamey flavour and getting a tender meal. By substituting 3 or 4 moose steaks for beef I have found a winner. This combination is a success and I don't really mess with the recipe but I do use a ziplock bag to coat the meat with flour. I find it isn't as messy and much faster. My only concern was that my company arrived late and the stew became almost too thick (I thinned it with water as sacrificing another Guinness wasn't in the cards). The old iron pot works nearly too well. My children have always enjoyed wild meat as I always do something interesting with it and usually employ lots of herbs and/or spices.

Turned out really well. I think next time, I would cut the onions (personal preference) and add mushrooms.  Maybe would add some cold water and cornstarch mixture at the end to thicken it up a bit.  I like a little thicker liquid. Definitely would go well with some fresh sourdough or French bread.

3-10-2016  ~  ~What interested me to try this recipe was because in all the decades I’ve made beef stew, I’ve never made it with beer.  The rest of the ingredients are nearly identical to how I typically make stew, so aside from making some minor modifications, the difference was pretty much just the beer.  First, I prepared it all on the stove only because that’s my comfort zone.  (Simmer beef for about 1-1/2 hours before adding the vegetables – this needs no more, but no less, cooking time. Simmer another half hour or so once you add the vegetables. Thicken as necessary at the end with a flour slurry) In addition to the potatoes and carrots I added cabbage, chunky slices of celery and sliced mushrooms - because I always do - because it tastes good.  The stew was very good. But it surprisingly tasted no different with the new ingredient, beer.  Now of course I don’t expect the stew to taste like beer.  What I am saying, however, is that since neither I nor Hubs detected any difference between this stew made with beer and the stew I typically make without it, I say keep it in the ingredients list, but drink it while you’re making the stew.

We really enjoyed this. I made this with sirloin as it was cheaper than stewing beef. I also left out the potatoes and cabbage, personal preference, and added a package of petite gourmet mushrooms. I had everything prepped and ready before I started cooking. After reading the reviews I decided to add the bay leaf later than specified. It was fairly easy to put together and the aroma was amazing. It's a keeper!! Thanks dad2twins for sharing.

Overall, this was pretty yummy.  I had to make a few small changes... I added a little more garlic than the recipe called for because we are garlic lovers in this house.  Also, I did add the bay leaves to the oil, even though I was suspicious.  Unfortunately, as I feared, they burnt to a crisp in no time at all.  So I added some into the dish before it went into the oven so that the bay flavor could really get into there.  And finally, I didn't add the fresh parsley until I pulled it out of the oven because if you add it too early, all the freshness and brightness will cook right out of it.  The sauce was pretty yummy, even though I think there was a touch too much flour in it... didn't stop me from sopping it up with my bread!  Might make again, with a few tweaks next time.  Thank you for the recipe!

Made it using the recipe but cooked it in a crockpot after deglazing the pan.  It was a bit too salty for my taste but otherwise wonderful!

I liked the recipe and will use it again.  I did use less beef and added more vegetables. I like cabbage so I chopped some up  and added it to the mix.  It still retained the flavor of beef.

Awesome stew that reminded me of my moms.
I up'd the ingredients by 50% relatively straight across the recipe with the exception of the garlic, I probably doubled that.
I also increased the initial temp to 325 for the first 90 minutes to omit the simmer period on top of the stove for the vegetables. Instead of precooking everything, I just browned the meat and added the onions in a skillet, then tossed everything into a large vessel and put it into the oven at 325 for 90 minutes then stirred it. Then reduced the heat to 275 for an additional 90 minutes and it was cooked to perfection.
 Pro note; Don't ever add Bay leaves to anything your browning without liquid. You're just going to burn the leaves. I believe that part of the recipe is possibly an error. Just toss them into the pot in the oven.

I made this Wednesday, I omitted the rosemary(allergic to it) and thyme . added extra potatoes and carrots. This was beyond awesome and the aroma spectacular.  This recipe goes in my favorites to be made in the many winters to come.  I forgot to take a picture, next time.

This is a meal for a bowl and fork .Stew ! I was worried when the stovetop results were looking dry , as if the veggies soaked gravy all up .  But I resisted adding more liquid , put lid on & in convection oven for 2hr & 30 min. .veggies were cooked great ,there was a thick coating of gravy on everything, meat was not supper tender ....but not too bad . maybe i just had tough pack of beef stew. I would try again .  [This does not produce a gravy like for mashed pot.,this gravy simply clings to food.]

Recipe Group 1/17/2015:  I have to admit when I tasted the liquid before it went into the oven - I began to think about Plan B for dinner!  It was very bitter and all I could taste was the Guinness.  HOWEVER, after 3 hours the flavour mellowed and it came together really well. I added the potatoes at the beginning and the carrots an hour later.  The carrots were perfect but the potatoes a little overdone.  Next time I would add the potatoes later, as well.  The herbs and seasoning were delicious and the gravy was just the right consistency.  In the last hour, I did add a teaspoon of sugar and a tablespoon of tomato paste to round out the flavours.  I also found that I needed additional beef broth (but that could just be my pot and/or oven). Nice one-pot meal for a winter day!
