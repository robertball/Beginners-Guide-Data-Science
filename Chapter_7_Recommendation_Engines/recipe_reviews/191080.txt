I made this in a non-stick electric fry pan with non-stick spray. I added pepper and also used sour cream and salsa with the cheese and tomatoes. Delicious! It even reheats in the microwave nicely. One of the best ways to enjoy fresh zucchini.

I am delighted with this recipe!  I actually used it as a "starter" and added other seasonings.  I used 1 yellow squash and 1 zucchini and we added garlic, cumin, oregano, and pepper.  Topped with Monterray Jack cheese, tomato, and a bit of sour cream.  Absolutely to die for!  Great versatile recipe.

It was too different for my young sons. My husband and I really liked it. Great way to eat up squash! My son doesn't like tortillas, so he had his in taco shells. I cooked as per the recipe. When putting it in the tortillas, I added green tabasco sauce and sour cream. Really good.

This was a great recipe! Simple and scrumptious. I didn't have any fresh tomatoes so I left them off. It's simplicity allowed us to enjoy our "fresh from the garden" squash flavors to be enjoyed.  Will definitely make again.

We liked this burrito so very much.  I sauteed the sliced tomatoes with the squash, along with thinly sliced eggplant.  We also smeared sour cream on the tortilla and added some finely ground pork into the filling.  I almost ate too much, it tasted so delicious.  Easy, too.

I'm rating this for how it's written. Very versatile, and like several other reviewers said, a good start for adapting to personal taste. I added some bell pepper, a small can of green chilis, and some spices. Delicious and easy; this will get made regularly in our house, especially as the summer squash and/or zucchini start coming in soon.

Surprisingly good.  Used a combination patty pan and zucchini, extra sharp cheddar (aged), and roasted chipotle salsa.  Served with a side of refried black beans.  Will be making again, especially when we have a lot of zucchini to use!

Yum! My husband thought they tasted like fajitas, sortof. I have also tried adding in a cooked grain, and some beans would be good too.

I made it quesadila style rather than burritos and added some grilled chicken breasts to make it a little hardier and to add some protein and it just didn't work for us.  It was just so-so, needs something but I don't know what. Will move on to something else.

As other reviewers have noted, you can definitely go lots of directions with this basic recipe.  I added chick peas and baby bell peppers, as well as salsa; I only used a small amount of tomatoes and cheese.  Very healthy, and very yummy!

This burrito made me so full. It had a hearty dose of vegetables and nutrition. I made a couple of changes from the original recipe. I made two large burritos as opposed to four small ones. I used red onion and added an extra clove of garlic. Sliced green and red peppers were added to enhance color and nutrient content. I also added 2 Tbs of salsa and sour cream to compliment its flavors. I garnished using the sour cream and a few slices of jalape√±o to bring out the warmness. Very delicious and a good way to get a generous serving of vegetables.
