I entered this pie into a pie contest, never having made it before.  I won First Prize over 30 other pies! A shock, because there were many pies that were more beautiful and elaborate, but the judges raved about the flavor and the texture of the surprise sour cream filling. This is why I LOVE Allrecipe reviews! I can never lose when I look for the highly rated recipes!

I made this pie for the second time yesterday.  It was a hit last night for dessert, and even better chilled this am at the church pot luck lunch.  Both times I've made it, I wanted two pies (the pillsbury pre-packaged crusts at our grocery store come in packs of 2) This first time, I made one deep dish (in a nice ceramic pie plate), and another in a regular tin pie plate.  Doubling the recipe gave barely enough filling.  Yesterday, I used a triple recipe, and 2 nice ceramic dishes.  I tripled the filling, and the topping ingredients.  This resulted in 2 nice deep dish pies.  I did cook the pies a little longer, just adding a couple of minutes to each step to be sure the deeper pies were thoroughly cooked.  I found the recipe easy, and the end result simply perfect.  Thanks!

This was a yummy pie! While making it I realized the container I had in the fridge was plain yogurt, not sour cream! I used the yogurt, and the pie still turned out delicious! I ended up baking it at least an extra half hour after the topping was on- because I was unsure about the yogurt, and the top wasn't browning.  It didn't brown, just got crunchy, and the pie turned out great.

This is such a great pie recipe.  My only problem is that it disappears before I get to eat my share!  A couple of calories and fat can be trimmed with reduced fat sour cream.  Like many others, I reduced the sugar to one half cup, and added a sprinkle of nutmeg to the topping.  Total baking time of one hour is needed....just follow the directions and add keep it in the oven for the extra time.

This was very good.  A bit sweet for us, so I'll just reduce the sugar next time.  Also, I baked it much longer (almost 45 minutes) to get the apples really tender.  I don't like them at all firm.  A great change from regular apple pie -- definitely a keeper!

This is good stuff! One of the easiest recipe I ever made... But I think have to increase the flour to maybe 3/4 cup for it to resemble fine crumbs. Otherwise, it is great!

Nice recipe, but to sweet for my taste.  The crumb topping would be nice with some added nuts.  I made extra to fill a deep dish.  Very rich pie.  Sweezing the cumbs tight together and then breaking them up over the apples helps to have a nice chunky appearance of the crumb topping.

I have made dozens of apple pies and this is the most memorable by far. I used the $2000 Pie Crust recipe from this site for the bottom. It was the first tim I've tried a crust with an egg (I usually use the recipe in my trusty Better Homes and Gardens Cookbook for a basic pie crust). I had some issues with it falling apart, but I was able to piece it together and boy, was it worth it. It was the richest, most delicious apple pie I've ever tasted. I did use more than two cups of apples, probably more like  4 or 5. I am not afraid of raw egg (most of the time), especially when it could mean the difference between a good pie and a great pie, so I tasted the filling before baking and knew immediately I was in for real treat. Thank you so much for this recipe! One more note: Be sure to cover the edges of the pie with aluminum foil during the first half of cooking time so the crust doesn't get too brown.

Really loved it. Decided to do this after so many years of only knowing how to make pumpkin cheese cake for the holidays and I wanted to make a very non-traditional apple pie.....I increased the butter for the topping, by a teaspoon or so....other than that just really delicious and wholesome!!

DON'T EAT THIS WARM!! Who doesn't love warm apple pie with vanilla ice cream? Well...this isn't the pie for that. It is ONLY good chilled and the next day. However, it is something different than the traditional apple pie. I liked it ok but I think I will keep trying different recipes. :)

One of those desserts that taste great the day you make it, and incredible a couple days later.  I added golden raisins to the filling, slivered almonds to the crumb topping, and used reduced fat sour cream.  This pie freezes beautifully, which makes it handy to have just in case company drops by.

This pie is actually one of the best pies I have ever made. I chopped the apples a little bit bigger than I have before because I feel you don't get quite a bite if you chop them so small. I love the topping but I was just told it would be better if all the sugar was off. Eh, I don't think so. Have fun eating!

Great pie, Summer. This differs only minutely from the one submitted by Eleanor Johnson. There are fewer apples in this one and no nutmeg, but nonetheless just as delicious.Thanks for your yummy version of a great pie.

Yummy! Similar to Marie Calendar's sour cream apple pie, but the sour cream is mixed with the apples instead of layering the top. I used low fat vanilla yogurt, doubled the apples and covered the crust with foil until the last 30 minutes of baking. I used brown sugar and smart balance for topping. Definitely making it again!

I had a bunch of granny smith apples I needed to use and I found this recipe.  This was amazing!  (And I made it EXACTLY the way the recipe specifies.)  I served it to my family and while apple pie is something we all like, it has never been at the top of our pie favorites...this is no longer true.  I made it a week ago and I still am getting comments/requests for more.  Oh and the best thing of all--my husband of 23 years complimented my cooking without ANY reference to his mother's.  YAY!!!

Yummy change of pace from good old apple pie.  The crust edge did get too dark, even after covering with foil. But that filling definitely makes up for it.

The best apple pie recipe ever!  Everyone loved it and raved over the taste.  I added about 1/2 cup chopped walnuts to the topping as well.  Will definitely be in my cooking bag of tricks!

This was very good. I did add about an extra cup of apples ( 2 cups just did not look like enough..) and I think I could have even added more. Added almonds to the topping as other posters suggested- very good! WIll make it again

Even reduced to 1/2 cup sugar, the pie is too sweet. I would use at most 1/4 cup if I make this again. In the topping, I used only a scant 1/4 cup of brown sugar, and also added oats and coarsely ground walnuts. I made a graham cracker crust because I didn't have time to make and chill a regular pie crust. It tasted nice with the apples and cream. All in all, this is a nice change, but it's not going to supplant the traditional double-crusted version in my repertoire of pies.

This was the most awesome pie! I got so many compliments, and requests for the recipe the first time I made t. I used half golden delicious and half granny smith. I used more than the 2 C of apples per pie, as I had a deep dish pie crust. I used closer to 3.5 to 4 C apples total per pie, but kept everything else the same. Not too sweet at all. This one I will make again.

Oh my goodness, is this a wonderful pie! It was a bit difficult to wrap my head around the concept of it, since all I could think of was a traditional apple pie – two crusts, more spices and sliced apples. The only thing I did differently was doubled the whole recipe, made my own crust and baked it in a 10 inch pie plate. I made sure to flute the pie crust edge upwards to make it deeper. I did this just in case the filling baked high, which it does, and there wasn’t any problem in adding the crumb topping. It did not overflow nor did the crumb topping roll off into the oven. It is a make ahead pie so if you want to bake it in the afternoon to serve as dessert for that evening’s meal – it is not going to happen because the pie needs to be cooled and then thoroughly chilled. The entire pie disappeared between family and friends. Many requests for the recipe too! I used Spartan apples, as that was what I had on hand. Though I think it would taste even more scrumptious with a sharper tasting apple such as a Granny Smith. I think this would also work with rhubarb, which I shall try in the future. Thanks for a wonderful recipe – it is a definite keeper!

This is the MOST AMAZING pie we have ever eaten! I doubled the recipe for the filling and tripled the crumb topping. I knew I'd better make 2 pies so, I could enjoy some. I am so happy I did. In a word- DELICOUS!!!

I made two versions of this pie tonight. With the first one, I followed the recipe to the letter. With the second, I left out the sour cream and vanilla, and substituted them with vanilla yogurt. The pies were both great, but I liked the one with the vanilla yogurt a little more. The consistency was the same in each pie. They kind of had a baked custard element to them, which contrasted wonderfully with the crumb topping.  I used Stoneyfield Organic sour cream and vanilla yogurt, organic butter, and also Sugar in the Raw. I was also generous on the tablespoons of flour in the mix. And I let them cool for about half an hour before I taste tested. I also love how easy this pie is to make. I'm surprised someone said it wasn't pretty. I'm sure some leaves shaped from leftover pie crust dough would get it on the cover of any magazine. There's an idea for next time!  Other than maybe adding a little more apple, I wouldn't change anything else.

Made this pie for the first time for Thanksgiving.  I was very intrigued by all of the 4 star reviews and professions of love for this pie...but I can't say the same.  I made the pie exactly as the recipie states, the only change I made was to add some cinnamon & nutmeg to the filling as it seemed rather bland as written.  The pie wasn't bad...it just didn't strike me as all that special.  Tasty, but not to-die-for.  Maybe sometime I'll give it a try again, but with a dutch apple type of crumble topping.  I didn't care for the topping in this recipie as I found it got rather soggy on the second day. I might really enjoy the creamy filling with a more sturdy, crunchy topping.  It was fun to give this a try, though. I've never made an apple pie like this before.  Thanks for sharing!  :-)

a very attractive pie, and VERY tasty.  Sour cream cuts the sweet.  My husband, who is not a pie guy, really enjoyed this and thought I was very clever!

It is the perfect pie for Thanksgiving dinner, along with the traditional pumpkin pie. This recipe will be made for generations in our family.

A truly lovely pie.  I did make one major change, and I don't usually review when I've made such a big change but I think it may be helpful to people if I comment on it.  I had a half sour cream/half sweetened condensed milk mixture from another recipe.  I used that in place of the sour cream and omitted the sugar in the recipe.  It was perfect! I did have to leave the pie in for a few more minutes to get the crumble nice and crunchy.  The only down side is the pie crust along the edge got pretty dark- even though I covered it when I put the crumble in.  I will have to cover it earlier next time. Thanks again!

Yum!  Used two Granny Smith apples.  Came out excellent!  So worth waiting for it to be completely chilled.

This makes a great apple pie, everyone loves it! I've made this twice now in two weeks, and it turns out great, but I keep messing up the crumb topping.  The first time it just kind of turned to goo and laid all over the top of the pie.  It tasted good, but didn't look like it should have.  the second time, I added more flour and a handfull of oats, but that didnt work either.  Not sure how to fix that.. Btw, I am a novice cook (male).

I thought the pie was very easy to make and tasty.  I'm a big fan of warm apple pie and you really couldn't heat this one, but still good.  I'd probably make again.

This was delicious-  I did decrease the sugar to 1/2cup and added a pinch of nutmeg to the topping. I did not peel the apples either-(a great time saver.  Yummy and simple.

I made some small changes but will have to make several more changes in the future if I make this again; I added Cinnamon to the filling & upped the Cinnamon in the topping + the amount of Apples used as my mother always taught me to heap the apples so that your pie doesn't look flat after it settles (my pie was slightly above pie plate level this morning and looked beautiful, it was baked in a 10" glass pie plate). I followed the advice of chilling the pie before eating, so I refrigerated it overnight. I used tart firm baking Apples, and baked about 20 minutes longer than the direction stated, my apples were cooked through but retained their shape and had a slight bite to them which I prefer. The Sour Cream filling had a lovely texture, creamy with a slight custard consistency, however all I tasted was sour cream and would like to have some additional flavors as it muted the delicious flavor of the apples. I think I will try this again, but I will use about 8 apples (I used 10), thinly sliced, and one with a better balance of sweet/tart. I will change white sugar to Brown sugar in filling and topping + double the topping. To the filling I am going to add a bit more salt, vanilla, some nutmeg, a bit of cloves + more cinnamon (maybe a bit of Bourbon). I will also "marinate" my apples in a bit of sugar, melted butter & spices before adding to filling. The pie was not bad, and I liked the Sour cream flavor but I just need more complexity/flavor for my tastes.

This is the only apple pie my family will eat. I have made this pie for years, and then lost my recipe in a move. This is very nearly identical, and we all love it. Do splurge a little on good-quality sour cream. We've eaten this pie chilled and warm, when some people couldn't wait! It is better chilled, though.

Wonderful and so easy! I used tart apples and some tart home grown pears, WOW just right to contrast the sweetness of the pie filling. Use Granny Smith or any other tart and firm apple you wish, you will not be disapointed!

Really tasty pie, great flavor in the filling.  The topping is a little too sweet so I'll probably cut the sugar down next time--and there will be a next time.  I also would recommend wrapping the edges of the crust in tin foil before baking and serving the pie with a big glass of milk.  *Edit, 5/2002--Had to up this to five stars.  I've made it multiple times now, and had multiple requests for it.  It's so easy and so delicious.  Absolutely worth it.  Bake this pie.*

This got the non-apple pie eaters eating apple pie!  While it isn't as pretty as my classic apple pies due to the crumb topping, it makes up for it in taste and smell.  I used a total of five medium apples and low fat sour cream for the filling.  I sliced the apples thinly and then gave them a rough chop.  They came out evenly baked and saturated with the sour cream coating.  I also added a little cinnamon to the sour cream mixture.  Overall I feel that I followed the recipe pretty closely and it came out amazing!

Best apple pie ever. I actually made a mistake when making it, not knowing how it would turn out, but it didn't matter. I had some lemon juice in a bowl with the diced apples to keep them from browning, and I forgot to drain them, and put the lemon juice in the pie by mistake. It was about a tablespoon or two. So, I just added a little more dry ingredients to thicken it back up. Well, the lemon juice gave it the slightly tart taste, and it was so good and not overly sweet. I will be making this again and again...and will add lemon juice on purpose :)

This pie was AMAZING.  It was definitely a little juicy, but also crunchy and so so good.  We customized a bit and added some melted caramel drizzled on top for the last five minutes it was in the oven.  If you do this you will thank yourself.    This pie was phenomenal.  Careful on the amount of liquid you use so it doesn't get too runny, but all in all this pie was HEAVENLY.

This is one of my favorite pie recipes.  Since I just cannot seem to follow a recipe as written I had to change this one up too.  I used almond extract instead of vanilla, added sliced almonds to the topping and subbed half of the sugar in the topping with brown sugar.

Very good.  I made this pie to take to a Thanksgiving dinner while away from my home.  My Mom broke her hip and at the last minute our holiday plans changed from time with Family to kind friends in another state.  Thank Heavens for the internet and Allrecipes. This pie was easy and delic...I did add 1 more cup of apples and no leftovers were  left.  Worth a try.

this apple pie was very easy to make and turned out perfectly.  The whole pie was gone in one day.  Tasted like an apple cheesecake.

***** Yummy!!! I'm not a big pie fan, but I loved it!  I made it using a graham cracker crust.  For the topping I used brown sugar in place of the sugar & added walnuts.  Maybe I'll try it with peaches or pears next time. Thanks for a recipe that's worth making again & again.

This pie was very good. Instead of measuring 2 cups chopped apples, I added 3 finely chopped apples to the sour cream mixture. The crumble was very difficult to work with (maybe too much butter to make it a real crumble) but tasted perfect. As already mentionned, this recipe is very close to the Sour Cream Apple Pie I, and I don't really know which one I prefer...

delicious! I used 1 tsp vanilla and almost 3 cups of apples and added 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the filling. I only used 2 tbsp butter for the topping and it was perfect! rave reviews at work!

My family has been making this pie for over 40 years.  The recipe originates (for us) from a recipe included with Wrigley gum.  Wrigley was doing this in the 1960s - not sure when they discontinued the practice.  If you google Wrigley Gum and recipes you will see scans of many of the recipes.

I love this pie. I have made it multiple times and it is a hit every time! The most helpful critical review says Don't eat it warm, and that is correct. However, it states that in the directions! (allow to cool, then refrigerate before serving). While you definitely don't want to eat this straight out of the oven, it is fine at room temperature, so it doesn't have to be super cold when you do eat it. I'm making 2 more today by request! Enjoy, you won't be disappointed!

This recipe will become a family favorite! Its unique, fast & economical. I made it with only two apples. Of necessity I used 1/4 cup sour cream and 3/4 cup of plain 'Greek' yogurt. On a hunch I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon  of nutmeg and a squirt of lemon juice to the yogurt apple mix.  I will not change anything next time. The apples were cooked perfectly. (very slightly crunchy)  The pie tastes like apple pie cheesecake. Yummy ---  Just do it!!!

Thank you for sharing this and all the tips about the ice cream and tweaking the recipe. My business, God-Driven-Designs, has an upcoming event in December and we wanted to test a recipe beforehand. We're always looking for inspirational ways to create new food ideas to share with our clients. I didn't do a crumb topping with this, but might add a caramel glaze and I actually cut the sugar in half and used Pillsbury redi-bake crust that we cut into circles to make mini pies. They turned out great with a hint of cinnamon on top. We might just give these out as gifts this year!

Using the suggestion of Breakstone Sour Cream and doubling topping,  I have been making this recipe for years.   People beg for me to make it and has become a holiday tradition around here.   Simple to make, just watch your cook times.  Delicious!

I ended up using more apples than the recipe calls for because I had 2 huge apples. The pie still came out amazing. The only things that I changed was putting a little cinnamon into the sour cream/apples mixture and using some walnuts in the crumb mixture. So easy and inexpensive for such a delicious pie! Definitely a keeper!

I made this with the plan of adding a couple different or other ingredients. I used scant measures of Splenda for my sugar and I used chopped pecans instead of walnuts (although walnuts are fine, I had pecans and really like them) and I added about 1/4 cup of tart dried cherries.  They cut the sweetness quite a bit and made it one of the best pies every.  Loved it!!!! I live the creamy texture and the time was just right.  I must not have gotten the butter cut up enough and crumbly enough because some of the white topping mixture came out still white.  Easy fix? Put thin pats of butter over the white areas while still hot.  Took care of all of it!!  This is my favorite apple pie!!!

This was a good pie, but nothing spectacular.  I did take the advice of others and served cold.  I used 4 apples.  I felt like the crumble topping wasn't crumbly enough.  Probably needed more flour and sugar.

This was so easy to make.  I had some Gala Apples to use up, so I thought the sour cream would balance out the sweetness of the apples.  Boy was I right! Turned out deliciously.

Fantastic.  Made this for a work Thanksgiving potluck, and everybody raved about it.  I made it in a tart pan, which meant less exposed crust, which I prefer.

Yummy! This was my first apple pie and it came out great! I'd maybe halve the crumb topping because for me it overpowered the filling. I'd recommend using golden delicious and granny smith apples. I used light sour cream and it still tasted great. Loved the texture overall, will make again!

I love this pie! I used enough apples to fill my pie pan (much more than 2 cups) and left the amount of other filling ingredients the same. I also doubled the crumb topping because I love extra crunch. Turned out perfect!!!

Basic apple pie is better.  Wish I could rate higher.  Not worth the extra calories the sour cream adds.

Wicked good!  Used a little Pecan Maple granola in the and 1 c chopped walnuts in the crumb topping with 1/2 t of ginger, a dash of clove, and 1 t of cinnamon.   Spiked the sour cream mix with another 1/2 t of nutmeg & pored over 1 c golden raisins and 4 c of chunked Granny Smiths.  I hate it when I love my own cooking this much.  It's just not modest, but this pie, even while it is still warm, is fabulous.  I love whoever it was that originally posted this one. 'Can't wait to take one to church for Sunday-before-Thanksgiving feast. I will OWN all my sister-in-Christ's dessert contributions.  It's wrong for me to look forward to that, I know, but...

I first ate thios pie at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Restaurant in New York City about twelve years ago.  Theirs had a crumb crust with lots of walnuts, and it was an outstanding pie!  This one will be, too if you use 3 cups of Granny Snith finely sliced apples, 1 cup of sugar and walnuts in the topping.

Very tasty pie!  I was using deep dish pie plates so I doubled the filling.  I loved this creamy tasty apple pie.  Next time I might add some spices in with the apples just to suit our tastes.  But the recipe was also could as is.

I doubled the recipe to fill a deep dish pan and this pie was terrific.  I was a little disappointed that it sank a bit after cooling but I think that I can increase the apples by a few cups next time and still have an amazing pie with the same yummy results. It's a keeper!

I absolutely LOVE this pie!! I have never written a review before but I thought this recipe deserved it...  I followed the recipe exactly and I have made it ohh about 5 times I'd say now and every single person I've made it for has loved it. This is hands down one of my favorite pies.

I had this great recipe for sour cream apple pie that someone had given me years ago and lost it. Came upon this recipe and give it a try. I followed the directions pretty close but doubled it. I slightly baked the pie crust, added cinnamon to the apples and used brown sugar instead of white in the topping mixture. This filling looked runny since it had a lot of sour cream in it but the eggs helped firm the filling. Placed foil on the crust edges. It was a little tough getting the topping to sprinkle around even though I chilled it in the fridge while the pie baked. I did have to bake it another 15 minutes since I like a softer apple bite. Over all it was pretty good but wasn't as good as the recipe that I lost.

I have never baked a pie before. I made this thinking it sounded interesting. This lead to my children and I baking 12 pies for friends for Thanksgiving. I actually had frineds ordering pies..lol.. What a huge hit!!!  I added more apples than what is called for, enough to really fill the pie crust.  This is a simple, quick, delicious pie.

Very tasty. I used a sweeter apple instead of my traditional grannies and it came out great. My mother, who's not an apple fan, loved this pie.

After reading so many great reviews I expected this pie to be absolute perfection. I was pretty disappointed. The sour cream mixture made the crust and crumble very soggy. I really didn't care for the texture of the apples. I won't be trying this one again.

I followed this recipe exactly, and although it was indeed a delicious pie, I didn't think this was the best pie ever...

Update - I'm changing my rating from 4 to 5 stars. This pie gets better the longer it's refrigerated. I couldn't stop eating it!

Amazing pie. First pie I EVER made by myself! I have now made it twice. The second time, I realized too late that I didn't have sour cream, so I used a container of vanilla yogurt and a dash of French Vanilla coffee mate, and I always put lots of extra cinnamon in my mix. It came out amazing! I also use mostly brown sugar in this recipe instead of white, especially for the topping, and let it bake an extra 20 minutes. The result is a nice, crispy top and perfectly tender apples underneath. Lovely!

Took this to a dinner party and everyone loved it.  I used three Granny Smith apples which gave me about 2 1/2 cups, but there was plenty of sour cream mixture to coat and the pie deflated a bit by the time it was ready for the topping.  My topping didn't brown so I'll leave it in longer than the recommended hour next time, but the apple flavor was strong and was gently complemented by the cinnamony topping without it overwhelming the other flavors.  Great recipe!

I've been making this recipe for years.  It is my absolute favorite pie recipe.  I look forward to making it every Thanksgiving.  The only change I make is using 1 1/2 times the filling for a 9" deep dish pie.  YUM!!

I doubled the apples to 4 cups and it still turned out great.  Kept everything else the same, except used brown sugar in topping instead of white.  Thanks for a great way to use up sour cream and apples!

Slice and then chop the apples. Use flavorful apples - I used a mix of Granny Smith and Red Delicious. Use a thin pie crust. You definitely want to refrigerate this pie before eating. Very, very good!  Next time, I'll put chopped walnuts in the topping, like a local restaurant does.

great recipe, I've been making sour cream apple for years, and used this version the last time I made it.  I add walnuts to the topping, really good addition!  The last time I made it, I gave out slices to the doctor and nurse I work for, and they both raved and raved!  I'm making it again, at the doc's request, and writing down the recipe so he can make it at home.

Excellent, and easy to make; a major hit with the family.  My only addition was a pinch of cloves to the crumb topping for a little extra flavor.

Wow, what a stunner! Very pretty pie. And super simple, too. I made the Flaky Butter Crust from this site last night and let it sit in the fridge overnight. I did add a little nutmeg to the pie filling and topping, I made no other changes. I did fold the crust over the top of the pie, only because I just can't make the edges look right, no matter how I try. Smells amazing, tastes even better. I agree with the recipe submitter that using a quality sour cream is key. I'll make this again, definitely. I don't know that I liked white sugar in the topping, I think next time, I might try brown. I think that might come out with a more crisp-like topping, which I prefer. That's a personal preferance, not the recipe's issue. NOTE: Instructions didn't advise to prick the crust, I did this. After having some leftover from the first day and then refrigerating the leftovers, it's just not as good after sticking it in the fridge. I found the filling to be more quite a bit more solid than I normally like in a pie, almost bread-pudding like. There was no "sauce" inside the pie like you would normally get with an apple pie. If you like a saucier pie, make sure that you eat this all in one sitting with your family or find a different recipe.

I used just one large Gala apple, which was just enough for my store-bought crust.  This is really, really good.  It's so rich, it's almost like eating an apple cheesecake.

very good. I made homemade crust for this pie and everything turned out wonderful. I was skeptical of the flavor with sour cream, but was pleasantly surprised.

I made this one day to make something different. My 7 year old granddaughter got a pen and paper so I could give her the recipe. It will now be a regular dessert at my house thank you.

I was very pleased at how great this pie turned out and the simplicity. I am always nervous to make any sort of apple pie. If you are the same, this recipe will work out great for you! Next time, I will cut back a bit on the butter for the crumb topping, it made it a little too soggy and didn't crisp well enough. I also add a dash of cinnamon to the sour  cream mixture. All the adjustments people have written in the comments are unecessary, this recipe is pretty darn good as written!

This is a nice twist on apple pie.  I used a store bought crust but I found that the exposed crust browned way too fast.  Even after covering it I found that it was too gross to eat.  That being said the pie itself was great!

I LOVE THIS. Rave reviews. I use 3 cups of apples (granny smith) for a deep dish pie crust. Use 2/3 C flour and 1/3 C butter in topping and came out AMAZING. thanks!

Love this recipe! I always double it so I can use the whole container of sour cream, plus every one always finished one so fast! I cut out 1/3 cup of sugar though. And the "15 minutes to brown" always takes a little bit longer for me - maybe 5 more minutes. Love the streusel topping sooo much. I was looking for a pie that used streusel because I always find double crusts so filling. Ever since I found this recipe a few years ago, every one always asks for it!

This pie is TO DIE FOR!!!! My husband is not a fan for pies, especially apple ones.... But this pie is his absolute favorite dessert! He asks me to make it everyday (not that I make it for him that often)! 
Anyway, I did a whole stick of butter for the topping. And it turned out crunchy like a praline topping!! Absolutely fabulous!!!

this pie is so yummy!  My husband loves it and he is not a huge fan of deserts but this does not last more than 2 days in my house!  The recipe is so wonderful because you can make with many different fruits, I made one today with about 2 1/2 cups of fresh blueberries instead of apples and it is delicious.  The recipe is a kepper!

My husband's words, "this is your best pie ever", however I did make some changes, only used 2 T of sugar as I like a tartness to my apple pies, and also added lemon zest and cinnamon to the apple mixture.  This pie sets up so well.  I used lite sour cream. It's a keeper.

This pie was much too sweet, and I was expecting something creamier.  Instead, it was like a chunky custard that had too much sugar in it.  If I were to make it again, I would have less sugar, no cinnamon in the topping, and might not bake it for too long, maybe cook the apples first.   I really had high hopes for the pie.

This was not a popular recipe for my family.  The biggest complaint was that after the pie cooled the liquid of the sour cream started to separate making the crust all soggy.  As well, the creaminess of the sour cream makes the pie taste more like an apple custard which lessens the flavours of the spices.  I think I'll stick to traditional apple pie.

Scrumptious Pie!  I taught a pie baking class last night and made this recipe.  They devoured it in seconds!  I changed absolutely nothing.  Thanks for the tip on quality sour cream, I do think it made a difference in the finished product.  I liked how the pie kept it's shape after being sliced and served.  Not only was it a tasty pie, but pretty too!

Looked/smelled wonderful and I also had the problem of it falling and part of the top stayed up but part fell/cracked.  I think I used too big of a pie pan maybe?!  Otherwise good taste just would use more spices next time.

tHOUGHT THIS RECIPE WAS VERY GOOD KEPT IT WITH THE BASICS BUT ADDED BROWN SUGAR INSTEAD OF USING THE WHITE. ALSO ADDED SOME NUTMEG AND CINNAMON TO THE MIXTURE YOU COAT THE APPLES WITH AND USED A STORE BOUGHT APPLE CRISP TOPPING INSTEAD OF MAKING MY OWN. CAME OUT DELICIOUS WAS WONDERFUL WITH CARAMEL ICE CREAM ON TOP.... yummmmm!!!

A great recipe, though I found myself making about twice the amount of the topping.

This is one of my go to desserts when I’m in need of one. I use canned apples and then less sugar in the filling. Absolutely a winner and no one has ever commented that the apples were canned!

Really good!  It probably IS a little too sweet (not for me, but my husband will probably say it is), and the crumble on top needs a bit more 'body', so I'll have to play with that - but otherwise, wonderful!  Next time, I also need to do something with the top of the crust around the pie plate (flute and cover with foil so it doesn't over-brown).  Will be making again!

Very tasty but be careful not to over work the butter in the crumble topping or it turns kind of pasty. It's still okay but it's better when it maintains proper texture.

I didn't like the coffee-cake-like topping and the pie itself was okay. I guess my expectation was too high.  But my hubby loved it, so 4 stars.

It was awesome recipe just as written.  However, I used twice the amount of apples and no other changes.Still fit well in a 9 inch pan.  My guest raved over it. Ill be making again for sure.

I changed the topping a little. I added whole oats... to give it more of the crumbliest favorite part usually of an apple pie. Until this pie... I came to the pearly gates when I tasted this pie. Heaven Pie is what we now call this!

I made this pie almost exactly as the recipe is written, & It was delicious! I did add some cinnamon and nutmeg to the filling. I think next time I am going to cut some of the sugar and add an extra apple to the filling, & double the crumb topping.

This is such an easy pie and completely delectable.  A really nice  and unexpected change from a regular apple pie. I used Granny Smith apples and regular (not light) sour cream which worked beautifully. I made a double batch of filling and topping to take two pies to Thanksgiving dinner at a relatives' home and the pie was loved by all. I took other reviewers suggestions and baked the pies the day before and so the pie was well-chilled upon serving.

I made this and my husband loved it!  He loves apple pie but said this is even better than a traditional Apple pie.  The only change I made was to the topping.  Per others suggestions, I used brown sugar instead of white, which carmelized better than white sugar.

Love this recipe. I have made it two years in a row now, and it's always a hit! I like to use a pre-made graham cracker pie crust. It makes prep much easier and tastws fantastic! It is a definitely better the next day, so make sure you make it ahead of time, (or make two pies so you have leftovers!). The crumb topping is best when you thoroughly mix it to get the "crumb" texture. Spend a little time on this and the topping will crisp up nicely.

The filling was delicious but we all agreed the crumb topping was too sweet.
The next time I make it I'll use a traditional two crust pie. That should cut down on the sweetness.

Made it just as it said and I would agree with other reviews, it's much better COLD. Pretty tasty, my family ate it all up but I think the sour cream kind of overwhelmed the apple flavor.

This recipe was EASY and absolutely delicious! I used a combo of Honey Crisp, Braenburn and Granny Smith apples, sliced thinly so they would cook evenly and quickly. Used a pre bought crust and a bit more cinnamon. The sour cream adds a flavor demention that we LOVED!!This pie recipe ROCKS AS IS!!  it will blow your doors off if you let it refrigerate overnight, that is a must!!  We made 2 pies and tried pieces out warm, room temp and cold... Cold won out every time!!  I liked that it sliced beautifully without running all over the plate, so it looks gorgeous when served!!

I have been making this pie for years, my family loves it. It is wonderful eaten hot from the oven, and if there is any left over, eaten cold the next day. It is like two different pies. In the summer I add half a cup of fresh blackberries.

Thank you for this recipe!  I made it exactly written, except I added chopped pecans to the crumb topping.  I do not normally make pies because I just don't care for them too much, but this is definitely a keeper!  Will make again and again!

This has a wonderful flavor!  Since I could not understand why the recipe only called for 2 cups apples, which seemed very sparse and stingy to me, I used 6 apples (the usual for a nice apple pie in my mind). The pie shell was not over-full.   As a result and my oven, I baked it for 15 min longer than called for.  The apples were tender/crisp, a wonderful, fresh, delectable and completely unintended texture which I will strive in the future to reproduce, because my husband absolutely went wild over it.  Serendipity, not skill, sometimes makes small miracles.

Scrumptious!  I  have made this many times.  I  use more apples,  and I double the filling  except for the sugar  which depends on the tartness of the apples I use.   This way I get 2 pies, one of which I freeze for later.

This is a pie you need to make a day in advance and serve chilled. The flavors really come through the second day. My family liked this so much they wouldn't let me share a slice with the neighbor!

Best pie I have ever tried and made,except for when I substitute the apples for blue berries.  Even frozen blueberries are really good.  I wasn't  sure about the crisp top with blue berries but I and other really enjoy it.

As advised we did not make the mistake of trying this warm... That being said this pie is unlike any apple pie I have ever eaten. It took me a bit to get over the texture. It is good if you are looking to get away from the normal apple pie.  My husband wasnt immediatly crazy about it either but this pie kinda grows on you by slice 2 or 3...

WOW! Made it as healthy as possible by using Splenda instead of sugar, egg-beaters for the eggs,a mixture of splenda and brown sugar splenda for the topping and a quality fat-free sour cream. Used 1 and a half times the ingredients for the filling and 2-granny smith and 1-golden delicious apples. 
Easy to make and will definitely make this a holiday favorite.

It's really really good! Maybe a little bit too sweet for my taste, but I'll surely try it again with more apples and less sugar.

I have in fact tried this recipe. Ive been making it for over 20 years so you would think I had it commited to memory. Not the case. I was all ready to prepare it for Thanksgiving 2012 and could not find my recipe. This recipe was handed down from my elders and they are no longer around...it ended with me. So I was desperate to find it. This is as close as I've found with a few tweeks. I'm going to have to teach it to my daughters this year!

Very different kind of apple pie recipe, but my family loved it!!  I didn't mention the sour cream part because my family is not very fond of it, but after tasting it I broke the news to them and they were in disbelief LoL I loved that this was a simple recipe.. I already had everything except for the sour cream.. The only thing I would do differently, is maybe added more apples next time.. Other than that, loved it!

Made this last night for a potluck today.  I love it it will be one on my new faves.  I did dubble the apples and the topping only because my pie pan was a deep pan, but really I didn't need to.  It would have been fine the way the recipe call for.  Thank you for this Recipe

Overall I thought this was VERY addictive!!  Alterations I made, reduced the pie sugar to 1/4 c (from 3/4 c), reduced the topping sugar to 1/4 c (from 1/3 c), added 1/4 c oats (that I ground in a food processor) in the topping.  And I used fresh Pippin apples with the skins on.
Otherwise, followed the recipe!

Good!  Like others, I reduced the sugar in the filling to 1/2 cup.  I also used 4 cups of unpeeled apples sliced in the food processor (3 apples).  It was very tasy, but can't beat the Apple Cranberry Pie I from this site.

This pie tasted just like the pie that my mom used to make growing up.  It was delicious!  I got so many compliments on it.  My one suggestion would be to use a deep pie dish because it yields a lot but oh so yummy!

As a non-baker, this pie is very easy to make. When I started making it 3 yrs. ago I think I messed it up once, but once I got the hang of it, there is no other apple pie for me. I actually have to 'lose' this recipe periodically as eating 1/4 of a pie a night CAN'T be good for you.....

This pie was WONDERFUL... I added a little more apple then it called for and added cinnamon to the filling.....  My daughter does not like to try things new.. When she first saw Sour Cream in the title.. she stated she was not having any... Well, after dinner she tried a small bite.. went back for a HUGE slice and then my three children argued over who was getting the last slice..  My oldest who has been a die hard Pumpkin Pie fanatic has not declared the 'BEST' pie in the world. They all then declared I needed to make 4 of these pies for Thanksgiving.. one for each of them and one for everyone else to share....  This pie was so quick to put together....... :o)

The pie is delicious however it is not an attractive looking pie. I made one with white sugar and one with half brown sugar in crumb topping with color remaining the same dark brown. It doesn't rise and almost look like one just sprinkled brown sugar over it with some drizzled butter. Tasty dessert but not a "wow" looking pie if you mean to impress your dinner guests.

We liked this fine, but we didn't love it. I followed recipe exactly and thought the end result was a little bland, not quite like an apple pie but didn't have much of a sour cream flavor either.

The pie was decent but I honestly don't see how it is prize winning. Flavor was quite bland and the texture was just as dull. Not terrible though. I would recommend just making regular apple pie or my personal favorite Grandme's Apple Crisp.

I chose this pie to be the 1st HOMEMADE pie that I ever make. I even made the crust (from a different recipe). It was so delicious. My family was scared to eat it, but ended up LOVING it!

I combined this recipe with Puff Pastry Apple Raisin Streudel recipe on Food Network and has spectacular results.  I use frozen pie shell unrolled in heavy cake pan -sour cream is key! tried it both ways-golden raisins are key as well.  added all pie crust (uncooked) and placed brown sugar and white sugar and butter crumb topping on top. this was fantastic-people beg for this dessert.

So good and easy!  I substituted the topping for a store-bought apple crisp topping (with oats and such) that I cut in with butter according to this recipe's directions.  Wonderful shortcut.

I loved this and so did my kids & hubby. I thought it was a great change from the ordinary apple pie. Made as written, no changes.

This is a very good pie!  I've made it a few times now and I like to change it up by adding almond extract instead of vanilla, brown sugar (in the topping) and sprinkle some sliced almonds with the topping.

I had some apples left over from the orchard that were getting close to going bad and I wanted to use them up.  I followed the recipe exactly.  It was excellent even with a store bought crust!

This recipe is so good that our friend, who claims to dislike apple pie, liked this one so much that he asked for a second piece.  We've even decided to forgo the traditional pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving and serve this instead.  Now to find a crust recipe that's up to snuff...

Everybody loved this! Even my dad who is not a fan of apple pie. Another guest, who loves apple pie, wanted bigger apple pieces. Guess I'll have to adjust depending on the guest :)

Everyone loved this pie. I made 4 of them over the last week for two Sunday brunches. I used more apples than called for about 3 cups or so. I always use both Granny Smith and Golden Delicious in my apple pies. I made two pies and trippled the topping recipe. I used brown sugar for that and added about a cup of chopped pecans to the topping for one of them. I hadn't ever made Sour Cream Apple pies but now will incorporate this recipe into my regualr baking. Thanks!

MMMmmmm!!! So good! I got a little nervous when pouring it into my crust because it was very 'soupy' but it baked perfectly! I even baked one, let it cool, and froze it. I just baked that one last night for company and it was just as delicious! Only thing I added was walnuts...something different! YUMMY! I will always make this recipe for apple pie!! Thanks Phebesue75!!

This was a fantastic recipe and a hit at our Thanksgiving dinner!! Everyone wanted seconds! I did made the crumb topping with Brown Sugar(I always use Brown Sugar as it gives a more rich flavor), and cut the Cinnamon down to 1/2 teaspoon. I am glad I found this recipe and have added it my favorites.

This really is a great pie. Second time I made it, I changed up the fruit. Used half the apples and added cranberries and blueberries. I added cinnamon and nutmeg to the sour cream mixture and cinnamon & oatmeal to the crumb mixture.

Not only was it incredibly easy to make, it was perfect in terms of taste and ingredients that were needed because we had a whole container full of sour cream that we needed to use and it worked out thanks to this recipe. We also had fresh apples to bake this with! I can't believe there was such perfect recipe, thank you!! Definitely going to make again. I really enjoyed the simple, yet flavor-and-sweetness-bursting flavor in the topping. The sweetness was perfect, the texture was great combining the sweet crumbles of toppings with the moist fresh apple innings, and overall, it's an A++ recipe! Thanks for sharing it with us!

i'm giving it a 5 because i altered the recipe and maybe if i followed it exactly it would have tasted even better. i doubled the amount of apples and sour cream and it was too sour cream-y, but the flavor was still excellent and i will not double the sour cream next time. oh i also doubled the topping which is a must! i added some quick oats to the topping and it gave it a delicious added crunch!

The recipe was great, but like others, I revised it a bit; I added nutmeg and oats so the top of the pie was more of a crumble.
***I made this again for the second time the other day and changed my rating from 4 to 5 - I forgot just how good this pie is!!! I love adding the oat topping during the last couple of minutes for a bit of extra crunch and flavour.

Very good apple pie recipe. Used Never Fail Pie Crust II with it and husband couldn't stop eating pie. Glad I tried it. Taste was excellent. Used less sugar and 1/2 egg. Needed other 1/2 for crust. Came out fine.

First time I ever made a pie and it was outstanding!!  Was low on white sugar so I substituted half with brown sugar.  Used a mix of Spartan and Courtland apples.  Everyone was surprised that there was sour cream in it...a definite keeper!

FANTASTIC!! Loved it! I was hesitant to make it because we are really traditional pie lovers. I am so glad I finally gave in and tried it. My hard to please husband loved it too and can't wait until I make another one. These are the subtle changes I made: I substituted maple syrup for the sugar as I always do to make it a little healthier. And I reduced the amount of maple syrup to 1/2 cup. Next time I will try 1/3 cup as it was still a tad to sweet for us. I also added about a 1/2 cup more apples and just a little more cinnamon (we like cinnamon). Other than that everything else was the same. Delish!

I was going to make a regular apple pie but only had enough flour for the bottom crust, so I found this recipe. I am glad I did because my husband said that this was the best apple pie he has ever eaten!! A keeper for sure.

so easy and so good!  People kept asking if I had really made it.  They thought I bought it.  Delicious.  Will definitely make again.  I didn't make any changes.

this was soooo good! reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup, it's the perfect level of sweet that way. i also added some cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice to the batter.

I love this pie! Made it at home using fresh pears, then made a couple pies at work and they loved it also. Have made it again at home and wanted to mention a mistake I made, had my mind elsewhere and I added the topping to the pie when I was putting it into the oven to begin baking. When I realised what I'd done I was worried it would ruin the pie but it actually turned out better, the topping blended into the sourcream filling and was a rich brown color but did not burn so I think from now on I will just put the topping on at the beginning. Next time I made it I'm going to use blueberries and thinking it would also be very tasty with strawberries.

2 cups is not nearly enough apples! I needed over 4 cups for my pie plate. All other measurements stayed the same. I like the taste alot. Nice and creamy. Might try it with peaches next time.

it's certainly good and I liked the sour cream idea. didn't come out as an applecheesecake as I was expecting, though... the custard part was thin for me: maybe should try with more apples.

This is a wonderful recipe and gets raves in my household everytime I make it. I add 1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg to the filling, giving it more flavor. Cuddos to the author!!!

I took this to Thanksgiving dinner.  It was good, but people didn't rave about it or ask for the recipe.  It is a nice change.  I followed other reviewers and used 1/2 cup sugar.

I have made this two times this week and have been told by 5 different people it is the "best apple pie they have ever eaten". The only change I made was to cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup instead of 3/4. Thanks for the great recipe. My husband just called from work to request this again tonight!

I think this was the best apple pie I have ever had. I added some chopped hazelnuts to the topping just because I had them and at $12 a pound I wanted to use them up.

This pie recipe has been made in my family for decades. Don't know why I didn't see it on site before, I have always looked for it in cookbooks etc. and have never seen it published before. I got out my recipe to compare and the only difference is cinnamon (we use 1 T.). Lots of times I use can of Comstock sliced apples (not pie filling or you would definately need to reduce or cut out sugar). Also, use pastry blender for topping- make crumb-like when butter is not entirely soft. Only bake at 350 for 40 min. then additional 15 for topping. Debate within family whether pie is best warm or cold.

this is very easy n tasty! i reduced the sugar to 3 tbsp and it still came out sweet. the crust should be baked first for at least 15mins before pouring the grannysmith apple mixture to ensure that the bottom crust is fully baked(:

Delicious pie!  My family gobbled it down.  I took the suggestion of adding a little less sugar and the pie still turned out plenty sweet.  Will definitely make this recipe again.

This recipe was awesome!  Very delicious and easy to make.  Next time I would just add a little more spice such as cinnamon to the pie mixture.  Other than that, it was perfect!!

This recipe is great adn easy to make. I actually made my own pie crust, using a recipe from the site "french pastry pie crust" and it turns out really flaky, just like those in the bakery. Will make this again but maybe with a regular or lattice pie top cause the crumbles are a little messy when you are serving to the children. Really good with vanilla ice cream.....

Excellent flavor.  Love the creaminess of the sour cream versus the tartness of the apples.  The topping is sweet and buttery rich.

I won the hearts of my future in-laws with this pie when I first met them. They were more than happy to welcome me into the family, so long as I brought this recipe. hahahaha.  If you need a go-to dish that you can make easily and impress people, this is it!

This is not your traditional pie so I was skeptical, yet pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted with the sour cream.  I love spices so I ended up adding a few things cinamon and cloves to pie filling and replaced the top with brown sugar, cinamon, cloves, flour, butter, and crushed Nilla wafers.

Pies tasted and smelled great-they caved in a little when cooling which made the topping crack and were a little time consuming with the baking. Thanks for recipe!

DEEEELICIOUS and EASY!! Everything about this pie is sooo good! I used canned apple pie filling (didn't have fresh apples on hand), and cut back the sugar to about 1/3 cup because of the sugar already in the pie filling. Everything else I followed exactly. It was easy and EVERYONE absolutely LOVED it! Even my picky roommates who don't eat sweets loved it.

I asked my boyfriend to describe this pie in two words: "mind blowing".  I would have to say I was also pretty impressed as well! A lovely twist on an old favorite.  I like that it only uses a couple apples and you aren't coring and chopping forever. I will probably make this again very soon.

I love sour cream apple pies!  I cook the apple and lightly mash them before adding them into the pie mix.  I find this helps make the pie smoother.  I also add a bit of fresh grated nutmeg to both the filling & the topping.  YUM
