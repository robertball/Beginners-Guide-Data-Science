Yes Lord!! Okay so first off, my daughter and I have recently discovered that we are both gluten AND dairy intolerant. We've been trying to find recipies that can be tailored to our diet. This recipie exceeding surpassed our expectations! We switched the all-purpose flour for Pillsburry's multi-purpose gluten free flour and the melted butter with melted coconut oil. This tasted so completely like actual pancakes, if my daughter hadn't have made theses herself, I simply wouldn't have believed it! In fact I'm pretty sure I can feed it to the rest of my "normal" eating family and they wouldn't be any the wiser. We thought this was HUGE to share! Will be making these again and thank you so so much for this awesome recipie!!

pretty good. I used whole wheat flour since it is a bit healthier and added a bit of vanilla as the other commenters suggested. they have a different taste than classic pancakes, but they were really good. I'll make them again.

its a great recipe. I added the vanilla extract as others suggested and it turned out delicious. it has a little coconut taste to it which I like, this pancakes are very fluffy and yummy! can be easily a non-dairy recipe if you eliminate the butter and substitute it for the coconut milk.

Rave reviews from the family.  The coconut milk does not add a coconut flavour but gives them a lovely light and fluffy texture.

This was basically the same as the recipe we found on Allrecipes using milk and vinegar, which we've enjoyed for several years. One of our children is trying to go milk-free, so I made this without telling anyone and they actually commented on how good they were! I used margarine instead of butter, added 1 tsp vanilla and some frozen blueberries - awesome! Thanks.

I’ve made these twice now, tripled the batch each time. The first time I added vanilla, used canned coconut cream, and ripe bananas.. and they were bomb. The second time I didn’t have enough coconut milk for a triple batch and split with water... the vinegar was a bit much this way. My kids won’t eat them, but I think it’s partially due to the harshness of the Braggs Apple Cider vinegar I used. If I need to split with water in the future I’ll cut back on the vinegar.

Great recipe as suggested I added vanilla extract. Also used honey instead of sugar as half whole wheat to try to make it healthier. Delicious!

Perfect recipe for pancakes if you don't have regular milk. I used almond milk since I didn't have the coconut and they still came out great. Super fluffy! Next time I make them I may add some flavor enhancements, but this is a perfect base recipe.

This recipe is fool proof. I have made it with flax egg substitute, I have used the canned coconut milk just the thick that rises to the top and mixed the milk. Wonderful very fluffy pancakes. They are good with syrup or just peanut butter. 1 recipe makes 6 or 7 thick pancakes. Perfect breakfast with everything already in the pantry.

Wow - very light, fluffy and I doubled the recipe and it made 12-14 medium size cakes. Also added some real coconut flakes (added dry) and no sugar, used honey (added wet to equal the added dry) and they were awesome. My fussy husband was impressed. Served with fruit and juice. You could serve a meat on the side but we are cutting down. Highly recommended, healthier pancake. Tip: don't pour on syrup (and use only maple syrup-costs more but well worth it), put some on the side and dip - they say you'll use less because it doesn't soak into the cakes.

I make pancakes every weekend in my house at my daughters' request... we know a good pancake recipe qhen we try one. My wife is allergic to dairy and so I resort to this recipe so we can all have a pancake feast together. This recipe is great and do the the dairy allergy I substitute the butter for vegetable oil; we all appreciate this recipe very much!
