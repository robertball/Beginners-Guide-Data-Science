The stew was great! What I did was: I made a mixture of flour (about a cup) and rosemary (a Tablespoon or so) and rolled the cubes of meat in it before I started to cook them. Then, instead of shortening, I used butter as I had no shortening on hand. I also added more onion, used 6 or 7 regular carrots that I cut up instead of the baby carrots, and cut the potatoes a bit smaller than called for. Other than those (minor) changes, I followed the recipe to a "Tee". It was great, but next time, I might try using more vegetables: maybe some chopped up tomatoes and peas to make it a little heartier. A great base for a beef stew though! :)

Delicious. I did not use the vegetable shortening or the butter. It came out perfect and the whole pan of soup was eaten in one night since my family liked ti so much.

My boyfriend and I decided to make this for dinner tonight. This is an excellent base recipe for stew. We wanted to experiment with the cooking technique which resulted in slightly over-cooked beef, which was our own fault, however we both agreed the flavors of the "broth" were delicious as well as the veggies. The only other thing we did differently was add a little cornstarch to thicken it up a bit, but that's just our personal taste. We will definitely make this again but next time we are going to slow cook it and see how that comes out. Over-all, a good, simple recipe.

This was fantastic.  I cooked it in the crockpot.  For the first half (meat, broth, onions, etc), I cooked on low for about 4 hrs. Then I chopped up veggies and cooked them in butter in a skillet until about half cooked and then added them to the crockpot (turned it up to high). The only thing different is that I added peas and mushrooms.  I also added several spices to bump up the flavor a bit at the end. I didn't add salt earlier because the broth has a lot in it and I wanted to wait to see if it needed more. The spices I added later were: salt, pepper, paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, a little cayenne, celery seed, oregano & basil.  Finally, I thickened the broth a bit by putting flour and water in a jar with a lid, shaking vigorously until there were no lumps and then putting into broth.  I let it simmer several minutes until the flour cooked.  It was great and I will make it again.

The only alteration for me was to brown my meat in Olive Oil. This is a great, fairly quick Beef Stew. Even my picky eaters loved it. Serve it with warm French Bread and your meal is complete.

It was good! I read the reviews, and I also dredged the meat in flour, salt and pepper before brownin, and I did not drain it. I used whole carrots instead of baby carrots.

This turned out delicious. There were no issues, except I forgot the Bay Leaves but still delicious. I did use though Stir-Fry sliced style beef and just cut it in to smaller pieces-! Thank you.

Excellent and easy recipe.  I used 4/3 lb of meat, 1qt  of turkey stock and added a cup of red wine,mushrooms, thyme and parsley and left out celery, which I did not have on hand.  I also cut back on the "fat", using about 1Tbs of oil to brown the meat; there was no need to drain excess "fat". My daughter also loved it.

I did not follow quantities exactly, this seems to be a very forgiving recipe.  I will want to make it again

Delicious and super easy!  The only difference I made was to use about 1 TBS  bacon drippings to brown the meat and onion in.  Also, I did not dredge the meat in flour.  Its unnecessary when all you need to do is sprinkle the flour and seasonings on top of the meat as it begins to brown and then stir the meat to coat the pieces.   Then I added all of the other ingredients (including the raw vegetables) and let it all simmer for a few hours. Finally, I thickened up the stew with a slurry of cornstarch at the end because we like our stew on the thicker side (but that is a preference and doesn't alter taste).  I would suggest tasting the "broth" half way through cooking it to add any additional pepper, salt, or even bouillon to your own taste (everyone has a different palate).   Also, this recipe readily handles additional vegetable as well (corn, green beans, pearl onions, etc). Thank you for the submission as I have tried other Beef Stew recipes on this site with less than great tasting results.

Excellent.  I added a little kitchen bouquet for flavor and a richer color.  Started recipe as listed and finished off in a slow cooker for six hours on low.   Meat and veggies very tender.  Thickened broth at end of cooking with a water and flour mix to make a thicker gravy.

I was trying to use up some leftover steak from the cookout this past weekend with a new recipe. So, this was my only alteration. Tasted just like my normal beef stew.  Very good! My daughter has asked me to bring her some more to work tomorrow.
