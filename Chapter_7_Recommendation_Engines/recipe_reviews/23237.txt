Pretty good recipe. I had to add much more Worchestershire and hot sauce than the recipe specifies. Otherwise, good and easy to make.

While preparing for this recipe, I realized (to my dismay) that I had bought low-fat cream cheese AND I was out of mayo.  However, I continued this recipe despite my little "roadblocks." To my surprise, this still turned out excellent! The low-fat version did not compromise the taste, no one noticed the lack of 3 TBLS of mayo and it held together fine. It also tasted excellent when served over crackers.  I will be making this again...I'll try it with the mayo to see if there is additional improvement but we all thought it was great the first time around!

This is the best cheese ball I have ever had.  I made it for my bunco group and they just loved it. There was so much that I made two balls and brought the second to work the next day.  It was a hit twice

Did not like this recipe at all when first made, even though ingredients looked great.  Thought it a failure even with the addition of extra hot sauce  and Worcestershire as recommended.  Fortunately though I had made this a couple of days ahead and by the time I served it, it got rave reviews.  Guess it's like leftovers, they often improve with time.

It was ok.  Rather bland - needed additional spices.  I will try this again, making several additions.

This was delicious! I added more bacon and more green onions. It was a real hit at our Thanksgiving dinner where I am usually in charge of appetizers.

This was very popular amongst my guests.  At first I was kind of nervous that forming the logs and rolling in the pecans would be difficult and messy, but it was actually extremely easy!  It makes plenty.

This cheese ball was so good!  I actually made 4 of them for a football party...I did add some dried dill, just to give a little more flavor, turned out so tasty.  They were gone in no time.

I tried this recipe at thanksgiving. It was such a huge hit, that I have made at least 5 more of them since. I also made it once for a friend to take to a christmas party. Everyone requested the recipe from me. It really is so simple and it taste terrific. I made it once without the bacon, I really missed it!. Terrific!

Very good and easy, I used already cooked bacon, just cooked it a little in the microwave to make it crispy enough to crumble into mix.

Very yummy. I've made it several times now and it has been very popular.  The green onions and bacon give it an exceptionally good flavor.

This is a crowd pleaser. I usually omit the pecans and serve as a spread on crackers or rolled up in tortillas.

I made this as an appetizer for Christmas, and my guests liked it, but there was a lot left. I wasn't that crazy about the nuts on the outside. I think I would make it again, minus the nuts. I used a mature white Irish cheddar.

I would give this 4 1/2 stars--it's pretty good and I'm not a big fan of the cheeseball.  I made it per the recipe, then added a few more dashes of hot sauce, more bacon :) and a shot of pepper.  Hubby and sons really enjoyed.  Thanks!

This was great!  I made it for a party this weekend and was a hit!  To quote my husband, "That was a great cheese ball you made!  I think that was the best one I had ever had, and I like cheeseballs!"

Very good and easy to make.  I read the earlier reviews and increased the Worcestershire, hot pepper sauce, bacon and green onions.  I also halved the recipe to make just one log and it turned out fine.

This was fantastic!  It was a huge hit at our Christmas party.  I doubled the hot pepper sauce and worcestershire sauce as someone suggested.  Plus, I probably added a little more bacon and onion then the recipe called for.  This recipe is certainly a keeper!

This is such a hit that I have made it many times already.  Everybody just raves about it and asks for the recipe!  I double the worstershire and hot sauce - I think it makes it even tastier.

Very easy and tasty! Will be gone in no time.  Should let log/ball come to room temp. when serving to make more "spreadable".

I made this recipe for my daughter's graduation open house,  and got many requests for the recipe.    It was very easy to make.   I doubled the hot sauce, however.    Very good recipe.

This was really good.  I brought it as an appetizer for my scrapbooking group and it was gone before the night was over.

very good.  first time making a log, i shaped it into a ball actually, and I used walnuts because that is what I had.  My guest loved it and I had to give out the recipe.  Thanks.

Yummy cheese ball I doubled the bacon and really think it could even use some more. Or maybe the next time I make it I'll use little packets of ham like my other recipe uses. I did use sharp cheddar cause I like the extra bite. Considered doubling but glad I didn't since it made a pretty big cheeseball. One of our guests asked to take the leftovers home so obviously it was liked!

This is great. The bacon adds just the extra touch.

Very good. I didn't have any bacon, so I used a can of tuna.  It was still good.  Would make again.

I made this for a party on New Years Eve, it was such a hit! I made it as a ball, and it was enormous! Everyone raved about it, I've had 3 people call since then for the recipe. The only changes I made were doubling the worcestshire and hot pepper sauce. Definately a keeper!

Our family loved this recipe!  Each time we make it, people ask for the recipe. It's suprisingly easy, and is now one of our favorites.

Took this to a Mom's meeting last night and came home with an empty plate. Everyone loved it. I made it in the morning and let sit for the day. The flavors blended wonderfully. Make it, eat it, enjoy it.
