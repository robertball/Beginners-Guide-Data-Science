I made this because my fiance loves squid but wanted to try something different.  I was going to use tin foil instead of the banana leaf, but I realized that we had one of those trees in our back yard!   

The next time I make this I will watch carefully the cooking time and NOT cover the grill (I overcooked this batch, cooking 15 mins with lid on).  I will also use 1/2 the cumin.  But otherwise this is a very good recipe and I can't wait to try it again!

This recipe is terrific - we've tried it on salmon & trout. We made it for friends who said it was the best fish they've ever eaten.

I used dory fish. I do not if it was because I used fish instead of squid but it was way too salty. The belachan was overwhelming.

I really really enjoyed this however as written I felt the squid got overcooked and here is my opinion as to why. The acid in fresh lime juice "cooks" seafood. After 2 hours in the lime juice, my squid were near done and so the 15 minutes on the grill was just too much. However, you really need the 15 minutes on the grill to get that nice banana leaf flavor to come out and that flavor really does play a big part in the overall dish. I recommend leaving the lime juice out of the marinade altogether and then fresh squeeze it over the finished dish. There are a lot of different flavors going on in this but they work together nicely and the outcome is amazing.  I already cannot wait to try this again using shrimp and other various seafood but I will be sure to save the lime juice for the end. This is a great recipe and I highly recommend it!
