This is a fantastic recipe (if you like crunchy PB cookies)!   They had a slight baking soda taste so I would recommend cutting back to about 1/3 tsp.  Also I would recommend sifting the soda and salt with the flour.

My co-workers love these when I bring them in for a special occasion! I substitute butter flavored crisco for the plain shortening to give more flavor. These are the best!

To date, the best eggless pb cookie i've found.  Not as good as a recipe I have that takes 3 eggs, but since discovering my son is allergic to eggs, this one will become a staple.  I misread the recipe, and added the chocolate chips to the dough, rather than melt them on top, but they were still pretty good.

Wonderful!  Melt-in-your-mouth cookies.  Found these searching for eggless because I was out, and so very glad I did!  I was also out of chocolate chips, so had to sub chocolate syrup drops in their place.  Otherwise, followed recipe exactly and they were to die for!  Thank you Robin.

Big Hit! These were great!  Best eggless peanut butter cookie I have found (allergies). I did take the advice of another reviewer and cut the soda in half. Fun to make (kid-wise). Someone mentioned not necessarily quick (like a drop cookie) but I think in a time crunch, you could just slice and bake and they would be a good basic pb cookie.  Not to mention we can eat the dough to our hearts desire and not worry about eggs in the batter!

Very good!  I made them with butter instead of shortening.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla.  They are a tad dry, but the stuff inside makes them phenomenal.  Not a super EASY cookie (like a drop cookie) but totally worth it.

this was very interesting and they were good.  peanut butter on the inside so gooey and good.  Although the cookies themselves were a little dry but the peanut butter made up for it i guess.

These were nothing special to my family.  They had a very strong taste of flour.  I definitely will NOT make these again.

Love these cookies!  Taste like nutter butter cookies.  The second time I made the cookies I used a scoop and made a thumbprint in the middle for the peanut butter and chocolate chips.  They taste even better than having the sandwich style and a little quicker.

This recipe was in my great grandma's cookbook, over 90 years old! It's the best! The only thing left out is, rolls have to be wrapped in wax paper, equal in size, & left in the freezer until chilled (at least 3 hrs). It's the best peanut butter recipe ever & reminds me of my great grandma's falling apart cookbook:)

Oh, my, goodness!! When you use the dough recipe from Chocolate chip Peanut Butter Cookies from this website, and then add in the filling from this recipe, you get possibly the best cookies ever!! It's an awful lot of work to get the filling on the middle, and the cookies taste just as good if the "filling" is just on top, so that's what I did!  They actually look prettier that way, too. The only reason I didn't give them a five is because I used a different dough recipe than the one in this recipe, since other members reviewed it as awfully dry.

Wonderful!  "Creamy" is not usually an adjective I use for cookies, but that is what they were. Especially the next day. I fully intended to make them exactly according to the recipe, but I ran short of peanut butter. I had enough for the dough but not enough to spread between layers. So I just mixed the chocolate chips into the dough and put the dough on the pan by spoonfull, and they were terrific. I had natural peanut butter (no added ingredients like sugar) and they still turned out great.

This recipe makes great sized cookies that taste great.  I got so many compliments.  Everyone thought they were store bought. (with that homemade taste)
