We really like these burgers. The Panko breadcrumbs and eggs really help hold them together. I made a double batch and plan to freeze some of the mix for another time and am actually looking forward to partially baking them and finishing on a grill. So often we go to b-b-q events and have really tired of settling with salad and frozen veggie burgers. I'll add more jalapeno next time, and may add some cumin, too. Delicious hot OR cold for sandwiches, too! Thanks!

I didn’t make it, but a friend did.   She added salsa to make delicious Tacos.  I couldn’t believe how good they were!  Another friend said she thought it tasted like TocoBell’s.

This is by far one of the worst veggie/lentil burger recipes.  I even boiled the lentils in vegetable broth and used the whole jalapeno but it had very little flavor.  Takes a lot of time to finely dice the other veggies and the end result is a dry, mushy patty.  I would not make this again.

love these. i had cooked red lentils on hand, so just sauteed the veg separately, then put it all in the food processor, and baked. i was out of eggs so used chia seed & water as a binder instead ... perfect.

They were great, I used red lentils because the recipe didn't specify. I made rice to go with it but I think it needed a vegetable more so next time i will do that. The recipe says feeds 6 but it was only enough for 3 servings.
