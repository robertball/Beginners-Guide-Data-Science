It's a good base recipe, but after reading the reviews, I knew it needed kicking up a notch. So I did the following: For the stuffing, I used red delicious apples, about 3/4 C, 3 T crumbs, and 1/4 C sharp cheddar, shredded. It smelled bland. So I added about 3-4 T brown sugar, and somewhere around 1 t cinnamon. Then, I added a few dashes of my personal spice blend (which is seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder, pepper, oregano, basil and a dash of thyme), and it STILL needed something. McCormick Curry Powder! A couple of dashes and it was exactly what I wanted. The smell can only be described as odd and complex. I browned them in olive oil instead of butter. Doubled liquids, I used herbed chicken bouillion in place of water, and the wine was Turning Leaf Chardonnay, 2003 Reserve. I had a handful of apple chunks and slices left over, so in the last 10 minutes of simmering, I threw these into the sauce to cook, and added a couple T of brown sugar. I removed the chicken to plates when it was done, placed the cooked apple slices on top, stirred the sauce over high heat, adding a bit more brown sugar, and the sugar began to carmelize, thickening it nicely without the need for flour. I served with baby carrots and garlic bread. The sauce was an EXCELLENT complement to the carrots, and the chicken was the perfect balance of sweet and savory. If you try this method, make SURE to use McCormick curry powder! I will definitely be making this again ... MY way!

A nice little elegant meal.  The other reviewers are right, make sure to brown your chicken well and there will be no issues with weird purple chicken and it will taste better.  Choose tart apples that will hold their shape, like a granny smith.  Butterfly and pound your chicken to allow more surface area for more yummy filling.  The cheese is more of a 'glue' for the stuffing and I would recomend playing with the spices, such as some pepper, sage, savory thyme and a dash of allspice to compliment the apples. The gravy bennifits from stock instead of water and any leftover stuffing with some apple chunks. Also, an alternative to serving it as a big chicken lump on a plate, cut it into slices to show off the filling and pour gravy over top. Bon Appetite!

OUTSTANDING recipe!  I made it a second time with slight variations.  Added to stuffing about 2 T. shredded carrot for color and about 2 T. chopped pecans for texture.

I also couldn't watch it on the stove, so after browning the breasts, I removed them and deglazed the pan with the wine, and then added the chicken stock and corn starch, brought it to a boil, returned the breasts to the pan, covered it and put the whole pan in a 325 oven for an hour.  EASY!

I'm a bachelor, my girlfriend loved it. It was quick and easy. Next time, more cheese, bigger breast, and chicken broth instead of water. I presented it on a bed of rice with steamed broccali around the plate and the sause drizzled on top of the chicken. It was a hit...I am THE MAN.

This is a wonderful recipe! The combination of flavors and textures are so complimentary and its even easy to make. I made it for my in-laws tonight and it got rave reviews from all six of us. I made a few alterations: I added 2 tbl. chopped walnuts, 2 tbl. chopped parsley, and 1 tbl. of melted butter to the stuffing; I sauteed the stuffed breasts  in a hot skillet until golden on each side and then baked in the wine/butter sauce in a 9X13 glass pan for 20-30 minutes at 450 degrees. Thank you for the recipe; its lovely.

Fabuous recipe with a wonderful combination of flavors! I swear you could put just about anything rolled up inside a chicken breast and it's bound to be good. The combination of sweet apple and sharp cheddar was definitely an indicator that this was going to be tasty so I had to give this a try and boy am I glad I did! However, I did make a couple of changes... After I pounded my chicken breasts down thin I used bread cubes vs. Italian bread crumbs for the stuffing.  I combined the dried bread cubes with the apple and some curry powder, brown sugar and a little salt.  I moistened the stuffing with some apple juice.  I used sliced sharp cheddar cheese then place the stuffing over top and rolled it together securing with toothpicks.  Half I did with the apple stuffing and cheese the other half I did with apple stuffing, cheese and of course - bacon! I dipped the chicken in egg and then plain bread crumbs to form a light coating. I then drizzled it with a little melted butter and baked at 375 for 35 - 40 mintues. For the sauce I used apple juice vs. water and a mild white wine.  I added a little poultry seasoning for flavor and added a splash of cream. The result was a very moist and flavorful chicken bursting with a delicious apple stuffing and cheese filling!  You could easily do without the sauce and it was hard to tell which we liked the ones with bacon or the ones without...either way this recipe is a keeper!

EXCELLENT!  I needed something a little different for  chicken breasts last night and I had a couple of apples left over from a pie and instead of cheddar, I used brie since that is what I had in the fridge.  I rarely measure ingredients and I know I used more apple, cheese.  More wine and chicken broth also to make more sauce.  This is a real keeper.  My husband and I both just LOVED it!

Came out very tender, and seemed more difficult than it was!  The only tricky
part is the physical stuffing of the chicken, we found that pinning each piece with
the same number of toothpicks, whether it needs it or not, ensures you know how
many you are taking out before serving!

The chicken was very tender but there wasn't much taste.  Next time I will use chicken broth instead of water and maybe add some more spices or brown sugar.  It did look impressive on the serving platter.

We really, really liked this, and I am not a huge fan of fruit in combination with meat.  I did make use of all the excellent reviews and added more cheese and bread crumbs to the stuffing.  I used all wine and, like Grannyloohoo, I had 1/2 can of healthy request cream of mushroom soup that I threw in. That thickened the sauce, so I didn't have to deal with cornstarch. The next time I make this, I will double the sauce.

I made this tonight and put a little twist that none of the other reviewers stated? If you make it with these ingredients, I promise it will not turn out bland and ordinary as some reviewers stated! Made for 4 chicken breast. The thinner (Min 1/4 inch) the better for stuffing!  I used 1 cup of diced Granny Smith apples, 3-4 Tbs of brown sugar, 1 tsp of cinnamon, and 6 Tbs of quality Blue Cheese crumbles, this is the secret ingredient! I added 2.5 Tbs of home made Italian bread crumbs and stirred well. I put 3-4 tooth picks in each breast to hold well. I used a heavy stainless steel pan to brown the chicken well before I added the liquid. Did not use butter in pan, only Olive Oil. Once browned nicely on both sides, I added 1/2c of Chardonnay wine, and 1/2 c of chicken broth. I also added the remaining chopped apples I had left over (used 2) to the mixture and covered and simmered on low/med heat for 15 min. After 15 min I removed chicken and added 2 Tbs of brown sugar and 3 tsp of corn starch that was mixed with 2 Tbs of water, stirred briskly to a rapid boil. Removed from heat to let thicken. Served with mash potatoes and put gravy all over chicken and potatoes.  The blue cheese mixture was amazing with the gravy! I don't like walnuts, but if you do, these would be good in the stuffing mixture as well. If I made the recipe as stated, i can see where it might be a little bland. If you cook it this way and think it's bland, your missing taste buds!

First of all, I want to thank SIMPLYRAINAH for such a helpful review...thanks for your suggestions! I pounded my chicken & then seasoned it w/ Paula Deen's house seasoning (salt, pepper & garlic powder). I used gala apples (I think...can't remember lol) & I did add a bit of extra cheese as well as some brown sugar, onion powder & curry to my stuffing. Loved the stuffing (couldn't stay out of it!)...the spices that Rainah suggested really added a lot of flavor.  I did use chicken broth instead of water and I'm out of dry white wines (I know I couldn't believe it either ;o) )so I had to use apple juice, which worked surprisingly well. I  tripled the sauce so I'd have plenty to use on carrots, as Rainah suggested. This chicken looks very ugly while cooking (hubby called it my Frankenstein dish) but don't worry; in the end, it is very attractive. I did take Rainah's suggestion to serve it w/ carrots. I used baby carrots & after glazing them w/ some of the sauce, I added a tbp. of butter. Plated the chicken pinwheels (be sure & let the chicken rest before slicing so the juices don't escape) on a platter w/ the baby carrots, drizzled the chicken w/ the sauce & sprinkled chopped, fresh parsley over all...adding a sprig or two as an extra accent. Served it w/ Harvest Rice dish, the carrots, a romaine salad w/ cheddar cheese & ranch dressing & a glass of white zinfandel. Wsa a fabulous dinner that our guests & ourselves really enjoyed! Thanks for the wonderful recipe Behr Kleine!

This was similar to a recipe that my mom had made a few months ago, so I wanted to make this for my boyfriend one night. I only made a few changes: I shredded the granny smith apple and substituted shredded gouda cheese for the cheddar. This made it easier to stuff the chicken breasts so I could roll them up more tightly. I also used all white wine instead of water, and with the leftover apple mixture, added that to the pan after I had removed the chicken and sprinkled some flour (instead of corn starch) to create my sauce. 

The boyfriend said this had to go into regular rotation with him!

OOHH -- We liked this one.  Even DH who is not crazy about "sweet meat".  3 sons thought it was delicious.  I made it again today and didn't feel like fooling with all that "rolling & stuffing" -- just cooked the chicken and apples all together in the skillet.  Was just as tasty and much less time consuming. I waited omitted the breadcrumbs altogether this way and added the cheese (sprinkled on top) more as a flvorful garnish than anything else.  Cooking it this way in the skillet turned this into a really good "one-dish-meal" -- EASY! -- but sophisticated taste!  THANKS -- new family favorite for a change in Chicken!

I've cooked this for dinner twice now! I follow the recipe, except for adding more apples/breadcrumbs/cheese mixture as needed. The cooking time is perfect! I use a mix of Golden Delicious and Granny Smith apples. If you want more gravy, add more dry wine and water before simmering. This is such a simple dish, with great flavor!

I made this for the first time and I found it was difficult to roll the apple stuffing into the chicken. It didnt turn out like the picture and I even had some stuffing left over.
I used apple juice in place of the wine like one of the other reviews suggested and turned out good. Next time I will make the chicken thinner so I can roll it up.

I followed the advice given by others and added brown sugar, cinnamon, pepper, seasoning salt, garlic powder, oregano and basil to the bread crumb mix.  I also used chicken broth instead of wine.  I cut up four cups of apples and added them on top with more brown sugar after browning the chicken since my family loves fried apples.  My husband and children are VERY picky eaters, normally will not try anything new, but they absolutely LOVED this recipe.  Next time we are going to try pineapple in place of the apples... although we loved the apples very much!  Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This was a good basic recipe, but I did change a few things and will change a couple more next time. I will be making this again. I used Point Reyes blue cheese instead of cheddar. Excellent bite. I also salted and peppered the chicken. After browning the chicken I threw in some sliced white mushrooms to steam and add flavor to the gravy. Changes for next time? I will add 2 T chopped walnuts to the stuffing for texture. There needs to be more gravy if serving with potatoes (tho. it was fine with the wild rice I served with it), so I'd increase the wine to 1/2 C and would change water to 1 cup chicken broth. Lastly, I would not toss the whole cornstarch mixture in, but start with half and see how much I'd need to add to thicken. YUMMY, though. Hubby and I enjoyed the meal.

my husband and i absolutely loved this. i just made it for my parents and brothers this sunday and they loooved it and my brothers don't eat anything but cereal.  I made a few modifications. for the stuffing, i used 3/4 C chopped red delicious apples, 3 T dried bread crumbs (i had regular only so i added a bit of italian seasoning in it) 1/4 C sharp cheddar cheese, shredded, 3-4 T brown sugar, 1 t of cinnamon, took someone else's advise and added the following: few dashes of seasoned salt, garlic powder, pepper, oregano, basil and mccormich curry powder. i stuffed the breasts and still had some of the stuffing left over so i saved it.
after i browned the chicken, i added 1/2 C of chicken broth, and 1/2 C apple cider vinegar instead of wine and water. i'm a beginner so i thought apple cider and apple cider vinegar was the same thing. i was actually looking for apple cider and  goofed. but you know... it really turned out great.  and i used more than the recipe called for so i could have more sauce later. in the last ten minutes or so of simmering, i added the leftover apple mix and quite a bit of brown sugar to taste. i took off the chicken when it was done and continued making the sauce. the chicken was perfectly cooked, not dry and the flavor was a perfect blend of sweet and savory. i served it with mashed potatoes and steamed baby carrots. this is my fav. recipe so far. :) i will make this for ppl i want to impress.. like my in-laws :D 
p.s. my mom helped me make this and s

This recipe was pretty good.  I did read some of the other reviews and salt and peppered the chicken before rolling it up with the apple mixture.  I used chicken broth instead of water, and I also chopped up a little bit more apple and added it with the wine and broth to make a "chunky gravy".  Not as pretty a dish as I wanted it to be, but overall very tasty!

SO I'm giving it 5 stars, but I actually made it totally differently.  I sliced three apples and an onion and a clove of garlic.  I sauteed all these in a pan with butter until the apples were soft and the onion were clear.  I stuffed the chicken breasts with the mixture and shredded cheddar cheese, then put in a roasting pan, and covered with more cheese and crumbled ritz crackers, covered, and baked for about 45 minutes at 375.  I uncovered at that point and allowed it to brown for about 15 more minutes.  SO DELICIOUS, everyone LOVED them!

Ummm....YUM!!!!! SO delicious! I followed the recipe with the following changes:  I doubled the filling and added a couple of dashes of cinnamon and a few pinches of brown sugar to both the filling and the gravy (per other reviewers suggestions). Outstanding!! Next time I will use sharp cheddar for a stronger flavor, and will simmer in all wine without the water. My husband asked me to make this again next week! This one is a winner!

Ok, I was in search for a quick chicken recipe when I ran across this recipe. With a little modification it turned out GREAT. First, it’s a deadly sin in my family not to season/ marinade your meats. 20 min in a garlic and herb marinade did the trick. I used 4 small sweet green apples. 2 diced finely with butter and ADOBO for the stuffing (no bread crumbs here!) The others were place with 1/2 of a coarsely chopped red onion, and 1 1/3 cup of **Palomino Fino** a white Jerez  Xeres Sherry. The wine always makes the difference, so you should always state what you used. Also added little garlic salt, sugar, black pepper and Adobo to taste. Sorry no cornstarch or cheese used either. Just let it all simmer…. GOOD EATS!! 09/004

This turned out to be easier than I thought.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added more cheese and herbs to the stuffing...I even added shredded zucchini to the mix and it turned out great.  I also added flavor by braising with apple juice/wine.   Was very pleased and would make this again, perhaps having fun with other variations.  I served this with a side of linguine with shredded zucchini in a pesto sauce.

I added some dried cranberries to the stuffing and used all Pinot Grigio (no water) to braise the chicken.  Many of the reviews said that that the chicken was bland, but we didn't find that to be the case.  What did turn outstanding was the gravy and, perhaps, that was a result of using only wine.  The gravy totally added another layer of flavor to this dish.

This was delicious! I was a little hesitant on the apple/chicken combo but it is very good! I didn't flatten out the chicken and roll it up I just put a pocket in the chicken and filled it. The gravy was delicious! Will definitely make it again!

I thought this tasted pretty good.  I didn't use wine, I used chicken broth instead and omitted 1 c. of the water altogether, though I would use less of the cornstarch!!!!  I had to use chicken thighs since I was out of chicken breasts, but it was still good.    I think next time I will use the same basic ingredients but cook things my own way to save time.  Everyone seemed to enjoy this meal.  I'm only going to give it 4 stars though because it is more time consuming then I anticipated and I do feel it needs a little more something.  Oh, I also added salt and pepper and garlic powder to the chicken while browning.  Great recipe!  Thank you so much for sharing!

This was good.  I was nervous, because it's different, but it turned out okay.  I used chicken stock instead of water, added a little bit of cinnamon to the stuffing, used more cheese because I love it, and after stuffing and rolling the chicken, I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and a bit of garlic powder.  I browned the chicken well.  I also added cinnamon and brown sugar to the sauce.  Boyfriend gave it a 4.2 on a scale of 1 to 5, so I'll be making this again.  Also, I took meaty chicken breasts and pounded the heck out of them, so they were wide.  This made them easier to stuff, roll and secure with toothpicks.  I had almost none of the stuffing fall out .

Really good - wasn't coordinated enough to wrap it so I make the apple/cheese/bread crumb/curry mix and stuck it all on top of the chicken breast, then put it in the oven on 350 for about 45 min - delicious!

Family really liked this.  I used: 4 small chicken breasts, 1/2 C chopped apple, 1/4 C shredded cheese, 3 T bread crumbs, 2 T walnuts
1 tsp cinnamon, 4 T brown sugar, dash onion powder, Olive oil in the pan. Browned them REALLY well. Then added 1 can of chicken broth and simmered.  Took the breasts out and added the cornstarch a few extra apple chunks and 1 T brown sugar.  OHHHHHHH YUM!!!  Very nice presentation!

Following the recipe, this is a lot of work for no taste. I was really looking forward to it but should have known the lack of spices would turn out to be a not so good thing. Self admittedly I like things with a lot of taste to it, but even expecting it to come up a little short didn't quite cover it. I made it a second time, almost didn't, when I read Rainah's modifications. With the new recipe this was awesome and moved to a 5 star! With the recipe how it is written though, I think it falls short of expectations.

This was surprisingly good! 5 out of 6 of us inhaled it and had seconds! I think the gravy made it extra special. I didn't think it was that much work but I'm used to making chicken cordon bleu. The only thing that I would change is the bread crumbs. I put it in one and left it out of the other and I couldn't tell any difference. Seems a wasted step. I also didn't use the wine/water mix as I didn't have any wine. Used straight chicken broth and it was great. Next time I'll try to have wine to see how that would taste. I can see some great variations on this as well - maybe bleu cheese and pear? Granny Smith and sharp cheddar? All in all, a great idea and definitely one for the recipe box. Thanks!

I do not understand how this can be grouped with "Jewish" recipes as the use of cheese and chicken together violates basic kashrut laws.

needed more flavor, as written was bland. experiment and add seasonings/herbs that you like and it will be great. 

For the apples, I used honeycrisps. I added mushrooms, fresh rosemary, more cracked black pepper, and a splash of heavy whipping cream to the saute pan and it blended with the apples quite nicely.

I added chicken broth instead of water, like the other users recommended. I sprinkled thyme instead of parsley. Also, I sautéed a few onion slices in the butter before the chicken, and used flour instead of cornstarch.  Really super flavors, and it was a man pleaser as well.

TERRIFIC!!!! Wonderfully quick and easy meal to prepare for those with kids or a busy lifestyle. I made a few minor alterations.... 1) I used chicken breast fillets that are already cut as it saves on time and they're less expensive. 2) I used a GrannySmith apple and in the stuffing I added Cinnamon, brown sugar, all ground spice, black pepper and thyme (just a bit more than a pinch of each...perhaps 1/4 of a teaspoon). I also increased the bread crumbs to 2.5 tblsp and a little extra cheese 3) I used Sherry Wine for a robust flavour and chicken stock (low sodium) when cooking 5) When making the gravy I did use cornstarch but I also added the remaining apple chunks which completed it nicely. 6) At the end I added more wine and slightly more chicken stock as I like to have extra gravy and I cooked it for 20 min when 15 would've been fine so the liquid had evaporated more. I paired the chicken with Uncle Ben's Wholegrain Brown Rice - Vegetarian Medley and sliced the chicken to show off the stuffing. My 2.5 yr old gobbled up an adult plate size!!! Simply Excellent. It will impress anyone you cook it for. Thk you.

This was great! I did not roll the chicken, but I cut a strip in the center and stuffed it, then tied it shut while it baked. I also used more apples...next time I will use more cheese. But overall a very impressive dish. My husband loved it.

Wonderful! I tweaked some things a bit taking advice from other reviews. I added the cinnamon and brown sugar which is a MUST and a bunch of other seasonings. This smelled delicious when I opened the lid after simmering and I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into it! It was very moist and most importantly it was an easy meal to make (but it looks gormet!). I will surely be saving this recipe! Thank you!

I was so nervous about making this, mainly because I didn't think my husband would like the apples in it. Well he could not stop raving about it--I even got a big hug for it after dinner, so thank you Behr Kleine! The taste is out of this world. Like IMVINTAGE I added more cheese and a dash of curry, and more crumbs (used Panko crumbs). I doubled the recipe for 4 chicken breasts, but didn't double the apple. Next time I will use the full amount of apple--I loved the flavor it added (Hubby didn't know it was there till I told him!)--and I will use stuffing mix for the crumbs. I used all wine and I had 1/2 can of mushroom soup, so I whisked that into the final sauce, along with a splash of balsamic vinegar. I had to laugh at IMVINTAGE's description of how it looks while it's cooking, but it does turn a beautiful mahogany, and the smell almost drove my husband crazy while it was cooking. He has asked me to make this for either Thanksgiving or Christmas dinner! I served it with Classy Green Bean Casserole, Caramelized Apple Rings, and Refrigerator Rolls, all from this site.

I, too, found it a little difficult to roll. So, instead of flattening the chicken breasts, I sliced it sideways (butterflied it)and it was much easier.

I suggest doubling the amount of liquid involved when cooking two breasts. I followed the recipe but only made one breast, and the gravy was just enough for one. When I make it with two breasts, I'll make more gravy than the recipe calls for. On the whole, AWESOME flavor!!

This recipe was wonderful.  I used fat free cheese and cooking spray and it still turned out yummy.  Although stuffing the chicken brests can be a bit difficult... the end result is worth it.  You could serve this at a dinner party!

This recipe is a little time consuming, but definitely worth the effort.  It tasted great and was even fun to make!  I didn't have bread crumbs, however, so I crushed up some herbed salad croutons.  I've never tried anything like this before and it was really scrumptious.  This one's a keeper!

I made this for my husband who is not usually open to anything new.  I pounded out the chicken breasts and stuffed them ahead of time when he was not around.  When he came home from work they were already in the skillet.  I made garlic mashed potatoes and corn on the cob along with this main dish.  There were NO LEFTOVERS!

Succulent and Delicious! I used asiago and mozarella cheeses with granny smith apples on a bed of cous cous. It was wonderful! Next time I'll use even more cheese.

I made this for dinner lastnight and it was wonderful!  I did make a few minor adjustments though.  Based on the reviews I thought it would be a bit bland for my family so I added about a Tbsp of minced onion & about a tsp of each of the following: cinnamon, chili powder, poultry seasoning, brown sugar and season salt. Sprinkled that on both sides of the chicken BEFORE stuffing & AFTER stuffing I dredged the chicken in egg and rolled in bread crumbs so it had a nice crispy coating . I then baked it at 375F for about 35 min & it was awesome! I will definitely be making this again!

This is my favorite recipe so far. I made it the first time with my mom. We used Gala apples and mild cheddar.  It was on the bland side but good.  The second time I used granny smith's and a sharp cheddar.  It will be one I make again and again!

Good recipe. This was my second time stuffing chicken. It was a little sloppy, but tasted fine. The filling was a little bland, even with sharp cheddar. I might try adding a strong spice to it next time, like Rosemary or sage. And I might also add a can of mushrooms to the gravy.

This is a really good recipe.  I really never cook and was surprised how easy it  went together.  I just butterflied the chicken breasts and stuffed them, I didn't pound them flat.  I followed some of the advice of the other reviewers and added more cheese and spices to the apple mixture.  I used plain breadcrumbs, but probably could have done without them.  I used Dubliner Irish cheese and white cheddar, and a dash of cumin, garlic salt, brown sugar, cinnamon, and a little cayenne pepper.  I also salted and peppered the chicken lightly before browning.  I used all white wine in the simmer, no broth or water.    I gave it 4 stars since I had to add some stuff to it, but I would give it 4 and a half if possible.  Considering how low in calories this is (probably still less than 250 with the sugar and extra cheese and wine), and how very tasty, I'm sure I'll make it again.  The Husband loved it too!

Personally I thought the dish was good, friends thought it was great.  I did take the advice and add spices I slit the chicken breast instead of pounding and rolling.  Also sauteed in about 2 cloves of garlic, used season all and minced onion to season and browned, then instead of wine I used apple juice and no broth.

I love this dish! I usually take the apple pieces that didn't make it into my chicken and cook them in the pan with the chicken. They soak up the wine and butter and end up oh so good. This is one of my favorites!

After reading the reviews, I made this with some minor changes and it was very good.  I used parmesan cheese instead of cheddar; added cinnamon and brown sugar and raisins; added a dash of ground red pepper (really added some pop); added dashes of several other spices - sage, garlic powder, etc.  Then to keep the stuffing from falling out of the ends, I wrapped each breast with a strip of bacon.  I used juice (blueberry/pomegranate) instead of wine.  My husband really like this recipe and it is an attractive dish so it would be very nice for company.  We will definitely have this again.

This was amazing.  I made a variation as many of the other reviewers have done. I don't measure anything so I don't have exact amounts, but I added salt and pepper, cinnamon, oregano, thyme, sage, and garlic salt to the stuffing.  I didn't have any wine on hand so instead I used 1/2 simply apple juice and 1/2 chicken broth. At the end, I added all the extra stuffing mix to the pan and cooked with the chicken for about 8 minutes. I removed the chicken and added brown sugar to the pan and cooked it with the leftover stuffing mix until it caramelized. I served that on top of the chicken. It was delicious! I can't wait to play with this recipe some more - it was very fun to make. Thanks to the reviews that I read as well!

I changed this recipe from apples and chedar to pears and grated blue cheese, since that's what I had.  Everything else was the same.  Tasted good with rice.  Next time, I will brown the chicken more so it looks better.  Otherwise, it's a winner.  The rue was the best part.  I served this with rice, although au gratin potatoes would work great too.

I really enjoyed this dish; my DH didn't as much.  I followed most of what reviewer "SimplyRainah" recommended increasing the quantity of apple (honeycrisp), cheese, & bread crumbs, plus adding some curry powder & cinnamon to the filling. Seasoned the flattened chicken with granulated garlic.  Sauteed the chicken in butter as the recipe reads, using 3/4c chardonnay & 1+tsp "Better Than Bouillon (chicken)" in 3/4c water.  After removing the chicken to a plate, I added the leftover filling and apple to the sauce, along with a couple of tablespoons of brown sugar, & simmered it with 4.5tsp cornstarch which thickened it nicely.  Served with a spinach/grape tomato/cucumber/feta salad with orange marmalade dressing, and steamed carrots.  Thank you so much, Behr and reviewers!

Loved this recipe! The chicken was very tender with great favor from the apple, cheese filling.  The gravy was great with it. Did not have wine so just used broth and water.  My 3 year old son ate all of it and he is not the greatest eater.  Will be making this again:)

I really liked this recipe.  The gravy is key.  I overcooked the chicken, just to ensure it was thoroughly cooked (cooked about 1/2 hour) and it didn't hurt it at all.  The stuffing was somewhat sweet, and for presentation it looked very professional, even though half of the recipe is to leave it simmering.  : )  Use it for quick entertaining.

I listened to the advice of other reviewers saying this recipe was a bit bland. I used a sharp smoked chedder cheese and added onion powder, sage and plenty of salt and pepper to the apple/breadcrumb mixture. Initially I didn't think the filling would stay in the chicken but it did. I used kebab skewers to hold the chicken together rather than toothpicks. I used chicken stock and a touch more wine instead of water for the gravy which was really yummy! Overall this is a great dish with the addition of some extra flavour.

I thought this was unbelievably easy to put together and the wine sauce is delicious.  I made it with the ingredients listed but I would absolutely use any kind of cheese.  I think it's important if you are using chicken breasts that are already deboned and skinned to look for the largest ones possible.  They flatten out larger and will handle more of the stuffing.

I doctored this recipe up based on the reviews, added dried cherries to the stuffing, doubled the wine and added a 1/2 cup apple juice for more sauce.  I also sprinkled some brown sugar, cinnamon, and allspice on the chicken breasts.  I added diced apple to the sauce, too.  This was tasty, just didn't knock me out.  Bland with the chicken, I suppose I prefer pork with apple.  I did enjoy trying this nice, seasonal dish.  Thanks for sharing with us.

I simply wanted to suggest that toothpicks don't help alot but I found that old fashioned string made a huge difference in holding all ingredients within and allowing cooking do it's job without the prickly toothpicks.  The strings are cut off prior to serving and all looks magnificent. Bon appetite.

As written this seemed a little bland. I used green apples, jalapenos, 1/2 italian bread crumbs and 1/2 panko, shallot, parsley, spicy poultry rub mix, spicy italian herb mix, salt, pepper,extra sharp cheddar, and an italian cheese mix (the smoked provolone made a big difference). I  seasoned outside  with salt, pepper, and more spicy poultry rub. Quickly browned in olive oil and baked at 350 for 30 min. Made gravy as recipe stated but added a lot more seasoning. Served with rice and butter brown sugar carrots with onions. It took a lot of tweaking from written recipe but it was good. Also had a lot of leftover stuffing which we mixed with the leftover rice and sauce left from carrots. Made for lunch today by butterflying breasts and filling with rice/stuffing mix. I made a dijon mustard sauce based on Dijon Chicken by Marilyn Holmes on this site. Better with the dijon sauce.

This is a really easy weeknight meal.  It sounds complicated because you have to pound out the breasts and stuff them but the stuffing really does taste like Thanksgiving and the apples give a great crisp flavor to the stuffing.  My husband doesn't like fruit with his meat but he didn't mind the apples in the stuffing.  If you have a hankering for Thanksgiving but don't want to go through the fuss of all the fixings, this is the dinner for you!  Only gave it 4 stars because you really do have to like fruit in your meal or this may not appeal to you as much.

This is one of my husband's favorite meals.  I took the advice of others and used chicken broth instead of water.  Just make sure you count how many toothpicks you use!

diffently a keeper, I found it hard to stuff the slits, so next time I'll cut the breasts in half lenght ways and pin them together with tooth picks. I will also add different spices, garlic, cinnimon just for more flavor.

Absolutely amazing recipe. I added a few other goodies and my husband noted this tasted like a Thanksgiving dinner! I added dried cranberries and some pecans.  This is a great meal to serve guests....and a lot fewer calories than that Thanksgiving Day meal!!!!

I made the mistake of marinading my chicken overnight in something I threw together and it clashed with the taste this recipe has to offer, so don't do that!  My second time around was a lot better but not really what I expected.  This is worth making again but something needs to be added into the stuffing.  Hmmmmm.

Found this quite yucky, to be honest. Even with cinnamon, the apple/cheese has such a bland flavor that it's basically just steamed chicken, and wasn't a pleasant dish at all. Will not make again.

Delicious! I used the recommendation of others and mixed cinnamon, italian herbs, and a little honey in the cheese/bread crumbs mixture that was in the middle. Also decided to bake @ 175 C in the oven for 30 min. instead of cooking in butter.

OMG...This was the best chicken I have ever made. I made a few modifications First off, I used a block of mild cheddar and chopped it into small chunks for the stuffing. I browned the chicken in the pan for about 5 minutes on each side and then put all the breasts into the oven at 350 for 30 minutes. I used the same pan and threw in some addtional white wine (Relax Reisling), brown sugar, some left over stuffing and chicken stock. I let the sauce reduce while the chicken was baking. AWESOME RECIPE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This was great, but I added/subtracted quite a bit. I stuffed my chicken with granny smith apples, smoked gouda (sliced thin), sweet onion, and toasted pecans. I also took two suggestions from others: DO sprinkle some allspice on the inside of the chicken and atop your apples (I layered those first), and DO add some fresh tarragon leaves to the sauce, as well as your leftover onion slices and apple (I diced the apple portion I put in the sauce). Also substitute water with chicken broth- I only cook with water when I'm boiling noodles. Riesling is the recommended wine on this dish and it works really well. Get a dry one so you can cook with it AND serve it with this meal.

Wow!! This was amazing! The additions/alterations I made were:   I substituted apple cider vinegar in place of the wine; I used a half slice of whole wheat taost crumbled up with 1/4 tsp (each) of oregano, cinnamon, basil and a dash of Stevia (healthy sweetner) in place of italian bread crumbs; I sprinkled the chicken with basil, dill weed and cinnamon before browning; I added a half cup of chopped apples to the skillet after browning the chicken (this is a great addition for the sauce!). My husband and I thought this was soooo good! I will definitely make it over and over again.   To make it a meal...I had mixed frozen veggies with sliced sweet potatoes that cooked in chicken broth with garlic powder sprinkled well all over the potatoes to go with the chicken. Yum!

I've made this a few times, with mixed results. The first two or three times, great! However, I was omitting the cheese.   The last time, I used swiss instead of cheddar. Taste-wise, it worked. But consistency wise-- not so much. I'm not sure if my meat hammer just couldn't get the chicken breast thin enough or what-- it looked fine when I put it in the pan, but definitely didn't cook evenly.  I've always used apple cider vinegar to sautee in (in place of white wine) and it's really delicious. It gives it a very seasonal feel-- this recipe would be great in the Fall.

This was great, I used granny smith apples and some stouffers stuffing instead of bread crumbs. I also used some dry champagne instead of water. I covered the top with leftover apple, stuffing and cheese and I baked it instead of pan fry. WOW it turned out really good.

This recipe is slowly becoming a staple for us.  I love adding curry seasoning for some extra zing.  It's delicious and so fragrant.  I served this with some simple baked squash for a tasty fall meal.

I was trying to find a recipe for chicken that would not require me to go to the store.  I came across this one, read the reviews, and it came out great!  It truly IS kid friendly...my 9 year old and her friend ate every bite.  I did use a few of the suggestions.  I added a tablespoon or so of brown sugar to the stuffing as well as some cinnamon, italian seasoning (I only had plain breadcrumbs), salt and pepper.  I also used shredded Italian cheese I had in the fridge and added a couple of tablespoons of applesauce to bind everything together.  I also used 1 tsp. of olive oil per breast, just chicken broth (no wine) for the gravy and tossed in the leftover stuffing.  And I didn't have large breasts, so I just took a sharp knife and made a pocket in each breast and secured it with a toothpick. You could really stuff it plump this way (instead of rolling it), and it didn't come apart when cooked.  This one will go in our regular recipe box.  We're trying to eat healthy in my house, and this one can be be adjusted to allow me to count Weight Watchers points!  (5 per breast the way I made them)  Enjoy!

Highly reccommended. I made this for my parents' for their anniversary. I needed something I could do quickly, but that was special. This accomplished both goals! For the stuffing, I used blue cheese (one of my parents' favorites) and did pear and dried cranberries and blackberries with the apple. It turned out really well - kind of a hybrid cordon bleu. My mother enjoyed dinner so much that she wanted the recipe and told me "this is a keeper!"  What's best, is that this recipe feels like you're having a nice, rich meal, but without feeling like you could come away with gout. I'll definitely be using it to impress company again.

This was very good. I added some brown sugar  because I like sweet and it was recommended by a few other reviewers and it definately added lots of flavor. I had a hard time keeping the breasts together in the pan. I think maybe the breasts I was using was to small. I will definately try this recipe again but use bigger pieces of chicken. :-)

These were absolutely delicious!  I don't usually go for the fruit and meat thing..but this was really good.  I wish I knew how to wrap the chicken as neatly as the picture but none the less great recipe.  I will make again for sure!

This was good.  I did have some problems, but they weren't the fault of the recipe.  It was because my chicken breasts were so huge!  I pounded and pounded, but couldn't get them thin enough.  So, I couldn't roll them, only fold them.  I tried to brown them in the skillet, but I couldn't turn them without everything falling out, so I decided to bake them in the oven.  I poured the butter from the skillet onto the chicken, and poured 1/4 cup apple juice, 1/4 cup chicken broth in the pan as well.  (In place of the water and wine).  I baked at 400 for about 20 minutes, then turned it down to 350 and did 25 more minutes.  After they were done, I set them aside, covered with foil, poured the pan juices into a skillet and thickened like stated in the recipe.  Put some melted cheese on top of the chicken.  Served with brown rice, steamed peas and Light Wheat Rolls from this site.

Snaps for Behr! This was a wonderful dinner. I only made one small change because I didn't have wine. Based on other reviews I used a can of chicken stock instead of wine and water and it was great. Everyone loved the apple cheese combo. Do season the chicken before you brown it, it helps flavor the gravy as well. A definite keeper!!

Yum. Added cinnamon, nutmeg, curry, and fajita seasoning. Used orange juice instead of wine. My kids loved it (and one of them is VERY picky!)! Next time will add raisins.

Very easy to prepare and tasty, although next time I will pump up the flavor a bit with some herbs.  I think the people who had a hard time with the rolling and the toothpicks didn't flatten the chicken breasts enough.  They rolled and held beautifully for me.  They look pretty enough to serve to guests.  Thanks!

This one made my husband so happy and me too. Pretty easy to do. I didn't change anything, except.. I didn't have any toothpicks, so I closed them with uh.. ornament hooks which is dangerous, especially if you have small children :(.. which I don't. So, it was good and extremely delicious. Didn't take me long at all to make. Maybe 20-25 minutes tops and then it was in the oven/pan doing it's thing. He's asking for it again.

This was pretty good, looked nice too. I added more wine and more water, we like a lot of gravy. Quite a challenge to roll these thigs up. I used string, had no luck with toothpicks. Good recipe, my husband and I enjoyed it. I served it with egg noodles and steamed broccoli.

Made a few changes based on other reviews...used brie instead of cheddar & added a few spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves). Also used apple demi-sec instead of white wine and increased amount to 1/3 cup.

This was great.  My boyfriend and I both loved it.  I did add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the stuffing and put salt and pepper on the chicken breasts.  I used Granny Smith apples.  Also, I read the other reviews and doubled the sauce, which is definitely necessary.  I used Cran-Apple juice instead of wine in the sauce.  This was fabulous and easier to make than I imagined.  I will definitely make this again.

I'm still debating on whether this one will make it into the recipe box.  I think with modifications, it could actually turn out to be a good recipe.  But I don't know how many times I am willing to try that to make it happen.  I read the reviews before I prepared mine.  I added a little cinnamon to the stuffing to give it more flavor.  I am big on flavor and the addition of cinnamon still did not kick it up enough for me.  If I try it again, I will add onion as someone else suggested, more cheese, and also really season the chicken.  On another note, the chicken was very tender.

I think this is just way too bland and it is too much work for not enough taste. To help I added raisins, walnuts, cinnamon, and used colby jack instead. I might change cheese to creamcheese and make a different sauce. The sauce is really what did nothing for me. I recommend yellow apples. Browning the chicken was a pain with the toothpicks. Would rather pocket and bake.

I thought this was great, and so did my wife. We made alot of changes though. First we seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper,and cinnamon before we added the filling. We also used gorgonzola cheese along with the cheddar. Also we put some thyme and sage on the outside. People complained that there was not enough sauce so we upped the wine and chicken stock (water) to 1/3 cup each and got the perfest amount, to go along with that we used about 1 3/4 tsp cornstarch. The sauce was perfect. Well happy cooking.

This recipe was quite tricky to prepare. I had trouble with the stuffing falling out. As mentioned by some other reviews, I added a pinch of nutmeg to the apples, and substituted lemon juice for white wine. The outcome was quite tasty, but I'm not sure I'd make this again on a weeknight.

Yum yum and more yum. This was wonderful. I am sure I used more than 1/2 cup of apple (I used Fuji) and really stuffed the chicken breast rolls to the max. I cooked this with non stick spray instead of the butter and used apple juice instead of the wine for the gravy. (huge bottle in fridge that needed to be used up). I made an alteration on the gravy. Tonight when I heated up the leftovers, I thinned out the cold gravy with apple juice and a bit of evaporated skim milk. I really liked the creaminess the milk added and will make it that way from the beginning next time. I also am thinking of some sauted onions to the filling next time as well.

Two lessons, one it does need salt and pepper. Two don't use red wine. Not bad, but with those two recommendations it will be as discussed. I did double liquid ingredients.

My husband and I thought these stuffed chicken breasts were wonderful...a nice change of pace.  As others recommended, I added a tad of ground cinnamon to the stuffing and seasoned the chicken.  Doubling the sauce made a nice gravy for mashed potatoes.  Thank you Behr.

i had no problems stuffing the chicken and holding it together with the toothpicks, esp because once the chicken starts cooking it naturally holds shape. i also used sharp cheddar and sweet fuji apples for a more interesting taste contrast. i used chicken broth instead of water, but i added about a cup of broth to make more gravy, which went great served with mashed potatoes! i would also use more bread crumbs than the recipe calls for, as well as adding about 1/8 cup af the bread crumbs to the sauce.  im making this dish for my parents tomorrow nite!!

My family loved this dish! The chicken breasts that I used were fairly thick to start, so I fileted them before pounding them thin. I also followed someone else's advice and put salt, black pepper, and garlic powder on one side of the chicken before flipping it and putting the filling on the unseasoned side and rolling them. The other change i made was after removing the cooked chicken from the pan to make the gravy, I sprinkled some shredded cheddar cheese on the top of the chicken while still hot to allow it to melt while making the gravy.

This recipe has potential, but lacks a cohesive flavor. Chicken and apples are somewhat bland foods and the cheese and bread-crumbs are not enough to bring up the flavor to where it needs to be. In addition, the flavors do not have enough time to mingle together to create a solid main dish. It tastes very "fractured." I would to try this again with some changes. I would like to add some apple-wood smoked bacon to the filling to give it a salty and savory flavor. Also I would saute the apples with butter and brown sugar to give them a more complex flavor before adding the other ingredients. I also personally like some heat, so I may want to dredge the chicken with some flour and cayenne pepper.

This recipe has potential to have a sweet and savory explosion of flavors, but just can't deliver. I can't wait to attempt is again!

The recipe was very easy to make and did turn out well.  I think if I make again I will roll the chicken and brown first prior to adding the water and wine.  It will give the chicken some more texture and flavor which it was lacking just a tad.

Love this recipe! Just tried it for the first time and my hubby was impressed with my skills! I added a GENEROUS amount of wine and made the sauce extra thick-it became more of a glaze-and it was delectable! Will be making it again when my mother-in-law comes to town for the holidays :)

This is a good base but "not quite there" as it is still a bit bland. On one hand I can see where the other posters added some herbs to it....in many cases quite a few of them. My problem with their reviews is that they gave it 4 or 5 stars but what they have in the end is nowhere close to the posted recipe. What you now have is herb chicken, not apple chicken....not the same thing at all. I did find the need to add something to jazz it up but didn't want to stray too far from the original recipe and totally change it into something else either: Instead of half water and half wine I changed it to all wine, added 1/8 tsp of cinnamon to compliment the apples, doubled the cheddar for more flavor and added 1/2 tsp of bullion base to the sauce.The  next time I made this I sprinkled the chicken with salt and pepper first. That helped a LOT! It really does need the s and p.

I've made this before, and my family enjoyed it.  My 13 yr. old son just made it for us for a 8th grade homework assignment- he did it by himself, and it turned out just great!!  We didn't have opened wine, so he just used chicken broth instead of wine and water for the sauce.  He added chopped apples to the sauce, nice touch!

I made this tonight & wht i did was instead of making the stuffing, i just used cranberry stuffing out of the box&added the apples then cooked the chicken&stuffing in the oven on 360° for about 25 min& i added 1/4 cup of water to the bottom of the dish just incase the chicken got a little dry,( you could always add chicken broth instead of water), but it turned out great...

It tasted great, it was hard to keep the chicken together while cooking.  I thought it had plenty of flavor and I will make this again.

Unfortunately, this one didn't turn out as delicious as I was hoping for. It was pretty bland and I added more spices, and brown sugar to the recipe. However, I did bake it instead of sautee, that may have been the problem.

I thought it was a good recipe for the simplicity of it and the ability to change it to your taste.I listened to others advice and doubled the stuffing,added cinnamon,garlic powder and brown sugar.I added equal parts white wine and chicken broth at the end.Will make again.

hubby loved this - added golden raisins, brwn sugar and a little nutmeg to stuffing mix, also used a Mexican mix of cheeses.  Didn't have any wine in house so used apple juice and a little chick stock.  Had too much stuffing so after brwn in pan put in oven 350 @ 20 min  added rest of stuffing on top of chicken and cooked another 10 min or so - excellent, very tender, juicy & tasty

This was not only tasty, but simple to make and to doctor with ingredients that you have rather than what is listed. In my case, didn't have any bread crumbs so I used crushed corn chips. No cheddar cheese so I used mozzarella and parmesan. I added cinnamon for taste and it turned out really good. I also dumped the remaining stuffing mix into the liquid when making the gravy which was simply tasty :) Loved it!

My boyfriend and I made this as part of our date night.  We were very generous with the cheese and apples, so they were a bit hard to roll, but they came out well!  We used our own gravy, which gave it some more flavor.  Maybe next time I'll use the cheesy-apple mixture as a topping instead and not try to roll them up.

This dish was very good.  The recipe didn't specify what type of apples and I think that's important.  Granny Smith apples would bring the taste of the stuffing out a whole lot more.  Also, next time I'll season my chicken a little bit more.  The sauce was great.  I will be making this again!

added minced onion and sage to the stuffing, which gave it more flavor.  added brown sugar and cinnamon to gravy and swapped the water for chicken broth.  increase qty of stuffing and gravy.  stuffing that didn't fit into chicken i sauted and we ate on the side.

It was good, although a little bland.  I felt like it was missing something.  I might try to add a little celery, and maybe some more spices next time.  And I didn't really thing the bread crumbs were necessary.

Loved this recipe! (with some alterations) like the others have said chicken broth instead of water. Brown sugar is a MUST! it was delicious! one other thing, make sure to DOUBLE this recipe. 2 chicken breasts do not feed 4 people, my husband and i both wanted more.....but overall fantastic recipe.

I added more cheese, apple, and breadcrumbs to the filling. Also, like others have said, instead of cooking the chicken in water and white wine (I hate wine) I used a can of cream of mushroom soup. It turned out fabulous. Really juicy and tender, and it tasted absolutely amazing.

This is a good base recipe, which I used and made a few adjustments of my own.  I used Swiss cheese instead of Cheddar, subbed out the water for chicken stock, and added about a quarter cup of chopped red onion and some additional spices.  Instead of browning the chicken, I just put it in the oven, covered, with the called for liquids and baked at 350 for about a half hour.

We really like this recipe.  It really is easy and very yummy.  I have made it 3 times now and have done it 3 different ways.  The best so far is buying thick breasts and slicing them in half but not cutting all the way through and stuffing them.  The second time I did it I still used toothpicks but tonight I tied it closed and the stuffing stayed in much better.  Rolling it all my filling fell out so I started stuffing them and it's way better.  The flavor seems better stuffing and tying also.  This is one I will make over and over again.

Hubby says these are good! I agree! Caught him eating a cold section I had cut for a picture. He says, this is good, porkchop? LOL! Easy to make, I don't cook with wine so I subbed chicken broth. Thanks for the recipe.

Not bad. A little dry with little flavor. I had to add a lot of extra seasoning and it tasted better. I would not suggest cooking the chicken very long, it will dry out.

loved it! the sauce was wonderful! i used plain breadcrumbs and added some cinnamon with the apple mixture. the only thing i think may add a little more to the recipe is a little bit of salt, maybe in the form of some small bits of ham or bacon.

This was a good recipe. I guess I was hoping for more flavor from the apples and cheese. I think I will look at some of the other suggestions to see how to add to it. Thank you my family enjoyed it.

This recipe was so easy and delicious!!!  The only change I made, was to add lots of extra apple in the pan when I cooked the chicken, added extra wine in order to make more gravy to top it with.  I have made this recipe many times and shared with lots of friends!

I didn't take the time to stuff the chicken, placed the stuffing on top the chicken while it cooked and it turned out great.

Love it! I don't really like fruits with meat but this one is exceptional! I didn't add wine and instead of using breadcrumb,I used oats. I made into a one serving and according to one member, I followed their advice on using the left overs stuffings as a part of the gravy and it still taste REALLY good!! *thumbs up*

I thought this was a very nice, easy recipe to make on a weekday.  My son loved the filling.  He's a hard sell.  
I adjusted the amounts to accomodate a pkg of three chicken breasts. Makes a great meal! I will make this again.

This recipe was fantastic! I added bacon crumbles to the stuffing, which added some flavor. Also, served with leftover apples cooked in butter and wine and used the pan juice in the gravy.

I made this recipe yesterday for me and my husband and it was delicious. I used BLUE CHEESE which was excellent. Still used granny smith apples, regular bread crumbs and 2-3 tabls of butter for the stuffing and seasoned it with curry, cinnamon,etc. as it can be bland without the seasonings.I used sewing thread to wrap around the stuffed chicken to keep it together. I baked it in the oven at 375 degrees 30-35 min. or until no longer pink inside. Near the end of baking it I drizzled it with the sauce part which was my own concoction: wine, apple cider, cinnamon, brown sugar, and some of the left over applesand some of the drippings from the chicken and caramelized in a pan. I will definitely make this again. I highly recommend that you try the blue cheese to give it a kick. Also: I served this with the recipe on here for balsamic apsaragus which is another excellent recipe.

Try using apple juice instead of the stock it will give you a sweeter ending and then you can thicken it with arrowroot slurry and keep a clearer sauce

WONDERFUL... I made several changes however. I used Granny Smith apple and I used sharp chedder cheese. I used the suggestion baking it in the oven and it was wonderful.  I used Brummels and Brown instead of butter and I also put pecans, Cinnamon, and some Cummin in the stuffing. When I browned the chicken in the pan, I used Brummels and Brown, a dash of Parrot Bay Coconut Rum, and I used unrefined Sesame oil. When brown, I put them in the 13x9 and poured the contents from the pan on top.  I then made some additional by melting brummels and brown in the wine, added a touch more cummin,a very small pinch of garlic salt, pepper and I used chicken broth instead of water.  Once this was melted, I poured it on top, baked at 450 for about 35 minutes... TO DIE FOR!!!

This base was wonderful for the gravy too.

I did not roll the chicken first I put it in the pan to brown.  When I relized what I did I went into modify mode.  After chicken browned I made a small slit in the side and put in the stuffing and secured with toothpicks. Added some cinnomin Put chicken back in pan added some cooking wine maybe about 3/4 cup and let chicken simmer for about 20 min, added a little more wine and cornstarch to thicken gravy. Everyone raved!!!

I just made this for my mother and she absolutely loved it!! She was so impressed. I added more cheese, 3 tsps brown sugar and 2 dashs of cinnamon to the filling. Then about 5 minutes after I added the wine/water and it was simmering, I added about 1 and a half tsp of brown sugar to the sauce. When the chicken was out, and I was preparing the gravy, I added a tbps more water, and a tsp of more white wine.

I loved this recipe, it was easy and delicious. I will definatly use this recipe again.

I really was not impressed with this recipe.  It was good but a bit boring.  The stuffing needed more flavor.  I will not be making this again.

After reading the reviews, I decided to add raisins for added flavor. It really turned out to be a great dish and a recipe to use over and over.

I'm giving this four stars because while it wasn't my favorite dish ever, it's got a lot of potential to become really great! It seems that my main complaint is the lack of flavor - maybe after securing the roll-ups with toothpicks (don't forget the sides!) they should be rolled in some type of herb/spice blend so that it can simmer into the chicken for that 15 minutes. The poster who mentioned adding cinnamon to the apples might have something there - the apples did seem to lose a bit of flavor during cooking. Overall, my husband and I each cleaned our plates, so it's something I'll be making again. Especially given the simple ingredients that we always have around anyway, it might be fun to play with different combinations to find one that really makes this dish zing!

One word: YUMMY! The only thing I would like to say is that make sure you make the chicken breast very thin. I did not roll them out that much and I couln't taste much of the filling. Also, use extra apples. (I recomend red delicious + Granny Smith). Another pointer is that make sure you use NON-COLORED toothpicks :-). I did that and some of the color rubed off into the chicken. Not so attractive, right? But, overall this recipe was very delicious and my whole family loved it!

This was the first meal I made for my boyfriend. Since then, we have made a few simplifications for an easy, week night dinner. Instead of stuffing the chicken with apples, I put the apples, along with apple cider, in Uncle Ben's brown rice. Just add the apples and use 1/2 water 1/2 apple cidar for the liquid. Then I pound the cutlets and brown them. I used 1/2 cup apple cidar and 1/2 cup reisling for my broth. Let simmer for 20 minutes. Top everything with extra sharp cheddar cheese (We like Cabot Hunters Cheddar). It feels special for a Tuesday night dinner.

Great recipe. I used the extra spices others suggested: thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, touch of cinnamon. I used 1/2 cup apple sauce and 1/2 cup chicken broth and added about a tablespoon of brown sugar to the drippings after I removed the chicken breasts.

Yum!  Just finished dinner & it was delicious. Like most people, I tweaked it just a bit. I used stuffing mix instead of breadcrumbs. Made pockets in the breasts, stuffed w/the apple mixture, the closed them up & tied them with strings. This kept them closed pretty well. For the sauce I used apple cider instead of wine, and added just about 1 tbls brown sugar and a half of an apple, chopped.  It was tender and scrumptious. Will definitely make this one again.

I thought this was really great. I listened to some of the other ideas, and decided to go ahead with more Cheddar cheese, more bread crumbs, brown sugar, cinnamon, salt, garlic salt, Italian seasoning and curry. After mixing all that together, I rolled the breasts, but didn't have any toothpicks, so it was a little messy. After browning the "rolls" I ended up putting in a mug full of hot apple cider instead of the wine and let the chicken simmer in that for 25 minutes. That was a little long (I was on the phone) and the chicken was a little dry, but the overall it was really good. For the gravy, I just used a little flour and about 2 tablespoons of the leftover juices and made a roo, then put that in to make the gravy.

My stuffing came out more like the consistency of applesauce, rather than a thick cheesy apple stuffing.  So, if I attempt to make this again I will use stuffing instead of breadcrumbs.  The overall flavors were not all that complimentary.

This was really tastey. However, I did add some ingredient that were not listed. I added a couple of sprinkles of garlic powder, about a Tbsp of cinnamon, a packet of Splenda (it could be replaced with sugar if desired),along with salt and pepper. It sounds like an odd combination, but it really gave the dish  that sweetness and really brought out the taste of the apples. I would definitely make it again!

I used this recipe to make a special meal for members of my family - real connoisseurs. It was actually very easy to prepare, served up lovely and received many compliments. For my tastebuds, it needs a pinch more salt and spices, which I have yet to fine-tune. Lovely!

I read the review from SIMPLYRAINAH and followed the suggestions and a bit more.  I added a teaspoon more curry to finish the sauce and some flour to thicken it.  It was well received by all.

Really good and so different from the ordinary.  I seasoned the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I added curry powder, onion powder, cinnamon, and brown sugar to the stuffing along with more bread crumbs.  I tied the chicken breasts with twine so they'd stay together while cooking.  For the sauce I omitted water and used white wine and apple cider instead, and added the extra stuffing mixture to pan 10 degrees before the chicken was done(so at 150 degrees).  Took the chicken out of the pan at 160 degrees, added more brown sugar, some corn starch and water to the sauce.  Next time I'll add more cheese to the stuffing mix.  Great recipe!

Pretty good, different and easy. I didn't have any white wine so instead I substituted apple cider and chicken broth, no water. Thickened the sauce with the extra filling instead of cornstarch...yummy..the cheese melted the sauce had little bits of apple. Thanks for sharing!

This is really good.  I followed one of the other poster's advice and added curry along with other spices.  My husband absolutely loves it.  I've screwed up before and forgotten the bread crumbs and the cheese and just sprinkled those ingredients on the chicken in the pan and it's still good!  One of the best.

I read the reviews and feared having flavorless chicken, so I made a few changes and had absolutely NO problem with lack of flavor. I added cinnamon to the apple(granny smith)/cheese/bread crumb mixture and also seasoned the chicken after pounding it out with salt, pepper and garlic salt. I also added a slice of butter to the inside of the chicken when rolling it up (kinda like chicken kiev). I replaced the water with half apple cider and half chicken broth and left the amount of wine the same. It came out perfect, and I was told by one of my guests that it was honestly the best chicken he's ever had.

I was so excited to make this dish...and when all was said and done, I found it to be completely underwhelming.  Not enough taste - and I really dislike nothing more than bland food.  After looking at the ingredient list, I did choose to season my chicken with garlic powder, onion powder, salt and pepper (very liberally, on both sides before adding the stuffing mixture) and even that couldn't save this.  If I could offer suggestions...I would say to season the heck out of the chicken, stuff it and then roll it in some additional breadcrumbs (use Panko if you can...they are far better).  Also, while the chicken is set to simmer, DO NOT use the water, but instead double the wine or add chicken broth in place.  I added about 4oz of fresh mushrooms during the simmer stage and all I can say is thank goodness I did - they were the best part of the meal.  Oh, and maybe adding more cheese and some crumbled bacon wouldn't be a bad idea either.  Sorry, I am glad I tried but not so sure I want to take the chance with this one again....thanks anyway.

Very, very good.  I used swiss cheese and rye bread crumbs (what I had on hand) and substituted apple cider and chicken broth for the liquids.

Following some of the reviews I also made some changes. I added 1 tsp. apple pie spice to stuffing. Also about 5 minutes before chicken was done I added another diced apple to sauce with 1 tsp. apple pie spice and 1/4 cup brown sugar. I served the thickened sauce over baby carrots. Went great with the (Wild Rice with Rosemary and Cashew Stuffing)as a side. A wonderful meal.

This was really good.  I doubled the gravy, and used chicken broth instead of water.  I skipped the toothpicks and just wrapped the breasts using cooking string.  It took so little time for such a nice dish.

This was so good, I want to make it again tonight!  I took one reviewers' suggestion and stuffed the chicken breast rather than rolling it.  Next time I will pound out the chicken and roll it.  I didn't have any white wine so I substituted chicken broth.  It came out so good and so simple.  Definitely a "30 minute meal".  The only thing I would do next time is quadruple the sauce and serve the sauce over white rice.  Thank you for this recipe.  I would use this to serve to company!

This is an awesome recipe! I made it for my friends and they loved it. Also it looks and sounds very fancy so they were all impressed even though it was actually very simple to make. I added bacon the second time I made it to give it a bit more flavor, but it taste great without as well.

Not as good as the effort implied... you can't even taste the cheese and it took MUCH longer to cook that i would have thought.  With perhaps a dash of cinnamon, a couple whole cloves, some rasins, a red-onion relish or something, this could be very tastey.  Needs some work to please my hubby and me!  (But all over not a horrible recipe, just needs adjusting.)

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and both my husband and I thought it was great.  I did have to add more liquid while I was cooking the chicken, but other than that it turned out great.  Also, instead of using Italian style bread crumbs, I used some stale bread I had in the freezer and added a little sage, rosemary, and thyme to the stuffing mixture.

This was simple and awesome. I followed suggestions and made more sauce. I also added chopped mushroom, chopped onions and used chicken broth in place of water. I marinated chicken in olive oil and garlic (got to have garlic)with Italian spices for 1 hour. Also chopped apples very small which made it easier to roll and added more larger chopped apples to sauce which came out tasting like baked apples in sauce. A real keeper

This sounded great until I started making it--then I became skeptical.  I wasn't sure about how to stuff/roll....  I added s & p & cinnamon to the chicken.  I doubled the sauce.  It was excellent!  My husband (who doesn't normally like "fruity" main dishes) said it was really good.  Both of my kids ate their whole serving.  The key is the sauce--definitely double it.  I served with mashed potatoes.  Will definitely make again.

This was delicious!  My whole family (including kids) loved it.  I didn't do it exactly as stated, though.  I removed the chicken from the pan after browning, deglazed with the wine, made a roux (I needed more butter) and then added Chicken Broth, before returning chicken to pan.  Not sure if this changed the recipe, I may try it the original way next time.

Bland.  Even when I added cinnamin and sugar.  I even coated the chicken with seasoned bread crumbs, but it still was very bland.  The sauce turned to gel and did not add any flavor, it just made the house smell like booze.

Would maybe try it again, if the chicken breast was marinated.

This recipe was pretty good.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and used chicken stock instead of water and also added a little cinnamon.  I used granny smith apples and felt that the dish could have used a little more sweetness.  If I make this dish again I would probably add some brown sugar to the apple cheese mixture.  Overall though, I really enjoyed it.

I'm on the fence with this one... The other reviews are correct - this recipe definitely needs more "spice". I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 2 tbsp of brown sugar to the mix... didn't help much. I also salted and peppered the chicken (much better). This one definitely needs some TLC to work, but the foundation is there for a great recipe.

This recipe could use a lot of spices.  I added garlic salt and pepper which helped a little, but the taste was still pretty bland.  I thought that the apple flavor would have been stronger.  It was edible, but not fabulous.

Great Recipe! My husband and I both loved it. The flavor was terrific. I doubled the recipe for 3 chicken breasts though, and it still turned out delicious. I intend to share this recipe with family and friends. Its definitely a keeper.

Quite Delicious!! I would give it all 5 stars (which I have only given to very few recipies) but the recipie didn't call for enough spices in the chicken, I think. Though quite flavorful and nice and moist, I found that the chicken breast needed some salt and could have used some pepper or another spice to compliment the apples.. Maybe some cinamon or ground cloves would have been interesting! I will definitely make this again!

This is a delicious recipe-the apples if chopped small enough add a nice sweet flavor to the recipe.  Everyone I made it for was skeptical and then ended up loving it!!!!

This was pretty good, but I don't know if I'll make it again because it was a little fiddly and my husband and son weren't that crazy about it.  I'm neither a novice nor a cordon bleu cook, but I had a terrible time getting the stuffing to stay in.  I had to use so many toothpicks that the chicken looked more like porcupine!  I expected the stuffing to have more flavor, but as some others have said, it was fairly bland (I used Granny Smith apples).  The chicken was very moist and tender, though.

I thought this was an "okay" recipe. Considering how much extra effort it took to buy items I don't normally stock (a whole box of seasoned bread crumbs just for 2T for example), as well as prep time that was a little time consuming, I think it would have been just as easy to buy a box of chicken helper and throw some cheese on top. I wouldn't have minded the extra effort if the results had been a little better, but I thought this recipe was, at best, "not bad."

Not the recipe to try if you're in a hurry. Stuffing the breasts takes some time. It was delicious and my husband devoured it. I would go with a different sauce next time.

My family enjoyed thid recipe. There is plenty of room for adaption. I didn't quite have all of the listed ingredients. I improvised and used blue cheese and chopped walnuts in the stuffing in place of the cheddar cheese. It was a hit.

This was good . I will try again. I used white wine, apple juice and chicken broth (better than bouillon chicken) in the recipe to make more sauce.
I sliced the remaining apple and saute'ed along  with a small yellow onion cut into slices. I sauté's chicken rolls, removed from the pan, added apple and onion slices to the pan. Deglazed with wine, added apple sauce and broth. Returned  chicken rolls  to the pan and finished cooking in a 400 degree F oven for about 30 - 35 minutes. (I used meat thermometer set at 165 degrees F). I added more seasonings to bread mixture. Garlic, salt, lemon pepper blend and a blend of herbs.  I used a honey crisp apple because that is what I had on hand. I used 2 Tablespoons mild cheddar and added 2 Tablespoons sharp cheddar cheese. I did not use cornstarch ( or add sugar as suggested by other reviews as our family's diet)  I think a more tart apple would have improved the taste.  Overall it was good. The chicken turned out great but I was hoping for a more flavorful bite from the stuffing. Maybe because I didn't use a tart apple.  would give 5 stars if it had more flavor. I will try again using granny smith or other tart apple variety.

Chicken was very dry. I dont have a 7 in skillet so I made it in a ten inch and added a little more butter, wine, and water. There is also no salt in this recipe. Luckily I know to never not salt my chicken, but if you are an inexperienced cook, please remember to do this. It is really important. Maybe using chicken stock instead of water would make it more moist, but the gravy was extremely flavorful without it. Next time will use more cheese as well. Still enjoyable, but the dryness left it wanting.

This was a 10/10 in my book! Didn’t have toothpicks haha so I broke up some wooden chopsticks. Didn’t have wax paper, but used a gallon zip lock bag. The chicken was tender and the red wine sauce was delicious! My side dish was an apple pumpkin couscous mix I got at Walmart. Seriously a delicious meal I could eat once a week!!!!!!

This didn't come out very great. It was tender and juicy, but 6 minutes of browning total was insufficient, and the stuffing was bland. I would encourage you to heed the advice of those here who suggest browning it beautifully before moving on to the next steps, seasoning the filling heavily (and maybe adding more cheese, the sharpest you can find), and seasoning the outside heavily. I'll probably try this again though I'm considering breading and baking it after rolling. I use twine to tie off my rolled meats, it just works better for me than toothpicks, though it leaves a twine-shaped impression in the end product which isn't as beautiful as the way toothpicks get the job done. This has the potential to be an appley, cheesy treat, but it isn't there yet even on the site with the tweaks from other users and certainly not there yet in the magazine. Please heed the tweaks of others before spending a lot of time on this one!

Great chicken, fairly easy recipe. Apple was not the strongest flavor for us, the Italian seasoning was more prevalent, but juicy delicious chicken regardless. My breasts were tiny so I used three and still couldn't fit all the filling in them. The gravy was lovely. Thanks Behr for sharing the recipe!

Absolutely a great recipe!  Followed a few of the previous reviewers' suggestions and added additional seasonings. Rolling was difficult, but manageable. I will butterfly the chicken breasts next time to save time. Family loved it!

One of the best dishes I've made from this app! I did make some changes--for the stuffing I used apple, brown sugar, cinnamon, plain bread crumbs, and blue cheese. I had extra stuffing and apple chunks that I added to the juices to simmer for about 5-10 min. That thickened it up enough that I didn't need to add the cornstarch. I also substituted the water with chicken broth.

In apple mixture I added a bit more cheese and lots more breadcrumbs with a bit of cinnamon and brown sugar. While chicken was cooking I added more apples and than when chicken was done I added a bit brown sugar to juices and than poured it over the chicken. With these changes it was delicious.

As written, this recipe is good enough to make again, but missing something, hence the four star rating. I made it four times before I found what works for me:
1. Slice the cheese instead of shredding. It's much easier to roll up and allows you to throw any extra stuffing into the sauce. Yum!
2. Add a pinch of thyme to the stuffing.
3. Sprinkle the stuffed breasts with a little salt & pepper before browning.
4. Sub chicken broth for the water in the wine/water mixture.

My meat-and-potatoes husband was all over this!

Just Ok.  Could have easily put potatoes instead of apples, as the apples lose the taste after cooking.  Would not make again.

My family and I love this recipe.  I have made this twice and have followed the one review that is tagged as most helpful.  It is a bit labor intesive but well worth it.  Full of flavor and always a hit.  Would recommend this for smaller gatherings or just immediate family.  Made it for 16 and was hard to get the balance of all of the burners so that everything was done at the same time.

I only gave this 4 stars because I altered it a tad.  I stuffed it according to the recipe and then wrapped it in a piece of bacon.  I was doing 8 chicken breasts so I didn't pan fry them I put then in a 350 oven in a deep pan for about an hour and added the juices in later, then to make the sauce I dumped the juice out into a skillet to thicken.  I was serving 1 recovering alcholoic so I put his in a seperate pan and used chicken broth in place of the wine for his sauce.  He said it was wonderful.  I did have extra stuffing which I sauted in the butter before making the sauce, it added to it.  I will be making this again.  I served it with baked carrots, crash hot potatoes, homemade bread, a tossed salad, and for desert an upside down chocolate cake.

Everytime I have made this dish I have gotten lots of compliments.  Something is always a winner if my husband finishes and is up for more before I'm even half-way through mine.  The glaze really makes this dish, and I have used cheddar and manchego cheese and a bit of cumin in the apple mix.  It's divine and easy.

I found this on another website so I did not have the advantage of reading other reviews before making it. I found this to be incredibly bland and a waste not only of two chicken breasts but also a quarter-cup of white wine. I must say I don't understand someone giving a recipe 4 or 5 stars and calling it 'outstanding' when what they actually cooked wasn't anything like the recipe given.

This was delicious, and surprisingly easy to make.  It smelled wonderful while cooking.  I used broth instead of water, and added some seasoning to the pan while simmering.  Served with mashed potatoes & broccoli.  My husband loved it, but my 1 & 4 year old boys didn't care for it.  I'll probably make it again, but not too frequently because of the kids.  It is hard to get this to look like the picture, so dont have that expectation.  Also, this chicken definitely needs the gravy, dont serve it without!  :)  Yum!

I followed the directions. It was not terrible, but it definately matters which apple you choose, and whether you peel them or not. I suggest peeling them, I did not like the texture.  I also think the apple /crumbs/cheese ration could have been better. more cheese definately. I would also try different cheeses too. Not bad, just not that impressive to me.

This is a great recipe!  My husband and I love it!  The only change I'm going to make next time is, instead of pounding and rolling up the chicken breast, I'm going to butterfly them and stuff them.  The apple chunks made it difficult to roll and I had to use way too many toothpicks to keep them together.  But, paired with a sweet potato or a corn casserole, this is a perfect, healthy fall dish!  It's a good base recipe, too.  Feel free to season it however you wish!

Excellent and easy. I did however add spices (cinnamon, nutmeg and thyme). I usually change spices in most recipes to suit the my taste.

have never flattened chicken before, so this was an experience. I used a pink lady apple, added about a quarter of a vidalia onion chopped up, and used plain bread crumbs with Italian seasoning (what I had available.) Also, used chicken broth instead of wine and water (again, available.) Hubby didn't love the onions, but dd and I were squabbling over the stuffing mix that didn't make it into the chicken breasts - delicious!! I served with rice cooked in chicken broth. Oh, made one of the three chicken breasts without the apple in the stuffing (picky eater) and she said that was delicious, too. Yumm!

Thank you,  this made an easy Tuesday night dinner i used chicken stock as opposed to wine and just seasoned the chicken lightly with a sprinkle of pepper.  I loved the uncomplicated flavours it was really great and will definitely make this again.

I listened to most of the reviewers, and added 1 T cinnamon, 1 T brown sugar, and a handful of Craisins.  I used chicken broth instead of wine/water, and it added more flavor.  I was nervous about the cheese/apple combo, but you couldn't even tell there was cheese in there!  It was sooooo amazing.  I made it with stuffing and corn on the cob, and it was such a great Fall dinner!  Highly recommend it.

Spices are definitely necessary and I preferred to bake it which took about 40 minutes. Not sure if we'll make this again would probably change the stuffing some how though it gave it good flavor it was missing texture. A reviewer suggested walnuts but no nuts for us.

I didn't like this at all; it was very difficult to make and very messy. It also didn't have a lot of flavor at all. It did look very pretty when I got it on the plate though.

This is awesome! Instead of Italian bread crumbs, I used crushed Rice Krispies with a little Italian seasoning. I am trying to watch how much food I fry, so I baked it in the water and wine, Turned out perfectly.

I was really excited to try this because I had all the ingredients on hand....and then discovered my hubby ate the last apple.  So, I sliced a handful of cherry tomatoes (very thinly) and added them to the cheese/breadcrumbs mix.  It was great.  I also added a miscellanous pinches of seasonings. (seasoned salt, curry, black pepper and Mrs. Dash)  Garlic and onions in the skillet.

Great recipe!  Made some changes because of what I had on hand.  I made crumbs with whole wheat bread and Italian seasonings and added a pinch of brown sugar and cinnamon like many suggested.  I used mozzarella since that's what I had and gala apples.  I butterflied the chicken, stuffed and rolled it and seasoned the outside with salt and pepper.  I deglazed with apple cider and chicken stock since I had no wine and wanted more flavor than water would add.  I served this with steamed brown rice and the sauce was amazing over the normally bland rice.  I would suggest upping the liquid for the sauce to at least 1/3 cup since I love a lot of sauce.  Two chicken breasts fed my husband and myself.  I will make this again definatly.

The chicken was very moist and an easy recipe to make. I just feel like there is something missing in the recipe to make it perfect. Maybe browing the chicken really good before simmering in broth.

My husband loved this dish! I used shredded Parmesan instead of cheddar. The first time I made it, I made my own breadcrumbs. I just toasted some whole grain bread , then put it in my Cuisinart and added Italian seasoning. The second time I used PANKO breadcrumbs.They are truly the best kind of bread crumbs. I also made an egg wash and breaded the chicken with the Panko crumbs which was successful! In regards to the sauce, I added some brown sugar (1tb or so). Oh, and instead of water to simmer the chicken in I used chicken broth like other reviewers recommended.

This was really good!  We added some bacon bits and thyme to the stuffing for a little bit of extra flavor.  Also we'd recommend anyone to substitute chicken stock for the water.

This did not come out at all how i anticipated. As it cooked, the water leached out and it was a little too watery, the apples were soft and the cheese melted out before the chicken was done cooking.

Didn't care for this recipe. Tasted kind of bland to me. Probably wouldn't make again.

Fantastic....I added walnuts to the stuffing and a little brown sugar to the gravy.  I so could see adding some raisins or dried cranberries to the stuffing as well the next time.  We loved it!

I am always looking for recipies that my picky children (7, 4 and 1) will eat and this was a big success. And easy to make (which is important to me!) Instead of flattening and rolling the chicken I cut it in half and put the filling in (like a sandwich) and it worked well.

I really hate it when people make major changes to a recipe and then proclaim it terrible. But this time I made some changes and came out with an excellent dish that picky DH and I loved. I quickly realized I had to butterfly my chicken breasts since they were really thick.  I used the often-suggested brown sugar/cinnamon addition with the apples, browned the chicken in olive oil, and used all chicken broth for the cooking liquid. I also added in a chopped shallot with the broth  (simply because I had to use it or lose it...I'll probably chop a bit of onion when I make it next time.)  The cornstarch pan sauce is SO simple. Even a novice cook could impress company with this dish.

this recipe is BLAND!! I was extremely disappointed. The concept is good, though. If I were to make it again I'd be sure to add more cheese (which I actually did, but it still needed more) and some brown sugar and cinnamon. The only way I saved this dish from being a total disaster was by adding sugar and cinnamon to the gravy.

Delicious low cal meal.  I did season the chicken and browned well in alittle butter and olive oil. Then added minced shallots to the pan while cooking.  I also used chicken broth instead of water and the sauce was yummy with the shallots.  I will make this dish again.

Add cranberries to stuffing. Used Granny Smith Apples. Sauce evaporated quickly so I would either turn it down lower or increase wine and water.

I read other comments and so I changed it as well. It was fabulous! For the stuffing I used half of a Pink Lady apple sliced into tiny chunks, a few tbsp of soy cheddar cheese, and 3/4 of a slice of toasted whole grain bread (I didn't have breadcrumbs), and some spices to kick it up (salt and pepper, poultry seasoning, and cayenne chili powder). I put fresh salt and pepper on the outside of the chicken once it was stuffed then cooked it as it says in the recipe. I also used all chicken broth instead of water and wine. I used extra to make more gravy since my husband loves gravy. It was delicious. It looked like it took way more effort than what it actually took. I will be cooking this again!

My boyfriend and I really liked this recipe! We were pleasantly surprised at how the tiny amount of apples, cheese and breading made a big difference to a standard chicken breast. We have added this recipe to our favorites and will definitely make it again. The reason I have given it 4 out of 5 stars is because stuffing a chicken breast always gets at least a tiny bit complicated, and we really prefer "quick and easy" recipes. But that is a pretty minor downside considering that this is a different, fairly healthy recipe that can be made from things most people already have in the house!

I made this for my fiance and myself and it was really good. Ours didn't turn out as pretty as the picture mainly because I used chicken breast tenderloins. I also had a lot of apples fall out but I think it is because I used the smaller cuts of chicken. I thought it was pretty good and my fiance loved it. So if I could give it four and a half stars I would.

I will definitely be making this one again.  I was out of wine so just used water with some of the leftover apple chunks thrown in.  It made a great sauce to drizzle over.  Also: I added about a tablespoon of apple sauce to the stuffing.  It was essential to getting it all to hold together.

I wasn't too pleased with this recipe. I found the flavor to be very bland and i even added more spices then what the recipe called for. If I do try this one again, I think I'll add more cheese as well. Thanks for the unique recipe though

It was alright, but pretty bland. I took some of the suggestions from the other reviews and added cinnamon, thyme, basil, garlic, and a little bit of brown sugar to the apple mix and that tasted great. my problem was with the chicken. It didn't seem to absorb any of the bite of the wine. Next time, I'll marinate it in some olive oil and spices first.

The chicken was hard to flip with the toothpicks in it. Needless to say, I made a huge mess, but the stuffing was delicious, and a great way to use up leftover things I had around the kitchen.

I think this deserves 4.5 stars really.  I followed this recipe exactly as written and it came out great.  The cheese was a bit hard to detect, and I may not have browned mine long enough to get good color, but otherwise this tasted great.  Thanks!

This dish was really good.  The other reviewers' tips really helped with adding a little seasoning to the chicken.  I too (as another reviewer did) slit the sides of the chicken & stuffed it that way.  Next time I may try wrapping.  Thanks to those who advised me on how to sub for the dry white wine.  I used white grape juice and it was really good.  Will defintely make again.

It was good, but not brilliant. In my opinion, the taste was kind of bland. I added extra salt and pepper - and a lot of cheese. I like how the cheese melts as I cut open the chicken. I had used Fuji Apples, which might have been a little too sweet for this recipe (I'm not really good with choosing the right apples), but the taste was still okay; still bland, but okay.

This was really good and made an impressive presentation.  It is also really easy -- the hardest part is wrapping the chicken around the stuffing. I didn't have toothpicks so I used uncooked spaghetti, which held just long enough for the chicken to bind and then just softened and cooked.  I also did not have cheddar cheese so I used asiago.  Like others, I also seasoned the chicken and added oregano and thyme while it was cooking.  I served it with pan roasted potatoes and peas. I'll make this again and often!

A really good recipe.  This was my first time experimenting with stuffed chicken breast and it was surprisingly easy to make.  The smell once you pour in the wine to simmer the chicken is great and makes it for an enjoyable cooking experience.  I used olive oil instead of butter or margarine, and used whole wheat multigrain bread for the crumbs.  Definitely would recommend this one.

The chicken was so good! The only thing I really had to modify was the amount of water added to make the gravey. I cut the recipe for two servings, and there wasn't enough juices really for any gravey so I added some of the leftover apples, some more water, and the cornstart and it was great! We served it with brown rice cooked in chicken broth- it was excellent!

My family and I just finished eating and I had to run to the computer to review!! This recipe was phenomenal!  I had to use a little more liquid to adjust the sauce thickness, but other than that, it was great. I will be making this again!

The recipe has a lot of potential but only turned out so-so. The dish retained strong flavor from the apples and the white wine, so i'm going to have to work out a combination of those two that we like better before I can try this again.

This was really good. I followed the tips of Simplyrainah's review, except I didn't have any boullion so I used water as the recipe said. It was great. My hubby asked me to add to his list of favorites (which isn't very long).  e is very hard to amuse and if says something, it has got to be great. I served it with chicken rice that I stirred frozen broccoli into. I will definitely be making this one again.

Eh. Not a great recipe. My husband and I both finished our portions, but it wasn't that enjoyable. I tried to spruce it up with some brown sugar and spices, but the end result was kind of weird. The flavors do not really compliment each other. I won't be making this again.

Great recipe. Easy to follow & the taste is magnifiscent!!! My second time making this dish, I tried to add some ingredients like onions & cilantro since they are my fav's, but didn't come out the same way. Good but not the way I made it the first time with the recipe..

I had some leftover chicken breasts that were a tad on the dry side, so instead of using this as a stuffing, I made an apple chicken skillet out of it. I added about 5 small garlic cloves (slivered), a bunch of ground pepper, and salt to taste. (I didn't use bread crumbs since it wasn't for stuffing, but that might be why I needed to add salt and pepper). Oh, and I threw in some coarsely chopped walnuts. I sprinkled the Cheddar over the top and served with rice. Next time I'll make this recipe for my chicken from the start instead of using it to doctor up leftovers. Excellent!

This just didn't knock my socks off. The flavor was OK (used Granny Smith apple as that was all I had in the fridge). It seemed like more work than it was worth for the result.

My family loved this recipe, they said it was almost like a dessert. I did use a can of chicken broth instead of water and wine and added some brown sugar and cinnamon per earlier review. It was perfect with rice. Very nice gravy.

This recipe, was one I got off this site for a quick fix, Although it was pretty easy I found it lacked something, more spices!! I didn't take the other reviewers advice, and I just made it by the book.
I guess it might be good after you add all kinds of spices, but I wont be making it again.

The recipe was very tasty but didn't "wow" my family.  I would recommend this as a safe dish to serve to guests, if you are uncertain of their food/taste preferences.  It's delicious without being overly spicy or sweet.

this was a little tricky at first, but i'm sure after making it a couple times, it be easier.  I used a Jonamac apple, and it was so sweet and soft, just perfect with my well-cooked chicken.  Great fall-time recipe.

I really like this recipe--with some changes.  I use only chicken broth for the liquid, double the stuffing.  I'm not super careful about getting all the stuffing inside the chicken roll-up--you really can't anyway.  So when I'm thickening the sauce I have the  rest of the stuffing in the pan also and pour over the breasts.  They still taste delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe.

My son made this for us for dinner last night and it was quite good.  He used Gala apples, and the flavor was delicate.  I would be curious to try this one with a tart apple, just to add some kick to the flavor. Also, I think I might try it with a smoked cheddar. Definately will try this one again.

great recipe!  i used chicken thighs instead of breast and fresh bread crumbs with italian seasonings instead.  Upped and added a buncha spices too.  I had left over chopped apples so I added that to juices and it added oomph to the gravy later on.

Oh my gosh, another winner. We made for just our kids, a big hit. We made for a dinner party and another big hit!!! It is super easy and quick. Just yummy! It's light and chicken (good chicken) cooks up so tender. No flavor here over powers and it blends so well together. Yummy!

This dish has a very good taste.Really enjoyed the flavors.I just couldn't keep the suffing inside the breast as it cooked.I could be doing something wrong with the way I roll the breast.But it still makes a good sauce over the chiken.

I will try this again with one major change.  DON'T use red wine unless you can bear to look at a gruesome, plum colored sauce.  It tasted good, but the appearance was a put off.  Don't marinate the chicken first, as it overpowers the stuffing.  Do pound the chicken thin and do make extra sauce.Do brown the chicken really well before simmering. The chicken does stay moist and tender. Try the original first, though, and THEN improvise.  I agree you can't taste the cheese, but it does help w/ stuffing consistency.  Think light, white sauce, and it will be awesome! I'll try again that way and imagine it will be 5 stars! THanks!

The chicken breasts I used were very large, so I ended up cutting them into small cubes while they were browning. I added the rest of the ingredients and it turned out quite well. This recipe has a lot of flavor!

It sounded so great, but I think the cheddar cheese really ruined it!  In the future, I may try to replace the cheese with something sweet and/or savory rather than sour and salty.  It really has potential.

My recommendation is to make sure you brown the chicken enough.  If you don't, it's not a very attractive dish.  I found this recipe to be yummy but not as flavorful as I would have liked.  I think it would have been more  successfully executed if the outside of the chicken was breaded & baked, instead.  Regardless, it was a pleasing dish.

Yum! I made it with parmesan cheese and it was delish. Family loved it.  Make sure you cut the chicken length wise first to make sure the chicken will wrap all the way around the stuffing.

I simplified this recipe and it still tastes great.  I breaded the chicken breasts and filled it with one slice of cheese, thin pieces of apple and pepperidge farm stuffing.  I rolled the chicken and put it in a baking pan with chicken broth.  (add seasonings to chicken)  Baked in oven for 35-45 minutes.  Thank you.

I wished that I had read reviews a little farther back as the chicken needs to be seasoned before rolling up the stuffing.  I never follow a recipe exactly so here are my alterations.  I don't measure so here goes.  To the stuffing mix I added some cinnamon, apple pie spice, curry and currants.  I just added spices until it smelled right.  To the gravy I added the leftover stuffing which I made extra on purpose, more wine, no water, a couple of splashes of half-n-half, brown sugar, about a tablespoon of maple syrup, curry, salt, and pepper.  I reduced the gravy down for a couple of minutes then pureed it to take care of the apple chunks.  The gravy was awesome!  The chicken was very good with the stuffing that I made, couldn't see or taste the chedder even though I used twice as much.  I think that the chicken would have been much better if I had seasoned it before I stuffed it with some salt and pepper at the very least. Overall, it's a good recipe to get started on and add your own touches to! I will be making this again, it was a hit with company over for dinner.

Quite tasty!  There was a request from my family to have more of the filling... but I don't think any more would have fit inside the chicken!  Maybe add some chopped apples to the gravy and drizzle them on?

I followed SIMPLYRAINAH's recommendations and the meal was fantastic. However, following the recipe as is would be a bit bland and thus the 3 stars.

Very Yummy.  My mom and her husband stop by at the last minute and I had to come up with a meal using chicken.  Came across this as I had most of the ingredients already.  I used granny smith apples which I nuked for a minute just to soften a bit before adding plain bread crumbs & cheese.  I also spiced it up with some Mrs. Dash seasoning.  I found by softening the apples a bit before made rolling up the breasts easier.  I used red wine in the sauce as that is what I had on hand and it turned out beautifully.  Next time I make I think I will try using a pepper jack cheese for a bit more flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe wasn't bad - but it wasn't fantastic either.  I followed the recipe exactly with exception to the water - I used chicken broth instead.  The gravy was good, but there wasn't very much of it....we may try this again...but it was definitely missing something...I just don't know what!

Anticipating issues with keeping this stuffing in the chicken, I hit it with the food processor for a minute, helped to keep it in place.  

Overall, it came out flat..little to no taste.  Maybe next time I will add some brown sugar and use a more tart apple.

My husband and I liked this, but I had trouble getting the chicken cooked all the way through. We had to put it into the microwave to finish cooking. In the seasoning I added onion salt, italian seasoning, tiny bit of red crushed pepper, cinnamon, and a little brown sugar. My husband liked it alot, but next time I'll have to either cook it longer or make the chicken pieces thinner.

I just got done making this dish. I was looking for something different to do w/ chicken breasts. Since I had wine and shredded cheddar on hand, I decided to try it. It was pretty good, although it was missing something. I added salt and pepper to the stuffing mixture after reading it was a little bland, but it didn't seem to add much kick. The wine gave it a nice flavor, but it still needed something. Maybe cinnamon or nutmeg to go w/ the apples, or some fresh garlic in the wine sauce.

I thought this was excellent - my hubby didn't though.  He said he expected it to be sweeter, but he didn't know I was using Granny Smith apples!  He told me the next time to "jazz it up a little".  Maybe I'll try it with a sweeter apple next time.  Personally, I wouldn't have changed a thing!

This was a great recipe for us b/c we eat so much chicken that we run out of "creative" ways to cook it.  I made 4 breasts and changed things up a bit.  I added some cinnamon and light brown sugar to my apple mixture.  Also, I didn't have white wine on hand so I used all chicken broth for the simmering liquid.  AND I used milk and cornstarch instead of water...thought it would make the gravy creamier.  I only gave it four stars b/c there is a spice missing and I couldn't figure it out.  SO good though!  My husband was a huge fan and that really surprised me.  Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty, though a little hard to put together.  Definitely up the apple quantity.  I think next time I might marinate the chicken in apple cider and some spices to add some zing.

This is a strange recipe.  I appreciate the novelty of it, but the time and effort it took to make was not worth it in the end.  It needs less apple, more cheese, and more breadcrumbs to make it be a crowd-pleaser.  But kudos to the the author for your invention!

This is a great recipe as is, but I did change it a bit. I doubled the stuffing mix, and  used apple juice instead of water. I put the unused stuffing in the liquid to simmer along with two tablespoons of brown sugar.  This really created a delicious sauce. This dish is easy to make and impressive enough to serve to company. I will definitely make it again.

Followed recipe except added 1/4 cup butter to apple mixture and used one cup of cheese, as well as salt and pepper on the chicken itself.  This was excellent.

Very tasty recipe. I used Gala apples.  I used white wine totally not wine and water.  My only suggestion is more liquid is needed when using cornstarch to make the gravy, otherwise it is more like library paste.  But with the added liquid, it was very good.  To make a better presentation I sprinkled paprika to give it a little color.

This is a fantastic recipe.

I made it Monday, making enough for a second meal, which we had today.

Each night we had it we looked at each other amazed at the flavors.

Apple sure seems to add a unique flavor. 

It was moist and delicious, and it is a keeper.

Thanks to the chef.

I tried this in the oven like another reviewer, and it didn’t come out right.  Sauce didn’t thicken, not even a little, and the flavor was Bland with capital B.  I gave an extra star because of what I may have done wrong.  Thanks anyway, but I don’t think I’ll make this again.

I added pecans to the stuffing, and used chicken stock in the simmer. I made a bit more of the gravy to spoon over the chicken and egg noodles. Delicious! Definitely a keeper . We loved it.

It came out good.. substituted the water for chicken broth, put some brown sugar in the bread crumb mixture.  Next time I will cut the breast in half instead of flattening between wax because I felt they were still too thick.  It looked sexy, tasted a tad bland.  I'll make it again with more seasoning.

The flavour of this dish is absolutely amazing. The only thing that I changed was with browning the chicken breasts - I used only 1/2 Tbsp. Of butter which was ample in my nonstick pan.
This recipe is easy to make and hubby enjoyed it as much as I did!!!

I made this recipe but did add brown sugar, cinnamon and pecans to the apple stuffing. I also added fresh mushrooms to the pan then added the wine and water. It was delicious. Definitely will make again and definitely company worthy.

This recipe was easier to make than I had expected, but I found the end product OK, but not exceptional.  I didn't have any white wine, so used a mix of dry vermouth & dry sherry, and substituted chicken broth for the water.  I also followed other reviewer's suggestions, and added a little cinnamon & curry powder, subbed blue cheese for the cheddar cheese and added the remaining apple mix to the sauce.  I didn't care for the mix of apples and chicken.  I might make it again, but it won't be any time soon.

I will definitely make this again.  Great flavor.  I did follow a few suggestions of others.  I used apple cider in place of water.  sliced cheddar in place of grated and cubed bread in place of Italian-style bread crumbs, because it made it more like a stuffing.  I used about 1/2 tsp of dried sage , rosemary and 3 tbsp brown sugar in with the bread crumbs. Because I planned to bake it in the oven, I dredged the breasts in flour then egg wash and Italian-style bread crumbs.    I had thin sliced chicken breasts and they worked okay, although the stuffing was falling out some what .  Next time I will use regular chicken breasts and flattened  them. I sauteed the chicken then put it in  the oven to finish. at 375 degrees  for about 20 minutes.

Total lack of flavor will keep me from using this recipe in the future. Needs a serious addition of spices to perk it up.

Very nice.  I used a whole apple and added it to the sauce.  I thought too that some golden raisins might be niced.  The recipe was chosen because it is low in carbs.  Thanks for sharing

I changed a few things to accommodate my diet...1-used goat cheese rather than cheddar cheese...big win; my family loved the creaminess of the goat cheese!  2-used gluten-free crumbs ; 3- browned it in a combination of olive oil and ghee (instead of butter).  Will definitely do it again!

I've made this dish twice, first time I changed it  by using lemon juice & water (1/8 cup lemon+1/8 cup water) which was suppose to be an acceptable substitution for the wine... it was okay but a little on the tart side for my taste. So the second time I made it I did it according to the recipe. It was good but not one of my favorite chicken recipes.... I am sure that I will make it sometime in the future but doubt that this recipe will become one of my go to chicken dinners.

Changed up the recipe a bit. Added more cheese, and used some grate Wisconsin Cheese, (pun intended). Hooks 2 year sharp cheddar, and Roth Kase Grand Cru. Since I made extra stuffing mixture, I fried the extra stuffing and made 2 nice sized  apple pancakes. I also used white Sherry and added a touch of chicken broth, plus a Big T of brown sugar to the gravy. It was fabulous!

This turned out delicious. I made a few alterations... salt and pepper the chicken before tenderizing. Then I added diced cranberries and a dash of nutmeg and clove to the stuffing. Then followed a chicken Marsala recipe and added a tablespoon of olive oil to the butter and used Marsala wine. I was really happy with the results and now have a new favorite fall recipe.

Delicious!!! After reading reviews of it lacking flavor I added a few  things. I added dried cranberries to the apple mixture. I lightly seasoned the breasts with salt, pepper, onion and garlic powder. I also added a tablespoon of brown sugar to the wine and used chicken broth instead of water. It was blasting with flavor! I will be making this again

Yum!  Made this without cheese to accommodate a dairy allergy and can only imagine it would have been even better with the cheese.  Also used dairy-free cracker crumbs to which I added a few dashes of various Italian seasonings (oregano, basil, parsley, garlic powder).  The whole family liked it, and I served it with bourbon glazed carrots and Italian mixed zucchini/squash.

Not bad, but probably won't bother making it again.  It was a lot of work to flatten the chicken (maybe I need a better tool?) & it ended up ripping as I was wrapping the filling.  I also wasn't sure how much to use as it could have meant 2 whole breasts (both sides), which I ended up using.  I doubled the filling anyway & seasoned the chicken with salt & pepper as suggested.  I also added a bit of cinnamon.  The chicken was tasty, but the filling was still a bit bland - should have salted that as well.  There also was barely enough sauce even doubling it, but it was tastier than I expected, even though it was much lighter in colour than the picture.  My family liked it & I'm glad I went with 2 whole breasts as we each ate a whole piece.  Maybe with some practice it would get easier & less messy, but I don't think I'll bother.

This was very tasty. I used boneless chicken thigh instead of chicken breast because that's what I had. I also used the apple chutney leftover from last night's dinner instead of just apples, also because I had it. I didn't use water, only Pinot Grigio and it turned out very flavorful.

Wasn't a big fan, but I've never stuffed a chicken breast before so I may not have done it correctly. Would give it another chance if I had someone helping me with more cooking experience.

Awesome recipe, Simple to prepare and everything works just like the recipe says it should and the outcome gives you a dish that people will think you spent a lot of time preparing. One of the best recipes I have found on All Recipes.

Instead of using the stove to cook this dish, I baked it, at 350 for 20 -25 minutes , and I used Granny Smith apples.  Oh, so good.

I used large breasts  so increased other ingredients as needed. I think double the amount of cheese would be appropriate for my family's taste.

Very tasty!  I think it needs some spices...but haven't figured out what might be best.  Maybe a teeny bit of nutmeg and cinnamon for a fall-like flavor to the dish.  Nice, easy recipe!

Turned out very well, little difficult keeping the chicken rolled together so I had to use multiple toothpicks. The chicken might have benefited from some marinade, but over all the apples provided a great flavor! Made with asparagus and glazed carrots. Great meal!

Fabulous taste and easy to put together. I made this twice, once with breasts and once with thighs, because it's what I had and both times it was great. I used Granny Smith apples and sharp cheddar and the flavored were fantastic. It also comes together quickly. I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.

Loved this dish ! I changed it a wee bit. Added smoked Gouda with the old cheddar..a dash of smoked paprika to the filling along  with some garlic powder ..pinch.....and a bit of kosher salt and pepper. Subbed out water in simmer for good chicken broth and added more wine in the gravy process. Omg.......was so good ! So moist and delish !

I  destroyed it, and it was still good.  Tips to other Newbie cooks:  1) Before commencing, take 5 minutes to learn how to pound out a chicken breast (good video on "No recipe required.")  2) Don't overdo stuffing  3) Seal up all edges.  My biggest mistakes:  1) I macerated the chicken (it fell apart, a little)  2) stuffing leaked out into the pan (burnt cheese) so I quickly moved unburnt parts to a new pot, to finish in the oven.  Result - less pretty, but tasty.

This had potential, but it just tasted... flat.  Something was definitely missing.  I even seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before browning.  Wish I'd read the reviews first, because I'm not the only one to think so.  If I were to do it again (doubtful), I'd leave my chicken breasts about 1/2 inch thick, and cut a slit in the side to stuff, rather than roll.  I had apple bits going out the sides of the rolls.

I substituted Merlot for the white wine. I also added cooked chopped bacon.  I increased the liquids by 1/2 for extra sauce.  I added salt and pepper.  Slice chicken breasts lengthwise for easier flattening and rolling.  I uses short skewers for turkey instead of toothpicks.

I like to follow a recipe exactly the first time I try it.  With this recipe, though, I read the reviews and added garlic salt and pepper to the stuffing and used a very sweet apple.  I couldn't taste the cheese and wonder if it is worth adding.  Maybe I'll try a very sharp Cheddar.  I salted and peppered the chicken while browning.  Overall, the dish looked and tasted good and didn't require much effort or time.

I've made this recipe a few times now.  I think it deserves 5 stars b/c a lot of the changes i've read/made are preferences.  I try to make a little bit more sauce and occasionally I'll stuff a full chicken breast  or cut in half and pound half a breast and roll.  Base recipe is solid.

This is a great dish. Every one loved it. I did season the chicken breast with a poultry seasoning before filling and I used chicken broth instead of the wine and water.

My family, kids included (ages 2 & 4), loved this dish!! I made the recipe exactly as written and everyone, including the two year old was asking for seconds. Definitely will be making this again! However, I am going to add additional chopped apples to the sauce to serve on top of the chicken.  The kids and hubby loved the sautéed apples which fell out of the stuffing and were asking for more of the stuffing. i served this with chef john's rice pilaf & steamed broccoli.

Great. Instead of breasts we used tenderlions and layered it in a smaller pot after browning. Worked great. Agree I would use chicken broth instead of water next time and twice as many apples.

Three stars for flavor, fourth added for ease. This was okay, but not spectacular. It was missing something, and I can't put my finger on what it could be.

I tried this recipe tonight and the family loved it I did add some brown sugar, pecans, more cheddar cheese and cinnamon to my recipe, however, it was good but next time I will add some craisins as well to the recipe and then it will be just right. the family also said YES to craisins as well, it would give it what it is missing. the glaze was good too.. I will make this again. tx

The family loved it! I followed the recipe to a T, except that I fried up some bacon and put it in the filling, then drained the grease and used the same pan to brown the stuffed chicken. It gave it a little extra flavor that was to die for!

I made the chx as directed. My chx breasts were too thick even though I pounded them to death. I would use smaller, very thin chx pcs next time. It was not a bad recipe, I thought the sauce was very good although I used more cornstarch than directed b/c I like a thick sauce. The chx on its own was very bland. If not for the sauce I don't think I would have eaten it.

I'm giving this recipe 3 stars because it sounded really yummy, but the flavor I was expecting just wasn't there. The chicken seemed quite bland. I think if I were to make this again, I'd season the chicken with something before cooking it. Preparation for this dish was very simple, but the rolling of the chicken was difficult. Maybe I didn't pound the chicken flat enough? The idea behind this recipe is nice, but I'm not sure I'd put in the effort to make it again. I did add some oregano and cinnamon to the apple mixture since I was using regular bread crumbs. I served it with white rice and broccoli. Not a terrible dish, but not a 5 star at my house.

I have done this recipe several times and my husband made an excellent suggestion...to throw some cream cheese in the middle when you roll it up.  This made all the difference! Just a little slice from a package of cream cheese and it was so good!  I also added some brown sugar and cinnamon to the mix for inside the chicken, as well as about 1 - 2 tbsp of brown sugar to the sauce after the chicken is done.  My husband asked me to make this for his mother, so fingers crossed she likes it!  :)

i followed simplyrainah's advice and it was Delicious!!! 

I also just made a great new variation on this recipe that I think brings out a lot more flavor.
- 1/2 a pear
- 1/2 cup of shredded kale
- 2 cloves of garlic
- 1.5 tbs cheddar 
- 2 tbs minced fresh rosemary
- 3 tbs bread crumbs
- 1 tbs brown sugar
- a pinch or two of chili powder
- salt to taste

so delicious, so much flavor

I've made this several times now, and everyone loves it. I didn't give it 5 stars because there was no seasoning added to it, which I did do when I was making it. My son asked that I make it as chicken strips, though, instead of stuffed breasts, and cooking the strips with a couple of breasts at the same time really worked well for us.

Made this last night and it came out great. A bare kitchen means substitutions, so: no cheddar meant I used the Mexican blend (not spiced) we had, a gala apple in place of a Granny Smith, and rice vinegar instead of white wine. I also added garlic, salt, and pepper to the filling like I do with nearly everything. Our family loved this.

Very flavorful & perfect for fall! We modified the recipe and loved the results. I made a cup of stuffing (used Pepperidge Farm) & tossed in 1/4 cup of dried cranberries, 1/2 diced apples, and 4 tablespoons of cheese. After stuffing the breasts, I boiled them for about 15 minutes in 1/2 cup of chicken broth, 1 tablespoon of butter, and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon. Then, I transferred them to a small glass pan and sprinkled with about 3 tablespoons of brown sugar. Baked in the oven for about 15 minutes & topped with salt to taste. So good!

Very good, added crushed roasted walnuts to the stuffing, used only chicken broth, a table spoon of white wine and about 1 1/2 tbsp of brown sugar to the gravy.
I will use croutons next time instead of bread crumbs.  Also, added a handful of chopped apples I had left to the gravy. Yum!!!

This was delicious! I added a little curry, cinammon, onion powder as suggested. I didn't have cheddar so I used shredded mozzarella for the stuffing and it was good. I also just browned in skillet then did the oven thing like DGW314 suggested. My kids and hubby devoured it! Will add to recipe box...yum! Oh yeah, I did double the sauce just for extra to put on top for garnish.

This was a great recipe, with items I typically have on hand. I used the suggestions of others to use chicken broth instead of water.  I had fuji apples and added the spices that "SWEETNOTHINGS" suggested.  The curry powder is a must! It doesn't take much. It appears so elegant when its sliced and I put a few apple slices in the sauce. I'll be making again.

This recipe was wonderful.  I made it last night with some slight changes, using some of the suggestions from other cooks.  the family loved it. I'm planning a dinner fundraiser and plan to do this as an appetizer with the sauce on the side .

Not great.  I expected more.  Not easy, either -- keeping the stuffing inside was difficult, probably because the stuffing didn't stick together well.

It's messy to make but it's pretty tasty.  Perhaps a little too sweet for my taste because I'm sweet enough already... get it... Well, I probably wouldn't make it again unless someone requested it or I had the ingredients on hand.

We liked this recipe. I didn't have white wine so used chicken broth for the water and wine. I also used all of the filling for two breasts.. My husband really liked this dish.

Great recipe! After reading others' reviews, I added just a touch of all spice, a bit of garlic powder and used chicken broth instead of water in the sauce.  I quadrupled the wine and the chicken broth.  Also, threw the excess apple mixture in at the end.  Wine was sauvignon blanc and apple was granny smith.

I didn't care for this recipe at all, but my husband thought it was very good. I added the curry as suggested, and didn't care for the combination with the apples.  I guess it's a matter of personal taste.

This was excellent; however, I did make several additions / changes per other reviewers suggestions. I added 1/4t allspice, 3/4t sage, 3/4t thyme to the stuffing and increased the cheese to 1/4C. I deglazed the pan with wine and chicken broth (salt +pepper) after browning the chicken, added the chicken back to the pan, covered it and baked it in a pre-heated oven (325) for ~15-20 minutes. Excellent flavors with minor additions.

I thought this was a great starter recipe, somewhere between a three and four. The only problem for me was that I added a fair amount of seasoning to it and it was still a bit bland. Pounded the chicken thin and added a lot of stuffing - gala apples cut rather large so retain some texture (because that was what I had), with shredded parmesan, sauteed onion, cayenne and garlic powder added to the listed ingredients. Browned the chicken rolls in olive oil/butter mix (I didn't use toothpicks, but it was okay). Added poulty seasoning and salt to the outside of the chicken. Used a white wine/apple juice mix for the sauce, with water only for the cornstartch. Put a bit of shredded cheddar on top of the finished rolls, mostly for looks, and then topped with sauce. We really did like this and I appreciate the idea.

I also am a bachelor, and I'm really new at this cooking thing.  I'll have to say, however, that all the recipes that I've gotten off this web-site have made me feel like I could cook.  Except this one.  After having read all the review, I have decided that I must have done something terribly wrong.  The chicken was dry, would have been tasteless had it not been for the oregano in the Italian bread crumbs.  Ugh, not a huge fan of oregano.  Could not even taste my Granny Smith's or the cheese.

This was excellent and easy. I would rather use twine than toothpicks. And, I would add a little crunch factor in the stuffing, like crushed pecans or chopped walnuts. Overall, simple and easy for a party or catering, since you simmer for 25 min. My husband said it was delicious.

I followed the exact recipe besides adding a little brown sugar and cinnamon as recommended by other reviews.  I also added more cheddar cheese because me and my man love cheese.  It was pretty good, but I still felt the stuffing needed something.  Next time I will try to add some other spices.  The recipe deffinately has potential.

This recipe was super easy to prepare and tasted pretty good. Although I found the apple filling a little on the bland side. Next time I will try using a granny smith apple and maybe a bit of sugar.

I just made this for my husband for Valentine's Day. We both loved it! I did change it up a little. I substituted chicken stock for the water. I also ended up adding an additonal cup or so of stock for the gravy.    I also saved some time by buying thin cut chicken breast. No pounding thin required.    I will definately make this again....soon.

AMAZING. Chicken came out so tender. May be the best chicken I've ever made. I may have used a bit too much Allspice but it was still good and moist. Will definitely make again!

So good, especially following other's suggestions to add cinnamon, brown sugar, allspice, etc. to the filling.

This was delicious!  I actually didn't change too much.  I didn't have seasoned bread crumbs so I just seasoned them myself, then also seasoned the chicken before adding the stuffing mixture.  I did follow other people's suggestions and used chicken broth instead of water.  Loved it...will definitely be making this again!

My children ate it without complaint therefore it gets 5 stars!  Seriously, I printed this 5 minutes before I left work on a busy weekday night and I thought it was very easy and quick to make.  I subbed apple cider vinegar for the wine because I was serving to my kids.  Is all alcohol cooked off?  I wasn't sure so I used the vinegar.  I used too much though and it was a little tangy.  I will definitely make again with the wine instead.

Different meal but yummy.  I did a few of the motifications but stuck pretty much to the recipe.  I used brie instead of chedder, and seasoned well like suggested.  Next time I will season a bit less but overall a good choice for dinner.

The chicken and stuffing were awesome, but I guess I added too much cornstarch because the gravy turned instantly to paste:(  Other than that, the chicken was awesome!!

Great recipe! Easy and flavorful! Thanks! While living in Wisconsin, we loved to eat apple pie with a slice of good cheddar on top. This recipe is reminiscent of that. I sometimes add a bit of sauteed onion to the mix. Great! Thanks!

I agree with SIMPLYRAINAH, the extra spices and curry powder were a BIG hit!  I used the extra sauce to saute some carrots and my husband LOVED this dish.  He said it looks and smells like something out of a restauant.  This was served to some dinner party guests and they were very impressed.  It is a very quick recipe and very simple to make.

I did not really care for this but I followed other reviews and added brown sugar and cinnamon with some other spices. There were too many different flavors going on.  I wish I had not done that and stuck more to the original recipe. Also my husband suggested cream cheese with the apple mixture. If I make this again I might try that next time.

Yum! I did add some chopped pecans and some chicken seasoning for a little something extra. I also used chicken broth instead of water. Wasn't sure if the BF would like it but, he did. I will probably make again; it's a great fall meal when apples are in season! :)

Wow, this was really good. Chicken was moist, and the sauce was really tasty. I added just a touch more wine and a little more butter. That could be why it was more moist.

It was very good! I unfortunatly didn't have any italian bread crumbs, so I used some cracker crumbs instead. I also added some spinach to the sauce after taking the chicken out!  The sauce tastes and smells so good! I definatly recommend this!  I was scared to try to make stuffed chicken breast, but it was quite easy!

Excellent recipe. My wife and I like things extra spicy, and we didn't have any Italian-style breadcrumbs, so we just broke up a crust of some homemade bread and added a bit of curry powder which worked out great.  Don't even thinking about using a poor cheese. There isn't much, but you can really taste it, so get the good stuff!

Made some slight modifications.  Used 2 low fat swiss cheese slices cut into julienned strips along with some cinnamon.  Didn't have any bread, so i toasted a half of a whole wheat hamburger roll, put into the blender with oregano, basil and garlic powder.  Yum!  My Hubbie and i loved it!

This recipe wasn't bad.  I followed some of the other reviews and seasoned the chicken.  I also used chicken broth instead of water, and no white wine.  I added 1tsp of teriyaki sauce to the stuffing, and to the sauce.  This was my first recipe from all recipes.  I happen to have an apple, cheese and chicken so I tried it out. I probably wont be making it again, but it was a different experience.  Thanks!!

Followed SIMPLYRAINAH's advice and added brown sugar, cinnamon, and a bit of pepper, seasoning salt, garlic powder, oregano and basil to the breadcrumb mix.  I didn't use cheese because I'm not a fan, and I was worried that things weren't going to "hold together" as well, but this turned out fantastically!  I also used chicken broth instead of water, as suggested, and added some brown sugar and extra apples to the sauce at the end to make it absolutely fabulous!

These were OK as is, but nothing I would have kept since there is no shortage of chicken recipes. With a few changes however I think it will go into my recipe box. I used granny smith apples, doubled the cheddar, added 1 minced garlic clove, used roasted garlic bread crumbs, added a few shakes of onion and curry powder and a tbsp of tarragon. I also only brown the chicken breast in a little olive oil and skip the gravy alltogether. Very good with those changes.

This was really good, especially the wine reduction sauce! I would recommend some type of "glue" for the stuffing, though, like a mustard of some sort: adds a bit of "tang" to the dish.

Great flavor. Next time, I'd use string rather than toothpicks.  It would allow smoother browning.

Very delicious added melted butter in with breadcrumb mixture to help combine. I also added dried cranberries. Worth the work.

Made according to recipe, not with suggestions in review and it was pretty bland.  If I try again, will need to add some spices and additional stuffing to kick it up a notch.
