These are good, but I had to make a few changes to the recipe, and alter things along the way.

Even when you indent the cookie, it will still flatten out a lot.  On my first batch, it looked like none had been indented at all.  While the cookies were still warm, I used the back of a measuring spoon (I have the rounded kind) to make a hollow in the center.

I also baked these at a higher temperature - 375 degrees - for 13 minutes.  The edges of the cookies were just starting to brown.  When I baked for 15 minutes at 325, they weren't browning at all.

Warning - be careful when filling with caramel sauce.  I overdid it on most of mine and the caramel started running off the cookie.  I also did my chocolate topping a little differently (used the chocolate glaze recipe from the "Carmelitas" recipe submitted by Terri).  A little too much caramel and chocolate has made for some messy cookies!

Oh, I also didn't roll in pecans.  

Can't think of anything else at the moment.  I'll know more tomorrow when they set up a bit more and are (hopefully) enjoyed at my neice's christening.

The only thing I did was put my nuts in the dough that egg wash rolling. I only had walnuts today so thats what I used, and I had homemade carmel so used that. The indents were ok but who needs an indent spread the whole top with carmel then chocolate! I also used my tiny ice cream scoop to scoop the dough.

Probably the best cookie I have ever made!!  I won the most unique cookie at the girlfriends annual cookie exchange.  The dough is so easy to make and I used Carmel dip which glissened beautifully

I had the same problem as others with the indentation disappearing when they were baked. Very easy problem to solve by doing what the other reviewer suggested using the back of a measuring spoon to do it again while they were still very hot. My husband loved these. I made half with the nuts and half without. They were good with or without them. I made my own caramel since I didn't have a jar of topping. Recommened for anyone not expecting an everyday cookie.

This recipe is good but I changed a couple of things: Instead of having chopped nuts, I replaced it with "Heath Milk Chocolate Toffee Baking Bits" and I left the cookies in the oven about 5 min. longer. Even though I made a few changes, I think that the recipe it's self is pretty good. :)

I loved this recipe! I followed the directions exactly, and it turned out wonderful. Everyone in my family loved them! I used apple caramel dipping sauce and fudge, it was so delicious. It only took about 10 minutes to prepare and I baked them for 15 minutes. I did what the other reviewers suggested and indented the cookies after they were baked. I also just put a dallop of fudge on top of the caramel instead of covering the whole thing. I would definately reccomend this recipe to EVERYONE!

It wasn't as good as I was expecting. It was very rich but my friend just threw it away. I followed the recipe to a T but the caramel syrup didn't harden much, making it super gooey. Maybe I need another go

Delicious!  Made these for my dad's birthday in honor of his favorite candy.  I used about twice as much chopped pecans, chopped really fine so it would coat the cookie really well.  I did the indentation after removing it from the oven, which worked well.   For the caramel sauce, I melted caramel bits with a little butter and milk, and did essentially the same thing for the chocolate, using chopped Germans chocolate since my dad likes the sweeter chocolates.
