I have always made my lasagne without cooking the noodles first. **I do not buy the no-cook noodles, I use the regular ones and it always turns out great!*** The important thing is to make sure all the noodles are covered with sauce. You can actually add quite a bit of water to the sauce to make sure everything is covered & it still turns out great. I have sometimes just added water to the baking pan after layering to ensure everything is covered - have never been disappointed with the results. - ALSO - this is not something you can make ahead & bake later as the noodles will turn to mush if they sit in the liquid too long before cooking.

Great recipe! Awesome flavor and super easy. One suggestion though. When you mix the cheeses together you can't taste the different flavors of them! I like to mix eggs and cottage cheese, then when doing the layers, I put cottage cheese first then chunks of Ricotta topped with the mozzarella. Then when it calls to add the last of the mozzarella for the last 15 min., I mix the Parmesan with it. It makes the top a little crustier but it also helps to seal in the juices so they don't spill over the side! My husband and daughter love it!!

Good taste, and definitely easy, but there was too much of the cheese mixture for the meat sauce.  I had to use half of a second 28-ounce jar of spaghetti sauce to put on top of the second cheese layer.  Also, the mozarella cheese layer inside the lasagna is completely unnecessary.  It's fine on top, but it adds too many calories for too little flavor, making it simply not worth it as a layer inside the lasagna.  You'd be much better off with a layer of parmesan reggiano, romano, or feta cheese - these pack in tons of flavor!  I also added garlic powder and Italian seasoning blend to my meat sauce - every pasta dish I make needs garlic!  Finally, the top layer of noodles didn't cook too well - they came out rather hard.

I found this recipe to be simple and delicious.  I made a few modifications though: I used italian seasoned lean ground turkey instead of the beef, lowfat ricotta instead of part-skim, and fat-free cottage cheese instead of regular.  I accidentally forgot the eggs and omitted the mushrooms (still haven't learned to like them), but I did add a layer of spinach after the cheese mix layer, which really added a nice flavor. I did run out of meat sauce before getting to cover the top layer of noodles, so I just put the cheese mix on and a layer of plain pasta sauce. I will definitely make this easy and yummy recipe again!

Wonderful and easy! Just make sure you end with meat sauce and not pasta otherwise the top pasta will not cook fully.

This recipe was really good. I did make a few changes though- I used half hamburger and half italian sausage. I used fresh mushrooms and 3 cloves of garlic when I was sauteeing the onion. And I added 1 tsp of italian seasoning and 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes to the cheese mixture. I also used an extra cup of spaghetti sauce. It turned out really well.

This recipe did not turn out very well for me.  The portions were very off: not enough sauce and way too much of the cheese mixture.  I will have to adjust next time.  Plus, the noodles were a bit tough.  I suggest using the no-boil noodles instead of regular lasagna noodles.

I made this but changed it a little.  I made it with 1 pound of gr beef and 1/2 pound of Italian sausage and added 2 T of garlic along with the onion.  I also used two jars of sauce and simmered it all with some crushed red pepper flakes.  I added a square of frozen chopped spinach to the cheese mixture, and I used a bag (2 cups) of mozz cheese.  Oh, and I also used the oven ready lasagna noodles.  I have to say, it was pretty awesome.  I have never followed directions of any kind in my life...why start now, LOL.

This is an update to my initial review below. The second time around, instead of spaghetti sauce, I used tomato sauce and added the following: 2 or 3 cloves of garlic (crushed), 1 tsp Italian seasoning, 1 1/2 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp black pepper and salt to taste. Also used chopped fresh mushrooms instead of canned.

A tip for first timers - always end with the meat sauce as the last layer on top. If you finish with lasagna noodles, they do not cook well.

        ----------------------------------------------------------

Such an easy recipe! And absolutely delicious! Great for first time lasagna makers!!

This a great,easy lasagna-- which is what I was looking for and what it was advertised as. If you fiddle with it too much it gets better, but it loses the "easy" quality because you add more steps. As a basic, quick and dirty lasagna recipe, this is the real deal. Simple and quick, cheesy and tasty. Nothing flashy or surprising -- just a good, solid recipe for when you want a good pasta dinner, and are willing to cut a few corners with canned stuff to get the job done. I missed garlic and onions (the cornerstone of a good lasagna) which is why it didn't get five stars from me. I followed exactly, but next time I will brown the garlic and sweat the onions in the pan before I add the ground beef. It adds a step but still keeps it simple.

I have been making this recipe for at least a year now.  We also use 2 jars of spaghetti sauce because my husband likes it really saucy.  I also omit the mushrooms due to personal preferences.  We season the meat with garlic and italian seasoning.  ALWAYS a hit.  Makes a large pan so we only make it when we have company.  Great taste though!!

Skipped the mushrooms, made this a three layer lasagna, it was AMAZING, everyone loved it!  Not hard at all and I love that I didn't have to precook the noodles!  Also worked well using different pastas than lasagna noodles, we tried this with elbow macaroni, layered as instructed and it was delicious!

Like promised, this was easy, fast, and yummy!  I ended up needing more sauce than called for (luckily I had some meat sauce left over from a previous meal) and more mozzarella, but those were easy modifications.  Definitely hit the spot and I got compliments for days!

I made a couple of changes that brought this recipe up a couple of notches: -used a little more ground beef -added 2 cloves minced fresh garlic and 2 tbsp. fresh chopped oregano to browning meat mixture -doubled the amount of sauce -added fresh chopped spinach into layers -didn't shred mozzerella, instead I sliced it into thin slices

I just took this dish out of the oven.  Believe the chef meant to say 1 hr. 45 minutes in the oven at 350 degrees.  I tested at 45 minutes, the noodles were uncooked.  Tested every 15 minutes until cooked @ 1 hr. 45 minutes.  Makes sense as the no cook noodles take a full 55 minutes, with 5 minutes for browning.  Needed 3 full jars of sauce for this dish, not 28 ounces as stated.  I also had to add 1/4 C of water to the pan to keep the noodles moist.  Looks great, though, can't wait to try it.

My very first attempt at lasagna!  It was okay - regular noodles were done just fine without cooking them ahead of time.  It was actually better as leftovers because it held together better.  I used a full second jar of sauce (I used Ragu with vegetables) and added some garlic powder.

This was a great recipe that was quick and simple to make.  The whole family loved it, but next time I will use 1/2 the onion as it gave an overpowering flavor to the mix.  I will definately make this one again!!!!  I did use almost 2 pounds of beef for this too and added an extra can of tomato sauce to make up for the extra meat.

I love this easy recipe.  I haven't bothered to look for a different recipe for lasagna.  I do, however just mix the shredded cheese with the eggs and ricotta cheese mixture and will occasionally tweak the sauce that I buy.  I also swear by Barilla's no boil lasagna noodles.  As long as the pasta is covered with sauce, it will turn out great.

The noodles really needed to be cooked before hand.  The noodles came out uncooked and crunchy.  Besides that it was good.

1 lb. of Lasagna noodles will not fit in the 9X13 pan- Needs much more meat sauce to compete with the amount of cheese added. Top level of noodles were quite stiff.

This was my first attempt at making lasagna.  I'm single and just never tried it before.  The recipe is detailed enough to make it taste homemade but easy enough for a newbie.  Really good.  My only mistake was adding a little salt.  It was already in the Newman Pasta sauce.  Oh, I do recommend using good ingredients.  :)  

Also, I just used regular lasagna noodles.  Didn't cook them ahead of time, just layered them like the recipe says and they were perfect.

After baking for 45 minutes, I pulled the foil off and the noodles were not done at all.  I ended up having to cover it back up and bake another 30 minutes.  The noodles were done then, but by that time it was very dry.  The next time I am going to cook the noodles beforehand and then bake for about 20 minutes.

AWESOME. I improvised this a bit to give it a fuller, homemade flavor. I added a clove of garlic to the meat and after adding the sauce, simmered it covered for 45min-1hr to thicken. I also added 1tbsp parsley, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1/2 tsp oregano and 1/2 tsp paprika.

No mushrooms, no cottage cheese, no parmesan cheese, 16 oz extra ricotta and only 1 egg. I also used a pre-shredded blend of 4 cheeses (asiago, parmesan, provolone, fontina) and added a 3/4 cup throughout the layers.

Layered and baked as per recipe and it came out DELICIOUS!!! My fiance and I cannot get enough. Will make again but with more sauce and noodles (I only made 2 layers but 3 would be perfect)

I really loved this recipe!  Yes, it tasted great, but what I loved most was how easy it was and quick - for a lasagna!  (Probably took me an 45 min prep - 75 min cooking)  As everyone else does, I made a few additions to the recipe.  I added 1/2 lb. of pork with the ground beef.  Then I sliced fresh mushrooms (instead of canned) and also a can of diced tomatoes.  Also added garlic salt, parsley, basil and a little bit of crushed red peppers.  Instead of using just mozz. cheese in the layering, I used a mixture of Parmesan, Mozz. and Provolone.  Lastly, on top of the layer of shredded cheese, I added a layer of fresh spinach.  This recipe was easy to make and crowd pleasing!  :)  This recipe made AT LEAST 10 servings.  Thanks!

We really liked this recipe, although I will admit to cooking the noodles briefy beforehand.  It could've used a bit more sauce and some garlic spice maybe but otherwise, excellent.  It DID make dry leftovers though due to the lack of sauce.  It makes a full pan the first time though and it's filling, so bring over the whole family for a great meal!

I always make this ahead without boiling the noodles. Both my husband and I work full time so almost all of our dinners have to be ready for the kiddos to put into the oven(15 and 12, third one is 7 but no oven for her!)as as soon as they come home from school so that we can have a HEALTHY dinner before they head out for evening activities. The trick is to wait until just before you are ready to put it in the oven and then pour about 1/2 cup of hot water around the edges of the pan and then recover it. The noodles always turn out perfect, never mushy. This recipe, with several variations that include omitting the meat entirely and using frozen spinach(thawed and thoroughly drained) and carrots, is part of our regular meal rotation.

I loved it!  I put almost an extra jar of sauce and I presoaked my noodles in hot water for ten minutes. Put half amount of cottage cheese in. And too much mozzarella in middle should have saved more for the top instead. Great recipes for me never having made a lasagna.

My family loves this recipe and have fixed it several times. The only thing I modified was using fresh mushrooms instead of canned and used mild sausage instead of ground turkey. I do add whatever I have in the fridge like green or red peppers and spinach. Like the other reviews, you really do have to watch your sauce. Take it easy on the 2nd layer since whatever you spread on the top seeps down. Make sure you cover all of the pasta with sauce since it dries up in the oven. I freeze a batch of these in serving sizes individually wrapped in cling wrap and placed in a freezer bag which lasts a month. Great for bottomless teens and for your pocket!

My husband & I made this for dinner tonight.  We made a few modifications to the recipe though.  Instead of canned mushrooms we used fresh and we also added fresh garlic chopped up, fresh parsley as well as green peppers to the sauce & meat.  We also used two 24oz jars of Bertolli spaghetti sauce.  I don't think that only 28oz of sauce would have been enough, I was almost short and I used two whole jars.  I am not sure if my glass baking pan was a little larger or what.  But anyway it turned out great!  We LOVED this dish and will definitely make it again. I also wanted to add that I have never made lasagna and was a little weary about not cooking the noodles first but they were cooked all the way when it was done, they weren't tuff at all.

I was going to make rollatini's, but seemed too much work, and I had everything for lasagna, so found this recipe. Its great basics, and easy to tweak it however you want. I used 1.5 lb grnd beef, onions,minced garlic, small can mushrooms, all added to 2-24oz jars spaghetti sauce, one regular, one Grandessa Italian sausage & peppers.had plenty thick meaty sauce. I skipped the cottage cheese, I had large ricotta, and put in processor with frozen chopped spinach(thawed and squeezed dry), put it in fridge while sauce simmered for 20 mins. I used regular noodles- let them set in very hot tap water first. I was short on Mozzerella, so just used it on top w/ fresh chopped parsley. so not too much different than recipe, but did double the meat sauce.  wonderful and looked great too. I do think better to use ricotta or cottage cheese, but not both. :)

Fantastic lasagna and very easy to make. I've made it a couple times now, and the other reviews are very helpful for modifying the recipe.  Definitely use more sauce than is called for.  This prevents your lasagna from becoming dry after the first night. I added more meat too. Mozerella in the middle layers isn't really necessary. I added fresh jalepeno, red+green peppers, and garlic. The recipe is a great basis for a lasagna, but if you like really flavorful food like me, extra fresh ingredients and spices is a must. Crushed red pepper, garlic salt, oregano are good additions to the meat sauce.  Coursley ground black pepper and  some crumbled feta are great additions to the cheese mix.

I made this for the first time when we had quite a few friends over.  I had to triple the recipe to make enough - I went with all ricotta, left out the onions, and halved the eggs that the tripled recipe called for (it just seemed like too much).  I seasoned the canned sauce to taste (extra garlic and onion powders, oregano, tinsy bit of sugar and ground pepper) - we always doctor canned sauce - and I made a point to intentionally overseason the sauce to make sure the cheeses absorbed some of the flavor to avoid a bland cheesey taste.  It was absolutely spectacular and was a huge hit!  The noodles were perfect, the flavors all blended beautifully, and it tasted like the lasagna that my father makes from our family recipe...and he spends an entire day making the sauce!  I made it a second time for my mother- and father-in-law.  They begged me to make it again for our nephew's birthday coming up.  I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!!

OK,i was so impressed to see that I don't have to boil or buy special noodles.(I did bake 60/15 instead of 45/15) I finaly made a great lasagna. this recipe is good and I would like to share some tips.alternate layers one direction then the other as this helps with holding together.Dont waste your time putting a lot of sauce in middle layers..but put enough on the top so all noodles are very well submersed..this solves the hard edge noodles.very important to let it cool with foil on top for 1.5 hours. and you can cut it in perfect cake pieces no falling apart into a soupy mess and its still warm. simmer another jar of sauce and ladle it on each piece after plated..it makes a great presentation and the warm lasagna with the hot sauce is perfect.

This was just okay for me. It was more frustrating than it was good. First there was WAY too much cheese mixture and not even close to enough meat sauce mixture, and I did not have another jar of pasta sauce on hand to fix this error which ruind the recipe for me. Also the cheese mixture is the more expensive part of the recipe, and to see all that extra get thrown away was really upsetting as a mom on a tight budget. I suggest you could half the cheese mixture, and double the pasta sauce.

Great recipe as lasagna! I also used the recipe to make cannelloni . Only use half of the tomato sauce for meat. You will need the rest later. I mixed together the meat and chesse mix. Then stuffed the cannelloni shells (uncooked). Covered the shells with the left over meat and cheese mix in a 9x9 glass dish. Be sure to add 2 tbsp. water on each side of the dish. Covered that with the remaining tomato sauce. Then covered that with cheese. Cover with foil, same bake time. Turned out great.

I made this last night for my Dad and boyfriend.  I have never cooked for my Dad because I'm just starting to learn how to cook. And this was my first ever lasagna.  It came out AWESOME!  My Dad even said it was the best lasagna he'd ever had.  The only changes I made were that I added green peppers and 3 cloves of minced garlic in with the mushrooms (fresh bella) and onions (half of an onion rather than a whole one).  I used no-boil noodles.  I also used a jar and half of sauce, rather than just one jar.  Thank you for the great recipe.  I'll definately make this again!

I made this for my family and everyone LOVED it. I added 6 oz. more of the sauce and omitted the mushrooms. I added alot of garlic, since we love garlic. Next time I will add more garlic since it seemed it had baked off. I used the no-bake lasagna noodles and they didn't end up dried and crisp around the edges like most lasagna noodles turn out. They were nice and soft. It was so tasty and held nicely together. I will never try another lasagna recipe again, and this even beat my Grandma's recipe.

Easy and delicious!  I left out the egg (was distracted) and was just fine!  My kids enjoyed and love having leftovers to freeze for another time!  I used no-boil noodles and saved time - it was absolutely homemade-delicious!

This is a great and easy recipe. I ended up using 2 bottles of spaghetti sauce because I personally like it more saucy than dry. I also added a little garlic powder to the cheese mixture. This was delicious. It tastes great as leftovers and even taste great cold.

Excellent, simple recipe. I used Barilla's "no boil" lasagna noodles with no dryness problems. The pan was very full, and there was some overflow while baking! Instead of mozzarella, I used Trader Joe's Quatro Formaggio (asiago, parmesan, fontina, and provolone) mix for a sharper cheese flavor.

My father, who is 81 years old and Italian, said it was the BEST lasagna he has ever had! I did modify as follows:
--used 1 1/4 lb. ground beef
--used 1 lb. sweet italian sausage
--used 2x as much sauce.
--added red pepper flakes and garlic powder to sauce/meat mix.
--used only ricotta (32 oz), 2 eggs and some parsley flakes.
--par-boiled my noodles.
***NOTE!! Even with these modifications, I was STILL short on sauce/meat mix for 3 layers of pasta. Had to top half with meatless sauce. Cooked for 1 1/2 hours. DELICIOUS!!!!

Great flavor and not really that difficult to make, just a bit time-consuming.  I would definitely recommend taking the time to boil the lasagna noodles first.  You can do it while you're browning the ground beef.  The first time I cooked this, I followed the recipe instructions not to cook the noodles and they just didn't taste right.  They were crunchy all the way through.  Cooking them first made a huge difference.

What did I do wrong??? After 45minutes covered at 350 my lasagna was still cold in the middle and the noodles hard.  Just put it back in for another 30min, at 400 covered of course.  Will check then.  Have my fingers crossed.

I agree with some reviewers that the proportions are really off. I halved the recipe and still need more pasta sauce than the ORIGINAL recipe asked. I think next time, I'll need two jars of sauce and slightly more beef. I ommited the mushroom and added garlic to the beef. I will be trying it again though because the flavours were there and they were nice.

I been making this for years...except I don't use ricotta cheese sub it with the cottage cheese (To save money) and omit the mushrooms since most family members hate them.  Also, I add a little more sauce about 1 1/2 cans of the four cheese flavored spaghetti sauce and add a little more on the cheeses.  I also add extra seasoning to the sauce, And Before mixing the sauce with the cooked meat I pour a little of the on the bottom of my cooking dish....before adding my first layer of uncooked noodles.

this is delicious....i did change a few things tho. instead of using cottage cheese, i just used 32 oz of ricotta. i also added about a teaspoon of dried parsley (could have used a little more). I found there wasn't enough meat sauce, but then again my family are big meat-eaters. i will definitely make this again - my husband likes it more than my mother's (who makes homemade noodles and everything, lol_.

Great, easy lasagna. I do prefer mine a little saucier and will use 2 jars of spaghetti sauce next time. The flavor is good; cheese definitely dominates, though. I will add some Italian seasonings next time.

I loved the recipe, but I must say that you really have to cook the noodles before baking. I didn't use the mushrooms or the onions since my husband is not into veggies. But I did season the meat with garlic powder, adobo, and mojo. I would also add more mozzarella, but that's because I like it cheesy. Other than that, lasagna came out great!!

GREAT recipe.  We have LOTS of deer meat from hunting season so I used that in place of ground beef.  The only thing I left out was cottage cheese since my husband doesn't care for it.  My Mother In Law raved about it to the family too.. :)  Two thumbs up!

This lasagna was super easy to make and very delicious!  I do agree that it needed a little more sauce.  And the no-bake noodles turned out great - not hard at all.  It was very cheesy and everyone loved it!  It was also great as leftovers - maybe even better.  I did use all turkey instead of beef, and added onion and extra mozarella cheese.  Will definitely be making again!

Great base recipe!  I exchanged turkey burger for the ground beef, as well as adding various peppers and other veggies I have on hand as healthy additions.  I also pre-mix the cheeses with the eggs the day before for a more cohesive mix.  Love this recipe!

This recipe was wonderful...except....it took longer to cook the noodles.  I ended up cooking it for 2 hours.  It could have used more sauce, but was ok with what it called for.   I added it to my "Box", so I will make it again.   Overall....good recipe!

My first try at lasagna, turned out well.  I wish that there was a little more tomato sauce and that it was a bit sweeter.  I used ground turkey, and think that next time I will season the meat a little bit.  Overall a good lasagna.

This turned out great!  As a vegetarian, I opted out of the ground beef, and to speed things up, I bought a jar of chopped garlic to replace the onions.  Then I just layered sauce (used about a jar & a half, to compensate for the lack of meat), noodles, the cheese mixture, mushrooms, and chopped garlic.  No pre-cooking or onion-chopping needed! :)  Be sure to finish with the layer of sauce, so that the cheese can melt into it when it's put back, uncovered, into the oven.  Yum - totally delicious.  I made my boyfriend the same one, but using sauce that had meat in it, and he loved it, too!

This was very easy to make. I did boil my noodles first, just wanted to make sure they weren't hard, as I read this happened in the reviews many times. I added garlic and onions to the ground beef when cooking, along with Italian, pepper, garlic poweder, and basil seasonings. I also used 2 jars of pasta sauce, as 1 wouldn't of been enough. I let the lasagna cool about 30 mins before serving, we actually enjoyed it more the second day. If making in the future, I'll cook and let sit over night.

This tasted AMAZING and it was SO EASY! This was my first time making it and one response I got was "this is the best lasagne I've ever had!" Definitely a "safe" one to make for the first time when having company.

I added silverbeet (it's like spinach) with the cheese mixture and it was awesome. I also used LASAGNA PASTA.... (they weren't sheets).. and it came out perfectly. 

Definitely a keeper! [:

This was my first time cooking lasagna & I found the recipe fairly simple. The lasagna very was good, but a little too dry for us(I used 2 jars). Next time I will use 3 jars of sauce. Will definately make again! Thanks alot.

This is a great recipe. I like to add a 1 lb. of sausage to my beef to have a real meaty sauce. I also add mozzarella  cheese to the cheese mixture. My family loved it. Thanks.

This recipe was good, but I found it too cheesey and also the noodles were a little harder than I liked, so I put it back in for another 15-20 minutes.

THIS WAS GREAT. I DID TAKE OTHER REVIEWERS ADVICE AND USE EXTRA SAUCE. IT REALLY NEEDS IT. I FOUND THE BAKING TIME WAS NOT RIGHT, BUT IT MIGHT JUST BE MY OVEN. I HAD TO LEAVE IT FOR ABOUT A HALF AND HOUR MORE THAN WHAT THE RECIPE STATED TO GET THE NOODLES TENDER.

This recipe definately needs more than 1 lb of ground beef,I used 1 1/2 and could have used more. It made lots of cheese and I added some italian seasoning for color. Make sure and use a deep dish. Good flavor first night but made dry leftovers.

This was good.  I had extra ground beef in the frig, so I used a pound and a half of meat.  I also skipped the cottage cheese after reading the reviews of there being to much cheese.  I added 8 oz of tomato sauce, but still feel there could have been more, as it wasn't very saucy.
Update: made this a second time with 1 lb of beef and this time used the cottage cheese and added 8oz of tomato sauce.  I Liked it with the extra cheese, but still think it was light on the sauce.

This turned out excellent! I used a pound of spicy sausage and a pound of lean hamburger. I did not have cottage cheese so I just used a quart of Ricotta cheese. My husband wanted this for dinner every night for a week!

Sure. Why boil lasagna noodles if you don't have to? This also freezes well and makes a great 'emergency' dinner when you don't want o cook. Defrost, heat and serve. We modify the recipe all the time depending on our ingredients on hand. Very hard to ruin it. A little Italian adds flavor. If you have spaghetti seasoning, you can add that to the meat/sauce mix a the beginning.

This was awesome! I used half ground beef and half italian sausage. I also used gluten-free noodles since I can't have wheat. I boiled the gluten-free noodles until they were almost soft only because they take much longer to cook than regular noodles and I wanted to be sure they were done. It turned out wonderful!

So happy I found this recipe.  I have been afraid to try lasagna and get buying frozen.  At first I was hesitant to try due to the high calorie amt but after making it and realizing I could get 16 servings instead of 8 and used low fat option the calories are less than half of what is posted.  The first time I made this my family could not get enough and my husband said you finally mastered lasagna.  The second time I decided to double and freeze and extra one.  I did follow other reviewers suggestions and used 2 jars of sauce, seasoned the meat and cheese.  I used 2 lbs of extra lean ground beef, extra mushrooms and spinach.  I too was worried about the 2 layers of noodles instead of 3 but found it perfect and not overfilling.

I needed an easy lasagna recipe for feeding my sons football team (47 teenage boys) I found this recipe and thought it couldnt get any easier. WOW did this go over well with the team. I made 6 pans with 12 servings each. They LOVED it. Thank you. P.S. it tastes better the second day.

DELICIOUS! This was excellent. My family loved it. It was so easy to make, and the best thing I loved about it was that you didn't have to boil the pasta before putting it in the oven. I left the mushrooms out though.

Oh, this was so good and so easy! I just did some minor changes. I didn't put in mushrooms, I didn't have ricotta so I used sour cream in place and I only used about 4 1/2  lasagna noodles! Came out great! I've been told to make it like this again!

This was easy to make and turned out delicious. I didn't boil the noodles first- it doesn't specify on the recipe. I also covered it and cooked it for the entire time with all the cheese on it instead of taking it out and then applying last topping. It still was beautiful and tasted great, just skipped a step! I'm making it again tonight!

This was an excellent lasagna.  I made the following adjustments: Added 4 cloves of choppped garlic to ricotta mixture and an additional 4 cloves of chopped garlic to meat mixture.  I also found that one jar of spaghetti sauce was not quite enough,  I also used half of a second jar.  The quality of the spaghetti sauce is key for this recipe.  If you can get it in your area, check out Mezzetta Napa Valley Bistro Arrabbiata.  Excellent!  I took this dish to a "pot luck" and it was a huge hit, no leftovers.  I was kind of hoping for some! ha ha

This was my first attempt at making lasagna and I was very surprised at how well it turned out. Some of the best lasagna I've ever had. I feel like it could use more onion than the recipe called for. Also, I brushed each layer of lasagna noodles with water to help the noodles cook more, it really softened up the dish. Very good recipe

I changed this just a little bit. I didn't add the cottage cheese and I cooked in an 8x8 pan since it is just for the wife and I. I added a couple gloves of garlic to the onion/meat mixture. I also added a little bit more sauce, used no boil noodles, and put a little bit of water on top of the noodles before I put them in the oven.  Only issue I have with this is that the sauce seemed to be non-existent. I used a little bit extra but it seemed that all of the sauce evaporated. It was great recipe and will use it again. Enjoyed

Great recipe! I've tried this recipe twice...the first time I did it, it came out beautifully - so much so that my boyfriend ran away with half the pan...LOL (note: I didn't use mushrooms because I'm just not a fan). The second time I made it, I left out the mushrooms and the cottage cheese (based on another review I saw)...I didn't realize how much of a difference the cottage cheese would make, but it did...now I know how to tweak the recipe so that it will come out perfect everytime...don't disciminate against the cottage cheese!!! Thanks for such a good recipe!

I made this type of lasagna before and loved it. I guess this isn't the same recipe. It was ok, it seemed like it was missing something, just not sure what. I think I'll try to find the other recipe I saw in the past.

This was very easy to make a and tasted great! I will be making this on the regular. The only thing is that I had to add about half a lb more of meat and half a jar more of sauce. Also, I just boiled my lasagna noodles for five mins while the meat was cooking. Other then that it was wonderful!

Flavor is good but the ingredient amounts seem way off.  Not nearly enough red sauce (I used a 45 oz jar and was still short). Not enough mozzerella.   Would have liked to make 3 layers instead of 2 but ran out of sauce and mozzerela.  Since I only had 2 layers, I had a lot of cheese mix and noodles left over.

Excellent basic recipe. Added hot Italian sausage and sharp cheddar cheese, more meat and 2 jars of sauce. I also boiled the noodles, used regular ground beef and seasoned meat with Italian Seasoning, parsley, garlic, oregano, Lawry's and Accent. Very delicious!

This was my first time making lasagna ever. I'm not the cooking type of girl, but my boyfriend is all about the being cooked for so I am trying out new things. Anyways, we loved the recipe. It's such a great thing when you see them take the first bite and you get a mmmmmmmmmmm out of it. I do think it was a little too runny, but it settled. Also, when I putting the onions and mushrooms in I added some basil, rosemary, salt, pepper, and some sugar. Just a pinch. It was great. Thank you.

I apologize for not sending a comment much earlier. Two years ago, I made this recipe for a church conference for 11th and 12th graders. I only made two servings per person. Some were asking for third servings; next time I will double the recipe. I served this delicious lasagna with spinach-strawberry salad. Even the student who did not like spinach asked for a second helping. By the way, that was my first lasagna, and it remains at the top of my list for GREAT lasagnas.

I really liked the idea of this lasagna, but I did make many changes.  I left out the mushrooms and ricotta cheese; I just vamped up the cottage cheese mixture by adding a couple eggs, parmesan, extra mozzarella, basil and parsley.  I also added a pound of breakfast sausage to spice up the meat mixture.  I like making this dish to freeze and keep on hand in case of dinner emergencies.

This was a great recipe and my kids liked it, even though it wasn't Grama's recipe.  The only thing I would change is to add a bit more tomato paste/sauce as it turned a bit drier than my taste.  Overall excellent and easy to make!

Love this lasagna!  I followed the directions pretty closely.  The only difference is that I used low fat/fat free cottage cheese and ricotta.  My only problem was that all the ingrediants didn't fit in the pan.  After making it 3 times, I finally realized that I was supposed to use a 9x13 instead of the smaller one I had been using.

This was good.  I did make a few changes though.  I mixed the ricotta cheese with some cottage cheese (accidently ran out and didn't have enough ricotta).  Also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned and sauted them with the ground beef.  Lastly...had to add garlic.  Turned out really well.  With so many lasagna recipes on here...this really stands up to the others.  Thanks for the post.

I made this lasagna for my first try and I have to say that it was so delicious and true to its name.  My family likes a meaty lasagna so I added more ground meat.  I will definitely be making this again.

I had never made lasagna before and I messed it up.  It was still good!  So I can only imagine how yummy it would have been if I'd done it correctly.  I will be making this again...hopefully without the boo-boos.

There was no way I could get a 1 pound box of lasagna noodles into a 13 by 9 inch pan.  I only used 1/2 the package of noodles and the result was still much too dry.  Would make again using even fewer lasagna noodles and a lot more sauce.  A good recipe, tasted good, but the amounts need some adjusting.

This was my first try at lasagna, and it was great!  I added garlic, basil, parsley, salt and pepper to the beef, and upped the sauce after reading the other reviews.  I used whole wheat pasta and boiled it just a bit before baking, after reading that some people had tough noodles.  My boyfriend loved this and I will definately make it again!

So this was my first time ever going out buy ingredients for this recipes and actually making it. Thats because I'm a college student and rather cook something that takes only 3 minutes compared to 45 to an hour. I just can't wait that long! However, I decided to make a real meal, instead of Mac N Chesse. So I made this recipe and it turned out pretty good. Even my roommate said it was good. All I had to do was follow the instructions. Not that hard at all. If I can make this, anyone can! :-)

5 star!! - Absolutely the best lasagna I've ever made.  I love Italian, and have tried many recipies.  This one is clearly a winner.  My boyfriend prefers 'meat & potatoes' but he liked it so much that he ate half the pan!  The noodles were much easier to work with dry, and turned out perfect.  I added a little bit more sauce and omitted the mushrooms, as a personal preference. I also added fresh ground pepper to the cheese mixture. Be sure to use a sauce that you like, as this is where most of the flavor comes from! Good job Susan, Thank-you

This lasagna was very tasty and easy to make.  The only thing that went wrong was that the top layer of noodles was a little "crunchy" around the edges.  We liked it because it was not very saucy and didn't fall apart as soon you took a piece from the pan.  Will definitely make again.  We only wish we had made garlic bread to go with it!

Perfect!  I used turkey and not beef, so the mushrooms added the extra oomph it needed.  Especially good for a lasagne where the noodles don't need to be pre-cooked.

This was great! Super easy and delicious. After reading some reviews, I wamted to add a little extra liquid to the hamburger mixture. So, the pasta sauce that we like comes in a 32 ounce jar, and I used about 3/4 C of water to rinse the jar and added that to the hamburger sauce mix as well. The noodles cooked beautifully. I will definitely be making this again.

One of my favorite go to dinners when I have time to make it. Definitely important to let it stand for the 10-15 minutes unless you like it more soupy only made that mistake once.

I wish I had read the reviews before I dived into making it. As previous reviewers stated, too much cheese sauce not enough tomato sauce and not enough mozzarella cheese for the topping. I did not have issues of undercooked pasta like some others. Would make again with tweaks!

I liked this  recipe except I used two jars of sauce. Good recipe for a classic cheese lasagna without the frills for picky eaters. Oh and I skipped the cottage cheese and used cooked noodles.

This was pretty good, although I've had better lasagna. It would have been too dry with just one jar of sauce, so I added some extra. Also, I didn't like the cottage cheese and ricotta mixed together. I used to have a recipe that just used ricotta and egg mixture, and that was better tasting. I added italian sausage so it wasn't just hamburger. I'd make it again, but I really want to find my old recipe that sat overnight in the fridge before cooking(that was a better recipe, taste wise).....

I made my own tomato sauce from scratch, which probably came out to about 3 cans of the prepackaged stuff, and I could have used just a tiny bit more. I found the cheese amount to be just right after having added a layer of sliced butternut squash and a layer of zucchini. My end result was very tall and I was worried it might over flow while cooking so I wrapped the entire pan in tin foil. Additionally, for this reason, I baked my dish for an extra 45 minutes and it was perfect all the way through.

The thought of canned mushrooms makes me shiver so I used fresh sliced mushrooms instead, adding them to the meat at the same time as the onions. They added a great, earthy flavour.  I probably added too much extra tomato sauce, because I was using a pan that was too big, but managed not to wreck it, although I wouldn't add extra sauce next time. My husband, who makes most of our meals, was happy because I actually cooked something, and I cooked it because it was simple. I will definitely make this again, and would recommend it to anyone. It would easily serve 6-10 people, depending on whether you're feeding a crowd of big appetites or picky eaters.

As simple as homemade lasagna can get!!!!

For the cheese mixture, I used half of everything because I am not a cheese person and it turned out great! Could use more meat for my taste though. I used 1 1/4 jars of spaghetti sauce.
I also accidentally cooked the lasagna noodles before baking, so I turned the oven to 400 F and baked it all for 35 mins (adding the mozzarella at 20 min).

My family loved this. I used fresh mushrooms (only 2 cut really small), regular ricotta (not skim) and Del Monte canned spaghetti sauce. I prefer the Del Monte sauce over jarred sauce. Plus, it's usually less expensive. I will try others' suggestions and add a little garlic to the next batch. No issues with undercooked noodles as mine were completely covered.  Great recipe. Thank you!

Instead of beef I used ground turkey and I added lots of Italian spices (but not quite enough -- next time I'll add more spice to bring up the savoriness of this dish!).  Overall, it was wonderfully easy and perfect to freeze as single entrees and for sharing.  Will definitely make it again.  Soon!

Super easy! I made some changes like taking out the mushrooms(because nobody in my house likes them) and doubling the sauce. The reason for extra sauce was to make sure the noodles cooked thoroughly. The end result was flavorful and delicious and reminded my of grandma's recipe we used to love! You won't be dissapointed.

Not enough sauce. Pasta wasn't fully cooked. The Fix: Double the sauce amount and bake for 1hr 15min and this recipe is perfect.

I have made so many lasagna recipes from here and this is my favorite. Easy and flavorful. The only thing I did is add garlic to the meat while cooking and used fresh mushrooms that I chopped up small because my kids are not fans. My kids are eating it and they are tough critics.

Very good and easy to make. I used fat free cottage cheese and you can't notice any difference. The only thing I would change is adding more sauce or a bit of water to the sauce to make sure all the noodles are well covered with sauce. Just taste the sauce to make sure it's seasoned well. My husband who doesn't usually like lasagna loved this and my entire family still raves about it. I used no-cook lasagna noodles and they were great!

Really easy. I made it healthier by using ground turkey, whole wheat noodles, more veggies and low-fat cheese. Honestly, would never have been able to tell the difference. However, I felt it needed more sauce. I ran out of sauce after 2 layers. I found myself wishing I had put in more sauce as I ate it. Also, I suggest pouring water into the pan just enough to cover the noodles to make sure they cook. Don't worry, it doesn't seem to affect the taste at all!

LOVED it. I didn't use the cottage cheese at all though. Also, the pan I used was too big but it still worked out. I took another reviewers advice and added some water to the pasta sauce to add more moisture and stretch the sauce. I also added 1 small can of tomato sauce. I might add in another pound of hamburger next time too but it was great as is. I just like it extra beefy.

My family gave this recipe a two thumbs up.  I used a high quality pasta sauce with a bit of spice for a little kick.  A real keeper. Texture of noodles was perfect.  I found it needed one hour of baking covered, then 15 minutes with foil off.   P.s. I've been making lasagna for 40+ years.  This replaces my old recipe.

Great and easy. Kids finally know what lasagna is (other than Stouffer's!) Drained meat first then added shallots to the sauteed onions.. then put meat and sauce back into skillet. (I used Trader Joe's Arrabbiata Sauce-it's wonderful!)
Also minced 3 cloves garlic, and added fresh chopped basil into cheese mixture and used aged Parmesan w/Romano on top ... broiled top until browned..  BUT great basic recipe!  Thanks!(Oh.. had to leave out the mushroom-kids won't touch canned mushrooms - sorry!)

I doubled the pasta sauce- should have tripled it. And doubled the meat. Also I added italian dry packet seasoning (1) to the meat. Overall- easy recipe. Super fast to prepare. Oh- I also almost doubled the cooking time.

This was good, but there was too much of the cheese mixture. Next time I will double the meat, and only use 1 layer of cheese. Also, nix the middle layer of mozzarella. My husband is usually the big meat eater and I like the noodles, but even I thought it didn't have enough meat. Hope this helps!

Made this for the first time, and it was really easy. Also received compliments from my boyfriend (who wasn't just saying it to be nice!) I founds that I was low on sauce using the recipe as is, so I added about half of a 28 ounce jar more, and that did the trick. I felt like it would have also been good to have a little more meat, maybe will use 1.25 lb next time. Also make sure to season. The recipe did not say to, but I added garlic salt, pepper, and some Italian seasoning. It was great!

Overall, the recipe was ok. The amount of cottage cheese and ricotta was too excessive for the amount of meat sauce that can be made from 1 lb of meat. I used 1/3 the amount of the "cheese sauce" (ricotta, parmesan and cottage cheese) and added green peppers, minced garlic and lots of seasoning to the meat sauce to give it better flavor. I also used more than just 1 pack of mozzarella cheese. For me, there is no such thing as too much shredded cheese in lasagna. I used mild shredded cheese mixed with the mozzarella. Not bad.

This recipe worked out for me.  I made a big pan of it...used 32 oz. noodles, 4 cans sauce + 8oz. sour cream and 32 oz. bag shredded cheese and about 3 lbs. ground beef and a little water at the edge of the pan.  I may add one more can of sauce next time.  Great recipe!!!!  Thanks:)

This is a full proof recipe! I was missing ingredients, and it was still delicious! It's the first time I've ever made lasagna.  I was 4 oz. short of pasta sauce, I didn't have mushrooms and I didn't have the cottage cheese.  I used 24oz of Ricotta cheese to compensate for the missing cottage cheese.  I even accidentally mixed the mozzarella with the ricotta, Parmesan and eggs. It still came out perfect. I did add some pepper to the cheese mixture, but this is a personal preference. Thank you so much!

this recipe is great but I take out the mushrooms and I add another half of a jar of sauce because it doesn't go as far and I double the mozzarella cheese, because of the having to stretch the amount called for. my family loves it and my fiancé wont even eat her moms now after I made this for her the first time.

This is a very good basic recipe for fast (prep) lasagna, which is exactly what I was looking for this evening.  I also added a spinach layer and doubled the sauce.  I use plain sauce in a can and doctor it up because I hate all the added ingredients in jarred sauces.  My only problem is that I will never learn to stop squeezing the last layer on top.  Have a huge mess to clean up in my oven.  :o)

I ran out of sauce mixture on the second layer! Way more cheese mixture than sauce mixture. Next time I think I will just double the sauce, or use a smaller pan. Probably the 8x8 seen as my family could never eat that much lasagna anyways.

I loved this recipe! The first time I made it, I made two huge pans for a total of forty people, and it was super easy! For a vegetarian version, I simply left the meat out, added extra sauce, and almost doubled the amounts of cheese used. Everyone loved it!  It was just as good the second time in a much, much smaller serving, and still just as easy!

I used 1% cottage cheese, instead of what was suggested. I completely forgot about the mushrooms, but I used a portobello tomatoe pasta sauce which contained portobello chunks which worked great! I added 2 hot italian sausages to the meat sauce (removed the meat from the casing), which added a bit of spice to the dish, yumm!! Also, when cooking the meat and sauce, I added about 2 tablespoons of minced garlic.  I used half of the cheese & eggs because I was making the lasagna in a smaller dish.  This turned out fantastic, and I absolutely recommend it!!!

This lasagna was the best my husband and I have ever had.  I did precook my noodles for about 5 minutes.  Used 2 jars of pasta sauce as recommended by other reviewers and added in Sausage with the regular meat.  I did add in Garlic and Oregeno aand also used Onion Powder as Onions irritate my eyes really bad.  This was unbelivably good.  Thank you for the recipe!

This is usually how I make my lasagnas. I only use half the container of cottage cheese though and I always use 2 jars of spaghetti sauce. I think it need to cook for an hour covered though because my noodles were a little undercooked and kind of chewy..

Great lasanga. Like a few people mentioned, there's a lot of cheese mixture. We use a "Baking" Italian sauce and it's fantastic - I end up using 2-3 cans of sauce because I use the non-bake lasanga noodles (ALWAYS put sauce on both sides of the raw noodles, they cook no problem). Add a LOT of seasoning to the meat mixture otherwise it can be bland. Great for leftovers! My coworkers are jealous every time I bring it in!

this was SOOO good. I used 1 lb ground beef and 1 lb of italian susage and a 28 oz jar of sauce I also put a teaspoon of garlic in with the meat when I cooked it and put all the motzerella on top and drained a can of spinach and put it with the cheese on the middle layer.

Lasagna can be so much work, so I was very excited to see recipes calling for ready-made spaghetti sauce! I always use jar sauce and I add my own veggies and spices to make it more to my taste. I look for recipes just as a base for ideas, and then usually make it however I want with those ideas in mind. This was a very simple recipe and easy to make it my own!

I hadn't made lasagna from scratch since 8th grade, Home Economics class, at least 30 yrs ago, so I was ready for a challenge. But alas, one did not exist!! I used my leftover speghetti sauce, which I make from scratch, well semi homemade, canned stewed tomatoes, canned tomato sauce, ground beef/italian sausage (when I have the sausage on hand), italian flavorings, fresh garlic, etc....But I didn't have enough, so I just added more plain tomato sauce, water (not much, I like my sauce kinda thick)and flavorings and heated throughly. I don't remember mixing the cheeses in Home Ec's, but I want to follow recipes as they are written the first time, and tweak, if necessary, thereafter. I also remember boiling the lasagna before making our layers,back then, but again, i followed the recipe, as is. I just made sure, as one reviewer wrote, make sure pasta is covered with the sauce to ensure a nice "cooked" noodle. And it came out fabulous!!!!!  Here's the kicker, while I was at our local grocery store purchasing the cheeses, they had a sale on Stoffer's Frozen Lasagna Dinner, serves 4 for $18.00. (I thought, well it may be more expensive for me to make it, but at least its FRESH and Homemade!!!) For those of you who may be thinking, $18.00 DOLLARS, thats a sale?, well when u live in Hawaii, we pay double for almost everything, and sometimes more than that. Too bad our pay isn't doubled, huh! SO yep, thats a sale.  SUFFICE it to say, my family loved it, AS IS!! BTW, I bought regular l

This was a pretty good basic recipe.  I used 2 packages of ground sweet Italian sausage and omitted the mushrooms.  I also used 2 jars of pasta sauce.  While cooking the meat, I used chopped garlic and onion with some different spices.  There wasn't enough kick to it so next time I will probably use one package of the hot Italian sausage and one package of the sweet.  I will probably use two pints of ricotta next time instead of using the cottage cheese (It made the dish way to runny).

The regular lasagne noodles didn't cook well without boiling.  I added more liquid to the dish and they did cook most of the way but tasted somewhat starching. Otherwise tasty.

This is a great recipe, however I always cook the Lasana noodles on the stove according to directions to insure they are all done.  It also cuts baking time in half.  I always use Prego sauce and add some blush wine instead of water.

This recipe tasted exactly the way I expected! I am a CELIAC and used DeBoles Gluten free Rice lasagna noodles. I am so pleased with the results! I'm not able to order any pasta dishes in restaurants because of the wheat, so I must make everything for myself. This was a hit for me...and my boyfriend as well.

Great recipe- I served it for a big family dinner and everyone loved it! I let the noodles sit in boiling water for a few minutes before adding to the recipe...I did add 1/2 pound of sweet sausage and I needed almost two full jars of sauce, but will definitely make again.

This may have said easy, and it was, but it is still very time consuming.  The flavor was mediocre.  If I'm going to wait two hours for a meal, then I want it to be worth the wait and this wasn't.  My husband liked it, but I think it's because he's never had good lasagne :)

This recipe is OUTSTANDING!! VERY simplistic. If you get low or no fat cheeses, low fat meat - and then rinse it off and press it out a little bit, you can drastically reduce the fat. Im a semi good cook. I cant cook gourmet meals - however i can create and invent. Also another tip - make sure none of the noodles are left visable, as that part will be crunchy. My family and girlfriend loved it!! Im going to keep this one for sure. THANKS SUSAN!!!

Turned out pretty good.  I liked the cottage cheese part but the no bake noodles might not be the way to go.  The noodles were tough and kind of chewy, which definitely took away from the goodness of the entire recipe.  Probably wouldn't go that route again.  Overall not bad but i'll try another recipe.

Pretty good.  I added basil,garlic powder, annis, 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar (can use burgundy or red wine)to the sauce.  I also used 1/2 grated cheddar cheese for some tang. I liked the cottage cheese...all ricotta is a little grainy (it is a texture thing).

This was a good recipe, but NEEDS some modifications.  

When I made it, I didn't have cottage cheese, so I omitted it and only used 2 cups of ricotta cheese.  I used two 15-ounce cans of tomato sauce and seasoning in place of the prepared sauce, then added in about 3/4 cup water.

I only had enough cheese mixture and sauce for two layers of lasagne pasta, leaving extra unused noodles, but it filled my 9.5x13.5 pan to the top.  It was good I didn't use cottage cheese too, or it wouldn't have come out evenly.

Next time I'll use the cottage cheese too, add an extra can of tomato sauce, and probably use a 10x15 pan.

(I used Ener-G egg replacer in place of the eggs.)

This is the lasanya I grew up on. My grandma never added mushrooms. She always boiled the noodles. I tried it without boiling the noodles and they were not soft enough.

I found this recipe to be not only super easy but pretty darn good as well.  I added a few more cheeses and traded the groud meat for vegetarian meat crumbles.  Also depending on the type of sauce you choose you may wanna add a T of sugar to cut the acidity.

GOOD BUT NOT GREAT. This was a great meal, but not a great lasagna. It's definitely easy to make, and the noodles came out great, but I just felt that the end result was a little too bland for my taste (probably because of the store bought sauce).

This recipe was fast and easy. I used two jars of spaghetti sauce instead of one. It wasn't too saucy and stayed together when I took it out of the pan. I prepared the lasagna the night before and popped it in the oven the next day. It turned out perfectly.

This recipe was very good, however I used a jar and a half of sauce and thought it was still a bit dry.  I will use two jars next time which should make it just about right.

This recipe is absolutely wonderful, and makes possibly one of the best lasagnes I have ever eaten.  I made this meal for my mother and I, and she absolutely loved it.  I made only one adjustment by exchanging the mozzarella cheese for cheddar cheese.

Allergic to eggs so replaced it with Greek yogurt. Dad has BPH so left out beef but replaced with veggies and used 1.5 times the sauce. Added oregano, cilantro, nutmeg, paprika and topped with some olives. Will make again.

This was my first time making lasagna and it turned out sooooo good!!! I followed the recipe pretty closely, but used fresh mushrooms, and perhaps a bit too much mozzarella! Next time, I'll cut back on the mozzarella and also add spinach to the cheese sauce as others have done, and will also add chopped up bits of carrot to the meat sauce. I sautéed the onions first with some minced garlic before cooking the meat, and also added a bit of italian herbs to the sauce. I used 2x500g jars of pasta sauce as well. So happy I found this recipe as all the others I looked at looked like so much more work!!! Will definitely make again!!

Very easy to make & tastes great! I added seasonings to it which made it even better, otherwise it would’ve been bland in my opinion.

I used FF or reduced fat cheeses and cottage cheese. This turned out great, although a tad dry to me. Would definitely use more sauce next time but it was a winner on Father's Day. He had 0 complaints.

I cooked the beef and it looked like too little so I cooked a little more. And I still didn't have any for a third layer on top. I have the second layer of cheese on top instead. Next time something else maybe.

I have always shied away from making lasagna.  The way I used to make it took forever!  I made this and it cured me of my fear.  I did not follow the recipe exactly, however, because I didn’t have all the ingredients on hand.  So, instead of the cottage cheese/ricotta mixture, I made a béchamel sauce with butter, milk, and lots of shredded Parmesan.  It had the consistency of the cheese sauce depicted in the video that goes along with this recipe and it was super cheesy!  Much like making homemade Mac and cheese (don’t forget the salt!).  Other than that, I doubled the recipe and my family LOVED it!  Even my picky toddlers.  My husband said he thinks it was the best lasagna he has ever had.  This was easy to make and didn’t take very much time.  The Stouffer’ family size lasagna takes two hours to cook from frozen, but this took less time and I could make sure the ingredients were the ones I wanted.  Plus, I could adjust the taste to my liking.  Thanks for the recipe.  This will be my go-to for years to come.  No longer afraid of making lasagna!

New staple food in our home.
I make it without the noodles so it's lower in carbs.
No adjustments needed. Totally worth it.
Delicious.

You can never have too much ricotta.  This is SO, SO good! I did 'double' part of the recipe by using beef and mild sausage (1 lb each), 2 jars spag sauce-one tomato and basil and one 5 cheese. Doubled the cottage cheese and ricotta. Used my extra tall stoneware pan and it was FULL! Added 1/4 c of water on the top before baking, but it probably wasn't needed. Let it set up for about 40 minutes, but it was still super hot. (Thank you stoneware!) This is a keeper for sure and we will make again!! Did I mention you can never have too much ricotta?

My family loves this easy lasagna recipe better than my previous labor intensive one. I did use a 1/2 pound of Italian sausage and 1/2 pound burger, skipped the mozzarella in the middle of the layering and I did not precook the noodles, just made sure they were covered with sauce and it turned out perfect. All great suggestions from previous reviewers. I followed the rest of the recipe as written.

I made just a slight change by adding mild Italian sausage in with the beef mixture and fresh parsley chopped in with the cheese mixture.  I was told it was the best lasagna ever and would definitely agree!

This was my first time not to pre-boil my noodles before making lasagna and after this recipe I will never pre-boil my noodles again. Other people are correct when they say to make the tomato mixture a little watery and sort of thin so the noodles will have enough liquid to cook thoroughly. I did take some suggestions from other posters; I used a lb of ground beef and a 1/2 lb of Italian sausage. I also chopped up fresh garlic and added the garlic to the meat with the onions and added Italian seasoning to the meat mixture also. I also added a little garlic powder to the ricotta/cottage cheese mixture. Next time, I will sprinkle a little salt on the noodles. But this is a no-fail recipe.

Skip the ricotta if you want to use cottage cheese...less calories and you get the flavor of the cottage cheese.

I follow this recipe loosely because I have particular tastes. The sauce is not enough I need to use two jars and I always use more ricotta cheese and more mozerella cheese. I add mixed bell peppers, two onions and a couple garlic cloves. Regardless the recipe is brilliant I have made it exactly before and it's delicious I just need those extra things to make it better for myself. Not cooking the noodles saves time and energy and it's so easy. It's a meal for those who love more cheese and less meat. I also use a lb and a half of beef. Again all this is personal preference. I love it I will always use this as my guide.

The other reviews are correct. You don’t need to pre boil your noodles or bake covered  if you add plenty of sauce and a splash of water. Maybe just pre-soak the top 3-6 noodles, for 30 minutes, because mine come out a bit crisp and burnt. I did mine vegetarian style with sautéed onions and mushrooms and raw diced zucchini.  And a healthier version with skim cottage, skim mozzarella and No ricotta but 4 eggs instead of two. Also, i put the parmasen cheese on top, last minute, to broil an extra 5-10 minutes.

this thing was absolutely amazing. if there isnt enough sauce.. ADD MORE SAUCE!!! you dont have to follow recipes like its the law... i had 4 layers of meat and 4 layers of noodles with cheese on top and not in between. one piece was enough for a meal.

dont know what people are complaining about, not enough sauce, portions being off (what?), hard noodles (they are obviously doing something incorrectly.)  will absolutely make this simple hearty meal again.

I would modify what ALICES said about not making this the night before.  I put this together the night before and I used Trader Joe’s no boil noodles.  It was delicious.  I also added another 28 oz. jar of sauce to the bottom of the dish before layering.  Right before baking I poured 1/4 cup of water around the edges of the pan.

This is my go-to recipe for quick lasagna. 
I add some fresh minced garlic, Italian seasoning and one 15 oz.  can of diced tomatoes.
Lay the meat sauce on a little thicker.
The extra tomatoes give the noodles the right amount of sauce to properly cook.

I used 1 1/2 lbs. of lean ground beef, tub of ricotta, tub of cottage cheese, 1 cup of parmesan. Got rave reviews from dinner guests and, more importantly, husband who's never been a big fan of lasagna!

This is super easy!  I doubled the recipe and made it in a large disposable pan for Christmas dinner.  In the sauce I added an extra 1 1/2 cups of water to thin it out a bit.  It turned out perfect.

I made this and used a pound of sweet Italian sausage instead to which I added some crushed red pepper and garlic.

I also added some salt (Himalayan pink) to the ricotta cheese mixture. 

I ended up using two 24 oz containers of sauce.  The results were amazing. Best lasagna I've ever eaten!

This was an easy and tasty dish.  I have been trying to get my kids to cook more and this was a great one for Daughter and Grandma to bond while making it.  I slightly modified it and am very happy.  I increased the meat to 1.3 to 1.5 lbs.  I used a 28 oz marinara sauce and added a 14.5 oz can of Italian stewed tomatoes.  I omitted the mushrooms for the kids sake.  I used fresh grated Parmesan cheese and about 12 oz of mozzarella cheese.  By slightly increasing everything I was able to really fill up the 9x13 dish to the top.  I cut this into 15 deep pieces which easily fed 7 adults, plus a little leftover for lunch!

Excellent!  I did what another user suggested and mixed cottage cheese and eggs and layered that then the ricotta then the mozerella so you could taste the different cheeses! Also used 1 and 1/2 jar marinara sauce with meat. Family hit!

I also ran out of sauce!  I was told the next time I make it to just add water to cover the bottom instead of meat sauce. And I also add Crushed Red Pepper Flakes and Italian Seasoning.

This was a great recipe, exactly what I was looking for. I made a few changes though. I doubled the amount of meat sauce by using 1lb ground beef and 1lb mild Italian sausage mixed with two 24oz jars of pasta sauce. I also decreased the amount of cottage cheese to only 8oz.
The cook time on this was perfect. 
I'd definitely make it again.

This was great, easy too. Loved that you didn't have to boil the noodles. Came out tender and perfectly cooked. The changes I made were adding more spices like basil, Italian seasoning and lots of garlic to the meat sauce and I used more mozzarella too because cheesy is good!

It was easy to make! I added bacon to give it an extra meaty zing. Make sure to have some sauce for the top so the top lasagna noodle layer isn't dry.

Recently getting into cooking, I was excited but apprehensive about making my first lasagna.  I followed this recipe, and after a nervous 45 minutes, I pulled it out of the oven to add that last half coup of mozzarella.  It looked and smelled wonderful.  When all was said and done, I could not have been more pleased with this recipe.  It's a perfect blend of meat and cheese, compared to many lasagnas that I've had that skimps on one or the other.  The mushrooms add a nice additional flavor & texture, and I couldn't help going back for seconds...and thirds...

We love this simple recipe!!  I added some mush rooms but not a whole can & finly chopped them, so my kids wouldn't see them.  MY HUSBAND raved about this for days.  This is the first time I saw the tip (maybe in a comment?) to add a little water to the edges of the pan before cooking, really made a difference & didn't get any hard or crunchy noodles!! LOVE!!

Super easy recipe! I made this a couple of weeks ago.  My first time making lasagna, and was a hit with the fam! Will definitely be making many more times! I did, however, use extra sauce and a larger  pan.

have made this twice now and is delicious ,  but I vary slightly. I leave out the hamburger since my daughter is vegetarian, which does not seem to matter. I agree with other reviewers in the fact I have to add about 50% more sauce than the recipe calls for. I think the next time I make it, I am going to try doubling up on the mozzarella cheese.

This recipe is truly EASY.  I have only made lasagna once before and it was such a hassle with the noodles--NOT THIS ONE just put the uncooked noodles in and they come out just right.  My family loved it.  I will definitely make it again

Could use more spice, a little bland. But everyone in my family thoroughly enjoyed it.

I substitute ground beef for ground turkey and chicken breast to cut calories. Also used canned tomatoes instead of pasta sauce. Then used whole wheat lasagna noodles for healthier option. Came out very good and it was much healthier lasagna

made this recipe for a weeknight meal. It was tasty and delicious. I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 Italian sausage...and took some other reviewers suggestions to use half the cheese. I am glad that I did, the result was a delicious lasagna that was not overly filling. I also followed Allrecipes suggestion of pre-prepping on Sunday. with all my veggies ready, it was easy to put this together.

I'm rating this but have not tried it.  Just a thought.  Do not used preshredded cheese as it does not melt the same as fresh.  Grate the fresh cheese and add it to ricotta mixture omitting one step.  Always add nutneg and fresh ingredients when you can.  Three layers are better.

This was my first attempt to make lasagna and this recipe nailed it! I added a pound of mild Italian Sausage after reading the dilemma some folks had with too little meat. I seasoned it with my herbal witches brew (LOL). I missed adding olives and spinach during the last 15 minutes of cooking. Excellent  recipe and would recommend this.

I have made this a few times, last night I decided to use more meat which required more sauce of course. So I decided to use salsa, also added my own flavoring just as last time I made it. Made a big difference in flavor and there's no more left lol

Thanks for sharing thiseasy recipe!

I've never made lasagna before, but for some reason I thought I would try when I was at the grocery store. I knew that ricotta would be needed, so I picked that up along with some noodles. So with that being said, I made this without cottage or mozzarella cheese. I used only ricotta and shredded marble. I also added minced garlic, Italian seasoning, and basil. I have to say that I'm quite pleased with the result. The pasta cooked perfectly. I would add a tiny bit more sauce, but then again I used too little in the first place so had I enough to follow the recipe exactly I think it would have been fine. Thank you for the recipe! I also cooked it about five minutes less, but ovens all vary

I didn't add mushrooms or onions (not a big fan). Did not change anything else besides adding a bit extra of the spaghetti sauce. It was delicious!! My boyfriend loved it as well and insisted that I make it again (not even a week later).

Love this recipe! I make this recipe every time I make lasagna. My secret ingredient instead of the canned mushrooms are the italian marinated  mushrooms found at the olive bar at the supermarket. It takes this dish to the next level, I highly recommend it!!

Very good and my kids loved it, but I thought it was a little dry so I will add more pasta sauce next time. Also I would prefer using fresh mushrooms, but I used the canned ones this time because I had them.

This was my first time making lasagna and this recipe was very quick and easy. This is a recipe that you should customize to your tastes. I used no boil lasagna noodles which saved a lot of time. I also seasoned the ground beef with seasoned salt and omitted the mushrooms.

Like many other people have stated, there is way too much cheese for the amount of meat sauce. I will cut down on the cheese next time. Also, I will use low fat cheese and ground beef, because my dish had a lot of grease in it from all the fat.

I can't cook.  When I get in the kitchen, people get scared, LOL.  But THIS was a hit!  As others have said:  Yes, there was too much cheese mixture,  (had enough left for another whole layer, but no more room in the pan).  I just did as someone else suggested, and made sure every inch of noodle was covered with sauce.  (2 jars are needed) Noodles came out great even though they went in the pan uncooked. ( I didn't use "oven-ready" noodles).  I'll DEFINITELY be making this again.

This recipe is great!  I had never made lasagna before but this recipe made it super easy.  I omitted the mushrooms, and I followed other reviewers' advice and didn't mix all the cheese together at the beginning. I just mixed the cottage cheese with egg, then layered dollops of ricotta and parmesan on top while I was assembling the lasagna.  I omitted the mozzarella in the middle and just added it on the top at the end.  It came out delicious!  Super cheesy too - my fave.  I'll definitely make this again.

I will make this again.  Both my husband and I liked it.   I used 1 1/2 jars of spaghetti sauce.  Next time I will use 2 jars.  I added 1/2 pound of mild Italian style pork to the ground beef.  I used 2 containers (8 oz each) of ricotta and omitted the cottage cheese.  I added 3 cloves of garlic and some oregano and basil.    I used fresh mushrooms.    I used my 5 qt Dutch oven to cook it.  I ended up with left over noodles and a little left over cheese.  Next time, I will be more generous with the cheese layers.  No problems with the noodles cooking.  Leftovers will go in the freezer.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Don't know about the other reviews here saying there's too much cheese, some people are just too picky I guess. I found the cheese amount to be just right, and in all the whole thing turned out great.

I had some leftover hamburger so warmed it up with some minced onion and the mushrooms. Did everything else as directed. Added extra Parmesan on top, love Parmesan. Tasted great! Family all loved it, and it was relatively quick to make.

I have made mine this way for many years. Never ever have I cooked the noodles prior to baking it.(I never understood y they came out with "No Bake noodles ",lol but I'm no chef by any means! Only thing dif with mine is no mushrooms, eggs r ricotta , only bc my family doesn't care for the those items(other than the eggs but just don't use m n mine). I do use a bit more sauce than this one calls for but again my family likes it that way and that's what dinner is all about lol. I do sometimes add Italian Sausage but sometimes not. I make sure my top layer had plenty of sauce the top it with my both cheeses n pop it n the oven. I don't cover it at all bc again my bunch likes the slight crisp topping it creates. It's an awesome recipe  and so glad to c someone else makes it this way! My brother in law (who's Italian) always has called mine "Hillbilly Lasagna " lol, bc of the cottage cheese. Glad u submitted yours in!

Went with fresh mushrooms in place of canned. My jar of spaghetti sauce was a few ounces shy so I added in some water paired with tomato paste -- thickened up beautifully. All in all a very good recipe for a beginner like me and my family loved it.

Excellent base for using wild game.  Ground elk was the best though would have been much better had our Mastiff/Retriever not figured out how to open the oven door during the middle of the night.  After dinner, we put the cooking pan back in there to cool.  Upon awakening to tend to the livestock @ 5:am, I was greeted with a nearly empty Pyrex pan and a contented Mastiff.  My ire was not piqued enough to try dog, I will save that for my Lakota friend.

Made this with organic sauce, and beef from Trader Joes.  I doubled the amount of sauce (I used two jars). I also used the precooked lasagna noodles they sell at trader Joes (they come in a small box). I put more cheese on top with the parmesan and mozzarella (didn't measure it).  I brought it to a party and two people from New York, one a Brooklyn Italian, were going on and on about the lasagna and how it was the best they had ever had!  It was super easy to make. And you can guess what I will be bringing to my next party!

I substituted penne for the lasagna noodles & it didn't come out too well. I had 2 layers of each; meat sauce mix, noodles, & cheese mix. The second layer of noodles was not cooked, but crunchy. I think if I do make it again, I'll have to cook the pasta a bit (al dente) to make to suitably edible.

Oh my gosh! Thank you for this recipe. Let me start by saying I'm new to cooking and besides frying chicken this is the second big meal that I've done. It was the bomb. I made two pans on a Saturday afternoon, cut them into 12 pieces each they were gone Sunday night !! I was so happy that my family enjoyed it. I will be making this OFTEN.

Excellent, but I did use traditional noodles, cooked and added to the meat and onions chopped bell pepper, fresh mushrooms, zucchini and a lot of fresh herbs.  Family loved...will make again!

Very good. I used more meat though -- 1 lb. lean ground beef plus 1/2 lb. mild italian sausage. Used fresh mushrooms (sauteed with onion and garlic). Instead of mixing mozzarella into the ricotta mixture, I spread on top.

I have many variations on ingredients -- dependent on what needs to go in the fridge.  But this UNcooked noodle recipe is perfect for remembering HOW long to cook and MOISTURE content needed.  :o)

I made this last night as a treat for my boyfriend and my self and it was awesome! The only thing I added was a bit of frozen spinach which I defrosted first.... just to give myself the false sense of eating vegetables haha. Really so good. I can't believe how easy it was. It is a bit expensive though with all that cheese. I would make it again!

I doubled this recipe for a large group, adding two extra layers and used a square oven roaster pan. I added about an extra cup of water to the sauce because I've tried using regular noodles in place of no-bake and they tend to be not-quite cooked. This works perfectly. Let the dish sit for about ten minutes before cutting, too. Depending on the sauce you use, it can be a little runny if you cut too soon.

I made this some time ago, and I just remember it not lasting long after I made it... I mean I BARELY got a piece!

Followed the directions precisely, and it comes out fantastic! Obviously substitute different cheeses to your liking as the recipe and other (who've already commented)posters have suggested, but very easy to make!

Though this recipe was pretty good, it did not include any spices or salt in it. So I added a bit of red chilli to it which made it a bit better. Lasagna also needs to have a bit of a sweet taste which this recipe did not have and lastly the mushrooms should not be taken out. Otherwise it was a more than edible lasagna.

My husband doesn't like anything with speghetti sauce, but he loved this. I had to add another jar of speghetti sauce, and I cooked the noodles a little before I put them in the dish. It was perfect!

This was really good and super easy to make! I didn't use the mozz in the cheese mixture, just on the top. I added a layer of chopped broccoli and it really was amazing!!! There was definately not enough sauce and too much cheese mixture, but thanks to the reviews here, I was expecting that and added more sauce to the meat before putting it all together! Yum!!!!

This was an amazing dish. I skipped the mushroom and added an extra pound of italian sausage (there was more cheese than meat) to even things out, and used a 8X11 pan. Worked perfectly and a family favorite!

My husband is not a big fan of lasagna. He thought this was delicious & he said it was by far the BEST lasagna he's ever had! Keep in mind ...this was my very first lasagna I have ever made! I didn't really know how to layer the noodles so I had to call my gram lol I ran out of sauce & took the advice from 1 of the ladies below & added water to help cover the noodles to cook. I will definitely make this again!!

This is one of the easiest and best tasting recipes I've made.  I make it with sausage, and sometimes venison... each time it turns out perfect.  My grandkids love to make it with me...  they call the bowl of cheeses "glue" to hold the noodles.  Definately a keeper !!

It was good, but definitely not great. I like a lot of sauce and this lacked that.

Great recipe that you can add on to!  I added fresh chopped garlic to the onions.  Also mixed the mozzarella with the cottage cheese rather than layering. And added spinach to that mixture.  I've cooked it with ground turkey and it tasted just as yummy!

as a first time lasagna maker, this turned out quite well for me. i did make a few changes after reading other reviews: i only used the cottage cheese (24oz) instead of the ricotta, added some italian seasoning to the hamburger, and used a vegetable pasta sauce with mushrooms. i did run out of the meat mixture, but wouldn't change that too much. all in all, it turned out fantabulous! i did add about 1/4 cup of water to the edges to give it a bit more liquid to help the noodles along...it worked.

Very good!  There was a little too much cheese mixture, and I used less than called for in the recipe.  Overall a great and easy recipe for lasagna.

This was a pretty good recipe and my family liked it a lot.  I used a link of andoule sausage to give it a little kick and it make it better for all of the cheese sauce.  I agree that there is no need for the layer  of mozzarella cheese.  I seasoned the meat before cooking that helped take down some of the blandness.

Mine turned out a little runny but that's probably because this is my first time ever making lasagna and didn't measure right.  My husband and his friend loved it though.  Great recipe for first timers :)

Okay - it's a pretty easy version, though lasagna is never quick.  I found it to be too dry.  There are definitely better recipes out there.

5 stars in my book.  I used part-skim mozz, 4% milkfat small curd cottage cheese and the remaining ingredients as listed.  I also added one extra small can of tomato sauce - you might even want to add 2 extra small cans.  Overall VERY GOOD!

Turned out great, I used ground turkey and added more spices. The barilla no cook noodles work perfect for this recipe.

easy and tastes great!  but the noodles didn't cook all the way through, and i kept having to watch it for 30 minutes AFTER the hour of cooking, and just ended up having to put it in the microwave!  not quite enough sauce to cover all the layers...

I had never made lasagna before, this was easy and delicious.  I agree, it needed a bit more sauce and some garlic and oregano.

Definitely the easiest lasagna I've ever made.  The other suggestions made by other reviewers are a must; this needs more sauce and some extra seasoning to your personal taste make this recipe even better.

Very easy.  I did add oregano to the cheese mixture and garlic to the beef to give it more flavor.  I tried to add the mozzarela cheese early and cut out the last 15 minutes of cooking, but the noodles were still too tough. It needs the full one hour.  I also added 1/2 jar extra of sauce as other reviewers recommmended and it was good advice- the leftovers were on the dry side.

I think this recipe is just about perfect. I use low fat cottage cheese and lean ground turkey. i have made this 4 or 5 times now. Its so simple-and leftovers are great! Last time I made it my boyfriend asked if I could make it next time his buddies came over. Brilliant!

My husband loves lasagna in general and thought this was great! The noodles came out nice and tender and it was great not to have to cook them first. I left out the cottage cheese & mozzarella (only some on top layer) and put some spinach in there instead.

Although very easy to make, I would highly recommend either cooking the noodles first or buying the special no-cook noodles.  The noodles in my lasagna were chewy and unappetizing.

Not a lot of taste to this recipe.  I would recommend adding more spices or using a homemade sauce.  A recommended jar sauce would be nice, too.

Terrific recipe.  I agree with the other reviewer that the mozzerella is only needed on top; not between the layers.  I used ground italian sausage for even more flavor!

This was great!  I wasn't too sure how the noodles would come out, but they were very tender.  My husband loved it.  He had two helpings and took some to work for lunch.  I would add just a little more sauce next time.
