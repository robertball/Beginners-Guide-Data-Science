I made these and filled them with strawberries and coolwhip for a mother daughter tea at our church. Everyone commented how delicious they were.I made 140 of them by myself and they were a lot easier to do then I expected. I spent a number of days looking for something just like this to make. Great recipe!!!

I was really excited to try this recipe!  I made my own golden syrup from a recipe I found online, and perhaps that's part of what went wrong.  The flavor was great, but I had a big problem getting it to unpeel from my pan, despite heavy oiling, and once I did, it didn't really work when attached to a bowl.  I think next time I'll bend it over a small drinking glass, my bowls were too big.  Any ideas for how to make it not stick so bad?  When it set up it was too rigid, I couldn't get it to separate from my bowl without breaking.

ive used this recipe for years.  once you get going it goes quickly.  i wrap mine around a 1/2" dowel and then fill with whipped cream.  these can be made weeks ahead until needed.  if you have parchment paper or the teflon baking sheets use those on your cookies sheets to make the lifting easier.

So easy to make and so tasty, I had been wanting to make these for years but thought they were hard - finally gave it a go - so simple!! 
I used upside down muffin tins for smallish bowls which will be used for ice cream sundaes! Yum

I used corn syrup instead of golden syrup and it worked just fine. Great recipe!
