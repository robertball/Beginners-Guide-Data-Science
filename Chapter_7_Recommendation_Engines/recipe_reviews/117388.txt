This was SO good, and very beautiful too!  Simple to make, as well.  I don't have a bread machine so I did this by hand.  I proofed the yeast first w/warm water (110-115 degrees) and sugar for 10 minutes.  Then added the rest of the dough ingredients, using 1 cup of whole wheat flour, and adding 1 tablespoon of vital wheat gluten.  I turned my oven to 400 for 1 minute and turned it off; then put the dough in there to rise (after kneading for 8 minutes).  It rose beautifully.  I only had one onion, but it was enough.  It didn't really carmelize in the time stated, and I ran out of time (babies needed my attention) but it was good still.  Next time, I would add the garlic halfway through- some of mine burned and became a little bitter.  I was impressed with myself upon seeing how pretty this was!  :)  Tasted great too.  Ate this with Corn and Cheddar Chowder.  Great recipe!!

This was a pleasant surprise as I thought this would be good, but it's great.  I made a double batch preparing one as written with sharp cheddar cheese and the other one with mozzarella and thin slices of roma tomatoes.  I think the original recipe with sharp cheddar cheese is the best (plus 2 T of Parmesan as directed).  If I were to change anything it would be to reduce the butter (or olive oil if you prefer) by half as my pan was thick with extra oil and to add a pinch of sugar to the onions as they cook.  It seems like two medium onions will be too much, but if you cook them for 20 minutes and caramelize them, the volume goes down a lot.  I could see reducing the onions a little if that isn't your thing, but they do add a lot of flavor.  Here is the allrecipes link to caramelizing onions: http://allrecipes.com//HowTo/caramelizing-onions-step-by-step/Detail.aspx

This focaccia bread is not only easy to make, but absolutely wonderful! I was very impressed how well it turned out. I followed the recipe exactly, but used freshly grated parmesan cheese and mozarella cheese, instead of cheddar. I served it with Jamie's Minestrone soup, from this site and it was SO good! My husband couldn't get enough!

I use this wonderful recipe for both focaccia and pizza crust. For a different take: Roll out 1/2 of the dough as thin as possible on a floured surface and cut with a 3 inch round biscuit cutter. Repeat. Add some of your favorite goodies. The two roll-out method just makes easier handling (for me anyway). By doing this the little crusts really brown beautifully and looks excellent to serve. I alway spray with non-stick pan coating.

Pretty good, but I'd do things differently next time.  Don't cook the onion until golden brown.  Mine got burnt during the bread baking, so I'd pre-cook them less next time.  Also, mine puffed up a bit too much during the baking process.  I'd make a bigger circle with the dough next time, or divide the dough into two circles.  The dough itself is very tasty, and this will go good with the minestrone soup that I made for dinner tonight.

This was really good.  We made it and then couldn't eat it til the next day.  After a couple minutes in the oven just to heat it up, it was great.  I would definately make it again.

I used an extra ounce of water, but other than that the ingredients for this bread are right on! One thing I want to mention is that focaccia is not really supposed to be kneaded, so using the bread machine takes away from its true quality. Also, forget the butter and use olive oil, it is wonderful and is the way the Italians make it! :) It is super easy to make without the bread machine: Proof the yeast with the sugar and water Mix in dry ingredients until dough ball forms Set in dry place for 1 hour Punch down, place in well oiled pan for 30 minutes Bake 20-25 minutes, until golden

This is a fantastic recipe. I do cut back on the cheese on top a bit though. 1 cup is just a bit too much.
This recipe also makes a nice pizza dough.

Great recipe! Lots of flavors. I used 2 tsps of fresh oregano instead of Italian seasoning. I don't care for Italian seasoning. But that is completely personal preference. I loved it!

Thia had such a beautiful flavour and was a great success, even though it was the first time I have ever made bread. It tastes amazing! I will be making it for some family gatherings coming up, it's so easy yet has maximum taste.

Best recipe! I don't have a bread machine so I kneaded the dough by hand. I used all purpose flour instead. I also added thinly sliced tomatoes on top and used only 1/2 onion finely chopped. Delicious!!!!!!!

Wanted to make my own focaccia and this was the right recipe. The onions and garlic cooked in the seasoning makes a big difference. Also I like to brush my bread with good olive oil for flavor. Try the recipe for pizza crust as well, just let rise a few minutes then roll out thinner.

This was good.  My only problem was with the dough.  I don't have a bread machine and used my kitchenaid, and did not proof the yeast.  I think I will do that next time before mixing in everything.  Onion mixture was really good.  The crust didn't come out "doughy", but more like a crispy pizza crust, which still was good.

Everything really tasted good.  I toned down the onion a lot because of non-onion lovers, and this may have been the reason for the lack of flavor.  All in all I was happy with the way it turned out and will do again and ignore my onion hater family and just go for more.

Awesome recipe! For the leftovers, I microwaved them with a damp paper towel (so they'd soak up the moisture), as I do when reheating any bread, and it worked like a charm, they weren't tough at all. Yummy, yummy.

This is an excellent tasting focaccia.  I did have to add at least another 1/2 c. flour after the dough cycle was done in my machine.  I used 2 onions and carmelized those and added garlic at the end.  I also added dried basil to the dough.  I sauteed my onions and garlic in olive oil.  I also topped it with thinly sliced tomatoes and sliced basil leaves.  Also did divide the dough and made two smaller pieces.  I'll definitely make this again!

This smelled sooo good. I couldn't push myself to try a full bite- butter friggles me out. However- it was eaten with gusto right out of the oven. I can overlook my dad's smothering it with butter an garlic salt, as he is a walking heart attack that salts his salt and butter's his grease. He says with his additions it tastes like the butter-sodden grease bread at Little Ceasers [[that he raves about *every time*]]. First time making focaccia, an I thank you ^_^ en el futuro yo espero que sea  más sano

I made this last night, followed your instructions to a T and well, the result was a white pizza.  
This had enough cheese for 3 focaccia, and all you tasted was cheese.  
That being said, the bread itself was perfect, the onion and garlic seasoning were just right, but in the future I would down the cheddar to 1/3 of a cup, mix if with the parmesan and then yes, use that because the topping is supposed to complement the focaccia, not overwhelm it.

Wow!!!  Just did our first batch, and it is heaven!  The onions and cheese add so much flavor that it is fantastic plain.  The only issue I had was with the yeast, it did not raise well (maybe the 70-80 deg water is too cold?).  The net time I did it with warmer water, and let the yeast activate in the sugar and water before mixing it in with the rest of the ingredients.  We will definitely be making this regularly.  Much thanks to the recipe author!!

Wonderful easy recipe.  Didn't have any bread flour so I used regular flour and it came out great.  Would recommend a few alterations: 1 tablespoon butter (1/4 cup is way too much), and only one medium onion.

Great flavor!  I used half whole wheat flour but needed to add more (probably had too much water).  Remember to allow dough to rise on baking pan and not in mixing bowl (as I did)!  3 T olive oil was plenty to caramelize the onion.  I added garlic near the end to avoid burning.  Used fresh garden dill, thyme, and parsley as well as dried rosemary, oregano, and chili pepper flakes instead of italian seasoning.  Husband loved it!

Delicious! I sprinkled the top with a little garlic salt before baking and made a simple dipping sauce to go on the side - one 15oz can of tomato sauce, 1 tsp each garlic salt, oregano, and basil. Be sure when you're caramelizing the onions that you add the garlic in for the last few minutes, or it might burn. Thank you for the tasty, simple recipe!

This turned out wonderful!  Added some Asiago cheese on top of everything else which added to the great taste.  This will become a household favorite for sure. (Had to add a 1/2T of water in bread maker ~5 minutes in as recipe stated).

Very tasty and easy to boot!  I used 2% cheddar cheese and I think it gave it a bit of a funky taste but the carmelized onions and garlic were so good that it made up for it.  I'll make this again.  I think it would be good dipped in some marinara sauce too.

WHOA, if anything, this thing smelled waaaay too good. Very easy to make, tasted wonderful. I used half whole wheat flour (that's all I had), added super-thin tomatoes, and used an italian blend cheese (didn't have cheddar). I accidently over-baked it a bit, but the center was JUST done, so I think I'd need to modify something somewhere so that next time the top is just right and so is the center.

This bread is to die for. The bread has a wonderful warm taste, and the onion mixture is nice and sweet and flavorful. This is a great alternative to garlic bread or dinner rolls. YUM! The only alteration I made was using less onion. I only used half a large onion and it's still got a nice flavor. I will definitely make this again!

Fantastic recipe.......I love all kinds of focaccia and this one is tops.   I also made mine by hand and it turned out perfect.

I didn't have parmesan cheese so I used Asiago and boy was that a good choice.

This is a keeper ~ thanks for sharing a great recipe.

This is EXCELLENT!  I'll be using this recipe frequently - followed it exactly with exception of sauteeing onions first, then adding the garlic about halfway through.  The dough was one of the easiest I've handled and the end result was picture perfect - exactly what I had imagined and hoped for.  There are so many possibilities with this recipe! We're going to use it as our base for pizza next time.  I especially loved the addition of Italian seasoning to the onion/garlic mixture at the end. Wonderful recipe, thank you so much for posting!

easy and very tasty. I screwed up the measurements of the ingredients and still got rave reviews for tast and texture.

So delicious! 1 onion and about 2 Tbsp of butter were more than enough.

This reminded me more of a pizza crust rather than Focaccia bread.

I loved this recipe and so did my family!  I cheated and used frozen bread(thawed), then did the same as the recipe told me. Really good! I will make this many times over.

This bread is amazing. Every time my friends come over for dinner they ask if I'll make this recipe for them. I usually add some very thinly sliced tomatoes to the top along with the onion as an extra touch.

I screwed it up and forgot the olive oil and it still turned out. I chopped the onions. Dont do that. It would be much better like they said. They kind of got lost being chopped.  Everyone loved it. Even my 8 yr old son! And my very picky father. I cant wait to make it again and make it right. We all really enjoyed it.

This was really great - and really easy! I pureed the onions in my food processor (we don't like big onions), I also added: 1 teaspoon dried oregano, 1 teaspoon dried thyme and 1/2 teaspoon dried basil to the bread (added it the 6 ingredients in the bread machine) - makes it a little more flavorful :)

This is very good and addictive!  I didn't change a thing, other than pressed the dough out to 12" instead of 10" for a thinner bread.  I also cooked the onions and garlic for about 10 minutes in lieu of the suggested 20 minutes.  The flavor is absolutely delicious and paired well with the Cauliflower Potato Soup I made to go with it.  Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe!

Great to serve anytime. I make it large and thin, add an Italian mix of cheeses  and up the parmesan. I serve it at parties or as a weekend snack. Yummy the next day toasted.
