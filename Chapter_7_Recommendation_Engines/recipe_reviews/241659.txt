Used 2% cheddar cheese, but other than that, made no change to the recipe.  First, don't think of this as a substitution for mashed potatoes because you'll be disappointed.   You never can get mashed cauliflower the same texture as mashed potatoes.  However, this is a very nice cauliflower side dish, loaded with flavor.  We did add salt and pepper at the table, so I'd probably add that before baking next time, but other than that, wouldn't change a thing.  We're not vegetarians, but we enjoyed this vegetarian side dish!  Rachel, thanks for sharing!

I didn't use any reduced-fat ingredients. I, also, added chopped onion, 1 glove garlic, 1/3 red bell pepper, 1 tb. basil, salt and pepper. When mashing the cauliflower, I added 2 tb. of butter. I substituted cheddar with pepper jack cheese for a little more kick. It was so good! Thanks for the idea.

This was very bland. Def needs some spices to add some flavor.

Loved this! We are doing the Keto diet and used full fat sour cream and cream cheese. I did put salt and pepper before baking. Also sprinkled some bacon bits and green onion on top. Family love bed it. Thank you for sharing this recipe,

great recipe! I have made multiple times and it's very easy to make a quick throw together side. it can be made as written or you can easily cheat if your not in the mood to cook. I love fresh however any cauliflower you have can be cooked then I throw everything in my ninja, dump in a casserole dish and cook. I put on broil last few minutes to harden top.  I do add some minced garlic and season to taste. great recipe!

It wasn't bad.  I would add more cream cheese and beat the cauliflower differently to get it smoother.  I added onion, garlic (will add more next time), a little 1/2 & 1/2.  Next time I'll also add some sour cream.

My family LOVES this dish.  I am generous with ingredients, and add a whole bag of real bacon bits (because I'm too lazy to make my own).  great recipe.
