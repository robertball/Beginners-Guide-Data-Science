My daughter and I wanted to try something different for a gift so when we came across this recipe we just had to try it. The ingredients were simple and the recipe was very easy to follow. We halved the recipe and it turned out amazing! We will definitely be making this again.

Made this for an 80 yr old great-aunt for Christmas, she called the end of January for a refill because she had 'sucked it all up'.
For those who cannot have caffeine in the evening; use decaf instant coffee, you cannot taste the difference.

Simple and wonderful!  I halved the recipe and used vanilla flavored vodka.  Would make an amazing gift!

This is easier than some recipes that require aging before use.  I needed coffee liquor for iced coffee.  It was delicious mixed with cream and coffee.
