Over all good taste but there is way too much dressing for one head of lettuce. I made the meat and beans according to the recipe. The dressing is way too much - cut the mayo dressing by half or less - at least, just toss enough dressing into coat the "salad" and then top with the taco mix. Use what ever assortment of beans you like.

For any future person making this recipe, I want to let you know that it was somewhat tasty, but did not have the Mexican taste to it. The meat and bean mixture turned out delicious. The flaw is in the dressing. Four cups of mayonnaise is way too much.My recommendation is to use 1 cup or less of sauce for the meal. And I used low fat, which is 30 calories per tablespoon vs. the 100 calorie per tablespoon for actual mayonnaise. I will definitely make this again, but not as it reads.

So I had 1 can of mixed beans and I found this recipe. I'm glad I did. I cut the recipe down to 3 servings because JJ wanted a hamburger tonight, sorry for his loss. Instead of the ground beef, I used frozen "Gardein" meatless ground beef.  Recipe called for 2 TBS chili powder but I used 1. I loved this recipe. I had leftovers which I'll have for lunch tomorrow, thanks to JJ. Thank you for a fast great recipe Penguinite!
