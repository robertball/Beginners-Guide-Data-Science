This was a nice, warm, filling meal but nothing out of the ordinary. The topping was really yummy though.

It was a good way to use up left-over chicken. I agree that there were way too many dished involved- I had a whole sinkful by the time I was finished. I did substitute some whole wheat pasta and added way more vegetables to make it a little healthier. I think the amount of stuffing listed in the recipe was perfect- I doubled it because of the reviews and suggestions made, but I thought there was too much stuffing that way. Overall- a great and relatively cheap way to make a huge and filling meal.

This was a hit!  I followed the directions exactly, except that I used two cups of stuffing mix for the topping and substitued a broccoli/caulifower mix instead of the carrots and peas.  Very good, and filling.  I just wish I didn't have to dirty a pot, a pan, and a casserole dish to make it.  There was a lot of clean-up for a two-quart dish.

Good and easy meal.  It's not one that anybody is going to be asking for after they have already had it, but it's still good.  I used twice as much topping and it was pretty good. I also used a lot more mozzarella cheese, and I added corn to the vegetable part of the recipe.

A solid meal, and very easy to make. I didn't make many alterations to it except for using a different pasta. I agree with Jennifer that more topping would be satisfactory.

This was a good, quick and easy meal. I used two 12oz cans of chicken and added a little extra milk. Next time I will double the topping.

This was a week day keeper for my family. It's easily altered to suit your tastes or what you have on hand. I didn't have cream of broccoli soup so I used cream of mushroom. Most any cream soup would work. I also didn't have any mozzarella so I decreased the milk to about  2/3 a cup and added in some Velveeta (about 1/4 or less of a large carton). I used peas and added some chopped onions for the veggie mixture. Then mixed the butter and stuffing mixture with my clean hands to totally incorporate the butter. We really like stuffing so I used at least twice as much stuffing and butter. My family really enjoyed this. Thanks for the recipe.
