I tried this because it sounded interesting, and I had most of the ingredients already.  Wow, it was really, really easy.

I used vanilla yogurt instead of plain, and it was great.  If I do it again, I'll knead or roll the dough just a little to make the crust a little more smooth.  The bread was a little dryer than I would have I liked, so that's why I'm giving only 4 stars.

I doubled the butter to 4 tb, as 2 tb definitely did not make anything resembling peas!  Otherwise I followed the recipe faithfully, and it turned out great - light in the middle and crispy on the outside.  I have lived in Ireland north and south, and have eaten plenty of brown soda bread - this is much lighter than any of them, but it was delicious, particularly with cold butter and old cheddar cheese.

A nice, hearty bread. Would be great with a winter soup. Original review: I needed to use up some plain yogurt and I had some sesame oat bran on hand, so I decided to make this bread. I agree with everything the previous reviewer said. The dough was a bit dry, and I had to get in there and knead it with my hands to mix it.

This bread is a little dry, but otherwise I found it somewhat confusing.  Knowing authentic Irish Soda Bread and Irish Brown Bread---this is neither.
