This was a nice recipe. I changed a couple things, like half the sugar(if the fruit is sweet) and regular butter instead of margerine. Strawberries go really well to in place of the blueberries. HIghly recommended!

The BEST blueberry muffin I have ever tasted! I gave it 4 stars because I did alter a couple things. I used melted Smart Balance Omega 3 marg., added an extra 1/2 tsp vanilla, used a whole 1# bag of blueberries, and added a handful of pecans. This is my new go to muffin recipe! Can't wait to try with cranberries and walnuts and cherries and almonds!

This was my first Splenda *sugar free* recipe and it turned out great! I'm so very pleased with these muffins. Even my 11yo daughter likes em. 
I did only bake em at 350 and for about 18 minutes.

I switched to whole wheat flour and like them a lot better.  I have also used raspberries instead of blueberries which turned out well. My husband even likes them.

I gave this top honors.....mainly because anyone knows sweetener baked goods will never have the same crumb as sugar.  But, these were absolutely delicious...moist, dense, flavorful. I never tweak a recipe the first time I make it, but I did add a few extra berries, & baked in Texas muffin tins/30 mins for 6 muffins & they were wonderful!

Good recipe.  I never stick with exactly what I'm supposed to.  Made it 1/2 cut blue berries and 1/2 cup cranberries - chopped up.  They were great.

Great with a little margarine! Our diabetic household loves them. Pretty easy to make and not too much of a mess. Hint: Start the first part in a small bowl, and the second part in a BIG bowl.

These muffins turned out great!  I substituted 1/2 of Egg Beaters for the 2 eggs.  The muffins turned out very moist and you def. cannot tell that I used Splenda or Egg Beaters in them.  Delicious!

I followed the recipe to the T and the muffins turned out great.  I did use the silicone muffin bakeware, allowed them to cool as directed, and they came out easily.  My husband and I enjoyed them tremendously, with or without a little butter or margarine on top.

This was the best "light" muffins I have made. The hubby didn't even know they were light! I subbed whole wheat flour, egg beaters and added some almonds.

Good recipe! I thought they were a little dry and had a different texture than what I am used to in a blueberry muffin. Next time I will add a little lemon extract to give them some zing. Thanks for sharing this recipe.
