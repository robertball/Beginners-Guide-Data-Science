This recipe is very easy to make with ingredients most people would have on hand. While some may choose to add cream, we thought it was hearty and filling without the extra fat and calories.   Dress it up with some croutons or grated cheese....or not.  Great winter meal with a grilled cheese sandwich and definitely a keeper!

Outstanding! I used fresh plum tomatoes that I blanched, peeled and chunked. I used a can of diced tomatoes to supplement, two coarsely chopped carrots, added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce, and substituted vegetable stock for the water, then some chopped some pickled jalapeños. After sautéing the onions and garlic in a 6 qt Instant Pot I added the other ingredients, set the pressure on the “Soup” setting for three minutes. When done I let the soup sit for 5 minutes before manually releasing the pressure. I then blended with an immersion blender before serving.

Very good tomato soup, takes only 15 minutes to prepare, and is a great pantry dinner. Kids loved it.

FANTASTIC!!!  yes a couple changes.... I used basil..I love the taste of tomatoes and basil..plus to make it rich in protein I threw in a can of white bean.. they have no flavor so it didn't interrupt the great taste of the soup... The beans also gave it that creamy taste that we all love , but without the fat!!! This is a keeper!!!!

This was my introduction to immersion blenders. (Bought and returned all-clad, happy with Breville, which is dishwasher friendly). Worked like a charm. My edits to the recipe: omit butter and oil (because I want to live), add a teaspoon of sherry vinegar to boost tomatoes’ tartness. Never be afraid to adjust seasoning to taste. It’s different and a very good addition to lunch or dinner.

Could be a 5? but I did not follow exactly.  I was looking for a recipe to guide me on some proportions but had my mind set for a thinly sliced carrot and a few stalks of celery as well as basil.  I did follow the rest over all but used "half a much of the tomato.   I picked this recipe due to "canned" as that is what had - one dice and one sauce. I was fine with chunky variation and skipped the blender.  Adding a dollop of sour cream and sprinkle of cheese to each serving with a side of open top cheese toasted bread slices.

I made this simple soup and it was simply delicious!  I doubled the recipe and made it basically as written, but I'm sure I added a good bit more than a pinch of red pepper flakes.  This will be made often!
