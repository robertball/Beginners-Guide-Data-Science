This recipe was really, really good!  The downside was that you had to toast marshmallows to serve alongside the dessert.  This was not convenient so we just melted some marshmallows with a bit of milk in a saucepan and poured it over the dessert just before serving.  Another suggestion might be to use the ready-made marshmallow frosting and spread it over the top.  You might also try peanut butter flavoured ice cream.  My cousin accidently put 4 cups of vanilla ice cream instead of 2 cups but it was unanimous that the dessert was better with the extra ice cream so I'd recommend putting a bit more ice cream than the recipe calls for. All in all, a very good dessert - most people had two helpings.  Will definitely make again.

This was my first ever attempt at an ice cream dessert (they always intimidated me and seemed too much of a hassle!) It turned out great, was eay and delicious!  After I made it I thought it was boring sounding, but boy was I wrong! Yummy!  Looked nice too with the lines of chocolate and vanilla and chocolate ice cream! I didnt do any thing with the marshmellows...left those out completely!  A keeper!
