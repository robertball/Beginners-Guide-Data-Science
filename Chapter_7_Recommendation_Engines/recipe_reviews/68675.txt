Excellent recipe.  My husband loves gyro's and has eaten them in many different countries.  He says the taste rivals those. I made no changes other than I used already ground lamb.  Still ran it through the meat grinder.  Taste and texture were great.  Wouldn't change a thing. Thank you R.B.

I am about 3 months in to teaching myself how to ccok... I was worried about this recipe - but it turned out wonderful!  i used my hands to mix the lamb & beef (i bought ground lamb since i dont' have a meat grinder) wholefoods will actually grind your lamb for you at the meat counter. I would recommend this recipe to anyone!

The only changes I made were to add a little fresh mint, and I decreased the rosemary and marjoram. The meat turned out a little dry but that was nothing that a drizzle of tzatziki sauce couldn't fix. Served it sliced in pitas with tomato, onion and shredded lettuce. Very good. Thanks, R B Miller!

I did add a 1/2 tsp of oregano and thyme and didn't refrigerate overnight and it turned out just fine!!!

An awesome gyro meat. Time consuming, but the steps were easier to follow than other recipes I'd found and it turned out great.

This turned out great.  I used a bit less rosemary as I'm not crazy about it.  It took a bit of time to make but was completely worth it.  My family and friends love it.  Thanks.

This is an awesome recipe.  When I turned out the loaf for the second baking, I kept it inverted and it made the meat very juicy, not dry.  I mean, it's not what you get from a rotisserie, but the flavor is the same.  I made tzatziki on the side and added chopped tomato,red onion,lettuce and stuffed into pita.  YUM!

Excellent and easy to follow! Tastes just like the gyros we usually buy. I didn't have a meat grinder so I just used my processor.  I didn't cut the slices as thin as I should have and I pan fried them a little bit on each side in olive oil before serving. Definitely will be making this again!

We have made this numerous times and it always comes out perfect. Make sure you serve it with pitas and Tzatziki Sauce. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this the first time and it does match the meat you get in your gyro in a restaurants. I used ground lamb and ground beef, and pulsed it in my food processor, and it worked fine. My family loved it. Will make it again, since we love gyros.

I used ground lamb instead of cubed and just combined all the ingredients. We all thought it was pretty good, but not great. It was better when we sliced it and then broiled the slices a little to give them some browning.
