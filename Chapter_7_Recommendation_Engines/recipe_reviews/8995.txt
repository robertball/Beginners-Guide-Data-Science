What a delicious comfort-food meal! This creamy dish was wonderfully tasty. It took me a really long time to prepare it but I loved the results. I'll make this again.

I made this as written except I omitted the mushrooms. I think this recipe although easy to make was a bit bland. I didn't think the sauce was tangy as stated. My family didn't like it so much either. I added some cumin to the leftovers and that helped. Thanks for sharing but I won't make this again without serious alterations.

I made this recipe without the confetti top. I loved this recipe but my husband was indifferent. We described it as "chicken pot dumplings" because it was like eating a chicken pot pie mixed with chicken and dumplings (my husband does not like either of these kinds of dishes). The main mixture tastes like the inside of a chicken pot pie but there is no pie crust. The breading tastes like dumplings. I love both these kinds of dishes so this recipe is just for me!

A truly excellent dish one I am adding to my all time favorites. I did up the amount of vegtables a bit and only steamed them for a few minutes instead of simmering for 20 (personal preferance- I like my veggies crisp)

This was pretty good although a little bland. I loved the baked top on it though. That part worked out really well and I will add it to some of my other casserole recipes.

The topping was a nice touch on this casserole but as a whole we found this to be quite bland. If this much work was going to be put in a casserole I would rather make chicken pot pie.

Delicious and not bland at all! I did add a bit of garlic powder with the salt and pepper (because I add garlic powder to everything).

The taste was okay. The biscuit topping texture and taste wasn't very good.

I seasoned my chicken with onion powder and pepper. I believe garlic salt but not sure. I used extra chicken bouillon when cooking the vegetables. For the creamy mixture I didn't have worershiture so I used soy sauce and tapatio. (looked up substitutes). I personally wasn't fan of the bread topping but my dad was. it was bland to me. only put on half of mixture as I'm eating low carb and cut out bread. I didnt add extra cheese on top. my mom likes it. and she's picky

Made this for my husband. He loved it! I added garlic to the veggies, and fresh string beans (because I had them in the fridge). He added hot sauce (he puts that on a lot of things). This is a keeper for sure!

The wife and kid said it came out very good. Said it was flavorful. I used a left over chicken both white and dark meat and I did used a tablespoon of minced garlic in the vegetable simmer w teriyaki sauce 1 table spoon. Also did half and half between Bermuda onion and white onion.
