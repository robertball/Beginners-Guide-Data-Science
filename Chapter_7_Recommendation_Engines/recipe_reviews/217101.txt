I made a couple small changes, only due to what I had on hand. I used cooked breakfast sausage instead of ham, diced red pepper instead of green, I omitted the extra salt and I added a teaspoon each of garlic and onion powder as well as a shake of Frank's Hot Sauce. I made these into little handheld "muffins". I just sprayed my muffin tin with non-stick spray and poured 1/4 cup's worth into each sprayed muffin tin. 350* for a half hour and it was ready to go. I made whole wheat toast to go with and it was a very hearty breakfast. All I tasted was sour cream but the boys and husband thought this was really good, though my husband did think that it was a little bland. If this hadn't been served with salsa, there wouldn't be a whole lot of flavor to this meal. Even with that said, there's almost nothing leftover, they've eaten pretty much all of it. Next time, I'll try to throw in more vegetables (like fresh onion, garlic, spinach and shredded zucchini) and maybe a can of mild diced green chilies. I think I could cut back on the sour cream a bit and maybe add more eggs, as that is a lot of sour cream. For me, that's really all I could taste, aside from the cheese. I like the potential of this recipe.

Being from New Mexico we add green chili to most everything. I added 1/2c HOT fresh cut up green chili to potato mixture (can use can or jar), 1 small jalapeno chili pepper (seeded & chopped fine), 1t red pepper flakes, 1/2t dry cumin, 1T jar garlic, 1/4c finely chopped yellow onions.  After fully cooked, we garnished with chopped fresh cilantro leaves and green onions.  My family's favorite Sunday breakfast.

Made it this morning for Easter brunch. Everyone loved it. I used turkey sausage instead of ham and reduced the milk to 3/4 c. Also added chopped green onion. Recipe came out firm. I would not use so much oregano next time either. Personal taste. All and all would make again.

LOVED this recipe. So easy, so flavorful. I had to use the cubed hash browns since my store didn't have the shredded. I also added a small package of cut-up sausage links.

Big hit with all 20 family members at Easter brunch.  Will definitely make again!  Used fat free cheese and sour cream, family didn't even know!

This is a great recipe, and really convenient, because you don't have to lei it to sit overnight, you can just throw it together and put it in the oven. I use the southwestern style hash browns that come already thawed, that way you don't have to add the spices.

AMAZING and EASY!! Can you ask for anything more?? I make more than I need and then freeze the extra in pieces for a fast microwave breakfast on those mornings that just need more than cereal.

Really liked this and will def make again!!! I made exactly as directed BUT I prepared the night before for Xmas breakfast!  Per other reviews I knew it might be watery so I blotted with a few paper towels before I put in the over to bake.    Next time I might add an extra egg to the mixture.  Wished it was a smidge more eggy.

It was a big hit at Easter Brunch. It wasn't too spicy (perfect for a mixed crowd). When I make it again for just my family, I will add more chili powder and jalepenos. Easy to make and was great for dinner the next night with a salad.

Made it for a group.  The only thing I did differenly was lessen the amount of green pepper.  I think it overpowers the other flavors.  It is even good reheated in the micowave the next day.  Will definately make again and again.

This turned out great.The only modifications I made were that I used 9 eggs total. I wanted it to have more eggs than hashbrowns. I used less sour cream only because it was all I had in the house. My breakfast group loved it and my boys ate up the remainder. They all said I have to make this again.

It was pretty good but I think cooked breakfast sausage would be better than the ham.

I used this recipe as a base and made it with veggie sausage since my husband does not eat ham.  I didn't have onion powder, so I substituted dried minced onions and then used a combination of pepper jack and mozzarella in the casserole with sharp cheddar on top. Really delicious.

Very good! Added minced onions and a little crumbled bacon.  MUST serve with the pico de gallo - it really makes it come together!

Made this the day before the freak October snowstorm and lost power for a week.  Kept well in the cooler and reheated well on the grill.  A keeper.

A keeper! Made with just a few changes - used turkey sausage instead of ham, cut back the oregano, used red pepper instead off green, and added a dash of garlic salt.  Husband devoured. Great flavor and so easy!

I cut the receipe to two servings.  It was not runny (because now I see I missed the milk).   I liked it but my husband found it to be too spicy.  He does not like spice with breakfast.

Yum! I used red and green bell, cubed hasbrowns, and sausage. I added an extra two eggs because 5 didn't seem like enough. We all loved it! I just remembered--I forgot to put out the salsa with it. :)

Yummy! I used the little chunky hashbrowns (and didn't bother thawing first) - by the time this was cooked, they had an amazing creamy texture. I scaled the ingredients down to make myself one serving for breakfast. It took almost an hour to bake, so next time I think I would perhaps bake it at a higher temperature. Unfortunately I did not have any pico de gallo in the house, so I threw some jalapenos on top instead.

I offered spicy tomato bits along the side, rather than pico de gallo. Without the spicy tomatoes the kids loved it; and WITH the spicy tomatoes, the adults loved the bake.

This makes a delicious meal! I did not add the pico de gallo sauce--just sliced it up and served it. I do not care for eggs, but this casserole makes them taste good.

I have made this yummy casserole numerous times.  It is easy to clean out the fridge and add the left overs so it's always different. I do add more eggs as other suggested. Thanks for sharing.

This is my family's favorite recipe, and very versatile! I've made it with sausage, bacon, ham, and different combinations of the three. I've made it with the green pepper, with chopped red pepper, and our favorite is with a 4 oz can of green chilies and a couple tablespoons of canned jalapenos.  I like it with cheddar, I add a few extra eggs, and double the oregano and chili powder for a load of flavor. I've used regular salsa or fresh chopped tomatoes in place of the pico, but the sour cream topping is a MUST! Definitely a keeper!

Made a double batch for a breakfast club at my office.  It was a hit.  Had many compliments and a couple requests for the recipe.  Personally, I thought it was pretty good but not the best breakfast casserole dish I have every made.  I made three changes to the recipe: Substituted half of the ham in the recipe for Bob Evans sausage, used half green pepper and half red pepper to add additional color, and included the sour cream directly into the casserole instead of using on the side.  This made for a nicer texture.  Before serving, I also topped with green onion sliced thin on a bias for presentation.  I wish I would have added a finely diced yellow onion to the casserole itself.  Next time.....

I made this based on rating, but unfortunately I did not read the actual reviews before making it because I needed something put together quickly. I wish I HAD read the reviews! The hash browns really do need to be cooked ahead of time. They were soggy and not a great texture and made the casserole runny. And the ham was WAY too much. I put in less than was called for and I still feel like I'm just eating ham :/  And I agree with others that the milk to egg ratio is way off. Also, mine took almost 2 hours to cook fully! Not good since I was in a hurry. I would suggest making this in a 9x13 to speed things up.

This was good as is. I like to make the recipes as instructed first and then tweak a little. Maybe less sour cream and more egg. Possibly egg beaters and low fat sour cream and cheese for a lighter version. The peppers were still crunchy for my taste, so I may saute them a little to soften them up. All and all its a good dish and the girls enjoyed it.

I halved the recipe and skipped the pico de gallo and cheese on top. I also subbed a pack of cooked bacon and handful of halved cherry tomatoes for the ham and baked 30 mins covered and 30 mins uncovered. It was really good and my guests loved it!

I made this today for a bridal shower and all the ladies loved it!  I stuck with the ham because I knew sausage was also being served.  I prepped everything the night before which made throwing it together a breeze. Since some mentioned it was a bit bland I was heavy handed in my measurement of the seasonings.  I would totally make this again.

recipe is easy, but i made mine with real fresh potatoes, string not shredded, extra eggs, extra cheese, and with breakfast sausage, fresh onions, and kielbasa. no sour cream needed in my opinion. you can play with the fillers and all in all, i rate it a 4 star.

This is an amazing recipe.  I even made it "vegetarian" once by adding seasoned black beans instead of the meat and it was still pretty awesome.  However, I can't give this recipe 5 stars as is due to the problem with too much milk...like others' comments 3/4 C would be more appropriate along with a tad less oregano.  Other than that, spot on for what I was looking for in a crowd pleaser bfast.

Easy to make! I didnt have sour cream so I used a hefty helping of fat-free cottage cheese instead. I baked it for an hour. I also had leftover sauted green and red bell peppers and onions from a previous recipe.. so I just used that. Turned out great. I enjoyed it with hot sauce!
