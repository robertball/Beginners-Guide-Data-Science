I used that process cheese food they have and added my own olives. I think it worked. But I never did like processed cheese so that is a prerequisite here. Good combo and great instructions though.

I gave this 3 stars because it's way less flavorful than what I think of as pimento cheese.  I think I did improve it by blending the cottage cheese before mixing it into the shredded Velveeta.  btw I shred my own, but it does come shredded and packaged.  And instead of pickle relish I used actual pimentos!  Go figure.  It's definitely a low calorie version of the traditional pimento cheese, as that uses mayo or miracle whip!

I used store-bought pimiento cheese spread to make this. I would suggest you buy the best tasting pimiento cheese the store has to offer. I also put it on my homemade Amish White Bread. Personally, I would have given it 3 stars because the pickle relish seemed to overpower it. My husband, on the other hand, actually liked it. He said it was tangy and more flavorful than regular pimiento cheese.

I did not care for this recipe. Was looking for a spin on an old favorite...homemade.
