I used my Traeger pellet smoker. To adapt this recipe for that cooker, start with the 225 degree setting and crank it up to 350 once you add the hot sauce. I also used my own dry rub (DGD) consisting of brown sugar, paprika and spices.

This recipe was amazing!   I made them on the big green egg and smoked them at 225 for an hour on the grid with the plate setter legs up. Tossed them in the sauce, removed the plate setter and warmed the egg up to 350. Put them back on the grid for 5 min a side. The skin was crispy and the flavor was delicious!

I have been looking for a smoked chicken wing recipe.  My initial attempts at smoking wings didn't go so great until I found this gem.  Follow the directions and the product will be amazing.  Couple tips I've found take the skin off of the chicken, use hickory chips, and they are great with BBQ sauce if you have guests who don't like spicy food.

This is exactly how I do my wings.  Smoked then the sauce.  I really like the small addition of the worstershire and something I have not done, finishing up on the grill for a crispy finish.  Because of this, I'm going 5 stars here.   I  do think this recipe is too light on the butter & garlic, but this recipe still rocks.   All in all, great job!

Fantastic recipe! Used a Cameron’s Stovetop Smoker for the first time and it was super easy. I added more Cajun seasoning and cut the salt to half based on some of the reviews and the taste was perfect. The sauce was AMAZING. Next time I think I’ll smoke them a bit longer as the larger pieces were a little underdone. But truly a winning recipe!! Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic wings. I smoked them for about 2 hours with apple instead of hickory. But the sauce is amazing. Definitely a keeper!

Made this yesterday and loved it, I really love having a lot of sauce on my wings. With this recipe it is not necessary and I always want to do my own grilled wings.

These were a big hit! I couldn't help but modify the recipe a bit...I used smoked paprika in place of the Cajun seasoning, and I added a bit of garlic powder to the dry rub. I also brushed the wings with honey after I put them in the smoker. I used my Big Green Egg. They were delicious!

Even though I didn't get much of a smoke flavor, the great tasting rub and sauce made these wing delicious.  Moist on the inside and crispy on the outside with just a hint of heat.
I will try this next time by skipping the smoking step and cook the wings completely on the grill.

I loved these wings! Great flavor. I used Walker & Son's Slap Ya Mama cajun seasoning. I cut back on the salt somewhat because the cajun seasoning has plenty in it. Followed the rest of the recipe to the letter and they were spectacular. I smoked them in an electric smoker for just over an hour. Then I grilled them on my Akorn. Will be making these from now on.

These were excellent! Mine got a little overdone but that was my own fault. It's tempting to let them smoke longer than the recipe calls for but don't do it.  They may not seem quite done but they will get there in the final grilling process. These take a little bit of planning ahead and effort but well worth it in the end. I plan on making these every time I bust out the smoker. Excellent recipe!
