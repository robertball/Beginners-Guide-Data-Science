The last time I made these I only used 6 tablespoons of butter.  If the dough is too dry, add a teaspoon at a time of cold water until dough is to your liking.  Be sure to pat dry the olives to remove as much liquid from them as possible.  This helps when they sit for a while so they don't get too 'doughy'.  I also added about 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder to the flour before mixing in the butter and cheese.  I like the taste the garlic adds to this recipe.

Easy to make, boyfriend loved them, but although they tasted good (nice mix with the olives), I found them way too greasy.  Maybe next time use a lighter cheese?  Less butter?

This is a great, simple recipe. But we also used sliced ham inside, which was a nice twist!

Instead of using 1/2 a cup of butter, I used 1/3 of a cup.  I also didn't use the olives, and baked them as tiny patties on a hot pizza stone.  They turned out nice and crisp, and not at all greasy.  My cheese loving husband thinks there needs to be more cheese, but I thought they made a yummy cheese cracker.

Thumbs up from my DH. I had a taste for something different so I dedcided to give these a try, plus I wanted to bring a appetizer to a get together next week. Perfect time to try them out. They were excellent. I made a 1/2 batch to try. I used a chedder jack cheese. They had a very light, crisp taste, and the olive offset it nicely. My husband said the taste got even better when they were cool. Nice to know they don't have to stay warm. Thanks so much for posting. A definite keeper.

My hubby and boys LOVE these!  Try them with jalapeno stuff olives... so yummy!  To keep them from "falling flat" and looking like UFOs... use just enough cheese mixture to cover the olive.

These fell flat.  They looked like little alien space craft.  I added just a touch of cayenne.  Flavour was great and I got raves but  not like pictured.

This is good stuff, really easy to make. They're really like a cheese bicuit. I'd experiment with the kind of cheese I used the next time. Perhaps do a mix, make it more gourmet..add a complementary stuffing.

I thought these turned out very good, I didn't use quite as much butter as recipe called for (per other reviewers) and I added a touch of garlic powder.  Will make these again.  Thanks Jean!

Awesome, make again. Try to keep the dough thin, otherwise the ball is too big for one bite, and you can't taste the olive.

everyone loved this! The recipe wasn't clear about exactly what kind of olives to use so I used your basic green olives marinated with pimentos. They were great! I also added chopped green onions to the dough.

Made these and got good reviews from everyone!  I added a little garlic powder and onion powder. If you like olives, you will like these. I call them "olive bombs". :)

They turned out really good. One slight modification:
1) I would increase the baking time to about 17 minutes. Some of my puffs were still doughy in the center, but that might have been because they were too thick. 

I tried making some with olives (kalamata olives - the good kind!) and some plain, just in case they didn't turn out too good, so I wouldn't have wasted the olives. But the ones with the olives turned out way better than the plain ones!! :) 

Definitely a keeper!

Oh my goodness!! I made this appetizer for my foot spa party and my guests went crazy. It was kinda greasy but on the same token, very tasty.

This recipe was a bit difficult to execute.  The  dough was very sticky.  I ended up adding almost another cup of flour just so I could handle it.  I used 1 1/2 c cheese (ran out) and it was still very cheesy.  I did add salt, a little garlic as others suggested.  After adding the extra flour is was easy to roll and cover the olives.  Black olives tasted better than the green when cooked.  Even cool the puff coating was good, but not the olive flavor.   Not real keen on the overall taste.  This would be very tasty with mini hot dogs.  I did cook for 17 minutes and had no problem with doughy centers.

This had no flavor to it until I added some extra stuff to it (I did do the recipe without the green olive).  I threw in some garlic powder, seasoning salt, grated parmesan cheese and a little water to help stick it together. They turned out better and they were gone at the party.

I made this for a "happy hour" event.  Everyone said that it was delicious with an olive surprise.  Not one was left over.  This is an easy recipe that was a big hit.

I made these without the filing. Of 7 people tasting these, 6 loved them, 1 did not. This recipe made approx. 25 1" balls. Next time I would try baking them a few minutes longer for more crunch. This is a repeat recipe.

I made these last night and all though they were good they didnt come out right. My balls went flat. They were also a little dry. I put lil smokies and onions in them, they were good. I just did something wrong.

Made these for DH's poker night.  Guys liked them, but I got a better response on grilled cheese.  I personally did not care for them, but I'm not a big olive fan.  Might want to have a drink close by as they seemed a bit dry and slightly salty.

The mixture is too dry so I added more sauce and butter.  The smaller the olive the easier to put inside the dough.  I just indented the ball I rolled easier, and wrapped the opening from indents.

Does not make a lot so double the recipe for a party.

Seemed like a lot of work, making each piece of dough to put around the olive... but wow!  So worth it.  I had to add liquid, used half and half, until soft enough to work with.  I think I will double it next time. Only made about 24. I think they'll disappear quickly!
