This is a great recipe. I have followed it more than a dozen times and I have tried variations. Most of the failures reported here are yeast-bread related. This, of course, means that you must take a lot of care with the bread basics. As described in the recipe, proof your yeast in the warm water. Give it 5 minutes or more. If you do not see a good healthy foaming action, toss it and start over. Dough handling is key. This is a rich dough with milk, egg and shortening. It is stretchy and yes, sticky. You don’t need to get stuck to it. When handling it, in the kneading and in the rolling and cutting, use flour to keep it manageable, but take care not to add so much flour that you change the ratio. I believe this recipe is correct. Some bakers reviewing here have noted the bread of the donut as being “not sweet enough”. This yeast bread rises prior to frying and then gets a big lift when dropped in the oil. Do not increase the sugar. I have tested in steps all the way to a doubling of the sugar. The only effect is that the dough becomes heavy and the taste approaches that of a cake donut. The recipe is correct. For this donut you want the lightness and the lift. The sweetness is in the glaze. If you want it sweeter, top it with a heavier glaze. For those of you with a BREAD MAKER, try it. Put the ingredients in exactly as listed and run on a dough-only setting. Turn the dough out onto your surface. Do not knead again, the machine did that. Avoid a full punch down. Press and rol

These were absolutely delicious! Not Krispy Kreme in texture, but I think they are as close as you can get at home and the taste was RIGHT ON THE MONEY! 
    *I saw where someone said they would scald their milk, I highly reccomend you NOT do that as it will kill your yeast. Anyone who knows yeast will automatically know that. You can't have your yeast mixed with anything warmer than lukewarm. 
   *If you don't have enough glaze, just thin it a little with some more water. I would not change a thing, including adding more sugar as some have recommended. If you have a really sweet tooth, okay, but the glaze makes them sweet enough for me and my family.
    *I also saw where someone said they could get greasy if not eaten right away. To avoid your doughnuts absorbing the grease, simply make sure your grease is hot enough. I alway heat my oil for at least five minutes or so on medium high to ensure this and then turn it down to medium before cooking with it. NOTE: Use cooking oil with a high smoke point to avoid fires! 
 I will definitely make these again. Perhaps with cake flour next time and see if the texture is close to Krispy Kreme, but they are THE BEST homemade doughnut I have had to date.

I really liked this recipe, the donuts tasted very good.  However, I omitted the half cup of warm water and sprinkled the yeast directly into the milk.  Reducing the liquid allowed the dough to develope much better with less flour. To keep the donuts from "deflating" after they have risen, place them on a square of waxed paper that has been sprayed with Pam or cooking oil.  When transferring to pan for frying, pick up waxed paper carefully by the edges and gently let the donut slide into the hot oil.  Any attempt to move the donuts with a spatula resulted in the donut "falling" and having a heavy texture when cooked.  Cook only light brown and turn, as any more cooking results in a dry donut.  These were fun to make but a little labor intensive.  The recipe makes GREAT bread rolls!  JIMBO

These are a little time consuming but are worth the effort!! First of all, the recipe made almost double the amount stated, but that may have been due to my using a glass instead of a regular donut cutter, then a tiny round cookie cutter for the hole. I have never tasted KK donuts as I'm in Canada, but my b/f is from NY and when he tasted them the first thing he said is "they taste just like Krispy Kreme's".  I never showed him the recipe or any reviews, or even told him they were supposed to taste like KK's.  So I'm thinking they MUST taste a least a little bit like them if that's what someone says after taking just one bite. Anyway, whether they taste like KK's or not, the are EXCELLENT donuts.  I had to make extra glaze because there just wasn't enough for the 30 donuts & 30 holes this recipe made.  I added a small amount (approx 1/8 tsp) of maple extract to the glaze for the second half of the batch for a slightly different flavour.  I also noticed that when I cooked them at 325 (as recommended by a previous reviewer) they came out a lighter colour and slightly more tender than cooking @ 350. But really, whatever temp you cook them at, you really can't go wrong.  I've made this recipe 3X so far and I have yet to screw it up.  I think the only way you could mess it up is if you have the yeast or the oil at the wrong temp....or maybe don't let the dough rise long enough.  Other than that, this recipe is pretty fail proof...and probably the best donuts I've ever tasted.

Glaze doesn't have to be anything more than 10x sugar and a little milk and perhaps a splash of vanilla .. heat the mixture in the microwave til it crystallizes and it will stand the test of a day... for chocolate add the cocoa to the sugar first, mix then add milk til it reaches a nice soupy paste heat and use!  I bake for a local bakery and make doughnuts every weekend for the farmers' markets trust me the glaze doesn't need to be complicated.  BTW I dip the glazed doughnuts while wet into coconut and they are a big hit!!

I live in England and I was looking for a recipe similiar to a Krispy Kreme from the US or Tim Hortons in Canada, and this recipe is it.  They are so good that they are to die for and they were gone as soon as I glazed them.  One note fry them at about 325 at 350 I burned some of them.

I have never visited the doughnut shops these doughnuts are named after and now I'll never have to when I can produce such fabulous product right in my own home!
I saved some time by placing ALL ingredients at once in my mixer and let the dough hook do the kneading.  First rising takes slightly less than an hour. 
Glazing: I threaded the doughnuts onto chopsticks to drain, than placed on rack to cool.

This recipe delivered *exactly* what it said it would.  The doughnuts tasted really (ahem) crispy and creamy but were slightly heavier than the store-bought ones (which is, I think, more the fault of the flour than the recipe).  If you follow the directions carefully the doughnuts will turn out delicious.  For perfect dough rising: heat your oven to 200 degrees F for one minute, let the door stand open for a few seconds then place the covered dough inside.  Remember to keep an eye on it so it doesn't over-rise and collapse!  For this recipe the dough should be doubled in 30-40 mins (but remember, this all depends on how warm you keep your oven).

I was amazed - my first time making these I came darned close to those glazed donuts we all love (and can't yet get where I live)!  I am looking forward to my next batch. :-)

I tried both large and small sized donut cutters and the small made a better donut. I also made donut holes and they were fabulous.  It is important to keep the glaze relatively thin or you will get too much on the donuts and they will get heavy and too sweet.  A little goes a long way!

I have made over 300 donut using this recipe and here is what I have learned- This is suppose to be a sticky dough, do not expect it to be like a bread dough. Be careful not to add more flour than called for, this seems wrong, but trust the recipe. Adding more flour will only result in a denser, tougher donut. For this reason you should not hand knead, use your kitchenaid to do the kneading. You will know the dough is done kneading when it pulls away from the sides. On speed 4 and this would take 5-10 minutes. The dough will still be sticky, but not nearly as sticky as pre-kneading. Let it rise in a greased bowl. I also rolled it out with cooking stray instead of flour. The result was the most delicate and crispy donut, light and sweet!

This recipe is awesome! Even though I did do some tweaking. When I told my husband I was going to try this recipe, he asked if I could make Boston Cream Doughnuts instead of just glazed. I used this recipe for the dough, but made the dough in my bread maker: all wet ingredients go in first (made sure the shortening was in small pieces though), then the dry, then last make a small well in the dry ingredients and add the yeast (4 1/2 tsp equals 2 envelopes, I buy my yeast in bulk.) By using the bread maker it skips steps 1 & 2 and you don't need to let the doughnuts rise again after cutting them out. I cut the doughnuts using a biscuit cutter instead. My doughnuts rose to the surface while frying, I just flipped when they looked golden brown, less than 1 min. per side with the deep fryer set to 356 degrees (closet temp it had to 350). I dunked the donuts in the glaze when the excess oil dripped off but were still warm. Oh, but to the glaze I added 1/4 cup of cocoa  when I added the sugar and kept it warm on the stove for better dunking. For the filling, I took that from the "Cream Puffs" recipe on this site. 2 boxes pudding mix, (I actually preferred the cook & serve over instant) 2 cups heavy cream and 1 cup milk. Make the same as would the pudding. Nice and creamy. I injected it into the cooled, glazed, donuts with a cookie press that has a funnel tip. AMAZING!!! Just like the doughnut shop! Thanks for the recipe, this site is awesome!

This is a great recipe.  It's very easy with a Bread Machine.   DIRECTIONS FOR BREAD MACHINE 1.	Sprinkle 4 1/2 tsp bread machine yeast over the warm water, and let stand for 5 minutes, or until foamy.  2.	In Bread Machine bowl, pour in the yeast mixture, then remaining ingredients in the order given above. Set bread machine for dough only cycle. Dough is ready when doubled in size and if you touch it the indention remains.  3.	Turn the dough out onto a floured surface, and gently roll out to 1/2 inch thickness. Cut with a floured doughnut cutter. Let doughnuts sit on parchment paper or waxed paper that has been sprayed with Pam and rise again until double. Cover loosely with a cloth.  4.	Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in confectioners' sugar and vanilla until smooth. Remove from heat, and stir in hot water one tablespoon at a time until the icing is somewhat thin, but not watery. Add some cocoa powder if you prefer chocolate icing.  Set aside. As icing thickens, add a little more warm water to soften.  5.	Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large heavy skillet to 325-345 degrees F. Slide doughnuts into the hot oil using a wide spatula. Turn doughnuts over as they rise to the surface. Fry doughnuts on each side until golden brown. Remove from hot oil, to drain on a wire rack. Dip doughnuts into the glaze while still hot, and set onto wire racks to drain off excess. Keep a cookie sheet or tray with paper towels on it under racks for easier clean up.

These are awesome!!  I decided to master doughnut making and found this recipe.  My first attempt was a flop, but I found success on my second.  I didn't use a doughnut cutter but rolled a thick rope and pinched the ends.  If the hole was too small I pulled the circle of dough bigger.  I laid these on a well floured counter (so they don't stick and deflate when you move them into the oil), covered with a towel, next to where the hot oil was going to be.  They rose better than I expected there (I'd say I waited about 30 minutes).  I started them in the oil when it got slightly past 325 because they got too brown on my first batch at 350.  I only made a half batch (it made 11 good sized doughnuts for me).  I did use a whole batch of glaze though and had JUST enough.  I left that thicker than the first time also because it runs off quite a bit.  Even with a whole recipe of glaze I still used a scraper on the dripping from the cookie sheet I used under them to get some glaze on the last two doughnuts.  One last bit of advice, don't let them rise too much on the counter.  They puff up in the oil to a nice size (I let them rise too much on my first batch and they deflated when I moved them).  Delicious--my family LOVES these!

THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME MAKING DOUGHNUTS AND MY HUSBAND DIDN'T KNOW I MADE THEM AND HE EAT 4 BUT WHEN HE HAD THE FIRST ONE HE SAID I DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY HAD A KK DOUGHNUT SHOP HERE IN TX I SAID THEY DON'T I MADE THEM, I WAS SO HAPPY BUT I DID PUT 1 CUP OF SUGAR, 1 TEASPOON OF VANILLA EXTRACT, 1/2 TEASPOON OF BUTTER EXTRACT ,1/4 TEASPOON OF GROUND NUTMEG AND 1/3 TEASPOON OF CINNAMON AND I ALSO USED 1/2 BREAD FLOUR AND ALSO ABOUT MAYBE 1 MORE CUP OF FLOUR BECAUSE MY DOUGH WAS KNID OF STICKY. SO IF YOUR DOUGH IS TOO STICKY YOU CAN ADD MORE FLOUR BUT MAKE SURE NOT TO ADD TO MUCH AND LAST TO MAKE YOUR DOUGH RISE FAST COVER DOUGH ,TURN YOUR OVEN ON TO WARM FOR MAYBE ABOUT 2 MIN AND THEN TURN OVEN OFF AND THEN PUT COVERED DOUGH IN OVEN FOR ABOUT 30 MIN'S. THIS SHOULD HELP YOUR DOUGH RISE. I HOPE THIS HELP'S SOMEONE!!   THINK SO MUCH I WILL BE MAKING THEM EVERY SUNDAY AND ALSO I WOULD GIVE THEM MORE STARS IF ALLRECIPES.COM WOULD HAVE LET ME YOU ALL HAVE TO TRY THIS RECIPE AND PLEASE ALSO KEEP IN MIND THAT WHEN TRYING SOMEONE RECIPE YOU MAY NEED TO ADD OR EVEN TAKE AWAY FROM A RECIPE TO GIVE IT YOUR OWN TASTE,,,THANKS SO MUCH TERRY137

10 stars!!  Not like kk or tim hortons, but excellent homemade style bakery doughnuts!  Made as written.  I found instructions to be vague in some areas so here are my tips:  mine needed only 4 1/2 cups flour, as soon as it was a ball i took it out of the bowl and added flour (as instructed) until it wasn't sticking to my fingers.  Let it rise for 1 hour.  Didn't have doughnut cutter (think i'll invest) used large glass and lid from hot sauce bottle.  Made about 2 dozen donuts.  Let these rise for an hour again.  The glaze I was really unsure about but it made enough to thoroughly coat all donuts.  They cooked fast even at 325 in fact i thought they would be raw.  About 30 seconds per side at 325 was perfect.  I also used my huge salad tongs and this worked fine to flip/transfer/frost.  Threw all the 'timbits' aka holes into freezer bag with powdered sugar until well coated.  My only teeny tiny complaint was that they could have been a little sweeter, just a personal preference, but still definitely a fabulous recipe:D

These doughnuts are ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.  I could eat my weight in them!!!  (Which is going to increase unfortunately now that I have discovered this recipe!!!!!)  These are not too hard to make, I put all of the dough ingredients in my KitchenAid mixer like someone else had suggested and it worked really well.  I did need to add a little more than 5 cups of flour, not that this was a problem, just in case anyone else runs into this.  These are just fabulous, enjoy!  Your family will love you for making these.

These took 3 HOURS to make, made a mess in my kitchen, and looked like deformed lumps..... BUT THEY WERE SOOOOO GOOD! I will make these again, and hopefully they will turn out like the beautiful ones in the picture! Only gave them 4 stars because of the mess, and I had trouble frying them. HELPFUL TIP: When you are letting them rise, do it on a FLOURED cookie sheet or cutting board! Also, make sure your oil is not to hot, and make the hole in the middle pretty big, because when you let them rise, it gets smaller! 
If you are looking for a CHOCOLATE GLAZE RECIPE, here is a great, easy one that takes literally 2 minutes! 3/4 cup chocolate chips, 3 tablespoons butter, 1 tablespoon corn syrup, and 1/4 cup vanilla! Melt the chocolate with the butter in the microwave for 40 seconds (Or until melted) and stir. Add the corn syrup and vanilla and stir again, then its done! Thanks!

Not that this needs another great review, but I have to share! These are fantastic! My dough used almost 6cups flour before it didn't stick to the bowl, but it turned out fine! I used the satiny chocolate glaze for the chocolate ones and rolled some of the doughnut holes in cinn/sugar mix. I will not be going to Krispy Creme anymore!!! This is a little time consuming, but well worth the effort!!! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!! P.S. I do not have a deep fryer so I used my iron skillet with about 2" of oil in it. Preheat the oil in it on med/high heat about 5 min. Then when you start cooking drop down to med. Watch these carefully they will brown quickly. (I got a few overbrowned)

Perfectly delicious! I don't have a bread machine, but I just let my yeast proof and then knead it for 5 minutes or so. I followed the recipe exactly and it worked out great. Make sure to add the flour slowly, otherwise you might end up with a dry dough that is hard to fix. Turn the oven on to 150 degrees and then turn it off once it is preheated. Then put the covered dough in their to rise. It works every time! We shook some in a bag with cinnamon and sugar, made some with the glaze listed, and also made a chocolate glaze! Soooo good.

Oh my goodness! Excellent!! This was my first time making doughnuts, I just never thought they would turn out correctly. After reading the reviews on this one, I decided to try it and they are perfect! They look and taste like real doughnuts!! I'm so proud!! This is a must try.

Absolutely amazing. You can do much more with the dough too - add chopped apple and pecans with cinnamon for a fritter.

These were amazing! We ecspecially loved the doughnut holes. I had to add extra flour. Also I reccomend making double the glaze. I've made this twice and both times I had to stop and make extra glaze. My first doughnut attempt and a complete success!

These doughnuts were incredibly soft and chewy yet still crispy on the outside, and they even stayed fresh like that the next day.  They were better than ANY doughnut that I have ever purchased at any of the leading doughnut shops.  I stuffed some of them with a blueberry filling I made and they were awesome too!

The recipe isn't "new". It's actually the same donut recipe I have in my 1950's cookbook. But it is a good one. I think the problem some people had with the recipe might be easily fixed if they were given some "hints." 1. The dough will not "rise" in a cold room, set the heat at 75, put on a light-t-shirt and wait. Also, do not place in a warmed oven, often this kills the yeast. Better slow and steady. The dough does need time to rise ( sometimes hours) so I wouldn't attempt to make this if you are in a hurry. 2.The dough is a sticky,soft and somewhat wet dough. I use my kitchenaid with a dough hook. To "know" when there is enough or the right about of flour the dough will cleanly pull off the sides of the mixing bowl yet have a small "stem" of dough attached on the center bottom of the bowl. You can slowly add one tablespoon of flour at a time if the sides continue to stick. Allow it to "knead" in the mixer for atleast 5 minutes do not add too much flour, this is not a dry bread dough. 3.For people who seemed to think the glaze was "bland" or lacking flavor, I followed the recipe with half the vanilla and added a little orange zest and instead of hot water, added hot orange juice ( I also doubled the recipe and glad I did). I did wish I would have added a little more yeast to make them rise a little higher and more fluffy. I might try 2 packages, plus 2 tsps next time. They are tasty. Would have given it 5 stars, but it's not new or original. :)

I decided to try baking these.  Willing to settle for a less KK taste & a slightly heavier donut  while knowing that the glaze adds so much to these, I:

#1 halved the recipe
#2 used 100% whole wheat flour + 2 tsps. cinnamon
#3 did first rise in bread machine
#4 did second rise in oven at lowest possible temp #5 After 35 minutes on 2nd rise, I turned oven up to 375° & let bake for 14-17 minutes.  
#6 I glazed immediately.

The donuts themselves were not very sweet but the glaze took care of that.  Unlike the fried donuts, they keep better in the fridge and don't have to be warm to taste great.  We had tried them the original way first and they were fantastic that way too!  But we wanted something we could easily refrigerate and that was a little less oily than regular donuts, so we baked instead of fried.  This is an excellent recipe, thank you so much for putting it out there for us.

These were so good! I used my bread machine to make the dough. I took the advice of a few others and added 1 tsp. nutmeg and vanilla extract to the dough. I used the microwave to make the glaze. Will make these again for sure!

Man oh man!  This recipe is fabulous.  I made it today and took them to the other moms waiting at the bus stop.  Before I could tell them the name they said "These are just like Krispy Kremes!"  I was very pleased!

I made these because my husband loves Krispy Kreme doughnut, and though I would kill for doughnut overall (can you say carb junkie??), I've never cared for the aftertaste that they leave me.
My husband had no idea what these were called, or anything about the recipe except that I'd made them, took one bite and said 'these taste like Krispy Kreme', so they were obviously a hit with him! What I didn't expect though, was that the taste was actually BETTER, in that they were fresher having just been made, and NO nasty aftertaste! This recipe makes a LOT of donuts. My new fav, thank you!
*The dough is very fragile upon final rise when you try to pick it up and place in oil. I found the doughnut 'holes' much easier in that they require less handling and are easier to place. I'm going to try twists next time...might hold together better than the traditional doughnut shape.

OMG... So GOOD! After reading many of the reviews, I had very high hopes that these would taste just like the ones at my local bakery... they were BETTER! My 10 yr old son said I should become a doughnut maker :)  I followed the recipe exact and they were light and fluffy doughnuts with a tasty sweet glaze on the outside.  We ate some when they were warm and they melted in your mouth.  The only tip I would give is after you make your doughnut shape, place them on wax paper or parchment paper that's been dusted with flour... that way after they're done rising they'll just slide off the paper into the oil and they won't deflate!  I'm definately going to keep this recipe in my file... but I'll have to be careful how often I make them!  The recipe says it makes 18, but I used a 3 1/2 inch circle cutter and I got about 28... A day later, my family has eaten ALL of them:)  Enjoy!

Absolutely the BEST yeast doughnut recipe we've tried and the only one we'll use.  From past experience with heavy doughs we used 1/2 Cake Flour and 1/2 all purpose flour which made for a really puffy light dough.  The best secret of all is the butter in the icing...it just melts into the doughnut(just like a Krispy Kreme).  Thanks Kelly!

Ugh sooo good. I had been doing cake doughnuts for so long that I almost forgot how yummy a "real" doughnut taste!! The only thing I would add is that you make sure you do the yeast correct or you will have to start the whole thing over again...

Stupendous doughnuts! Came out so light and fluffy. Totally put those boxed doughnuts to shame. Made only half the batch and ended up with 16 using a 2.5 inch cutter. I used my Kitchen Aid and a dough hook to do all the mixing and kneading. Had to add 1/2 cup of flour, in 1/4 cup batches to the dough before it cleanly came away from the mixing bowl. Allowed the dough to rise 2 hours the first time, and then for 45 minutes. Used a deep fryer, double checking the 350 degree temp. with a candy thermometer. Frying is very, very quick. Watch the middle of the doughnut for browness, then turn them quickly. Drain on paper towels. We did not do the glaze, we only wanted sugar on top. Took a long time to make, but they are so worth it! Will make these again and again!

Wow! This was the first time I have ever made doughnuts & these are delicious! I just started to work with yeast, so I am starting to branch out. I changed a couple of things per the reviews. I used a little less than 1 cup of sugar in the dough, and added about 1 tablespoon to the yeast/water mixture and set in the oven on warm while I prepared the milk mixture. I heated the milk on medium heat along with the sugar, shortening, and salt. Once the shortening melted, I took it off the burner & added 1-teaspoon vanilla extract per other reviews and a dash of cinnamon. I then combined the yeast & milk mixtures, and instantly added 2 cups of flour to cool off the milk, mixed well then added the 2 eggs, which I had beaten. I then added more flour as needed and continued with the recipe as is. I think the extra sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon enhanced this recipe and made for a wonderful flavor. I also made a maple glaze since it is fall along with the vanilla glaze. Delicious!

Fantastic recipe. First time I've ever made yeast doughnuts and they turned out great. Highly recommended. They take a bit of time to make, and the recipe makes a lot of doughnuts. I even brought a bunch to my neighbors, they also loved them.

This recipe gives professional results!  I first tried it in my breadmaker but could only fit 1/2 batch so the next time I made it in my kitchenaide mixer, both times with fantastic results!  I am so pleased.  I have tried other recipes that just didn't work.  I got some good hints from other comments that really helped.  One was to use a lot of flour on the back of cookie sheets before placing the cut out doughnuts to rise.  Then they don't stick when you use a spatula to move them to the fryer.  Next, only fry a couple at a time to prevent the oil from cooling down and causing the oil to seep into the dough as it cooks.  The other thing was that some people had a problem with their glaze becoming hard before they put the cooked doughnuts in it.  Make sure that the doughnuts are still fairly hot when you put them in and make the glaze just before you will need it.  Then add enough hot water to make it quite thin.  If there is not enough water in it, or if it gets cold it will crystalize faster.  The last thing is to use real vanilla for the glaze.  It tastes fantastic!!  I love this recipe!  Thanks for sharing it Kelly!  This one goes in my all time favorites!

These were delicious! I made the dough in my bread machine and then rolled them out and let them rise. My husband thought there was too much vanilla in the glaze, but I thought they were perfect. I am definitely making these again!

My son said these doughnuts are so good they should get 10 stars.  We were sooo impressed.  The glaze was great.  I just dipped the whole donut in and flipped it over to cover the whole donut.  I fried half of them and baked the other half.  They were great both ways but seemed more like donuts fried.  I agree with another review they would make great dinner rolls.  I just think they would need a little more salt in the dough.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

These doughnuts do not taste like any doughnut I have ever eaten.  I am very disappointed that after all the work, I ended up with these.  I could have gone to the store and bought refrigerator dough for less work and more taste.  The overall taste of the dough was...off.  I can't really put my finger on it, but they were off.  Will continue my search for a doughnut recipe that beats the refrigerator dough.

I cook a LOT and never received more rave reviews for anything than these doughnuts. I made two batches within two days and my Sunday School class thanks you and my father-in-law's birthday party attendees thank you. In the process, I did have to use a good deal more flour to keep the dough from being too sticky to handle at all, first in the inital mixing and kneading and then in the rolling out and cutting. I heavily floured the dough board and top of the dough. I fried the doughnuts at 325 degrees as suggested and they turned out lighly browned and crispy on the outside. At first I found that sliding the doughnuts off the sheet and into the oil was problematic as suggested, but then, by accident, I learned a little trick. If you dip your metal turner into the hot oil and then slide it immediately under the doughnut, you can pick it up and place it in the cooker, no problem. I made twice as much glaze and glazed both sides of the doughnuts. I had people asking if they could take some home to share with others and wanting to know when they could expect the next batch.

Excellent.... but next time I'd make a couple changes: The milk should be scalded  - this would lead to enough evaporation so the flour is just the right amount *Make sure it cools down to luke warm before adding to yeast to prevent killing it!*; 1 1/2c sugar; vanilla (1-2 tsp) - my fiancé said that the bread flavor was lacking; 1 1/2x the glaze (I only coated once). Other than that, good stuff!

This was the second doughnut recipe I've tried and will be the last! These turned out perfect and yes just like the submitter says, just like your favorite doughnut shops. I turned out 24 of these. I had thought about making a double batch but since I'd never made these before I decided not to. Glad I didn't. So I left some out and am freezing the rest. Thanks for sharing Kelly!

I made both a full recipe, and one scaled down by half, and followed the recipe carefully for everything including frying. The recipe worked just as well scaled down as it did when making the full amount.
The results were wonderful, the donuts were lightly crispy tender and golden on the outside and tender and fluffy on the inside. We didn't like the glaze, but I do have other glaze recipes that I like better. Cinnamon sugar, or honey coating was nice on these donuts to. The donuts are slightly sweet without any glaze or sugar coatings and I actually like them best without anything on them at all. I've made the donut dough ahead of time and shaped and frozen the raw donuts so we could have hot fresh morning donuts in less time. Once they're frozen all thats left to do is remove them from the freezer, then thaw and allow them to rise before frying.

Removing soft, raw Donuts from the rising tray can be tricky, so I lined the tray with lightly greased waxed paper and cut it after the donuts finished rising, so that each donut had its own waxed paper square to make it easier to turn the donuts into my hand or into the hot oil, avoiding the danger of donuts sticking to the tray and being deflated or misshapen during removal. I covered the dough with plastic wrap rather than cloth during the final rising.

My biggest problem with this recipe is that the donuts start to vanish from the cooling rack before I can finish frying and glazing them all.

Thanks for sharing this one Kelly

These came out awesome.  This was my first experience making dough at an extreme altitude.  I had to half the yeast and add a little extra milk and they came out perfect.

It was my first time making donuts and I was hoping for good results. It got a little messy in the kitchen...but we were so excited with the results!! The donuts were light..fluffy and tasted amazing after being dipped in the glaze. Eating them while they are still warm/hot made a difference. My sister and boyfriend couldn't believe how amazing they tasted...pretty close to the real thing!! Tip: I turned the oven on low heat and put the bowl of dough in there with the door open to help it rise...worked great!! Also...We had to add extra water to the glaze recipe...it was perfect. Make these donuts...you won't regret it!!!

Five stars for taste! I fried them at medium low heat, because at a higher temperature they burned on the outside and were doughy on the inside. The dough was extremely sticky and could not be removed from the wax paper I put them on to rise. I ended up having to reshape the doughnuts after peeling them off. I recommend using lots of flour! Doughnut holes were easier to make and cooked better. The doughnuts were very flat and crispy on the outside. *UPDATE* I added at least 1 cup of flour and the dough wasn't sticky! I put each donut on a separate peice of greased wax paper on a jelly roll pan and covered them loosely with greased plastic wrap. I slipped them in the fridge overnight, but they didn't rise much so I put them in a warm oven in the morning. Half were excellent, but one tray stuck to the wax paper and deflated when I peeled them off. Still, this time was much more successful! Also, for the icing add an extra cup of powdered sugar and a bit more water. It wasn't sweet enough for my family. NOTE: I omitted the water, used butter instead of shortening, and made the dough using a bread machine. Half the recipe made 10 donuts plus donut holes.

I was amazed how much these taste like Krispy Kreme donuts!  So delicious.  The only bad thing was we ran out of glaze.  Next time I will either 1/2 the dough or double the glaze.  We got about 30 donuts and only had enough glaze to cover about 16.

Great doughnuts!  They are very close to the originals!  Think next time I make them I will use half cake flour to lighten them a little more.  Thank you for the awesome recipe.  I will definitely be making these many more times!

Took quite some time, but cranked out two and a half dozen donuts from the original recipe. I used vegetable oil and it came out tasting a little like corn (which actually wasn't too bad...). I have been told by a baker that I should try canola oil. I'll be making these again.

Loved these, they were excellent. I used SAF instant yeast because I use it for everything. I also needed a bit more flour than the recipe indicated, probably between 1/2 and 3/4 cup. otherwise totally perfect, absolutely delicious. I made a chocolate glaze, maple glaze, simple white glaze, the butter vanilla glaze in the recipe, and also cinnamon sugar and powdered sugar. YUM!

Kelly, thank you so much for this recipe.  My elderly mother wanted fresh home-made donuts, and I had never made them.  These came out perfect.  She said they were the best donuts she had ever eaten.  As suggested by another reviewer, I place the donuts on squares of oiled parchment for their final rise.  Then I turned the parchment upside down over the oil to allow the donuts to gently enter the oil.  The result was remarkably light donuts.  I did notice that any trauma to the donuts (like using a spatula to get them in the oil) causes them to fall and be heavier.  Really fantastic recipe as written.

I just finished making these doughnuts, and "OH MY" this is the recipe that I have been looking for, for years. they are terrrific and easy. I hesitate to pay the high price for my favorite doughnuts, so I just buy on occasion, but after making these I no longer have to wait.....  I do agree with one reviewer who said they could be a little sweeter but I think the glaze does just fine...  They sure don't help the waisteline but they are worth every last calorie.  Just a note to those who buy yeast in bulk[ as I do] 4 1/2 teaspoons is the exact amount of yeast to use, and also I sifted my flour [as I always do], and that added to the light texture. I think i'll go have another doughnut now .....Tah Tah.

While these were pretty good, I just didn't think that the taste was worth the time investment!  Maybe I was hoping for too much.  I tried to not hold it against the recipe, and still gave 4 stars.  If you're really trying to compare them to Krispie Kremes, the donuts themselves are too dense, but the glaze is spot on (as long as you make it thin enough...I added a bit more water.)  My main complaint was that I made a half batch of donuts and a full batch of glaze, and STILL ran out of glaze!  I did dip both sides of the donuts in the glaze, but I don't think they were that great without it, so I'd definitely double dip again!  If you'd like to add sprinkles, do so quickly after glazing or you'll miss your window of opportunity.  Lastly, I found that the best donuts were the ones that were the least cooked -- almost just a pale tan color.

I'm very sorry for the low review, but this doughnut was just ok at best.  I wouldn't want anyone else to waste their time and ingredients.  I followed the recipe exactly and I know I did everything right, and they were just very ordinary.  I will keep searching for a good doughnut recipe.

This recipe was amazing! My daughter and my husband loved them! (So did I and I'm not sure that is such a good thing!) It IS time consuming, but any kind of yeast dough is, and it is SO worth it and an easy dough to work with! I even submitted a pic! A+++

I agree that these aren't Krispy Kreme  but they are a pretty good homemade substitute!  I even managed to substitute whole wheat flour for 1/2 the flour.  They were a little heavier, but if you let them rise long enough, it's not that big of a difference.  I did make 1 1/2 batches of the glaze and just barely had enough.  The recipe says thin, but not watery.  It needs to be pretty close to watery, though or when it "dries" it's so thick and sugary that you can hardly taste the doughnut.  This recipe does NOT make 18 doughnuts.  I wound up with 3 dozen 4" diameter doughnuts (roughly the same size as store bought) and 6 dozen doughnut holes.

These were great!  They actually do taste like those famous doughnuts.  I found them to be easy to make and the glaze was delicious.  I used a little more flour than the recipe called for because my dough was very sticky at first.  I also used a smaller doughtnut cutter and ended up with tons of doughtnuts!

I've made these twice. They were a crowd pleaser each time. Time consuming, but since I don't eat alot of donuts, this is a keeper.

I'll break this review down to where I had trouble. 

1) The Yeast: The recipe calls for 2 envelopes of yeast while the video only calls for 1. Well I used 2 and the donuts rose beautifully! I used 2 envelopes from Fleischmann's. 
  When it came to activating the yeast, I simply boiled some water, let it reduce down to between 105-115  then poured it into the bowl of my Kitchenaid Stand Mixer with a dough hook. I then poured the yeast (both packets) on top of the water. The directions say to let the yeast "rise until foamy" but to be honest, you need to stir the yeast. So, I got some more warm water,  poured it down the sides while mixing the yeast. I let it sit for about 5-10 minutes and it foamed quite well.

2) Cutting the dough: I can't stress this enough and I suggest paying close attention to this part. Before you are ready to cut the donuts, take a baking sheet (or whatever you plan on putting the cut pieces on) and line it with wax paper. Then, heavily spray the wax paper with non-stick spray! HEAVILY! I didn't heavily spray and the donuts stuck just a bit. Spray the sucker down like there's no tomorrow!

3) Rising: Allow them to rise UNTIL THEY ARE THE SIZE YOU WANT THEM TO BE! I let my first batch rise for about an hour and began frying. The frying took about 30 minutes, then I took out my second batch. To my surprise, my second batch was 4 times larger than the first!

4) Frying: I constantly turned the dough when frying so they won't get overcooked on 1 side.

I liked it a lot. Much better than the donuts that I find here in Brazil. I made them today and I guarantee you that the dough is great. In the other hand, I found the glaze taste too strong. I would cut a little bit of the vanilla.

Excellent recipe.  Followed it exactly.  I hate reviews where people change this and add that and then review it.  It's not the same recipe after they alter it.  They shouldn't even bother to review it.  This was fine, just the way it was written.

OH MY GOSH!!! AMAZING. Who would have thought I could have made amazing doughnuts?! I was smart though, as this was my first time doing doughnuts, and I made doughnut holes so I could control the amount of cooking better. Be warned though... this batter had me cussing up a storm because the batter was so sticky... I probably ended up using 6 cups of flour total just to keep the batter from sticking to the ever-loving counter! I also doubled the glaze recipe, as this batter recipe made A LOT of dough. This tasted incredible! FIVE STARS PLUS!

Never made donuts before. Thought it would be to hard and complicated. This recipe is a little time and energy consuming but completely worth it! This is my very first review and I'm doing it because these are so good I wanted to leave a five star from me. Thank You Kelly! Awesome recipe

This is the best donut recipe I have found ! My family really loved them.  Recipe is easy enough to follow....all I changed was the frying temperature from 350 to 325 to avoid burning the donuts.  We'll definitely make these many times over !!!  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe with all of us :-)

These doughnuts turned out great! I played around with different glazes and things to put on it. I ended up making regular glazed, coconut coated, maple glazed, plain and powdered. I took this recipe and veganized it. I replaced the milk and used soymilk and replaced the eggs with a 1/2 cup of plain soy yogurt. I didn't have any shortening left, but Earth Balance margarine worked just fine.

My only complaint is...it makes WAY more than 18 doughnuts! Serious, I have doughnuts coming out of my ears. Next time I'm going to half or even 1/3 the recipe I think. I may go around handing out doughnuts to all the neighbors if it comes down to it. I don't think we can eat them all, as good as they are! So beware the quantity. But enjoy all the yummy goodness and fun things you can do with the recipe!

Takes about two hours for the dough to rise, but both the doughnuts and the glaze are well worth the wait. Couldn't be better. Try orange zest in the dough or almond flavoring instead of vanilla, for a different twist.

Wow! This is my first time making homemade doughnuts, and I didn't even have a doughnut cutter, so we just had round, mug-sized doughnuts, but they were so heavenly.

The glaze only made enough for half the doughnuts, though, so we had to use cinnamon sugar for the rest. Maybe that's because my husband dipped both sides in the glaze. Maybe you're just supposed to dip the top. I really think you should just double the glaze recipe, cause it's really yummy bathed in the glaze!

My daughter wanted doughnuts for her birthday sleepover.  This recipes got rave reviews, so I had high expectations.  I was NOT disappointed!!  the doughnuts were light and fluffy and the girls devoured them. (Those that made it passed my husband anyway!)  I made the recipe as written and made all doughnut holes since I don't have a doughnut cutter.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was the first time I have ever made doughnuts and they turned out great. I halved the recipe, used butter instead of shortening and used rapid rise yeast so we wouldnt have to wait forever to eat these for breakfast. It worked wonderfully and we did some with just glaze, some with chocolate, and some with chocolate and sprinkles. The kids loved them.

These were wonderful!!  My husand and I made them for our church one Sunday morning.  It took a total of 4 hours to get a double batch done.  Word to the Wise if you do a double batch do each batch of dough seperately.  It's hard to get that much dough mixed up at one time.  While the first is raising you can do the second.  We used a glass and an apple corer (center) to cut them.  made them perfect size.  We have been asked to bring them again next week.  I think we'll make them on Sat instead of Sunday morning this time! :)  We did add a Tsp of Maple to the glaze instead of vanilla.  Wonderful.  I think we will try adding a couple T of cocoa next week for some Chocolate ones!  Thank you so much!

This was not worth the time and effert. It took 4hrs to rise the 1st time and a good 3hrs the 2nd. As far as the flavor it was just not there. I will take the time to make something if its good but these just had no flavor at all!

I cooked the first two doughnuts and we all said "so so".(kind of heavy and not at all like "you know where")  I thought...must be something I can do with these besides wasting all that time and dough.  So,  I sliced them in half, dipped them in a cinnamon egg wash, and they made AMAZING french toast !!  Dusted them with powdered sugar and sliced strawberries, and everyone enjoyed it !

Wonderful.  I used buttermilk in place of milk and it made a super flavor.  We also used homemade chocolate icing instead of the glaze.  You could use canned icing, too.

This is a great recipe! I didn't change anything and it turned out tasting like krispy kreme's. I have created probably a thousand doughnuts with this recipe and I still keep doing it. My daughter loves this so much I make them every week. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

These doughnuts were fantastic! (almost too good, HAD to send home with family members before we ate them all!)  I used my bread machine, and that made it so easy.  I mixed the yeast and water,  and warmed the milk to lukewarm with the shortening before adding to the bread machine.  I then added the eggs (room temperature), sugar, salt and flour.  I hit the dough setting, worked the flour in with a spatula  and then let the machine finish  doing the work! My daughter-in-law said I must open a bakery!!

This is a great recipe.  I messed up and forgot the egg and incorporated it after the dough was made and it still turned out great.  I will be making them again and not forgetting the egg.  They were very light and fluffy  I was shocked at how good they turned out on the very first time.  I am deleting the rest of the other doughnut recipes.  This is the only one I will use from now on.  They are not cakelike at all.  They are almost like krispy kreme.

These are incredible! I had never made doughnuts before, but I found this recipe to be really easy and relatively quick. The batch was pretty big so I was able to freeze the leftovers and reheat them at 350 degrees when I wanted them.

I LOVE this recipe. If you want an extra special doughnut, try this: Roll dough out & spray very lightly with water, then sprinkle very heavily with cinnamon. Fold dough in half, & cut into long stips. Then braid the strip (the dough doesn't stick together with all that cinnamon on it) Then take one end of the braided strip & just roll the rest of that strip around itself, tuck outside end inside of the rest so that it will not unroll. Raise to double & fry & glaze. Absolutely delicious!! Another good variation: When you cut your doughnuts, do not remove the doughnut hole. Raise, fry. then after doughnut is fried, push the hole down with your finger. Make the Satiny chocolate glaze from this site. Frost with that. Then make the filling from Cream filled Cupcakes from this site. Put a spoonful of filling in the center, top with a maraschino cherry.

I made this in lieu of a cake for my sons 10th B-day he LOVES donuts. This was a lot of work and a big mess.  But it turned out wonderful.  I did miss the first step (printing issues) but even without that they were great.  I made a maple glaze for half the donuts by dividing half the glaze and adding 1 tsp maple flavoring.  They were the perfect sweetness and texture.  My son said they were wonderful.

So Good.  Used my bread machine to make the dough (will over rise by volume if you do not watch) Melt in your mouth excellent recipe thank you for sharing.  I also added a little coco to the glaze for a chocolate frosting.

I made these on the weekend and my husband told me that I better hide them. Used my bread maker to make the dough, I put everything in as per my maker and turned out perfect. Definitely a keeper!

Wow, these are SOOOOOO good! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out wonderfully. Next time I'm going to lightly dust the donuts with flour and set them on parchment before I let them rise the second time to help minimize sticking.

YUM!!  I have made many different doughnut recipes but this is the best!  My family loved them!  I tossed some of the holes in a sugar/cinnamon mixture while they were still warm too.

The only bad thing that happened when making these was that I felt the dough was too sticky at first.  This of course was fixed by adding more flour, but I also halfed the recipe so maybe that messed something up.  Either way, they tasted great and I especially liked the glaze.  I think I'll try variations with frosting and maybe sugar doughnuts and what not

I hate giving recipes one star but truthfully I just can't see giving this recipe more than that.  The taste of these did not seem right.  Any store bought doughnut would taste a hundred times better than these.  It just didn't have that doughnut flavor  I was looking for.  I am very disappointed after all the work I put into these today.  I guess my search will have to continue for a better doughnut recipe...  sorry!  =(

Fantastic!!!  Just like I remember KK when I lived on the east coast.  The only tip I have is to let the oil drain all the way before frosting them.  If you want them cooked all the way through and don't have a thermometer for the oil err on the side of lower heat and cook them longer.  The first couple I made were fully done on the outside and dough in the middle.  
So good I won't even try another yeast doughnut recipe!

I'd never made doughnuts before, so I couldn't believe how easy it was. I made these in a deep fryer and it took about 30 seconds to cook them two at a time.  Our favorite was just plain glazed, but we also made chocolate iced and powdered sugar ones. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they weren't all that great unless you ate them right away.

These are great!  Honestly - first timers to this recipe - don't change a thing.  If you find you want to play with it later; do so; but these are wonderful as written.  I cannot count the number of times I've made these; and I ALWAYS have people wanting more; wanting the recipe; raving over them for days afterwards.  
  There is one thing that I (almost) always do; though; that is just a tiny bit different to the instructions - that's just cut them small so what I have in the end is a bunch of doughnut holes - I use a plastic shot glass to cut them out and they're the perfect size for party finger food; and people keep coming back for more and more.  Great for kids and adults.  Can also coat them in chocolate ze (just add some cocoa powder to the glaze - as per personal prefernce); or for the kids you can thin the glaze a tiny bit more and roll in sprinkles immediatly after glazing.  Have also done larger circles (as per normal doughnuts) and just left them whole (not cut out the hole in the center) and used a piping bag to put jam in the center. Very versalile recipe and did I mention; great??  Have done these and will do thise again and again (by popular demand of our whole little town; not to mention my family...)

These were very light and fluffy and the glaze was the perfect compliment.  Next time I will double the glaze and dip the donuts into it instead of drizzling.

First time making donuts, and despite my worries, they turned out great!  I halved the recipe because we didn't need that many donuts for our family.  For the rising periods I used a preheated oven to 200 degrees, and then turned off the heat before putting dough in to rise.  Took abt 1 hour the first time and 40 min. the second.  I also put the donuts on wax paper sprayed with cooking spray once they were cut out, so they'd be easy to get into the fryer.  My only problem with this recipe was the glaze.  I didn't like this consistency very much- next time I'll use this donut recipe but a different glaze recipe.

These are great.  Someone mentioned not scalding the milk.  It is a good idea to scald milk in yeast recipes because the protease in the milk will have a negative effect on the yeast.  What I do is scald the milk and pour over the shortening that I have placed in the mixing bowl and let cool to lukewarm.  You then proof the yeast in the 110 degree water with a teaspoon of the sugar and mix up the dough.

This is the best doughnut recipe I have ever made! My husband and teenage sons couldn't stop eating them.  They are very light and soft, almost melt in your mouth.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone who appreciates a good yeast doughnut!

I just finished making these doughnuts..they are VERY good.Mine took approx. 45 mins for the dough to rise the first time and about 45 mins for the second time.I glazed half of the batch with chocolate frosting which turned out wonderful - 4oz semisweet chocolate chips,1/3 cup butter,2 cups of confectioners sugar,1 1/2 tsp vanilla and 2 tbsp hot water.I melted the butter and chocolate chips,added the confectioners sugar and vanilla and then added the hot water as needed to loosen it up.Some of the doughnuts didnt rise as much as i would have liked but they are VERY soft and have a great flavor.Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Holy moly!  These are amazing!  I made these this morning with my 3 kids.  It was a little of an effort but it was so worth it!  I substituted the milk for buttermilk only because I had some on hand and I like the taste that buttermilk adds.  I also put the donut holes straight into a bag with cinnamon and sugar after frying.  I let the kids shake it up a bit   and voila! I will certainly be making these for our next bake sale.  They will probably be able to purchase a new gymnasium with the proceeds!

WOW!! These were a huge hit with my SUPER picky family!! eveyone loved them!! I had made other recipes of doughnuts before, and they were pretty good, but these were THE best!! Make sure you only make enough to be able to eat them the same day, because they go stale the next day and they are nowhere near as good after that. I made just one batch, but I guess I rolled the dough thinner, so I ended up with over 40 doughnuts!!! The thicker ones tasted better, but they were all really good, especially the doughnut holes for some reason!! I needed double the glaze, and when I ran out, sprinkled some icing sugar on a few of them. Amazing doughnuts, very similar, if not better than Krispy Kreme doughnuts!! Thank you so much for such a HIT of a recipe!!

I've always wanted to try making homemade donuts, these were very easy.  I made a half batch for my family of 5 and we all had 2 donuts, plus holes.  Perfect amount for us.   I made my dough the night before, let it rise, cut it, and stored it in tupperware on waxed paper and left in fridge.  In the morning, I let the donuts get to room temp while the oil was heating up. The recipe does not say how long the donuts take to cook, but it's only about 30 seconds to 1 minute, very quick!  I cooked mine one at a time in a smaller pan so I didn't have to waste as much oil.  Glaze is delicious!

These were perfect for "Fastnacht Day", every year I make batches of doughnuts to celebrate "Doughnut Day", as my family calls it. This is the first time I tried this recipe, and although they don't taste like KKs, nobody's complaining here. We love eating our doughnuts fresh out of the fryer so I try to space out the frying. I freeze trays of the doughnuts before they rise, once they're frozen, I store then in zip locs. I take them out of the freezer about 45 minutes before  I'm ready to fry them. This works great and everybody gets to experience the "HOT" doughnuts!

Excellent, light and fluffy. I used a bread machine AND whole wheat flour and they turned out great! Our three generation, handed-down recipe has now been laid to rest in favor of this one.   The whole wheat flour was Bob's Mill Pastry Whole Wheat for rising breads, pastries. So it's not as heavy as other whole wheat.    NO SPECIAL RECIPE for bread machine, just follow order recommended by manufacturer, that is, usu. wet ingredients first. I did not proof the yeast, I knew it was fresh.   Glaze is perfect or maple frosting, use pure maple syrup and confectioners sugar. If you want it thin, heat it a little on stovetop.   Enjoy!

These came out BETTER than KK. I followed the recipe. I didn't change anything. I can't believe how people change recipes, and then give bad reviews. I don't understand how anyone can give these a bad review! I fried them, and my Hubby helped glaze them. I made doughnut holes too, and shook in a brown paper bag with cinnamon sugar. SO good! These take a little work, but are well worth it! No added ingredients you don't know about. HOMEMADE! You can't get any better than that IMO. Thanks Kelly. I will be making these for years to come.

great recipe.  make sure that after you cut the doughnuts out that you let them rise an inch or two apart from each other on pieces of wax paper.  sprinkle a good amount of flour on the wax paper to keep them from sticking.

Used my bread machine for these. I thought the dough was extremely easy to work with. Only problem was some of mine came out dark and cooked too quickly-- obviously not the recipe's fault I am still mastering how to fry these. I was using a pot and candy thermometer since I don't have a deep fryer. I will definitely save this recipe for when overnight guests are visiting.

I did not mix anything up on the recipe and it turned out great. Big kudos from my sleep over New Year's guests. I will be doing this again with some different shapes, toppings, and fillings. It took a lot of oil so I did the pastry and then deep fried fish and chicken in the oil.

These were amazing!! I tried making them with my bread machine and let the dough rise in there. I then shaped the dough and let them rise for about 30 min before frying them. I was a little nervous but they were equally good with the bread machine. I also like to deep them in a 1:1 mixture of honey and butter with some vanilla added to it or shake them with a sugar cinnamon mixture so that there is something for every taste.Great recipe, Thank you!

The absolute best homemade donuts I have ever had.  I used my bread machine's dough cycle to mix everything which took care of first rise, then rolled and cut out donuts.  For frying I substituted canola oil for vegetable oil and liked the result. Thank you for sharing this great recipe

I combined what other users have said and came up with great results the first time.  First I scalded the milk. Then I reduced yeast to 4 tsp and proofed it with a tsp sugar.  I used 3/4 cup sugar, 2 tsp salt and used bread flour with maybe 1/2-3/4 cup more so it wasn't quite as sticky.  The dough tasted very good and flavorful! For the first rise I put the bowl in a warm oven.  I used a glass to cut them out and then used my apple corer to cut the middles.  The only thing I wished I'd done is put the cut out donut dough on trays in a warm oven.  Instead I put them on the cupboard and they just didn't rise so we ended up cooking them the next morning and they still weren't quite high enough but it didn't pose a problem.  350 degrees was a touch too hot, they browned in seconds, so the more the oil cooled the better they turned out (no "burning").  I made some glazed, sugared and then bismarks.  The whole family loves them and they were great!

Great, great, great! Nice recipe, I also kept the oil slightly cooler so they would not colour as quick, and found myself also needing to put extra flour into the dough recipe. I dipped 1/3 of the cooked doughnuts in the Glaze.1/3 I placed in a plastic bag filled with Caster sugar and Cinnamon and coated them, and 1/3 I dusted with Icing sugar and piped (filled them) with sweetened cream. Amazing! Try this recipe out!

These are fantastic. 

I made them twice, once with all purpose flour and once with bread flour and the bread flour batch seemed to have a texture closer to the real thing. I also added vanilla to the donut dough, which I think helped enhance the flavor a bit.

Okay, they definately DO NOT taste as good as the chain doughnut shop they are being compared to.  They remind me more of the taste of those doughnuts you get in Chinese places.  The glaze was very good though.  But for all the effort, unless you like bragging rights of saying you made it, save yourself time and energy and just buy the ones from the shop.  They taste better and are not very expensive.

Unfortunately I had to give this recipe a low rating.  I felt the dough was quite heavy.  The amount of flour was incorrect. (I had to add 1 more cup to get it out of the mixing bowl.)  These werem't near sweet as typical doughnuts are.  The glaze is fantastic.  We added cocoa powder and made chocolate glaze.  That was quite yummy.  Also, the doughnuts seem to have gone stale quite quickly even in air tight containers.  I'll keep on searching for a tastier recipe!

I have been baking and cooking for over 20 years, and they are terrible.  They have no flavor, and they tasted too mcuh like yeast.  I was very disappointed in the results.  Hint:  take a package of biscuits, fry them and they are alot cheaper, quicker, and taste way better than this recipe.

Thank you for this recipe.  I needed to send some safe donuts to school with my son, for him that means dairy-free.  It was "Donuts with Dad Day" and my health food store was out of the vegan donuts I usually buy him.  I found this recipe, cut it in half and altered it with soy milk and half whole wheat flour.  They were AWESOME!! I even made a few with real maple syrup in the glaze.  I will definately make these again.  Since you only need an inch of oil it wasn't any harder than making fresh bread.

My husband and I made this recipe togeather. It was a little work, but it was o so worth it. These doughnuts are just as good or even better than store bought. I did not have a douhnut cutter so I used a glass and a cap off the salad dressing bottle for the hole. It worked fine.

YUM YUM! My husband and I made this together and it was fun! I used my  bread maker. Put it on pizza dough setting b/c it only takes and hour. I didnt leave the dough in there for the entire hour, just 40minutes. THen added some flour just enough so the dough wasnt sticky. The doughnuts turned out PERFECT! I am going to have to work out some kinks in the icing though. I was pleased that I got the dough made, cut, and cooked in one hour. I rolled the dough out to 1/2 inch thick. THen used a tupperware quick shake container to cut the outside of the doughnut and a small medicine cup that came with cough syrup to cut the inside of the doughnut, worked out perfect! My husband is sooo happy!

Also, we ran out of the glaze pretty quickly! So we used powered sugar on some then mixed powered sugar and cinnamon and dipped them in that. They were pretty good!

Just made these donuts, came out really well.  I don't have a donut cutter, so I used a pizza cutter to cut the dough into squares.  The first few I made were too big, and the centers weren't cooked all the way, so I cut them a bit smaller, around 1" squares.  Doing this meant I needed much more glaze, so I made a second batch, and this time I made it with half as much vanilla.  Much better taste, in my opinion.

I am from South Africa so I don't know what Krispy Kreams are but doughnuts are quite popular down here. Everyone who ate them said they were better than the ones bought at our local shops.  I made them twice in one weekend. The first time I followed the recipe exactly adding just a lit more flour.  the second time I add melted chocolate and a little milk to the original glaze recipe and they tasted just great. I have just one problem with the glaze becoming very soft after a while. The glaze sets well but after a few hours of standing it becomes soft and moist. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. The only reason I won't be making these anytime soon is because I wouldn't want them to settle on my hips. GREATE RECIPE!!!!!

These doughnuts were great... not exactly like KK, I wouldn't say, but not necessarily not just as good!  I only made half a batch, and since I didnt have a doughnut cutter I just made holes... about 40 I would say.  I made the full amount of glaze (pretty watered down, which was perfect) and it was barely enough for all my doughnut holes.  A few people recommened more sugar--I dont think this would be necessary unless you are not putting the glaze on--without the glaze the doughnuts are a bit yeast-y, but the glaze more than hides that subtle flavor.  DELICIOUS!

Wow!! These were the best homemade doughnuts I've ever made. The came out perfect, better than the deli or doughnut shop. I made mine in the bread machine first, let rise till doubled then rolled out and cut and let them rise again. I cooked them in the deep fryer till golden brown. The icing is delicious but had to double the recipe to have plenty. I know I wil make these again.

These were melt in your mouth, better than Krispy Kreme, easy to do donuts.  I used 2 c. Kamut flour and 3 c. white flour to give them more flavor and fiber.  And I added a dash of nutmeg.  I couldn't get the powdered sugar smooth in the butter and vanilla for the glaze.  So the net time I made it I added a couple T. water before mixing in the sugar.  I have a small family so I found glazed leftovers weren't very good the next day.  If left unglazed they last up to two days and if you realized you have too much the dough keeps in the refrigerater coverd in plastic wrap for a week.  Then the donuts taste fresh a week later.

This is the ABSOLUTE BEST!!!
I mixed 12 recipe in my food processor with the steel blade--my cuisinart can only handle about 3 cups of flour.
This eliminates hand kneading and allows for not adding any more flour (which will drastically change the dough texture).  After the dough has risen, it is not as sticky and is easy to roll out to cut in shapes with just a little sprinkle of flour.  Also, it is not necessary to wash out the processor bowl to mix the second half of the recipe. Put the dough to rise in a separate greased bowl.

Ehh, these were good, a little too much work in my opinion, and once they cool down they are all that, not to mention they are so sweet you can only eat about 2! This recipe made alot and I know I cant eat them all so I will be giving some away. Just a tip: I need 1 cup extra flour just so the dough was managable, Made sure they oil stays at exactly 325 or they will burn on the outside and not cook inside! I dipped some in melted chocolate betty crocker icing and sprinkles for the kids, cinnamon sugar for some, and the rest in powdered sugar to make them taste like zeppoli's, Which they did!

This is really the best doughnut recipe I have tried!  I am living overseas and the American doughnut shops we have are VERY EXPENSIVE and not very good.  My family agreed they are the best I have tried and I need not look for any other recipe, this is a keeper.  From the name of your doughnut I think I know which is your favorite shop and it is mine too!  These are even better!

Are so good! I use bread flour instead of all-purpose and  oil instead of the shortening. I used a cup to cut them out and filled them with Carmel or jelly and sprinkled with powdered sugar when they were done

Nice and fluffy. I didn't know the temperature setting so I burned the first 2 and the rest weren't golden brown. Thay still tasted great though. Next time I will have to find a doughnut cutter. This time around, I used cookie cutters.

Had never donuts before and this recipe worked like a charm. Followed a reviewer's method in the bread maker. Pour everything in according to BM recommendations, set in dough cycle and remove when it has doubled (You need a 3lb bread machine). Roll and cut and let rise 25-30 minutes (about 1/3 of the size, not more). Fry and drain on paper towels. Dip in 2-3 cups of pure simmering maple syrup. Lay on a wire rack set on a cookie sheet to avoid the mess. DELICIOUS! Freeze well.

I am not sure why anyone would give these one star.  When I made these with the kids my wife thought I bought the doughnuts. 

The best part is these doughnuts freeze well so you don't have to eat them all at once:-)  

I don't have a doughnut cutter so I used a pint glass and to make the holes I used a plastic pop bottle. Just squeeze the bottle and the holes come out.

My first time at making doughnuts.  This recipe is great.  I halved the recipe because I did not have 5 cups of flour in my house.  (Bad I know)  I did not have any cutters small enough to make the doughnuts, so I used a small coffee cup and for the holes I used the cap from a mello yello bottle.  Worked great.  Next time, I think I will add a little bit more sugar to the dough and/or some flavoring (extract) just to see how it tastes.  Oh and I did not use the glaze for the recipe, I used powdered sugar, water, vanilla extract and some cinnamon.  Oh so good.  I also rolled some in powdered sugar and cinnamon.  Even my very picky husband ate these.  Thanks for sharing!!

Absolutely perfect! tasted just like you know who's doughnuts! Oh, we did realize we didn't have eggs and had to use 4 teaspoons baking powder, four teaspoons water and 2 tablespoons of oil in place of the two eggs, but still absolutely incredible to my pregnant belly! Thank you! 
Oh PS don't worry when the glaze looks kinda thick. at 4 Tb of water it was perfect for the first doughnuts we did it with, but sadly I panicked and kept adding more water till I ruined the rest of the doughnuts with runny glaze. I mean it tasted good still, but more like store bought doughnuts instead of the heavenly doughnuts the first couple were. :o(

I never seem to be disappointed with ANY recipe I've used from this site. Once again a definite Keeper. My family LOVED these. I followed recipe EXACTLY. I made half glazed and the other half chocolate glazed. The recipe for chocolate glaze is: 1cup powdered sugar 5 tbsp. milk  and 1/4cup cocoa whisk until smooth (no heating necessary). These are better than most donut shops and not greasy or heavy tasting. Thanks again for sharing the recipe!!!

AMAZING! We could not believe how great these tasted...and yes, just like Krispy Kreme glazed doughnuts. I also fried the doughnut holes, filled with raspberry jam and rolled them in powdered sugar. Both were delicious. The glaze was spot on! These were very much worth the effort involved.

These doughnuts are fabulous!! Light and creamy and so delicious. The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because it's impossible to work with this dough. Until I tasted them I kept saying I'd never make them again. The dough was really soupy and we needed to add an outrageous amount of flour. Now I know that I'll definitely make these again, but next time I'll cut the milk to 1 cup so the liquid/flour ratio is more balanced. I used butter instead of shortening. 
Update: I've made this many more times. As long as you cut the liquid and add flour as needed (sometimes you need another cup or two) these doughnuts are incredible!

These were OUTSTANDING!  I've tried 4-5 different doughnut recipes and these came out the best!  TIP: make sure to let the first rising go to double in size and then, once cute into shapes, let them rise again to doubled.  I made these with my Home Ec class and they were fabulous.  We cut them into rounds instead of doughnuts with holes, then glazed/dunked into powdered sugar, and filled with strawberry jelly.  The girls in the class have decided to open a doughnut shop after making these!

WOW!  These really are almost identical to Krispy Kreme's glazed donuts!  The recipe makes more than 18 donuts, but by the time I had cut out 12, re-rolled the dough, and cut out six more, the dough was getting tough, so I just tossed the rest of it (about 1/3 of the dough was discarded).  We wouldn't have been able to eat any more of them before they got stale (donuts really MUST be eaten fresh), so next time I'll cut the recipe in half.  I did have to periodcally add a bit of water to the glaze to keep it smooth enough for dipping, but that was easy enough.  I didn't tell my family what I was making until they smelled the donuts frying and came to investigate.  I gave each of my two daughters a fresh, hot donut and they both said "These are just like Krispy Kremes!!!"  Then my younger daughter said "No, they're BETTER than Krispy Kremes!"  :)

I made two half batches of this (yes, I know that equals one whole batch...) :)  One I followed the recipe exactly (with one exception - I used butter rather than shortening.  I don't even keep shortening in the house).  They were good, and I would make them again for a doughnut craving.  However, KK they were NOT.  I don't know if my oil was too hot or if it was the butter or what, but these cooked VERY quickly and while tasty, were not quite as light and fluffy as I'd hoped (I'm not a huge doughnut fan so I've not tasted the ol' KK a bunch of times, but these were definitely heavier).  The second batch I made with white whole wheat flour and baked at 350 for somewhere around the ballpark of 10-12 minutes.  They were good, definitely less "doughnut-y," but still a good breakfast fix.  I made a chocolate glaze, the vanilla glaze from the recipe, and sprinkled some with plain powdered sugar.  By far and about the vanilla glaze was the best, and I think had I dunked the whole doughnut into the glaze rather than just drizzled on the tops, I might have come closer to matching the "real" thing.  Either way, a nice treat.  The kids had no complaints!  My only "complaint" is the 2 hours I'm going to need to spend working out tonight to work them off... ;)

Amazing!!!  These took some work, but were well worth it.  My family and I couldn't stop eating them.  It took the dough about and hour to double in size the first time, and about 30 mins. to proof after I cut them out.

As far as homemade donuts go, these are fantastic!  I halved recipe and came out with exactly 9 huge donuts (about the size of KK brand).  I agree with others that the donut *holes* were much tastier, lighter, and fluffier (knock your socks off good), but bigger ones were just fine as wel.  First rising only took me 45", rolled out and put on greased parchment paper, 2nd rising 45" as well.  Dough is soft, but nothing a well floured board didn't take care of - I certainly didn't need to add much more than a scant 1/16th of a cup, so I don't know what others are talking about (note: i used exactly 12 1/2oz of weighed flour to begin with).  Thanks so much for recipe!

Alot of work. The taste is "off" though. Not sure if it needs more sugar or maybe salt. The donuts were very light and not greasy at all but really had no tatse. It would be alot of time and work to try to customize recipe. Don't think I will make again.

This is a really amazing recipe. I thought the dough was really easy to work with and overall it was a pretty easy process, from start to finish took about 2 hours. In the future I would leave the vanilla out of the glaze it was a little strong. Make sure to pour the glaze over while the doughnuts are still hot. I recommend these awesome doughnuts!!!

I just finished making these donuts and they're fabulous!! I wont say they TASTE EXACTLY like KK's donuts (Hence the minus one star) but they still taste great and the texture for mine were certainly right on. Deliciously Crispy and Creamy. Really the only thing that I changed in this recipe was added a quarter teaspoon of almond extract to the glaze. But I just like almond extract. I would like to add though that I made HALF of the recipe, and froze the dough of half of THAT for later and even when only using about a quarter of the dough for the complete recipe, the glaze wasn't enough, so I would definitely double it if I were you. The recipe said to add flour a half a cup at a time until the dough stopped sticking to the bowl and I did exactly that (except a quarter cup at a time), ended up adding another 3rd of a cup or so total including the extra flour I had to use to knead. TRY THIS RECIPE. ITS CERTAINLY WORTH THE TIME!!

Dropped the serving size down to 4 and was able to get 6 donuts/6 holes which was plenty for 3 people. Followed the recipe as is and they put Krispy Kreme to shame! Easy and wonderful! A perfect study break since they took so long to rise I could just keep working. Will make again for sure! Can't wait to try some variations but so great as is with the glaze and all.

Very pleased with the results. Worried the yeast was not working since dough did not appear to double much after 2 hours in warm room. They fried nicely and inside airy like a donut cake. I was able to re-knead scraps and came out just as well. First time I have ever had success making donuts. The glaze is awesome. Really sticks to donut. Husband raved.

I'm surprised that people are getting such good results with the liquid/flour ratio in this recipe. My dough was soup so I needed to add 50% more flour to get a ball of dough. This dough's ingredients are nearly identical to my cinnamon bun recipe but at a 1 cup milk to 4 cups of flour ratio. I'm taking a star off for that because that's a big difference to me. 
I used a 3 inch doughnut cutter and halved the recipe. I still got 16 store sized donuts and holes. But I did add the extra flour(4 cups total).
I've also never had the original store donuts so I can't give a comparison. 
These were delicious warm though. The texture is very light although the exterior of the donuts gets a little tough. My picky kids gobbled them up!
I plan to freeze a few to see how they hold up when rewarmed from frozen.
~Edit~I've made "this recipe" many times since the first time, but using my own dough recipe and just the icing recipe from here. But I decided to give this dough another chance to see if I went wrong before. Tried the recipe again, as written-full batch and had to add an additional 2 cups of flour again this time(made 30 big doughnuts, BTW). I'd like to really understand this alternate universe everyone seems to be in that has this recipe working as written??? Anyway, I make the dough the night before, put it in a greased bowl, covered, overnight in the fridge. In the morning it's a simple 40 minutes to fresh doughnuts.

Delicious! I did not cut the hole in the middle and after frying, it was hollow inside... Perfect for cream or chocolate filling.

Not crispy OR creamy and definitely not krispy kreme.  The doughnut was more cakey and really heavy compared to krispy kreme. It tasted good as a regular old doughnut but not what I thought it would be.

This was an incredible recipe.  I followed it completely from start to finish.  Some people have mentioned that it is time consuming, but I disagree.  It takes time for things to rise, but it is not time consuming to make.  10 minutes, then let rise.  Another 10 minutes then let rise.  Then you are ready to fry them up!  If you have a good fryer and can be systematic about it then this part goes by quickly and is well worth the effort.  20 minutes to get to the frying isn't bad at all!  This recipe is saved and my kids are big fans!

Just like KK doughnuts as promised! My family loved this recipe. The shaped doughnuts were VERY soft and difficult to transfer into the hot oil, but well worth the trouble. Finished doughnut had a very delicate texture. I will make this recipe again.

I made these exactly as written then added vanilla pudding into the center of some (using a cake decorator) and 3 berry jam to the rest.  These were absolutely fantastic, my family will insist I make them again!

These were awesome when they were hot.  The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because I didn't really like them when they were cooled.  When they were hot, they were very much like the real KK's.

BAD BAD BAD!!!!  Soooooo bad!!!  I am not a huge doughnut fan, but I cannot stop eating these!!!!  My two year old requested to make these this morning, so she and Daddy made them and I am so glad we had company tonight to help us eat them all because I would have eaten the entire batch myself!!  They were perfectly chewey/soft/moist and the icing was the perfect "over the top" fix.  The only thing we did different was use butter instead of shortening because we didn't have any shortening.  We didn't have a doughnut cutter either, so we just used a glass and made a hole with our fingers...this made 25 doughnuts.  They weren't necessarily pretty, but they were absolutely to die for!!!

Wow! These are so good for home made but I had real trouble making them. It is my first time making doughnuts and I will have to say honestly, I will not be making them often. I was doing great up until the second dough rise, after cutting them. The instructions say to slide them off into the grease. Mine did not slide. They stuck to a greased cookie sheet I put them on to rise. So perhaps I didn't flour them enough to keep them from sticking. I did not space them far enough apart. They stuck together. Imagine trying to pull sticky dough apart and off the cookie sheets. The dough deflated and I ended up frying flat misshapen dough. The end result? A kind of fried dough type thing you might find at carnivals. The dough did, however, become bigger in the grease but I could not call them doughnuts. I fried them at both 350 and 325 and would say that 350 is too high a temp. because they got dark brown before I was able to brush the glaze on the ones on the cooling rack and the ones fried at the lower temp came out lighter on the outside and softer on the inside. I can't figure out what I did wrong with the glaze. Setting it aside until time to brush them on hot doughnuts, the sugar crystallized and became difficult to brush on. It's been one heck of a learning experience, but over all I'm glad to have had it.

These doughnuts taste like fried bread and are very bland.  The dough is missing sweetness and flavor.   They are truly lacking.  I stopped frying them shortly after I started.  They just aren't worth gaining weight over.   I am going to look for another recipe.

So..I have been cruising allrecipes.com for many years now, but had to sign up today just so I could leave you- who created this recipe - and explain to you that you have made the world a better place. I am a sous chef in Alaska and was looking for a good donut recipe, and this is it. I followed the directions exactly and thought the dough was amazingly smooth and easy to make. I used vanilla bean paste instead of vanilla extract, only because that is all I had. I will be serving these to the guests at the lodge. Thank you again for being so incredibly badass.

My family loved these.  My 5 year old daughter helped cut them out and we used a water bottle lid for the center.  It was the perfect size!  I also recruited my husband to do the glazing because they fry up so fast.  I was afraid they wouldn't be done in the middle, but it was perfect.  It made me 20 doughnuts, and they didn't last 2 days in my house! Oh, and they are not as good the second day, so share with your family and friends!

These taste fabulous but are a LOT of work!  I halved the recipe and made the dough in my bread machine.  Once done I rolled out my dough and cut it into doughnuts.  I let it do a slow rise in the fridge overnight.  The next morning I turned my oven on to 200 degrees.  Turned the oven off and let it sit for a couple minutes then put my doughnuts in to finish rising.  I made my glaze making sure to make it thin enough to coat them but not be too thick so it would weigh the doughnut down.  I heat my oil to 325 degrees and maintained the heat between 325 and 350 as I fried them.  I fried them to a golden brown removed them to drain on paper towels for a moment.  Then I immediately dipped them into the glaze on both sides then put them on a wire rack to drain the excess glaze.  When I was finished frying and glazing all of the doughnuts I made a chocolate glaze to top the doughnuts.  You make the chocolate glaze the same way as the regular glaze just add 4oz of semi sweet chocolate chips (for the full recipe) when you melt the butter.  It makes a excellent very authentic chocolate glaze.  The half recipe made 14 full size doughnuts and about 20 or so "holes".  I used a ball canning lid from a pint jar to cut the doughnuts and my daughters bottle opening to cut the holes in the middle.  They were a perfect size. They were very delicious but too much work to do on a daily or even weekly basis for me.  Now I have to go clean all of the many dishes that I messed up making this recipe

These are incredibly delicious! I made the recipe exactly as stated with a small exception in regards to the flour. I added the flour 1/2 cup at a time but once I put in all 5 cups it was still pretty sticky. I added another 1/2 cup or a whole cup can't remember. It's pretty humid here which may have been the issue. I don't think this is very time consuming. Here is what I did- heat up water in a mug and add the yeast. While waiting for yeast/water mixture to foam I poured the next set of ingredients into a bowl (I didn't mix yet though) and by that time the yeast was foamy. I then added it, mixed the ingredients together, added flour 1/2 cup at a time like it states and kneaded the dough and put it in an oiled bowl. I turned my oven on to 200 degrees and as soon as it was done I turned it off, put the dough on the top rack and closed the door to let it double (about an hour). I didn't cover with a towel. After I took the dough out of the oven and rolled it out (make sure it is 1/2 an inch thick- thicker than that and it's too much). I cut out the doughnuts with a doughnut cutter thing and let them sit for 1 hour and 30 minutes. They didn't double in size but a little bit. While I was waiting on them to rise is when I made the glaze. I put them in the oil (this is important step- make sure your oil isn't hotter than 350) and counted for 4-5 seconds and flipped, counted 4-5 more seconds and they were done. Just dip in glaze and let sit (if you don't eat them all!) until cooled

I hate to say it but I really didn't enjoy this recipe. The glaze is somewhat similar to KK doughnuts but the actual doughnut itself doesn't taste remotly like KK. I have tried this recipe twice and each time the doughnuts puff up niely but they aren't fluffy and airy like those yummy bakery douhnuts. The texture is similar to those chinese sweet rolls.

I made this by using my bread machine and cutting the recipe in half.  I used only 1 tblsp of hot water instead of 2 and put ingredients in according to my bread maker.  The dough was beautiful....the taste incredible, it melted in your mouth.  It made 16 donuts with a dozen or so donut holes.  I can't imagine anyone giving this recipe less than 5 Stars.

First have to say they were NO WHERE near being like the same doughnuts offered by a well known chain.  Good but not a "copykat". Ironically these were almost similar to an Alton Brown recipe - w/ the only differentiation being in the amount of sugar - and directions.  It's important to thoroughly check the temperature of both the water and milk -too hot and the yeast will be killed, too cold and the yeast won't activate.
Also a key factor is simply that this dough does NOT need a whole lot of flour -this is a "wet batter" if you add too much flour, the consistency won't be as light.  A good doughnut but not a copykat.

Just an added note: Remember to scald your milk and let it cool to warm first, or use milk from dry milk mix. Unscalded milk will kill your yeast and make it heavy.

I am going to kick myself forever for making this recipe.  They were fantastic which only means that they will be made again and again and again. . . . 

We made a maple icing instead.

Loved the recipe and flavor. Decent approximation of KK doughnuts. Just make sure that your breadmaker has enough capacity for the dough. Mine looked kinda like Hiroshima as the dough pushed out the top! Nonetheless, the doughnuts turned out just fine.

These are good, but not the greatest. They are plain and I get sick of hem very quickly. The recipe said I would get 18 donuts, so I expected a number around there... I ended up with close to 30 donuts, and more than 50 donut holes. I don't know what I'm going to do with them all. And on top of that, I spent almost 2 hours in front of the deep fryer frying these.

Amazing! only a couple of minor changes though. I scalded the milk then cooled it to room temp. I a used bread flour, and used about 1/4 cup less flour than what it called for. After reading the reviews I left the dough on the sticky side, placed it in a metal bowl, covered the dough and placed it in the oven with the light on. I let it rise over an hour the first time (only because we were in the middle of supper). The dough was so light and airy even after "gently" rolling it.Be sure to flour your surface and rolling pin generously. I was afraid I would have a hard time working with the dough but it worked out great. I did add a bit more water to the glaze then tossed the doughnuts in it covering both sides then removed to racks which I had placed newspapers under to catch the dripping. They turned out so good that I would be afraid to try it with the all-purpose flour after having such great results. Very light and airy. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!!

They were like little drops of heaven--each and every bite!
I had one with black coffee and cheese eggs this morning. 
They were still soft because I put them into containers last night.
Tip: Sift the flour. I used a seive.
Tip: Bloom your yeast with the quarter cup warm water and the sugar allotment. The sugar helps the yeast bloom or "foam".
Watch carefully when cooking--they brown quickly. Even if they are a dark brown, when they cool the outside will have a  crispy exterior and the inside will be still soft. These doughnuts were the closest I could have come to Krispy Kreme
however, I don't buy shortening so I used margarine instead. I used my bread machine for the dough and it was okay until after it doubled in size and was all over the unit. Dough was everywhere.  Ultimately, I placed it between two Ziplock bags to roll out a bit at a time sprinkling  a little flour as I went along. Oil keeps it from sticking to you and flour helps it keep its form and makes it less sticky. I used a huge cappuccino cup to cut the shapes.
It was a chore to make but for my first attempt at this, it came out really well. 
These were the best and I will make them again

These were totally amazingly delicious.  It really was amazing that they came out just perfect.  I don't own a donut cutter so I used a tall and thin shot glass and a big 16oz cut to make the donuts and I had to guess the heat of the oil and somehow they came out so so good.  Don't be afraid to try.

If you ever want to try donuts for the first time, this is the recipe to use - you won't look for another one! I made them small, inserted strawberry jam with a syringe, and dusted with confectioners sugar. Melt in your mouth, delicious!

These were a huge hit at my house.  I covered half with the glaze and the other half with a chocolate glaze that I made melting dark chocolate with cream.  My kids even gobbled them up the next day, so I suspect they were still pretty good.  My tip, for those of you that have bread makers, just throw all the ingredients in on dough cycle.  Saves half the work and turnes out beautifully.

I didn't want to post a bad review but....I had a horrible experience with these. ;___; I ended up with a sticky mess. I've searched the reviews and someone said they needed a cup more flour (wish I'd read that before attempting to form my sticky goo into a doughnut shape). Overall, I ended up with a very frustrating experience and no doughnuts.

These were really really good.  My 16yo daughter made them, using all whole wheat flour (all we had) and adding extra yeast to compensate.  We made some with the glaze, and some with sugar.  Will definitely make again.

I lost my favorite doughnut recipe. Now I have A new favorite. Adding nutmeg is perfect. Although, I suggest 1/2 tsp rather than 1 tsp suggested by another reviewer. The glaze is better than my previous recipe.

Hate to give a bad review but these were very disappointing. They taste nothing like Krisy Kremes. Wouldn't have been so bad if the reviews hadn't risen my expectations.

this is by far the best doughnut recipe,easy to make and tastes much better than KK. I stuffed mine with strawberry jam before rising. For ease in removal of raised dough to oil, try dipping the spatula in the hot oil first. the dough will slide easily on and off the spatula.I also raised my dough on a greased pan.I give these a five star plus!!!!!

Very good. I used very vanilla silk milk instead of the milk because of allergies and they still turned out delicious. They browned too quick in the skillet so I had to turn the heat down a little. I didnt have a doughnut cutter so I made doughnut holes. The frosting is amazing. I will make again. Thank you

After reading the other reviews, I was hopeful that these doughnuts would at least be similar to Krispy Kreme. They definately were not. While they had a nice light consistency, but not quite melt-in-your mouth KK, the doughnut itself was lacking in taste. I hoped the glaze would add to the taste, but the glaze only made it worse. Sorry, but I will not be making these again.

I live in Canada and am not familiar with the taste of the famous KK doughnut...nevertheless this recipe is AMAZING!!!  I used my bread machine to make the dough, and it turned out perfectly.  I did not experience ANY of the problems that seem to persist in other reviews. The only change I made in the glaze was in replacing some of the water with extra vanilla. These are high quality...I only wish my camera was working so I could take a picture:)

I don't usually review things, but, for this one, I just had to.

They turned out great! I used a jar with the top floured to cut them, so I got 40, instead of 18. And I used the "Pastry Cream" recipe to fill them.  They were wonderful, and my boyfriend is taking some to work in the morning. Beware, they're time consuming, but, totally worth it.

Our daughter has literally perfected this recipe!!!  We made just a few adjustments and WOW!!! Our adjustments are 'the rave' of our friends here in Germany.  We only use plain shortening...never butter flavored.    We also let the dough rise in a  preheated oven at 170 F. (We use a plastic bowl for mixing, heat the oven to temperature, and then TURN OFF THE OVEN.  We place a pot holder or towel on the rack and put the plastic bowl on top of the pot holder/towel...we then put a towel across the top of the bowl).  The dough rises in half the time as it does on the counter, covered with a towel.    We also ALWAYS make twice the icing amount and use a chopstick to put the doughnut into the icing before placing on a wax papered cookie sheet.  THIS RECIPE NEVER FAILS TO AMAZE!!!

My family LOVED these! We've made them twice in three days (definitely not good for the waistline).  I did find from reading other reviews that you definitely need a lot more glaze. I doubled the recipe for glaze and that was about right. SO TASTY!

This recipe was very messy and time consuming. I had to make the recipe twice to get it right. Also,it required about a cup more flour than the directions called for. Therefore,(due to all the above reasons), I will not make them again. Although, on a bright note the kids loved them and they tasted great, so happy baking...

this recipe is the best...i couldnt believe how great these donuts were.  they were even great up to two days after, yes the texture was a little different but that is to be expected it even happens to that famous donut shops donuts. make these donuts you will not be disappointed. as far as the recipe goes i added 1/4 cup of extra sugar to the dough and everything was perfect!!! well worth the work! and i will do this recipe again, and again...etc.

Best doughnuts I've ever made.  We read Farmer Boy by Laura Ingalls Wilder and it described the mother making homemade doughnuts.  She would twist 2 strips of dough together and then they'd flip themselves during frying. It worked for us, and was a great family activity.

WOW. This was FUN and they came out GREAT! The only thing I would do next time is to make sure my glaze is VERY thin. I didn't do that at first and some were too sweet and I ran out of glaze before I caught on and kept it thin, and then they turned out PERFECT. I will also have my sister over next time to do this a little easier. I was running from the frier to the glaze and back, it was fast-moving messy work, and afterward it looked like a bomb went off in the kitchen. But worth it. I will know next time what I am in for and be a little more prepared. Thanks for an excellent doughnut recipe!

Incredible!  I've made doughnuts before and they would come out really heavy and almost cake like.  These were light and airy.  Even my husband who hates doughnuts went nuts over them!  If you have a bread machine though, make the batch in there, just keep an eye on it as it tends to rise beyond the capacity of the breadmaker.  Thanks for the recipe, its definetly a keeper

It worked! I was so excited that these turned out exactly the way they were supposed to.  The recipe made many more than 18 for me, and I also made doughnut holes. I didn't have a doughnut cutter, so I used a big glass and a shot glass for the holes. I ran out of glaze, but that is b/c I did not add enough water as directed - it was thick.  But plain ones are good too! Thanks!

The best!!  Fry them and eat them right away!  DO NOT put the dough in a refrig over night after being cut!!!  I made dough a day ahead and save them in a refrig to save time...  wrong move!!  The dough rised and they tasted more like break when they're cooked.

My first doughnut attempt!  Effortless perfection.  My family couldn't believe they were not from the pro's!!  The single chopstick idea helped get them out of the oil with ease.  I made strawberry and orange glaze for some by adding some powdered gelatin mix, and coated some with cinnamon and sugar!  A real kid pleaser!!  Will make again and again!

These do taste like the real thing.  I halfed the recipe and made 30 large doughnut balls instead.  If you half it, don't half the sugar coating or you will run out like I did.  My doughnuts were always floating and I just turned them over when they turned light brown. Yummm.  Thanks Kelly!

Amazing!
I made a VEGAN version and they turned out lovely!  Instead of egg I used milled flaxseed (very finely milled - I milled using my own spice grinder, 1tbsn flaxseed + 2 tbsn warm water for each egg, let it sit and get gooey before adding), and I used coconut milk (Coconut Dream, unsweetened) instead of the regular milk.
My dough only held 4c of flour instead of 5c, perhaps because of the substitutions that I made...but it was a lovely dough that rose nicely when I first kneaded it (by hand), and rose again nicely after I had cut-out the doughnuts.  I personally didn't find the dough difficult to handle, due to the shortening in it I did not need extra flour.  Might also be due to the fact that I'm used to handling/kneading dough.  Doughnuts turned out light & fluffy, fried super fast, and no lumps/uncooked centres.  Absolutely beautiful!
Nobody would EVER know they are vegan.  I have a child with food allergies so this is important to me.
I tried the glaze using vegan margarine, was a bit salty so will try Crisco or just icing sugar + water next time.  Also added some Enjoy Life choc chips to half of the glaze to make a chocolate glaze, which was good enough to eat out of the pan (salt balanced the chocolate beautifully).

Wonderful recipe. Absolutely delicious. Substituted the shortening for butter. Crispy on the outside, tender inside. Just sprinkled a little icing sugar on top as I don't like it too sweet. Perfect doughnuts!

Will certainly use again! I halved the recipe and used a bread machine proofing the yeast in the milk, skipping the water.  They were delicious.  We put chocolate frosting on some of them.

This recipe is great! I was looking for a doughnuts recipe like the one's in the bakery and this was definitely what I wanted. I didn't have active dry yeast and so I used instant dry yeast and used 2.5 teaspoons of it. After kneading, it took a short time to rise the first time but took a longer time to rise the second time. I spent about 4 hrs to finish everything up but it was worth it. I fried them without much rising and they really puffed up in the oil.

All in all,this is my go-to recipe for doughnuts from now henceforth.

We have experimented with several donut recipes, as well as a couple pre made dough recipes to deliver hot donuts to our members and friends...this recipe delivers superior quality results every time. It seems everyone in our kitchen is able to follow the recipe without any hiccups as well.  Be sure to not eat too many!

The donut itself was good but the glaze was not good. EDIT: I made this again and it came out perfect. Even the glaze. For the glaze to come out right u MUST do it on the stove. I tried it in the microwave the first time and came out gritty. Tried it on the stove and it came out perfect. This is the only doughnut recipe I will ever use!

This is a great recipe! I halved it and made 12 mini donuts. These tasted awesome as soon as they came out of the fryer. They were very crispy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside. These are the fluffiest donuts I have ever tasted. These donuts tasted even better after they were dipped in the glaze and topped with sprinkles! The only thing was that they were not crispy. Like other viewers, the dough was not sweet enough, but it didn't stop my kids and I from eating them! This was a fun project for my kids, and I will definitely be making these again!

Delicious! Thank you for this wonderful recipe Kelly. I followed it exactly as directed, except i substituted butter for shortening. Also, I used a glass and a orange juice can lid to cut the doughnuts out since i don't have a doughnut cutter. I split the recipe in half, and still got 20 good sized doughnuts after it. Yummy and easy, this recipe was worth the time and effort it took to make it.

Update: Made these again in Dec, 2015. Absolutely scrumptious melt in your mouth doughnuts!!

Update......i would like to add that this needs to be eaten right away because it gets soggy the next day. I will still keep the 5 star rating because it does taste good. The first day it is made it is crispy and chewy and the next day it is very soft. If you notice when you buy donuts and leave them out for a day it gets hard.....probably because it is fried in shortening or lard or the additives in the dough. Either way this is a better way to go bc you can fry in coconut oil, grapseed oil, or canola oil....variety galore!!! Enjoy

the texture was perfect.  I let my donuts over rise, so they fell when I picked them up to put them into the oil, but puffed right back up in the oil and came out the perfect donut texture.  I have to disagree with the first review though, next time I will definitely add more sugar to the dough.  I don't like my donuts over frosted, and like at least *some* sweetness from the actual donut.  This recipe as written produces a pretty bland donut without the frosting.

These are so good, turned out great, the dough is very easy to work with...I followed the recipe exactly. I made some with a glaze, and some I rolled in a sugar/cinnamon mix...I also made up some into bread stix and sprinkled a bit of salt on them and they tasted a lot like the warm pretzels you get at the mall...this is a great base recipe, from this you can make all kinds of doughnuts ...next I am going to dip some into chocolate, and try filling some with jelly and lemon pie filling.

We really liked the doughnuts, not so much the icing. I had to use butter in the doughnuts because I was out of shortening, and they still came out well.

Wonderful recipe! I used my bread make to prep the dough! Thank you to whomever tossed that idea in there, saved me what I imagined was a ton of work! Overall it was a bit (lot) more time consuming than I imagined. But it was so worth it! The recipe made a TON!I provided four full plates, each neighbor got one.  Lucky them.The texture was perfect. They fried perfectly, inside was nice and airy smooth. I added a vanilla bean paste about 1-1 1/2 T. to the glaze and it was incredible, set it apart from the ordinary glaze, but the consistency was great and provided enough for the whole recipe! The recipe is perfect as is! I only added vanilla bean b/c that's my thing :)

My first venture in doughnut making - and it won't be my last!  These were simple and yummy.  I did leave half the dough (unrolled) to sit overnight which created a yeasty doughnut, more complex flavor similar to sourdough.  I enjoyed both batches but I think I will add a little nutmeg next time.  Also I was running a bit low on shortening and used about 1/2 unsalted butter. Topped with various glazes including the one here, a lemon glaze, cinnamon and sugar, and chocolate raspberry.  I filled several with raspberry jam.  This recipe was more than worth the purchase of a doughnut cutter! Thx Kelly!

Easy and delicious! Followed other reviewers' recommendations of letting them rise on squares of waxed paper and gently dumping them into the oil (excellent trick). My thermometer only goes to 350F and my donuts got quite dark, fast, so I think the oil was too hot. But despite their dark hue, they were AMAZING. Eat them within a few hours because they weren't so good later that day.

My mom and I made these- it was the first time I've ever made donuts in my adult life and the recipe is great!  We loved it!  It was so much fun, too.  And they taste delicious.  We re-rolled the scraps one or two times.  Also, we had to use a lot more oil than specified; a quart was only about a centimeter deep.  Oh well- it's a once in a while thing!  These were so fun!  The kids were so excited to come home from school to fresh donuts!

This is a great recipe! I made it vegan with soy milk, earth balance, and egg replacer and it was fabulous!!!! - but vegan resipes are always more moist anyway, so I'm not 100% sure on the original, as intended recipe.

they were delicious!  I followed the recipe just as it was written, it made 2 1/2 dozen + 24 donut holes.  A very easy recipe, will definitely keep this one to use again.

Wow! These are awesome My kids love them and I have one who hates everything lol. They are perfect every time and the glaze is a never ending flavor heaven. I have used maple extract and cinnamon added to vanilla glaze . Peppermint added to chocolate glaze was to die for. Never use another recipe again Thank You!!

I made these last year for Channukah. I made some with fillings & some with glaze or sugared. They were AMAZING! We had so many & I didn't want us to end up eating all of them (we would've - they we so good), I started giving them out. People have been asking me for the recipe or to make them again ever since! DEFINITLY going to do them again this year!

Excellent recipe!  I used high gluten flour instead. If anyone knows how to make it a little "lighter and fluffier", that would be awesome. Anyone?

I made these donuts today.  They are so delicious.  This is the best donut recipe and the taste is awesome.  Now I need to find a donut cutter so the donuts will be perfectly round.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Turned out fabulous & delicious!  Was a humid day so ended up needing more flour.  Instead of the glaze, we dropped the doughnuts in a paper bag with cinnamon sugar and shook them.  Perfect!  My sister and I decided  since the dough itself isn't especially sweet, you could also make savory doughnuts with garlic, parmesan, and seasonings, which we will definitely try the next time we make them.

Perfect donut recipe. Just a word of caution, if using a bread machine the this quantity is a bit too much. Reduce the amount of flour and milk or be prepared to clean up ;-)

These were good. Not much like the real thing.  They were difficult to transfer to the hot oil and my frosting would not stick to my donuts.  So we just dusted with lots of powdered sugar.  These were awsome right out of the oil, but once they cooled they were not very good.  We popped these in the microwave for 10 seconds and they were better.  I also halved this recipe to make 9 but they made more like 2 dozen large donuts.

I did like this quite a lot. It is not identical to Krispy Kreme, but it definitely melts in your mouth and has a light, airy, rich flavor to it. 
I made a few alterations/additions to the doughnuts.
I let the dough rise a little over an hour in the bowl, after rolling and cutting out shapes, I let them rise again an additional 45 minutes instead of my usual 30, mainly because I like my doughnuts to be more thick light and airy. Instead of the butter for the icing, I just mixed vanilla, confectioners sugar, and water until it reached my desired consistency. It ended up being the perfect glaze, it added a nice shine coating to the doughnuts. I also made a Penuche Icing that ended up being EVERYONES favorite. I highly suggest making some of this icing.

These were great...the first day..but like any doughnuts after first 24 hrs they do not have the same wow taste. I didn't have deep fryer or wok, so used the deepest frying pan I had with crisco oil.
Each oil has a different burn temperature, so crisco works great when you have no way to know the temp.  Less then a minute on each side. I will certainly make these again and will either freeze half the dough, or only make half as we are not able to eat all of them. I didn't have a doughnut maker, so just used a large cookie cutter and then my smallest one for the centers and made timbits out of the small ones. I Used both powered sugar and icing sugar on them...yummy

Awesome!  We found that it's best to cook the doughnuts first & the doughnut holes last.  We also made a chocolate sauce to double dip some doughnuts in & then dusted the chocolate-dipped ones with sprinkles.  Our 14 yr old son & 11 yr old daughter said they were the best doughnuts EVER!  We live in a major city, so we have access to Krispy Kreme, Dunkin Donuts & other doughnut shops; but we'll be hard pressed to buy doughnuts ever again after tasting these outstanding doughnuts :)

Easy to make--whipped up the dough in my Bosch and let it rise in there. And the taste? Amazing!!
Beware--if you don't plan to put a hole in the doughnut (like if you want cream/fruit filled ones) make sure you don't roll your dough too thick or the doughnuts won't be able to cook through the center. Obviously this problem is fixed when you make the traditional "hole" kind.

This was my first time making donuts, and the recipe was pretty easy to follow.  I made sure to be EXACT on temperatures of both the warm water, the milk and the oil for frying.  Everything worked out beautifully - I just think I fried them a little too long perhaps.  They weren't as light and fluffy inside as I thought they might be.

everybody in my family loved these when they were filled. Only one sister, and myself, tried it plain. It was O.K. I am not a huge fan of Krispy Kreme, so I don't know how they compare to that, but I do love Albertsons doughnuts!

I get compliments on the best doughnuts when I make these.  Best when eaten in the first day of making them, especially while still hot.  Even after I substituted some of the flour with whole grains flours, flax seed and poppy seed, they were still very soft and delicious.  BETTER than that famous brand by far!

These are absolutly great. They take longer to raise than the recipe says. Also, a little to much vanilla in the glaze if using pure vanilla.

We added a bit more vanilla to the glaze as we thought it was not quite there.  Other than that, these were so good we ate them all the first batch and half of the second batch. We made some chocolate glaze and put it on after the sugar glaze set a bit. My eyes rolled into the back of my head they were so good! You would be a fool to not try this recipe if you like donuts!

Excellent recipe. I had very good results. I had two changes. I didn't have shortening so I used butter. And I added two tablespoons of 'flour improver'. The doughnuts were excellent, the best recipe yet.      I live at 5000 feet altitude and often have a problem with breads, cakes and such being very dense, due to the yeast over-expanding and then collapsing.     But these came out very good.  I look forward to making them again.  But they are best eaten right away. For some reason, doughnuts lose their wow factor after resting overnight.      Well worth the time and effort.  Actually not much more work than other doughnut recipes that I've made before.

Not bad for my first attempt, however, i did change a few things because the packet of active dry yeast is quite expensive here, so i used instant dry yeast instead. I made some research and decreased the yeast amount needed by 25%, so i only used 6g of instant dry yeast assuming an envelope of active yeast contains 8g. then i just added in in the flour mixture because it doesn't require proofing, but i also added the water required for proofing the yeast, so my liquid ratio is still the same. I only let in rise one time. then i fried them,my first few donuts were burned do i reduced the temperature, after i few tries i decided to use the method of turning off and on the stove and i got a light golden brown color. I also stick with the sugar cinnamon coating because i sisn't like the glaze, maybe its because we only have vanilla essence in here:) overall i could try it again next time:)

My family loved them...I let them raise a bit too much the second time so the donuts were huge.  Will make again, cut them smaller and not let them raise a second time.  Delicious!!

I have followed many recipes on this site that were great but only this once have i been compelled to write a review.  These doughnuts are better than any you can buy anywhere.  I made the dough in my bread machine (i sub. the active dry yeast with 4 1/2 tsp of bread machine yeast) so this recipe was insanely easy.  Wonderful!  Thank you!

These were mmmmm good! I am only 12 years old, and my family loved them! The only negative is, when I took the dough out of the bowl after it had risen, it was soooo sticky! So, I advise everyone to sprinkle alot of flour on the top of the dough before you roll it. Great Recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly and these are perfect! Mine took 45 min to rise the first time, and 35 the second time.  Its a cold snowy day so I set my oven to 170degrees, put the dough in to rise, and turned it off.  Worked wonders both times! This is the best recipe, they almost melt in your mouth. So much for just eating one!

This recipe is a staple in my house now.  It has become a part of our Christmas day tradition, and for good reason.  This is pretty simple and straight forward and creates some decadent little treats.  I've made the recipe at least ten times at this point and have never had a "bad batch", so it ranks high for ease of consistency as well.  Enjoy, I know my family does.

Hands down, this was the easiest dough I've ever worked with.  I rolled it out, cut out the doughnuts, saved the holes, and used the scraps to make twists.  The doughnut holes and the twists were fabulous and really the highlight of the entire doughnut making experience.  The holes were good because they were small and bite size; the twists because I added cinnamon which gave them flavor. The doughnuts themselves were just o.k.  Nothing more than a typical doughnut you would find at a grocery store bakery.  They were somewhat flavorless, on the heavy side, and as others have described, tasted like fried bread.  They were good when they were fresh out of the fryer, but as each hour passed, so did they.  I have added this recipe to my "keep" file because I really like the dough, but doubt I will ever use it to make traditional doughnuts.  I'm going to stick with the cinnamon twists.

These doughnuts taste more like a sweet dinner roll than like a doughnut. Or maybe even the bread you use for cinnamon rolls. I stuck with the recipe and followed the advise to put them on greased wax paper so not to deflate them but still got a more dinner roll texture and taste. My son loves them regardless, bread and sugar together is all he cares about :).  If you just want something sweet for the kids this is fun and easy to make together. So I give it 3 stars for the fun activity to do with my son and not 5 stars because I expected crispy creamy tastyness and didn't get it.

The name does not fit the doughnut.  The dough was tougher than the actual ones that are trying to be duplicated.  Very bland.  Not worth the effort.

Great Recipe  - didn't change a thing! My mom use to make doughnuts when we were kids but hasn't made them for years.  I cut the recipe in 1/2 and made a batch.  When she came down she couldn't get enough - same with the grandkids.  Today is our (Canadian) Thanksgiving and I have made bread and pies to take out to my sisters but also sitting here this morning craving these doughnuts so I think I will make an entire batch and make doughnut holes with half that I will take for today and freeze the rest in doughnut shape for another day.  Also going to melt chocolate chipits with the butter to make a chocolate glaze for some.    UMMMMMM!!  Can't wait.   Thanks for a great recipe!

We loved this recipe!  The doughnuts had a chewier texture than the "well known" crispy cream doughnuts, but the glaze was dead on in taste.  I used a glass to cut the doughnut shape and then the one end of a turkey baster to cut the inside hole and they were the perfect sizes (if you don't have a doughnut cutter on hand).  Thanks for the great recipe!

The taste is awesome but it absorbs quite a bit of oil that I had to toss the donuts in kitchen towel several times. Set the fryer at 350 and then 375 but both gave me same result.

this recipe was FABULOUS!!! if i could give it 10 stars i would! i took other people advice and cooked them on 325. the only thing i would make a note about is to make sure the glaze is still hot when you put it on the warm donuts so that its not too thick. it drys pretty quickly.

These doughnuts were good, but not quite like the ones from the doughnut shop; it is rather easy to tell which doughnut shop they are supposed to taste like! They were not quite "fluffy" enough, but they were very good! I'm sure I will make them again, because my family really loved them! They also looked very nice, and the glaze was very tasty. Thanks for the recipe; it is definitely the closest I've come to recreating the doughnuts from that doughnut shop!

I mixed up the recipe as stated, and ended up with a very thin batter. I ended up mixing in four more cups of flour just to make it almost workable-instead of tossing it. I got it rolled out with lots of flour only to have it raise very odd and stick to the well-oiled pan. Once cooked, they tasted very yeasty, bland, and they held a huge amount of oil even though they cooked at the right temp. For so much work, time, and money wasted in ingredients, this was the most disappointing recipe that I've ever tried.

I absolutely loved this recipe. They were delicious and really tasty. The process for making them was quite stick but worth it.
I have never tried krispy Kreme Donuts but I have eaten Dunkin Donuts so I was expecting a similar taste to them, and I was happy with my expectations.
And the glaze was to lick for!!
Thank You so much.

I agree with the lady who wrote that this is an excellent sweet bread dough as well. I like it for cinnamon rolls becasue it is a little lighter and doesn't dry out quickly. The donuts were good but if oil is not the right temp or if you turn your back they will come out too dark. If they are dark at the edge where you can see then they are much too dark on the bottom. I don't have a temp regulated fryer. I use my moms cast iron pan and a thermometer. I would recommend a fryer if possible but they will still be too dark if you cook the time specified. A great dough for many sweet bread uses and good donuts with careful watching.
Thanks for sharing.

I made these several years ago, and they were delicious.  I don't care for them when they are fried in vegetable oil.  I think they taste much better fried in shortening.  They will taste more like the KK ones.  I thought the only differnece was in the glaze.  KK's glaze was sweeter.  I am going to go and make them right now.  The only question I have, is can I some how prepare them ahead of time, and fry them later?

These are simply Awesome! I made these the other night and used a cupcake filling recipe I found on here to fill them then frosted them with chocolate frosting. They are as close as you can get to the real thing. My family went crazy and now want more. Thanks for the amazing recipe!

This was the best doughnut I have ever tasted!

I lived close to a doughnut shop called "honeys" in North Vancouver which used to be my all time fav.

There is nothing that compares to a fresh and warm glazed doughnut like this!

I have to say that it makes almost double the amount of doughnuts compared to what the recipe states.  I would also caution to keep the doughnuts very far apart when they are on their second rising so that you don't have to pull them away from each other.  

This was my 1st attempt at doughnuts and I am very pleased with the result.

these were my first attempt at frying doughnuts.  they turned out great!  i started by making them traditional style and then made some boston creme doughnuts.  now, those were the bomb!!!  i did think that they were a little too greasy though but that was my fault i think.  also, be sure that when you allow them to rise the second time that they are not touching each other or even close...you'll end up w/ pancakes.  :)  mine went thru a 3rd rising b/c of this!

OMG, theese were the first time making this and I have to admit, it was tough! It took pretty long to make the dough by it was sooo worth it. The doughnut was light and fluffy and I shallow fry it so that not much oil is absorbed and it's so good. Will be a keeper

I made this in my breadmaker.   Dough was a little sticky, when rolling out I used flour and found it to be perfectly manageable.  Cooked perfectly in the oil.  Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.   Perfect eaten warm.  Yum.

I must have done something wrong...although I followed the directions! My husband said they tasted like a fried fortune cookie (not quite what I was going for...) We don't fry a lot of foods, so this probably turned out wrong for me because of my lack of experience frying.

My husband said these were BETTER than Krispy Kreme!  They are delicious!
I halved the dough recipe and it still made PLENTY!  I also used butter instead of shortening, which worked fine.  I kneaded it all by hand, which is way more fun, especially if you're doing it with kids.
Do not be discouraged if you do not have a donut cutter.  After I rolled out the dough so it was still pretty thick, I used sissors to cut it into short strips and made them into donut shapes.  It was tons of fun because you can make big ones, small ones, thick ones or skinny ones!  And why stop there?  Why not make letters or fun shapes?  We didn't do that this time, but I don't see why you couldn't.  I will definitely make these again but probably not for another year or so because they are so fattening!

I really want to say that we loooved them like everyone else, but we didn't...  I followed the recipe exactly and judging by all the 5 stars, it must've been something I did, but don't know what!  They were very bread-ish, and not so fluffy/melt-in-your mouth like Kispy Kreme.  Actually without the glaze, they taste exactly like the sweet rolls you get at Roadhouse!  It was alot of work so if I'm ever having a craving for Krispy Kreme, I think I'll just go there :)

I wouldnt go as far to say they are as good as KK but they are definitely an excellent homemade donut.  After frying all the donuts I fried the donut holes and then rolled them in a sugar-cinnamon mixture.  The only change I made in this recipe was I did not have any shortening so I used canola oil instead.

My daughter has severe food allergies and has never had a doughnut; I was able to successfully adapt this recipe by substituting soy milk for cows and a mixture of 2T. veg. oil/2T. warm water/1t. baking powder (mix before adding to recipe) for the eggs.  I also added 1t. xanthum gum to help with binding.  For the glaze, I used a dairy-free margering instead of butter.

The recipe was a SUCCESS!!!!! She loved the doughnuts and friends that I shared them with compared them to Dunkin' Doughnuts and my husband who is my best critic compared them to Krispie Kremes.

We will be making these often!!!!

Delicious! Not quite as light and melt in your mouth as KK, but still the best recipe I've tried. Some tips: I cut the yeast to 4 tsp since some users complained about a strong yeast flavor. They still rose beautifully. Might try to cut it more. Definitely needs at least 2 tsp of salt or the dough won't have much flavor. One tsp or even 1 1/2 tsp isn't enough. Your dough will be bland. Didn't add more than the 5 cups of flour, and they were light and airy. Good sweet dough recipes are always notoriously sticky, and I put a lot of flour on the counter both when I rolled them and for the second rise. If you don't, your doughnuts will stick a little and fall when you go to fry them and won't be as light and airy. If you don't cook them long enough, they won't "puff" as much, and will be denser. I found when the oil was hot enough, it only took 30 seconds on each side for the perfect doughnuts. I only cooked about 3 at a time so I didn't lower the temp of the oil. Glaze when warm, not hot. Might try at least half potato flour next time for an even more tender and light taste. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These doughnuts are really good. I made these for church and no one could believe they were homemade. I actually made and cut the dough the day before. After letting them rise the second  time, I covered them and put them in the refrigerator. In the morning I put them in a warm oven with a filled glass container of water. I then fried them in a fryer and glazed  them with icing. If you like a lot of icing on your doughnuts (glazed all the way around) you will definitely need at least a double batch. I would suggest not adding additional flour to this recipe. The dough seems really sticky and it is supposed to be that way. If you add more flour they will likely become dense. I made them according to the recipe and even though some of the doughnuts fell before frying, they were still a good consistency and tasted great!

Made these this morning and they are delicious!! I can't believe they came from MY kitchen. I can't wait till the kids get home to try them. I followed the recipe to the letter except I had my oil at 335 degrees. At 350 they turned to brown to fast. I also only used a tsp of vinilla in the glaze as I have  real vinilla that I got in Mexico. I glazed half of the doughnuts with vanilla glaze then added about a 1/2 of a cup of chocolate chips to the rest of the glaze and did the rest in chocolate. We live 22 miles from the closest place to buy fresh baked goods and these doughnuts are just like the ones they make. Thank you!!

This is a really great recipe.  But something people should know is that the recipe needs more SALT.  A lot of people loved the texture, but think that the doughnut itself was kind of bland.  This is because the proportion of salt to flour should be about twice what is written.  Thank you for the great recipe.   It was the first time I've made doughnuts and they were a hit.    Not quite KK, but a great alternative!

This is the best doughnut recipe I've tried. These come out soft & lighter than most homemade doughnuts. My family loved these just as much as the ones at our favorite doughnut shop. This one is definitely a keeper! :o)

This was a fun and delicious recipe!  I had my whole family involved in making these and everyone had a great time.  This recipe is good but it definetly does not taste like Krispy Kreme or (for fellow canadians and northern americans) Tim Hortons.  In my opinion these are actually better than anything from a chain!  I used the glaze provided but also tried dipping it in cinnamon sugar.  On top of all of that I also made some sugr twists by rolling the dough with my hands into a thin length and then twisted it around itself.

My husband thought I had found the recipe for KK!...They are close, and if you want them to stay fresh, just put any leftovers in the freezer and defrost in the microwave when you want them ( I have a frozen roll setting on mine). I did make a couple of changes to the recipe because I made do with what I had on hand...I used buttermilk instead of milk, and used butter instead of shortening, but they still turned out great!Next time I will decrease the yeast to 4 tsp. instead of 4 1/2 to see if they might be a little less yeasty tasting.

MMM!  These were good!  I agree with others that they are not as light as KK but I think they are better.  (I never really cared much for the KK.)I did have to add a little more flour but thats to be expected with different climats, temperatures and humidity.  I had just enough glaze for the rounds, but I rolled the holes in sugar.  As for how long and how well they keep, I did not have to worry about that. I have a large doughnut loving family of 6 ( not to mention the help of the 3 cousins)and the doughnuts were pretty much eaten as fast as I could glaze them.  I would have liked to have submitted a picture but I did not have any doughnuts left to photograph.  Good recipe. Thanks for sharing. :)

Wow! These were amazing! I learned my lesson with the first few; you should not keep the donuts in the fryer for too long. But the other ones turned out amazing! And this recipe also worked perfectly with donut holes. Thanks!

simply delicous, easy, light and fluffy!!! Just make sure your watch the amount of flour, I found it took approx.4 1/2 cup to get the right consistency for the dough. Love it, will use again & again. I also made it into dinner rolls. thanks for such a wonderful recipe

These were wonderful! I made the dough the night before and fried them the next day. They are a light doughnut not heavy like some we have tried. The dough was also easy to handle.

great taste! love the buttery icing. heres a few changes i made:

-i added more flour, when kneading the dough
-added more sugar to the dough mixture
- reduced the amount of water for the icing
also make sure to eat them fresh, as this recipe makes about 40 dougnuts! 
the next day, they did not taste as good, as the dough became hard, and the icing became watery. So make sure to eat them fresh!

These doughnuts are great!  I had to make them 3 times to get it right, but once I did my family loved them.  I found that the glaze recipe didn't make enough so now I double the glaze recipe.  They are also great with chocolate glaze on the top!

What makes a good recipe for me is if I want to make it again.  This one is delicious.  Easy to make.  The only thing I did different is after I finished making the dough I put in a bowl wrapped with plastic wrap to let it rise in the refrigerator overnight.  I took it out this morning and finished the steps of rolling the dough out, cutting the doughnuts, letting them rise and cooking them quickly in my wonderfully handy cast iron skillet.  Thanks for the recipe Kelly, very delicious.

Oh my, YUMMY!!! The only words to describe these fluffy little treats is SINFUL. Although the didn't taste anything like the double K, they were equally as good in a different way. The recipe was simple and I did not need to make any substitutes. THANKS!!!

These are  great homemade  donuts. They are as  close  to a kk as you will get and are way better than  those  *canned biscuit* type  donuts. I make mine  in my breadmachine  on the  dough cycle and then rise in my oven for about an  hour. Great  with  chocolate glaze  too. Thanks  Kelly  for a great  recipe!

WOW!  These were fantastic.  After ruining the first 8 I fried, the remaining 5 and 12 holes went fast with my family.  I had the oil way too hot and not only did they burn, but the spatula melted and made a horrible mess!  I highly recommend using a thermometer and a metal spatula!!  We  will definitely make these again.

I originally reviewed this recipe under another name (TPAYNE1), but was unable to use that name again.  The second time I made these, I used only white flour and let them rise in the oven.  They still weren't too much different from wheat flour.  I had just enough glaze, but it was so hot the day I made them that the butter was seperating.  Be careful with that.  It's the same problem a lot of people have with homemade frosting.  Just put it in the fridge for 30 minutes and then stir it back up.

Definately an awesome recipe. They tasted absolutely delicious. A couple words of advice though; I added a bit more sugar than mentioned, to the dough, I also made more glaze than stated. If you half the dough recipe, don't half the glaze. The glaze is tasty. I fried the donuts at 300 (not 350) so they didn't burn. These things don't keep well at ALL, so it is best to have a bunch of people around to help you eat them all within the same day. To be honest, these donuts aren't like Tim Hortons or Krispy Kreme, but they are still awesome!

These were my first successful donut attempt! After my last failed attempt 2 years ago I thought I would never try again, but I'm so glad I did! The donuts were light and delicious. Only 4 stars, though, because 1) I had to add an extra cup of sugar, 2) The donuts themselves (without the glaze) are a bit bland, and 3) If you cut big donuts, the insides will still be raw when the outside is done. Overall, though, a pretty good recipe - I'm sure I'll be making these again.

These came out very good.  I mixed and kneaded with my Kitchenaid, only adding an extra 1/4 cup of flour.  I used a deep fryer, keeping the temperature more like 360*.  Homemade doughnuts are not something that "keeps"--they're best eaten within hours.

Excellent donut recipe.  They melt in your mouth and the glaze is wonderful.  I do agree that you may need to make more glaze because you'll want to keep dipping in it.  And you also may need to use more flour than required.  I found that making sure I sifted the flour made it extra tender.

we just got K K doughnuts in Austrailia and they are VERY EXPENSIVE. these turned out yummy just as good as the real thing and certainly not as expensive. I also made them stuffed with jam, and icing sugar (in the usa u call it powdered sugar i think) any great recipe thanx. they are also nice cut in half with cream and jam or choclate icing.

These are by far the best doughnuts I have ever made.  The only change I made was that I used margerine instead of the shortening.  They are the very best hot, just like they are at our "favorite doughnut shop".  LOL  I also found that the recipe makes at least 2 dozen.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy and tasty. I will definately keep this one. I didn't have a doughnut cookie cutter so I used a biscut cutter and poked a hole in the middle.

Krispy Kremes these are not!! But I haven't found any doughnut that does compare to the real thing. These are still very good - and fairly easy. This was my first time making doughnuts and the kids really enjoyed them. I would recommend doubling the glaze if you want to glaze all of them. We double dipped ours and so ran out of glaze. But for the rest I made doughnut holes and shook them in a bag with sugar and cinnamon. These certainly won't be a regular thing as they're definitely not healthy, but fun for an occasional treat.

I thought the dough needed to be sweeter so I increased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and used a glaze of 2 cups powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla, and 2 tablespoons milk. The 5 tablespoons hot water was just too much and made the glaze too thin.

I'm just posting in response to another reviewer's erroneous warning against scalding the milk.  If you want to scald your milk, then it will not kill the yeast!  Because anyone in their right mind realizes that the milk is scalded and cooled before ever coming into contact with the yeast...  :P

Made the dough and cut out day before let them rise, then popped them in the fridge to stop rising.  Cooked 30 sec each side. Amazing! Fluffy!
Made it with key lime butter cream on top

I followed the recipe but when it got to the end, my dough was still so sticky. I had to add almost an extra half cup of flour to the dough so it to not stick. Also, it took probably 2 hours for my dough to rise to double the size. Is this normal? Can anyone please give me some advice? Does it have anything to do with the temperature of the milk and water? Thanks!

These were amazing! Used butter instead of shortening. They came out great at around 325 degrees. I halved the recipe and got more than a dozen good-sized doughnuts with glaze to spare.

best regards from AL- Singapore

Amazing dough. Stuck right to the recipe as written and had no problem making this into donut holes and sticks. Used it in my Phillips air fryer and it turned out perfect. Instead of adding a glaze to the outside I rolled the donut holes in powdered sugar and then air fried them up. Wonderful dough! Definitely a 5/5

These were just amazing. Delicious. My husband said, "Every time I think you've reached a new dessert high, you go and surprise me and make something even better." :) I made a half batch and had to add one extra cup of flour to the dough to give it the correct consistency but otherwise followed all instructions as written. Takes some time, but definitely worth it. Will definitely make these again.

I couldn't wait to try this recipe ever since I came across it and it's very good! I changed things a bit though such as I added the sugar, shortening and salt to the milk as I heated it so that these ingredients would be completely dissolved . As well, just for my own taste I added a teaspoon and a half of vanilla extract to the , now, lukewarm milk mixture. It's true what 
other reviewers say DON'T add too much extra flour the dough once you knead it does have to be smooth and elastic but still quite soft and pliable.This dough rises beautifully and once put in the hot lard ( another change I made as the donuts are not as greasy then ) they do brown QUICKLY . 
This is a very easy recipe and the end
result are lovely fluffy donuts , mind you mine aren't really crispy as I didn't want them to get dark brown , with a great texture ! I really love this recipe and I can't stress enough that ( at least for me ) I found this to be a fairly easy recipe . Definitely a wonderful recipe !

I have used this recipe many MANY times. As is. I love it. I think the doughnuts turn out light, and fluffy, and delicious! I have even made the dough the day before, let it raise, punch it down. Then cover it and stuff it in the fridge until morning! Perfect every time. It seems to be very forgiving. I have also played with the icing recipe, by adding in 1/4-1/2 cup of cocoa. Yum.

Great fluffy doughnuts!
The dough was a bit soft so I ended up incorporating bit more flour, but it was an easy to follow recipe with great results.I used the greased wax paper tip and left a few on the side just flowered on the countertop, pealed them off carefully and they were a bit uglier, but not different in taste. With the trimmings and the balls I made a couple of buns and they still rose and baked great despite all the kneading.
I didn't use the glaze recipe tho.

Thank you for this great recipe! With a little practice (don't handle too much) they are nice and soft and oh so good.  Play with different flours, while I'm a huge fan of KA, I bought a hotel/restaurant flour from GFS (unbleached of course), works awesome. They freeze exceptionally well.   My favorite part...the glaze....soooo good. If your watching your waistline, well... make them occasionally as a treat.  You can tweek to your liking....Looks and tastes better than my local donut shop!  Definitely a keeper for me.

I love this recipe but it's usually too many doughnuts for my family to eat as they need to be eaten as soon as possible once they are cooked because they are fried and raised so they are not nearly as good the next day.I usually halve the recipe,warm my milk in a small sauce pan with the shortening in as well just until the shortening begins to melt then I turn off the stove and mix the yeast with some warm h2o (110*-115*) a tsp. or so of white sugar in a small mixing glass until it is foamy.I put the rest of the sugar and the salt into my 1970 something Sunbeam stand mixer bowl and whisk them together.I then add the milk and shortening(around 110*) and yeast mixture to the bowl and mix them together,then some flour and follow the rest of the recipe instructions.This recipe was my first successful attempt at raised doughnuts and it never lets me down.

These are the best donuts I've had in my entire life, with no exceptions. Admittedly, I don't have donuts often, but I have had a few from some very notable chains, and they weren't nearly as good as these.

They are time-consuming, but not hard, and worth every minute. (My KitchenAid mixer made the kneading effortless.) I won't ever need another glazed donut recipe.

Mine made nearly four dozen, instead of 18, so I may have rolled mine out a bit thin. They looked perfectly normal after frying, though, so I'm not sure what to attribute it to. (I'm not complaining!) Accordingly, I had to make two batches of the glaze to frost all of my donuts.

I also had to add about another 1/4 cup of flour to keep the dough from sticking to the bowl, but I know from my bread-baking experience that weather sometimes affects the amount of flour needed from one time to the next, at least where I live.

This recipe is amazing! The donuts are crispy and the glaze is buttery and brings out the flavor.
The only thing I changed is I fried it with home renedered lard and expeller pressed coconut oil and the flavor came out great, you can't even taste the coconut. I found out that you have to be VERY careful not to overwork the dough because it will make the donut lose its crispy-ness. Also about the glaze you do not need a lot of confectioners sugar. I also tried adding a Tablespoon of maple flavoring to make it taste more like a maple bar.
Awesome recipe somebody even told me it was better then Krispy creme! 
I would give this 6 stars if I could!

Thanks!

The recipe came out very chewy. Not in a good way either. I followed it exactly too, except I had to add almost 2 more cups of flour to get a workable dough. Instead of the 18 it says it makes, it made 30 doughnuts and 13 doughnut holes. Had fun making them with the kids... but won't use this recipe again. I went to baking school so I know how to make doughnuts, wanted to new recipes though.

I've made this recipe dozens of times.  It works if you know how to manage yeast breads.  I use SAF instant yeast and let them rise nice and high on greased parchment and they transfer wonderfully.  Control the temp of your oil carefully as well or you'll get mediocre results.  These are incredibly simple to make if you're familiar with doughnuts.  I like to glaze the doughnuts on both sides and hang them on a chopstick to drip dry.  This is as close as you'll get to the original recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly but they didn't turn out as good as I was expecting. The texture unusual - it looks like it's been cooked all the way through but it doesn't taste that way. Very doughy, and I'm certain that if is cooked them any longer then they would be burnt. Also? The donuts themselves don't have any flavor-it all comes from the glaze.

These turned out really well. Using a doughnut cutter I was able to get over 40 doughnuts. For half the batch I dipped each side of the doughnuts in cinnamon/sugar. I used 3/4C sugar and 2T of cinnamon. By the end of the day we had less than a dozen left.

So much better than store bought doughnuts.  I had a bread machine so it was easier to make.  I put the yeast and warm water in the bread machine first and waited 5 minutes for it to foam.  Then I added the ingredients according to my machine's directions and put it on "dough" setting. Worked like a charm.

these are absolutely gorgeous. they are exactly like the donuts in the shops, totally would recommend if you have any spare time during the week ends. it's fluffy and soft, but do try to pat down the oil as much as possible to make it look attractive

Oh wow....I mean it, WOW!  Every time I pass a Krispy Kreme I feel myself being drawn toward them like they have their own gravity field, but I resist because I know I can't eat just one and due to tummy issues I can't eat a lot of sweets so I'm cursed!!.  I've had this recipe saved for a LONG time and it's been haunting me.  I keep telling myself, "they'll never taste the same", or "I'll screw up the recipe and they'll fail miserably".  Well, I finally gave in to the temptation and made them tonight and they are AWE-SOME!!  I tried to mess them up....twice.  I almost forgot to add yeast (i mixed everything in my bread machine), but I tossed it in and the dough came out perfect (darnit!).  Then I had an emergency come up and had to leave the dough for a few hours to rise a second time and they STILL came out fantastic!  I only ate one but knowing I can make these makes me feel very bad. :)

This is the best yeast doughnut that I've ever made!! Every time I make them and bring them some place people think I stopped and bought them at a doughnut shop. They cant believe that I made them myself. I follow the recipe exactly, fry at 325 degrees. I have made the glazed doughnuts, but I've also made them and filled them with jelly and powdered sugar on top, homemade custard cream filled with chocolate glaze on top, and homemade vanilla frosting filled with chocolate glaze and sprinkles on top. They are always a HUGE hit!!! The best advice to give anyone trying this for the first time is to make sure that your water and milk are at the correct temperatures so as not to kill your yeast...this is one of the only places you could go wrong where they wouldn't come out. :)

These doughnuts were really good, and the glaze was pretty spot on for Krispy Kremes, but the density of the actual doughnuts was a little too thick to be a perfect match. I didn't have any of the problems others noted, such as "not sweet enough" or "too yeasty". These doughnuts turned out perfectly as doughnuts in general, and with a little tweaking, could definitely be really close to Krispy Kremes!

Ok..so the recipe asks for 2 envelopes of yeast but the video asks for one.  Which one is right?  Nevertheless, I used one envelope and the dough rose well.  I used my bread machine and made things so much easier.  The doughnuts puffed up nicely during frying, but still came out dense. Made 25.  Need to be eaten immediately... Not good cold.  Definitely not KK or Dunkin, but still good.  My icing turned out bumpy so need to work on it.  Overall, good recipe, and I had fun!

For the glaze you can add 1/4 cup cocoa for chocolate glaze, or 1 tsp. maple flavoring for maple glaze donuts. Love this recipe it's a keeper!

I came home from work wanting to make doughnuts, found this one, made it, and tadaa...my friend and I are enjoying the profits.  I found the recipe very easy to follow.  As I didn't have a doughnut cutter, I used a biscuit cutter and a pop bottle cap :-)  Where there's a will, there's a way!  I will definitely be making these for our guests coming in a few days!

Made this as a treat for the family and I did cheat by using my bread machine, but it came out perfect. I did allow the dough to rise a second time after cutting out the doughnuts and it made them very fluffy and airy. The butter glaze was used as a dipping sauce cause it was so yummy!
 Also I lowered the serving amount to 10 and still ended up with over 20 doughnuts(not including holes). My cutter is 2 3/4 inch sized cutter.
  Thank you!

I worked in a bakery and did the donuts for 15 years. I agree with Brooke who wrote that the glaze only needs 10x sugar, vanilla and a
little milk. You can also try this which is close to how I did it in the bakery using a proffessionl rack. Put your donuts on the rack with a baking pan underneath. While the donuts are still hot pour the warm glaze over them staight from the pot. If you want you can flip the entire pan over at this point using another baking pan the same size as a top and glaze the other side and they will be more like Krispy Kream.

So I just made these and I have to say I am really impressed.  I didn't use the glaze that was in the recipe, I made mine so I could fill them with a nice cream filling.  My husband ate two one right after the other.  I didn't have a hard time at all with them not raising, soon as I put them in the oil they puffed up even more.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!!

I halved this recipe and still got a dozen donuts and about 15 donut holes. Despite the fact that the initial yeast foamed, I didn't get a ton of rise. I used my KitchenAid mixer with the dough hook like other reviewers did. I let it go for an hour in the sun of the backyard and it rose a little. I used a 2.75" opening drinking glass for the large hole and a 1.5" cap for the little hole. I added minimal flour as I worked the sticky dough. Back outside to rise again, but I really don't think anything happened at all. When I made the glaze, the powdered sugar eventually took all of the liquid and formed a few large clumps - after I added some hot water it thinned out just fine, though. I only made 3/4 of the 1/2 for the glaze and that was still more than I needed. Frying the donuts was easy enough, glazing worked fine. They tasted good and all, but the whole process wasn't worth the time and work. I might try them one more time just to attempt Boston Cremes or jelly-filled, but otherwise, no go.

I used fast active yeast wich i added to the flour.  Turned out great!  Doughtnut definatly needs a glaze because they are not sweet on their own which is great! I will make again!! Note I put  2 1/4 tea spoon of yeast (which is ONE package)

I am a novice, so I was worried, but these came out awesome! Not sure why all the bad reviews. If I can make these anyone can!
Update: A lot of negative reviews said these went stale after 12 hours? I made my batch for breakfast yesterday and they are still great this morning! I didn't have shortening so I used butter, otherwise I followed recipe exactly!!!! I don't have a oil thermometer so I cooked them between 5 and 6 on my stove top

I don't like this recipe as I have had to add more flour then it is stated in the recipe. The dough was so sticky that I couldn't knead it properly.

This was my first try at making donuts and they were indeed crispy and creamy. I followed the recipe exactly, using tips from the helpful reviews: frothy yeast in lukewarm water, didn't add too much more flour in the kneading, let the donuts rise on a greased sheet of wax paper and slid them off the paper into the hot oil. I'll make these again for sure.

Loved this recipe.. The only slight modification I did was that I used one small packet of bread improver, and i took 2 tablespoons out of the 1/2 cup of sugar to help activate the yeast at the beginning (dissolved the sugar in 1/4 cup of water and 1 cup milk lukewarm, then sprinkled the yeast and left the mixture till it foamed up) other than this used the exact recipe (after yeast foamed up i added all remaining ingredients, the rest of the milk and sugar). It's also worth noting that I used my bread machine on the dough cycle to make the dough rise. Didn't need to knead, the machine took care of that.
Great recipe, thank you!

I read the bad reviews and the only thing i can think of is that they added too much flour and over kneaded the dough. I stuck to the dough recipe and they came out amazing! My family is singing my praises.  i doubled the glaze recipe and used 2 tsp orange extract and one tsp vanilla extract. Def will use this recipe again!!

OMG...these donuts are just like the old-fashioned ones you'd get at the pastry shop before Dunkin Donuts was on every corner and now all those shops are out of business!  I am pleased beyond belief at how easy these were to make, how well they came out and best of all with the taste.  I have people salivating since I already posted pictures of my fresh donuts on Instagram, Facebook and twitter. I would advise reading the reviews to get some tips in regard, because they helped make these donuts super easy to make.  FOLLOW THE RECIPE EXACTLY and make sure the temperature for the liquids is correct.  I had it at about 110 for the water and about 115 for the milk.  I saved half my dough in the freezer and I am planning to make them again very soon.  Thank you for allowing me to FINALLY have the donuts of my youth that I can't find anymore as easily as I once did.  Thank you!

My kids and husband loved these. This batch made 25 donuts and 25 donut holes. I rolled them in sugar but will try the glaze next time. i have to disagree with other reviewers: the dough is not bland. if your roll it in sugar or put a glaze on top, it adds just the right amount of sweetness

This recipe is great!! It worked out perfectly and everyone loved them! I tried freezing a batch of the dough once though, and the doughnuts came out very dense and didn't rise well at all.

yes, I tried it.  i have always used dried milk in my bread products and used it in this.  Way to save calories and it works.  For those who want sweeter dough, add the sugar to the topping.  having lived in Europe, most deserts are not as sweet but the toppings and fillings are.  found that is the way to go.  Add your individuality there.

Totally loved it. I used to make donuts quite a bit, but lost my favorite recipe. These donuts turn out exactly like the fluffy, soft donuts I used to make. Glad to find this recipe for normal yeast-donuts!

Wonderful donuts!  At first I was worried, since they tasted so plain without any glaze, but afterwards they are a lot sweeter.  I do have a huge sweet tooth at times, and this time I was going for something a bit sweeter.  Next time, I will try adding a little more sugar.  All in all, great recipe, and easy, too, although it requires a bit of patience.  I topped mine with chocolate glaze, cinnamon sugar, colorful vanilla glaze, and normal vanilla glaze.

Best doughnuts I have ever made.  I didn't have enough glaze however and had to make more but I omitted the butter the second time and just used milk powdered sugar and vanilla.  I prefer the glaze without the butter in it.

VERY GOOD!!! and close to KrispyKreme , a little denser but still awesome.  A key like some other posters said, make sure your yeast is good, if it doesnt foam when proofing toss it, and make sure to let them rise well after you cut them, this gives the good airbubbles.   I halved the recipe and got about 14 plus the holes that I didnt want to re-roll

These were my first donut making experience and they turned out great! Not quite as light and fluffy as a store bought donut, but a great alternative! I don't have a donut cutter, but now I might get one so I can make these more often with a little more ease (I just used a cup and a small circle cookie cutter for the middle.) I cut the recipe in half and it turned out great. Used just slightly less flour than the recipe called for. That's why you add it a little at a time.

AWESOME!!!  NOT greasy at all. DO NOT....I REPEAT, DO NOT BAKE THESE.  If you do you will end up with nice dinner rolls and not donuts.  If you are avoiding sugar and fat, don't make these then and DON'T try to bake them.  Donuts are not meant to be "low cal" period.  Excellent recipe.....a keeper for sure.

These were fantastic!  I used quick rise yeast to cut down a little on rise time.  I found that I didn't need to use all the flour.  I set the cut dough on parchment paper on a baking stone and left them in a slightly warm oven to rise.  They came off the paper easily.  I picked them up by hand and dropped them into the oil.  I didn't have any problems with them deflating or sticking as others have described.  They browned a little too much for me in the beginning, but they tasted perfect.  They cook REALLY quickly so don't get distracted while frying them! The butter flavor of the glaze was a big hit.  I made some with cinnamon sugar and they were good too, but nothing like the glazed ones. 
Thanks for an awesome donut recipe!

Scrum-dibbily-umpsious! I over-fried them at first because they floated from the beginning and I wasn't sure how long to leave them in there. I just went by color after the first few and they turned out better. The glaze was wonderful. I coated some with coco powder and some with powdered sugar. Nothing tasted better than the glaze from the recipe.

This recipe is awesome! It came out perfect- better than store bought. My son is allergic to milk and so he has never ever eaten a doughnut in his life until yesterday. I just substituted almond milk for milk and I dont think it made any difference. 
Thank you for such a great recipe.

Mmmm good!  Tricky to get the oil to the right temperature in a skillet, but once it was there (thanks to a candy thermometer!) they worked perfectly!

On my first try these came out delicious.   I do beleive that next time I will use a smaller donut cutter.  I am amazed at how delicous these where.  They are a deeper brown color, but, I believe that I can rememdy that with more quick of a turn.  These remind me of a cross between Krispy Kreme, Grandmas Fried Pies, and the swirly thing you get at the carnival.  Ill tweak these again and I bet I will be donut shop quality after a few tries!

I found this recipe more or less pretty good. It's a little too sweet, so I would cut the sugar amount a bit. The frosting ends up super buttery as well, so you may want to cut back to suit individual preference. I didn't bother to use a donut cutter and other than a couple being still doughy in the center, they turned out great... just make sure they don't get too thick when the dough rises.

I started making a  1/2 recipe to find I had 2/3 the flour I needed so subbed cake/self raising flour and only icing mixture not pure icing sugar so my glaze didn't set so crispy (added caramel coffee syrup to add flavour) but Ive only had cc's cold and these didn't last that long. It made 9 large donuts which I made the bagel cheat way - roll into a snake, cut rounds and poke a floured finger thru the middle.
 Put on greaseproof paper sprayed with oil. Used my deep fryer and whist my oil was pretty fresh, they will absorb any flavors. Made in bread machine reduced my time. Set up a process line - 2 frying, one draining on paper towel, one upside down in a bowl of glaze then onto plate - didn't put over tray. As per another reviewer had enough for 3 bread rolls did 2 bagel shape (needed bigger hole as it closed up during cooking) with sesame seeds.perfect w smoked salmon

Made 6 batches of these for a lumberman's breakfast at our local logging museum & didn't have a single one left over!  I couldn't cook them fast enough!  A man even asked if he could buy a dozen before he left.  The donuts were a big hit.  

I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg & 1/2 tsp of ground clove to make it a bit of a spice donut.  Also excellent without the spices. 

Thanks for this great recipe.

These donuts rock! I made half a batch. The dough is beautiful and easy to roll. They fry up quickly. Outside is crispy and the inside is light and delicious! We made a vanilla glaze, light chocolate glazed and a thicker chocolate glaze.

Wow, these are really good! Not too sweet, and the glaze is heavenly. This was my first try at donut making, and they turned out amazingly. I halved the recipe and the glaze just barely was enough, so I'd definitely double the glaze recipe if you are making a full batch.

These were really good!  I made a half batch and ended up with a dozen doughnuts and doughnut holes.  I did only use half the amount of butter in the glaze and it came out perfect.  My son ate 4 doughnuts himself and informed me he won't eat store bought doughnuts anymore.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!  They are like the ones grandma used to make!

Really yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly (the only thing that I did was cut it in half) and the doughnuts came out wonderfully!  My oil was a little too high when I was frying them so they were a bit darker than golden, but that was my fault!  Still tasted great, just a little but crunchier!  lol  The recipe is a little time consuming with all of the rising, but not hard at all.  I used the dough hooks on my hand mixer.  Next time I make these (and I will whenever I need that doughnut fix!) I might add some cinnamon to the dough.  I bet it'll be delicious!  : )

I don't know where I went wrong. After so many glowing reviews I really wanted to have the same results as so many reviewers. But unfortunately mine came out tasting like a bland fried bread. Not light, or creamy. They were crispy and heavy. The glaze saved them but I doubt I make them again unless I get really specific instructions. I wish I had halved or quartered the recipe for my first doughnut making attempt because it makes so much dough. Hopefully I can salvage the dough I put into the refrigerator.

My 16 year old son made these, and they turned out great!  Don't double the recipe unless you really want alot of doughnuts!  He got almost 6 dozen of them (in addition to the doughnut holes)  from a doubled recipe.

Awesome doughnuts.  We have made these several times for family gatherings and everybody loves them.  It is hard not to just leave them at home and keep them for ourselves.

I`ve made the recipe twice using my bread maker to do all the dirty work, and it worked out great. Rather then using the regular doughnut cutter I just did circles and after frying I filled then glazed for the first batch. The second batch I added raisins and they taste exactly like dutchie doughnuts. family, friends and coworkers all love them...

Thes doughnuts were wonderful fresh....not so much the next day.  But great recipe though, the taste is very similar to Krispy Kereme's (when they are fresh).

I made these for my roommates and they all LOVED them!  I don't have a doughnut cutter thing though so I just made them doughnut holes!  They were a little mishapen but they tasted great and thats the point right?  They also took FOREVER to make!  I spent at least 3 hours making them, but they were so worth it!

These are amazing.  Time consuming waiting for the dough to rise, but well worth the wait.  Delicious, chew, crispy outside.  The glaze was very delcious, and a perfect compliment to the donuts.  Great recipe!

Just FABULOUS! Made many many more than 18. Tripled the icing recipe and still ran out. Did not alter the recipe in any other way and they were perfect!

I just got done making these and they turned out very heavy and dense. Maybe I didn't let them rise long enough. The dough almost killed my hand mixer because it was SO sticky. After I finally got the dough mixed it was pretty easy to work with and I followed the directions to a T. I will try these again letting the dough rise longer and see what happens. I just wish all the effort I had to put into these would have payed off. :/

I had to give this recipe only 4 stars because they weren't as creamy on the inside, but they were delicious and NOT at all greasy.  I added a quarter cup more sugar that the recipe calls for and let them rise for quite awhile to make up for the extra sugar.  I also covered them with paper towels for the second rise and they got a nice crispy shell on the outside after being fried.  I made donuts and donut holes with the recipe and the holes came out much better than the donuts themselves.  Also for the glaze, it's better to use milk than water, and if you use vanilla, be light handed with it.  I only used a half teaspoon and that was too much vanilla for my taste!  I will definitely make these again, and now I have donut grease for my bear baiting station!  WOO HOO!

i usually make doughnuts with canned biscuits because i've always been scared to actually make the dough. i don't have a stand mixer so i thought it would be a lot of work ...but i have to say these were so easy to make and they were delicious. we took them to our neighbors and had many compliments. my husband said this recipe is a keeper for sure. thanks kelly for the awesome recipe. i will never buy canned biscuits again!!

This is a great homemade doughnut recipe! My husband and 2 year old daughter loved them so much! I cooked the holes as well and shook them in cinnamon sugar and they reminded me of these delicious made to order doughnuts served in a paper bag I had on my honeymoon. I did take another reviewers suggestion and let my bread machine do all the work... I just dumped the ingredients in and put it on dough setting...so easy! I also used butter flavored shortening. Wish they tasted as good once cooled.

OMG.... I followed this recipe to the letter and it was  fantastic. We are a millitary family and have been all over the world and tried many different kinds of desserts and pastry's but this is by far the best doughnut recipe that I have ever made. My husband and kids couldn't get enough...Thank you for sharing this recipe. We will be making this in the near future.

These are very light donuts. Not at all dense, which I was looking for. They were pretty bland and only tasted good when filled with some homemade jam. If you are looking for a blank canvas this might be a recipe that would work for you.

My husband and I absolutely fell in love with KK dougnuts the last time we've been to the US. Ever since I've been looking for a recipe that gets pretty close to KK's. That's how I found this one. I just made these doughnuts and I'm absolutely amazed! This is a great recipe. Although there were a few times when I thought I ruined the dough - they turned out perfect! I skipped the second rising because they already had the perfect "doughnut" size for me.

The first time I made donuts, I used another recipe from a cookbook and the donuts were very nice. But the problem was the dough took too long to rise. Since this recipe's got rave reviews, so I went for it. But I was quite disappointed with their texture and taste. I'll go back to the previous recipe next time.

These donuts I must say were not Krispy or Kreamy like the actual KK donuts that i love, but close to it. Next time I would omit the shortening and use butter instead. These came out nice and I enjoyed them very much. I will however try again next time with butter to see if that changes the flavor a bit. Overall 4 stars because its not like my KKs :(.

Very average tasting and nothing like the "Krispy Kreme" donuts which I believe they are referring to.  Good basic raised donut recipe.  Much like making bread.  However, after second rise, the dough is VERY soft and deflates easily so handle very gently.  I floured the back of a cookie sheet which worked OK.  (I can see when they move directly from the proofer to the hot oil in the real donut stores).  Dough will reinflate when dropped into the oil.  On the stove, I kept the oil at 325-350 (use a candy thermometer) so they don't brown too quickly.

I made these to the letter, incluiding kneeding by hand for 5 minutes, and they came out slightly stumpy and chewy. Granted it was my first time making doughtnuts (or deep frying anything). I'll try again later.

AMAZING.  I moved to a Caribbean island while pregnant and after a few months, I was wishing for donuts.  Donuts weren't available on the island so I googled a recipe and came up with this one.  It is AMAZING.  The sweetness is definitely in the glaze.  I find I have to add a little more water to it otherwise I run out of glaze before I run out of donuts.  I also find that I end up with about 3 dozen donuts, not 18; however, I use a cup and a bottle cap to cut out mine.  I'm not sure how readily available it is in the States but I like to add vanilla wit instead of vanilla extract to the glaze.  Like I said, AMAZING.  This recipe has taken our island by storm!!!!  This recipe is the reason I joined this website!

OMG!  These have to be one of the best doughnuts that I have made with my bread machine.  Only change that I made was just with the order and putting the salt in last.  Also in a bread machine only make a half recipe as they may over rise in the machine. They cook really fast so mine were a little darker than the picture but still very tasty.  I don't have a donut cutter so I just use a pizza cutter and make square and a few triangle shapes.  The disappear really fast.

This was a perfect recipe.  I made a ton of doughnuts. I enjoyed learning to make doughnuts.  My only issue is getting that nice light golden color.  My doughnuts were much darker, not the nice yellowish light brown.  Please help me get my doughnuts to look that way.

Made these in a deep fryer and they turned out perfect!  The glaze was delicious!  I had them during a luncheon with nutrition-minded woman and even they couldn't resist having just one.  Of course the kids love them too!

Halved the recipe. Used the bread machine. Perfecto! Will make numerous times again. For the glaze, we used 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar. It does remind me of Tim Horton's in Canada. Doesn't really remind me of Krispy Kreme. I'm glad it doesn't though, because Krispy Kreme tasted like I poured a cup full of sugar in my mouth. Eww! And someone made the comment that if it doesn't turn out right you either didn't follow the recipe or you shouldn't bake. I beg to differ. If it didn't work, try it again. Baking is not rocket science, practice makes perfect.

My husband said to "see if you can, please look for a raised doughnut recipe, mom use to make them and I would like to get a recipe like hers."  Well, I searched for several hours and after reading the reviews on this recipe, my husband decided to try it.  My husband sometimes cooks and bakes and I could't believe how delicious they were. This recipe is the best ever, and if anyone tries it and doesn't have a wonderful success then "you didn't follow the directions or else your just not cut out to bake". Absolutely delicious and I wish I could give them a "10"

These turned out great. The dough was a little sticky, but some extra flour solved that. I found that the doughnuts looked more doughnut like if the dough was a little thicker than what was recommended for rolling it out. My cutter was a 2 and 1/2 inch one and I bet it made 35 doughnuts easy and that was a half batch.

These are delicious.  I didn't roll and cut them.  I just punched the dough down after the first rise and tore off big pieces, rolled into a ball, and flattened into a circle.  They fried up a little dark (and looked like rolls) but tasted delicious.  My aunt and I were glad we were the only ones home so we didn't have to share!

Super amazing and delicious! The donuts aren't too sweet, but the glaze adds all the sweet you need. The dough is sticky, try to add no more than the suggested amount of flour or your donuts will be dense instead of light and fluffy. I ran out of glaze and will increase the recipe by 1/2 next time.

I have to say...I was skeptical at first to try to make doughnuts at home.  And I couldn't imagine that they would turn out really good.  But these far exceeded my expectations!  They were MAGNIFICENT!!  I made them with my two young daughters and they had a blast helping make the dough, rolling it out, cutting the shapes and decorating them.  I fried them,myself, of course!  =0) These were time-consuming, but very easy.  Well worth the time.  As per one reviewer's suggestion, I doubled the amount of glaze.  It just was not enough for the amazing amount of doughnuts!  And towards the end of the glaze, I added some cinnamon and glazed a few with the cinnamon glaze...delish!  We will definitely make these again...VERY SOON!

This is the best homemade doughnut recipe that I have had. They are light and chewy like the ones at the famous bakery, though I thought the glaze was way too sweet.  I used a bread machine to make the dough, which was a huge plus!

Snowed in for the second time in a week, my new Cuisinart Elite beckoned. I've never tried making doughnuts before, but always make my own pizza dough. This recipe produces light, airy doughnuts- every bit as good as the crispy/cremey doughnuts you buy. I followed the recipe to the letter, and they came out perfect. With no doughnut cutter on hand, I used a metal 1-cup measuring cup to cut them out ( a little larger than my biscuit cutter) , and then used an empty prescription bottle to cut out the holes- just the right size!

de-lish-ous!  Our new donut recipe (if we can plan more than 30 minutes in advance.  Might actually try to freeze the donuts after cutting them out, as this recipe yields ALOT of donuts.  We also found the best temperature on our stove-top was med-low... otherwise they get browned too fast.  This gives them a light tan color when done. Oh yeah...  Anywho... great hit... better than cutting out biscuits like we used to do.

These were very easy and the result fabulous!  I did fry at 325 degrees F.  The doughnuts were melt-in-your-mouth tender, and everyone ate more than they should have.  I used the day-old left overs to make a bread pudding....awesome!

These are terrific!  My only complaint would be the number of donuts they made, but that's because there were so many we could eat them all.  I made donut holes too!  Those were amazing as well.  Be sure to fry them until they are golden brown.  The first couple were a bit doughy.  I tried them in sugar, powdered sugar and the glaze.  The glaze was in perfect!  Thank you.

Great doughnuts!  The glaze isn't my favorite, but the doughnuts are very good.  With a little extra flour (I used bread flour), the dough was a perfect dough.

Great recipe, I like to use recipes on their own merit, bothers me a bit when people say, "good recipe, but I changed EVERYTHING"!  :)  However, I used whole wheat flour, (because it was all I had on hand) and still had great results.  If you are considering this recipe, and don't have bread baking experience, you may want to do your home work first.  Otherwise, handles well, and tastes amazing...thank you!

This recipe came out great...very simliar to kk doughnut if cooked at lower temp-300-325. They got too brown at 350. I actually burned a couple of batches towards the end b/c it was too hot. If cooked longer at lower temp they come out more "doughy" or "thick" which is how i describe kk doughnuts. The best recipe! Also, I put all ingredients in bread maker on dough and it did all the work. And, I didnt have enough white flour so i sub with whole wheat..still tasted delish!

Pretty good! I made the recipe as stated. The dough is not very flavorful. Maybe adding a touch more sugar would help. I suggest not making anymore than you can eat at one sitting. They are not very good as leftovers, too tough.

I had problems transferring the puffed doughnut forms into the fryer without them deflating.  I also felt the dough tasted a lot like the elephant ear recipe on this site but a lot puffier.

Great doughnuts! Even when I tried to bake it as rolls, it's still great. Had a soft crust. But I must make a mistake in making the glazing. It caramelized. Don't know what's wrong. But it turned to hard candy before I put the hot water. Better try again next time, but great recipe!!

I don't remember having to change anything when making this doughnut.  It was very delicious.  I cut out bunny ones for our Easter breakfast.  Made glazed and cinn/sugar ones.  Mmmm.. can't wait to make again.

I am giving this recipe 4 stars = 3 for the dough and 5 for the glaze. The glaze is right on the money.  The dough however needs tweaking.  It takes more than 5 cups flour and does need more salt and sugar in my opinion and it is alot denser.  I did not get a light and airy doughnut.  I will make again and try bread flour let it rise longer on second rise. Maybe my impatience got the better of me. Overall, worth trying and worth the effort. KK in our area closed and we can't stand Dunk D so if we have donuts I will try these again!

I had a difficult time with the glaze.  Do not make it until you are ready to use it.  I kept having to reheat it and it got hard fast.  After reheating it about 5 times it got really grainy.  Who would've thought the dough would be easier to work with than the glaze?  I didn't have a doughnut cutter (couldn't even find one in the stores) so I used my heart-shaped cookie cutters.

If I could give this 10 stars, I would. To die for good! I doubled the glaze. Next time, I am only going to cut out doughnut holes...much easier to handle in the skillet. Excellent recipe! Thank you!

These doughnuts came out pretty well for my first time making them.  I made the dough in my bread machine, but had to add almost an additional cup of flour (I used cake flour) to get it to stop sticking to the sides.  After I rolled out the dough and cut them out (I was hoping to make them custard-filled, so I just made them round with no holes), I let them rise again in a warm oven (which worked very well).  They fried up very quickly in my Fry Daddy (I was actually worried that they wouldn't be done in the middle, but they came out fine when they were golden brown outside).  I added a bit of lemon juice to the glaze, which was yummy.  I had trouble getting the custard (I used the Pastry Cream recipe from this site) into the donuts, but I think that just takes practice.  I also made a few star-shaped donuts for my little kids and they're inhaling them as I write this.  If I make these again (I don't often get donut cravings, but I am pregnant at the moment...), I'll probably make regular donut shapes or donut holes as the larger rounds came out a bit dense and cakey in the middle.  I only made a half recipe, but it made about 17 donuts (about 2/3 rounds and 2/3 stars).  I really liked the lemon glaze.

These were just ok. Certainly not a KK. They were good warm and looked pretty. The dough was bland, sort of tasted like fry bread, and definitely not sweet. The frosting helped but it wasn't our favorite frosting recipe either.

AMAZING AMAZING FREAKING AMAZING!!! Did I mention they were amazing.. I should not have made them as I am trying to loose wieght and these sitting around my house are so not helping.. They were a bit heavy but I was in a hurry to get them done so I probably didn't let them rise long enough so I'm sure if you let them raise like they are supposed to they will be even more amazing lol..Thanks for sharing this recipe it's a keeper

These are AWSOME!! I ended up adding approx. 1/2 cup additional flour so  the dough didn't  stick to the side of the bowl.The frosting had a strong butter taste to me, I will decrease the butter next time. Deffinently will be making these again. They turned out so light and airy.

These were fantastic! this is my first try on homemade doughnuts and they were a hit. I used cake flour and had to add a little extra to get it right, but worth it. I also made a second batch of chocolate glaze by adding some cocoa powder. It made twice the batch and holes!

Made half batch and my daughters loved eating them. I used half cup flour more than the recipe stated as the dough was too sticky. The icing is a must.

These doughnuts turned out great!! We loved them.  My only addition would be a pinch of salt to the glaze, it really makes it taste just like the "original".  Otherwise it's just a little too sweet.  Don't forget to fry the holes too!

light and fluffy on the inside but not sure if the temp is right, at least for me.  They browned much quicker than it seems like they should have and mine also didn't sink- they floated right away. Good flavor though. Thanks.

These were great! Fun to make and pretty tasty! I halved the recipe and there were PLENTY of donuts. We experimented by using the glaze, cinnamon/sugar, and powdered sugar...and the glaze won...big time! We did try glazed, then sprinkled with cinnamon/sugar and that was pretty tasty too. Give it a shot!

I made these doughnuts for my husband to take to work last week.  I made 4 dozen, he works with 7 men, and they were gone in a couple of hours!  They were so good my kids made me make them for desert that night!  My oldest daughter doesn't even like doughnuts and she ate them up!  Super, super, super!

Never made doughnuts before - oooh they were good! Halved the recipe and got 13 donuts and four holes from leftover dough. Let the doughnuts sit on paper towels after frying then drizzled on the glaze. Used a butter knife to slip under the dough (on a buttered baking sheet) and place in the oil since some mentioned the problem with a spatula. Seemed to work well. This was a great recipe to share with neighbors!

WOW!I just made these and am watching them disappear as i type this.The kids,(who NEVER compliment anything),actually said;these are good and you could sell these.This is without a doubt THE best doughnut recipe i have ever tried.In addition to the recipe glaze,i also used creame cheese frosting(thinned),and powdered sugar,and some chocolate syrup drizzled on top of a few.They were all GREAT.I wouldnt change a thing.Also this recipe only took 2 hrs.So if you are looking for a keeper of a doughnut recipe look no farther,this is it!!

Excellent! They taste best when the dough is left in the fridge overnight, and that way, frying is quick and you can eat them warm for breakfast. Mmm-mm!

I was really disappointed with this recipe. The dough and glaze came together perfectly, no problems there. The doughnuts looked fantastic, but severely lacked in taste. Good glaze, but the doughnuts themselves were very bland.. Please, try another recipe.

Absolutely wonderful!  Everyone loved them and only I knew how easy they were to make.
I mixed the dough in my bread machine and then rolled them out.  Tasted so yummy!!!
Thank you for sharing.

Great recipe!  I won't be going out for doughnuts again.  This recipes made WAY more than 18 doughnuts.  We got closer to 30 with some dunkin stick and some holes.  I wish I'd known to add more water earlier as the first glaze was a bit thick.  Once I figured this out they were fine.  They taste great with both the thick and thin glaze but it's much easier to work with when it's thin.

These were so good! light, fluffy, moist, and wonderful dip in the glaze. I made dozens of doughnut holes and served them with toothpicks in the center. I also made a chocolate glaze by adding some chocolate to the hot glaze.Delicious! My favorite!

These are delicious and incredibly easy.  They take time but I don't think there was much I could mess up on.  My mom cooked them while I put the glaze or cinn. sugar on them. I only rerolled the dough once and made munchkins out of the rest because the dough was starting to feel tough.

This recipe is PERFECT!  I didn't have a doughnut cutter, so I just used a floured glass to cut the circles.  My mom told me later I could have used a thimble for the holes...  oh well.  They were perfect anyway.  My only mistake was that after I cut them and was letting them rise again, I should have left them where they lay on the floured board, instead I had the (not so) genius idea of putting some of them on cookie sheets to place in my warm oven.  They rose nicely, but died when I tried to unstick them from the pan.  The ones left on the floured board turned out better than store bought.  This is also an all day affair, but so worth it in the end!  Awesome recipe!!

This is the first time I have ever made doughnuts and they were a HIT! Everyone that had them (11 people) said they were just as good if not even better than their namesake. I followed the recipe exactly and they were light and fluffy and I didn't find the dough to be sticky at all. The best thing for me though about making these was they inspired me to finally order my Kitchenaid stand mixer that I have been coveting for oh so long! Will definately make again!

Awesome recipe!  I just made one the day before from a recipe book that claims the recipe for Krispy Kreme doughnuts and it was nothing close!  But I found this recipe and WOW, pretty close to the real thing!  They puff up when fried and so light!  My family just loved them!  Since we live far from a Krispy Kreme shop, this was the next best thing!  Thank you!

These were great. They puffed up nicely and were not greasy at all. I didn't need all the flour in the recipe. The thing with flour is that you have to add it slowly. I added it 1/4 cup at a time until I had a soft but not sticky dough. I made traditional doughnuts, holes and filled. They were soft and yummy, better then any I've ever had...even better then my grandmothers. We made these for chanukka as dessert to our meal any everyone was raving about them. My husband hates doughnuts and he ate 2. I did a splash of vanilla to the icing for extra flavor. If you make filled ones they must be eaten fresh. Otherwise just reheat for about 5 seconds in the microwave. Still good but best fresh....like every other doughnut.

good, but not what I expected, which was them to taste like doughnuts. They actually tasted like one of the fry bread recipes here on this site-but with icing. 
I think I may use this as a fry bread recipe tho, but not with the icing again, just too funny tasting after it cools off, or even the next day.

HMMM... Well this is a lot of work, (very messy and time consuming) for the end result.  My 3 daughters and I didn't really think they were very good.  As a couple of other reviewers mentioned, they taste really yeasty.  I guess I should have added more sugar,or cinnamon, something for flavor!  The texture didn't seem quite right either, not as light as I thought they'd be.  Needless to say, I won't be making these again.  Sorry!

These doughnuts were amazing! Pretty easy to make considering it's a yeast dough. I did have to add some extra flour to make the dough workable, but not as much as other reviewers have said. If you add too much extra flour then the dough will become dense. I added a couple of extra tablespoons of sugar just to suit my tastes. The doughnuts did taste kind of like those signature KKs when they were fresh out of the oil and glazed, but after they had time to sit for a minute they just tasted like any other doughnut, though a really good doughnut. I fried mine at 325 degrees F and they were perfect! By the way, I halved the recipe and it still made 16 standard sized doughnuts plus about 6 donut holes.

It's not bad, although I did have to add more flour than the amount stated. The rising time takes a while, but when you start frying them, it's really quick. The recipe is a keeper! Thanks for sharing! :)

Simple recipe with fabulous results!  This was great for a college dorm girl with a craving for doughnuts and no way to satisfy it if she didn't make them herself!  Now I don't think I'll ever need to spend much more on store-bought doughnuts--these were infinitely better!

Excellent. I used rice milk and 1/2 c applesauce for the eggs (not so much vegan as my kids have milk/egg allergies) and it came out great. I also don't have a doughnut cutter so I just used a biscuit cutter. They are very light and tender. Try adding 1 tsp nutmeg like Alton Brown's recipe from Good Eats. Also, keep oil low (350-360) so doughnuts don't brown too quickly and too much.

I never made doughnuts before and these were so easy and very good.  I made the dough the day before i needed the doughnuts, let it sit for 1/2-1 hour and then cut them.  i let them rise in the fridge for abt 24 hours, then put them in the oven on a low setting for about 10 minutes.  they rose a little bit more and got even bigger in the oil.  instead of using the glaze, i filled half with jelly and half with caramel and then rolled them in powdered sugar.  I still prefer the doughnuts out of the doughnut shop, but for a homemade treat, they're great.  we were able to make about 50 medium sized doughnuts (no doughnut holes)

This recipe is FANTASTIC. I couldn't find any shortening so I used melted margarine instead. I needed tiny little donuts for a family celebration and as I couldn't find any in the shops, I thought I'd be brave and try this recipe as it had so many good reviews. Well, all I can say is that they disappeared in an instant! Make sure to fry them on a low flame otherwise they will burn...if these donuts didn't flop with me, they won't flop with anyone! Thanks for such a great recipe.

I've never made donuts before and these turned out very well.  I ended up using more flour than the recipe called for and slightly less water for the icing.  I used a brush to coat the donuts with the icing.  I left the cut donuts to rise for several hours but they wouldn't rise, so I put them in the oven at the lowest temp for about 20 minutes and that did the trick.  They were denser than I thought they'd be and I picked up on the "yeasty" taste mentioned by another reviewer.  But that's me being finicky.  Everyone else thought they were amazing.  Would definitely make again.  Be careful - they only take a few seconds to brown in the oil.

I thought these were ok. They were hard to tell when they were done, cause when looked cooked and brown, i took them out and they had raw dough in the middle. Good frosting.

I made these a couple of days ago and everyone in my family just loves them.  The only problem I had was that the dough was WAY too thick for the mixer, so I ended up just mixing most of the flour in with my hands, like I would for bread dough.  Also, maybe we just have a small donut cutter, but I ended up getting about 40 donuts (and a corresponding number of "Timbits") out of the dough.  After sampling a few, the rest fit easily into plastic containers of a dozen each, 2 of which were promptly frozen.  The donuts taste just fine after being thawed.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe - I will definitely be making these again!

Like a lot of other people stated, these are not like KK donuts. I thought these were "pretty okay," my husband thought "good." I do not think they are worth making a lot due to the time vs. the overall taste. Maybe a once a year thing or something. I followed the repice exactly and used my Kitchen Aid mixer to mix and knead the dough. I had no problems with the recipe at all. I did have problems with the donuts deflating while switching them from the waxed paper (a hint someone else gave) and I think that lead to a slightly heavier donut.

These were good...a little, "yeasty," I wonder if you can cut the yeast in 1/2 and get good results? Also, I used another cook's suggestion and made an easier (and tastier) glaze with milk, xxx sugar and a dash of vanilla. These are best if eaten the same day~ the glaze gets sticky! Definitely worth trying.

I mixed these the night before using Saf-instant yeast, mixing the dry yeast into the dry ingredients and then adding wet. It saves the whole "sponge" process. I covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated overnight, then kneaded with a little flour, cut and let raise on top of the stove while an egg dish cooked (1 hour). They received high reviews with the glaze and chocolate chips added to the same glaze recipe for chocolate glaze. Try em... great! Don't burn your fingers and make sure your candy thermomter is NOT broken!

I am rating these 5 stars because my boys and husband really liked them.  I ended up adding quite a bit more flour than was called for because the dough was so wet.  I suppose the air is a bit more humid because of the rain/snow outside.  The boys said they were much better than Dunkin Donuts and close to as good as Krispy Kreme.  They weren't as light as I was hoping.  I suppose it is because of all the additional flour.  I will know to make these on a dry day.  All in all not bad for the first time of making donuts in 10 years or so.

I was so impressed with this recipe.  It is the best I've tried.  I did have some people tell me that it is as good as "the donut" everyone raves about.  I also had a blast making them with my 13 yr old son.  He figures they should be a regular item  in our home.  I do agree that a little more sugar and definitely more glaze than is called for.

These donuts were AWESOME!  Every bit as good as Krispy Kreme when eaten hot and fresh.  Those who gave this recipe a low rating because they didn't like the donuts without icing missed the point:  these are *glazed* donuts.

I was very disappointed in the way these turned out.I had to use alot more flour than recipe called for to get the dough out of the bowl!Even my husband wouldn't eat them.I made them because of all the great reviews but I rather spend 4.oo for a box next time.

All I can say is WOW!!!! I've been using this sight for a long time, but this is the first recipe that has actually inspired me to submit a review.  I followed the recipe exactly, then ended up adding about 1/3 c extra flour.  These are great donuts!!!! (cooking temp had to be reduced to about 320)

Mmmm.... Now that this has been said, I do have a few other comments.  I had to use a lot more flour than the recipe called for in order to be able to kneed and/or take it out of the bowl.  I am living in South Korea, maybe that contributed to the dough taking twice as long as usual to rise.  I was afraid they werent going to turn out.  But after cutting them into doughnut shapes (we didn't have anything to cut holes in the middle, but this wasn't a problem at all), they rose individually without trouble.  My biggest regret is that we don't have access to powdered sugar so I couldn't make the glaze.  We used cinnamon and sugar, which was good... but it's no glaze!  These really are best right out of the pan!  There were tons and tons.  Unfortunately they didn't finish raising until 10pm, and all our neighbors were asleep!  This is a recipe to share!

These donuts are great.  Light and fluffy, and good hours later.  I made them in high humidity and hot, hot weather and they still turned out perfect.  Be careful not to roll out the dough too many times, too much added flour will make them stiff and dry.  I got more than 3 dozen, beautiful, big donuts from this recipe, twice what the original recipe said.

The recipe was pretty standard, but when made, it was a really heavy dough, and a little greasy. it took a pretty long time for the dough to double, but they turned out pretty good. make sure the oil is at a VERY high temperature for the doughnuts to get all the way done. theyre a little bland, but theyre great filled!

It's hard to rate this because there were so many great reviews about this recipe. I'm a little envious because mine turned out horrible. I live in another country so I got confused about how much yeast to use. Their packet sizes are different. I also probably kneaded it too much, but I had trouble working with the dough. I had to add a little more flour to keep it from sticking.
I'm going to keep trying it because I really want some good doughnuts that aren't so expensive.
I hate it when recipes don't turn out, but obviously this turns out really nice so I'll keep trying.

The first time I made these, I was pretty embarrassed about how they looked.  The second time, I used the bread machine and added flour
until the dough lost its stickiness.  Rolled them out, cut them, and didn't let them rise so much before frying because they become too thick with no holes.  They looked and tasted just like the real thing, but they don't keep well.

This was my first attempt at making doughnuts so I was a little nervous - but had no need to be!  

I am from Canada and everyone that has tried them says they taste exactly like Tim Horton's.

All the reviews here are right! These doughnuts really are good and wonderfully soft much to my surprise as I have not had much luck with doughnuts before. However, I found the glaze way too sweet and resorted to dipping just one side and scattering colored sprinkles on top. I also made some tossed in plain sugar. Good too. Thanks Kelly!

Loved them!  I did mix the liquids together with the yeast, added sugar and salt and let it sit, then mixed the rest.
The glaze, I did use milk in place of water.

Straightforward, easy recipe. I don't keep shortening on hand, so I subbed in butter with no problem. My dough was a bit sticky after the initial knead and rise, but using plenty of flour while rolling and cutting took care of it. The donuts puffed up nice and light while frying, and only the very last (overworked) bits of dough ended up a bit dense. I filled some with pastry cream and chose to top all of them with chocolate ganache instead of glaze.

First time I made them a couple were a little crunchy. But second time, absolutely perfect. I don't have a candy thermometer, but it didn't matter as long as they are coming in a gentle bubble for about 45 seconds to a minute for each side Ave are completely delectable! Tyvm for sharing this.

I made these for the first time, first time making donuts at all actually, and I was very pleased. First off, follow the recipe precisely, there really isn't any need to adjust. I most definitely have Sweet tooth but those that say it isn't sweet enough are crazy, once you glaze them they are more than enough sweet. If you want them sweeter than just double glaze them I guess.

Here are some tips you might find helpful:

1. Depending on the yeast you use you may have to add a 1/4 tsp of sugar to the yeast mixture to get it active and foaming. If it just looks milky after five minutes throw it out and add sugar to the next batch. Temperature matters tremendously with yeast so use a thermometer to make sure the water is around 110°F.

2. I set my oven to "warm" which is under 200°F and placed the covered dough in the oven to rise, again, temperature matters with yeast. It took about 45-60 minutes to rise enough in that warm environment, so if you leave it at room temp it could take longer. Don't rush it though, make sure the dough doubles in size.

3. I cooked the oil to 350°F and that was more than hot enough. One thing I realized is that the doughnuts will continue to cook slightly even after you remove them from the oil, as they drain the hot oil will continue to brown them just a little. I would recommend taking them out before they are "golden brown" to compensate for that. You can practice with the donut holes as I did to get it right.

4. Have fun, you're making donuts!

These were amazing! I had to work with some limitations, so I used almond milk for the milk and canola oil in place of shortening. I’m sure the oil version can’t compare to the creaminess of the shortening version, but they were light, airy and delicious. The dough was stable enough to roll out a second time so I got more than 18 donuts. Will definitely save this recipe.

I really like this recipe. I have used the dough for sweet bread and cinnamon rolls and it works like a charm. Donuts are tricky and time consuming but on a Saturday morning they are worth adding to my to-do list.

Best donut recipe ever! This is such a great recipe, tastes just like the ones at the bakery! It is light, airy and simply all you would want in a donut, no cake textures at all.

I almost messed up on the yeast, but I put the milk a little bit more to the hot side instead of lukewarm, and the dough rose PERFECTLY.

Super good I made them exactly as the recipe said but they were insanely sweet so I added some cinnamon on top and it was the best thing ever. I made this with my kids and they had a great time, it was a huge mess but worth it

A-mazing!!! My mom, who hates dougnuts, loved these! These are the best dougnuts ever! Thank's so much, Kelly. Definetly will make these again. One note: since I didn't want to use 5 cups  off flour, I changed the recipe to serve 11, since I have a family of eight. Loved this recipe, though!

Fabulous! I made the dough in my bread machine which made it so easy. The donut texture turned out so light and fluffy, perfect. For me the glaze is a bit too sweet (due to make of icing sugar I think), but my other half loves them.
Will definitely make them again, next time use lemon juice in the glaze on half and just caster sugar on the rest.
Ps didn't change the recipe at all. :)

I made these for both mini donuts and long johns and they turned out beautifully! I let the first rise go just over an hour in a proofing oven and the second rise was about 40 minutes.

I made it exactly how it says, turned out great whole family loved them. I added some maple syrup to half the glaze and left some plain all great. 
Maybe make the dough a little sweeter.
But they were still great!

This reciepe works even after I botched basically every step. But it was simple to make I was in a eish so I measured with my eye and not actual measuring utensils but still they came out good. I didn’t have a donut cutter so i made a twsited shape and I didn’t want the sugar to come through icing so I made a light glaze and dusted them with coconut. My family LOVED them.

Fantastic classic doughnuts! Exactly what you hope for when you set off to make this recipe. I ended up having to use about 2 cups of whole flour and there was no disappointment. Next time I'll probably try some fillings and cocoa dough.

Considering that I am a novice at baking and have failed many times when trying new recipes, I was super thrilled when this one turned out FAB at first try! Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It delivered what it said. The glaze was amazing too. Thanks so much Kelly!

Before I made this, I read the reviews and paid extra attention to the yeast as adviced by others. Only when I am happy with the foamy yeast did I proceed with the dough. My dough was sticky even after adding all the allocated flour. I was worried at first and pretty sure it will turn out bad because of the weird stickiness. Against my conscience, I went kamikaze and proof it anyway (to double the size). Surprisingly after letting the dough rise, the texture is bouncy and not as sticky. So I can handle the dough more easily to roll and cut it into doughnut rings.

Anyway my point is try to stick to recipe ok. It will be alright in the end.

Omgsh this is the best doughnut dough I've ever made. So light and fluffy and one of those yeast doughs that has the perfect pliable feel. Today I used the dough to make Boston Creme doughnuts! My family is in heaven. I used instant vanilla pudding mix (3/4 cup pudding mix, plus 3 cups of milk) and a chocolate doughnut glaze that is 1 cup chocolate chips, 4T butter, 1t vanilla, and 2.5T corn syrup all melted together. I cannot wait to try more variations. This is delish! Thank you so much for sharing!

These where very good. Defiantly need to double if not triple the glaze to cover all the donuts.  This is my new favorite donut recipe. My honey said he fell in love with me all over.

They turned out pretty good. However, follow the written directions more than the video, because the video said use only one packet of yeast. Also, make sure you leave it in a warm place to rise. We had to make it a second time, with 2 yeast packets and in an oven on warm. The second time the dough ballooned to twice its size like it's supposed to. Also, make sure you leave them in the fryer long enough, or else the innards will still be dough and not bread. I suggest testing it with a toothpick or cutting into a thick piece to make sure it's done.

These donuts literaly saved my life. I’ve been cooped up in an ‘educational institution’ deep in conflict plagued territory where no one speaks English. I needed something to connect me back to my all American routes after multiple days of gathering the necessary ingredients from a variety of different sources I plugged in a stove in a four by four room in the middle of the night and made these fantastic donuts. These donuts single handedly brought me and my mental state back to life. I highly recommend them.

Great recipe! I changed the recipe to make it dairy/egg/soy free because of food allergies we have.

These are seriously the best doughnuts we have ever made.  We have tried a couple recipes and they were giant flops.  This recipe is delicious and even powdered sugar if you don’t want to make the glaze.  Simply delicious.  If I could give it more than 5 stars I would.

The recipe worked great! By the way the doughnuts got better overnight. If you like cinnamon sugar doughnuts you just sprinkle the warm doughnuts in a cinnamon sugar mixture. Also, well making the glaze it thickened quickly so I had to keep adding more and more water, but i still turned out great and I had to add a cup or so extra flour to the dough well making it. The recipe also yielded more doughnuts it said it would. (30 doughnuts plus even more doughnut holes.) Great recipe and I will totally use it again! (:

This is A wonderful recipe! The only thing I did differently was add a teaspoon of sugar to the yeast and water. Yeast needs to be awakened to begin that frothing which signifies its ready to use, therefore it needs something to feed on and that's sugar. Be sure to decrease the sugar on the recipe by removing a teaspoon. This recipe is A keeper!

Like some folks, I found this not very sweet. It was a disappointment. There are things I would change - but by the time you have the expense and time of ingredients - I would rather have a more fool-proof recipe that is less than an investment of time.

So delicious! I think I added too much shortening or sugar, which weighed the dough down, but they still puffed up in fryer. Will use this recipe over and over. I used a wok. Yes, use parchment paper as they get messy with the oil and glaze.

Delicious! 1st try they came out perfectly! I accidentally doubled the yeast when I added it to the water (should be 1/2 TBS not 1) so I made a double batch. we had SO many donuts! My husband made chocolate frosting and Bavarian cream, I made the glaze, we ate them plain, we put cream cheese on them, hot, cold, fresh, left over; it didn't matter, delicious!

No Changes. Made 15 dozen for a family camp. Some double dipped, some with sprinkles and some with coconut. They were a big hit, much better than a previous but good recipe that had been used for several years.

It is a great recipe !!thank u ..it is a bit sticky as some of u said before and especially that I replaced shortening with sunflower oil as we didn't have it and my mother dislike it as well...used two env. Active dry yeast ,it turned out to be great and fluffy and even better and less sticky when I tried the rest of the dough the next day after leaving over night in the refrigerator.

This was my first time making doughnuts, and they turned out wonderfully! I put chocolate icing and sprinkles on some of them. I could eat them all day, and of course I'm making them again. If yours turned out bad, it's probably because the yeast was dead, or you used the wrong kind of yeast. Also, be careful not to burn the doughnuts. In 350 degree oil, mine only needed about 20 seconds to fry on each side.

Overall, great recipe! Everyone (myself included) thought the doughnuts were delicious.

They looked great, bit a little heavy tasting, I'm not sure if I over kneeded  the dough or if I did something else wrong, for the time it took, I think I'd rather just make a trip to my local doughnut shop

Tasted  great and seemed to make more than it indicated. Process was long but the result was well worth it.  This was my first time making doughnuts and I was really pleased with the result, as was my family and our guests. We didn't try the glaze recipe... they were even good plain.

These came out great. My kids loved them! I cut the batch in half and got 12 doughnuts and 12 holes. I made the dough in my bread machine and then after cutting them out, let them rise for 35 minutes. I didn't try the glaze, but spread on Buttercream Icing from this site instead. Great Saturday project and treat with the kids!

Very easy to make - directions are perfect.   We like glaze a bit less around my home - dipped in sugar and cinnamon - big hit over Hanukkah - good change over traditional Suvganiot.

These are light and airy, just what I was looking for. Instead of the icing I used cinnamon sugar. Yum!

Wonderful dough, it grows right in your arms! Just make sure to use warm liquids so your yeast  will start to work immediately. Easy to make, very soft and tender doughnuts.

These are so yummy! This was my first time to attempt doughnuts, and we declared them a success. I made a chocolate glaze to use rather than the one in the recipe, but that's the only change. Will definitely make these again!

Fresh the day it was made these were pretty good, and addictive. But once they got a bit older (later that day or the next morning) they tasted funny to us. The recipe makes a lot, and I didn't halve it as it was the first time I'd tried it.

Ridiculously good.  Really really ridiculously good.  And so close to the doughnuts they mean to replicate!
Will be making these again and again.  Definitely best fresh and hot. Thanks!

I made them twice within 2 weeks. They are the best doughnuts I have made so far. My husband said to me "they taste like real doughnuts"  I think he meant they taste like the one you can get in a doughnuts shop. They are easy to made and so good... my only complain would be they are too good and they don't last long... even if the recipe yeld about 30 doughnuts...

I cheated a little. Put all ingredients in the bread machine on dough cycle. Let it rise in the machine then rolled out on floured surface to 1/2" thickness. These were the absolute best doughnuts I have ever eaten. AMAZING!!! Good job with this recipe :)

This recipe is so good!  I don't know why anyone buys doughnuts when you can make them this good and eat them when they are so chewy and warm!  BTW, maple glaze is easy with Mapeilene as well as chocolate with cocoa powder.

These taste great but are VERY labor intensive.  There's nothing like a doughnut fresh out of the oil, but I just don't think these are worth the time and mess created.  I'm giving it 4 stars for taste, but it loses the one just for prep difficulty.

Second time making these, and they were pretty both times! The finished product is light and fluffy, and the glaze is to die for! We double dip the donuts in the glaze (my kids like these with a plain sugar coating, so after making approx 1/3 of the donuts sugar donuts, I have plenty of glaze left to double dip). Excellent donuts I'll be making for years. Thank you for the recipe!

I had to add two extra cups of flour to be able to knead it--it was just too moist and sticky without adding the extra flour, but theses turned out absolutely delicious!  I took some down to the neighbors and they wanted the recipe too!

My doughnuts taste so yummy.  I used brown sugar instead of white and an extra 1/2 cup of stevia sugar. The doughnuts alone are crispy and just the right amount of sweetness. I did not have powdered sugar  to make glaze, so i used brown suagr and butter for my glaze. I melted them both in the microwave and dip my doughnuts in it. DELISH!!!!!

Very good recipe. Donuts were really delicious and they didnt soak so much oil up. Only thing, it took a cup more flour to get the right texture. Thanks.

I finally found the right one, they are very good and do not absorb oil. I'm happy.

These are amazing. I recommend eating while still warm!  yummy.   I only left them in the oil for maybe 10 seconds per side.  I made without the hole in the middle, since I don't have a doughnut cutter.  I used one of those things for making hamburger patties and it worked fine.  The only trick is to cook them long enough so they aren't raw in the middle, but without burning them.

Loved it. We live in Turkey and my husband loves his doughnuts. We can only get them in Krispy Kreme branches but there's none around our place and it's too expensive. I followed this recipe and the doughnuts are perfect, delicious and they look like they've been cut out of a cook book. Thanks for it!

Delicious. We halved the recipe and ended up making them thinner than usual donuts. They were the perfect size and we had enough for everybody! However, if you half the recipe, you will still use the full amount of glaze. We actually ran out of glaze, so we made a peanut butter glaze for the rest. YUM!

My husband and I made these last night. After we had no hiccups or complications with the dough, we finally fried them up. They came out good. Our children LOVED these. My husband and I however thought they had just a tad bit to much of a bread aftertaste. Not sweet enough for us. This however was an excellent recipe to get us started. With a few adjustments I'm sure we will have a recipe we adore. Side note, it seemed that the longer they sat out while cooling after being glazed, the better we liked them. Again, a good, solid recipe to adjust to your liking, and as always, my husband and I make the recipes as stated on the first attempt.

Not light and fluffy enough.  I don't think I made a mistake because mine looked like a lot of the photos that I see with this recipe.  The doughnuts were nowhere near as good as any store-bought doughnut that I have ever had.

It makes more than it says, and tastes great! Did a double batch and with a 3" cutter I got 97 plus 80 bits. They make great bizmarks too (jam filled). Stove was on about 5 and a line....to get close to 350.

not quite the same as KK but man are they tasty! Followed the directions pretty much to a t. My husband and boys ate them as fast as I could fry them.  Did some variation on the icing but only by adding some chocolate and the donut holes I shook in a bag of sugar/cinnamon while they were still warm.  Yum! Thank you for recipe!

These were amazing!  A bit of work, but SO GOOD! The dough rolls out beautifully. 

I mixed the trim bits up with some dice spiced apple bits and cooked them up as fritters. Also super tasty!

Let me just say that even though my dough did not rise hardly at all (I think the yeast was bad…either that or I killed it), these donuts were still amazing! From the way they looked after I rolled them out, I was expecting tough, dry lumps of bread, but they came out beautiful--perfectly moist and crispy and wonderful. You can't go wrong with this recipe. 
My only regret is that I cut the batch in half thinking that 9 donuts would be enough for the 4 of us.

These were very good - the doughnuts can burn quickly so keep a close eye on them.  They also don't keep very well so you will want to watch how many you make...or eat once cooked!!

I really liked this recipe. 
But the topping was not so good so i made a topping of my own by melting dark chocolate  and spreading it on the top.
I also ejected dark chocolate into the middle of the left side the right side the front side and the back side with a cooking syringe.

Turned out to be very soft and fluffy. I did not glaze them but dusted them with sugar and cinnamon. I also tried doing the Oreo topping by first applying the the Oreo cream and then a layer of the crushed biscuit.
The small middle portion turned out to be excellent little balls once again dusted with sugar.

I loved this recipe for donuts.  I made them with my grandchidren.  We made a caramel glaze icing and it made a nice variation.  We also used fast acting yeast.  YUMMY ...  I recommend them!

Very easy recipe to follow.  Turned out awesome and even my kids sat down and wanted more.  I prepared myself and took out all my ingredients a head of time so that i could have everything right at hand.  It took me 3 hours to make but was well worth the time and effort to make them.  This is definately a recipe to make again and again!! Also a recipe to pass down to my kids when they get older and get out on their own.

These really do taste like Kristy Kreme!!! The key is not to overcook them.  This keeps them soft and moist. I also cooked them at 325 instead of 350.  I followed the recipe exactly (with the addition of a generous amount of vanilla).  The dough seems soft at first, but as you need it it firms up. These really were the best doughnuts I have ever eaten!

Not bad, easy enough to make especially if you have a bread mixer to mix and knead at the same time. And simple enough to fry. Family loved/liked I just liked them simply because I love to create and perfect things. My first try at doughnuts and it won't be my last. Good Recipe!

I just finished making these doughnuts a little bit ago. They're really delicious. Like others, I had to add more flour. I was kind of cautious about adding the flour though b/c I didn't know how they would turn out. I added about a cup extra and I could've definitely added more. The dough was still VERY sticky. 5/6 cups just doesn't seem like enough if you're really trying to achieve a dough that's not sticky. I let it raise for about an hour and it was huge! The dough raises well and the doughnuts taste great. Everyone in my family loved them and I'll definitely make them again.

This was not too difficult of a recipe, but there was a problem with the dough being too sticky. I had to add another cup of flour to make it workable, though the dough was still a bit sticky afterwards, however, at the same time I didn't want to add too much flour either. The other problem was how flavor-less these doughnuts were. Yes, they were light and fluffy but had NO taste/flavor whatsoever. I had to add cinnamon to my glaze because the doughnuts tasted like nothing. It took me about 3 1/2 hours from start to finish (I only fried about 8 doughnuts to test it out). After that I stopped because the doughnuts didn't taste like anything.  Maybe if this recipe called for nutmeg or something, it would probably end up tasting a little better. But time to keep searching for another doughnut recipe.

Made these doughnuts today, they were good but not quit Krispy Kreme quality.  The dough had a good light texture but something was lacking in the flavor of the dough.  It tasted to much like plain bread :((  Thanks for sharing!

I liked these doughnuts, but after reading the reviews, I was expecting Krispy Kremes. These doughnuts tasted like deep-fried rolls coated with sugar, which really isn't bad. Can't say if I'll make them again or not.

Tasted like bread. In fact, we decided to dunk the unglazed "donuts" in garlic butter and pizza sauce. Which was awesome_ unless of course you were hoping for a melt in your mouth light and crispy donut.

These tasted great the night that I made them, but they were a bit soggy the next morning.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and they came out perfectly.  I was a little worried when cutting the dough because it was very sticky and difficult to handle but I guess that's how it's supposed to be.  Very time consuming but I will definitely be making these again.

Made the dough in the bread maker, although next time I will do a half recipe since it over flowed when it was rising. I also do not have any sort of doughtnut maker, so I just rolled the dough into a doughnut shape and then put them in the hot oil. Worked perfectly and the icing was delicious. although I will say, mine turned out nothing like Krispy Creme, but still delicous

These donuts were perfect. I thought I killed the yeast (my milk was probably too cold still), but they still rose pretty well and fluffed up beautifully in the frier. They were light, fluffy, crispy on the outside, and the glaze was perfect. This will be my new go-to doughnut recipe!

Right out of the fryer, these were like heaven. Amazing. But, cold, a few hours later, they were still good (just not AS delightful). They're definitely better than store-bought. I don't know if they are Krispy Kreme or not -- I am going to try one of those knock-off recipes. I was actually looking for a recipe to emulate the kind of donuts made by Korean shop owners that are so numerous in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Their donuts are AMAZING. I was hoping to find something VERY light and fluffy and less spongey.

I did have to add flour to this because it was so sticky. I also had to let them rise for a very long time to double, so it ended up taking me more like 4-6 hours to go from start to finish. Also, they are not sweet alone because there is not much sugar in them -- the icing or sugar coating provides the sweetness, which is fine to me.

This made about twenty 3.5" donuts and lots more donut holes for me. I tried a larger cutter and the big donuts were not as cute as the 3" cutters.

Also, the icing should be tripled if you want to glaze all of them.

Great recipe! Made these this morning for a special Christmas Eve "breakfast". It did take a long time, but was worth it! My boys loved them. I followed the recipe (halved it, based on some of the feedback - using just one pack of yeast - and ended up with 17-18 biscuit-sized donuts). I didn't have a donut cutter, so just used a buscuit cutter. The donuts fluffed up beautifully as they fried. Added red sugar sprinkles to make them festive. My son said they were just as good - if not better than KK and DD!!

I'd give this recipe 4 1/2 stars if I could for one easily fixed reason; it lacks nutmeg. Other than that, this is exactly what a yeast doughnut should taste and feel like, in my opinion. 

 For those who think these donuts taste too "yeasty"; you need to cook them longer. They should look like a not-very-old penny, in terms of darkness.

These are so yummy!  We've tried several donut recipes from this website and this has been the constant favorite.  Fried in Spectrum organic shortening.  I also like to add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to give it more of a "homemade" flavor.

Great basic yeast dough recipe.  I proofed it in the mixing bowl, then rolled it and cut it out into doughnuts and holes.  Froze them on a sheet pan, pulled them out the next morning and let them thaw at room temp.  Fried til golden brown in 380 degree oil.  Didn't use the glaze - rolled them in sugar and served with chocolate, cream cheese, and blueberry dipping sauces.  Delicious recipe.  Thank you!!

I am on a doughnut making kick.  Bought a couple of doughnut cookbooks. Before they came in I tried these and they are THE BEST! By far...we went right by the recipe.  These have the right texture and taste.  They even freeze and thaw well! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

This recipe is fantastic! I've made this recipe a few times now and it's always a huge hit. I follow the recipe exactly each time and they are always perfect. The dough is very sticky.  A little flour on working surface and tools will get the job done. Don't make the mistake of thinking you need to add more flour. The recipe is perfect, follow it exactly and you will get there. Another poster said not sweet enough. Sugar is perfect, if you add more the texture will be denser and get dark really fast when frying. You want the donuts to be light and airy and perfect. 

 When it's cold out I let the oven warm up on the lowest setting for about ten minutes while the dough is in the mixer. Just enough to make it a little toasty in there, yeast doesn't respond as well in cooler temperatures. When dough is ready remove bowl from mixer, cover with a kitchen  towel and place in prewarmed oven to proof.  Use same method for the donuts after cutting if its cold out. If you don't have a donut cutter you can use  a wide rimmed glass and a shot glass for the donut hole. 

I love making these because not only are they delish, they make everyone so happy. These donuts will be a hit with your kds, your honey and your coworkers!

Just a little fact i learned from a professional baker (on TV) the best donuts are made from the most sticky dough. Just incase you thought you were doing it wrong if the dough was super sticky.  I made these a few times but each time they turned out different, has anyone got any tips how to keep them light and fluffy and not chewy after a few hours!?

Really good! So much work, but you are making homemade donuts, so what do you expect?! Made a lot, and the leftovers weren't that great, but they were so good when they were fresh. I didn't have enough icing so I tried thinning it out, but I still didn't have enough. I ended up melting some chocolate chips mixed with a bit of butter and then dipping some in that. I also dipped some of them in the glaze and then topped them with toasted coconut. Really good, I'm sure I'll attempt them again on a day that I have lots of energy :)

Great recipe! I used unsalted butter instead of shortening because I didn't have any and needed 6 cups of flour before the dough pulled away from the sides.  The dough is very fragile and will deflate at the slightest touch but still tastes great!

I have tried these twice and both times they came out really good. I have given 5 stars although i have have altered the directions a little. I let the dough rise twice before rolling out and cutting and then let them rise once more before frying. Lovely recipe!!!

These donuts are absolutely delicious, and very easy. My family gobbled them up. I did notice, however, that the size of this batch is rather large. It probably made around thirty donuts, which was far more than I expected.

Great recipe!  Scalding the milk is an important step.  THEN you let it cool to room temperature.  Then it won't kill the yeast.

I didnt have a way to check my temperature, so it took me a little bit to get it right, but once I did, they turned about great.  I know stove tops vary, but 4 seemed to work the best for me.  I used a small skillet and did them one at a time until I fried the holes.  I used a glass for my donut shape, and then I used a vanilla bottle lid for the hole.  I also used milk instead of water for the icing.   I am anxious to see how they hold up overnight.

My son and mother absolutely LOVE these doughnuts!! My boyfriend and I also enjoyed them, but they were a little heavy.  I will try adding a pinch more salt and maybe a little more sugar for my taste and roll them out a little thinner before frying, but I'll most definitely make them again.  They are great with pastry cream filling!!

This was my first ever attempt at a yeast recipe never mind a doughnut recipe. My son is a big Simpsons fan and has been asking for ever to make doughnuts. So today we tried it out. Being in Ireland I converted the cups to ml and grammes and went for half the measures just in case it went pearshaped. The result - 18 of the most awesome doughnuts ever ! Here's to you Kelly (and Homer too !)

These are the best doughnuts I have ever made. I have made them about 10 times now and they have always turned out fantastic. I mentor kids at my church and when I bring these I often find extra people visiting my class!

I am a novice baker and just tried this for the first time.  It came out AMAZING.  My kids and husband raved over them, stating that they tastes better than the store bought ones.  It was time consuming and created a LOT of dirty dishes but it was so worth it!  I had no problems with this recipie, although my Son is allergic to eggs so I had to use an egg replacer instead and they still turned out wonderful!

Wow, I have made these twice already and they are the best. The flavor, the texture, everything is perfect. I substitute butter for the shortening. I combine the water, butter, and milk and heat all 3 together to 115 degrees F, remove from heat and still in yeast and other ingredients as it says.

I made a slight variation on this as I was only making a small batch. They came out great! The glazing tasted amazing.   The only issue I had was that I left them in the oil too long so the outsides were slightly crispier than I'd have liked but they were still as delicious as the picture looks. I'll know for next time to leave them in the oil for a shorter period.

The dough mix was absolutely delicious... the only little issue I had was with the glaze, which came out a little lumpy instead of nice and smooth.  I'll play around with it next time until I get it right.

These had a good flavor but I don't think I added enough water because mine got really thick after doing a few donuts and hardened once it cooled. But the flavor was great.

1/2 batch made 10 donuts & 4 donut holes. If making full batch, make full glaze & full satiny glaze. Full satiny glaze for half batch too much. 1/2 glaze good for 1/2 of 1/2 batch. Heat oil on stove to 350. Heat just enough oil for donuts. Don't need whole bottle. About 30 seconds per side. Dip pretty much right away in glaze, etc. Put in dough maker in order of ingredients after proofing yeast. Cut right away and let rise for about an hour. Floured pan & cutter, wax under rack. Double glaze?

MY FAMILY LOVED THESE!!  I HALVED THE GLAZE RECIPE AND MADE HALF CHOCOLATE.  THEY ARE VERY CLOSE TO KK'S.  I ONLY GOT 15 DONUTS BUT MY DONUT CUTTER WAS THROWN AWAY ON ACCIDENT (HUSBAND BROKE HANDLE), I USED ROUND COOKIE CUTTER AND SHOT GLASS MEASURING CUP.

I couldn't give this 5 stars only because it was my very first time making doughnuts.  The first time I made them was my first time ever working with yeast.  They were delicious.  Tonight I substituted 2 cups whole wheat flour for two of the regular flour.  Turned out really good, not your typical doughnut though, they were much more heavy when finished.  I "frosted" a few of them with peanut butter mixed with the frosting and my husband was in heaven.  Because they were so much heavier the peanut butter worked well.  They'll be great for the kids for breakfast because one really fills me up!

Even with every mistake I could throw at it (yeast hates me- nothing ever rises for me, rushed the recipe, oil too hot, halved the recipe, used 2" biscuit cutter, etc) they came out PERFECT.

Yummy! I made a few different kinds out of this recipe, including lemon, strawberry and chocolate ganache filled and chocolate/vanilla glaze. They turned out pretty good, but I think I added a little too much extra flour to make it not stick as they were a little too heavy. I will try these  again!

Halfed the batch into rolls and donuts. Like the rolls much better, glaze was delicious when a thin layer was put on.  Will not make again for donuts, but maybe for rolls.

Turned out great. Not too sweet, a little dense but that may have been due to my use of bread flour. Kids absolutely loved them. Will be making these again.

Good recipe!!! I will have to make doughnuts again only had canola oil which I think made the doughnuts dark.  I used some of the dough to make cinnamon rolls.  I rolled out a rectangle of dough and coated that with some butter and sprinkled with a cinnamon and brown sugar mixture.  I rolled the dough tightly and cut it into 8 slices and placed into a well greased pan.  I let the rolls rise to double in size before baking. The rolls delicious even after being refrigerated for 2 days before being baked.

Awesome! For someone who is familiar w/ dough, this recipe is a breeze. My only advice would be to make sure you grease the pan while letting the shaped dough rise- when I took them off they tried to deflate, making the donut heavier. We also made donut holes- pure bliss!

Not a bad doughnut. Very close to the "real" thing. :) Kids loved them of course but they didn't quite match up with the flavor I was looking for...

O. M. G.!!!!  So very yummy!  Great recipe.  I will respectfully disagree with the poster who said the glaze just needs to be sugar and milk, I think the melted butter in the glaze is part of what makes these so tasty.

Very good. In my first batch, I forgot to let them rise a second time and ended up with flat cookie-like doughnuts that tasted good, but weren't exactly "right".

These were good!  I think I had my oil a little to hot b/c I couldn't keep up on flipping them before they had overly browned.  My fault though...but they still tasted great!  I only used a chocolate glaze on these and sprinkles!  Yum!

These turned out really well.  I am not an experienced bread maker so I tried these in the breadmachine.  It was so much dough that I needed to keep the lid open at the end of the rise time.  They fry up very quickly so be ready to flip them!  The glaze was amazing, perfect complement to the dough.  I will definitely make these again!

I just got a frier for my birthday and these doughnuts were the first thing off the line.  They are great...not Krispy-Kreme, but still really good with glaze or frosting.  Cook them right and they are tender on the inside and slightly crispy on the outside.

I was super excited about this recipe. I am a doughnut LOVER! So many great reviews for this recipe. Well I don't know exactly what happened here because I would not make these again. I really wanted to like them, but I couldn't. I didn't like the consistency or the flavor of the doughnut itself. And I thought the glaze tasted too much like vanilla. Not great for me, but I will continue to search for what I think the perfect doughnut recipe is.

I made this with my kids.  They had so much fun making them.  My daughter said they were the best doughnuts she ever had.  I ran out of milk so I had to use the rest of my fat free half and half and vanilla soy milk.  Yummy!

This recipe was great! I think the egg makes a huge different in the texture of the doughnut. I was looking for something a bit different though, but this is definitely a keeper.  Also, the note on the oil is dead on; mine were not greasy at all since I was sure to bring the oil up high, then lower it when just beginning to fry the doughnuts.   I did change the glaze up a bit, but only because I had shut down the computer and had forgotten to write it down before doing so.

A lot of effort! They were good, but not as good as store bought stuck in the microwave for a few seconds.  The glaze was wonderful, but the dough was a little heavy.  I also found I had to use a little more flour then the recipe called for to make the dough manageable.  I'm glad I tried it, but don't think I'll end up making them again.

We made these this past weekend and froze about half. The only trouble we had was with the oil being too hot.  I guess we DID need to use a thermometer after all!  I will definitely make them again soon, if only to keep some in the freezer.

This was the first time I have made donuts from scratch.  This was a simple and easy to follow recipe.  I used butter flavored shortening and it gave them a little extra somthing.  Wonderful!  I used a flower shaped cutter and my daughter just went crazy fot them.  What a great treat.  I will be making these again.

Kids loves these donuts!  We went to donut shop the night before and my oldest son complained that he didn't get any of them the next morning. So, I decided to try this recipe out. The kids loved them and so did I.

Okay, I must just suck at making doughnuts, 2 days ago I made "super easy doughnuts" and ended up with super easy doughnut doggy treats. This time I made this recipe hoping to pick my hurt pride off the ground. No luck here, these turn out more like malasadas only less nice, I don't know what happened, I took my time and did everything the recipe said, including the gaze. I am just not impressed with the overall result, thanks to 2 failed attempts and doughnut making, I won't be making any more for a while and my dog will have food for the next 2 weeks.

This is a very yummy recipe. I have tried many different ones and been unhappy, but this one everyone loved. Me, my husband, my kids and my brothers LOVED them. And I do not think they taste like the krispy kremes but I am very glad, I am not a big fan of krispy kremes. So these were perfect!!! A lot of work but definitly worth the time and effort!!!

Great recipe! I used buttermilk and regular milk (what I had on hand), most of a 10 lb bag of King Arthur unbleached AP flour, 8 packets of yeast (fast acting and regular). I couldn't figure out how to make 6 dozen with the calculator so I put 72 in which actually made 13 dozen and the holes! Count on someone to help cut out doughnuts (while you are paying attention to cooking)and 5 hours from start to finish (including rising time)and a lot of table and counter space, and a cast iron dutch oven with a thermometer (see my photos by clicking on the recipe photo)!

These are so good!  I wouldn't say they are comparable to the chain-version; although my husband says that these are a hundred times better!  These have more "substance" than those do.  They really take care of that doughnut craving we get occassionally since we don't have access to doughnuts here in Serbia.  They are really "rich", though and I don't know how anyone could eat more than two at one time!!  Great!  Thank you for these!

OH MY GOD!!!!! Just finished making these and by far the best recipe I ever made. Was worried about the dough being sticky but it turned out perfect. I did as the other person had said and made doughnut holes out of the cutouts, this recipe is light and crispy and just the right sweetness. Thank you for a great recipe!!!!

This recipe was nothing at all like KK donunts. I didn't like the glaze either. I agree with other posters about the texture, it was bland without the glaze and then the glaze was terrible. It took a lot of time and was extremely disappointing. I agree that you can get canned biscuits and they would taste way better.

Very Good! I made these the night before hoping to have donuts for breakfast. They didn't last that long. I did manage to save some but were not as good when fresh and still warm. I think because we have high humidity were we live. These are the best donuts it is worth the effort.

This is a great recipe. The taste is light and fluffy but not like Krispy Kreme. The yeast flavor was a little over powering too me. It was kind of like a light & fluffy fried yeast roll in a glaze. Anyway, my family loved them & they came out picture perfect. I ran out of glaze & had to make more. Next time I will double the glaze.

Not so sure about these. They look really nice, but the taste just isn't there.  Hmmm.  I think they need to be sweeter before the glaze.

These were pretty good, but not to the same degree as the restaurant chain's. I will try it one more time before moving on. Still, good homemade doughnuts.

I tried this recipe yesterday and WOW!! It's the best yeast doughnut recipe I've ever tried and there has been many. I  cut the recipe in half and made the dough in my bread machine. It was the fluffiest, prettiest dough I've ever seen! I made donut holes instead of donuts, more fun to pop them in your mouth that way! YUMMERS! I bet this dough would make delicious cinnamon rolls too! This will be a treasured recipe for sure. Thanks for sharing it.

Fantastic doughnuts!!  I filled a few with cherry preserves (works well if you like whole cherries!), and they were the best filled doughnuts I've ever tasted.  The recipe was easy, the texture was perfect, and the flavor was so good!  The glaze was great, too--very adjustable for dipping or spreading.  Thank you for an awesome recipe!

I shocked my husband with how wonderful these tasted. 

They are the BEST homemade doughnuts and do not taste homemade!

This is the best homemade doughnut recipe I have ever had. The best part is that they dont taste homemade. They taste like doughnut shop doughnuts!! My family loved these. My mother-in-law ate 5 in a row!! Thank you so much for sharing this awsome recipe!!

Yum yum, the bomb, the best, couldn't praise these enough- we don't have a Krispy Kreme where we moved, so sad, but these are sooooo good it doesn't matter. It is a lot more work than driving to the shop, but the satisfaction of making them yourself so well makes up the difference!

I've made donuts a few times before trying this recipe and none of them compared. Instead of the usual donut shape I left them whole and filled them with blackberry jam. I made them for a party and people said they tasted like store-bought donuts. Very good recipe.

This were fingerlicking god. This was my first try at making doughnuts and what a great recipe. I made 1/2 batch - half doughnuts and half holes and they are disappearing fast.

I've never made anything with yeast and this turned out great.  My only problem was that my yeast never looked "foamy" after sitting in the water.  (Tried several times and made sure water was exact temp.) So, I just went for it and it worked!  Super yummy and easy to eat lots.  I actually thought mine tasted BETTER than that place we all love to go. I made the dough one day and due to cirumstances beyond my control (I have an infant, toddler and a pre-schooler) I wassn't able to cook them.  I covered with plastic wrap and put in the fridge and it STILL worked out.  Now we have so much dough still left I put it back in the fridge again and will be giving the rest of the dough to my friend tomorrow.

This was my first try at doughnut making...and it was great! It was a bit time consuming, with letting the dough rise twice, but otherwise very easy. Couldn't find a doughnut cutter, so I just used a round cookie cutter...fried them in our deep fryer and filled half of them with frosting. I did substitute vanilla soymilk for the milk and you would never know it! Everyone loved them...there were no leftovers!

I have made several doughnut recipes and this one is the best.  The doughnuts are fabulous.  I added cinnamon syrup to the glaze and a little instant coffee and it was delicious.

These donuts are absolutely awesome! This was my very first time making donuts and these are super easy!  They really do taste like that chain donuts, although slightly heavier. Still the glaze is absolutely fantastic. We also used powedered sugar with pumpkin pie spice mixed in. It went really well with warm apple cider.  I will be making these again!

These were DELICIOUS!  The best we have ever made.  They are light and fluffy just like you would buy at the bakery but even better because they are homemade and richer.  We did half of them with the delicious buttery glaze and half just rolled in sugar. This will be the recipe I pass on to my children.

I made these for the first time yesterday and they turned out FABULOUS!  The name "crispy and creamy" is right on.  Best donut recipie I've ever tried, and wasn't difficult at all.  When fresh, it puts any commercially made donut to shame.

I should have looked for a donut recipe here a long time ago!  Light and fluffy, glaze them while warm and they melt in your mouth.  My picky parents were visiting and they couldn't believe I made them myself. Highly recommend using Best For Bread Flour though.  Thank you.

OH MY!  Worth the mess!!  I used quick rise yeast in the recipe with no problems.  Make sure that you do the glaze at the last minute.  Mine started to cool and it was fairly thick by the time I was able to dunk the doughnuts.  They aren't Krispy Kreme (belch) the are more the LaMars.  OOHH soo good!  These are really awesome with the Satiny Chocolate Glaze found on this site as well.  Will make them over again!

While these are not as airy and light as Krispy Kreme ( I think they may use potato flour in theirs) these are still very good homemade donuts and fun to make with kids. My 5 yr old sonand 15 yr old daughter enjoyed dipping these in chocolate glaze and adding sprinkles on top. I made the dough the night before and it rose in the fridge perfectly. I then rolled out the dough, cut the donuts and let them rise about 30 mins before deep frying them. These tasted good but I give them 5 stars for the fun the kids have making them.

Very good for my first attempt at making homemade donuts.  Very tasty and better than anything to come out of a shoppe.  I sugared some and made a chocolate glaze for some.

There was nothing bad about this recipe. It was all good. My man was so overwhelmed he got on his knees and officially proposed. It was touching. I will always remember this recipe. I would love to try to make filling for these and experiment with different frostings yet the glaze comes out perfect.

Oh my! There doughnuts are great! I'm not fully confident baking with yeast yet, but these were a snap. I can't beleive I made them. I even brought them over to the neighbours for them to try. I will be making these again when my mother-in-law comes for sure!!

This is a good doughnut recipe.... my first.... I need some more practice in my doughnut making (making them more uniform size etc.) and frying them better (came out almost perfect but some a little too dark and some uneven) that being said it was (the recipe) a good jumping off point.... yeast doughnuts are my favorite! :)

I loved these doughnuts, they were awesome!  I can only give it 4 stars though because they didn't taste nearly the same the next day.  You have to use the glaze because otherwise they are quite bland.  They took a lot of time to make but it was worth it and I will definitely make them again!!

These were edible but certainly not close to krispy kreme doughnuts.  We din't even finish frying all of the dough.  Even my kids didn't ask for seconds.  In our opinion, the doughnut wasn't sweet enough although the glaze was pretty good.  For the time and effort involved, and because of how infrequently we eat doghnuts we'll just keep going to pick up the real thing.  It was fun trying though.

These doughnuts are as close to the real KK's as I've ever had.  Although they are heavier.  KK's are soooo light and airy.  These were addictive!

I live in Australia so it was hard to follow the measurements correctly especially with the yeast so I guess it was no surprise that my doughnuts did not turn out as well as everybody said it would. I also totally agree with the fact that these doughnuts do not keep well and turn stale once they are cold.

My family has requested them since we live overseas from the states, and they DON'T have doughnuts here... but I realllly don't enjoy making these. It's so tricky to get them to puff up when  getting them into the oil.

IT's a waste of time.  I guess the oil temperature is the key to great donut.  My batch turned out to be donut pockets (big hollow inside) and the texture is little on the dry side. I probably won't experiment again, stick with Krispy Kreme donut.

Pretty decent for homemade, but definitely not professional quality, even if you follow the recipe to a "T". The doughnuts don't keep very well, and will be pretty stale within twelve hours, even when kept in an airtight container. But while they're hot, they're pretty tasty.

This recipe really wasn't worth all the time you have to put into it. These doughnuts were okay when they were hot, but it went downhill from there. They were hard by that night. I don't think I'll be making homemade doughnuts again, especially when you can get a dozen in my town for $3.88.

This is a good raised doughnut recipe, but not extraordinary.  I didn't think mine turned out too much like Krispy Kreme's.  Next time I will stick with my favorite spudnut recipe.

These were good, not the kind of doughnut I was personally looking for, they are very light....was looking for something a little cakier. But, they were tastey and easy.
