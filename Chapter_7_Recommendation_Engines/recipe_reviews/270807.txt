2.27.19 Like the recipe submitter, I also was introduced to Skryr when visiting Iceland several years ago.  We rented a house in Selfoss, and the owner was gracious enough to stock the fridge with six containers.  I’m a yogurt lover, and Icelandic yogurt (like Sigg’s) is tangier than I think most of us in the U.S. are accustomed to.  I typically don’t like a lot of sweetness in anything these days, but I would probably add a couple more tablespoons of brown sugar next time to compensate for the yogurt's tanginess.  Gotta tell ya, the muffin batter was really thick, I was worried I was crushing the blueberries when folding them in, and was concerned  about how they would turn out.  I almost added a little milk, but I stayed true to the recipe, and made no changes.  Well,  they baked up into big, beautiful blueberry muffins, tender, and moist with a pop of blueberry in just about every bite.  Very nice way to start the day!

Delicious!!! I will definitely be making these muffins again and again.  The blueberry skyr and lemon zest take these muffins to the next level.  The batter was very thick (almost dough-like). I was worried that I had done something wrong, but they turned out moist and fluffy.  They are absolutely bursting with blueberries!

Mousie's family is Icelandic, so using Skyr was a no-brainer. Nice recipe - thanks!  BTW, it's pronounced "skeer."  Added bonus - I use Skyr in frozen yogurt, as well.
