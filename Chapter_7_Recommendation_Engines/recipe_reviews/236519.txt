I love the reddish purple color!  The taste is wonderful!  This was easy to make, so I'll be making these again!

These look great, especially next to some sauteed beet greens. The colors look appealing to people who don't like the look of regular deviled eggs. When I make this again, I'll add a chopped dill pickle.  This is an easy dish that looks really cool. Thanks!

i made it exactly the same. but i didn't use the beet because i don't like it. but, overall it's quite an interesting recipe to try and a very simple yet delicate one too.

I used the ingredient search to find a recipe with beets and eggs to fit the whole 30 diet. This one was perfect. I used less mayo, but otherwise followed the recipe. You end up with too much stuffing, but I just ate it with a fork. Yum
