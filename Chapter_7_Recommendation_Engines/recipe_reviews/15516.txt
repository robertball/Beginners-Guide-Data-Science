This cheese ball was originally served at a holiday get together I attended.  I had to have the recipe....  Substituting Pecans for the walnuts adds a slightly different flavor to the ball.  Also, the ball was very creamy and I found that shaping the "ball" into a log easier for serving.  Very good with butter-type crackers.

I had this recipe at a wedding reception and just had to have it! I drain the pineapple juice -- makes it firmer and not as sweet. My seasoning salt is: 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp Mrs. Dash, and 1-2 tsp garlic and parsley salt. I also don't make a "ball" but more a log shape as another reviewer wrote.

Serbved this at a party recently and it went over very big.  I substituted chopped pecans for the walnuts. It is much easier to handle if you make sure to drain the juice from the can of crushed pineapple.

My crowd loves cheese balls during the holiday parties. I love trying all the different variations. This one is very good. I would recommend toasting the walnuts, though.This is a sweet/savory version of an old standby.Thank you, Linda.

This has been my favorite cheese ball for years.  I made it again today leaving out the green pepper and using two 8 oz. pkgs. of cream cheese rather than three (as I always do).  Drain the pineapple very well.  I toss  a BIG handful of nuts into the cheese mixture and also roll it in the nuts.  Serve with Wheat Thin crackers.  Very good!!

At first glance I was somewhat skeptical of this recipe, along with only the three reviews even though they are positive. I decided to try it at a stagette right before Christmas and it was a hit! It was enjoyed by all.

Well its Christmas Eve and the whole cheese ball is gone!! Now I have to spend tomorrow making copies of this recipe. I also added sundried tomatoes that were in olive oil but I blotted the oil with a paper towel after chopping. Do drain the pineapple or it will be to wet. I even forgot to roll it in nuts and it still diappeared. Plus some people are allergic or just don't like nuts. They weren't missed.

I cut the seasoning salt in half and didn't use the pineapple juice, and thought the taste and consistency was much better that way.  Very good for a "light" cheese ball, especially if low fat or fat free cream cheese is used.

not bad, but not as good as i had anticipated.  It looked good (that's why it has 3 stars rather than just 2).  The flavour was just a little odd.  Probably won't make it again.

I am not a cheeseball fan at all, but a neighbor brought this over as a little Christmas gift. I tasted it just to be polite, and I was so WOWed by it! Not a strong flavor like I was expecting, so that was a big plus for me.
I don't like peppers so I omit that, and she did not add them to the dish she brought me. And definitely drain the pineapple, or it's just too mushy.

Overall, this was a good dip.  However, I found it to be a bit to sweet for my taste.

My family enjoyed this cheese ball. The only alteration I would make to this recipe the next time around is to not add the whole can of pineapple juice as I think it would turn out a bit firmer with a bit less juice. This is definitely a large enough cheese ball for a party or a potluck!

Very good. Made it as written except I accidently forgot the green pepper (which I don't care for anyway); it was still very good. I would make it again.

I've made this recipe for the last couple of years and, I haven't had any left.  I do dice a little tomato into it. It gives it a little more flavor and color and, can be festive for the holidays.

This was pretty good.  I used red onion since I didn't have any green onion on hand and it worked fine. Family and company seemed to enjoy it as well.

Perfect cheese ball for any occasion. My husband requested it after having it at a party years ago. I was skeptical when he said pineapple. I may, or may not, have laughed :) the skeptic loved the cheese ball. So did the kids! 2-12, each ate it right up.

I got this recipe over 20 years ago off a package of cream cheese, it has been a favorite of my family ever since.
A few adjustments to try... use 2 blocks of cream cheese, one medium chopped pepper, a full can of crushed pineapple well drained and about 3 tablespoons of lawreys seasoned salt. I omit the onion and nuts. still delicious!!!!!

Pretty tasty and easy to prepare. Definiately toast the walnuts for added dimension. I also made one with pecans and liked it as well.

This is a favorite Thanksgiving appetizer at our house. I modify it though. As written I give it a 3.  The kids love it even with fresh pressed garlic added.  Drain the pineapple, squeeze out the excess juice and double it; otherwise the cheese ball is too wet. Give the kids the juice to drink or put it in a cocktail. Add a dash or two of Worcestershire sauce.  Put 1-2 cloves of garlic through a press and add them - use 1 the first time you make it. We love fresh garlic. Use 1/2 red bell pepper and 1/2 green bell pepper instead of just green.  Line a right  sized bowl with plastic wrap and wind it tight before chilling. Forty-five minutes before serving toss the whole thing in the freezer to firm it  up for 30 - 40 minutes and then roll in the pecans instead of walnuts, pressing them in well for a nice solid even coating. Plate and have plenty of crackers handy.

Simple and easy. Not over powering. A nice change from the cheese ball. Kind of hard and messy to roll into a ball. I think the walnuts are a little too strong a nut for this recipe. I used crushed almonds instead.

Three packages of cream cheese were too much for me. I recommend draining the pineapple
