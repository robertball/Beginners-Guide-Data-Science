I made this and loved it! Can't wait to try it on my picky husband! I tried different toppings, butter, yogurt, honey...but sour cream was definitely the best! I plan to grate and freeze lots of butternut so I can have this all year round.

What to do with the butternut squash sitting on the counter. Not sure why I bought it in the first place. Soup, nah. The husband likes potato pancakes, maybe I can get away with this. I grated the onion in the bowl with the rest of the ingredients (lazy me), doubled the spice, and added a splash of mustard oil. The texture was smoother than latkes, and the taste of course was Indian appetizer. I served it with yogurt and lime pickle. Initially he was reserved in his praise, probably due to the dreaded squash ingredient. After a few bites he was a convert. Final ruling: "That's a winner."

My husband and I loved this recipe.  Next time we'll add a little more pepper and curry.  I didn't have corn flour so used coconut flour instead.  Very good!

I just used regular flour and these turned out great.  Everyone enjoyed them.  Great way to get another veggie into a meal

Good taste, although I like things spicier!  I served these with hot pepper sauce!  This needed 2 medium eggs to moisten up the mixture since I didn't have a large one.  I omitted the oil, and used a light coating of vegetable spray when cooking the onions as well as frying the cakes.  I'll be making these again!

Great!  we had the sour cream for the garnish, but everyone ate them down and went back for more without ever touching it. Definitely being added as a family favorite.

this was great...  definitely glad i put the squash into a colander and pressed all the extra liquid out!.  I also added a glove of minced garlic, a tbsp of lemon juice and a grated carrot...  Next time, I may add a lil turmeric and coriander... but I'll definitely be making this again.

This was a great addition replacing the starch from our plate.  I did substitute some ingredients, Chili powder (1 TBSP)for the curry, Coconut flour for the corn, and I needed two eggs for the batter to stick.  Very tasty, everyone at the table liked it and requests it again.  Will be great for breakfast too!  My son said it was like hash-browns.  Thanks - would never have thought to do this with squash.

While peeling and later grating this squash, I was thinking it wasn't worth the trouble, but the rest of the recipe is super easy, and the result was delicious.  I will definitely make again.  For those who want to use regular white flour, just replace the 1/4 c garbanzo-fava bean flour for white or whole wheat flour.  I used cornmeal in place of the corn flour.

This was delicious! I added potatoes because I had a very small squash, and I used blue corn flour (atole), which I had fresh from the CSA. This was just the right balance of sweet and savory, and it was very easy to put together--a definite keeper!

Everyone in my house loved these! I substituted the bean flour for almond flour bc it was all i had. I think next time I will add some minced garlic to the onions. Such a good recipe!

absolutely delicious, but I think a bit too mushy. I recommend wringing out a bit of moisture from the squash before cooking.

I loved this recipe.  I used acorn squash fresh out of the garden.  Instead of onion I used minced garlic that I sautéed until it was brown and added a little white wine and cooked till it reduced by half.  Let is cool before adding to mixture.  Used regular flour.  When I cooked them I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil each time I prepared the skillet.  These were delicious!!!!!

These were super easy to make and were delicious! The cumin/curry seasoning wasn't overwhelming. It was the perfect season to balance the naturally sweet butternut. I added a bit more garbanzo. Sort of eyeballed it. Added enough that it looked wet but was able to hold together when fried. I used a large non-stick skillet with a 1/4 inch of oil. Then grabbed the cakes in a ball and dropped them in using a spatula to spread them out so they cooked faster. Flipped when golden brown, then pushed them down gently for even cook. SO GOOD. Will definitely put in the rotation!

Loved this recipe! We picked 200 lbs of butternut squash from our garden and I have been anxiously trying to figure out what to do with all of them. I doubled the recipe for the 3 of us, used regular flour and corn meal instead, and also used 1 tablespoon of curry instead of 1 teaspoon. It was fun to make and was delicious. Highly recommend using a food processor. Can't imagine hand grating the squash.

I really enjoyed eating these! I added a bit more curry powder to mine, and I plan to try them topped with a little raita instead of sour cream next time.

My husband loved them, my very picky son (who only eats pizza)surprised me by finishing his plate.  Anything that is healthy and my son finishes deserves 6 stars.  I could not find the garbanzo flour so I substituted it with some durum weat semolina flour.  My son ate his with ketchup.  Next time I will try to get the butternut pre cut cause that was a pain to cut and grate.  I would also double the recipe.  I only got to have one :-(

Tons of grated butternut squash left over. While I did freeze it as he suggested, it would have been more useful in chunk form.

Grating the butternut squash took a VERY long time. Will try cubing and blending the ingredients together next time. MIL had a large butternut squash crop, so this recipe was a welcome addition to the typical squash recipe. Served with sour cream, pesto, and roasted butternut squash seeds tossed in ginger.

I used regular flour and cornmeal like a few others since I didn't have the specific versions named.  I also omitted the onion since I can't stand them.  They were a lot of work, with all the grating, and in my opinion, not worth it for the flavor.  My husband heard me grunting away with the grater and came to the rescue and finished the grating for me.  While they tasted fine, they didn't wow me, though my husband and dad both said how much they liked them.  I think I'd make them again if they were easy, but because I can think of easier ways to make butternut squash that I like, I would shy away from this  one due to the effort.

I'm still making them-It's taken me 90 minutes total so far. I had to leave the house and when I come back I will put them in the oven. I don't get how these would take 50 minutes total. Anyway, I fried 2 and I will bake the rest later. I used regular flour too.

Taste was good but it did need more spices as stated by other reviews.  I'm not a big fan of curry so I'll need to replace that spice with another.

I won't be making this again. The flavours just aren't there and the texture isn't palatable. The kids wouldn't eat it.... even the one who loves curry and eats anything. Husband like it ok, I ate it because I didn't want to waste food.

Perfect autumnal appetizer or side dish!  I followed the recipe exactly- except that I fried my cakes in coconut oil for some sweetness, and it was delicious.

I cut back on both flours and forgot the egg and this was still delicious! Curry goes really nicely with the squash.

Four stars only because this is a very labor intensive recipe.  But the seasoning is very good, and I'll make them again - when I have time!

Easy and delicious. Hardest part was grating the squash, which wasn't very hard. Followed the recipe almost exactly, except I used gluten-free all-purpose flour. Turned out great. My son, not a huge fan of squash, gave his approval.

I loved another great use for BNS and gluten free at that! I thought it needed more flavor to offset the bitter. I did not serve it with sour cream or honey (which may have addressed this.) Easy and fast.

I will make this again! I used regular flour and corn meal as that is what I had on hand. I warmed the squash in the oven before cutting as that is so much easier. I used a vegetable peeler to 'grate' it, so it isn't as fine a grating as the recipe calls for, but it doesn't affect the patty making or the taste. Probably heating the squash ahead of time (30-40 min.) took care of the extra liquid that was mentioned by some reviewers. It was easy to form, and I fried the patties in coconut oil. I tried both the plain yogurt and the sour cream as a garnish and cooked the squash seeds to put on top. Both garnishes are good, but since the yogurt has less calories, I'll probably continue using that.

The curry is a strong aroma if you don't like it. I used it as the recipe called for it but I will probably leave it out next time. I added garlic to the batter before frying and it was really good.

I didn't have anything but regular all purpose flour so I used that. And I just had some roasted butternut squash left over so I used that.  It was great! Thanks.

I thought these were pretty tasty!  I used regular flour and next time I could cut the curry in half.
The sour cream and pumpkin seeds are a must!

These were wonderful! I used 1 tbsp red curry paste near the end of sautéing the onions because that is what I had on hand. We love latkes and these fit the bill without the carbs. I cooked the cakes in coconut oil and it didn't effect the taste. My husband could not believe these weren't simply revved up potato pancakes. He thought that he didn't like squash. A real winner.

This is really good - I love the curry with the squash, really gives the squash a sweet taste.  Since I grow this squash in my garden every year it's good to have recipes like this.  I'd just finished making Chef John's hand pies(apple turnovers)so I used the left over egg wash for the egg in this recipe.  So thanks Chef John.  Ps. the hand pies look delicious too! JIM

I'm new at this and these were amazing. I used red's gluten/dairy free pancake mix and it worked just fine. Relatively easy and super yummy. My 3 year old and I ate these up like it was our job. Nice one Chef John!

I tried this recipe today....YUM! I told my daughter who hates butternut squash it was potato and she gobbled it up. I didn't have any cumin on hand, so I added a bit more curry. I also saute a garlic clove with the onion. Def a keeper!

This is easy to make and taste great. This would be good to serve with breakfast in place of hash browns.
