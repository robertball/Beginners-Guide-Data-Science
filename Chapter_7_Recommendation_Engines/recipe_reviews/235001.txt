I like my sauce thicker and less "chunky" but overall was easy to prepare and my kids liked the meatballs.  I left out the raisins - it seemed like an odd addition to me but what do I know? I think we'll probably make again but add in tomato paste instead of one of the cans of diced tomatoes and go heavier on the spices (again, personal preference - I like a more flavorful sauce.  This recipe is more likely to appeal to more people though).

So far so amazing! I only omitted the raisins and it turned out great. I made my BALLS larger than recommended (no pun intended lol) and used my own sauce and it turned out great.
