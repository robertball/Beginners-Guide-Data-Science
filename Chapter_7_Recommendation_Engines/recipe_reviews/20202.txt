I'm not a fan of any beer, but this drink is delicious, a perfect balance of flavors.

My suggestion is don't make substitutions.  I tried making this with diet coke and I didn't have vodka so I thought whiskey would be ok.  It wasn't.  But the stout and the Khula were good together.

I only did one jigger of vodka because I wanted to remember the rest of my night. I wasn't a fan of the beer in this, it would be a lot better without it.
