I would have liked this better without the pre packaged stuffing It gave it a stove top taste all the other ingredients were great I still prefer a cornbread only stuffing isn't it interesting how many different styles of stuffing there are around the country??? I will try this again making some adjustments on the breading thanx!!!!
