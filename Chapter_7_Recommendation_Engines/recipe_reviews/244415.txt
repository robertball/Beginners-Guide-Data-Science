Great dip... next time I would use onion powder instead as the raw onion was a bit much for me

Even my non-broccoli eating husband ate a ton of this! I swapped lime juice for the lemon juice and used onion powder instead of raw onion. Only other suggestion, next time I will increase chili powder a bit. Everyone loved it, but all agreed it could use a little more kick. I will definitely make this again!

This is one of the most delicious things I have ever made myself. I can't wait to make this for my family this holiday season.

I made this exactly as written and it was so good.  Even my children liked it.  They like guacamole too but said this was better.  Will definitely be making again.

very nice - I might go a little spicier next time. Several people complimented me on it and I told them to come here for the recipe.
