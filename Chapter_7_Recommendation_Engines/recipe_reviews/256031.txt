Made this last night. It was great but next time I would use a smaller dish.

I Used freshly picked Oregon black berries. I would cut back on the sugar next time maybe to 1  1/2  or 1 1/4. My family loved it!

I scaled this to 6 servings, and used a 9" deep dish pie plate. Other than that, I followed the recipe to a "T". Very tasty cobbler. I served this warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Yum!
