I have to admit my expectations were pretty low for this recipe despite the reviews.  It just sounded kind of strange and I didn't think it would turn out with a nice consitency with no milk, cream, sour cream, etc.  I was very wrong and the reviews were right.  I don't usually make mashed potatoes because they are trouble.  This recipe is super simple.  No peeling potatoes, no guessing how much milk to add, no endless mashing with lumps remaining.  This came together like magic.  Just boil, drain, and mash with butter and cheese.  A great addition to my recipe box and a terrific way to use up fresh produce at the end of the week!  Boiling the garlic with the potatoes is genius as well.  Try this even if you are skeptical.  You won't be disappointed!

Wow! You definitely need a "Cowboy's" appetite for these mashed potatoes! Who would have thought of adding veggies to this comfort food classic and have it taste so good?  I have to admit I was a bit skeptical, because I really do like my mashed potatoes with just the basics but this really did turn out to be a nice surprise.  So, if you're looking for something different as a side dish for dinner tonight - look no further. Give this a try, you'll be glad you did!

Why didn't I think of this one before??  I got carrots, corn, and peas into my kids with nary a whimper or whine, plus some calcium and protein with the cheese.   All I had to say was 'COWBOY' to my two little boys, and they ate two helpings!  (The big boy had 3..)  Delicious!  This one will be making an appearance on our table OFTEN!

This makes such a good side dish because you can add or take away what veggies you like..(a good way to get the kiddos to eat them too!!)  For those of you who found this to be a little on the dry side...try adding some cream cheese or sour cream.  This usually keeeps the potatoes "silky".  Thanks for the fun new twist on potatoes Bruticus.

I omitted the pepper as I was serving this with Herbed Pork Chops in Mushroom Sauce, I didn't think it would go well together. I used all red potatoes as that was what was on sale today and added more cheese, and a 1/4 c. hot milk to loosen the mash up a little. (It was quite thick.) I liked these, my family was indifferent. I don't think they liked corn in their potatoes. I'd like to try this again with Mexi Corn and the jalapenos.

Great new way to spice up mashed potatoes. Served with our pork chop meal tonight and was enjoyed by all.  I used 1/2 green bell pepper, which I added to the boiling potatoes about 5 minutes before they were done. Once it came time to mash, used a little more butter than called for, added a can of drained green chiles, yellow/sweet corn instead of white and a little more cheese. The result? Great!! Will make these again! Very colorful too! Makes the whole table look "pretty."

It's so simple, I'm almost embarrased I didn't think of it.  I added WAY more garlic, and had to omit the corn because I was out (will definitely add it next time).  Used real butter, but only about 3 tablespoons, plus about 1/3 cup milk and sharp cheddar.  My kids and husband loved it!  Boy, I sure did too!  This will be a regular on our dinner table.  (And, the name DOES help with preschoolers.)

Absolutely fabulous! The only change I made was to add in some green peas. Will definitely make this one again. Thanks for sharing, Bruticus. :)

Boy did my family love these. We are potato freaks anyways. This just brought it up a notch. I added lots more garlic as we love that too. Other than that made them just the way the recipe called for. I did double the recipe and they made great potato cakes on the grill the next morning.

I made this this first time pretty close to what's written only all I had was yukon gold potatoes and I left out the jalapeno peppers. It came out excellent and everyone loved it! I have made it many times since. I usually just make my mashed potatoes as I normally would (yukon gold potatoes, butter, milk, sour cream and seasoned salt) except I also boil the carrots (and if I remember) garlic. I use what ever cheese I have on hand (usually a mexican blend) and a can of drained corn. I use an electric mixer and blend as much as a I like. I find it a lot easier than a hand masher. Anyway, my husband prefers these over regular mashed potatoes and my 2 year old also likes it. It is now on our regular weekly menu. Thanks so much for the recipe!

Very good!  I used gold, red, and purple potatoes, so it wasn't that appealing to the eye, but it sure tasted great!  I loved the carrots and corn- all of those things go great together anyway.  We had this with Rosemary Roasted Chicken for New Year's day.

I have made these a few times & my husband loves them! He came home from work last night & saw the big pot of "stuff" boiling on the stove. Once I told him what it was going to be, he gave me a big hug. It is a really cleaver idea & so easy to make! We love garlic so I may add alittle extra next time, but didn't change much else. I could see this being a great recipe for kids. Thanks for the recipe!

These were really good. I used Idaho russets, canned corn, frozen diced carrots, and cheddar-jack cheese. I would even add a little crispy bacon and more jalapeno next time.

I'm really surprised at how well my family loved this recipe.  I couldn't imagine how it would taste, but it came together really well.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated, except I used all red potatoes, because that's what I had.  Next time I make it, I'll add another jalapeno and more cheese.  I plan to use leftovers to make potato cakes.

Potatoes with a kick!  They were not too hot as long as you remove the jalepeno seeds.  I felt the need to add 1 Tbs of heavy cream to moisten it up a bit.  Otherwise perfect.  I served it with a Chicken & Dumplings III recipe off allrecipes.

No milk necessary! Excellent recipe as written. Make sure to chop up carrots, potatoes, and peppers before boiling. Also, canned corn works very well instead of frozen.

There are no words for the deliciousness of these potatoes; they are all kinds of awesome!  And that's coming from a mashed potato purist (I've always been of the school of thought of why mess w/a good thing!).  These ingredients intrigued me when I saw this recipe reviewed in the recent reviews and I decided to give them a try.  Mr. LTH deemed these (and the accompanying meal) "the best meal he's eaten in awhile", which is high praise for him (his standard feedback is "yeah, I like it; it's good").  I couldn't STOP eating them and actually had THREE servings!  I followed the recipe, but did not "measure" the potatoes and used 2/3 red (1/2 of them peeled, 1/2 w/skin on) and 1/3 white potatoes (no yellow at our grocery store).  I also used 2 jalaps, simply because I'd picked up two at the store (I deseeded and demembraned them as Mr. LTH is Mr. Sissypants when it comes to spice).  I didn't measure the cheese and I used a steamable bag of white/yellow corn.  I'm not a fan of chunky potatoes, so I chose to mashed these in our KA, rather than the old school method for a smoother consistency (I also couldn't resist adding just a splash of milk).  These are so good I WILL be serving them to our next dinner guests!

Made according to the recipe, except left out the jalapeno, and no one in our family likes them.  Quite tasty.  Just needed a fair amount of Mrs Dash to give it the "something" in taste that it needed.  We're cutting down on salt, so the Mrs Dash is our answer.  Like having multiple veggies.  Was a fair amount of work, but we'd make it again.

Love this recipe. Tasty and my picky vegetable hating 3 year old scarfed these down faster than I could. These will definitely be added to my dinner list. I did change the recipe just a bit though by adding a little bit of half and half and just a tiny bit of mascarpone cheese (about a tablespoon as that was all that was left in the container) for extra creaminess. Thanks for the recipe Steve!

I made these for my son and he had 3 portions! The trick? I added some bacon! Now I am figuring how to get other vegetables into this mix for next time. This is a great recipe.

This was delicious, I only gave it 4 stars b/c it does not say to cut up any of the ingredients before cooking. My husband kept poking at the whole potatoes wondering why they weren't soft yet. We omit the cheese to make it healthier and they are still great. And the jalapeno doesn't make it spicy at all if you are worried, I was.

These were awesome! The best potatoes ever, I plan to make them again tomorrow and just had them tonight. I'm going to add more jalapeno next time, and did add milk to make potatoes more creamy. Thanks for the great recipe

What a great twist on an original!  A bit of white pepper sure did the trick too.

I made these for my boyfriend several months ago.  He didn't like them at all.  This recipe has stuck around... he got the boot!

This was excellent! The vegetables were great in this. I left the potatoes fairly chunky, not so much mashed and it was great. I also added green beans and a little sour cream to the mix. After being refridgerated, it was great as a cold potato salad dish! I'll definately make this again.

A really great way to use up whatever veggies you have in your fridge. I used broccoli instead of carrots - it turned out great. I'll add more garlic next time.

I was a little nervous about this recipe.  The last potatoes that I made with carrots in them did not go over too well with my kids.  Then I was worried that the jalepeno would make them too spicy.  I was wrong on both accounts.  These are so good.  You don't really taste the carrots because of the other flavors, and the jalepeno adds just the right amount of spice.  I did only use Yukon Gold potatoes because I did not have any red potatoes.  I also added just a spoonful of sour cream in with the cheese.  I like that little zing that it adds.  Great recipe!

Couldn't find anything but red potatoes - those worked fine. Added peas also, skipped the jalapeno, and forgot the cheese. Still yummy! Even my 5 year old niece was complimenting me!

Wow these are great.  I used red potatoes and regular russet potatoes.  I also used a whole jalapeno and a couple dashes of cayenne.  I did not have any problems with these being not creamy enough after adding the butter and the cheese.  I did use real butter, maybe that makes a difference.

I didn't really care for these. I didn't have the jalepeno, but I used everything else. Mine looked more like yellow mashed potatoes with carrots as the recipe does not contain the peas pictured. They reminded me in taste of a garlic mashed potato, a little, but I thought the texture was odd with the carrots and corn. I also found them a little greasy, from the butter and cheese. This is a little more expensive to, to make, buying the red potatoes, yellow potatoes, and the rest of the ingredients especially since they really don't have a lot of flavor.

I, too, was skeptical about the recipe.  Glad that I did make it-really delicious!  Much easier to prepare than traditional mashed potatoes.  Used a sharp white cheddar cheese-added closer to a cup because we love cheese!  Will definitely make these again.

Was out of carrots, but had everything else. Sorta tasted like a loaded baked potato.... It was something different and sometimes different is good, other times you want to go back to the normal. Next time we make potatoes we will go back to normal, but every once and a while we will make these :)

Good way to have potatoes that are not dried out requiring a lot of butter later PLUS they have carrots in them which is kinda nice.

WOW!  Very good!  I only had yukon golds and I used a can of the big green guy's chipotle white shoe peg corn instead of the frozen.  I did add a "dollop" of sour cream to as I do with any mashed potatoes.  Steve, this is a great recipe.  Thanks for sharing!!!!

These are really good, but in the future, I'd heat the corn before adding to the potatoes - I used canned corn, and it really cooled the potatoes down too quickly.  Oddly, I thought that the garlic and jalapeno flavors disappeared (told you, odd) so I'd up them in the future, but 3 out of 5 family members really liked them as is.  (The fourth hates corn, which I always forget, so she was destined to hate these no matter what. In the future I'll also save a corn-free serving for her!)

The family thought thie was outrageous. They are not into spicey food so I left out the jalapeno pepper and used shredded cheese that had a little jalapeno pepper in it. Gave it just the right kick for them

Hmm, this was pretty good.  I give it a 5 because we all liked it a lot...it's a cheap meal to prepare, not necessarily bad for you (health wise), and a comfort type food.  Will probably make again...the only thing I changed was doubling the garlic, adding a little more cheese; I also used Ranch dressing in it, and green onion.  =)

These mashed potatoes have an unexpected punch, which makes them the perfect accompaniment to standards like steak. We like things spicy, so I added extra jalapeno.

I thought the potatoes were good, but nothing real special.  I added crumbled bacon, which added some flavor.  Everyone else really seemed to enjoy the potatoes.

Just delicious -- I couldn't stay away from the leftovers! They stayed creamy and delicious for several days.  When preparing, I doubled the garlic and threw in a dollop of sour cream at the end.  Yum yum yum! The best part was that my older daughter, who turns up her nose at carrots and anything else with vitamin A, chowed these right down.  Snuck those vitamins in without her even noticing!

This was just awesome!  We eat mashed potatoes all the time, and this recipe is such a nice variation on the same old, same old!  The carrots and potatoes blend so nicely, and the jalapeno adds a nice nip to the dish.  I couldn't find white corn so I added the frozen peaches and cream corn that we had...I honestly think that the white corn would have gone much better so will stock up on it for next time!

My new favorite mashed potatoes!  I've made this a bunch of times, using different kinds of potatoes and different combos of veggies.  I add a little milk and sometimes leave out the jalapeno; but they're always great-tasting.  Thanks for a great recipe for us culinary newbies!

Have made 3x and I am about to take to another cookout.  This time I stopped in to print copies of the recipe first.  I love making dishes no one around here has heard of or seen before.  I know everyone loves the old favorites at every cookout but I like to use cookouts to try out new tastes.  Not anymore!  I cant seem to leave home without this.  I boil it all whole except the jalapeno which I slice and leave in seeds and of course the corn.  I mash it with the skins still on after adding cheese and butter.  Then i fold in PEAS, corn, and BACON. Since it sits in a crock pot at cookouts I do bring along sour cream or milk to keep creamy, but I have used just hot water when nothing else was available.  (Can be made the day before)

I would say this is well named. It kind of looks like something a cowboy would cook over a campfire. Not so pretty, but tastes quite good! Went well with BBQ pork steaks. I will definitely make again!

I omitted the cheese and substituted 2 12oz packages of frozen country style mixed veggies. Served with pork chops and home made mushroom gravey. Very satisfying dish. Will definitely use on a regular basis.

Love this (always have mixed my corn with mashed spuds anyhow when they're served separately).  I used frozen mixed veggies, boiled to heat, then added them in AFTER I mashed the spuds so not to have them mashed up. I used small can of mild green chiles. Also agree with more garlic, & a little sour cream.

Love these tasty and colorful mashed potatoes!  Perfect with our meatloaf.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, with the exception of using a 28oz bag of mini yukon golds, and  folded some peas in at the end for even more color and veg.  A delicious, definite do-over.  Thanks for sharing, Steve.

Folkeat their lwed the recipe exactly, and my family loved this!  I didn't peel the potatoes, and used the jalapeno despite my apprehension about it being too 'hot'.  I'm glad I didn't alter the recipe.  It had great flavor with the skins, garlic, butter, and veggies.  It's a great way to get the kids to eat their veggies.  A keeper!  Thanks, Steve!

Genius! Why haven't I thought of this? No peeling potatoes and you get some added flavor, texture and additional nutrients from the veggies....AND the recipe makes more leftovers! This is a virtually zero-effort recipes (unless, of course, you're like me and can't find your potato masher at your new house and have to mash everything with a spoon. Yeah, that totally happened.) This recipe is so versatile - I used frozen peas and carrots and added milk and sour cream. I left out the jalapenos so my 1 year old could enjoy some too, and enjoy she did....I couldn't reload the spoon fast enough! THANK YOU for sharing, we'll be making this regularly without a doubt. Goes great with salisbury steak!

This was a great dish.  Looked and tasted fantastic.  Did not put in the Jalapeno pepper but did add a green onion.  Everyone loved this.  Was rated by the family as a "repeat" dish.

I made these for Thanksgiving. My son wasn't sure that he liked the cheese. I thought they were very yummy and definitely a change from the usual boring mashed potatoes. I will make this again!

Saved this recipe 8 years ago!!!  Why it has taken me so long to try and review is beyond me.....these are excellent mashed taters! I used russet potatoes, garlic, baby carrots and then added frozen defrosted corn and sweet baby peas with a package of shredded white cheddar. I also loosened up the mix with some fat free low sodium chicken broth and a splash of fat free half and half. Excellent and loved that the kiddos loved them and they were chock full of veggies! Thanks!

This is my new Favorite potato cassarole recipe. I love all the veggies and the jalapeno gives it just that little kick. My teenage boys loved it and I didn't change a thing.

Good recipe. Found it a little bland. Next time will try to spice it up a bit. Overall a good starter recipe and got my picky eaters to actually eat their veggies instead of hiding them UNDER the mashed potatos.

This dish is DELISH! So that it is more suitable for my pickier kids, I omit the jalapeno and just use garlic salt. It doesn't matter what kind of potatoes you use, I have tried several different and they are all good.

Had to bribe my 7-year-old to try this, but once he did, this skeptic thought it was great! He doesn't like carrots, but it doesn't taste like carrots.  With everything in it, it still pretty much tastes like yummy chunky mashed potatoes!  Very clever recipe, and a keeper!

These potatoes are fantastic! I was kind of uncertain at first too, especially about what mashing would do to the carrots and corn, but it was fine. I cut the baby carrots in thirds before boiling and that seemed ideal, since the chunks were big enough for flavor and texture but not too big. We did break down and top with sour cream for some flavor since we're cutting out a lot of salt, but even the bites without sour cream were tasty! Excellent recipe.

After reading the reviews I couldn't wait to try this. I tested it at a church potluck and hit the jackpot! I added equal amount of peas and corn plus 4 slices of crumbled bacon.  Next time I might even add another jalapeno. There wasn't a bite left and even my husband ate veggies he wouldn't touch otherwise!

My absolute favorite new recipe!  I crave this all the time, no joke.  My mom looked at me like I was crazy when I told her I wanted to try this, and now the whole family is addicted too.  We do like to add an extra jalapeno, though - you really can't taste it much with just one in there, and we like just a little bit of that flavor in there.  AWESOME!

Very easy!  Never have added the jalapeno cause my kids do not like to spicy.  I do add cream or half and half at when I smash to make them a bit creamier.

Wow, these are super crazy fun! They pop in your mouth and like my husband said, they are spicy!  I made several modifications due to what I had on hand. Used 4-5 small yellow potatoes, cubed, 10 sliced japalenos from a jar, 2 tsp. minced garlic, and 5 oz. baby carrots. Put in 2.5 TB of butter, and about 1/2 cup shredded cheese. Next time (and there will be a next time!) I think I might try adding cream corn to give it that creamy mash potato texture.

I am from Texas and used to jalepenos in pico, Tex Mex, etc. so added the additional jalepeno as suggested by several people.  However it was a bit too spicy.  Great recipe overall for my family, in-laws, kids, but would suggest starting with the one jalepeno called for in the original recipe.

I cut the carrots in thirds so they would cook in about the same time as the cubed potatoes and they were done along with the potatoes.  I also minced the garlic so the taste would distribute more evenly.  Ended up adding about twice the amount of cheese.  This was OK but probably will not make again but if I do, I will leave out the carrots.

I used brown potatoes b/c this is what I had.  Overall, yummy.  I did add a big spoonful of sour cream.  It made them smoother/creamier. I would recommend this.  The garlic and jalapeno amount it really up to you.

I will NEVER make traditional plain mashed potatoes again!!  I love this.  I have made this twice now.  A few modifications:  I added chopped onion to the potatoes and carrots.  I put the garlic and jalepeno in once the water just started to boil. That way all the flavor isn't boiled out. My hubby isn't a fan of corn, so I left that out. It was best when I put it all together in the food processor instead of using the hand mixer.  A few people have said that there wasn't much flavor to this.  I didn't have that problem at all.  I really think the key is the timing of the garlic and jalepeno.  Lots of flavor and just the right amount of 'kick'.

I made these for Thanksgiving dinner - potatoes are always my contribution and I usually whip them with garlic added in but I thought that since thankgiving is really about the harvest, this recipe seemed fitting and worth a try. I didn't add the cheese since it wouldn't be a great mix with gravy but would definetly use it another time for a regular supper. The only thing I could find fault with is that I didn't taste the jalepenos at all. I think next time I'll add it at the end when mashing (along with the garlic as well). I also added a couple of thinly sliced green onions and used garlic butter. It was a real hit with the family... at first they were dissapointed that it wasn't the whipped, but once they took their first bites they really liked it - got a lot of compliments and no complaints.

Loved these potatoes.  I added bacon to this and it was a big hit with my family when we were on vacation.  I will be bringing these potatoes to family gatherings from now on...at least that is what my family said ;)

The only thing I changed about this recipe is adding some seasoning to the water used to cook the potatoes, carrots, garlic and the pepper.   The end product was great.      I will make Cowboy Mashed Potatoes again.

I made these for a family dinner, and everyone loved them.  I'll add a bit more garlic and jalapenos for my immediate family, however.  Make SURE you use a potato masher...I think using a mixer would ruin the unique texture.

Excellent!!!  I served with Tasty Tender Pork Tenderloin from this website.  I didn't change anything.  The carrots and corn were soooooo good this way!

This was OK for me, but my husband really liked it.  I forgot to add the garlic cloves, but added garlic powder at the end (with salt and pepper.)  Also added a tbs of buttermilk.  Next time I will omit the carrots and add one more jalepeno pepper for more spice!

I love these potatoes!  The corn and carrots add some extra flavor and texture and allow it so that you don't need to add anything else (except maybe a little salt) to have a very flavorful side dish!

These potatoes are great!  I was out of red potatoes, so just used all Yukon gold, yellow corn instead of white, Velveeta instead of Cheddar, and a can of Rotel instead of the jalapeno.  Next time I make them I'll make sure I have the right ingredients on hand, but I don't see how they could be any better.

Mashed potatoes are my favorite food, so I was a little nervous about changing the traditional recipe, especially by adding carrots & jalepenos.  But I have to say that this was pretty good.  It made my husband eat cooked carrots, while still fulfilling the potato part of "meat & potatoes."  And these are even better when reheated the next day.  It gives the flavors a chance to blend.  I could never eat leftover regular mashed potatoes.

This was a good recipe, but needs sour cream.  I'll be making this again with just that little addition.  Oh, we used a jalapeno cheese on top of using a can of chopped jalapenos, it was great and gave it a extra kick.

Well after 20 years of marriage I decided it was time to make mashed potatoes from scratch instead of a box.  These were great! And easy!  I liked the carrot addition.  This makes a lot too even though I only used 4 white and 4 red medium sized potatoes, and 1/2 bag of baby carrots.  I used a can of mexicorn which has diced peppers instead of using jalapeno since I didn't have those on hand. Thanks for this great recipe

I double everything-check my other reviews if you have a big family too.  wow, this is so simple and so tasty. I doubled this recipe.  I didn't know if you are suppose to leave the skins on or not so I only peeled the yukon gold potatoes and not the reds.  I also par-microwaved the frozen corn because I thought it might be too hard if I didn't.  I don't think it made a difference-next time I won't.  I thought the baby carrots were perfect and did not chop them and that worked too. The only deviation from the recipe was to add peas, a little milk and plain yogurt (didn't have sour creme).  This was soo tasty.

Everyone loved these! I had to change it slightly, b/c my husband doesn't like cheese (i know, can you beleve it?) so I added butter and light sour cream in its place. I also left out the jalepno pepper, and used yellow corn instead of white, b/c that's what I had. it was colorful and tasty -- we've made it twice! Even my 7 month old baby eats it up and says "yummm!" after each bite. You KNOW it's a hit, then! :)

What a  delicious way to take boring out of mashed potatoes. These were awesome and my kids loved them too. I added more garlic, but did everything else according to the recipe. Thanks for a definite 'will make again and again' recipe.

Mixing in the veggies and throwing in some cheddar is a great idea that ensures success.  The only thing I'd do differently is add a touch of milk to make it creamier.  And I love that it can be made in one pot!

These were very good and the recipe went together easily.  I took the seeds out of the jalapeno and it wasn't very hot.  I might try leaving the seeds in next time.

So tasty! Only had a bag of frozen veggies (peas, carrots, corn etc) which I added about 5 minutes into boiling the potatos. Also had no jalapenos (would have been much better, I know), and STILL turned out AMAZING! New family favorite for sure :)

I cut back on the jalapeno when I made this (twice) because I have a small child, but otherwise i followed the recipe exactly.  I was not expecting so much flavor!  Delicious!

I love these mashed potatoes so much because there are so many veggies in them and the potato skins stay on.  If you make these and have leftovers, here's a great way to repurpose them:  make egg and potato burritos.  Fill a large tortilla shell with reheated cowboy mashed potatoes (you may need to add a little milk during the reheating) and scrambled eggs, then fold up the burrito, cover it with warm ranchera sauce and a little cheddar or cotija cheese.  Makes for a great and easy dinner!

So easy and so good. I did add an extra jalapeno and will add even more next time (3-4 would be good) for some more zip.

Ok, so I didn't exactly use this recipe, but it gave me the ideas I need to make a spectacular dish of my own.  I was making meatloaf for dinner and had some spuds, plus a bunch of stuff that needed using up but I wasn't sure how to make it work.  Until I came across this recipes and read some of the reviews.  So what was in my spuds you ask.  Peas, leek, garlic and bacon.  All topped off with a gravy.  YUM!

Loved this!  I think I'd add a bit more jalapeño just because I love anything spicy.  Maybe even some green chile, not because there's anything wrong with it as is though.  Super yummy!

Great recipe . I used all red potatoes, and I added some light sour cream(4 tablespoons) . It was kind of dry looking . Some people like dry but my family like it moist . So it's up to you .but overall great recipe . Kids friendly ( my picky kids are it all).

It wasn't bad.  It just wasn't worth the extra effort or expense.    Better off with plain mashed potatoes.  Better yet choose one of the excellent mashed potato recipes such as Caramelized Onions and Horseradish Mashed Potatoes on this site.

This dish is AWESOME! I didn't have exact ingredients on hand, so I changed/added a few. First of all, I only used 1cup of corn and added 1cup of sweet peas instead to make it look prettier. My family loves cheese, so I used 1.5cups of shredded Mexican cheese instead of 1/2 cup cheddar. Also, I added 6 strips of crumbled bacon - HUGE HIT!!! I served it with sour cream and extra cheese, almost like loaded potatoes. Everyone cleaned their plates, and I was asked to make again soon! ;)

I have made these with the corn and without the corn.  We actually like them better without the corn.  Either way, they are served reguarlly at our table.

This recipe was very good. I loved the idea of extra veggies especially carrotts in the recipe. It was a great way to get my children to eat them since they love mashed potatoes. The entire family loved these mashed potatoes. Full of flavor and delicious. I will be serving this dish again and again.

Probably only 4 stars when you forget the cheese like I did, but very good.  You can at least double the pepper (I did & still didn't notice) along w/ the garlic.  I also added a little milk for creaminess.

For all of the colors and flavors going on here, they were on the bland side, I have to admit. The jalapeno adds a good kick and great idea to just boil the garlic with the spuds - although I doubled the garlic and would add more even! I sprinkled in peas and corn in ratio without measuring. No cheese - which is maybe why mine were a bit on the dry side. Next time I would add some kind of broth. They're mashed potatoes - what's not to love?

Great way to change up regular mashed potatoes. I used yellow corn and some manchego cheese which added a little bit of a different flavor.   I made potato pancakes with the left overs as someone had suggested and they tasted even better the second time.   Will make again soon with new veggies.

Excellent!  Even the kids loved it, and husband - who never likes leftovers - ate it up for the next 2 days!  I didn't have any jalapeno, but it didn't seem to matter.  It did take more than 20 minutes of boiling for the potatoes anad carrots to soften.  I wasn't sure how many for a pound, so I used 5 medium Yukons which seemed to work.

Every time I make this recipe, there is never a time when someone doesn't want the recipe or says how wonderful it is. Omit the shallots and just cut up finley a green onion. 1/2 sour cream is a good idea. Also, this is not a "salad" its more like twice baked potatoes. Yummy!!!!

YUMMY! Definitely a great way to get a couple of servings of veggies in one! We like a little heat and will probably add some more jalapenos next time!

I love that I can sneak in as many vegetables as I have into this recipe - and it still tastes wonderful! A healthy, hearty spin on mashed potatoes. This is a great way to use up half packages of veggies from other recipes.

The whole family (including the dog!) loved this recipe!  The instructions seem strange for mashed potatoes, but it really does come out fantastic just exactly as written.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!  (cooking time for mine was closer to 40 min... but that was the only difference from the recipe)

This sounded so weird I had to try it. Reminded me of that horror of a fast food KFC was (is?) selling. This however was DELISH. I gave it 4 stars because I felt it needed a little something extra (approximately 1/3 C of sour cream). Got raves from my DH, MIL, and 2 year old son. Served w/rotisserie chicken and Rory's excellent cornbread (from this site). Great winter time meal.

At the advice of others, I added more jalapenos (5) and more cloves.  I boiled everything in half water/half chicken broth.  Followed everything else exactly as stated.I blended it easily with my kitchenaid stand mixer and added a bunch of garlic salt and pepper to season.  Added corn at the very end to add texture.  Overall, I still found this recipe a little bland and prefer regular mashed potatoes with the usual butter, milk, and salt.

I have made this before with four jalepenos instead of just one. It has a much better, not too spicy robust flavor.

Fantastic side dish!  It feeds a ton of people, so I only make it when we have company.  Everyone loves it!  I omit the peppers, but follow the rest of the recipe as-is.  My daughter loves to throw in bacon-bits.  I think the leftovers taste even better!

These were decent. My fiance and I won't be craving these anytime soon (but I won't rule out the possibility of ever making them again). If you have kiddos, this recipe ROCKS!!! Steve, you are a genius when it comes to finding a creative way to "sneak" veggies into something EVERYONE likes - mashed taters!!! The presentation is beautiful too (my red potato skins turned a purplish color, which, with the orange carrots, green jalapeno and yellow sweet corn, was absolutely BEAUTIFUL!!!). This recipe was pretty much what I expected, except for a couple of "minor" nuiances. I thought the jalapeno would add some heat, but it didn't. I even added most of the seeds (Steve's directions didn't specify whether to or not...). I also thought that boiling my veggies for 20 minutes would be long enough to cook them thru, but it wasn't (my carrots were still a tad undercooked). I had to ask my fiance to help me mash everything since I was having no luck with the carrots! Oh, and you defiintely do not need milk, sour cream, cream cheese, etc. - just add butter and a good dose of s&p. These are plenty creamy (and seasoned) without! Served alongside Incredibly Cheesy Meatloaf (Brooke), the two paired nicely together. Thanks for sharing, Steve :)

This is suprisingly good.  Easily adapted to ingredients on hand.  It doesn't sound very appealing but it tastes great.

I'm going to use this as my mashed potato recipe from now on.  I can have my veggies without sacrificing the taste.  I cooked my carrots first since they take longer and then added my potatoes and corn.  This made the carrots so tender that they blended into the potatoes.  Lovely color.  I didn't use any butter since I was adding cheese.  I saved the veggie broth to make some gravy for later.

YUM YUM YUM. Our family already adds corn to mashed potatoes...  but what a good idea to mash some carrots, etc. in. The whole family liked, and that is unusual! Great alternative for  "something different" from mashed potatoes.

Yummy!

I doubled the cheese and added 4 oz of softened cream cheese.  I used frozen (thawed) yellow corn that I threw in with the potatoes and carrots during the last two minutes of boiling so the corn would be hot too.  I added 1 tsp of garlic powder, salt, pepper each.

Next time I will boil the carrots about 5 minutes before I add the potatoes, I had a hard time mashing them.  I resorted to using my hand mixer.  They still tasted great!  

I took this to a dinner at my mom's house, they kept well in the crock pot on "warm" for several hours.  Everyone loved them.  Even the kids...a nice way to sneak in some veggies!

This is a very delicious, colorful potato recipe!  I made a couple of very minor alterations: 1. since I didn't have red potatoes, I just went with yellow potatoes and 2. I went with kernel corn from a can rather than frozen corn.  Besides that, I followed the recipe as instructed and it turned out great.  The next time I make this recipe, I may add crumbled bacon and extra jalapeno to make it spicier.

These were pretty good! I added two extra garlic cloves and extra cheese. I didn't have any fresh jalapenos so I used some from a jar. I added them after boiling and mashing the potatoes. My kids loved them!

This is a great recipe!  I added one chopped onion to the boiling water with the potatoes, pepper, and carrots. A whole jalapeno gave this extra kick without making it too spicy. I also added milk while whipping the potatoes with beaters.  My picky family ate this two nights in a row!

These are good but lack a little in the taste and heatdepartment.  I spiced mine up a little more and they were good and had a good presentation.

Absolutely wonderful and satisfying.   I cut down on the amount of garlic; we are not fans of garlic.  My husband raved over these potatoes.  Definitely worth the try .... a KEEPER!

We thought this was really good comfort food. I used all Yukon gold, only 2 carrots (at hubby's request), and a cup of freshly cooked corn scraped from the cob. For cheese I used American, and I left out the jalapeno pepper (hubby again). I liked the fact that it was lower in fat, and I loved the addition of corn--adds a nice crunch & a bit of sweetness. A very flavorful dish!

Changed two things in this recipe.  Instead of water, we used chicken broth (to cook vegetables) & Smart Balance instead of butter.  We reserved about 1/8 c of cooking liquid & added it to the mashed potatoes instead of using any cheese.  Far fewer calories & very, very delicious!!!

Adored it.  Used canned carrots even, and it was fantastic.  A nice way to make mashed potatoes more interesting and healthier on account of added veggies.  Left out jalepeno cause of the kids.  My 2 yr old was scooping up great big handfuls of it and cramming it.  I think it's all he ate!!!

I dont know why this did not work for us...maybe too many carrots? My kids would not eat it - even my veggie eater. I liked it but no one else did. Probably will not make again, sorry.

We had this last night, and were surprised how much we enjoyed it!  Looks a little weird while you're stirring the ingred together, but tasted great. Made some changes, omitted the pepper, and I didn't have garlic cloves, which was definitely missed.  We added sour cream at the end and it made it a little creamier.  Fast and easy...and got some veggies in the family!  Good!

Great change of pace from regular mashed potatoes and an excellent way to get more healthy vegtables in.  Next time I'll experiement with some other kinds of veggies also.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Wonderful!- everyone agreed.
I used Monterey Jack cheese instead and added a little whole milk to make them a little smoother but these were so good and a nice change of pace.  Thanks for this great recipe.

There weren't any Yukon Golds at the store, so I had to use some Russets, which I peeled after cooking. They turned out very yummy and moist. Next time, I'd add more garlic in the mashing phase just because I love garlic mashed potatoes. Definitely a good recipe for mashed potatoes that I will use again and again.

These were great!  I used Fat Free Margarine and Fat Free shredded Cheddar/Mozzarella mixture to make it fit Weight Watchers Core plan.  It was an awesome way to incorporate veggies.
I'm even thinking of adding chopped canadian bacon next time for some added flavor, while sticking to the Core Plan!

great recipe, will make again. my boyfriend said they were the best mashed potatoes ever. I added little extra cheese  which i think made them a little to dense so next time i'll skip and use milk to fluff. thanks

Yummy!  So creamy, and without milk!  Amazing!  Didn't use two kinds of potatoes, still delicious!

Very good!  I have a hard time making mashed potatoes with any flavor, so this recipe was great.  The additional ingredients give tons of flavor.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Very nice change to regular mashed potatoes. VERY tasty too!  Even my picky 12 yr old, who doesn't like cooked carrots, had seconds.  I used an extra clove of garlic and really didn't notice too much garlic flavor.  We couldn't taste the jalapeno at all.  I think the next time I will try 2 jalapenos or maybe even a serrano instead (or in addition to).  Thanks for the recipe!

These mashed potatoes were such a wonderful change. The whole family loved them! I used cream corn instead of whole corn and it was amazing. I highly recommend giving this recipe a shot. Thank you very much for the great recipe!

Very tasty. Have some left over, always plan to, store in fridg and make into patties, place under broiler with dollop of butter and coarse black pepper on top. Brown. Excellent when added to breakfast menu. Can be used with all left over mashed potatoes.

These were really good and very quick and easy to make. I used 1/2 can of diced chilies instead of the jalapeno but we couldn't even taste it. Next time I will try fresh or add the whole can. I think the suggestions of some to add chopped bacon and/or green pepper would be delicious!

My family realy liked this dish. It's a good one to change add/change ingrediants and very hard to "mess"up.  We will have this dish quite often.  I use pepper jack cheese and a lettle more galic.

These were ok. It seemed like they were missing something. Next time I think I'll add a little milk and sour cream and maybe no carrots. I had to put a lot of salt on them to give them more flavor. I think I will try it again but with a few changes.

My family loves these - they are like mashed potatoes with texture.  I made a couple of changes: I used canned rather than frozen corn and I added some milk, extra garlic, and extra pepper, tasting as I went, and it came out great!

I must have added to many carrots because that was all we could taste in the mix....My husband thought it was alot like Veg-All. It was amusing though to see my 5 year old daughter's face as she kept taking bites of it because she was trying to prove that she could clean her plate.

This is a fabulous recipe for potatoes.  Wonderful for a meal when there isn't any gravy but you still want mashed potatoes.  Everyone in my family enjoyed.  We fought over the leftovers for lunch the next day.  Definately a keeper.  Very colorful with the carrots too.

This is a great and easy recipe.  I just used regular old bagged potatoes.  So I'm sure it's even better with the potatoes called for in the recipe.  Was very good!

This was awesome!  Next time I will cut the carrots up so they will mash better.  Or maybe mash them by themself then add them to the potato mixture.

I've made this simple, tasty recipe twice. It was well received by the adults, but wasn't memorable, thus the 4 star review.  I recently made it again when I had 4 visiting kiddos for a week and wanted to come up with meals that pleased both the adults and the kids.  Like many kids, they aren't big on veggies, and I thought this recipe was a clever way to get them to add some "color" to their diet because they love potatoes and cheese. Wrong! 1 kid ate it all and asked for seconds, 2 picked on it and the youngest wouldn't eat it because of the veggies. Oh well! I still recommend giving it a try, because it is tasty, easy and might just trick your kid(s) into ingesting some veggies. :-)

This was good, but I could not add the peppers because of the kiddos. Will definitely try it with peppers when I can! Other than that, the only thing I did differently was add some mayo (no butter) and topped my own serving off with a touch of A1. Thanks!

Solid recipe, though not one I'd make a lot on account of it needing more butter than my usual go-to mashed potato/champ recipes. Still, I like the idea of boiling the other veggies in the same place, especially the garlic; I didn't use baby carrots though, and instead used rapini florets, green beans, and leek.

I was so surprised at how much this made! I left out the pepper because I was afraid my little ones wouldn't like it. It hit the spot. I will definitely make it again. The next time I make this recipe I'll half the recipe to make some Cowboy Mashed Taters with kick and without (for my little ones.) I might even make it in the future and add some peas into the pot....

Great recipe! I added frozen peas right at the end and used butter and milk. The carrots crush pretty good when you throw them in whole, and are soft if you dont crush them. I added extra garlic and it was great. The only downside is that some of the nutrients boil out and are lost. Otherwise, GREAT!

I used what I had on hand--regular Idaho potatoes and carrots. Because I can't stand lumpy potatoes, I put them through a ricer like I always do, so mine just looked a little orangey instead of having visible pieces of carrot and pepper.  I added the corn and butter after ricing them. I didn't really taste the jalapeno pepper, but overall, they were good mashed potatoes. I don't think the taste was much different than my regular garlic potatoes, but the addition of the carrots added nutrition and I appreciate that. I'll certainly make them again. Thanks!

This recipe reminds me of my childhood when I mixed whatever was on my plate into my potatoes.  I used equal parts carrots and potatoes, doubled the jalapeno, and omitted the butter and cheese to reduce calories.

I forgot to add the cheddar cheese and it was still yummy.  For a tasty kick, I recommend pan searing the jalapeno and garlic and adding after the potatoes are boiled, otherwise the flavor gets boiled out.

This recipe was a little dry so I recommend either adding a lil milk or putting butter on them once it's served.  Also when I cooked the potatoes I ended up having to quarter them to get them to cook because after 20 minutes the potatoes weren't hard enough to mash.

I've made several this dish for several parties and everyone always loves it. I usually add a little more garlic and jalapeno, but it's good even without the extras.

The best mashed potatoes.  Have to physically pull the husband away from them.  Of course I added way more cheese than the recipe calls for and have used several different kids of potatoes.  Always comes out great.

I wish I could give a 4 1/2 star because 4 seems too low and 5 is a little too generous. Having said that, we really enjoyed these, but I will probably try some adjustments next time. They were good (4 star), but not blow-me-away fabulous (5 star). We doubled the recipe (big family) and since we doubled it, only had one fresh jalapeno, so I used some extras from a jar. Would probably add extra next time since we really like spicier things. I did get my non-mashed-potato-eater to eat ALL of the small serving I gave her...and enjoy them, which is why I would give them more than the 4 stars.

Good, on par with basic mashed potatoes with cheese, sour cream, etc.  I doubled the batch and served them to guests.  This is also a good way to incorporate more veggies into your kids' diet.  I used canned carrots for simplicity, and they worked well.

Honestly, I would have only rated them a 3--solid, but not impressive.  However, hubby and the kids loved them.  I think i will leave out the corn next time, not really fan,and then we might have something.  I agree with others, I might double the jalapeno, double the garlic, and maybe add some chopped green onion at the end.  I did like that the recipe didn't call for a ton of cream or more butter.  I felt they still had a good texture without it.  Good playing-with recipe.

Easy and tasty. The corn and carrots add a nice subtle sweetness to the potatoes, so that it is not necessary to add much if any salt.

I'm a cowgirl living alone, and I still loved these! It must be the child in me. I didn't add any jalapeno but that is just because I didn't have any- next time I make them (and there will be a next time), I will definitely add it. The next day, I made them into potato pancakes, as other reviewers suggested, and those were great too!

Thank you, Steve. I make these on Sunday and serve throughout the week.  I have used various cheeses - depending on what I have.  I have even used Velveeta and always add a little cream cheese.  I fry onion and red sweet pepper to add if I have to use them up. No matter how I alter the original, it comes out great.
UPDATE:  I add a little cream cheese and carmelized onion and use as filling for perogies.  I use the wonderful perogy dough recipe on this site -Grandma's Polish Perogies.

Added diced ham and a bit of cream cheese for flavor and texture.  Tough to find Yukon Gold Potatoes and cheddar cheese here in Germany so, just used "Speisekartoffeln" and "butterkaese" as substitutes.  Very very tasty.

I think the idea behind this recipe is better than the actual recipe.  The title is much more fancy than what it delivers.  I didn't taste any spice...it was pretty much like mashed potatoes with corn and cheese in it.  I would say, try this recipe, but be ready to doctor it up.

My kids loved this dish! The flavors were wonderful as well as the fact that it serves as a side dish and vegetable dish at the same time. My daughter begged me to make this again. I love it when the kids love their veggies! The only change I made was that I didn't use a jalepeno pepper as it might have been too spicy for the children.

These were so good, the recipe is easy to follow and the taste is very good, just enough spice and sweet. The only changes I made were that I used a mexican blend of cheese and I added a little onion powder and garlic powder while the potatoes were boiling. Thanks so much!

This dish is not only pretty with all the different colors but it is tasty too!  My husband and I were raving about how good it was when I remembered I forgot to add the cheese. It tasted fine without it so we left it out but next time I will add it in.

I just made this today before church for a potluck, and it was a sMASHING hit.  So many people asked me how I made it.  

I skipped the jalepeno and I doubled the garlic. Also, I didn't mash the corn w/ the potato and carrots. I stirred that in with the cheese at the end, and it added a nice bit of a crunch.  This is the perfect potluck recipe for someone who's cutting impaired!

The mashed potatoes and vegetable in one dish!  I used a handful of banana peppers instead of the jalapeno.  Also used a large splash of milk instead of the butter, and it turned out excellent! It's especially good smothered in turkey gravy.

These were great! I always add more butter than recommended to any mashed potatoes and I did so here. Anytime I've made mashed potatoes and corn as side dishes, I've always mixed them together. This recipe is just my two favorite mixed sides with extra goodies.

These were great and so different.  I loved having the extra veggies in there.  I used 3 cloves of garlic and my husband still felt it was bland, so he added garlic salt to his and proclaimed it perfect!  I did put ground hamburger in here to make it a full meal.  Worked beautifully and even my very picky 4 year old ate it right up.

Unexpectedly good!  I didn't have any jalapenos so I just dumped a can of Rotel into the boiling potatoes.  I chopped my carrot.  I also used a can of Niblet corn and added it into the water for the last 5 minutes.  I love cheese, so I doubled the cheese.  It was a hit!

Personally, I really liked these. I think I could have eaten the entire pot myself. ;) Hubby liked them too. The younger kids on the other hand weren't fans. At all. So, these are relegated to the grown up dinners. Maybe with steak and mushrooms? Yum.

Pretty good for a different twist on a healthier version of mashed potatoes!  I used only yukon golds, grilled fresh corn, lots more carrots/garlic and added pepper jack cheese at the end - oh used spray butter substitute as well.  It reminded me of being a kid when you "Mixed" everything on your plate for some reason.  Great comfort food and easy meal for 1 or 2.  I wouldn't go as far as to make if for company but it was quick, easy and tasty and will make it again for a myself and the BF.  Thanks!

My boyfriend really liked it. I didn't as much.  I did change the recipe some; I added sour cream, peas, and yellow corn instead of white and omited the carrots.

I really enjoyed this recipe! It was something different.  I will say I roasted 2 cloves of garlic in the oven for 40 mins and also put 2 cloves in with the water. It was Great!!!

I added the frozen corn and it cooled it right off. Next time I'll warm it in the pan with the butter, then add the drained potatoes.  I only cut the ends of the jalapeno and tossed it in with the 4 whole cloves of garlic - may use more of both next time!  These are so yummy, I admit I was hesitant, but with so many good reviews, had to try it for myself.  I forgot to add the cheese when I tasted it, so mixed it in later. Yum, yum, yum!!!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

First, I forgot to print this off and did it by memory, so my version was different--I added some small onions, used more garlic than required, didn't have a jalapeno (used a couple pinches of cayenne) used canned corn and used skim milk instead of butter.  I didn't do this to try to improve the recipe, but because I didn't have it with me.  Anyway, we all loved the results.  I ate some cold out of the fridge later that night I liked it so well.  Great recipe--probably even better when you do it right.

WOW...this was delicious.  It was perfect.  A little more jalapeno may have been even better.  DONT add extra cheese.  It ruins the texture.

Pretty quick and pretty good, what more can you ask for?  Added just a touch of sour cream along with the cheese.  These were a hit.

I used turkey bacon, left out the corn and added minced garlic to the water. i left the skins on the potatoes also. 
Hubby loved it and ate the leftovers for a few days...
A great way to sneak in extra veggies

Excellent!!!!!!!!!  May need to mash the mixture in batches, but otherwise, very easy to prepare.  For those health-conscious individuals out there, I'm sure these potatoes would be delicious without or with less butter.  For those looking for some zing to their potatoes, you might want to aadd more jalapeno--we couldn't really taste that flavor among the many other wonderful flavors.  Great recipe!!!

What a great idea to add veggies to the potatoes. I also added some broccoli. My family loved these!  I did not peel the potatoes and only mashed them a bit so they were chunky. I left out the jalapeno...was concerned about them being to spicy for my children. I think it would have been even better with it, I may try it next time.

These drew rave reviews from my boyfriend, despite  being a bit gluey...I added a bit of milk for mashing, doubled the garlic amount,  used a whole 16 oz bag of white corn, and increased the butter a little.  Served with the Southern Living Magazine's chicken fried steak (see review) and stir-fried veggies, and definately had a happy camper!

My guests went wacky for these potatoes.  I did omit the peppers, however, because I was afraid they might overpower the dish.  Next time I may add a small amount to boost the flavor, because I found I did have to season them with a lot of salt and pepper.  But this was a great side dish.

Excellent recipe! You always get the skeptical ones that eyeball all the "things" in the mashed potatoes, but they always end up loving them (even the carrot haters).  I use light velveeta instead of cheddar sometimes, leave the skins on the potatoes, skip the jalepeno, use less butter and make up for the dryness by adding nonfat milk.  If you use the extra sweet Niblets corn, it tastes awesome.

I made this for my children and my husband even though I was on the South Beach Diet.  Just to make sure I had the potatoes seasoned just right I had to taste them, and they were simply delicious.  I left out the peppers for my kids sake but I know they would have only made them better.  I only wish I could have had a whole serving. Very Good Recipe.

Difficult to drain the water from the pot, and overall, a lot of work for something that wasn't THAT amazing.  Thought it needed more butter to make it less dry.

This was great.  Like other reviewers, I wasn't too sure about the carrots, but it turned out just fine – they blended perfectly with the other ingredients.  This is a good side dish for steak or carne asada.

Wasn't sure how this was going to turn out but what a hit!  Thought the carrotts and corn were a little weird but with a little tweaking, I will be able to get a child who HATES mashd potatoes to eath them!  Thank you for this new staple in my recipe box!!!  Also, I ommitted the jalapeno and used a mexican shredded cheese product that had jalapeno peppers in it.  Will add a little more spice/flavoring next time but this is still a great side dish - a nice variation to the same old potatoe!!!

Wow are these good!  Not the same old mashed potatoes at all.  What was really great was the fact that I didn't feel that I need to make another side to go with my bbq chicken.  I was hoping my dd 2 would eat them but she didn't more for my husband and I.  I subsituted 1 can of chopped green chiles for the Japaleno my grocery store's pepper selection was not labeled and I was afraid I might pick out something really hot.

I made my mashed potatoes as normal (3 gloves roasted garlic, sour cream, sharp cheddar,splash of cream and milk,) and then added just the corn because I couldnt get over how weird carrots seemed. Awesome

Great recipe!  It's nice to have the veggies and potatoes in the same pan!  The less dishes to wash the better!  My family loves these potatoes, especially when the kids think they are eating like cowboys do!  A big hit for all!!

Everybody looked at me like I was crazy when I brought the "orange potatoes" to the table.  After that everybody was too busy eating to worry about the color.  Totally delish.  Left out the jalapeno because the main dish was already spicy, left out the corn and cheese because wanted a simpler side dish.  So basically I made mashed potatoes and carrots, and it was great!!

Awesome, loved them.  I really like the orangy hue they get from the carrots and I always mix my corn and mashed potatoes anyway so this recipe did it for me.  Guests liked it as well.  I will definately make it again.

Sorry to say this recipe had no flavor, my kids wouldn't touch it, and it took a while to cut it all up and prepare. Now I have a large pot of mashed potatoes that I have to sift out the veggies from, and make a gravy for, so they'll eat it tomorrow. Oh well. It's pretty.

This recipe is very simple and quick.  My daughter ate three servings by herself!  I didn't use the Yukon potatoes but Idaho's and red potatoes seemed good to me.  Definitely a keeper.

I didn't have a potato masher so I used a hand mixer. I think it mashed it a little too much. So I wasn't much for the texture. I wasn't sure about the "boiled garlic". I might give it a second try and use a potato masher instead of a hand mixer to make a little lumpier.

Excellent alternative to good ol' fashioned mashed potatoes. I left out the cheddar cheese and it was still delicious and slightly healthier.

These were good, and I didn't even have carrots or jalapeno on hand.  I dashed in some cayenne as I was mashing.  I also used regular baking potatoes--now I'm no potato connoiseur(sp?), but they weren't very creamy, so I added more butter and some milk.  Are the recommended potatoes creamier?  I've never really compared them side-by-side.

Good concept, but could've used more potatoes, or just less everything else. I added 10 ounces of peas as well, but boy there were not enough potatoes. Maybe I just like potatoes too much lol. I would however allow for a lot more time to boil the potatoes as it took double-triple the amount of time for me at max heat even.

Like others I was a little hesitant to make this for a family gathering.  Boy was I surprised.... it was very easy, very flexible for ingredients and very popular.  I will definitely use this one again and just change up the veggies.  I usually make mashed potatoes and add sautéed spinach or chard.  This was a very nice change.

After another reviewer noted that the picture shows peas, but peas were not included in the recipe, I added some peas (I feel the corn and peas should've been cooked at least a little in the boiling water, and not just have the thawed veggies added to the drained potatoes and carrots). I found the recipe bland, and while it was not bad, it's not a recipe I'm adding to my collection.

i was pleasantly surprised at how this turned out.. i was looking for a healthier side dish for bf's dinner and found this.. next time i'd double the garlic or leave it raw and crush it in to give the potatoes a bit of a kick.. i made a few modifications but think i stuck to the recipe's intention: used all russets, subbed pickled jalapeno that i chopped up for the fresh and threw it in at the end.. used a combo of yellow corn and peas for the white corn.. and lastly used margarine for the butter.. i also added a bit of unsweetened coconut milk to give it more of a creamy consistency.. i know bf is going to love this.. ty for the recipe

This dish is excellent and so easy to prepare!  However, don't make the same mistake I did and use super sweet corn!  The sweetness was too overwhelming for some in my family.

These are the BEST!!!  We use a little more jalapeno...and set some aside to add at the last minute...as to not lose all the spicy-ness...But these are a huge hit.  We love them!

I have been making these for years. Anytime we have steak or chops my husband asks for these potatoes. The best part about them - you can't really mess them up and you can change the ingredients. Use any kind of potatoes, cheese, peppers tastes great everytime.

Hello Everyone - This is an excellent recipe that makes a great alternative to the good ole standard mashed potato recipe. Not only does the color and texture look good, but it taste great too. I only used one hot pepper and could not taste any spice, but the next time I may use two or three if I want the mixture to be spicy. Don't get me wrong I liked the recipe just the way it is, but sometimes I like to spice things up a little. GREAT RECIPE!!!

These are SO GOOD and fantastically simple to make.  It is a fantastic way to "hide" other vegetables in mashed potatoes, and it's a wonderful way to use new or red potatoes in mashed potatoes.  This has become a regular recipe in my house and everyone loves them!

These were pretty good- a great way to hide more veggies in the food for sure. I guess I'm a traditionalist and just like basic mashed potatoes.

I don't usually like cooked carrots, so I was a little skeptical - but this recipe is fantastic.  Used only Yukon Gold potatoes because that is what I had on hand, but it turned out great!

Like many others. . .I was suprised with how good these potatoes are.  I followed the recipe except I didn't have the jalpeno pepper.  I was going to add sour cream but it didn't see to need it.
It's a keeper.

So creamy and good!  I didn't taste much jalepeno so I may add more next time, or add it later in the cooking.

these were good, but i thought they lacked something. so i added garlic salt, i think i put some sour cream in there too. and i think sweet yellow corn would be better too, but that's just my opinion. all in all i think it's very creative way to make mashed potatoes!

Really good! and different, great way to get kids to eat all their veggies...seeing as how they are all mashed up in the potatoes and it tastes so good!

Easy and Yum!  I just used red potatoes, left out the jalapenos, and added about a quarter cut finely chopped red pepper.  It was yummy on it’s own, but even yummier with some ranch dip thrown on top.

These were good, but I thought they'd have  a bit more "punch".  I was looking for something amazing to come out of this recipe, and it didn't happen.  But they are satisfying and filling.

VERY good.  the only difference i made was i cut fresh corn off the cobb and added leeks.  this was amazing.

oh and a side note, my carrots didn't completely mush into the potato mixture.  i'm not sure if it was supposed to... maybe they should have cooked a little longer?  either way, i have no complaints about this recipe.

I didn't have Yukon potatoes so I used only the red. Wasn't bad but it didn't knock my socks off either. If I make it again, I think I will add some crumbled bacon to give it a kick. Definitely needs more flavor than the recipe calls for.

Awesome.  They look hard but it's really not and whatever work you put into it, is definately worth it.  I added a little sour cream to mix just because I had it on hand.  I'm sure it would have been really good without it too.

This was a nice change from ordinary mashed potatoes. I omitted the jalapeno pepper, since I have a 3 year old who doesn't like spicy things, and the cheese. Tasted great with country gravy!

This was really tasty and I love everything "cowboy"!. I don't know if I can fairly rate this recipe as I omitted the garlic and jalapeno. I also added green peas and sour cream. Next time, I wont put cheese in. I agree with the reviewer above: it ruins the texture. 
This is a keeper for it's simplicity and taste. Thanks

I made this for dinner tonight and in the end, we thought it was just ok.  I used baby white potatoes only, and apart from that, followed the directions exactly.  We could not taste the garlic, jalapeno or carrots (these were primarily for colour).  So next time I make them, I will add more garlic and add the carrots for the last half of the cooking time.

This recipe was yummy to our tummy!  My family and I couldn't get enough of this stuff.  We used a bigger bag of corn and threw in the whole thing to make the dish last longer.  Velveeta Light cheese was used, a slightly healthier alternative.  I can't wait until we share this with more family and friends.

These were ok.  My kids didn't like the corn in it and I didn't use any peppers.  They needed salt even after cooking the spuds in heavily salted water. I won't be making this again.

I never met a potato recipe that I didn't like, but this one is off the scale! When I am stumped for a side dish, I turn to this one. I highly recommend serving these spuds along with steak and a salad-very yummy meal! I made no changes except for scaling down the servings and I use whatever potatoes I have on hand. My hubby says he gives this five stars too so, I guess that makes it a 10 star recipe!

Well after going through all the reviews (as I do with each recipe), I made the following changes:  only used one type of potato (Yukon Gold), left out the jalapeno, used yellow corn, added butter, added extra garlic, doubled the cheese, used beans instead of carrots, added milk for mashing, and added bacon.  After all these changes the only other thing I'd do is reduce the corn then it would be a near perfect recipe.  Only gave it 4*'s as I did make so many changes, but it did taste pretty good once I had done :)

Wonderful! I am not a fan of mashed potatoes, but these were a really fun way to make them. I'd eat these all the time if they weren't so full of calories!

These are great smashed potatoes!  I made 2 small changes though.  I love cream cheese in smashed potatoes, so I added a slab.  And in place of the jalepeno, I used my secret weapon from the freezer.  I freeze the leftover gardinere's or hot pepper mixes you get when you order out an italian beef sandwich or a burrito.  This is a great quick and easy touch of spice/heat to add to a recipe without having to cut anything up!  I just thawed out a little 2 oz. cup of jardinere's and dumped it in with the boiling tater's-oil and all!  They turned out perfect!!

I have made this twice now and it's a keeper.  I don't add the jalapeno pepper and only use Yukon Gold potatoes.  Hint:  If you have a hand blender, it only takes a few seconds to mash it up right in the pot!

good but time consuming.  i like my recipe better i think.  i use 1/2 evaporated milk and 1/2 skim milk and seaon with salt and pepper.  i ALWAYS get rave reviews!  and you can use the remained of the evaporated milk can to make wonderful gravy!

My son was a little hesitant to try mashed potato with God Forbid "Carrots".  But once he had his first bite, he was hooked like all the other guests.  Thank's so much for such a great recipe!!

I thought that they were okay.  It was a good way to sneak in some extra vegetables.  However the flavor didn't "pop" for me.

I just made this recipie and found it to be really good!  I didn't have cheddar-- so I added 5 slices of American cheese-- and that was too much.  BUT, it was still delicious-- just a little runny.  I'll make these again and recommend you try them too!

This tasted very similar to my mom's "cooked together stuff" recipe...only she puts cabbage in hers and it gets all mashed together.  Her philosophy was if you put enough butter on anything it will taste good.  Maybe I'm just having flashbacks of my childhood, but I didn't love this recipe.  I guess it was because I made the effort to go and get the "Yukon Gold" potatoes and it ended up tasting like something I've had before.  I guess I shouldn't complain at least I didn't have to peel the tatoes.

A delicious alternative to traditional mashed potatoes!  The first time I made this recipe, I omitted the jalapeno and corn, but it was still a hit - even with the fussiest members of my family.

I added a little milk to these while mashing- otherwise I think it would be too dry.

Nice, colorful and tasty change to plain mashed. Added nutrition from the carrots is a plus.

I LOVE this! It's easy and delicious. I added a drop of half & half (literally) and half a tbls butter, but I don't think it needed it - these potatoes are so creamy AND not fattening without the added dairy. AWESOME!

What a great way to have mashed potatoes! And without all the sour cream/cream cheese/etc. you usually find that makes them so good.  Definitely a keeper.

What a nice change from plain mashed potatoes.  My family doesn't do spicy so I left out the pepper.

This recipe reminds me of my mother's "Famous Cooked-Together-Stuff".  Which is basically potatoes, carrots, green beans, & corn all mashed together with a lot of butter.  I didn't taste much of the garlic/pepper in the recipe--mostly just butter-which is yummy, BUT....This recipe was good, but not fantastic.

Really good alternative to plain old mashed potatoes.  What a great way to cram alot of veggies in one serving.  Note: made alot more than 4 servings - we had left overs all week.

Very good! I felt more salt need to be added.
