Southern comfort food that's portable. Yum! But c'mon, we knew these would be sooo good just based on the concept, right? So very easy, too. Here's how I followed the recipe to a "T" - subbed my fave Golden Sweet Cornbread from this site (I use GF flour), skipped the papers and sprayed the tin, used leftover pulled pork tenderloin. I didn't taste the cheese much, but my homemade BBQ sauce is pretty spicy and I'm guessing that hid the bite from the cheese. Really, an amazing finger food that I can't wait to serve for a game day sandwich alternative. Thanks for another winner, Chef John!

Really, really yummy!  Has a lot of great elements that we love.  Did the cooking spray trick and that definitely helped.  Fantastic and picnic ready today...thank you.

Skipped the paper liners and just sprayed the muffin tin. I didn't have Jiffy mix either but found an equivalent substitute from scratch from Chef John. This was a good and easy recipe to fix. I put this in my recipe box to fix again.

OMG, are these fabulous!  Used pepperjack/Cheddar combo instead (for the kids), but was still amazing.  Yum, yum, YUM!

We enjoyed this very much. I needed more of this without more hassle so I doubled the entire recipe and doubled the meat filling again (needed it to be a substantial main dish) and put it into a 9x13 pan rather than muffins. I topped the cheese with a healthy does of extra bbq sauce before adding the remaining cornbread. Super good!

I made these muffins for a Kentucky Derby finger food party.  Everyone loved them.  I made six using pulled pork and six using BBQ chicken (because we had some Jewish friends at the party).  To make the BBQ chicken I just shredded a pre cooked Johnsonville Southwest chicken breast and added some bottled BBQ sauce.  I used two different patterned muffin tin liners to easily differentiate between the two meats.  The only change I would make next time is in the directions.  The directions tell you to initially fill the tins half way.  I did not have enough batter to do that and cover the filling.  I recommend just putting in enough batter to cover the bottom of the tin before putting on the BBQ meat and then judiciously cover each filling.

These were good, but when I baked cheese on top of the muffin for 20 minutes, it was hard as a rock.  Next time, I will not top them with cheese.

I have had these at a county fair. They were topped with cole slaw and an additional scoop of the bbq sauced pulled pork. Absolutely delicious!

I used the "Grandmas Buttermilk Corn Bread" recipe found on this website (yum!) and Jack Daniels Pulled Pork, 16oz,  and followed the directions beyond that. Mine did not turn out cute. I probably added too much pork. I also had trouble telling when the bottom cornbread layer was fully cooked.  They turned out ok, but I think it would be better if the cornbread was on the side.

Great way to use leftover pulled pork!! I made these for guests as appetizers while I was smoking some ribs. Everyone loved them!

It was very good. But I didn’t use the recipe, just the idea. I made Quaker corn muffins and used some leftover shredded pork from the pork loin roast I made with pumpkin butter (another Allrecipes). Very easy to make and could substitute many other meats.

These are over-the-top good!  Don't worry if the remaining batter doesn't fully cover the pork.  The recipe only made 8 muffins so next time I will double the recipe.  The leftovers work really well for work lunches.  I sprinkled a bit of shredded cheddar on top before baking and the cheese browned very nicely.

Don't use a honey cornbread mix.  That was probably my mistake, but it turned out too sweet for us.

Worked perfectly with cheese inside but still really no cheese flavor. It sealed perfectly and tasty regardless. Thank you.

This is one of the best lemons to lemonade recipes I've seen on here. Great find.
