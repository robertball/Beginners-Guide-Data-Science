This pear bread recipe is a must to have especially if you have a pear tree in your yard.  I add two cups of chopped pears and my B&B guests love it.  Also I take my cinnamon and sugar shaker and sprinkle it on the sprayed oiled loaf pan and that makes it even more yummy.  Gable House B&B, Durango, Co.

I did this bread without the cloves (we are just not fans of clove around here).  I also used freshly grated ginger, quite a bit of it...like maybe a couple of tablespoons.  It was very tasty.  I thought the taste improved after a couple of days so when I make this again, I will make a couple days in advance to let the flavors blend.  Nice recipe, easy to put together.

These are delicious! I made these as muffins and they came out great. Used two pears and added 1/2 cup of walnuts. Yummi!

This is delicious, and it smells amazing, as it's baking. I used somewhere between 1-2 tablespoons of fresh ginger in place of the dried stuff. I replaced the oil with applesauce, eggs with 1/3 cup egg white, and whole wheat flour to lighten the recipe. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, then had to add 10 minutes to the baking time, for it was not yet done after 40 minutes. It came out of oven looking really good, nicely browned, but it was actually too moist, a comment I've never made before, resulting in a soggy bread, and we did not like the taste of it.

This just came out of my oven and it is amazing! I used a drained can of pears instead of fresh pears and just mashed them with a fork. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly!

This actually tastes pretty decent, but it didn't turn out great because I left it in the oven for a little bit too long. I didn't have ginger or cloves so I added pumpkin spice and nutmeg instead, and made cupcakes instead of a loaf of bread. I put them in for about 27 minutes at 325 degrees and they came out a little too brown, but still tasted pretty good.

Halved the cloves (hubby not a fan) but followed the recipe other than that.  I was surprised at how good this was.  Wonderful toasted with a bit of butter too.  Definitely going to make this one again.

This was delicious! I had a couple of pears that were a little too ripe and searched for a recipe on here and found this one. It turned out better than expected. I substituted apple sauce for the oil but otherwise made it as written. This is a keeper!

Made this three times so far and really love it, so moist and tasty.  I use the can pears that come in halfs and cut them into smaller cube size pieces.  I also make a second batch each time substituting smooshed bananas for the pears (and adding 1/4 cup water) for a great tasting banana ginger bread.  I don't like things too sweat so for the pear ginger bread I just squirt in a little honey instead of adding white sugar and for the banana ginger bread, I do not add any sugar or honey.  My family keeps asking me to make it again.

Excellent! Wonderfully light in texture and very moist. Nice ginger flavor. Very mild pear flavor. Due to personal preference  instead of 1/3c oil and 2eggs, I used 1egg and 1/2c lowfat yoghurt (based on general recommendations of yoghurt replacement: 1cup vege oil with 3/4c yoghurt; 1egg with 1/4c yoghurt). This may have made my bread less dense but I doubt changed flavor much. Saving this basic receipe to remake as is and also try as banana or zucchini bread. Thank you!

Really good. I made it exactly as the recipe is, I may substitute cinnamon for cloves next time, but I don't really think it would be better. Definitely, a keeper!

Great recipe!  I doubled the amounts so I could make two loaves.  The cake is really moist.  I had to bake for 15 minutes longer as they weren't baked in the centre after 40 minutes.

Very easy to make. Pears were home grown and frozen in 2 cup batch so adjusted recipe accordingly. Next time, I will add more ginger! At least 1.2 tsp of ginger instead of 1/2 tsp. Needs a little more taste to the bread. 

Will definitely make this again!

We loved it. Next time 2 loaves. I want to experiment and see how it freezes. Of course with the pears it is a very moist bread. We also added toasted almonds.

I made it with fresh ginger and the flavor was definitely enhanced.   Very good bread and I'm a novice at cooking.  We are definitely eating this with coffee and tea in the morning and evening.

Delicious.  It took an extra 15 minutes using a glass pan.  I used 2 whole pears, cut into 1/2" pieces.

I doubled the recipe and blend the pears into a liquid, & used my wheat-free all-purpose baking mix which is a mix of almond flour, flaxseed, coconut flour & baking soda. (See William Davis’s recipe book: Wheat Belly 30minute recipe book). 
With the alternate wheat free flour, the bread came out super moist and delicious.
Next time, I am going to omit the cloves and ginger.: I didn’t really care for those spices.

I used fresh ginger and substituted 1/2 applesauce for oil.  Next time I will add an extra 1/2 c. of flour, see if it rises a little more.  It was very tasty.

I made this bread with canned pears and freshly grated ginger, as well as without the cloves, and while the texture came out great, it wasn't as flavorful as I expected. Unfortunately, the flavor of baking soda was overpowering, so I think next time I would use a little less, and come up with a way to make the other flavors punch a little more.

I loved it and plan to make it again. I substituted allspice for cloves. Next time I'll add more spices and reduce the salt to 1/4 or maybe even 1/8 tsp.

Too salty. With a delicate flavor like pear, the salty is way too overpowering and hides the pear flavor. Next time I might try taking some canned pears, pureeing them and using that instead of half the oil. And cut the salt out completely. It also didn't taste at all like the spices, but that is probably because my ground ginger was old. The cloves were fresh ground, so maybe I will add more of the cloves.

This was so simple, quick, and easy.  I made this on a Saturday for Sunday breakfast.  We spread mascarpone on it.  It came out moist, light, and not overly sweet.  Perfection.  I substituted 1/2 cup loosely packed brown sugar for the white sugar and 1 cup white whole wheat flour for the 1 cup AP flour. This is going into my permanent recipe box!

I substituted whole wheat flour and a 1/4 honey for sugar. It is a huge hit!!!!

I had two big delicious pears left but their time was running out and I didn't want to toss them. This is by far the best way I could find to use them. I ran out of flour so I replaced 1/2 cup with ground oatmeal I had at hand. I also used egg substitute. Apart from that I followed the measures exactly (even 1/2 tsp salt, which looked a bit suspicious at first). Absolute perfection.

This bread is so good! Only change I made was I had to use canola instead of vegetable oil because that was what I had on hand. I live at a high altitude so I had to bake it an extra 5 minutes and it turned out perfectly. So moist and very flavorful! I shared the recipe with all of my Facebook friends.

This just came out of the oven and it smells amazing. I probably added a little more pear then called for (I doubled the recipe and just cut up two large pears from my tree) and I also added some candied ginger (small dice) into the flour before adding it to the pear/oil/egg mixture. I had to bake it for about 25 minutes longer then the recipe called for. But, with a little shuffling around in my oven half way through, it didn't get over done at the edges. After letting it fully cool... this is delicious. Seriously one of the best quick breads ever.

I followed the recipe, then had to add 15 mins to the baking time. It was really moist and soft, my husband thought it needed more ginger ..but i liked it the way it was.

This is a great way to use up ripe pears! I used about 5-6 very ripe pears which made 2 cups once peeled and diced. Did take longer than 40 minutes to bake on 350f but worth the wait. It was delicious with the chunks of pear visible when the loaf is sliced. This recipe is a keeper!

I had received some pears in a gift basket for Christmas, and decided to make bread from some of them. I ended up having to bake a little longer than stated as I had four loaf pans in the oven, but they turned out AMAZING! I was even able to give two of them as gifts, and was told how delicious they were. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was good.  I substituted butter for the oil and 4 egg whites for the eggs.  It just made a really really small loaf.
