I liked these. Yes, I had to add about another 1/2 cup of oats which just yielded more cookies, but there's nothing wrong with that. I added dried cranberries. I thought they were delicious. Will definitely make again.

Agreed with the need to add more “dry” ingredients so mixed in dry peanut butter powder, more oats, and 1 tsp of nutmeg. Tasted yummy!!

Very nice-tasting cookies. I added a few tablespoons of Carbquik to thicken them a bit and more vanilla, just according to my taste. The 2 bananas and honey give enough sweetness without adding granulated sugar.

If you have a sweet tooth at all, these cookies will not satisfy. Even though I added extra oats,  cinnamon and vanilla, and chocolate chips, they were VERY bland. The texture and consistency were off as well. I think from now on I’ll just make cookies the way they were meant to be made (with flour, sugar, and butter) and limit myself to ONE a day.

Followed as written. I left the batter sit for 15 minutes to allow the oatmeal to absorb moisture, after reading reviews. Good cookie for me, but 3 littles didn’t like the the softness. Darn!

Just took out of the oven and they are so good. I did add about 1/2 cup more oats and about 2 tablespoons of coconut flour as the batter was a bit thin. Also some nuts and more cinnamon. Let it sit a few minutes. Really good.

Good healthy recipe, but definitely add raisins or chocolate chips because they are very bland if you just make them plain. Also, I had to add an extra half cup of oats to my cookies because the dough was too soft to be formed into little balls.

This is a great healthy recipe. I did add some chocolate chips. The only problem I had had was that it was too liquidy so I doubled everything but the milk and eggs and it worked out great.

These are great!  I added 1/4 cup more oats but if you let them rest 10 min or so before baking, a lot of the moisture is absorbed by the oats and this prevents them from drying out when you cook. They are a bit plain if you just follow the recipe so I will for sure add peanut butter and maybe even a few choc chips or cranberries next time. Great grab and go breakfast or mid day snack!

As noted by other reviews, these cookies came out very watery so I added more oats as suggested.  They are a very soft, chewy cookie even after adding the additional oats.  No one in my house liked them very much.  They were more like a granola bar than a cookie.

I agree that batter was too runny. I also added extra oats. I also felt the cooking time was too short. I did add some mini chocolate chips and chopped walnuts. Its a good flour free recipe.

added a bit of almond flour, it may have been runny because I used unprocessed oats, also needed a tad more honey than called for. added walnuts and raisins, will make again, thank you for this clean recipe.

These are good. I added some peanut butter. The batter is thin but they firmed up in the oven. They are lighter than some other healthy oatmeal cookies I've tried.

I made these and modified (adding more oats, honey, cinnamon, chocolate chips, and walnuts) based on several comments. It still didn't taste that good. Maybe the bananas weren't that good to start with? Will try it again next time with different bananas and see.

I really like these.  Didn't use any milk.  Added 1/4 cup more of oats.  Added peanut butter,  dark chocolate chips,  and vanilla.  Used a cookie scooper and they turned out nice.  Hubby wasn't crazy about them,  but they satisfy my sweet tooth and chocolate craving.  Will definitely make again.

Doesn't taste like cookies but more like a quickbread.  Did not make any adjustments to the recipe.  Like the idea that it's clean without sugar or flour.  If I make again, will probably modify the recipe.

I intended to make this exactly as written, except when I finished stirring it together, I had to add more oatmeal -- the result was too loose to form a cookie.  I added half a cup of oatmeal.  These are great for someone trying to lose weight.  I have them for breakfast with a drinkable yogurt.  I am looking for a breakfast or snack cookie that is low in calories and high in nutrition, but I think there may be tastier options.  I don't dislike these, they just don't ring my bell.

I was very disappointed in this recipe - they tasted quite bland, and needed much more sweetening of some kind. Like others, I increased the oats by 1/2 and let them rest briefly to absorb, and I added 2 Tbsp of peanut butter. 

I should have perhaps doubled the honey, or added at least a Tbsp of brown sugar. I'm not sure these can be saved. Perhaps heating them slightly in the microwave, misting some water on top, then sprinkling sugar? Else I grind them up and use them as an ingredient in something else.

Love these! Crisp on the outside but tender on the inside. I did add 1 cup of oats that I ground up to the mixture and another 1/2 cup of whole oats along with 1/2 cup dark choc chips and 1/2 cup raisins. I needed something sweet and healthy as I’m watching my sugar and these did the trick. Thank you! Will be making these again.

These cookies turned out great and I’ll definitely make again.  I made minor ingredient changes: doubled the amount of vanilla, and added 1/2 cup walnut halves.  I put all ingredients in my food processor and processed until smooth.  Finally,  I added another 1/2 cup of whole oats and stirred in.  The 15 min baking time was right for my convection oven and I felt that these cookies have a good texture.   I will try some of the earlier reviewer’s additions, such as adding nutmeg, raisins/dried cranberries, etc.

These were great and I agree to add more oats. I added a couple tbsp of crunchy peanut butter and it was Awesome. Clue, add 1/4 tsp of salt so they have a little more flavor and they won’t disappoint. Great recipe thanks so much for sharing!

These are really good cookies!  Very runny without extra oats. I added 1 cup of oats that I ground into flour and still added another cup of oats. I also added chocolate chips and dried cranberries. Chocolate makes everything better!

These turned out really well and were very easy. However, I did add chocolate chips for my husband. Might not have been as great for him without the chips but would’ve been fine for me. Next time I will leave out the chips. I didn’t have an egg, so I used flaxseed meal, and I used to soymilk, and I did add more oatmeal. And I cooked them a little longer.  This is an R (repeat).

Was not a fan. Didn't realize that they would turn brown, in the refrigerator, after a day.

Very simple recipe to follow and produces a chewy, just-sweet-enough cookie. I added raisins and doubled the quantity of oats and it’s a keeper!

Very easy and simple dish.Since I don't like frozen green beans I sub'ed fresh, amd  I added two cloves of garlic minced, and found the need to add salt and a bit of black pepper at the end. All in all, very tasty - will make often.

Kids loved them! I had to add 2 1/2 cups of oats, but one banana was huge and the other was small...

I just made those and we all love them. I followed the advice and milk and didn't add any and they turned out perfect (I used all remaining ingredients as listed in the recipe). I used cranberries and raisins. Next time I will add some nuts :)

Next time I'll try one of the options in the Cook's Notes: coconut or peanut butter, probably.  I even wonder about tiny chunks of apple.

I loved it! I also added about 1/2 cup oats and some chocolate chips. I was (pleasantly) surprised about the cakey texture of the cookies. Thanks for the recipe!

I doubled the recipe, excluded the milk and only used one egg. I also added nutmeg and more cinnamon and vanilla extract for the extra sweet. Next time I’m adding chocolate chips! Excellent clean recipe.

I had to add more oats because it was too runny. I imagine the ratio of oats to bananas is dependent on how large your bananas are. The two I used were about 10” and really ripe. Other than that, great recipe! These cookies had a cake-like texture, which I found quite pleasant.

Very good cookie, I learned alot from making this...you don't need flour or baking soda or butter.  Making this recipe I had plenty of soft batter, so I didn't use the milk and it still came out great...I don't know what the milk would have done.

The batter was very wet; I ended up doubling the oats. I also added dried cranberries and some extra spice, which saved the batch because there really wasn't a lot of flavor. I plan to try other banana oatmeal cookie recipes.

Edit: they taste better the second day; the banana and spice comes out.  However, I still think it needs some adjustments.

Good start but milk is not needed. I waited to add it after reading the reviews and still needed to add extra oats and flour to thicken it up.
