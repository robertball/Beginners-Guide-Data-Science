Perfect PB&B cookies!  I used 1/2 cup butter instead, with 2 good sized bananas & 1 large egg, which seemed to be a good PB to B ratio and it made the dough more like Peanut Butter Cookie dough... So I dropped them by rounded tablespoon, then flattened them & sprinkled with cinnamon sugar, per someone else's suggestion.  Oh yeah, at the beginning I pureed the bananas with the butter and added a little honey, then stirred in the other stuff...using 1/2 dark brown & 1/2 light brown sugar.  Turned out great!

I made these cookies for my boyfriend who is obsessed with Elvis. They turned out good, although the banana taste was a bit overpowering. I made a second batch with a half banana less and I added milk chocolate chips and those tasted great!

This recipe has a lot of potential! I put one cup creamy peanut butter and 1/2 a cup of crunchy. Also added 1/4 cup more flour and an egg! Added three or four minutes cook time and they're a hit! The King would've been proud!!

WAY to much butter!  I was using two ovens and because there was so much batter, by the time I got down to the last batch they came out greasy and flat and I wound up throwing these away.  I gave these three stars only because the first few batches were ok and my grandson, who doesn't eat much, ate at least 8 of them.  He loved them!  If I make these again I will cut the recipe in half and decrease the butter - probably in half.

I have also been searching for banana cookie recipe with the taste of bananas.  This is the one.  For those wondering about the name, I would guess these are named after Elvis' favorite snack, peanut butter and banana sandwiches.

I am a big fan of penut butter and banana.  I used butter flavored Crisco instead of butter to keep the cookies from sreading so much.  I also added chocolate chips.  I am keeping a stash in the freezer just for me.

These were pretty good, but could be tweaked a little. The batter tasted better than the cookies, even though the cookies were good too. I'm not sure what is needed though, so I know the review isn't very helpful. But, I do intend to play with it some. These flavors are too delicious together to be left alone!

These took about 15-16 minutes in my oven.  (At 10, then 12 minutes, they weren't done in the middle.)  Don't try to put too many on the sheet, because they expand and then won't cook as well. Once I worked out the kinks, though, they were fine.  My husband liked the flavor.

These cookies didn't spread out for me, so they didn't cook all the way through even with longer baking time. I like banana,but they over powered the cookies.

This recipe makes mighty big cookies! I fallowed the recipe exactly, and then I added chocolate chips. I separated into 24 drops on the cookie sheets, and the cookies came as big as 3.5-4" in circumference. But they're really delicious!

Let me start out by saying READ THE REVIEWS BEFORE MAKING! When I was done mixing dough it was very fluffy and I re-read ingredients several times to figure out what I missed because it just didn't look right. After baking the first batch i was convinced I was throwing all dough in trash. My husband walked in and he ate one for me. He said "it's not bad." So I kept baking. I baked for 10-11 mins but left on sheet for almost 10 mins to finishing baking before removing. They were still soft but not near as gooey. They at least didn't fall through the cookie racks. This cookie is VERY greasy! I ended up adding quick 1 minute oatmeal to remaining better. I just eye balled it and baked one sheet. After that batch I added more oatmeal. It made it better and seemed to cut down on the over powering banana taste. In the end, the cookie still fell apart in my hand while eating. I was baking for the holidays to put in my cookie baskets that I give and I am still not sure if I will include these. I was wondering if you could make these like Buckeye's? Peanut butter and chocolate is yummy and bananas and chocolate are a good combo together , so perhaps this would be good ( of course without oatmeal which I added to recipe).

i wish they had 1/2 stars! i would have given this recipe 3 1/2 stars instead. these cookies were just ok. i thought they were very, very chewy. not the consistency i had expected. i thought the taste was good, but i wouldve liked more chocolate chips- 1/4 cup is barely even worth it. might as well just leave them out (or add 1/2 cup like i did for the second batch). overall, a good recipe, but i dont think i'll make these again. TIP: put a piece of bread in with the cookies and they will become softer overnight. that might help the overly-chewy-ness.

These were very good cookies, and it got a ton of compliments. My 18 month old toddler couldn't stop grunting for more of these. The Elvis cookies will definitely become a regular in our house!

This is a pretty good cookie with a little tweaking.  As other reviewers suggested I cut the butter to 1/2 cup and added an egg. I also decreased the sugar to 1 cup of light brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar. I did need to bake my cookies 20 minutes but that could be because I made mine pretty large. I also flattened my cookies since I added an egg and decreased the butter I knew they wouldn't spread as much. Overall they were pretty good but I think next time I make them I will further decrease the sugar as I felt they were a bit too sweet.

We obviously did something wrong, or the serving calculator miscalculated.  We changed the yield to 50 to double the batch.  We have already baked 60 and have enough batter for another 60.  The bottoms are burning while the tops are just barely getting done.  My niece loved the flavor, but the rest of us were not impressed.  My nephew gave them 5 stars for the entertainment value of listening to us mix it all up....he is afraid to taste them.  Sorry, but it appears Elvis has left this building...and he should have taken his cookies with him.

Yikes - my son and I made these and the dough was so gooey that we put it in fridge for and hour or so - it was so gooey so we added rice cripies to absorb the gooiness.  Once baked they were all sticky (stuck together in my cookie jar) but at the same time they crumbled everytime we touched them.  Flavour was good, the texture was not right-perhaps my bananas were too large (no actual measured size in recipe) but I'm a pretty good cookie maker and I'm not sure I would make these again.

Very good! The only reason it is a 4 star is because it definately needs to be baked a little longer than 10 minutes...as others have also said. Other than that, the cookie is soo yummy! :)

I made a similar recipe that I got from my local newspaper...which called for crispy crumbled bacon with the other ingredients...the taste was yummy!  But the cookie itself was very gooey even after I baked them longer than the recipe called for...is it because of the combo of oily PB with the banana?

They tasted good, and it was a good idea. But why did some of them turn out flat? A lot of them did, the ones that werent flat had big banana chunks in them. But just a warning, dont eat to many...or you'll be sitting on the can!!

These cookies were ok. I folded in hershey chocolate pieces. This recipe does not call for eggs...maybe the reason they turned out flat and not fluffy.

This recipe has potential but definitely needs tweaking. First there is way too much sugar. I don't know any other recipes that have 3 cups of sugar in them. I would do one cup of brown sugar and one white. Maybe even a bit less. The dough was also too wet. You could either add less butter(maybe 1/2 cup instead) OR more flour. I also put in about 1/2 cup less peanut butter because it generally has a very strong taste in baking. I would try this recipe again with these differences and see if that helps because the overall taste was good.

I would have given this a five, but I had some serious cooking time issues.  The recipe said 10 minutes but I was leaving mine in for about 5 minutes longer, which was really surprising, because my oven runs hot and I usually have to watch everything I put in there.  I did tweak it a little:
I pre-blended my bananas with about 1/4c honey to add another layer of flavor.  I also sprinkled cinnamon sugar over the top of the cookies before I baked them.  Delicious cookie.

SO glad I read the reviews! I give 5 stars for the modified recipe! I used 1/2 cup butter, 1cup brown sugar, 1 cup white sugar and added an egg. I also added chocolate chips to half the batter and chilled the dough before baking.  Ended up baking them for about 16 minutes until cooked through and golden on the edges. They came out moist, delicious and with a balanced flavor! I really like it with the chocolate :) Thanks to others for the tips on the changes needed to make this a great recipe!

They tasted good, but came out very thin. I used 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tbsp vanilla and 2 large bananas. I made 1/2 batch plain and added mini choc chips to other half. I actually liked them without the choc chips better. I may try adding a little extra flour next time to see if I can get them thicker.

So I love sweets but I'm trying to watch my sugar intake. For this recipe I substituted applesauce for the butter and honey for both sugars. I also used oats instead of flour. So they're baking now and hopefully turn out delicious. Thanks for this awesome recipe.

The flavor is good but as others have pointed out, the texture needs some work.  After making these I found another recipe for Elvis cookies so kind of mashed the 2 together with some tweaks and came out with a cookie that everyone seems to love.   For those who want to stick with this recipe alone try adding more flour.   I ended up using 3 1/2 - 4 cups of flour, only 1 cup of pb, 1 T vanilla, added in 2 teaspoons salt, 2 T molasses, 1 1/4 c chocolate chips, 3/4 cups broken pretzels and a pound of  crumbled crispy bacon.  I made the cookies small and ended up with about 125.  It's not a healthy recipe by any means, but a small cookie is a nice little indulgence.  I took them to a church function and they disappeared.

Added chocolate chips because, well why not? They turned out a little big the first batch. So I refrigerated the dough before the next batch and they were perfect.

I didn't like this recipe.. it was waaay too wet, just adding "bananas" instead of an actual size was probably the issue. Turned out very bland, so I added dark cacao and it gave it a zing without any more sweetness.

Really good!!  The combo of PB and banana is yummy!  I snuck in some coconut, and used sugar sub in place of the white sugar, turned out great!

Definitely too much banana...I would use 1/2 the amount of banana, because the banana flavor was way over powering.  We couldn't even taste the peanut butter.  I added some chopped walnuts & chocolate morsels (use the minis).  Plus it needs to cook for longer.  Kids thought they were okay, but not their favorite.  If I make it again, I will try the changes recommended by other people.

These cookies are just okay. They are good for using up over-ripe bananas, but they do have a different kind of flavor. I used less butter, and less sugar after reading reviews. My kids like them, but I won't make them more than a few times a year.

These were great. I increased the cooking time to 15 minutes and they were nice and thin and slightly chewy. I ran out of white flour so I used mostly whole wheat and they were great! I want to try them with chocolate chips.

I made these the other night, but unlike the other reviewers, I thought the banana taste was too weak. I also added a bag of mild chocolate/peanut butter chips though, so maybe that's why I tasted so much peanut butter. Regardless, this recipe is a great one!

I love Elvis and bannana and peanut butter.....but in a cookie...not so much.  The recipe was fine, it was the taste that was not great.  The unbaked dough tasted way better than the baked cookie.

A COOKIE RECIPE USES EGGS & THIS ONE DIDN'T CALL FOR ANY SO I ADDED 2 EGGS. THE COOKIES CAME OUT FLAT, STICKY, & FELL APART. BUT MY HUSBAND SAVED ME BY MAKING MUFFINS WITH THE MIX.
