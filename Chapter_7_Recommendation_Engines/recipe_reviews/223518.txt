I made these as written the first time and they were very good!  

I have modified them to use less sugar though. I use coconut flour for the 1/2 cup GF flour so I use whole eggs (all 6), 1/2 cup coconut oil instead of  butter, added GF vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp each baking soda and cream of tartar & only 1/2 cup granulated sugar.  The amount of sugar was too much for my tastes. Thanks for a good recipe.

Not bad.  I'm always looking for alternative ways to make Gluten Free foods.  My blog offers many variations of ways to bake.  I use almond meal sparingly, only because it is pricey.  But overall I love to bake with it.  For more ideas visit: http://www.glutenfreemiracles.com

I really like how these turned out.  Light and fluffy.  They are a bit too sweet so I will decrease the sugar next time.  These are my adjustments to the recipe for what I had in my kitchen at the time.  I used 1 cup of coconut flour and half cup of potato starch, 1 tsp of xanthan gum.  I also beat my egg whites till they were stiff then folded them in till just mixed.

Delicious! Everyone loved them! My brother in law is now gluten free so finding stuff that I can bake for him was a challenge and this turned out to be fairly easy! It was closer to 30 minutes baking time for where I live, but other than that it turned out great!

This was a super easy recipe to make and the muffins taste delicious, though I did modify the recipe based on others' reviews. 
First off, I used my USA mini muffin pan. It's fantastic because you don't need muffin liners or greasing of any kind. 
I used only 1/2 cup of granulated sugar (which I might reduce to 1/3 cup next time as they are plenty sweet)
I reduced the butter to 2/3 cup, but could probably reduce it a smidge further. 
And lastly, I used Namaste Perfect Blend GF flour. This blend is so close to regular flour and I'm very happy with it in most of my baked goods. 
I baked it all at 375 for 13 minutes and they came out perfectly. ( I live at sea level so you may need to adjust if you're at higher altitudes)
They're a little sweet and really moist and tender. This is going into my regular muffin rotation.

Used slightly less butter just to ease the guilt. ;) "BakerB" is correct, these are definitely little cakes shaped like muffins. They are wonderful! I made them to take on a long car ride with a friend who is gluten-intolerant but you know ... they take about 2 seconds to mix together ... so ... I'm pretty sure I will make them pretty often for myself too.  Thanks for submiting this recipe.

3 year old approved! Yum these are perfect but I did use frozen blueberries I let defrost a few hours.  Thanks for sharing, it's already hard enough to find stuff he can eat without milk and wheat. This is a keeper!

My almond meal had gone bad, so I used coconut flour instead. They were similar in taste and texture to a scone. The batter was heavy, so the blueberries didn't sink in, but still delicious!

This was well-received by my gluten-free husband and my non-GF (and picky)kids.  I will make it again, but will decrease the butter a bit.  The muffins came out a little too moist and there was melted butter all around the top of the muffin pan.

I use the gluten free flour combi on this site along with only 1/2cup icing sugar, 2/3 cup of. butter (150g)  and making a mistake of not beating the egg white first. Baked at 20mins and it came out well! Fluffy! The TOP of the muffin is little crusty so maybe next round, I will toothpick test at a few mins earlier and reduce butter to 120g. Will make again!

Made it exactly as stated in silicone muffin cups. Placing the blueberries on top does work!

I didn't have almond meal, so  tried it with oatmeal.  The substitution worked!

Also, I used whole eggs instead of just egg whites.   I wasn't sure how much to use, and tried 4 - WAY too much.  You could probably get by with two instead.  

I have had many gluten-free recipe failures, but this one works!  It's sinfully delicious :)

I was surprised how moist this recipe turned out, since there is no milk added! I had to change the sugar to 1/2 cup coconut sugar due to dietary restrictions. they baked for 20 minutes and turned out well.

We in the UK are not used to measuring in cups so it made for some interesting translations. I used 1/2 a cup of "Caster Sugar" as recommended by other reviews and cut down the butter a bit. We could buy both "Plain" or "Self Raising" gluten free flour so I went with the "Self Raising". The results were very good. We all loved them. I will definitely make them again.

I used light butter and splenda sugar blend. we are diebetic and have found out that using this helps. I did use less splenda blend I needed to use going by the package label, but as I use it all the time I know to use less too sweet other wise only 3/4 cup  suggested and I used 2/3 cup. Was sooo good just loved it and so did my husband.

We try a lot of gluten free muffins and these have been our favorite so far.  I have modified it using Kamut for the gluten free flour and Sucanat for the sugar.
