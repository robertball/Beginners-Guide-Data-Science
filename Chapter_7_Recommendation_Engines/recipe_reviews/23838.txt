Loved it. I didn't have some things, so I improvised. Used fresh minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I didn't have green pepper,so I left it out. I took the advice of other reviews and cut the sugar down. I added two tablespoons at a time, and it tasted right after about 6 tablespoons of sugar. I will make this again.

Followed recommendations and cut the sugar (1/2 cup), but it was still too sweet.  Also, I used fresh garlic because it's much more flavorful than the powder.  

Might try this recipe again, but I'll add 2 TBS of sugar, wait 10 minutes and taste.  Then I'll add 1 TBS of sugar and repeat till it tastes "just right".

I made this sauce tonight for my family.  My husband always says that my spaghetti sauce is missing something and he isn't sure what...until I made this sauce!  He tasted it and said that all it needed now was pasta!  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I did use only 1/4 c. sugar; minced garlic; fresh oregano; and instead of the tomato sauce, I used a 28oz can of 'chunky crushed tomatos w/ basic, garlic and oregano plus one small can of plain tomato sauce and the tomato paste and a vermouth cooking wine.

Love it, sugar amount was perfect, that is why it is called "Sweet" spaghetti.  Sweet spaghetti has been in our family for many years, we use 2lbs beef and 1 cut of sugar --- hummy....

This is a good one...I used any left over wine.. Instead of just oregano I used Italian seasoning. Added 1 tbsp minced garlic. Decreased the sugar to 1/4 of a cup. And used 1/2 lb Italian sausauge instead of the bacon..I have been making this for years...Sooo yummy!

This was a great recipe, although I had to reduce the sugar to 2 Tbsp. I used fresh sliced mushrooms instead of the canned ones and added two tomatoes. Thanks!

My kids gave this "thumbs-up"!  I was a little leary of the 3/4 cup of sugar and went a little shy of that, but when I make it next time I'll use the full amount.  I also used fresh mushrooms instead of jarred.  We are definitely keeping this recipe!!

This is a FANTASTIC spaghetti sauce.  The wine is a great touch-- I actually used red wine.  It's sweet but with an interesting bite of spicy.  Terrific!

I tried it for the first time tonight and everyone loved it. However, I did modify it a bit. I did not put the bacon drippings in because the thought just bothered me. I also used half the amount of white wine (1/4 cup) and I used about 3 to 4 tablespoons of sugar (our family does not like really sweet food) and it came to the perfect amount of sweetness. I also used fresh garlic and fresh mushrooms as well. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I added fresh garlic and fresh mushrooms instead of the garlic powder and mushrooms in a jar.  It was tasty but much too sweet for us. I do want to make it again but I will cut back on the sugar.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good for homemade taste. Added a pound of fresh mushrooms quartered. I doubled all of the ingredients including the bacon. Drained all of the bacon drippings except for what I needed to just coat the pan and added 2 cans of diced tomatoes for texture and only used 1-8 oz can of tomato sauce, and 2 cans of tomato paste. I used 2.5 lbs of lean ground beef and still only kept the sugar at 1/4 cup, which is plenty. Also, used 8 cloves of minced garlic when browning the beef and the vegetables. Thanks for the recipe.

With a little less sugar, this could be a better recipe. The sugar overpowered the taste for me.

This was good but I like sweet sauces.  I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 and found that it was still very sweet but not too overpowering. While this was good, I probably would not be in a rush to make this again.

WAY TOO SWEET!!! I would have given this 3.5 stars but that wasn't an option. I wish that I followed what the other reviewers has said about the sugar, but I didn't. I am all for having a sweeter spaghetti sauce, I love anything sweet! But this was ridiculously sweet. I think I have a cavity now! Next time I will only add maybe 1/4 cup instead. I also added 1 can of drained diced tomatoes, to add more texture. This was a great starter recipe, but in need of changes for my taste! Thanks.

I added 1 lb of Italian sausage and used fresh mushrooms instead of canned. Used the entire 3/4 cup of sugar and did not find the sauce to be too sweet for us. Still felt the sauce lacked flavor.

So made this and it was amazing I did take a few tomatoes and chop them up and threw them in there. I always tripled it. After making it I let it simmer on low covered all day I did put a couple more cans of tomato paste to gain color since I did triple it. Instead of canning it I put it in pint jars and froze it. It came out just as amazing. I highly recommend this just with less sugar like everyone is saying when I tripled it I only but a cup and a half.

Made this tonight and followed the recipe exactly as written. I should have listened to previous reviewers who recommended decreasing the amount of sugar. I went with the full amount because I really, really like sweet pasta sauce. This was way to sweet though. I could only eat a small amount before tossing it. I will make again though with less sugar. I will also drain the beef after browsing and maybe use something other than the white wine as I wasn't a fan of the flavor from that either.

Great recipe, after reading other reviews I added the sugar a Tablespoon at a time and ended up with a total of 1/4 cup sugar. Anymore and it would have been to sweet for my family. I did add 2 onions and cut back the oregano to 1 teaspoon. I love onions but am not fond of oregano. Thank you so much for this recipe.

This was great! After reading the reviews, I followed the recipe, with the exception of the sugar. I found that 2 tablespoons of sugar was enough. I have to add that even my kids liked this sauce, and that is a first! They hate spaghetti sauces as a rule. Thank you, Pam, for this wonderful recipe.

Me and my girlfriend made this spaghetti recipe about 5 times now. And we're still going to keep making it. It is delicious and easy. I do agree with other users about lowering the sugar of the recipe.

This was the best sauce recipe I've found! Thanks so much. My home-from-college daughter gave it rave reviews. The only changes I made were marjoram instead of oregano, marjoram is sweeter and milder than oregano which can be overpowering. I also used a little less sugar but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Delicious!
