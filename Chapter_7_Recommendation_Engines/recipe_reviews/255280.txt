This is the first new recipe I've followed without at least one tweak and I won't change a thing when I make it again.  Excellent recipe.

I made it as directed except put the package in my crockpot with the timer set for 12 hours.  I put a couple inches of water in the bottom to make sure the stoneware would be okay.  One of the best pork roasts we’ve ever had

I used a commercial rub that I use for pork, and injected the muscle with a mixture of apple juice and Worcestershire sauce.  I then wrapped the roast and placed in the refrigerator until the next day.  The next evening, after allowing the roast to come up to room temperature, I put it in the pellet grill at 11:00 pm and let it smoke overnight at 150 degrees. At 8:00 am the next morning, I raised the grill temperature to 225 degrees and let it slow cook until it reached an internal temperature of 195 degrees, about eight hours. I then placed it in an unheated oven for an hour.  When I unwrapped it, the packaging was full of juice and the meat was fall-apart tender. We ate it straight on a plate, on a bun, with and without barbecue sauce. It was excellent, well worth the effort.

This recipe made good pulled pork, but not better, and maybe not as good as several other recipes I’ve use from allrecipes. I followed the recipe and instructions exactly except that I cooked the wrapped roast in a slow cooker instead of the oven, after reading Barbara Bodin’s review indicating that she tried both ways and it came out the same. (Thanks, Barbara, for sharing this valuable tidbit!) The 14 hour calculated cook time for my 8 lb roast was just right for the slow cooker, which I set on high for the first 5 hours then reduced to the low setting for the remaining 9 hours. Be sure to wrap your roast so that the foil seal is on the fatty side, then place fatty, sealed side up in the slow cooker to keep most of the drippings inside the wrappings. A nice side benefit of wrapping is easy crockpot cleanup!

Perfect just the way it's written. I made it a second time and rather than tie up the oven all day I put it in the slow cooker and it turned out just like the slow oven version. I bet it would work well with beef or venison too. This is definitely a keeper.

If I could, I would give this recipe 10 stars!  It is absolutely wonderful!  I made the recipe exactly as printed except I used Hungarian paprika as we don't care for the McCormick brand I have of the smoked paprika.  No other changes - and yes - my oven did turn off after 12 hours.  I hadn't read about that, so I was unprepared.  It had been off for about an hour when I discovered it, so I had to adjust for an extra hour.  My roast was 8 1/2 pounds and it figured out to about 15 hours.  After it rested for an hour, we unwrapped it.  Oh my - what wonderful smells and sights.  The bone (smaller than I expected) slipped right out and I removed one small piece of fat and as I lifted the meat out, it just fell apart - no "pulling" needed.  We added some barbecue sauce, piled it on buns and topped it with slaw!   Hardly any chewing was required.  I've never had such a flavorful, tender pork shoulder roast.  We are planning DH birthday dinner in June and he requested that I make this again for that dinner.   No problem - I agree!!!

I made this exactly as written. It was delicious! I will make it again for sure. It was juicy and the bone pulled out easily. My husband wouldn't stop talking about how much he enjoyed it. I made Chef John's Carolina sauce to go with it and it compliments the meat nicely. It is very spicy and after a few bites I was addicted. I am anxious to have some pulled pork sandwiches tomorrow and trying it  with a sweeter barbeque sauce.
 ( Note: Some ovens automatically shut off after 12 hours. )

Incredible.  Wow! Tender, melt in your mouth, flavorful, pulled pork, easiest recipe ever.  But my oven timer and heat shut off after six hours  (in the middle of the night) Maybe it thought I forgot to turn it off or some weird safety feature, so I turned it back on in the morning and continued cooking.  I'm thinking  this recipe is like pork at a luau, burying the pig in the pit for a whole day.

Made this twice. First time as written except used reg. paprika not smoked.  Not sure even what it is or where to get it. Wrapped as stated and had no leakage. Cooked on low 225 or so for about 12-13 hours, let rest for the hour. Disappointment! It wouldn't pull and fall apart. Didn't cook long enough. However the flavor was excellent!!!! More like pork chop than bbq. Now for the second time. Double up on seasoning except for the paprika and added 1/4 cp. dark brown sugar, prepared mustard, oil and vinegar to make a paste rub. Refrigerated overnight in gallon zip lock bag. Wrapped as noted and put into the oven once again at 225. Started at 9:30 PM and cooked overnight and through the next day. Removed from oven at 3:30 and let rest for the hour. This time we had some leakage and seemed that the sugars from the rub is what leaked. Opened up the packet and stuck with a fork and just fell apart. Super moist and tender, OMGosh! But, seemed to have lost some of the flavor either by leakage or by really being able to mix the pulled pork like your suppose too. I think adding the extra spice will not hurt this recipe. Our shoulder was big at least 8lb or so. I don't think the oil and vinegar changed the flavor from the recipe, it only gave the seasonings something to cling to and stick better, or a way to escape the wrap and leech into my roasting pan.
I think next time I'll use more salt and pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne and stick with the dry rub. Don't be afraid to use more

Very tender, easy to pull and flavor outstanding - using slow cooker bags cuts almost 2 hours off cooking time.   WE FREEZE part for later.

If want BBQ pork - pull and then add sauce and warm for great flavor.

I decided to make this because pork shoulder was on sale. It was simply the best result I've had for cooking this cut of meat. I followed the recipe exactly; didn't change a thing. It came out so juicy and succulent, people at my dinner table couldn't get enough. A 7lb roast should serve at least 8 people. Don't bother removing the fat layer or anything else from your meat because it just ends up melting into the rest of the roast for a delicious result. I prepared the roast in the paper and foil the night beforehand and threw it into the fridge. In the morning, I put it in the roasting pan and let it cook for at least 12 hours at the recommended 225. Be aware that many ovens have an automatic shutoff at 12 hours, so be sure to double check it is still on if you go beyond that. Thanks for another stellar recipe Chef John! Your recipes never disappoint.

Chef John......for the win!  I am only rating the spice rub here because I did not use the method due to time constraints.  That being said, I used a 3 lbs boneless butterflied pork shoulder. I put the rub on the meat, lightly painted a coat of oil on it and seared it.  From there, into the crockpot, 20 minutes on high, 3.5 hours on low.  It was so delicious and tender.  I am always in search of the perfect spice rub and this one is it.

This recipe made the most excellent pulled pork.  It was so good as I broke it apart that I didn't need any barbecue sauce.  I felt it didn't actually add any more to the flavor of the recipe.  Most Excellent!  As always Chef John has produced another wonderful recipe.  My first recipe that I made from Chef John was the prime rib which I made for the second time for Christmas dinner.  Oh, my, goodness!  My son uses Chef John's recipes for cooking meals while at college.  We both enjoy not only Chef John's creations but we enjoy watching and listening to his quite instructive videos.  Unfortunately I failed to snap a photo of the finished product before tearing it apart but it looked every bit of what you see from the video.  Thank you Chef John!!

Just made this and it is Sooo good! I made it exactly as written, put mine in a crockpot on low for about 12 hours (started it last night), then let it rest for an hour.  It came out so tender, just falls off the bone.  It is sipposed to be for dinner tonight but it might not make it that long between 2 teenagers and myself.  This is a keeper recipe.

I made this recipe and added some thyme. It turned out so, so good! Bangin was a word often used by those I made it for. I didn't have unbleached parchment paper and it didn't appear to matter at all. So delicious!

so good - I followed the recipe, but did make it in the slow cooker, no parchment.  Cooked for about 8 hours and delicious.  Leftovers were great and froze well, too.

12 hours to cook - 12 minutes to disappear!

Perfection. I followed this recipe to the letter but had to bake it 15 hours because it was over 8 pounds.  Tender, unctuous well seasoned meat. Such a keeper.

It was the best pork roast I've ever had. It leaked quite a bit in to my pan, though, which took forever to get cleaned off. I might have done something wrong. It was extremely good, though.

This is a great recipe as written. Thank you for the advice that some ovens turn off after 12 hours, which mine did. My husband loved this, though he thinks pork shoulder is never good unless it is done in the Big Green Egg.

Followed the recipe to a tee and it was very good, but next time I will cut the salt down to 1 tablespoon instead of 2 as it was a tad bit salty

What internal temperature indicates this roast is done?  I used a 4.5# roast - calculating the cook time to be just under 8 hours.  That seemed to be a lot and set my temperature to 215 and checked it with a thermometer at 5 hours.  The temp was 168 so I stopped the cooking - left the roast in the oven with the door open for 15 minutes then let it stand for 1 hour on the countertop.  The roast was impossible to fork shred and even trying to slice was difficult.  I know smoked brisket is supposed to hit around 210 before it should be pulled - should I have left this roast in longer? All this being said, after I was able to hack it up into bite sized pieces and mixed it into the crock pot of sauerkraut and sauteed onions, the roast tasted great. Thanks and Happy New Year!

I was looking for a different way of making Pork and Sauerkraut on New Years Day and came across Chef John’s recipe. I was intrigued so I decided to follow it to a T. I’ve always wanted to do a pork shoulder so this was my first go at it. The hardest part was finding unbleached parchment paper (thank you Target). I bought a 9 1/2 pound Boston Butt roast and roasted it overnight for 16 hours. I allowed it to rest for 1-2 hours. As I unwrapped it, I was thrilled to see a beautifully browned crust!! I pulled the shoulder bone out easily, stuck a fork in it and popped a piece in my mouth. It was simply delicious. My family tore it up!! THIS is my GO TO pork shoulder recipe until someone proves an easier and tastier method. Thank you and Happy 2020!

Totally AMAZING! The recipe clearly states to use a big cut of meat so if you choose to go small you may find it not done as the one reviewer did. Either abandon yourself to making a lot and having leftovers or abandon the recipe . It’s that simple.

This recipe is awesome, followed exactly, but warning(!)...unwrap in a bowl!  Way more juices than I was expecting, near kitchen disaster.  Otherwise, I loved the fact that this recipe didn’t fill my house with overbearing cooking smells.  Definitely make again.

Cooking time was not accurate. I had 1.5 lb pork shoulder and had it in the oven for 2.5 hours. It was still half raw. Now I have hungry guests while scrambling to throw this in my Instant Pot. Majorly annoying.

This is wonderful! The meat is flavorful and juicy! The best pork you’ll ever make! The only change I made was to cut the red pepper back by half, due to feeding this to my little grandkids. They loved it BTW! Make this, you’ll be glad you did!

Very, very good. I was surprised that it was so flavorful without direct heat on the meat. Bone came out clean, meat fell apart with no effort. Best pulled pork I've ever had. I have found that double wrapping in foil works just as well as the parchment foil combo if you find yourself out of parchment paper.

I didn’t get time to take a photo. It was being eaten by everyone as I pulled it, including me.  I have to add that it looked like it was going to be dry, but boy were we fooled.  It may have just been the type of shoulder I used.  It was a hit and I’ll be wrapping mine like this from now on.

OH My Goddarh! Going back for seconds!!! I’m making it again. The shoulder bone just fell out of this divine piece of meat! I cooked it on my large BBQ pit 350-400 degrees for 31/2 hours then unwrapped it, put in a few small pieces of wood back on the coals and closed the pit to smoke it 15-29 minutes. Then opened it back up, sloshed on some hot mustard/light brown sugar sauce and smoked that til it glazed just a little and ... oh brother,  the big boy BBQ joints in town would die to have had this! Thanks Chef John. Loved using the parchment paper. Doing it again!

My teenage son told me I should make one of these every week. I did change the recipe just because I wanted to use what I had in the cupboard. First I cut all visible fat off of the roast. Then for the rub I covered it with a Texas Brisket Rub from Sam's Club. I skipped wrapping in parchment paper and wrapped it 2 times in aluminum foil. The roast was so huge that adding 3 more layers of wrap would not let it fit in my crockpot. Put in my crockpot on high for 8 hours then down to low for 4 hours. When I unwrapped the foil it just fell apart. My son ate 4 sandwiches for supper. He didn't even add any bbq sauce for the top. Flavor was awesome. We will be making this repeatedly.

I didn’t have the parched paper, but I decided to try it anyway because Chef John didn’t feel it was essential and someone else said it worked for them.  It was fabulous.  I look forward to trying it with the paper.  Now I’m off to find other things to do with the meat.  My roast was nearly 11 pounds and there are only 2 of us!

Followed directions exactly with a 7.2 pound roast. Added 2 TBSP liquid smoke in the rub.  Will likely leave that off next time.  Came out fork tender, absolutely juicy, really flavorful.  Removed from bone (which just pulled out); gave a light chop and divided into four 1.5 pound plastic bags to freeze.  Will heat and add vinegar sauce when ready to serve.

I made this for the Fourth of July. I cooked it in an electric roaster rather than heating up my entire oven on a 94° day.  Absolutely the most tender and juicy pork shoulder that I've ever made! I cooked it for 10 hrs and let it rest for 2 hrs (a bit longer than recommended, only because of  guests' arrival time). And it was fall apart tender  and juicy when removed from its foil and parchment paper wrapping. It was a big hit. Now I need the perfect thin, vinegar barbeque sauce and I will be set for pulled pork in the future. Will definitely make again.

Mmmm.  It was sooo good.  I shredded with forks.  I put bbq sauce on the table but I didn't even need it (my teenager puts bbq sauce on almost everything though).  My pork was a butt roast (is that the same thing?) and it took about 10 hours due to size.

The hardest part of this recipe was deciding how long to bake it and when to put it in the oven.  I put it in at 7:30 PM and removed it at 7 AM.  It turned out just like the video.  I was able to remove the shoulder bone with ease and it was very moist.  The flavor was terrific.  I highly recommend it.

Return on Investment was very high here!  Super easy recipe with ingredients mostly on hand (used regular paprika instead of smoked) and the outcome was exactly as advertised.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  Thanks!

Dear Chef,

I had a 4.8 lb pork butt, bone in,  that I double wrapped in butcher paper and 1 layer of Al foil. I placed it in a 7.25 qt Le Creuset and baked it at 225° for 10 hrs. The outside was tender, but the inside required another 2-3 hrs at 400°. I cubed the meat and seared the meat in a skillet, and deglazed with juice of an orange.

The caramelized juices in the pot's bottom were scrumptious. With your homemade pita bread and roasted tomato sauce the kids were in ecstasy.

Did the covered Dutch oven change the recipe that much? Thank you.

I used a different spice rub but this cooking method is very easy to do! Came out very moist I’ve already made it twice in less than two months.

Tasty base for other meals.  Junior Cubans tender. I bagged it thinking of the different spices I could add for specific recipes.  Cooked a 10lb roast and this took 18hrs of cooking with resting time. Yes, my oven turned off at 12 hours, so beware.  I don't know if I will use this method in lieu of just my pressure cooker or crock pot again.  That was a lot of time with the oven in use.

I was so glad I read the reviews before making this. My oven was one that shut off automatically after 12 hours. It was an easy override but would not have known that otherwise.

That said,  this technique for making pork was amazing. My whole family loved it. I made it with the rub listed in the recipe this time but could see this working well with a variety of spices.

This is an awesome recipe, so much better than using a slow cooker, I didn't change a thing. I will definitely be using this super easy recipe again.

Excellent according to recipe. Only change was my pork shoulder was 3.75 lbs so cooked it using the 1.75 hrs per pound and it came out perfect. Tried it  with the Chef John's East North Carolina BBQ sauce but preferred it with other BBQ sauce. Will make again and experiment with some other rubs.

This is so good and so easy!! We had our sights on one of the Chef John pot roast recipes, but they didn't have bone in and the cuts didn't look so great. The pork shoulder looked incredible and I had never cooked one and wanted to try it. We made the rub the night before. We added a few things like mustard powder and cumin, but just a bit. We wrapped meat per the video, though it did not look as nice as Chef John's - stupid thin tin foil - and let it sit in fridge over night.

For a dish that is all prep and then leave it be, it is such an impressive end result. Everybody raved!! I really wanted a rub and cooking version that were not sweet or in a tomato based sauce. (We had sauces available on the table, I just didn't want to cook in a sweet sauce like that.) Try it, you will not be disappointed.
