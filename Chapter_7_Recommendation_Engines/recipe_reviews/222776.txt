If you have to cook the shrimp that long it will end up tough and dry. The shrimp should be added when the liquid is almost dried out.

I made this recipe for dinner tonite and it was fabulous! I did some minor changes; minced up some fresh garlic and ginger while mincing the onion. Also I used Garam Masala instead of the individual spices (cumin and turmeric). A little more water for the sauce. Served over basmati brown rice....yummy....!!
