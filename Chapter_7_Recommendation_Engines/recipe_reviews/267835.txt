I made this just as stated sifting my flour  and everything,  except I put my orange layer on the  bottom because I wanted to drizzle chocolate over the top and it show up better. I gave 4 stars because it wasnt very sweet and it was really dense, especially the chocolate part. I also baked it for less time then called for and it still came out a little dry. But... this sure  beats those boxed  mixes with aluminum in the baking soda. And  this is a beautiful idea for a fall cake. I will definitely make it again..
