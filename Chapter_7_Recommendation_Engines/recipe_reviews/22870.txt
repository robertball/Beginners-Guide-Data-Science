This was an amazing recipe.  I was curious but skeptical about using coffee, but it turned out to be great.  I used one and half cup of espresso (about 6-7 shots?) plus two cups of water.  I didn't have any beef broth or buillon, so to enhance flavor, I added fresh rosemary, thyme, some cajun seasoning, one plus cup of red wine, and about two tablespoon of soysauce.  I had to cook it for about four hours, and the meat was tender and ready to go.  Coffee seems to have given the meat a earthy, almost gamy flavor.  I served it at a small dinner party, all my friends thought it was amazing.

This was definitely a 10 in our family book!  We're not coffee drinkers; it was mostly out of curiosity that I tried the recipe.  I usually read all the reviews but didn't this time...I was just looking for a chuck roast recipe for which I had all the ingredients!  Instead of using less coffee, I used MORE because my coffee maker is 10 cups, and I figured I'd just get a little more gravy.  Reading the reviews, later, and hearing it was rather a strong coffee flavor, it was a little scary since we don't drink coffee.  I added 2 Lipton Onion Mushroom Soup Mix packets to balance out the coffee and some thick sliced potatoes and baby carrots to round out the dish.  At the end, the taste was DELLICIOUS!  There was SO MUCH gravy however, that, after I removed the meat and vegetables, thickened the gravy and added the sour cream, I added some couscous to the gravy.   I used 2 5.45 oz boxes (less the flavor packets, of course) and, while it was quite a bit thicker than we would have preferred, it was absolutely wonderful!  I think I'll make it again this weekend to take to my parent's home for Father's Day!  Thanks for a winner, Luella...

Delicious.  Very moist and flavorful.  Followed suggestions on reducing amount of coffee to 4 cups and adding 2 cups of water.  My husband and I really enjoyed this.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a pretty good recipe, I added beef broth instead of the boullion cubes others had suggested, and I used some rosemary, thyme and a little oregano too (1 tsp ea) you don't have to like coffee to appreciate this recipe, there is no "coffee" flavor, I just think it makes the juices and gravy a little richer.

I was also skeptical of the coffee addition. I loosely followed what kimshin2000 did-added water,soy sauce, thyme and oregano, as I did not have beef broth or any wine (terrible situation!) It reduced so nicely that I decided we really didn't need the calories of the sour cream-it thickened into a very rich, flavorful gravy.  Thank you for the idea-I will be toying with this one again!!!!!

Judging from the fact that when I got to the dish at pot luck, it was empty, I think this must have been a pretty good recipe. I'm glad I tasted it before I took it. It was great! Thanks.

This recipe was wonderful!  Very flavorful and easy!  I followed the tips from the other reviewers and added beef broth, red wine and less coffee (but very strong coffee) and loved it!

This was the worst pot roast that I have ever tasted.. gravy wise. The meat was pretty much OK.  I tried to correct it, to no avail. It was bitter, and just totally off. I have tried many recipes from this site, all successful, except for this.

The meat had good flavor and was tender but it was sooo greasy (due I'm sure to the cut of meat) and was quite bland!  Will probably not make again because there are lots of other ways to cook a roast that we like better.  Sorry.

Made this a stew by adding carrots in the last hour, and dicing up the beef. Delicious!

This pot roast had little flavor.  I expected the juice to taste like coffee and beef but it really just tasted like mushroomy water.  I had to doctor it up with Schillings beef gravy mix (6 Tablespoons did the trick).  It also was very dry and tough but that may have been my cut of beef.  I still have to give this just one star because pot roast is generally pretty easy to make yummy.

My question is this: Why in the heck would you make this if you don't like coffee? That aside. this is what I did: I used Cafe Bustella, a Puerto Rican Espresso (make it very, very strong). Everything else was akin to the recipe but I did add some Cabernet Sauvigon at the beginning, as well as beef broth. As a side dish, I scraped some white corn off the cob and made cream corn, also served some homemade cole slaw. Every bit of this was excellent. Thanks! And by the way, play around with this recipe as nothing is written in stone. Be brave coffee lovers!

I ALWAYS have left over coffee, so I tried this out on the family and everyone liked it. I did, however, spice it up a little bit as I tasted it durring cooking. I used stew beef; added a few seasonings, some worchestershire sauce, and beef bullion, along with a few cups of extra water... for I boiled noodles right in with it at the end... I did not need to thicken it. I served sour cream at the table to save on calories. I will play with this recipe some more. Thanks!

This recipe was a great jumping off place, and I give it five stars because it made me think in a different direction.  I tweaked this recipe a bit, after reading some of the comments.      I seasoned the roast in a combination of seasoned salt, black pepper, and cinnamon, then seared it in olive oil.  I used a smaller roast than called for, so I used less coffee (4 cups), and added worchestershire sauce.  I also added some dried rosemary and thyme to the braising liquid.      I did find that the cooking time was far too long.  I think it really only needed 2 hours (MAX!).  Still, it came out absolutly yummy and I will definitely make it again.

I had really high hopes for this recipe b/c the aroma in my house while it was cooking was to die for, but I really did not think it was that great.  Enough people have made this with good results so I'm not sure why mine turned out like it did.  I only had a 2 lb roast so I halved everything and only cooked it for 1 1/2 hours, and it was done, but it was a little tough.  My kids liked the meat but were otherwise not wild about it.  I might try it again though.

Yummy, I used a chuck "steak" it was only about a pound or two, I only used a cup and a half of coffee, and 2 cups water and 2 buillion cubes.  I seasoned the meat first with spike and emerils stuff, and pepper.  It was excellent.

The only change I made was to add a couple of beef bouillon cubes in addition to the full amount of coffee. This was wonderful over noodles, I will definitely make it again.

My family loved this roast.  5 hours is a long time but it just sits there and cooks.  My child didn't care for the sour cream but she ate it anyway which says a lot for the dish.  A definite cook again.

This sounded interesting with the coffee so I had to try it.  My husband and I decided it was okay, the meat was very tender, but not the burst of extra flavor I was expecting. I made it as written except for deleting the butter since I had a new non stick pan.

I want to give this a better review, but I ran into a problem when I got to the gravy part and realized I had way too much liquid to make a thick gravy.  I haven't made gravy on my own or this way before, so I tested a small amount of the liquid and proportioned it down... only to get soup.  

I *think* I was supposed to cook it uncovered. I noticed in the recipe it never said to cover it, but I assumed since a slow cooker works with a cover, then I should cover it.  I will try it again sometime uncovered.  Luckily I had enough liquid left to make a decent skillet gravy from another recipe.

Some specification as to whether the pot should be covered would improve this recipe for people like me who have never cooked a roast before!

This was a brilliant idea. I was looking for a way to make my chuck roast without beef stock since I didn't have any in the house. I only made a few changes. I had already seasoned my roast yesterday with a mixture of a seasoning mixture I keep in a jar that consists of salt, garlic powder, black pepper, paprika, onion powder and dried parsley. After I sauteed the onioons I added more of the seasoning to the onions (left out the fresh garlic)and let them sautee for another minute. Then I added the roast back in and splashed it with some Worcestershire. I then added the coffee, all 6 cups made a little strong. I added about 1/4 cup ketchup for a little sweetness. It came out fantastic! The very last thing I did different was add a roux. I didn't have sour cream so I did this instead. Yummy! The family loved it. The only reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is because I changed the recipe a bit.

This was a wonderful recipe.  My family was very interested when I first told them about it and once we tried it, it became our new family favorite.

This was really good and the meat came out very tender.  I used chuck steak as that is what I had on hand, added potatoes carrots & celery near the end.  Great one pot meal.  Growing up in the south with my grandmother & greatgrandmother as the primary cooks...a quick way to "beef up" a gravy was (and still is for me) to add a tsp of instant coffee. Gives a very slow-cooked, rich taste.

My husband and children LOVED this roast.  Who would have thought that coffee would taste so good on beef!?  I have made this several times and have even altered the recipe somewhat, and it still turns out great!

I wasn't sure about this recipe because of the coffee, but I am so happy that I tried it. After reading the reviews I knew to make some changes so I also cut the coffee down to 4 cups and added two cups of beef broth. I also added some Montreal Steak Seasoning and salt for that extra zing.  The roast completely fell apart it was so tender, in fact I almost couldn't turn it over without it breaking apart at the halfway point.  We will definitely have this again.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe.  I found that I could not taste the coffee and the sauce overall was rather bland.  Admittedly, I had difficulty thickening the sauce...maybe I should have just used half the liquid after cooking the meat.  The meat itself was very tender and 'fell apart'.  I don't think I will make this again.

I cooked this in the crock pot and it was easy to put together but I too, thought it had a really strong coffee taste.  I don't drink coffee so that could be why it tasted so strong to me.  I added a packet of dry gravy mix which helped it a little.

The sauce has a strong, overpowering coffee flavor, and overall it is very bland.

when you follow the recipe, it's really bland!  when you do all the recommendation that people suggest then it's great, then a different recipe.

I didn't think I was going to like it because it didn't smell great but it turned out very good. I halved the recipe and used instant coffee. I put it in a pressure cooker for half an hour and I forgot to put the sour cream in the gravy but it was very good and a nice change from my regular pot roast.

I made this almost exactly to the recipe. It was awesome. I tasted the coffee, I think. I'm going to try this on someone and not tell them there's coffee in it and see if they can place it. It's a very hearty, rich taste, anyway. I disagree with the people that say it tasted bland. It's just not real spicy. I might add some red wine next time, although, I liked it so much maybe not.

I am a vegetarian, but I have made this twice for company.  It is so easy and I always get rave reviews.  It cooks in about half the recommended time.  I always test with a meat thermometer.  And I serve it with mashed potatoes and sourdough bread.  I originally chose this recipe because I did not own a dutch oven.  I have since purchased one, but I still use this recipe because it's so simple and everyone always loves it.  My guests took a copy of the recipe home with them last night.

I'm giving this recipe three stars because it seemed bland to me, however I only used one and a half cups of Starbucks' Italian Roast coffee (I'm the only coffee drinker in the house)and the rest of the liquid was beef bouillon.  Next time I'll add more coffee and some herbs----but here's a tip:  I layered 3 sirloin steaks on top of each other because that's what I had on hand, and it cooked beautifully in the crock pot for this recipe!

I added oregano, rosemary, and thyme as
well as a generous amount of Worcestershire and we still thought this was rather bland.

I did make a few changes after reading the reviews, I cut the coffee down to 4 cups with 2 cups water, and added 2 beef bullion cubes. I didn't have fresh mushrooms so I used canned and it came fine. Also since I started this late in the day I threw it into my electric pressure cooker for 80 minutes. The family raved about it!! I will definately use this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Note that I cooked this recipe in my slow cooker.  While the roast was tender thanks to slow cooking, I can't say that it was especially flavorful.  I expected more oomph from the coffee and mushrooms.  Keep in mind too, that it's a good idea to temper the sour cream before adding it to the hot sauce otherwise it will separate like mine did.  : (

Tender and tasty. The advantage of slow-cooking being you can put it together and walk away. The sauce is particularly good-especially if you are a "gravy loving" kind of person.
