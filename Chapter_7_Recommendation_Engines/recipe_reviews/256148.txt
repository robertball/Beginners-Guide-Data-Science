A bit sweet for me but not terrible. The sweetness of the sauce and the vegetabley-ness of the slaw kind of clashed to me at first but it wasn't bad. I used shredded cheese instead of blue because I'm pretty burned out on blue cheese atm and I thought it worked fine.

Great. A little soupy though in the tortillas. I had to drain the chicken before putting into the tortillas and it was much better.
