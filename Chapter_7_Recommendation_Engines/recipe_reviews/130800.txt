I feel bad to be rating a recipe so low but there are some pretty big problems with this one.  First, please be aware that the recipe calls for self-rising flour, not all-purpose.  I did not notice this until after mixing it all together and realizing there was no baking powder or baking soda in the recipe!  I managed to mix in a tsp. of baking powder at the end before baking but ideally it should be added with the dry ingredients.  I believe 3 cups of pumpkin puree is too much.  All I had on hand was a 15 oz. can and it was plenty.  Also, there is no baking time indicated!  It just says to bake it till done.  I baked mine till a toothpick came out clean (approx. 55-60 min.) but the texture towards the middle of the cake was a little too dense and almost undercooked so I think it could have used a bit more time in the oven or maybe that is just the texture of this cake. I really wanted to like it for a Fall recipe but it needs some fine tuning.

Wonderful, fabulous, superb, and every other splendiferous adjective you can come up with! I used cooked, mashed sweet potatoes in place of the pumpkin because they were $.25 a pound today. Laced the cake with 2 Tb of rum and added 2 tsp ginger. How to make your own self rising flour: Measure 2 cups all purpose flour and in a bowl. Remove 1 tablespoon (either discard that Tb or return it back to the flour bag.) To the remaining scant 2 cups of flour, add 1 tablespoon baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt. Mix together with a whisk. Voila! Your own self rising flour. Baking took 75 minutes in my recently calibrated oven to get a clean toothpick with only a few, tiny crumbs clinging. Made the glaze with 1 Tb Tortuga Gold rum and replaced the milk  with orange juice, adding a half tsp freshly grated orange zest. The orange imparted subtle counterpoint to the spices and gave a fresh, bright taste. This cake bakes up nice and high for a stunning presentation. It's an impressive cake for important events, like big holiday parties or family gatherings. Your baking skills will be impossible to deny if you make this one. It's a show-stopper for sure, and as super moist and delectable as it was beautiful to look at. Thank you for an outstanding holiday recipe!

My family loved this cake.  I like recipes specifically for my Bundt cake pan because a little dusting of powdered sugar dusting will do when you want to cut back on calories or just lighten it up.  The glaze is delicious if you want to go all the way.  This is now a permanent part of my holiday recipe collection because it is so easy to take to the bake sale or holiday dinner.  When I take this cake out I make sure to substitute orange extract, dried or fresh orange peel, OR vanilla extract for the rum.

This review is for the glaze only. No snub to the cake recipe intended at all, it's just that I had a cake mix I wanted to use.  If the cake is as good as the glaze I will be sure and remember to try that too.  This glaze is perfect and awesome good! The measurements are right on, the consistency is perfect and the rum extract is a creative and brilliant addition for a pumpkin cake.  In addition to being delicious it's a beautiful glaze too, lusciously thick and glossy.  I'll definitely keep this glaze in mind for other cakes in the future too, varying flavors as the cake would dictate.  Excellent.

I made the Rum - Cream Cheese Glaze to pour over a spice cake.  It was wonderful and very easy to make.  Thank you!  I will try it with the pumpkin cake next time.

I actually made a different cake--pumpkin cake III which was very good but I did make this rum icing and it was fantastic!  Definitely will be using the icing in the future and I'll try this recipe too--it's very similar to the other except for the self-rising flour.

This review is for the glaze...yummy!  The perfect topping for a pumpkin cake.  I made this in a glass bowl, sitting on top of a small pot of simmering water.  Stirred with a hand blender for a smooth consistency.  The only thing I would change is two tablespoons of milk, this is a bit thick.  THANK YOU for sharing!

The cake was beautiful, but just didn't taste right. The texture was appealing at all. I agree with everyone and say less pumpkin.

I made this cake twice: the first time, I used the specified 3 cups of pumpkin, and the cake deflated into a dense, chewy, not-so-hot excuse for a cake while it cooled.   Then I made it a second time, with only 1 1/2 cups of pumpkin, and the result was an unbelievably delicious cake that was devoured in a single day at my husband's office and won me a reputation for culinary brilliance.   The moral is that this cake deserves five stars IF YOU CUT THE PUMPKIN IN HALF.  Otherwise, it barely rates three.   On the other hand, the glaze was deliciously addictive!!

I know it says the bake time is  hour, but it has to be wrong. I bake all the time, and this cake was nowhere near done in an hour. After 1 hr. 45 minutes it still was not done. In the future, I would add less canned pumpkin - I think the amount of pumpkin kept the cake from setting up. The glaze; however, was delicious!

I was disappointed with this cake - it did not turn out as I'd expected.  The consistency of the cake was more like a dense pumpkin pie, though I tested it after an hour and 10 minutes with a toothpick and the toothpick came out clean.  The cake looked beautiful in the over - fluffy and slightly cracked on top, but when I took it out of the oven to cool it the cake deflated.  I took it to my parents/in-laws anyway. The family seemed to enjoy the flavor, even without the glaze (ran out of time and had to dust with powdered sugar instead).  Maybe next time I'll cut back on the pumpkin and make sure I use self-rising flour (I used all purpose and added baking soda, etc. as indicated on the package when substituting for self-rising flour).

I don't know if I did something wrong but the cake was uncooked after 1 and 1/2 hr. in the oven. I think I would cut back on the pumpkin. Taste was good but way too gooey.
Perhaps the original receipe user made a typo in the ingredients.

I do not know what went wrong but my cake came out very dense and not done even after 1 hr. and 20 min. of cooking time.  I did not care for the rum flavoring in the glaze.

I bake a lot and it appeared to have too much pumpkin in ratio to the other ingredients. Next time I will use cups of pumpkin or cooked mashed sweet potatoe. 4 3/4 stars I carried it to a church function and the platter was cleaned, Recieved many compliments

Yummy! This review is only for the glaze. Next time I'll try the cake too. I added the glaze to a spice cake, and everyone devoured it.  Only change was rum to vanilla. Thanks for a super great tasting recipe!

Only used the glaze (needed a recipe for it!) - but wow is it good!  Looking forward to trying the cake in the Fall. :)  I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and increased the milk to 2-3 TB, and it gave a lovely and creamy topping.. not a glaze per se, but like a whipped cream dollop.  I just piled some on a slice of my carrot cake and it was exactly what I needed.  I'm so glad to have found a cream cheese topping that doesn't require pounds of it. :)  P.S. I melted my butter and then whipped it up into the cream cheese (texture got weird at first, which scared me - but after the sugar, it's fine).  I added the powdered sugar with a spoon, and then used the mixer to whip it up to a velvetty texture.  I omitted the rum and used vanilla.  I know I know, I really messed with it, but it's an excellent base recipe and very forgiving. :)  Thank you!

If you love pumpkin pie but want a different take on it, you will love this recipe. It was easy to make and every one loved it. Cake needs to be completely cooled before you put on glaze. I was in a hurry when I made this and didn't wait long enough before I made the glaze so it melted but it was still delicious. The glaze is to die for, will use on other items!

I am a huge fan of anything pumpkin during the holidays, and this cake really hit the spot. The flavor and texture of the cake is perfect and are complimented well by the cream cheese glaze.   This is one of the best pumpkin recipes i've come across and i found the outcome thoroughly enjoyable.

I followed the recipe to the T, as I do will all the recipes that I get from All Recipes. This did not rise at all. I do not know what happened but it was very embarrasing at Thanksgiving Dinner at a friends house.  I hope that your will turn out better if you do try this

I followed the recipe exactly and did not care for it.  It was a cake version of pumpkin pie--but it was very dense and chewy.  The glaze was good--that was the only thing I liked.

Do not try to take out of the pan too early. Let it cool! I was rushing and tried to get it out and it all fell apart. It tasted great though!

I hate pumpkin pie, so I wanted to try something different with pumpkin that I might like.  I made this for Thanksgiving and I am making another one right now, as it was requested by visiting relatives.  Everyone (myself included) loved it.  I made one change and that was I put a layer of brown sugar, cinnamon and butter in the middle.  Also the glaze came out perfect, I have never made a glaze that set up so nicely.  But then, I am impatient and don't usually wait until it is completely cool, and I sprinkled some cinnamon on top of the glaze just for effect and it looked and tasted great.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, I will definitely be making this every year.

I made this cake yesterday and followed the directions as written, but I had to bake it for an additional 10 minutes.  It was okay.  The flavor seems to be missing something.  Maybe more pumpkin pie spice, ginger or cinnamon.  The consistency of the cake was more like that of a steamed pudding.  It was very dense and moist.  If I made this again, I would reduce the amount of sugar.  The combination of the cake with the glaze was overly sweet, but some people like that.  Thank you for the recipe.  I enjoyed making it, but I don't think I'll make it again.

I only used the glaze portion of this recipe and it was great - not too sweet and easy to make.  I also made a vanilla version of this by subs the rum with vanilla extract.

HUGE HIT!! Even my super picky hubby, who usually doesn't like sweets, likes this cake. Beautiful presentation and smells yummy coming out of the oven! All who have said there is no time indicated, have failed to read the very beginning of the recipe... right next to the picture is prep, cook and total time until ready. I agree that all cooks should read through entire recipe before starting!

The Consistency was not like a cake.  My family was not thrilled with the taste and we will not make it again.

Very easy to make. The cake has a denser consistency with more of a pumpkin pie-like thickness to it versus a regular cake consistency. But still very good. The icing was simple and amazing. We will definitely be making this again this holiday season.

I baked it for 1hr and an additional 20 minutes with the foil, the cake looked done, I placed the icing on top, but after I cut a slice and put a fork in it, it was too moist almost like eating a pumpkin pie ! It is supposed to have a texture of a pumpkin pie, or a spongy cake? It looks like the inside did not cook. Put it did taste superb

My husband and friends love this. However, it REALLY is a pumpkin cake. It calls for a lot of  pumpkin which makes the cake very heavy and very soggy in my opinion. It taste quite good but the consistency is off-putting to me. I find this true of a lot of recipes that are so heavy on the pumpkin.

Ironically, I've never made this cake. However, I love the glaze! I reworked the amounts to use as a drizzle over my famous pumpkin pie.

I added 3 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, and additional 1/2 cup of flour and sifted all together with pumpkin pie spice because all I had on-hand was all-purpose flour--baked for 1 hour 15 minutes--came out in bundt pan moist and delicious!  Used 1 tblsp rum instead of imitation and glaze was rich and delicious

This rating is ONLY for the frosting which I used on a banana cake. I thought the frosting was decent. It actually lost that cream cheese twang due to the sugar ratio, so I had to add bottled lemon juice a little at a time til it tasted right. This frosting did not come out white for me like in this picture because my rum extract is brown. I don't even know if they make that in clear, but I guess they must else this photo wouldn't show white glaze.

Tried this recipe tonight. Just want to point out, it says in the notes for this recipe that it's an alternative to pumpkin pie. With that being said, It is very much like a pumpkin pie in it's texture when it's done cooking. I don't have a bundt pan and I was making this to bring over to my niece that just had twins. I also wanted some for the house. I followed the directions but I didn't have applesauce so I used sour cream instead. Also, I used only 1 cup of white sugar because I didn't want it so sweet. I poured the batter into a 8" round pan and an 8 x 10 glass pan. The round pan was done in about 35 mins and the 8x10 cooked around 45. I didn't have cream cheese and I didn't have rum extract so what I did use was one large box of cheese cake pudding with a teaspoon of orange extract. Made the pudding according to pie filling directions with the extract. Then I took half of a large container of Cool Whip and folded it into the pudding after it set in the refrigerator for an hour. It was delicious. 
I would have given this 5 stars, but I took off a star because the author is calling it a cake and it's not very cake-like, it's more of a pie filling consistency.

Amazing cake - everyone loved it - Even with the extra 10 minutes baking time - it needed a little longer in the oven.  the 30 minutes cooling time really makes a difference with my bundt cake pan - first cake i ever took out and it didn't crack.  Dense - flavorful without being too pumpkin-y

This review is for the glaze only -   The consistency of this glaze was incredible! It stayed exactly where I wanted it. I ended up adding no more than 1 extra tsp of milk, a few drops at a time. The flavor was also really good. My family really enjoyed it on a pumpkin cake (different recipe). I would definitely use this glaze for other cakes and vary it with vanilla or almond extracts.

I'm only rating the glaze here - it's EXCELLENT and I will be using it many times in the future, for sure.  The cake recipe sounds yummy too, and I will try it, but didn't have the time yesterday.  I used the 2-ingredient Pumpkin Cake recipe, but added some eggs & a splash of oil - really good & simple!  This glaze was the perfect finishing though - really spiffed up a simple cake!!  THANK YOU for this one!
