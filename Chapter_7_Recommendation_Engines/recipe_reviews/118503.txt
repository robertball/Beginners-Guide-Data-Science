The Ginger brings such a TASTY zing to the sweet potato's!  I had to change things around to make it work for me.  I melted the butter in a sauce pan (NO OLIVE OIL), added all ingredients except for the sweet potato's (PLUS 1 TEASPOON VANILLA) and then put the sliced up potato's in and coated them.  Poured all of it into a 9x9 glass baking dish, covered it, and stuck it into the fridge until about an hour before it was time to eat.  Once removed from the fridge, I stirred again, baked at 350 (stirring halfway thru cooking time) for almost an hour.  This allowed me to prep the dish way earlier in the day, and it was SOOOO easy & SOOO good!  Yes, a bit sweet, but that's how they're supposed to be!

Followed recipe except for honey.
Baked sweet potatoes first them mashed and added ingredients. Baked mixture.
Also added East Indian spice garam masala
and red hot chili powder and used fresh chopped ginger and ginger powder. Was phenomenal.

Dee-Lish!  Ginger is key to this recipe, which is a keeper for me.  It lends a new depth of flavor to a dish I already liked.  I'll be making it again, soon.

This is the only way to have sweet potatoes.  The only thing I do different is add more salt and less pepper and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract just to my taste.  I add some water and slice my potatoes in thin rounds and cook them in the water without the sugar for 5-10 to avoid burning.

Very Good Recipe. I had an abundance of sweet potatoes from my garden and I am trying to use them up in unusual ways. I cut the sugar back to 1/4 versus the 1/3 cup and they came out plenty sweet. These would have been good served on top of ice cream. Nice and sweet :)

This was a good, easy recipe.  I don't measure ingredients, and actually didn't follow this to the T.  Pretty much I used it as a guide to make my own. I used honey, molasses, pumpkin pie spice, pepper and ground ginger. I also threw in baby carrots during the cooking.  Man it was so good!

I changed the number of servings from 2 to 6 and then followed the recipe exactly. There was about 2 cups of extra liquid drowning the sweet potatoes and the oil kept settling on the top so I had to spoon it off. The flavor was super-sweet and the main flavor was cinnamon. It overpowered everything. Butâ€¦ everyone liked it (I strained out the extra liquid so that it wasn't all over the plates). In the future I would omit the oil completely (plenty of butter already in the recipe), cut the brown sugar, cinnamon and honey by a third and add more ginger as well as some type of chili powder to make the flavor more complex instead of JUST sweet. The 3 stars is based on what I expected it to taste like after reading the reviews versus how it turned out, despite following the recipe exactly, not necessarily what it COULD be after some tweaks, as well as all the extra trouble I went through to make it work, but keeping in mind that people liked it.

Wow !!! soooo good. I had bought yams and sweet potato not knowing which to do so i combined them. I coated and cooked the sweet potato first for 15 min. I added the yams, coated and covered and proceeded with the recipie. they worked so well together. They were a big hit at the table.

This was good and everyone liked it. It was a refreshing change from the usual Thanksgiving fare. If you're going to double the recipe, you'll also need to lengthen the time to bake it. We ended up microwaving part of it, and it turned out just fine.

I loved this recipe!  We had friends over for Thanksgiving and they demanded that I share the recipe.  It was much easier than I thought it would be.  I would recomend it to anyone who is making Thanksgiving Dinner for the first time.

I love this recipe becuase it such a great alternative to the old too sweet marshmellow concoction. It got rave reviews at the Thanksgiving table. The only change I made is to use fresh ginger just because we had it on hand...oh and also next time I'm gonna use a little less brown sugar and about half the butter... just my opersonal preference.

I'm not a huge fan of sweet potatoes, but my husband is, so I wanted a different way to make them. He loved them! They were too sweet for my taste though - I'll probably reduce the brown sugar next time. I served this with the maple flavored salmon from this site.

I made this for my husband and me last night.  It was a huge hit for both of us!  We couldn't believe how good it was.  The two of us were also pleasently suprised and the mild bite the potatoes had thanks to the ginger.

This recipe was easy and the potatoes tasted good only I burned the sauce so you should really watch them closely and cook over a low heat.
