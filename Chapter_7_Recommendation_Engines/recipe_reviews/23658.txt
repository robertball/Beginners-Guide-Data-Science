My mother in law is German and we make this same dish all of the time.  She uses the same bread recipe, however I substitue a sweet refrigerator roll recipe and make them ahead.  If I have leftovers I make cinnamon rolls for dessert.  I also make several ahead and freeze them for later use--just make sure they are completely thawed before baking.

My mother has been fixing these since I was tiny and now I've started doing the same. If you like more flavor in the filling, try adding celery seed. It really livens it up.

Simply fabulous. I confess, my recipe bears no resemblance to the original. I opted to use ground turkey, liberally seasoned with pepper and a garlic/salt seasoning. I made some very creamy Cheddar cheesy mashed potatoes andmixed into the browned turkey, then just for the helluva it, added some chopped steamed broccolli. filled the dough circles with this and baked and O MY HEAVENS. Family couldn't stop raving. Served with corn chowder, peanut butter cookies for dessert. All on a rainy blustery day. Thanks for the inspiration. What I made doesn't begin to be the original which I'm sure is wonderful too. But it was darned good!

This was perfect! i made half the recipe, with same amount of beef and did just onions instead of cabbage, i also added garlic and paprika to the beef. This came out so great, my inlaws gave me praise, and my brother in law ate two, these people are EXTREMELY hard to impress and very picky eaters so this recipe was awesome!

My husband has been talking about these for years so I decided to try this recipe and am very glad I did. Followed fairly close to recipe but added some shredded carrots and a garlic clove or two with meat. Had extra dough so I patted it out rectangle, put a layer of butter on top, sprinkled br. sugar and cinn. on then rolled it up and sliced 1/2 in slices. put in buttered round pan and let rise 1 hr or so. 350 for 30 min. Made a vanilla glaze from this site and added some cinn to it also. Husband and son said it could use more of the Br. sugar cinn mix. Next time :)Great way to use up leftovers.

very tasty- a perfect lunch or dinner served with a cold german potato salad! The recipe sounds hard, but is actually very easy to do. The dough comes out perfectly, and I will try a different filling next time! I used fast rise yeast.

These were fantastic! My family is German, so I used to eat bierocks as a kid, and this is the first time since my childhood that I have eaten them. They were just as I remembered. My family loved them, even my finiky 2 year old. Thanks Pam!

I am not experienced with making dough, in fact any time I try to use yeast in something it turns out pretty bad- probably something I do wrong... But this recipe turned out perfect for me! When it came to the dough I did refrigerate for about 4 hours, I also coated the bowl with vegetable oil and rolled the dough in it so it was covered in oil. I did not use any flour to press out my dough pieces. I cut recipe for dough in half (left the filling the same) and it made exactly 10, with a small amount of filling left over. They were gorgeous- just like the first picture that's posted! I did add lots of seasoning to the filling. If you are scared at all about working with bread dough do NOT be- this recipe is awesome. I plan to use it for dinner rolls, cinnamon rolls, pizza pockets, etc. Thanks Pam!!!

One of the best recipes I have tried! The bread around the meat is wonderful, the meat could use a little more seasoning.

If you are looking for an authentic bierock recipe, this one is spot on.   Normally, I don’t use a recipe, but thought I would give this one a try.  It’s absolutely perfect from the bread dough to the meat filling.  These are good sized bierocks.  The finished product is about 4” in diameter.  For sake of ease, I roll the dough into a 16 x 20 rectangle and cut into 20 (4x4) pieces.   P.S.  Don’t forget the spicy German mustard.  It's a must!

I am vegetarian, so I changed the beef to Boca's "fake meat,"  and I added a touch of shredded cheddar.  My friend's husband (as well as my own) never knew the difference! This was wonderful, and tastes exactly how bierocks should.  It is also pretty simple to make.

Hmm, not bad, but nothing special. Everyone commented that there was way too much bread for the meat filling. (Think about it - 1 lb of hamburger and 7 cups of flour???) I'd say to half the dough (or use it for something else like others did) and roll it out much thinner. I added garlic, paprika, and celery seed, and it was just okay.

The concept is fun, though. I think I'll try it with less bread and something like ham, swiss, and mustard inside.

I have been using this website for a few years and this is my 3rd review. I just don't get impressed easily. But these rolls are so delicious that I have to give it 5 stars. I followed the recipe to a dot (except for adding some garlic to the filling but I add garlic to everything). I LOVE IT!

I had never heard of Bierocks or Runzas before, but the recipe sounded good and I'm glad I tried them. These were so delicious!  The dough is perfect- so soft and tasty- although I did have to add additional flour since it was quite sticky to work with at first.  The recipe yielded 25 bierocks, which were gone in about 48 hours. I added some fresh thyme and parsley to the filling, but kept everything else the same. Will make these again and again.  Thanks!

I made these for an Oktoberfest party over the weekend and they were a total hit!  I did not change the recipe at all and I thought they were perfect.  I am a beginner when it comes to working with dough so it did take me a few hours to make them.  I also had to roll out on a floured surface as the dough was really sticky.  I brushed the tops with melted salted butter, and it provided a nice salty counter to the sweet rolls.  I will definitely make these again!!!

This was a really great recipe. I used 1 and 1/2 pounds of hamburger and the whole head of cabbage. Naturally this recipe is a little bland so I added garlic and other seasonings. It turned out awesome. Instead of making 20 little ones I made 10 bigger bierocks. The bread was wonderful as well. I was really surprised that it was such a simple recipe and turned out perfect. Definitly try it! Make sure you have enough time, it's a little time consuming. But well worth it and there great heated up in the microwave. We ate with mustard or gravy. YUM!

This review refers to the DOUGH part of the recipe only. I found the dough miserable to work with. I think the problem was the part where it says "refrigerate dough for 2 hours or let it rise for 1 hour". I chose to let it rise for 1 hour. I think it NEEDED to be cold! It tore and tore and tore again while I tried to work with it. I managed though,  and it was REALLY tasty (hence the 4 stars) but in the future I'm going to knead the dough (no kneading in this recipe) before I let it rise and I'm going to make sure the dough is chilly before I start trying to force it into specific shapes! So I detract 1 star from the overall recipe.

So good!  Hubby was very impressed with these.  I made as written and they are very good, but would be great with added spices to the meat mixture.  I mixed the dough up in the KA and put it in a warm spot to rise for an hour.  It rose beautifully.  I weighed out the dough, so that I would have equal pieces to work with.  I filled 22 with the meat mixture and the last 2 pieces I filled with butter, cinnamon and sugar.  I baked 9 for dinner and froze 13 as soon as I filled them, so that they would not rise.  I will thaw completely, let rise and then bake when having them for dinner.  My DH ate 2 1/2 for dinner and I had 1 1/2.  They are very filling and it is a great recipe to play around with fillings.  I can't wait to try this recipe again, filling with breakfast items, potatoes, eggs, peppers, meat and cheese.  Served this tonight with 'Italian Peas' from AR and cottage cheese.

Made almost as written.  I did not have time to make the buns, so I bought some frozen grands and thawed them quickly in the oven, flattened them and then filled.  I didn't cook the cabbage for a full 30 minutes, I didn't want it to get soggy or mushy.  These were great, brushed with the butter after.  I ate four at one time!  Will definitely be making again.

LOVE this recipe!  However, I did make some slight changes to it based on other reviewers sharing that they felt like the filling (meat and veggies) needed a touch more flavor.  So, that's what I did!  I added in the following spices: cayenne pepper, paprika, oregano, garlic powder, basil, sea salt, pepper and thyme leaves.  Most of the time when I am cooking, I never measure ingredients so I added these to taste while browning the ground beef.  Also, while cooking the overall meat and veggie mixture, I drizzled canola oil on it to make sure that when it would be cooking inside the rolls that they would be nice and moist on the inside of them.  About halfway through their baking time, I used a basting brush to coat the rolls with a touch of leftover bacon/sausage grease.  Gave them character and they came out golden brown!  I served them with homemade mashed potatoes, homemade spaghetti sauce (for dipping), and beer.The recipe does make a large portion of rolls so the ones that I had leftover, I individually wrapped them and placed them into a ziplock bag in the freezer for future 'quick' dinners on the go.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

Great recipe of a classic Volga-German dish.  I like to add mustard.  Sometimes I change the filling to ham and cheese or  hamburger taco.  These are time-consuming but freeze well and make an easy snack or meal.

My husband loves bierocks.  Have tried other recipes in the past but was never really happy with them.  Decided to give a whirl again and am glad I chose this one!!  I halved the recipe and still used 1 egg.  It made 12, nice sized bierocks and I put 6 each in 9x13pan.  I did use 1 1/2 lb hamb for the half recipe and a 16oz bag of cabbage and filled them with approx 4 T filling. Seasoned the ham/onion with garlic, celery seed & paprika (per another review)  They are soooo YUMMY!!!

The dough was absolutely lovely to work with and it had great flavour.  The filling however did need a little help.  I added some swiss cheese, garlic and Worcestershire Sauce which turned out pretty good.  I have also tied the dough with a pulled pork filling was quite happy with how it turned out.  I also used the left over dough to create apple cinnamon baked pies which turned out great.

Fantastic! The cabbage/ground beef mixture was the part I was most comfortable with. So I took the liberty of adding a bunch of spices (Steak seasoning, onion powder, garlic powder, lemon pepper), Worcestershire Sauce, a garlic clove and some shredded cheese. It came out great! I couldn't stop eating the filling! The bread part I was extremely nervous about.  I've never made homemade bread before, but I was so pleased with how well my bread turned out! This recipe was very easy to follow! It takes time and patience, but they turned out DELICIOUS.

These were great!!  They had very tasty flavor ( I did add a pinch or two of thyme and some bay leaves, a dash of garlic powder and doubled the onions). I also used ground turkey and cooked 1/2 the onions with the meat.  I did half whole wheat flour galf white and added more like 3 heaping tbs of the mixture into the bread pouch.  Served with a creamy vegetable soup and squash-delicious!! Thanks for the great recipe!

A little bland for my taste, but I was expecting that from the style of food. I plan on trying a curry mix next time or more of a "shephard's pie" type filling! However, it was very good, loved the bread. Mine wasn't very "fluffy" but I didn't let it rise as long as the recipe said. Overall  my husband and I were very happy with this recipe

I make these frequently and they always turn out great.  The only thing I do different is add a little flour and milk to the filling at the end to make it creamer.  Also, this is my go to bread dough recipe.  I use it for dinner rolls and cinnamon rolls.

This is a really good and easy meal for the family I make them all year long. The left overs are also great so I normally make extra. I took one with me to work the next day for my lunch and everybody wanted the recipe because they smell as great as they taste!

Alright, I have been dying to review this recipe since only hours ago when I found it. I searched yeast and ground beef because it sounded good and this recipe came up, I'd never heard of such a thing before! These were just wonderful after tweeking with the filling a bit. I added the typical garlic, wors sauce, seasonings etc, and half a can of tomato soup to give it a sauciness. Very good! Next time I'm going to do a cubed pepperoni, mozzarella and sauce combo. Delicious!

This is one of my favorite recipes.  I usually make more of the meat mixture so that they are more meat than bread.  I also add some American cheese to some or mushrooms and Swiss to give a little variety.  They also freeze wonderfully and are great to have on hand.

My family loved this!  Even my very picky sons!  With the leftover dough I made cinnamon rolls.  The dough in this recipe is perfect.  Also to change it up, make a sloppy joe mixture and use this dough, make it the same way (the meat in the dough)... Your family will LOVE it, I think the kids liked the sloppy joe version even better.  If I get a chance I will post a recipe for it that way.  Thank you so much Pam!  This one is definitely a keeper!

There are only two of us in our house but I make the whole batch whenever I make them because they are so good and they freeze very well. They are time consuming but well worth the work. The only change I made was I added 1 teaspoon of garlic powder to my meat mixture while it was cooking.

Very tasty filling, however, the dough was a bit too sweet for our taste, I suggest using abot 1/4 cup sugar instead of 1/2 cup and it will turn out great!

I think these turned out great! I cut the recipe in half. My husband didn't like them because of the cabbage, but my other family members did. I think that I'll make this again with just cabbage and onions for me (vegetarian), and I think I'll make them for my husband without the cabbage and with some italian seasoning and mozzarella. Would be great with broccoli and cheddar or left over roast with gravy and onions. Also would be good if you flavored the dough with garlic for Italian fillings, or an onion flavor would be nice too. You could freeze these and reheat since the recipe makes so many. There are endless possiblities for fillings, but the dough turned out perfectly for me!

Great Bierocks! I will be using this recipe from now on! I will probably add more pepper as I like them peppery. I also did not let it rise the 2nd time. Added the meat, folded the dough over and right into the oven. It did leave about a 1/4 of the dough...which I made cinnamon rolls with so no problem there! Thanks for sharing! :)

I loved this recipe it was so good. I added an extra half cup of sugar to my dough and kneaded my dough and then I placed it in the oiled bowl. I also added garlic onion powder and some lime juice to the cabbage and meat for flavor. Once my dough  was done like 3 hours I took a quarter of it on flour and rolled it out like a quarter inch thick and grabbed a cup and punched circlesin the dough. It was super good next time I will cook them for only 18minutes.

I followed the advice of several reviews to add a clove or two of garlic and 2 - 3 splashes of Worcestershire sauce and they turned out so good.  I'm going to use the same dough recipe and make pizza pockets :)

I've made this many times with various fillings, often vegetarian.  Tonight, I made the best filling yet.  I used ground portobellos, about five large ones, which was enough to make filling for about 15 bierocks.  Other than the portobellos, which I just buzzed up in the food processor, I also added 3/4 of a large ground up onion, 1/2 cup ground carrot, 1/4 cup ground celery, one ground yukon gold potato, and seasonings of paprika, cayenne, celery seed, black pepper, garlic, and a beef bouillon cube.  Sautéed the filling to soften.  I think next time I will add coarsely shredded cabbage and another potato.

Followed the recipe exactly as written, and it was delicious!  I grew up eating authentic German bierocks every year during Oktoberfest at my church, and I thought these were every bit as tasty.  My husband has been requesting them - says they're perfect with mashed potatoes and gravy.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

This is the basic recipe. My grandma would make these all the time and I have made this a definite special memory already for my kids. My mom used to make what she called "tacorocks" for my dad since he didn't like cabbage. She would add taco seasoned meat and cheddar cheese. SO GOOD! But my favorite will always be the original!

I messed something up and my dough did not rise.  It had a good flavor, but was very flat....I'm sure it was me tho and not the recipe.  I did use a package of cole slaw mix in place of the cabbage and as others suggested added some flavoring...worch sauce, paprika, and simmered it in vegetable broth.  It was still lacking a little flavor, but nothing a little black/red pepper wouldn't cure.  Froze the leftovers for another meal.  I will be trying this again.  Thanks for sharing!

I've been making these for years but using either using Rhodes frozen dough or boxed pizza crust mix.  You have got to try Pam's crust - It is simply the best. My husband noticed right away that the crust tasted much better! I only made half the dough recipe.  I also use beef broth to simmer the cooked ground beef and cabbage and thicken if necessary.  Sometimes I will add cubed potatoes to make it more filling.  I always serve gravy with my Bierocks.

My family - three generations has made these for years.  We use Pillsbury Hot Roll Mix which works great- sometimes hard to find, but ask your grocer to keep it in stock.  We also make a cheese sauce- like a gravy - to pour over the top to ones own taste.

These turned out really good. They taste like small burgers.  The bread was so soft with a sweetness to it.  I could have eaten the bread by it self.  Even my picky 7 year old nephew ate them.

We really liked these.  The only problem I had was that I could not get the dough thin enough.

These were just okay. Recipe is a bit bland and I'm not sure exactly what is missing. I used gabbage and maybe if I used sauerkraut it would be better.

I have looked for this recipe for a long time, and it is closest to what I remember eating at the Cherry Auction in Fresno, Ca. when I was a  child.

I found this recipe some years ago, but never got around to writing a review. Making again tonight :)

My Mum made these all the time when I was growing up. I started traveling the country several years ago, and missed my Mum's cooking terribly. All I wanted/craved was her bierocks. I couldn't get a hold of her for her recipe, so I searched until I found Pam's and thought it was close to what I remembered, so I gave it a shot. 

I'm so glad I found this recipe, & so is the hubby he can't get enough of them. I've always added diced potatoes to the filling (something my Mum always put in hers) & over the years, I've adjusted the seasoning to our taste. It might sound weird, but I also add red pepper flakes (just enough for a little kick). The bread has a slight sweetness &, in our opinion, goes perfectly with the pepper flakes. Also, I think it's worth noting, that the bread always comes out so light and fluffy. It looks like a heavy dish, but when we're done eating we feel content, not stuffed or sleepy. 

Thanks for the recipe, I've been able to get a taste of home no matter where I am.

Great recipe! Tasted wonderful! I did take a lot of liberties with this recipe, though, but I did follow the recipe as a guideline. I also halved the recipe to make 10 servings instead of 20. For the dough, I used 1 cup warm water, 2 1/4 tsp Rapid Rise yeast, 1/2 tsp sugar mixed into the water and yeast, 3/4 tsp salt, 1 cup quick oats, 2-2 1/2 cups flour, 3 tbsps melted butter, 2tbsps sugar, 2tbsps honey, 1egg. Followed the recipe's direction to make the dough, except I kneaded it for about 8 minutes before rising. For the filling, I used 1 lb ground venison, 1/2 bag of frozen spinach, 1 chopped onion, minced garlic, 2 shredded carrots, 4 oz cream cheese, salt, pepper, thyme, pinch of nutmeg and paprika. Made the filling according to the recipe's directions with my changes. Let the dough rise and filled the rounds according to the recipe. I brushed the tops of the rolls with 1 tbsp of butter before baking. I know it ends up being fairly different from the original recipe, but I feel that it earns 5 stars as written due to the directions being easy and straight-forward, and also due to the fact that you can easily change the recipe to suit your tastes. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

My parents were Volga Germans from Russia. So I grew up eating and loving these. And still make them myself now.  Mom  made a regular bread dough for these. But later in life she began using a package of hot roll mix. This recipe is closest to the way she made them. Sometimes she fried them in hot oil. Those were the tastiest. If she had leftover bread she would roll it into rounds and fry it. Children loved these with a little jelly on top. Now that I'm alone again I still make these but I freeze most of them for quick meals. I make them about 7" in size. One or two is a great meal. I also make these for potlucks but then I make small ones about 3"

I made this tonight and it was fantastic! I did make a few minor changes but so slight that they didn't really change the outcome much. I used 1/2 the amount of cabbage called for (and it was purple cabbage) and made up the difference by using a combo of shredded mozzarella and cheddar cheeses. 

The final result reminded me of something similar to White Castle sandwiches, but way better! 

The dough was amazing, but I only used a little over half the amount it made so I used the rest to make a pan of cinnamon rolls.  We still had enough to feed 3 adults, 2 kids, and had a few bierocks left over. That and the cinnamon rolls for dessert were perfect! Thank you for the recipe!

These turned out very good. I had some sauerkraut that I added to the filling along with the fresh cabbage. I look forward to making this recipe again... This sweet bread would be great with other fillings also. Thanks for sharing pushkemaa!

These are so tasty! You would think it needs other ingredients, but it doesn't.  The dough is so easy to work with.  The outside is hard and the inside is soft and light.  Great way to use up cabbage from the garden!

This was a big hit in my family! We loved it, the bread was crisp and buttery and sweet. Next time I think I'll add a little more meat and slice the cabbage up a little better, but it was still really delicious. Definitely will make this again.

I make these from a recipe I got from school cooks, but have added a few things. I buy large frozen dinner rolls for my pocket. First I shred my cabbage and onions in my food processor, in the mean time I cook my hamburger and season it with what ever I like (turmeric, oregano, salt, pepper what ever you like).  Add the cabbage and onion to the meat and let it cook on low until cabbage translucent.  while waiting on it to cook take the thawed rolls and roll them individually into a thin circle on a floured surface, place shredded cheese in the center of each (can be omitted).  Drain meat mixture and add to enough on top of the cheese and fold.  place on a cookie sheet and bake at 350 deg until crust is a golden brown.  Everyone who I have fixed these love them and ask for the recipe.

I used this recipe as a basis for the bierocks I made.  I used a pound of ground beef, and a half pound of hot sausage.  I removed a little so I could sample it relatively unmolested.  To the remainder I added some paprika to it, some Worcestershire, a little white wine,salt, pepper, and some MSG.  It still tasted relatively flat before putting into the bread and baking it even with the extra seasoning.  I can't say there was a huge difference in the fillings and I couldn't really tell you which was which once I put some mustard on it.  One was slightly more savory when eating without mustard.  

I used 1 Pepperidge farm butter flaky crescent, 1 Pilsbury regular crescent, and 1 Pilsbury French loaf.  

The crescents were individual and looked neater, they tasted good.  You can't get a lot of filling into them, however.  Maybe a tablespoon and a half.  

The French Loaf I did all in one shot.  I rolled it out and put a lot of filling in it. and then pinched the edges and layed them on the seam so it would hold together easier.  It came out much juicier due to the increased amount of filling.  If you got a 4-5" piece, it held together fine.  If you are going to do this for a party or something, I think making individual serving would be the right thing to do.

Overall, I loved them.  I think the french bread was better than the crescents.  A sweeter bread would of probably been great.

I served this with horseradish mustard, curry mustard, dijon mustard, and spicy brown.

Awesome! We've made these 3 times now. They last for awhile since 20 are made. It's fun to experiment with fillings. One time we did a beef stew. Another time chicken, cheese, and broccoli. And then another time we did the recipe as written. We want to try a pizza filling next time. The bread is really good. We use a lot of flour to stop the dough from sticking to the surface.  So we ignore the part that says use an un-floured surface. I think they turn out fine... My boyfriend puts in way more than 2 Tbs of filling. And I think they are better that way.

I made these for a church pitch-in and they were very popular. They held the heat in after baking, and looked beautiful. The dough was kind of sticky after rising. I used cooking spray on my table so I could manipulate the dough easily without having to add more flour.

So very, very good. The bread dough came together nicely, even with the addition of half whole wheat flour. The filling was moist and, with some caraway, garlic and red pepper flakes, reminiscent of my great grandmother's bierocks. 

I also made a vegetarian version, adding mashed potato, peas, grated carrot, garlic and caraway to the sauted cabbage. Now the trick is to stop eating them!

The bread rocks. I've been making bierocks using frozen dough for years. Tonight I tried this since I was out of frozen dough. The dough was fantastic. I only gave 4 stars because the filling is a little bland. Give it some garlic and your in business.

Made the bread with 4c whole wheat flour and 2.5c bread flour. Made the filling with ground turkey breast and added salt free seasoning plus thyme and sage. It was good and eaten by all! Had enough dough left to make 12 mini cinnamon rolls for dessert:)

I used pre-packaged Philly Steaks with the onions and cabbage. It tasted a little bland so to give the filling a little more flavor I put in a little BBQ sauce and some honey. I took the dough and flattened it into one big square and put the meat mixture in the center closed it up let it rise and then baked. Oh so good. Everyone loved it.

This review is for the dough -its excellent and worth the effort and time to make. I used rapid rise yeast and it was ready in 1 hour. I use a different filling for inside. I had a little dough left over and I made a few cinnamon knots---  basically my fillling recipe is the same, but with lots of spices,beef broth and  lots of garlic. I also put shredded cheddar cheese over the filling before I fold it into a pastry.We like these served with salsa. I used oregano-red pepper flakes, thyme celery seed and  celery flakes, cumin salt and pepper- worcestershire sauce 2T--so play with fillingand  if too bland you can doctored it up!

This was good. I used frozen dough instead of making my own, but followed the rest of the recipe pretty close. It was a little bland though, and if I made it again, I think I might add in some shredded cheese to the meat mixture. Would be a five star with some tweaking!

These Bierocks are excellent!  It's the dough that makes the recipe (as opposed to using frozen bread dough).  The filling is great as-is (as long as you don't skimp on the salt and pepper!) and there is plenty of room to play around with spices (maybe some caraway seed, nutmeg, or worcestershire sauce).  Thank you so much for this recipe!  I have missed these since moving away from Nebraska!

Thanks for this easy recipe!  I lost my original recipe and thought yours sounded the closest to what I remembered.  I loved that the dough was so easy to use and had just the right consistency!  I use ground turkey instead of beef in my bierocks so a little more seasoning is needed but these turned out just fabulous!  Thanks!

These turned out great.  I added a little diced carrot, half a package of onion soup mix and 3 slices of American cheese.  I would like to make these again.  It was cold and rainy here in Michigan and this was a great recipe to make on a day like this.

These were really good.  The dough was easy to work with and so yummy.  I added 1/4 slice of cheese on the dough before topping with beef/cabbage.  I also divided into 24 pieces instead of 20 and it worked out fine (easier to cut dough into fourths and then sixths).  Hubby is from Nebraska and likes his Runzas and this recipe satisfied his craving.

I had never heard of bierocks but we loved them.  I didn't have the time to make the douhg so I used frozen bread dough instead.  We loved them! I had a few leftover and froze them.  My sons think they are great reheated.

I've only made this once, but my boyfriend has been begging for it since. It's a very flavorful and relatively easy recipe - although it did take some time. I had a hard time stuffing the bread dough - that was very messy. But the end product is worth it! It makes A LOT though, I ended up freezing most of mine for future consumption (they freeze very well!). The dough was delicious.

I'm a hige bierock fan!  These are very yummy!  I did add more spices though (garlic, crushed red pepper & marjoram).  I also added some shredded carrots.  I stuff them with 3 tablespoons filling but then there was not enough filling (even with 1.5 lb ground beef).  So I made some ham & cheese rolls and pig in a blanket with the leftover dough!  The dough was very good but I only used 6 cups flour and baked them more like 20 minutes.

This dough was wonderful.  It is so easy to make and work with.  I did add a little mustard to the filling.  I had enough dough left to make a nice pan of cinnamon rolls.  I will use this dough recipe from now on.  Thanks

I absolutely love these. they are perfect if you are feeding lots of peeps. And if your not, you have leftovers which are great the next day. I add celery seed as suggested. The kids and Hubby like to dip them in honey, I like them with Dijon mustard.

I am lazy...I bought frozen bread dough and made these.  They were really good and remind me of bierock day at the diner in a small town in Kansas where I worked.  Made them a second time and used left over meat mixture from Shepherds pie.  Added Swiss cheese and they were great.

Amazing! Not really as much work as it looks - once the bread is rising it is really a cinch. The dough is not sticky, either and we had very little mess. We browned the beef with 2 cloves of crushed garlic and added bell pepper, lots of chopped mushrooms, and 1 tsp caraway and 1 tbs oregano with the filling. Then added one can of undiluted cream of celery soup to the filling.  I expected to have more of the 12 left over, but it was just so good we went back for thirds.

Wow, these are delicious! The dough makes a soft "hamburger-bun" shell around the tasty filling. So good I burned my mouth trying to steal bites before they were cool enough to eat! I followed the advice of a couple reviewers, adding one clove of mashed garlic, and some celery seed. I also used a ground beef/veal/pork mixture, which turned out nicely. Baked some immediately, and put the rest into the freezer for future baking. Mmmmm! Lots of work, but definitely worth it.

Very good, it was like eating the beirocks from back home... Usually made by German Mennonites and sold at the farmers market. 
Didn't change a thing and can't wait to make them again.

I love these easy grab and go lunches for the family. I make them in advance for the week and then all they have to do is grab one... or two and lunch is done. I am making it today with Amish white bread recipe that I found on here. I look forward to seeing how the combo works. I am sure it will be fabulous.

I probably shouldnt rate this because i made quite a few adjustments, based mostly on others reviews, which helped this dish along immensely.   I halved the dough, made 10 thin dough squares, put 3 T. filling in each.  I used 4 c. cabbage, added 4 oz. cheddar, salt/pepper/garlic/oregano and a mustard sauce.  Had to add butter to the pan that i spread/cooked the dough on.  If i made it again i’d use 4 T. of filling as the dough to filling ratio seemed off.  Think i’d use 6 oz. cheese as well.  Really good tho!!  I had fun making these.

I made the dough just as the recipe advised.  I used 6 1/2 of flour and used my kitchen aid to knead/mix the dough ingredients.  The recipe suggested it would be enough dough for 20 runzas.  We were able to make 22 runzas that were approx. the size of a large fist.  I have made runzas for years and this is by far the best dough recipe for them!  Thanks for sharing!

I ate these growing up and now make them for my family. Half of us eat cabbage and half don't so I fry the cabbage and burger separate. When it comes time to stuff them I mix half the burger with the cabbage. The other half I place on the dough and add American cheese. That way everyone is happy.

I love the way the dough came out, but the meat was very bland this way, I'm going to experiment with some changes to see if I can up the yum factor on the meat stuffing. A keeper recipe, for sure!

I didn’t have cabbage so I used some different stuffing. Stuffed mine with ground beef, pinto beans, and corn. Absolutely delicious. Froze the majority of mine. Plan to reheat from frozen at 325 for 20-25 min after some Google research. I also did refrigerate my dough for nearly 6 hours just due to timing. I did read from other reviews that this greatly helped. Will definitely make these again and try out different stuffings. Can’t wait to try the cabbage.

I’m from Kansas, so I get cravings for these and  make them a couple times a year during winter, but I alter the recipe. Too much dough and too little seasoning. You can always use frozen raw dinner rolls if you don’t want to fuss with the dough. I always add some cheddar cheese in my beirocks.  I season the meat/cabbage with salt, pepper, 2-3 cloves of garlic and liberal amounts of Cavander’s Greek seasoning and some mrs. Dash. Seriously meat and cabbage need seasoning don’t skimp unless you like bland a$s food. I also make vegetarian friendly ones using “meatless” crumbles and mushrooms , I’m probably the only midwestern that does this lol

Very easy recipe. The only thing I did differently was to add some black pepper, granulated garlic and Worcestershire. Next time I will roll the dough out thinner and try to make them look nicer.

Easily made and a great hit with everyone! I modified the filling a bit, including some garlic, mushrooms, and mozzarella cheese, but this was a great base for it. I'll be making these again!

I made this recipe with ground beef.  Then made it with ground Turkey.  Both were great and the family loved them.  The next time I make them I will add 2 Tbl of course ground mustard for a German flavor.

I made these.  As I was measuring the pepper I thought, “German food isn’t spicy.”  So I halved the pepper.  It was perfect!  

It was simple and delicious. I will be making it again.

These were perfect.  I have made okay Bierocks in the past , but these were so easy and the bread turned out perfectly. Taste your meat mixture to make sure you have enough seasoning for your taste!!  I added more salt and pepper.  Yummy. I got complements from Bierock lovers.

I am rating the recipe for the dough only.  The dough is the best recipe I have used for beirocks yet. It is easy, relatively fast, and tastes great. The dough is soft and pliable. I was able to get 20 beirocks out of this recipe. They were nice sized as well.  I made sure to brush melted butter on top of rolls before I baked and right when they came out of oven as well.

I like my filling meaty so this is what I used:
For the filling, I used 2 pounds of hamburger, 2 bags of coleslaw mix,  and 1 large sweet onion. I seasoned with salt, pepper, Cavender's Greek seasoning (in the yellow can) and garlic powder. I just seasoned to taste - shake it 'til you make it. I drained in a strainer  and made sure it was cool prior to filling. 

If your family likes cheese or sour cream, these do taste good with a little cheese and also sour cream! You can put a little on the inside or cut a slit in the top and stuff it in prior to eating. Great either way.

Awesome!  We had half made large for rolls for cheese steak sandwiches and the other half as cheeseburger bierocks.  Not quite traditional, but very much the local favorite here!  8/28/17 today we had half cheeseburger and half Manwitch bierocks! 
 9/19/17 Pulled Pork Sandwiches!

I made a half recipe and it turned out great. The most difficult part is getting the dough wrapped around the meat mixture. Cutting it into circles helped.

The main ingredient missing is PEPPER!!! 

I did 2 lbs beef and a full head of cabbage. 2 onions, salt to taste and LOTS of pepper. I kept the dough amount the same. The meat to bread ratio turned out beautifully.

I lost the recipe from my husbands grandmother, but this one was nearly identical.

I grew up eating these for school lunch in Kansas. I have "Frankensteined" some before, but never got the right flavor. I must have been missing the "sweet roll" dough. Hubby asked for them this week so I thought I would find a recipe. The flavor of this version is wonderful. I always have trouble with yeast bread and my dough didn't rise and was a bit heavy. I think I knead too much. I think next time I will use half the bread ingredients and put it in the bread maker.

So delicious. The rolls are incredible - sweet, tender, and fluffy. The filling is great and so versatile. I cut up several vegetables I had in the fridge into small pieces and added them after the cabbage (added as I cut them up so it didn't add a bunch of extra prep time).  Broccoli, green beans, carrots, leeks, and Anaheim pepper.  For seasoning, I added two cloves of garlic, about a quarter teaspoon of celery salt, and some black pepper in addition to the salt called for.  Definitely a keeper!

I used 5 loaves frozen bread dough to skip the  dough making. Put and much filling in each one as you can stretch  dough around then you won't have too  much dough. Also you need way more pepper than this calls for . Everyone loves these! !

I used 1lb of ground sirloin AND 1lb of fresh ground lamb. I also used 3tbs of fresh minced garlic and added 1/8 cup of fresh squeezed lemon juice and 1tsp of white vinegar. Seasoning-wise I added 1tbs each of garlic and onion powder and 1tbs of Maggi Seasoning Sauce to the meat/cabbage mixture. Finally I topped half of the 20 b-rocks with freshly shredded extra-sharp white cheddar. Both types were awesome and much more flavorful than the original recipe to my taste.

I made these this evening, and they were OK.  My husband liked them, and the kids did also. But they were just OK. I added some extra seasonings, because when I tasted the filling, it was a bit bland. I added thyme, garlic and more salt and pepper than the recipe called for. The bread portion of the recipe was delicious. But the filling was kind of ho-hum even with the extra seasoning. I think this might just be a personal preference. So, as bierocks go, this recipe is probably just fine. I just think I prefer something with a bit more flavor. I'm going to try some pasties next.

I divided the filling in half and only added cabbage to one half. To the other I added ketchup and cheese for a cheeseburger-like filling. The dough is heavenly, great for rolls as well.

These were pretty good. I added celery seed and fennel to the filling. Next time I'll add caraway seeds to the dough add it was a bit bland. I used melted instead of softened butter, which is easier to work with and the dough still turns out great.

This recipe is great as written, very traditional German food (and so I find it bland). I tend to make the traditional filling for my husband, and a beef curry for myself, but it's all based upon your personal taste. I like to make extra dough to make cinnamon rolls (so versatile!), and these freeze beautifully. Just wrap the frozen bierock in a damp paper towel and nuke 20-30 seconds to eat.

Loved these! I made mine with half ground beef and half sausage. I also added corn because I am one to always slip in extra vegtables whenever I can.  So tasty my family loved them!

We usually thaw out frozen dinner rolls and put two together with a rolling pin. It was good and all but the dough kept retracting when you were trying to fill it. This way is much better! Not only was the dough easy to manage but tasty too! I like my bread a bit sweeter so next time I will use a bit more sugar. Also we just picked jalapenos out of our garden and added it to the mix...along with more salt and spices. Mmmmmmm Mmmmmmm! Good!

These were good but the meat mixture could have used more seasoning.  I made half the recipe and only made one substitution in the bread dough.  I sub'd half a cup of milk for half a cup of the water called for.  I loved the dough, it was easy to work with and was very tasty.  I will give it a try for dinner rolls, burger buns or cinnamon buns sometime.  I'll make these again but will definately add more seasning to the meat mixture.

I usually love everything I try but this was just not our thing, my family really didn't enjoy it very much. And it was quite a time consuming dinner.

I am pleasantly surprised by how tasty this is! I used some WW flour to make it a little healthy and halved the dough recipe as I wasn't prepared to make that much... Some points to note: make sure the cabbage is shredded finely, I might even dice it up so that it is easier to wrap. Also, I don't get how to actually spread the dough out on unfloured surface, as my dough stuck to the board if I don't put some flour on it. So I rolled them out on floured surface - turned out just fine.

Yum!  These are delicious.  I made exactly as written except added a tablespoon of caraway seeds to the meat mixture.  The bread dough is exceptional, easy to make and very easy to work with.
