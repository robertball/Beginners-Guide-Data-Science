I did not have baby carrots so I just sliced some carrots up. I really like the tart flavor sumac adds but I don't think the nutmeg added anything to the recipe. Next time I will just leave it out. If you want a change from your everyday boring carrots try this one!

4.25.18  The one thing that I always buy organic is carrots, never buy baby carrots.  That being said, I diagonally cut my carrots into chunks and with the small amount of liquid called for in this recipe, I had concerns about whether or not the carrots would cook before the vegetable stock cooked out.  So I did give them a bit of a head start by steaming them in the microwave for a couple minutes.  I did not have fresh sage (that’s  one herb I don’t grow), so I used dried and stirred it into the carrots along with the salt and a fresh grind of pepper,  rather than using those three ingredients as a garnish.  Very flavorful and savory side dish to pork roast, mashed potatoes and gravy.
