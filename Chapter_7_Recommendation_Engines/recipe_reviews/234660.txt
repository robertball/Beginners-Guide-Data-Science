This was a breakfast smoothie, so I sub’d rum extract for the rum (too early in the day for booze), and it worked fine.  This is surprisingly tasty, and these flavors all partner well with each other.  I did add a bunch of ice to it because a frozen banana did not make it slushy at all.  For my taste, I will probably add more nutmeg in the future.  I drink a lot of smoothies, this is a good one, and must say that this tasted totally different from any that I’ve ever made.
