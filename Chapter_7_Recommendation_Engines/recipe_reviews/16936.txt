I thought that the noodle mixture in this recipe really lacked flavor. Maybe salt, pepper, and definitely more cheese. I may also try using fewer noodles as I had a lot left-over when the chicken was gone.

It was good. Because the reviewers before me said it was bland I added 1 tbsp of minced garlic and I doubled the cheese. My kids loved it. The only other thing I would change is I would cook the chicken for an extra 15 minutes before everything else because we had to put them back in the oven but the noodles were done.

Made this recipe tonight, My boyfriend enjoyed it, I wasnt a fan.  We added green and red pepper along with a 1/4 cup cheese whiz for extra flavor. I found it was extremely watery and kind of bland. I probably wont be making this again, unless of course my boyfriend wants it!

I must admit that my review is based on the greater quantity of garlic. That said, it was a wonderful, easy to make with what I have on hand recipe.
