This rice is absolutely fabulous. I eat rice everyday and was looking for something different.  I'm amazed at just how good this simple recipe is.  I used sesame oil and Jasmine rice.  I also drizzled lime juice over the rice after it was finished.  I think the cilantro and lime juice are essential.  The only thing I will do differently next time is try it with two eggs instead of one.  One egg doesn't seem too noticeable in the final dish and I think two will make it more like authentic fried rice.

Very good.  And easy to make.  And picturesque: all the green of the
cilantro, green onions, lime, and cucumber is quite pretty.  I've made it
three times now, with jasmine.  The smell when cooking is great: the scent
of the jasmine combined with onions and garlic!  mmmm...  I have some
suggestions though:  (1) If you're using dried cilantro, use more like a
teaspoon.  Dried cilantro is more dense and powerful than fresh, and this
recipe calls for a tablespoon of fresh.  (I made the mistake of using a
tablespoon of dried once and that was way too much.)  (2) The cucumbers
don't add anything to (and I think even detract from) the flavor; I've
skipped adding them after the first time I cooked this.  (3)  The lime
flavor, however, does add something.  It goes well, especially with the
crab.

Overall, pretty good fried rice. I think the cilantro is what makes it; this is also what my mom likes to add in hers.  I went all out and also chopped up some leftover lobster meat, for that extra bit of color & class.  A dash of fish sauce and white pepper, along with some semi-hot peppers, gave it an extra zing that the original recipe lacked.

I loved this.  I changed it to wild organic brown rice, and added more vegetables such as mushrooms, and orange bell peppers, and chopped up celery which I cooked in the oil along with the onions.  
I then used the mix in tomato wraps to make a delicous wrap. Before wrapping, I took sweet chili sauce (the asian style kind used for chicken) and spread that over the wrap for some zing.
It made awesome and well loved wraps!!!

Delicious stir fry.  I used imitation crab meat which was very good. I think the cilantro really makes it.  Would recommend any time!

Wonderful recipe, both my husband and I enjoyed it. I did add a little soya sauce but otherwise followed the directions. We had it would some left over chicken curry and a salad. Will make again.

My girlfriend and I are new to cooking and we found this recipe very easy to make and very good.  We added extra crab and egg and used day-old jasmine rice.  We also used a sweet yellow onion and didn't really need the extra sugar.  We ate with sriracha, asparagus, and Gewurztraminer (which was perhaps a little sweet for the dish).  Overall very highly recommended.

I was very impressed with this. I was skeptical at first, but it really turns out beautifully and tastes fabulous.  My fiance who adores fried rice from Chinese restaurants, loved this.  I didn't see the point of the lime slices though. I squeezed a little lime juice on mine and it did nothing for the taste... so if you don't have lime for garnish, don't worry about it! :)

I'm one of those people who hates/loves to cook.  It's an obligation but I'm always willing to try some new recipe.  I'm glad I tried this one.  It was extra tasty and easy to make.  I used canned crab meat and it was still a tasty treat!

The was a good recipe, but it calls for WAY too much salt.  You only need 1/4 of the salt that it calls for.  I doubled the recipe and used 2 teaspoons (half the amount it calls for) and it was still way too much.  Otherwise, it was pretty good.

Quick, easy and good.  I used brown rice and added swiss chard at the end to enhance the nourishment.  I used fresh mixed seafood.  It didn't get 5 stars because it was not "out of this world" but it was good.

Excellent.  As advised in another review, I used 2 eggs and 1/2 the salt.  Also, I didn't have cilantro, but had lots of fresh mint, so I substituted.  Very tasty, even with imitation crab.  Great 30 minute meal.

Yum, yum, yum!  I added some small shrimp, and fish sauce to the recipe.  I also only added half the amount of sugar, I was afraid that it would be too sweet.  My husband enjoyed this dish, which is great because he is so picky.

This was very good, but I thought it was a little on the salty side.  I'd cut the salt in half the next time I make it.  I added frozen peas, and liked it very much.  The kids didn't like it so much.

This recipe has been one of our favorites for many years. It's light and delicious and easy to make. My only change is that I skip the salt, and add a teaspoon of fish sauce, which gives it a depth of flavor that puts it over the top in my opinion. I serve it with stir fried bok choy for a healthy dinner.

Good, not amazing.  It was not specified whether the cilantro should be fresh or dried, I used dried and reduced the amount, maybe will try again with fresh.  I followed the recipe with the exception of adding a few mushrooms.

This rice is to die for.  Reminded me of travelling in Thailand.  I am making it tonight for the second time.  I am using Jasmine rice and halving the amount of onions and chopping them in wedges, then in half again - they were a little large and too many last time.  Yum, can't wait.

This is pretty good. A little flavorless for my liking. It really needs to be eaten with the cucumber.  I just chopped some up and put it on top of the rice after I plated it.

Excellent treat!
I've made this 3 times now (twice in one week) and the dish comes out perfect every time. I've also experimented reducing the salt by half and adding about 1.5 Tbsp of reduced sodium soy sauce (for color) and it came out flawless either way. Using crab makes the dish fancy and my guests thought I slave for hours preparing something like that. In reality it's fast, super easy, and very delicious. Love the cilantro & lime in it.

Great recipe. Try cooking the rice the day before and cooling it in the fridge overnight it makes the rice so much easier to work with and I think it tastes better.

This is definitely worth cooking.  It was great.  I think fresh crab should be used as opposed to canned crab.  If it was implied, it should probably be specified.  I think canned crab makes it a little too salty.  Also, I prefer the onions be chopped instead of in wedges.  Besides that, it's great and very filling.

I loved this, more importantly so did my husband.  He swears he does not like rice or oriental foods.  I add frozen peas, white corn and brocolli.  This was great.  I served it with grilled shrimp and scallops.  My husband thought it would even be great on it's own with garlic bread.  Thank you for a great dinner.

This was pretty good, but I'd say go a bit lighter on the cilantro.

I thought this was really good and very easy to make! The cilantro adds a nice touch. I made a couple of adjustments- added 1 more egg, and a couple tblsp. of soy sauce.

This was pretty good, although I made some changes.  I made it with brown rice, and realized I didn't have any garlic, so I omitted the salt and added in garlic salt.  I didn't have any green onions, so those were out.  I added low sodium soy sauce and some paprika and black pepper.  Tasted great!

This was pretty good and easy to make. I'll probably add some shrimp next time.

Easy and tasty!  Versatile too.  I added green pepper, mushrooms, and some shredded carrots.
