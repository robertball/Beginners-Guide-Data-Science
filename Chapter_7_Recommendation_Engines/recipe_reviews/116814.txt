Since there is absolutely nothing going on here for flavor, I can only rate this 2 stars, and even that is merely as a reference for method. The only seasoning is salt and pepper, and not much flavor can be expected from just onion and celery either. Using this recipe as a starting point, I made significant changes and additions which made this a 4-star recipe for sure.  I used one pork tenderloin, which I butterflied and flattened as the recipe directs, and then salted and peppered. I sauteed chopped onion, celery and fennel in an olive oil/butter mix about 10 minutes, added fresh minced garlic and fresh thyme, and cooked another minute or so. I used herb-seasoned stuffing cubes rather than the plain bread cubes, and because of the now nicely flavored vegetable mixture, used very little of the stuffing cubes, about 1 cup for the one tenderloin. When mixing the stuffing cubes with the vegetable mixture, I bound it together with some warmed chicken stock, enough to moisten. I stuffed, then tied the roast, and rubbed it with a little olive oil before laying half strips of a good, smokey, thick-sliced bacon over the top. Roasted at 50 minutes, it was perfect, tender and with very nice flavor.

This was wonderful.  Here are the changes I made.  I did not fry the tenderloin.  I softened 1 cup of croutons in 1/2 cup chicken broth.  Sauted the onions and celery with 1/2 tsp minced garlic in 1 TBSP olive oil, 1 TBSP butter.  I added 1 tsp sage and salt and pepper to the softened croutons.  I then mixed the onion/celery mixture into the crouton mix.  I did not skimp on stuffing the meat adding stuffing till it was about 1 - 1 1/2 inch thick pressing down as I added the stuffing.  I tied the pork and stuffing at 2 inch intervals, placed onion and about 1/4 cup white wine into the baking dish.  I did not have a rack so I placed the pork right into the shallow dish.  I topped the pork with Montreal steak spice and baked for 40 minutes and broiled for 5 minutes.  In order to save time, I baked small potatoes on the oven rack and cauliflower flowerets (tossed in olive oil and salt) in a shallow pan lined with parchment paper.  I took the vegetables out after 45 minutes and covered, then broiled the meat to brown it up.  I made gravey with the juices and onions and served the stuffed pork with a spoon of gravy.  Also served with homemade pickles.  Yummy!  This one makes it to my recipe box.

This was really really good and easy to make. I did cheat and I used an instant stuffing (followed box directions) and added the onion and celery to it. This came out nice and moist.

I changed this a little.  I marinated the pork overnight in olive oil, garlic, and italian seasonings.  I could not find kitchen string, so I used skewers to keep it in place while cooking.  I made this for company and the presentation was lovely, and it was very tasty.  It looks like you worked all day in the kitchen, but it was not that difficult.  I was very happy, thank you for a great recipe!

Yum! This was delicious! It wasn't very bright of me to make this for the first time on a busy weekday after work. With all the different stages (make the stuffing, flatten the tenderloins, brown the tenderloins, assemble the tenderloins, bake for an hour) it wasn't a quick meal to prepare . . . but it was deceptively easy, and DANG, but it tasted deluxe! I added chopped mushrooms, a little splash of chicken broth, and some additional herbs. Served this with Baked Whole Cauliflower and Garlic Parmesan Orzo (recipes on this site).

Having never done this before I found it a littel difficult. I added Chicken broth to the stuffing to moisten it. I could not put all the stuffing in the roast so I cooked about half of the stuffing in a casserole dish in the oven because it was too much stuffing for the pork.

I like the idea of browning the meat first but this recipe is lacking some flavor.  I would add a little rosemary, thyme, parsley and most importantly, sage!

I was always nervous about stuffing a tenderloin, but this recipe showed me that it is fairly easy. The roast was juicy, flavorful and there were no leftovers. That's always a good sign.

I Loved this recipe and it was super easy!!  I did marinate the meat in olive oil, 2 cloves of chopped garlic and herb and garlic spice for 7 hours first.  I also used a stuffing mix with the celery mix just to get some extra flavour.  The meat turned out so tender, Iâ€™ve never been able to make pork this good before.  This was super easy and will definitely be making it again!!

I'd have to sayflavour is missing from this recipe...Personally i wouldn't brown the loin. Beautiful recipe, just missing seasonings. This recipie gave me an idea to stuff it with spinach, onion and red peppers, turned out amazing

Delicious! So simple. I just used stove top stuffing (made according to package directions) and butterflied a pork loin. It was perfect!

I agree with the previous review that this is a very basic recipe.  Here are the amendments I made:  Prepared meat as suggested but did not fry it first.    I used a loaf of day old calabrese bread and 1/2 loaf of day old foccacia bread.  I added half a bunch of chopped parsley, one chopped apple, 3 scallions, 2 eggs and poultry seasoning to the stuffing.  After tying it all off I rubbed the outside with coarse Himalayan salt and tucked several springs of rosemary under the string.   Made gravy from a stock I made from a bit of the meat I cut off from the end of the loin with apple, celery, onion, bayleaf and 3 whole garlic bulbs.    It turned out amazing.

I loved this recipe. I have never cooked a pork tenderloin.  I used olive oil and butter to brown the meat. I topped it off before eating with a drizzle of Italian dressing.. Yum Yum..  Friend of mine never had pork tenderloin and loved it.. She loved the dressing. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was lacking in flavor and even with some added seasonsings, it still wasn't great. I like the idea of stuffing the tenderloin and so thanks for the idea.

It was a good place to start, but the cooking time would have made it too dry.  I used toothpicks to hold it together.

Nice recipe Lois. Thank you. I did follow some of the other reviews and added more spices as well as adding chicken broth to the bread crumbs.

Really loved this.  Next time I will marinate the pork.  It did need something.  I think I will serve a gravy with it as well.  It's one of those recipes you can make for company.  Works with chicken as well.

This is a good basic meal.  I added one apple, 1 tbl spoon sage, chicken broth, a few raisins and an egg to the stuffing.  Added garlic and rosemary to the tenderloin rub, and it was great.

Fabulous!  For a first time attempt at a stuffed pork roast/tenderloin, I found this very easy to do.  I'm a fantastic baker, and not usually much of a "chef", so when this turned out beautifully, I felt great and it tasted great.  I modified it this time (2nd time making it) to stuff a pork roast, instead of tenderloin - still delicious and the roast I used was a good one, so it didn't need any extra steps to tenderize.

Wasn't as tasty as i thought it would be. Needs more seasoning and it was a bit dry.
