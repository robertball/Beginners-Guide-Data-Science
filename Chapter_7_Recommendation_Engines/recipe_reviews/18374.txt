this is a classic hawaiian dessert and a great recipe.  i am from hawaii and have had countless chocolate haupia pies, the most famous are from ted's bakery, but thought this tasted even better.  my husband doesn't like whipped cream, so i actually made it without that and it was still very good.  the only thing was after being in the fridge for a few days, the coconut top started to brown on the edges, but i cut it off and it tasted as good as ever.  do be careful how much chocolate you use, i didn't think the recipe called for enough so i added 1/4c more and the chocolate flavor was very strong.  this pie should have a very light and creamy flavor.  i also used a premade graham cracker crust and that turned out very well, it didn't compete with the pie's flavors, but really enhanced it.  i noticed others complained about the gelatinous texture of the coconut pudding - FYI, haupia is SUPPOSED to look like that, so have no fear.  haupia is a coconut dessert that is often called pudding but thick enough to cut into squares, almost like jello.  i know the recipe says to refrigerate for an hour but i would chill in the fridge for at least 4.  i say this because when i sampled a piece of pie after one hour, i noticed the texture of the haupia was slightly lumpy and still a little warm.  after a few hours in the fridge, the haupia and chocolate pudding was smooth in consistency.

We all loved this pie!  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out beautiful.  Very easy to make and it slices beautifully.  I bought the pie crust ready made and this recipe filled two of the tenderflake deep dish pie crusts perfectly (hint - they are not very deep).  I am making this again today and the only thing I will do differently is add a tsp of coconut extract to the white layer as I found the flavour very mild, also I will put white layer in the bottom then chocolate then whipped cream so it looks more layered.  I really loved this pie because it was more of a coconut cream and had none of the gritty taste from chunks of coconut which my kids don't like in other coconut pies.  Great recipe - thanks

This must be the most delectable chocolate haupia pie on Earth. My family and I have enjoyed haupia pies from the famous Ted's Bakery in Hawaii before, but my family believes this is just as good, if not better, than Ted's!! (Which is hard to believe!)  My only advice: Be sure to refrigerate it for a few extra hours before serving. It is best when the haupia is really firm. It sliced wonderfully and it has the smoothest, creamiest texture! I recommend making a sweet graham cracker crust for it, it seems to work beautifully. Also, I read some reviews where people added coconut extract, but I did not. The coconut milk gave it plenty of that delicious Hawaiian flavor I was looking for. This is a refreshing treat that is sure to impress everyone who loves the wonderful combination of coconut and chocolate. The coconut flavor is subtle but definitely present and the amount of chocolate the recipe calls for is perfect.  And lastly, some of my family members aren't terribly fond of coconut but they still loved the pie. Five Stars!

This pie is amazing.  I used an oreo crust, and didn't bother with making whipped cream.  I just used Reddi Whip and added it right before eating.  I also added a tsp of coconut extract and a small handfull of coconut flakes to the plain coconut pudding.  It was pretty easy to make, and very good.

Made a good pie but I would like more coconut flavour. Did not want to add shredded coconut because I felt it would ruin the velvety texture of the pie. I'm not a fan of extracts or artificial flavouring. I will definitely try again, next time I'll probably experiment with using twice the coconut milk and reducing it by half. Also I topped the pie with a mountain of meringue to save a butt load of the fat and calories the recipe contains with the whipped cream.

OMG This pie is amazing. If anyone really knows what this pie is supposed to taste like and knows Ted's Bakery, you have to try this recipe out. It's super easy & all my Hawaii friends loved it! I used a vegetable peeler and put Trader Joe's dark chocolate shavings with organic coconut flakes that I toasted myself (about 5 or more minutes in oven on 350 deg) & the chocolate & coconut mixed a bit which some said tasted like a candy topping. YOU GOTTA TRY THIS! Out of the world :D!!!!

This recipe was a hit.  I added about a cup of shredded coconut to the white layer and to the chocolate layer I added about 3/4C of slivered almonds (I'm a huge fan of Almond Joys!).  It was excellent.  Thanks for the recipe!

So good- the haupia alone was amazing.  I used mostly coconut milk for the liquid.  I used 1/2 milk, 1/2 coconut milk instead of the 1 cup milk,  plus mixed my cornstarch in with 1/2 water and 1/2 coconut milk.  It really increased the coconut flavor!  I'd say this pie does need to be refrigerated for more than an hour before serving, and isn't a great choice for a potluck, as it gets pretty soft  while it sits out (at least, mine did).  But, every last bit was scraped out of the pan!  It's delicious!

This is GREAT!! What's not to love, chocolate and coconut.  I followed the recipe exactly, and then decided to add shredded coconut to the plain layer.  I think it made a huge difference, really gave it the coconut flavor.  I also toasted 3/4 cup of coconut and sprinkled it on top of the pie.  Can't wait to make it again!

I have made this twice now, it is a great recipe.  I just returned from my honeymoon in Oahu and really enjoyed the haupia chocolate pie at Ted's Bakery and this tasted very similar.  Haupia is a light coconut and the firmness of the pie is what the recipe aims at and succeeds.  If you're looking for a recipe that is heavily laced with coconut or of a pudding consistency (like most cream pies), this recipe is not it.  BUT if you're willing to try something different and authentic to Hawaii, try this recipe.  If you use a regular graham cracker crust (I used Keebler's ready made), then the recipe in this filling will yield two pies, so either cut the recipe in half or buy two pie crusts.  I buy a pint of whipping cream, so used just 2 cups for the topping, and it turned out great.  Make sure to reduce the sugar proportionally.  I reduced the sugar and the chocolate chips for the filling since I like a lighter taste.  don't skimp on the coconut cream - the international section of your grocery store should have it, buy the more expensive one that actually says coconut instead of "coconut extract in water."  Since i wanted a thicker coconut layer, i mixed less pudding into the chocolate chips.  Next time, i will trying using milk chocolate chips as suggested by one reviewer.  Great recipe, try it!

Not the greatest, and not a lot of flavor. Only change: used milk and coconut extract instead of coconut milk. Also topped with toasted coconut. It had a strange texture, but was a LOT better after chilling for a few hours. I guess after only one hour, it hadn't had enough time to set.

We really enjoyed this dessert. My coconut layer didn't set after about 6 hours in the fridge, so if I were to make this again I would do as others suggested and leave it in the fridge overnight. I used a pre-made shortbread crust with this and served with special dark chocolate syrup and toasted coconut on top. Also as suggested by other's I added a little bit over 1/2 tsp of coconut extract to the coconut layer, even with this the coconut flavor was very subtle so I can see how it would be lost without it. Thanks for the recipe:)

I used Cream of Coconut, not coconut milk after reading there wasn't enough coconut flavor. I also cut out some of the sugar since it's already sweet. It needed much longer than an hour to set up but it was worth it.

This was good, only next time I will cut back on the semi-sweet chocolate chips or maybe use milk chocolate. It was too rich for me, and my guests also agreed. Other than that it was good, I would have liked more of the haupia taste though. I also just topped with cool whip and piped it onto the pie and finished with toasted coconut flakes (put coconut flakes in oven for 5 minutes at 350 keep a close eye though it burns quickly).

I needed a dessert for my mom's birthday gathering. One of her favorite candy bars are mounds. I found this recipe and thought she would like the combination and the recipe seemed pretty easy. I followed the recipe and made no changes. I did chill the pie longer, like another reviewer suggested. After piping the whipped cream on I topped the pie with toasted coconut and chocolate curls. We all really liked the pie and I have noted to make this one again. Next time I want to add more coconut. The chocolate overpowered the coconut a little, but not enough for us to dislike it. I may try to add coconut flakes to the coconut pudding layer before I put the chocolate layer. Can't wait to make this again.

This recipe turned out better than I expected.  It was really easy to put together.  I put the white layer down first, then the chocolate, followed by the whipped topping.  I toasted some coconut and sprinkled that on top, and I used Splenda instead of sugar.  The pie turned out so pretty, and my guests were pleasantly surprised that this pie was not too sweet.  Thanks for a unique recipe!!

Loved it!  This was very easy to make.  I did add shredded coconut to the white layer, which I think was a big improvement.  I also garnished with toasted coconut.  A word of warning to anyone else who might not realize this: follow the directions on the package for baking the pie crust.  If you just bake it like the directions here say, it will puff up and be unusable.  You have to prick it like crazy with a fork to keep that from happening!

If I could give this more than 5 stars I definately would. I was looking for a great chocolate pie then I came across this and made it being that I love coconut too. The only thing I did different was to toast some coconut for the top along with some hershey bar shavings on top also.The filling did turn out to be enough for two pies which I gave one to my neighbor. I wish I wouldn't of. If I would of known how good this was I would of ate them both. This is now my favorite recipe.

This haupia pie is absolutely wonderful!! It is my Hubbie's favorite!! I  have been to Hawaii 3 times and each time I have gone to get pie at Ted's bakery. Sorry Ted, this one has you beat!!  I always cut back on sugar, so I used 3/4 cup instead of the cup and a scant 1/4 cup for the cream layer. I have made it so many times, I have lost count! Love it, Love it, Love it!! Thank you for posting it!

This pie is okay but not my favorite. The only thing that I changed was to add coconut extract and milk instead of coconuut milk. I also added coconut flakes on top. There is an interesting texture and not much of a coconut taste. If you made both layers all chocolate then I think it would taste better. It takes longer then 1 hour to chill, it gets better the longer that you let it chill.

very nice, everyone liked it.  I changed it to white chocolate since regular chocolate gives me migraines, I also added flaked coconut to the top layer.

I LOVE coconut, so, I tried this recipe...   Served a piece to my husband (He didn't know what I was making.)  His eyes got big and he said, THIS TASTES LIKE HAUPIA - Just like from home!!     Yup.  He was born and raised in Hawaii, So, taste approved from a Hawaiian native.  Thanks for the recipe.  :)

VERY rich, VERY sweet, and VERY delicious! Tip: Serve this in SMALL slices! A normal piece may be too much for some. It's very creamy, like a rich chocolate sundae. I made this exactly as written, and wouldn't change a thing. I think it is probably better as written, with a pastry shell, rather than a graham cracker crust. The pastry is a good counterpoint to all that sweetness. I have never had this type of pie before, so I had nothing to compare it too, but it's great!

I thought this recipe was ok, but what the heck is 7/8 of a cup?! I added what I thought for the chips, and it turned out to be WAY too many. I think that's a mistake. The coconut part was barely flavored coconut, and the chocolate part was too sweet. If I make it again, I'm making some big changes. Thanks for the idea.

Very good! My family are coconut freaks... I debating on adding coconut to white layer after reading the reviews and did it (1/2 cup). Tastes great and texture is still fine with the coconut in there.

I made this yesterday after making a coconut cream pie from this site and had a leftover baked pie crust and a can of light coconut milk. It good, but not as good as the coconut cream where I used a can of creme of coconut and coconut extract. The chocolate was overpowering using the semi-sweet chips. My husband is from Hawaii and although he seemed to remember this type of pie, he preferred the coconut cream too.

My tester palate was my friend who grew up in Hawaii and introduced us to the original Ted's pie in Oahu on our trip this past Thanksgiving.  She said it was pretty close to Ted's.  I used half Trader Joe's light coconut milk and then half regular fat coconut milk, and it still tasted fine (I was afraid if I went totally light, it might change the flavor too much).  I added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract to flavor the whipped topping.  Chocolate shavings and then mini semi-sweet chocolate chips strewn over the top completed it.  Next time, I will roll out the crust a little thinner (I used Trader Joe's frozen crusts) and will add 1/2 tsp coconut extract to the pudding mixture for more flavor.     This is definitely a staple of my recipe box.  It was so simple and looks gorgeous.

Very good and very easy. The chocolate layer was just like chocolate pudding, where the coconut layer was a little bit more firm. A interesting texture in a pie, but it tasted great.

this didn't thrill me, like I expected.  like several other comments stated, I was looking for more of a coconut flavor than came through.  the chocolate part was really good, but the coconut taste was almost non-existent.  otherwise, quantities were right on, I had no issue with it setting.. and it did make for a pretty presentation.  I put the white layer down first, layered with chocolate, then whipped cream.. I liked the look better than the pics with the white on top.

We just got back from Maui where we tried haupia and chocolate pie for the first time at Da Kitchen. I've been craving it ever since! Lucky for me I came across this recipe. My pie turned out excellent! I followed the recipe exactly as it was written; I think it was even better than the one we had on vacation. I'll be making this for many summers to come.   Thank you so much for sharing!

My husband and I just got back from our honeymoon in Hawaii.  While we were there we sampled the local favorite of chocolate Haupia pie.  Friday was my husband's birthday and when I asked him what kind of cake he wanted he said "do you think you could make that pie we had in Hawaii?"  This recipe was even better than the one we had there!!!!  Honestly! I used a pre-made crust from the refridgerator section and followed the recipe to a "T".  This is REAL chocolate Haupia pie and it is wonderful.  Will make again and again!!!

Seemed like too much cornstarch. It gave th filling an almost gelatin-like consistency. The flavor was good, just didn't like the "mouth feel"

very, very good and easy. To change a little I put the chocolate chips in one bowl and 6 oz. of shredded coconut in other bowl and poured hot mixture over both and stirred. Chips melt easily. Then put some toasted coconut and grated chocolate on top of whipped cream. I bet it would be great with an oreo or graham or anything you can think of crust.

I had trouble getting the coconut layer to set.  It always came out goopy when slicing the pie.  I read through a view tips online and it suggested that I boil it for a long enough time to get the cornstarch to break down and do its job.  Sure enough it worked!  But I boiled the haupia for wayyy too long and the chocolate layer ended up a bit too hard.  I will try again!

Delicious pie. It is true, the coconut flavor IS faint, so I added a layer of flaked coconut on top of both the chocolate and coconut pudding layers. This seemed to add the extra flavor that was needed. Also, I used a graham cracker crust (so good!) and a full cup of chocolate chips...very good & not too rich.

This is a really easy and very delicious dessert. I made it with a graham cracker crust rather than a pie shell for a dinner party and the entire pie was gone. I did not alter the filling recipe at all and would definitely make again.

This pie tastes like a Mounds bar! The only thing I did differently was that I added 1/2 cup flaked coconut to the white layer and it was awesome!! It's very easy to make, too. I will definitely be making this again...soon!

Last year I spent a week in Maui and I was introduced to a new dessert, Haupia Pie.  This pie, from Broke da Mouth Cookie Store (yes, that is the name) set a very high bar to try to reach if I were going to try to re-create the pie.  I had seen videos on how to make haupia pudding, and none seemed to convey the right methods for making the perfect pie.  I came across this recipe and made it for the first time a few months ago.  Since then, it has become a family favorite!  The flavors are wonderful and the recipe is fool-proof.  I use Ghirardelli 60% bittersweet chocolate chips, and in a lesser quantity than the recipe calls for, which gives a rich flavor.  I toast coconut and set to the side so that those who like it can add it on top.  This is a very memorable dessert and one which will surely get you lots of compliments!  Thank you so much for sharing!

This was very good, and easy too. I used a graham cracker crust to help save time, and added 1 tsp coconut flavoring to the white layer, after it had cooled. My family says it reminds them of an Almond Joy. I have made this many times and it always turns out well. Thanks for the great recipe!

This looked quick to prepare and with the ingredients readily available  on the property and in the house I decided to give it a go. The haupia was great with the addition of 1/2 teaspoon of real coconut extract and the toasted fresh shavings of  coconut on top of the whipped cream added a nice texture and additional coconut flavor. I would recommend reducing semi sweet morsels to about a half cup as they tend to overpower the coconut flavor at 1 1/4 cups.

My husband and I fell in love with Ted's Bakery Haupia Pie so I was excited to find this equally yummy recipe! Changes I made: used only 2 tbsp sugar to mix with the coconut milk (I don't have much of a sweet tooth), used unsweetened almond milk in place of dairy milk (lactose intolerant), used pre-made graham cracker crust, and I didn't bother adding the whipped cream part at the end. I think it would taste just as delicious if nothing was changed.

Delicious!

Based upon input from people that it didn't taste enough like coconut, I opted for milk chocolate instead of semisweet. The darker chocolate can overpower the subtleness of coconut. So, the coconut flavor is very strong now.

What else I would do different is cut the sugar by at least 1/4 to 1/3. For me, personally, it's too sweet.

This is going to look great with large shredded toasted coconut on top.

I didn't taste any coconut in this pie other than the toasted coconut I put on top. I'm not sure if I didn't get the right coconut milk or what it was. Although the chocolate was good. I will not be making this recipe again.

So delicious! I use a chocolate cookie crust when I make this pie. One of my friends at work is from Hawaii and told me about Haupia pie. I am so glad he did. My neighbor ate a piece and absolutely loved it. He asked me to make one for him. Chocolate and coconut cream topped off with whipped cream in a chocolate cookie crust! Need I say more? Yummy!

This is very good, but I found that the pie was a little too thick for my taste.  It's just a different type of pie.  I enjoyed it, and it was very fast to make, however I am used to the good old fashioned chocolate cream pie.  I will probably stick to that, but this was still very fun and easy to make!

Fabulous!!! i decreased the milk by half and added coconut rum and decreased sugar to half also...what a huge success!  also, i used milk instead of water with the cornstarch for a creamier texture..divine!  Got rave reviews.

This is soooo good! I went to make the pie, and realized that I only had half of the needed chocolate chips. So I used 1/4 of the filling and mixed the melted chocolate chips in. I used half of the coconut pudding in the bottom layer, then I put a layer of the chocolate mixture on top and finally, topped it all off with another layer of coconut pudding. When it was set, it looked absolutely amazing with the thin ribbon of chocolate running through it!

I don't know what happened -- my top layer ended up being very rubbery.  The chocolate layer is delicious and smooth, but I've just been peeling off the top layer and eating the chocolate part.

I made this pie for a holiday potluck. I followed the recipe exactly & it turned out perfect. It was delicious & everyone who tried it loved it. I did use chopped nuts on the top rather than coconut or chocolate. I read all the reviews & some people had a problem with getting the filling to set. That was not an issue as I cooked the filling for a full 3 minutes after it came to a boil. Shorting that process will result in a runnier filling. I have had pie like this in Hawaii & I felt this recipe was very close to the ones there.

This is really good! Its light and airy, great for a sweet tooth but not too sweet. I might use a little less chocolate next time so the coconut stands out more because i'm a coconut fan, but it was great as is. I might even throw some banana on top, because for some reason I was craving banana with this! LOL. Thanks!

My guests liked this..the coconut pudding however is NOT noticable at all. The chocolate overpowers. The coconut (toasted) on top gave it a hint..but, the pudding is not very sweet either.

Excellent pie! Made one pie as the recipe and then just changed the layers of chocolate and white for next pie. Everyone loved it and I was asked to make it again, very easy.

Although this recipe tasted fabulous, it was rather unappetizing to look at. The pie was, um, oozey, and my family said the coconut layer looked like "snot" and "jellyfish". Looking back I wonder if I grabbed cream of coconut instead of coconut milk? I'm sure it was coconut milk, but who knows... will definitely try this again and will make sure to use coconut MILK and serve ice cold.

Not enough coconut flavor for my taste - though still very delicious! I thought the chocolate overtook the coconut and that flavor disappeared.   Adding shredded coconut inside the pudding @ the end or even the optional topping (which I didn't have on-hand) would have helped.

This did not go over very well at a recent get together.  The coconut portion of the pie was overpowered by the taste cornstarch, and it also did not set up well, despite being refrigerated overnight. The chocolate portion was just ok; perhaps milk chocolate chocolate chips would have given it a better flavor.  The best part of  this pie was the cream cheese pie crust I made for it.... Would not make again.

I made a deep dish graham cracker crust to put the filling in. Other than that, and adding a tablespoon of coconut extract to the filling, I followed the recipe to the letter. Results? The pie is beautiful to look at, with the white haupia sitting atop the chocolate layer. Seeing that some reviewers said the haupia stayed runny, I refrigerated the pie overnight (before adding the whipped topping), so it was quite firm and sliced solidly. It presented very nicely on the serving plates. Unfortunately, "pretty to look at" does not necessarily equal a tasty treat. The haupia was the consistency of Jell-O, which some reviewers warned of, but which I did not think would be all that bad. Much to my dismay, I did not care at all  for the rubbery texture, and I was not pleased with the fact that no real coconut flavor came through, despite using high-quality coconut milk and coconut extract. The chocolate layer was the dominant flavor, so if I ever make this again, which is highly doubtful, I will double the chocolate and mix all of the haupia with the chocolate, which mitigates the rubbery, gelatinous texture of the haupia. Thanks for something different to try, anyway, but I completely fail to see what all the fuss is about. This pie is mediocre, at best.

ETA Tip:  Don't bother melting the chocolate before hand.  Just add it to the divided portion and stir and it will melt.
This pie is outstanding, it was simple and only took a few minutes to make.  The recipe made two pies using pre-made graham cracker crusts.   I made these changes I added to 1 teaspoon of coconut extract.  For the chocolate layer I used 1/2 cup of milk chocolate chips 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips.  I added 1 cup of coconut to the other layer.  After trial in error I found that reducing the corn starch made the pie runny so I recommend using the full 1/2 cup that the recipe calls for.  By far the best pie I have eaten.  So delicious.

I have made this recipe twice now and like it much better with milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet.  Also, I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup instead of 1 cup.  This is a very good pie and easy to make.

I've made this pie several times.  This Christmas my family picked it over pecan pie, key lime pie and red velvet cake!  The recipe is good just as it's written.  To make it better I always add 1 Tablespoon of coconut extract to the part you boil.  Then I add 1/2 cup coconut flakes to the coconut layer.  We usually have to cut the last slice in several pieces to avoid a fight.  Great!

I hate to review recipes that I didn't try exactly, but I did tweak it after reading the reviews, and it turned out perfectly.    I used more coconut milk in place of the water, and put all the coconut milk in the pan to boil.  I mixed the cornstarch with the cow's milk, then added it as per the recipe.  I used 3/4 cup chocolate chips, and mixed them with about 1/3 of the coconut mixture.  It was REALLY yummy, the chocolate was not overpowering at all, and you could taste the coconut flavor.

This pie was really good. I did add a tsp of coconut extract to the cocnut layer and it did give a bit of artificial flavor. I think next time I would add shredded coconut instead. This pie has a very smooth silky texture. I did read some reviews where people commented on it being like chowder? My only suggestion is whisk, whisk, and whisk. Make sure to constantly whisk it while its on the stove and then get the mixture poured into the pie crust as soon as possible and give it a good whisk right before pouring it in.  As other reviews said the chocolate layer is pretty rich so stick with the 7/8 cup or even reduce a little. I also used an oero grahm crust and it was very good.

I made this with a coconut crust (by pressing sweetened coconut and butter into the bottom pie plate and baking it for 15 mins and cooling it prior to making the filling) 
I also added some coconut and vanilla  extract to the heavy cream to make it more coconutty! 
It was a big BIG hit at my christmas party 2 people told me it was the best pie they had ever eaten. 

MY only complaint is that it needs to cool a long time before it is ready to sliced, I reccomend making it the day before you plan to serve it, because it seemed to need a full 24 hours to cool and solidify completely.  (the leftover( not that there was much)was BETTER)

This was really different in texture than any pie filling I've made. I knew that from reading the stuff from the submitter but wanted to give it a whirl anyway. It wasn't a bummer and it didn't taste bad, just not really to our liking. FYI - I did add coconut extract & used milk chocolate chips like other users and still found the coconut layer to be kind of bland and the chocolate to be over powering. The best part of the pie to me was what I garnished it with - toasted coconut flakes and toasted macadamia nuts. Otherwise, I am not making it again but if you are brave and like a gelatin type of texture, you should go for it!

This is a wonderful recipe!!! I made it for my Hawaiian father-in-law and he was very impressed. Very easy to make. I felt like a professional. I added almond extract to the whipped topping and it tasted amazing...Thank you so much for this one!!!

I've made this 3 times and should stick to making this a deep dish crust as it truly needs  the deep dish  to make it look beautiful with the  separate layers.  This will be a family classic now. Thanks for making me look like a slaved over the stove.

This pie is great!  I added 1/2 teaspoon of coconut extract for a stronger flavor and some shredded coconut for a different texture to the non-chocolate filling.

This was way easier to make than I thought it would be and it turned out SO incredibly yummy! After the pie initially chilled for about an hour, I pressed shredded coconut all over the top of it, spooned on the whipped cream and then topped with lots of toasted coconut and chocolate chips.  Not only did it taste phenomenal, it turned out beautifully! This is definitely going into my "hall of fame" recipes!!!

really good recipe.  Different than any choc. pie I have ever had, but the coconut flavor could have been stronger and it would have been 5 stars.

I would give this 4 1/2 stars. This was pretty good. I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9 X 13 for a luau party. I also made a graham cracker crust, and toasted a bag of coconut to put on top. I think this is a must. Also, to lighten it up I used cool whip instead of heavy whipping cream. The other party goers seemed to like it.

This pie was easy to make, but I must admit that I am a little disappointed. I should have added some shredded coconut or coconut extract to the white layer. The flavor was a bit too mild for my taste. On the good side, my company absolutely adored it!! :)

I fell off my diet for this and it was worth it! Yes, maybe the haupia was a bit in the background, but taken all together the flavors were marvelous. So satisfying. Please may I have some more?

This pie is wonderful!! Next time I will try using less chocolate though, I think it overpowered the delicate haupia flavor of the white layer. My other suggestion would be to double this recipe and make 2 pies!!

This was a hit!  When I first tasted the white coconut milk mixture, I thought it would be too light; however, the rich chocolate part of the filling adds great depth.  I used a store-bought oreo cookie crust and took the suggestion to layer the coconut, then chocolate, then whipped crea for the layered look.  I also mixed in shredded coconut because I like the texture.

Very easy to make. Loved the Haupia taste. Not to thick but just right. I think I put in a little too much chocolate, but it still was very tasty.

This haupia pie recipe is onolicious (“delicious” to The locals in Hawaii)!!!! I followed the recipe without making changes. The sweetness is perfect - not overly sweet like many chocolate pies. Whenever I bring it to dinner parties, people always ask for a second serving! It gets such rave reviews that it is a frequent request at potlucks.

I think it was my own error but it was taking a lot longer for the mixture to thicken up so I added more cornstarch. I also made sure to use high quality milk chocolate. I used one can of coconut milk and one can of coconut cream (the super asian kinds). I doubled the recipe and brought it to my family's hawaiian themed party. My family is from Hawaii and they were all thrilled to have a bit of aloha on the main island.  Next time I'll make the time to make my own crust. This is a very forgiving recipe and I also followed the other users and refrigerated this overnight. Great recipe if you're familiar with Ted's pies.

Excellent! Not too sweet. I was looking for a Polynesian dessert for a Tiki Party I was attending and found this recipe.  Everyone loved it! Very easy too make, elegant and flavorful. I found several recipes for this and the only thing I added was 1 TBS. of coconut extract. 
This made a lot! I filled 45 mini filo dough cups and had enough leftover for an 8" deep dish. I painted the insides of the shells with melted chocolate to keep the crust from getting soggy, topped with fresh whipped cream with a little 10X sugar so it wouldn't be too sweet. Garnished with toasted coconut and chocolate shavings. Wish I had taken a photo, they were very pretty as well as delicious! Will definitely make again! Thanks for the recipe!

I made as written.  For me it was just okay.  I think the chocolate took over the coconut and I personally didn't think flavors melded well together.  My husband on the other hand really liked it.

This recipe would be 5 stars but for the fact that it was too sweet, almost sickeningly sweet! I would recommend cutting the 1 cup white sugar to half and using more dark chocolate or even some cocoa powder when cooking the filling.  That would make it better.

I cut lots of sugar from the recipe, barely use half of the sugar amount and added coconut cream vs coconut milk, also added a pinch of salt in it. Turn out very nice and coconuty. Will add coconut extract for my next one to enhance the flavour.

I loved this! Perfect recipe for the coconut haupia. As far as the crust goes, I just bought a graham cracker crust and then for the chocolate part I did a box of family size fudge pudding. For the pudding to be thicker and creamier, I just used less milk than the pudding instructions call for. Overall though, I will be using this recipe again and again

This amount is best with a deep crust. I toasted shredded sweetened coconut  and sprinkled it and shaved chocolate over the top. The chocolate in the pie rich so cutting the amount of chocolate would work if its too much for you, but we loved it!

As written I think it is too sweet.  I will reduce the sugar.  I used regular pie crusts and it made two.  I will use the deep pie  crust next time.  The can of coconut milk only came in 13oz it is tasted fine.  I will make this again!  Thank you for the recipe.

I went in search of an Haupia Pie recipe after visiting Ted's Bakery in Hawaii.  This recipe is a knockout!  I've made it several times.  I find the chocolate layer a bit rich as written...it overpowers the coconut flavor (maybe it was the chocolate chips I used)...so I reduced the chips to about 3/4C the last couple times, and liked it better.  Thanks for the awesome recipe!  I know I'll continue to make this for years to come.

Next time I will add 1/2 milk chocolate chips with the semi sweet to give an even lighter chocolate flavor.  This pie was delicious as is though. 
I made this bc my husband and I just moved to the mainland and were craving Teds! Mahalo for this recipie.

This pie did not even set correctly. You would think with the amount of cornstarch it would have firmed up. We had to put it in the freezer for a couple hours so it wasn't so runny. Tasted just ok and would not recommend this recipe.

I agree with some of the other reviewers- next time I will make it with a bit less chocolate (which I *cannot* believe I am saying)!! 
I also agree with some of the other posters that, if you are getting the pre-made graham cracker pie crust, you could really almost make two pies out of this recipe. There is A LOT of liquid in this. 
And finally, if anyone can tell me why my pie (even after about 4 hours in the fridge) could still not be sliced into beautiful single pieces (rather than falling apart), PLEASE let me know! :D (

The consistency that the 1/2 cup cornstarch was too much like jello.  It didn't seem to effect the chocolate layer, but my boys don't like it.  A little disappointed.

I changed water and milk to all coconut milk to give it fuller flavour,  added chocolate to all the mix which set like a truffle mix,  and added coconut rum to cream topping to give a coconut kick,  everyone wanted seconds !!!!

Beautiful, delicious pie. I made it exactly according to the recipe, including whisking the custard like crazy while it was coming, and it came out perfectly. It was sliceable and pretty darn good after an hour in the fridge, but it was absolutely amazing the next day. We really liked the jello-like texture of the haupia layer and the rich chocolatey velvet of the chocolate layer. Personally I also preferred the whipped cream on top of the haupia layer, I think it helped give more of a contrast with the chocolate.

This pie is beautiful, and has a light, creamy texture. But I won't be making it again. We found it rather bland. Despite subbing half the milk with additional coconut milk, the coconut flavor is very subtle. And the chocolate flavor wasn't all the strong either. If you want an incredible coconut cream pie, try old fashioned coconut cream pie on this site. 
If you do make this, I recommend using a graham cracker crust; it's a great foil for the custard. Replace half the milk with coconut milk, and reduce the cornstarch to 1/3 cup — no more is needed. To save a step, use mini chocolate chips and simply pour half the custard mixture over them and stir; it will melt right in.

i liked it and after realizing the gelatin like consistency is supposed to be that way, i give it three stars. i thought it was a mistake at first,but if its supposed to be that way then ok, pretty good. i liked someones idea of adding coconut extract to the white layers. i actually looked for some in my cupboard but didn't have any, so next time that would be the way to go, i like more coconut flavor!

OMG! Rich and decadent. My husband said it tasted like a very expensive gourmet chocolate cream pie.  Only complaint was I couldn't taste coconut. Next time i will add coconut extract.Can't wait to make this for our Easter family dinner.

This is great - better than Ted's!  I get great reviews from everyone - even people who don't like coconut. I often use Ghirardelli 60% cacao chips for a darker, richer chocolate layer, but sometimes I use milk chocolate for a lighter flavor. Coconut cream (Trader Joe's is my favorite when on the mainland) instead of coconut milk makes it even better. I don't bother melting the chocolate ahead of time - the heat from the haupia right off the stove is sufficient - just stir well.

I made this for a Hawaiian style dinner party (my husband is from Honolulu), and everyone loved it! Like some have commented, be careful to use exactly the amount of chocolate called for; I used 1/4 cup more than the recipe lists and the chocolate flavor was a bit overpowering for the delicate coconut flavor.

Make sure your pie crust is baked well; otherwise, it will get soggy. I had to place coins on foil on top of the crust while baking so that it wouldn't rise.

Lastly, be sure to cool it in the fridge for at least 3 hours; 1 just isn't enough for it to be chilled through and result in a super clean slice.

Absolutely delicious! It is now a family favorite and I am going to share it for our daughter's International Food Day at her school. I used canned coconut milk meant for making pina coladas and it was fantastic. In a pinch, I used a store-bought graham cracker crust, but it works well with homemade pastry crust too. The funny thing is, I never liked coconut anything until I tried this recipe. Thanks HOKU3! Don't try to make it healthy or you'll ruin it. :)

I made this for a Christmas potluck at work and it was a huge hit! I used a pre-made graham cracker crust (b/c I'm lazy). I also toasted some coconut to put on top. This was actually easy to make and tasted great!! I will make again!

I just made this pie and the recipe is perfect just the way it is.  The coconut to chocolate ratio is perfectly balanced.  The recipe says to melt the chocolate chips first, but all you have to do is pour the hot haupia over the chocolate chips and stir until they're melted.  I am making this for Thanksgiving tomorrow.

As written, it needs more coconut flavoring for my liking. I adjusted the recipe as such: used a large pre-made graham crust (which I baked at 350 for 5 mins. prior to filling); I added 2 tsp coconut extract and 1 C. flaked coconut to pudding prior to separating; reduced sugar to 3/4 C and reduced chips to 1 C.; I substituted a scant 1/4 C. confectioners sugar for the white sugar in the whipping cream; allowed both layers of pudding to cool before filling - then topped with whipped cream; allowed 4 hours for pie to set in fridge; topped it w/toasted coconut and slivered almonds - it was a hit with our guests this weekend!

This was terrific! I used Oreo cookie crust and cool whip as the topping.  I also shaved and toasted some fresh coconut and sprinkled it on top, it was delicious. I loved how easy this was to make. I am giving it 4 stars because I find it was missing coconut flavor and was really sweet.  Next time I will use less sugar, I will add some shredded coconut to my Oreo crumb crust and use more coconut milk and less regular milk.

Sooo ono (delicious)! I keep forgetting to try it with the haupia on the bottom! I think it'd taste better AND look better. This pie is a winnah (winner)! I'm from HI too and this stuff is legit. One of my HI friends said taste "mo bettah" then Teds. I used homemade pie crust. I also used a bit less chocolate chips and made less chocolate haupia because the chocolate is strong enough. (I used Ghiradelli chocolate.) Like other reviewers, I would also make this way in advance and let it stiffen up for AT LEAST 4 hrs. Not only does it make it look nicer, but it also tastes better when the haupia is the right jello-esque consistency. I sprinkled some chocolate chips on the top (cause I didnt have shavings) which was delicious and pretty! Oh - just use your handmixer to whip the heavy cream... so easy! People were fighting for the leftovers.

Just tried this recipe for the first time last night. The only chocolate haupia pie I've ever had was from Ted's Bakery. I'm not sure how I feel about it. Not sure if I kept it on the stove for too long but the haupia is too wobbly (if thats a word). I set 1 for a few hours and didn't like the consistency. The other one I left over night and I like it better but the ratio of chocolate haupia to haupia wasn't even. So I'm making another batch right now with more haupia (cause thats what I like) and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the consistency is better. I don't want to have to fly to Hawaii every time I have a craving for this wonderful treat. :)

This was hardly a coconut lovers dream pie.  The coconut was lost in the chocolate and cream.  It did not set after being in the fridge for 7 hours.  Will not make again.

So far I've only tried making the puddings and they are delicious. I thought the flavors were perfectly sweet, if not overly sweet and had a lot of coconut flavor. I can still remember the taste of Ted's pie that I had a few weeks ago on my last trip to Oahu and this is a good interpretation but not as perfectly balanced in sweetness and richness as Ted's. I will definitely make the whole pie soon though.

I was so excited to make this because it sounded so good and I had all the ingredients. I found it to be a bit too sweet - maybe from too much chocolate in the top layer? I think the next time I make this I will use an Oreo crust lined with banana slices, and leave out the chocolate (I know, it sounds crazy - no chocolate?!?!)

Sooo good! Great pie, easy to make. I used my frozen homemaid pie crust, so it went really fast. Being hawaiian and spending my summers and holidays on Oahu, I've indulged in many island treats and this pie sends me back in time.

i made this in November for thanksgiving and it fell apart. it was like soup. i think the problem was that it didn't thicken enough. i made it again for Christmas eve. This time i could feel it thicken way more than before. instead of using a regular pie crust i used left-over sugar cookie dough. i was so proud of myself when i cut the pie on Christmas eve and to see perfect layers of white and brown. thanks for the recipe, i will make it for special occasions all the time.

I made individual tartlette shells and piped in the chocolate layer.  The plain coconut "pudding" was thin enough that I just spooned it in.  I finished off by piping on the whipped cream and sprinkling with toasted coconut and chocolate shavings.  Though I did not get a chance to sample this dessert, it was the first of three different sweets to disappear.  Obviously my friends loved it, so I'm giving it 5 starts.  Can't wait to make it again so I can try it!

Very Good and Very Easy to make.  I made it exactly as listed and it turned out perfect.  The obnly thing I may do next time is add coconut to the white portion to give it some texture.

This pie was super yummy and pretty easy to make. The only complaint I have is that there was SOOOO much filling. Next time I make this, I will split it up between two pie shells. It will be perfect then. I did add 1 cup coconut to the white pudding filling and topped with chocolate chips and coconut.

The pie was good, but the flavor is very mild. It just kind of tastes like you're eating corn starchy pudding with sugar. I would like a more intense flavor.

Oh my goodness! This is amazing! Since I don't live near Ted's Bakery in HI anymore I thought I'd never get my chocolate haupia fix again. I was wrong. This is great! Thank you for posting!!!

This was absolutely delicious! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I could not detect a coconut flavor at all. I made the recipe exactly as stated, even topping it with toasted coconut, but the coconut flavor was just not there. I read through the reviews and didn't see this happening to anyone else. Maybe the brand of coconut milk I used???? The next time I make this, and there will be a next time, I will add some coconut extract to it and maybe that'll do the job. I am giving this recipe no less than 4 stars because it was super simple to prepare, came out beautifully and really was delicious, just not coconutty. Thanks for sharing. :)

My family was expecting German chocolate cake, but I wanted to rebel and do something different.  When I took the lid off the cake taker they said, "Oh...pie."  But after they took the first bite they said, "WOW!"  This pie is fantastic.  I made only two tiny changes--I added some coconut flavoring, like others suggested, and I toasted  some coconut to add to the top pudding layer, and I sprinkled some on top of the whipped cream with chocolate shavings.  Fantstic!

This tasted amazing, and it was so easy!  My boyfriend is from Hawaii, so I decided to make this because he loves Haupia. I've tried the version from Ted's Bakery, and just like everyone else said, this is the equivalent or better!    I used a premade graham cracker crust, and it tasted so good! I only used 1 cup of heavy whipping cream because that is all I had left, and it was more than enough whipped cream to cover the pie. I don't think coconut extract is needed as others have suggested, Haupia is usually a light coconut taste, not heavy!

So so good!! Although I renamed it in my recipe box " almond joy pie". I added 2/3cup shaved almonds to chocolate mixture and 1 cup coconut to white mixture, then topped the whip topping with toasted coconut and chocolate shaveings.Great presentation and tasted just like an almond joy! The only thing I would do different next time is refrigerate it longer.

An amazingly simple recipe.  Luscious and chocolaty with the right touch of coconut. Based on the other reviews, I was concerned that the haupia would be too firm... so I used only 2/3 the recommended cornstarch and the end result was just right.

When going to Ted's Bakery on Oahu wasn't realistic, this pie is a pretty close. I've always been scared of making custard/cream pies, but this was so easy and I had most of the ingredients in my pantry. I used a little more chocolate than listed to get that richer, chocolate color & taste to the pudding.

I have never tried haupia before, so I can`t compare this with a real Hawaiian haupia. This pie has a nice flavor, although chocolate layer was a little overpowering. But the texture leaves much to be desired. This is not pie, but chowder texture, especially chocolate layer. Very difficult to prevent a mess. I don`t know, maybe haupia must have such texture, but this was the thing I didn`t like so much.

Aloha Kakou! Onolicious!  I prefer deep chocolate.  Next time I will use a third of the haupia to mix with the choc chips.  Half of the haupia mix with the deep choc overwhelmed the light flavor of the coconut.  Will definitely take to the next Hawaiian Civic Club pot luck! Mahalo!

The pie was pretty good, but I have to agree that the coconut layer was lacking flavor. It needed something extra. I used close to 1 cup of chocolate chips and that was too chocolatey. I used the Healthier Graham Cracker Crust from this site and topped the pie with bananas.

This pie was ok. It didn't have a lot of flavor. Next time I would decrease the chocolate layer and maybe top with toasted coconut.

Yummy. Followed other's advice, less chocolate layer, added coconut to white layer. Couldn't find coconut milk so used regular milk with coconut extract. Also used microwave rather than stove top. Tasted a lot like eating a huge Mounds candy bar! So good.

I was a little disappointed with this recipe.  I was excited to try it out, but thought the flavors were a little weird together.  My chocolate layer was way too overpowering and the coconut layer lacked major flavor.  If I was to make again I would cut down on the amount of chocolate chips used and add some coconut extract to make the coconut flavor stand out.  Plus, the middle layers texture was a little too much for me, it turned into almost a solid gel instead of a creamy pudding.

I took this pie to a potluck and it was all eaten. I did like the taste of it, but I liked the chocolate layer much more than the plain coconut layer. I think if I ever make it again I will just make it all with chocolate. I garnished with some toasted coconut and chocolate chips.

This was a great recipe.  Went to Hawaii for a visit and fell in love with Teds Haupia pie.  This recipe is a great reminder of it!  I followed the recipe and made a few changes, added about 1/4 cup more choco chips as one reviewer suggested.  I also added a little less sugar than the recipe called for in the haupia mixture.  This resulted in a pie that was great tasting but not too sweet!  For an added touch I toasted some sweetened coconut and sprinkled on the top.  The pie got great reviews.  This recipe made enough for two pies.  One to serve and one to keep! lol. I'll surely be making this again! Thanks for the recipe!

Definitely delicious!!  I added sweet coconut shavings to the white portion of the filling and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I might add that coconut extract next time for a stronger flavor, but overall, a wonderful recipe and so easy.

I have been exposed to something new and I am in Love! This pie is an awesome summer day treeat. It is a very mild cocount flavor. I would almost like to make the pie all chocolate mix, instead of layering it. It's yummy and easy to make.

I really loved this recipe.  It has a wonderfully pleasantly mild taste.  The only thing I did wrong was to overcook my pie crust (reason for the 4 stars otherwise, I'd give it a 5 star. No fault of the submitter). I made this around Thanksgiving and I was working on a million things at a time and forgot to check the pie crust. Next time I may try this recipe with a graham cracker crust. I definitely will make again. Thank you!!

I was excited to make this pie but was disapointed with the results.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The corn starch gave the pie a thick texture, particularly in the white layer and it was just too overpowering - not creamy like I was expecting.  I had printed the recipe but promptly threw it out after all my children and my husband gave negative reviews.

this was okay the first night, but got better the following night, but I think I may have done sone something wrong the chocolate flavor over powered the coconut. I'm going try and make this again.

This recipe turns out as beautiful as the picture. I accidentally bought a can of Jamaican coconut "water with pulp", but figured it would work fine -- it did. A gorgeous presentation, and very, very good to eat! I put toasted coconut and chocolate shavings on top.

Wonderful!  This pie is great because none of the flavors are individually overpowering, but they come together very nicely.  Topped with toasted coconut and chopped chocolate, the presentation is beautiful with very little effort.

I was really excited to try this pie based on the great reviews.  However, I was a little disappointed.  It was really easy to make, and the layer with the chocolate was good, but the white layer was really overpowered with all the cornstarch, I thought.
