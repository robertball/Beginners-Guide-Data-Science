I made this for a New Years Eve party. Due to the hosts not liking black olives, I left them out. I used 2 small stalks of green onion and cherry tomatoes instead of roma. I blended all ingredients in a food processor. I forgot to take a picture and when I went back to get one, all the pieces were gone. I got great compliments from party guests. I'll definitely make this recipe again.
