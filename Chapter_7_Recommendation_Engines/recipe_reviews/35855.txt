I am a huge fan of casseroles and I eat almost everything but this was not a hit at my house.  It's not that it lacked taste but rather, just not the right blend of tastes.  Thanks anyways!

I had a pound of hamburger and 3 hungry men coming in for dinner.  I scanned the Allrecipes site for something new and found this.  At first, I wasn't too sure it would "pass inspection", but after my picky 12 yr. old helped himself to a third serving, I knew I'd found a winner.  This dish is going in the family recipe book.  Thanks Amy!

i thought it was "okay" the first night, then after reheating leftovers i knew i didn't like it... not a good blend of flavors - one of them needs to be stronger, i think :)

This casserole was well received by my family.  I did make some modifications: I first cooked the onions for a few minutes, then added minced garlic (instead of using garlic powder) and cooked that for a few minutes.  To add some more vegetables (and color) to the casserole, I added diced carrots, green bell peppers and celery while the onions were cooking - and then added the meat to cook.  I also used ground turkey instead of beef.  I may consider adding peas next time I make this.  I did not add sliced mushrooms since no one in our family likes them and I used 99% fat free soups.  I also added some italian seasoning on top of the salt and pepper.  Finally, as others suggested, I used sharp cheddar cheese.  My husband had three helpings and asked me to add it to our regular rotation!

Very delicious recipe. Like a homemade version of hamburger helper, but better. Left out the mushrooms, still was good. Also very quick and easy...will probably make again.

My family loves this recipe.  It's easy to make.  You can add different meats such as italian sausage or add pepperoni along with the hamburger.

I made a lot of substitutions, depending on what I had on hand.  I used 1 lb of ground turkey, 8 oz tomato sauce in place of tomato soup, sharp cheddar cheese instead of american, and no mushrooms.  I thought it was quite good and easy.  1 lb. seemed enough meat for us.  I will keep this recipe.

Very easy and very tasty.
Having lived in England for the past two years.. I found that I miss the strangest things from back home in the US.. Hamburger Helper is one of them.  This reminded me ALOT of Hamburger Helper.. needless to say. .I loved it... and so did my picky eater husband.

This was easy to prepare and all the kids really liked it.  It reminded us of Hamburger Helper, but much better.  In fact, I don't even like Hamburger Helper, but did like this.

Fantastic, good easy, enough for a 9x13.  My picky three year old enjoyed this too.  It's going to be a keeper at our house.  I did, however, make some alterations.  Having no tomato soup I used an 8oz can of tomato sauce and threw in some italian seasonings.  Good.

I made this for company.  They gobbled it up.  No complaints.  Since I don't really care for American cheese, I replaced it with cheddar.

This was very good, qucik and easy. my husband and kids hate mushrooms so I didnt add them, I wish I could have. I did add the cream of mushroom and they didnt notice. Everyone loved it, of course I added a few extra spices to give it a little kick. I will make this again.

Not bad, but not what I was looking for.  I thought this would be more like Amish casserole, but it was far from it.  Extremely cheesy and I would have liked more of a tomato taste.  Would use diced tomatos instead of tomato soup.

My husband thought this was good but I found it to be bland and odd-tasting.  I added Accent prior to baking but I felt it was missing something.  I'd probably use sharp cheddar next time and perhaps some garlic salt but I doubt I'll make this again.

This recipe was really good and really easy. I did exactly what the recipe called for except I added 4 cloves of fresh garlic in the latter part of cooking the beef and onions and I added ground oregano and italian seasoning when I mixed in the soups.  I will make this again!  Thanks!

Very tasty. The processed American Cheese made the sauce nice and creamy. My daughter got mad because there weren't any left overs.

This was awesome!  I was looking for something quick, without a lot of ingredients.  This did not taste like the typical soup-based casserole.  It was very creamy and rich.  I did use fresh mushrooms that I sauteed with the ground beef, and used American cheese.  Hubby couldn't stop eating this one!

This was pretty good, as far as quick casseroles go.  Had to make some changes: only 1lb of beef and no mushrooms.  And added a clove of garlic, instead of powder.  Used sharp cheddar instead of american cheese.  Also threw in a can of peas and some rosemary, marojam and thyme to liven things up a bit.  Good supper!

This one worked for us! The kids loved it!  I substituted grated sharp cheddar for the American and eliminated the onions and mushrooms because the kids won't them. I did add back a little onion powder to make up for it.  I will keep this one.

Very easy to put together and satisfied the whole family. The leftovers heat up very nicely too. I think the next time I make this I'll proably spice it up more as our family loves very flavored foods. The recipe does make a good base to start from though and it's a cinch to make! Thanks so much Amy!!!

I just didn't find anything special about this recipe.  My husband liked it, but he likes everything! It wasn't "bad", but it wasn't great.  It tasted like I had just thrown together whatever I could find in the pantry.

Good, but will also try half the tomato soup it calls for.

Delicious! It's everything it claims to be - I had the ingredients on hand (even when my cupboard was bare), it's easy to make, and everyone loved it. Thank you so much Amy!
