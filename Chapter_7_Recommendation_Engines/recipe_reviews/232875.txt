I was a little concerned when I saw that the color was so light - I expected a darker brown color.  BUT, they baked up perfectly!  I made cupcakes and they made nice little 'domes' when they baked and they were very moist!  So unlike nearly all of the g/f box mixes I've tried.  This one is definitely a keeper!

This cake was delicious! I made it in a bundt & topped it with chocolate butter cream and it was super rich! My friends didn't even notice it was gluten free. It's a little denser and rich than your average cake mix, I likened it to a "cakey-brownie" I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Loved this recipe! A friend is gluten intolerant, but loves her desserts.  This is a wonderful way to give her both.  I cooked in as a bundt cake, and served it with a homemade mango frosting.

This chocolate cake is some of the best chocolate cake I have ever made/tasted. I made it for my boyfriend's daughter's 8th birthday tonight (my son and I are gluten-free and I wanted us to all be able to share the same cake), and everyone at the table raved about how good the cake was. That is really saying a lot, too, because both my boyfriend and his daughter are incredibly picky eaters. I HIGHLY recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a delicious, moist chocolate cake that will please everybody at the table, whether they're used to eating gluten-free or not. :)

I didn't care for this. On the other hand, my kids loved it and others at the party said it wasn't a bad flavor or texture.  I was looking for a light moist chocolate cake. What I got was a dense spongey cake that seemed way too wet even though I cooked it for longer than the directions suggested. The flavor was off too but that had to have been my flour blend. The sorghum in it was too strong.

I was sceptical that mayo and hot water would work but this is delicious. I paired it with simple chocolate whipped cream frosting and served it for valentines dinner. Very rich! My family didnt even know it was GF. I did try some cake without frosting and have to say the GF flour made the cake taste a little off to me so you definitely want to plan on using frosting. Also make sure your flour doesnt already contain baking soda and xantham gum before you add it.

Delicious and moist as others have said.  My non-GF family prefers it.  Cooking time was 35 minutes.  As my GF flour already had xanthan gum, I didn't add that ingredient and it came out fine.  New to GF so the mayo and no eggs concerned me but fears were unfounded.  Superb recipe without exotic GF ingredients.

Very good. I used bundt pan, so needed to cook it a little longer. Made the night before, kept in fridge then frosted with homemade chocolate butter cream frosting. Has a cake/brownie texture.....Yum will make again!!

I would suggest letting it sit for about 30 minutes before you bake it, then. Make sure it's not MORE than 1 1/2 c. hot water, and that the mayo is regular, full fat. I generally bake GF goods at 25 degrees less than recommended, and bake them longer. Good luck! Hope your next one turns out!

The binder (xanthan gum) is CRITICALLY important.  I was not able to find xanthan gum at the last minute, so we tried another binder, chia seeds.  We didn't use enough chia seed, first soaked in water, and like other gluten-free recipes without a binder the consistency will be a problem.  So without the xanthan gum, the taste was spot on, the cake was moist, but it didn't hold together well.  The guests didn't mind it too much cause it was healthier than other cakes, and we used a cream cheese icing which went really well.  Second, pay careful attention to the baking time!  We used 30 minutes as a guideline for our first attempt, but with convection ovens the times are shortened, and we could've pulled out the cake at 15-20 minutes with a 9" round pan.  Lastly, we used whole mayo, not low-fat with whole ingredients, which we feel helped the moistness of the cake.

In any case, we're going to try this again, but next time with actual xanthan gum, and may use more to get more binding. Oh we used trader joe's non-gluten flour, which is Rice based.  I'd like to try another non-Wheat flour next time, maybe even oat.

I followed all of the directions in the recipe and when it was cooking it got really fluffy, but when I took it out and let it cool as the directions said, it . and it was just gross. I will probably never make this again.

I tried this cake recipe and was a little disappointed...it rose up really big in the oven  then deflated once it cooled down.  The xanthum gum makes it really marshmellowey, and gumby. I wasn't a big fan of it. If you like marshmellows you will probably like this cake. The flavor is good but the texture is weird. Probably won't make this one again.

OK, it didn't turn out for me.  I followed this recipe to the letter, except that I used a 9x13 pan.  I baked until toothpick came out clean, but the consistence of the cake was very very gooey.  Not even like a very moist cake, almost like a pudding.  Maybe I could have baked longer, but like I said, the toothpick came out clean.  Hmmmm.

I made this just now and did not enjoy it so much. While I was skeptical when the batter looked gooey and glumpy, I powered on victoriously with hope. However, after taking it out of the oven, it seemed a little more pliable and sticky than the average cake. Evermore, I still continued on my journey, but after frosting and chilling this cake, I cut into it and found it had a texture of silly putty. It was moist but quite, quite rubbery and while the flavor was promising, I could not continue to eat it. It was just that rubbery, almost like a tire. Perhaps my Achilles heel in this equation is that the gluten free flour blend I used already contained tapioca starch, potato starch, and xanthan gum. Be that as it may, adding the extra one and a half teaspoons of xanthan gum really did me in. This excess of starchy ingredient most likely caused the rubbery texture. In the future, I would avoid adding this, especially if my flour blend has these other additives. Signing off, Cakeybakey65!

Won't the baking times differ for muffin/cupcakes and the 9x13 pan from the 30 minutes given for 9" cake pans? I'm baking this today or tomorrow. Had the real first recipe cakes in the 40's during war times. My Mom made it often. It's very good so I'm expecting this GF style to be the same.

This recipe is delicious!! It's moist and chocolatey. I've been making muffins and freezing them.  Just pop one in the microwave for about 30 seconds and you're in dessert heaven.  I only have one question.  I want to use this recipe to make cookies.  Any suggestions on how to do that?

I also used a 9x13" pan, and it rose and then deflated when it cooled. it baked for 40 minutes, and was still extremely gooey inside, although around the edges was overdone. The flavor is delicious, but really would have liked a more "cakey" cake. Could there be different baking temps and times when using the different pan? Or possibly different instructions for high altitude?

I was so disappointed! I cut this recipe in half because we only wanted 2 personal sized mini cakes so maybe that was the first problem. I was skeptical of the mayo and light color but pressed on. By the end of the mix it appeared exterely viscous and sticky. But once cooked they looked glorious and fluffy after cooling they deflated like old balloons and the middle were mush even though the toothpick method seemed to come out clean. The parts that were cooked were decent but didnt taste very much like chocolate. Maybe this would have worked better in a bundt pan or in a larger batch but sadly I couldn't make this work.

Perfect and delicious chocolate cake.  I am not a baker but I followed the recipe to the "t" and it came out wonderfully.  Denser than a regular cake just like I like it.  Definitely a keeper.  I used gluten free flour with xanthan gum already added.
