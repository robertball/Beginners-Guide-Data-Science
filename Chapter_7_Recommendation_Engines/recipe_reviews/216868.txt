This was very good. Quick and easy for a week night dinner. I only made 1/2 the recipe and added about 1/2 tbsp of lemon juice to freshen it up a bit. I thought it could use a little kick though, maybe some siracha or hot chili sauce. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe, Denise!

I really loved the flavor and tenderness of the pork chops. I followed the recipe just how it is written and really enjoyed it.

I made this with wild rice and asparagas and it was TASTY. I really enjoyed the consistancy of the sauce and ended up pouring it on my asparagas too. I did use fish sause instead of oyster sauce (although I dont really think it makes any difference) and added a touch of sriracha too. will definately make it again.

made exactly as recipe states.  Thought recipe was ok, but don't think I would make again. I like all the individual ingredients but not sure I like them all combined.

I made this meal tonight and it was AWESOME.  I was nervous to make it seeing as how I've never cooked pork chops before, but it was extremely simple and pretty quick.  My husband said "This is good" quite a few times.  I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband found this on the allrecipes spinner.  What a find!  So simple, so flavorful!  The sauce could easily be used on beef, chicken, or pork.  I see it in my barbecue future.

We enjoyed the flavor of these porkchops, but they were a bit dried out. I baked at 400 for 30 minutes, basting twice. Next time I'll cook at a lower temp. Thanks!

It was salty IMO.  I don't see a way around that using oyster sauce.

I thought this was a nice change although my chops got a bit dry. (375 for 30 min) I browned my chops with s & p before going in the oven and perhaps this is why the sauce did not penetrate the meat. The hoisin added a nice smokey flavor while the ginger gave it a nice bite.

I made per the recipe, except for the end-broiling of the meat. The sauce was very intense and a bit too salty. To broil the meat and make the sauce as per the recipe would, I think, made that intensity too much for my palate. Over all good. What would I change? Possible less hoisin sauce and increase the honey; or add a couple of Tbsp  of jelly/preserves. Definitely make it again.

Against my better judgement,  I made this recipe as written.  The chops came out dry and tough.  400°F is too hot and 30-40 minutes is too long too cook chops.  I always bake mine at 325-350° F.  I like my pork with an internal temp of 145-150° F
       Also, because I was serving it over rice, I doubled the sauce..

I used the recipe on a roast because I was too lazy to slice it up into chops before cooking and it was delicious. It just takes longer to cook, but using the same temperature reference it turned out moist. I cut back on the oyster sauce by half a tablespoon because I didn't want it to be too salty. I also didn't transfer the sauce into a saucepan before adding the cornstarch paste. I mixed it in the Pyrex in which I cooked the meat and then spooned it over the chops I cut after the roast was cooked. Worked out fine. I will make this again. Thanks for the recipe.
