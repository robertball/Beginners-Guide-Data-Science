These cookies take a while since the dough has to be refrigerated twice, but they look and taste great! The colors look great on a cookie plate, especially when dusted with colored sugar of a contrasting color. I had an easier time slicing them and keeping their shape if they were frozen, then slightly thawed after rolling.

Not only were these cookies delicious, and gorgeous to look at, but they were simple and fun to make. I followed this exact recipe, but took the advice and cut them with dental floss. Warning: Do NOT allow the cookies to cool after removing from the oven. Remove them from the pan immediately, because, despite greasing the pan, the jell-o sticks to the pan as it starts to cool.

This a fun cookie and tastes good. I added 1/2 tsp of almond flavoring and 1/2 tsp of vanilla. I also used Light Jello. To cut down on chilling time you roll out your dough in between 2 sheets of parchment paper and chill for about 20 minutes in the fridge. Then after you put on the jello, roll it up and put in the freezer for another 15-20 minutes.

Fantastic! I was in a hurry, so I just mixed everything together (including the jell-o mix), rolled them into balls, and popped them into the oven.  They turned out fantastic!  Soft and just the right texture.  These are definately a keeper!

**Added later:  These cookies did not stay soft long.  I loved them at first; but, a day later (they were in a closed tupperware), they were dry and much less tasty.  I reccomend cooking them right before eating, and freeze leftovers.**

I added 1 tsp vanilla and an additional 1/3 cup sugar for taste.

I turned these into Margarita Cookies and made these for a get-together with some friends.  I added a few Tablespoons of tequila and a bit more flour and instead using a 6oz box of jello, I used a 3oz box of each lemon and lime jello mixed together. Then I brushed the dough with more tequila instead of water before sprinkling the gelatin. Before I baked them I gave them a light sprinkle of kosher salt. I had a hard time getting some of them off the pan, so next time I will line the pan with waxed or parchment paper. Other than that, they were wonderful.  I got great reviews!

Very good, we enjoyed making them!  I did as recommended and added some flavorings, vanilla and lemon extracts, then let them chill overnight.  I rolled them (to about 1/4") between two sheets of plastic wrap, and froze them before slicing and baking.  Darling cookies!

These looked and tasted great. I didn't refrigerate them again after rolling - I just used dental floss to cut them, and they were fine. I use parchment paper on the cookie sheets; the cookies never stick, and there's nothing to clean up. (I don't know how one reviewer got a gooey mess - she didn't actually make the gelatin first, did she?)

I have this recipe at home and make them every Christmas with red and green jello. They do take time to make but they are well worth it. They are always a big hit at Christmas parties.
Never had a problem with jello running/sticking.

I've been baking for 40 years, and this was the worst disaster in memory.  Despite lengthy chilling and great care in following the recipe, the gelatin oozed onto the cookie sheets, creating a gluey, unmoveable mess.  Two tins are soaking now, we have nothing but crumbs, and the rest of the dough is being thrown out.  Very disappointing and frustrating.  The one cookie that I managed to salvage is very pretty, however.

These cookies were a lot of work.  Something I try to avoid.  There wasn't a lot a flavor which I thought was odd because of the Jello.  But, they are absolutely adorable when finished and look very impressive.

They were pretty. Some people didn’t like the jello taste. Also, the person who added sugar and also mixed the jello mix (which is mostly sugar) into the dough got hard cookies, because sugar gets hard when it’s cool.The fat/flour/sugar ratios determine the “bite” of the cookie

I made some with raspberry and some with lemon jello and they tasted fine but the flavors didn't 'pop' like I thought they would.

the dough turned out great! tastes awesome. We don't eat jello so I used a cinnamon bun filling. Thank you for the idea!

Fun recipe! I threw mine in the freezer second round and were sliceable in 2 hrs. A little dry with jello and without jelly... But pretty and tasty

Very pretty cookies!  The dough is incredibly soft, even after refrigerating, but with a sharp knife and reshaping the cookies slightly, they are absolutely gorgeous once baked.  I like the flavor from the jello--I used sugar free (what I had in the colors hubs thought I should use), so I am not sure if with sugar jello it wouldve had more flavor or not.  Still, very pretty and lovely in the different shades of red and green hubs wanted since these are for Christmas cookie tins.  They don't make a lot of cookies, but are easy and I may make more--I have plenty of jello, and they are fun.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very disappointed in these.  The dough tasted great before baking.  They do look beautiful, but once baked they taste more like a poptart without the sweetness.  Will definitely never make again.
