Everyone enjoyed this dish. If I make it again I’d reduce the sugar and add more carrots and possibly mushrooms at the end. I didn’t peel the radishes and served the dish with rice. My instant pot took about 15 minutes to heat  so it definitely took longer than 35 minutes to cook. My husband used the leftovers to make a vegetable soup adding more carrots plus broccoli mushrooms and left over rice. Delicious.

I made this just as the recipe was laid out. We loved it! The sauce was very aromatic and tasty. The instant pot made the cooking fast. The veggie prep was a little time consuming, but thats because were so used to getting a bag of frozen and throwing them in the pot. The flavor made the radish peeling all worth it. Served with mashed potatoes and a nice green salad. My wife still works so I do a bit of the cooking, happy wife, happy life with this dish.

We really loved the flavors of the meat and gravy.  I would maybe add a few minutes of cooking time, since some of the meat was more tender than others.  Also, I would add more carrots and radishes to the mixture.  They shrink up in the Instant Pot and it could have used more.  We'll definitely be making it again!
