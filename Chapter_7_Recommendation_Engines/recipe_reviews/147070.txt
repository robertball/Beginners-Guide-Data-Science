I thought it was a little bland. It's a good base but it needs something else. My husband added soy sauce to his and that seemed to help. I think maybe add some soy sauce in place of part of the wine and a little lemon juice to finish it and maybe some red pepper flakes in with onions for heat.

This was very tasty. I did not have fresh ginger so I used ground ginger (only ½ teaspoon). Wish I had the fresh ginger. When I make it again, which I well, fresh ginger is on the list. I served it with Spinach and Red Pepper Couscous which you can find on this site, lovely combination.  PS don’t forget the wine:)

I couldn't believe it, but the wine with ginger was very tasty.  My folks liked it too. I added some more veggis, such as fresh bean sprouts and served it with basmati rice cooked in coconut milk.

This was a good dish, but lacked a little zip even though I used the fresh ginger.  I dislike cilantro so I omitted it entirely and added sliced water chestnuts.  If I were to make it again, I would add pepper flakes just to give the flavor a little boost.

So boring. Would not make again. The only reason I am even giving it two stars is that I doctored it w/red pepper flakes, Asian chili sauce, fish sauce and Cajun seasoning to give it any kind of flavor. Before that all it tasted like was plain warm shrimp.

I have made several times.  Add a little more wine and a small about if chicken /vegetable broth for more juice to serve over pasta .  Fantastic !!

Very tasty and flavorful!  The only request in my house was for more of the sauce.  I may try to tweak the next time I make this to honor the request, but it was very quick and easy.  A great weeknight dinner!

My whole family really liked this! I made white rice with coconut milk and it was devoured.  Good stuff.
