I prepared this salad according to recipe with the optional coconut. I did not layer the salad, I just mixed everything together in one big bowl, leaving the juice from the oranges for last to drizzle over the top and mix one last time. For us, we really did not care for the juice from the mandarin oranges in this salad. That's not a reflection of the recipe, it's personal taste. I will make this salad again but I will drain my mandarin oranges first.

Good as is but the next time I subbed pineapple and mango for the cantaloupe (my stores were out) and I drained the mandarin oranges and used some of the juice from the pineapple instead. This made it DIVINE!

Couldn't find melons or coconut flakes so I just squeezed some mandarin juice over the salad, and it was delicious! Tweaked it with just 3 ingredients, and it was still good!
