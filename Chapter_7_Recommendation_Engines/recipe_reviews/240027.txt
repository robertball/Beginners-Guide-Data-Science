Made as written and this was good. My only recommendation is to add a bit more Worcestershire. That is all.

We made this tonight for NYE dinner. Our family of 4 all liked it! I read the other reviews and used more beer to help thin it (it was still thick even after that) and less dry mustard (I used 1/2 tsp).  Beware though, have everything ready to go premeasured, the beer bubbled over while I was measuring the dry mustard and made a mess...

This was good - especially with soft pretzels for dipping, but my family likes the traditional gruyere fondue a little better

Made exactly as instructed and it turned out really nicely.   The worcestshire cuts the bitter beer taste.  Served with brats, broccoli, apples, and bread.

It was ok. Followed the recipe exact.  Way too much mustard though. I would make it again but maybe only use half a tsp of mustard.

This was sooooo delicious! Like the other reviewer, I had to add more beer as it was too thick. I did not have dry mustard, so used some stone ground mustard instead. Next time I will double it because it was gone quick!

We had this last night, it was delicious.  We did have to add more beer because this was very very thick.
