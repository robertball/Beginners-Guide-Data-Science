I don't have a grill but tried this recipe anyway. Turned out great! We used an iron skillet. Very impressive tasting recipe.

I'm going to rate the base of this recipe as I never follow one to the letter. I did add 2 ingredients that made this completely over the top. I added 1 teaspoon of lime juice and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil and it made it fantastic. I think this is a great recipe for a BBQ beginner. Thanks for submitting it, we all enjoyed it here and my husband said I can definately make this one again.

This was a great recipe! I do not have a grill, but we tryed this on the stovetop and it turned out amazing. I cook the chops on high to brown the outside and then turned down to simmer. This is when I added the glaze and let it cook for about 30mins. I turned it about 3 times total. I added seasme seeds for an added kick! I think this would also be great if you baked it!

Delicious and simple. I picked it because my husband loved sweet recipes. I was afraid it would be too sweet for me, but we both loved it. My only thing is that you could 1/2 the recipe and still have enough. Ended up throwing a bunch of honey and soy sauce away...

AMAZING!!!! Even with the pinch of red pepper flakes. But I will say I had a ton of basting sauce left over, if you have thin boneless pork chops or pork loin steaks, this recipe could easily do 8-12 chops. I grilled my thick slices of onions up and basting those as I cooked....OhMyJebbers!!! FANSTATIC!!!! This will be a repeater recipe for sure. I am going to try agave next time in place of the honey and see if I get the same results!! TY TY TY!!

This was an AWESOME recipe! The only differences I did was instead of red pepper flakes I used Chili flakes and instead of the grill I baked them in the oven.... I basted them before I put them in the oven (375 for 45 mins) , 15 minutes before they were to come out and then again when I was ready to serve them. They turned out very juicy and fell apart! Even my picky eater of a brother liked them! I think next time I'll try it on chicken.

Awesome!!!! My whole family loved the flavor! I didn't have onions so I used onion salt. I sprinkled with onion salt & pepper. Then browned in canola oil on the stove. Mixed the first 3 ingredients & poured over top of chops in a pan. Then cover & put in the oven at 350 for 20-25 minutes. SO GOOD!!! Next time I might marinade the chops & maybe even some veggies in this sauce.

Great taste. I cooked on cast iron pan on high heat. then turned down to low heat after adding the sauce. It turned out tasty but tough and dry. This recipe is good for THICK pork chops. If yours is thin or regular slice, you might want to cut the grill time down.

I love this recipe. I used brown sugar instead of honey because I wasn't in the mood to go to the store for honey. I also made the mixture and just let the chops marinate in it for about 45 mins. I cooked them on my electric griddle and they came out perfect!

Just had this tonight.  Loved it. Followed recipe with no substitutions.    Easy, fun... had the recommended garlic mashed potatoes (which I make a lot) and added steamed green beans.  My husband helped with the grilling.  He had a great time.  Onions a perfect garnish.  Almost looked like restaurant dinner.  Yummy!

These are very good!!  Be sure to keep brushing those chops so they soak up that yummy sauce!  I also had my husband brush the onions with it too.  Really enjoyed these!!

Really loved the sauce! I added more red pepper flakes to make it a sweet and hot sauce. I'll definitely use it again.

Awesome! I made this a few days ago for my family, and everyone loved it! We don't have a grill, and it also being winter, we used a cookie sheet almost, but bigger (sorry, I don't know what it's called), and put that on two of the stove burners, one of them being hotter than the other, and cooked them that way. Thank you so much for the recipe! Next time I'll include a picture, they looked and tasted delicious! :D!

Excellent flavor and a very quick dish to prepare!  I already had pork chops thawed out but no plan on how to cook them.  I got busy doing other weekend chores and sidetracked.  Found this recipe tucked in my recipe box that I had never made.  It really did take 30 minutes - a blessing.  I made minor adjustments as needed.  I cooked in a pan because we have a charcoal grill so that takes awhile to heat up.  I also used a regular onion rather than sweet (all I had).  It was still delicious.  I overcooked my pork chops in the pan but that was my fault.  My kids and husband ate every bite and wanted more.  Will definitely make again and will make more than stated. P.S. At the start of this dinner, my husband said he didn't feel like having pork chops.  By the end, he ate any scrap left.

I made it on the stove top and it turned out great. I would recommend more than 1 onion, they were delicious- probably my favorite part of the meal. My picky eaters (kids) actually enjoyed it, too.

This came out great, I am still a beginner at bbqing and it was easy. I also added a little lime and seame oil, I was also short the half cup of honey which I filled in with dark Karo syrup...still was super good. I will definantly be making this again, but with the full 1/2 cup of honey ;)

Tonight I tried making this recipe, but it totally flopped. I didn't have a grill and read in the comments that someone else was successful at preparing this on a stove. I followed their recommendations (brown the meat, then simmer in glaze for 30 minutes) and the glaze recipe exactly. Well, my pork turned in to a charred mess that tasted something like severely burnt marshmallows. Before it was destroyed, the glaze looked (and smelled) delicious! If I try this recipe again, it will certainly be on a grill. I'd just like to caution other users considering the stove-top method. Maybe it would work better with thicker cuts of meat than I used (~1/2 inch) or if cooked for less time.

What a wonderful meal.  The basting sauce is amazing.  Definitely put the onions on the grill.  Baste them.  Served salad (emphasis on cucumber)and roasted potatoes.  Will make this again and again.

high in sodium but it's very good.i  would recommend it. I cut down on the soy and honey a bit when I made it, but still a very good flavorful meal.

We liked the combination of honey and low sodium soy and have made this a couple of times.  I am looking forward to using this glaze with chicken too! I did have to add a splash or two more of soy sauce but would highly recommend this recipe. First time we cooked in oven and it was good but second time on grill was definitely better as the sauce was able to carmelize and really soak in.

This is another great recipe of using soy sauce, some sweetener and some spice.  This combination of any three ingredients is a winner in my book.  The family loved it as well.  Definitely I would make this again.

The only thing I did differently was to cook in a large skillet.  This was so easy and so tasty!  My family loved it, so I will definitely make it again.  Thanks for sharing it here!

Loved it. It gave a nice twist to the plain of fashion pork chop.

This is good. I've made it a few times. It's easy enough because we typically have ingredients on hand. I enjoy the recipe as is. My suggestions: make sure your chops are proper thickness and use propane grill if you can. Despite oiling the grates, it's still very sticky. The glaze is very yummy and would work well on chicken or homemade jerky too ??

I made it exactly as the recipe called for but it tasted like something was missing. If I make it again I will definitely add some garlic, chopped green onions, and more pepper.

Not much taste from basting on grill.  Really needed that extra sauce after cooking to get flavor.  Perhaps most others enjoyed the taste because it seems most of those who gave 4-5 stars cooked it in a pan or in oven where parks chops were sitting in the sauce from the start of the cooking process.

Made this recipe as written and overall, it just tasted like pork with a very subtle hint of sweet every now and then..for about 1/2 a second. Flavors weren't balanced to where you get a taste of the honey, soy, red or black pepper. I will try this recipe again, but will marinade the pork first for at least 2 hours, then grill. I used 1 inch thick boneless pork chops and served with steamed white rice and broccoli. Definitely an easy recipe to make, but just didn't take pork to the next 'level' for us.

It was good, but not exceptional. I made it because I needed something that didn't require marinating for several hours. The next time I will try another cooks suggestion of adding some lime juice and sesame oil.

This has become a staple at our house - cooked in a little canola oil in a frying pan.  We skip the red pepper so the kids will eat it.  A family fave!

Used the ingredients to spec but pan fried instead of grilled. Started with the oil S&P and seared on high heat. Reduced heat and added about half of the mixture. I covered the pan with a lid and continued to baste and turn as they cooked. Once cooked through, I removed the pork chops and added the rest of the mixture to the pan adding about a tablespoon of butter and a bit of flour. Brought it to a boil until it was thick, reduced heat and drizzled the 'gravy' over the chops. My husband LOVED and raved about the dinner all night!

I don't care for big slices of  onion, so I added some onion flakes to the glaze, and it worked out well for us. Nice blend of flavors, without being either too sweet or too salty.

Awesome!! I was lazy and didn't feel like using the grill for this recipe tonight (it didn't help that it was still 105 degrees at 7pm!!).
Instead, I pan-seared it in some coconut oil and did everything else pretty much the same as the recipe. Very tender and great flavor!

Very good! My husband liked it a lot. I used an indoor griddle type of grill, so it didn't get the smokey flavor...but I'm sure it would be absolutely delicious on the bbq. It was easy to make. A little difficult to clean the grill afterwards, but that's natural. I'll be making this more often.

Did enjoy this recipe.  Used leftover basting sauce on grilled sweet potatoes.  Use a grilling wok sprayed with Pam.  Sliced the sweet potatoes, brush with the sauce and place in the wok. Grill over medium heat until tender, stirring occasionally.

I tried this as a quick fix with what I had on hand. I used New Mexican red chile instead of the crushed red pepper, and put a small clove of garlic in the mix. It was so good I ate my leftovers the next morning ! Ha !

This sauce was great!  I only made 1/2 the basting sauce and had plenty for 7 boneless chops, 1/2 in thick.  We did not have onion with it.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

I enjoyed this recipe, however not a big hit with the kids. It was fast and easy, however I did not grill them as I did not have any charcoal for the grill. I fried them in a frying pan and glazed them right there, they were juicy.
