I love this recipe- I like to put the pizza in without the cheese for 10 minutes or so, remove  them, and add the cheese before cooking the rest of the way. This rids you of the temptation to remove them as soon as the cheese is melted (at which point the crust is still not quite done.) We have done this with pepperoni and mushrooms and also with canadian bacon- all have been delicious.

This is definitely one I keep under my belt for those nights where I need something quick to make.  I am not a huge fan of pizza but I like this dish as it's more like a savoury-italian-meat-pie because of the filling (as opposed to a thin layer of "toppings").  My picky eater husband loves this and my toddler too!

It was good, as a chicago-native I wouldn't really classify this as deep dish, though. Still, the directions were really easy to follow and it turned out as sort of a pizza/lasagna looking dish. Not at all what I wanted or expected, but good nonetheless.
