I was looking for a BBQ Sauce recipe to try with ribs that I could make from ingredients I had on hand. This one looked the best of those I found, but I didn't have 6 tomatoes. I used 3 and added a small can of tomato sauce. I also added half a tablespoon of liquid smoke. Haven't even had the ribs yet but everyone in the family has tasted the sauce and they love it!

Very good - couldn't be bothered to puree it so left it chunky.  Superb result - the onion caramelised and singed around the edges adding to the bodacious yummy taste.  Thanks Steve!  Definitely make again and again.  Even considering making a load, letting it go cold and using it as a salsa.

Sweet, with a little heat in the back of the throat. Nice sauce! I did food processor it a bit before basting it on a sirloin steak, not having any ribs to try out on. I also didn't have any tomatoes, but I didn't miss them. NM chile powder is a dried mildly hot pepper, so I subbed some homemade hungarian hot I made last year, just a 1/4 tsp, was plenty of heat and smokiness. I really liked this and think it would be great on ribs! Thanks!

Excellent recipe!  Exactly what I've been looking for.  A nice "red" barbecue sauce, as opposed to brown/molasses type.  Thanks for the post!

This was very good. I added a couple of squeezes of lemon juice, and as I didn't have cayenne, I subbed in  a packet of pizza pepper flakes. Will definitely make again. Very forgiving recipe.
