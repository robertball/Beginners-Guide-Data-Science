These are delicious!  I have made them twice.  The second time, I made the filling the night before and refrigerated.  For some reason it was easier working with the filling, when it was chilled.  Also, I halved the recipe and still was able to fill 30 wontons.  I will be making for a wedding reception I am catering next month.  Thanks for the great recipe!!!!  Addendum: (2 weeks later) I placed the filling into the wonton skins and then refrigerated for two hours.  DO NOT do this.  Some of the wontons turned to mushy dough.  Always fry immediately after filling the wonton skins.  They were still a huge hit!

This is a great appitizer loved by many people!  This is my boyfriends FAVORITE!  He's always asking me when I'm going to make it for him again.  =0)  Instead of using imitation crab, I use canned crab meat.  It can get pricey though.  I also wrap mine differently.  I like being able to taste a lot of the crab & cream cheese when I bit into it... so what I do is take a wonton wrapper, put a spoonful of the mixture in the center, dab beated eggs on the edges, put another wonton wrapper on top & press all the edges together to seal.  I make sure there isn't any air bubbles in there either because it'll explode while frying if there is.  I fry them in a skillet & when I fry them, I make sure to keep flipping it that way they don't explode.  Anyways, hope that was helpful & not confusing!  =0P

DELICIOUS! I forgot the soy sauce and didn't have any water chestnuts, but that didn't matter. I baked the wontons, liberally spraying a baking dish with cooking spray then the top of the wontons. I baked them in a convection oven at 390 for 10 minutes.  I served them with Sweet and Sour Sauce II from this site. Everyone loved them including my 9 year old.

I have used this recipe many times and it is fantastic.  When I make them I freeze them in one layer before they are fried.  Once frozen I place them in a freezer bag.  When unexpected company comes I remove them from the freezer and fry them - no need to thaw before hand.  They always get great kudos!

Perfect!! I get these from a local (expensive) seafood restaurant so I thought I should try to make them myself. SO easy, too! I make a whole batch of filling, keep it in the fridge, and fill & fry the wontons as needed. Easy easy. I just put the filling in the middle, fold the wontons in half and seal with wet fingers. I also didnt use as much oil and just flipped them over while they cooked. Didnt like to start with 375 degree oil because it browned the skins so fast the filling didnt have time to warm up. I liked adding extra cream cheese, and chopping the crab meat as well so its a smoother filling.... also to kick up the flavor I added more soy sauce, minced garlic,  and Worcestershire sauce. I also added red pepper flakes & minced garlic to a small dish of soy sauce to dip in as the restaurant did. Delicious. These are a huge hit with everyone who tastes them! I ask my boyfriend what he wants for dinner and he says, "you know I want those wontons!" Reccomended that my mom make them because they're such a snap. Great recipe, thanks!

Terrific recipe!  Rather than crabmeat, I used chopped, pre-cooked shrimp with minced celery.  And I used way less than the oil called for.  I pan fried them one side at a time.  They came out great and I didn't waste any oil!

These were very YUMMY! Made them for an Asia themed Bunco party. One of the other girls brought Cream Cheese Wontons from a local Chinese resturant and most people prefered mine!!
I sort of halved the recipe on my own and used about a 1/4 of the waterchestnuts (not a big fan) but the crunch they gave really added something. I cheated when it came to shaping them because I have a wonton press. Don't own a deep frier or a thermometer to test the oil, but I fried them in 1/2 in of peanut oil in a high sided skillet over medium heat and it worked out fine. Very easy!!
I also baked some in a mini muffin pan with the edges of the wonton wrappers sticking up in the air- they were OK (2 people actually prefered them this way)- I think I prefer my grease!
I will definatly make these again! 
I may experiment with the recipe and try making a batch that has some kick to it. 
Thanks!!

These were delicious.  My favorite recipe for this from this site thus far.  I did add a little more crab meat...we like it with a little more substance.  I also added just a little bit of garlic powder.  I put a full spoonful in the center and used a second wonton wroapper to cover.  This way we could get more filling in each bite.  Thanks for the post...delicious.

Brought to a company potluck and a hundred of these (in a department of 30 people) were gone in two hours =) Before 9:30 am! I omitted soy sauce as I simply didn't have any. Was asked for the recipe by four other women there, bf also gobbled them up the night before, much easier than I thought (the frying seemed a little intimidating since I had never done it before) but Very simple, very delicious! (not to mention economical, I spent about $12 to make a hundred of these as opposed to $5 for 6 crab puffs at the chinese takeout restaurant!) Thanks!

absolutley yummy. we can eat dozens! they are really great fried in the oil(my favorite way)but also bake up quite well in mini-muffin pans. Just press the wonton wrapper into the wells in the pan and spoon in the filling and bake for 10 mins or so. great appetizer when done that way. i actually made them for thanksgiving last year, and they were a hit.

We used our blender to make the water chestnuts really fine. I hate water whole chestnuts, but they give this recipe such a delicious consistency that omitting them would be a mistake. I also used whipped cream cheese. Worked great. I would tone down the soy sauce a bit. Maybe use about half what it calls for, as it is a little strong. This recipe make a LOT so halving the recipe for smaller crowds or dinner parties may be a good idea. I also used whipped eggs whites to seal up the sides before dropping it into the grease. Worked great! Will use this recipe again and again.

Very good and easy.  But I'm still searching for the recipe that tastes like the restaurants--with a sweetness to it.

The flavor in these little dumpling were amazing...but almost all of them exploded in the oil. Too bad..they could have been a wonderful thing.

The best way to freeze these is to use a plastic container (suitable for the freezer).  Place the prepared wontons next to each other without touching.  When starting a new layer of wontons, place a sheet of wax paper down then begin your next layer to prevent wontons from sticking to each other.  Defrost for ~45 minutes before frying.

Made these for a party, and it was such a great hit! Even the kids loved them. I used 16 oz of imitation crab meat since that's how much it came in the package, and it was perfect. Refrigerated some left-overs since I made a lot. They were still delicious and cruchy the next day. I loved them cold too. Next time I will try to use real crab meat and bake them like some of the reviews suggested. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

Great recipe and very easy! I followed the recipe exactly, except for leaving out the water chestnuts since I don't really like them (they would have added to the texture though). I chopped up the crabmeat, making it easier to mix together. I also took someone else's advice and cooked one side at a time in a large pan so as not to waste oil. It fried up really quickly too, about a minute for each side. One tip is to be sure to squeeze the air out when sealing the wrapper so that they don't puff up when frying. Serve right away and with some sweet and sour chili sauce.

Used real crab and it was great. Got a ton of compliments. Next time I will use a little less cream cheese so i can better taste the crab. Left over cream cheese mix was good on bagels the next morning. Edit: I have now made this several times. I now double the crabmeat. Also..they are great after frozen. I make a batch..freeze them and just pull a few out and bake. Great served with sweet chili sauce!

I reduced the soy sauce to just a couple of drops and omitted the water chestnuts.  Since I didn't serve it with a sauce, I wished I had sprinkled a little salt on the wonton after frying.  I would definitely make again.

My husband is Hawaiian, and when we had an office Luau, everyone looked to me to bring an authentic recipe. My in-laws are in Utah, and weren't able to get me any ideas quickly. So I searched the site, saw this recipe, and thought it held all of the delicious qualities of Hawaii! WHAT A HIT! Everyone asked me for the recipe, and have made alterations to fit their own tastes! I still like the original way, and have made them for a house warming party, for a thank you gift, and for our own family's munchies... this one is a keeper!

I really liked these. I left out the water chestnuts simply because I cannot stand them. I did everything else as stated. I will say my teenager was a bit overwhelmed with the flavor of cream cheese though.

These were very delicious. Next time, I'll cut back on the cream cheese a little bit as I would prefer to taste more crab in the bite. Use egg wash (1 egg + 1 tbsp water) to seal the wonton; it really makes a huge difference time-wise.

Good, but a little too crabby for us.  Wound up doubling the cream cheese, and we liked them a lot better then.

I made these for a party recently. Normally we always have leftovers because everyone brings too much food, but this was one dish that was completely gone at the end of the night. I'm going to try baking some next time. Thanks for sharing!

This filling was awesome, but I liked it better before it was fried up in the wonton skins.  I wasn't ready for the "crunch" the water chestnuts added, if I make this again, I'll probably leave those out and just add more crab.  Also, the prep time must not include folding all those wontons, it took me nearly 2 hours from start to finish.

These were sooo delicious. After frying, be sure to lay the wontons on paper towels, so that the excess oil is absorbed. I will be making this again = )

This is very tasty, but I think adding more green onions and waterchestnuts would make it even better. Very creamy, lots of crab flavor...

This was a fabulous recipe! I was worried since it was quite a large batch, but i took them to a company potluck and gone instantly! The women begged for the recipe and the men begged for another batch soon!

A good appetizer.  On my second time making this recipe I used only one block of cream cheese.  The first time I made it the two blocks of cream cheese was overpowering and heavy.

These were really decent!  I didn't have the water chestnuts so I omitted them.  I also added paprika, parsley and a hint of cayenne.  Everyone loved them, the entire lot was gone.  Next time I will try real crab, as opposed to imitation crab for more of a seafood taste.

I made some of these with pineapple cream cheese, and both versions were super tasty! The pineapple adds a nice sweetness to it.

These were ok. I wonder if lump crab would have pleased me more, but will not use the imitation for this again. I tried this again later using finely chopped shrimp instead and it was received with much enthusiasm by my guests. I served them on a platter with a recipe of 'Sweet and Sour Sauce I' in the middle. Fun, easy, different.

I made these last week and they were good, I would have prefered a little more of the crab taste but it was still good. I freezed them before I fried them and made Hot and Sweet Dipping Sauce, it was a great match. Next time I make them I will probably add more crab.

My girlfriend and I absolutely LOVED these.   We cut the recipe in half and it made well over 30.  I did add an extra teaspoon of soy sauce and Lea And Perrins Worcestershire.  The only thing I would recommend is not using as much cream cheese, as it over powers the taste of the crab.  Thanks for sharing, this will definitely be on our appetizer list for future gatherings.

Very good! I changed the serving to 7 people, and did not use the green onions or the water chestnuts. I used a can of crab meat instead of the imitation (should be able to find it near the tuna fish in your grocery store) and added a few shakes of granulated garlic. Dipped them in sweet and sour sauce. Thanks!

Thanks Gina! I followed the recipe exactly except I cut in half since I was using as an appetizer for a party of eight. Wish I would have made the whole recipe.  These were gone in a flash and everyone said "these are a keeper". I always make my family members their favorite meal on their birthdays. My son always wants Chinese food. These were the highlight of the whole meal. I will make these often.

I was not crazy about this recipe. To me there was just to much crab and the soy sauce was over powering. My husband liked it though. He usesd as a spread on toast. So it was not a total loss.

EXCELLENT! Better than restaurant Won Tons.  I didn't use water chestnuts, and I used canned white crab instead of imitation.  I used the food processor on the onion and crab, because I like the filling to be smooth.  My husband and I both loved them!  I only made about a third of the original recipe.

I know I am in the minority on this one... but the soy sauce killed it for me. I think was just too overpowering and left a very bad taste. Everything else was perfect! But I hated the soy sauce in this recipe.

These are wonderful, one of my favorite appetizers to bring to a party. But please, please, please don't be cheap and use imitation crabmeat. Shell out for real crabmeat. It makes such a difference.

Halved the recipe for a small appetizer and  still wound up cutting down on the soy sauce.   Had problems with leakers until I doubled up on the wonton skins, then they were quite good.

These are pretty good, but I did not care for the water chestnuts in the mix. Next time will omit. I think also will make with real crab the next time. Easy to shape when you use mini muffin tins as a guide. Will make again with my mods to personal preference. Thanks for sharing!

My family loved these - even left over... although they did lose a little crunch, so I'll try the freezing next time.  I will also leave out the water chestnuts.  But really good!

This recipe is great! I followed the recipe exactly as written, and they came out so perfect and so delicious.  I make this dish a lot now for entertaining, and they all compliment the fact that most of the mix is of crab meat, and not just cream cheese.  Huge kudos to Gina!!! Thanks for sharing!!!!

These were so good!  I made mine vegetarian by leaving out the crab and adding more water chestnuts and green onion.  Unfortunately, I made a few "cooker errors"... I had tried baking half and frying half to see which way I liked them.  Fried is definitely best!  I didn't have enough oil so I tried to flip them over to get the top cooked and they came apart.  The esthetic qualities didn't affect the flavor, they were still very yummy!  I will surely make these again, the right way.
