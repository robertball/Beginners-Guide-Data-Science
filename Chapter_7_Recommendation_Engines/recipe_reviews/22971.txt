This is really popular at our family gatherings. We've made it using cranberry sauce instead of grape jelly with absolutely awsome results. Ann Marie is right.... don't tell your guests what's in the sauce or they won't try it. The best part is it only takes minutes to prepare and can be done very easily in the microwave.

The ingredients sound really gross together but they make the BEST appetizers. Guests will be begging for more and for the recipe.

My grandmother used to make this recipe and I was sorry that we had lost it when we lost her. I didn't realize how easy it was to make but was a big hit with the family this Christmas. Personally I don't eat cocktail franks or any meat for that matter but for those who do this is an easy and tasty recipe. I melted the jelly and mustard on the stove and then transferred everything to a crockpot. My husband ate the leftovers for several days (I used three pounds of wieners.)

This is very similiar to a family recipe we use. Instead of mustard we use Heinz Chili Sauce (comes in a glass jar like the cocktail sauce).

I like these better wrapped in crescent dough each triangle cut in half lengthwise baked until golden brown then dip them in the jelly and mustard mixture or duck sauce mixed with hot mustard.

My husband's family used to make this all the time and he turned me onto them. We use currant jelly instead of the grape jelly and kilebasa sausage instead of the cocktail wieners. Definitely don't tell people what's in it prior to them trying it - I was very skeptical before I tried it but it is good!

I love jelly and mustard sauces for cocktail franks or smokies. Mmmmm! I like the grape jelly a lot but my favorite is to use smokies with apple jelly and mustard (1 part apple jelly to 1/2 to 2/3 part regular prepared mustard; you can substitute a few tablespoons spicy mustard for more kick). Any way you make 'em they're a fun and yummy little guilty pleasure!:D

I thought it was good but a bit sweet. I think I would have liked it better with chili sauce instead of mustard.

I made these for a get together we had last night - and I was a little unsure - but everyone raved about them and the bowl was completely empty.

This is a common pot-luck dish we'll throw together. It's always popular and very easy.

I've been making this for years! It was an old recipie handed down from my grandma. Its perfect for taking to parties potlucks and cookouts and there are never any leftovers! I recently took it to a friend's party....there was a ton of food there but at the end of the night the only dish completely empty was mine! Just make sure you simmer it and don't boil it. One time I got distracted and didn't keep a good eye on it the sauce looked like antifreeze on the plate lol but it still tasted fantastic!

I had always heard rave reviews about similar recipes so I tried it and it was nice but not something I'd crave at a party or for snacking on at home.

Love this recipe my husbands father makes this and it's always a hit however a little tweaking to really make it perfect I add apx 1/2 cup REAL maple syrup I'm from VT so it has to be the good stuff for us and 3-4 tablespoons of brown sugar also I make a bigger batch apx 20 oz grape jelly and same mustard I also use regular hot dogs about four packages and cut them into coins they soak up the flavor better this way I'm actually making this tonight for dinner:) oh and all three of make kids ages 5 7 and 10 love these hotdogs!!!!!

I have to say I just couldn't get past the mustard no matter how much extra jelly I added. Maybe if I weren't the one to make it I wouldn't have thought about the mustard.

I made this the way it is written for a movie snack for my husband. Plans changed and I needed a fast supper instead. Since this was already in the crockpot keeping warm I thickened it up some with a little corn starch and served it over rice with peas on the side. It worked out very well for supper that night with enough left overs for my husbands lunch the next day.

This is an excellent recipe. I changed it just a bit though. I decreased the mustard to 1/3 cup and the jelly to 1 cup using 1pkg of thawed hotdogs. With those changes it was fantastic. Loved it.

This was just awful.  Everyone was disappointed and for the first time in my life there was a large quantity of uneaten cocktail weenies.  It was merely edible, cause after all so much expense had gone into the purchase that we didn't want to just throw them out so everyone ate 2 to be polite.  The whole experience makes me very wary indeed of using half baked web recipes.  I will go back to the library and get tried and true recipes from published books and magazines.

These little gems are Delicious! They deserve 12 stars but I tweaked them a bit. I didn't have grape jelly so I subbed orange marmalade. I stirred in mustard powder along with Chili sauce. Hard to have a party w/o saucy smoke links! Thank you Ann Marie!

This is a recipe my family has been using forever - absolutely a great recipe. Anyone who has never tasted it might be skeptical because of the ingredients (I WAS TOO) but I assure you they are absolutely delicious and I don't EVER eat hot dogs

My Aunt Janet made this at Christmas and New Year s. Great memories! It is always popular and no one has ever thought I was serious when sharing the recipe.
