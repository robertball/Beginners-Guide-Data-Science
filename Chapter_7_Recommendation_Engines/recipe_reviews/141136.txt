We actually got a similar recipe to this with the same name from German friends who claim it is a German tradition. Their recipe is a little different and they separate the egg yolk and white, and mix the yolk in with the sugar, then milk, then flour and beat the egg whites until they are stiff and fold them in to the batter along with the raisins. This makes the pancakes very light and fluffy.
They serve the "German Pancakes" with icing sugar and lemon juice. Delicious!

My mom makes this on occassion and we just eat it up!  She is from Austria and her recipe is very similar, but we eat it with applesauce.  It's sooo good!  It just melts in your mouth.

i love kaiserschmarrn, it's one of my fav's for breakfast. although i boil my raisins for a couple of seconds in the rum and then strain. this recipe is the way i make mine as well. i do put powdered sugar over mine and eat it with apple sauce. 
ps i am german and yes, we like to think this is one of OUR dishes but it's not, it really does come from austria :-)

Yummy! My husband and I ate this in Munich this summer, and I've been wanting to recreate it ever since. I'm not a fan of raisins and didn't have any on hand, so I left them out (just put in a teaspoon of rum), and it was still delicious!

I haven't had Kaiserscharrn in over a decade!  We would always have it for dinner on Friday nights during lent with canned peaches on the side.  Thanks so much for posting the recipe.  This recipe was super easy and exactly how I remembered it!  Took me right back to my childhood.  I used my mom's old cast iron pan for a super golden crust.  Sehr Gut!!!

I tried this recipe for Kaiserscharrn and it was not that good.  I used it because it was quicker to mix up but without beating the egg whites it is missing the right texture for Kaiserscharrn.   The finished product should like random sized nuggets of pancake and not ribbons like this one makes

Hi there. Austriaphiles.Just got back from Carinthia, and felt moved to give this recipe a try.
Despite being a newbie at this cooking game, I even made my own peach (actually 'paraguyos') compote.
The preparation is time consuming, so organise yourself well in advance.
Flipping the pancake is not as easy as you think. Had to cut it into quarters and then flip them individually.
Might also have put the gas on a bit high, so next time a minute less on 'side one'.
For a first attempt, it tasted good, but looked a bit too 'bronzed' in places. If the restaurant in Klagenfut had dished up the same thing, I would have sent it back.....However.... overall pleased with myself. Regards from sunny Spain.

I tried this in Munich for the first time a few years back while I was there on business. This recipe is superb ! I prefer it with nothing but powdered sugar, but I am not a big berry guy.

Anyway, try it,,, its delicious and quite easy to make.
 it,,, its deliciuos and quite easy to make.

I once worked at an Austrian restaurant that had 2 chefs.  One chef made astoundingly delicious kaiserschmarrn.   The other chef made a greasier, distinctly less tasty version.  This recipe, sadly, is like that of chef number two.  :(

It is a very good recipe, easy to make, not too sweet, and I would have probably loved it on a cold winter night.  But in the heat of summer it is very good, but not homemade ice cream.  I paired with lingonberries I found online for a good price.
