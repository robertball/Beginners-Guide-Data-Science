I had no problems making this recipe and it turned out great with lots of flavor.  I changed the recipe around a bit though.  I began by peeling the sweet potatoes and cutting them into cubes before I boiled it..  Then I added extra brown sugar and cinnamon since people said it was a little blah.  As a garnish I made some toasted coconut for the top! :)

I agree with the previous poster. I followed the recipe to the letter only to end up with a mess.

I made this for an Hawaiian potluck at the campground we were staying at.  It turned out great, looked great and it was a super huge success.  I had quite a few requests for the recipe.  I will definitely make again and again.

I made this last Thanksgiving and it does have potential.  I will try it again, but omit the bananas and add some ginger to taste.  It is not too sweet, but it's really good for those who like natural fresh foods.

I made this for a Hawaiian luau themed party. I boiled the potatoes 30 minutes, and I sprinkled about 1/2 cup of chopped macadamia nuts on top during the last 15 minutes of baking. It came out very good, but I think the bananas overpowered the sweet potatoes a little. If I make this again, I would cut back on the number of bananas. Other than that, it's a very good recipe.

I made this for a luau-inspired party.  I personally don't care for the cooked bananas, but my guests all loved it.  I added more cinnamon than the recipe called for, about a full tablespoon, and a bit less brown sugar.  I'm unsure how other reviewers ended up with a "mess" because this dish presents beautifully.

This is a terrificly different recipe for sweet potatoes.  On a hot humid summer day in the Midwest,  it was downright refreshing!  The bananas are just the right ingredient to differentiate it from the boring Thanksgiving yam recipes.  I halved it for myself and my husband, and it was still enough for leftovers.  Yummy!

I thought this was delicious! I used a can of sweet potatoes that I had on hand and pineapple tidbits. I used less sweet potatoes than called for, so I just eyeballed everything else according to taste. Great flavor...I would make this again, for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

2 large potatoes take longer than 20 minutes to cook, at least 30 minutes. I thought they would soften up in oven, but didn't.

I changed it up to make due with what was in my cupboards,  and it came out great! I had to do canned sweet potatoes, drained and rinsed. I followed the tips and used less banana, and think it was a good outcome. I had fresh pineapple, so it wasn't quite crushed, but the bites were delish. I added toasted coconut and liked it. The only bummer was probably the canned taters, they made it a little too sweet. I'd like to try another reviewers idea for adding ginger next time - sans coconut.
