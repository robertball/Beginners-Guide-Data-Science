This recipe is amazing! Makes for a very hearty meal. After reading some of the other posts I added some garlic powder, paprika and cayenne pepper and used beef cosomme intead of cubes. I also added a can of crushed tomatoes, celery, zucchini and a small handful of rice. Once everything was mixed together and boiling I trasferred it to the oven to stop the rice sticking to the bottom of the pot. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Use low sodium beef broth instead of the boullion cubes....Also, throw in any leftover vegies you might have too.  Also, we use 1/2 Cup tomato juice (low sodium_and 1/2 Cup water

WOW! Not sure why everyone wants to make changes.  The whole family really enjoyed this recipe.  It sounds too 'unspiced' but for what ever reason it came out perfect! I used Hernadez Medium Salsa & Italian Bread Crumbs then salt & peppered each bowl to taste.  This stays way up on the list!

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I made a few changes:  used leeks rather than onion, added cajun spice (paprika, cayenne, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, etc), salt and plenty of pepper.  I also threw in some zucchini and lentils.  Delicious!  I made a large pot so my husband took some to work to share with co-workers as did I.  I haven't heard what feedback he received yet, but everyone LOVED this soup.  I would definitely recommend it.  Lovely Mexican soup, though I know the spices I added weren't traditional.

This is a OK meatball soup. But as I am mexican and being raised on mexican food, thats all I can really say about this soup. It was bland and was missing a whole lot of veggies. I use corn fresh off the cob, squash, fresh green beans, and way more seasonings. Also the key ingredient in Albondigas is rice in the meatballs with 1-2 eggs mixed in. You need tomatoes boiled and crushed in the broth. Oh and Garlic. I tried this just out of curiosity and was amused at best. Sorry.

This was reeeaaallly good. I followed the recipe but used low sodium beef broth instead of bouillon. I don't understand why so many reviewers want to tweak the meatballs. They are delicious as written. They read like they will be bland, but do not turn out that way at all. Cooking the meatballs in the broth adds so much to the flavor of this soup. Be sure to toss in mucho cilantro when you ladle this up. Wow. So simple and so good!!

For people on restricted salt diets, use low sodium beef broth instead.  The flavor will be great.  Use lean meat to reduce the fat content.

I'm not a fan of soups, but I decided to make this when it was cold & raining. I followed the recipe as written, and it came out wonderful. I really enjoyed the flavor of it. I'm definitely going to make this again. It's a keeper. I'd recommend others to try it :) UPDATE APRIL 2011: I added 1 TSP of Garlic Powder, Paprika, & Cayenne Pepper. I also added celery; it adds such a nice flavor. I don't add the salsa in the pot anymore. It tastes good w/o it, but I place the salsa on the table so we can add as much salsa as each person would like to their own bowl. BTW, the fresh cilantro as garnish is GREAT! Try it out at least once.

Delicious! I didn't have onions or bouillon so I added an envelope of Lipton Onion Soup mix instead of the onion and bouillon. I also added 3/4 c. of tomato juice and about 1/2 of homemade salsa I had left over in my fridge. This was so yummy. The cilantro is what makes it, so make sure you add it fresh at the end. Yum! This is the 1st 5 Star rating I've ever given something on all recipes. It exceeded my expectations!

In my Mexican-American family recipe, my mother adds just a little bit of long grain white rice in the meatball mixture.  Just sprinkle and mix til you think it look's like a good ratio, and drop into the simmering soup.  Yumm.

this was sooo darn excellent. I am just in love! My family totally enjoyed it. And I could make it again. I did follow it to a T but with one minor tad issue. I used this recipe to use up some turkey meatballs I had. But other wise, I'd make again with the beef. But for anyone that has frozen meatballs just sitting in the freezer waiting to be used...this is the recipe I'd go to in a heartbeat. The spice of the salsa was very nice and warming to the body. We didn't find it at all overpowering, but on a freezing cold day out side. The perfect warm you to the bones type of recipe. I had to make a double batch for my family. And I can say, this will be a winter staple in my house. Thanks very much for this awesome delightful soup.

This was the first time I've had albondigas. It is now one of my favorites. I added corn, tsp of garlic powder, 1/4 of cayenne pepper, and 1/4 of paprika. So good. I'm going to add other vegies next time as well.

This turned out great! Made some changes though, added 1/2 pound ground pork to meat mixture along with a large pinch garlic salt, large pinch ground coriander and onion powder, also added about 1/2 c finely chopped cilantro to the meat before making into balls.  To the broth I added 2 stalks of celery, a small pinch of oregano, and a small pinch of cumin and some zucchini about 20 minutes after the broth had been simmering.  Also towards the last 20 minutes of cooking I added about another 1/2 cup of finely chopped cilantro to the broth, and about a 1/2 cup of rice.  Delicious and flavorful!

We loved this recipe, thank you.   I made one change - I didn't use meatballs as we don't care for them very much, so I bought Hot Italian Sausage and made them into balls, it was very good.

Hubby said a 5 star, but I'm not sure. My problem is getting passed the meatballs in a soup. This is a hearty soup that doesn't hit bottom right away, so watch how much you eat. We like cilantro, but not sure it really needs it so remember it says optional. My husband did add frozen corn when making & we both liked that addition, along with some garlic.

This recipe appealed to me on this dark and dreary day and since I had all the ingredients, I decided to try it.  I used a 4qt pot, so adjusted the other ingredients accordingly. Use our local grocery store's brand salsa which added a little spice to the soup. The meatball recipe sounded a little bland, so I seasoned that up also. With a loaf of French bread, this truly hit the spot!

this is delicious! I added a bit of leftover parsnip, and didn't have seasoned bread crumbs - so used plain ones with a bit of italian seasoning. Delicious!

This was a great and easy recipe. I added some cumin and I seasoned the meatballs with salt, pepper and garlic. I also added minced garlic to the soup and some corn. I placed the cilantro in the soup instead of using it as a garnish. I can't wait to make this again!

Great winter soup to warm you up.  We are at a staggering -18 degress right now!  I put all of the ingredients in my slow cooker this morning (I made the meatballs in advance) and it is so flavorful and the meatballs are so tender.  I used homemade salsa, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  Thanks for a great soup recipe!

This was excellent and came together really fast.  After reading some of the reviews, I decided to add some seasoning to the meatball mixture - some chili powder, cumin, garlic and onion powder.  I had no beef boullion so I just used water and added some chopped celery and garlic.  My salsa seemed to cook down quite a bit so I added another 1/2 cup shortly before serving so I'd have some chunks of tomato in the soup.  Very flavorful and delicious!

This recipe was okay I guess when it comes to Albondigas I like making them the way my mom showed me how to make them instead of bread crumbs USE RICE! that's actually what im used to making them with and grated onion gives the meat a lot of flavor, garlic and sometimes ill add very small small chopped up zucchini to the meat ball and salt and pepper and to the broth ill add onions carrots potatoes and again zucchini...No Salsa!!! and def no milk! a bay leaf and a very small amount of tomato sauce and a small amount of cabbage 5-8 mins before the soup is done and its AMAZINGLY GOOD.

Bravo! I think this recipe is delicious and great! It really doesn't need any changes unless you prefer ground turkey over beef or need to watch your sodium intake.

Fast, simple and delicious. I used only 1/3 of the recommended medium onion. The salsa had plenty of onions in it and a whole onion seemed like a bit much. Turned out terrific! Will definitely make this again!

Very good, I just felt like it could use more seasoning in addition to what is written. It was just missing something- a little kick.

This was yummy and easy.  I had some frozen meatballs that I needed to use so I threw them in instead of making my own. The soup was tasty with just enough spice.  Next time I make this I'll try the meatballs from scratch.

Excellent. No left overs- and nobody even bothered with the tortillas. My 4 year old son was in the clean plate club twice in a row with this one.

outstanding!  I followed the recipe above using beef broth instead of boullion and adding a zucchini and small can of corn as other reviewers suggested.  I also bought the lime and fresh cilantro which really makes it, but also ate a few bowls without and it was still outstanding.  My picky father and boyfriend loved this soup.  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup is wonderful but I found it a bit bland and added a mix of dried beans which made even more hardy and tasty.  We ate it with a freshly baked loaf of bread - perfect dinner on a cold night... Thank you for the recipe...

This is a good recipe and I'll definitely make it again and again!  I had left over Mexicorn and a couple of parsnips I added just because I needed to get rid of them - and a little more veggie isn't going to hurt anyone!  Overall, I don't think it is necessary to change anything as it is good!

For a more authentic Mexican flavor, substitute crushed tortilla chips for the seasoned bread crumbs. Use a beef broth to reduce the sodium instead of high sodium bullion cubes. Serve with lime or lemon wedges to squeeze into the soup to add flavor. You will enjoy the reduced sodium and extra zip from the juice. Oh, of course cilantro leaves as a garnish. This soup is a house favorite.

I made this last night. This will be my new 'Vegetable Beef' soup! I put everything in the crockpot and put in on low over night. It smelled so good at 6:30am I had to try it! Definitely a keeper! Tonight, just heat and eat! Can't wait for dinner!

Absolutely perfect just as written.  The only thing I almost always add to any Mexican dish at the end....a generous squeeze of lime juice.  Turns the broth into something magical.  What an easy and quickly prepared recipe!

i didn't think this had a lot of flavor, but I'm wondering if that was because of the type of salsa I used. I did brown the meatballs before putting them in, the whole raw hamburger kinda grossed me out......

Followed the directions exactly as is and it was great!! Lots of flavor and very hearty. My husband had the great idea of throwing in some crushed tortilla chips before serving and that made it even better.

Que sabroso!My sisters and i loved it, and I love how cheap it is to make. The only thing I had to specifically buy was the ground beef. Everything else was on hand or improvisable. Lack of bread crumbs equaled a couple pieces of bread crumbled up with a packet of taco seasoning. I wish I had had hotter salsa, but my sisters like the mild version we had. Thanks for the great recipe!

EXCELLENT!  I was making this soup for about 10 adults so I changed accordingly and got nothing but RAVE reviews from everyone! 1 quart water 2 quarts Swanson's Beef Broth 8 carrots, sliced 1 cup celery (chopped in bite size pieces) 5 large potatoes, peeled and diced 1 medium onion, diced 3 cups salsa (I used Medium and it had quite a kick to it) 2 1/2 pounds ground beef 2/3 cup seasoned bread crumbs 2/3 cup milk chopped fresh cilantro I followed the cooking directions right from the recipe... I didn't feel the need to add additional spices like some of the other reviewers because I felt like the salsa would be enough and it really is.

My family loves it, You can make any kind of changes and it  would taste so good. But food for thought I would go low sodium because the bouillon cubes are high in sodium. Also good with turkey for anyone who wants the low cal way of doing things!!! enjoy oh yeah by the way if you do the recipe as is it wont cost you over ten bucks !!!

The broth and veggies were right, but the meatballs were bland.  The flavor of the broth wasn't enough to give the meatballs a distinct flavor.  It tasted like ground beef and nothing more.

This soup was delicious! Due to the fact that I didn't have any salsa on hand, I had to make a change to the recipe. Instead I added a large can of diced tomatoes, 1/2 cup of tomato sauce, garlic, green pepper and cumin to replace the salsa. I also did not have bouillion cubes, so I used a can of beef broth. Even with having to substitute the salsa, the soup was great! For someone who has kids and doesn't want the soup spicy, the plain diced tomatoes was a good substitution...

Very tasty, easy recipe.  I added fresh minced garlic, salt, pepper and ground cumin to the meatballs.  Of course, I garnished it with cilantro for my family and we sprinkled lime into it as well.  With avocado and tortillas on the side, it made a great meal and all my kids loved it.  Highly recomnended.

This is so easy and so tasty. My mother in law has been making albondigas for a very long time and this recipe tastes very close to hers. I am excited to make it again for my husband. We served it with warm flour tortilla- delicious!

My go-to for comfort food. I've tried several recipies, and this one is the best. I tend to add more veggies--carrots, grn. bell pepper, squash. Great stuff.

This recipe is great and indeed simple. I changed the meatball recipe. I ommited the milk and added 1/4 cup of uncooked rice, one egg and (1) bunch of mint (fresh) finely chopped.

The only change I made was to use beef broth instead of bouillon, but it turned out tasting like crummy cafeteria food. Will not make again.

Made tonight for my sick 3 year old. He's not a big fan of soup but loves meatballs so I thought it would be a good way to get some soothing broth in him. Added pieces of ginger, garlic and spinach as well as salt and pepper to the broth. Finely diced half a shallot and cilantro adding them to the meatball mixture before forming. The soup is very good my son loved it!

YUMMY...Perfect for a cold winter night. I cheated all around by using frozen meatballs. Used corn instead of carrots (kids preference) It was quick and easy.

Tastes pretty similar to Tortilla Soup, which is great since I love it too.  Tried this w/Garden Fresh Gourmet Salsa (Jack Special Medium) that I happened to have on hand.  Worked wonderfully since I didn't have fresh cilantro.  Added sea salt, smoked paprika, basil.  I also "vegan-ized" this soup (until I topped it w/real cheese ^.^).  Found a recipe for seitan meatballs, substituted the pecans it called for w/smokehouse almonds and lime-chili almonds, thought it would be a nice alternative for this overall dish.  Used vegetable Better Than Bullion, crumbled in the meatballs.

This was pretty good. It took a little longer than I thought it originally would. I had homemade salsa in the fridge, so I used that. And, I was out of seasoned breadcrumbs so I added some seasonings to some plain bread crumbs. The meatballs turned out very good with it. My potatoes were kind of small, so I added an extra potato. When it was done I expected a little more flavor as the potatoes and carrots were a little bland. So, at the end I added some garlic and onion powder, dried parsley, and salt and it was perfect. I didn't have the cilantro, which is probably the traditional way to serve this. But, I always have to top my soup with something and served it with oysters crackers and some cheese. Even though, it was not meant to be served in this fashion, I apologize to the submitter, but it made a good tasting cheeseburger vegetable soup. I definitely would have served with the cilantro, instead, if I would have had it.

Meh. Made this for dinner tonight. While my fiance enjoyed this quite a bit, I wasn't all that impressed. If this were well-seasoned, I might change my tune. This soup DEFINITELY needs spice! A bit of fresh cilantro and / or some Mexican spices would do the trick. That, along w/ the fact that my fiance gives this a thumb's up, is the reason for my 4 * rating (w/ a little help, this could be MUCH better). A local Mexican restaurant my fiance & I frequent serves a DEEELICIOUS Mexican-style chicken noodle soup. The broth is made with chicken stock, not beef stock. There are no veggies in it (other than onion) & it contains bits of chicken & sm. shell pasta. If I make this soup again, I would give it a complete overhaul. I'd substitute chicken for beef bullion, omit the MB's alltogether or substitute for tiny bits of cut-up chicken (my MB's were very bland, despite adding 1/2 a bunch of chopped cilantro, 1/2 of a sm. chopped onion & ~ 4 cloves minced garlic), add pasta or rice & some (ground) cumin / (dried) Mexican oregano. I'd also add 1/2 a bunch or so of chopped cilantro. A final change would be to dbl. The broth (i.e. H2O, bullion & salsa). There was not NEARLY enough broth! NOTE: This works best with a chunky salsa. Many of the reviews I read suggested adding a can of diced tomatoes, but if your salsa is thick & chunky, you won't need to. Served w/ absolute Mexican cornbread (Judy Spence) & watermelon aqua fresca (SB), this was an OK meal. Thanks for sharing, Belen. :-)

I changed it a little by subtracting 1 cup of water and the bullion cubes and substituting with a can of beef broth. I also used a quarter of a taco seasoning packet in the broth and a quarter in the meatballs.  Yumm!!!!!!!

This was great!!  I followed the recipe exactly as written, except that I added some chopped green pepper I had in the fridge, and fresh garlic, which I add to almost everything.  The only change I might make is to use mild salsa, only because we don't like so much heat.  Nevertheless, it was wonderful and easy to make.

The dish does not taste like I'm eating a jar of salsa!  I totally expected it to.  So easy to make.  The only thing was the meatball, it came out rather hard, but maybe it's supposed to be this way.  If I make this again, I will add an egg and more bread crumbs.  All in all it was a very good recipe. Thank you for sharing.

Instead of the salsa I used 1 can Rotelle extra hot tomatoes and 1/3 c ketsup. I made the meatballs bite size so you got one in every spoonful of the soup. Very good and spicy!

I make this frequently and everyone loves it.  I make the meatballs tiny so they last until the pot is gone.  I also process red and orange pepper, celery and carrots to give the broth more flavour.

Flavorful and Hearty!  Made a few minor modifications:  only 1 tbsp of hot salsa, added 1 tsp of garlic powder, fresh ground pepper, and since my husband doesn't care much for cilantro, I added a handful of chopped parsley after it was finished cooking.  I might added another onion next time since I couldn't taste it very much.  This is so easy and great for a cold winter day.  I was asked to make this again next week.  Thank you for posting this family pleaser!

This recipe arrived on a cold windy day which made it a great soup day. So I used what I had, ground turkey rather than beef (added a bit of raisins and crushed garlic to the turkey meatballs), frozen green peppers, a can of chopped tomatoes and a packet of taco seasoning mix rather than salsa, and a can of black beans for extra protien. 

It was delish ! Thanks.

Very delicious! I made it with salsa verde rather than the regular red salsa and beef broth instead of bouillion cubes. I also topped with some shredded cheese and sour cream. 
Next time I would be sure to buy a leaner ground beef since 85% made it a bit greasy. Also, it makes way more meatballs than there is broth so I would either add more liquid or less meat.
Will definitely make again though. The kids really liked the meatballs!

The following 'tweaks' were added by someone in '09, and ring true.  With the tweaks, this is a 5 star recipe!
Add rice to meatballs instead of bread crumbs. Lower fat ground beef is important because otherwise there is too much fat at the top of the soup. Add minced onions and cilantro to meatballs . Add 1/2 beef broth and 1/2 water. No milk. No Salsa necessarily, just lg can of diced tomatoes. Celery sliced very thinly can be added. And cilantro is NOT an option it is necessary in both the meatballs and broth.

This soup was delicious!  We froze extra meatballs for the next time we make this.  It was easy and fast to make. My kids loved that the meatballs cooked in the soup (they were worried at first). Thank you Belen for an amazing recipe!!!

Wow! Im from a border town in AZ..and this almost brought tears to my eyes..It is simply Wonderful comfort food! I was a little skeptical at first but it is simple,delicious,and budget friendly. This truly has an authentic taste and you will not be disappointed for trying this soup. The only thing I did different was add zucchini and a can of drained corn... REMEMBER:  Add lots and lots of cilantro!!

How have I lived all these years and never heard of this soup?  You know how I found it? I typed into the ingredient list on all recipes the ingredients I had which was ground beef, potatoes and carrots and into the soup catagory.  Up came this strange sounding soup which I had all the ingredients for and love those mixed flavors.  Did everything according to the directions but got the meatballs too big.  It was delicious for company of 6 people   served it again to day to company and did not have enough broth to cook the meatballs that I had left.  I also did not think the meatballs had much flavor ( has some uncooked leftover) 
so i mashed them  down and added some italian seasoning and salt and re-rolled them into smaller 1/2 size...added a cup of water to soup and a 6oz can of V8 juice to soup and some homemade taco seasoning and WALLLLLLLLA!  so much more divine!  Super calafragalisticdelicious!

I enjoyed this soup. I left out the onions for my son. It was very quick and easy to make. I personally like a little saltier flavor, so I will add salt next time and maybe more veggies, like celery. I added the cilantro in while it was cooking and I added avacado to it right before I eat it. I will make it again!

Our new favorite soup! This was easy to make and the entire family loves it. The only thing I did differently was to use 1 quart of beef broth insteast of the water and boullion cubes. When making meatballs, I added 1 tsp. garlic powder and 1 tsp. cumin.

GREAT recipe!  I've made it several times, and I do use low-sodium broth instead.  I like to add garlic and sometimes other veggies.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great, simple recipe!  I used a can of beef broth and water instead of bouillon cubes, about a half pound of ground turkey instead of all ground beef, added a tomato and minced cilantro into the meatballs and separately into the soup.  Also added a little bit of salt and pepper to the meatballs.  Came out beautifully!

We really loved this soup.  It's got a delicate tomato flavored broth and is perfectly filling with the tender meatballs and potatoes.  The meatballs did add a bit of fat to the soup, even though I used super lean beef, so take the time to de-fat if you can (or sit it in the fridge overnight and scoop it away later)!  Served with macaroni for those who wanted it to be more filling.  But for someone who hates meatballs, these were great - the texture is tender and not tough.

Excellent soup.  Very hearty and filling.  I used mild salsa and it still had a kick.  Great weeknight meal served with a crusty loaf of bread.  Even my picky son ate a whole bowl!

My husband and I loved this soup.  Although I took the advice of one of the ratings and did it traditional style by adding rice, sausage, egg and spices to the meatballs.  I also added zucchini and corn to broth mix and omitted the milk.  It came out so yummy I am making it tonight one pot for us and another pot for friends.  This will be one of our winter favorites.  Thank You Belen for getting me started on something I always wanted to try.

Very good.  I baked the meatballs first just to cut down on grease and then put them in during the last 20 minutes.  I was surprised salsa and beef bouillon made such a tasty soup.

Delicious!  I did doctor up the meatballs to my taste using garlic, oregano, cumin and some salt and pepper.  I also used a quart of beef broth in place of the water/cubes.  Thanks for sharing!

This was really good.  I used some of my home made hot salsa which gave it amazing flavor.  As per other reviewers I added more seasoning to the ground beef (minced onion, garlice powder, salt & paprika)

Very nice.  I took the advice to add zuchinni and beef broth and omitted the  boullion cubes.  I make my own  salsa which is on the hot side of the spice scale, so I didn't need any cayenne.  The only thing I added that wasn't mentioned was ground cumin.  I can't imagine a Mexican soup without it.

Absolutely outstanding! I added: 1 more potato, 4 stalks celery sliced thin, cumin, garlic sea salt, black pepper and cilantro to meatballs, used 2 XL beef bouillon cubes, and garnished with cilantro and a squeeze of lime.  5 stars all the way!

I have been making this soup for around a year.  It is quick and tasty.  My family loves it.  I use beef broth instead of bullion cubes.  I also serve it with a warm crusty bread.  MUST TRY.  Very simular to stew.  Great for potlucks and left overs.

Hearty and quick, as promised.  I jacked around with this recipe some though because I felt like there wasn't enough spice in the meatballs.  To the broth I added chopped cilantro and a little more salsa than called for.  I probably should have backed off on the salsa, because it was really hot.  I added some more beef broth after we ate the first time, to tone down the spice and because there was a heavy meatball to broth ratio.  To the meatballs I added coriander, cumin, old bay, chopped cilantro and chopped olives.  I was really happy with the meatballs because they had much more flavor than typical albondiga meatballs.

This recipe was delicious!!! I cut the salsa with a little tomato sausce to be sure that my toddler could eat it..I also added 2 zucchini and used 2lbs of ground beef.. the recipe turned out perfectly! I did as others suggested and made my meatballs small..Could not have been easier, tastier! I have now changed my old recipe to this one! thanks

One word....AWSOME!  When I made this, my husband could not stop raving about it.  First time I made it I did not put any celantro in it. But the second time I did and boy did that make a big difference! Once served we put avacodos in it as well and that just really added to the already yummy flavor. Now I am making it again tonight!

Terrific recipe!  I made it exactly as given the first time but then made a change to make it healthier the second time around.  Cook the meatballs first, in water with bouillon or bouillon cubes, then throw out the fat along with the bouillon and water once the meatballs are cooked.  Then make the soup with bouillon/water or stock (as other reviewers suggested), cooking the carrots and potatoes with the salsa for 15-20 mins before adding the already-cooked meatballs.  Continue cooking until meatballs are warm (about 5 mins) then serve.  I served this with warm flour tortilla wedges and everybody in my household loves it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

YUM !!! So easy and fast and has a cooked all day taste ! I used beef broth in place of water and boillion cubes. I didn't have cilantro and just shook some dried basil in, probably isn't needed tho. Great flavor without having to add salt and pepper. Must be the salsa. My whole family and friends really liked it. I served with crusty bread. Thanks Belen !!! :)

We really loved this flavorful, quick, inexpensive  dinner.  I was a little worried that my husband would think it was just an appetizer, and be wanting somrthing else to eat, but with a salad and some crusty bread, it was a delicious meal.

I did use beef stock rather than bullion cubes, and I added some additional veggies we had in the fridge, mushrooms, cabbage and a little corn.  Very good, and will become part of our rotation.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a really good soup.  I don't think a quart of water is enough.  I added more water.  The salsa made it too spicy for my liking so I will use only a cup next time.  Add cilantro in the broth at the end rather than garnish it.  I also added some left over shrimp in the broth and it was great.  I think this would taste great over rice.

This recipe brought me back to childhood, my grandmother's cooking was the BEST!  
I made this tonight and my kids came home from work and loved it.  Thank you 
my own spin on it was that I first cooked the meat balls in the salsa before adding into the vegetable soup and added cilantro at the last minute. I also made white rice on the side to pour into the soup.

This is the BEST recipe! I added zucchini and more seasonings (garlic powder, onion powder) to the meatballs and soup (granulated chicken bouillon) otherwise followed the recipe. A definite keeper and it makes a ton of meatballs! Can't wait to bring this to the next potluck.

I have to admit I only use this recipe to make the actual meatballs, which are excellent, and which I cook in chicken broth.  I then use them to make my own homemade soup.  I also use them to make my own version of Swedish meatballs!  Delish!  These meatballs are very versatile.  Thanks for posting!

This soup was very good, it had just the right amount of flavor.  I did make a few changes, I cooked the carrots first in the soup for about 10min then added the meatballs  cooked them about 20 min before adding the potatoes and onion.  I also added zucchini and celery.  lastly I added a squeeze of lime juice to each bowl before serving.  This was an amazing recipe.

I used two 14oz cans of beef broth and water. I also used about 4 potatoes, 3 celery stalks, squash and onion. I omitted the salsa and used just a bit of tomato sauce. I also put in some garlic powder and cooked the balls in the oven for about 10 minutes before putting them into the pan. I made some rice on the side and put it in each bowl before serving.  This came out really good and I can't wait to try another bowl in a few hours :D

Very good, even my picky 6 year old loved it, gave it two thumbs up.  Instead of bouillion I used beef broth.  I also mixed some adobo in the meatballs.  I put it all in the crockpot instead of cooking on the stove and the house smelled great all day.  Everyone loved it.  A winner!

Delicious and easy- Even with making the meatballs from scratch!  I used organic beef stock instead of the bouillon cubes, added garlic powder, salt & pepper to the meatball mixture, and cut the spiciness of the salsa by using 1 cup of canned fire roasted tomatoes and one can of fire roasted mild chilies. Next time, I will try to cut the fat a little by baking the meatballs in the oven until halfway cooked and then finishing them in the soup to get the flavor through the meat with less oil pooling on top. Husband had 2.5 bowls = success!

I REALLY loved this soup and so did my husband.  I did change some things from your recipe.  I only had some matchstick style carrots, and they worked nice. I only used a little bit of them because I really don't care for carrots. Then I had my husband go out and buy some fresh cilantro, because I didn't know if I would like it.  I REALLY LOVED IT!  Now my husband didn't care for the cilantro, because he doesn't like cilantro. I am going to keep this recipe for sure, and I'm going to give it to my children to try. A must have!!!!!

Delicious! I added some things to suit my own taste and the result was a very satisfying hearty soup. I added some chick peas, red lentils, corn, cumin and cayenne pepper. Maybe my additions ruined the authenticity of this recipe, but they sure made my husband want more.

All I can say is YUM!!!!!!!! Altho I too cheated and used frzn meatballs. I also added a zucchini, plus more carrots and celery. I love to order albondigas soup at Mexican restaurants, and now I can make my own!! Thanks Belen for this recipe. I made a double batch and took some over to my brother who is laid up with a broken ankle- he said the soup was to DIE FOR!!!!! This is a true keeper- can't wait to make it again!!!

So easy and delicious! I actually made it even easier by using the frozen meatballs I had in my freezer. I thawed them before putting them in the soup and then heated it all up together. This is a family favorite!

I liked this a lot!  I used salsa that I canned myself.  If you think it's bland, you might want to try a different brand of salsa.

This soup was awesome.  I had most of the ingredients on hand and was able to substitute Ground Turkey in place of the beef.  Still excellent.  My 7 year old daughter ate this up and even went back for 2nds.  Definately a keeper.  Topped it off with some fresh cilantro.

This was great and very easy.  The day before I cooked this soup, I made home made salsa.  Since my salsa already had onions and cilantro, I omitted the onion that was called for in this recipe.  I also had some left over Mexican rice that I threw in towards the end of cooking (just long enough to heat) as well as some canned corn.  Very tasty!!

I loved it!  Highly recommend.  Like others, I added a bit of garlic powder, paprika and red pepper to the meatballs.  Not sure if it really needed it as the soup turned out to have a lot of zip.  I used a 16 oz. jar of Pace Picante medium.  It was a little too spicy for my kids (ages 13 and 15).  Serve it with crusty bread and definitely top it with the cilantro.  I thought the cilantro added a lot.  Next time I might add another potato or two as I really liked the potato flavor and it cut the spice a bit.

This is really good, and my family enjoys it. we like things really spicy so we do use hot salsa. The meatballs were bland so second time I used garlic, basil, oregano, and some fresh pepper. Much better. I serve with warm bread. A wonderful satisfying meal. Thanks!

I liked this soup. The only thing I would change is add fresh onions and garlic to the meatballs. Maybe some herbs for additional flavor. They were bland to me but the rest was good. I used up all the veggies in my fridge that were on their last legs (spinach, cabbage, tomato, and zucchini).

I had never heard of this soup before this.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I did use turkey meatballs instead.  This soup was awesome, and was a bit hit.  I ended up eating the left overs for lunch the following week, and my coworkers commented on how yummy it looked.  Definitely 5 stars!

I love this recipe. Be sure to use mild chunky salsa so it won’t be too spicy. The chunky salsa also adds a little zing to the soup. I add extra potatoes. I like the russet and keep the skin on… Sometimes I throw in a little celery for kicks. I enjoy this with lots of fresh squeezed lime slices and chopped cilantro! The soup is perfect when you feel a cold coming on. Also…try using the Italian seasoned ground turkey for the meatballs…it is AMAZING.

I've made this several times now.  I use beef broth instead of bouillon/water, and I usually use frozen meatballs.  You can throw everything but the cilantro and the meatballs in the crockpot on high for a couple of hours.  Then add the meatballs and cook for about 2 more hours, then garnish with lots of cilantro.  One of my all time favorite recipes!

I feel like a jerk, but this recipe was sort of weird.  I seem to remember my mom making it with rice (not bread crumbs). I didn't like it.  Wah!

This was a great soup and so easy to make.  I would suggest using 4% ground beef.  If you use higher fat I would brown them or cook them in the oven so that the fat drains out.  Otherwise you will have very greasy broth.  I also added corn and celery.  Loved it!

EDITED: this meal has become an almost weekly staple in our house for the last two months. You should know 2 things - (1) I almost never make the same thing twice and (2)it's summer, with sometimes 100+ degree heat.  The only other thing I want to add to my previous review is use good quality fresh pico de gallo. The quality of the salsa can change this meal from good to incredible. ORIGINAL:  This is an amazing recipe. I made it twice now, using homemade chicken broth, ground turkey meatballs (changed to 1/4 cup of Italian bread crumbs and 1/4 cup of milk), and fresh spicy pico de gallo.  It's becoming a weekly staple.

Yummy, and pretty easy too!! I added one leek as I needed to use it up and also added a can of corn as another person suggested. 
I didn't have seasoned breadcrumbs, so I added some parmesan cheese, and a sprinkle each of parsley, thyme, basil and garlic powder.

I made this soup with some of the modifications listed in the reviews: I sauteed the onions and carrots in olive oil with minced garlic.  I used beef stock instead of the cubes.  And I added celery too.  IT WAS FANTASTIC!  I have to say, though, the fresh cilatro really adds to the final flavour of the recipe.  Don't skip this step!  This is a very tasty meal.

This was a good Mexican flavored soup.  I added some fresh cilantro, garlic powder and salt to the meatball mixture and used reduced sodium beef broth instead of the water and bouillon.  Chi Chi's chunky salsa worked good for us.  Next time I will add corn for more dimension.  I wasn't sure only 1 quart of liquid would be enough but once I added the salsa it just covered the veggies and meatballs and turned out to be the perfect amount of liquid.  I didn't cook the veggies before adding the meatballs b/c I thought they would turn to mush.  Formed the meatballs, then cut up all the veggies and brought them to a boil and added the meatballs right away.  Turned out perfect this way.

This is similar to how my Mother in Law would cook it.  She added cumin to her receipe.  She would also make the mexican rice and add it to the finished soup with cooked torillas on the side.  I always tore the tortillas and added it to the water for the soupsoup.  I use beef bullion cubes or beef broth added the water for the soup.  Also I dropped the meat balls in the boiling water and let it cook then add the potatoes, carrots. a few cabbage leaves, zucchini and onions.  I use cut up tomatoes.  Add salsa to the soup in the bowl.

It was very tasty. I would not recommend making it with ground turkey. Although it was delicious, it was very difficult to form the meatballs.

This was the most effortlessy delicious soup I have ever made. I used low sodium beef broth with some concentrated beef base. I added chickpeas as well. You can not go wrong and as always season to taste.

I made this but added spices!  It really needed some ooomf - added hot paprika, S&P, garlic powder, extra onions, sriracha (we like it spicy) and Lawry's seasoning salt.  Very good - we all enjoyed it.  I like the rice instead of bread crumb idea I read in one review.  A keeper.

Deliciously fresh-tasting, terrific vegetables, and very good meatballs.  Awesome broth too.  Here are a few tiny changes I made, only to use what I had on hand:  mild salsa,   20 oz canned beef broth plus 12 oz water and 1 bouillon cube,   plain breadcrumbs with a few shakes of dried basil and garlic powder.  I used ground chuck too.   Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  For their simplicity, the meatballs were fantastic!   I made the soup yesterday and put it in the fridge.  Tonight before reheating, I skimmed off the very smallest amount of solidified fat before reheating.   My skinny husband NEVER takes a second serving of ANYTHING, but you guessed it!  He took a second bowl.  It's that good.  Some of the other reviews have some good suggestions for variations...but I don't think I'll change this!  Thank you for sharing!

Time saver and SUPER EASY to make by using pre-baked Costco turkey meatballs! We used locally made, fresh salsa and organic beef broth from the market. Upon serving, we added sliced avocado and tortilla chips. Full of flavor! We will be making this again and again.

I only had ground sirloin, & my meatballs pre-made the night before,(baked on foil, draining on paper towels, thus removing a lot of fat), I like them small, so when you take a bite there's a little bit of soup ingredients in your spoon. The one thing added to mine is more potatoes ,scrubbed w/the skin on(nutrition in the skins}& I use only organic canned or boxed broth & tomatoes. I have been eating healthy for a great deal of my life, but now for about 12 yrs.

I made this tonight for my grandparents. It was amazing. I followed the suggestions to add paprika, and cayenne pepper. And I added Taco seasoning too. I added my own touch with garlic powder and diced fresh jalapeños in the meatballs. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

This is the same recipe I have used for years and every now and then I make a few changes depending on who is eating it. I prefer to add a little garlic to the meatballs and a little mint, in winter I add a diced jalepeno(just for a little heat), but otherwise this recipe is fine. I also choose to top mine with juice from a couple slices of lime, but I grew up eating lime on pretty much anything mexican.

This is so easy and so D-Lish! It's one of those meals that you are looking forward to leftovers the next day! I add garlic to everything- so that was a given! We like to top off with Avo's and a squeeze of fresh citrus (lemon or lime). This is a recipe we have been making for years-this is just my first time to review it! Thanks Belen

Simple, healthy, and tasty! I followed the base of the recipe, but added considerable seasoning to appease family tastes. My version: 1 lb. lean ground beef seasoned with a little sea salt, pepper, onion/garlic powders, cilantro, ancho chili pepper, and cumin. Only used 1/4 c bread crumbs and 1/4 c milk and let the meat "rest" while I chopped and prepped the veggies. Omitted the salsa, but tripled the liquid, using a mix of both beef and chicken bases (that was GOOD!) I also seasoned the broth with the same spices used for the meat to impart extra flavor. While the veggies were boiling, I shaped the meatballs. Didn't need to simmer as long as recipe stated. Served with tortilla chips and sliced avocadoes, this was good! This will be a regular fall/winter rotation for sure.

Incredible recipe! Mine turned out a little hot due to the salsa I used but that's my fault for not testing it out before dumping the whole container in. I added a teasp each of cumin, oregano, a couple pinches of paprika, corriander because I just love those mexican flavors in my soups. I printed this one out and added it to my home recipe book.

This recipe has lots of flavour. I didn't have cilantro and am usually not a fan. I didn't have quite enough salsa so I added a tomato. I also only had mild salsa so I added a few crushed peppers.

This was delicious! I modified it a little bit but only because I have finicky eaters in my family. Instead of boullion cubes, which I didn't have any, I used low sodium chicken broth. I also seasoned the soup with salt,pepper, garlic and onion powder. The meatballs I made exactly the same only I did season with onion powder and salt and pepper. I chopped up cilantro and let each person choose it they wanted it. Oh...and instead of Salsa, which I didn't have any, I used a can of tomatoe sauce. The great thing about this recipe is that you can make it your own!

I rated this a two because majority rules.  Hubby & daughter would only eat the meatballs.  I personally loved it.  I did cheat and used frozen MB, and I added a little more potato than it called for as well.  I precooked the meatballs and sponged them with a papertowel.  I haven't had great success with meatball soups.  They all turnout too greasy and this seemed to really help.  Unfortunately I probably won't be making this again since the family didn't like it.

I doubled the amount of water to make more broth.  I also used the jarred beef base instead of boullion.  I halved the amount of salsa, too.  I mixed in chopped cilantro with the beef, the way my grandpa used to.  Really good!

I made a lot of the changes mentioned by other reviewers, but I thought this recipe was just "OK."  I added two cloves of minced garlic and some cumin to the meatballs.  I also used low-sodium beef broth because I didn't have any bouillon. Threw in a stalk of celery and half of a diced red bell pepper, just to use up some veggies I had in the fridge. I sauteed the onion, celery, and red pepper in a little bit of butter before adding the broth. Ended up adding garlic powder, cumin, a can of stewed tomatoes, and tons of salt because the broth was so bland. Even after those additions, my boyfriend described the flavor as "very subtle."  It wasn't horrible, just not nearly as good as I'd hoped.

I didn't like it at first, but it grew on me. (I had two bowls, lol.)  My husband also gobbled it down.  I took the suggestion of others and used frozen meatballs (put them in the put while frozen) and instead of the water/bouillon, I used two cans beef consomme + 1 can water.  Didn't have cilantro (wish i did).  Sour cream garnish is a must!

Good except it turned out a little too greasy for me. Next time I will make sure to use a ground beef with as little fat content as possible to avoid this. Really good flavors though

Super easy and super filling! I used pace picante HOT sauce and it gave this soup the perfect spicyness. Too spicy for the kids to eat though. Very simple to throw together on a weeknight. I did cheat and use frozen meatballs. Thanks for the wonderful soup recipe.

This was a great base recipe...I made some minor changes. I used Knor Chicken Broth Cubes, I used stewed tomatoes instead of salsa, I put one egg in the beef for the meatballs and added rice in them instead of bread crumbs. I also added in Garlic Powder, Cayenne, and Paprika to taste. Loved it, so did coworkers and husband! Thanks for sharing.

This was very easy and tasty. After reading other peoples reviews, I did make some of the suggested modifications. I added some seasonings to the meat, cumin, salt, cayenne pepper, cilantro and some finely chopped onions. I also browned the meatballs a little before putting them into soup. I also agree that adding the cilantro before serving is a must and not a option as some other people have said.

Very good soup but needed some spices. I added a good amount of Oregano, Cumin, Paprika, and Garlic powder. I also threw in 2 zuchinnis and some chopped celery I had on hand. Wonderful and easy soup.

This is a family friendly recipe with great flavor! I used a quart of beef broth and added a can of condensed french onion soup instead of the diced onion. I added italian seasoning and cilantro to the meatballs and omitted the milk. I sauteed the meatballs in a frying pan before adding them to the broth. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow! This is so super easy to make and yummo! I served this to my family. Hubbie loved it and the kids even gobbled it up. My variations: I used ground turkey since we are watching fat, used fresh made bread crumbs since I was out of premade, and seasoned the meat with garlic powder and pepper. I used 2 plastic spoons to make the meatballs and found if you dip them in the broth before scooping out each meatball it makes it so easy! I did add more water to make it stretch further, but this recipe is one I will put in my monthly menu calendar!

1 quart of water wasn't nearly enough, I had to add two more cups of water.  Also I thought it lacked flavor, next time will be using beef broth instead of cubes.   Because you drop in the meatballs before cooking them we were worried about the fat content.  Next time I am going to use precooked ones.

I made a few adjustments. I used vegetable broth instead of water. Mixed in chopped cilantro, 1 egg and a little lime juice to the meatballs (no milk) and baked them in the oven first. Chopped up 3 tomatoes (didn't have any carrots) and threw in some kale for added nutrients. Then I threw everything into the crock pot, set it on high for about 4 hours. Tasted lovely. We added a little freshly squeezed lemon juice before eating to give it extra zing. Will make again!

Wow! This was very good and easy! Even my 14yr old daughter that fought me on eating it because she 'doesn't like albondigas soup' had seconds! I used hot salsa and whoaaa...way too spicy (especially in already boiling soup). So for those that don't like it that spicy, go for the mild salsa. I had to correct it by taking away some broth and adding more water with another bouillon cube and a little sugar to balance out the spiciness. Other than that the only thing I changed was I added a little salt to the meatballs and added cabbage to the soup towards the end. This is my first attempt at this soup and my family loved it. Will definitely make this again!

Very easy, very tasty and it reheats great. The only problem I had was that it was a little greasy from the meatballs, but I don't know how to fix that without going meatless (bleh!).

AWESOME! i wasn't expecting the flavor i got out of this, and it was a great surprise.  my entire family (included aunt and cousins who happened to be stopping by) loved this! next time, though, i think i'll use 2 lbs of meat and double everything else that goes in the broth, that way i can get a little more soup with the meatballs.

This was pretty good.  I thought it was a little bland so I added some extra spice to the soup.  To the meatballs I added some cumin as well.  Also instead of using the cilantro as just a garnish I added it the soup about 10 minutes before it was done.  With all that being said and done it turned out pretty good.

When I initialy read this recipe I was leary (the idea of using salsa in a soup was the diciding factor of my leariness).  After making it, I can honestly say, "wonderful".  Quick, easy and it takes like it took forever.  The meatballs, when added gives this a little extra on the taste. I changed nothing in this recipe and could honestly not think of anything that could make it better.

This was so easy and tasted really good.  The only thing I will do next time is double the amount of liquid as it was more of a stew than a soup as is.

This was fine but not quite what I had anticipated.  I added garlic, salt, pepper, a little cilantro and green chili powder to the meatball mixture and made bite size meatballs that I baked before adding to the soup to eliminate fat drippings in the broth.  I opted for Herdez hot salsa, substituted beef broth for the water and beef cubes -but it just seemed to lack something.  It was more like a spicy beef vegetable soup than the albondiga I've enjoyed at the area Mexican restaurants.  
Maybe this is one of those recipes that taste better the next day.
10/18 -Note:  Yes, this is better the next day.

My husband and I enjoy this yummy, warming soup. I have made it twice and like how easy it is. I added cumin both times I made it, once to the broth and once to the meatballs because my breadcrumbs weren't seasoned. It adds a great taste.

My brother made this for the whole family when we were together for the holidays and it was great!  He used frozen meatballs and left out the onion (as a favor to his big sister).  I think the choice of salsa is very important in how this recipe turns out so make sure you add your favorite kind.

I used half beef and half pork for the meatballs. OH MAN. My favorite soup. My husband brought it to work and a couple of his co workers asked for some. Very, very delicious. I added a bit of hot sauce to it because I'm used to it being pretty spicy at my fav restaurants. Thanks!

Excellent! I've read the reviews and can't figure why people want to mess with the recipe. We've made this three times this month. It's a simple vegie beef soup with a great kick. The salsa makes or breaks the soup, so use your favorite (we like Pace medium). I keep cooked hamburger in the freezer, so I  use two 1-cup baggies instead of making meatballs. To speed it up, microwave the carrots and potatoes while the broth, salsa and onion are coming to a simmer. After the vegies are done I add in the cooked hamburger and serve - it doesn't need to simmer to blend the flavors. It's great leftover, but it doesn't hang around for very long! We like it with bread and butter, and I'm going to try cornbread soon.

This soup is very tasty and quick.  It was extra quick for me because I used frozen meatballs.  The cilantro was wonderful.  I used a mild salsa which was great.  I let my hsuband spice up his own bowl with Tabasco.

I'm giving this three stars only because it made really good meatballs.  I will probably use these for other recipes.  My husband and I really didn't like the salsa in the soup.  I tried to salvage it by adding more veggies and our favourite spices, but the salsa flavour was just too strong.

Made this last night with a few modifications that I thought intensified the flavors. Started by sauteeing the onion & carrots in a little olive oil with garlic and added a chopped canned chipotle pepper.  Added some cumin, then stock (instead of water & boullion). Added 15 oz. can of tomato sauce (gave the broth a richness). To meatballs, I added chopped onion, cilantro, garlic & cumin.  Turned out really well.

This soup is wonderful!  I found it a bit greasy but then I only had regular ground beef, next time I'll buy lean.  Other than that it was perfect.  I used my own homemade salsa.  Perfect for a cold and dreary evening.

Thanks for sharing!

Love this recipe, Belen.  Easy and very tasty.  I modified the recipe to my own tastes to give it more spice.  I sauteed onions and garlic in 1 tbsp of oil and added some chopped fresh chilli to start with.  I then tossed the vegetables through the mixture to coat.  Followed the rest of the recipe for the soup to the letter.

For the meatballs, I spiced things up by using lean beef mince and flavouring this with the Barbara's Spicy Chicken Breasts spice mix from this site.  We loved this one pot, healthy dinner!  Fabulous with warmed flat bread.

The soup was good, but next time I think I'll use mild salsa instead of medium. I made cornbread in a cast iron skillet to complement it, and they were great together.

Added 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes, a 14.5 oz. can of tomatoes and okra, small bag of mixed veggies (corn, carrots, asparagus), plus used frozen beef meatballs (for convenience).  Also added 1/2 tsp of salt, 1 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp. granulated garlic.

Soup was outstanding and even better on day 2.  Will be a regular menu item, particularly for those cold, damp winter days.

Tastes fantastic and very easy to make. My discriminating Latin wife loves this recipe. It has become a part of our standard rotation.  We also squeeze a little lime juice add some avocado chunks for a very authentic taste.

Very good, stretched the recipe to a large pot by making these changes after reading reviews: 8 cups of water, used 2 heaping tbsp of beef "better than bouillon", added 3 tbsp. dried cilantro, 1/4 tsp. cayenne pepper, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and paprika.  Bring to a boil and add 1/2 cup rinsed brown lentils.  Simmered for 40 minutes then added salsa, carrots, onion and 1 cup diced zucchini.   Brought to a boil, then simmered for 20 minutes.  Added  diced potato and 1 lb ready made frozen sirloin meatballs (semi thawed and quartered), simmered another 20 minutes.  Soup was still very thick, so added another 2 cups of water.  Next time maybe use 1/4 cup of lentils OR skip the meat altogether.  Will definitely be on our regular rotation!

I substitute cans of veg-all for the potatoes, carrots, and onion. This is my go to recipe. All the flavor for an authentic albondigas is in this recipe. I also add instant rice, egg, garlic powder, and onion powder to the meatballs instead of bread crumbs and milk.

I made this for the first time and wow did this turn out really good. I did make a few changes based on other reviews and I added my own twist  as well. First I used 6 cups of water and chicken broth combined. I added about 2 teaspoons of chopped garlic to the soup.  I added squash to the red potatoes and carrots. I added 5 ounces of tomato sauce and one orange package of  Goya Sazon.  As far as the meatballs, I added onions and chopped cilantro , salt and pepper and half teaspoon of paprika to the meatballs. I also added 1 cup of white rice instead of bread crumbs.  My whole family asked me for more.........." Wow"  that never happens.

Made it pretty much exactly as is, and it was awesome. I didn’t have fresh potatoes so I used frozen diced, perfect for soup and less work for me! So easy and good, made with ingredients almost always readily available at home.

Surprisingly flavorful and very hearty. Initially I was concerned that there wasn't enough broth to cover and evenly cook the meatballs, but they came out perfectly. I used ground turkey with good results.

This was delicious! And just as my husband remembered it from his childhood. I made this for my husband tonight. He was reminiscing last night about some of his favorite childhood meals and Albondigas was at the top of his list. So we typed in the name of the soup and chose this one as it sounded most like what he remembered. It was very easy to make. We did add a dash of pepper, an egg, a bit of panko & white rice to the meatball mixture, and chopped celery to the stock. Also topped off our bowls with some homemade pico, per my husbands request. Defiantly will be making this again soon.

Absolutely wonderful comfort food for a rainy day!  Great as is although I did cheat and use frozen meatballs and adjusted the spices a bit.  Will make it again....

We never used bread crumbs or cilantro in the meat balls. In our family Albondigas was made with fresh mint crushed up with garlic add chopped onion and rice in the meat plus an egg or two to hold the meat together when cooking..............

Not bad but Not very authentic. A more authentic version includes ground pork, dried or fresh mint mixed with meatballs and rice. I make a beef stock the day before. The addition of crushed tomato makes a difference and I usually add an1/2pkg of frozen green peas before serving to add color and helps to cut the salt

This is not albondigas.  You do not put breadcrumbs or milk and you need a tomato sauce based broth, not salsa.  Horrible.

I used Better Than Bouillon roasted beef base for the broth. I used ground turkey instead of beef . I used rice instead of bread crumbs for the meatballs and added finely chopped mint to them. I used barley, chopped carrots, chopped celery, onions, peas and green beans for the vegetables. This is a very versatile soup whatever veggies you have on hand will suffice.

I sometimes substitute the ground beef with ground turkey when I want to be a little healthier. I also add just a little bit of salt and pepper to the meat. This recipe is very delicious.

Was very good and easy to make! In the meatballs added some garlic powder and paprika. Also made sure the salsa was a roasted garlic type, which gave it an extra kick.

I used one small can of beef consommé and one cube of beef boullion and added one cup of water because I felt like there was not enough broth. I also opted for a large can of diced tomatoes instead of salsa because I had a green bell pepper in the fridge that I wanted to use. Definitely add some garlic powder, paprika, oregano, salt and pepper as my broth seemed a bit bland (maybe because of the extra water I added). But in the end, this was delicious! I made it with ground turkey to help with the health factor.

I  made it with what I had on hand in my pantry, I added 3/4 cup of rice in the meatball mixture, omitted the milk and breadcrumbs, and added 2 eggs, (however, I will try with breadcrumbs when I'm out of rice), I didn't have fresh vegetables and used two 15 ounces of mixed canned vegetables.  I added my own spices of Knorr Caldo de Tomate  - 1 1/2 tablespoons, a sprinkle of Kosher salt, garlic powder, fresh ground pepper, and it was good!

Love this recipe I only made a couple of changes. I added some kosher salt to the broth and I used Panko bread crumbs and added my own blend of seasoningredients to the meat balls.

I added to the meatballs some parmesan and cilantro. Then I used tomato sauce in place of hot salsa. I added some chili to make it spicier. The result was very good!

This recipe is excellent for a quick and delicious albondigas soup. I made it with 8 cups of water, and an entire jar of Herdez Medium Salsa. I also used rice instead of breadcrumbs because I am trying to stay away from wheat products. Sometimes I add the potatoes and sometimes not. Just depends on if I have them on hand. Always add celery though. YUM!

Outstanding. Also took the advise of previous reviews and added garlic salt, cayenne, paprika, salt, pepper, and 1/2 additional beef bouillon cube. This is so good that I anticipate making it often.

I grew up in San Fernando, CA.  All of my friends were Mexican, Colombian and Cuban.  True Albondigas meatballs are made with rice not breadcrumbs.  Also, they add Zucchini to the soup.  Make sure to cut your veggies in big chunks.

It was fine, but doesn't taste like authentic Albondigas soup.  I would use a different broth without the salsa.

My family destroyed this, I only got one bowl!  Instead of salsa, I subbed a can of fire roasted Rotel, plus added a fat clove of garlic. I only had panko crumbs handy, but they did the trick with a pinch of salt. My four year old daughter helped make the meatballs so we ended up with different sizes in the pot. I have never cooked meatballs that way, and I was surprised at how well they held together and how tender they were after a very short amount of time. We will definitely be making this again!

This soup was delicious. I took the advice of a couple reviewers and added celery and some garlic salt. I didn't make my own meatballs because I had some in the freezer that I  needed to use up. The leftovers were even better. I told my husband I think I am going to make another pot of this just so I can have it everyday for lunch. I made it in the slow cooker because I was going to be gone all afternoon and it was perfect when we got home. I will be making this again for sure.

I followed the directions exactly and it came out great. Highly recommend it.  Next time I will add something hot like cayenne pepper, or fresh hot peppers from my garden because I like  spicy hot food.

I've made this twice so far, both times using turkey instead of beef to reduce the fat content, and switching from a jarred salsa to a fresh one the second time.  I think it tastes better made with the jarred salsa; possibly due to a higher salt content?  In any case, adding a little salt to the bowl really boosted the flavor the second time around.  This is definitely a keeper for me.

I added a little rice to the soup which may have been why it was too bland. I cooked it with cilantro. Next time I'll more cilantro, maybe use hot vs mild salsa and ditch the rice.

Loved it! I added celery, frozen peas and corn, also 2/3 cup white rice, used chicken broth instead of water, but I still added the beef bouillon. I then served it with shredded meunster cheese and tortilla chips. Delicious! Next time I will chop some avocado too. Can't wait!

Liked this a lot- you can easily make as is and it will taste great but somewhat bland. I added 1/3 cup uncooked rice and an egg to the meatballs then just a teaspoon each of paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper. You can go 4 cups of beef broth instead to make it lower sodium as well and an additional small can of tomato sauce. Add salt to taste!

I made this tonight and it was a major hit!! I used diced tomatoes instead of the salsa and rice instead of breadcrumbs and omitted the milk. It was fabulous!! I also added a bit of chopped cilantro to the meatballs and some to the soup when it was done. Definitely making again!

I really thought hubby wouldn't like it, but I was wrong. I did exactly as stated. Then I cooked some rice and added some at the last minute. My idea was to add a little bit of starch so Hubby wouldn't want loads of buttered bread to go with it. It worked! Next time I think I will add some garlic to the meatballs and some celery to the soup. Since it's  what I had on hand I used lower sodium beef broth instead of water and boulion cubes. I liked it too and I will make it again. Made again tonight, this time I added 1/2 tea of garlic powder and 1/2 teas paprika also 2 stalks of chopped celery. Loved it again.

Easy to make. Very good, my family loved it and I will definitely make this again. I did not use salsa, instead I used 1 can petite cut diced tomatoes. I added cilantro to the meatballs and to the soup. I think 1 1/2 lbs. Ground beef is alot for the amount of broth. Next I make this I'll use less ground beef.

Perfect Albondriga soup  :p  Deeeeelicious! When preparing the meatballs I added breadcrumbs and some chopped up cilantro .  Only thing I added to the boiling pot of goodness is celery and extra diced tomatoes (after I added the meatballs in to cook) I also added more cilantro.

This was a simple and yummy soup! I added a little more water, an extra bouillon cube and a bay leaf to make a bit more broth since there were plenty of meatballs. I also used one large sweet potato instead of the two small white potatoes. My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I would certainly make it again! Although, I will probably cook the meatballs in the oven first.

I have made this a number of times, exactly as written, and it is wonderful every single time. Needs no substitutions whatsoever. Really great with Trader Joe's Garlic Chipotle salsa.

I realize my changes change everything so I am stating up front that I made changes and my rating is not based quite on the original recipe ~ we have a son who has food allergies so I substituted the breadcrumbs for cooked rice and added some dried oregano, onion, salt, chili powder,  Italian seasoning and cilantro to the meatball mixture;I substituted chicken broth for the milk;  I make my own broth and only had chicken broth on hand so used that; and I added celery to the soup because I try to get extra veggies in when I can.  This turned out phenomenal and will make it again.

I used this recipe as a jumping off point as I was cleaning out the fridge and had many odds and ends to use up.  For the vegetables I used leeks, celery, carrots and parsnips, which I sauteed in olive oil. I then added half of a jar of salsa, half of a jar of Barilla Tomato & Basil sauce, 1 can of Rotel Cilantro and about 4 cups of water. For seasoning I used pepper, garlic, onion powder, garlic powder, cumin, salt free taco seasoning, oregano and salt free beef Herbox. I baked my meatballs for 15 minutes at 400 degrees then added to the soup. For the meatballs I used 2 heaping tbsps of Panko, 1 heaping tbsp salsa and the seasonings from above. I added a squirt of lime juice and served over rice. We really enjoyed this soup.

Easy to follow recipe, came out exactly as described. The broth is delicious, savory and, if you add a salsa with heat, spicy. The vegetables and meatballs balance out the spice, though you could season the meat with spices of your choice if you prefer it a little spicier.

I loved this soup. I added basil, Worcestershire sauce and garlic salt to the meatball. I used beef broth instead of water and served it with my favorite cheddar drop biscuits. This soup is perfect for a rainy day.

I also mixed wild rice,chopped onions,garlic and cilantro in the meatballs then brown them before adding them to the boiling broth. Then 30 minutes later I add chopped cabbage (green) to the soup. I also make frybread to go with the soup.

Made this this evening and it was great !  Read reviews and added to what was already good. I am a major cook and know how to roll with the punches and stay on the same page as the original recipe !  Had no idea what it was suppose to taste like and only had the one picture to give me an idea of what it looked like. Turned out fantastic !!! Lime juice...cilantro....wild rice mixed in the meatballs.  Delicious !!!

I made this last night and it was great... I used store made meatballs due to my feet hurt and I didn't want to stand on them anymore than I had too.. but I used carrots and potatoes like in the recipe the only thing I did different was at the end I added some tomato juice to give it more tomatoe flavor... it was great... I used lime and Cilantro at the end of the cooking just before serving up in bowls... it was spicy and warm.  we all loved it.

I want to make this minus the bouillon (which usually has MSG), breadcrumbs and milk (to make it gluten and dairy free), substituting ground turkey.  I will use beef broth, almond meal and almond or coconut milk and of course, hot salsa!

This is my go-to recipe when making albondigas. It comes out delicious every time! I typically add some of the onion & cilantro into the meatballs and use rice instead of bread crumbs, but that's about all I change. Such a delicious & filling soup.

It tweaked it a little because I didn't have all the ingredients. I substituted tomato suave for the salsa and added an egg to the meatballs. It came out pretty good.

This recipe was really close to my mother's recipe.   Instead of milk and bread, I added 1/2 cup of raw rice and two beaten eggs to help keep the albondigas together while cooking.  I also added 2 large corn husks cut in halves and 2 chayotes cut into large pieces.  It came out yummy!

Very Good Recipe but I must say I would have like it better with rice or noodles instead of the potatoes. Also taste the salsa before you put yours in mine was a little too hot even tho we bought medium. Other than that I did add some garlic,celery and spinach. I also like a soupier, soup so I added more water. Happy to have tried this and I would make again.

Amazing soup. I did modify it a bit though. Used Chicken bouillon instead of beef bouillon, no milk, and rolled rice into the meat so it cooks with it. I also didn't have salsa, but adding a small can of tomato sauce to it worked just fine. Also, I suggest adding some seasoning to the meat while rolling it with cilantro, salt & pepper work fine. Add a tiny bit of rice to the soup, not much, maybe 1/4 a cup, or it sucks up the juice. Tastes amazing!

This was good, but I used way less salsa than recipe states (medium), otherwise it would have been too hot for us. I prebaked the meatballs and drained the grease, and will add more seasoning to them next time.

Delicious, i added rice, a hot pepper and seasoned the ground beef.  I skipped the salsa and milk and didn't include the breadcrumbs. Quick, easy and delicious.  You can definitely add more veggies if that's your thing. :-)

This was good tasting and easy to make. I like the flexibility to choose how spicy it is by the salsa you choose. I used Bobby Salazar's salsa - medium spicy.
The recipe is good as is, however, I added about 1 TBS. minced garlic for my personal taste. Next time I think I will add celery.

To make  it more like my mother's version of albondigas I adjusted the recipe as follows: did not add any salsa, and added the following veggies: corn, cabbage, and mexican squash. Very authentic recipe.

I think this was a good recipe, but I do feel the meatballs needed to be seasoned a bit and the broth was a bit bland as well. I will definitely be adding a few ingredients next time for a flavor boost. But the recipe is really easy and can easily be adapted to taste.

Ok,,, so minor adjustments, since our family loves full flavor! I used chef johns meatball recipe which is also found on this site. And instead of adding meatballs to boiling broth, I browned them in olive oil, constantly shaking my Dutch oven to brown all sides as much as I can. When when they were brown, I deglazed them with wine white, a good half cup. Then I follow the recipe as written. As the other reviewers suggested, I too added some celery, only because I had on hand and white rice! Oh!!! And I used beef broth over bullion. This was hearty meal and sooooo delicious!! I served with garlic toast!! Thank you

Excellent soup!  The chopping takes some time, but it is a simple, fairly fail-proof recipe.  I tweaked it a bit, doubling the salsa, using low sodium beef broth with the bullion cubes instead of water, and cooking the carrots for 10 minutes longer / earlier than the rest of the ingredients.

This came out ok but a little bland for my tastes.  It also took a long time for my meatballs to cook through (doubled cooking time).  I will, however try this again with modifications.

This was my second time cooking from scratch. Probably due to my inexperience, this recipe took 3 hours out of an advertised 1, including all prep. I had to make some tweaks to make it more zesty, too, but this recipe turned out SO well, and I WILL be making it again.

Thanks for submitting!

This has become a favorite at our house and definitely has its spot on our list of comfort foods! The only changes I made were to add a can of chopped tomatoes and a couple of sliced celery stalks for some extra freshness. If I don't serve this at least once a month, my boyfriend will be sure to complain!

Very Good and very fast! As a mom to 3 little kids, this recipe was perfect. It was an easy recipe. The meatballs came out wonderful. I seasoned them a little with onion powder, adobo and garlic powder. Family enjoyed it. My kids loved the meatballs.

My nine year old son made this soup for dinner - with supervision of course! It was fantastic served with crusty bread. For those that have never had Albondigas before, I would describe it as a vegetable soup with meatballs and a little kick. A few minor changes were made just to accommodate what we had available. First, he used a quart of low sodium broth in lieu of the water and bouillon cubes called for. Second, I also had him use mild salsa so that it wasn't too spicy. I told him you can add spice but once it's in, you can't take it out. It turned out to be a good call. The heat level was perfect for my five year old and those that wanted more could just add extra salsa in their bowls. And finally, he only used 1 pound of ground beef (same amount of breadcrumbs and milk) because that is what was thawed and it still seemed plentiful.

Too bland for my tastes the way written. I added a small can of spicy v8 juice, hominy, and rice. Seasoned to taste with salt, pepper, and hot sauce. Next time I will add some more spices while cooking.

Easy, tasty, and fast to make. I made this in a rush before starting work and I'm so glad I did. I wonder if the meatballs could stand being cooked on low in a crockpot? I might have to try it out just to see.

Really enjoyed this.  The soup had a surprisingly good flavor considering the minimal spices in it.  But next time I would spice up the meatballs a little, I thought they were a somewhat bland.  I reduced the cooking time a bit too because the meatballs didn't need 20 minutes.  Good, quick week night meal, thanks for sharing!

This was wonderful.  I had frozen beef gravy left over from last weeks crock pot roast.  I used that for my soup base.  I added the potatoes and carrots as directed.  I didn't have any hamburger so I made the meat balls out of hot spicy breakfast sausage and this soup turned out amazing.   I will definitely make again.

Yummy.  Only as spicy as you want it to be.  Just watch the salsa type you use - or add chilis to compensate.  Super easy bc the meatballs are cooked right in the soup.

I am in love with this recipe!  I'm still learning how to cook, and this soup was easy and delicious and filling!  I added two stalks of celery, a can of stewed seasoned tomatoes, and 1/2 tsp. each of cumin and cayenne to the broth.  I also added some chopped cilantro and 1/2 tsp. of cumin to the meatballs.  I had to be careful getting all the meatballs in, if you stir too much they'll break easily, but you don't have to move it much to get them cooked through once it's covered.  I can't wait to make it again!

This turned out wonderful! It was full of flavor! I agree, if you say it's bland, it would be because of your salsa. I used a can of already seasoned diced tomatoes. It was very filling, and came back for seconds. Will be making this again and again!

Great recipe.   I make some modifications based on what I had and it worked out great.   I used chicken bouillon instead of beef, and a 14 oz can tomatoes and a chopped seeded jalapeno instead of salsa (add this stuff at the end when cooking the meatballs).   The jalapeno made it nice and hot, don't think kids or Midwesterners would like it this hot.   I added some chopped celery.  I also removed the cooked vegetables from the broth while cooking the meatballs to prevent overcooking.... Yumcakes!

Bland.  I added can of chipolte sauce, and added cumin, garlic and chili powder to the meatballs.  More flavorful with those additions.  Added avacados and fresh lemon for garnish.

Yum! Add a little cumin and garlic powder, use pre-made meatballs, and give yourself more like 45 minutes to let it simmer, and you got yourself one easy and delicious meal. I think I'll add another potato next time. THANKS!

This is a super easy recipie and makes a lot.  I used a box of beef broth and frozen meatballs.... and it turned out great.  I added spinach and rice, kind of the mexican version of Italian wedding soup.  Will be added to my recipie rotation, especially for a cold day/night!

My husband wanted me to rate it, because he loved it so much! I did use the medium salsa and it turned out spicy enough, so I didn't add any additional paprika or Cajun. I did add diced tomatoes and i decided to add fresh green beans - which were a great addition to the vegetables in the soup.  would definitely prepare it again!

It's a good soup.  I too thought it could use maybe a little more flavor to make it more intersting.  I added a dash of cayenne and paprika in addition to lots of salt and pepper and will try even more next time.  I didn't simmer the initial ingredients as long as suggested and I will do it even less last time as I am not a fan of mushy potatoes and carrots.

Excellent soup and easy to make.  I made this for a company snack day.  I doubled the recipe and there was nothing left.  The only changes that I made was using beef broth and premade meat balls.

I thought this was absolutely delicious. I used medium salsa and it was more than spicy enough (but I have a low tolerance anyways). I did as many other reviewers suggested and added spices and chopped cilantro to the meatballs prior to shaping them. Frankly, they could've used even MORE seasoning so don't be shy on salt. Used the bouillon cubes and it was great. I wish there was a way to make the meatballs more brown/crispy -- they were very light (in color). Its in my friedge and I look forward to eating more tonight! Highly recommended.

5 Stars from me.  If pressed for time (like I was) use a bag of frozen meatballs and vegetables and put into the crock pot.  It came out great.

Yummy recipe!  I cheated on the meatballs because I was sick and needed an easy way out, so I added Costco meatballs.  They were good.  The only thing I want to try next time is to add rice to the meatballs instead of bread crumbs.  My mom always made albondigas growing up and I think the rice is delicious and more authentic.

It was a good recipe.  It reminded me of a kicked up slow cooker meat/potatoes/carrots.  Might add some cumin and a can of ro-tel next time to kick it up a notch.

I have three kids 8,10 and 12 and ALL of them wanted seconds!  What a great dinner that can be made with stuff that I have on hand.  Next time I will double this recipe.  I also used a box of beef broth instead of cubes. DELICIOUS!

Gluten FREE!  This recipe was super easy and not an expensive meal to make!  Buy your gluten free bread crumbs and go to town.  It is truly a great recipe no need to add anything else unless you want to pay more than necessary.  The only think I added was a pinch of salt which I'm not sure it needed that.

My husband and I would give this three and a half stars. Next time I may add some of the spices others recommended, or try a different salsa. I love all the fresh veggies, and this is an easy recipe to put together. Thank you for sharing.

My hubby loved this dish.  I used a spicy salsa and it added a zesty kick.  It was even better when eaten for lunch the next day.  The name of the dish scared me but I'm glad I tried it.  It's easy to make, has great flavor, and is perfect when you're short on time.

This soup was very good.  The only problem I had was the same as another reviewer.  There wasn't enough liquid.  I added two cans of beef broth and another small can of Herdez salsa.  It was very good.  Had a little kick to it from the salsa.  I also added some frozen corn and celery.

I realized the day I was going to make this I didn't have the bouillon cubes so I substituted one envelope dry onion soup mix for both the bouillon and the onion.  While it was simmering my husband apparently went in for a sample because he stomped back into the living room with some meat on a fork and said "you HAVE to make this every week."  We have a winner.  I don't think I'll try it the "right" way now that it's gone so well with the sub.  Also, I use the Herdez brand salsa, Mild, that Walmart sells.  Tried it with another brand at my parents and was just not the same.  I've tried with all beef and with half beef/half turkey and we liked the combo better.  THANKS for this recipe!

Tasty, but a bit too spicy with medium salsa. Next time I'll try 1/2 mild salsa and 1/2 medium salsa. I substituted beef broth for the water and 1 pound ground bison for the beef. Also used only 1/2 as much onion as called for. Easy, balanced meal to make with items I usually have on hand. We'll be having this one again.

AWESOME recipe - tastes very dang close to the way my gramma makes it. i made this almost 100% to the directions - a few minor changes - like I added a couple cloves of garlic (cut in half) and I added a little chopped onions to the meatballs. i also did 2 cups of low sodium chicken broth, 2 cups of water and one bullion cube. i added some salt and pepper. i'll probably opt for mild salsa instead of hot next time (I thought the spice would get diluted, but it didn't...it was SPICEY...but great!). i'm taking away one star due to the meatballs needing more flavor. Not sure how to add that, but maybe some minced garlic...

Followed this recipe to a T. It was okay but don't think I'd be making it again. It came out too bland. Thanks anyway.

there is a litlle something I can describe that makes this soup quite extraordinary. I usually omit putting potatoes in a soup for they tend to get pasty but I must say I enjoyed the potatoes in this soup , it must be the magic salsa that makes all the difference, I highly reccomend !

So easy and quick! I was out of beef boulion so I used fresh garlic, parsley and mrs dash southwest seasoning. It was good with a mild flavor. My 16 year old ate two bowls, thats a miracle! The meat balls were a little too bland for me but it might be because of the lack of beef boulion. Also, I must have cut my carrots too thick because they didnt cook as well as the potatos. I  definately recommend this recipe.

This was good.  Be careful with the type of salsa you choose!  I did think the meat was a little bland which is why i gave it only 4 stars.

It's got a good flavor, and my husband loves it and he's  not a "soup" person.

I used frozen meatballs though, instead of making them, and I made sure they were unthawed befor I put them in with the other ingredients.  That makes this recipe even faster.

My boyfriend and I thought this recipe was pretty good.  Instead of using bread crumbs, I used  crushed saltine crackers.  Also, I think I'll only used 1/4 of the onion next time.  Also, Initially it didn't have quite enough flavor, and since I used the last of my beef bouillon, I added a few packets of beef flavoring from some ramen noodles (did not add the noodles).  And last but not least, I added a can of chopped tomatoes and a can of corn. This was best served with corn bread (I made corn muffins).  Also, just to let others know:  It might be just becasue i added a few extra ingriedients, but it made about 10-12 full bowls of soup.  We had left overs for days.  i think it was actually better the second time around because I was able to remove the solidified fat after it had been refridgerated.

yum, what a delicious soup! i made this recipe almost as directed, tossing in a handful of extra veggies (as recommended by several reviewers). it was a cinch to drop the raw meatballs into the broth, i loved not having to cook them ahead of time! newman's own medium salsa gave this dish a full but not too spicy flavor. i also sprinkled in about 1/2 tsp. dried cilantro before the simmering process to make up for the lack of the fresh variety. we thought this soup tasted wonderful as a leftover too! thanks for the keeper, belen!

Very good soup, a real plus to throw in any leftover vegetables you might have on hand.  Just spicy enough, and it made enough meatballs to keep everyone happy.

This soup was really good but a bit too hot because I used hot salsa.  Also next time I will use only 1 lb. meat.

not exactly what I was expecting, but good none the less.  I added some green pepper as well and only used about 1/2 of what it called for for ground beef and there were still plenty of meatballs

The flavor of this soup was fine - it really just tasted to us like a spicy vegetable beef soup.  I found the proportions to be off - I had way too many meatballs and not enough veggies (and that was even after I added extras like zuicchini).  It reheats well, but the second day there was almost no broth and no veggies left - just meatballs.  This was fine for a change - we all ate it (including my two elementary-aged kids), but I will probably not make it again.

This was very good, and the salsa gives it just a little kick. I used Mild salsa and it was perfect. I will definitely make this again.

Very good.  Easy, tasty.  We used chicken stock instead of water/beef boullion. It was a great sinus opener!  It did taste a lot like our usual salsa, so next time I might try a different type of salsa with a more distinct flavor.
