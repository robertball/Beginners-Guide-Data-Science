Made this for a party last night and everyone screamed for more!  The only change I think I would make next time is to change the topping to the prepared stuffing mixed with a little butter as suggested by another reviewer.  Making the crumb topping from the recipe was just too much work and I even think it made the chicken looked dried out.  I brushed some butter on top right before serving to give it some "glisten".  Other than that, the flavor was excellent.  I made them in the morning, put them in a baking dish lined with non-stick Reynolds Wrap and popped them in the oven to cook while I was serving appetizers and drinks. I served each breast on top of a bed of cooked fettucine noodles which I had sauteed in olive oil and seasoned with garlic salt & parsley flakes.
As a side, I stir-fried (again in garlic oil) a mixture of strips of green, red and yellow peppers, sugar snap peas, tiny baby carrots and baby portabella mushrooms and seasoned them with salt and just a little cayenne pepper and ginger.

I have been cooking since I was 6, so aren't many recipes I don't make "improvements" on, and this one was no exception. 
For starters, medium is too high of a heat setting for sautee'ing the garlic. It will burn. You need to put the heat to medium low, and use 2 tbsps oil. After the garlic, spinach and green onion was sautee'd and removed from the pan, I added the mushrooms, but seasoned them with 1/8 tsp garlic salt w/ parsley, 1/8 tsp garlic pepper, and 1/8 tsp onion salt. They had a distinct marinaded flavor.
When mixing the feta cheese mixture, I increased the sour  cream to 1 cup, because it was too dry without it, and I wanted the mixture to be smoother so the flavors would combine and the cheese would melt some when cooked instead of making the mix clumpy.
The bread coating I changed completely. I used 2 cups italian style bread crumbs, 1/2 cup of shredded parmesan/romano/asiago cheese blend and 1/8 tsp seasoned pepper blend.
When I served this, it was gone in record time. I even had a picky-eater 5 year old visiting that cleaned her plate. I had some filling left over, so I put it in the fridge and then took it to my in-laws' house for their Easter party. I threw it in a bowl and microwaved it, and it made an AMAZING dip when served with Tostito's Scoops. It was gone in 5 minutes. Thanks so much for the key ingredient combinations! You gave me the means to concoct my own something special. I will be making this often, and definately if I have company coming!

This recipe not only tasted great, but it also came out looking great too! I made it strictly following the recipe the first time and loved it, but it does take a while to make. The second time I made it, I used some shortcuts, and it came out just as great. First, instead of making the bread crumb topping, I used a prepackaged cornbread stuffing (Pepperidge Farm), made it according to the package directions, and then patted a thin layer over the chicken before baking. Instead of precooking all the ingredients for the "perfection", I simply used thawed frozen spinach, canned mushrooms (the no salt added kind), and just didn't bother precooking the onions and garlic before mixing with the feta/sourcream. Also, instead of premarinating the chicken, I just poured a little Italian dressing over the chicken after stuffing and adding to the pan (just make sure and not add a lot). Since the ingredients weren't warm before placing in the chicken this way, I left out the freezer part all together. Doing this cut the prep time down from an hour to about 10 minutes  - and there was very little taste difference! As a side note, I did have to cook my chicken a good bit longer than 25 mintues in order to get the chicken completely cooked - more like 45 minutes (but then the breasts I used were rather thick and I didn't pound them thin...just cut a slit and stuffed that way to save time). I will definitely make this again!

I made this last night and it was incredible!  The prep work was worth it.  Like others I used bread crumbs instead of making my own and that did save a little time other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  The cook time was more like 35 minutes though.  I have some leftover "stuffing" mix and am freezing it to use another time.  I hope it holds up in the freezer! Update: I did find that the stuffing does hold up in the freezer for future use! Great stuff!!!

Wow... just, wow.  My husband and I LOVED this recipe, but as always I made some adjustments.  First (as recommended by other reviewers), I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs mixed with Parmesan cheese as the topping on the chicken.  I also coated the chicken with the breadcrumbs.  I also used about 1.5 times the garlic.

My major adjustment came in the substitution of one of the ingredients.  Instead of feta, I used goat cheese, and that's where the "WOW" came from.  If you're a fan of goat cheese, you've got to try it this way.

Thanks so much for sharing this amazing recipe - my husband and I have a new favorite dish! Update - I served the "stuffing" as a dip at a party and my guests went nuts for it.  Thanks again!

This is a very tasty recipe that presents well and is fairly easy to make. For the filling mixture, I used ricotta cheese and yogurt (because that's what I had on hand) instead of feta and sour cream. Freezing the mixture for a while just makes it easier to spread, but you might not need to wait the whole 30 minutes. Others have mentioned that the chicken needs longer than 25 minutes to cook, but if you take the time to pound the breasts flat first before rolling them (this step takes about 2 minutes and creates a really professtional-looking result. I put the chicken in a plastic bag and pound it with an empty wine bottle -- works like a charm!), you shouldn't need to add any cooking time.

For the topping, I happened to have some homemade seasoned breadcrumbs in the fridge, but I would highly recommend using packaged breadcrumbs or stuffing mix, it will save you a lot of time. 

The only thing I would change next time around is the Italian dressing marinade. I don't think it added much flavour (except salt). Next time I think I'll try a simple oil/garlic/herb marinade.

This is a great dish for company! I served it with swiss chard and caramelized onions, and oil & garlic pasta.

Excellent. I passed on marinating the chicken breasts. For the breadcrumb mixture I used one half cup of bed crumbs; one half cup of parmesan cheese; 1/8 tsp pepper and 1 tbsp of italian seasoning. This was more than sufficient for nine chicken breasts. I basted the chicken breasts with melted butter before sprinkling the bread crumbs. I found two tbsps of sun-dried tomatoes more than sufficient. I also added half a minced shallot to the stuffing and cooked all of the vegetables together. I found a lot of liquid in the baking dish when I rmeoved the chicken from the oven. Be prepared to quickly transfer chicken to a platter on removal from oven. 

Enjoyed by all. I will be doing this recipe again and again.

Now that I've made this recipe my own, it is my go-to for company. I've made it simpler because I don't actually stuff the chicken. Instead I make plenty of the stuffing mixture and spread it on the bottom of a 13x9 and put thin-cut chicken on top of it and the bread crumbs on top of that. It cuts down a lot on the prep time and you get more of the wonderful stuffing. I serve it over pasta and the extra stuffing makes a wonderful sauce.

Made this for Christmas dinner....it  truly was perfection.  The only change was leaving out the mushrooms because of family taste preferences. I also used prepackaged bread crumbs for the topping.  I cooked 9 breasts and had exactly the right amount of "perfection" for filling.  I recommend cooking in a 9 x 13 with edges because we had a lot of juice when it cooked.  Thank you so much for a fabulous christmas dinner!!!!

I made this last night and was really excited.  The stuffing tasted great before put it in the ckicken, but the final dish I did not like. I thought that every ingredient worked well together, but the Italian dressing. I will probably not make this again, but if I did I would leave out the marinade. It had enough flavor without that.

This was a huge hit with my family. I didn't make as big a deal out of preparing this dish as the instructions indicated. I used frozen chopped spinach which I microwaved right in it's package and drained. I also sauteed the spinach and the mushrooms together, let it cool a bit and just added in the cheese and the sour cream. I didn't bother with the cookie sheet either, as a bowl worked just fine in the freezer. We don't care for sun dried tomatos, so I left them out. There's nothing like fresh bread crumbs and I added in garlic and onion powders and some parsley. I then drizzled the leftover marinade over chicken just before it went into the oven. Thanks so much Pregocook for a wonderful recipe!

Tres chic!! The chicken was simply outstanding. Only three relatively minor changes. Since I make all salad dressings in this house, I never have bottled Italian dressing. I subbed a homemade vinaigrette for marinating the chicken, and left it to soak for about 24 hours. The second change was that we're not fans of sundried tomatoes, so I left them out. In the past I've put in chopped artichoke hearts in their place, which was fabulous. I've also subbed fresh peeled and seeded, chopped tomatoes, which gave a nice color contrast to the spinach. Third change was to pre-cooked the mushrooms by chopping, microwaving, and draining before incorporation in the stuffing, which sped up the process. The spinach punctuated the mix with festive bits of green. Phenomenal results, and not all that difficult to put together. This can be served confidently to your most discriminating guests, yet it's simple enough for a nice weekday dinner surprise for your family when you want to do something a little special, just "because."

I made this recipe for a date, and he said it was the best chicken he's had in his LIFE.  It was so good, that upon tasting the leftovers, my family decided it would be our Thanksgiving entree.  The prep time is worth it!

Restaurant taste w/ homemade quality.  this was an excellant recipe.  I used prepared breadcrumbs as suggested by some and roasted red peppers in lieu of sun dried tomatoes.  Very impressive.

Great recipe! For a super easy and delicious topping, combine a sleeve of crushed saltine crackers with a stick of melted butter :)

Had this tonight. So tasty. Used thin sliced chicken breasts which worked perfectly.  The only changes I made were goat cheese instead of feta, and Italian style bread crumbs instead of making my own (used 1/4 cup bread crumbs, 1/4 cup parmasean cheese with 1 tsp italian seasoning - as recommended by previous poster.).  I brushed melted butter on chicken before adding breadcrumb mixture.  I had filling left over so am defrosting 3 more chicken breasts which will get eaten over the weekend.  This can be served with pasta and salad or potatoes and vegetable.  Thanks for a great recipe, will definitely be making again.

I enjoyed this dish but, yes, made modifications. I used bread crumbs too, but none of the previous reviewers mentioned how much to use. I used 2 cups and that was too much, lots leftover. I cut the pocket in the chicken breast and stuffed it with the spinach mixture - no need for toothpicks. I like sun-dried tomatoes, but this does not need a lot of them - so use sparingly (you'll think it needs more than it does). But I have to say I gave it the 4 stars b/c of the bread crumb topping. I just didn't get it. You would be better off figuring out how to just coat/roll the chicken in it after stuffing the spinach inside. And butter on top is helpful. Overall juicy chocken, great taste/flavor. Definitely worth trying!

This was to die for!  I almost made the mistake of not freezing the filling, but I'm glad I did.  It makes for a perfect bundle with no stuffing oozing out like I've experienced with other stuffed chicken recipes.  I made the recipe exactly as it reads with no changes (and that is rare for me!)  The flavor of this dish is fabulous.  Very moist chicken, great taste from the filling and a crunchy coating.  I would definitely make this for company.  My only warning is to allow yourself the time needed to make it, a great dish to make on the weekend.  Thanks for a wonderful new recipe!

I've had this recipe saved for over a year, and finally got around to preparing it this weekend. As suspected it was absolutely delicious, with gorgeous presentation! I'll have to make it again for company. I prepared it exactly as directed, only substituting real chicken breasts for the meatless kind, which I cut in half in order to stuff. Wonderful!   As one reviewer suggested, the stuffing would make a great dip!

LOVED it with a couple of changes. I don't like feta, so I substituted for Costa Rican Turrialba cheese (it's a very fresh, moist cheese that you can only get here in Costa Rica, but I guess you could use large-curd cottage in the US) for a milder taste. I also switched the mushrooms for canned artichoke hearts. Being a family of 4, I prepared only 4 breast halves and reduced everything accordingly. I should have made all 6! My husband and children devoured it!! My 11-year old told me we had dined like royalty! The chicken comes out really tender and golden, the flavors mix perfectly. It also allows for creativity in terms of the stuffing. Will definitely make it again!

Perfect for impressing guests.  I altered the recipe a little by adding mushrooms and 1/2 cup mozzerella cheese to the stuffing.

This is an awesome recipe!  I loved it with  fire-roasted red peppers rather than the tomatoes.   Didn't have to use toothpicks as the breasts, if pounded thin enough and placed seam side down, stay together well.  I used bread crumbs like most others, and drizzled some melted butter over.  They were very well received at the dinner party I took them to and I was asked for the recipe.

Wow.  That pretty much sums this recipe up. The presentation was beautiful, the taste fantastic, and I prepared everything a few hours earlier and just stuck it in the fridge till I was ready to bake and it came out perfect.  I made some few changes just to make it easier (as many other reviewers as well) I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of making my own, normal white onions instead of green,  I also just sliced 'pockets' in the chicken (pretty much sliced it in half) and generously stuffed the chicken (I only used 4 breasts) and closed with a toothpick.  With the extra filling I had left (since I only used 4 breasts) I dropped it in balls in between the chicken and baked it as well, and it was excellent with pasta.  I brushed just a bit of butter over the breasts and sprinkled the breadcrumbs over.  I put the stuffing in the fridge (instead of the freezer) but I also don't think that's really necessary.  And I almost left out the sun-dried tomatoes (because I didn't have any) but they REALLY do make this dish special, so definitely don't leave them out!  I made a sherry-cream sauce I found on this site for pasta and served it together with the chicken.  I cooked it in a gas oven (200ºC) for 35 minutes and that was perfect.  It went over great and even kids from 3 - 8 enjoyed it!  Will definitely make again, especially for guests!

Very, very good.  Just a note that you can cook all the veggies in a small frypan together, just start the mushrooms and onions and add the spinach a few minutes later.  Cool in the pan and add the cheese, etc. there too.  Less mess.

Fantastic!  Made the marinade with the Italian Dressing Mix Recipe from this site--and subbed Olive Oil for the oil listed.  My whole family really enjoyed the stuffed chicken dish!  Per suggestions, I used 8 chicken breasts (what I had)--and used only 1/2 of the feta/spinach etc stuffing.  I saved the rest (per reviews) for a later dip!  Will definitely make again--and even sub a little mayo in place of sour cream to tone down the mild sour taste.  Thank you!

This was very good! The BF loved it! (so did my guests) Only thing I did different was used Panko Italian seasoned crumbs with the parm cheese for the topping. I also lightly pounded the chicken and butterflied it and stuffed it that way. Cooked it at 350 degrees for approx. 40-45 minutes.

I liked it a lot, my husband didn't. He's not terribly picky, but he said there were just "too many things" in it. I used the exact ingredients called for, but did use a little different technique...just to keep it simpler. I only marinated my chicken for about an hour, pounded quite thin. I cooked the garlic, spinach and green onions in olive oil, then sautéed the mushrooms. I did let the mixture cool a bit before adding it to the feta and sour cream mixture, then just put the bowl into the freezer for a few minutes. There is absolutely no need for the cookie sheet. I also didn't use toothpicks, just rolled the breasts around the filling and laid them in the baking dish. I used homemade breadcrumbs with Parm. In all, it's a dish I enjoyed, but with the lukewarm reception from my husband, I probably won't do it often.

I thought this was good and so did my husband.  We don't eat a lot of feta so the flavors in the dish was new to us.  I really enjoyed it and I will definately make it again.  Note: I didn't have oil packed sun dried tomato so I cut up several that I had in a package and I think they turned out great.

Thank you for the great recipe!

FABULOUS! I made this today for my boyfriend & I. He rated it as one of the BEST i've made! I marinated the chicken for only 20 mins. I skipped freezing the stuffing. I used 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs instead of stale bread. I also added italian seasoning to the dry mixture. I only used about 1/2 of the dry mixture - next time I will make only half the dry stuff. Cooking time was perfect! Long Bamboo toothpicks work well. The sundried tomatoes make this recipe! Great Flavor -- Thanks so much for sharing this one! Will definatley make this one for the in-laws/parents!

This was awesome!  My husband and I loved it.  I made a few changes.  I used Fat Free Zesty Italian dressing.  I also substituted Mozzarella for the Feta Cheese and Low Fat Cottage Cheese for the Sour Cream.  It was great! We usually have left overs, but I'll have to make something else tonight.  Loved it!

This took a long time to make and I was hoping it would be worth it.  It was worth it.  I changed a couple things: I used frozen chopped spinach instead of fresh, I only used a couple tablespoons of the sun dried tomatoes and instead of the bread crumbs, I used ritz & saltine cracker crumbs.  I will only make this for special occassions because it is so time consuming and a lot of ingredients.

This was great! Does take time to make and I did alter slightly. Rather than make the breadcrumbs per recipe I just sprinkled seasoned crumbs and Parmesan on top of chicken prior to putting in oven. Also added a tablespoon of pesto and couple slices of chopped bacon (pre-cooked) to the stuffing mix.

My wife and and I made this, and our friends liked it as well as we did. One change we did was not to flatten the chicken, but just butterfly the breast meat and stuffed the filling in. We also cooked it longer than the 25 minutes, but everything else was to recipe. Will make again and will try to flatten out the meat to get different results.

I really liked this but the only problem I had is that it wasn't cooking evenly.  Next time I will cut the chicken all rolled up in half (mine were pretty big-maybe I didn't pound it out enough).

I made this recipe last night for company.  Everyone LOVED it.  I made it exactly as the recipe said, using all fresh ingredients and it was delicious.  I do think next time I make this I will cut the bread crumb mixture in half though. I also made the mistake of packing the chicken roll ups too tightly in the pan so it took a lot longer to cook.  Do like the recipe says and cook on a cookie sheet with some room in between each piece.  Best chicken recipe I have ever made!!!!  A+++++++

I loved this recipe.  It was much easier than I thought it would be.  I used italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of the wheat bread.  That's the only change I made.  I didn't get a tomato in my piece; I was disappointed about that.  Next time I may chop? them up or something.  This was excellent and very elegant.  I would definately recommend it and it's not like anything I normally make.

My family loved this. I used frozen spinich instead of fresh. I also didn't use the freezer technique. I just stuffed and cooked. I also did as another review suggested and ate the left over filling as a dip with Fritos. I will do that at parties but I will omit the tomatoe. It was good but a little too tangy for a dip.

This was really good. I also cheated and used store bought bread crumbs which tasted just fine. Also sprinkled with olive oil before I baked. I used fat free sour cream and it turned out fine. Very very good and moist. I served it with some garlic mashed potatoes. Delicious!

Very good! More prep time than I'm used to but the recipe looked so delicious and I was feeling ambitious today so I went for it. Made a few changes (who doesn't?) I used store bought bread crumbs and frozen drained spinach. I also omitted the mushrooms at the last minute, we like them fine, but it just seemed like it didn't need them. The ingredients without mushrooms was enough, a perfect blend of flavors and I was afraid the mushrooms might interfere with the "perfection". As it was, I had a little stuffing left over when I filled the 6 flattened breasts to overflowing, so I mixed it with the parmesean and breadcrumb mixture before topping the chicken and baking it. It was a huge hit and I had to beat the fellas away from seconds they didn't need so we can have it again tomorrow. Thanks so much for a well written recipe which explained clearly how to do a more advanced dish!

This is my go-to recipe.  When I am having people over, I make this because I know it will be good.  And I hardly ever use all of the things listed, I use what I have out of the green onions, sun-dried tomatoes, spinach.  It is so good!  You can even use shake and bake to make it easier.

The name says it all. After baking it, I transferred the chicken to a pretty platter and placed it in the warming oven until we were ready to sit down to dinner. (Approx. an hour) It was moist and tender. I used Ricotta instead of Feta cheese and omitted the mushrooms. I used Pepperidge stuffing and pulverized it in my food processor. I did not marinate the chicken breasts ahead of time but poured the marinade on top of the stuffed chicken breasts and sprinkled a generous amount of the bread crumb mixture over it.

DEEELISH!!!!  I have been eyeing this one for some time now and finally decided to make it tonight...glad I did!  Read several reviews and here is what I did.  I was only making 2 chicken breats so all of my measurements were 'guesstimates'.  I marinated the chicken in some Kraft Zesty Italian for a few hours (did not measure).  Mixed up my light feta and light sour cream and added dry chopped sundried tomatoes.  Used frozen spinach (chopped) that I microwaved for about a minute and cooked my garlic with some sliced mini baby bella mushrooms.  Added all of this to my sour cream and feta mixture and decided to make a small pocket to stuff the mixture into the chicken breasts, it's easier than pounding/rolling and the mixture is quite substantial.  I found that I didn't need to freeze the filling.  There was some excess mixture, so I placed it on top of the breasts.  I used panko crumbs mixed with a bit of fresh parm, pepper and I actually didn't have thyme in the fridge, but had some fresh rosemary so used that instead.  Baked for about 45 mins, they were perfect.  Wonderful flavour, definitely would be a hit to serve guests.  Served this alongside Garlic Broccoli Spears (from this site).  Thanks for sharing this superb recipe!!!

Good & simple despite what many of the reviews say.  I used roasted red peppers instead of tomatoes and store bought breadcrumbs.  Next time I will marinate the chicken for much less time or maybe even not at all because it caused too much moisture to seep out during the baking process and made the bottom of the chicken soggy.  I seasoned both the chicken and spinach mixture with salt, pepper & bit of cayenne and didn't find this dish bland at all.  The finished product was moist, quite pretty, and yummy.

This was very good!  I didn't freeze the filling mixture for the full 30 minutes, it may have been easier to work with had I done that, but it didn't affect the outcome at all.  Instead of using breadcrumbs, I used seasoned cruton crumbs and parmasean cheese, and just lightly sprinkled it on the top of the chicken breasts about half-way through cooking (because I forgot it when I put them in the oven).  They turned out great, and looked beautiful.  My husband actually thought I had purchased these pre-made and tried to pass them off as my own, that's how "pretty" they were! Very moist and delicious!

This dish turned out fantastic.  The only ingredient I omitted was the sun-dried tomatoes and I substituted italian bread for the wheat bread.  I served with basmati rice.  Truly delicious.  Will make again.  Update: 3/24/10 - I made this again over the weekend and my husband almost bit into a raw piece of chicken.  Please, please cook this dish for about 40 minutes at 350 instead of only 25 minutes at 400.

The name says it all for this recipe.  Perfection!  I used the other reviewers short cut suggestions by topping the chicken with already made Pepperidge Farm Stuffing.  I used frozen spinach thawed in the microwave and drained.  Sauteed the onions and mushrooms with the garlic and mix with the feta, sour cream, and sundried tomatoes and spinach.  Skipped the freezing part.  This recipe was thoroughly enjoyed by all.  Even teenage boys loved it!

This was a very good recipe! 

The only thing that I will do differently next time is add less sun-dried tomatoes. Other than that this recipe was excellent!

What a delicious recipe! My girlfriend and I tried one night when our husbands and boys were on a camp out. We decided to treat ourselves to something YUMMIE. Boy did I pick a winner. The flavors were as wonderful as the aroma's. We did not use the bread crumbs. We just baked it in a little lemon and butter. Just perfect. I also added a few table spoons of cream cheese to the stuffing. I will be doing this again soon!!

Spectacular!!! I loved it and so did my roommates. It is a bit pricey for all the ingredients, but it is way worth it. I made it with smothered green beans, and garlic mashed potatoes. Will definitely make this again.

I served this fabulous recipe for some company (family), and I received a lot of compliments. It was very flavorful! I followed the recipe exactly except for the topping; I took others' advice and used prepared bread crumbs. Also, I didn't see the point in freezing the spinach mixture, but I did it anyway. It also took longer than 25 minutes to bake. Thanks for a great chicken recipe!

I suggest using prepared breadcrumbs.  Since I don't like feta, I used mozzerella instead and used Italian seasoning in place of thyme.  It was so incredibly yummy!  It does take longer to bake than the recipe suggests but you don't need to freeze it for the full 30 minutes.

I made this for dinner last night, and I have to say, it was just all right. The flavor was really nice, but for some reason it was really salty, which kinda ruined it for me. I may make it again, but cut back on the fetta cheese and see if that makes any difference. I had really high hopes for this dish, and unfortunatly they wern't met. Maybe better luck next time.

I skipped the sun-dried tomatos because I don't like them (and I didn't have them on hand), and this recipe was still great.  I had left over feta-spinach stuffing which I spread and toasted on top of flatbread as an appitezer- yum.  The stuffing is so good, I will make it alone to serve a dip with triangles of pita or flatbread.

Fantastic!!! So far I have tried quite a few recipes on here and only rated one.  I was starting to think something was wrong with me when others rated recipes so high and I found them to be fairly bland.  Not with THIS ONE.  Prep did take a while and I found that I had left over filling (perhaps my fillets were smaller)  next time I will use any filling left over, bread it and cook it.  More importantly  the whole family loved it and to get both of the twins to love a meal is nigh on impossible.  Sorry for going on but I was begining to despair.

This recipe was a hit at our house. I didn't have time to marinate the chicken and used panko bread crumbs, but otherwise stayed true to the directions - thank goodness we had all ingredients on hand. This one's a keeper! Thanks for posting. :)

This was really yummy! I,like others, used store bought breadcrumbs & cut a pocket in the chicken to stuff it. Omitted the mushrooms. But made it the same otherwise. The filling looked yummy enough to eat by itself! I will be making it again!
 Just made this again tonight, per my 12 yr. old sons request. Just as yummy. My FIL had a good idea. Next time I am going to try cooking the chicken & shredding it & mixing it in with the filling. Maybe serve it with pasta or some flatbread to roll it in. That way we can get an even better mix of the chicken & filling!

I understand why this recipe is rated so highly - it's a great blend of flavors.  However, I'm sensitive to salty dishes and this one is too salty for me due to the feta and parmesan.  Other than that it's great.

I LOVED this recipe, as did my family! To make the stuffing a little healthier I used nonfat feta and nonfat plain Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream, and it still tasted wonderful. I didn't bother with the cookie sheet/freezing part for the stuffing; I just let it cool a little and stuck it in the fridge until I needed it--no problem! In the future I may not use a whole Italian dressing for the marinade--I think a homemade concoction of oil, vinegar, fresh garlic & Italian spices would be just as delicious. I will absolutely be making this again - it's a keeper!

This was great!  The only changes I made were to switch out the feta and sour cream for fat-free versions, and to use readymade bread crumbs.  I also halved the bread crumb mixture, and it was still more than enough.  Next time, I might reduce the amount of sun-dried tomatoes, or switch to the dried version, instead of oil-packed.  The family thought the flavor of those was a little overwhelming.  We had leftover stuffing, and I'm going to use it tonight, spread on top of turkey cutlets.  It might be an easier option for a quick weeknight meal.

These are fantastic! I did change the bread crumb topping. Instead of using stale bread, I used a mix of panko crumbs, Italian bread crumbs, and fresh grated Parmesan. I also cut the breasts up the middle instead or rolling them. I will be making this again and again!

We loved this.  I made it without mushrooms since I do not like them.  The other alteration I made was I used Italian Seasoned Breadcrumbs, dried garlic and shredded parmesan on top.  
I had extra filling, so I sauteed and added more spinach to the extra filling and served it on top of linguine as a side dish.  I will definitely make this again.

These were very good, but I think for all the prep and fiddling with rolling up the chicken, I would rather just have a sauce with all the ingredients. Maybe I feel that way because mine were not pretty, I had to use three toothpicks in each roll to keep them closed...Or maybe I will do what some others have done and just cut a pocket and shoved the stuffing in that way...

This was awesome. I have never rated a recipe before, but I have never gone wrong using this site before. I made this on Christmas eve and received RAVE reviews! I then froze the leftovers and they reheated beautifully. Very moist and delicious. I didn't pound the chicken very thin, so I knew it would take longer to cook, but trying to time the rest of my meal kept the chicken in a bit longer than I planned, and it was still delicious. I cooked them for one hour. The only change I made was using the prepared bread crumbs. I will definitely make this again.

This chicken was absolutely delish! Left out the sun dried tomatoes as I didn't have any, and the mushrooms as I had already used them for stuffed mushrooms, and it still came out amazing :) (Of course I added a couple extra garlic cloves as we are garlic fanatics!!) Making it again tonight, definitely a pleaser! Thank you!!

Made this for my boyfriend and his brother who are both very picky eaters. They LOVED IT. Ask me to make it all the time. Then his mom tried the left overs and said it was AMAZING. Everyone who has had this dish is very impressed. The leftover stuffing freezes well to make a second (smaller) batch. Can put the stuffing on other stuff too it's so good. I am a beginner cook, and this was easy and well worth the effort!

We made this last night for dinner, DB and myself just loved it.  It looked very nice and had great flavor.  I followed the recipe except I left out the onions (DB is allergic) and mushrooms (didn't have any on hand).  Also, I marinaded the chicken overnight in a tomato basil vinagrette.  I used bread crumbs, italian seasoning and parmesan for the crust.  This was so good, I will keep the recipe around for future use!

When I found this recipe I got very excited. Despite the fact that I did not have most of the ingrediences and tried to make them up myself - it was delicious. I can imagine that when done according the original recipe it rocks! (I made my breadcrumbs mixing plain breadcrumbs, parsley, salt, peper and parmesan. Instead of goat or feta cheese I cut tiny cubes of mozzarela cheese and mixed it with sour cream. I also did not have Italian dressing so I made my own following one of the recipes posted on All recipes) As a side dish I recommend Red Garlic Potatoes posted by MARDI1030. It went perfectly together. If you have kids that like canned fruit - try to serve it with tangerines :-) Yummi

Very good! My husband is super picky and even he said it was 5 stars. My 2.5 year old loved it too. Will definitely make it again! Might try a half batch next time though since this made a ton of food. Ended up being more like 12 servings.

This recipe is great! Wonderful flavors. I did end up with more stuffing than I could use for 4 breasts, so I simply froze the remaining to use later! Perfect!

This was an excellent stuffed chicken recipe. The only changes I made were to marinade the chicken in Greek salad dressing (I thought with feta cheese, Greek dressing would be a nice compliment) and drizzle melted butter over the crumbs before baking, this way it gets crispy and stays moist. Thanks for sharing such a yummy dish!

This was an absolutely awesome dish! I only made a few changes: I used less feta and added some cream cheese because 1 1/2 cups feta can be expensive, I used a package of frozen spinach, which is much cheaper and I used a yellow onion instead of green onions.  Everyone raved about it!

This recipe was awesome. I prefer to use the baby bella precut mushrooms. I just used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs. The second time I made it I also omitted the Parmesan cheese. My husband and son preferred it. They said it was not quite as rich and it cut back on the extra calories.

I doctored this recipe quite a bit the first time I made it and it was excellent. I am still bragging on how good it turned out. I only used 4 chicken halves cause I was cooking for two. I used Progresso bread crumbs instead of homemade ones and mixed in some parmesan cheese. For the filling, I used Italian cheese and grated Parmesan instead of feta mixed with the sour cream. I left out the mushrooms and tomatoes too. I did not have to freeze this mixture as it was pretty thick and handled well. When I filled the chicken breasts, I didn't roll them, when I cut them in half I made the top part thin so I could just fill it on the thicker half and cover it with the thin half and toothpick them together. It did come out some while cooking but for the most part stayed intact. I didn't do any measuring, I went off of sight, but it was close to 2/3 of the recipe amount.

THANK YOU for making me look soooooo good!!!  My guests called me a Martha Stewart Prodigy! Ok, these do take a while but there are a few easy shortcuts. #1 Use a pkg of frozen spinach thawed & drained. #2 Use Panko bread crumbs (awesome tasting). #3 use 1 cup of sour cream (too dry without it). I served with linguini stirred with garlic, olive oil and parsley and chopped veggies lightly stirfried (zuchini, orange pepper, sugarsnap peas). You will look good with this recipe - THANK YOU!

I have made this several times and my whole family loves it!  I skip the marinade and just season the pounded chicken with Italian spices.  I use frozen spinach and a sun-dried tomato basil pesto that is yummy.  I just mix the filling in one bowl with no cooking and this makes it fast and easy.  For the bread crumbs, I use a ready made herb stuffing mix and put a few pats of butter on top.

I made these a couple of nights ago, and both my husband and I loved them. I didn't have any sun-dried tomatoes, and for some reason I completely forgot about the green onions (found them on the counter after dinner, oops), but they were still fantastic! I was really pressed for time, so instead of flattening and rolling the chicken breasts, I put them in a casserole dish, covered them with the cheese/sour cream/spinach mixture and sprinkled the breadcrumbs over top. Baked for 25 minutes and broiled to brown the breadcrumbs...perfection! I've already put them on next week's menu.

This recipe is wonderful!  I made a few minor changes in the preparation such as chopping the mushrooms and spinich in the food processor to make the filling a little more creamy and I used sundried tomato and basil feta cheese instead of plain.  I used this for a monthly cook off and won!  No suprise there - this chicken ROCKS!

What a delicious recipe! Don't let the lengthy list of ingredients and instructions scare you, you can streamline this is many ways. I used Panko crumbs rather than homemade. I think it makes for a crispier outside texture. Cooking time is minimal if you pound the breasts to 3/8 inch before rolling them. Thanks for sharing this outstanding recipe.

This was incredible and impressive!  It did feel like we ordered the best chicken recipe at the best restaurant!  The only thing I will do differently next time is use a little less of the sun-dried tomatoes.  Otherwise, it was perfect!

This recipe is amazing!  I used 7 breasts, left out the green onions, used 2 can spinach drained and squeezed well.  I also used italian style bread crumbs and once on top the chicken lightly sprayed with pam.  No freezing. I added oregano on top of the chicken before putting the bread crumb mixture on.  And last, I used sun dried tomatoes that were not packed in oil to cut down the fat content, and fat free italian dressing in which I did not use the whole bottle.  Marinated for 1 1/2 hours. Has a better presentation than the pictures provided. Thanks so much for sharing! And no, it is NOT bland!  You must have done something wrong.  Full of flavor.

The only mistake I made with this recipe was not forseeing our guests would want seconds! Absolutely delicious. It did take a bit of extra time to put together, but it was well worth the effort. I marinated the chicken in the fridge overnight and, as others did, served it with pasta in a light sauce of olive oil, garlic, and parsley flakes.
I also made a small dish for my vegetarian daughter in which I used tofu instead of chicken and she loved it.

I will definitely make this again.  I followed the recipe except I used melted butter and Panko for the breadcrumb part.  This dish made a great presentation.  I will definitely be making this for company.  The cook time was perfect for me.  I did flatten the breasts since they were kind of thick.

Terrific recipe! I skipped marinating the chicken and didn't coat the breasts with bread crumbs.  Didn't really get why this recipe would need these extras with so many flavours going on in the filling. I agree with Stromovitch's suggestion and cooked all the veggies together in the pan.  I saved a bunch of time (and calories) and ended up with a gourmet meal that was super quick and easy!

This was fabulous...it perfumed the house while cooking, and got raves from my guests.  Mine took about 15 minutes  longer to cook than the recipe called for.  Instead of tearing up bread, I used panko crumbs, which gave a great crunchy topping.  Thanks for a great recipe; my chef's cache has gone up a notch with this dish.

I made this for dinner tonight and it was FANTASTIC.  I didn't have Feta, so I used some store bought "dill dip", adding a little bit of prepared bread crumbs so it wouldn't be too watery.  I also used prepared crumbs for the topping, instead of making my own.  I marinated the chicken in a balsamic vinegar dressing.  I will make this dish again.

This is very good!  I think that I didn't pound out the chicken enough because it took a little longer to get done.  Very good.  This will impress the in-laws!

I made this recipe with kale since there is no fresh spinach available because of the e coli problem.  I haven't had it with spinach, but it was delicious with kale!

This was good.  Nice tasting, the spinach, sun dried tomatoes and feta was a good combo.  My picky son didn't like the filling.  The chicken did cook up nice an moist.  I  did put a little bit of melted butter on top of the bread crumb mixture, and then hit it with a spray or two with PAM.  Served with baked potatoes and corn.  I will make again.  I would say this is good enough to serve to company.  Thanks for the post!

My husband who is a solid "MEAT AND POTATOE MAN" loved this dish.  I was on the edge of my seat waiting for his response.  After the first bite he was impressed and happy for the change. I will make this again and again.

This was one of the best stuffed chicken recipes I've made.
A few steps but was end result was amazing.
The best part ,I made it ahead and placed it in the fridge and baked later for my guests

Didn't have the feta cheese or the mushrooms, but without these two ingredients this was still really good! I will be making this again as my husband loved it too. This chicken would be great to serve at a dinner party too.

Wow, this was really incredible.  I only had two chicken breasts and no sun dried tomatoes, so had to tweak just a bit.  Not much moisture left in pan after sautéing garlic and spinach, so I added a tad of butter to the mushrooms which I chopped instead of slicing.  I thought the smaller pieces worked better for rolling up.  Butter added a nice complimentary flavor.  Added a couple chopped marinated artichoke hearts instead of tomato.  Fantastic!  Thanks, pregocook.  Can't wait to make more!

This recipe is nearly perfect! It was a hit with the whole family. I made some adjustments, adding sliced grape tomatoes and bell peppers in place of mushrooms (which no one at my house will eat) that added some colour and better texture to the insides of the stuffed chicken! These both paired well with feta cheese. I served with bowtie pasta, will make again!

I made this dish the same day I came across this recipe.My husband and I absolutely loved it. He finished his and actually tried to take a bite of mine. I had all the ingredients on hand except for the Feta cheese, so I used Mozarella instead. The finished product was beautiful to look at as well as delicious. I look forward to making this dish for family and friends. I know it's a winner and will certainly be my "Go to dish" while entertaining.

So, I know I shouldn't review a recipe that I changed but it was freaking delicious. I only had 4 chicken breasts but they were really big. I cut them in half and put them in a gallon zip lock bag with the Italian dressing and set it aside while I was cooking.  I used frozen spinach and I didn't use mushrooms only because my family doesn't like them. Also, I didn't role the chicken I just laid one chicken slice down then put a thick layer of the feta cheese mix then topped it with another chicken slice. Instead of making the breading mixture from scratch I used stove top corn bread stuffing and made it according to package directions then I packed it on top on the chicken before I stuck it in the oven. The last five minutes I topped the chicken with shredded Parmesan cheese. Finally I poured chicken gravy over the stuffed chicken before serving..... OMG... Soooo good.

I really liked this recipe.  I subbed provolone for the feta because I hate it.  I used the sour cream to add to the juices in the pan to make a sauce for the breasts. thanks for the great recipe

Good.... but it needs butter melted on the topping while baking... it was too dry. Also... ease up on the thyme or omit it, the taste was overwhelming. Other than that, the mixture in the middle was quite tasty. Nice recipe.

This recipe was great! It was a hit with family and friends. I did cut down on the prep time by using frozen spinach and skipping the freezer step. I also used italian style bread crumbs and parmesan cheese instead of messing with the bread and fresh herbs. Will add this to my favorite meal list :-)

Thanks for sharing!

A bit more work then I anticipated but well worth every bite taken! I agree with the other reviews. The bread crumbs was a bit over the top and a bit messy. Other then that this is one recipe that will impress your guests. Definitely a keeper!

This dish was a hit!  I just got married, and I used this dish as my first nice "married" meal. I substituted Italian-style croutons for the wheat bread for more flavor, and used reduced fat feta cheese.  The next time, I'll substitute fat-free sour cream to cut down on the fat.  There was too much stuffing for the amount of chicken I had, so I can cut the ingredients in half.  Also , I only marinated the chicken for 30 minutes while I prepared the stuffing.

This was fantastic!!! The only changes I made were using a little more sour cream to make the filling more moist and using chopped sweet onion instead of green onions. It was sublime! We had filling left over so we tossed it with egg noodles and served the chicken on top.

I made the recipe even easier by using "Italian-style" bread crumbs instead of homemade ones.  I also added crumbled bacon to the stuffing for an extra pop of flavor!

This was delious!  It did take me way longer than 25 minutes to cook the breasts....more like 55-60 minutes.  Maybe I didn't pound them thin enough (although I DID pound them out).  I loved it the way that it was...although my boyfriend thought that he would prefer it more without the sun-dried tomatoes...just a personal preference.  So, since they are a bit pricey anyway, I might just leave them out next time.  I didn't really think the prep took all that long, although some reviewers thought that it took a while.  I skipped the step of freezing the filling on a cookie sheet.  I just mixed it in a bowl and popped it in the freezer that way for about a half hour...and it turned out fine.  I will definitely make this again!

This was excellent! I was in the mood for making something more than a quick meal for a change and this was perfect for that.  I made it as written - except I used frozen spinach thawed & squeezed, and did not sautee onions, garlic & mushrooms so I didn't need to freeze anything before continuing.  Next time I might try dried sun-dried tomatoes instead of the type in oil, we prefer the flavor of the dried. That's the only change I'd make - maybe 5-6 slices of bread next time too - I had so much excess but that's a minor problem at least. Everyone really loved this - well worth the work in our opinion!

I made this for the first time last night and it was WONDERFUL!  My husband and I decided it was a definite keeper.  I did make a few changes though.  Instead of making my own bread crumbs, I just used store bought italian bread crumbs and added some pepper and grated parmesan.  That saved a ton of time.  I didn't do the mushrooms simply because we don't like them.  And I used white onion instead of green onion because we already had a white onion.  I just sauteed the white onion along with the garlic in some olive oil.  I also left the stuffing mixture in the bowl for about 15 min in the freezer and skipped the whole cookie sheet step.  It worked just fine.  I pounded my chicken breasts out pretty thin and they rolled up really well and presented nicely.  It made enough stuffing for at least 6 chicken breasts but I only had 4 pieces of chicken pounded out.  I just put the rest of the stuffing along the sides of the dish and then spooned it over the chicken when I served it because it is DELICIOUS!  I brushed a little bit of melted butter on the chicken before I sprinkled them with the bread crumbs so it was nice and golden.  It needed about 35 minutes instead of 25 minutes.  Turned out perfect and super yummy!  Definitely give this one a try!

This was so good.  Yes there are a lot of steps, but it is well worth it.  The only ingredient that I did not have on hand was the feta cheese.  So I substituted it with cream cheese and shredded mozzarella cheese.  Instead of frozen spinach I had fresh.  Plus I did not use as many bread crumbs as called for.  It was delicious, thx for the recipe.

2009: Not bad.  May try without the coating next time.
2015: I've made this twice in a week now, and it is sooo flavourful. I use 1c of breadcrumbs instead of the bread for best results.  Also, I use 1 brick of 185g TreStelle feta to make 1.5c.   I made it for a dinner party and it impressed everyone.   Also, I drizzled a good portion of the oil from the jar of tomatoes over the breadcrumb topping on the chicken.

Pounded chicken thin and used a Roasted Garlic vinagrette for marinade. Let sit overnight. Reduced feta and added ricotta cheese. Added finely chopped baby spinach right into the filling. Omitted mushrooms. Spread extra filling over the top before adding store bought breadcrumbs mixed with parmesan. Drizzled with melted butter. Turned out fantastic. Really impressed my dinner guests. A bit of work, but definetly something I would make again for special company.

I served this for a dinner party for 18 women, they loved it!  I butterflied the chicken so I had two smaller pieces (My store sells bionic (giant) chicken breasts)  I stuffed them and   folded them over and secured with two tooth picks. I allowed the filling to be somewhat exposed which showcased the bright reds and greens of the filling.  I did not include the mushrooms and I diced the tomatoes. I did prepare the day before adding the parmesan topping right before putting in oven.  For the topping I used italian style bread crumbs and p. cheese with a little butter for a slightly richer taste. Great!

Didn't use green onions or sundried tomatoes, used artichoke hearts instead.Was a smidge dry but we will definitely make it again and add a bit more of the oil.

Wow, this was so yummy!  REALLY flavorful and received rave reviews.  I'm not a fan of tomatoes, so I made half the stuffing with roasted red peppers, which worked VERY well (the tomato eaters enjoyed theirs equally as much).  I used a bit more sour cream and garlic than called for in the recipe.  I used a large bottle of Newman's Own Italian Dressing to marinate the chicken.  I made the bread crumbs as directed.  It wasn't difficult at all, but make sure you leave your bread out to stale it a few days in advanced, and this recipe makes a LOT more bread crumbs than you need.   I will modify that next time.  The recipe also made enough stuffing for one more chicken breast, so I will add one more breast next time.  But this time I cooked the extra stuffing on its own and it was gone by the end of the night!  Yum! [I served this with garlic mashed potatoes and Italian peas, a perfect combo!]

I was looking for something different and I found it. These are absolutely wonderful. I did pound them out slightly, and cut a pocket in the breast. Stuffed the chicken sealed with toothpicks and sprinkled the topping on top of the chicken. Baked according to the recipe.

I made this tonight and it was so wonderful.  Everyone raved over it.  I used the oil packed peppers instead of the sun dried tomatoes and they were wonderful.  I only used 4 oz of feta cheese and 1 cup of sour cream because I was a little worried about the saltiness of the recipe.  It was supurb!

My family loved this recipe without even knowing what was in it. (To avoid those "eww..i dont like feta cheese" comments) I used a box of stuffing and that did not work so well. The crumb were too big (perhaps i should have crushed them first). But a box of pre-seasoned bread crumbs would hae worked just as well.

Very delicious recipe! I have made this several times. The only change I really made is to use sun-dried tomato paste, rather than the ones packed in oil. It is easier to handle, and tastes just as wonderful! My boyfriend is not picky about what I cook, but specifically requests this recipe!

We really liked this one.  It was a little rich for my husband, thus the 4 stars instead of 5.  Leftover stuffing mixed with some sour cream makes for a tasty dip the next day.

This recipe definitely makes a lot. I recommend cutting it in half ecspecially if it is only for 2 people. I actually made 5 breasts and still had way too much sauce left over. But other than that this is very good. I had this with baked sweet potatoes, they complemented each other well i thought.

REALLY GOOD!  I used frozen spinach, seasoned stuffing mix, ground thyme - turned out great.  I skipped the freezing step and just cut the chicken breast in half making a pocket and stuffed it in.  We deemed it a "keeper" and will definitely make again.

My family and I thought this recipe was very delicious but was a bit on the salty side. Next time I will cut down on the parmesan and feta cheese, and eliminate the sun-dried tomatoes and sub for fresh tomatoes seeds removed ( otherwise it would be too watery ).

I made these for a dinner party and EVERYONE loved them!  Cooked beautifully.  I actually used chicken tenders instead of breasts.  They were a little time consuming to make, but worth it.  Everyone wanted the recipe, will definitely make again.

Recipe was very tasty.  Used pre made bread crumbs from the store.  Make sure you bake the chicken apart from one another so it cooks quicker.  It took about 30 min longer to cook than what the original recipe says.  It may be due to having the chicken next to one another.

Maybe I pounded the chicken too thin, because it was really dry.  I used goat cheese for the filling, and the combinations of flavors was amazing!  I think next time I'll use more sour cream because the filling was a bit dry too.

This recipe was awesome...cooked it for the first time last night for a couple of "foodies" -- they absolutely loved it. I used a mixture of whole wheat and white panko bread crumbs (along with the parmesan cheese, pepper, and thyme) for the bread crumbs and it turned out amazingly well. I did brush a little bit of butter on top during the last 5 minutes of baking to give it a bit of a golden color. I also used Paul Newman's family Italian dressing to marinade -- perfect! I will definitely make this again, as you can prepare it well in advance and just pop it in the oven about 30 minutes before dinner!

Delicious, I made these for a potluck, and they were gone right away.  I do have to say thought that the ingredients for the filling were a little pricy.  But the taste made up for it.

This recipe is deserving of it's name.  My dinner guests called it "gourmet".  I made it exactly as the original recipe - no changes, no exceptions.  It was worth the time it took to prepare.  I enjoyed the fact that i could make it ahead of time.  I served it with my recipe for "make ahead mashed potatoes" (made with cream cheese, sour cream and parmesan cheese) and asparagas with hollandaise sauce and crusty french rolls.  It allowed me to have a clean kitchen when my guests arrived - and time to enjoy drinks and appetizers with them.  The aroma eminating from the kitchen as it baked really triggered appetites.  I will do this one again!  Thanks.

Superb! My family always request this everytime we have potluck party! It's time-consuming but well worth the effort when I hear the compliments from family and friends. To save time I just cut the chicken breasts to thin slices and marinate it a day ahead and cooked the stuffing too.

This recipe was delicious!  Could have used less bread, parmesan, & thyme--seemed to be about 1/3 too much.  Even kids loved this when sun dried tomatoes were removed from theirs.  Hubby said that the chicken came out perfect.  I used 3 breasts and 6 thighs as hubby prefers dark meat and was wonderful.

This chicken was superb. Be sure to have tortilla chips or toasted bread to utilize the extra spinach stuffing. I froze it and used the rest to make 8 additional breasts from the 6 I made before and still had enough spinach stuffing to have a bowl full of dip.

kinda sorta followed the recipe.. 
used boxed stuffing and added stuff that I had on hand.. Little bit of fresh sage and some  leftover breakfast sausage..
plus and egg.. rolled them up in the marinated breast,, delicious... I think you can follow the basics of this recipe and stuff the chicken whatever floats your boat and it will be great...

This recipe had many steps, I can deal with that.  The sun-dried tomatoes overwhelmed all the other flavors and made it so I started picking them out just to taste the other stuffing ingredients.  IF I make this again, I would probably use 1/3 of the sun dried tomatoes.

I used seasoned bread crumbs and simplified the cooking of the stuffing ingredients and assembly. At first I thought it was an 8/10 but I went back for more so it must have been pretty good. My husband gave it a 10/10. After we ate I took the drippings and made a gravy that I put in the bottom of the leftover containers. That way if we get a bite of plain chicken we can dip it in the gravy. I forgot to chill the stuffing so I put the assembled chicken in the freezer for about 40 minutes and just cooked it longer (using a meat thermometer). Thankfully the stuffing stayed put.

We had this dish at our neighbors house and it was wonderful exactly as prescribed by the recipe!  I decided to make it this evening but when I started reviewing the comments from others who made also made this, decided to make a small modification and it was really delicious!!  Instead of making the bread topping I seasoned the breasts with salt & pepper, rolled the stuffing as instructed then, made a mixture of Mayonnaise and Parmesan cheese (1/2 C Mayo & 1/4 C Parmesan) and spread over the top of stuffed breasts.  I then sprinkled “seasoned” Panko breadcrumbs over the top and baked.  The chicken was really moist and very flavorful!  I also used Bell & Evans thin sliced breasts so did not pound and cooked for an additional 10 minutes.

A fantastic combination of flavors.  Could use more spinach and mushrooms relative to the quantity of cheese blend.   Also, more herbs in the bread mix.  I added a tablespoon of Italian seasoning, which was quite nice.  Took me WAY longer to put together than the recipe advertises.

My 92 year old mom ate every single bite. I made it with thighs and just put the thighs on top of the dip. Every bite was great. The stuffing would make a great dip.

I really liked this recipe. I made it as written. The “stuffing” was so good that we ended up eating it as a dip with our nachos! Will definitely make this again.

It took longer than 25 minutes to bake.  Our boneless chicken breast must have been bigger than the recipe. I baked for about 45-50 minutes.

I used panko bread crumbs and goat cheese.  I kept the chicken flat because it wouldn't roll easily even though I pounded it thin and put the cheese mixture and crumbs on top.  My husband loved it.  His new favorite dish.  Baked at 350 for 30 minutes.

I reduced the recipe in size as we had 3 chicken breasts.  We found the spinach flavour overpowered the rest the ingredients, if we made it again we would leave out the spinach.

I made this recipe tonight and it was delicious! I made one piece of chicken with the feta cheese and another with goat cheese. I sliced both in half after cooking and my husband and I did a taste test. I enjoyed them equally but my husband preferred the goat cheese. I used the Italian bread crumbs mixed with grated parmesan cheese and pepper like one reviewer suggested. I also brushed melted butter on top after about 20 min of cooking.  I had  fairly large chicken breasts so it took about 40 min or so to cook.  The only problem I found was that a lot of the stuffing leaked out while cooking which was fine when it was just my husband and I eating it but I want to make it for a dinner party and I'm worried about the presentation.  I may try and cook it at a lower temperature and maybe add a little less stuffing.

I made several changes. I used 4 ounces herbed goat cheese instead of feta and sour cream. I added sun dried tomoatos to the mixture as well.I also used a balsamic reduction with 2 tablespoons of honey and 2 sautéed shallots instead of Italian dressing. I added sautéed mushrooms (bella but button would work also) as the chicken baked. I did not use bread crumbs to cut down on calories. Made this way, it is a family favorite. The original recipe is good but this is how my family prefered it.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I lucked out finding it as I had almost all the ingredients. I only made 2 breasts so I reduced everything. I used prepared and seasoned bread crumbs but still added the parmesan. I also used Italian Seasoning as I didn't have any thyme. I also didn't have any sundried tomatoes so I marinated the breasts in Kraft Sundried Tomato & Oregano dressing. Sorry, but I also baked them at only 350 as I had a casserole in the oven with the breasts. I just baked it for 45 mins approx. I turned off the oven and left them in there for another 20 or so while we finished our Netflix show. Very tasty, crumbs browned nicely and breasts were even moistish. I will make again and try following ingredients exactly (except for the crumbs - I'm all for ready-made!).

I used this recipe for the "perfection stuffing" - which really is perfection - but not the rest. I like to coat my stuffed chicken breasts in garlic butter, then roll in a mixture of panko, parmesan, italian seasoning and salt. If there is extra after the breasts are breaded, I heap it on top and then spoon the extra garlic butter over top. Bake at 350 in convection for 30-minutes. Yum!! *Note: make sure to season the breasts with salt or they will be bland.

made this for the first time today but will not be the last.  Simplified by using seasoned bread crumbs as suggested by others, doubled the sour cream (also suggested by others), did not have fresh thyme so used dried, and did not have green onions so substituted finely chopped yellow onion cooked till translucent.  did not get why it calls for freezing the filling on a cookie sheet - skipped that.  after marinating the chicken for a couple of hours i pounded till a bit thinner,  spread on the filling, rolled it up and dunked it in the bread crumb - parmesian mix, then placed on baking dish.  came out wonderful.  next time i plan on trying goat cheese in place of the feta.  Thank you for this great recipe!

My family loved it.  I used more mushrooms, just because I love them so much.  It was lovely.  I'll definitely make it again.

PS:  Each portion is huge - enough to satisfy a hungry guy!

This meal was better than I expected.  My only hiccup was trying to figure out what direction to roll the chicken.  I tried end to end and also tried it not rolling it and putting crumbs on the top.  Both ways tasted great, and my kids kept asking for more!

I too decided to use premade bread crumbs.  I took the advice of another reviewer and put the chicken breasts into plastic bags and pounded them flat with an empty wine bottle.  It took no time at all and made the original cooking time in the recipe correct.  My family loved it. I made six chicken breasts but I had plenty of left over stuffing so I could easily have made 9 or more.

My husband and I really liked this.  The flavor is great! Will definitely cook it again.  Used Panko bread crumbs as recommended by others for crispiness and baked it on a baking rack so that air would get underneath and keep the coating crisp.  Worked very well, not soggy at all.  After it finished cooking in about 35 minutes, I put it under the broiler for 2 minutes and then turned them over and cooked for another 1 minute and crust was nice and crispy.  Keep a good eye on it though once you put the broiler on to brown and crisp.  Thanks for the recipe. My husband said that I need to cook like this all the time!

Great aroma, looks fancy! I used 1 9 oz frozen spinach, and a mix of feta, cheddar, parmesan. You only need about 2 T of dressing for the marinade. You only need about 1/4 cup parm for the topping. I will add 1 t salt to the filling next time.

I didn't pound the chicken.  I'm not fond of the rubbery texture pounding gives so I sliced the boneless breasts like a pocket and stuffed the ingredients and put the remainder around the breasts.  Tastes great - hubby loved it!

This was OK.  I felt a little dry.  I wonder if spreading a little mayo over the breasts before adding the bread crumbs might help.  I didn't really mind the time it took to assemble, but I'm glad I used prepared panko crumbs instead of fooling with making homemade.  I also didn't use all the baking sheets during prep. - no need really.  And I only needed about 1/2 the filing as other reviewers also noted.  I probably won't bother with this recipe again.  Too many others to try and this just really didn't stand out.

I am not a super fan of chicken breast because the meat is so dry. I prefer chicken thighs. But this recipe works because the stuffing ingredients take away the dryness of breast meat. Also, unless you buy organic, locally grown poultry the chicken bought at the local grocery store is huge these days. So the serving amount listed in this recipe is a bit large. I also staggered the preparation through out the day due to chicken needs to marinate, and end result of the stuffing mixture has to sit in the freezer for 1/2 hour and the chicken takes a bit longer than 25 minutes to cook. This is juicy due to stuffing and quite tasty. Will make it again!

If I could do 4.5 I would! Based on popular reviews, I skipped making the breadcrumbs myself, and used a mix of panko/breadcrumb/Italian seasoning. I also brushed melted butter on the chicken before adding that as a topping. I used goat cheese instead of feta (great flavor, and kept it very creamy) and skipped adding the sun dried tomatoes (didn't have any on hand). I doubled the stuffing mixture, and used any left after stuffing, to dot around the chicken breasts in the pan to bake. I baked it for around 45 minutes, with average sized chicken breasts. Very good! Will make again, and tweak with other ingredients (broccoli instead of spinach etc).

I made this for company and they raved all through dinner, now they ask for it when they come over, we call it Russell's chicken, in honor of the guest who asks me to make it. Really good complex flavored dish.

I followed the suggestions of others-- added extra garlic , mushrooms and parsley to the spinach mixture and doubled the sour cream- to 1-cup 
And as suggested by another who rated the extra stuffing is fabulous as a dip for chips 
Yummy  !!

This was delicious!  I used what I had on hand so here were changes I made:  ommited mushrooms, used Montgomery Jack shredded cheese in place of feta, added a slice of Cooper Sharp cheese on each breast, used sun-dried tomato spread instead of buying a jar and chopping them, and used Italian bread crumbs as the breading.  This was the best stuffed chicken breast I ever had!  Thank you!!

I made this exactly like it says minus the mushrooms because I don't like them. This was an AMAZING chicken recipe! It is totally worth the amount of time it takes! I cooked the chicken ten minutes longer because I was worried it wouldn't be cooked all the way through (first time making stuffed chicken) and it came out perfect and not dry at all. Five stars all the way!

Great recipe. Taste is fabulous but a lot of work to make. Not a quick weeknight meal.  I use it for me and my boyfriend but if you are up for doing for company, it is impressive.

I AM DEFINITELY MAKING THIS AGAIN! received HUGE compliments on this dish! This was my first time ever making stuffed chicken breasts, and upon searching other recipes, I decided I liked the ingredients in this one the best.  However, I did add my own tweak to it, by wrapping the breasts with bacon, and sprinkling again, with some of the crumb mix.  I also roasted my potatoes and carrots in the pan...of course, I covered them with the crumb mix and bacon slices, too!!! Mmmmmm!  Bacon sautéed roasted veggies complimenting this very tasty stuffed chicken!

I loved this recipe, however because I wanted to dress it up for an anniversary dinner, I wrapped the finished product in bacon! I kept it together with two toothpicks, and the crusted the entire thing after wrapping it with bacon. I used panko, dried rosemary and thyme, pepper and salt and rolled it around before baking. Perfection and extremely impressive for dinner guests. Remember to take the toothpicks out!

I made these tonight and they were delish even with a few modifications:  I didn't have sun dried tomatoes so I skipped that part.  To simplify the recipe I used extra crispy shake & bake coating instead of bread crumbs.  Turned out great!  Also didn't roll them - seemed too messy and cumbersome (since I didn't pound out the chicken).  Also pressed for time, I didn't cool the mixture in the fridge or freezer.  Baked for 35 mins.  Start to finish we were eating in an hour.  Yum!

This was by far the most delicious chicken I've ever cooked! My boyfriend got excited just when he smelled the garlic and spinach cooking lol. I used a Panco breading instead of making some from scratch and it was DELICIOUS!!! (kinda hard to roll in the breading but well worth the effort!) A MUST TRY!!!

One of the best recipes I have had from here. The only thing I changed was used bread crumbs instead of stale bread and I flattened out chicken prior to filling. Yes it is a little time consuming but this is a huge hit!

I'd make this again, with modifications to the breading. Not sure how I'll modify yet, although I got some good ideas reading the other reviews. Wasn't keen on how soft it was. The filling is flavorful - I increased the sour cream to 1 cup, decreased the feta by 1/4 cup and added crushed red pepper (1/2 teaspoon). Good recipe!

It was delicious! I tried it on a whim, and I was completely surprised at how good it was! I didn't add the sun-dried tomato because I don't like them and it still was amazing.   I highly recommend, and it was easy to make.
Also, I didn't have bread crumbs so I used Matzo meal instead, delicious!

I made this last night but i kind of tweak/Substituted the recipe just a little because i didn't have all the ingredients. I didn't use chicken breast instead i used chicken thigh which i already had marinated. I didn't have spinach i used broccoli rabe instead. I also didn't used the homemade brad crumbs i used Italian bread crumbs and added the Parmesan cheese and i also left out the sun-dried tomatoes. for the filling I used Ricotta cheese, sour cream, broccoli rabe, a mixture of Italian cheese and the garlic oh and stuffing. It was soo amazing!!!! I'm sorry for changing the recipe but it was still edible and everyone enjoyed it.  

Thank you

This is one of the most delicious chicken dishes I have ever made. My husband loved it.  I always make a double recipe so we have lunches or multiple meals. This is not going to last. If you don't have stale bread you can toast it. The only problem was I ended up with twice as many bread crumbs as I needed. I put them in a zip  for next time.

The chicken has been in the oven for oven an hour now and it's still not cooked all the way through. Not sure what size breasts were used in this recipe but they were obviously MUCH smaller than the ones I used.  Next time I will used pounded out boneless chicken breast!!

As for my changes, added garlic (this needs it) and mushrooms..sauteed all before stuffing.  And I added an alfredo sauce to the top instead of red sauce and left out the cheese.

Wow! What a great recipe. I made it mostly as listed, though I substituted a sun dried tomato paste (my store was out of oil packed sun dried tomatoes). I also used Italian flavored panko crumbs with parm cheese added instead making my own crumbs. The stuffing tasted wonderfully, and the leftovers were even better the next day! Will definitely make again and again.

These are a bit of work to prep, but totally worth it. Even make good leftovers!  Plus you can play with the stuffing a bit if you have misc things in your fridge to get rid of

What a great recipe!  As suggested by others, I used Italian breadcrumbs instead of making my own.  I also did not use that amount of sun-dried tomato as I found that would be too much. The mixture would be enough to make at least 8-9 breasts so if you are not going to make more than 6 breasts, I would decrease the ingredients. My friends and I really enjoyed this dish!

What a great recipe. Change to suit our taste were increased amount of garlic and finely chopped mushrooms which I sauteed in a little red pepper. I had shake and bake and used that to coat after rolling up each stuffed breast. Cooked for one hour and served with rice. Soooo Good!

Everyone loved it!  Only changes:
- used ready made breadcrumbs and added Italian spices, more pepper and onion powder with the parm
- made a little less filling as per other suggestions...still had some left over, but not too much

OMG!!! Mad this for dinner tonight, and I absolutely loved it. Was going to just make a half recipe because my daughter said flat out she wasn't going to eat it, so it would have been just for my son and I, but I had enough feta to make a whole batch, so I figured why not. I'm so glad I did! I do agree with another poster that it was kind of salty, but I think that may have been my italian dressing I used as a marinade as it is VERY high in sodium. I also thought there was WAY too much of the bread crumb mixture. Next time I make it, I will probably just use a balsamic vinaigrette of some kind and only have batch of the bread crumbs. Overall though, great recipe and totally worth the work.

This was awesome! I left out the mushrooms, since half of the family doesn't like them, but they weren't missed. I followed the advice of a few others; I used Italian breadcrumbs and cooked it for closer to 35 minutes to ensure that the chicken was done. It looked impressive and tasted delicious.  Served with mashed potatoes and zucchini.  I'll definitely be making this again!

This recipe is awesome! I didn't have sun-dried tomatoes so I used a can of petite diced tomatoes and drained the liquid. I loved this filling so much I have used it to make a veggie lasagna and just added a layer of mozzarella.  I have also just made the filling and mixed it with angel hair pasta...wonderful!

This was fantastic! Only, I used bread crumbs with the Tyme and Parmesan cheese added.  Also, I used non-fat feta and non-fat sour cream and it still truned out wonderfully with fewer calories and fat.  I used Shitake mushrooms too, but chopped them instead of using them sliced. Note: don't use colored tooth picks to hold the breast together or the dye will bleed into the chicken.  If you're worried about the work, have the butcher pound out the chicken breasts for you. Sure, the marinating and chilling the filling takes a little time, but if you plan one day ahead, it isn't really that much work.

I made this dish and thought the bread crumbs (from bread) were a bit too much and will try italian bread crumbs next time. Also thought the dish could benefit from more cheese all the way around and maybe throw in some mushrooms. I would make it again but would modify with the above. Thanks

This was just OK. Not bad, but for the prep time, I didn't think the finished product was worth it. It sounded great but I wouldn't waste the time & ingredients to make it again.

Doubled the recipe for a dinner party, it was a huge hit. I love making this for company, it's sure to impress. I make the filling a day ahead so there is less to do in preperation.

Absolutely delicious....and very versatile.  If you don't have ingredients (I didn't have sundried tomatoes or green onions), it still tastes great.  I also used goat cheese (a personal preference) and again, it was phenomenal.  I will use this recipe again and again.

i was on a special diet when i made these so i didn't do the bread crust coating on them.  i did season the outside of the chicken with thyme, pepper, a little oregano and a tad of parmesan and they where still awesome!

I am giving myself a 3 star not the recipe itself because I think I messed it up. The receipe looks gorgeous and the ingredients are perfect for one another. I have read everybody's comments and am still at a loss to why this did not turn out as I expected. Maybe it was the quality of my ingredients?  My feta was a smooth variety which is not as flavoursome as others I have used. It had no bite. Was not mad on the sundried tomartoes I used, again they were without bite. My topping was store brought cornflake crumbs which turned out horrible. Don't know what I was thinking.... I will use homemade breadcrumbs next time and not be so lazy! I might try frozen spinach as others have suggested and season my mushrooms while cooking. Never one to give up I am going to give this another go next week and try hard not to stuff it up! I am positive that it will be Perfect next time. I will let you all know how I go. Smiles from Austalia(:

This was really really good! I made just a few changes...first I used italian bread crumbs instead of making my own and in place of sun dried tomatoes I used roasted red peppers...which made this awesome! I didn't leave the stuffing in the freezer for the full 30 min, maybe just 15 or 20 min.  The stuffing is just incredible and also makes a great dip!  I also pounded out the chicken and secured with toothpicks.  This cuts down on the cooking time.  My BF also really liked this.  I will be making this again and might even make the stuffing seperately as a dip!

I thought this had a good taste, but the feta cheese is really strong.  I would have liked this more if the cheese would've been more of an accent taste.  My husband thought it was alright, and my kids hated it.  If I made this again I would use either cream cheese or ricotta cheese in place for the feta and only use a little feta for taste.  Also, I would use italian bread crumbs instead of all the work for the coating.

So So good!! Took a little bit of time but so worth it!! I also used corn bread stuffing mix to cut back on the time.  The feta spinach dip was so good.  we had some left over and used to dip veggies as an app.  Even my husband who is not a feta fan loved it!! A+ thanks so much!!!

This was an interesting mix of flavors. I enjoyed it more than my boyfriend. He ultimately picked the stuffing out and just ate the chicken. I used thawed frozen spinach in the feta mixture and some Pepperidge Farm cornbread stuffing mixed with a little water and butter for the topping, which saved a lot of time. This dish was not bad, but it's not something I'll ever make again.

I as many others did not marinade the chicken, and I replaced the sundried tomatoes with a thin strip of roasted pepper laid flat on the filling prior to rolling.  I used the panko bread crumbs and did not have a nice brown crunch however I was making 24 breasts at once so...Overall this is a definite keeper in my repatoire.

This was perfect. I flattened the breasts and let them marinade overnight and I have never had juicer, more tender chicken in my life. It was wonderful.

I'm only giving this dish 3 stars because of my personal taste. I served this for a party that we catered for and everyone raved about it. However, my husband and I thought it was quite salty and something was missing. Perhaps it was because we made such a large batch (served 40). I will try making it again for the normal serving and change my rating at that time if need be. I'm sorry I can't pinpoint what was wrong

Unbelievable! I didn't even stuff the breasts. Just coated them with the breading (easy way as recommended)...heated the "perfection" thoroughly and then served it on top of each breast. It still looked great and got rave reviews!

I even coated then froze the chicken...and froze the "perfection" and took it all to the Bahama's to prepare down there!! Turned out great.

Very tasty!  I used italian bread crumbs instead of the stale bread. I also cut out the pounding of the chicken myself by buying the thinly-sliced chicken breasts.  Next time, though, I will not use so many sun-dried tomatoes.  The taste of them was too acidic for me.

I made this for my dinner party. Everyone LOVED it!!! Only change was using prepared breadcrumbs with Parmesan cheese sprinkled with butter instead of making own breadcrumbs. My chicken breast were huge so extra cook time was needed. This recipe is a KEEPER!

Absolutely wonderful if you like feta/spinach combos.  I added some cream cheese as well after reading that some reviewers felt it had gotten dry. THank you so much for sharing this one!

Unbelievable! Okay I didn't have time to go to the store, so I substituted the sun dried tomatoes with roasted red peppers, I used fat free sour cream & ready to use italian seasoned bread crumbs (which I coated entire chicken breast with). Definitely a keeper!

Wonderful!  I do make a few changes to make it a little healthier.  I use sundried tomatoes that are dry, not packed in oil and I use olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  I also use premade bread crumbs instead of making my own.  Enjoy.

I used store-bought Italian Bread Crumbs instead of making my own. I also used Caesar dressing instead of Italian for the marinade. The feta I used was the crumbled Sun-dried Tomato and Basil seasoned cheese. I brushed extra dressing on top of the chicken after I stuffed them, then added the bread crumbs. Very tasty. I'll definitely make this again and try different Italian and Caesar style dressings to mix it up a bit.

yummy!!! I didn't have the spinach but it still turned out great, did everything else to the recipe :) But I did add some melted butter on top of the chicken for 5 minutes at the end. ALso, I had too much of the filling so I broke it up and put it in the freezer in a freezer bag and used it the next week, it was so much easier to have that mixture on hand!!!

Made this tonight for my family and they absolutely loved it! I didn't have onions, mushrooms, or sundried tomatoes, so I substituted canned artichoke hearts, chopped olives, capers, and a little tomato sauce; and wrapped the chicken in bacon...I personally thought it was too artichokey tasting but everyone else loved it the way it was. I will definitely make it again using the recipe how it says too!

This was awesome.  Too many bread crumbs.  Also, I needed to cover it with aluminum foil so they wouldn't burn.  For the mixture, I did use 3/4 C Sour cream and 6oz Feta cheese. Tasted good to me.

Very good and very easy.  I thought there was WAY too much bread crumbs. I would cut it down by two slices next time.

WOW - this was awesome.  Feta-Licious!
I did have to cook the chicken about 25 minutes longer.  All in all the meal took longer to make then expected, but it was WORTH it!!!
Also had to add more oil for the mushrooms to saute.

Oh yum!  I only had cornbread stuffing mix, but used it anyway and the family raved. But anything with a whole stick of butter layered on it is going to be good. The sour cream mixture ain't purty, but then end result is yummy.

I really liked this but cut a lot out. I was in a hurry so I didn't bread the chicken and I didn't roll it but rather just put the spinach mixture on top of the chicken breasts.  It still turned out great!
