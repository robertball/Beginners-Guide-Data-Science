This was pretty good!  I added a cup of melted chocolate to the cream cheese mixture and made a raspberry chocolate cheesecake--YUM!

I just made this for a ladies tea and it was a huge success. I used a small 8" springform pan and used one package of neufchatel cheese instead of 2 full-leaded. Loved it!

This was a all around good recipie. The mousse is great (although halving the amount of the jam and whip topping would still cover the whole cheesecake). I was slightly disappointed by the recommended cook time. I may have messed something up along the way, but I had it in the oven for around 35 minutes, and it still wasnt done. Cut back on the ingredients for the mousse and increase the cooking time, and this recipe might be a five star.

This cheesecake was okay.  The cheesecake part was not sweet enough, and the raspberry mousse on top was a little lacking, too.  I would not make this again.

Quick & refreshing, yet very easy.  I served this at a dinner party & everyone was very impressed.  Even my brother-in-law, who doesn't normally like cheesecake, said it was the best he'd ever had & even had seconds.  I added a bit of sweetened condenced milk to the mousse part to help it set up better (about 1/3 can).  This made a lovely presentation, moderatly sweeter though.  I will definatly make this again & again!

I loved this recipe.  The only thing I would change is, I would not make as much raspberry mousse because when I cut into the well chilled cheesecake, the mousse ran into the area where I just removed the piece of cheesecake.  It made it a little messy for presentation, but the taste is wonderful.  I also garnished it with fresh raspberries and blackberries.  It really added to the dish.

All I can say is WOW. This is a fantastic cheesecake. I had a dinner party over at my house and made this and everyone was raving! Made me feel wonderful! I made a home-made graham cracker crust out of my Betty Crocker cookbook that was heavenly with it. The only problem I had was it took 20 minutes longer to bake than the recipe said. When you make this, and I recommend that you do, make sure to test your cheesecake in the center with a toothpick for doneness. The topping for this cheesecake was way easy and tasted wonderful. I added a bit of red food coloring to it to give it more color, since I used cherry preserves. Delicious cheesecake! I will make this again and again.

Very tasty and very pretty.  When cut, the pie displays several layers - the cream topping, the raspberry preserves formed a second layer after chilling, the cheesecake, and then the crust.  Next time, I'll spread the mousse layer more smoothly and garnish with fresh raspberries and mint leaves.

Delightful.....the only thing I changed was I made my own crust, therefore the baking process was a little longer. I certainly will make this again!

Delish! I baked in a 9 inch springform pan for 25 minutes; topped with 1 c. whipping cream (whipped with a tbsp. sugar and 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract), added a little sweetened condensed milk per a suggestion, mixed with homemade raspberry freezer jam. I don't know how it could be any better.

Twenty-five minutes WAS NOT enough time!!!!  I cooked this for the 25 minutes, allowed it to cool for a few hours, put on the topping, and refrigerated it for a day.  When I tried to serve this, the pieces fell apart.  The outside 1 inch or so was done (like normal cheesecake), but the center was runny!  I ended up scraping off all the mousse and putting it back into the oven for another half hour.  It still tasted good, but if you only cook for 25 minutes you'll be flirting with disaster.

PLEASE READ THE "CHEESECAKE TIPS" FROM ALLRECIPES!! The tips helped make this cheesecake incredible. I got a TON of compliments. It was very light and creamy!! I used plain rasberry jelly for the mousse and then froze it while I let the cheesecake chill for 24 hours after baking. WOW!! I will have to make this again!! Thanks

I altered the recipe due to my diabetes.  I used fat free cream cheese, Splenda instead of sugar, and used the strawberry flavored Cool Whip.  Everyone at a gathering enjoyed it as much as I did.  This recipe is a keeper!

I don't know what went wrong, but the cheesecake itself was very mushy and seemed to be undercooked. My family and I also thought with the topping it was WAY too sweet. We usually love cheesecake, but this was so sweet we could barely eat it.

Great cheesecake!  I used a pre-made graham cracker shell, which wasn't the best...next-time home-made!  The cheese cake and raspberry mousse topping were wonderful.  Great take-along dish.

I've made this several times now and have altered it by changing the flavors of the fruit spread I use.  I do not make the mousse/whipped topping at all.  The family likes the cheesecake as is without the topping.  I use the recipe as base for cheesecake and then swirl in whatever jam or sauce that I have on hand.  Definitely a keeper in my home!

What a delicious cheesecake/pie!  So easy to prepare -- don't change a thing, unless you use strawberry, blueberry, etc. jam if you don't like the raspberry. Everyone loved this -- it's nice to have the taste of cheesecake AND a fruit mousse pie all in one.  I'll be making this a lot!

This cheesecake got rave reviews at the dinner I took it to last night. It was so easy to make.  I used a traditonal homemade unbaked pie shell I had in the freezer.  (I always make 6-8 to keep on hand for occasions like this.)
Like some others, I made it with real whipped cream into which I gently folded in raspberry jam.  Also, like another reviewer suggested, I made the filling using only half the ingredients - plenty to fill the one pie shell. Next time, I will make the full amount and fill two pies, one to go in the freezer.
I loved the idea of another reviewer about putting a layer of chocolate on the cheesecake, and topping that with the Mousse.  Everyone commented about the chocolate.  I melted chocolate chips, stirred in some whipping cream - I could have added more cream as it was a little firm but the added texture was nice.  I also baked the cheesecake for longer than the recipes says.  Good cheesecake!

I made it following the recipe, but it was really rich. I think I will make it without the jam next time and just put raspberries on the top.

This is a very easy dessert to make!  I had a supply of home raised, blackberry jam that wasn't as jelled as I wanted, so I used this instead of raspberries.  I made the homemade graham cracker crust (non-baked) on this site. I didn't know if I would like jam and cool whip together but was a great flavor, sweet-tart.  A wonderful substitute for a cheesecake craving and very smooth.   I will make it again!

Very good! I combined with a homemade graham cracker crust, but it was sweet and held its form well. The raspberry topping can be a little strong so make sure not to overdo the jam.

I made this with a Oreo cookie crust and it was perfect both times I made it and I put fresh raspberries on too for decoration ... also
