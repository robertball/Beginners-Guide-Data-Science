This is my first time making Hot Cross Buns. I don’t have a bread machine, so I just used my Kitchenaid mixer and let them rise once in the bowl and once in the 9x13 pan. Also, I didn’t have any cardamom so I substituted cinnamon. The next time I make them I’ll make sure I have the cardamom, because these were delicious! For the optional fruit, I used brandy soaked raisins and candied cherries and pineapple. So yummy!

I was drawn to this recipe because of the cardamom, and I'm writing this with the subtle richness of that spice in my mouth from the recipe's finished product. -- The dough after the dough course in the breadmaker was very sticky. I couldn't handle it without covering my hands in flour often. In the breadmaker, the dough rose so high it was about to pop the top off. -- After cutting the dough into 12 balls and letting it rise again, I had the unfortunate task of figuring out how to deal with softball-size balls of dough. Once risen, they completely filled the 9x13 pan. I tipped the dough out of the pan and rolled them back into 12 balls. Putting six each on two flat cookie sheets, I baked them like that. Out of the oven, I let them cool for a couple of minutes before drizzling the frosting on top. It was all I could do to keep from eating one right then!-- The result was a tenderly sweet bun that wasn't overly spiced but just enough to make them smell delicious.

This turned out wonderful!!  I made a few changes but overall the recipe stayed the same.  I made an egg wash with 1 egg yolk and 1 tbsp of cream and brushed the buns just before placing in the oven.  I didn't have cardamom so I used nutmeg and cinnamon.  Also I would suggest making half of the icing for the crosses cause it was way too much.  I also made a syrup of 2 tbsp sugar and 1/3 cup water and a tsp of vanilla extract to brush on the buns as soon as I took them out of the oven.  Also, 12 buns couldn't fit in a 13x9 pan, so I placed 8 buns in the pan and the other 4 in a 8 inch cake dish.  These buns are soft and delicious and very yummy..it is a great recipe!!  My husband has had quite a few and I ate 2 as soon as it came out of the oven. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Lovely texture and flavor. Very nice recipe.  Made as written, however I had to add in quite a bit more flour at the kneading stage (I used my KA). I also cut down on the glaze. Some mentioned that it makes more than necessary. I halved it and still had lots left over. I could also see that I was going to get 12 monster rolls, so I formed 16 and baked the extra in an 8x8 pan. They were a perfect size. My add-ins were currants and dried cherries. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

We love these Buns, I made them with raisins, currants and peel.  They are a big hit, even when I made them with part WW flour.

Good taste. I sprinkled a little sugar and cinnamon on the dough before baking. Also, I made two large braids instead of buns.

Really nice flavor, Came out huge, would make them much smaller cause due to size it was a lot of roll for little frosting. Dried out considerable next day.

Yummy!  Warm, comforting, tender, soft... all I could have hoped for and more from my first attempt at yeast bread.  I don't have a bread machine, so I combined everything and kneaded for 8-10 minutes.  I used cinnamon instead of cardamom (only had pods), almond milk, zest of one orange and chopped cherry craisins.  Topped with strips of pastry, baked at 400 (should have done an egg wash before baking for color) and brushed with warmed honey and orange zest when they came out of the oven.  Cannot even imagine how divine these will be with icing.  Thank you for a wonderful, easy recipe that even a beginner can prepare well.

Positively excellent.  Made exactly as directed with the exception of icing them.... as they were disappearing from the pan while they were cooling... and finally, I gave up getting after everyone to leave them be.  I'd never had any experience with HCB's other than the nursery rhyme.  The taste of these remind me slightly of panettone or stollen meet King's Hawaiian Bread.  I used golden raisins.  The cardamom was a special, special touch and I would not suggest skipping it. I did not find the dough sticky at all... came out nice & smooth and I hacked it apart evenly with my bench scraper.  I just can't get over how great these were!

These were similar to Sweet Hawaiin rolls.  I thought they should be divided into smaller portions, but the flavor was very good.

Made this yesterday and couldn't have asked for a better bun.  I made some changes but I don't think anything that would have a huge impact on the outcome.  I used 1 cup buttermilk (needed to use up) and 1/4 cup 2% milk.  Trader Joe's has a Triple Berry mix which has golden raisins, cherries, blueberries and cranberries in it so I used that for my dried fruit.  Everything else was as recipe stated.  After proofing yeast of which I added a teaspoon or so of sugar I starting adding every ingredient in order on recipe to the bowl (without mixing) until everything was in.  Then I gently started mixing, folding, kneading with my hand just until incorporated.  I covered bowl with some saran wrap and let it rest for about 5 or 10 minutes.  I sprayed a 9 X 13 baking pan with cooking spray and dropped by heaping spoonfuls 4 across and 6 down to make a total of 24 buns.  At this point I put on disposable plastic gloves then sprayed one hand with cooking spray, rubbed them together and then picked up each piece of dough and formed it into a ball returning back to the pan. This really helped as the dough is very sticky and hard to work with. Covered with saran wrap and let rise.  Baked for 25 minutes (my oven took that amount of time to brown).  After cooled I made the icing and spooned it all over the top like cinnamon rolls instead of making crosses.  Was loved by everyone at our family Easter dinner.  Even my husband who I thought would not like due to the cardamom enjoyed.

Although this recipe resembled the look of hot cross buns , they in no way tasted like them.  I made them twice to make sure that I did make them correct.. I used them for easter for my dinner rolls.. they in no way resemble the hot cross buns that I am used to with the cinnamon , and other spices.. cardamom alone does not give the taste of cinnamon buns...

These were excellent!  I tried out a batch yesterday to see if I wanted to make them for Easter and I will be for sure.  I didn't alter the recipe much: I was almost out of white sugar so I used 1/4C white and 1/4C brown sugar.  Also, I followed the recipe when I added 1/4C dried cherries, 1/4C golden raisins, 1/4C dried cranberries but also added 1/4C currants.  It was my first time using cardamom and I don't think I'd skip this spice or use cinnamon in it's place, they smelled so very good.  My whole family loved them ages 5-adult.  FYI - The recipe does make a lot and they are dense but oh so wonderful!

Sandra, plz understand that hot cross buns and cinnamon buns are 2 entirely different things. These HCB are just fabulous! My first attempt at hot cross buns, tho I've been making bread for years. Don't own a bread machine, used my Kitchenaid to mix. Had to add 1/2 cup more flour as suggested by others, wanted to use currants, but impossible to find this time of year in the SW, so used all golden raisins. Absolutely yummy! Light and fluffy, wonderful flavor, took me back to my childhood in upstate NY, where everybody has hot cross buns for Easter. BTW, got 18 good-size rolls out of it, enough to share with the neighbors.

EVERYONE that had these buns loved them.  The cardamom really makes this recipe, so don't skip it or use cinnamon instead.  I found the amount of spice to be perfect, but I did add an extra 1/4 cup of sugar  in the second batch - to my taste, it was much better.

served these with tea and hot cxocoa at our annual egg coloring we have for our grandchildren.  They were loved by everyone.  I subbed the cardamom with cinnamon and nutmeg to cut cost a little as I made 5 batches and will make these a regular part of easter from now on.

Easy to make! I don't have a bread machine so I just mixed it together, kneaded it a little, until no longer super sticky, and let it rise in a greased bowl. Punched it down and then followed the rest of the directions. The cardamom (expensive!) was worth it to make it a special taste experience for Easter. Thank you, these will be a new tradition for us.

These were a hit this Easter morning.  I liked the flavor and fragrance of the cardamom, and the almond extract in the icing gave it nice flavor.  I had a lot of icing left over, so I served it on the side for those that wanted to add more (I'll make maybe only 2/3 of the icing next year).  I was searching for a hot cross bun recipe that was similar to ones we used to buy from a local bakery when I was growing up.  While these were not the same, they were certainly very good, and I have found a new Easter tradition for my family.

Excellent, light and flavorful! The recipe actually made 18 LARGE buns for me. I didn't make this in a bread machine, but it worked perfectly well kneading the dough in the stand mixer. I gave them two risings in the bowl, and then shaped them put them in baking dish, and them in the refrigerator overnight. I took them out on Easter morning, gave them their final rise and baked them, so they were warm and delicious! I brushed them with an egg wash before baking so they got a nice shiny golden top. I did find that the glaze recipe made WAY too much. I only used about a third of the glaze (froze the rest for future use). The almond flavor in the glaze was a wonderful complement to the cardamom in the rolls. This is definitely a recipe that I will make again. Might not even wait for Easter. I think this recipe would also make excellent cinnamon rolls.

First time making bread, this recipe is easy and the buns turned out good.  I don't have a bread machine, so mixed all the ingredients together, placed the dough in a large bowl over plastic wrap and let it proof a little.  I didn't have any ground cardamom, but I used some cinnamon and nutmeg, worked out fine and tasted great.

Wonderful recipe -- it has never failed me!  I usually add more dried fruit -- I like currants, citron, candied cherries, etc.  I've used this dough to make cinnamon rolls & they turned out fantastic!  Thank you!

This was a very sticky dough/ I had to add a ggod bit more flour at the kneading stage. I only used half the cardomom as I like it but husband and daughter do not....needed it very subtle for them. I like that this one does NOT use the usual icky candied/artificially colored fruit stuff.

These were very easy and very delicious.  I like a thicker frosting and put the wet ingredients first into my bread maker.  The rest was the same.

I got about 18 buns from this recipe.  The cardamom gives it a unique flavor. I thought they were good but not outstanding. I'm hoping I'll find some other good recipes to use cardamom in since I bought it specifically for this recipe and the stuff is expensive!

These are out of this world! I used 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c shortening because I ran out of butter. I also substituted cinnamon for the cardamom b/c I didn't have any. I added normal raisins at the beep. Do not leave out the almond extract in the icing! These are tender, flaky, yummy, good.

Yummy! Just made these for the first time. I had to toss my first batch, but that was because I didn't follow the order of ingredient for my bread machine. Second batch was much better. The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars was the cardamom wasn't very strong, I think I might try doubling it next time. Love the icing and overall flavor of the bread, though. Was well received.

I tried this recipe out because i love hot cross buns from the store and wanted to learn how to make my own.  Very easy in the bread maker, and a definate keeper!  I used 1/2 cup candied fruit, and 1/4 cup golden raisins.  Turned out awesome! Thanks for the recipe!!

better than 5 stars! absolutely easy, no fuss at all if you make the dough in the bread machine, and the kitchen is perfectly clean, you barely dust your hands. I even omitted the cardamom, and had no raisins, orange peel, no nothing! I only had some cinnnamon handy and put the powder into the pan. They disappeared so fast that I couldn't possibly verify if they keep well, and a bunch of picky eaters I bake for!! I already got requests for a second batch.

Delicious.  I love the pop the cranberries give to these buns.  These make huge buns; if you want smaller, make 24 buns--12 were huge.  Worked, but huge.  I went to make the frosting and learned I had no confectioner's sugar, so I just used some leftover frosting I had in the fridge with pecans.  Not exactly the same, but delicious.  I love the cardamom in this.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good! The icing ended up too liquid for me but the little I did put on them before my mom-in-law accidentally threw the rest out was very good. Definitely helps to have a bread machine to do all the mixing.

These rolls have an excellent texture and stay moist and soft for days.  However, I changed the recipe a bit by using 1 1/2 cups of raisins instead of the cherries and cranberries. I also used 1 cup of sugar (I like my buns a bit sweeter) and 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp cloves and forego the icing on top.

These were so light and fluffy and not overwhelmed with the spices in typical Hot Cross Buns. Instead of vanilla, I used almond extract in the icing. Delicious! Thank you for posting this recipe.

I wasn't a big fan of the frosting, although it's easy enough to make.  I soaked all of the fruit in spiced rum overnight, but the flavor didn't really come out in the finished product. It did have a Hawaiian sweet bread taste, but overall not a 5-star performance.  They seemed a little dry, though I baked them for only 20 minutes and they were perfectly golden brown.

Oh. My. Gosh!!! First time ever making hot cross buns and I am not disappointed. They are SO delicious that I won't wait for Easter to roll around to make these again! I didn't have cardamom so I used a little nutmeg and cinnamon. Also used about 75% a/p flour and 25% spelt. Awesome, awesome, AWESOME!!

I made these last night, they were so easy it was amazing. As soon as they were cool enough my son and his friends ate the whole lot and have requested I make more. This time I will make them so that I get a taste before they get home. Fantastic and so easy to make, Thanks for a great snack.

It’s getting late on ‘Easter eve’ if you will, and I am making these for a family gathering... for the third year running! I make them as the recipe is written, with the exception of the icing. It does make a lot so I’ve always cut it down but this year I’m making that as written too! I’m going to package what’s left of the icing and set it with the rolls so guests can have extra, if they wish! These are so delicious and tender and oh-so-fragrant! Thank you so much for sharing this gem of a recipe and have a Blessed Easter!

These are tasty, but the buns in the middle of the pan were gummy.  Next time I make this recipe, I will use muffin tins.

I love this recipe and the texture of the bread. I do not have a bread machine so i just mixed it by and and proofed it twice. I do not like cardamom so i substituted with cinnamon, nutmeg, and a little ginger, next time i will add more spices for a stronger flavour.

The only change I made was to add one half cup of fruit cake dried fruit and one quarter cup raisins..lined  my large glass pan with parchment paper and sprayed it. I made 24 balls. They rose up twice their size and baked for twenty five minutes, I let them cool  for ten minutes and then 
 poured the frosting over th e m and used a butter knife to cover..omg these are so good...even in October! The almond extract is fabulous in the frosting..heat for fifteen seconds in micro..Will be Making again.many times..

Because my bread maker broke, I used the comments by Red Hat Milli and the buns didn't rise well at all (I also used evaporated milk and that could be part of the issue). The flavor was awesome and everyone still loved them...but I will stick to the written directions next time and use my KitchenAid dough beater.

This is probably the fifth or sixth Hot Cross Buns recipe I have tried, and the ONLY one where the soft, fluffy texture is what I have always tried to achieve.  These remind me so much of the hot cross buns I remember as a child - slightly sweet, soft and pillowy, almost like a dinner roll.  I know that's not what many people expect from a Hot Cross Bun, but I am so happy I tried this recipe!  The one down side was that the dough was actually a bit too moist, so I had to knead in a bit of flour in order to be able to handle it, but other than that these were pretty much foolproof.  I used a combination of dried cranberries and dried blueberries, and orange extract in the icing instead of almond.  Thanks for sharing!

First, no need for a bread machine. I used mine and it didn't mix the ingredients very well. So I took the whole mess out and put it in the Kitchen Aid. Voila! It was a bit sticky, so I did need to add extra flour. Not much though. I let it rise in the bowl for about an hour, then rolled the dough into balls (about 18 medium sized because of what other reviewers warned) and let it rise again before baking. I also sprinkled a little sugar and cinnamon on top per another suggestion. 
Out of the oven these were amazing without anything on top! Cooled, I can see why frosting adds a bit as the buns seem to be a bit denser now.
Great recipe! I think I'll make them for Easter per their traditional intention, but this first batch is going to work with me so I can announce the bun in my oven :)

This was my first time for making Hot Cross Buns and they were terrific! I didn't use the bread machine, just kneaded them by hand about 10 times. I also made 18 buns instead of 12 and they were plenty big enough. This will be my Easter standard for sure!

These were DELICIOUS.  My husband loved them so much that I have to make them again after Easter!  I didn't have the Cardamom so I used Cinnamon and Nutmeg.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was a amazing recipe!
My mother absolutely loves Hot Cross-Buns!
She was amazed that my family member & I made her such beautiful buns! They turned out great, we used everything in the recipe (expect the almond extract because of allergies!) but it was amazing not only how SIMPLE! but easy, I also diced up the fruit to be just like the hot-cross-buns you'd find at the bakery, but these are 100% better, easyer, and CHEAPER to make!
My family member told me that he'd make this for his wife more often because of how simple, and easy it was, and it took no time (really it didn't!) I plan on making them for her a little more often! And am very happy to review this with 5 stars!!
