Left out the pickle juice because it just seemed wrong...lol.  BUT, I have another suggestion for the rim of the glass.  Try Old Bay seasoning.  It's AMAZING

Forget the pre-made mix, use a good quality tomato juice. Add your own worchestire, lime juice too taste. FORGET THE HORSERADISH let people add their own. Adding it early to the mix ruins it.

It was tasty, but not really that easy to make. I'll post my own recipe later.
