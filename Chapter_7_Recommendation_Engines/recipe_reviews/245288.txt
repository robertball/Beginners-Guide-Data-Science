11.7.15    A bit weak in flavor, but in all fairness, I did use skim milk.  One thing for certain, it doesn’t get much easier than this to whip up a batch of eggnog!  I think the rum is an important ingredient in this recipe, but if you don’t want to add the alcohol, I’d recommend adding rum extract.  And if you’re watching your calories, I think sugar substitutes would work well in this recipe.  Do give it time to chill because the flavor improves.  Sam Nemati, thanks for sharing your recipe.

This is great for people freaked out about using raw eggs because the vitamin does cook them - I made the recipe using whole milk and added some vanilla bean it definitely has to sit in the fridge for the full 4 hours to get thick. But it lacks the creaminess I'm used to, however this can easily be created by playing with your milk ingredients replacing part of the milk with cream and or condensed milk. As is it's a great lower fat recipe my family loved it!

Delicious!  I made this with 2 12 ounce cans of evaporated milk.  The egg was completely cooked and it turned out thick and velvety.  I added a couple of dashes of cinnamon with the nutmeg.  I have a basic Vitamix, blended sugar, rum and eggs on high for 4 minutes.  Added milk and spices , blended for 2 minutes on low then finished with 1 minute on high.

I used Maple syrup, used freshly grated nutmeg, and omitted the alcohol. It was delicious! Note for next time: make half a batch at a time because I only used 3 cups of milk and the blender overflowed!

I like that the mixture does not separate like the other ones do. Probably because it is a little bit cooked or whatever. I also like how it's pretty simple to just add or change the recipe a little bit and still use the Vitamix

This is fabulous. I make it with evaporated milk for a better flavor and nice texture. The second time I made it I upped the eggs to 16 with 1.5 cups rum, .5 cup sugar, 3 cans evaporated milk plus spices. First round on high was for 6 minutes then the 2 mins on medium and the 1 on highest in the original directions. Put a little amaretto in your glass when you serve!

The recipe was super easy thanks to my Vitamix.  However, I wish I would've followed my instinct when I saw that the ingredients listed a tablespoon of nutmeg.  That was FAR too much for our tastes.  This is why I'm only rating it four stars.  I added vanilla extract, some extra rum and a dash of cinnamon.  Next time I'll only use a teaspoon of nutmeg and will also add some ground cloves.

This was incredibly easy and fast to make but just a touch on the bland side. Next time I will add vanilla and I think it will be perfect.  Thank you to the chef for sharing this recipe. It will save us a lot of money in the years to come from having to buy the over sweet eggnog at the store.

Delicious!!!   I made some substitutions to make this low carb.  Instead of sugar I used 1/4 cup of monk fruit and 1/4 tsp of liquid stevia.   I also substituted 1/2 and 1/2 for the milk.  We used Kraken spiced rum.

Five stars for ease . Made it as directed except did a teaspoon for the nutmeg. It was good, satisfied eggnog craving. Made a mistake on the next batch by subistuting in one cup of half and half. Killed the egg taste, made it too milky tasting.  Thanks for the recipe!

Once upon a Christmas Eve I was craving eggnog and all of the stores were closed. Searched through my pantry and found all the ingredients I would need.  Vitamix was on the counter taunting me!  Oh what a great surprise when I found this wonderful recipe. Only change was adding a dash of vanilla and an extra egg.

Turned out beautifully. Used 1/4 cup bourbon instead and half whole milk half heavy cream.
