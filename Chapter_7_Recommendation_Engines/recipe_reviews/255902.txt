A quick easy and very tasty meal. I had 2 pretty large breasts so I split them and wound up with 4 breasts. I seasoned both sides of the breasts with Lawry's Seasoned Salt and fresh cracked black pepper. Other than that I did not change a thing. I baked the time specified and my chicken was cooked to perfection.

This was delicious and a very quick meal to prepare. My husband both sons & I all enjoyed it. My only suggestion is to add some seasoning to the chicken beforehand (salt pepper etc.) Otherwise it was perfect.

Such a quick and easy entree to prepare for dinner. Delicious served over pasta and topped with the cheesy marinara sauce.

This was fast to make and certainly deserves 5 stars. If I could suggest any change it would be to use Italian seasoned panko - this will give depth and a nice crunch. I didn't change the recipe and found the seasoned bread crumbs to be flavorful enough.

This was indeed very simple to make and turned out delicious! I made sure to use panko crumbs with the cheese for a nice crispy coating.

I made this exactly as described. It was ok. I think it needed a bit more cheese. I served it over spaghetti noodles.
