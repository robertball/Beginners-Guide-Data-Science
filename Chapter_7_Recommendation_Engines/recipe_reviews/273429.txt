I used milk chocolate chips instead of white chocolate chips.  I think next time I will add the chips to the batter before baking.  It was a hit with hubby and my friend.

Great recipe. I added the white chocolate chips to the batter with the oreo pieces and it turned out amazing.

I made a double recipe and made two loaf cakes. This took 2/3 of a Family sized package of Oreos.  I found the cake to be too dry.  It had great flavor, however... I will try it again and more carefully measure the flour and oil, to see if I overdid it on the flour.

With a scoop of vanilla ice cream, I think it will be fine.

Not sure why people are saying it dry or not sweet. Made this just like the recipe said, and was perfect. Perfect balance of sweet. I have been requested to make it again

It's just ok.  Husband was very excited to try it.  I think the cookies make it extra dry even with the sour cream.

The batter tastes more like pancake batter than cake batter.  If I tried it again, I'd see if melted butter instead of oil made a difference, but as it is so underwhelming, I probably won't make it again. I was excited to make an Oreo treat for someone who is obsessed with Oreos.  This was just a miss.

This is good, but not amazing. I even added extra oreos and white chocolate chips in the batter and topping. The bread loaf itself needs to be sweeter like a cake, and not so bland.

I kept the recipe the same, but I didn't have the white chocolate morsels or the powder sugar to garnish it for the finish (personally, I thought it would be overkill on the sweetness factor).  It still came out excellent with just enough sugary sweetness to make your mouth water. This recipe is a keeper.

I like this but don't love it.  Although I sprinkled on the chips and crumbs immediately, they all fall to the sides since the cake rises up in the middle.  Many didn't stick/melt on the sides (and I was using mild choco chips so they should have melted super easy...all I had), so they just kind of fell out when parchment was removed.  Probably will be liked more by the kids at my family party tomorrow.  My 89 year old dad helped me and I know he MIXED in the oreos more than FOLDED them in....I definitely recommend you make sure not to overstir in the oreos...just FOLD per the directions.
