This is a keeper recipe!  I wanted a cake with apple butter and this is definitely it!  I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used plain yogurt instead.  I used only 1/2 cup of sugar in the cake and I added some lemon juice to the icing recipe because I wanted it a little tart.  It was moist, dense and fabulously delicious!  The baking time was shorter by about 12 minutes.  Maybe it was because I used yogurt?  don't know, but watch it carefully.
