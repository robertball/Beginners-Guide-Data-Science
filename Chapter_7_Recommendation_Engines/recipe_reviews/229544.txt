I've made puppy chow (or muddy buddies) many times. By far, this is the worst recipe I've ever used. Let me explain why.

I do not recommend the "microwave method". The chocolate comes out more chunky, where it needs to be smoother for better coverage. The best way to melt your peanut butter/chocolate mixture is to use a double boiler. If you don't have one, you can make one by filling a medium sized saucepan about halfway with water and placing a small saucepan into it with your pb/choc/butter. Turn the heat on low and stir continuously. The chocolate turns out perfect every time but be sure not to get water in your chocolate... it's very hard to fix although it can be done (yes, I've done this one time..  oops!).

Secondly, because I used the "microwave method" there was NOT enough chocolate mixture to coat the cereal completely (I definitely have chocolate standards). I made up more, finishing my bag of chocolate chips, still not satisfied. I cannot recall if I used this exact recipe with a home made double boiler... I will definitely try again but never use the microwave again. 

I always make more chocolate mixture than the recipe calls for, it's worth it. I always say find a recipe and eyeball it.

Even with an excess amount of powdered sugar (I don't measure this either, I dump about a half a bag into a doubled up paper bag and shake it like a Polaroid picture. If it's not fully coated, I add more. Also, I move them around by hand so I don't get "clumps" of cereal.) I

A friends wife made this for a Cub Scout den meeting and it was a huge hit! She calls it Christmas Crack because she only makes it during the holidays and you can't get enough of the stuff, lol.

My family loves this. One item I change is that I put cereal in a large bowl with a lid... then I don't have to waste a plastic storage bag each time. Just pour the chocolate/peanut butter mixture over cereal as indicated, then add powdered sugar. Put the lid on the bowl and spin it over several times (don't shake to hard, but a little shaking okay). Enjoyable and environmentally responsible.

I made this for a fundraiser, and because of worries with peanut allergies, I substituted butterscotch chips for the peanut butter. They were a hit! I also made them with white chocolate chips for a girl who didn't like chocolate.

Easy and good.  I will do a 50/50 mix of semi-sweet and milk chocolate next time.  I like it sweet!!  I made a 1.5x batch, and I used a 1000 watt microwave. I only needed to microwave 15 seconds the second time before everything was smooth.  I used a rubber scraper to stir the chocolate and chex together, carefully folding it in so as not to crush the cereal.  Keep on stirring until the cereal is coated evenly with chocolate.  Just like we did when I was a kid, we dumped the powdered sugar into a paper grocery bag and added the cereal to that.  We then took the bag outside and shook, shook, shook it.  A little powdered sugar leaks out of the seams of the bag, so that is why we do it outside.  Perfect.  Will go great with my son's 1st "puppy-themed" birthday party :)

Great recipe!  The only change I make is to use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet (family preference!) and they turn out perfect - very addicting!  Chocolatey, crunchy, sweet - can't go wrong!  If you want a real treat, store them in the freezer (we store in them in snack-size bags for quick snacks).  They taste even better straight from the freezer!  Especially in the summer :)

This is a great, easy recipe! Delicious, chocolate and peanut butter goodness! I personally add 2 times the amount of peanut butter, out of an unnatural love for peanut butter. I prefer it this way, but it's not particularly needed.

This is one of my family's favorite holiday treats!  A few tips:  1. Measure out your Chex cereal in level cups.  If you mound the cereal when measuring, you will have much more than 9 cups and will not have enough chocolate mixture to completely cover every piece.  2. Use the full amount of peanut butter and butter.  You need the oils in them to get the chocolate mixture to the right consistency for coating the cereal.  3. Stir, stir, stir, stir your chocolate mixture longer than you think you need to after the first minute of microwaving.  The absorbed heat from a glass or ceramic bowl will often completely melt the chocolate chips to a smooth consistency without needing to microwave it again.   Overheating in the microwave can cause the chocolate mixture to become chunky or even burnt.  4. Remember to add the vanilla!  5. Simply add 1/4 cup more powdered sugar if 1 1/2 cups is not enough.  Enjoy!

Sooo good. If you are making a lot, split them between 2 gallon bags to more easily coat in powdered sugar. Otherwise it is difficult to get them all evenly covered.

Great snack!  I'm a white chocolate lover, so I made with vanilla chips instead of chocolate.  Thinking about trying with Nutella instead of pb next time too!  Mmmm

Contrary to the negative review, if you stir the chocolate/peanut butter mixture for about 30 seconds in between each 30 second microwaving, you will have NO problems with clumps.  I also found that gently stirring in the powdered sugar makes it easier to get all of the pieces coated.  Good luck!

I liked this but I had problems, my chocolate seized up and I had to add more butter, tried to follow the recipe exactly but in the end I ended up with clumps of chocolate on some pieces, pieces stuck together and some that only got the powdered sugar coating because I couldn't get the chocolate to spread. even with that it was still a big hit, one of the few things that my mom ate without complaint and even my picky sister ate some and didn't complain, a feat for sure. I'll be trying this recipe again at some point and would appreciate any tips that could help in future endeavors from those that have succeeded in this recipe.

This is the first time I have tried making Puppy Chow and it was fabulous! Tasted just like I remembered as a child and was so simple to do with my 4 year old! Love that it can be a gluten-free treat as well for those with allergies. Didn't do any subs and shook it in a paper grocery sack- was easy and delicious! I love dark chocolate so maybe next time I will use those chips-or you could certainly add toffee ones-whatever your fancy.  Definitely a keeper:)

I made this for th first time about a few weeks ago and it turned out okay. I didn't use the microwave method though. Instead I just used a pan to melt the butter, chocolate and peanut butter. As long as you have it on medium heat and you watch it carefully as you stir it all together it works way better than the microwave method. You won't have to worry about any clumps of chocolate or peanut butter. The only thing I changed was that I used 2 boxes of Chex cereal and used 9 cups, but used the extra cereal to mix in once I had coated the chocolate ones with powdered sugar. It helps off set the sweetness of the powdered ones. I guess that's just my preference since I found it to be a lil bit too sweet for my likely. Having it mixed together you get a handful of plain cereal along with the muddy ones and it works out perfectly.

This recipe belongs in the "For Life" pile... My aunt use to make these for me when I was at her house; she would use a brown bag to mix everything together, but I don't use that method. I'll just put the mixture and chex into a large bow, and using a spatula mix it. It may be slightly more ark work, but this way you don't have to go and find a brown bag lol. The recipe itself is very reliable. After making this recipe for like a million times, you can just estimate how much of each you need for each ingredient. My friends think that it tastes better when you fully coat the muddy buddies so that you dont see the insides of the Chex. I hope you find the same results that I got cause once you make it, you won't stop!

This is a really good mix, I just modified it to what I like, you can do whatever you need, this is how I did it. I used chocolate chex (the entire box of the family size), a bag of chocolate chips, stick of butter, 2/3 cup peanut butter, microwave at short intervals, until it's totally melted, then add the vanilla. Use very large bowl (I used a big deep spaghetti cooker kettle), so you can get the entire mix covered. Then I carefully transferred it to a big 2 1/2 or 3 gallon hefty slider bag that I first added some powdered sugar too. Then add more powdered sugar (I too don't measure), start with half a bag or so. Then slide it closed all but a little bit, then blow it up like a balloon, quickly close it, then shake it vigorously! If it still looks like it's not covered enough, add more powdered sugar and shake some more. ENJOY!

Easy Peasy.  I make it every year for the holidays.  The only tweak I make is to use only 8 cups of cereal and a little less powdered sugar which makes it a bit muddier.

My ziploc bag did not coat everything.  I poured it all into my soup pot and had a more even coating when I did it by hand.  Tastes so good!

Been making this recipe for years, but we call it "puppy chow".  I double the powdered sugar to make it look more like the stock photo. Also keeps the mix less messy with the chocolate. If you don't have a large ziploc bag on hand, a couple clean plastic grocery bags work too, just make sure to double them up and tie well! If the mix looks to chocolatey after the first toss in the sugar, add more and repeat the process.

I used a double boiler. I used half vanilla extract, half almond extract and mixed it in while melting. I don't do GMO food so I used Barbara's Multigrain Spoonfuls from Trader Joe's. I also used a big bowl and spoon when I stirred in the powdered sugar and it didn't clump. However, who doesn't celebrate those lucky clumps when eating it, am I right?!! Easy and delicious! Only thing I would do next is maybe add a small amount of sea salt to make it pop, since I used unsalted butter.

It's got a decent flavor but it needed more powdered sugar (1/2 cup). Then it tasted like the Puppy Chow I remember!

This is nothing short of chocolate crack!  The only sub I made was coconut oil instead of butter. And I store mine in the freezer.

As written, this recipe wasn't coated enough. Not enough peanut butter, too much cereal. I tried this using 6 cups cereal & the original half cup pb, and this worked out much better. Not sure if this was a typo or what. Also make sure your chocolate mixture is melted thoroughly! You want it runny. I had to keep reheating my chocolate bc it wasn't melting. I used Nestle Toll House semi sweet morsels. May try milk choc morsels next time maybe by a diff brand. This made a lot even using 6 C of cereal. May try using some butterscotch chips next time.

I made this with Gluten free rice chex for a friend but the cereal was mostly crumbs in the box so it sure doesn't look anything like the pictures shown here. Tastes good but hard to eat.

I have made this recipe before with my grandma so wasn't for sure the actual recipe but I looove this, nobody can ever get enough. My niece and nephew call it candy. I didn't change anything other than I had bark chocolate instead of chocolate chips and it still worked perfectly. I also dnt put it in the microwave because I hate baking or melting chocolate in the microwave because it goes bad quickly! So I just added all the ingredients Into a pan and melt it on low heat.

My family is gluten and dairy free, and we made this snack when we lived in Madison, Mississippi for the church picnic. Everyone loved it!!!! Now we live in Florida, and we still make it when we go up to Mississippi for the picnic, and when we want a sweet treat.

I make this every single year since my kids were small, several times between Halloween and New Year's. It is something that is required!!! Lol! This recipe  is very similar to the 1 I used to have. The kids gave this 4 thumbs up!!!! I doubled the recipe and made then added a little bit more just to ensure we had enough. It barely lasted 3 days and I got NONE of it!!! So I guess the kids approved:) !!!

Yep, I grew up calling these treats Puppy Chow because of the white coating like the puppy food had!  Haven't made in over a decade and they came out just as binge-worthy as I remember!

The first time i made it i followed the recipe, the second time I made it i used cinnamon chex . I like the original way better. Milk chocolate is a really good chocolate to use. This was a huge hit for Thanksgiving and Christmas, everyone loved them.

I ended up almost doubling the choc-peanut butter mixture because it came out so dry and hard to spread. I think a double boiler would have had a better outcome than the microwave method. Still tasty though!

I did not put the cereal in a bag to shake the powdered sugar on instead I tossed cereal in a large bowl with the powdered sugar   Worked great. Will make again.

It’s okay, but it taste nothing like the real thing. Also, I suggest you use more of the stuff that coats the cereal besides peanut butter, because it is too thin of a layer compared to the authentic ones, and it’s too peanut butter-y.

This is so easy and yummy!  And versatile!  I used butterscotch chips with the peanut butter mixture and poured over half of the cereal.  I melted chocolate and poured over the other half.  I first made this over Christmas break and divided the cereal into thirds and used white chocolate, chocolate, and peanut butter chips.  Will definitely be a making again!  I had no problems using the microwave method- ran microwave in 30 second intervals and attempted to stir after each time until melted.

This recipe definitely needs more chocolate and peanut butter. I used 2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate chips and 3/4 cup of peanut butter and it was enough to cover the cereal completely. Letting them cool on a lined pan before coating them with sugar was much easier than it would have been with them warm.

Great combination of chocolate, peanut butter and crunchy texture snack. I prefer the double boiler method in melting and blending the peanut butter rather than microwaving.

My first time having and making this.  Only made half the recipe.  I don't like sugary sweet desserts/treats.  It would be way too sweet for me as is - reduced the sugar by using 1:1 powdered sugar to arrowroot starch/flour.  Still on the sweet side, will try dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate next time.

Delicious stuff! I think I used more confectioners sugar than the recipe called for to fully coat the cereal. I found it easy to melt the ingredients in a slow cooker and mix with the cereal in there, but it is tricky to mix well if you dump all the cereal in at once- it's easier to start with a few cups, mix, then add more until it's all coated well.

Great snack option for my food allergy toddler when made with WOW Butter (R) and allergen free vanilla chips.  Also did a version with butterscotch chips only ... she preferred that one!  Delicious!

This is the same recipe that has been around since I was a kid in the nineties. It's been a favorite in our house since then. It's quick and easy. I like to add more chocolate though, and honestly, sometimes you need to add some more powdered sugar. I prefer putting the sugar and chocolate-coated cereal into a Tupperware container instead of a bag and then just tossing it around in there to get it coated. This recipe is fool-proof. Anybody can make this! It's so good it barely lasts a day at my house.

This little treat is always my go to for family with gluten allergies.  My Father-in-law had never heard of this until I made it for him and he was skeptical that it would be any good by just looking at it.  It is now one of his favorites too.

I use a mixture of chocolate chips and peanut butter chips. Followed the recipe from there and they turned out better than ever.

Great snack and easy to make. I recommend sifting the powdered sugar into the zip loc. That way you won't end up with clumps in your holiday favors.

The most addictive snack ever! If I don't bring these with me to Thanksgiving and Christmas, things can get ugly really fast. I make a few batches and place them in cookie tins and give them away so people don't fight. Simple, delicious and very cheap to make. What more could you want?
