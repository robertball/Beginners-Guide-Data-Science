Very light and crispy, even our non-filipino friends rave about these.  One recommendation, chill the dough before rolling into balls.

Wow!  I've been looking for this recipe after making it once a while ago.  I forgot the name and couldn't find it again.  I initially tried it because I was looking for a special recipe to make into a cookie that was similar to those puffy mint candies that you pop in your mouth and they melt into a fine, sweet, minty powder.  This recipe worked perfectly!  I added 1 tsp of peppermint extract, a tiny bit of pink food color and some crushed candy canes.  They were great!!!  Thanks for a great recipe and thanks, mizliz, for posting the picture that helped me find it again!

I think the recipe uses too much cornstarch. After bitting into one it taste like a ball of butter and cornstarch. I reccomend not making this recipe.

I learned to make these when i was in grade school but i lost my recipe.  I am glad to find this.  The cookies are like the way i remembered them:  they are light and crunchy, and it's hard to stop eating them!

These cookies are special.  I couldnÂ´t form the balls, since the batter was runny.  I froze them but they were still liquid!  So I put them in little molds.  Then I covered them with chocolate.  Great!

My daughter needed an asian dessert for a school project. This was easy and the cookies are great. We will put powder sugar on them next time. You need to have a drink with them. They are more like a biscutt than cookie.

My daughter needed a Philippine recipe for a potluck for Girl Scouts today.  We made them, and at first I was a little skeptical.  They turned out beautifully!

I thought I'd be doing my husband a favor baking these because he served a mission in Cebu for our church.  However, this recipe had way too much cornstarch and way too little flavor.

I have no frame of reference since I have never had authentic Puto Seco cookies. These were different - I added almond extract to give them more flavor and found them to be very light, but a little pasty when you eat them.

My 17 year old daughters tried making this cookie. Tasted alright, but the consistency wasn't very appealing. Like eating a cookie filled with powder that sticks to your mouth.

Then again, they're not really good at baking... at all.

My daughter from the Philippines tasted them without knowing I made these specially for her.  She immediately said egg nog cookies which meant they passed.  I found the cookie to be very light yet it has a tendency to kind of get a melt in your mouth stickiness.  They are oddly addicting but I think I would prefer a little flour in the cookie.  As they seemed to be exactly what my daughter remembers I give them 5 stars.

I tried the dough before baking and it was very bland and tasteless. I added vanilla to this recipe and it made a world of difference! Great recipe when you add vanilla

Really nice cookies. My boyfriend has been out of the Philippines for eight years so I made these for him. He said they tasted just like the ones back home!

Very good cookie. Don't know if i will ever make it again. It is a very fast cookie to make. Mine came out looking like a sugar cookie but tasted like a short bread.

Even though the cookies were a little on the dry side, they still were really good. Good flavor and great with a cup of hot tea. My daughter ate most of the cookies in one sitting.
