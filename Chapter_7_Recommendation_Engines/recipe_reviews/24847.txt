I made a few modifications to this recipe based on some of the other reviews.  The results were delicious and I will definitely make this dish again.  First off - I noticed that the recipe was not clear about whether to add the broth that the pork is cooked in to the sweet and sour sauce or not.  So I only added 1/2 cup of the broth and balanced it out with a bit more cornstarch (1 tsp) - this gave a nice thick consistency.  I also only used one can of pineapple tidbits and used pineapple juice instead of another can (1 cup juice plus the juice from the can of pineapple).  There's only so much pineapple a person can take...  It turned out well and everyone liked it!

This recipe was very good.  The only thing I changed was the amount of vinegar used.  My hubby likes his sweet and sour alittle on the sweet side so I used less.  I also drain the pork some before I add the sweet and sour because I seem to have too much water in it.  This has become a real favorite of mine.

Made this for dinner tonigght and have just a few problems with it. First off, the sauce is very runny, not as thick as the description would lead you to believe. I even cut the pineapple juice to 2 1/4 cans instead of 3. I used flour as a thickener instead of cornstarch because I didn't have any on hand, and I used 2 tablespoons instead of 1. Also increased brown sugar to 1 cup. Secondly, 3 cans of pineapple was way too much. I used just 2 cans and that was plenty for us. Finally, I'm not crazy about soy sauce but I was afraid if I left it out it would take something away from the flavor of the sauce. Just 3 tablespoons was enough for the soy sauce to be too overpowering for my taste. I would recommend leaving it out if you don't like it. I also decreased the vinegar to 1/2 cup because we tend to like sweet and sour sauce more on the sweet side. Overall, the sauce was good, and the pork was very tender and moist.

I have just started learning to cook and I like trying new dishes. My boyfriend is always honest with me when I try new recipes. We BOTH loved this. The best part was how simple it was. Thanks for sharing it.

This was okay, but it wasn't the dish I was expecting.  It was more like the sweet and sour stir-fry you can buy in the freezer section (but much better, of course, and more work) than the sweet and sour pork Chinese take-out I thought I was trying to make.  My mistake, not the recipe owner's.

I tried this a few months ago and forgot to rate it. This was really good, but I used boneless chicken breast in place of the pork. I also added some marachino cherries along with some of the juice from the cherries. Thanks Mary Ann!

Used left over pork and left out additional salt as I frequently find soy sauce overly salty.  Quite tasty when first prepared...but really gets its zip the next day.  The difference is worth preparing for...

This recipe was decent, although I would have changed a few things around.  There was WAY too much pineapple - I love pineapple but this amount was too hardcore, even for me!  Also, the sauce was disappointingly thin - I expected a much thicker, richer sauce than what I got.  Overall, though, it's not too bad.  I'll make this again but I think I'll improvise a bit....

This recipe was good.  I don't understand why people change the ingredients/method, then complain that they didn't like it.

I have never tried anything like this because because I thought it seemed too hard but this was easier than I thought. My family just LOVED IT. My husband said it's the best he's ever eaten anywhere. I cut back one can on the pineapple and added a little more cornstarch for thickness but kept everything else the same. My son asked when it would be on the menu next! Thank you.

Very easy and came out great!  My fiance couldn't stop telling me that it tasted "just like Chinese food!"  I think he means the kind that gets delivered in a box.  And I think it's a compliment!

Fabulous!  I added more onions and peppers and less pineapple (just my preference).  The gang I hang with cook for the 'gang' every Tuesday...  I made this recipe, doubled it for the size of the group and had others mouth watering!

I love love this recipe. I normally don't measure when I cook, so all the measurements were not exact, but it was great! Only thing I did differently is added red pepper and more than 1/2 cup onion. Yum! My family loved it and I will definitely make it again! Thanks!!

I started making this recipe, awhile back. I absolutely love this recipe. I posted the photo, so everyone can see how beautiful this recipes is when finished and served. This has become a regular meal, that the family loves. The only thing I do a bit different, is I add carrots. So Yummy

Really great sweet and sour receipe!  We added carrots and tomatoes and it came out delicious.  Be careful not to add too much salt to the water for the pork.

I have to admit I was just looking for a Sweet and Sour recipe as a guide, but with this recipe I had to make so many modifications I really can't say that it's the same recipe.  I will not however, under rate any recipe because of my modifications.
I was fixing the recipe for 2 people ( which I usually translate to 3) anyway, this is supposed to serve 8...with a 1/2 cup of onions?  I added 1 cup to my dish, I added a thinly sliced large carrot, 1 whole red pepper, I added 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1 full TBS corn starch. The rest of the ingredients were cut to 1/3.  After I was done we loved it...gave it 5 stars.  :-)

The directions were not clear!  We did not really like how this turned out however I see potential for this recipe.  I loved the tenderness of the pork.

This was a good recipe in a pinch. I had a butt end of a pork loin, and just a short amount of time to whip up dinner. I adjusted it to 2 servings as I didn't have much, and it only took about 30 minutes. 
I used only 1/3 of the vinegar, as we aren't big on the vinegar taste.

this is a good base recipe.   I added celery, carrots, mushrooms and some vermouth to the sauce.   I also only used one can of pineapple, which was plenty.

Sauce was a little thin, needs adjusting.
