Great mainade! It was definitely enough for 2 lbs. of pork tenderloin. I used low sodium soy sauce, 2Tbsp. of water and 2 Tbsp. of rice wine vinegar. I used olive oil vs. veg. oil and upped the brown sugar to 2 Tbsp. I let this marinate for a full 24 hours. With marinades, the longer the better some times.  I skewered the pork sepapate from the veggies (adding some onion) as they cook at different rates.

Yum!  We LOVED that the teriyaki sauce was from scratch and not from a bottle.  The pork was perfectly done when we made it, not dried out at all.  Since it's winter right now, we put these in the oven on 350 for about 40 minutes.  Yummy!

This was absolutely great.  I doubled the sauce because I used 2 lbs of pork tenderloin.  I added fresh pineapple, green pepper and onion.  I don't care for zucchini so I eliminated that.   I also marinated the pork for 2 days in the refrigerator.  I served the skewers with red beans and rice.  We will have this many times in the future.

My wife and I enjoyed this recipe very much. I Alternated red, yellow and green pepper, along with the rest of the ingredients.

When I make this recipe again I will use low sodium soy sauce because it isn't in my working schedule to marinade 1 to 4 hours, I marinated the meat with regular soy sauce overnight and it was quite salty.

I tried the Teriyaki Recipe with chicken, it was GREAT! There will be no more store bought teriyaki in my house! I added a little more ginger than called for, it was perfect.

YUM! I was very pleasantly surprised by how delicious these were. Everyone raved about them, and the only change I made was to alternate chunks of onion with the other veggies.

Made these for a catering job, they disappeared faster than the other kebabs. They were super flavorful, much better than the Pineapple Chicken Tenders from a/r that I made.

The marinade was quick and easy to put together.  I always use the low-sodium soy sauce to cut down on the salt.

These kabobs were wonderful. I doubled the recipe and it was delicious. They are easy to make and quick to cook. I used pork, mushrooms, green bell pepper, yellow squash, yellow onion, and cherry tomatoes. The pork was marinated for about 3 hours. Yum!! I will definitly make again.

The flavoring was perfect. This recipe was simple and makes for a nice change from grilling the entire loin. It takes less grilling time as well. This is a keeper!

I never thought of making Pork Kabobs because I had a misconception that it would turn out tough.  This recipe went to prove that I was wrong to think that way.  The taste was excellent.  It marinated for about about 6 hours.  Dinner had gotten delayed.  The only thing is that the pieces of meat were smaller than 1 1/4 in. and unfortunately DH burned it a bit.  I will definitely make this one again and use bigger cuts of Pork.

We first tried this recipe maybe 10 years ago and loved it for pork or beef.  We recently remembered those awesome kabobs we used to make so we went looking for this recipe again.  It's exactly what we remembered!  This time we used beef and let it marinate 24 hours.  We also added one bruised stalk of lemongrass to the marinade which made everything smell wonderful!  This recipe is awesome!

This was good but it was too much work for the outcome. Made as written, there is no way you can get 4 servings out of that unless you serve a side dish with it. I don't really get the appeal of kabobs, I feel it's easier to make veggie foil packets to serve with a grilled slab(s) of meat. This had a nice flavor but I won't be making again.

This marinade is really good. Next time I'll triple it and stir-fry some veggies with it for a side, and maybe add some other vegetable on the kabob.

I used squash and zucchini but followed the rest of the recipe. It was very tender and tasty!

This was my first time grilling kabobs and I don't think I could've chosen a better recipe! They were absolutely delicious!! Just make sure You marinate the meat long enough for great teriyaki flavor.I will definetly be serving these again at our next BBQ.

This was very tasty. I think I will marinate it a little longer nxt time or cut the pieces thinner, maybe in thin strips to hold more flavor. Will make again.

Good.  But it took alot longer to cook.  I grilled for about 35 minutes.  Meat was very tender.
