This is the 3rd Progresso Recipe Starter that I've tried, and it was as thin as the other two.  Since 1/2 cup of half-and-half was going into the recipe later, the first thing I did was cook the starter sauce down quite a bit and then add the chicken and ravioli.  Next I added a good handful of parmesan to the sauce which GREATLY improved the flavor and thickened the sauce.  Out of the can, the sauce was pretty bland, thin and really lacking basil flavor.  I used fresh bacon and boneless chicken breast and FF half-and-half.  The cooking method ultimately resulted in a pretty flavorful sauce, and we were happy with the meal but it took a lot more than 20 minutes to get it on the table.

Loved this one! It was a rough evening when I made this, I had 2 kids that needed to be picked up from activities, open house and a parents meeting that I had forgotten about. Luckily I had everything for this on hand so I thought I'd try it since its so quick. I used frozen ravioli I think it was an 11 oz package, homemade bacon bits and leftover cooked chicken. Dumped it all in the pan and let it simmer until it was done. I didn't use the full amount of half-and-half, just slowly added until it was the right consistency for out tastes. Also threw in some fresh grated Asiago cheese. I didn't have any fresh basil or parsley on hand so I topped with some green onion. Tasty, the family liked it and it was a dinner saver on a really hectic night. I would make this one again.

This is the third dish I've tried with the Progresso Recipe Starters and definitely the most impressive without changing the recipe too much.  I did add 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes, used freshly cooked crumbled bacon.  I did sub lobster/ricotta ravioli for the 4 cheese.

I thought this recipe was wonderful! I used to work at an Italian restaurant, and this recipe was very reminiscent of the Penne Carbonara dish that we sold there. I didn't add ravioli -- I simply served the sauce over penne noodles -- but the sauce was to die for! I was a bit concerned about the thickness of the sauce, but I let it simmer for a bit and then added a handful of cheese. Next time, I think I will try it with the ravioli!

We were not able to find progresso so we substituted pesto basil prego sauce. We cooked the bacon ourselves and used large chunks. It was unbelievably good and easy to make. Not very expensive either!

Quick, easy, and delicious!  My husband loved this recipe and it really only took 20 minutes.  I used fat free half and added fresh spinach the last few minutes.  The sauce was a little thin.  I'll probably add frozen peas instead of spinach next time, but will definitely make this again soon!

Very good and very easy!  I suggest melting some shredded parmesan directly into the sauce, as well as bacon pieces.

I really liked the sauce that this recipe makes...I thought it was a fantastic base.  I did not add ravioli into the sauce...had run out of ravioli, so I simmered the sauce separately, and when done, served it over linguine.  Slight changes:  I added pieces of bacon into the sauce and melted tons of freshly grated parmesan cheese into it as well.  It was amazing -- very restaurant quality.

Made this as stated for the kids with the exception of using my own grilled chicken since I didn't have what the recipe called for and it was very good especially for the ease. For the grown ups I sauteed some mushrooms, baby spinach, and roma tomatoes I had lurking around threatening to go bad. In the end all I had to do was toast some garlic bread for a complete meal. Will totally make this one again.  Loved by the entire family!

Excellent recipe. I sauted chicken tenderloins in a bit of the bacon drippings.  I also added chopped onion and garlic to the chicken as it sauteed. Added the fresh chopped basil and s&p to taste at the end. (and skipped parmesan since I served it over rice).  Husband and 16 year old son loved it.  Served with asparagus.

I was looking for a sauce for my cheese ravioli.  This sauce was perfect and the taste is wonderful.  I followed the recipe as is however let the sauce cook down a bit.  It turned out wonderful.

My hubby & I loved this recipe.  We will definitely make it again.  I used real bacon, crumbled, & added some Italian blend shredded cheese on top.  Omitted the basil, parsley.
