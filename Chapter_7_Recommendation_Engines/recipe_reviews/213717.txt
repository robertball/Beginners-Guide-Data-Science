This came out wonderful.  I love savory breakfasts and this really hits the spot!  I multiplied by about 10 and used 36 eggs.  Our staff really enjoyed it.  Thank you!

Delicious. I made it exactly as written. Wish I had thought to buy pitas, but serving it with toast was still really good!

Absolutely awesome! We made this for breakfast and loved it! It is so filling and delicious. I shared the recipe with my parents who are big breakfast eaters and they loved it too! I will definitely make this again! Goes great with toast, hash browns or all by itself. If you are hesitant don't be you will really enjoy this!

My husband came home from Israel raving about this dish. Used this recipe and it was fantastic. I double, triple or even quadruple the sauce, then freeze it in batches so we can have it regularly without having to chop onion first thing in the morning. I sometimes substitute shallots for the onion because I prefer shallots, but it is delicious either way!

Having recently returned from Israel, I was delighted to find this recipe.  I added a 1/3 cup of sliced green olives.  It was delicious!

Wasn't bad. Had leftovers for breakfast the next day. As a dinner, would be better served over a carb such as rice or mashed potatoes, I think.

I cooked this dish for my new in-laws (and I am VERY new to cooking!) I studied abroad in Israel, and I wanted to make something special and different. I thought "chakcouka" would be awesome if I could pull it off ...This recipe is perfect! The directions were easy to follow, it was colorful, flavorful, and delicious. I will be making it again soon!!!

Simply amazing! I used red onion and substituted the chili pepper with red cayenne spice and a jalapeno. The flavor is undeniable and the texture is superb. The dish is just spicy enough to make it interesting. I highly recommend this!

I made this today, with a couple small changes due to what I had on hand. I only had green onions, so used those, and also used a whole red habanero instead of a chili pepper. I had a couple Morningstar veggie sausage patties I browned up and crumbled in it, too, and served it for lunch over ready-to-serve Italian Minute Rice. The only thing we decided I'd do differently is cook less time once the eggs are in, because we'd prefer a runnier yolk. Other than that, my husband and I both loved it!

Very good.  Makes 2-3 servings if this is the primary dish.  Chipotle Tabasco at the table instead of the chile pepper allows for different heat levels at time of serving.

This is a great recipe, but I recommend using at least a tbsp each of cumin and smoked paprika, and I finish it with fresh cilantro. I also like to add browned lamb or pork sausage (without the casings) at the beginning. Serve it with naan bread, and you have an awesome breakfast.

Thanks for posting this--saves me having to call friends in Tunisia as I always forget an ingredient.  I first had it at the home of some new Tunisian friends in the late 1960s and learned that to refer to Shakshooka in Arabic means throwing in a bunch of seasonal ingredients on hand (but something like a disorganized dresser drawer could also be described as "Shakshooka"). Like cous-cous and briks I look forward to eating it every time I go back to Tunisia, but need reminders when I try to make it in the U.S.  I'm kind of thinking there is parsley in it too sometimes?  At least I add some.

This was great! My husband loved it. The only thing I would change it to half the salt since it was a bit salty for my taste but otherwise it was great.

Delicious and nutritious, low-carb easy one-pot breakie.  I like lots of veggies however, so I added more peppers, small cauliflower bits and some zucchini (near the end). Also really easy to turn it into a Greek dish (substitute oregano, olives and feta) or Italian (sub oregano, basil and Parmesan).

Pretty tasty and easy to eat. I listened to another members idea to try it with tortilla shells and liked it that way for sure. It cut down the strong flavor just enough.

I love shakshouka and this is the recipe that I use. In Israel, this is usually served in the pan and some restaurants cook it right at your table. A great thing about shakshouka is that you can make it "your own" with personal additions of vegetables that you like to the sauce. Yummy yummy.

This is a great recipe. I made it as directed. My skillet is enameled cast iron and it took a little longer than 10 minutes to cook off the juices from the tomatoes. The consistency and flavor was great and my husband approved. We had it for dinner with a side of Spanish rice.

Fast, easy, and savoringly flavorful! I eliminated the bell peppers, added cayenne and this herb chevre spread into the mix after the rest is simmering before the eggs, and put half the salt, and it was amazing! Great recipe.

This was super simple and quick to make. It was flavorful as well as nutritious. Cilantro goes really well with these kind of flavors. Good meal to have for brunch along with bread.

This was quite tasty. I did it once as is for a light meal. The second time I made a roux and served it over rice. It is spicy, but delicious.

I’m surprised how good this was. Kind of skeptical with the dish as I am not a vegetable lover. Served it with just the microwavable quinoa over lunch (Path of Life Mediterranean Quinoa) as that was the only carb available at that time. I was surprised about the weird but perfect combo. My 13 month old twins loved it too.

I loved it and served with a thick bread so we could scoop up the sauce.  Even my 12 year old stopped long enough to smell and eat.  This is a regular in our house. Am constantly looking for more recipes like this. How great to have this type of love everyday.  The smell alone is yummy in the kitchen.

I have made this for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It works for any time of the day. The flavors in this meld so well together. The only change I make is omitting the hot pepper, I just use a little cayenne pepper for some spice.

Maybe it was the lack of paprika, but the mixture as a whole turned out rather watery and tasteless. I followed the recipe fairly exactly - perhaps I should have give the chopped tomatoes more time to dry out and pancake.

I made this last night, following the recipe exactly.  It was good, though I kept thinking it lacked something.  At the risk of destroying the true ethnicity of the recipe, I think that if I make it again I will add a can of black beans and perhaps some pieces of sausage.

Absolutely delicious! I first had this dish in Israel and loved the simplicity of it. Filling, healthy, and easy. I used homemade canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh and it still turned out great.

I'd give 6 stars if I could!! Up until now I would regularly spend $13 at a local Israeli deli for this dish, but now I can make one that tastes even better for a fraction of the cost! Can't believe how easy it is too! Used a red chili from the farmers market and kept the seeds in to make it extra spicy ;) Also used smoked paprika instead of regular for that smoky kick. Will definitely be making this many more times!! Thank you Ben!!!

Great healthy recipe that my boyfriend and I loved, although this was maybe not quite as creamy and rich as some of the varieties I tried in Israel. I made some plain couscous and added the shakshouka on top… that's not a traditional preparation as far as I know but it was good. 

I used green bell peppers, which added some color to the dish. Also used what looked like a chile pepper but it wasn't hot at all; I think some heat would've improved the dish so definitely don't skip the chile if you like that sort of thing. We did add some black pepper for additional flavor at the end, which was just what the dish needed. 

I did find that I had to add a few minutes to the cooking time for most of the steps, but other than that, I basically followed the recipe and it worked well.

I love huevos rancheros and actually found this recipe while doing a search for a recipe for that. This seemed exotic and interesting and I like trying new things. I enjoyed it and would probably make it again but I can't say it jumped to the front of my list of favorite breakfast recipes.

We loved this!  Ate it for dinner.  Made exactly as written, except I used 1 -28 oz. can of San Marzano tomatoes, didn't have fresh.  Next time I may use only the tomatoes without the puree, it took a little longer to cook off the excess liquid of the tomato juice, not a big deal, however.  Didn't have a hot pepper, used 1/4 t. cayenne instead, could use more if you like more heat.  
Would be delicious with mushrooms, carrots, spinach, kale etc...endless options.  Will definitely make again

I didn't care for the flavor. It was ok, but not great. I used 1/2 tsp of cumin because cumin is a strong spice. I served it over a baked potato. Followed it exact and it was not a favorite with my family. I will not make it again.

Finally made this. Just loved the simplicity and taste. Needs a base for serving such as reice, grits or fried potatoes

Going to try using a can of salsa next time. Basically a different version of huevos rancheros.

My family and I really like this recipe.  It is easy to make and has a good flavor.  I used a can of chopped tomatoes with chillies because I didn't have any jalapenos and added mushrooms because I had them. I recommend trying this dish!

Made as per the recipe. Perfect in my opinion. I've been making something similar and then finishing it in the oven. Duh! Just keep cooking it and cover. One more for my bag of delious quickies. Thanks sooo much. Okay, technically I lied. I added Parmesan onto before I covered it.??

Never make a dish incorporating tomatoes in cast iron. At the least it'll make the dish taste metallic and at worst strip the seasoning from your skillet! 

How this ever got past editorial in amazing.

Great flavors - breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Canned tomatoes are the way to go and bottled hot sauce or red pepper flakes.  Faster. Also, makes a lot of sauce. Easy to save the sauce you didn't use for the next meal/occasion.  Tweak to taste.

This was wonderful.  The eggs take on the flavor of the sauce nicely.  We had this for dinner, so I served it with rice and a few warmed up pitas.  My family preferred the pitas over the rice.

This is a flavourful way to serve eggs for breakfast, or a breakfast supper.  It has just  the right amount of spice.   Serve it with pita bread.

Best recipe. Made shakshouka before, but turned out a bit meh. This recipe makes a difference because it uses fresh tomatoes, something I did not do before. I cover the pan to let the tomatoes soften better and cook thoroughly, for the 10 described minutes, then take off the lid to evaporize excess liquid. P.s. this does need a heavy carb beside it because it is very light, even bread sometimes isnt enough as a dinner. I do oven roasted potatoes. Traditionally this is wrapped in thin bread sometimes to make a 'shakshouka sandwich'. Shakshouka is a Middle Eastern dish, not just Tunisian or Israeli, by the way.

This is a dish you’ll find in Syria and Lebanon a lot. To turn it into dinner, I add cooked ground beef to the sauce, and serve it with rice!!!! Home made pickles and life is good (:

Amazing! I added about 1 teaspoon of garam masala to the tomato sauce. I used a local brand (Oliverio's) Peppers in place of the tomatoes, because it is green and red peppers in tomatoes. I added a not so hot chopped jalapeno pepper. I put in 6 eggs instead of 4. I had to cook the eggs a little longer than 5 minutes; more like 8 minutes. Really amazingly good. I know I'll make this again. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe.

This was truly magnificent. Had it first time at an organic whole grain super expensive place came home looking for the recipient. Found it here!  Amazing perfect recipe. No need to change anything and very friendly if you do (I added mushrooms and 1 jalapeño seeds removed - I like a little kick). I made a double batch and froze in serving size containers and had great bfast the following week with no effort at all).  Try it TODAY!!

It was good, didn't have a hot chile pepper but added red pepper flakes that seemed to work.  Big disappointment was that the egg gets lost in the dish and is hard to judge how well it is cooked.  I will try it again because it was different and interesting.

Brought into a work breakfast potluck and received several compliments!  I doubled the recipe, placed into two aluminum foil casserole dishes, added six eggs to each dish, and baked them until the eggs were no longer translucent.  Will use this recipe again!

Prepared this to direction with two exceptions: 1) minced a fresh jalapeno instead of a chile, and 2) used smoked paprika in the place of sweet paprika. It turned out amazing! I would use these same substitutions next time too.

Wonderful dish. Made it for breakfast and eating as I’m typing. Yummy!  I did add a couple things others might not like, but I added bacon. And instead of using tomato and chili separate, I added a can of Rotel. 10/10 will make again.

Made this dish this morning and it was delicious.   I used all fresh ingredients,  plus the spices listed.. I added 1-1/2 tsp. of brown sugar in order to neutralize the tomato acids and it worked. nicely.

The seasonings make it so delicious.  The first time I ever experienced this dish was when an Israeli chef made it for us at a B and B in Hawaii.  The flavors from this recipe were a wonderful memory of that trip.  The only thing I would do differently next time is chop the bell peppers into smaller pieces.  We always have more fresh garden tomatoes than we can handle every summer, and this was a perfect way to make use of them.  An additional step was I needed to strain out some of the excess water because they are much juicier than store bought tomatoes.

Delicious! I subbed in cayenne, and I added some tomato paste and 1/4 cup of chicken stock to help it along. 
Served over couscous with feta cheese on top and a side of roasted asparagus

Great, and I mean great. For years I have been reluctant to make this dish I'm now sorry I waited so long. Give it a try. I use vine ripen tomatoes from  the super market or even canned whole tomatoes. I kick up the heat by using more or  different hot peppers.

Very good recipe, easy to make and a good vegetarian dish for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  The flavors are perfect with the cumin. You can spice it up or not depending on your tastes.

I did add some fresh herbs i had including oregano, basil and sage. I finely chopped them and added them with the tomato mixture.  I also used a half a habanero thinly sliced but i sauteed it along with the other peppers. the dish was spicy but no overly spice (pepper was seeded and membrane removed). 

We loved this dish and I served if over Farro for a dinner meal. It was delicious. Try this dish as she has written it it's perfect.

It was absolutely delicious, and was an exciting breakfast for my family, since we usually only eat scrambled eggs for breakfast. I did substitute mushrooms for the peppers, but it still tasted amazing!!!

40 minutes? !  It takes me about 10 to 15 minutes total to make this.  I use canned diced tomatoes or Rotel.  Add Italian herb mix, heat, add eggs and cover.  Cooks in about 5 minutes.  Just check whites to see if the eggs are done.  I serve this over steamed tortillas.

I made this for breakfast and followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious. I used 3 different color peppers  and it added nice color. If you like them,  I think you can do more than the recipe calls for. I do think it would work for any meal and I might try them for dinner next time. We're big meat eaters so I am always happy to find a recipe that's filling and delicious and packed with vegetables. This definitely hit the mark.

I used a serrano pepper for the chile pepper... turned out much better than expected!!!  The combination of veggies and egg was scrumptious!  It is a great breakfast and one I have made multiple times and want to make again.  Second time: used a jalapeno and sprinkled some dill into the tomatoes; turned out even better.

Loved it!  I used canned crushed tomatoes and added an 8-oz bag of fresh spinach to wilt (I added spinach after sauteing the onion/peppers/garlic and before adding the tomatoes and spices).  I omitted the hot pepper.  Also, I was able to fit in 5-6 eggs in my large skillet.

This was my first time eating this. The meal is not particularly to my taste but I think me, not the recipe. The recipe was very easy to make.

I was surprised by how much I liked this, since I'm not a bell pepper fan at all, but needed some good Whole30-friendly dishes to keep from burning out.

Used a jalapeño because my grocery store labels all their chili peppers and this recipe wasn't specific on the type. Crowded 6 eggs in and a couple broke during cooking, which might have been a good thing, actually, since it let some yolk escape into the sauce. I was a little iffy on the doneness of the eggs after 5 minutes, so I let it cook for about an extra minute and a half and ended up with perfect gooey yolks.

Will definitely make again.

A Middle Eastern version of Huevos Ranchero! Very tasty and simple to prepare.  I used a 28oz canned of drained diced tomatoes instead of fresh.  The recipe made enough for two meals of 5 eggs.. Add a warm naan and this meal will satisfy your hunger.

This was really good.  I cut the portion down to two eggs, and I added halved, cooked lamb meatballs near the end just to heat through.   Served it with warm naan.

Great easy recipe!  I wanted a little green, so I added about 1/4 cup fresh chopped parsley.  I used an orange sweet pepper. I also had to have a slice of toasted whole wheat bread with it! :)

This was very good. I followed the directions as much as possible, only changed type of onion and pepper because it was what I had on hand. I used a bunch of green onions and Anaheim pepper. Was more savory then spicy. Mild enough that my 5 and 6 year old children enjoyed it. I served it for a meatless dinner option. The review is for the recipe as written, however I added goat cheese sprinkled on top which my family enjoyed.

This was excellent! The flavour and the texture were perfect. The only thing I would say is that you could probably get six eggs out of this. I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only adjustments I made were that I put eight eggs in and used smoked paprika instead. Love this Palestinian dish!

This was delicious and very easy to make! I used Spanish smoked paprika and a milder Anaheim pepper because the store didn't have a chili pepper. Definitely will try with a spicier pepper next time.

I hesitate over my rating for this, because it was fine except for the amount of cumin. Turns out my husband really doesn't care for cumin. If I try this again, I'll use different seasonings.

This is marvelous! I used 2 large cans of my favorite tomato sauce and omitted the peppers. I served it with low carb biscuits. So tasty and easy! You may have to experiment with the timing and temperature to get the eggs poached just right. After 5 minutes, one weren’t cooked. I turned up the heat a bit until they were perfect!

This was absolutely delicious. Next time, I will think to make pita bread to serve it with - but was wonderful on it's own! We were able to fit an additional egg in, but still had a few peppers & onions left over due to eating it straight. I tossed the leftovers (no egg) in with chicken the following morning to make a fajita omelette topped with salsa and it was also devine.

I must have chopped up slightly less than recommended for the tomatoes because I didn't have nearly as much juice to boil down as shown. However, the final product was still delicious! Once I figure out how to chop up everything quickly, this will become a staple dish in my house!

This dish was super easy to make, and it was delicious!  It is also very low calorie.  I made it for dinner and had leftovers for breakfast.  It can really work for any meal.  

SUBSTITUTIONS:  For the chopped tomatoes, I substituted a 14.5 oz can of crushed tomatoes and an 8 oz can of tomato sauce, because I'm not a fan of tomato chunks. 

ALTERATIONS:  I was able to fit 5 eggs, instead of 4, and I had plenty of sauce.  I also scooped mine onto a mini corn tortilla (street taco size) and added a little sour cream.

I’ve never had this dish before but sounded interesting. I’m glad I tried it!! It was so easy to made & tasted so good!! I made as directed except I used a good teaspoon and a half of chili paste since I was out of Chile peppers. Next time I will add a little more.

Don't let the simplicity fool you - this dish is delicious. I used one large onion, one large red bell pepper, a 28oz can of diced tomatoes (did not drain), and I used red pepper flakes instead of dicing a pepper. I used 6 eggs instead of 4 and doubled the cumin and paprika. I also cooked quite a bit longer (probably 20 min) to harden the egg yolk since we like them that way. Will make again for sure!

I like this!  I would like a little less of the tomato flavor so perhaps something else added to the tomato base would be good.  I also served it over polenta and it was great!

This is a pretty good recipe. I'm not sure that I will include cumin next time. I also have a simpler recipe that I usually use, but it takes a much longer period of time to make. This will be a decent go-to when I'm craving it, but don't have a lot of time to cook.

I love this dish!  It's delicious as written, but sometimes I change it and use canned tomatoes or add zucchini or other veggies.  It takes well to adaptations and it's always delicious.  I usually serve it as a light supper with garlic bread.  My kids love it too.

Made it as written; I wasn't sure if I was going to like it but it worked! Next time though person preference I will half the amount of green pepper, or use red instead. Recipe calls for any color.

A great and quite filling dish. Ate it with pita bread. I did not have a chilli pepper or garlic cloves at the time so I used Tobasco sauce  and garlic powder as a substitute. Those worked out very well.

This is probably a great breakfast- if you like cooked tomato with your eggs- but for me, I  probably going to have to pass know this in the future.

This was a new flavor for me, especially for eggs!   Make sure to salt and season your vegetables.  Super easy, super cheap, breakfast to dinner flexible, and an amazing flavor (eggs poached in tomato, pepper sauce).  5 stars no doubt.  Freeze 1 cup servings for perfect individual serving when desired.   Heat it to a boil and toss in an egg.  Add butter to finish!

Very flavorful and fresh.  I added in some feta cheese and green onions at the end for some extra texture and flavor and served it with pita on the side. Next time I will follow another users advice serve it over mashed potatoes to make it a little more filling.

Very, very good! Did make a couple changes to serve it for dinner. Added ground sausage to appease the hubby and served it over brown rice. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. We both thought it was very tasty.

The dish had great flavor and went well with rice.  I thought it was a little too salty, though I did leave the tomato and spice mixture to permeate longer than what the instructions called for.  This causes the tomatoes to lose their moisture faster which speed up the cook time. Next time less salt but more vegetables.

Another great idea to diversify your breakfast. The only thing I'd add is a bit of a sweetener as it comes out a little sourish-bitter. But I don't eat added sugar anyway, so it's fine as it is...:)

Delicious!  This is a great blend of flavors.  I used drained canned tomatoes with spices.  I like my eggs cooked, so I cooked them covered for roughly 10-12 minutes.   I would definitely make this again!

I LOVED this!  I actually put it over black beans for added protein which was a really good addition. I food prep each Sunday and ate this for breakfast four days in a row and it never got old! The base sauce is wonderful and could be used with other types of meals as well. I added a few extra spices and a little habanero salsa but other than that, it was really wonderful!

Kicked up the cumin, garlic, and paprika. Decreased the salt. Used canned diced tomatoes with green chilis and a small pinch of dried red peppers instead of fresh hot pepper. Also... Red onion and red pepper for looks. The whole family liked it, and they rarely agree on what's good. Would've been a 5 if it had more "kick" as written, but I don't give a five star rating when I have to significantly adjust the spices. Still a really good dish.

This recipe is amazing! I loved it! I made it as breakfast and it was just the kind of thing I was looking for. I just added a bit of chopped parsley, pepper, and a bit of Parmesan cheese on top. I can definitely recommend this recipe!

It was "good, but not great." It tasted exactly like you'd expect: a lot of tomato with some egg and spices. I probably won't make it again considering breakfast allows for much quicker, tastier alternatives.

We really enjoyed this recipe. While I love being able to use the abundant tomatoes and peppers from the summer garden, this is more of a fall or winter dish for us. I served it on grits for brunch but could also see serving it on biscuits or English muffins.

The only change I made was using canned diced tomatoes because that's what I had on hand.  This is a wonderfully simple and tasty dish!  I love that that the ingredients were things I happened to have already.  I will absolutely make this again!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Served it over mexican rice that I had in the freezer, with a side of sliced avocado.  I only had grape tomatoes so mixed them with a little homemade tomato sauce

Yummy, a little tomato-y but if you squishy the yolk on it, it mellowed a bit.  The flavors together with egg were very good.

I have 7 chickens and am always looking for ways to use our abundance of eggs.  This fit the bill!  I didn't have enough fresh tomatoes so I used canned stewed tomatoes instead.  The canned tomatoes worked out just fine.  The spices made it really tasty too.  I recently got one of those spiralizer tools that make noodles from zucchini (and other veges) so I decided to try it out and make some zucchini noodles to serve this on.  I sprinkled some fresh grated Parmesan cheese over the eggs as well.  It made a wonderful dinner.  Not only was it delicious but it was low cal and low carb as well.  Of course if you  aren't worried about keeping it low cal and low carb some crusty garlic bread or bread sticks would go great!

Excellent!  Made as posted, using two fresh tomatoes.  served it with toast.  I think the fresh tomatoes, not canned, and the toast were important.  Will make it again.  Thank You for posting.

Followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic. Had it both over bread and over rice two separate times. I also used drained canned tomatoes on both occasions and it came out beautifully. A new staple!

*Edit*
Using salt when using the canned tomatoes will make it too salty. If you're using salt, use fresh tomatoes instead!

Made this and everyone I served it to loved it. Definitely worth making and will be in my  repertoire of breakfast dishes. I served alone and left the yokes kind of soft but not runny it was heaven.

Growing up, in Morocco,  we had this dish quite often. College students live on it..
This egg dish is common all over North Africa. The spices and their amounts here, are spot on.The peppers can be omitted, and the chopped parsley sprinkled on top adds a nice flavor.

So good. Didn't have any paprika so i used about 1/2 teaspoon chili powder and 1/2 teaspoon cayenne since we like a spicier breakfast anyway. I also used a bunch of jalapeno instead of the chile it called for. I also served with 2 slices of multigrain toast.

Not sure why all the rave reviews on this recipe.  We had it tonight for a light dinner and it was pretty much just bland.  I made the recipe exactly as directed, didn't change one thing and still, it was just okay.  Not sure how it could be made better but I may try it again.  Hubby said it was okay but just lacked any taste.  So I'm confused about what others got that I didn't.

I made it for dinner and it was great! I added a sprinkle of cheese and dollop of sour cream on top just for a little extra something. Will make it again for any meal. Super easy and tasty.

This is amazing!!! It's so spicy easy and delicious!!!! Just make sure you cover you pan when cooking the eggs. I didn't and it took them forever to reach the right consistency.

Very good! I was only cooking for one so I quartered the recipe to make a single serving and wow! I don't like ordinary breakfasts and this had enough flavor to satisfy my taste! Definitely making again and would recommend to anyone :)
