Didn't add any veggies except for cabbage.  Just lazy I guess. Added  2 extra cups of water because I like stews/soups real brothy. I also added more of the amount of spices it asks because flavor is important in this portuguese home. And tons of onion powder, because I love it, salt & pepper.  Also added that tip about white beans...good call!  So yummy on a cruddy day!
