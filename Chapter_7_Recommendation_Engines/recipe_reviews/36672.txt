This recipe is awesome!  I think it tastes wonderful with a little ice cream dolloped on top!  If you like raspberries, then you'll like this.

I found this cake to be delightfully scrumptious.  I made it very late one night and in a tired state of mind, and forgot to add the sliced almonds to the topping.  The cake came out so smooth and delicate in texture and flavor that I actually think that the sliced almonds weren't necessary, it seemed to just melt in my mouth! The almond extract was just the right amount for an amaretto type taste. Serving it with a flavored coffee such as hazlenut or french vanilla would be a nice compliment to the crumb cake.

The next time that I make this cake, I will try it with the almonds, only I might chop them up finely to add to the crumb mixture to keep it crumbly.

Very good - light & moist.  Great dessert if you are trying to go light on the calories & fat (not too many carbs either!)

Easy and excellent. I confess that I already had full-fat sour cream and cream cheese on hand, so I used those, and it came out perfectly. Used a 9" pan and baked for 25 minutes, just right. Moist, light, delicious. I'll try it again with the low-fat ingredients because I'm sure it'll taste just as great. Also, my kids scarfed it down, which always makes a recipe a winner.

I find almond extract to be very artificial in taste, even with just 1/2 tsp, so I used about 1/8 tsp of almond extract and a touch more vanilla extract. Cake came out wonderful in texture and flavor. A definite keeper.

This cake is incredibly good. It is moist, and has the perfect blend of raspberry and almond flavor. When adding the crumb topping, make sure the edges are covered with crumbs. If they arn't, they will swell up unevenly and look unappealing.

Lovely!  I made this for Christmas Eve and we enjoyed it with friends.  I think next time I would add almond extract to the liquid mixture.  The only almond flavoring, as is, is derived from the slivered almonds on top.  That's just not almond-y enough for me.

This is out of this world delicious!  We picked fresh raspberries and blackberries.  I also added 1/3c white chocolate chips on top of the raspberries.  I used a 6" cake pan and just baked it five or ten minutes extra...keeping an eye on it of course.  Not only is it delicious, but it is beautiful as well.
