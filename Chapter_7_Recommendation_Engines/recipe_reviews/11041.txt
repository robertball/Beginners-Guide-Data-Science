These "Magic Marshmallow Crescent Puffs" have been popular since 1969--especially appealing to kids, but to adults alike! Since the marshmallow melts as it bakes, it is important to make sure the edges are really sealed well--if not, the center will ooze out and you'll lose much of that sweet goodness. This is a great recipe to make with kids--it's easy, they love the finished product, and they are really pleased with themselves!

We have made these in our family for at least 30 years and call them "Marshmallow Sweet Rolls", but we do not use flour, nuts or the glaze . Just dip the marshmallow in the butter and then in the sugar/cinnamon and roll them up to bake (We bake them in Muffin tins). These have to be made just before serving for the best taste, but I love them cold as well. The marshmallow melts and leaves the inside with an ooey gooey sweet glaze.
They are SOOOOOOO good and not a holiday goes by without them. We have twin 2 year olds who now help Mom make them and eat them and my Hubby as well as my sisters Hubby had never heard of such a roll, but now they are as addicted as we all are.

I love this recipe.  I found it when I was just totally inspired by marshmallows and wanted to make something besides rice krispy treats.  This was so much more amazing than expected.  I halved the recipe because I just wanted to test it.  I also didn't do a very good job of following the directions either, and it was still AMAZING!  I just made them two days ago and my husband already wants them again.  They might be a new favorite holiday treat.  The only things I changed that I would suggest is adding the remainder of the cinnamon mixture into the glaze for some added kick.  I guess I also dipped the buttered top into the cinnamon mixture before baking too.  Extremely pleased!

I was looking for a quick dessert recipe given what I had on had, and this matched so I gave it a try!  Really tasty and sticky and sugary!  Wouldn't recommend for anyone worried about getting messy though - this is definitely not a company dessert, unless your company is a bunch of 8 year olds for a sleepover ;-)

This is a yummy recipe and very fun to play with variations. My favorite is dipping the marshmallows in spiced rum then butter and then rolling them in brown sugar. Then I brush the top of the pastry with more rum and butter and sprinkle with brown sugar and cinnamon.

Fun and easy recipe... definitely one of the kids favorites.  It's so good that we rarely use the glaze because they're usually consumed right out of the oven... no one wants to wait.  They're best while still warm.

These were surprisingly good!! I made them with my grandchildren and we had a lot of fun making them! As one reviewer wrote, make sure the edges are  completely sealed or you may end up with the marshmallows leaking out.

AMAZING! Like a cinamon roll. I only needed half of the butter called for. I cannot stress the importance of making sure these guys are sealed up all the way! You get a big sticky mess to clean up. Unfortunately, I didn't have the ingredients to make the topping, but rolled the marshmallows in the butter, then sugar, then pecans. I'm sure the topping makes these puffs even better!

These were great...except for the fact that I apparently didn't seal them tightly enough...I ended up with a sticky sloppy mess that tasted pretty fantastic anyway!

Yikes!  Thank goodness for my Silpat!  I obviously did not firmly seal the edges because they had all leaked out when I took them out of the oven.  I baked them on a cookie sheet covered with a Silpat, so it cleaned up very easily though.  I also used chocolate marshmallows for Pain au chocolat.  Despite bursting open, they were delicious!  I'll be more careful to pinch the seals next time! ;)

I have eaten these for years and they are a family favorite! The recipe (without the nuts) was actually a Pillsbury bake-off grand prize winer in the early 70's! My kids beg for this every Saturday morning!

Very tasty, the marshmallow came out during baking, maybe I didn't close the sides well enough. Will try again, with more butter on the inside!

I have been  dreaming of this recipe since I last had it in the sixties! It was one of my favorites and I'm thrilled to have found it again. We didn't roll the crescent dough up, but placed the Marshmallow in the center and brought the 3 corners up to meet at the top, and squeezed it all together. We used melted butter, not just softened, and didn't use nuts, although I will now try it that way. Since I couldn't make it for my daughters, I will now make it with my granddaughters!! Thank you so much!

I've been making these since I was in elementary school.  They're so easy and turn out awesome.  Just make sure you seal up the crescent roll well so that the marshmallow explodes inside the roll instead of gobbering up your oven.  Also reduced fat rolls still taste excellent.

Very good.  I think these would be great as a breakfast roll.  They kind of put me in the mind of a Cinnamon Roll.  Very easy to make also.

"I made these with my kids. Uch, they were great Heather. I'm a teacher and I almost lost a whole period and I just told my second graders 'Kids, were cooking today.' They were extatic. Thanks.
