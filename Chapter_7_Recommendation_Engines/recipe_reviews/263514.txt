Amazing recipe & one of our most favorites!!! After making it many times I’ve made some tweaks that made it just right for us - I use low sodium chicken broth instead of stock for more flavor, and I use 4 cups of broth + 2 cans of cream of chicken. Also, turning the instant pot to “saute” while placing the *dumplings/wonton wrappers in only causes them to clump & burn to the bottom more. I turn the instant pot off for this step, put the shredded chicken back in, add the sliced wonton wrappers next, stir and then stew again. Delish!

*If you’re unable to find frozen dumpling wrappers in your local store, you can use wonton wrappers. I buy the fresh refrigerated pack in the produce section, then slice them into thick strips similar to an egg noodle. (I still haven’t managed to find dumpling wrappers at any of the 4 different chains I’ve checked locally)

We weren’t able to find the frozen dumplings at our local grocery store so we substituted those for some buttermilk biscuits and cut them up into 1/8ths. Our pressure cooker gave us a burn error in the 3rd step but it all worked out just fine. This recipe is Definitely going in our recipe book and a great starter for beginner pressure cookers like us.

This is very tasty and fairly easy to make. This was also my first time using the Instant Pot, so it's a learning process. I should have turned the pot off of saute sooner than I did because I burned some of the dumplings on the bottom once I put it back on stew. My pot said BURN so I knew to stop it cooking and check it. Thus the dish was not ruined and tasted great.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!
