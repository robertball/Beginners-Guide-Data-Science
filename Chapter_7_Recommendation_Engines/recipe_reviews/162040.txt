I took this to a family gathering and everyone loved it!  I did add to the dressing a little; it seemed a little too tart so I added some sugar and dijon mustard to taste, a splash more vinegar and some black pepper.  The dressing appeared thick at first but thinned out nicely as the berries thawed.

3 stars as written but with some tweaking, was much tastier and is worth making.  First off, way too much cinnamon as listed in the directions. I cut this back to one heaping teaspoon and found that to be plenty.  I used salted cashews, as I like the salty/sweet combo.  Add a bit less vinegar, and add more if you think it needs it.  I also added about 1/4 of a cup of white sugar, as I thought the dressing was waaaaay to tart & tangy with frozen, unsweetend raspberries and also added some salt & pepper and 1/3 of a small onion before I pulsed it all together in the food processor.  I drizzled in the olive oil through the hopper and it emulsified nicely.  Dried cranerries can be used if you don't have cherries.  I also sprinkled the feta on seperately on the serving plates.  It was a good salad..worth making again.  I think finely shredded swiss cheese would taste good instead of feta, too and my try next time!

The salad was good, but the instructions for candying the nuts are not!  I ended up with burnt sugar and a melted spoon.  Search this site for a better recipe that includes WATER in the instructions.  
I used strawberries in place of raspberries.  The dressing was quite tasty.

The dressing was to tart, but salad is good with a different dressing.
The nut candy process was a litle off also.
