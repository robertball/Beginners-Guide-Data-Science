Delicious! Very bright and colorful dish (see photo). The only thing I did differently was to add some chunks of mozzarella to bring it closer to a real caprese recipe. It would be just as good without. Also added salt and pepper at the table. This dish is versatile too. My Dad eats meat and I don't, so I just added his precooked chicken to the dish after taking my portion out. Five full stars for this delicious dish that I will most definitely make again, especially as the weather gets warmer and the veggies are even fresher! Thanks so much for posting this Ebwallace!

It was very good! I did add cubed mozzarella like another reviewer suggested. I added sausage instead of chicken.

I subbed the chicken breast for chicken,spinach and asiago sausages, fried and chopped, I used the tiny tomatoes, halved, bc it's what I had, and I didn't have any asparagus (refuse to buy it, too $$) I subbed the shallots for onion. The first time I made this, it was good, but not quite enough sauce. The second time, I upped the sauce and basil. After serving, I topped it with crumbled feta cheese. SO GOOD! Even my husband, who is picky with cheeses, thought it took it up a notch. Even though I changed a few things, this recipe is so versatile, I don't think it hurt it at all. It became a favorite for everybody after the first time. The next time I make this, I am going to add some fresh baby spinach to the pasta, just enough to wilt it. I think some other great veggies to try would be peppers, zuchinni, mushrooms, etc. A++ on this one!!

Loved the recipe when i saw it. Put it on my short list. Only tweaks i made were adding shrimp cooked in a butter lemon sauce along with the chicken... and sriracha for some kick in the end.  4 not 5 stars because of the understated protein...

I made this recipe using the guidance from  other reviewers, so included fresh mozzarella and reduced the amount of pasta per serving.  I increased the amount of tomato and given that it is winter, added the tomatos with the asparagus so that they cooked.  I used a lot more fresh basil and added it  just after the pasta so that it wilted.  I didn't have chicken breasts already grilled, so after salting and peppering two chicken breasts, I sauted them in garlic infused olive oil and then used that pan to cook the recipe.  We added fresh Parmesan cheese after serving.

I loved this recipe!  I made it as written and would definitely make this again.  I would use a little less pasta and more asparagus. The flavors were perfect!!

This was very good.  I was limited by the ingredients I had on hand, and this made a nice base to work from.  I was out of butter, so I used Coconut oil along with lemon juice as written.  I had rotisserie chicken, canned diced tomatoes, garlic, fresh asparagus, onion, sweet pepper, and I threw in herbs from my garden (basil, oregano, and parsley) along with salt and pepper.  1 cup (dry) of gluten free penne pasta.  Easy, and good.  I'll make this again.

Used 1 1/2 pkg of Purdue short cut Chicken-  tossed them in at the end to heat up and ate as a pasta meal. Thought it needed more seasoning so next time will add more basil, tomatoes and some red pepper.

Nice flavors but a little too much pasta. I added broccoli and mozzarella like the others suggested and sea salt and pepper. I don't eat meat so I added more veggies but next time I'll add a lot more tomato and cut down the pasta. Still, liked the flavors and would recommend.
