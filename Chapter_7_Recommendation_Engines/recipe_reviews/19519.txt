Oh my gosh, this is the BEST! My husband usually does not like liquer added to any recipe, so when I pulled out the tequila, he freaked. I tasted the recipe before adding the tequila and it was average... I added the tequila and WOW!!! You DO NOT taste the tequila, it just gives a great zip! My husband was truely impressed! I guess that is why they call it a "COCKTAIL" sauce... you NEED the alcohol! 
I decreased my recipe down to 5 servings... Great!

This is just too good!! I spread some cream cheese out on a plate, top with the sauce and then top it all with cooked salad shrimp and serve with crackers. Everyone raves and there's never any left!!

Absolutely fantastic!  Suggest you add a touch more horseradish.  And, let it sit in the fridge for a few hours to thicken it, and let the ingredients blend.  This blows away any store sauce.

The BEST Cocktail sauce i have ever tasted. It is a little on the runny side, but the taste far out ways that. Was unsure about the Tequila, but you cant even taste it. 

Just mix it and put it in the frig for a few hours and it does thicken a bit.

Wonderfully amazing taste~  I did not have chili sauce so I used a recipe from this site, I also reduced the servings because I was not feeding 50.  We loved it.  I made it a second time, filled empty 1/2 pint jars that I had, and gave them away as refrigerated Christmas gifts.   This is now the requested sauce for all occasions.  Make sure you have a good potent horseradish as this can do a lot for the taste.

Very good - not too different from your standard cocktail sauce. Tiquila does give it a bit of a kick - nice. Observation - made it for 12 servings - 1/2 of that  would have served up for 12 people.

This stuff is legit.  I adjusted the servings to 2 and it was perfect. I tried it following the recipe exactly and it was great, then added some chipotle powder to go along with the chipotle shrimp I made.  Also great.

I love this recipe!!!!! My husband and friends loved it as well. Very simple. I will never buy bottled sauce again. This has exactly the "little extra something" that I want in every recipe I make. Great recipe and I cannot wait to make it for a party!

Love this recipe and have passed it on to a local seafood restaurant.    I make a batch of this each summer and freeze 1/2 & 1 cup portions in snack size bags.    Then they're on hand for a year.   I always receive compliments when we serve this.   No one can tell that the "secret" ingredient is tequila.

I reduced the amount of ingredients to serve six (I didn't have 50 people coming over) and then added a bit of chile powder.  It came out great!

I use the same ingredients and make it for a smaller crowd but it turns out all the time. I wouldn't change it at all.

I think I'll be more particular about what horseradish I use next time.  This turned out a bit thin (maybe I used too much lemon juice?), but I liked the flavor the Tequila gave it.

Omigosh! This sauce was fabulous. We ate it right after making it. I can't imagine it could be any better but I am going to let the leftover marinate overnight and try it tomorrow. I was a little afraid of the tequila but it gave the sauce just the kick it needed! I don't think I will ever use another cocktail sauce again! Oh, and oops I rated Al's cocktail sauce by accident!

This stuff is awesome! I made it for a New Year's Eve party and everyone loved it! For those of you that may be turned off by the tequila, don't be. It just adds a wonderful flavor, it doesn't make the cocktail sauce taste like tequila. Just to clarify something on the chili sauce...it's not mexican chili sauce, it's not asian chili sauce, you should be using the tomato based chili sauce that can be found next to the ketchup in the grocery store. Great recipe!

Best cocktail sauce I've ever had.  It's a little difficult to scale it down, but it's wonderful.  Now I always add tequila to store-bought cocktail sauce.

I sized this to serve 10, and then went a little easy on the horseradish due to personal preference. Tasty, but I also might try just adding a splash of lemon or lime and tequila to bought cocktail sauce just to make a quicker version.

This is a GREAT cocktail sauce!  Has the perfect "kick" that we love.  It tasted so much fresher than the bottled stuff.  Worth the extra effort.

This is an excellent spicy cocktail sauce.  To thicken the sauce, I used half a cup of sun-dried tomato spread (California Sun-Dry brand).  It worked superbly improving texture, reducing runniness, and adding flavor.

I don't even eat shrimp, but have made this several times for parties and people love it. I keep wondering what I else I can use it for so I can enjoy some too. It does make a lot, though, so unless you're having a monster party or little else on the menu, you'll need to cut back. It does freeze well.

Fantastic recipe!  Everyone who tried it loved it!  I halved the recipe and still ended up with enough sauce to last for months.  I hope it keeps, maybe I'll freeze it?  But it's still an awesome recipe that I'll definitely be making again. Thanks for sharing JTRAMMELL...

I made this for my brother's birthday (he adores shrimp!) and it was very well received!  Great flavor as is~no changes necessary!  I did refrigerate the sauce overnight and it was the perfect consistency when I served it.  Thanks for a great recipe.

We did not care much for this.  We'll stick with "Super Al's Cocktail Sauce" on this site.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would.....this is by far the best tasting cocktail sauce I've ever had! I used this with the Japanese Style Deep Fried Shrimp recipe (submitted by ait0shi) I found on this sight for a card party the other night, and everybody thought it was fantastic. Thanks so much!!

This is really good but this makes a TON, enough for a wedding!  I cut it in half and still that was too much.  Also gradually add the hot sauce and taste as you go along as it was a little too spicy and we like spicy.  Maybe that all depends on the brand of hot sauce you use.  I used "Franks" hot sauce. Otherwise delish!  Oh and you cannot taste the Tequila at all.

Fabulous spicy cocktail sauce.  I made just under 4 servings for about a pound of shrimp and still had about 8oz left.  Excellent!

I've made this recipe twice to rave reviews.  I scale to 13 servings, so it is scaled perfectly for a 1.5 cup bottle of chili sauce.  Still makes a TON of cocktail sauce.

Terrific stuff.  I only halved the recipe and still had lots. I could make 1/4 the amount next time but I think our friends would be disappointed. They exclaimed all evening about how much of that wonderful cocktail sauce there was. No one refused my offer to put some in a jar to take along when they left. I am surprised at the tasty boost tequila gives the sauce. It is thinner than what we expect a coctail sauce to be but the flavor helped my husband adjust to that. Will definetly make this again.

Whoa...make sure you change the number of servings because as it is written, it makes 18 cups!  The tequila adds such a wonderful "tang" to this cocktail sauce, more than normal.  Delicious!

Wow! This recipe is delicious! I served it at my super bowl party and everyone loved it. When the shrimp was gone, people put it on other appetizers instead. I have to admit I was a little leery while mixing this - I was afraid the worcestershire or the tequila would overpower everything else, but that wasn't the case. Don't change a thing! I do recommend letting it chill for a least a few hours before serving.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful. Served it with guest and they all really
liked it. I will always use it rather than
buy the already made ones. The tequila 
certainly added to the flavor.

This is fantastic!  I eyeballed the amounts and used Sriracha chili sauce and upped the ketchup a bit.  Mine came out really spicy; my boyfriend said it was the best cocktail sauce he'd ever had because of the good kick to it.  Highly recommended.

I served this sauce with jumbo shrimp on New Years Eve.  It was such a huge sucess that I received phone calls on News Years Day for the recipe. I made 6 servings and I also decreased the horseradish to 21/2 tablespoons.  This is a easy recipe to season to your taste.

This was fantastic!  It received rave reviews at a recent gathering.  Some friends were eating it out of the bowl with spoons sans shrimp and trying to figure out what that 'special flavor' was.  The tequila really makes the sauce!  Do scale the recipe, though and watch the hot sauce.  Thanks John!

I scaled the recipe to 6 servings and let the sauce sit in fridge for about an hr. Sauce was thinner in consistency than other cocktail sauces but still VERY good. Tequila does give an "extra kick".

The best cocktail sauce recipe I've ever found. Enjoyed by the whole family. Note the serving size and scale accordingly before you pour out 2 cups of tequila. But if you do, just have a couple shots and keep on cooking!

BEST COCKTAIL SAUCE EVER!! It rocks! My only suggestion is to use good tequila. I tried it once with Mezcal, mostly because I wanted to eat the worm at the bottom of the bottle (lol)and it was still good. But the next time I used Anejo... yup, that took it to the next level. Very good cocktail sauce11

This was the BEST cocktail sauce we have ever tried.  Due to so many reviews stating how runny the sauce was, I reduced the recipe to 10 servings (still way too much) and added 1/2 small can of tomato paste and the rest ketchup.  Mixed this up the night before and let it sit in the fridge.  It was the perfect consistancy!

Excellent recipe - will be making this for the big game this weekend.

Thanks for a great recipe!

Just fabulous. I used Sriracha chili sauce, and felt it turned out a bit too hot. Next time if I'm using a hot chili sauce, I'll skip out on the extra hot sauce. Or I'll keep the Hot sauce if I'm using a sweet chili sauce. Didn't need to salt or pepper at all.

I was a little sketchy about the tequila but it does add a little something extra.  I use a bit more horseradish, but that's just my preference.   It's a great recipe as it is.

Scaled it down to 4 servings with the AR tool, worked like a charm.  I've made my own cocktail sauce forever using similar ingredients. Always thought it was way better than anything bottled.  But yours is even better, couldn't taste the tequila specifically but this really popped. Serving sizes are large but need to be, goes great on seafood, but also garlic bread, French fries and salad. Thanks!
