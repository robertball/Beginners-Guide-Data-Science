Five stars and an A+. This is the perfect basic sloppy joes recipe. I won't be buying the canned stuff anymore. We like ours just a little stickier so added 1/2 cup water and a tablespoon of quick oats then simmered it down. MMM  Next time I'm going to double it so I can freeze the extra. I fill the cups in a muffin tin with the leftovers and freeze. When frozen just pop them out and store in a Ziploc bag in the freezer. Each one is the perfect size for a bun and ready to microwave at a seconds notice.

Best sloppy joes ever! My boyfriend absolutely loved it...instead of 3/4 cup of ketchup I only used 1/2 and replaced the other 1/4 with barbecue sauce. It turned out perfect..not too ketchupy or anything...oh and I also skipped the brown sugar - only because the barbecue sauce I was using already had brown sugar in it.

I browned the ground beef, onion and green pepper. I then put the remaining ingredients into a crock pot and cooked on low for about 3-4 hours.  This recipe was really simple & delicious.

This is wonderful!  My family loves this when I slice the top off hogie buns, hollow out the shell, stuff with the hot Sloppy Joe meat, top with cheese and broil until the cheese melts. Save the bread from the buns for crumbs or whatever you need them for.  I freeze mine.

Much better than Manwich and SO easy!  The best thing is it's made with ingredients I always have in the house and it's not a hundred ingredients either so it's fast to make.  I always make more sauce than it calls for, I think it's too dry otherwise.  If I make it with 1 lb. of meat I double the sauce, 2 lbs. I triple it, 3 lbs. I quadruple it, etc.  It's great in the crockpot too; I make it in the morning when I have a minute and it sits in the crockpot on low all day.  I've passed this recipe on to anyone who will take it.

Absolutely delicious. This is the perfect recipe for sloppy joes in my opinion. People complain about the reviews being overrated because this isn't all jazzed-up into something special. Well what do you expect, it's only sloppy joes! I haven't had sloppy joes in years, and I am so glad I chose this recipe to finally have a taste of some. The only thing I would definitely change is the simmer time. Even on the lowest fire I had to cut it down to 20 min. instead of the original 30 because it started sticking to the pan. But it was finished by then any way and the flavors have already come out from the seasonings. This was AWESOME! A definite keeper. If you would like to simmer for the full 30 min, follow the advice of others and add just a bit of water and/or extra ketchup. This also adds more sloppiness. Yum!

Our family loves this recipe (I make it a lot). I have to double it for my family of five (makes great leftovers, if there are any). I also add 2-3 tsp of white vinegar, a tsp of Worcestershire sauce, and some tomato paste. Quick, simple, and DEEEELICIOUS!

This is a wonderful, easy basic recipe, as the high ratings can attest.  However, for those who tend to find this too sweet, don't add the brown sugar until the last, at the same time you adjust the S&P. If you find it doesn't need the sugar, skip it; or add just a tiny bit at a time until you like it.  Or try 1/2-1 tsp. molasses instead of the br. sugar to add depth of flavor without much sweetness.  

Still too sweet? You might also need to substitute tomato sauce for the ketchup (in which case you might want to add a bit of additional spices.) 

If you have already made the recipe as listed, and find it too sweet, DON'T THROW IT OUT!  Remember that acids are sour and will offset the sweetness. Therefore, add a splash of vinegar or unsweetened tomato products (such as tomato paste or chopped tomatoes) a little at a time until the sweetness is corrected to your tastes. Then follow the steps above next time you make this.

Don't pass up this quick, easy, tasty recipe without tweaking it to suit your family's tastes! :)

This went over big at the fire station. Adjusted the recipe for ten and barely fed 8!! To make the sauce a little "sloppier" instead of addind more ketchuo, I added chicken gumbo soup.

This was a big hit at our super bowl party... I exchanged the hamburger for ground turkey... I promise you NO ONE could tell the difference and I certainly didn't tell anyone!  I did add a little water after it simmered awhile but that was it, Definitely will never buy the canned stuff again!!!

This one always makes EVERYone happy!  :)  I add a tsp of liquid smoke, 1/2 c. bbq sauce and a tbsp of apple cider vinegar for a little zing.  Then I mix a little mayo, garlic salt & parmesan cheese & spread it onto the buns.  Add jack cheese to one side & broil until bubbley, then top with sloppy joe.  A favorite in our house for sure! I'll never by Manwich again!!  Thanks!  :)

Sloppy Joes elevated!  Such a quick easy recipe to make and modify to one's taste buds.  Too sweet, use less brown sugar.  Want spicier, use 1/2 ketchup and chili sauce. Health conscience, use ground turkey.  Thanks to Arnolddirr for the freezing method tip using muffin tins and to Tamara the submitter of this recipe.

I made this for the varsity/JV basketball teams (35 kids!) and it was a HUGE hit!! 10 pounds of ground beef later, one boy said it was the best meal yet! I did use 1/2 ketchup and 1/4 barbeque sauce, put everything in the crockpot on low for 6 hours. Success!

I forgot to pick up a canned sloppy joe mix and turned to all recipes. This recipe had so many reviews and such a high rating with simple ingredients I knew I'd give it a shot.  Well, it brings flashbacks to the days when people made things from scratch. Funny thing is...it really takes maybe 5 minutes longer to assemble than sloppy joes using a canned sauce and it tastes unbelievable!  You have to try it!

These sloppy joes immediately moved into first place at our house, knocking my once-favorite recipe out of the running! Everyone loved the not-too-sweet, not-too-tangy flavor and rich, thick consistency. I made it exactly as directed and wouldn't change a thing! To save time, I prepare the mixture several hours ahead of time and keep it warm in a slow-cooker until dinner. I have also tried quadrupling the recipe for a crowd and it works great, affecting neither flavor nor texture.

Everyone is right, this is a winner!
I made two batches today using 6 lbs. of ground chuck in each batch. I stock the freezer for future use.  To cut the fat, I cook just the meat and then pour very hot water over it and drain. Next, I added the  raw onion & peppers and the remaining ingredients and simmer for a couple of hours.  There is so much flavor going on that you'll never miss the fat.

I give these the highest rating because it tasted great, it was easy to make, and it consists of everything you'd have on hand.  Sloppy Joes shouldn't be a gourmet affair, it should be a quick-to-make weeknight meal that tastes good.  These are the only ones I will be making from now on.

Added a couple Tablespoons of hubby's favorite BBQ sauce, a teaspoon of Goya Seasonings, a couple dashes of Chili Powder and a couple teaspoons of Worcestershire Sauce, I used red bell pepper instead of green, and used 2t of brown sugar instead of 3 and instead of Garlic Powder, I used 2 minced fresh cloves of garlic and added that after the meat, onion and pepper were cooked and drained so as not to burn the garlic and simmered covered only 20 minutes instead of 30.  So freaking good!  My husband said its the best Sloppy Joe's he has ever had and me too!  Thanks for this basic recipe with all ingredients usually on hand!  Love it and love this recipe!  Will be a regular in our rotation!

This sloppy joe is the BOMB.  I will NEVER eat Manwich again.  By far it is killing Manwich.  When I make this, it is amazing and it's so hard to stop eating it!  I use 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup of sweet baby rays bbq sauce per pound....MM MM MM!  I also use red and green peppers.  TERRIFIC!

This was good, but not my favorite.  It was a little bit too sweet for us.  I also didn't really like the green bell  pepper taste with it.  I think I will keep using my own recipe.  Thanks for the post.

Best sloppy joes ever! Only additions - red pepper for kick and a little water to simmer.  Kids loved it and I loved it because all ingredients were in my kitchen. Will never use powder mix again.

My family loved it!  One review stated it was better than canned sloppy joe mixes and they were absolutely correct and who doesn't have these ingredients on hand all the time!!  So easy.  Only change I made was adding a bit of worchestershire sauce.  I would recommend 1 tsp and tasting to see if you prefer a bit more.  I added about 3 tsps. This will be own only sloppy joe recipe now!  Thank you so much for sharing and I highly recommend a test of this one!  :O)

I love this recipe!  I usually add extra ketchup, as the boys in our family are ketchup maniacs and we like our sloppy joe's really saucy.  I've probably made this recipe 50 times over the last few years, and everyone loves it.  It's easy, fast, and really cheap!

This is not meant to replace a regular hamburger-ground beef just happens to be the main ingredient.  Try something before dismissing it!!  I have been making this for years.  When my brother owned a market, it was one of our most requested items!  It's delicious and you can adjust the sweetness and spices to your personal liking.

I don't know what I did wrong here but I could not get any "sauce" to be made. My meat kept sucking up everything.  I doubled the recipe and ended up using an entire bottle of ketchup then adding water and letting it cook down over and over again.  Finally I got some sauce and my husband said it would be 5-star if it had just a bit more "glue" to hold the meat together.  The flavor profiles were there and it was excellent, I just had issues with the sauce.  Will continue to practice with this because it is too good to not make again, I am just puzzled about my sauce.  Great flavors - 4 teenage boys wolfed them down.

My family loves sloppy joes while i'm not a complete fan.  I absolutely despise the canned stuff so decided to try this recipe.  I used about 1.5lbs of meat for this and i doubled the green peppers in it.  I seasoned the meat while cooking, as i would with any other recipe and i used 3 cloves of fresh minced garlic as well.  I pretty much doubled the sauce, using 1.5c ketchup and about 3/4 c bbq sauce.  I only used the 3tbsp of brown sugar though as i found doubling that would have made it far too sweet.  I didn't simmer near the time it says too as it was thickening quite quickly even on lowest heat.  I served these on fresh kaiser buns with freshly diced onions and green pepper and grated cheese for toppers.  Will definitely use this recipe again when my family wants sloppy joes.  Thanks for sharing!

I personally did not like this recipe.  To me, it just tasted like hamburger with sweet ketchup on it.

I found this recipe to be lacking something after simmering so I added 1 Tbsp. of KC Masterpiece Original BBQ sauce and it was great!!! I suggest that you taste it before serving and add to it if you feel it needs it.

These were really good!  I'd put five stars, but I didn't follow this recipe exactly.  I used turkey, because I typically substitute that for ground beef, and I didn't use green peppers because I don't care for them.  Also, I saw one comment that mentioned barbeque sauce, so I did add that -- I thought that addition was great!  Anyway, everything mixed together really well, and it was easy.  Sloppy Joes without the "omggg I'm so fullllll" situation afterward.  Thanks!

Since moving back to the UK over 7 years ago my wife and kids have been pestering me to make Sloppy Joes, whilst in the States we only ever had the tinned stuff, so tonight I made Sloppy Joes using this recipes and now have very happy kids and wife, very simple and full of flavour, did it in the slow cooker for about 4 hours on low and this really brought all the flavours out. 5 Stars+ from the UK

I followed others' suggestions. I used ground turkey. I also added a little honey barbecue sauce and less brown sugar, added some tomato paste with a little water. (depends how thick and saucy you want your sloppy joes) Husband loved it...I'll be keeping this version!!

Better than mom's.  I combined a lot of the advice given in the reviews. 
-I made sauce first and let it simmer until finished everything else.
-I added 3 tsp of white vinegar.
-I eyeballed some chili powder, which i thought gave the sauce an excellent kick.
-I cut back some of the ketchup with bbq sauce instead.
-I went a little over on the sauce ingredients (and added a little water) to make it extra sloppy.

-If you live in Texas this is 3 servings.  See "Texas Sized" buns. :D

Great as is, I only made small changes after tasting too suit my tastes.  I added 1 tsp of Worcestershire, an additional 1 tsp of prepared yellow mustard, and 1 tsp of onion powder, in addition to the other spices that the recipe called for.  Tastes like Manwich, just without the canned taste and a little sweeter.  If you tend to like your Sloppy Joes not on the sweet side, then I would recommend starting out with only 1 tsp of brown sugar and then you can add more if you like.

One night I was making sloppy joes and realized I only had one can of mix but needed two.  Instead of running to the store I popped on here to see if I had all the ingredients on hand to make it from scratch. We all enjoyed this so much I sent my daughter home with the can I did have.  I won't be buying those any more! What a much better flavor and great use for my garden peppers!

This is a great recipe. Very simple to prepare and delicious. I added more ketchup, about 3/4 of a cup more and about 1/2 cup of water to make sure it was slopy enough. I also added a dash of chilli powder and used ground turkey instead of beef. It turned out excellant! Also good over brown or white rice instead of bread. I just tried it last night and am going to buy more turkey so I can make it again :)

This was a very good, slightly tangy recipe. After reading others' reviews that it wasn't "sloppy" enough, I added a cup of beef broth, and simmered it for a bit longer. It turned out just the right consistency. This must've also helped cut down the sweetness, as, unlike some other reviewers, I didn't find it to be too sweet at all. I also omitted the green peppers to make it more kid friendly.

Very good but a bit sweet for my taste.  Added some dashes of balsamic vinegar and worcestershire to off set the sweetness.  Used minced dried onion instead of fresh becuase my onion hater will eat the dried ones.  Will make again.

If you like your sloppy joe sweet, this is for you! I had to improvise a bit, but did my best: Added 1/8 tsp cayanne pepper & 1 tsp A1 sauce, didn't have green pepper so doubled onion. This is a good basic recipe, & worth working with, but came out too sweet for my taste so next time I'm adding 1/4 tsp cayanne & cutting the sugar -- ketchup is sweet enough.  **UPDATE** Made this again without any brown sugar & kept the A-1 sauce, no cayanne; turned out better for me/less sweet. I'm going to keep tweaking this one. It's VERY FORGIVING & tastey, I just need to find the perfect blend of kick & just a bit of sweetness!

This is a great starting out recipe for Sloppy Joe's, but it does need some tweaking to be considered worthy of 5 stars, so therefore it just gets 4 from me. Here are my suggestions... if you're going to use ketchup, I would definitely add a package of dry Chili Seasoning Mix, OR use bottled Chili Sauce instead and skip the ketchup altogether. Also, the ratio is off a bit; I'd use 1/2 cup ketchup & double the amount of mustard. I like to add some Worcestershire as well... probably about a tablespoon. Everyone has their own personal tastes for Sloppy Joe's so just keep on tasting it as you mix it up and you can adjust it to your liking. As I said though, this is a good "starting point recipe" so do give it a try!

This was a great recipe, the only complaint that we have is that it's just a bit dry.  Next time around we'll just make more of the sauce.  Otherwise, great recipe.

Very easy, very good and should be made as is. I understand to add this and add that and make these huge changes then when done give glaring reviews of how great a recipe is. What I like to do is make most of these recipes as is the first time. This allows for an honest to goodness fair review of the actual recipe. 

This is one recipe that I really really like as is. I have made it multiple times since I have two little kids. Ive changed it some before to no avail with little ones tastes.

Had some chopped red bell pepper mixed with some chopped green bell pepper leftover from another dish so I used that. Also, split the ketcup with BBQ sause and then added in some extra BBQ sauce. We don't have sloppy joes very often, but always used a canned mix. This was so easy and tasted so much better! Will be using this recipe again!!

Like Whoa...Flavorful! The flavors come out so well in this sandwich, I was pleasantly surprised. Like Emeril though I had to kick it up a notch by adding some hot sauce baby - BAM, BAM, BAM because I like it a little spicy. You know as a kid I grew up on sloppy joe's out of the can like most folks - but as I got older I shyed away from it because of the sweet flavor. But with this recipe you have the ability to control the sweetness it is not oversweet at all. I was expecting a typical tomato-o-e base. No, not at all these ingredients lend itself more to a sort of delicious barbeque flavor. I was like oh snap... she might be on to something here - It simple, quick and easy to make and it fills a hungry belly. Most people already have these ingredients in their pantry already. I Luv it. Indeed a keeper - I will make this again. Beautiful presentation - Reveiwers you have to try this.

Absolutely a 5 star recipe. The next-day leftovers are even better! You MUST double the sauce ingredients (garlic powder, mustard, ketchup & brown sugar) because even after simmering for 30 min they're still not very "sloppy". Another MUST is to simmer on the stovetop. My friend loved the recipe so I shared it with her, but she made it in her crockpot. Hers definitely came out sloppier, but the simmering time really makes that brown sugar kind of caramelize, and without that hers just didn't taste as good. My husband hates manwich, so I had to go in search of a recipe he would like... now he gets SO excited every time I tell him we're having sloppy joes for dinner!

Wow. I was so excited about this recipe and SO disappointed in its outcome. With so many positive reviews, I thought for sure it had to be good.  I admit that I goofed up at first, having misread the recipe to say 3 T of brown sugar instead of 3t. Yes, that was incredibly sweet :). I then decided I'd try again, only this time omitting the sugar all together until I tasted it. Well, in my opinion it was still way over the top sweet! I ended up rinsing the meat and going with Manwich, only because I didn't want to waste all that burger. I will search for a recipe that does not claim to be sweet next time around. I have a taste in my mind, but this was not it.

Delicous! But its so so easy to take this to the next level with about 2-3 tsbp of worchestire sauce and liberal dashes of tabasco sauce... in my opinion, these little changes perfect it. By the way.. if you have kids, cut the peppers up nice and small. They honestly wont even know that they are in there, trust me! I trick my full grown boyfriend into eating them this way all the time.

This is a very good recipe - one that really resembles the packets you get at the store.  My one and only complaint is that it is NOT sloppy at all!!  Needs more juice...next time I will take advice from others and add some water while it simmers.  Also, I added worsh. sauce and chili powder for a bit of kick, and used fresh garlic rather than the powder.  Yummy!

Excellent!!!  The entire family loved it!!!  I did notice when cooking that it began to dry out a little - so, I covered with a lid and the steam added just the right of moisture back to it.  This definitely goes into my "special" collection!

Thanks,
Linda

I rated this as kid friendly because I think 99% of kids would love this.  My child didn't but that's definitely not the fault of the recipe.
My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed this recipe and it was very easy to make.  It will definitely be served again.

It's great! Better than what my mom made...and that's saying something. I sort of laughed at the comment posted by Momof2 stating they thought it was too sweet and they don't like the green pepper. Ever thought of just cutting down on the suger and skip the pepper?

Delicious, and brings back kid memories as Sloppy Joes were popular at school and home. This is a traditional recipe closely replicating the original one invented by Joe (surely a distant relative) in a Sioux City, Iowa tavern in the 1930’s . With over 3,000 reviews, it’s already been said. Just try it as written, and you should like it.

Love this recipe!  I remember when Sloppy Joes were served in high school and this recipe brings back those memories when we couldn't wait for the day they were served.  I made this recipe, froze in muffin tin, popped them out, then thaw them in the microwave.  I have one left, then will make more this weekend.  Excellent taste.  Thanks

Excellent recipe. I recommend adding 1 tablespoon of oatmeal for texture, and a teaspoon or so of Worcestershire and vinegar. This makes it perfect!

OMG I just tried this last night because I had read all the rave reviews and it was delicious. I love Manwich but this is way better. I do not think I will ever buy another can of that stuff again. Also the recipe is really easy to remember and easy to make. I did cut the ketchup to 1/2 cup and added some Worcestershire sauce also added 1/2 cup water. I will make this often.

This is similar to the recipe I make. I use sweet pickle relish instead of green pepper. I do add a tablespoon of brown sugar even though the relish is sweet. To make this ready faster I squirt ketchup and mustard onto the hamburger, add the rest of the ingredients, and fry with medium heat, stirring constantly. To make the Joes a bit less messy, I shake up a teaspoon of flour or cornstarch in a 1/2 cup of water, stir enough of it into the hot mix in the frying pan to moisten, and continue cooking it until the water reduces and the flour or cornstarch are cooked. The hamburger mix is ready to eat at this point.
I use any leftover Sloppy Joe mix in chili or spaghetti sauce: a quick way to make another meal.

This is the best Sloppy Joe that I have ever had.  What I like about it is it's easy to make with ingredients you already have anyway and it tastes better than any Sloppy Joe sauce you buy from the store.

I already have a go-to recipe for Sloppy Joe's that was given to me by my dear friend What's His Face, but every once in awhile, when I can't find the specific ingredients for his (we call 'em Sloppy Bills) I turn to this one. Ssshh... It's just as good! We enjoy it with a bit of celery added to the saute and a dash each of worcestershire and tabasco. Thanks for sharing, Tamara.

This was absolutely delicious! I did add sauteed green pepper and onion (chopped very finely) - and increased the sauce a bit - (actually I did not measure the amount of ingredients I added - but I did add everything the recipe called for - just not in exact measurements) and my whole family LOVED IT! This was a great dinner for a cold Chicago night! I will definitely make this again!

Very good, but don't substitute turkey for the beef.  Loved it the first time I made it (with beef) but it wasn't crumbly/sloppy enough the second time (with turkey).  I added celery, 1 T quick oats, and 1/2 cup to 1 cup of water.

I'm giving a little snicker as I type this, because this recipe is just how my mom makes it,  which is a very good thing.  I did add more ketchup and some water (so it would'nt dry out as it was cookin').  LOVED it, thanks Tamara!

I haven't had many sloppy joes, but I just had a craving for it.  And this recipe definitely fulfilled my craving.  It was delicious! And it's really easy, too.  Nothing extravagant, but very yummy.

The kids asked what Sloppy Joes were - I have somehow deprived them of this experience! This recipe was easy enough for our 8 yr old do most of the work, although he refused to add mustard "because mustard is literally the most disgusting thing we have in the fridge, Mom!"  Our 6 yr old, who hates cooked peppers, balked at the sight of it but after one bite she polished off two buns. Should have doubled it for the freezer.

I am starting to cook the meals for my family in the evenings and for our first dish I chose this one!  I have three little brothers and a mother that don't care for Sloppy Joes' much but today I had them fighting each other off for seconds!  Definitely recommend this dish, easy to make and doesn't require a whole lot prepare!

I was really surprised how much we liked this!   It was quick to make and very flavorful.  I did find I didn't have enough sauce, so, I made another half batch of the sauce.  Next time I will use a little less brown sugar because it was very sweet.  Definitely would be one I make again though.

It was good, but much too sweet.  I would definitely cut down on the brown sugar the next time.  What I really like about this recipe however is the fact that the salt content is nothing compared to the dry package mixes.

Just like mom used to make!  I used ground turkey burger instead of beef and left out the green pepper since hubby doesn't like it.  I also added a 1/4 cup of water, an extra tsp. of brown sugar and and extra Tbs. of ketchup.  Put it in the crock pot and let it simmer on low for 4 hours.  Perfect!  Even my 4 year old loved it!

Hubby thought this was the best Sloppy Joe recipe to date. The only change I made was  1/2  cup ketchup & 1/2  cup BBQ sauce along with all the other ingredients.

Way better than the canned stuff and took all of like 10 minutes to make start to finish.  This recipe is a real winner.  I followed the directions to T except for leaving out the green pepper because I knew my kids wouldn't eat them.  Thanks for the great recipe.  This one is a keeper.

This recipe is super basic and I had to change quite a bit, thats why I gave it three stars. My end product was 5 stars in my opinion. I cut this recipe in half for my boyfriend and I (3 servings) Here are the things I changed:
Added 2TBSP jalapeno 
Doubled the garlic (used fresh garlic) 
Only added 1/4 cup of ketchup (used organic ketchup)
Only added 1TSP brown sugar
Added 1/2TSP cumin 
Added 1/4TSP paprika
Added 1/4TSP coriander 
Added 1TBSP broth (chicken, although beef would have been better)

Not bad!  Made exactly as written and served on regular toasted sandwich bread.  Good flavors, even though it was a touch bland and just a touch too sweet.  I like my sloppy joes a little tangier, but this was still great as is!

I used leftover turkey vs. ground beef. Otherwise, I didn't change the recipe. A little sweet too sweet for us. Perhaps vinegar or Worcestershire sauce would make it five stars. I put everything in a mini-crockpot and cooked for hours. Yummy!

My youngest son loves Manwiches, but my hubby isn't wild about them.  Tried this and it's a winner with everyone!  I doubled the recipe, and made extra sauce, substituting a little Famous Dave's sweet BBQ sauce for some of the ketchup, and reduced the brown sugar from 6 tsp to 4.  
PERFECT!  After combining everything, I put it in a small crock pot and let it simmer on low for about five hours.  Made a really quick and delicious family dinner.  This is a keeper....

who would have thought so few basic ingredients could create such a hearty, comfort-food dish? i used ground turkey and cooked it on a skillet with onions and diced garlic. left out the b.peppers, but put the drained and cooked meat in the crock pot. let it cook on high for about an hour with all of the other ingredients. came out great!

Made it exactly as written but with 1/2 the meat.  It was the perfect amount of sauce and the flavor was amazing.  I would definitely go with others suggestions of doubling if you use a whole pound.  DELICIOUS!

I made this recipe for many years. My mom cooked for a preschool and used this exact same recipe. When you are in a hurry or do not have fresh green peppers on hand, jarred relish works well and is quite  tasty!

Great sloppy joes! I read quite a few reviews and I also used some bbq sauce, worcestershire and vinegar. I made a double batch and used a mixture of ground beef and venison. They turned out very good and may I add they did'nt last long, even the double batch.

Should have rated this when I printed 2 years ago.  VERY good.  I prefer to double it, and not drain meat since it's lean anyway.

I almost never make sloppy joes because I hate the pre-made sauce you buy in the store. I've never tried to make my own, but I bought some organic beef on sale, and the kids wanted sloppy joes. Not being a ketchup fan, I almost passed over this recipe, but I'm so glad I didn't. This is much better than pre-made, and the kids really liked it. Super easy, too, for a busy weeknight.

I couldn't believe how good these turned out!  I made the recipe exactly as written and they were delicious!  I don't think I'll ever make any other sloppy joe recipe.

Super good recipe! Easy to make and much better than that canned stuff. The only thing that I would change is to make it spicier, but that's just a personal preferance :)

Tamara, these are SO good!  They are not sweet like some recipes I've tried! I like a bit of smoke/BBQ flavor to mine, so I substituted 1/4 of the ketchup with KC Masterpiece and thought it was very tasty.  Didn't have regular onion, so I used green onions, diced.. wow, so good!  Thank you so much for sharing.  I made a double batch and put it in my crockpot to keep it warm and took it to my nephews Birthday party along with the recipe for Belles Hamburger Buns here.  I made the buns kid-size and they LOVED them.. you had 10 happy 8 year olds and Aunty Nee was the party hero!!

This was very good and super simple; however, we found it to be far too sweet for our tastes (and we didn't even add the brown sugar).  Just as an FYI and basis of comparison for others, it's definitely sweeter than Manwich sauce (and that's not a knock whatsoever against the recipe; we just prefer a less sweet sauce).  We added crushed red pepper flakes to give it a little extra kick, and that was really tasty!  I will definitely make this again, but next time I'm going to try using half ketchup and half tomato sauce/paste so that it won't be quite so sweet.

Very good! I will never buy the canned stuff again. It's so easy to make at home and you don't have all those unknown ingredients that are added to the canned stuff. =) my picky kids, ages 4 and 2, loved this meal and I figure its a good way to sneak in some veggies, cut up small and mixed in with everything else. Mmm!

Excellent! Just as good or better than I have ever made with canned mix. Not too sweet, not too tart. Not sure why you need to cook it for 30 minutes, I checked halfway through and it tasted the same as after 30 minutes. I made to the recipe with a pound, then made 5 more pounds up and added in tomato sauce to stretch it out without having too much ketchup in it, was great!!! Thanks!

I only made a couple of small changes to this recipe.  For starters, I doubled the sauce and added a little water to make it a bit saucier.  I also substituted 1/4 of the ketchup for some Tastefully Simple Smoky Bacon Grill Sauce.  Towards the end I decided it was a little sweet, so I added a couple dashes Chalula hot sauce.  They were so good!  My hubby liked them, and so did my kids.  We hate the canned stuff and I am so glad I came upon this recipe!!!

This is a really good recipe.  It's easy to make, and fast.  I didn't have the green peppers, so made it without, but it was so good we're going to be having it very often.

I'm sorry, this had way too much ketchup, and was very bland.  I felt like i was forcing myself to finish it.

Next time, I'll either use salsa instead of ketchup or diced tomatoes with a  bit of tomato paste. 

And for spices, I'll probably add chilli flakes, some cumin.

Maybe a jalapeno, and a red pepper will flavour it a bit more.

GREAT!!    Huge hit in my house.  Add a little more watter if you want it extra sloppy or just leave it alone for firm filling in a bun!!!

A very good basic recipe.  I did also do as one person suggested and used some kaiser rolls that I hollowed out, put in the mix, topped with some sliced velveeta and baked them in the oven.  Very good!!!!

this is a classic!!!  been making it for 20+ years with these flavors!  For vegetarians or budget stretchers, try using TVP in place of or stretching the meal.  (Been doing it for years and no one complained)  Be sure to reconstitute the TVP with veg broth or beef broth, then add to the simmering part. TVP absorbs too much of the moisture and sauce by itself.  However, if you want a firmer mix,and are using TVP, go less on the broth added to the TVP then add to the sauce. TVP is a wonderful stretcher - and it absorbs the liquids it is in to give a ground meat texture

This is a simple and delicious sloppy joe recipe.  I used ground turkey, a splash of worcheschire (sp?), and some red pepper flakes and it turned out great!  I served with homemade sweet potato fries.  I will be making this again and again.

DH and I made this for lunch today and we were less than thrilled...I can't imagine how it's managed to receive so many high reviews!  In the end, it didn't taste horrible, but it didn't taste anything like the canned variety....it was VERY sweet.  We used Heinz ketchup and all the other ingredients which were called for...but we did increase the onion to about 1/2 cup.  In the end, my DH had to add some Worcestershire, more garlic powder, salt and pepper to try to offset the sweetness; there wasn't much improvement.  We likely will not make this again, but I do highly recommend NOT adding any brown sugar until you've tasted the meat mixture...if you still require more sweetness, then add it.

Recipe is good but a few modifications make it great.  I put in just a pinch of brown sugar, next time I won't put in any...ketchup is sweet enough.  I used 1-1/2 pounds of ground beef and added fresh and powdered garlic.  I seasoned it with cracked red pepper, worchester sauce, jalapenos and several shakes of tobasco jalapeno sauce.  I also added one small can of V8 juice and let the flavors absorb while cooking down.  This is more of an adult version - with a little kick.

these are incredibly good especially if you use ground sirloin hamburger but they needed more sloppy tomato flavor. So I added some tomato paste and half the ketchup.The tomato paste turns the mixture into its own bbq sauce really brings out the flavors of the meat and it sticks to the bun better.

Excellent! Easy, quick and tasty. I used bbq sauce in addition to ketchup and a yellow pepper instead of green. I also added pickled jalapenos for a kick. Served it over king hawaiian sweet rolls with sharp cheddar and it was fabulous. My husband loved it too.

I've made this almost exactly as stated in the recipe (used ground turkey instead of ground beef) and in a crock pot using shredded left over roast turkey and both times it was very, very good.  (In the crock it took about 3 hours on low and I had to add a little water to keep the "sloppy" from being too dry.)

Way too sweet.  I ONLY made this because of the high reviews. I can see why most of the reviewers children ate this...its like straight sugar.   As I was adding the brown sugar I thought...humm..Ketchup has sugar, why am I adding more...I should have listened to myself.  After following the recipe I tried as others have to undo the sweetness, to no avail.  :(    It looks wonderful, but maybe using tomato sauce and a small can of tomato paste would cut down on the sweetness.  Too bad.   I really wanted a go to recipe.

I only chose this recipe because the reviews were so good.  Now I know why.  This recipe is fantastic!  I used ground turkey and these joes were the best I've had...ever.

I have not had Sloppy Joes since I was a little girl - I found this recipe and thought it was high time to introduce my children to Sloppy Joes!  I was a bit disappointed - I foun it just tasted too much like cooked ketchup.  I added a bit of Epicure's Jerk Jamaican spice to liven it up, but it was still not right.  I hadn't added salt, so I added a bit of soya sauce (about 1 tsp) to cut the ketchup taste and add some salt.  It was ok, but I think I'll still search for a Sloppy Joe recipe.  Thanks for the recipe and sorry!

I made 108 servings of this for my housewarming party last weekend and people kept asking me for the recipe and everyone raved about these joe's! This will be the only recipe I use for sloppy joe's. Thanks so much :)

Ehh, this was okay. Not as disgusting as the canned manwich stuff, but not nearly as good as how I normally make it with crushed tomatoes and such.  I had to add a little Worcestershire sauce and a little more mustard.  Straight by the recipe was too sweet for my taste.  Tasted a little too much just like meat covered in ketchup.  Again, not horrible, just not a new favorite.

Great basic recipe.  The second time I made it I spiced things up a little by using chili sauce in place of the ketchup and adding a couple of tablespoons of chipotle pepper (pureed in adobo sauce) and some diced jalapenos, then served them up on onion rolls with a slice of pepper jack cheese.

I took the advice of another reviewer and used 1/2 c. katchup and 1/3 c. BBQ sauce. I omitted the brown sugar and used 2 garlic cloves chopped instead of the powder. It was good and easy. Thanks!

Very good and simple. I doubled the meat and liquids and kept the onions and peppers at the same quanity, which was the perfect combation. Not too overpowering.

I had no mustard on hand, so I used about 1 Tbsp of cider vinegar plus 1 tbsp of chilli sauce instead. As suggested by the other reviewers, I also used fresh garlic and added about 2 tbsp of worcestershire sauce. Not wanting it to be too sweet, I used only 1 tsp of brown sugar, but my son said it was not sweet enough, so I added another tsp. The recipe turned out great, and my son said it tasted way better than the packaged mix by Lawry's. Thank you Tamara.

This is a good recipe as is.  The second time I made it I did make a couple of minor changes which kicked it up a notch for me.  I substituted a teaspoon of dry mustard for the prepared mustard.  I also added 1-1/2 teaspoons of white vinegar and 3/4 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce.  If you like to pile it on your buns like I do, this recipe only makes four servings.  Great recipe Tamara.

I usually love Sloppy Joes, but this recipe did not suit my taste. I thought that it was much too sweet and ketchupy. I will stick to using the tomato paste / Sloppy Joe Seasoning packet method until I can find a homemade recipe that I like.

This was very good. I did look over the reviews before trying and changed it a litte. I used 1/4 cup of ketchup,1/4 cup spicy ketchup and 1/4 cup chile sauce. I also added some worcestershire sauce for a little more zest.

YUM!  I can't tell you how many times I've been asked for this recipe when I bring it to potlucks.  These are the BEST sloppy joes that I've ever had in my life.  I'll never buy Manwich again (this is just as easy and SO much better).

better than from a mix. my husband loved this more than i did. however it was not as "sloppy" as he had hoped, and we both thought it could use more sauce. i used 1.3 pounds of ground chicken instead of 1 pound of ground beef. however, i don't think that can account for why it was dry. i would probably double the ketchup, mustard and spices for that amount of meat.

All the raves about this recipe were true.  I made it the day before I needed it for 
an informal family birthday celebration.  I doubled the recipe thinking I could freeze
half for later use . . . foolish me--it was so popular we ate it all!  The best thing about 
it is it's simplicity and can be made lower fat by draining meat throroughly after 
browning.  I highly recommend it (and so do the six other members of the family
who ate it.)

Sloppy joe's should be sloppy and this recipe is a lot drier than I think a sloppy joe should be.  Although the flavor was excellent and the whole thing was extremely easy to make, I will play with the recipe and see if I can make it more to my family's liking.

Delicious!!! I made it with red bell peppers (we don't have green bell peppers in Peru). It was really good. I also doubled the recipe for the sauce as someone recommended. Will be doing this again!

I tried this, and it was just missing something. I doubled the sauce (otherwise I felt it was too dry)but only used a total of 4 T. brown sugar. Also added chopped celery, and a healthy splash of red wine vinegar. That was the "something" it needed. With the changes it is pretty good stuff.

I made this exactly by the recipe.  Going EXACTLY by the recipe, it was a little dry, but we thought the taste was very good.  It's a keeper and I will use this recipe again.

This may be one of the best Sloppy Joe recipes I've used - and seems to be foolproof :)  Not paying attention, I used 1/2 cups of onion and peppers and 3 T of brown sugar.  It was still absolutely wonderful and everyone approved!  There were NO leftovers!

I always try a recipe as is first to give it a fair shake... Not fair to rate a recipe if you've changed half the ingredients! I liked this as written, though a touch sweeter than I am used to. But like meatloaf, I change it a little each time! I do always cut back on the brown sugar, but that is the only consistent difference. I have done: half red, half green peppers; added a pinch of cayenne and cumin; a small can of chopped green chilies; a dash of Worcestershire; less ketchup and add some bbq sauce; used spicy brown mustard instead of yellow; a dash of hot sauce; and one of my favorites is to replace 1/4 cup of the ketchup with 1/4 cup of Goya Sofrito. Obviously I don't make all these changes at once, but in different combinations, and sometimes only make one. The point is, start with this basic recipe and tweak it... It's a great starting point! My son even suggested adding a few pieces of crumbled bacon...

This was amazing.  So much better than the tomato sauce recipes.   I used a pound of ground turkey and actually sautéed the bell peppers and onions in butter prior to adding them to the meat.  I also added about a 1/2 teaspoon of cumin to the "sauce" to give it a little punch.  It turned out amazing!  I definitely recommend this recipe.  Way better than canned sloppy joe mix, hands down and so easy to make.

Instead of using bell peppers, we substitute sliced jalapeños for a "bold and spicy" kick. Excellent recipe!

it needs a bit more ketchup (too dry) and I added a little cayenne and diced tomatoes for taste and heartiness. it lacks that hint of a bite I'm used to and its a bit too sweet for my taste recommend cutting down on the brown sugar.

It was very sweet but delicious. I did add a little extra ketchup, about half a cup, and a few other things from my pantry. I defiantly will make it again but I would probably cut down on the brown sugar.

I did a twist on this kid friendly comfort food and swapped the ground beef for Johnsonville mild italian ground sausage.  This was such a hit with my family!! The guys went back for seconds and ate leftovers for lunch the next day! The sausage added another level of spice to the sloppy joes, which gave more dimension to the flavor.  This is a great, quick meal that kids and adults will love!

This is a great recipe. This is a simple recipe that is quick and easy and is much better than canned sauce, and I rated it as such. I made as is except used half the sugar and doubled the sauce because I like "sloppy" Joes but either way, the flavor is great and it is ready in no time. I have a super low simmer burner and didn't need to add any water, it gently simmered in a newer non-stick pan for 30 minutes perfectly.

I've made this once a week for the last month and my family absolutely loves it. Plus I do as another person mentioned and freeze the leftovers in muffins tins, pop them out and then put them in a freezer bag. They are great for work/school lunches and are the perfect size for a hamburger bun! I make the recipe as stated but instead of regular mustard I add spicy mustard. Easy to make, delicious, and cheap! What's not to love?

Our four year old son ate half of his sandwich and asked me if I could make again tomorrow night because he likes it. This does not sit heavy on our stomach like other sloppy joes. We are keeping in our recipe box. Use with grass fed beef and you will love!

I've always made my Sloppy Joes from Betty Crocker's cookbook. Until I came up with this one: much saucier! Did exactly what it asked for and turned out perfect.

I had lots of leftovers and best part comes now:
I bought this half made mini empanadita dough (In Spain, from Nestle) And filled them with a tablespoon of Sloppy Joes, baked them and froze them. They taste exactly like the empanaditas agentinas from our favorite restaurant in town.

This recipe for Sloppy Joe's is delicious and just how we like it. We don't care for green pepper so I left it out. Since they are messy to eat I toasted thick bread slices and served the meat mix over top of the toast like an opened faced sandwich.

I made this recipe for a "Fun Lunch" at my children's school.  I adjusted the recipe to serve 120.  It was perfect!!!  Kids came back for seconds, some for thirds!!!!  I even received an email from a father.  He wanted the recipe because his two sons came home from school and couldn't stop talking about how good they were. I followed the recipe exactly.  I chopped the onions & peppers in my food processor because I was cooking for a large group and I wanted them chopped really small for the little ones.

I always double to use 1 kg of ground bef, use fresh minced garlic for the powder, add Worchestire sauce and halve the sugar.  I don't measure the ketchup just add enough until it is saucy. Kids love it!

Nice recipe. Not too spicy so it's great for kids, or, in my case, my 85 year old in-laws who can't take much heat.

Great classic recipe!

I added 3/4 c. water and 1 tbsp ground oats to make it a bit saucier and added 2 tbsp of bbq sauce for extra flavour. Delicious!

The only change made to this recipe was that I added 1 tsp. of apple cider vinegar. It was a huge hit with my family. And tasted just like grandma used to make, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING.

I appreciate that these are so easy to make and call for ingredients that I always have.  I'm not a big fan of Sloppy Joes, but my BF likes them now and then.  I decided to try this to see if I'd like it better than the typical canned version - I did!  BF said he likes it considerably more.  I made two small changes: I used 1/2c ketchup + 1/4c of my fave bbq sauce, which is sweet, so I reduced the brown sugar by half.  I read other comments about the mixture being too dry, but I covered mine while it simmered and it turned out just right in regards to moisture.  No more canned mix for us - thanks for this recipe.  Update -- for a fun change:  Remove crusts from slices of white break, lightly butter cups of a muffin tin (only the #  you wish to make).  Center bread slice over cup, press down and form into cup.  Fill each bread cup 3/4 full with Sloppy Joe mix, top with some shredded cheddar cheese.  Bake at 350 until bread is light brown and cheese is melted.  The crunch of the toasted bread makes these really good.

I agree with others.....you need to double the sauces. I didn't have any green pepper so left that out.  I also reduced to 2 teaspoons of brown sugar. Thought this was way too ketchup-y tasting so I tried adding some Worcheshire and apple cider vinegar but it still tasted too ketchup-y and sweet. I probably should've used some BBQ sauce in place of the ketchup.

Yummo!! Donate the canned sloppy joe's mix and make this! This was fast, easy and delicious! Reminded me of dinner as a kid. The only changes I made was used ground turkey, fresh minced garlic and add some worchestshire sauce. I did double the sauce because I like it really sloppy! Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

These were very good!  A little on the sweet side, so next time I'll reduce the brown sugar.  Overall, the receipe was quick, easy, and much better than the canned stuff!

Excellent sloppy joe base. I doubled the sauce and added finely diced celery, carrots, onion and red peppers about a 1/4 cup of each. I also added a a couple of dashes of worstershire sauce. Served on heated and buttered Italian bread sliced in half. Good Stuff.

Very good Sloppy Joes enjoy by the whole family. I ended up doubling the sauce by adding equal amounts of ketchup and barbecue sauce (Bulls Eye). Thank you for sharing. I will be making this again, soon.

This is the TASTIEST Sloppy Joe recipe I've ever tried.  We're not fans of Bell Pepper so we just left those out.  I minced the onions in a food processor and sauteed them before-hand until they were caramelized before adding the ground beef.  Super delicious!

I love sloppy joes, they were always my favorite. My mom has this recipe from her great aunt that she always made, well now it was my turn to make my own version. So I used this recipe! My mother is a very picky eater, worse than me, so I was hoping she would like it. And she did! So did I! It was very good, though I could have added some water, tomato sauce, or more ketchup in it to make it more moist. But it was still very good! I will definitely make this again someday!

Tried three different recipes and this was the one most liked by the tasters. May try a little less brown sugar and mustard to see if I personally like it better.

I followed this recipe exactly as written and was rather disappointed.  I had great expectations for it given the great reviews.  I don't make adjustments to a recipe when I rate it, that's not fair to the recipe in my opinion.  Right before serving it, my husband tried it and said something has to be done to this before eating this...it tastes bland and is very dry (I had not simmered it for more than 20 minutes).  I added more ketchup and more mustard.  I finally got it to be "more sloppy" but I will say that I was still disappointed.  I'm either sticking with Manwich or looking for another recipe...bummer!

I agree - this makes the best sloppy joes! I used spicy ground pork (what I had in the freezer) and added two cloves of minced garlic and 1/2 cup of green chiles to the simmer. They turned out great!

This was very simple to make and tasted pretty good.  I doubled the sauce recipe since I like my sloppy joes on the "wet" side.  Next time I make these I will not double the brown sugar as it was a bit too sweet, maybe just 1.5x instead.  Definitely a keeper!

Yum yum! This tastes JUST like the name brand, only better since I know it doesn't have all sorts of nasty preservatives in it!

We love garlic so I added in three minced garlic cloves with the onions/peppers. I also minced up some jalapeno slices too. Yum.

I made this with 2 # ground beef and doubled the rest of ingredients.  I left out the green pepper.  I added diced onion after the meat was browned-we liked the texture and flavor of the onions this way.  I also added a good splash of apple cider vinegar because before that the flavor was just like SWEET ketchup.  IMHO, the apple cider vinegar  made all the difference.  We were in a hurry and just warmed it through without the simmering and it was still flavorful and yummy.  We liked the thickness, as it stayed on the buns well, even piling it high!  Great basic recipe, but adjust sweetness according to your family's likes.  Thanks Tamara!

This is really Great!!!  I tripled the recipe and also used half ketchup and half barbecue sauce.  This is the best sloppy joe we have ever had!

Just a tip:  we had this for lunch with rolls, then for dinner,  I placed the left over on a 9x13 casserole dish, made the "Grandma Buttermilk Cornbread" also from this site, poured on top of the sloppy joe and baked until the corn bread was ready.  Delicious! and great for my meal plan.

I love this recipe.  So easy and tasty.  I usually make a double batch and freeze it.  My husband suggested we use this as stuffing for green peppers so maybe I'll try that.

When I read all of the rave reviews I was skeptical.  After all, how GREAT can Sloppy Joes really be?  

WELL, I followed the recipe EXACTLY and to my surprise I found it to be absolutely delicious,  easy to prepare and almost addictive.  

Anytime we need a fast and tasty meal in the future, or 'football food' this will be my go to recipe.  It is especially good with sweet cabbage slaw topping!!  Yum!!

Let's just say that after I made the first batch I had to run out and buy more ingredients to make a second batch. I'm currently dieting my my DH and kids said this was "the bomb". I did what I always do- I added my own touch by adding a tablespoon of A-1 steak sauce. served on soft hawaiin soft buns. Definitely a keeper!

This has been my go to recipe for sloppy joes for a while. As suggested by others, I used 1/2c ketchup & 1/4c BBQ sauce. Also replaced powdered garlic with bottled minced garlic. Added a couple drops of hot sauce for some zing. Great when made with ground turkey. Great recipe!

I wouldn't call this a Sloppy Joe, it was more a loose meat (think Maid Rite) sandwich. I had to add 1 can of tomato sauce, 2 tablespoons of tomato paste, 1 tablespoon of worcestershire sauce and a little more mustard for this to taste more like Sloppy Joes. I gave 2 stars because, if I ever want to make Maid Rites, I'd add a can of cola and this would be a good recipe.

Soooo good! I like mine saucy so I doubled the garlic and mustard. I also omitted the brown sugar and added in 3/4 C Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory and Brown Sugar BBQ sauce. Two of my kids don't eat well so I threw in a can of V-8, which made it a tad too sweet so I then added a tablespoon or so of white vinegar. As written, it's a great recipe, that my parents later informed me is the very recipe that they've been using since I was a kid. But, I tweaked it this evening for my family's diverse taste buds and, surprisingly, got thumbs up from even the pickiest of children. :)

Just made this for a quick lunch for my sons. The only changes I made were: 1. added about a tablespoon of worchestershire. 2.I didnt chop the green pepper. I put it in the recipe as rings. My youngest doesnt like the texture so I just put the rings of pepper on everyones sandwich except his. I kinda like it that way.

Yikes!  Way too sweet!  Hubby and I have been low carbing for two years, and things just taste too sweet anymore.  I still gave it four stars because the base recipe is AWESOME and EASY!  Next time I will cut the brown sugar way down, if use it at all.  I took the advice of another person and added Worcestershire sauce and white vinegar.  Nice, zesty addition!  Also tossed in some red pepper flakes, because I enjoy heat.  Also, I didn't think it was soupy enough, so added some tomato sauce and a little bit of water.  By the time it was done simmering, it was the perfect consistency.   I was getting pretty tired of the same old Manwich routine.  This is a great alternative.

Very tasty, though not very saucy. I prefer "saucier" sloppy joes but it is not hard to just add extra BBQ sauce. A keeper for quick, easy recipe.

We decided to make the recipe as is. I think that the meat was too sweet it didn't need the sugar added. Also it was a bit bland next time I would have put in some diced tomatoes.

It was so good.  I usually used the McCormic packets but I am so not going back to those.  These were really tasty me and my husband truly enjoyed them.  I did change somethings.  First I used turkey instead of beef so it was a little bit healthier.  Then I took another reviewers advice I did 1/2 cup of ketchup and used 1/4 cup of Bulls Eye BBQ sauce the Memphis style.  I did not use mustard not a fan of it so I didnt have anything.  Will def make this again =D

So good. The only thing I changed at the last minute was stirring in a 15 oz can of drained chopped tomatoes.  Not sure why I did that but it was great anyway.  This will be my "go to" recipe for Sloppy Joes. Thanks for posting it.

This is one of my favorite crockpot recipes for parties.  After I brown the meat I stick everything in the crockpot and put on low.  Sometimes I make it the night before and let the flavor set in.  Very good, thank you for the recipe.

The kids really liked this.  I thought is was way too, sweet.  I follow the first part of the recipe until the ketchup. I usually use 1 8 oz can tomato sauce, instead of ketchup, 1 1/2 tsp chili powder, 1 tsp worcestershire (and hot sauce).  I also forgot to buy buns and put it in a pita.  It wasn't sloppy and it stayed really hot.  I think I'll do that from now on.

A good base recipe. I used ground turkey and I had to double the recipe. After taste testing I decided it need some bbq sauce. After that it was pretty tasty!

This was really tasty, great flavor, but a little dry for my husband and I and that was after adding about 1/2 c. of water before simmering.  It was super easy to make and super versitile.  Next time, I will try adding some hot sauce or cajun seasoning for something for variation.  :)

Made this last night for large crowd.  used the servings calculater to adjust to 5 lbs of ground beef,and other ingredients, then added more to taste.Used a red and yellow pepper and no brown sugar (ketchup is sweet enough for me) Put it in a crock pot to simmer and let everyone serve themselves.  It was a HUGE hit! Not 1 bite left! Rave reviews from my guests and very economical to feed a large crowd. Will make t again!

Oops!   I left out some ingredients, but it came out perfect anyway. I skipped the bell pepper, salt, black pepper, and brown sugar. I used chopped spring onions instead of regular onions (the taste is milder). What can I say?  Both my husband and I thought this was scrumptious. Next time I'm doubling the recipe!

Doesn't need the brown sugar and definitely needs some worcestershire and possibly a splash of vinegar.  When using a ketchup base, it makes it too sweet for brown sugar.  I do use brown sugar when making a tomato paste base recipe.  I thought this one looked really easy, so I made it instead of my stand by as I was in a time crunch.

We make this often, including at our yearly Pumpkin Carving Party! Everyone loves it, and we've even used the same sauce over vegetarian crumbles for the vegetarians. They enjoyed it as well!

This was wonderful! I added extra onion and bell peppers because that's my husbands favorite and used a little garlic salt instead of regular salt... mmmmmm good! :-)

This was absolutely delicious.  Instead of using garlic powder, I minced a large clove of garlic and added that in to cook about a minute before I drained the fat off of the meat and veggies.  I also did not have enough ketchup.. only a half cup.. so I substituted the last 1/4 cup with a good squirt (probably about 2oz) of tomato paste and a splash of water.  I think it gave it a deeper flavor.  This recipe will be used over and over in my house!

This was very good.  My whole family loved it.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because it was a bit sweet for me.  I had to add a bit more mustard to cut the sweetness.  Other than that it was great!  I will definitely be making it again.

This recipe made great Sloppy Joes. I tripled the recipe because I was having many over and it still came out good. NOTE, don't add as much Brown Sugar, unless you like your joes extra sweet, but overall, they were really good and I will make again.

Thanks for a great recipe - DH requested this twice before I got a picture and did a review!  Didn't add salt & pepper at the end and cannot tell a difference.  Served with Baked French Fries I from this site and Sunflower Broccoli Salad.  I'll never buy the can stuff again!

Delicious!!! I don't really care for sloppy Joes normally. Scarred as a child ;)
my husband LOVES them though so I figured I'd try this recipe. So Yummy!!! Very easy to through together as well! Both children (8&12) loved them as well.

A nice change to make the Sloppy Joes from scratch rather than from a can. This will become a regular in our house.

If I could give this a rating of 0 I would! Both my husband and I disliked it and then was suprised to see that our 7 year old and 1 year old disliked it as well. This recipe is WAY to sweet and I even cut back on the brown sugar. I was hesitant to use ketchup because I normally use tomato sauce, which is more traditional. I even tried fixing the sweetness by adding 1/2 can tomato paste and some water but nothing helped. I nearly gagged and couldnt believe this recipe got such high reviews.

Very yummy, I would have rated it 5 stars but I tweaked it a little. I added some Worcestershire sauce and a little liquid smoke...still it was delicous! The green pepper really makes it!

My family liked this recipe.  I thought simmering for 30 minutes seemed a bit too long as there wasn't much sauce and the mixture seemed a bit dry, so I simmered about 15 minutes.  I used both green and red peppers and they seemed a little crunchy -- maybe that's why it should simmer for 30  minutes?  This recipe is a great alternative to using canned Sloppy Joe sauce.

Although this wasn't bad, it was far too sweet.  Would recommend using far less sugar.  Perhaps lowering to 1 tsp brown sugar or finding a lower sugar ketchup would help.

I've been using this recipe for about 6 months now and it's yummy.  I made it the way it's written the first time and then made some changes after that.  I add a couple teaspoons of worcestishire and about 3/4 cup of sweet baby rays bbq sauce cuz we like it  little saucier than the original recipe calls for.  It's very adaptable and a good starter recipe and so quick and easy - great fall back meal on those busy nights.  Thanks Tamara!

Amazing!  I don't even like Sloppy Joes, but for some reason I just had a craving for it!  I didn't have any green peppers so I substituted green chilies and I made my own ketchup (1 cup tomato sauce, 1/2 cup sugar, and 2 Tbsp vinegar) because I was out of that too!  These were absolutely the best Sloppy Joes I've ever had!

This was excellent!  I had a pound and a half of beef so doubled the sauce recipe. After reading the reviews I added a few dashes of worcestershire, and replaced some of the ketchup with bbq sauce. Will definitely make this again.

This was easy enough that my husband actually made dinner.  He did put the onions and peppers in the food processor because kids would be picky about seeing the peppers.  This was very good, everyone had seconds.

tasted great!  You will want to double the sauce and seasonings, otherwise it would be too dry.  Was a hit for dinner with all our boys!  Loved how simple it was to put together. I will try it in a crock pot next time.  Thanx for posting :)

This is not a great sloppy joe recipe, but it does the job it is supposed to do.  It's simple with very few ingredients and tastes like sloppy joes out of the can would.  The ketchup is the main flavor, and in the end retains a lot of that flavor.  If you want the DELICIOUS sloppy joe recipe that your mother made, this isn't it.  If you want something simple and easy, that is healthier than the canned stuff, this is for you.

This recipe is delicious and a must keep. I make it often for my husband and I and we're never disappointed. I only give it 4 stars because the amount of brown sugar the original recipe calls for is too much for me. I usually half it, and that is great. I also use half BBQ sauce and half ketchup instead of the full ketchup amount!

Sadly, this was quite bland. Needed so much more spicing.  Not a recipe I will use again.  The canned stuff if good enough for the 2 times a year I need it.

I followed the recipe exactly, except I added a little more ketchup and a splash of worcestershire sauce... All I can say is I'll never use the canned stuff again!  This tasted soooo much fresher and better... The only thing I might do different next time is cut the brown sugar down to 2 teaspoons, as it seemed just a tad too sweet.  Other than that, it was perfect!  :)

Not one of my favorites, but my family all loved them and my husband is in love. I added some worcestershire sauce - probably about a tablespoon. I've made this twice and the second time doubled the recipe and used 1c. tomato sauce and 1/2c. honey barbeque sauce. I froze the leftovers in muffin cups as suggested by others - one muffin cup is enough for a sandwich. So clever. Thanks!

My #1 Sloppy Joe recipe I go to.  Been making this recipe most of my life. Sometimes I leave out the green pepper because of those that don't like it but I love it in the recipe. This is just a basic home cooking comfort food. I cook large recipes of this and then freeze it in smaller containers to heat up or use in other casserole recipes. Works great.UPDATE:  I just served sloppy joes to our church for Lenten service dinner. I adjusted the recipe for 120 and that took two 10# rolls of burger to make. We left out the green peppers and cut the brown sugar to half and used 1/2 cup of dried onions instead of fresh. Easy. We served 150 servings with that and received rave reviews.

Quick, easy and good. I doubled the recipe but substituted 1/4 c. of the ketchup with Heinz Chili sauce and served on whole wheat buns. Awesome!

Fabulous!  I made this recipe to the letter, but used 25 pounds of meat.  We had a church Halloween party that I made it for.  The ratios were perfect!  I am living in China right now, so I am very grateful this recipe turned out so well for 2 reasons.  One, I had no other options if it didn't.  Two, ketchup costs $4 a bottle here.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

Awesome! I also subbed some of the ketchup with some Aurthor Bryant's BBQ sauce. (it's a vinegar base) I also added a lil sneaky chef puree of spinach and blueberries (sounds gross but you don't even taste it, I swear!!) to up the nutritional value.  Both my 2 and 4 yr old girls inhaled it!!! This will be added to our rotation for sure!!! TY!!

I LOVE this recipe and it's a hit every time I make it. Just had it for dinner tonight and my bf, who is British and visiting for 3 months, really liked it. Was his first time having Sloppy Joes. Not too sweet nor too spicy. I made it as is except for two small changes: I used 1 tsp of SF Brown Sugar instead of regular since my Dad is severely diabetic. I cut it down as SF tends to be sweeter than regular. Go figure on that one. I also used Dijon mustard instead of regular for a small little kicker. Everything else was as is and absolutely delicious. Thank You!

My girlfriend mentioned making sloppy joes and we ran to the gas station to see if they sold Manwich. They didn't so I grabbed bbq sauce and ketchup knowing I could find a recipe online. We found this one and made it. It tastes great! Instead of 3/4c. ketchup, we followed the advice of another review and did 1/2c. ketchup and 1/4c. bbq sauce. Also we had to double the recipe for more sauce.

Awesome recipe!  I doubled it for my hungry family and substituted some BBQ sauce when I didn't have enough ketchup.  It ended up being 2 parts ketchup to 1 part BBQ sauce.  I also added some minced garlic.  Tasted great!  I will make this again soon.

Great recipe!  Uses ingredients I usually have on hand.  I took the suggestion from another reviewer and froze in muffin tins.  Great to have on hand and pop out of the freezer for a quick meal.  Thanks Tamara for a delicious recipe.

These sloppy joes were very tatsy, but they have more of a sweet base rather than tomato.  Only change I made was to add Worcestershire sauce.

This was very good and will certain be a recipe that I'll refer to again.  As with other reviewers, I added a little water, reduced the sugar to 1.5 tsp.  The mustard was a little strong me, so next time, for our tastes, I would reduce that as well.  Also added a splash of Worcestershire; it's not needed, but it adds a bit more flavor.  Thank you, Tamara, for this submission!

We tried this recipe many months ago and this has become a twice a month standard in our house.  My husband never like sloppy joes (manwhich, etc...) but absolutely LOVES this recipe.  I highly recommend to anyone.  It is wonderful without any changes to the recipe.

I agree with others; this is a very good basic starting receipe.  If you do not like the taste of green pepper as it can be a little bitter, add red pepper.  I would not leave out due to the health benefits of the pepper.  I like to adjust the receipes to make them as healthy as possible.  This is so easy to adjust to your individual preferences, less sugar, more heat, more sloppy, etc. As for Ozzychef.  You obviously do not know anything about Sloppy Joes so do not comment on something you know nothing about.

This is very similar to the sloppy joe recipe I cobbled together from various other recipes. The only differences are that I add some Worcestershire sauce, and I use tomato paste instead of ketchup. It's delicious.

SO Good! I did make a few revisions...  1. 2 Tbsp. onion flakes instead of 1/4 c. chopped     onion 2. Omitted bell pepper 3. 1 c. ketchup instead of 3/4 c. 4. Omitted brown sugar 5. Added 1/2 Tbsp. worcestershire 6. 1/2 c. water  I added all these AFTER I browned the meat. I let it simmer about 10 min.

Wonderful!  I don't foresee buying Manwich ever again.  It was such a hit last night we're having it for dinner again, tonight.  We need a double batch and I added more green pepper and onion.  I only have garlic salt with parsley so I just didn't add salt.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Could put manwich out of business!!  Very tasty - added about 1/2 tsp of horseradish just to satisfy my tastebuds.

This is a great recipe. I used red bell pepper instead of green (what we had on hand) and jazzed it up to meet a more adult palate. We added red pepper flakes, paprika, cayenne pepper, apple cider vinegar, and worceshtire. My fiancee' who doesn't like sloppy joes, just like this so thank you for posting this on allrecipes.

This was absolutely delicious. I had to rate it. We are actually on a vegan diet during lent and also other times of the year. Instead of the beef, we used portabella mushrooms & I only had spicy brown mustard so I used that. Very simple sauce and your recipe was written perfectly, those were the only things I did differently. So, you can also post a vegan-friendly Sloppy Joe recipe. I thank you for a comforting sauce recipe. We didnt have rolls on hand & it's way to cold to go to the store just for that. We did have pillsbury crescent roll dough. I used one can & lined it into a square pan like a pie crust, if you will; slapped on the sloppy joe and then used another one on top. Pretty good. Thats how I cheat and make a pot pie/casserole in a hurry.

I am surprised!!!  This recipe was great, and my son enjoyed it too.. I made minor adjustments, instead of 1 cup of ketchup I used 3/4 ketchup and 1/4 masterpiece bbq sauce, and added diced jalopenos to spice it up.  delicious, simple, and  economical..

I used this recipe for work and make it 250 serving the only thing I will change next time is, cancel out the brown sugar. With the larger amount the ketchup would make it sweet enough. We served it open-face and was enjoyed by all. THANK-YOU for making the recipes able to change amounts, this helps out when having to make large amounts.

I've never made sloppy joes before. This was really easy and yummy! My little boys liked it too. Husband thought it was too sweet, and he's probably right - I used less brown sugar than it called for but with the ketchup sweetness, it could use even less or none.

I've made this recipe quite a few times and it always amazes me that such odd on-hand ingredients can be combined to produce such a wonderful meal.  I always double it and we still never have enough we eat so much of it!  This is great to use up the rest of the huge package of frozen hamburgers from the summer.  Great recipe that turns out perfect every time even if you don't measure.  Delicious!

This was an "ok" recipe... I used turkey meat instead of beef, and tomato sauce instead of ketchup. Perhaps thats why it was just ok. It tasted kind of bland to me. I think if I make this again I will try to spice it up a bit more... for me it just wasn't tasty enough.

WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL!!! Have tried several sloppy joe recipes and this is by far...THE BEST!!  Only change I made was to reduce brown sugar by half (we didn't like it so sweet) and add 1 TBLS Worcheshire sauce.  This is now THE recipe for our house.

This is a great, easy recipe!  My family does not really care for sloppy joes, but really like these.  I did add 2 Tbsp Worchestershire sauce to cut the ketchup flavor down just a bit.

Made these for the family for the first time, and they loved them ! I just made a couple of tweaks, though. I used 1/4 cup BBQ sauce + 1/2 cup ketchup, and to avoid soggy hamburger buns, I toasted the insides of the buns under the broiler until lightly browned. Load the bottom halves with the meat, top with some sauteed mushroom slices if desired, then some shredded mozza cheese, and put just the bottom halves back under the broiler for 1-2 minutes until the mozza melts. Cover with the upper bun halves, and serve. Delicious !

The first time I tried this it was bland and WAY too sweet but had something that made me want to try again.  2nd time I cut the sugar and ketchup in 1/2 and used tomato sauce in place of the ketchup.  Also added cayenne.  Still too sweet and too bland.  I'll try another recipe next time.  Maybe it needs more onion?  Dunno.

Very good basic sloppy joe recipe. I halved the recipe to serve two adults, and added a bit of chili powder and a dash of cayenne to add a little zing. Omitted the brown sugar. Served on wheat buns. Per boyfriend's request, will increase the amount of ketchup next time to make a saucier sloppy joe. A keeper!

These beat the store bought canned kind, any day!  All I had was a red pepper, so I used that.  Lightly buttered and broiled fresh deli buns.  My family raved.  Even my husband who is a sloppy joe hater, thought these were great.  It's nice too that you usually have all the ingredients alredy.  Kudos

This is pretty much the recipe I've used for years and years.  I included this recipe in a cookbook with all their other favorites when my grown kids moved from home .
 
I usually added a touch of vinegar a can of tomato soup to hold it together more.  
As a matter of fact, I use the same ingredients for baked bean...without the meat, of course...but seasoned with browned bacon or sausage balls. Everyone loves baked beans this way too.

Thumbs up for sure! I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, because I had it on hand and was a tad worried. I shouldn't have it rocked!

I used ground turkey and added a packet of McCormick dry sloppy joe seasoning. It needed extra flavor in my opinion. Great base though. No need for the can mix.

Sloppy Joes are a favorite at my house and these were the best we've had!  I added 2 tsp. worcestershire sauce because I like that flavor with beef, but other than that I kept it all the same.  I only had biscuits on hand, so I served it over biscuits.

These were very good! I made a few small changes/substitutions.  I used ground turkey instead of hamburger (I couldn't tell the difference)!  I also added celery instead of green pepper (didn't have any). I added a little extra ketchup and brown sugar as well.  Will definitely make again.

This was a nice base Sloppy Joe recipe...pretty much just what I was looking for.  I used ground turkey instead of beef and pureed the green pepper and onion so that my 2-yr old would eat it.  Yum yum!

Wonderful wonderful! I substituted ground turkey and added a couple of dashes of Tabasco. I'll use this one again.

Very very tasty. Drier than I like my sloppies, but excellent flavor. I made them as stated (with the exception of adding some parsley) because I needed the nutrition info. Next time I might add an extra squirt of ketchup. Was halfway through making them before realizing I there was not a bun to be had in the house, so we ate it with rice and it was very good.

Awesome recipe!!! I used 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup Bar-B-Q sauce, omitted the green pepper for the kids and it came out great!!!  My picky son that hates beef even ate it!!! This is definitely a keeper!! Great with toasted buns and a slice of cheese. Even more wonderful is that it is a really quick recipe.

The green pepper is a downfall in this recipe. I will make this again and omit the pepper but it just kind of ruined the flavor. I did add a little bit of oatmeal to thicken up the sauce.

These were good and my kids loved them!  My kids, especially my son doesn't like spicy, and these aren't spicy at all. Very sweet, if you like the sweet kind of sloppy joes.  As someone said, the recipe doesn't make a whole lot, so if you are making a bunch of sloppy joes, double or even triple the recipe.  Also, if you would like them a little more "saucier", you can add a little water and it thickens up nicely, but keeps a nice sauce.

My husband requested sloppy joes the other night, and so I thought I'd try making them from scratch. I took the advice of some of the reviewers and did part BBQ sauce/part ketchup and I went heavy on the onions and garlic. I thought it tasted just like sloppy joes are supposed to, and he loved it - "it's a keeper!" were his words. :)

When I think of sloppy joes I think of really gooey meat sauce.  This was too dry for us.  Will keep looking for another recipe.

I have never been a fan of Sloppy Joes, but most men in my life are. So I made it my goal to find a recipe to help me enjoy Sloppy Joes. This recipe is so GREAT!!! Sloppy Joes are now one of my favorite meals. I love how they are more sweet then salty. Great to freeze and reheat for lunch.

This recipe is excellent!  My husband loves sloppy joes and was not disappointed.  Much better than the canned stuff.  I added some Worcestershire and a little cayenne for kick.  Also good with whole wheat buns rather than white ;)

Great recipie! Everyone loved it. Had to use onion powder because some won't eat onions and left out the peppers for same reason. Will use the whole recipie when the fussies leave home.

This recipe is a good one, except I added a Tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, a few shakes of hot pepper sauce, and instead of 3/4 cup of ketchup I used 1 cup of ketchup.  I also added some diced celery and added some water to make them sloppier. (If you like them sloppy then add as little or as much water as you would like). My daughter eats the leftover meat during the week. Everyone asks for 2nds.

Very easy and delicious!  I increased the recipe for a Halloween party for 32 people and they were delicious.  I cooked everything and then put the finished sloppy joes in my crock pot at low for about 4hours.  I added a little more ketchup to the crock pot to keep it moist.  EXCELLENT!

Simply wonderful! I doubled the sacue recipe. After I had put in what the sauce called for I was sure it was not going to be "sloppy" enough. It was perfect with the sauce doubled. I also did not let it simmer for the full 30 minutes, only about 15-20 b/c my family was hungry. I also used 1.29lb GROUND TURKEY instead of beef, served on whole wheat rolls. Had asparagas and beans as a side, YUMMY!!!! Plenty left over after feeding my husband, myself, and our two toddlers.

Thank you!!! WIll use this over and over again!

Great, quick & easy recipe!  I made a few additions; since my daughter informed me that she was going to have a friend over for dinner.  I added 1/4 C quick oats, 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, about 10 dashes of Worchestershire sauce.  This extended this dish nicely - I will definitely keep this recipe on hand for a great quick meal.

Really delicious! I was a little concerned that they would be too sweet, but no problems. I also added some hot sauce (Texas Pete) for a little heat and that was a good call! Served on soft potato rolls and my friend loved it! Thanks!

This was a life saver for me the other night, when I had already browned hamburger for sloppy joes, and couldn't find the can of Manwich(gasp!)that I thought for sure I had. I had never made sloppy joes from scratch before. This was easy. I decreased the brown sugar to 2t, omitted the mustard, used fresh garlic, and added more ketchup. Delicious! I'll never need Manwich again. Thanks!!

Great recipe!  I added a can of tomato sauce (as some others had suggested) for more "slop".  I also added a teaspoon of onion powder, a teaspoon of minced garlic, a teaspoon of paprika, a tablespoon of bbq sauce, a tablespoon of steak sauce, a tablespoon of worchestershire sauce and a few splashes of cayenne pepper sauce.  Absolutely wonderful!  Thanks, Tamara!

I've never eaten a sloppy joe before, but figured I'd give this a try.  The sugar/hamburger/onion taste kind of freaked me out.  Four hours later, I just got sick.  Literally.

Very good recipe. I didn't have quite enough ketchup so I topped off what I didn't have with some red hot sauce.  It added a really nice kick to it that I've never had in a sloppy joe before! I would suggest if it isn't "sloppy" enough for some people, to just add some water to it after adding all the ingredients and then letting it simmer until a lot of it cooks off. Very tasty! Thanks!

This made an easy and tasty dinner.  I added fresh garlic and used brown bread instead of buns.  To complete the meal, I also made potatoe skins as a side.  Will be keeping this one for sure.

Yum! Omitted green pepper (didn't have any) and added oatmeal to get it super thick per previous review.  So good - no left overs!

This recipe turned out delicious, and is super easy.  I also added 1 T. of white vinegar, and 1 T. of Worcestershire Sauce to the mixture.  Will be making this again for sure.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this because my hubby was craving a sloppy joe.  Neither of us had eaten one since we were kids so we didn't know what to expect. It was really good!  I did make a few changes: like others I used 2 cloves of garlic instead of powder.  I also added 3 T. Worcestershire and 1 T. cider vinegar. While it was simmering I decided it needed more liquid so I added some water and more ketchup. To make it more appealing to my kids I took a suggestion from another website and put the mixture on two crescent roll triangles, added cheese, then put two more crescent roll triangles on top, sealed them together and baked it at 375 for 10 minutes.  Yum!

Oooooh... this is good! I haven't even finished cooking it yet and I know it is good.  

So glad I didn't have anything for dinner tonight and looked up sloppy joes.  I think the family will gobble this down.

Super easy and delicious. The first time I made it I made the mistake of adding salt and using spicy mustard think it wouldn't make a difference. IT DID. DON"T ADD SALT. DON'T USE SPICEY MUSTARD.

I love this recipe, and so does my 19 month old and my hubby!!! It is so easy and tastes great. After reading other reviews, I was worried about it being too sweet so I did a small heaping 1/4 C. of green pepper and a heaping teaspoon of mustard instead of leveling them, and it turned out just right.  Also, I think that the sauce would've burned if I simmered it for 30 min. because it barely coated the meat. So, I added some water and let that simmer down, and that worked wonderfully. Thanks so much, I was looking for a good sloppy joe recipe for over a year and I finally found it!!!

Yummy!  Made these for father's day and everyone loved it!  I did however deviated from the recipe.  I doubled the recipe, and tripled the sauce.  Used real garlic and red bell pepper.  I left out the brown sugar, used 1 1/2 cups of ketchup and 1/2 of bbq sauce (honey garlic).  I didn't have mustard powder, so I just added a tblsp of mustard and a few dashes of worschetire sauce and added one tomato, diced.  Turned out perfect, not too sweet and not too much bbq flavor, all flavors balanced out nicely.  Served this with fries on the side, everyone said this was a keeper!  Thanks

These are so much better than Manwich!!!  I'd never made homemade sloppy joes before and I was really surprised at how easy it is.  The sauce was really tangy and tasty.  We finished them off the next day as leftovers and they tasted even better then.  This recipe is definitely going to become a keeper.

Very easy.  My boyfriend thought it was a bit sweet.  I thought it was perfect.  Maybe a tad less brown sugar if you don't like your Joes too sweet.  I was worried at first glance at the ingredients.  Thought it might need something more but, it was fine just the way it is.  I made this recipe and it was perfect for three large adult sandwiches or four smaller adult sandwiches.

This was a great recipe! I did not add the green peppers or onions because I do not enjoy that in my sloppy joes, but it worked out great for me without them. Very tasty and very easy to make when you have had a long day and don't feel like cooking much but want a decent meal!

I love this recipe and will use it to feed about 45 people at our Post.  I will change two things:  First, I am diabetic and the 3 Tbs. of Brown sugar is a bit much.  I have made this recipe 3 times and seem to like only one TBS in my sauce.  Second, I need a little bit more sauce.  The sauce is so easy and inexpensive.  I am placing this recipe in "My Favorite Cookbook", which is personalized to my liking.  Thanks again.

This is a great classic sloppy joe taste. I increase the mustard to two teaspoons to offset the ketchup taste and finish it in the crock pot.  It is truly yummy after a few hours. Thanks Tamara!

We LOVED this recipe!  Easy to make and quick too!  I substituted one fresh diced jalapeno (seeds and all) for the bell pepper while frying up the hamburger meat to give it a little kick and a tasty zing!  We will definitely be eating this one again soon!!

This was my mom’s recipe too.  I don’t use bell pepper because hubby doesn’t like it.  I use this same recipe for sloppy joe pie.  Super easy for a bit of a change.  I buy refrigerated boxed pie crust, bake bottom crust 5 minutes or so on 450 so it is baked throughout, then fill with mix, sprinkle grated cheese, cover with top crust and bake 15 minutes or so until golden brown.  Tx for a great recipe!

This recipe is fantastic! As close to what my mom used to make from scratch as I've found. I always follow a recipe exactly the first time I make it. The only think I will change on this one is to reduce or eliminate the brown sugar. And that's saying something because I like my sloppy Joe's sweet. Even as is, the flavors are fantastic. Just seemed a little sweet. Thanks Tamara!

This is a great recipe!  Like others, I used 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup bar-b-que sauce and then omit the brown sugar.  I just took a large batch of this into work and it was a huge success.  Will be making this often for large groups because of its simplicity, as well for a quick dinner now and then.  Thank you for sharing your mothers recipe.

My husband begs me to make this every week with some crispy crowns that he puts on top of the sloppy joe. He absolutely loves it! It's so simple to make, yet tastes so delicious! It's even better left over the next day.

Very good. Everyone loved it, but I used tomato paste and some water instead of the ketchup (can't have sugar), used crushed real garlic instead of garlic powder, and some stevia instead of brown suger.

These were absolutely perfect!  I have already made THIS recipe numerous times and it is definately a family favorite!  I have used ground turkey instead of ground beef, just as good and less calories!

My husband and I never liked sloppy Joe's. It always reminded us when we were kids and that was the meal your mom and dad would make that we didn't like. This recipe made us love sloppy Joe's as adults now. The only thing I did different was substitute 1/4 cup of bbq sauce from the ketchup and I didn't add any sugar just like one of the reviews mentioned on here.

I am willing to give it another go, but, as some have said, it is a bit too sweet, and I feel there is not enough tang (acid) to it. Perhaps some Worcester and heat would help. But I am partial to spicy things.

Tried it tonight, changed it a little. I used 1 1/2tsp. Minced garlic,1 1/2c. ketchup, 1 1/2  Tblsp. Mustard, 6 Tblsp. Brn  sugar for sauce, & since I only use extra lean hamburger , there was no liquid to drain. With the onions & green pepper, I used  2/3 of each. My husband was ecstatic, he said it was The Best sloppy joes he'd ever eaten. I know he meant it, coz he is a food freak & if he hadn't liked it, he would NOT have eaten it. He would have hit a junk fast food instead. He actually ate 3. We will definitely be having this on a reg. basis. Thank you for the excellent recipe Tamara.

I made this tonight and we loved it, I did follow Meredith's suggestion of replacing 1/4 cup of ketchup with BBQ sauce and added some chili powered since we like it a little spicy but it was awesome! Thank you for sharing this and thank you to Allrecipes for sending the daily recipes it is so nice not to have to think what is for dinner tonight!

This is the same recipe that my Mom makes all the time and I do also, we sometimes swap the peppers for celery or add a teaspoon of A1 or Worcestershire sauce, also after you mix in everything we will add water just to cover the meat and let is simmer till it thickens.  Also we sometime take a bowl and just dip potato chips in.

Got it in email today and decided to try it. It went over really well with some friends who were over. 4 stars because it's a bit too sweet otherwise really good. Goes good with a medium dry red wine.

I have used this recipe for years and my family has loved it.  It is easy to do and one always seems to have the ingredients on hand.  One thing I sometimes do is add a little salsa to the mix as it is cooking.  Also if I don't have brown sugar, I substitute a tablespoon of white vinegar and a tablespoon of white sugar.

After I found this recipe, I have refused to buy the canned sloppy-jo mix......My hubs and both love it..I have not switched anything up EXCEPT adding red pepper flakes when we want to spice it up! Great recipe Tamara! Thank you for sharing.

Just want to interject here that preparing Sloppy Joes (or meat loaf) was always met with groans from my family. Then they would eat every last morsel!

Based on other reviews, I used 1/2 C Ketchup & 1/4 C BBQ Sauce.  My son doesn't care for Green Peppers, so I substituted chopped celery.  It was a big hit!  The flavors were really good.  Thanks for a great, easy recipe.

A little sweet. On second try I used a mix of tomatoe paste and sauce in place of ketchup and reduced brown sugar by 1 tablespoon. A little more to our taste but still held the great consistency.

I've made this twice now and the only change I made the second time was that I cut back the brown sugar to 2 tsp so it wasn't quite so sweet. I did make this ahead and then let it heat for a couple of hours in the crock pot. I put a little water in the crock pot (just enough to cover the bottom) before adding the sloppy Joe to thin it out a bit. My whole family loved it.

It was great! I didn't have green pepper so I substituted finely sliced celery.  Instead of simmering for 30 min; put the cooked beef mixture in the crock pot with the sauce on low for 90 min or so.  Will defiantly make again!

I pulled back considerably on the brown sugar and at the suggestion of another member added in a 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce. Anyway...it was still way too sweet, too thick and no real live flavor. I spent another 30 minutes trying to fix it. Sorry but this is a 1 star recipe at best.

My family loved this recipe. I did change a few things. I did 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup  honey BBQ sauce, 1/4 cup of tomato sauce, and  1 Tbs of A1 sauce.  I also added a 1/4 Cup of finely chopped celery.  I will be making this again.

Delicious! Next time I'm doubling the "sauce." I used spicy brown mustard because that's what I had on hand and it came out great! No more canned stuff! Keeping this one!

We use this recipe exclusively and love it. I Do add a dash of chili powder, and 1/3 cup of dry oats (helps it stick together well), and we always serve Brickhouse slaw on top. (2 cups shredded cabbage,1/4 c. diced onion, 1 shredded carrot, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/8 tsp black pepper, 2/3 cup real mayonnaise)--my husband was NEVER a slaw fan but now refuses to have his Joes served any other way!!) Excellent recipe!

This is our fave recipe for sloppy joes. I like my joes more soupy so I add a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes. I swipe out the green pepper for 2 cups of diced celery. I also add a tablespoon of white balsamic vinegar. It adds another level of flavor but it  does not taste vinegary at all.  I do this to cut the sweet flavor of the  brown sugar. I brown hamburger buns in butter. Yummy

This was great! Added about 1/3 cup of BBQ sauce and that was a good add. Next time I will add the BBQ sauce but omit the brown sugar.

I made this recipe tonight, using the prescribed pound of hamburger, and more than doubling the amounts of onion & green pepper. I also used minced garlic instead of powder. It was a hit with my old sidekick here, who likes foods sweet. I wasn't quite so impressed, so next time I may use molasses instead of the brown sugar. I also added a sprinkle of ground red pepper to offset the sweetness. But overall, I would judge it a very good recipe and will be making it more often, if only to stay on the good side of this husband with the gargantuan sweet tooth!

This was a great recipe!  My husband loved it and said it was much better than store bought.  I did, however, double the sauce because I was afraid it would be too dry otherwise and it turned out perfect for us doubling the sauce!

Made recommended changes- used 1/4 c. Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce for 1/4 c. ketchup.  Added a splash of Worcestershire sauce. Thinned out with a bit of beef broth.  Very good with the alterations!  My new SJ recipe.

This was great! As a man I can attest that cooking does not come easy. This recipe however made me believe I could be the next iron chef! Thanks! 

BTW - I did half a cup of ketchup and a quarter cup of BBQ.

Great Recipe! Cooked it for my ornry kids tonight and they seem to like it. Little did they know I used Oppsum meat from last weeks hunt. Came out pretty good, instead of onion though try a few cloves of garlic and franks red hot mixed with a whole bottle of Mrs. Dash original, it'll give the meat a little kick, or you can use daves insanity sauce like I did, burned the palate right my youngest, he's still running around the house whining that his mouth hurts... kids these days.

I have never rated a recipe before, but this deserves it! These were the best sloppy joes I've ever had. But I did make a few adjustments. I had 1 1/2 pounds of beef so I used all of it, I didn't have any green peppers so I left those out & I added 1/4 cup of barbecue sauce. My husband loved it so much! He ended up taking the majority of it to work for his lunch and apparently his coworkers absolutely loved it too! Wonderful recipe!

I made this for a gathering with about 75 people - 6 lbs of hamburger later, only had about a tablespoon left!  Served with slider buns for smaller portions.  I added about 2 tsp more of mustard and 3 extra tsp of brown sugar.  I like my sloppy joes a little sweet.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe 99% of the way and the family loved it.  I brought it to work for a pot luck holiday luncheon since it was crock pot friendly as well.  Only addition I made was 1.5 teaspoon worcestershire sauce.  I almost minced the onions and peppers so you didn't even know they were there when eating. Easy to make, even the future chefs can help.  We will add to the rotation and never use Manwich again!

Yummy! I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. I didn't have a green pepper so I used a whole onion instead. It came out great & there were no leftovers. Will definitely make again.

The first time I made this recipe I followed it exact, so the five star rating is for the original. That being said, I make these all the time and do a few things differently to simplify things. I use a whole onion and a whole green pepper for 3 reasons: no measuring, added nutrition, and it stretches the 1lb of meat a little further. I use more garlic pwd., less sugar, and sometimes djion mustard. These are definitly a family favorite!

We love this recipe and use it frequently.  Of course, we've tweaked it slightly - we skip the brown sugar, salt, and pepper, and usually use extra onions instead of the green pepper.  We don't bother simmering for 30 minutes - doesn't seem to make much difference.  This recipe also works well with ground turkey instead of ground beef.

It tastes GREAT as written!  It's a good basic recipe - try it as is first, then adjust to your personal taste.  I played around with it - adding more ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, tomato paste, etc., then ended up going back to the original version.  I definitely like the original version the best!  As an American stationed overseas, I was looking for something to replace the canned version, and this is it!  Thanks for the recipe!

These are SO much better than a pre-packaged mix!  Sometimes I add a few tablespoons of barbecue sauce, or a few drops of liquid smoke.  I make two versions; one with ground beef, and the other with Boca for the vegetarians in the house.  Yum!

This is a great recipe and easy to double or quadruple !!  One way to help make the "sauce" .....you  WANT the liquid of the onion and peppers!  So cook the ground beef and drain.   THEN Add everything else and let simmer!!  or throw in crockpot.  I do like adding more of everything!  More peppers, more onion, ect....but it's great as written.  THANKS!

UPDATE: I CAN'T BELIEVE I EVER ALTERED THIS RECIPE. THIS IS PERFECT AS WRITTEN. I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO TRY THIS AS LEAST ONCE, AS IS. THIS WILL NOW BE MY GO-TO (HOMEMADE) SLOPPY JOE RECIPE. I WILL STILL HANG ONTO MY SHORTCUT RECIPE (MY TOH VERSION CALLS FOR A HANDFUL OF CONVENIENCE INGREDIENTS), BUT THIS WILL BE THE ONE I TURN TO WHEN I CRAVE THE "REAL" DEAL. Although I prefer my go-to sloppy Joe recipe a *tad* better, I enjoyed deviating from the "same old, same old." And although fine as is, I made a few changes (I know!). As wifeyluvs2cook did, I too added a T of (Bull's-Eye Original) BBQ sauce, a couple shakes of Worcestershire sauce and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Because my BBQ sauce was pretty sweet, I HALVED the amount of brown sugar called for. None of these changes were necessary, but I can't seem to try a new recipe without making it my own lol! :) Serving our "Joes" with potato chips and dill pickle spears made for a quick, fuss-free meal! Thanks for sharing your recipe, Tamara. :-)

This is an excellent basic recipe for Sloppy Joes that is far more creative than opening up a can of Manwich. I made a few minor changes such as adding crushed red pepper and tobasco sauce. I also added extra garlic powder (1/2 tsp) and additional ketchup and brown sugar because I like my meat on the sweet side. Oh, and speaking of the meat, I used extra lean ground turkey. My bf loved them, and they even tasted good cold. Will make again, and next time might add jalapeno and cayenne for extra heat. Thanks for the recipe!

Good....I had to add about a 1/2 cup water to the recipe because it was too thick to simmer. It is pretty basic, but I guess that is what sloppy joes are meant to be. I would recommend adding extra onion and green pepper if you like it a little more chunky and flavorful.

I made exactly as directed and this was a hit!!  It made about 8 burgers for us.  My husband said it was way better then Manwich and loved that it wasn't too wet.  I added coleslaw on top and loved it!!  He ate them plain. :)

This is great!! So much better than the canned version from the store. My husband and I love the flavor in this. Both of our kids are super picky, and even the pickier of the two, after some coaxing to try it, is eating it by the chipmunk mouth full (cheeks packed to bursting).  I am glad I made a double batch. We'll be making this from now on.

This is the only recipe I ever use for sloppy joes, and they always have come out well.  I generally add a little bit of BBQ sauce to taste, but maybe it's just personal preference.  I also sometimes end up adding more ketchup if the filling seems to dry.  Quick, simple, and tasty recipe!

I have used this recipe for many years but have always added a can of Chicken gumbo soup and simmered about 10 minutes.

This is my go to recipe now.  It is good as is, but I do like to add a tsp vinegar and worchestershire sauce to "tang" it up a bit.

Great recipe. I've been making this for years. Wouldn't change a think. Only thing I do different is add a punch of ground clove.

So good! My fiance loathes manwich (more than most people would expect) so I haven't eaten a sloppy joe in forever. This passed his test by far! I used red pepper insetad of green, and that was the only change in ingredient. I used a little more meat but tried hard not to up the ketchup more than necessary - that stuff is full of more sugar than people realize. It did turn out nice and thick, and was GREAT as leftovers, no surprise! Not a crumb was wasted. Will make again the next time I have ground beef and don't feel like doing anything too fancy. (This is also good on bread, like that 45 calorie a slice bread... just saying.)

The whole family really enjoyed this. Though when I doubled the receipe I put 6 teaspoons of brown sugar, next time I'll only put 4, it was a bit sweet. But I doubled everything else and added extra bell peppers and onion, just because we like it that way.

I was skeptical of the use of ketchup rather than tomato paste, but this was pretty good. I did increase the ratio of veggies to meat, and minced the veggies super-fine, because my son doesn't care for them in "chunks".

My husband and I love this recipe. I didn't have any green bell pepper so I added cucumbers which I had on hand. Also I only had garlic salt so I added 1/4th tsp of that and ommitted the regular salt. I have made this recipe twice already.

This was sooo good...loved the sauce. When it comes to the mixture of ketchup and mustard, I always screw it up because it is too mustardy (yes with a y lol) or too ketchup-ee...I don't know if that is where the brown sugar come in but it tasted so good.

This is a EASY recipe & very good. Eveyone that I have served this to loves it. I followed the recipe to a tee. Update: I  recently had a family dinner, I increased the recipe  6 times to get the amount I needed. Sometimes, when you increase a recipe it doesn't come out right. This came out  perfect

This was very good, much better than the package seasoning mix.  I used ground turkey instead of beef, and took the recommendation of another reviewer and used 1/2 c ketchup and 1/4 c BBQ sauce (Jack Daniels).

I made this on Friday and i had the door to my spice cupboard open, ready with every taste to tweak it to perfection, and after a single test i shut the door because the seasoning was perfectly balanced already! I did have to add a little extra liquid because it was pretty thick but the taste is phenomenal. Don't doubt this awesome recipe!

This is a great last minute recipe. I live in bolivia and it's not very convient here as it is in the us to grab a can of Manwich and this recipe makes an easy soloution to a fast dinner. it was a little sweet for my wow reaction but it was pretty good. I will make it again and maybe try a different brand of ketchup cause the one I used was a little sweet as it was. Overall this is a great recipe, fast, easy, and usually all these ingredients are on hand.

The Best Sloppy Joe I have ever had. I also added some BBQ sauce and Worcestershire Sauce and a little water like you would to taco meat and simmered it until the water evaporated.I will never use canned Sloppy Joe again. Especially when you always have most the ingredients in your pantry!

First off, if you're making this for a family of 4 you'll need to double the recipe. Otherwise the only change I made was decreasing the ketchup and adding some bbq sauce as another reviewer suggested (for doubling: 1c ketchup, 1/2c bbq).
My husband hates sloppy joes but actually had seconds of these.

Quick, easy & tasty. I used lean ground turkey, 1 whole onion, 3 bell peppers, only 2 tbsps Splenda brown sugar and a shot of red wine leftover in the bottle. Served the yummy mixture  up on low fat canned biscuits. Easy, healthy lunch or dinner.

YUMMY and so easy!    The taste was delicious, and my kids devoured it!  Only change was I left out the bell pepper because my kids don't like green pepper.  Next time I'll sub red bell pepper.  Going into my regular rotation.  LOVED that it goes in the crockpot.

4 stars as written, but easy to turn into 5 stars!

Original recipe needs more sauce.

To turn it into 5 stars, use an entire small onion and bell pepper.  Double the sauce ingredients and sub up to 1/2 cup of the ketchup (1.5 cups total) with bbq sauce.  Adjust brown sugar depending on how sweet your bbq sauce is.  We used a honey chipotle to add a bit of heat.

This is very easy to make, and VERY SWEET tasting.  If you are expecting a traditional sloppy joe STOP and look for another recipe.  This is almost too sweet for my tastes, in fact if I make it again I'm going to take out at least one teaspoon of brown sugar!  Even though my son asked for more - which is unheard of - the recipe really didn't need THAT much.  We had some raw green beans on the side so hopefully that evened out the sugar intake :)

Easy to make; converted recipe to use 1 & 3/4 lb of ground beef (10 servings) While meat, onions and green peppers were browning, I combined other ingredients in a 2 cup glass measuring cup.  I was careful not to over brown the meat and veggies and stirred the sloppy joes frequently during the 30 minutes. My husband said these were the best sloppy joes he ever had in his life! Not too sloppy, not dry, a little sweet and great tasting. We had only enough for leftovers for 1 meal: next time will increase servings so we have more leftovers.

OK, the only thing i did was double the 'sauce' ingredients just in case it was too dry. (yes i used all of the "double" to make it saucy).
Once again, the family rating was SLAMMIN!!!! this is how i know its a keeper. Love this, because i kinda have a problem eating something that has a shelf life of like 2 years. (think of what's in it)

Yum! This is so amazingly good. Didn't change a thing on the original recipe. However, I ran out of ketchup so what I did I only use a little more than 1/2 cup ketchup then I added 1/4 cup A1 sauce. Hhmmm ... delish! Thanks Tamara ;)

Excellent!! Better than my favorite canned brand of sauce for sloppy joes. Hubby and all kids loved it , even the picky eaters.. No more canned sauce for me. I will cut back on the brown sugar a little next time I make this. Thanks for sharing!

Flavor is great! I added a tsp of worcestshire sauce and doubled the mustard (personal preference). Also, I used red bell pepper instead of green, and minced garlic instead of powder. Again these are personal preferences. Mine got a little dry, so I think I'm going to double the sauce and not simmer for so long. Adding a little water helps too!  So easy and yummy! great for a novice cook like myself!!!

Used fresh garlic cloves (always better than powder), added sweet bbq sauce instead of the brown sugar to keep the sweetness while making it more fluid, aka sloppy! Used Dijon mustard instead of normal too!

I've made this Sloppy Joes recipe several times, and every time it has turned out great!! This time, I didn't have any onions or green peppers on hand, so I added in about 1/4 cup chunky salsa to give it texture, and it was nice. (Unfortunately, I accidentally added 3 Tablespoons brown sugar instead of 3 teaspoons. Yikes! It was very sweet and my kids loved it, but...I won't make that mistake again :) Great recipe!

Slightly brown onion, garlic, ground beef, and bell pepper in a pan then in slow cooker for 3-4 hours is a good idea. I reduce brown sugar to about 1 tsp because it is sweet enough for my taste. I also drips some Worcestershire sauce and it seems balance yellow mustard flavor. For heat, I add cayenne pepper or hot sauce.

My husband likes sloppy joes and every time he wanted it I would pick up the can of Manwich and dread the nights dinner. Well no more. This recipe is AWESOME. The only change I made was I added a half cup of water to the mix when it was simmering. The flavors are so good. I am now a sloppy joe fan and this will be a favorite at my house.

Thought it was wonderful and so easy to make!! My son loved it, who is a picky eater. I used tomato sauce and ketchup plus added a packet of Liptons beefy onion soup mix. But turned out Great!! Will use instead of can sloppy Joe mix. Plus used the left overs to make homemade soup! Would definately recommend. =)

I love Sloppy Joes.  A childhood favorite.  I like this recipe and I prepared it exactly as the recipe was written.  The ketchup taste was a little too strong for me.  I prepared it a second time and added two tablespoons of tomato paste and a teaspoon of barbecue sauce to the recipe.  Perfect for me.

This Sloppy Joe recipe is awesome.  I followed the direction exactly with no changes and it is the best sloppy joe I have ever made.  So much better than the canned or powder mixes.  This will be my one and only sloppy joe recipe from now on.  
*Just a note I have made this with splenda in place of the brown sugar and it still turns out great and will cut down on the carbs and calories.

My kids love this. I sub in 1 tsp onion powder for onion because my kids don't like the texture of onions and I omit the bell pepper when they are going to eat because they don't like that either. I add a little more ketchup, about 1 1/4 c total, as well as about 1 tbs of mustard. Just seems to make it a bit smoother. Love this - reminds me of when my mom used to make it, but she used canned and I can't abide the taste of that anymore. Thank you! Now I can have again. :)

I loved this recipe.  I am normally not a fan of sloppy Joe but I was looking for something quick and easy to make for my boys and came across this recipe.  I guarantee I will be making this again.  No more manwich for me.

This recipe balances simply everyday ingredients that are stocked in typical home to make a delicious sloppy joe meal. You could alter this with your favorite spice to put a different spin on a good basic flavor that all are certain to appreciate.  I used this with ground venison as well and it was great. I will make up 30 serving batches and put in boil bags to use at will on busy evenings after work before ruining off to kids practices and events.

Excellent flavor!  We added just a smidge of cayenne pepper to spice it up, but it would taste great even without that addition.

SOOO much better than the stuff in a can/jar!  Made exactly as written - just used red pepper instead of green pepper, cuz that is what I had on hand!  Kids loved it!  This will be the Sloppy Joe recipe from now on!  Thanks for sharing!

I really liked them, my oldest ate them up easily.  My hubby thought, "so so" (but he's a tough critic!), and my middle child said, "I don't really like this".  That all said,  I liked the recipe & will make again,me specially using the freezer idea for individual portions.

Didn't use green pepper, added 2 tsp extra brown sugar, a little water to allow for simmering time and 4 cloves of garlic with the onion and beef. Very good, even picky toddler loved it.

My husband loved this!  I made a change as another reader did, using some BBQ sauce in place of brown sugar.  Also added chopped fresh garlic with the onions and peppers.

So easy and delicious. I have to leave out the onion and green pepper because of people in my family who can't eat them. So I used onion powder and otherwise followed the recipe.

The perfect Sloppy Joe recipe. I never really knew what was in Sloppy Joe's 'till now! We had leftover BBQ'ed London Broil so I chopped it super fine and used it instead of the groud beef. Added a little olive oil to the onions and bell pepper because I did not have the grease from cooking ground beef. Added a little water and simmered for 30 minutes as stated in the recipe. Toasted the Crustini Sandwich Rolls on one side. Hubby LOVED these!

Very good! I followed the recipe exactly (w/o salt, pepper), and it was delicious, though a little too sweet. Next time, I will omit the brown sugar and add part barbecue sauce, as others have done.

I use this recipe whenever I make sloppy joes.  It is very yummy and doesn't last long on the table.  If i don't have brown sugar on hand I have used regular sugar, and I like to use red pepper instead of green because of the sweeter flavor.  Also if you dont have enough ketchup on hand I have substituted BBQ sauce.  Definitely a great recipe to keep!

We like this a lot.  I've made it a couple of times, and have come to the conclusion that it might be just a tad too sweet.  I may play around with it (maybe cut down on the brown sugar) to see if I can keep it tangy, but lose some sweet.

I personally would have liked it a little less sweet, but I am giving it five stars based on the fact that my son that has refused to eat meat his entire 8 years actually declared it to be "pretty good" and ate an entire 1/4 of a sandwich, doubling his beef consumption ever.  Success!  My husband and daughter were also big fans.

Everything I needed I had in my pantry! This is a very easy and tasty recipe. I used a 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup BBQ sauce and it turned out great.

One word: YUMMY!  I'm always buying the premade, just add water and ground beef packets you can get at the store.  The other day I decided I needed to try something different and I'm glad I did!  This is way better than anything premade you could purchase.  I did change a few things though-instead of garlic powder I minced two cloves of garlic.  And the only thing that I actually measured was the 3/4 cup of ketchup.  I'm a pinch of this, dab of that kind of girl.

Loved this...  It was quick/easy and I had all the ingredients in my pantry.  Instead of ground beef I used frozen meatballs and we made meatball subs.

I used a bit more onion, a bit less green pepper, and added about a quarter-cup of Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory and Brown Sugar Barbeque Sauce. So good!

Yummy.  So much better than a package seasoning mix.  I added some McCormacks hamburger seasoning.  I double the recipe using 1 cup ketchup and 1/2 cup bbq sauce. Teenage son loved it on fat slices of sourdough and american cheese

Loved! Best sloppy joe I've had. My husband loved it too. Definitely one to make again and again. I didn't use the green bell pepper since I don't like bells and probably added a teaspoon more of brown sugar. I added barbaque sauce just as an extra.

I'm normally not a big fan of sloppy joes but this one recipe is amazing! I'm so happy I tried it.  I followed the recipe step by step the only modification that I made was I did add 2 teaspoons of bbq sauce. It came out great and it was so simple to make! I'll definitely be making this more often.

My first Sloppy Joes ever and I loved it. I left the Garlic powder out. I can't see why the mustard but I put it in anyway. Also I used Hard Buns instead of a Hamburger Bun.

This is the perfect sloppy joe recipe.  I don't do anything differently and I always get compliments.  Sometimes I make them on Friday night (Junk night) and add a slice of thick bacon to each sandwich!

I made this for American Night at my German university and people went crazy!  I'm a vegetarian and I couldn't help sneaking little "tastes"!  Absolutely delish.  My friends from around the world ask me again and again to make my sloppy joes!

We liked this recipe. I used real garlic and probably less ketchup, not sure since I didn't measure it. Be sure to give it the full simmering time -- that helps the sauce reduce down and helps the texture of the meat. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and 2 yr old son loved this recipe, but my 7 yr old daughter and father in law said it was too sweet. I very much liked it, but added a pinch of cayenne pepper  and some celery salt instead of salt. Next time I will double the green peppers.

I made this exactly as instructed except I did not saute the onions or bell pepper but added them fresh to the sauce. Perhaps this is why I found I had plenty of moisture to simmer the full 30 minutes (because the cooked off moisture from fresh onion and pepper). This is always how I have made it and turns out great.

Awesome recipe and very inexpensive meal for a large crowd.  You can pretty much eyeball the ingredients and it'll turn out great either way.  I added a little bit of tomato sauce and worchestire, but I'm sure it would have been just as good without it!

I liked it. Kid liked it. Husband wasn't crazy about the green pepper flavor. I might omit that next time otherwise will make again! Crowned hamburger and onion then put in crockpot with other ingredients. Cooked on high for an hour or so until dinner.

Delicious! Used ground turkey instead of beef. Also added 1 tsp worcestershire sauce and 1 tbsp vinegar, as others suggested. Also added about 1/4 cup water as it simmered, so that it wouldn't dry out. I was able to get 3 sandwiches out of this recipe. Will definitely make again.

I just made these tonight and they were delicious.  I've never been a fan of the popular, canned Sloppy Joe mix as it is too sweet for me.  However, this recipe has great flavor with just a little sweetness.  I used ground turkey instead of beef since I know I'll be having a lot of red meat this Memorial weekend, but followed the remaining ingredients exactly.  This one is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!!

This is an excellent Sloppy Joe recipe. I didn't change anything. It is a bit sweet, but I like that. It's definitely a nice change from the overly salted and preserved canned stuff.

This was good for a quick dinner.  A little lacking in flavor and depth - needs worcestershire at least.

These were CLASSIC sloppy joes--simple yet delicious taste.  I recommend using potato rolls to compliment the subtle sweetness from the brown sugar.  I will definitely make these again--many, many times!

More like 4.5 stars as written. Will make without green bell pepper next time - then it will be perfect (just like mom used to make)

This was great! I didn't have green peppers so I just used 2 tablespoons of Salsa.  It's great to have easy recipes when you have a newborn!

A perfect recipe for a quick and easy dinner, almost time consuming for just "sloppy joes" but trust me it's worth it, way better than the can stuff. 2nd time making it this month and this time it was requested by my 7th old! Made recipe as listed, just added more ketchup and brown sugar so the filling would ooze out the bun! Lol yummy

Used to buy Manwich. I loved it as a kid, but now I just think it tastes yuck and my kids won't even eat it. Wanted a sloppy joe recipe that was quick and easy, a little sweet, but not unbearably sweet! This was AWESOME! I make it once every 2 weeks. Quick and easy, especially on a day when we have soccer practices! THANK YOU!

I LOVED this.  Very forgiving recipe. Also threw in some diced carrots and celery to stretch it and amp up the health factor.  WAY better than the canned stuff!!  Held together on the bun better too so more is in my mouth than on my shirt.  Followed another's advice and froze the leftovers in a muffin tin, popped them out, and individually wrapped them for a fast lunch.  Only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 is that my toddler wouldn't eat it, and he loves meat.  Probably too flavorful for his young palatte.

My family liked this recipe. I think I put in a little too much green pepper, so next time I will put in a little less.  The sauce was very sweet, even after I added a splash of liquid smoke, and 1 tsp of Worchestershire sauce.  I also added about a 1/4 cup of water while it simmered. But overall, a hit!

i made this for lunch 2/26/11 this was good i didn't have brown sugar so i used regular sugar and 3 tsp of white sugar. i used garlic salt instead of salt and added a bit of garlic powder and onion powder cause it needed a lil more seasoning. it does have a strong mustard flavor i found myself using a lil extra sugar to calm the tang since i like it a bit more sweet and less tangy.

These are good. Most of my family doesn't like green pepper, so we omit it -- and to make it healthy, we double the ingredients other than ground beef, and we add an amount of cooked (from dried) beans to "healthy it up."

I will never ever buy canned manwich again. This stuff is awesome- and so easy. Definately even better on second day leftovers- after the flavors had longer to sit.
-UPDATE-have made these 2 more times since the first time I made them, and felt I had to write another review because these are so amazing, and a true comfort food. I used spicy dijon mustard, and doubled the sauce, and trippled the amount of onions, and it was just great. Everyone raved about them! =)

I liked the recipe but I made a few changes and will make some more changes the next time I make it. I used real garlic and garlic powder and I added chili powder. However, I did find that this recipe was a little sweet so next time I'm going to cut back on the sugar and add a little more garlic and mustard.

This was delicious! The only things I did differently is double the recipe for more people and I added about a 1/4 cup water because it seemed a little dry. Otherwise it was perfect. I will never buy sloppy joe mix again.

A little too sweet for me, but I did like the addition of the bell peppers--especially because my 4 year old didn't notice she was eating vegetables. Good amount of sauce vs. meat. We made it with ground turkey since we don't eat much beef.

This is the best sloppy joes recipe in the world.  When I saw it I was taken back to my grade school days and my favorite school lunch.  I followed the recipe for the most part but made it my own by adding 1/4 cup small diced carrot with the onion, pepper and beef.  After draining I added 1/4 cup mild Rotel, 1/8 cup sweet chipotle bbq sauce and 1 tsp. liquid smoke to the other ingredients and used less ketchup.  The result was a robust, delicious sloppy that made my mouth sing.  Thanks for posting Tamara.

i read all the reviews and how wonderful this recipe was.  i hadn't had sloppy joes since high school so i thought i'd give it a try.  i just threw out the entire pan of sloppy joes.  so, so sweet.  all you tastes is the sweetness and nothing else. i figured it must be me since everybody else loved it.  i have made a lot of recipes from this site and enjoyed them very much, but not this one.  i won't be making this again.

I agree with other raters that a few dashes of Worchestershire sauce gives this recipe more depth.  We also like to add 1/4 cup chili sauce.

This was absolutely amazing and I will never spend a dollar on manwich again.. 
I did change the main ingredient though, instead of using hamburger I used ground up sausage which added more flavor. 
I also added a bit of red pepper with the green pepper. My suggestion If you have a good non stick frying pan, it is best to let it simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. I will definately be making this again 5 star and more :)

I've been making this sloppy joe since I learned how at the fire house. It is great. Since we are campers, I make a lot of it, then a couple of days later add some tomato sauce and spices to turn it into spaghetti sauce !  You get another meal out of it.

This IS good but I didn't need a recipe for this as this is the exact way we have been making Sloppy Joes in our house for years! the only difference is adding cut up garlic...it's healthier that way too.

Much better than the canned stuff. I do add about a teaspoon or two of Chili Powder and a teaspoon of cumin to give it some more kick. But this is great.

This recipe is almost the one I've been making for over 30 years, just like my Mom's.  I omit the mustard, and add some dill pickle juice, garlic - powder or crushed, and a few dashes of red pepper flakes to give it a little bite.  Now it's five star:)))

I have made this recipe at least a half dozen times and love it. It is my go to Sloppy Joe. Everyone in my family loves it. It is easy and quick. The only change I make to it is I double it but add 1lb of ground turkey instead of another lb. of ground beef. No one is the wiser and it is just as delicious. Thank you, Tamara!

Didn't have green pepper, but still delicious!  Quicker and less messy than making burgers on the indoor grill.

This was delicious!! I added just a bit of tomato soup to get it a little "sloppier" I also added a few more jalepenos and onions for an extra bite.

Kellen liked it.  I thought it was a bit too sweet.  Next time, use 1 T of brown sugar and 1/2 cup salsa and 1/4 cup ketchup instead of the  3/4 cup.

So good, so easy and so economical!  I added a couple of splashes of Worcestershire sauce, which was tasty.  I love that I have almost all of these ingredients in my pantry/fridge on a regular basis.  Thanks and YUM!

My daughter who is a picky eater ate three whole sandwiches the first time I made this. I used someone's suggestion to substitute 1/2 of ketchup with bbq sauce and I added a little water and more ketchup and bbq sauce to create more sauce (which was someone else's suggestion as well).

I was expecting more because the ratings were so high for this recipe. A little too sweet for my taste, couldn't even finish 1/2 a sandwich. My boyfriend had 2 helpings though. If I ever make this again it would be with much less sugar and more ketchup (??)--there was barely enough sauce, especially after it cooked down.

Quick and delicious.  I followed the idea from one of the reviews and used 1/4 cup bbq sauce and 1/2 cup ketchup.  This was a hit.

Wow...puts the canned stuff to shame! A sloppy joe is a easy to make meal but this recipe is AWESOME. I am not a fan of green peppers so I omitted them. Unlike the canned stuff the green pepper taste is overwhelming so with this I can add more onions/green peppers or skip them. This one is a hit!! Yummmmo

Good.  Very similar to the one I make, but I never measure a single ingredient (just eyeball it).  Now I have the correct porportions.  Next time I will leave out the mustard, just my preference.

I would give this a 4 on taste, but since I can literally look at the ingredients and then memorize how to cook these from now on... (It is really that easy!) I'm giving it a 5.  I added red pepper and onion a little more brown sugar and some Worcestershire sauce.  They came out really good.  Just as easy as throwing a can of Manwich together, but they tasted way better, and I knew exactly what I put in them.   Thanks for a super easy, good recipe!

Thought I had a can, but didn't and it was 5:30.  Found this recipe.  It is simple and good!  Plus, didn't have a lot of ingredients.  I used frozen, chopped green pepper and substituted Agave for the brown sugar. Yummy!  This is  go to recipe for Sloppy Joes.  Thanks for posting!

Really great base to get started on making homemade sloppy joes that allow me to control the ingredients and improve the nutritional value for my family. I've found that the boys don't seem to notice when I add  1/2 bag of fajita blend frozen veggies (onions and mixed bell peppers), which really ups the veggie serving without causing a dinnertime crisis. Also found that using about 1/2 cup of chili sauce to replace some of the ketchup gives this recipe a richer flavor. Many thanks for the idea to add a touch of vinegar; we use apple cider to keep a little hint of sweetness.

Delicious sloppy joe recipe.  This is your basic old-school sloppy joe, which is exactly what I was looking for.  I did substitute 1/3 of the ketchup with barbeque sauce, which I might skip next time, I'm not sure any changes need to be made to this recipe! I served on King's Hawaiian dinner rolls as sliders, since I didn't have any hamburger buns.

OMG I cannot believe how good these were. I was so surprised that something could actually work and taste so much better then the canned stuff. I too reduced sugar to 2 tsp but still too sweet. I added some onion powder and some worches sauce. Excellent will NEVER use that canned stuff again!!!

A touch too sweet for our taste and I added only 1 tsp of sugar! Ketchup is already loaded with sugar. Also found it needed some kick, just a personal taste thing so added some heat. Added chili type seasonings and beans to try and counter the sweetness with some success but now I have a sweet chili instead of sloppy joes. Oh well.

This is really good and can be made from what I normally keep around the house. I added some worcestershire sauce, spicy mustard (in addition to the regular mustard), and a bit of chili powder. I didn't have green pepper so doubled the onion. The pepper would have been better, but it was still fabulous. Thanks for this simple, tasty recipe.

Love the recipe as listed and have on occasion used some of the suggestions...either way this is a fantastic recipe.  More than once I've browned the hamburger and tossed it into a crock pot when serving family gatherings or on those "grazing" occasions like tail gating or Christmas.

This is simple and uses ingredients I always have on hand.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added a couple teaspoons of water before I simmered it- perfect! I always picture Chris Farley dancing in his lunch lady outfit as I eat my sloppy joes, slop, sloppy joes....

Very good! I used ground venison instead of the beef and added a small palm-full of real bacon bits (for fat). Maybe a little too sweet for my taste, but my husband liked it!

We normally don't like sloppy joes but I made this for friends who got together to help us put a swing set together.  Everyone like it a lot including my hubby who doesn't like sloppy joes too much because it's too sweet.  I made it with organic ketchup which has less sugar than the normal ketchup.  If I were to make this with normal ketchup, I would reduce the amount of brown sugar even more so it's not so sweet.  Also, I used very good quality garlic powder (makes a huge difference).  A keeper!

FANTASTIC!!!!!!! This recipe is simple. The ingredients are inexpensive & easy to come by. I used 2 parts ketchup to 1 part bbq sauce as suggested in other reviews. Also, mine simmered for an 1.5 hour because my husband was late getting home from work. WOW. The aroma that filled the house was mouth watering. Thank you for the your wonderful recipe.

Very nice recipe! I made it yesterday for my team at work, they all loved it (recipe x3).  The only things I did differently was to add half a can of tomato sauce (there wasn't enough moisture, I think I may have had a touch too much ground beef) and a generous amount of Worcestershire sauce.  A definite save-and-print.

Very good recipe! Far better than what you get out of a can from the grocery store. Hubby and I thought it was a little too sweet, so I have some adjustments to make. Other than that this was incredibly easy and tasty.

I used 1/2 of ketchup and 1/4 cup of bbq sauce as another reviewer suggested. Plus i didn't have enough ketchup anyway. I did add in about a cup of cooked lentils that i needed to use up. I left out the brown sugar because of the bbq sauce and i didn't use garlic powder since my bf is really picky about garlic. It turned out pretty good. Even my kids who never eats sloppy joes actually tried it.

I used 8ozs lean ground turkey and an orange pepper.  Everything else as written.  These are the best sloppy joes and are so easy to make.  Why would anyone buy that stuff in the can?

I agree with the other reviewers that said that it is too sweet and too dry.  With the ketchup and the brown sugar it was overkill on sugar for my taste.  You can definitely taste the ketchup in there. I love ketchup but I felt it was overpowering.  As for the dry, there was barely enough sauce to cover all the meat.  We prefer it more "sloppy," I guess you can say.  I think I'm going to look for another recipe for sloppy joes.  Maybe one with a tomato sauce base instead of ketchup will better suit our tastes.

These were very good.  We made them with half ketchup and half BBQ sauce as another member suggested.  I will certainly be using this quick and easy recipe again.

5 stars not because it is gourmet but because it is so easy, good, and the kids love it. This was my fall back when I didn't have ingredients for a more complicated sloppy joe (there's an oxymoron for you!). Why use any other recipe?!

This is the best sloppy joe recipe i have ever tried is a keeper for sure family and friends loved them the only thing i added to the recipe was one jalapeno pepper to make it a little spicer.                                          Thanks For Sharing.                                                Tamara.

I love sloppy joes, and this is probably one of the best ways to make them!  The whole family ate them up.  This recipe is good by itself, but for my taste, I did add a stalk of celery and used a red bell pepper instead of green.  I also subbed fresh garlic for the powder.  When I was doing the sauce I added a large splash of beef broth, but only because I used ground chicken instead of beef.

This recipe was fantastic. I followed previous suggestions and did half ketchup and half hickory barbeque sauce. I also added a splash of vinegar and a splash of Worcester sauce. Perfect!

Amazing recipe for a short prep, easy meal.  Made it the first time following the recipe exactly, the second time we added some diced jalapenos for a little extra kick.  This one's a keeper!

5 stars because it is the simplest thing to feed your family when short of time. It tastes great too. I just used a few spoonfuls of ketchup as my daughter doesn't like it and the results were good nonetheless

Easy and Yummy! TIP: I buy the peppers (green and more typically expensive red/orange/yellow if bought separately) off of the local grocery store's salad bar. They are already sliced and ready to be chopped.

Yep. That's how you make homemade sloppy joes. I don't put the sugar in mine, but that's just my preference. It definitely beats Manwich and it's cheaper!

Made exactly as written tonight for dinner and it was thoroughly enjoyed.    Will double the recipe in the future...cut down on the sugar...add Worcestershire sauce.  Serve 1/2 as sloppy joes.  The rest will be frozen and converted into stuffed peppers later in the week by adding uncooked rice, water, and a partial can of tomatoes.  Thanks for sharing.

Great base recipe that you can leave as is or change it with one or more ingredients to suit your personal preference.  It is easily doubled or tripled to feed a large crowd.  It also can be made ahead of time and it freezes well.  Next time I make it I will substitute BBQ sauce for some of the Ketchup.

These were Yummy and kid approved! My kids kept raving over them. I added 1/4 c  of BBQ sauce as suggested by others, 1 T Worcestershire, 1 t garlic powder, and I also added a little  water because mine were a little too thick. I did not add the brown sugar, they were sweet enough with all the ketchup and BBQ. I made them in the morning before work, and my dh just had to reheat. A little cole slaw & frozen fries and dinner was ready in no time! This will be my Sloppy Joe go to recipe!

This recipe was really good. My entire family enjoyed it and so did I. I will make this recipe again and again. I can imagine that this would also be good using half bbq sauce for those that think it may be to sweet.

Great basic sloppy joes recipe!  I didn't follow the recipe exactly [didn't bother measuring the weight of the beef used]  I replaced some of the ketchup with barbecue sauce, plus added some Worcestershire sauce.  I'm really glade that I found this recipe :D

This is really good!  I used ground turkey and added some worcestershire sauce.  I didn't think it needed salt...also, I found it wasn't really necessary to simmer the mixture for 30 minutes.

Love, love, love this recipe. The second time I made it, I didn't have green bell pepper, so I left it out. It was still delicious. I'll never use another recipe for Sloppy Joes! I do have to add about 1/4 C water when simmering for the 30 min so it doesn't stick to the pan. Besides that, it's flawless!

After rejecting sloppy Joes for ten years having convinced myself that they were absolutely disgusting, I decided to try my hand at homemade ones rather than the canned Manwich...and man, am I glad I did!!! This is quite possibly my new favorite dish. I topped with a slice of American cheese and served with some homemade oven baked potato wedges, and it was one of the best meals I have had in a long time! I can't wait to have the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!!

I added a little extra ketchup and used ground turkey and it was perfect.  I think the simmer time is too long, but that's just me.

This was a great recipe. The first time I made it I added too much worcester sauce, so it tasted a little funky.  The  second time I used just a dash. One time I made this,  I adjusted it to 36 servings to feed an entire high school basketball team!  The adjustment tool is great.  I substituted a good portion of the ketchup with tomato soup. It got great reviews!

Best sloppy joes we've ever eaten (only ones we've ever made from scratch).  For ultimate perfection, I added: 2 tsp vinegar 2 tsp Worcestershire 1 sm can tomato paste 2 extra tsp brown sugar 1/2-1 C water

Great recipe! Even after simmering for 20 mins, not 30 like the recipe asks for, the Sloppy Joe mix tasted moist and flavorable.

my husband & I love this recipe.  I like to exchange the ketchup for tomato paste as well & add beer to make a bit more sauce & a deeper flavor, though water works just as well if little ones are involved. Very tasty!

i do declare that this is the best darn sloppy joe i had since my mama made in some in Savannah.  howevah, i do declare that the use of tomato sauce instead of ketchup is mighty fine. my ornery boyfriend really settled down when he had a bite of this meat goodness.

Thank you so much for this recipe!  My husband now refuses to eat the stuff froma can.  I used a colored pepper instead of the green one because we find that green peppers can turn an entire dish bitter.  Other than that, it's perfect the way it is.

Very good. Kids loved it. I used 1 small red pepper and 1 small purple pepper from the local farmers market. I doubled the sauce as our family likes our sloppy. All my kids; ages 4 and 2 and 9 months liked this meal. I served w/crisp wedges and peas. Easy weekday meal!

We love this sloppy joes recipe.  Since I found it, I haven't used any other recipe much less the stuff from the can!  It's got the perfect combinations of flavor for us!  I don't ever change a thing about the recipe.  Thank you so much for sharing this all-time classic!

Yummy! I used 2 pounds of ground beef, 1 cup of ketchup and 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce. Perfect sweetness. I used about 2 teaspoons of mustard for extra tang and to offset the sweetness of the BBQ sauce.  I was rushing so didn't use enough onions or bell peppers, next time I will use more. Make sure you remember to cook the onions and bell peppers with the meat, makes the kitchen smell wonderful.

Love this recipe! I made this for a party with 55 adults and 30 kids. Per other reviews I used 1/2 c ketchup and 1/4 c BBQ sauce. I also added a clove of garlic in place of the garlic powder. They were a big hit.

I don't know why everyone is so crazy about this recipe.  First major problem, even without draining the browning liquids, there still wasn't anywhere near enough liquid to "simmer" for 30 minutes.  This was all Joe and no sloppy.  The other major problem is the flavor.  Even leaving out the sugar, it was very sweet and ketchupy.  It tasted like what it basically is, ketchup dumped on browned ground beef.  Not very good.

This turned out pretty good -- better than the last recipie that I tried and closer to that "perfect" recipie that we all strive for. I added about 1/4 c barbecue sauce to a 2x recipie and we all thought that it added a subtle enhancement to the flavor of the sloppy joes. The wife and kids loved this recipie although I'm searching for something with a little more kick to it. This recipie is good enough to serve as a base for future recipie attempts.

YUM!  These were very good.  It definitely needs more sauce though.  It was very dry so I tripled the amount of sauce and it was so much better.

I had planned to make sloppy joes tonight, and after browning my ground beef, realized that I had NO sloppy joe seasoning packets in my pantry - which brought me here.  I tried this recipe tonight, and after tasting it, I swear I will NEVER buy the seasoning packets again.   This is soooo easy and totally DELISH!

This recipe was very good. Before when I would make sloppy joes it always tasted like something was missing. This tastes like its all there....

This was a very good basic recipe.  We didn't have green peppers so I used carrots instead.  It was very tasty.  My kids live on hot sauce, so both felt the need to spice it up, and then they devoured it.

Great recipe especially in terms of ease and overall taste. You can't go wrong with this one. Even my 4-yr old twins ate it!

VERY tasty, I did the same as a few others and only did 1/2 cup of ketchup and the other 1/4 cup bbq sauce. YUMMY!!!  Be advised, however, keep a close eye while it simmers...the full 30 min for me burned it :( Still edible but yeah...I should've just taken it off as soon as the sauces mixed and warmed a bit..about 5 min. Will make again though!!

Really like the recipe but there isn't enough sauce for our liking.  Will have to double next time.    Edited to add- I used 1 1/2 pounds ground beef and doubled all the other ingredients. I absolutely love it this way! Awesome flavor and plenty of sauce this way.

This was not to our taste. If you like hot ketchup- you'll love this. Hardly any sauce ('slop') and sickeningly sweet. I would never make this again- we tried to salvage it, but couldn't.

This turns out fabulous every time I make it! Always a hit with my husband and 3 year old!  It's become a staple in our house.  I double the recipe, make it ahead and freeze it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I've never been a fan of sloppy joes, but my family begged me to make some after watching a kids camp movie lol. I've only tried the canned version before, which I thought had a bad after taste, so I came here & found this one! Yummy! I used ground lean turkey breasts instead of beef, but kept all other ingredients the same. It's so good I'll consider adding this to the monthly rotation!

I will NEVER use canned crud again!!!  I've made this twice now.. once exactly as written w/ground beef, and it was  huge huge hit! my picky 5yr old raved.. and ate an entire sandwhich! that's HUGE for her!!    the second time I made it, I used the sauce recipe as is(except doubled the recipe), and put it over shredded cooked turkey breast meat that I had leftover. Put the sauce, the turkey meat and some diced onions in a crock pot, mixed it all up well, and set to low until it just started to bubble.  Turned it to warm until I was ready to serve.  Again.. a huge huge hit!!!    This will be put into regular rotation in my house now.. be it w/ground beef as tradtional sloppy joes, or shredded beef, pork, chicken or turkey as a sort of pulled meat bbq sandwhich.  YUM!!

Very good, when I initially made it I was a bit concerned because it wasn't as red as the picture shows.  I didn't find a ton of the typical sloppy joe flavor in it as is, so I added about a 1/2 can of tomato paste and it turned out very good.  My husband enjoyed them a lot and took the left overs for lunch!  Update: I remade them and this time instead added extra ketchup and a little BBQ sauce - even better!

We thought this was a really great recipe. I only had spicy brown mustard, so I used a little more brown sugar to even out the acidity. Served on homemade french rolls. This was so easy and delicious, I'm never going back to the seasoning packet again!

This was great.  I took others suggestions and used 1/4 ketchup and added 1/2 cup of bbq sauce.  I used the honey bbq sauce instead and nixed the brown sugar since it was already sweet from the bbq.  It was fantastic.  My boyfriend said they're the best he has ever had.

What a great recipe!  I had been craving sloppy joes for a while, but couldn't make myself eat the stuff from a can.  Thank you for such a delicious, easy recipe.  This is one of the few times I didn't alter anything. They're perfect as is.

I added a half cup of matchstick carrots and a couple cloves minced garlic. I didn't try it, but my husband and kids did. The kids tolerated it, my husband thought it was okay. I did end up spooning some into hoagie buns and topping it with cheese and sticking it under the broiler. My husband ate four, but he works hard all day. I don't understand why my kids are the only kids who won't eat Sloppy Joes!

OMG!  Sloppy Joe's are my favorite dish in the world and I've tried every recipe out there and this is BY FAR the best I've ever had!  I did use 1/4 cup Sweet baby Rays and 1/2 cup ketchup.  I also doubled the sauce for 1lb ground beef and consistency was PERFECT!  Please buy a good quality bun for this recipe though.  Honey buns are great!  I did follow another reviewers advice and I used a hoagie bun and topped with white american cheese and broiled in oven for 5 min on low.  Great tip!  My family RAVED and raved about this!   Thanks so much!  I will only use this recipe from now on!

I used a small can of tomato sauce and tomato paste with a couple of dashes of worchestershire, a sprinkling of garlic powder and onion powder, and about a teaspoon of sugar in place of the ketchup just because it sounded more appealing. Also used lots of dijon mustard instead of just regular yellow. It was yummy!

This is a great, simple healthy version of the canned stuff.  My 18mo, was licking his plate...really.  You can also use this as a base and really take offf with it, BBQ/Thai/Veggie packed Sloppy Joes.  For those with picky babies who won't touch peppers, throw it in a Food processor...it will get kinda mushy, but they won't even notice is there...also pureed spinach and/or carrots also hides in there well....Great recipe anyway you make it.

This was a great the way I made it.  I would have given it 5 stars had I followed it exactly, but I made a few changes.  1st, I used about 1/4 catsup (who runs out of catsup, me that's who) and 1/2 cup chili sauce.  That was really good.  2nd, I didn't have green pepper so I omitted it.  My family loved it and we will make it again for sure.

This is a very good Sloppy Joe! We like the idea of decreasing the ketchup, eliminating the brown sugar, and adding barbeque sauce. I also add about 2 tablespoons chopped jalepeno! Yummy!:-)

To cut down on the ketchup-y taste, I added 1-2 tsp of Worchestershire, extra garlic powder and season salt. Good recipe!

This was a good recipe, but a little on the dry side for me- I had to nearly double to sauce to get a traditional “sloppy” texture.  The flavors are excellent and the taste is very much that of a classic sloppy joe.  I would only suggest doubling the sauce- other than that I wouldn’t change a thing.

NO NEED TO MODIFY.  Just double sauce, that is my only recommendation.  I hate it, when someone gives a recipe 5 stars and then modifies/changes everything, thus making it a different recipe.  This is great as is.  I followed the recipe exactly and just doubled the sauce as other reviewers had recommended and it turned out fantastic. SIMPLE! SIMPLE! SIMPLE!

I just started volunteering at a recovery home for alcohlics and addicts, making them dinner a couple times a month. I'm in college, so I have a tight budget. I needed something that wasn't too expensive, but would feed a lot of hungry men... I tell ya, this was a hit! I was so worried about everything turning out okay, and I was MORE than pleased with this recipe. I tripled the recipe and used ground turkey instead of ground beef because it's cheaper and has less fat and calories and tastes about the same as ground beef. I think I let it simmer a little too long because they weren't as juicy as I'd hoped, but they were still awesome sloppy joes! I'll definitely remember this one for big parties! Kudos to the creator!

Good recipe, but just a bit too sweet and sour for our taste. I will stick to using tomato paste instead of ketchup and no mustard or sugar. I usually make sloppy joes without a recipe, using what I have on had, usually healthier ingredients and so far, I am so sorry to say they taste better than following a recipe :S. It was not bad at all, just not great. Thanks for sharing though!

Awesome! I put real garlic, instead of garlic powder, because I didn't have any. And I didn't put sugar in, ketchup has a lot of sugar.

This recipe is wonderful! It tastes just as good, if not better, than Manwich and is cheaper to make. I don't always have the store bought on hand, but always have these ingredients! I used ground turkey and followed the recipe exactly. I covered it while "simmering", allthough I don't believe simmering is the word I would use. There isn't enough liquid for that...perfect though. We thought it had a similar sweetness to Manwich and I wouldn't change a thing! Thanks for the great recipe!! :)

I only gave this 3 stars because it did require some "doctoring".  I browned the beef with 1/2 chopped onion and one minced garlic.  Then added the rest of the ingredients as listed, ecept using only 1 tsp brown sugar.  I had to increase the ketchup to about 1 cup, increase the mustard by about another tsp. and add some water.  The flavor still wasn't quite right so I added 1/2 tsp Italian seasoning, 1 tbl barbeque sauce and some hot pepper flakes.  It ended up being pretty tasty - my husband couldn't tell that it wasn't the canned stuff ( I don't know if that's good or bad!)

I made this recipe exactly as listed.  My family tried one bite and refused to have any more.  I think if the mustard was left out it may be a little easier to ingest.

Great, easy to make recipe!  I had all ingredients on hand.  Kids loved.  Only change I made was to omit the green peppers as my family is not fond of them.  Doubled the recipe and now have another dinner as well!  Thanks!

We found this to be a little bland.  Will "spice it up" next time.  People: don't buy prepared sloppy joes sauces; it's sooo easy to make your own and a lot cheaper, too.

Simple, tasty and went over very well with the boyfriend and me.  Next time I'll be tweaking it a bit but you can definitely count on me to be making this again in the near future.  It's weird how this recipe was sent to my e-mail because twice this past month I have been mentioning wanting to make some sloppy joe's without having to resort to buying it in a can.  Thanks for sharing.

This is so similar to the recipe my mom always used and gave to me many, many years ago.In Pennsylvania we call it Bar-B-Q. People in other parts of the country are always confused when I say this is Bar-B-Q. I don't measure my ingredients but use the taste test. I always make it a bit on the sweet side and everyone loves it. I use white sugar only. I am celiac...on a gluten free diet and this is perfect because Manwich is not on the acceptable list for me. This is 100 X better than Manwich. It's worth the extra time. I use the crock pot, too, after I brown the hamburger. In fact, next wk/end we are having a wine tasting party and when a friend heard I was having Sloppy Joe's she said they would come because of that as they are THE BEST! Try it with white sugar, and make it a bit sweet. Great with homemade coleslaw!!!!!

This has become a regular on our meal roster since I found it here. I can almost make it without reading the recipe. It's great and can be cooked ahead and easily reheated on those days when we are working and want something ready as soon as we come in the door.

Try it on a variety of breads and buns to make it different every time. Tonight I am serving it on split onion buns.

This is so close to the recipe we have used for 4 generations.  We also add 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce and 1/4 to 1/2 cup of pickle relish. I frequently use molasses instead of brown sugar, but the original recipe has the brown sugar. This came from a recipe my Great-Grandmother cut out of the Chicago Tribune food section in the early 50's!

This is a very good recipe that my family loved.  Instead of ketchup, I used a can of zesty tomato sauce, and 2 T. cider vinegar.  Very yummy.

Very very good! Perfect consistency. A little warning to everyone else though: the recommended amount of beef really does feed 6 people! I added in 2lbs because I was thinking that the original couldnt possibly feed 6 people...yeah, I was wrong! I had like half left over!

Wow! Great sloppy joes and they smell so good while cooking. I always use my mom's recipe but this one is just as good and different from any sloppy joe I've tried.

I never liked sloppy joes growing up so I was hesitant to make this, but am glad I did! I've been making this recipe for almost 2 years, and it'll be the only one I use. I add about 1/4 cup BBQ sauce, and a little water for more sauce.  If I need to get rid of celery, I add it, but not too much otherwise it's overpowering.  I'll also add whatever kind of bell pepper I have on hand--doesn't have to be green. I usually double the recipe then freeze ice cream scoop piles on parchment paper, and after frozen store in a plastic bag.  This works great for quick meals.  Simply take a couple balls out, put in a bowl, and heat in the microwave.

I used ground turkey thigh instead of the beef; used half BBQ sauce and and half ketchup...no brown sugar.  It had a nice tangy kick to it.  Also added ome diced celery stalk as I had it on hand.  Next time I'd add a bit of water as this was a bit dry but otherwise a keeper!  Used all organic/natural ingredients and used whole wheat buns.  Healthy AND tasty!

This is the second time I have made this and it is excellent.  This time I doubled the recipe so I could seal and freeze the rest with the food saver. Just added extra green peppers and took other reviewers suggestions and divided ketchup with 1/2 BBQ sauce and didn't need any brown sugar. This recipe, along with so many others from this site is VERY GOOD.
Best recipe site I have ever come across. 
Thanks.

These were really good. I made some changes though. I used ground turkey so I added some worcestershire sauce and hamburger spice also when I went to get my ketchup I realized it was almost gone so I used 2 small cans of tomato sauce (for 3 pounds of meat) added some tonys and cayenne and they were great. And my kids loved them said it was better than the canned stuff. I agree. Thanks for the recipe!

Mmmm. This recipe converted me to a Sloppy Joe lover. The recipe is great as is but sometimes I like to spice it up by adding minced garlic, bbq sauce (and omit brown sugar) and Franks Hot Sauce. To make it sloppier, instead of adding water, I add pickle juice. YUM!

I found this recipe a few years ago, but have been wanting to say how good it is!  Tastes just like the sloppy joes we had when I was growing up in the '60s.  Yumm!  I was beginning to think that I'd lost my taste for sloppy joes until I tried this recipe.

The only addition I make is adding a few shots of Worchestershire sauce.  If it gets dry while simmering, I just add more ketchup.

Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

This is a good recipe. I did nothing to change it up, other than a slice of cheese! There is another recipe I usually use for Sloppy Joes but it is very time consuming. This one is easy and quick (other than the simmer time which is perfect for getting the side dishes ready). Thank you for sharing. I will probably make this one again but I am not sure what, if any changes I will make.

Loved this recipe! I omitted the green bell pepper and substituted 1/2 cup minced celery.  Used the food processor to mince the onion and celery and minced 1 piece fresh garlic also thus omitting the garlic powder. I added the minced mixture to the beef just before the beef completely browned.  Once beef was browned then I added the other ingredients.  I use to use a powdered mix and will never again.  This recipe is great!

This recipe was quick and easy.  My friends loved it.  I doctored up the ketchup and substituted with some Hienz 57 and Open Pit BBQ sauce.  To kick it up a notch I also added some hot sauce.  I can't wait to make these again for my friends.

These are very good.  Much better than the store bought sauce.  Was a bit sweet.  Might try and cut down on the brown sugar.

Although the end result was FANTASTIC, I am not giving the recipe the highest rating because I had to make some adjustments to it.  I added about a half a cup of beef bullion during the simmering.  A Sloppy Joe should be sloppy!  I also used 2 chopped cloves of garlic instead of garlic powder, and red bell pepper instead of green.  I left out the brown sugar.  My husband devoured this and wanted to know when I could make it again!  I really loved it too.  GREAT flavor.

I'm eating this right now at my desk, and it tastes even better after a day or too.  Very easy to make, I ommited the onions and peppers because I don't care for them.  The dish is somewhat sweet due to the brown sugar, but guests at a halloween party recently loved this dish.

Best Sloppy Joe recipe I've found.  I took a tip from "Manwich" and added chili powder and oregano to cut the sweetness - I think it works better than vinegar, plus the flavor it imparts is more authentic.  I also added a bit more mustard powder and a dash of Worcestershire sauce.  I think next time I might add a little tomato paste and water to make more sauce and a small clove of fresh grated garlic.

Easily the best and most simple SJ recipe ever!  Doubled the recipe and tweeked it a bit for our taste (no grn. pep. substitute a little bbq for some of the ketchup a little less brown sugar a little more mustard). Great on fresh bakery rolls with some fruit on the side...

I live in Australia, where most people have never heard of sloppy joes except for when we see them on movies (Billy Madison for my family!) - My brothers have been bugging me to make these since they saw that movie years ago. I never thought i could sit through a meal with what looked like soggy mince with ketchup and a bread roll. I was so wrong! I finally gave in and instead of me making them, i got my 15 year old brother to experiment while i was on my way home. I have never seen something gobbled up so quickly... not ever! They were really yummy and sweet, which from the reviews is what they are supposed to be like, and he made it exactly as the recipe states. Thanks for the great recipe that we will use again and again. (The only thing i would change is maybe not use the green pepper - we diced it up in the mixmaster and all night all i could smell was green pepper! - so maybe use 2 sweet onions instead)

Good basic recipe. A little too sweet.  I added a tablespoon of vinegar and a teaspoon of ceyenne pepper and it had just the right amount of kick without beeing hot and overly spicey.

Great recipe. I added almost 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce, which was too much. Just a few tablespoons would probably be just right.

Wonderful recipe.  I was unsure when I was done making it but it is wonderful.  I followed the advice of mixing ketchup and bbq sauce.  and that definitely gave it a kick.  It was a hit at pot luck for work and I'll be making this for a meal for the family.  Great recipe.

Okay, this rocked! First time I've ever made homemade joe's and I won't use canned ever again. I did use 1.5 lbs. ground beef, did 3/4 cup bbq sauce and 3/4 cup ketchup. Added 2 tsp. of cider vinegar, and some chili powder. I used dry onion flakes and garlic powder (I don't like chunks in my joes). Chopped up a bit of green pepper very small. Did not add mustard. After simmering for 30 minutes in the skillet, I put it in the crockpot on low/keep warm for a few hours. YUM! Hubby loved it too! Thanks!

This tastes just like the recipe served in my  high school. The only difference ia I add 2-3 tablespoons of vinegar.  It adds a little pop to the recipe.

5 stars with some changes. I didn't add green peppers only because no one in my family likes them. I added 1/2 cup of ketchup and about a half cup bbq sauce(sweet & zesty), went ahead with the 3 tsp of brown sugar but ended up adding about 3tbsp more, 1 whole (med) onion & a dash of worchestire sauce. Turned out great. We like ours sweet. My hubby doesn't even like sloppy joes but he enjoyed these.

Much better than Manwich! Followed reviews and used 1/2 cup ketchup & 1/4 cup BBQ sauce.  Also added some Worcestershire sauce.  It is important to let the Joes simmer so that the flavors blend.  Next time I make them I will follow a review that used ketchup & chili sauce.  I think the chili sauce will add a nice kick.  I suggest doubling this recipe if serving 3 or more.  I don't see any possible way that this recipe could make 6 servings.  Overall, a good recipe & I will make again.

I followed the recipe exactly as stated except I doubled it and it was gone that night. The only thing I would change is too put a little less brown sugar in it. Otherwise it was the best sloppy joes!!!

Excellent recipe. Quick and easy to prepare. Just enough to feed my family of 5. I did not have green pepper so I added one medium onion. Will definitely make again next week. Update: I use 2 lbs ground beef, 1 large gr pepper, 1 med onion and a little extra ketchup.  That will feed our family of 5 with some for lunch the next day.

I just made this for the first time in my life today, always added either the canned version or with the powder in the envelope.  That's what I grew up on, as a baby boomer.  THIS IS NOT MY MA'S SLOPPY JOE!!!!!!!!  It's ridiculously better!  It is just plain old tasty, delicious, and easy to make.  I made 6 times more than this, and it was enough for probably 15-20 people.  I tasted when done, and it was a little TOO sweet, so I added two small cans of tomato paste with the same amount of water to tone it down.  Also reduced ketchup by 1/2 cup so I could add 1/2 cup barbecue sauce, and was glad I did.  I also added a couple pinches of red pepper flakes.  This one's going down as a family favorite,  My thanks to you for the recipe!

Love these sloppy joes - one of the best comfort dishes ever for me, and this is the only recipe I use for them!!  I use less brown sugar, a tad more mustard and then throw in a few shots of worcestershire sauce along with real garlic as opposed to the powder.  I also add some water or broth before I let it simmer, or it tends to stick to the skillet. Using ground turkey doesn't change the taste of these either!! Thanks!

This is soooo good. I had about 1# of  leftover roast that I shredded up and tossed in with the ground beef, doubled the ketchup and brown sugar and it was perfection in a pot. Don't skimp on the garlic! It really brings the flavors together. I used a course ground garlic powder with ground parsley - added a few extra dashes, of course - and it was a huge hit with the whole family. I served this with macaroni salad and some fresh veggies and ranch on the side. A keeper for sure.

It was so good! I have never made sloppy joes and this recipe will be the only one I use. The only thing I changed was 1/2C. Ketchup and 1/4C. BBQ sauce. I also added a few shakes of Red Hot sauce. (all that someone had suggested) I left out the sugar because it was sweet enough for us! It was a little on the spicy side for me, but my boyfriend finished the pan!

This was a great, basic sloppy joe recipe. I didn't add the green peppers seeing that my hubby does not like them. My one negative comment about the recipe is that the serving quantity was incorrect. I think the 6 should really be a 4. I had to make 5X the batch in order to feed ten boys two sandwiches each.

Fantabuloso! The only thing I did different was add half a cup of barbecue sauce, and some Worchestire sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

It feels a little strange to give a sloppy joe recipe 5 stars, as they just don't strike me as 5 star food in most cases, but for sloppy joes, these were very good!  My husband and 6 year old practically inhaled them.  They weren't as well received by my four year old, but nothing with meat ever is.  I used ground turkey instead of beef (on sale for $1.99 per pound!).  I used 1/2 cup kethup and 1/4 cup of spicy BBQ sauce.  I added a shredded carrot and a little more green pepper than called for since I'm always trying to sneak in some extra vegetables.  I served these with french fries and veggies with dip and it was a quick, easy, inexpensive meal.

My family (and extended family) loves this recipe. Since my husband and I don't eat beef, I experimented by making this with ground turkey and boca meat ... by far the ground turkey was better (and really quite good).

Unbelievable!  This was super easy to make.  I had all the ingredients on hand.  I made it with leftover taco meat and used Coleman's prepared mustard, so it was spicier than the recipe intended.  Definitely will keep this in the front of the recipe file.

WOW!!  I get to have sloppy joes again! lol My husband HATES anything sloppy to eat so for the past 20+ years they were never on the menu.  I made this recipe, hollowed out some Bolillo rolls (both sides - the bottom is just about a 1/2 deep), placed cheddar cheese in the bottom, filled the top with this mixture and no more "Sloppy" Joe!! Also, my daughter who HATES onions and green peppers, LOVED it. Pleased all of the picky eaters in this house!! I have made this 3 times since first getting the recipe 2 weeks ago, requested by my husband!!  Once I did make a change of using brown sugar b-b-que sauce instead of the ketchup and brown suger.....was really good and kind of stick to using that instead now.  Highly recommended from this house.

Oh Wow! These were so good! I had some cooked bacon I needed to use up so I added it. Now it will most likely be a regular in this recipe. The saltiness of the bacon mixed nicely with the sweetness of the sauce. I didn't have bell pepper, but it wasn't missing taste-wise. No more canned sloppy joes!

I sent my husband to the store to buy Manwich and Buns.  Needless to say, he returned with everything but what I had requested. After trying this recipe my family will NEVER go back to "Manwich" again. This is so delicious and very easy to make.  We added a dot of liquid smoke to this and it was great.

This is a very good recipe.  I like to give this a little fiber by adding in a can of kidney beans and a handful of cooked wheat berries.  That way there's always a little left over for lunch the next day!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I'm not really a sloppy joe fan, but I thought this tasted great.  I did, however, make the following substitutions:  instead of 3 tsp brown sugar, I used 2 tsp Splenda Brown Sugar Blend and 1 tsp granular Splenda, also I used spicy brown mustard.  The only complaint was that my fiance thought they weren't quite "sloppy" enough, but I kind of liked mine better that way.

I read the 10 most recent reviews on this recipe before making it.  I doubled the recipe, without any changes, because I suspected it would be a real hit with my husband and it was.  At first I thought it might be too sweet, but the sweetness works!  And reheating the next day only intensifies the flavors more.  This will definitely become a regular meal in my home.

Overall great recipe. I did add minced garlic that I had on hand. The only problem for me is that it started drying out too quickly on the oven. So I added about a half can of tomato sauce and it turned out perfectly.

I haven't had sloppy joes for years and this is how I remember them!  Great basic recipe but with a few modifications- decrease brown sugar to 2 Tsp and ketchup to 1/3 cup, add 2-3 cloves finely chopped garlic, season to taste with chili powder, paprika, and onion powder. And for a little extra kick add 2 Tbls of BBQ Sauce. I made them extra sloppy by adding 1 cup of tomato sauce.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was great! It was easy and got raves from my family. It was a bit lacking on the sauce for our family, so I added an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce, 1/4 C of water, and a couple splashes of Worcestershire -- PERFECT! This will definitely go on our favorite meals list!

This is certainly a family favourite! We're a "hockey" family so it's easier to throw this in a crockpot for a few hours on high setting in the early afternoon than it is to cook just before supper, and my son has a hearty supper with no fuss before his game! Enjoy!

We were really disappointed that there was no "sauce" in these sloppy joes. Taste was fine, just no sauce! The texture was more like the ground beef that you put on a taco. I used Heinz ketchup, maybe it's too thick for this recipe. Ended up adding half a can of tomato soup and a T of Worcestershire sauce to get the sloppy consistency we like.

pretty good. can't go wrong. easy to make. only small complaint....not juicy enough. Tasty, but not incredibly moist like canned varieties (although undoubtedly still better). delish!

Great recipe. My family loves it. We also add a can of beans in tomato sauce to make it stretch, as well as add tang and protein. Thanks!

Pretty good & easy recipe. I like it that you can control what goes in since my kids won't eat anything with green pepepers in it. It seemed a little too salty so I gave it 4 stars. Next time I won't add any additional salt. I also felt the need to add a little water. Will make again when in need for a quick
dinner.  Thanks Tamara.

Very good!  Nice simple comfort food.  I didn't add any sugar at all - didn't need it (was salty, but in a good way).  Also added about 1/2 tsp chili powder.  Will definately make again.

Very easy.  Uses common, on-hand ingredients.  Good flavor, though my husband thought it was too sweet.  I did add a little more ketchup and a little water to make it more "saucy".  Will probably decrease brown sugar to 1 teaspoon next time I make. I keep 1 lb. portions of already browned ground beef in quart ziplock bags in my freezer to make prep of things like this extra fast, easy.  I also keep on hand frozen, pre-chopped onions which makes it easy/fast too.

Since we're vegetarian, we used the Morningstar crumbles (1 package).  It turned out fantastic!  At first try, we thought that it was a little too sweet...the ketchup overpowered the taste.  So, we added a teaspoon more mustard and 1/4 teaspoon chili powder.  That did the trick.  We enjoyed it on hamburger buns, with a slice of cheese and potato chips on the side.  A quick and easy dinner!  Thanks!

This is very, very good! My kids beg for this all the time. I leave the green peppers out and use minced dried onion to hide the onions in it. Oh, and I'm always in a hurry when I make these, so I've never actually waited 30 mins. for the meat mixture to simmer. Still SO good!  Thank you so much for the recipe!

Wow, what a nice surprise! This was very good! I followed the recipe except to cut the brown sugar to 1 teaspoon and added a splash of Lea & Perrins and A-1. This did not need 30 minutes to simmer, it was ready almost immediately. Thanks for the post!

This was a excellent recipe.  We made it for our church dinner one night.  It was a huge hit.  The only thing we did different was we seasoned the beef with seasoning salt and fresh garlic when cooking.  Other than that, it was easy and delicious.  Thank you for posting it.

Very yummy sloppy joe recipe!  I did, however, make some changes to accomadate what I had on hand and how we like it.  I was making this for a pot luck so I used, 3 1/2 lbs. ground beef, 1 cup each green pepper and onion (about one small pepper and one med. onion).  When browning the beef, I seasoned with salt/pepper/chili powder.  In a bowl, I mixed 1 can (12 oz) tomato paste, 1 can (15 oz) tomato sauce, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 3 tsp. mustard, 3/4 tsp. garlic powder, and a few drops hot sauce.  After browning and draining meat, I added this sauce and simmered in my crock pot, adding a little water to keep from getting too dry.  Very good, and it was eaten up quickly!

Very good recipe.  I didn't measure anything, just used these ingredients and added some of my own.  I added worcestershire sauce, molasses (sp?) and some ground ginger.  The ginger gives it a really good flavor.  Do yourself a favor too - make a very large batch (3-5 lbs) and freeze the leftovers.  I promise you will make this recipe again and this will save you some time :)

Quick and easy! Not to mention Great Tasting. This recipe brings me back to childhood. It is a great way to get small children and Big Kids to eat their green peppers.  I changed the Ketchup to Tomato Sauce to make it a little more SLOPPY!!

This was a great recipe, but I did make a few changes. Instead of the chopped onion and garlic powder, I mixed an envelope of onion soup mix to the ground beef, and added 1/2 teaspoon minced garlic while it browned. I used dijon mustard and a full cup of ketchup, added a tablespoon of Worstershire, and only used one tablespoon of brown sugar. I didn't add any salt since the soup mix had plenty. With toasted buns, it was absolutely delicious. My 4-year-old gobbled it right up, and she asked for seconds! This was very tasty and easy to make, and I will use this method to make Sloppy Joes from now on. Thanks, Tamara!

I cook for a school (age 3-15) and the children love this one.  I feed about 60 kids every time i make this one.  It is the right flavor for kids (and the adult teachers that also eat).  I make this 2 times a month.  This is one of the "favorites"

YUM.  Doubled the recipe, making it the perfect  Potluck dish.  SO easy to make (Perfect for college students on the go who already have all the simple ingredients!)  I did have to keep adding WATER after I mixed in the ketchup (maybe 3/4 cup or so?) so that it could actually "simmer", careful not to thin it down too much.  It held up beautifully.  I found using a ground beef (+25% fat, most of it drained out anyway, plus the beef was MUCH cheaper than the chuck, so bought 2.5 lbs instead of 2.0 to compensate) instead of a ground chuck made my sloppy joes a lot more homogenous and appealing to the eye.  I seasoned and browned the meat first, then let the beef drain in a collander, leaving a little fat in the pot to caramelize the onions and bellpeppers (also seasoned) for a couple minutes, then tossed the beef back in and simmered for 30.  I added more mustard to counteract the sweetness.  Nexttime, I will add less sugar and more bellpeppers.  Thanks!!

5 Stars +!!!! We like Manwhich too - but no more!!!  Followed it exactly except like others I added less brown sugar which was always my complaint about Manwich - too sugary.  Now I have perfect Sloppy Joes.  I do agree with other reviewers - double the amount of sauce - since this was my first try I ended having to pull everything out and make another batch quickly.  Served it over toasted hamburger rolls with melted cheez whiz for those that wanted it.

I made this one night when I had some left over hamburger buns and I was out of the canned sloppy joe mix.  My husband and I both liked it a lot.  It was so easy to make and tasted much better than the canned Manwich or Del Monte that I usually use.  To cut down on time I use the frozen chopped onion and green pepper.  I will definately be making this again!

I've been making this for years now.  Instead of garlic powder, I add a few shakes of Worchestershire sauce.  I grew up eating a non-sweet, chunky tomato-based sloppy joe...this is how my mother-in-law makes them.  Great with a side of corn and tater tots... By the way, I always serve potato chips with this meal and my husband and kids eat them ON the sandwich.  I tried it last month and it is an interesting addition to the sandwich!  DON'T PASS UP THIS RECIPE!!!!!

Really great recipe. Based on others' reviews, I added a bit more ketchup and some red pepper. Next time I'll reduce the brown sugar a bit because it tasted a bit too sweet for my liking, but this is still great.

I made this recipe for my daughter's 5th birthday party and they were a huge success.  The only thing I did differently is I did increase the recipe by 4 and I used half ketchup and half Hot and Spicy Chili Sauce and it had the perfect amount of kick.  Way better than Manwich.  We will be making these again.

This was very good. I added some chili sauce to it and it was wonderful. A little on the sweet side so next time I will add less brown sugar. Much better than the canned stuff and so quick and easy. Great meal for busy nights.

Very good, I did add and sub. some items from the recipe (like always...hehe).  I did not add the mustard or the brown sugar.  I did how-ever keep the ketchup, onions, and green peppers.  I was afraid it would be to ketchup-y/mustard-y so I omit them. I remember sloppy joes having a BBQ flavor to them, so I did add little amounts at a time(KRAFT ORG. BBQ)till it gave it just the right zing of BBQ flavor to it and like most sauces it has amounts of brown sugar to it already so it had the right sweetness to it and no need for the brown sugar.

Wonderful!  This is a staple at our house.  I use 3/4 cup of the ketchup and 1/4 cup of barbeque sauce.  I also add about 1/2 teaspoon of chili powder.  I serve this on fresh potato rolls.  The whole family loves it.  Thanks for sharing!

The only problem with this recipe is that it did not make enough for the second and third helpings requested by my family. Next time I will double, OR TRIPLE! Awesome!

I had never made Sloppy Joes before but my Mum used to make them when I was a kid and I loved them.  I'm not a pepper fan so left this out and my whole family loved it.  We had them for tea last night. I will definately add this to my list of family favourite meals.  Thank you!

This is a fantastic recipe. I'd never done Sloppy Joe's from scratch and wanted an easy recipe--this is it. I accidentally left out the brown sugar, but put BBQ sauce in instead. I would recommend upping the recipe if you are going to feed more than 3-4 people.

When I asked my boyfriend if it tasted like sloppy joes, he thought I had added something to the can, but I said these were homemade!!! He was extremely impressed.  Who would have thought that you could make sloppy joes (sans preservatives) from stuff everyone has at home!  I followed the suggestion by Cheryl, left on 5/2/02, and it worked out GREAT.  THANKS!!!!

We added some extra water and covered it while simmering and it turned out great!  Definitely a keeper for us.  It only makes about 3-4 sandwiches, so we'll definitely double it next time.  :)

This was WAY too sweet for me and my family.  I had to add chili powder and onion powder to it to try to mask some of the sweetness.  After I added the chili powder, it was great!

I've never had Sloppy Joes before -- a little too sweet for me. But my husband and my step kids finished it up. There was none left after dinner, so they liked it! Pretty easy to make, no fancy ingredients.

This was the best sloppy Joe recipe. The things I changed was that I added 1 Tbsp of Worcestershire sauce and decreased brown sugar to 2 tsp. Thank you for the recipe.

I simmered the cooked ground beef in a 1/2 cup of chicken broth, garlic powder, a small amount (1/2 tsp?) of onion powder instead of chopped onion, dried green pepper (1 TBS?)  instead of chopped green pepper, a spoon of olive oil, and a I few crushed red pepper flakes (1/4 tsp?), covered, until it reduced to barely wet, to get it extra flavorful. Then I stirred in the ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar and let it simmer, covered, another 5 minutes. 
If it seems too flat at the end, try stirring in a little salt. If it seems too sweet try stirring in a spoon of fresh squeezed lemon or a spoon of vinegar.

I make this All the time but I'm in the middle of moving so all my stuff is packed I'm making my sloppy joes and look around and I have no brown sugar so I substituted honey and it turned out really good so honey will work in a pinch but my go-to was still would be brown sugar thank you

Really good Sloppy Joes recipe. Of course I made a few changes. I had more people to feed so I used 1.5 pounds of ground  beef. I doubled everything else except for the brown sugar (I used the 1 tbsp it called for) and added some onion powder and a dash of cumin. 
I browned the veggies on high for about 10 minutes (stirring frequently). I then set them aside and threw in the ground beef, spreading it out all over the surface. I allowed it to brown on high for about 13 minutes before even touching it. This got a nice sear on the beef which added to the flavor. Only then did I separate it and mix in the other ingredients. Turned out perfect!

Family favorite!! I cooked the peppers (used red instead of green) and onions first. Then browned the meat. I added 1 TBL of white vinegar,  1 TBL of Worcestershire sauce and about 1 tsp chili powder.

This was really good. I've always used the sauce from a can, but this was easy, simple, and best of all, my 6-year old daughter loved it.  She killed it. She gave it 4 thumbs up (toes were included). It's raining outside and this is a recipe keeper for when it's stormy outside. It's warm and homey. I did serve it with french fries. I might try a different side next time, but french fries are pretty perfect.

I added red pepper flakes and just a tad of bbq sauce. Next time I’ll replace the red pepper with jalapeños and minus the Sweet Baby Ray’s bbq sauce (sweet and spicy) because it came out a little to sweet. I still enjoyed it and will make again!

I make this recipe as written and it has become my husbands favorite!  He didn’t care much for sloppy joes before, but now requests this.

this was a very good sloppy joe, my family liked it. two picky boys and husband who eats anything.  I oldest said(11) he would prefer it not to taste too much like Ketchup so next time I will try half barbecue half ketchup.  Toasted some buns in oven and had it with a slice of mild cheddar cheese.  I will make it again.

Great recipe!  Quick and easy with ingredients already in the house.  Had to make more for my husband because my boys and their friends devoured the 3lbs I made for dinner.  I did use 1/4 cup of bbq sauce and 1/2 cup ketchup, and less brown sugar.  This is a keeper.

It was amazing I tweaked it a bit. I decided to leave out the peppers and added 1/4th Jack Daniels honey-bbq sauce. The leftovers were just as good as the day it was made!

THIS recipe has become a STAPLE in our families dinner routine- the only thing I’d say is that I have doubled the recipe for 2 adults and 2 kids (3 & 1) because what it calls for is NOT enough if you like to make sloppy, juicy, yummy piled on sloppy joes AND have enough for leftovers.  This is a MUST make!!

Have made this at least 10 times. Amazing. One lil change. Added red peppers instead of green.  The subtle sweetness compliments the brown sugar's sweetness.

awesome flavor and super easy. changes i made: hate green peppers so i substituted with whatever i had of red, orange, and yellow peppers. also increased the amount of onions.  cut the sugar by 2/3. added Worcestershire sauce as well (to taste). didn't drain the meat. simmered for only a few minutes at the end until it was the consistency that i liked.

My husband often asks for Sloppy Joes instead of hamburgers for a change.  This is the second time that I haven't had a can on hand and have used this recipe.  It's great and MUCH better than canned!  I chop up green pepper and onion with my mini-chopper and throw that in with the beef.   I follow the recipe however, I do add a bit of water, or beef broth if there is some in the fridge, to make it soupier.  The taste is good....not too sweet for us.  I like it also, because you know what is going into it and use fresh ingredients.

I made this exactly as published.  I hadn't had sloppy joes in a long time., and I don't really have a favorite recipe so gave this a try.  Very enjoyable.  A bit on the sweet side and not too sloppy.  Had no trouble simmering for 30 minutes in a very nonstick pan.  Would definitely make again.

Turned out great by following the recipe exactly, but it was a bit too sweet for our personal taste. Took some recommendations from others and added 1 tsp of vinegar & 1/2 tsp of worcestershire sauce to take some of the sweetness out. My new & super easy recipe to replace the canned stuff!

Super awesome. Made it with elk meat instead of beef, and it was wonderful. My family ate a double batch in one sitting. If my daughter and her husband come to dinner, we'd need double double.

I just made this recipe and I loved it.  Before making any recipe on the site, I read multiple reviews to look for tips/modifications for the recipe.  In the case of this recipe, I decided make a few of changes.  1) I made 1 1/2 recipe of the sauce ingredients,   2) used 1/2 tomato sauce and 1/2 ketchup and 3) used less brown sugar.  I mixed all of the sauce ingredients together before adding to the ground beef, onion and pepper mixture.  For the sauce I used: 5 ounces tomato sauce, 4 ounces ketchup, 3 tsp brown sugar and 2 tsp mustard.  It was the perfect amount to keep the mixture from becoming too dry after 30-35 minutes of simmering.   Never need to use the canned stuff again.

Perfect sloppy joe recipe. I double the recipe, just not the mustard because my husband hates mustard. You can still taste the mustard but just a tiny bit. I use chopped garlic from a jar and cook it with the ground beef instead of garlic powder. I have made it with real onion and onion powder. It's great either way but my kids like it better without real onion. Also, I do not add green bell pepper.

Versatile! We'd never had sloppy joes before (we're Australian) but the kids and I decided to have  an American themed dinner of Sloppy Joes, complete with crisps on the side. I had read reviews first, so I added the brown sugar last and to taste (used less than half the suggested amount) and I added a bit more mustard, and replaced 1/3 of the tomato sauce/ketchup with bbq sauce. They were yum!

I had made a double-batch, so for tonight's dinner I heated the leftover sloppy joe meat up with a tin of crushed tomatoes and a large handful of frozen peas, corn and carrots. Topped it with some mashed potato and a sprinkling of cheese, and cooked it in the oven as a shepherd's pie. I also turned the day-old leftover buns into garlic bread to serve on the side. This was even more enjoyable than the sloppy joes had been. 

For less than $15 to feed four people two different meals over two nights, we'll be doing this more often. Thanks.

I did the following modification: used 1/4 cup barbecue and 1/2 ketchup and also, this recipe NEEDS 2 cups of water or broth to simmer in. This sets in the flavor into the beef and makes the meat tender, and with draining the meat juices and putting sauces with not enough liquid into it, it did not have enough liquid to simmer (this may be why people are having problems with it sticking or not cooking properly), just puffed out hot air every few minutes. I also sauteed the onions in butter and balsamic vinegar, then added the beef to it and browned that, drained, then went on with the sauce with water. I've found that sauteing with balsamic is a wonderful compliment to any recipe using tomatoes or tomato sauces (it has a unique sweet tang that compliments the tomato's sweet tang. Don't let the strong vinegar odor fool you, it cooks off, just use about a tablespoon or two and you're good. It's also very good for you, is a very good source of potassium and has other health benefits).

My husband loves sloppy joes and I don't. I saw this recipe and showed it to him and he immediately wanted to make this. He made it and let me tell you I don't like sloppy joes but this recipe was good. I loved every minute of my sloppy joe sandwich. The recipe is simple and doesn't ask for a lot of ingredients. It was a great dinner.

Great simple recipe. I took another cook's suggestion and did half and half catsup and BBQ sauce , and omitted the sugar. That worked great, since I always seem to have more BBQ sauce on hand than catsup. It's a very flexible recipe. I added a little extra meat and water as well. No need to buy the canned stuff - not when everything you need is on hand.

This was great, first time ever making Sloppy Joe's and aside from maybe letting it simmer longer or cooking it in a crockpot when I have time in the future I wouldn't change it.......except the color of the pepper......went with red not green.

I did as another suggested and did less ketchup and some sweet barbecue sauce. This was so good!!! Even my picky toddler loved it. I didn't have buns so baked it in biscuits instead, awesome finger food I will probably use it for a party appetizer one day.

Delicious!  I love this recipe because I always have the ingredients at home.  I double the sauce ingredients (except the brown sugar) because we like our Sloppy Joes SLOPPY.  It's also good with ground turkey or half turkey/half beef.  My teenage boys love it.  Great go-to when I'm in a pinch.

I've made this recipes at least a dozen times. It's an easy and quick dinner for my family. We are a large family, so I usually double the recipe. I have followed the recipe exactly (besides the addition of a little water and some quick oats per a reviewers suggestion sometimes), but we prefer it with 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup BBQ sauce. The last time I made it without the green bell pepper since I forgot to buy one. Still was delicious. Makes good leftovers too.

A go-to easy meal for my family! I use more brown sugar (4-6 tbsp) and only simmer for 20 mins if that. We also make 2 lbs and use the leftover for breakfast burritos. Mix with the scrabbled eggs and you have Sloppy Jose’s! Delicious!

Instead of 3/4c of ketchup, I did 1/2c of ketchup and 1/4c of Sweet Baby Ray's Brown Sugar BBQ. And because I used that BBQ, I only used 1tsp of brown sugar.

Just made this and it is so good!  I didn't have ground beef, but I did have ground venison.  I used one reviewers suggestion of omitting the brown sugar, cutting the ketchup back to 1/2 cup, and adding 1/4 cup of barbecue sauce.  So yummy!  My fourteen month old loved it, even :)

Great and easy. What I added was a tbsp worcestershire and vinegar. No sugar as condiments such as ketchup and mustard contain enough of it. Mmm mmm good. PS: substituted red peppers.

This was a big hit on pretzel buns! I didn't have brown sugar, so I used molasses. I also added a few dashes of Tabasco for my family's preference. A winner for sure.

Just tried this tonight....very yummy. I made it as written, eyeballed the brown sugar part and probably did a little less than asked for....as I was scared it might be too sweet.  It was really a good, easy recipe that the kids liked.  Served it over garlic bread...yummy.

Absolutely delicious as is. For a change, I subbed bbq sauce for some of the ketchup and left out the brown sugar. This was so good and very similar to the canned BBQ flavor sloppy joe sauce that I can't buy anymore.

Before finding this recipe I spent a good month trying all the different variations here on this site, as soon as I tried this one I knew I found the one that was going straight into my cook book. I highly recommend this recipe.

This recipe was awesome!  I used Heinz's Balsamic Ketchup and added some red pepper flakes but think that it would still taste pretty good as-is.

My kids can't stand it when I make new things.  They'll say "Not another NEW recipe from allrecipes!", and they'll complain about whatever I make, they will taste it, but usually they give it four thumbs down........... well not with this recipe!!  They absolutely LOVE it!! I've made it several times, and there are never any leftovers!!  Thank you, Tamara - your mother knew what she was doing!! Delicious!

Absolutely delicious. I substituted 1/3 cup of ketchup for Hawaiian barbecue sauce. Now I have a new recipe for Sloppy Joes. :) thanks

However I first blended and simmered the ingredients then I added the raw hamburger. once the added altogether, also I added about three tablespoons of bbq sauce and 1 tablespoon of heinz steak sauce. I let it simmer for 45-50 mins and then served on a lightly toasted hamburger bun.

Very good - I make this on week nights when time is short. I use Dijon mustard instead of yellow mustard and, because we like a little spice, I throw in a little chipotle powder. Yum! Thanks for the recipe.

This is so basic and yummy! After I brown and drain the meat I throw everything in the crock pot on low for a few hours and the ingredients meld. I stick to the listed ingredients and let them simmer for the best taste. Thanks!

Awesome!!  I used 90/10 turkey and added 1/2 teaspoon of allspice.  Definitely will be a staple in our home.  Ground Jenni-O was $2.15 a pound @ Walmart.  Thank you so so much Tamara!!!

Very good for an easy fast sloppy joe  evening.   Used Turkey, a little Worcestershire  sauce....salsa for the green peppers, onion powder, garlic powder, Dijon mustard, 2 tsp of brown sugar and bbq sauce.    Worked like a charm.  I also doubled it cause that was not going to serve all of us (4).   :o)

Wow - I see why this has so many great reviews. It's fabulous. I sauteed the onion (and two heads of garlic) until translucent, then added ground chicken (healthier than meat, and with the sauce, no one noticed) and red pepper, then the seasoning. It was as easy as it was tasty.

Everybody liked it. I'd prefer to make it this way than from the can. I browned the beef with Worcester sauce and fresh onion and green pepper. Drained the grease and added ketchup mustard and brown sugar and black pepper. I added more brown sugar than I probably should have but no one seemed to mind.

This recipe is very similar to my own but I also add a splash or two each of Worcestershire & White Vinegar. I'm sure it's very good as is though.  I just prefer a little more zing to it.

Easy to prepare.   I like to use ripe (red) peppers which are sweeter.  Next time I may add chili peppers.   Any extra stores well for a quick hot sandwich later in the week.

They love it just as is.  Even the kid that doesn't like sloppy joes likes it!   If you live with a deer hunter, this is the perfect way to disguise it.

This is such a nice change from Manwich which is really the only option these days. There are a few adjustments to make to the recipe before it really deserves 5 stars, and you can find them in previous reviews. By the way, thank you everyone for the suggestions.

My boyfriend wasn't too excited when I said we were having sloppy joes for dinner. Once he tasted it, he loved it so much he almost ate the whole pan! I love this recipe. Simple ingredients, fast, and easy to make. This is going to be one of my go-to recipes. It goes great with some homemade baked potato wedges.

I wanted something simple and easy for dinner. My husband and I have not had sloppy Joe's in a long time. I hate the canned stuff so I figured I would give this recipe a try. I love that the ingredients are everything I already have at home and it is so simple. My husband literally had three sandwiches and said "this is way better than manwich!!" Thanks for the recipe! We will be keeping this one!

I had to make some slight variations due to cooking for those with really strict sugar intake limitations, so replaced the 3TBSP of brown sugar with half that amount of white sugar mixed with low sugar molasses. To fix the flavour loss, 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1tsp of both nutmeg and ground cloves worked nicely, still tasting clearly like classic sloppy joes, with a hint of extra class, and just as easy to make. The base recipe was quick and easy on its own and simple to adjust to my needs without falling apart. Most certainly will fall back on this again in the future!

Delicious! But I omitted the brown sugar, added 6 chopped mushrooms (sauted) and substituted the ketchup with 1/4 cup of Heinz Chili Sauce. It was a hit: not too sweet, not too sloppy. Goldilocks would approve. (Not enough for 6 though)

Delicious and easy!  I doubled the recipe and the only change I made was to substitute 1/3 of the ketchup with barbeque sauce as others recommended and added some crushed red pepper flakes. Next time I will add a little less brown sugar (the sauce was a tad too sweet for me). Will definitely make again.

Yummers, We love onion so I added a little extra super finely chopped, used fresh garlic, but other than that made no changes. On mine I added a little hot sauce since I love heat. Great recipe and fantastically easy. The whole family likes this way better than the canned stuff.

I tried this recipe last night and just really didn't care for it. I guess I'm too used to the good ole manwich mix taste and this was totally different. It was very sweet.. too sweet in my opinion. The family enjoyed it however they are two men who would eat bricks and say yummmm. lol

I haven't had sloppy joes in years, and I'm glad I started with this recipe. It is easy to make, and you change the recipe according to your own tastes. I made 1 1/2 times the sauce recipe and it was perfect. I also add 1/2 cup of Sweet Baby Rays barbecue sauce and simmered 20 min. Next time I will leave out the sugar it doesn't need it.

I have never left a review before, but I HAD to for this dish! It was absolutely perfect and delectable. I doubled the dish so my boyfriend and I could have leftovers and there were barely any left for that! I didn't add the green peppers just because I'm not a fan but other than that I didn't change a thing and it was delicious!

I tried for years to make my mom's sloppy joes. This one tastes just like mom's used to when I was growing up! I use orange and yellow peppers instead... just a personal preference. It's the only recipe I use.

I made these on Halloween last year and threw everything in the crock pot to keep warm while trick or treating.  My whole family loved these, even my picky kids!!! I've made this recipe about once a month since, thanks for the delicious and easy recipe!!

The one ingredient that gives a sloppy joe it's kick is missing!  You absolutely have to have a splash of vinegar, otherwise it's just ground beef swimming in ketchup! Once I added the vinegar though, it was delicious.

My hubby LOVED this! He wanted sloppy joes, I didn't have the typical canned stuff, jumped on AllRecipes and viola! Here is was! I have been instructed never to buy canned again! The only thing I changed was no green pepper, husband does not like them. Easy and delicious! Thanks for sharing this one, it is a keeper!

I didn't care for this recipe too much (but I was never a huge fan of sloppy joes to begin with). My boyfriend on the other hand really liked it. I thought it was a little on the dry/ ketchupy side and not as "sloppy". Maybe I'll add in BBQ sauce next time as others suggested. Will make again if the BF suggests it.

We're on a health kick, so we used ground turkey. I omitted the bell pepper because I didn't have one on hand. I also sautéed minced garlic with the onions instead of powdered garlic in the sauce, added a pinch of red pepper flakes, and then I added a tsp of soy sauce with the ketchup to add some depth since we used ground turkey. I also added 1/2 cup chicken broth to make it a bit more saucy. Next time, I'll use tomato paste instead of ketchup. It's a great base, and one I'll continue to experiment with!

Loved this recipe! I added 1 cup of ketchup instead of 3/4 cup and also added 1 tsp steak sauce and 2 tsp apple cider vinegar. Simmered for 20 minutes. It was so much better than the canned sauce!

This is AMAZING!! I made a few small changes. I almost doubled the onion, did about 1/3 c green pepper, doubled garlic powder, added just a smidgen extra mustard,  added an extra 2 tsp brown sugar, added 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce. This is a new go-to!

Easy and yummy. Great quick weeknight meal, easy to tweak to your family's personal tastes. I increased the sauce (extra 4 Tbsp ketchup, 2 tsp mustard, and about 4 Tbsp BBQ sauce) we also added a chopped jalapeño to the sauté . Very hearty, we really enjoyed it.

I really enjoyed this recipe. The only flaw was that it wasn't "sloppy" enough. I will add a little more ketchup the next time and seasonings.

Very good sloppy joes! I put a little less brown sugar in it as I thought it would be too sweet. I used about 1 1/2 tsp and it would still very good with just enough sweetness.

Just excellent.  Forgot the sugar,and used spicier mustard.  Got raves.  Better than canned sauce and really doesn't take longer.  My family like more onion and peppers as well as celery.

I made this using Turkey meat. The taste was great, but I did change it a bit. I added about 2 TBSP of Worcestershire to the sauce mix in a bowl and then added it to the meat. I am not sure if anyone else's was like this, but for it to be able to simmer for 30 min, I HAD to add water. I added about 1/2 cup(enough to almost cover all the meat evenly) and brought to a boil. Simmered for about 20 minutes, until the sauce thickened back up. This allows the flavors to cook and saturate the meat, rather than just sit on it.

I have just thrown all the ingredients into my small crockpot..just 'guesstimating'..no accurate measuring...am trying it with Morningstar Farms brand of Ground Meatless, which is a meat substitute. I can already tell we are going to love it just by the smell and a tiny taste from the mixing fork. Totally agree with never using Manwich again! So easy! Can't wait till dinner! THANKS! This gets five stars before we even eat it! I am THAT confident!

We all really liked this added a little crushed red pepper and minced garlic. Will cut back on the brown sugar next time, a little too sweet for me, but very nice base recipe to play around with.

This is definitely better than purchased sandwich sauce.  I made alterations based on what we prefer:  meatloaf mix (instead of grd. beef) and shallots (instead of onions.) This will be the only sloppy joe mix I will use from now on.

Made as directed except used fresh garlic.  The hubby who does not like green pepper was very impressed.  Will never used the canned version again.  Next time will add some barbeque sauce in with the ketchup as many reviewers did.

I like this better then any of the cans or package mixes.  You may need to add some water to this recipe during the simmering.  Overall the best sloppy Joe I have made.  Oh and don't forget a splash of your favorite hot sauce.

"Very good" is what he said. I added 2 additional teaspoons of brown sugar, which was perfect (we like sweeter sloppy joe). I will never use Manwich again!!! Yum

Excellent, Easy, Cheap.  I did add another quarter cup of ketchup -- used 1/2 Heinz and 1/2 Country Ketchup by Stonewall Kitchens to give it a little kick. I found that 20 minutes cook time was all that it needed.

Great recipe! I loved the flavor. My family said it resembled Manwich but had a bit too much of a "ketchupy" taste so next time I think I'll cut the ketchup down to 1/2 cup like a couple others had commented. I also added a dash of Worcestershire as someone had recommended. Loved the addition. With these couple of tweaks I think I will keep this on my regular to make list for manwich night. So long cans!

Oh, yum!  Took the suggestion to use 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup BBQ sauce. I'm cutting down on sugar, so I used a couple tablespoons of tomato paste instead. I did add about 1/2 cup water so the meat could simmer without burning.

I make this recipe all of the time.  Today I used ground turkey. Very easy recipe and the best. My Daughter makes this recipe as well.  I give it 5 stars because I am sold on it. I have been making it for a long time.  Thanks for posting such a good recipe.

Let me add a caveat.  I wanted to like this recipe.  I wanted to rave and shout about how wonderful it was.  But, as written, this recipe had one major issue: too sweet. 
I made it as is, and could only taste the brown sugar and the ketchup.  It was too overpowering.  
I then made it a second time, omitting the brown sugar altogether, and using a spicy wholegrain mustard (Zatarains Creole Wholegrain Mustard), upping it to 1 tablespoon.    I also added 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce.  The reincarnation we loved.  But as written, it is a one-note wonder that just didn't work for us.

These were amazing, and so easy! Hubby ONLY likes manwich so I made these while he was at work to see if he noticed. He said they were so good, and then I revealed the secret! I did add Worcestershire sauce, and it added the right smokiness it needed. I made them for a crowd and they were yummy! I'm not normally a sloppy joe eater, and I came back for seconds. I will never buy manwich again!

It was a good dish  the reason why I am rating it four stars was because I personally ran out of ketchup and the Joe's weren't sloppy =) . But even with what I had to work with the recipe tasted well. I'll be prepared next time!

Made this recipe many times now and it is a hit every time! The only doctoring I ever do is adding some worchestire sauce, and occasionally more ketchup or water when the sauce gets a little thin. But I give it a 10/10, for a simplistic, delicious blend of flavors that brings you back to childhood. Made these with a hobo potatoes recipe from this site last night and it was quite the meal!

Instead of 3/4 cup of ketchup, I used 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce, 1/4 cup of ketchup, plus I added liquid smoke, 2 tablespoons of sofrito, 1 teaspoon of minced garlic, 1 teaspoon of olive oil, 1/3 cup of water, 1 teaspoon of cornstarch. Stir sofrito, garlic, onions and olive oil in a pan. Mix the meat with the rest of ingredients in a bowl (the brown sugar, salt, pepper, mustard, BBQ sauce, ketcup). When everything is well mixed, transfer to the pan with the golden onions, sofrito and garlic. Let it cook for about 30 mins. Warning! If you cook this while any hungry male is in the house, you might be harrassed. Stay strong and take your time. Enjoy.

This was so simple! I had some ground beef I needed to cook so I looked up sloppy joes hoping I could use ketchup since I had no tomato sauce or paste.  This was the 1st recipe that came up & I was so happy!  Other than the bell peppers (which my family doesn't like anyway), I had all the ingredients because they are so basic. My husband said it was the best sloppy joe he had ever had!  I agree with another reviewer, I will never use the canned stuff again!

Yummy! Loved the recipe. It's easy and delicious. The only change I made was to use ground turkey rather than ground beef.

I followed this recipe to the "T". My family loved it! I did serve it in a bread bowl and added shredded cheese the second time I made it. My girls have officially changed the name from Sloppy Joe's to Fancy Joe's. I make it at least once a month!

This recipe was too sweet. When I cooked it we have a large family so I double it and I almost wasn't going to eat it because it was so sweet. I fixed it as much as I could with some hot sauce and black pepper but it was still very sweet. If I make again I will only put a little bit of sugar and then add more to my taste preference.

No more canned stuff for us. This recipe is very good, however, I did follow the advice of others and use some BBQ sauce & Worcestershire sauce & omitted the brown sugar.

I love sloppy joes, but I think adding the brown sugar made it way too sweet. I will omit the brown sugar next time and then I can give the recipe a 5 star rating!

It came out great!  I substituted 3 large cloves of garlic and added chopped tomato.  I also did 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 BBQ sauce and eliminated the brown sugar.

I used this recipe with a twist...literally. 

I added spicy sausage links. I cooked them fully then chopped them (more like minced them) down in my Nutribullet. Additionally, I used the Nutribullet for both the onion and green pepper (drained the juice). 

Other than those twists, I followed the recipe and this was the best tasting sloppy joe EVER. I have leftovers for the next few days.. yay.

Finally an easy and GREAT sloppy joe recipe!  My husband likes the tart/bitter taste of sauces and I love the brown sugar/honey flavors.  This recipe was a perfect blend and the best of both worlds.  My 3 & 5 year old even ate 2 servings.  THANK YOU for finally making a simple dish simple for me!! :)

5 stars because the original recipe was great, but even better than that, I used a couple of the reviews edits, and added a twist of my own. I used 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/8 cup BBQ sauce, 1/8 cup Italian dressing (gives amazing flavor mixed with the BBQ sauce), a teaspoon of Worcestershire, and a pinch of steak seasoning. Had an amazing flavor. I also put two pieces of sliced cheese in after it was done cooking, and stirred until completely melted. It was a huge hit!! (:

Quick - Easy - Yummy! I did make a few changes. I used 1/4 of a bag of frozen 3 pepper & onion mix, I didn't have prepared mustard so I used regular, & I added fresh diced tomatoes. Family & friends enjoyed it!!

This recipe is a good one, but I like it a bit more saucy. it has a good flavor, I pared it with Belle's Hamburger Buns. You can find it 
here. and I have made them twice. I will make both of theses recipes again. they went well together. Thanks, Happy Cooking!

Great recipe! I subbed BBQ sauce for part of the ketchup, and left out the brown sugar as recommended by another reviewer, and these were the best sloppy joes ever. My son, who "hates" sloppy joes loved them. I'll surely use this recipe from now on.

This was really good didn't need to go to the grocery store for any of the ingredients. though we had no onion and a orange bell pepper for green also didnt measure out the sauces and just free-eyed it. Oh and I used real garlic instead of powder. A hell of a lot less brown Sugar. One more other thing we added cheese on the buns. Ok maybe what I ate wasn't sloppy joe 2 and maybe sloppy joe 3.

I told the kids I was going to make sloppy joe n tator tots for dinner and come to find out I didn't have a can of my regular popular brand of sloppy joe sauce which we always use and since we had artic blast with wind chill of minus 15... I didn't even wanna drive to the store 2 blocks away just for a can of sloppy joe sauce. So I hurried to search on this site for the recipe and what caught my eye was the amount of reviews and glanced at the ingredients to see what I had on hand...Shoot, NO garlic powder. I took a chance to add 1/2 teaspoon of chili powder....  O..M..G..I took a taste after throwing if as following directions minus garlic powder and replacing with chili powder....My 8 yr old goes, "When can we have it again??"  =)

This recipe was way too sweet--I should have tasted it before adding the brown sugar! I would consider making it again, but I would omit the brown sugar and green bell pepper, because I don't think the pepper added anything to it. A little Worcestershire sauce and a splash of red wine helped tone down the sweetness and gave it a deeper flavor.

Totally delish and quick. My kids devoured these. I didn't want to use ketchup as a base so I used 1 cup of plain spaghetti sauce, a bit of rice vinegar, a little extra mustard and brown sugar. They came out amazing! Serve with a salad and dinner is done. Thank you!

I just made them again. This time I used half ketchup and half BBQ sauce as the base (after reading another review) and it was the perfect tangy/sweet combo!

I have eaten this several times and it is always so good I love this recipe.  best Sloppy Joe ever.  I am going to try taking Pillsbury biscuits and placing them in muffin pans pulling dough up on sides and filing them with the Sloppy Joe mixture and popping them in the oven sounds yummy.

AWESOME!!  My family of 7 loved these sloppy joe's.  Was out of Ketchup so I added Big Rick's BBQ sauce ( www.bigricks.com ). LOVED IT!!  Also left out the brown sugar since the BBQ sauce had it.  It was easy and quick to make.  Even my picky 6 year old ate all of it and LOVED IT.

I enjoyed the flavour; I omitted the green bell pepper as we didn't have it in our kitchen when I decided to to make it, but even without it it had a nice sweetness and kick to it. However, I wasn't a huge fan of the texture; I found that the sauce was a little lacking to make it truly "sloppy." I would make this again, but perhaps tweak it to make more sauce.

This recipe is great! If you want a bolder experience, try adding BBQ sauce, chill powder and dried chili flakes. It really brings out the flavours.

Really good. I made it almost exactly as written. I left out the green peppers and used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. I added a little bit of water so they were "sloppy". Will definitely make again.

I tried this and my family and guests loved them.  The only changes I made was to leave out the green pepper and I added a bit of horseradish to eliminate the "too sweet" factor.  Yum.  Try it.

I made this for a Fourth of July party. Everyone loved it. I couldn't believe how many compliments I got for Sloppy Joes.  I make a batch and freeze it for a fast lunch or dinner My son-in-law is a hunter. My daughter uses ground venison in this. I don't like venison; but to my surprise it was very good.

WOW!  Made with 9 lbs ground chuck for a fundraiser at work and admittedly these guys aren't too hard to please, but it was gone in 7 minutes!  Loved the flavor (hey anybody notice it is gluten free?).  I added 3 tablespoons worsteshire sauce (gluten free) for zing.  FABULOUS recipe.

Loved this recipe! Made it for a family gathering and everyone went crazy over it (going back for 2nds and 3rds & asking for the recipe). I decided to make it again for myself and figured out that it was EVEN BETTER the longer it stands in the fridge. DELISH!

I left out the brown sugar and bell pepper.  I added some homemade salsa, a little bit of my favorite bbq sauce and more ketchup than called for.  These were the best sloppy joes ever! Great base recipe to put your own touch on.

Awesome recipe! I made the recipe as-is minus the green peppers (bc my husband hates them) and it turned out perfectly. This recipe was very easy to follow and it was my first time making and eating sloppy joes so I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked them. My husband was very impressed that I made them from scratch and also described them tasting exactly the way a sloppy joe should taste. I will never buy the canned mix now bc this recipe is delicious and so easy. Thanks for a great recipe!!! This will be my go-to from now on!

Easy and delicious. Everyone loved IT! Made this for a large group by quadrupling the recipe and received compliments all around. The only change I made was substituting red bell pepper for the green, since that was what I had. If you think it is too sweet leave out the brown sugar.

Good recipe! It seemed a bit dry, so I added a lil more ketchup and about 1/2 cup water. I only simmered it for 20 mins. Used spicy brown mustard. Very tasty!

Ok, so I substituted tofu for the ground beef, used bbq sauce instead of ketchup, used lettuce instead of green pepper because that is what I had on hand and it wasn't that great.  Sound familiar?! Yeah, I am not that kind of reviewer but think it is ridiculous when people rate recipes low because they do not follow a recipe.  How about this, make it as is, if it isn't to your liking, then rate it how many stars you feel it deserves.  Here is my review:  Yummy!  My kids gobbled this up, as did hubby and I!  I did double the sauce and it was perfect.  Nice quick and easy meal during the busy week of homework, sports and life with food I usually have on hand.  A+

This was good. I agree with the other reviewers that it doesn't have to be cooked that long. I also adjusted the recipe slightly like other reviewers and cut out the brown sugar and replaced some of the ketchup with BBQ sauce only because I ran out of ketchup.

This is the first sloppy joe recipe I have tried that did not include vinegar, and now I know that vinegar is what my family didn't like. Gave it too much bite. This is the perfect recipe for our family...delicious and easy. Thank you!

My family thought this was yum yum to your tum tum!!! Quick and easy. Like another reviewer instead of using all ketchup I used ketchup and BBQ sauce that had brown sugar in it. I also used fresh onions and pictsweet mix because I didn't have green bell peppers. My four year old is very picky and she loved it. Next time I will probably puree some green beans or carrots to add veggies to the mix. Yum!

Pretty good.  Browned and then put in crock pot.  I think that I may use less brown sugar next time a little sweet for my taste.  (because will definitely make again).  You could even use ground chicken or turkey.

Made this last night for dinner.  The only change I made was substituting the green bell pepper with a red bell pepper.  Otherwise, made it exactly as written.  It was super!  Both the BF and I loved it and he said it was a keeper.  Next time, I will double the recipe so we have some leftovers for the next day!  UPDATE:  Doubled the recipe using the following changes:  2 lbs beef (depending on the level of lean/fat in the meat, I used up to 20 oz of ketchup for more sauce); 1 lrg red bell pepper; 2 cups chopped sweet onion; 1 t garlic powder; 1 T mustard; and kept the brown sugar at 3T.  It turned out awesome!

Great easy recipe for sloppy joes!  I didn't have green peppers, so left those out. I like it saucier, so I added about another 3/4 cup of tomato sauce for the extra amount, rather than using all ketchup.  Tasted great!

I don't eat hamburgers but, my husband does.  I made this for him and he loved it.  :)   I used 1/2 C ketchup and 1/4 C barbecue sauce as suggested by another reviewer.  He said it was the bomb.

Great start to a sloppy joe sandwich!  Was a little too sweet for our taste so added a little white vinegar to cut the sweetness and only used 1/2 cup ketchup.  Served it for my husband's poker group and they thought it was great!

This was a big hit at our house.  My husband said, "This is the best sloppy joe I have ever had."  Good enough for me.
I made a few adjustments.  Doubled the recipe but tripled the sauce, left out the bell pepper since we don't care for them, and also added a total of about 1/2 cup of water while it was simmering since it seemed very thick.  I was afraid it would taste like ketchup, but the flavor was perfect by the time it had simmered down.  I butter toasted the buns and added a thin slice of cheddar cheese.  Mmmm!
I also took another reviewer's advice and froze some in muffin tins for future single servings.  Freeze, pop them out, place them in a freezer bag and easy servings to reheat later.  This recipe is a winner!

Great recipe!  Just like the Sloppy Joes I grew up eating.  Simple & easy.  We have these pretty frequently because they're so fast, easy & delicious & the ingredients are all stuff we normally have on hand.  I'm not sure what the folks who gave it negative reviews expected.  It's a Sloppy Joe, not Beef Wellington!

I normally don't even like sloppy joes but I decided to try this recipe based on all of the great reviews. My husband and I both loved it. I did do about half ketchup and half bbq sauce and just 2 tspns of brown sugar. Delicious.

SO yummy! I will never use Manwich again! I used yellow pepper cause that's what I had on hand and totally forgot the garlic powder and it was still great! Not too sweet or too much BBQ flavor. Just perfect!

I have used a recipe almost exactly the same as this one for years but I also add 1/4 cup bbq sauce and 1/4 tsp. Worcestershire sauce.  These sloppy joes are amazing! I have also multiplied this recipe by ten when I cater! Everyone LOVES them!!!  My mother would serve these for family dinner on a bun, opened-faced with a slice of American cheese and baked just long enough for the cheese to melt.  A family favorite!!! Enjoy!!!

Great recipe! I loved the mixture of flavours and textures... certainly different than the average sloppy joe. I did add about a cup of Ragu sauce in it since our family likes it a little more sloppy - and we all absolutely loved it with this extra addition. Delicious! :)

As an American living abroad, I've found myself missing the stuff I grew up eating. These taste just like my mom's Sloppy Joes, and I didn't need to open a can. I added shredded zucchini and diced mushrooms, and added a bit of extra zip with a second spoonful of mustard and a shot of Worcestershire sauce, but even if I had followed the recipe to the letter, it would have worked out to be quite tasty!

This really is a five star recipe, but it needs a few adjustments. Instead of using the full amount of ketchup I cut out half a cup and replaced it with BBQ sauce. I also added a bit of sage and a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar. I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the entire liquid mixture, but it did turn out a little watery so I ended up needing to add 4 tablespoons of flour. Next time I try it on the stove top I don't think I'll double it again, but I do plan on using this recipe in the slow cooker so for that I'll double it again to keep it moist. This is a perfect base recipe, but taste it as you go and add/exchange ingredients to get it perfect for you and your family's tastes.

Oh this was soooooo good, I made it with Ground Turkey and wow my husband and I loved it.

Did not have any bell peppers but it was still great, we did spice it up a little adding some cayenne pepper, and a little more garlic powder, and since I had some left over tomato paste we used that and added some water, plus a little Worcestershire sauce.

This puts manwich and the packaged stuff to shame.

Thought with so many reviews these would be great.  They are "ok" but nothing amazing, even for a sloppy joe!  These are entirely too sweet.  IF I make them again I will cut back considerably on the sugar.

I like this recipe but the second time i followed the reviewer's suggestion to add some quick oats to thicken it, this made it much better. My suggestion to bring your sloppy joes to the next level is to toast your bun under the broiler with cheddar cheese on it to melt the cheese. delicious

Thanks for the awesome recipe! I hate Manwich! I was looking for a 'homemade' sloppy joe recipe for my family and happened upon this. I liked the general makeup and decided to give it a shot. I doubled the onion serving, substituted the green pepper with jalapeno, omitted the brown sugar and added 1/3 cup of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. My family loved it and I finally found sloppy joes that I like. Thank you so much.

This recipe was too sweet for my taste. I feel like it could have done without the brown sugar, since the ketchup has sugar in it anyway. I added some chili powder and paprika to balance the sweetness, which ended up tasting like a really great BBQ sauce. Not my favorite for sloppy joes, but the hubby told me to write it down as a BBQ sauce recipe! I think next time I will leave out the brown sugar and maybe try tomato sauce or stewed tomatoes instead of ketchup. All in all, it wasn't bad, but I'd rather have the canned stuff than this recipe.

I've made this several times for the pickest eater and it's a win everytime. I do substitue 1/4 of ketchup with bbq sauce (mainly because I never have enough ketchup in the kitchen). Something new: I started buying puff pastries in the frozen section and stuffing them with the sloppy joes and a bit of cheddar cheese. Put it in the oven at 400 for about 15 minutes and you have delicious sloppy joes in a pocket. Yum.

Very yummy. I took the advice of some other reviews. I first sauteed the peppers and fresh garlic the added ground turkey meat. I used half a cup of ketchup and a quarter cup of Gates BBQ sauce. I also added two drops of liquid smoke, some water and a handful of oats.

The first time I made this, I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  My husband said they were the best sloppy joes he'd ever had.  I made them again tonight but was missing a couple ingredients so I was a little nervous that they wouldn't be as good.  I substituted jarred roasted red peppers for the green pepper and minced garlic(2tsp) and garlic salt(1/2tsp) for the garlic powder.  In addition, we love onions so I used about 3/4 cup.  My husband told me I had to write it down because these were now the best.

This is a great recipe, but if you have them, try the roasted red bell peppers in the jar.  We loved it.

I used half a red onion, garlic, and browned a pound of hamburger meat, then I added a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes.  Put that in my crock pot and added about 1/4 cup yellow mustard (eyeballed), about a tablespoon of brown sugar, then BBQ sauce to taste, and a hint of apple cider vinegar.  Sorry, I don't measure.  YUMMY.

This was really good!! I followed some other reviewers and did 1/2 cup ketchup and the remainder barbeque sauce and omitted the brown sugar.  To add a bit more moisture I also added a splash of chicken broth and rice vinegar.  I served it on top of toast with butter and gratd parmesan cheese.  Goodbye canned stuff!!!!

After reading the reviews I doubled the ground beef, used a whole small onion and a whole green bellpepper and tripled everything else, it had just the right amount of sauce. My boyfriend loved it, he said it was the best sloppy joe he ever had. Super easy and delicious. I might cut back on the brown sugar next time, a little too sweet for my tastes.

My teenage daughters complained the WHOLE time I made this dish, saying ewwww and just make Manwhich! When they finally tasted it they BOTH went back for seconds. Throw away that canned sloppy joe mix, this is way better and healthier!  I also only used 1/2 cup of ketchup as a previous reader submited. other than that, I followed the recipe to a T and it came out GREAT! The husband and picky kids give it 5 stars!

This recipe is my go to for sloppy joe's!  I do triple the "sloppy" part as my family likes them EXTRA sloppy and I also add some apple cider vinegar, I feel it cuts the cloying sweetness and adds a bright note!  I'm not sure those that had so many changes have actually had REAL sloppy joe's!

Amazing!!! My family loved this and I will never buy from a can again. I added worcestershire sauce and some tangy sweet bbq sauce that I had in my fridge to give it a little more tang. And I didn't add the garlic. Goes great with fries and beer. So easy to make!!!

Great recipe.  I like to add a little Worcestershire and Apple Cider Vinegar to it.  That makes it closer to the Sloppy Joes that momma used to make. 
It's a very easy recipe to follow and do.

I tweaked it a bit but it was great! Instead of 3/4 cup ketchup I used 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 honey chipotle bbq sauce and did not use the brown sugar. My roommates loved it! Thank you so much!

Very good.  Also a great base recipe to make your personal changes to.  I used fresh garlic minced instead of garlic powder, cut out the green pepper and used 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 bbq sauce.  cant wait to try other reviewers alterations.  mostly this recipe is great because it is simple and good.

Great base recipe.  Tweaked by adding a splash of sweet baby ray's BBQ sauce in lieu of the brown sugar.  Don't add both sugar and BBQ sauce or it will be too sweet.
Also substituted red & orange bell pepper for green.  The flavor of the gourmet peppers compliment the recipe better.

These were good, but had to be modified for our tastes. They were too dry, so I added a little more mustard and more ketchup plus more brown sugar to make them less tart.  Thanks.

I only gave it 4 stars because it got a little dry for our liking, I even added more ketchup & brown sugar. Flavor was amazing though, I will make it again and make sure to add some more of the "wet" ingredients.

This recipe was absolutely delicious! After reading the comments, I tweaked it a little by replacing about 1/4 cup of the ketchup with BBQ sauce (any BBQ sauce will work, I used Kraft Honey bbq sauce since it's my fave), omitting the brown sugar to avoid it being oversweet, and adding a little more yellow mustard. Perfect on warm hamburger buns. Served it with a vinegar-based coleslaw (store baught coleslaw bag, apple cider vinegar, sugar, and a squeeze of ketchup) that went perfectly with the sloppy joes. This meal was incredibly fast and easy to make. Better, healthier, cheaper, and easier than the canned manwich. A++++!

Rating this a 3 as is. My changes:  used 1.25 lbs. lean ground beef, doubled the onion and pepper, red pepper instead of green, 3 cloves fresh garlic chopped, doubled the mustard and used 1/2 Dijon and 1/2 yellow mustard, 3/4 C. ketchup, 3/4 C. BB@ sauce, 4 Tblsps. worsteshire sauce, no salt or black pepper. I did not drain and added approximately 1/2-3/4 C. water as it was cooking to get it to the best consistency. Served open-faced on rolls...yummy!
Basic recipe you can build on.

I moved from Florida, USA to Australia and they had never heard of Sloppy Joes. I make hot lunches at the school once a week so I made these for them and they haven't stopped asking for them. I am making them again this week.

I will never buy Sloppy Joe mix or sauce again.  Sometimes I add a little bit of BBQ sauce for some variety and my family actually prefer it this way.  Great recipe!

Great recipe! I used orange bell peppers instead of green, and it made everything just a little bit sweeter.

Have made this recipe twice in two weeks (hubby's request). I used a combination of Bullseye Original BBQ sauce and ketchup, and I use ground turkey instead of beef. That saves you the step of draining the meat, because turkey doesn't make a lot of juice. Plus, it adds more flavor. I also added some crushed red peppers for a little heat. Yummy!!! Oh and I double the sauce. Just wasn't sloppy enough...lol

I grew eating Sloppy Joe's and the way my mom made it (with chunky carrot, Spaghetti sauce) I hated it!!!!! I wanted to try something different & give this one 5 stars because it tastes even better after the day it was made... I tripled the recipe and added about 1/4cup of brown sugar plus the instant oats as recommended :)

Great and easy to make. My kids were so excited to eat this.I did away with the brown sugar and used the modification of 1/4 cup barbecue sauce( Kraft Sweet and Spicy Chipotle Barbecue Sauce) and 1/2 cup ketchup. Yummm!!! Will definitely be a staple on our "Kids, what would you like to eat today?"menu.

I puree the onions and green pepper so the kids don't notice them - and they love this recipe! Don't skip the 30 minute simmer - the flavor really develops here.

Made this for the second time, but without brown sugar since I didn't have it. Both times came out great!  Family loves it and it's perfect since the canned brand is expensive due to imports.  Won't be buying the brand name anymore!

Great recipe. I was trying to find a recipe like the one that my mom makes and I knew that she used brown sugar and ketchup but I wasnt sure of the amounts. After I made this recipe it tasted almost exactly like hers. Great recipe!

Tasty and simple using ingredients on hand.  My family loved it.  I have been doing something different with my ground hamburger and it tastes much better.  Instead of adding the chopped onion with the raw hamburger - I add the chopped onion after I drain the hamburger - then I cook them both together for a few more minutes.  The onion keeps it's flavor and makes everything you use ground beef and onion mixtures taste much better.  My husband even notices and he isn't crazy about onions like the rest of us are.

Great basic sloppy joe recipe!  Didn't use the brown sugar but we used double the mustard instead, using the honey mustard.  A great potluck staple!

This is a great basic recipe. I never follow a recipe, down to the details, but rather let it 'inspire me'. My inspiration from this one included using pork sausage, dehydrated chopped onion and green bell peppers, fresh minced garlic, regular mustard, raw sugar, tomato sauce, a few hot pepper sprinkles, some paprika powder, and a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce. I let it cook down until nice and thick. Then we used it in tortillas rolled up as burritos. Family approved!

Absolutely amazing.  I've never made Sloppy Joes before, and this was fool-proof!  I'm studying abroad and all my international friends couldn't get enough; I have to make it again tonight because they loved it so much! Perfection right here ladies and gentlemen.

I had to add a table spoon of tomato paste to thicken the meat mixture. And, to take some of the sweetness out I will omit the brown sugar next time since, the ketchup already makes it sweet. Otherwise, this was very good and I will make it again.

great recipe, I didn't have the 1/2 hour to simmer it, but did it only for 5 minutes.  The flavors blended enough for it to taste great, but could be longer.  I probably still would just simmer it for the 5 minutes in the future anyway. Makes it just as convenient as the can.

excellent! I followed the suggestion to decrease the ketchup and add BBQ sauce.  I also cut down on the brown sugar...my husband gave this 2 thumbs up!

So good!  I made 8 lbs for our daughter's birthday party and it all went!  Everyone raved about how good it was.  Omitted the bell pepper though.  This is the only recipe I will ever use!

These were great!  My 3 and 7 year olds gobbled it up, and my husband and I liked it too.  I just made a couple of changes, we don't like green peppers and onion so I left them out.  I also substituted the brown sugar for 1/4 c of bbq sauce.  Served it with a slice of cheese on hamburger buns.  Yum.

Really enjoyed these sloppy joes.  Accidentally used 3 tablespoons of brown sugar instead of teaspoons but the kiddos loved the sweetness.  I'll be more careful next time:)

I'm from Asia and I never had sloppy joe before so I can't really compare it to anything. This recipe I think is way too sweet for a savory dish.

I tried the recipe today and it was absolutely yum! My husband and son loved it. They said they dont want me to buy frozen burgers anymore instead we could have this.  It's juicy, it's something different for us. I will definitely include this on my menu planner for my family

In addition to the ingredients for this recipe - You need to add 1 - 1 1/2 cups of water, bring to a boil and then let simmer for 40 minutes - add a dash of Worcestershire and this is the perfect dish!  It will thicken once removed from the heat in about 5 minutes.  It was not too "ketchupy" or "sugary" once you add the water.  It had a nice smooth taste.  We always use ground turkey and the kids don't even know it!!  (to get away from the "pink slime" in most ground beef)

Awesome sloppy joe recipe.... I really like to switch out the meat as well, ground boar makes awesome in sloppy joes especially when you put it in the crockpot. Remember to throw the veggies in the frying pan prior to the crock pot for that browned color and caramelization. double yum.

So quick, easy and yummy. I substituted ground turkey for the beef and added veggies like 1 cup diced carrots, 2 diced roma tomato and 1 can kidney beans while cooking the meat. It needed a little extra sauce with all the extras I put in. I added some bbq sauce that I needed to get rid of.  Piled it over whole wheat toast. Yum! Not sure its even sloppy Joes anymore with all that I changed, but its a easy weeknight meal.

Perfect! Simple. Quick. Honestly, it was ready in 15 minutes. Once we added the ketchup, we let it simmer for about five minutes . . . and then it was time to eat!

I added a bit more mustard, nixed the brown sugar, and added about half a cup of water and it was perfect! Be sure to take into consideration the sweetness of the ketchup you're using - I used organic publix brand ketchup and it is much sweeter than most so, the brown sugar was unnecessary.

This was great as it is.  I used ground chicken and it was excellent.  It is cheaper to make than Manwich and has more vegetables per serving.

I do agree with some users here on using BBQ sauce as well as ketchup. I added about 1 cup of water at the end just to loosen up to simmer. Very good recipe super tasty without all of the spice of the seasoning packet or can. I would definitely recommend.

Mmm!!! This was deeeelicious. I really underestimated this one. I didn't have any green bell peppers but it was tasty anyway. I've been advised by my family to keep this recipe & make it again ASAP :)

This was really good - will definitely make again. It was a little sweet for my taste, so will reduce the brown sugar next time. Would also consider replacing some ketchup with tomato sauce to also cut down on a little of the sweetness.

These were better than Manwich. I subbed 1/4 c. ketchup with 1/4 c. barbecue sauce and added some water for a "sloppier" joe.

This is a terrific recipe for a basic 'like mom's' sloppy joe recipe. I always have these ingrediants on hand - I do often skip the green pepper, in the winter and don't really miss it.

Good flavor. I used 1/2c ketchup and 1/4c sweet chili sauce. I'm not a big sloppy joe fan but this tastes good-it's not overwhelmed with sauce like how I've had it served before.

SO. GOOD. i just eyeballed the mustard, ketchup and brown sugar- and it still turned out amazing. OM NOM NOM. i would suggest whole wheat buns. healthier and they complement each other better. top the sloppy joe mix with some cheddar cheese too!

I don't measure anything for sloppy joes but these are the ingredients I use, plus a splash of worcestershire and a squit of bbq sauce.  I typically don't simmer for a full half hour, just until the liquids have reduced. Easy peasy weeknight meal and good way to use up hamburger buns.

This was excellent.  I changed a few things.  I added a Tbsp of Worcestershire and about a 1/4 cup red hot sauce.  Lip smacking good.  No more Manwich in this house!

Awesome recipe! I added some Worcestshire and A1 since I used turkey burger (to up the meat flavor).  I also hide carrots in the mix.

Terrific! Beats the store bought sauce in a can any day!  The only thing I wish was slightly different was that the meat stuck together a bit more. I don't think more ketchup is the answer though.

Make more of the sauce. I used a full green pepper (medium size) & about double the onion (wanted more veggies) and doubled the sauce & it was perfect! (don't think original recipe would have been close to enough sauce). Very yummy! Made Much better than any canned or packaged option I've ever had. Quite ketchup tasting so would add more spice next time.

As many others have said, this is a really good basic sloppy joe recipe.  I did as other suggested and doubled everything but the meat.  I also cooked the meat and veggies on the stove and then transferred them to the crock pot and added the sauce and cooked on low for about 2-3 hours.  I used dijon mustard, I used red and green bell pepper,  and I added a few dashes of tobasco.  It was really delicious!  And definitely an easy meal to feed a crowd!

I thought I would browse sloppy joe recipes to see if there were any variations and this first one is the one I use all the time. The only thing that I don't add is the brown sugar and my hubby says that it is much better than manwich. Love it! I think I'll just stick with a winner :)

Family loved it and it was very easy! Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I changed it based on what I had on hand that I needed to use up. I used ground turkey instead, added finely chopped carrots, and substituted BBQ sauce instead of the ketchup and brown sugar. Will be making it again!

I put in 3/4 cup of condiments -- the majority is ketchup, but then I add in a little of pretty much everything I have:  worcestershire sauce, a-1 sauce, balsamic vinegar, salad dressing, horseradish... it all goes in there.   Granted, I typically triple this recipe either because it's for a party or to freeze leftovers, so it's easy to get a good mix of condiments.

I do this then serve it to a group, and it gets rave reviews.

Definite keeper.  Only thing I changed was using brown sugar Splenda (cause that's what I had on hand) and using 1/2 the amount (cause that's what you're supposed to do.)  Still a little sweet for my tastes, but easy, and made with stuff I have on hand almost all the time.  Quick & tasty!

My kids did not think they would like this as they are used to the canned sloppy joe mix but they loved this recipe. A keeper for sure!

My whole family loves this recipe!  We use this on top of hotdogs as a coney sauce, we eat this on top of egg noodles, and we eat it as sloppy joes.  This is one of the few reipes that my whole family loves.  I have a family of four and I always double this recipe because 1lb of beef isn't enough.   I recommend trying this recipe at least once.  I make it ahead of time and put in the crockpot to simmer.  It really increases the flavor and it is ready when we get home from the ball game....quick and easy!

As other reviewers said, I added about a fourth of a cup to half a cup extra of ketchup, which helped the meat not stick to the pan. I simmered on low/warm and added extra brown sugar as well. I also added crushed red pepper to give it some kick. 

Overall, the meat is much tastier than I remember from eating sloppy joe's in my school cafeteria!

This is a great recipe for sloppy joes.  It passed the kid & husband test! I don't see a need to add the salt or pepper to the recipe because it's so yummy anyway.  I serve it to the boys on buns with sliced cheddar cheese- they gobble it up.

Really delicious and so easy!  I like that I can control the amount of tomato flavor in this recipe.  The canned varieties seem to be mostly tomato sauce.

Loved this recipe!  I think I added more onion and pepper than this recipe calls for, but I kept all the other measurements as it states.  Next time I will make a double recipe and freeze some.

My boyfriend said "wow, honey, I've never had sloppy joes with flavor before!"
That speaks for itself! I added extra ketchup, BBQ sauce, horseradish mustard, a beef bouillon cube, 3 cloves minced garlic, and thickened with a little cornstarch. I left out bell pepper. Otherwise followed exactly as stated. Couldn't even tell it was 93/7 ground beef!

Great recipe for Sloppy Joe's, would defiantly use again, would have given a 5 stars but it needs more sauce and you have to add water or it will be dry.  Hated other canned Sloppy Joe's, love this one.

This was excellent, although I replaced most of the ketchup with BBQ sauce. I also baked a side of cheese fries that went very well with the Joe's. My girlfriend loved it and was very pleasantly surprised. Thanks!

I love this recipe! I never thought making sloppy joes was so easy. I usually do the can thing, but not anymore. I did follow one of the other posters idea of doubling the sauce. I also thought for my liking it was just a little too dry. So thank you for posting this recipe!

This recipe doesn't need another review but I just had to put my two bits in. This was fantastic. I usually use the packaged seasoning for sloppy joes but didn't have any on hand and I was really craving these for dinner. Let me just say, packaged seasoning is no longer allowed in my house! This was so easy and it calls for ingredients that I usually have on hand. I was a little worried at first because when I added the sauce to the hamburger it was really sweet but after simmering for the 30 minutes all the flavors came together perfectly. This is the only sloppy Joe recipe I will use from now on.

I wanted to give this recipe a try since I only had bad experiences with Sloppy Joes in the past.  Let me just say we ate every bit of this and wanted more. My kids, Mom and Husband LOVED this dinner. I will definately make it regularly. Great taste, great texture.

as is was just way too sweet and tasted too much like ketchup.  I had to improvise with tomato (v-8) juice andf vinegar.  next time may try with a smokey flavor barbeque sauce?

This came out better then i imagined and my picky fiancee will be pleased! Although i added a tablesoon of tomato paste and a small can of tomato sauce because it wasn't saucey at all. I also added one more teaspoon of brown sugar and a teasoonn of garlic powder due to the added ingredients. It came out AWESOME!!!! first time making this from scratch and now i am hooked and this recipe is saved in my cookbook!

A very good, quick, and easy meal!  I spooned the meat mixture on toasted hamburger buns.  My husband added mayo, cheddar, and pepperjack cheese to his and said it was awesome.  I'll probably stick to just the toasted bun myself, but as long as everyone's satisfied, this is a keeper!  By the way, it is extremely important to note that for the nine years we've been married he has been adamantly against having sloppy joes.  Period.  It's a pleasant surprise that he loved these as I've always loved sloppy joes.  My toddler son loved them too.

I thought I didn't like sloppy joes until trying this recipe -- no lie. I made these only because my fella likes sloppy joes. This stuff is yummy. I will NEVER buy that  in a can again -- this is a true staple recipe for us, and SO easy!

YUMMY!  I have never made Sloppy Joes before so really have nothing to compare it to, but these were great!  I followed the directions except I HATE green peppers so I substituted red and yellow pepper and it was perfect! The left overs were even better that the original since the meat got to marry in the juices overnight.  I used Kings Hawaiian bread buns and my husband begged for it again the next week.

I made this with Loma Linda Vegeburger because I am trying to get away from ground beef. I added a little extra onion and pepper (finely diced) and souped it up a bit with some barbecue sauce, as another reviewer recommended. I put it on toasted buns. Everyone loved it. Quick, easy and delicious!

I changed the recipe around a bit. Instead of peppers and onions (we don't like either), I added 1/2 tsp of onion powder. I also left out the mustard. I used the 3/4 cup of ketchup, but also added 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce. I only used 2 tsp of brown sugar since the BBQ sweetens the meat already. I always brown the meat and add everything to the crock pot to slow cook for an hour or 2. I also add 1/4 cup of water to keep everything moist.

These were the best sloppy joes we've ever had. I've never made or even tried homemade sloppy joe sauce. So easy and delicious. I doubled everything hoping for leftovers. The kids were practically eating it out of the pot with a spoon.  lol I did add about 5 dashes of worcestershire sauce just to balance the sweetness a bit. I will never buy canned sauce again! Thank you!

Excellent. My whole family loved it. Only thing I did different was I followed a previous users advise to double the sauce for one pound of hamburger, triple for two pounds, and quadruple for three pounds.

I just made this for lunch. It was yum, and very easy to adjust based on what I had on hand or what I liked. I used a little dry mustard because I didn't have prepared, fresh garlic and ground turkey instead of ground beef. I added a couple spices to my taste, like celery seed and Worcestershire sauce.

Outstanding recipe. Exactly what I was looking for and reminded me of childhood. Can mixes do not come close to this. It was the perfect balance and didn't taste at all sweet. This is a very easy recipe making it impossible not to try. I did add a splash of Worcester and A1 but it was good even without it.

Tastes just like the canned version but better and without all the artificial garbage. Super easy, in fact, my boyfriend made this without a problem. 

We don't like how sweet sloppy joe sauce is to begin with, so next time we will use a little less brown sugar (not that it calls for much). I gave 5 stars because the recipe is simple and tastes just like a sloppy joe should. We're just picky about sweet stuff- that's our own problem. 

Thanks so much for making dinner fantastic!

LOVED the flavor.  It actually ended up being too watery at the end of cooking, so I added a tablespoon of flour and it thickened up nicely.  I think next time I will double the recipe as I only got 4 sandwiches out of it.  Yes, they were generous sandwiches:)

I'd never had a sloppy joe before, but this was pretty tasty.  I followed the recipe, except added a little bit of worcestershire and bbq sauce, and 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes.  Simmered for about 25 minutes and served on toasted buns.  Maybe our buns were larger, but this only yielded about 3-4 servings (depending on how much meat you want).

I didn't add as many onions and bell peppers. And I doubled the recipe for three people. It almost wasn't enough. Still and EXCELLENT recipe.

So good and so simple.  Much better flavor than that canned junk.  Left out green pepper simply because I didn't have any on hand.  Served on soft, toasted onion rolls.  Will definitely make this on a regular basis.

The mustard and brown sugar add the perfect amount of flavor. They're delicious, and my husband asks for these all of the time. They're so easy that I'm always happy when he does. Win/win.

I usually make sloppy joes with canned chicken gumbo soup, but, since we're eliminating canned food from our diets, I'm on the hunt for a new recipe.

This was good, but too sweet for me. I'll keep looking at other recipes and definitely cut out the brown sugar.

I omitted the green pepper and replaced it with 2 garlic cloves. My mom uses a lot of brown sugar in her sloppy joes, but I really liked this recipe because it wasn't so sweet. I would rather have the salty taste come out than the sweet. I will surely make this again!

My husband walked in the door and said that sloppy joe's really sounded good and I knew I didn't have any of the McCormick mixes left.  So I pulled up this recipe and it was a total hit.  I'll never use the premade mixes again.  I made the recipe exactly as given and used ground turkey instead of ground beef and it was awesome.

This is the way my mom use to make'm.  I'm not a fan of ground hamburger meat, but I found the ground beef at SuperTarget crumbles into tiny tiny pieces which for me, makes all the difference. I also toast the buns with a tiny bit of butter.  SO GOOD!!

This recipe would be a "5" star one WITHOUT the brown sugar!  Catsup has a lot of sweetness and the recipe calls for 3/4 cup.  Leave out the brown sugar and it is a winner.

overall very good. It was a little too sweet for me with the ketchup and the sugar in it. I will make it again but next time I will leave the brown sugar out of it.

This was delicious!  If it's any indication, we ate the whole pan (we normally have leftovers when we use the can stuff)!  I omitted the onion & bell pepper and added onion powder with garlic powder.  I also just did 1/2 cup ketchup & added 1/4 cup bbq sauce instead of brown sugar.  Only complaint about recipe is it wasn't very "sloppy"...may have to add more ketchup & bbq sauce next time.

I omitted the green pepper because I didnt have any.  Added a little worsterchire sauce since we are big fans of its taste!  Definately a keeper!  Really helped me out of a pinch tonight!

Absolutely LOVE this recipe! I will never buy Manwich again! I also used 1/2 bbq sauce and 1/2 ketchup. I added about a tablespoon of worcestershire sauce and a bit more garlic. 
Wonderful contribution to my collection!

wow this was sooo good.  My hubby and I loved it, however, one thing I do agree with is when my daughter is older and I make this for her, I will definately not use the brown sugar cause you really dont need it and it's too much sugar for a young child..  But this was sooo good.  Thanx

I gave this recipe 5 stars only after adding spices.  I added a little all spice, chili powder, and ginger.  I also added 2 Tbs. water just so I could let it simmer.  It ended up being great!

I had red pepper instead of green which it gave a nice sweet flavor. Then I salted and peppered lightly but it cut through the sweet/tangy taste. Others enjoyed it more than I did - I'd give a 3.5 if I could and if I try again I'll skip salt/pepper since there is already garlic powder [and salt in the ketchup].

This is such a nice switch from the powered mix and tomato paste receipe and tastes so much better that even my husband, who doesn't really like sloppy joes, enjoyed it!  I will definetly be using this receipe from now on.

My husband never tried Sloppy Joes as a little kid and I wanted to make sure his first time was a very good one. He absolutely loved these! I did add about 1-2 tsp. of Worcestershire sauce and it created just the right amount of flavor. I already have the thumbs up to keep in the recipe box : )

This tasted so amazing. My family likes sweet stuff so I added a little more brown sugar. They loved it! No leftovers! :( I think next time I'll add some fresh tomatoes to the mix. Definitely added this to my "make often" section of my recipes file! Thank you for the recipe.

A great recipe! Our household enjoys these much bettter than the canned sauce. I like to add a little more bell pepper and onion. I also add a teaspoon or two or Worcestershire sauce and sometimes a little bbq sauce along with the other sauce ingredients. Great!

I've made this twice now in two weeks and the first time I took some of the suggestions and cut back on the brown sugar but the second time I used the 3 teaspoons of brown sugar and it was perfect.  This will be my recipe to use when making Sloppy Joes.  Thank you Tamara!

WONDERFUL! Had this twice now on Hawaiian Sweet Rolls. YUMMY! I have to say though, I did as some suggested and added 1 TBS-Hickory Brown Sugar BBQ sauce in place of the brown sugar. And I also added a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes. Great Sloppy Joe recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Delicious! Just as good as Manwich. I didn't have any green bell peppers, so I just doubled the onions and it was really good. I followed the recipe exactly but did end up adding a tiny bit of water. I am seriously surprised at how good it was.

Only one complaint- not enough leftovers!  This is a great basic recipe that you can tweak to your liking.  I looked at others' reviews and substituted 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce for 1/4 of the ketchup.  I reduced the brown sugar to 2 teaspoons, but probably could have used only 1 teaspoon or left it out all together because the sauce is pretty sweet (but I like sweet).  If you like this recipe, check out Elaine's Sweet and Tangy BBQ Beef, as the sauce is very similar.  Very good, and worth the little bit of effort it takes to use instead of buying canned mix.

Awesome recipe! I did add some bbq sauce and used ground turkey instead of beef. Served with spicy brown mustard, dill pickles and potato salad. A huge hit with my husband who despises canned sloppy joe sauce. This will become a regular in our menu rotation.

The best part was the brown sugar.  I prepared this in a frying pan with the intention of transferring it to the crock pot for serving later.  I found the original to be way too dry for that and added a whole cup of water! I also did not use the green pepper as my digestive tract  just doesn't handle that well.
This recipe closely resembles one I've been making for about 50 years and which my family raves about.  Instead of mustard it calls for Worcestershire Sauce.  It also has about a half tsp of oregano in it.  I usually stir in a tablespoon of flour after browning the meat and onions, which gives it a nice consistency--sloppy, but not overly so.

Amazingly delicious!  I added diced celery and a small diced carrot to mine and a couple squirts of worcestershire sauce to give it a little tang. I cooked mine with the cover onto preserve some liquid, but opened it at the end.  This is my NEW go to Sloppy Joe recipe!

This homemade sloppy joe recipe is so much better than the store bought canned stuff.  Instead of simmering for 30 minutes, I put everything in our crock pot (set on low) for 3 hours.  I also omitted the green peppers since my family doesn't care for them. Thanks for sharing Tamara.

Yum!  We didn't add the peppers because we don't like them, but we followed the directions here.  Awesome and easy!

This was the first time I made sloppy joes but now it won't be the last!  Very tasty.  I omitted the bell pepper because I didn't have any around but made the rest of the recipe as is.

Made this for the first time yesterday. Made for a quick sunday lunch after church. Made it Sat night, put it in the fridge over night, then into the slow cooker to re-heat. Was ready when we got home from church! Added a bit of chili powder for some extra kick.

Great dish. I did make adjustments after reading the recipe. 3/4 of ketchup is almost the right amount for DOUBLE this recipe. I know, since I doubled it.   Also, using fresh garlic, onion, and roasted peppers is a must in my book. I even added one pan roasted carrot to the mix, put all veggies in the blender. Then I added about 1/4 of chopped tomato and it was perfect. Yum.

This was a little to sweet so I cut the ketchup to 1/2 cup and and added 2- 8 oz cans of tomatoe sauce. I was making it in a double batch . 2 lbs of meat and did not double the brown sugar . It was just right for us.. its a winner now in our house.

Very easy and good. I omitted the green peppers and next time I'll use a tad bit less brown sugar. It was a bit too sweet for our taste. Otherwise, fantastic!

I would give the recipe 5 stars after using just a half cup of ketchup and a 1/4 cup of a good quality BBQ sauce. My BBQ sauce was sweet so I omitted the brown sugar. I can't believe how easy this was and will never buy canned sauce again!!!

I had some left over tenderloin, so I ground that and the only change I made in the recipe was to add a 1/4 teaspoon allspice, which added just the right touch of spice to this Sloppy Joe. Definitely a saver!

Save this to your recipe box, it is a keeper. I defrosted 1lb of lean ground beef slated for burgers a little too much and boy am I glad I did. I stayed close to the original recipe except I only had spicy brown mustard. I also added a little onion powder, worch sauce and a sprinkle of Goya Total Seasoning (I use this in about everything!) My family loved it. Thanks Tamara!

This was my first time having sloppy joes, always wanted to try them. I used this recipe but modified it by using Yves Italian veggie beef (spices already in it) and real garlic instead of garlic powder. It came out great and took only 10 minutes. I think I used a lot less ketchup too...used it on a per-needed basis, until it stuck together really.

I have made this twice for my family so far.  We all were not excited about eating sloppy joes, but I decided to make them and my children loved them.  In someone's review they suggested cooking in the crockpot, I think it is an excellent idea.  I plan to try that the next time.  Thanks for the recipe.  Easy and good tasting.

Excellent! As a vegetarian, I used soy crumbles (instead of chopped meat) which cooked faster. I used everything except green peppers (I was out). This was part of a healthy meal. I served the sloppy joes with oven french fries I made and spinach. I didn't put the sloppy joes on a bun (to eat less starches). I can't believe how delicious this was!!

Great balance of flavors and as easy as opening a can mix. I've made it exactly as describe and also in the crockpot (brown and drain the beef first). This is now a family favorite.

I've been making this same recipe, however, I also add chopped celery & one clove of minced garlic to the mixture with the onion, peppers,and ground beef..then I also add some vinegar to it..it's awesome. My family loves it and everyone who's had it always asks for the recipe..I've been making it for years, so I actually don't really measure the ingredients, I just "eyeball" it.

Awesome!  Have used many times and passed along to others.  My family loves this and it is so much better than any packet or can.  I add salt, pepper, garlic powder, and dried minced onion flakes to the meat mixture while browning.  I also add about 1-2 Tbsp of BBQ sauce to the mixture per hubby's request! :)  But, it is a great recipe just as written!

I have been making these for 45 years.  My kids have always loved them.  Now grandkids.  I never used a recipe--just added the indgredients & tasted until it was just right.  One friend thought it would be great for her church sloppy joe night because it was so much easier /cheaper than their other recipe.

A keeper.  Have made twice so far.  Much better than canned sloppy joe mix and easy.

Excellent recipe...I added a few different ingredients and my grandkids wolfed it down...I cut the ketchup back to 1/2 cup and added 1/4 cup of barbecue sauce..I left out the brown sugar because it was an ingredient in my barbecue sauce..After it was all combined I added a small can of diced tomatoes and about 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning...Put a cover on it and let it simmer for close to an hour...It was very simple but very good....I served it on hamburger buns,topped it with some salad greens and put a small amount of mayo on the top bun...real success

GREAT! My husband asked me if I bought a different brand of the canned stuff. It is quite chunky, but that's how I like my sloppy joes!!

Great flavor, easy easy easy. I tried it as written & with others' suggestions - doubled the sauce ingredients & sub in bbq sauce for 1/3 of the ketchup used. I personally like it a bit saucier & liked the addition of bbq sauce. served openfaced with cheese sprinkiled on top. Thanks!!

I gave four stars because it was too "ketchup-y" until I changed it slightly. I made a double batch which called for 2 TBSP of brown sugar. It wasn't enough and the sauce tasted too much like ketchup so I added 2 TBSP more brown sugar. Then it tasted great. Excellent recipe however, thanks!

Very good. I won't have to buy the canned anymore! It doubled perfectly, and I used 1 lb ground beef/1 pound ground venison.

This dish was fairly easy to make and deeeelicious! My fiance had 3 servings of sloppy joes last night :) . I made a few very small variations such as using ground turkey, 3 tsp of water, cayenne pepper and honey BBQ sauce. The consistency was just right and there were no leftovers! Great recipe!

Loved it! The whole family enjoyed these sloppy joes and will definitely make again. The only things I changed was I added about 1 cup Ketchup and about 3 tsp Mustard. And since we were out of Bell Pepper I just omited it but it still tasted great.

Fast, easy and delicious with an unexpected sweetness.  I do add water to evenly distribute the seasonings and then cook uncovered to reduce.

This was so easy for me to make and delicious!  I ran out of ketchup so just threw in some BBQ sauce (almost didn't have enough of that either....I need to restock!) and it was perfect!  I'm a pretty bad cook and even I pulled this off successfully.

I really liked this recipe,I don't use ketchup because I avoid high fructose corn syrup.I used an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce instead. It is not as sweet then, but you can add a little more brown sugar if you want. I found it plenty sweet and did not add any extra sugar.

Great recipe all around. Easy and cheap ingredients are easy to shop for. I took some tips from other reviewers and added a little BBQ sauce in place of some of the Kethup. I used large bakery buns and there was barely enough for three sandwiches.

This recipe is good--it's fast, easy and has good flavor.  I followed the recipe exactly (except I used red peppers instead of green) and like it--I don't think there's anything I would change.  Word to the wise--just because it makes 6 servings doesn't mean it feeds 6 people.  I would say it feeds 3 adults.

Yum!  And I have to believe it is so much healthier for you than Mamwich!  I think it's the perfect amount of sauce, but if you like your sloppy joes sloppy, you might want to make more sauce.

The great thing about this recipe is that it makes use of things you always have in the kitchen so its great for a quick meal. My one complaint is the sweetness. It really kind of ruined this for me. After simmering and tasting I was amazed it was still so sugary because of the ketchup. To make up for sweetness I added about a tablespoon more mustard, a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce, some red pepper flakes, about a teaspoon of chili powder and some ground red pepper. That helped. Next time I would cut the ketchup to 1/3 of a cup and cut the sweetness with a little vinegar. Add one teaspoon of brown sugar or omit completely. I would also consider adding tomato paste to add some acidity but still keeping that tomato flavor.

This recipes is just delightful. Like some of the other reviewer I made some changes: instead of ground beef, i used turkey; I added 2 teaspoons of worchershire sauce; i added an extra teaspoon of brown sugar and used part bbq n ketcup. It came out delicious. I also ate it on a toasted hamburger potato roll.

I used ground turkey as a substitute for the ground beef.  First I cooked the bell pepper and onions in a little bit of olive oil.  I then removed the mixture, added a little more olive oil and cooked the turkey.  Once the turkey was almost cooked I added the rest of the ingredients.  I also added a little more brown sugar than what the recipe called for.

I made a zillion changes, but wanted to say this is a fantastic basic recipe.  Get creative!!  I used ground turkey, shallot and red bell pepper in place of the beef, onion and green pepper.  I also left out the salt (tons of that in the ketchup), but added a splash of red wine vinegar and Worcestershire sauce.  As it was cooking down, it started to dry out, so I added a tablespoon of water to keep in the moisture.  This is a delicious recipe and I highly recommend it either as it stands or for getting creative!

This recipe will insure you never use packet or canned sloppy joe mix, again!  I always used packet mixes for my sloppy joes because of the ease of use.  Until I found this super simple, no-fail recipe!  You can't screw it up!  And you can add and subtract whatever suits your taste with whatever you happen to have on hand.  I was out of ketchup, so substituted one can of tomato paste and a little water tonight.  Turned out excellent.  The first time I made it, I actually added 1/2 packet of spagetti sauce seasoning, because I didn't have any garlic powder.  Turned out excellent.  I love the consistency of this recipe, and I love that I can omit the green peppers and onions and still have a tasty meal.  These are the sloppy joes I remember as a kid!  Excellent basic recipe you can play with if you don't have exactly the right ingredients.  Thanks for sharing this one!!

Outstanding!  Will never buy canned again!!  We made a couple of adjustments for our own taste - reduced the brown sugar to 2 teaspoons, increased the onion and green pepper to 1/2 cup each, added 1/4C water and 1tsp Worcestershire sauce before starting the simmer.  Well done, Tamara - thank you!!!

This is a great recipe.  Easy to make with ingredients you always have on hand.  Extremely tasty as is, but you could always make it spicier or sweeter if you wanted.  Excellent overall!

I haven't made Sloppy Joes prior to trying this recipe but I remember them back in school. They were so awful that I hesitated to try this. When I did I followed the ingredients exactly and it was very taste. I've made this several times but made a few changes at other times due to not having certain ingredients. These are changes we liked: I use colored sweet peppers instead of green bells. I use chili sauce and tomato sauce in place of the ketchup. I add more onion. I use mustard powder rather than prepared mustard. I exclude the salt and brown sugar.

Very sweet.  I'd skip the sugar completely as the ketchup provides plenty of sweetness.

Had some ground beef to use up so I tried this. Did not have green pepper, so I threw in a can of Rotel and cooked in the slow cooker per other suggestions. Super yummy. Absolutely better than the canned sauce.

I hate Sloppy Joes  normally but I am pregnant and got a craving for them and tried this. Mmmmmm! Way better than the canned stuff!! I think I will keep this one even after the baby comes!! I would cut back a bit on the brown sugar next time though.

First up - We don't generally do sloppy joes here in New Zealand, so I don't know how they are supposed to taste. But I know how family friendly comfort food should taste - and these were near perfect. I picked sloppy joes as a good American favourite to try for the 4th of July, and wasn't disappointed. My daughter gave it 100 stars - and the rest of the family weren't far behind in their praise.

A little too sweet.  Added a splash of Worcestershire sauce and that helped.  Also added a splash of water as it was a little dry.  But over all a good recipe.

Very yummy!  I took the suggestion of another reviewer and changed the following.  I used 1/2 cup of ketchup, 1/4 cup honey flavored BBQ sauce and a splash of Worchestershire sauce.  So yummy!

This is absolutely delicious! I don't like green bell peppers, so I substituted them with chopped pepperoncini peppers. I also used about a half cup of tomato sauce instead of the ketchup. Yummy! So much better than Manwich sauce!!!

I have to admit that I was skeptical about this because it seems so easy, but it was absolutely delish! We don't generally eat sloppy joes, but I was looking for something new to do with ground beef, and we all loved it --including my picky toddler. My husband is not a fan of anything with brown sugar, but I made it with it so we could taste this recipe as is before making adjustments, and he could tell it was in there. I loved it as is, but may add a bit less sugar next time for him. We'll be having this again very soon!

If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars I would! My hubby said that it was the best sloppy joe he had in his entire life and I would have to agree with him. I had to double the recipe because I had more than 1/2 lb of ground beef and instead of using a whole cup of ketchup, (because I doubled the recipe) I did 1/2 ketchup, 1/2 brown sugar bar-b-que sauce....AWESOME! I also used Splenda brown sugar instead of regular. Best recipe I've EVER gotten off this site!!!

These sloppy joes are amazingly simple and incredibly good. Best part of all...you know exactly what's going into what you are eating. No artificial junk.

Very good recipes. Much better than the canned sauce. I always add Worcestershire sauce to mine and sometimes a can of diced tomatoes or some shredded carrot to get in more veggies. My kids never notice they are there and eat it right up! I also sometimes use spocy brown mustard instead of yellow for extra zingi!

Absolutely fabulous! My husband likes everything very saucy so I double up the sauce as another member suggested. I couldn’t find beef! Bummer so I got turkey and it still came out fabulous! Thank you very much for posting

This recipe needs less sugar. It felt like I was eating desert with dinner. I would also recommend that people do not leave out the green bell pepper. I think it would have helped with the sugar taste.

Delicious! Cheaper and taste way better than Mandwich.  I had to triple the sauce one serving was a tad bit dry.

These were amazing!  I liked this better than Manwich and loved knowing the ingredients that went into it.  It was a little thicker than canned sloppy joe mix but with a preschooler in the house, that is a bonus! :)  I will definitely be making again.  Note: this recipe makes about 2 cups, so each serving is approximately 1/3 cup.

Good recipe! I'm rating the recipe as written, but a few simple changes bump it up to 5 stars. I was cooking for 2, so I used half a pound of ground beef, but I adjusted the proportions of everything else. So, for half a pound of lean ground beef, I used 1/2 cup chopped onion and 1/2 cup green pepper (we like veggies here), 1/2 tsp ground garlic, 1 1/2 tsp spicy brown mustard, and 1/2 cup ketchup. The ketchup added enough sweetness, so there was no need for additional sugar. It turned out zippy and tasty.

SO good!! I add more brown sugar, but I like things a bit sweeter. I also didn't have any green pepper and it was still delish without it. I could have this once a week.

I didn't know what to make for supper so I logged onto this site and saw that this was the recipe of the day! I doubled it so I would have enough for dinner tomorrow night and my only changes were to add more garlic powder, add in onion powder, and omit the brown sugar. These were great! Thanks for making me a hero at the table tonight!

Delicious! So easy and good. I made this with a cold broccoli salad, rosemary baked potato wedges and stuffed strawberries for desert - all found on this site! Perfect summer food. Little tip: add some crispy onion straws on top of the joe for some added onion crunch.  Great recipe!

Made them tonight--excellent. I left out the green paper (didn't have any)and the brown sugar, and they were great, and plenty sweet. I did not simmer for whole 30 minutes--maybe 20, and the mixture got rather dry, so I added a little water and that helped. I will always use this recipe instead of Manwich!

I never made homemade sloppy joes before.  It is pretty easy and affordable to make.  I found I like it better as it is not as sweet as the jar or packet products from the store. I used 93 percent lean ground beef, so no draining was necessary.  Might need to double recipe to make a decent amount, as some grown men can eat a couple or more, and it reheats well the next day. When I made it I served with chips.  Good quick, easy, cheap meal.

I made these for my fiance and I, and while we both liked them, they could have been a LITTLE more sloppy.  We had our Joes on whole wheat buns with salad and macaroni and cheese on the side.

My family just loves this! I will never buy the sloppy joe seasoning packets ever again, as this taste much better! Love that it's so easy to make, and we usually already have the ingredients on hand (minus buns). Tastes great even if made with ground turkey, which is what I usually do

This was ok, but my husband didn't like it. He was requesting Sloppy Joes and I didn't want it out of a can that's full of bad stuff. I'm not a Sloppy Joe fan myself, I was really making these for him. He said it just didn't taste like it should and it was too thick...not "Sloppy" enough. He didn't like the chunks of veggies in it either. But I'm glad I tried :) Thanks!

Perfect when made exactly according to the recipe.  A little extra sauce can't hurt, though.  Even my extremely picky boys loved this and asked me to make it over and over again.

I made mine vegetarian with Morningstar crumbles.  They were fantastic.  I added a splash of Worcestershire while the mixture was simmering.  Topped with very sharp cheddar.

Oh my gosh this is so delicious. I think Sloppy Joes is one of those recipes that you either like or you hate. It is so nice to be able to make this from scratch. We've made this a few times already and we all love it. My 6 year old rolls her eyes and claims she is in heaven! All from a Sloppy Joe sandwich? Okay- whatever makes ya happy!

I'm sure this recipe tastes great to kids but this is not like what I had as a kid.  This was entirely too sweet for my taste.  I added a teaspoon of vinegar to offset the sweetness a little but it was still a little too sweet.  I may try the worchesire sauce next time and cut back on the sugar.

I've never had sloppy joes before and I loved it!  I actually didn't have any buns so I served it over rice.  I omitted the grean pepper and used fresh garlic.  I couldn't wait for the leftovers for lunch the next day.

All in all my family and I were not fans. Between the ketchup and the brown sugar, it was just too sweet! It felt like I was eating some sort of meaty dessert. We do plan on giving it another try substituting tomato paste and half a can (measured from the tomato paste can) of water and eliminating the brown sugar all together. In addition to that, having the crunch of the bell pepper threw us off as we were eating. Perhaps by tossing in the pepper early and letting it soften we'll be able to alleviate this. It's a good recipe, gives me a launching point for creating sloppy joes, but not a recipe I am going to be adding to my collection over all.

Wow! These were great Sloppy Joes. Everyone in the house is fat and happy after this meal. The only changes I made was to use dried onions instead of fresh onion because I didn't have any fresh on hand. Delicious! I will make again and again.

didn't realize that a second review would erase my first one, so this one will sum up both of my previous ones. I doubled the ingredients for the sauce(garlic powder, mustard, ketchup, b sugar). I had to sub red bell for green bell. I added 1tsp worchestershire, 2tsp white vinegar, and a can of tomato paste. I used a nonstick pot and didn't have any issue with sticking, even after simmering down for an hour. I like them thick enough to stand up on the bun, and these were perfect. This is a very sweet recipe, so next time I will probably not double the brown sugar and might experiment with less ketchup and more tomato sauce or paste. Also, I am going to toy with using the crock-pot, though I am weary of sticking. I think ground Bison would be good in this too. All in all, a definite keeper.

I don't rate recipes that I alter to my liking, it's not fair to the original poster. I follow the recipe to the exact and then rate it... my family thought this was pretty good, and I liked that it was simple to do. Although next time, I might cut  down the brown sugar as it was a bit sweet for my liking, other than that, I will make again.

I thought I hated sloppy joes because I always used the canned stuff for the kids, but when I came across this, I had to try it.  I love them now.  This is a really great tasting and easy to make recipe! The only thing I did differently was add fresh instead of powdered garlic. Thanks.

I grew up on Manwich and never again will I eat that! This recipe is by far superior! Since I didn't have buns I used sourdough bread and served it open face with cheese on top.  This is one of hubby's new favorite meals.

This was pretty good and full of flavor.  My 4 year old son even ate it and he's picky.  My husband wouldn't touch it, but that's a different story.  I will most likely make this again.

I made the recipe exactly as written - as one should when reviewing a recipe.  However, when hubby and I taste tested the finished product we didn't like it at all.  Way too sweet and ketchupy.  We ended up 'doctoring' the meat mixture with chopped jalapenos, more onion and green pepper, more garlic powder and a bit more mustard.  It was better but still too sweet for our tastes.  I think this recipe is better suited to the tastes of kids and young adults.  Thanks for posting the recipe, though!  Hadn't had a sloppy joe in at least 20 years!

This recipe was great - changes I made were that I added only about 2/3 cup ketchup and 2 tbsp of the brown sugar and it was the right level of sweetness for our family; I also used red bell pepper instead of green.  Based on another review, I also added the 1/2 cup water & 1 tbsp quick oats.  We all loved this recipe, even my two year old who are it with noodles instead.  It tasted exactly the way I remember it growing up. In the future, I might add a bit more chopped bell pepper and more oats to add to the nutrition since you could not tell they were in the mix.  We will definitely make this one again!

Delicious!  I even short cutted fairly significantly.  I browned the ground beef with some red bell pepper and dried minced onion.  I drained the fat and eye-balled the addition of ketchup, mustard, brown sugar, garlic powder and s+p, adding more brown sugar than the recipe called for.  I stirred until heated through (didn't simmer for 30 minutes as directed).  It was a yummy and quick lunch. A keeper!

Thank's Tamara, this is the best sloppy joe I'v ever had. I won't change a thing. But I like spicey, So I am going to try chili sauce in place of ketchup. This recipe is GREAT!

Great basic recipe.  My only suggestion is to double the sauce like other reviewers have stated.  It would have been very dry had I not doubled it.  I got rave reviews from 4 grown men and my 2 1/2 year old!!

I love this recipe because I always have these ingredients in the kitchen and its so easy!  I did change it according to other reviewers' suggestions: I doubled the meat and more than doubled the sauce. We don't like bell peppers so I omitted them. I used an entire small yellow onion, and substituted about 1/4 of the ketchup with BBQ sauce- which was a little sweet so I left out the brown sugar.  I ended up adding a little water, all told maybe about 1/2 cup or so, as well as 3-4 tsp apple cider vinegar and 1 baby can of tomato paste. This made a huge amount of very nice, very sloppy joe's!  I also took another person's suggestion and froze servings in a muffin tin to be used up later- great idea!!  I will always double this and will never have to buy the mix again!  Thank You!  Giving 4 stars just cuz I did change it from the original

Delicious!!! My husband likes his a little sweeter, so I added some extra brown sugar the first time we made it. The second, I didn't add it and he thought it was just as good! I may have to try adding the BBQ sauce like another reviewer recommended. Sounds amazing! Also adding cheese and broiling also offers a great, finger-licking eatability (yeah... its a word now)!! Thanks SO much Tamara for this. :)

I made this for my son's first birthday party, and everyone loved it! My husband won't let me buy Manwich (he thinks it's gross), so I had to find an alternative. This was delicious and super easy to make! I will definitely make it often for our family dinner. Thanks for the recipe, Tamara!

I used a can of tomato paste to thicken things up a bit and also used some general "Italian blend seasoning" came out better than the type in a can.

This recipe is fantastic!  I didn't have bell pepper on hand so I didn't use it but I can imagine it would make the mixture even better -- and that is hard to imagine.  Husband LOVED it!

This recipe is the best sloppy joe recipe I've ever tried.  My family and I have had this recipe twice and it is a really great recipe.  I think everyone would love this recipe.  I used onion powder instead of onion because my children don't like onions, but it works good.  Thanks for the recipe.

Absolute best sloppy joe recipe. My family couldn't get enough off these! I didn't add the green pepper because i didn't have one, but its perfect w/out the pepper as well. I'll never make my old version of sloppy joes again.

I had lost this recipe, and was so glad to find it on here!  You simply can't mess it up!  I typically leave out the green pepper and use onion powder when browing the beef.  I also like to add a few splashes Frank's Red Hot Sauce to give the meat an slight "kick".  The only negative thing I can think of is that my house smells like Sloppy Joes for days after I make this recipe!  LOL!  Thankfully, I love it too much to care!  :)

Very easy and delicious.  Definately going to be one of my cheap and easy meal staples.  One of the few dishes my fiance loves.  I highly reccomend adding hamburger style sliced pickles, it really compliments the flavor.

I couldn't believe how amazing this recipe was. It tasted exactly like the canned stuffed but felt like it was made with love. I didnt add the brown sugar and it was still perfect. Definetly will be putting into the weeknight rotation.

Very good basic sloppy joe recipe! Like previous reader, I added a mixture of BBQ sauce and ketchup. Will never buy canned sauce again

I made this recipe last night for dinner, it was delicious! The sauce is excellent. I drained the meat before adding the other ingredients. And only stirred it on the stove for about 10 minutes instead of letting it simmer for 30 minutes. This is the BEST sloppy joe recipe I have eaten, definitely a Keeper!

My husband loved it.  We both hadn't had sloppy joes in years and this was a good, easy dinner.  I made the following changes: I doubled the sauce as others suggested, it's really a must if you want SLOPPY joes.  I also added a tablespoon of minced garlic and about 4-6 ounces of tomato paste.  I didn't have brown sugar so I added 1/4 cup barbeque sauce that had brown sugar in it.  I served it with corn on the cob on the side.

Perfect! This is the way my mom always made them and it just doesn't get any better. My husband had never had "real" sloppy joes and is now addicted to them.

This was a bit too sweet and needed something tangy to balance out the sweetness.  Next time, I'll decrease the brown sugar and try adding a bit of Worchestershire.  As written, the recipe provides about 6 sandwiches, but certainly doesn't feed 6 adults and teens.

Love this recipe, it’s our “go to” sloppy joe recipe. I make the recipe exactly as stated (times 4 usually) and adjust seasonings at the very end if needed. It’s perfect as is but easy to alter for personal tastes, too. We like a little oregano and red pepper flakes in ours.

The is the best sloppy joe recipes ever.  It was so easy to make.  I paired it up with some super cheesy mac n' cheese and greenbeans.  My very picky four year old said, "This is the best dinner ever.  Oh thank you Mommy.  I love it".  I have to agree with him.  I couldn't stop picking out of the pan while it was cooking.

Excellent!  I used ground turkey meat instead of ground beef b/c that is what I had on hand.  Also, used 2 cloves of garlic instead of garlic powder and a tsp of dry mustard powder and skipped the green bell peppers (no fans in this house).  Really good.  Agree that 20 min. simmer was enough. Add water/ketchup if you want it a little moister.

Pretty good. I made them at home once and then made them camping. Since you cannot simmer things on a camp stove (only one setting for heat: HOT), after browning the meat and adding the rest of the ingredients I allowed it to cook for 4 or 5 minutes. Constantly stirring so it wouldn't burn. Still turned out great. They were eaten by the camp fire with fire roasted corn on the comb. YUM!

Really great recipe.  I live abroad so I've had to find out how to make things from scratch, and all these ingredients I can get here- and it's better than the can! I only add peppers if I have them in the fridge, and I add worcestershire sauce to give it more of a barbeque taste.  Delicious!

Unbelievably good!  Followed the recipe except I omitted the green peppers.  Will never make any other Sloppy Joe recipe.  I made it for my daughter's birthday party, and everyone loved it.  My husband asks for it frequently, too.  Great recipe as is.

This recipe ROCKS! I have to admit that I was a little worried with the amount of ketchup that the recipe calls for, but it turned out SO good! Its so easy to make and I love using fresh peppers and onions. I will never go back to Manwich again! Thanks for the great recipe! It will be used many times in our family!

I made this recipe as directed and for me, it was way too sweet. I would maybe try 1 tablespoon of sugar and add the others to taste. It was also a little bland as well, missing that extra "oomph". I added some A-1 and played with it until I gave up. It seems like it's almost there but not quite, which is why i gave it a 3. I looked at some other recipes and would probably add the vinegar & worstershire next time.

Another great recipe I've found on this site. I did change slightly, I added 1/4 cup bbq sauce as someone else suggested and cut ketchup down to 1/2 cup. PICKY HUSBAND gobbled it all up and gladly took the leftovers for lunch = ) THANKS!
UPDATE: I still make this about twice a month, the same way mentioned above, and my husband still loves it. So easy,cheap,and good. Thanks again for sharing

This is so very close to the can that I really can't tell the difference. The only thing I may do differently next time is add just a touch less sugar.. but it was great! Hubby went back for seconds!

These are so great we make them almost once a week.  We do substitute ground turkey for the beef to make them a little healthier and also add crushed red pepper flakes for a little heat.  Thanks!

Great sloppy joes with just the right amount of sweetness. My only addition was a small amount of allspice added in with the ketchup mixture.  I let this simmer less than 10 minutes and it was perfect.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Love these! I get rid of green peppers all together, my hubby and I dont like them! I add cayenne pepper for some spice! I also buy fresh hamburger buns/rolls from the bakery and hole out the bottoms of them, add some fat free cheese to the bottom and put the meat on top and a little more cheese and top of that and bake them!! Sooo yummy!! It's a meal in itself. I also substitute extra lean turkey meat for a healthier choice!

This is a Five star! The first time I made it as written and it was delicious! The second time I added my own twist throwing in a dash of Tony's creole seasoning, some Worchestershire sauce, and about two tablespoons of A1 and YOWZA! It was deicious. My husband had grown up on Manwich and now says he never wants it again!

Can't go wrong with this recipe! I used ground turkey, which I browned with minced garlic, worchestershire sauce, and double the onion and green pepper. I had almost 1.5lbs of turkey so I also doubled the sauce, which was the perfect amount! Served open faced on kaiser rolls with a slice of fat free american cheese melted on top. YUM

Very Good!  I read the rest of the feedback and some of the reviews suggested adding only 1/2 Cup of ketchup and 1/4 Cup of BBQ Sauce.  I cooked the recipe as is with 3/4 cup of ketchup and added one tablespoon of BBQ Sauce at the end after tasting the recipe cooked following the exact recipe.  I believe this is the way to go!

I followed a couple other reviews and used 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup BBQ sauce. I also didn't use any brown sugar but the sauce still seemed a little too sweet so I added a splash of lemon juice which worked perfectly. The taste of the BBQ sauce still seemed overbearing at first, but after simmering for a little while it was just fine. We used either ground chicken or turkey (I don't remember which) and the sandwiches were excellent. Thanks for the recipe and suggestions - we'll definitely have this again.

It is hard to believe how easy this recipe is. If you do decide to follow some of the suggestions mentioned and add BBQ sauce instead of ketchup, don't add the sugar. We added BBQ sauce and the sugar and it was a little too much on the sweet side. I prefer 1 part BBQ to 1 part ketchup.

I love this recipe!  It has a lovely, sweet/tangy flavour.  My husband does not like onion or green peppers, so I skipped the peppers and added 1/2 tsp onion powder to the sauce instead.  For the sauce, I did added 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup BBQ sauce as some suggested.  Although the recipe yeilds 6 servings, we had 4 people eating and small buns.  We were able to get 6 servings, but they were not piled, generous servings, so seconds were not available for everyone.  I will double it next time for feeding more than 3 people.  Excellent recipe!  Never buying the canned stuff again!

You can't miss with this basic recipe. I did however reduce the brown sugar. My husband doesn't care for too much sweetness in a meat dish. I usually add a bit more mustard than directed as it always gives Sloppy Joes a bit more zest.

This was so good! My husband loves sloppy Joes, and he said it was the best he's ever had.  I made extra sauce because I read the reviews first, and I'm glad I did because it was the perfect amount.

I have always made my sloppy joes almost the same way.  I use fresh garlic, lots.  I also add about 2tbs of chili powder or to taste and paprika to taste.  I don't add salt because of the ketchup.  Best served on a toasted bun.  We like our open faced piled high.

I tried it with ground turkey and it wasn't as good as I'd hoped. Next time I will use extra lean ground beef instead. I left out the mustard because we didn't have any on hand and the flavor was still good.

This dish was really easy to make. It wasn't too saucy or messy. I added a little bit of bbq sauce and that changed the flavor too much. Next time I'll stick with the recipe more.

This is far and away the VERY BEST sloppy joe recipe I have ever made. If I could I would give it 10 stars. SUPERB!!! I increased the onion and green bell peppers to 1/2 cup each and use 1/4 tsp each of salt and pepper.

Great tasting sloppy joes!  I was going to make Manwiches but had no can of Manwich. I did, however, have the ingredients for this recipe (except the green pepper).  I made as directed and put it in the crockpot to meld until eating time.  Yum!

This was a great weeknight meal! I did double the sauce as some other reviews suggested, and I snuck in some veggies too. I shredded a carrot and a zuccini for some extra nutrition, you couldn't even taste them. I also added a squirt of BBQ sauce. I will never buy the canned stuff again!

Great recipe. Will never by manwich again. I followed the ingredients exactly and added a tsp of worchesire and i added some chopped jalapenos for an extra kick. it turned out wonderful. i did not simmer, after adding the sauce to the ground beef i just cooked it on med-low until it was warm which was only about 10 mins. cant wait to make it again!

these are probably some of the best sloppy joes ive had.  i leave out the green peppers because peppers are nasty, i add about 1/2 tsp worchestershire sauce... everything else i leave as is.  hubby really enjoys them too, hes never had a sloppy joe before (australian) and i cant get the canned stuff here, but even when i get back to the states i doubt ill buy manwich anymore.  home made is much better.

Great recipe! Much like my Grandma's..  added a lil' extra ketchup and mustard, plus a tad bit of garlic salt (didn't have any garlic cloves) to the cooking beef, onions and peppers.  Also added a tsp of Worcestershire sauce.  sooooo good!  Not too shabby for a quick din din!  :o)

i did not like this at all....and i made it just like it was written and it just tasted like a bunch of meat with ketchup on it....not tasty at all and didn't taste anything like the sloppy joes that i am used to. i will just stick with the mix from now on....i guess i just have to live with not making everything from scratch.

This was an excellent recipe, I made it as written first. The only thing I changed the second time was purely a personal thing. I like things a touch spicy so 1 tsp cayenne pepper got tossed in. I also felt that the sugar was tasty but a little much, again for my personal taste, so I cut it down to a single tablespoon. It was a wonderful recipe and with two minor changes its now perfect for me.  I can see this being an incredible hit with kids as is. Its an excellent replacement for a sodium laden can of Manwich, that you can do in literally the same amount of time.

I thought I had green peppers but realized that I didn't. It still tasted very good. I added some minced garlic since I didn't have green pepper.

I'm sure these are even better with the ground beef, but in the interest of better health I used extra lean ground turkey breast. I ran out of ketchup, so I ended up using about 1/4 cup BBQ sauce and throwing in two spoonfuls of mild salsa. It was delicious!

This is a great Sloppy Joe recipe.  Much better than using the canned stuff.  I had to add an additional 1/4 cup ketchup and a dash of extra garlic powder to the meat.  Before adding the additional ketchup, the meat looked like it would be too dry.  The end result was very tasty!

I love this recipe! Sloppy Joes was one of my favorite foods when I was a kid, [of course my mom used Manwich,which is not available where I live :@)] and I'm so glad that now I can make it with basic ingredients that I always have on hand. This recipe is really great and simple to make. I've made it using both ground beef and ground turkey,and I always double the sauce. Thanks for a great recipe!

I like the ease of this recipe, and I like the fact that I had all ingredients on hand. However, I think this recipe is WAY too sweet, so next time I will be adding just 1 tsp of brown sugar.

Very good sloppy joes. I substituted one tsp of brown sugar for a tbsp of Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce. I also added fresh garlic with the onion and green pepper instead of garlic salt. They came together very well.

THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!!  I have made this recipe on numerous occasions and always a hit the crowd.  Actually everyone I've made them for agrees that they are the best.  The only thing I did different was that I used 1/2 cup of onion and 1/2 of green pepper because they cook down quite a bit and wanted more flavor and texture.  I also added a good dash of worcestershire but not necessary but a great add in my opinion.  I also tried this recipe yesterday with a dash of some good Kentucky Bourbon.  Added an awesome kick.  THANK YOU for posting this recipe!!!

Great, easy recipe, made with ingredients I always have on hand.  I even made this with frozen meat.  Boiled frozen meat in with 3 cups of water, scraped the meat as it thawed.  Once the meat was fully thawed, I added in the other ingredients (skipping the pepper because of my husband's preferences).  Cooked the same after that.  My family wants this recipe to go into our monthly rotation, so that's high praise indeed!

I wanted an easy meal using hamburger and this worked. I'm not a big fan of these sandwiches but if I have a good recipe, I can eat them. Everyone in the family ate them and they were really good. I followed the recipe and toasted the buns. Which makes it much better! I think this is the best Sloppy Joe recipe ever. I will make again.

I thought this recipe was great.  I was afraid I had added too much mustard, because it smelled quite mustard-y while simmering, but once it was put together it was very good (I still might half the mustard next time; it goes a long way).  I was low on ketchup, so I added 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup BBQ sauce and it was quite tasty.  Great, simple recipe for a weeknight.  Also a good jumping-off point if you like to experiment.  Try it open-face with paper-thin slices of sharp cheddar and red onion on top.

I have not had a Sloppy Joe in years and I guess I was in the mood.  I used a red pepper instead of green and decreased the brown sugar to 1 Tbls. A couple shots of hot sauce and served with fries.  Good, I will make again.

This recipe is a godsend! It's so easy and it tastes identical to Manwich. I vowe to never buy sloppy joe seasoning again! My husband even put his stamp of approval on it. I didn't have any green pepper the first time I made it and it still tasted incredible. Thanks Tamara!!

Ok, this was close...but no cigar.  It was tasty, but not quite sloppy joe flavor IMHO.  It wasn't sloppy enough either (not enough sauce).  I used 1/4 t. salt and 1/2 t. black pepper.

Great recipe!  I added 1 tbsp worchestershire sauce and reduced the sugar to just 1/2 tbsp white sugar.  Great and easy!  Kids ate it with onions and bell pepper because I diced them very small and they couldn't see them!

YUMMY! I did make two alterations though. I knew the sloppy joes would be a little sweet for our taste so I omitted the brown sugar and added a few shakes of Tabasco Chipotle sauce. FANTASTIC!

So simple and so yummy.   I made this for my 9yr old picky eater son and he loved it! I followed the recipe except that I omitted the bell pepper because no one in the family like them.  The first night my son ate on a bun but the second night we just dipped tortilla corn chips into the meat mixture and now is a kid favorite!

For a family of 3 adults, 3 kids, I doubled the original recipe, added 1 Tbsp of Worcestershire, left out the green peppers, and added 1/2 small can of tomato paste to make it a bit thicker. I served over homemade honey wheat rolls (on this site). We used to use the dried mix and never will again. Wow! This was perfect though it seemed way too easy. A new family favorite for a picky picky family. Have about 1-2 servings left over for lunch tomorrow.

This recipe was really good!  I did add a sprinkle or two of Worcestershire sauce but I think it would have been fine with out it. I also found that I needed to add a bit more ketchup and a little water to give it more a "sloppy" texture, but overall it was great and I will use it again.

The boyfriend didn't know I was making these "from scratch" until he saw me adding the ketchup to the pan.  Gave him a sample bite, and he was hooked!  Did exactly as the recipe called for and was wowed with the results.  Both of us thought it was better than the canned stuff.  Just a touch sweeter than what I'm used to, but absolutely delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

I left out the green pepper and didn't bother simmering for 30 minutes.  Once it was all mixed up and warmed through I went ahead and served it on honey wheat rolls off this site.  Wonderful and fast!

My hubby and I love this recipe.  Surprisingly, the bell pepper seems to be a key feature in the finished result.  I skipped it the first time (I didn't have any) but after cooking it again with the bell pepper, I realized what a difference it made.  I also sub'd bbq sauce for part of the ketchup.  Fantastic, simple, homey recipe.

Excellent recipe- very fresh-tasting! I did a large amount for a big get together and used 3lbs of meat: 1lb. of lean beef, 1lb. of ground turkey and 1lb. of ground sausage (italian sausage- really adds a lift to it!)

I made this as written the first time and it was a little dry and sweet.  Second time?  I used a full cup of ketchup but it was half Balsamic Ketchup and half BBQ sauce.  I added fresh garlic when browning the meat and then a healthy splash of vinegar when I added the other ingredients.  The vinegar adds that Sloppy Joe 'tang' and takes away some of the sweetness at the same time.  It was perfect and a keeper.

Yummy!  I ended up throwing everything in a crock pot once I browned the meat, green pepper and onion.  I did add some cheese to the mixture and left in the crock pot on low for three hours....delicious!

This recipe saved a meal that I was about to throw out!!  I made sloppy joes last night from a recipe in my well known red/white checked cookbook... they were bland and flavorless.  Since this recipe shared many of the ingredients from that recipe I decided to go ahead and add the remaining ingredients that the other recipe didn't have... ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar.  The difference was unbelievable!  I will never try another sloppy joe recipe again.  Actually, I only made sloppy joes because everyone else likes them... I have always hated them.  Not anymore!!  If I could give this more than 5 stars I definitely would!

I loved this recipe!  I haven't had sloppy joe's in years, but I will definitely be adding this to my easy go to meal list!  

I did make some modifications to the recipe based on what I had in the kitchen and a some of the suggestions here.  Instead of ground beef I used ground chicken (I know, I know, but it is all I had).  It worked fabulously!  

I also scaled down the recipe to make it for one.  I used about 1/4 an onion and 1/4 of a green bell pepper, and 2 tbsp. of ketchup with 1 tbsp. of bbq sauce and 1 tbsp. of water and a little extra mustard.  I followed the rest of the directions exactly (scaled down of course) and thought my joe was perfectly sloppy and delicious! 

Also ate in on two slices of potato bread, which I highly recommend,

This was awesome - A big hit!

Modified the recipe a little per some of the feedback received:  doubled the recipe and added an extra tablespoon of Sugar; 2 T of Apple Cider Vinegar; 1 T Worshire sauce; dash of steak dust (I was looking for some Hickory Mesquite flavoring but didnt' have any); and extra water to simmer with.  It was awesome! Definitely a keeper.

I followed another reviewer's suggestion and doubled the sauce and I also substituted half the ketchup for barbeque sauce. I also added a little bit of water to help keep it from being too dry. This was great!

Was a big hit with the family, even my middle one loved it and she is a very picky eater. I may reduce the brown sugar though it was a bit to sweet for our tast.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!!! I normally do the old Manwich trick for Sloppy Joes but I didn't have any on hand and had the stuff to try this recipe.  As I was preparing it, I thought "wow, what a mess I've made here" - wondered if it would have been easier to have gone to the store to get the Manwich but then we tasted it.....Oh my!  It was 1000 times better - absolutely delicious...we fought over the leftovers!

I bought my Manwich for my ground meat.  This recipe has been sitting in my recipe box, since August. I decided to try it.  The can of Manwich went back into my  food closet. I'll donate it. The Sloppy Joe 11 was so good, My husband say make it this way from now on. Teriffic.

As someone else suggested, instead of 3/4 cup of ketchup, I used 1/2 cup of barbecue sauce and 1/4 cup of ketchup, plus a little bit of celery salt, and it was fantastic. I'm not a regular sloppy joe eater, but on a kaiser roll, this recipe might change that. If you like your vegetables softer like I do, you might consider sauteeing the onions and green peppers before you add the beef to brown.

I am not sure Ive ever had Sloppy Joes before this so it's hard for me to compare this to Manwich or another homemade version.  Still DBF and I thought this was very very tasty when prepared pretty much as written.  I used 1/2 green pepper and 1/2 onion (which probably ended up being more vegetables than was originally called for).  I tasted before adding the sugar and found it to taste fairly sweet, but recklessly charged forth and added the sugar anyway. It was good - so good that DBF ate two and would have had a third(!) if I hadn't stopped him.  I asked him if it reminded him of hamburgers (which we had last night) and he said BETTER!

Our family loves this recipe.  I leave out the peppers and onion (to make it kid friendly).  To add back in the onion, I use a tablespoon of onion powder during the meat browning step.  Rarely any leftovers.

I made this recipe when my family came out for a visit.  Although I made enough for everyone, it disappeared quickly.  The only changes I made was to use red bell peppers instead of the green, and I put in a clove of garlic instead of the powder.  This is a winner.

Although this recipe far surpasses the premade canned kind, it was a little too sweet. Next time I'll probably use tomato sauce over the ketchup to tone down the sugar count more.

My family LOVED this... I love mustard, so I doubled the mustard and added a bit more ketchup to make it a bit more sloppy.  

Such a simple but great recipe!  Never again will I buy Manwich!

This was a very easy to make recipe.  I used lean ground turkey instead of beef.  I used 1/8 cup of fresh bell peppers and 1/8 of tomatoes from my garden. Also I cut the brown sugar down to 1 T. I will make again for sure. Thanks.

So easy to put together. Only thing I omitted was the green pepper, everything else i had on hand. I would probably use only 2 tbsp brown sugar next time, it was a little too sweet for my liking.

Later Manwich!  I'll never buy it again.  This was delicious!  I used 1.5# meat and doubled the other ingredients (except used the original amount of brown sugar). I also squirted in some Baby Ray's bbq sauce and a bit of water to help it simmer.  This was sooo tasty.  My whole family enjoyed.  Thanks!

SOOOO good and EASY, I made this in about 20 minutes.  Beats Rachael Ray 30 minute meals!  I didn't have prepared mustard, so I used regular mustard, and I used tomatoe sauce, since I ran out of ketchup.  My four kids loved it (and they are picky) and my husband loved it.

I've never been a big fan of sloppy joes, but my family loves them.  This recipe changed my opinion.  They were great!  Next time I'll probably reduce the sugar a little and maybe add some Worcestershire for a little kick.  I did end up adding a small amount of water (about 1/4cup) as it simmered in order to make them a little more saucy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Meh.  Needed "something". Was certainly not bad, but probably will not make again.

Great recipe! We omitted green pepper as I don't care for it, but tastes really good without.  This is a nice easy base sloppy joe recipe that can be catered to suit your tastes.

These are SOOOOO Good!!  I was browsing through Allrecipes one day trying to get some inspiration for dinner and found this recipe.  I usually use Manwich when I make sloppy joes, but as some of the other reviewers stated - No More!  I used 1/2 cup of the frozen onion and pepper blend just because that's more convenient for me.  That worked out really well.  I also added a tad of stock because the mixture was so thick that I was afraid it wouldn't be able to simmer - it was perfect.  My daughter turned up her nose as usual, but then just started smiling when she took her first bite!!

My husband simply adores sloppy joes but I've always made them with the sloppy joe packet.  When I tried this recipe, my husband flipped.  He thought these sloppy joes were the best he's even eaten.  I will no longer buy the small packets to make them.  When he's in the mood, I will always use this recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Perfect and looked EXACTLY like the picture (which doesn't happen often).  I did add 1/2 cup of water with sauce and substituted 1/4 cup of Ketchup for BBQ sauce.  My husband LOVED it!

These were very good.  However,  I didn't add any sugar, and they were still very sweet.  I added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce to cut through the sweetness.  Very tasty, definately a keeper.

I made these using tofu.  I grew up with Manwich stuff from a can, but this is much easier to make, and I had all the stuff already on hand.  I halved the recipe since I didn't have a full pound of tofu, and added some small-diced zucchini ('til the season so I'm trying to get rid of it!).  I couldn't wait the 30 minutes for it to simmer, so I just ate it as soon as it was warmed through, with dill pickle stackers on top.  SOO yum and a new favorite, easy recipe :)

My whole family really liked this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly. Just as easy as making Manwich but tastes so much better. I'll be making these often, but from now on I'll double the recipe.

This was a great hit with the family.  I did make a few adjustments to the recipe...I did think it was a little on the sweet side, so I added a dash or two of worcestershire sauce and about two teaspoons chili powder.  That helped a lot. Next time I will cut the brown sugar in half.  My teenagers requested I make this at least once a week.

This was delicious!  I made it as written, but next time I will take Amerette's advice and double the sauce, as I thought it would be even better if it was juicier.

Instant classic! So good and I hated sloppy joes growing up. Easy to wing too if you aren't one for exact measurements. 

I also made a batch with veggie ground round for my veggie wife and she loved it too. My 1 year old loved the meat version as much as I did.

Prepared this recipe with the following changes: I used some frozen peppers and onions to save prep time. I also ran out of ketchup, so ended up using 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 barbecue sauce. The combination of the brown sugar, ketchup and peppers is super-yummy... reminds me of a delicious recipe on here that I found for "Brown Sugar Meat Loaf." You must try these sloppy joes... so easy, fast and so yummy! My 2 year old and husband also give this recipe a thumbs-up!  Thanks so much!

I made these for dinner last night and my husband who normally eats like a bird ate 5 of them!  I had between a pound and pound and a half of meat, so I guesstimated adding more ketchup, mustard and brown sugar to get these to the right consistency.  I also added about a tablespoon Worcestershire sauce as it seemed to need more liquid.  I think next time I may try doubling the recipe and leaving this in the crock pot all day.  Manwich, eat your heart out!  These are so good and easy I will definitely be making them again and from the family's reaction I'm certain it'll be requested soon.

Wow, this is way better than the canned Sloppy Joe stuff. My husband loved it. I think he ate atleast 3. I added about a TBSP od chipotle BBQ sauce just because my husband loves the stuff. I also put a peice of cheese under the top bun. It gets nice and melty. I hate green bells for some reason so I finely chop up mini red, yellow and orange bells instead. I was asked by the kids to add this recipe to our dinner menu on a regular basis. A real keeper. Thanks so much for sharing this one.

Not that this needs another great review- but YUM!  I used ground turkey and a red pepper- followed the recipe exactly from there- used 'lite' rolls- loaded it up with dill pickles (luv 'em on sandwiches!!!) and was in sloppy joe heaven!  I hated sloppy joes when I was little- but I didn't know they could taste this good!  Thanks!! YUM!!

Big fat YUM!! I used half tomato sauce and half ketchup to cut back on the sweetness, threw in a glug of worcestershire as others had suggested. I didn't have green peppers but I had these hot banana peppers so I diced some of those and threw them in. Served up on a whole wheat bun with onions and dill pickles. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would, this is just so simple, tasty, and not bad on the calorie count. A winner for sure!

Really good. I added a little water the second time I made these because I thought they were a bit dry. And reduced the sugar a bit. Just a tad too sweet for our taste. But overall, very good flavor.  Thanks!

These were pretty good! I made a bigger batch than called for, and made more sauce than called for, as we like them juicy. I also added worcestershire sauce. I served on homemade buns, and topped with onions & dill pickles. I also mixed in diced jalapenos to mine & my husbands joe's, as we like a bit of a kick. These are definitely worth making again. Thanks for sharing!

I used half ketchup and half barbecue sauce and it turned out delicious!  DH ate almost a whole pound of beef in one sitting with this one.  I'll make it again, but sparingly.

This was pretty good. I kinda just eyeballed the measurements and kept adding and stirring until I got what I wanted. Great starting place. Thank you for the recipe!

I made this with no green peppers and I was a little short on ketchup, so they weren't that 'sloppy'. EXCELLENT!!!

I used vegetarian burger crumbles instead of beef, substituted barbecue sauce for 1/4 cup of the ketchup, and omitted the brown sugar. This is a wonderful and very easy meal, and the leftovers reheat well.

Very Good Basic recipe and sure beats a can of Manwich. The nice thing about this recipe is you can add any additional
items to give it more punch and even more flavor. Thanks for Sharing. PS it has been awhile since I made this...this rolls to the top. Again a great basic recipe...  the brown sugar is the secret in the recipe. Thank you again.

Good basic recipe. This is the first time I've ever made sloppy joes, and I liked them! I'll probably try other recipes to see if we find one we like more...but thanks for the recipe!

I have always hated sloppy joes but hubby likes them so i reluctantly agreed to try them using this recipe. I now love sloppy joes! I don't eat beef and my husband doesn't like gr. turkey so i made these with gr. pork, which makes a great alternative for lots of dishes. I added fresh garlic and a few red pepper flakes.  sooo good

This is the best sloppy joe I've had since my grandma made them for me when I was little! Next time I'll probably skip the mustard as I never have liked it, and I could taste it through the sauce(even though there is nearly none in here). No more Manwich in my household...we're eating this from now on!

This is basically the same recipe my mom and I have been using for years.  Absolutely the best.  I can't eat any other kind of sloppy joes.  I never measure when making them.  Can be made with just ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar just as well.

My husband is UNBELIEVABLY a pain in the butt with anything new I try.  He grew up on the powdered mix stuff.  He actually ASKED me to make this again.  This is monumental, because he usually tells me whatever I make is fine.  If I can please his pallete with this recipe (and I have tried hundreds from here) this should go on anyones top shelf!  I always say I am going to review recipes, and never do, but this one HAD to get the review.  THANK YOU!!!

This was my first time making sloppy joes so I wanted an easy and quick recipe.  This was perfect!  I followed the recipe but put in a little less brown sugar (2 tsp) and did what others did by mixing BBQ sauce with the ketchup.  Instead of cooking it in a pan on the stove I did what another cook did and that was brown the meat then throw everything in a crock pot for 3 hours.  It came out great!  My fiance loved it!

The only reason that this is not a 5* is due to the fact it wasn't 'saucy' enough. I followed someone's suggestion to use 3/4 ketchup to 1/4 BBQ sauce and it was great! Only suggestion would be to double the sauce. Great Sloppy Joes!!! Made the mistake of not following my own suggestion and did not double the sauce on this 2nd attempt.....NEXT TIME!!!

I can't believe I ever paid a dollar a can for manwich.  This is SO easy and much better, and cheaper.  My terribly picky kids even ate it.  I didn't have any green pepper and don't really like it so I just put in a bit more onion.  Easy, fast and delicious.

This was the best sloppy joe I have ever had.  I had the ingredients on hand and it was quick and easy.  I did use spicy mustard for a little more kick but the sauce to meat ratio was perfect.  My kids (2 & 4) are cleaning up thier plates.  Thanks for a winning recipe!

This was pretty good.  I did as some recommended in adding bbq sauce. But I only added 1 tbs to the sauce, and im glad that I did because it would have tasted like bbq sandwiches if i put more.  I also added a couple lil splashes of worshtishere sauce.  and a pinch of cayenne. It worked out nice.  i think next time i wont add brown sugar at all because it was a little sweet, and ketchup and bbq sauce are kind of sweet too. But will be making again!

Very good. I took another cook's advice, and I added some water to mine. Next time, I will use less brown sugar. We thought it was a little too sweet for our tastes. I will definitely make again though.

Yep... this is the stuff! I followed the recipe as stated, tripling it however. The only modification is the addition of some dashes of Worcestershire sauce. Served on whole wheat multigrain buns. Yum! Definitely making this again.

I'm tempted to go eat my third one of these. It's sweet and gooey goodness. I was too lazy to cut up an onion and just used some onion powder instead. Give me a break, I'm 37 weeks pregnant.

This was a good recipe.  I added a few dashes of crushed red pepper flakes and a little water and let it simmer down.  I will def. make this again, adding more red pepper flakes and reducing the brown sugar to half the amount suggested.

Used a little more than a lb. of lean ground beef....and it was plenty saucy. Followed instructions exactly and this was a hit at dinner! Served on soft potato rolls with store bought mac salad and cole slaw and a tossed salad. Move over manwich....I will be making this again!

I make this pretty regularly, and my picky five year-old goes nuts whenever I do! I make it pretty much as written; I use minced garlic instead of garlic powder, and usually add a dollop of molasses.

My hubby loves sloppy joes but I can never seem to remember to get that Manwich at the store so I was really happy to find this recipe.  It's made with stuff I usually have on hand and since I have to jazz up the can stuff anyway it's not much more work either.  I did add a scant tsp of Worcestershire Sauce but aside from that I followed the recipe precisely.

I thought this was a great recipe. I've always used Manwich in the past, but my husband and I liked this so much better. I changed this a little to suit our personal tastes: added BBQ sauce in place of part of the ketchup, used extra garlic powder and some Wortchestershire Sauce for more of a kick, and did extra of all the wet ingredients to make more sauce. After it was all cooked through, I put it in the crockpot for a few hours to let the flavors meld together more. It was delicious!

I added about 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce... I also added 1/2 cup of water and 1 Tbsp of quick oats (to thicken it) and simmered it down, like someone else suggested... I loved them!... will definitely make these again!

This is a GREAT sloppy joe recipe. I used to just make mine with ketchup/mustard/chili powder. I now only make this recipe whenever my husband requests sloppy joes. I am not a fan of sloppy joes, but I LOVE these! It just has a great flavor to them and soo cheap to make especially with the high grocery prices. Thanks for the great recipe, we had it for the second time tonight! :)

I hate to give such a bad rating, but the proportions in this recipe don't seem right at all. There was not nearly enough sauce for 1 pound of meat, it should be doubled or maybe even tripled.  Also to simmer it for 30 minutes would have been way too long.  I followed the recipe, then when I saw that it wasn't enough sauce I had already run out of ketchup so I had to add water, then I only simmered it for about 10 minutes.  It still tasted pretty good, don't get me wrong, and I will probably make it again, I will just make more sauce next time.

Absolutely the best Sloppy Joe I've ever had.  Left my taste buds dancing for joy.

Substituted some of the ketchup with BBQ sauce.  Maybe about 1:4 (BBQ/ketchup)

Edited: had again for dinner.  Swear I could eat this every day for the rest of my life...it is that good.  Oh my!!

I love this recipe!!  I've been making it for over a year now and am just now getting around to rating it.  Every time I make these I get rave reviews.  I don't change a thing - just serve on a bun with a slice of cheese.  My church often serves meals at a homeless shelter and I've made these several times - I've increased the recipe by 10 or even 15.  Always great!!!

These are really good.  After reading the reviews I did modify slightly.  I added 1/2 cup of water and 1/4 cup of chili sauce.  I did not add the brown sugar.  These have become a monthly favorite.

Very Good basic sloppy joe recipe. My family loves it! They are very picky and when I can make something they all love and ask me to make again it deserves 5 plus stars! I did cut down a little on the brown sugar and it was perfect. I usually double and triple the recipe when I make it. It goes in no time.

I've been trying to make Sloppy Joes like my (late)Mom made when I was a child but just couldn't quite get it right. This is it!!! I didn't change a thing and liked the sweetness.  It was wonderful! You'll never use a can or mix again-I promise.

This is a great recipe.  Don't taste it before you let it simmer for 30 minutes.  I did and almost threw it out b/c it didn't taste good at all.  But after simmering for 30 minutes it blended well an tasted great!

Very good!  Better than the packages I used to buy, and my husband agreed with that.  I did make some little changes.  Instead of all ketchup, I add a 1/4 hp steak sauce, for a little bit of a deeper flavor.  Also I did add a few extra dried herbs and to make it not so thick, I add a little beef stock.  I think next time I will omit the brown sugar for it was a tad sweeter than needed.

Delicious!!!  Easy!!  I made this with my kids tonight for dinner and they helped chop the RED bell peppers with a Pampered Chef chopper (I made this recipe 5X so that I could freeze the other helpings in freezer bags).  3 out of 4 kids ate this.  I also made it with 1/4 c. BBQ Sauce.  This worked well and I didn't have to use Brown Sugar.  It was GREAT.  Now I have 3 more dinners in the freezer for another day!  Super easy.

I never liked sloppy joes, but I decided to give this a try due to the great reviews. I really wanted this to work, but I just didn't like it. Maybe I'll try it again and make some modifications.

Not bad, but 3 tsp. of brown sugar is way too much... the mixture turned out very sweet and were I to make these again I would add sugar to taste, not just dump teaspoonsfuls in and hope for the best. Otherwise, this was a good, simplr recipe that can easily be shaped to fit one's own tastes.

I doubled the amount of onions and peppers, and increased the rest of the ingredients to "heaping" simply because the veggie crumbles  don't really have a taste to them. Anyhow this recipe has become one of our favorites in a house of young and old.

Just made this tonight as sloppy joes were always a Halloween tradition in my family when I was growing up.  Now that I live in Northern Ireland, I thought I'd keep the tradition alive even though I'm so far away from the USA.  Prepared as written, this recipe brought back great memories of Halloween and being a kid again.  Many thanks to you!

Wonderful.  I left out the sugar & green peppers to account for my family's taste.  This recipe makes so much sense!!  What do we love on hamburgers?  Ketchup, mustard, onions, seasoned with garlic, salt & pepper.  Really good.  Definitely a keeper at our house.

I used ground turkey instead of ground beef. I also carmelized the onions and peppers in a small amount of olive oil - used a whole onion because I love onions!I had to add a little water to thin the sauce because the turkey does not give off much juice. This is a keeper!

I made this for our Halloween party but tripled it.  Everyone really liked them but I thought they were a tad too sweet...I'll cut the sugar a bit next time but good and easy!  Thanks!

This was beyond easy.  I made this for a girlie fall weekend and was the hit of the night.  I forgot to pack the brown sugar so I put in barbque sauce and a little fat free syrup, plus whorcshire sause for jaz.  Love it and making for my Halloween party.  Bye Bye Manwich!

Perfect sloppy joe recipe. This is what sloppy joes are suppose to be. Followed the recipe exactly, just doubled it and it did not last very long.

This was SO good. I usually use a packet of sloppy joe mix. Never again! My husband, who "doesn't like sloppy joes," ate three sandwiches! I am a vegetarian, so I made these with Morningstar Farms burger style crumbles. They were fantastic. Thanks for the recipe!

These were very yummy.  I had to leave out the onions and green peppers because my hubby and kids don't like them.  I also added a little BBQ sauce, a little worcestershire and a little vinegar (to cut sweetness).  Very tasty.  Next time I will add a little diced green chiles, as suggested by another reviewer, to give it some kick!!

Great recipe.  Like most kids, mine hate to eat healthy. So I hid 1/2 head of spinach in the Sloppy Joes. Cook it in with the meat and onions. They noticed something was different but the rest of the flavors made them transparent.

I just finished eating this after making it for the very 1st time. It's perfect. I added a little bbq sauce and a little vinegar just to make a little extra sauce because I had 1 1/2 of ground beef, but I'm sure the original recipe is just as good. It is sweet though, but I liked it sweet. I suppose you could just cut out the sugar if you don't like it sweet.

These were the best sloppy joes that me and my boyfriend have ever had. I made 1 1/2 x the sauce, as I found the amount called for wasn't enough, otherwise I followed the recipe perfectly. We had them on toasted hamburger buns and they tasted great!

I made this recipe for my son's 2nd birthday party. It was a hit.  Everyone loved it.  I probably added a little more brown sugar than what the recipe called for. I like the sweeter flavor.  I will not be using the can mix anymore.

Great recipe, does not make a lot. First time I had it as sloppy joes, second time used it on hot dogs. Easy to make with ingredients you already have in the pantry. I double the onions. Put this one in your recipe box!

These weren't bad, but they were definitely way too sweet. When I make these I don't put any sugar in at all and use a bit less ketchup.

Very Delicious! I substituted boca meat for the ground beef and it was absolutely delectable! I highly recommend it.  Just add a tad of Cayenne Pepper and a little salt and it is YUMMY!

I HAD to join because I wanted to leave a review for this recipe.  It was the BEST and EASY sloppy joe recipe I've encountered.  The only twist I did was use 1/2 ketchup and 1/2 chili sauce to give it that "BOLD" flavor my husband and I love.   ENJOY!!!!

These are awesome.

The reason for me to try these was because my cousin and I both hate Manwich (no taste whatsoever) and couldnt locate the "Sloppy Joe" can that we both like, so I checked here and discovered this.

The only change I made was I subsituted 1/4 of the ketchup with brown sugar bbq sauce. 

I taosted the buns using real butter too. Was excellent.

I was actually kind of worried because the ingredient list was so small, but I trusted the reviews and gave it a try.  This is the perfect, simple sloppy joe recipe.  No need to make it harder than it needs to be.  My only change was that I added about 1/2 c finely chopped carrot to the beef, onion, and bell pepper mix to add more nutrition.  Oh, I also switched the bell pepper from green to orange because I don't like green bell peppers.  This one is going in the permanent file.  Thanks!

I just made this recipe for my family and it got rave reviews.  We all loved it!!  It will definitely be our "new" Sloppy Joe recipe from now on.  The only deviation from the original recipe was that I added about 3 splashes of Worcestershire sauce, and I was out of green bell pepper.  Next time I'll try it with the pepper.  We ate it on toasted buns and it rocked!!

This is the best. I served it on toasted kaiser rolls and it was great.  My husband said he didn't like sloppy joes but he quickly changed his mind. You have to try this recipe.

Delicious!  My husband never liked sloppy joes and he thought these were awesome.  I didn't have onion, so I used minced dried onions.  I used ground turkey and used 1 part barbeque sauce/2 parts ketchup.  My incredibly picky 19 month old gobbled these up.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, this is good. My husband didn't think he liked sloppy joes until he tried this.  I make it with ground turkey and onion powder since my toddler won't touch anything with chunks of onion in it.  This is a regular on our table.

My family absolutely loved this recipe, even more than my usual Sloppy Joe recipe.  Changes I made:  I used about a pound and a half of ground meat and a red bell pepper rather than a green pepper, I also added tomato paste to make it a nice consistancy.  Interesting Note...my neice who is a very picky eater was over for supper the night I made this and she had TWO helpings.  WOW!!  I will definitely be making this again and again.  Thank you Tamara!

I tripled this recipe with 12 seven and eight year old girl scouts.  I had many comments from "yuck", and "I don't like onions", to "what is that green stuff" when we chopped the bell pepper.  To their amazment, they loved it.  It was easy and the girls ate it all up.  Two even asked for the recipe so they could make it at home.  Thanks

This was great!!  I don't think I'll ever go back to Manwich again!!!  The only changes I made was instead of 3/4c. of Ketchupo, I used 1/4c. ketchup, 1/4c. BBQ sauce and 1/4 c. of Chili sauce and used no sugar.  DELICIOUS AND EASY!!!!

I followed the advice of other reviews and added a little bbq sauce & worcestershire sauce & it gave the sauce a much more 'grown up' flavor from the canned variety...very yummy!! especially with some shredded cheddar on top. NOTE: 1lb of ground beef will NOT feed 6 people. Maybe my eaters have larger than normal appetites, but I had to run out and get an extra pound of meat to make enough for a proper 'sloppy' looking joe.

Decent. We had to increase the fluids to keep it from getting too dry, and we didn't see the point of the long simmering time (except as a tease!). It did have good flavor, and we will probably make again with a few minor adjustments for personal preference.

UPDATE: I redid this with pimento instead of green pepper and an extra tsp. brown sugar and I liked these so much better now. A keeper this way for my tastes! Thanks!
Original review: 
The family liked these fine, but I thought the green pepper flavor was too strong. The ease of prep and the availability of ingredients on hand earn this one 4 stars, but I didn't like it nearly as well as my usual recipe. A great recipe to start with though...

Best sloppy joes we ever ate!! Everyone always raves about these when I make them.  Some people even say they don't usually like sloppy joes, but they love these.  I like to make them for a make ahead meal for a casual crowd.  For my husband to love these is saying alot.

I made this last night, and it was delicious. I didn't have any green peppers, and I didn't have any fresh onion so I used dried minced onion instead, and it was still great! It was completely gone. Even my 3 & 4 year old ate it!

Such an easy recipe, I don't think I'll ever make it with a can again!! I chopped the onions and green peppers extra small, so you couldn't tell what they were, and accidently added 3 Tbs. of brown sugar instead of tsp. and it was still good. A winner!!

Wonderful! So much better than the canned variety, will never buy them again. This recipe is a keeper and I will make these over and over again with no changes to the recipe. Thanks for sharing :)

Hubby says he never wants "that stuff in a can" again!  Very tasty!!  Note to self: taste before adding brown sugar and then add as needed.  Use half ketchup and half sweet baby rays.

Great recipe! The only changes I made was to have 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup barbeque sauce, and 1/2 cup water. My husband loved it and my dog loved the leftovers.

This was good.  My five year old even decided that she like cooked green peppers.  I'm not sure that it's an "amazing" recipe, but it is much better than the canned variety and without a lot of fuss.

I used this and this was good. I cooked all this up on top of th stove and then put into a crock pot wait about an hour and this is great. 
When I am short on time I use the canned stuff with the ground beef, onion and chopped green pepper fry it up on top of the stove and then put that into a crock pot and that to is wonderful after an hour on the crock pot. The crock pot is the key...

Wow, so simple and easy to make. My daughter thought it wasn't saucy enough. My son and I thought it was just right. Matter of fact he tried to 'steal' his sister's serving by saying hers fell on the floor.  They are in their 20's and still trying to pull that. :) I wouldn't change a thing, maybe only to make more of it to have fuller sandwiches.

Thought this was pretty good.  I omitted the brown sugar and I still thought it was plenty sweet - probably from the green pepper.  It probably could stand to have the sauce doubled b/c it was more like loose meat than sloppy joes.  But the taste was great. 2/27/08 - made this again and included the brown sugar (but added less).  I am giving this five stars now.  Boyfriend really liked it - said it was better than Manwich.  I have never had Manwich but I trust his opinion. 4/22/17 - I still make this whenever I want sloppy joes.  Super easy and great.

This is the best recipie I have come across.  I made it on Saturday and already 3 people have asked me for the recipe.  I had to make a double batch and only had some cut up jalepeno peppers, so I added about 1/4 cup and it was great!

My mother makes these for Halloween night because they are an easy meal to put together, except she makes an "open faced" sloppy joe. To make it fun she takes a Kraft Single slice of cheese and cuts a face into the cheese (triangle for eyes, triange for nose, and a mouth) and then puts it on top of the sloppy joe and microwaves it for a few seconds so that it creates a face on your sloppy joe!

It was a bit too ketchup-y for my fiance and I... maybe if i used tomato paste instead of ketchup it would have helped. I think we still prefer the Lawry's Sloppy Joe packet.

This is a great recipe.  I only use about a half pound of beef because I only have to feed 2.  I have made this many times, using either green, red or yellow peppers and it is perfect.  Also, I did use 1/3 cup of ketchup this last time (usually i follow it to a T)and it still was wonderful.  I also like to add in a small can of ranch beans, like I had in the sloppy joes I ate as a kid growing up.  Our family loves this meal.  We top it with cheese.  I highly recommend this recipe, especially for families with children.

These are good, sweet but good. I made with groud turkey, I don't think it affected flavor much. Also used fresh garlic rather than garlic powder. I will make again.

Wow! Very easy and really tasty.  Better than any canned sloppy joe sauce.  I added just a little seasoned salt, worchestire and bbq sauce for more zing, but I tried some before I added the ingredients, and it was tasty with a sweet-like flavor as written, too.

Great and easy recipe, I added celery and fresh garlic. It was alittle sweet, but that was ny fault, I didn't have a green pepper so I used red. Can't wait to try it with the green.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It's not all that much different from Manwich, but it allows for more variation in the flavor.  I made the recipe as is, with the exception that I made more of the sauce.  The flavor definitely gets better as it simmers...allow for that and dont expect to cut it short.  Next time, I think I may try adding a little more "heat" to the flavoring.

Dude!  This recipe rocks!  It's super easy and fast to make, and it's delicious.  I made them for my husband's mom and grandmother and they were obsessed!  I use ground turkey instead of beef, I don't drain the juices from the meat, and I double up on all of the ingredients (except the meat), adding 2 teaspoons of worchestershire sauce.  Oh yeah, and don't add salt.  There's enough in the ketchup.  You can also use different coler bell peppers which give off a sweeter flavor. I recommend this recipe to everyone.

This recipe is spectacular.  I made it for a big crowd and tripled the recipe, and aside from the fact that my leftovers the next day were crummy because the idiot behind the stove left the stove on simmer for a number of hours and dried the meat out... it was a keeper that everyone loved!!!  ;-)  Will make again.  It was super simple, especially when using the Chop Wizard to chop the onions and peppers.

I never thought I liked sloppy joes until I tried this recipe.  Great taste and easy.  My 18 month old son devoured this and he usually won't eat meat.  The sweetness must have tricked him.  A great recipe for kids.

Very good but also very sweet. I would recommend only two tablespoons of brown sugar. Thanks for a great meal!

One could search for a long time and not find a sloppy joe recipe as good as this one. It was absolutely awesome.  Next time, as others have suggested, I will reduce the brown sugar a bit--maybe by one third or so. No doubt, the sweet flavor is part of the appeal, so we don't want to eliminate it completely; just reduce it a tad.  Beyond that, this sucker is a winner.  It deserves the blue ribbon award for sloppy joes.  I served "Rich and Creamy Tomato Basil" soup with these and it was an exceptional combination.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I have made it twice now and will make it again and again.  I will never go back to the flavor packet again.  It is easy and uses ingredients I usually have on hand.  Thank-you from me, my husband and two little boys!

This was yummy! I made a few substitutions (to use what I had on hand.) I used 1/2 c. ketchup and 1/4 c. bbq sauce (I ran out of ketchup) I also used spicy brown mustard, fresh garlic, and red bell pepper. My kids loved this as well. Thanks!

This recipe was very tasty.  I thought it was perfect.  My boyfriend wanted a sloppier joe.  He kept adding more ketchup and garlic powder to give it a bit more kick.  All in all, I will make it again but would like to find a way to make it really sloppy.

I have three teenagers, 14, 15 and 16 and a husband of 18 years.  I had already prepared 1.75 pounds of ground beef cooked with an onion and had it previously frozen, waiting for a quick week night dinner.  I simply sauted 1 garlic clove (instead of the powder) with 1/2 C green bell pepper (again, previously chopped and frozen, waiting for me.) in 1 Tablespoon of Olive Oil.  Once these were sufficiently cooked, I added my pre-cooked ground beef.  Once warmed, I added 1 cup Ketchup, 3 teaspoons brown sugar and about a 2 teaspoons of mustard, since I had increased the amount of ground beef.  My girls HATE canned & envelope Sloppy Joes mixes.  They've never liked Sloppy Joes because of those prepared mixes and my husband joined them in their dislike.  Tonight, they fell in love with Sloppy Joes!  I haven't heard the end about how great this was!  I served it with homemade Mac & Cheese and a pea salad.  Week night dinner made easy!  Thanks Tamara for a recipe that my family finally agrees on and likes!  AWESOME!!!

These were FANTASTIC ~ much better than a pre-made mix.  Cheap and easy, too.  I leave out the green pepper, and it was really good wrapped up with cheese in a tortilla and then warmed the next day.  Thanks for sharing!

This made an excellent sloppy joe.  The only complaint was from my 4 yr old, who kept complaining about how messy hers was.  I was a little concerned about ketchup and brown sugar making a good sauce, and it was great.  I will NEVER buy that canned stuff again!

Cut back a little on the brown sugar, omitted salt.  Otherwise it still turned out great.  Thanks for the post.

These were delicious! I like a little kick, so I added some habanero powder, and some chili powder. I served them on crusty buns with Ranch potato salad and baby spinach salad. Fast, easy and not too unhealthy!

What a fantastic jumping off point!!!! I made a double batch as we have a large family. I followed the original recipe ingredients but changed the brown sugar to 1 from 3 and I used a can of tomato sauce. We like alot of flavor so as it simmered I kept adding spices here and there (onion powder and garlic powder) until it was just perfect. It was thick and sloppy and my whole family devoured it! Don't be afraid to play with it until it suits your taste - its a perfect base sauce!A+++ on this one!

Very good recipe, exactly what I was looking for.  This comes very close to my late father-in-law's recipe which I don't have.  This is a keeper!  Update: I've been using Jenny-O ground turkey (NOT the white meat) and it is just as good. It's sold in 1# tubes at Walmart for $1.88 in the frozen section.

LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!  Easy and delicious!!! I've made these a couple of times and the whole family loves them!  My changes - decrease ketchup to 1/2 cup, decrease brown sugar to 1 tsp, added a can of tomato sauce for sloppier mixture, added tsp of garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika and TBSP of worcestershire as per other reviewer.  I also add a can of pork-n-beans.  I love the bean addition and it just adds to the sloppy factor!

I love this recipe!  I also add a few more ingredients to jazz it up a bit more. But very good.  I made canned sloppy joe's the other day and I just cannot do that anymore, they tasted awful!  This recipe is definately a keeper.

I tried the Sloppy Joe's last night.  Delicious flavor and plenty to go around. It seemed a little dry to me, so I added some wine from the glass I had just poured for myself (this is the way I always cook, with a glass of wine in my hand). Just a little more liquid did the trick! Very tasty recipe!

Seriously good and already a family favourite.  I add a tablespoon Worcester Sauce, a tablespoon lemon juice and a quarter cup chopped celery.  I also replace half the ketchup with tomato juice and add another few tablespoons of tomato juice to get a sloppier mix, as another reviewer suggested.

This is pretty good, but I think my store brand ketchup didn't help things.  Also, I rarely use beef, and with the ground turkey, this recipe came off a little too sweet for me.  Next time I'll omit the brown sugar.

Very good.  Will definitely make again.  Used red pepper instead of green.  Browned the ground beef first, removed from pan, then sauteed onion & pepper in the same pan. Once translucent, added beef and remaining ingredients.  Did have to add enough water so it could simmer for 30 mintues.

I made this for a group of neighborhood guys that had worked on a roof all day. This was good.  Definitely better then "Manwich"  I improvised and add a little worchestshire(sp?) and chili sauce.  But every one had two or more.  Will make this instead of storebought.  Not sure why anyone would have to go out a buy everything for this, it was all in my fridge except maybe the green peppers.

Made these for Friday night supper when hubby was getting home late from being on the road. They are really super! I just kept adding a bit of moisture (tomato juice and water) and let them simmer. We liked them a lot and will make again. So much better than the packaged or jar mixes. Thanks Tamara!

This is just one of those really easy, straightforward yummy family favorites.  I don't use peppers, and I usually use ground turkey breast, which is virtually fat free.  I ran out of ketchup this time, and did supplement a bit with BBQ sauce - it was just a little on the sweet side.  We eat these on whole wheat hamburger buns with a slice of cheddar!

Not what I was looking for.  I started following the directions, but found that it wasn't "sloppy" enough so I had to increase the sauce ingredients.  I also used real garlic instead of garlic powder.  Even after simmering, it still tasted as though it was missing something so I added some vinegar which gave it more of the tang I was looking for.  Okay as a starting point, but needs work.

This is a excellent recipe for sloppy joes!  My whole family enjoyed them and my sister and dad have never been a fan of them before.  My dad even remarked that they were better than the mixture you get in the can.  The leftovers disappeared within a day or so and my so called "sloppy joe haters" finished it up!  It is a great recipe and I'm sure I will make it again!

Your mom & my mom must be related because these tasted just like my mom used to make.  Even though I don't LOVE sloppy joes I have to give this five stars because there is none better.  I doubled the recipe & cut the sugar just a bit.  My husband loved them.
p.s. I've never tried Mamwich but this has to be better.

This is a good recipe.  I had made it with 3 pounds of hamburger.  I initially was going to use manwich but realized after frying the beef that I only had one can so here is what I did:  I used the 1 can of manwich and scaled the recipe for 12.  I did not have any onion or garlic powder so I used dried minced onion and dried minced garlic.  Other than those substitutions I made it according to the rest of ingredients and directions.  This is a really good flavorful sloppy joe.  Our boys really loved them as well.  Because of the rising costs of canned goods (i.e. Manwich) I will stay with this one and save some extra money.  Thanks for the great recipe.  A really must try.

I like my sloppy joes a little sweeter so I add more brown sugar. I also use 1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard powder instead of prepared mustard.

I made this for company and it got rave reviews. I did cook it in the crock-pot for 2-3 hours and added a little more ketchup and water. Turned out great!

A good recipe, but a bit "ketchupy" for me.  Try adding some chili powder for extra spice.

This could put Manwich out of business!  Very good recipe, but I do omit the brown sugar and add some worcestershire sauce.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful. No leftovers between by husband and I. I used 85% lean ground beef and did not drain the juices. I wouldn't change a thing about it. So good and sooooo easy too!

I found this recipe a while ago and loved it! The first time I made it my husband assumed it was from a can. He didn't believe me when I told him I made it from scratch. I have tweaked it a bit. I took another user's advice and used fresh minced garlic (instead of the powder) -- I love fresh garlic so I use 2-3 cloves. Just saute them for a few minutes with the onions before adding the beef. I also play w/the amount of ketchup. I noticed one reviewer said it tasted like ketchup and ground beef. I would agree that it's possible for that to happen but if you balance it to your tasting by testing, you'll be fine. I leave out the pepper because I don't like green peppers :). At the end I add a dash of hot sauce!

I am so pleased with this recipe.  I have never liked a sloppy joe before and I've never made them either.  My friend was having a holiday party and asked me to make some for her, so I hunted for the recipe with the most ratings.  This recipe (although I have nothing to compare it to) was incredible.  I added worchestershire sauce to it (maybe about 2 tbsp per recipe, I didn't meausure) and I used a good mustard powder instead of prepared mustard.  I actually look forward to making this in the future for my family on a night I need something that's easy to throw together.

This is one keeper of a recipe!  Goodbye, Manwich forever!  My husband insisted I try these with sliced pickles (which just sounded so gross to me) but I can't believe how good they went together.  Thank you!

Absolutely Delicious. Thanks Tamara. My 9-year old loved it and asked me to make it again. I omitted the green pepper (I did not have one on hand)but it was still delicious without it. Definately a keeper and will become a weekly dinner in my house. The recipe was super easy and quick too.

I have made this twice now and my whole family loved it (even my picky 2 and 4 year old kids!).  My husbands only complaint was that I didn't make more!  I did not have green pepper so I substituted celery - very good! Also I added a bit of worcestershire.  Both times I browned the ground beef and then added with all ingredients in the crock pot on low for 4-5 hours  - turned out great!

I made this and it was a crowd pleaser! The changes that I made: I used lean ground turkey (no one even noticed) and I also added 1/4 cup of celery. Marvelous!! A must try and I cooked for a very picky group of people.

I used to use manwich in the can, well not any more. This recipe taste better than manwich to my family. I used onion powder instead of onion. Family ate it up. This is a very easy recipe. Thanks Tamara.

I am always really pleased when I make this. I usually do a full cup of ketchup though, just to make it a tiny bit "sloppier" as one other reviewer put it. I add a little bit more mustard than reccomended. I've used both Spicy Brown mustard and "Sweet and Tangy" mustard, which are both excellent.

A very easy recipe and one that allows you to be creative.  Based on other reviews, I cut down the amount of brown sugar to 1 tsp.  I also wanted to liven-up the taste (so that the sauce wouldn't be too ketchup-y), so I just added 1/2 cup of ketchup and 1/4 cup of Heinz 57 sauce.  It added just the right of oomph.

OK, but needs some work.  I started off following the recipe as is, and there wasn't nearly enough sauce for the meat.  Took other reviewer's advice and doubled the sauce.  My end result was very thick and pasty, and basically just tasted like ground beef and ketchup.  I might try this again, but use tomato juice or tomato sauce instead of ketchup so that the flavor isn't so overwhelming.  Also, I found that the 30 minute cook time was a bit long.  My beef was very dried out.  Good potential, but needs work.

Very similar to my mother's recipe and our kid's favorite.  We doubled the recipe and to make it similar to mom's recipe, we added about 2 tablespoons of Worchester Sauce.  My wife later told me that mom's recipe also does not used dry mustard, but I couldn't really tell the difference.  Made a great sandwich served with a side of fries.

Excellent!  Easy, fast and delicious.  Incorporated previous viewer's comments:  extra ketchup, generous splash of worcestershire, vinegar, water.  I found no salt is needed, as the ketchup is salty enough.  Browned and drained the meat then added the vegetables.  The green pepper was not noticable in taste; I am not a green pepper lover!

This was VERY good. I always used the canned stuff till now. I had this at my Super Bowl party and everyone raved about it. There was only one thing I would do a little different, I would add a little bit of tabasco to give it a 'kick' you can add to taste, but I thought it needed it. Thanks again, this was awesome, I will make it again and again....also very easy! I also took the advice of the others and added more ketchup :)

I hadn't had sloppy joes since I was 6!  I used ground turkey browned in olive oil, doubled the sauce ingredients and served them over 20 Minute Buns (also on Allrecipes).  Very quick, kid-friendly supper.

Outstanding! Since I am allergic to green peppers, I replaced it with Jalepeno pepper (same qty).  Gave it a bit of a zip but was absolutely outstanding, if you like slightly hot and spicy, use the jalepenos instead of the green pepper.  Even better as leftovers the next day (I made a double batch the first time).

These were soooo good. I was nervous  about making them since i had the powder stuff already, but all the reviews said it was way better than manwich and i so agree. I loved manwich until i tried these. I added 1/4 c. water and a little extra ketchup. Definately will be making these again and again. Thank you!!!

A very good potluck dish, thought the slight sweet taste and fresh veggies blew away the old can of Manw#$%. It was easy to put together and smelled wonderful. Will make again soon.

Hubby and I have never been sloppy joe fans, but these fit our busy summer lifestyle to a tee!  I added a LOT of fresh green pepper and onion, and we both enjoyed the sweet difference in these sandwiches.  Leftovers were great for a quick lunch the day after.

Great recipe! Tastes even better the next day! I used Kraft's Honey Roasted Garlic BBQ Sauce along with mostly Ketchup. I also tripled the sauce to make it "sloppier." Mmm, Yum!

this recipe was very good.  i used ground turkey and substituted just under 1/4 cup of the ketchup with tony roma's bbq sauce.  i think that was a little too much.  it is such a sweet bbq sauce that it made the sloppy joe too sweet, but very addictive.  next time i will use a little less bbq.

These were fast and delicious! I would recommend doubling or even tripling the sauce because they get a little dry, but they taste fantastic. I will never use the store-bought stuff again!

Easy and the kids are crazy about it!  I use ground turkey instead of beef - no one ever knows.    I also served this with mashed potatoes, because I didn't have rolls one time & that went over well, too.

Shredded leftover beef brisket on a scale to make 1 lb.  Doubled the sauce (did add 1/4 cup water)and cooked in Crookpot for ~4 hours.  Served on buttered, toasted bun. Wow! Made a great barbecue beef sandwich.  Thanks Tamara.

This is an GREAT sloppy joe recipe. The whole family loved it! I scaled it to serve 10 and it was gone in one evening. I had to make a second batch the next day because they wanted more. I had put in a little extra brown sugar because I like my sloppy joe's on the sweet side and also added a a couple of dashes of worchestshire sauce. I did add a little water as it was cooking to prevent it from drying out as previous reviewers had recommended. Turned out perfect.....just what I was looking for!

A really great recipe and so easy to make.  We all agreed we liked it better than the recipe I had been using for years.  Like so many previous reviewers noted, I found the sauce got very dry while cooking so I added a little bit more ketchup and just a little bit of water.  I did not add any salt to the recipe as there is plenty in the ketchup.

This is a great standard sloppy joe recipe - what everyone expects a sloppy joe to be, however, as per the reviews it definetly needed more ketchup to make it sloppier! I didn't add green peppers. The recipe was made with ingredients on hand, (I had some ground beef about to go bad and needed to use it)Just as easy as a package seasoning mix and much healthier! Thanks for the recipe!

Don't pass this one up.  I like the rest of the review used Mamwhich.  My husband is a lover of Sloppy Joes and I decided to try this one out.  I will never, never use Mamwhich again!!!!!  This is the absolute BEST, BEST, BEST.

Mmmm, yummy.  I added 1 tsp vinegar, 1 tsp worcestershire sauce, added a few dashes of tabasco, and only used 2 tsps of brown sugar.  My boyfriend had seconds.  I made baked frech fries off this site and it was great.

This was awesome, my husband and I don't like the cinnamon in the packaged stuff, so this was great! I screwed up and used mustard powder, so then I added a squirt of prepared mustard and some regular barbecue sauce and it was AMAZING! My husband thought it was ok, but he hates anything sloppy. I will make this again.
I also added mushrooms. Can't wait to eat the leftovers.

All these wonderful reviews made my 5-yr old girls try this recipe and they loved it.  It's not too sloppy and it's a quick easy meal to make.  Thanks, Tamara, for introducing ground beef to my picky eaters.

Really good! Even my husband who always says "Sloppy joes??? Again??" likes this recipe. He never complains if I am making "those homemade sloppy joes". And I always have the ingredients handy. Thanks!

Great recipe.   This was the first time I've made sloppy joes and I'll definitely make again.  It was so easy!  My husband (who usually buys the canned stuff) loved it.

This was an okay recipe but nothing spectacular.  I will not make it again.  The ketchup taste was too strong for me.

Thank you Tamara !!!!!! I had a terrible craving for Sloppy Joes yesterday, & found your recipe. I thought I'd have some for lunch for just me & save the rest for dinner for two. NOT... I ate more than half for lunch yesterday & had the rest for lunch today. Great & so quick & easy. Maybe I'll try again next week , so my Sweetie can have some ;^)

I loved this recipe! I didn't use the green peppers and added a little vinegar and worcestershire sauce for an extra zing. Both of my children loved it!(including my son who is very picky)Thank you!

Great recipe!  I have made it twice already.  I use less sugar, more ketchup, and about a spoonfull of K.C. Masterpiece BBQ Sauce.  Delicious!

This is a great sloppy joe recipe! My kids picked out the onion and bell pepper but ate every last bite of the meat. My husband and I loved this and I will be adding it to our dinner rotation. I did take the advice of a previous reviewer and add worcestershire sauce. I made hamburger buns with the Amish White Bread recipe and topped the meal off with fruit and a salad. Next time I am going to try it with ground turkey instead of the beef for a lower fat meal. Wonderful!

I've made homemade sloppy joes from different recipes before, and so far this one is the easiest, and it tastes just as good as the much more involved versions! My only adjustment would be to double the recipe if you truly want to feed 6, unless you intend to give each person 1 helping on a small hamburger bun.

I was a bit disappointed by this recipe.  It just tasted like ground beef simmered with ketchup and mustard, which basically, is all it is.  I've been wanting to introduce my 4yearold son to Sloppy Joes, since he loves tacos so much.  This was not the recipe I was hoping for; he didn't like it at all.  Guess I'll try Manwich or one of those McCormick packets ...

We liked this recipe and like other reviews have decided it's better than Manwich.  I made only a couple of changes. I felt the sauce wasn't juicy enough so added more ketchup. We also added cheese on the bun.  It's a keeper.

I have never made sloppy joes from scratch.  Never been a real fan. But I was looking for something quick to make for dinner with ground beef.  I chose this recipe because I had all ingredients except for green pepper but did stop at store to get the green pepper.  Made it for myself and my boyfriend and all that was left over was maybe 1/2 cup. Normally dont do second helpings but I couldnt help it.    It was delicious.  I would definitely make it again.

Excellent recipe.  The proportions just right.  I used dark brown sugar.   I don't like green peppers, so left them out.  I think it would be delicious with a red pepper.

This is my go-to Sloppy Joe recipe.  Always goes over well.  I cut the sugar down some and add as needed to taste.

I used Furmano tomato sauce instead of ketchup. Also added two more teaspoons of brown sugar. It was a hit! My Wife, son and friend all loved it!!! Will do this again.

The sauce is what makes anything good and this sauce is delicious ( I did add some bbq sauce along with the ketchup,  just because I love bbq sauce).  And, just because I love vegetables, I chose to add more variety to mine, such as, a bit of celery, mushroom, carrot, fresh minced garlic (all chopped up very small), in addition to what is called for in the recipe.  Basically, it is whatever you desire as far as I am concerned.  But again, the sauce is what makes this and I love it.

Made it exactly to recipe. Everyone loves it. It was a tad too sweet for my personal preference but everyone enjoyed them.  I may try bbq sauce next time instead of brown sugar and ketchup

Meh- I found this to be rather bland and also too sweet (ketchup is plenty sweet, plus brown sugar) which was unfortunate, because I used it to make my own raised  Angus for a large crowd of hungry wrestlers and both the cow and the boys deserved better.. It is not a Manwich replacement if that’s what you’re after- it’ snot bad, but it’s not great, either. I believe this would be much improved with a little vinegar, a dash of Frank’s or other hot sauce (or a little cayenne or chili flake, just for a mild kick, not for heat unless that’s your thing). Instead of onion or minced onion I would consider some dry French onion soup mix (I use it all the time,, crushed and always have half a pouch in the pantry) or some Worcestershire. It definitely needs some savory to balance the sweet- some ketchup could be replaced with plain tomato sauce, or perhaps some bottled chili sauce. I will keep looking for a Sloppy recipe that does it for us.

My family loved it.  I doubled the recipe and there was nothing left.  I added water so it wasn't as thick.  Next time I'll also use less ketchup.  I was short on time but next time I'll also use the crock pot to let it simmer longer.

There are better recipes out there that are still just as easy. Too much ketchup plus all the brown sugar made this one too sweet and lacking flavor. I made many adjustments, but they weren't calculated enough to include here. If you were raised on ketchup, have a sweet tooth, and want something super quick and easy with ingredients you likely have on hand, then this will work for you, but I won't be making it again.

I have used this recipe for the last few years both as it is published and with a few modifications.  It's become the "go-to" sloppy joe recipe in our home. Per another reviewer, a dash of Worcestershire sauce is a nice addition as well.
I often try to bump up the vegetables in recipes, so frequently add grated carrot, summer squash/zucchini, finely chopped celery and/or parsley to the mixture. I like to make it earlier in the day, or the night before and reheat. Once simmered for a bit, the vegetables melt in. 

I usually use about half of the brown sugar called for, but that's just me. I don't think most people will think it is too sweet as is.  This is quick and easy, doubles up very well, and freezes well. I find you can get about six sandwiches from the pound of ground beef.

Love this recipe with it's basic ingredients you can build on to make it your own.  I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 ground turkey,  1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup bbq sauce, skipped the brown sugar, added 1 tsp Worcestershire Sauce.  After browning the meat and veg I threw everything in my crock pot for a couple of hours on low.  Added some beef broth at the end to make it a little more sloppier.  Hello 70's comfort food!  So good!

I did make changes, only because I didn't have fresh peppers...I used 3/4 mild salsa for my pepper and onions. 

Kept the rest of the recipe, if you use salsa..keep the 3 tsp brown sugar; nice balance.

This was so yummy! I made a few adjustments to take this to the next level > Added fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, added chopped mushrooms, 1/2 of a diced tomato, some scotch bonnet hot sauce & 1 tsp of apple cider vinegar. I also ran out of ketchup so I used a bit of bbq sauce (maybe 1/4 cup). I am trying not to eat this all in one sitting *drools*

Excellent recipe. I made it in the slow cooker. Just one little change.  I  added a quarter cup of tomato paste as I was a little short on ketchup.  Will make again.

This is a really good, easy, straightforward sloppy joe recipe. I used a half of an onion and a whole green pepper. I also added a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce while the meat was browning. They turned out just how I wanted them to tune out. I used Hawaiian rolls to serve. good recipe.

I have made this recipe several times starting with the original.  My version leaves out the brown sugar and adds 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke.  Love it!

Turned out amazing. Typical of 90 percent of reviewers, I made some substitutions. Instead of all ketchup, I did half ketchup and half tomato soup and instead of brown sugar I did a teaspoon of white sugar.

I grew up on sloppy joes so I know a good one when I taste it. This recipe is the best! I didn’t change a thing, and I don’t plan to. Be sure to use a good quality hamburger bun.

I didn't have a green pepper and I'm not a huge fan of garlic powder so omitted both of them. Hubby thought I had a can of manwich. It was a hit and now, I'll never be able to use the can stuff again. 5 stars just ain't enough

I loved this recipe and so did my kids, one of which who is not a big meat eater. It is the perfect amount of sweetness. I did add a tablespoon of water when simmering to help the dish simmer better because my stovetop runs hot and our low setting is not so low.

I grew up eating Manwich and I haven’t eaten it or even a sloppy joe for years. I have been trying to cook things from scratch more and love that you can pronounce all ingredients, buy everything organic, and it was actually really easy without having 100 ingredients.

Really good and easy. I did what another person suggested and used 1/2 ketchup and 1/4 bbq sauce.  My fiancé wanted me to make them like his mom used to. So instead of using bread I wrapped it up in croissant dough ?with cheese and baked them. They didn’t come out pretty, but they were delicious. Everyone loved them.

Best and simplest recipe, I highly recommend! I added chopped celery when cooking the chopped pepper and onion and celery gave the Sloppy Joe a little crunch. Absolutely delicious recipe.

I have a family of 6 so I had to make adjustments to the ratio. I did add fresh mince garlic instead of the powder; I added a little bit of Worcestershire sauce and some fresh basil while I was cooking the beef and veggies. I then put the other ingredients along with the meat mixture in the slow cooker on high for about 2 hours. This recipe will def be used again in my household.

This was better than I originally thought it would be. The only sloppy joe i have made was from a packet. I made a few changes. I used a red bell pepper since I didn’t have a green one. I like the flavor of onion, so I chopped about a third of a cup, used a heaping half cup of ketchup and a little shy of a quarter cup bbq sauce. While everything was simmering, I sprinkled more garlic powder and added onion powder. I spooned mine over a junior kaiser roll and my husband had his over an open baked potato. I would definitely ask this again!

Easy to make, taste good, not the best I ever had. Will I make it again, probably. I can’t find any of my old recipes for this so this will do for now. I put more bell peppers and onion. I prefer lots of stuff in it.

This recipe was a hit! I used yellow and red baby bell peppers instead of the green bell peppers. They tend to be. bit sweeter tasting.

I made this one night for my sister, and she is NOT a big fan of sloppy joes. But she actually wanted me to make it 3 days in a row she loved it. This recipie is a must for people with little time but with great flavor. I love making this and I will continue to make it every time someone feels like sloppy joe day.

Made this for dinner tonight. I used turkey meat as I don’t eat red meat.. It seemed like a good recipe and no one complained!! However, it was a bit too sweet for me and I longed for the heartiness of the tomato sauce, which it was lacking in. Smelled very strongly of the 1 tsp of mustard and I feared I had messed up on the recipe a few times due to this. Will not use again. Thank you, anyway!

Delish!! I do wish it had more sauce,  the simmer time is too long for basically  no sauce.  But flavor is amazing.  Never going back to the canned stuff! Thanks for the easy recipe!

I was looking for a quick Saturday night meal and decided to try this recipe, and I was very glad I did. I followed the directions with the exception I ran low on ketchup and added about a quarter cup of barbeque sauce to top off the 3/4 cup, I followed the directions as written. It was delicious. My husband and I really enjoyed it and with just the two of us I had enough left over to put over baked potatoes for another night's meal. Quick, easy, tasty, who could ask for more?

This recipe was so good and much better than Manwich and good enough to eat all by itself. Even my 2 picky eaters asked for seconds. I did used half a cup of ketchup and a half of cup BBQ sauce and omitted the brown sugar. 
This is definitely a keeper!

My family loves this sloppy Joe! I made a couple of small modifications. I used Heinz Jalapeño catsup for a third of the catsup (I tripled the recipe), which gave it just a little kick. I also only used 2 tbsp brown sugar and added 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar. Definitely a family favorite at our house!

I have never liked Sloppy Joes until this recipe. After tasting the basic recipe, I did add just a bit of the other ingredients suggest by others to increase the complexity of flavors. I added a half teaspoon of white vinegar,  a teaspoon of War sauce. a half cup more ketchup, a 1/4 cup chili sauce, a tablespoon of chipotle mustard, and a half cup of water, a few shakes of cayenne, and I simmered it for a half hour more.  I served this on grilled brioche buns. Hubs really liked it after he got over the shock of me actually making Sloppy Joes.

My husband and I really liked this recipe.
Although, knowing our taste, I added more Garlic, a couple of dashes if Paprika, 
5 dashes of Worcestershire sauce, and seasoning sauce instead of salt. I was delicious.
I'll be searching for my comment the next time I want Sloppy Joes

Best ever Sloppy Joe recipe! My wife asks for it a couple times per month and it’s super fantastic every time. We tweak it here and there with jalapeños and some cider vinegar. So happy I found this one, it’s easily in both of our top ten dinners ever. Thanks!!

Made this twice and the second time around I ran short on ketchup so I finished it off with Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce. Yum! Even better than the first time.
Great recipe!

This recipe was great! Followed previous suggestions and used molasses instead of sugar and half the amount called for. It was still too sweet so will use even less next time. Other than that the taste was way better than the canned stuff!

When I make this I use 3/4 cup bbq sauce and 1/2 cup ketchup otherwise its too dry for me.  I also eliminate the brown sugar since I use the bbq sauce.  I love it on a baked sweet potato instead of a bun.

This is what Sloppy Joe's are supposed to taste like! I have made several items from Allrecipes, but this is the first one that was rave worthy. I made the first batch exactly as written -  which is what you're supposed to do, right? As excellent as it was, it was a little loose and crumbly. The second batch I eliminated the brown sugar and added 1/4 cup BBQ sauce. It was very good as well and had a nice stickiness, but the BBQ flavor dominated and took over. I am going to make 20 pounds of the original recipe for a family reunion, and add beef broth as necessary to make it a little more moist. Thank you for posting such a wonderful, easy, quick, timeless recipe.

Tasted like hamburger saturated in ketchup and really on the sweet side. Which is the 3 star rating. However , it served as a fantastic base for me to add heavy chill powder, Worcester sauce, Soy sauce, and 1/2 cup of  water - the end result was delicious!

Delicious! Like other reviewers suggested, I used 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup BBQ sauce. Since the BBQ sauce has sweetness, I reduced the brown sugar by 1 tsp. Next time I think I will omit the brown sugar entirely. I'll also note that I didn't need to add any salt, just a little pepper. Very quick and easy, will definitely be making this again!

This is better than Manwich and as easy to make.
I made this according to recipe except!
 I know, people hate this. It's just a personnel preference.
I added can of diced green chili's 
1 Tsp. Worcestershire and 1 Tsp. Vinegar.

This is great! I was looking for a recipe that didn’t call for Worcestershire sauce (another bottle that I won’t use, just taking up space) and this delivered! I used some bbq sauce, omitted the brown sugar (ketchup has enough sugar) and added a dash of chili powder with ground turkey. Will be making again.

Very good. My suggestions though. 2 tsp of brown sugar instead of 3 (way too sweet with 3). Also, one thing that helped this immensely was adding 1-2 tsp of Frank’s Red Hot. It doesn’t make it spicy (unless you want to add enough to make it spicy), but it takes some of the ketchup taste away, and gives it a bolder flavor. I highly recommend making those changes.

I so enjoyed this recipe.  Very good, however, I didn't use that much brown sugar, only small amounts to taste.  I toasted the buns, added meat and topped with southern style cole slaw. Yum.....!!  Quick, easy and filling on busy days.  Thanks for sharing this.

I thought it was a bit too sweet so I would probably reduce the amount of brown sugar next time. Other than that, it was quick and easy to make. Family liked it.

One of my favorite recipes to make. I use honey mustard instead of yellow, I do half a cup of ketchup with a quarter cup of BBQ sauce, and I use seasoning salt. They've turned out just wonderful each time.

Pretty  good. Took some other raters suggestions for the second time around by adding Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, minced garlic, water, and bbq sauce. Double everything except meat if you like it sloppy. Cook for 20 min. on low is good enough. Came out even better. Looking forward to using this for other dishes.

To avoid sugar I used crushed tomatoes instead of ketchup and eliminated the brown sugar all together and it was DELICIOUS.  I mean - all the kids, husband, all of them loved it.

Best recipe ever. Easy to double or triple. I usually leave out the peppers but it’s always so delicious!

Excellent - My husband LOVED it!   Next time I will double all the recipe except for the brown sugar.   It was a little bit sweet.

This is a simple and low-maintenance weeknight meal- I made it for myself and one other person, but I'm sure it would be popular with families as well. Nothing fancy, but tasty and filling!

This was delicious! My kids don't like the canned mix so we tried this and it was a hit. We all gobbled it up! I did not put in green pepper and I only used 1 tsp of brown sugar which was plenty. It reminds me of the Heinz mix that we used to love but is no longer made. Thanks!

Excellent! I did leave out the green pepper because my husband does not like it. I think the green pepper would have added even more flavor, but this recipe is great without it. So much better than canned, and so very easy.

Turned out just as expected. Much better than the stuff from a can.  I added some Tabasco sauce to the sandwich and it was delicious.  Might add it to the cooking step next time.

Four stars as I added a small can of tomato sauce to help with consistency and two teaspoons of pickle juice to kick up the flavor.  Try it, you won’t be disappointed.  Thanks for sharing; family loved it!

I substituted celery for the pepper (only because I didn't have any peppers)   My husband loved it - and my 13 y/o son who normally complains when we have sloppy joes - never said a word and ate all of his!  This recipe is definitely a keeper!!

Loved by the whole family. I doubled the recipe yet only used 1 teaspoon of brown sugar and it was plenty sweet. Added a splash of Worcestershire just because......definitely will make again.

The only change I made was I put a little bit of buffalo ketchup as well. Added a touch of heat. Otherwise, it is perfect the way it is!

I've made this recipe about 20 times since I found it years ago, I've tweaked it just a little bit over the years, I use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder, a dash of Worcestershire Sauce and I replace half of the ketchup with Contadina tomato sauce. It's a favorite in our house.

Great recipe. This is a weeknight go to. Followed other reviewer’s advice and used a quarter cup of barbecue sauce. I think it made this great recipe even better

Hi we added a full cup of green peppers and celery. Added ketchup and  brown sugar to sweeten up and worcesterchire sauce to accentuate the flavor. We like ours saucy. Sloppy. ??

I have made this several times. Everyone loves it! I always double the recipe (leftovers are yummy!) Last time I made it I was 1/4 cup short on ketchup, so I subbed in BBQ sauce. My family said it was even better. Thanks so much for a much tastier sloppy joe than the usual canned sauce I used for years!

as many other reviewers have already said, this is a good base recipe for joes that allows for as much or as little riffing as you want. with that in mind, i varied slightly from the recipe (i almost never follow a recipe to the letter), but kept the spirit intact.

to begin with, i started my veggies first because i wanted to ensure that the peppers and onions were well cooked. next, i added about 1tsp of smoked paprika, thyme (dried) and cumin. i skipped the ketchup, brown sugar and mustard and went straight for my favorite bottled barbeque sauce, which already has the right balance of sweetness that i'm looking for. i also added a couple of drops of hot sauce for just a hint of heat. the end result is a slightly sweet, slightly smoky, well flavored meat mix that will leave just a whisper of heat on your tongue.

to serve, i use hoagy rolls (which cuts down on the sloppy part) cheddar cheese slices and either pickle chips or  sweet relish and tomato slices.

We'll definitely make this again!  The only adjustment we had to make was replace half the ketchup with BBQ sauce....we thought we had enough ketchup. We were wrong.  But oh what a delicious mistake we made.

I really loved this recipe, but tweaked it a bit for my family’s own taste.  I honestly followed all of the instructions listed, but added about 4 oz. of beer, 2 tbsp of strawberry jelly, 3 tbsp of spicy bbq sauce, 1 tbsp of steak seasoning and about 2 tbsp of corn starch to thicken it up.  I love the base recipe but it is a bit bland so I decided to spice it up a bit with some extra sweet and spicy additives.  Try it out and see what you think!

My family LOVED these. Me, not as much. I grew up on the Mccormack mix variety and these don’t taste like those at all. I think I would try it again and substitute some tomato paste for part of the ketchup

So much better than the canned stuff.  We doubled the recipe.  I added a little beef broth because it wasn't as juicy as I prefer.  So super easy to make!  Definitely adding this to our permanent rotation.

This a great recipe, similar to the one I have made for years. I add a splash of vinegar (any vinegar is ok), the vinegar adds a great depth to the sloppy joes. I always have requests for this recipe!

Awesome sloppy joes! I followed the recipe to a T... and they turned out great! Will definitely be making again! Super easy and not difficult AT ALL. My daughter hates onions and couldn’t tell they were there and she loved these sloppy joes. I will never be buying Manwich again!

Great as is.   I also made a version adding 1lbs of beef and 1/2 lbs of well cooked lentils (I do this with shepherds pie as well to stretch it out) today and turned out good as well.

My husband absolutely loves this, only thing i changed was instead of chopped onions and bell peppers I added a drained can of ro*tel tomatoes and chiles. I was a huge hit, everytime I make it i have to do a minimum of two pounds!

Great recipe and can be adjusted to each family's individual taste. We are watching our fat intake, so we use ground turkey. I also like to add some fresh chopped garlic and a splash of Worcestershire sauce. Since I found this recipe, I'll never use the canned stuff or seasoning packets again.

I thought this was a little too sweet even without all the brown sugar so I added some more mustard. I also added a bit of salsa and Worcestershire sauce.

I made this without the mustard - since I don't like mustard - and it turned out perfect!  I have been making another recipe for several years. Wish I would have discovered this one sooner!!  My husband and I just love it.  Will be making this at least once a week now!

Didn't have green pepper on hand so I chopped up a small carrot and two mushroom tops (picky kid didn't notice heh heh...). Very tasty and easy to make with common pantry items. Will definitely make again.

This recipe was amazing!! It's super easy to make and doesn't take much time at all. I added half of a yellow onion and whole green bell pepper.  I forgot to add the salt and black pepper but the flavours were still great. I served this with a side of waffle fries I heated up in the oven. I will definitely make this again and not change a thing.

I made it as written except used a whole onion instead of green peppers.  It was the best sloppy joe I have ever had.  It was also a huge hit at a big church potluck and better than any bought sauce I have tried.  This will be my go-to for making this dish anytime in the future!

Very delicious!! Browned the ground beef, onions and green peppers together then placed it in my slow cooker along with the other ingredients. 
For the ketchup I used 50% ketchup and 50% bbq sauce, added a couple tsps. Worcestershire sauce and a couple tsps. lime juice. Slow cooked it for 8 hours on low, Delicious!!

Excellent quick and easy, but very tasty recipe.  I did add about a teaspoon of white vinegar because, believe it or not, I'm not a big fan of ketchup and I needed to cut the sweetness just a bit.  I also grated some Pepper Jack cheese and put it on both sides of the burger bun, grilled the buns till the cheese melted then topped with the Sloppy J mix. Thanks for posting Tamara!

I used deer hamburger meat but marinated it all day in olive oil, 2 smashed garlic cloves, little Worcestershire and Himalayan salt.  I also had some leftover BBQ sauce and substituted the 3/4 ketchup for 1/2 BBQ and the rest ketchup.  Although I did that small difference this recipe would be awesome the way it is.    We toasted the buns and made organic potato home fries.  What a delicious comfort meal and a great recipe for healthier sloppy joes we’ve missed for years.

Switched out regular ketchup with Wataburger spicy ketchup didn't make it overly spicy but did add lots of flavor! Very yummy, will be making this again for sure.

this was good but way too sweet. I put in the exact measurements and it was just okay. I would suggest adding more mustard and cut back a bit on the brown sugar. I also added a bit of hot sauce to give it a kick.

My family's favorite sloppy joe's!  Great for dinner then for leftovers.  I used red peppers instead of green because they were all I had at them time.  Recipe turned out great!  The only thing I will do differently next time is to use half the water.

I tripled the recipe since I was making for a pot luck. Sauted ground beef, onion, and green pepper in a pan before putting it in slow cooker. Added remaining ingredients including a little apple cider vinegar and worcestershire. Cooked on low for four hours. Excellent.

easy to make...I made a double batch in order to have leftovers.  This was too sweet for us.  I added some apple cider vinegar which toned it down a bit, but not enough.  I will be trying it again but will try to cut down on all of the sugar.

I was actually disappointed with the recipe, I wanted to try something different from mine as mine has a lot of ingredients and I was in a hurry, but this was so bland.  I tried to spice it up with 1/4 cup chilli sauce, but it just didn’t have the flavours,  I am going back to my recipe.

This is part of our repertoire now. I mix ketchup, bbq sauce, and marinara together instead of just ketchup and skip the brown sugar since the bbq usually has sweetness.

Great foundation for Jose' Messias. Not fond of green peppers, so I skipped those. Substituted  some Sweet Baby Ray Hickory & Brown Sugar BBQ sauce for about a quarter of the ketchup, splashed some Worcestershire  sauce into the ground beef before browning it, and used fresh garlic (4 cloves) instead of  powder, adding them when the meat was mostly done browning.
When I added the sauce to the meat, I also spiked it with some hot flakes a friend concocts, some sweet relish, paprika, curry powder, celery seed, cumin,  and turmeric. Simmered it down to a good consistency and demolished it. I loved the tip about freezing it in a muffin tin, but there really wasn't enough to worry about freezing.

Very basic and SUPER good.  After I browned the beef, I drained the fat off of it and I also cut back on the catchup to 1/2 and added 1/4 BBQ sauce and deleted the brown sugar altogether.  This will definitely be in our dinner menu for years to come.

This was good.  1st time I made as is--good.  2nd time  I added 3 cloves of garlic (mainly for health-not trying to improve taste--but I liked the taste and flavor--husband did too).  Also added a smidge of cayenne pepper --next time might add red pepper flakes.  I also might try hiding a chopped up stalk of celery --maybe(for health--not taste). I do recommend using Heinz ketchup because it has a kick (or else putting a splash of vinegar.    As written it is good---EASY and pretty fast.

Way too sweet. Ketchup is loaded with sugar anyway and then this recipe adds more sugar. I used plain tomato sauce instead and added 1 tsp of Italian seasoning. I subbed red bell pepper for green (which I don’t care for) and used 1 minced garlic clove.I increased the amount of onion to 1/2 a large onion and added a large diced fresh tomato. I also added a couple of pinches of hot chili flakes to make it less kiddie food. Served it with noodles. It’s ok. Fast and easy.

My husband and I truly loves this recipe. It reminds us of life before our kids, who have all grown up and moved away. I did make a few adjustments to the ingredients. I changed the mustard to 1 tablespoon, the ketchup to 1 cup, and added 1/2 to 1 cup of water. After combining the rest of the ingredients, I simmered it all for about 30 minutes.  We sometimes burn our mouths because we can’t wait to eat. I serve ours on toast or buns.

This has been my go-to sloppy joe recipe for several years. It's great just how it is. However, I wanted to mention that tonight my husband made it while I was busy with something else, and he decided to add a squirt or two of sriracha... it was a delicious addition for those who like a little spice!

This is a solid Sloppy Joe recipe for sure - I saved it & will use it again!  I tweaked a few things - added minced garlic & some fresh herbs; as well as less brown sugar.  I used more onion & sweet peppers - as we love them both!   GJ & TY for sharing!

I always use ground turkey in substitue for ground beef, usually no one can tell the difference as the recipe is just that good.  I used a yellow pepper as I like the flavor better than a green, added about a 1/2 Tblsp of worcestershire, also added a little vinegar to mine, I like the tang.  I didn't use the full 3 Tblsp of brown sugar, I added to taste.

I used ground chicken and red bell pepper (I don’t care for green bell peppers). My son loved the sweetness. Next time I’d maybe add half the brown sugar. Overall, we really enjoyed this! I love how simple and quick it is! A keeper!

This is good no matter what you do to it. I've made it per the recipe, and then made it based on what I had around or felt like adding. It's always a good, easy meal. Good for game day, good for crowds, good for a quick weeknight dinner. I generally make it with ground turkey not beef. I sometimes cut out the brown sugar and ketchup and just use bottled BBQ sauce and some tomato sauce or even leftover pasta sauce. I like veggies, so if I have limp celery or tomatoes I chop that up and throw in as well. And whether I put it in the pot or on the sandwich, I always add any kind of cheese I have on hand -- chedder, colby, muenster, even mozz. This has been added to my Old Faithful list.

We didn’t have any ketchup on hand so we used BBQ sauce and cut the brown sugar completely and it was still great! 10/10 recommend trying it on a pretzel bun and it reheats pretty well too

We don't have ketchup so I used BBQ sauce and garlic salt instead of powder and a small can of tomato paste plus a quarter tsp of cayenne pepper for some extra kick. Amazing, definitely would make again!

This was a HUGE hit with my family.  I followed another review and cut the ketchup to 1/2c and then added 1/4c of BBQ sauce, and then skipped the brown sugar.  Definitely the way to go.  This will absolutely be in the repeat list :)

Loved it.  Like suggested in other reviews, I swapped the Ketchup for 1/2 C. and then 1/4 C. BBQ sauce and withheld the brown sugar (in BBQ sauce).  Family of 5 loved it!

This is a wonderful recipe. I made a Texas version using Hatch green chili instead of green bell peppers. Also substituted 1/4 of the ketchup with BBQ sauce. Came out great.

My kids loved it. I did like others and cooked the meat, onion and peppers and then threw the rest in the slow cooker for a few hours. Added a little less ketchup and brown sugar.  I’ll make it again for them for sure.

I made this twice in one week! Definitely a very tasty basic recipe - absolutely delicious as written, and with a few changes could be even better. The biggest change would be to double, at least! Thank you for submitting this wonderful recipe. So, so simple.

Very tasty! I would advise draining the meat before adding any condiments, or seasonings. It was a little too juicy for me.

BEST sloppy joes EVER!!!  The only thing I do differently is I use about 3/4 cup ketchup, 1/4 cup Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar barbecue sauce, and a splash of Worcestershire sauce, and omit the brown sugar.   Keep everything else the same.  Everyone LOVES this recipe!!!!

Excellent! Will definitely make again. I loved that it was simple, quick and tasted great. The only thing I changed was I used a combination of ketchup and BBQ sauce, and I also added a small amount of water.

I love this sloppy joe recipe, and so does everyone in my house. Making it exactly as the recipe states is perfect. Sometimes I add chopped green pepper just for extra flavor, but it’s not necessary.

My kids all liked this so it gets an automatic 4 for that. I added some worcestershire sauce and next time I might cut down on the sugar. But all in all, a good recipe, much better than the dry mix.

I didn't add the brown sugar, it was plenty sweet without it. I doubled the recipe, added a stalk of celery, diced. Subbed half the catsup with BBQ sauce. Added a couple of squirts of   Worcestershire sauce. Threw together in the crock pot. Tasted better the next day!  Will continue to tweak to get the sweetness down some more. Maybe a dash of vinegar? My hubby and grand daughter loved it!

Amazing recipe! I had to use Jalapeno instead of bell pepper because I was out, but it turned out super good.

Made this recipe so many times and never get tired of it. One of the most delicious sloppy joes recipes. I usually substitute the yellow mustard with some BBQ sauce. I have tried the recipe with both ground beef or ground pork; both times delicious.

I make this all the time for my family, and they LOVE it.  SO much better then store bought.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I do adjust the amounts of the ingredients slightly to suit my family more, but it is an awesome recipe.

Wayyy too sweet. There is already a lot of high fructose corn syrup in all the ketchup. Cut down on the brown sugar to 1 tsp. Maybe substitute some ketchup with tomato paste.

I made this recipe adding a few ingredients of my own, along with the original recipe. I added a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce, a quarter cup of bbq sauce and some seasoned pepper. It’s very delicious.

I made this recipe with slight modification and it turned out beautifully!  I used 1 lb Jennie O Turkey, Red Onion, 2 TBS dry hidden valley ranch,  2 TBS spicy brown mustard, 2 TBS ketchup, 1 TBS Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ Sauce, 2 TBS brown sugar, and garlic, salt and pepper per the recipe.  Served on buttered toasted brioche bun, Pepper Jack Cheese, and a crisp chilled dill pickle slice.

This was a good recipe!  It was a little on the sweet side for me but still quite enjoyable.

With the leftovers I baked with a little cheese into crescent rolls and that was bangarang.

I made this for my kids and husband recently and they could not get enough!! I used ground turkey instead of beef, left off the brown sugar, and added a few of my go-to spices for similar things (chili powder, cumin, basil) and voila! Easy, yummy, and very kid-friendly. I will definitely be making these again.

Made it for game night. It was devoured. I omitted onion and green peppers due to preferences but added onion powder. Many added old Dutch dill pickle flavored potato chips. It will be in the regular rotation.

No not in my house! One bite a nasty look followed by "What grocery store did you buy this from? Cuz it's yuck" Well this recipe looked like a why not let's try. The answer is the one you have that takes longer to make. THAT'S THE ONE YOU USE

My family loved it. I used red pepper instead of green, added celery and more ketchup. Next time I will add less brown sugar.

This sloppy Joe's recipe was definitely displeasing!!!  It tasted like a hamburger with sugar and too much mustard. I am very exited to go back to my grandmothers mediocre sloppy joes!!!!

Made a double recipe of this for my husband's birthday dinner. Everyone loved it (even the picky eaters). Added 1 Tbsp Worcestershire and combined all in the slow cooker. I'll never buy the canned sauce again. This one's a keeper!

Best Sloppy Joes EVER!  Although,  I did alter somewhat.  I did not include green pepper (picky eaters in my fam,) used 3/4 cup water instead of Ketchup (too much sugar & preservatives in Ketchup,) used 2 tsp. of brown sugar instead of 3, and used 1 (6 oz.) can of tomato paste (more lycopene than ketchup.)   It was DELISH!!!!

I usually make my own recipe which uses tomato sauce and the cupboard was bare. So i found this recipe to use what i had available. Grateful!  It was fantastic. I did follow a recommendation to add quick oats oatmeal as a thickening agent.  I thought it made it a little healthier. I used red peppers instead of green for preference and added worcestershire sauce as i do with my original recipe. Top notch!  thanks for the life saver:)

Very good, very easy. Made according to the recipe, but when tasted after it had cooked a while in my slow cooker, added some dark molasses to add a touch of sweetness. I made it for a family gathering, using about 7 lbs. of meat, so added about 1/4 cup of molasses. Will make again! Thank you!

I have three picky boys aged 9, 6, and 3. Growing up, sloppy joes were one of my top 3 favorites! I dreaded making dinner all day today because it was just another thing for the three gremlins to reject. But that didn’t happen. They all loved it! Thank you so much.

Ive made this many times.  Sure beats Manwich and healthier.  I use less brown sugar, about 1 tsp, to make it less sweet.

Great with just a few adjustments:  3 tsp mustard (a little more tart) double brown sugar (a little more sweetness) and worceshire sauce (just because). Easy to make to your own liking. Enjoy.

This was a hit in our house! My husband loved it and the bell peppers and onion just made everything come together. I may just add some more peppers, or even a red pepper for a kick next time! I only added about half of the brown sugar, and a little bit more ketchup. Others suggested adding a little barbecue sauce which I may try next time! I substituted ground beef for ground turkey breast.  They key is to not overcook it and if needed, add a little water. Delish!

This recipe is great! Put the brown sugar in last, if it’s already sweet enough. I put everything except the burger in my blender and then add it after draining off the fat. Beats canned stuff by miles.

I followed the recipe exactly as written and, OOOMMMMGGG! I will NEVER buy the store bought sloppy-Joe packs again! This recipe is awesome! By far the best version I've tasted. My family was blown away by the flavor and didn't leave a lick of it left.

Judging the recipe AS IS, I wasn’t too impressed. First off, the serving size portions are off. I would adjust the servings a little higher than you are planning because my “6 serving” size would maybe feed 4 at most. Secondly, this recipe is way too sweet. Ketchup already has so much sugar in it, I found the additional sugar a bit excessive. Meh.

Great proportions...i always use ground turkey, half and half catsup and bbq sauce, a shake of red pepper flakes and a glub of good beer to thin it out a bit while simmering, saving the rest to wash down those tasty Joes!

Excellent. used leftover hamburger patties, added fresh diced tomatoes, two extra splashes of Worcestershire. Wanted less sodium so I used 1/4 of the ketchup and 1/2 can of no salt tomato paste. A few dashes of cayenne, garlic powder and just a dash of salt and it was perfect. Finally, I can make legit sloppy joes that taste incredible. 
 Go homemade, fellow cooks, and avoid that packaged poison sauce mix like the plague.

Needed to make something quick and easy and we live in Norway and this is not served here. 
Tried this recipe and it was very good ! 
Did not change anything to see how it tasted first.

This is so simple, yet produces a simply delicious sloppy joe. I often make it to use as a sauce for hot dogs.  I think I like it because of the sweetness. Yum! I frequently quadruple the recipe when cooking for a crowd and utilize my crockpot. Just brown the beef with onion and pepper. Drain it. And add the beef along with the remaining ingredients to the crockpot and cook on low for 3 hours.

This is an awesome recipe for Sloppy Joes ! I use ground venison for mine. In stead of the garlic powder, I keep a jar of minced garlic on hand to use in my recipes so I thought I would give it a try. Works great ! I've added a few shakes of Worcestershire sauce. But to be honest it's great recipe. My husband loves them. It a great week night meal. It's a keeper!

This a good basic recipe. However, like some of the other reviewers, I found this to be on the sweet side, so I reduced the brown sugar to 1 teaspoon, and added one teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce.

Love this will use again.  I however did not use the green pepper as no one I’m my home likes it.  I also thought to sweet n ketchups so I added 1tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce.

They were very good! Only thing I would change is cut the brown sugar back to just 1T.  The flavor was good enough without oversweetening these.

This is a very good recipe. I doubled it because I need to feed bottomless pits.

I also added 3 fresh peeled diced ripe tomatoes to give it a bit more liquid.

I simmered 1 hour and placed in the crock pot to cook for 4 more hours.

I served on toasted hoagie rolls.

it was delish!

It was amazing! My husband and 11 month old loved it, I would make a little bit more sauce, and I also added some Worcestershire sauce and a capful of white vinegar. Absolutely amazing, and will be making again soon.

I made no changes and was very pleased with the results. Not as messy as the usual which was a treat in itself. I ate one, then froze the rest of the filling for future meals - thaw, heat and serve.! Wonderful!

All I added was 1/2 a cup of water and then simmered it. Very good recipe!

Did add some barbecue sauce because I didn't have enough ketchup.  Was great.  We all loved it, and I will make it again!  :)

I'll make it again! I will have to rate it again if I make it exactly as the recipe states. This time, I had to make some changes. I  didn't have enough ketchup so I used about 1/2 c (instead of 3/4 c) and I added 1/4 c of BBQ sauce. I forgot to add the brown sugar and I used garlic salt instead of garlic powder.  I don't plan to buy the store canned sloppy joe mix again but I will keep making this! My hubby and I liked it alot!

This is very good. There is no need to buy Manwich. You already have these ingredients. For us we didn't think it needed salt -it already has ketchup.  Add water or it won't simmer. Added about 3T vinegar to cut the sweetness.

I followed the recipe to the letter and these are hands down WAAAY better than sloppy joes from a can.  They are the pefrect mix of sweet and tangy and the added peppers are nice in the mix.  A new family staple for sure.

This is a good base recipe. I agree with those that modified to make it less sweet so I substituted 1 cup tomato sauce for one of the cups of ketchup.

Meh, I was surprised by the rave reviews after making this. I thought it was pretty basic, and just "okay".  Not extremely flavorful. Felt a lot like making meatloaf...and then putting it on bread. Won't be making it again.

Most easiest, tastiest way to make sloppy joes. I will never need to purchase the can again! Thanks so much. The recipe is so simple and taste much better then the can. I did add a small can of tomato sauce to balance it out. Otherwise followed the recipe as written. Perfect! Thanks for sharing.

Loved this! I live in Taiwan where beef is quite expensive so I made it with pork and added a 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce, a little liquid smoke and a jalapeño for a little kick. Absolutely wonderful!

My daughter is a SUPER picky teenager. She agreed to try this sloppy joe recipe and she loves it as do I. I was lazy and picked up a can of manwhich sloppy Joe canned sauce, the stuff i always thought was awesome (before I tried your recipe :)). I didn't tell my daughter and she did not like it at all! Either did I. Just wanted you to know you should bottle it and sell it! Thank you for posting this 5 star recipe!

This is my go-to recipe. I try to sneak as many veggies in as I can - minced garlic, finely chopped celery, shredded carrots, and finely chopped spinach as well as the onion and bell pepper in the recipe. It also makes it go a little further.

I've tried several other sloppy joes recipes from this site and this is by far the best! I doubled the recipe and mixed together a pound of lean ground beef and a pound of ground sausage and my family said they love this recipe better than any other I've tried. The others were ok, but this recipe is the best we've ever had so they made me promise to always use this recipe for sloppy joes from now on. No problem kids! Easy, quick and delicious so who can argue with that?! Served them up with sweet potatoes fries and everyone loved it. Great recipe and I'll be using this one for many years to come. Well done!!

it was way too sweet, and i didn't even add as much sugar as the recipe called for.  will probably add less ketchup, too.

We will definitely make this again and again. Even though we can buy a can of Manwich at the dollar store and it is ok, This is WAY better and worth the extra few minutes to chop and measure out a few simple ingredients!!!!!

I made this and after reading the reviews, just cut back on the brown sugar, didn't have a green pepper so I used a red one and it turned our really well.  I will definitely make again.  Quick, easy and tasty!

I  wish I would have realized how simple it was to make sloppy Joe sauce. I will never be buying the canned sloppy Joe sauce again. The only change I made to the recipe was to add more garlic (personal preference, love lots of garlic in my food).

I can't give it 5 stars because I tweeked it abit. What I did was used a red bell instead of green and used some Worchester sauce (about a teaspoon ). This is now my goto recipe.

Easy and Very good! After working all day, I was searching for a easy recipe for dinner tonight, and came across this recipe, we had all the ingredients in the refrigerator so it was chosen, I am glad I did, the only change I made was I used fresh garlic instead of the powdered garlic. And I topped it with some shredded cheddar and a dill pickle.   I will make it again, it was a hit.

I followed the recipe exactly as written. Made this last night and served on seeded buns that I put butter on and broiled in the oven.  I would point out that even though it may look done after you add the brown sugar, ketchup and mustard.. it is important that you let it simmer for the advised 30 minutes.  I tasted it before the simmer and it was nowhere near as good as after having let it simmer.  My husband rates this 5 stars.  I rate it only 3 but it's because I am just not a fan of hamburger to begin with.  However, it was tasty and I didn't dislike it like most hamburger recipes.  I

I didn't have a green bell pepper, but otherwise followed this recipe to the T. It is definitely a keeper! I usually use a brand name packet that my grocery store was out of - but this will be my new official go-to recipe for Sloppy Joes. So sweet and could easily be tweaked with the pepper or other ingredients. My children loved this and cleaned their plates, which they didn't before with the "packets" flavor.

Been making sloppy Joes forever. Taste even better as sloppy seconds the next day. If you like to make them with chili sauce rather than just plain catsup, just add a bit of horseradish to the catsup and voila! you have chili sauce taste. 

Always finely diced green pepper for added taste and I throw in a can of V-8 (12 oz.)

Cook the entire batch down until it almost dries out, but does not burn. 

I like good old American cheese on mine.

Very easy recipe with most ingredients readily available in your pantry.  I added some chopped mushrooms and shredded carrot to the mix.  Cut the ketchup with tomato paste but added a little barbecue seasoning I had on hand.  Makes a thick sauce.  Next time will double the batch to make some for freezing and I like the crockpot idea!

My husband loves sloppy Joes, but hates green peppers, so I decided to make sloppy Joes from scratch rather than buy the pre made mix. He loved it. I obviously leave out the green peppers and substitute onion powder in place of the onions (he also hates that vegetable crunch even from cooked veggies), I also add more mustard to give it a tangy taste.

Much better than what I grew up  on which was heavy on Worcestershire sauce and ketchup..  This will become our go to recipe.  Even our very picky son liked it.  May try a dash or two of Worcestershire sauce next time

Thanks for the recipe.

I was looking for a simple, very basic recipe that used ground beef and I gotta say, this one is super easy to make and tastes very good! I didn't add the green pepper because I didn't have any, but it didn't make a difference. You could really add whatever extra veggies you have around the house, it would still be tasty

Loved this recipe...so easy and quick to make.  I found that there wasn't too much sauce, and I like that since I don't like my sloppy joes getting too sloppy.  Of course you can always add a little more ketchup, brown sugar and mustard to the mix if you want more sauce, but I found this to be great.

This recipe is great, I thought it would be too simple with the ingredients given but was proven wrong. Depending on my mood i'll dice up some Jalapenos to go in alongside the green pepper, also adding some cayenne pepper powder to spice it up or a spoon full of hot sauce.

It's great having this in your fridge after you make a batch. Put this on top of a hot dog with american cheese & jalapenos, Holeee chit!

This is a very good recipe.  I did tweak it just a bit, and added some celery seed (1/2 tsp) and chili powder (1/2 tsp) .  Other then that,followed the recipe to the letter.  Simmer at the lowest level you have on your stove, and watch it closely.  
Serve it on the freshest, cheapest hamburger buns you can find. Just like Momma used to make!

We make this frequently and my grandchildren beg for it. I incorporate many of the changes mentioned by others depending on what I have in the kitchen. Less sweet? Use less sugar and sub in some molasses. Sub tomato paste for some of the ketchup. Less fat? Use very lean ground beef or ground turkey. Rinse the browned beef with warm water. A little more kick? Sub in some chili sauce or chili powder.
We serve it one of four ways. . .again depending on what's in the house. 1. Sloppy Joes  2. Sloppy Tacos (fun!). 3. Put it in a flat dish and mix up some corn bread, spread it over the top and bake at 400° for 20 min or so  4. Make a nasty old "blue box" of macaroni and cheese. Put it in a flat baking pan. Spread Sloppy Joe mixture on top. Heat at 375° to 400° for 20-30 minutes. (The spicy/sweet and creamy/cheesy play off of each other beautifully!)
Thank you for submitting this recipe and thanks to the rest of you for your great ideas!
NOTES:  I always add 3/4C of finely diced celery. It adds some nutrients, fiber, and moisture and limits the need for additional salt. It doesn't change the taste.
If you want to freeze an extra recipe (or 3!) we find that a slightly mounded 1/3C scoop in a muffin tin is exactly right for a regular hamburger bun. OR place mixture in a ziplock bag and flatten it to the thickness you like on your  bun. Close the bag and chill it. Then score it on the outside in the size you want for your bun and freeze - I use a chopstick for scoring. This has the adv

Slam dunk! EVERYONE enjoyed this recipe. I used ground turkey breast instead of beef. I will make it again the same way for my younger children. Otherwise I'll add cumin to add a little heat .

I rate this a FIVE star. I followed almost to a tee. I didn't have green peppers but had sweet red and yellow peppers. I substituted the green peppers for the red and yellow and it gave it that sweet touch to it. The sauce is perfect because it's not to tomatoey which I really don't like. Great recipe for during the busy week day. My 5 boys ate this up. I made double the recipe and I didn't have left overs.

Would absolutely make this dish again! Entire family enjoys it. 

I do make a few simple changes: 
I scale back a tsp of brown sugar, add some Worcestershire sauce, and fresh dishes tomatoes at the end.

Absolutely delicious.  Made it with turkey instead of beef, and you couldn't tell. ran out of ketchup after about 1/2 cup so I topped the 3/4 up with BBQ and Chili sauce and left the brown sugar out.

These were CRAZY sweet, felt like 3 tsp of brown sugar was way too much. Cut it back to 1 1/4 tsp and it tasted great. The rest of the ingredients went together perfectly.

I could tell the recipe would be way too sweet so I added less ketchup and a can of tomato paste instead of the sugar. Still really sweet!!! Next time even less ketchup.

I thought it was awesome! It sounds good as-is; however, I made a few changes:

A) lean ground turkey in place of beef B) no salt, I just peppered the meat prior to browning
C) I increased the amount of green pepper and onion just because I was feeling lazy
D) Instead of ketchup, I made my own concoction:
- 1 cup tomato paste
- 1 tbsp Splenda for baking
- 1 tsp white vinegar
- 1 cup vegetable stock

I made this for my family and being my son loves "Manwich" from the can... he really liked this recipe... I did not add as much Brown sugar, I only added the sugar until it had that sweet taste the can over kills on .... I felt this gave the dish a good mild flavor of sweetness... balanced flavor... great recipe!

I loved this simple recipe and so did the man.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and I added worchestire to the ground turkey, as well as hot sauce.  Warmed some potato buns for this and had to have more than one.

I made a few changes based on what I had on hand. I omitted the peppers, used 1/2 cup ketchup and about a tablespoon of BBQ sauce. Also added about 2 tablespoons of worcestershire sauce.  I should have doubled the recipe because everyone was looking for more :)

Just a great basic recipe.   As is, it is a little bit sweet for my taste, but always gets eaten.  Only change I make is to drop the brown sugar and cut the ketchup in half, replacing the missing ketchup with barbeque sauce.  This cuts the sweetness.  Since I usually have 5 or 6 BBQ sauces on hand, it gives a fun chance to play with the flavor by choice of sauce or combining them.

This was bland, dry and not at all good. Tasted too much like ketchup. Better off getting a package mix and adding the water, tomato paste and hamburger. The ratings on this recipe are very inaccurate; many gave 5 stars after the recipe was modified. Reviews should be based on original posted recipe.

A great simple, easy, and very quick meal! I added a teaspoon or two of apple cider vinegar for a tiny tang. I also was a little impatient and didn't wait the full 30 minutes for it to simmer. Lol it is the perfect basic sloppy Joe.

This was absolutely delicious!  Just like I remember from childhood.  I used the ingredients exactly as listed.  The only thing I changed was to simmer it for only 20 minutes instead of 30.  It was on the verge of getting too dried out, but at 20 minutes it was perfectly moist.

Only thing I did indifferently is to replace the green pepper with celery, since I didn't have peppers and had the celery. It was delicious, perfect mix/amount of ingredients. My whole family liked it very much and I will definitely make it again.

This is a really good recipe. I tweaked it a little by adding half a jalapeño, and only a half cup ketchup and a quarter cup steak sauce. I'll probably cut the brown sugar back to two teaspoons next time.

This was really good, but like most cooks I tasted and added to suit. I think next time I may add tomato paste to make the sauce have more body. Things I added were beef bouillon base, Worcestershire sauce and molasses. Used red instead of green peppers for my DH.

I'm so glad I found this recipe. This will definitely go into our regular rotation.  I took the advice from a few of the comments (omit brown sugar, add 1/2 cup water, use 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup bbq sauce, 1/4 tsp dry mustard instead of prepared yellow mustard, cook on low for 20 minutes). Next time I'm going to put this in the crockpot to cook for 3-4 hours. Delicious!

Like many on here, I really don't like it when someone reviews something, gives it 5 stars, and then lists the eleventy-bajillion additions/changes they made. As is, it's a very simple, decent sloppy joe recipe. I thought it was a bit too...tangy? The vinegar overtones were too much, so I made the following additions:

I added some worcestershire sauce to mellow it out, some ground mustard, and water to let it cook down and mellow. 

With those additions, it would be a 4 or a 5--but this is a good starter recipe.

Yum yum yum! I haven't had sloppy joes in about 5 years so I couldn't remember what I put in it. This is perfect! I might try it with the barbecue sauce next time but I wanted to make it "as is" and I am not disappointed at all. Definitely a keeper recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I added some tomato paste and minced garlic instead of garlic powder. I also did not have brown sugar so I substituted that with 2 tsps white sugar. Tasted like a delicous homemade sloppy joe dinner.

My 11 year old picked this recipe for his night to cook and (although I helped out some) it turned out great.  We doubled the recipe and instead of ground beef we used meatloaf meat we had on hand.  We will definitely make this again.

Really good.  I added a splash of Worcestershire and mustard powder instead of prepared mustard (didn't realize I was out).

This was a hit with my picky eaters.  I don't like my sloppy joe's too sweet, so I cut the brown sugar to 2 tsp.  I didn't have green pepper, but it was still good without it.  I added some water to thin it a little when simmering.

My family loved this recipe.  They said it's far better than canned Manwich, which their mom used to make.  I substituted a little bit of the ketchup for bottled BBQ sauce and used minced garlic instead of the garlic powder.   Toasting the buns makes it extra delicious.   Will definitely make again.

I have made this 2 times and I still don't like it as is. This time around I added quite a bit of worchesterchire sauce to balance out the sweet ketchup taste that overpowers this dish. I also added very generous amounts of salt and pepper....I will be looking for something without ketchup as the base.

So delicious! Made with 90% lean ground turkey instead of beef and they turned out great and paired perfectly with a wheat bun. Will definitely be using this as a go to recipe from now on!

Didn't have ground beef used a package of ground turkey. Worked just fine. I did add about 1/2 cup of onion and bellpepper and I also added all the ketchup etc. ingriedients to the blender along with a Chipotle pepper and some chipotle sauce from the can. Reduced brown sugar to 2 t and served it over mashed potatoes as I didn't have buns. Delicious! Also add some cayenne to spice it up further. Really good..

Followed the recipe and was quite a bit sweeter than I was expecting/hoping.  Will probably make some big changes if I use the recipe again.

I've made this delicious meal three times and will never buy canned Sloppy Joe sauce again! (Okay, I admit to having bought a can of Manwich during a weak moment at the grocery store, but after taking one bite of the pre-made ground beef "additive", knew I'd be making this homemade version from then on!)

I follow the recipe exactly...almost.  My sweet tooth demands a bit more brown sugar than called for. :-D

Thanks so much for sharing this wonderful treasure with the rest of us!

Doubled recipe, added worcestershire sauce and a bit more "steak" seasoning as it seemed a bit to ketchupy (?) for me. Will try the tomato next time. Over all a good recipe as it was all eaten. Thanks for sharing!

I just made this and threw it in the crock pot as another reviewer suggested, cause that should save me from having to watch over it in case of drying out. It already looked a little dry in the pan and tasted a little sweet, so I added a little more mustard and a teaspoon and a half or so of Worcestershire sauce. Tastes good to me; we'll see how it goes over with the hubby, tho I can't imagine him not liking it.

Very good, basic sloppy joe recipe. It's like my mother used to make , so now i don't buy the cans.  We leave out green pepper, mostly because I don't have it on hand, and decrease the sugar a little. Sometimes I add a little worcestershire, sometimes a little BBQ for part of the ketchup. It's pretty flexible.  One of the recipes all my kids will eat!

I haven't even tasted the recipe yet but I'm giving it 5 stars because we have 3 teenagers that are picky and hate everything. Two of them told me they hate Sloppy Joe sandwiches but I like them so my boyfriend made them for us. Shockingly they all liked them and ate them. This is the first time that has ever happened so this recipe deserves 5 stars.

This was an easy recipe and the whole family liked it. The only changes I made were I used 1lb ground beef and 1lb ground pork. Everything else was by the recipe just doubled. I will make it again.

This is a great, simple meal for the family.  I make it a one-dish meal by cooking the ground beef in a covered baker in my microwave, then drain it and add the other ingredients in and microwave for 5. Minutes more.

Absolutely delicious!! I've made this twice so far and each time, it's just so good! I do end up using a little more onion, ketchup and mustard, but that's just to suit our tastes. IMO this doesn't need any added salt b/c the ketchup adds enough saltiness to it. Really good and will definitely make this again and again.

It was a little on the sweet side but we absolutely loved it! Very easy to make and felt like better option than premade seasonings or sauces.

Liked it much better than commercial sloppy joe canned products, better flavor, easy to make, did add a little more bell peppers with the onion and sauteed down prior to finishing as noted. It doesn't keep long!  lol  We ate it all up! Tasty!

It was very good and will make it again. I thought it was a little too sweet though. Next time I think I will add a tablespoon of Worchestershire sauce and not as much ketchup and brown sugar. Maybe replace some of it with tomato paste.

I made this for my son who really wanted Sloppy Joe's & he loved it! We really liked it too. It reminds me of another one of our favorite recipes that we make often, which we refer to as "Best Ever Meatloaf" you can google it just like that but its a delicious cheesy meatloaf and the sauce topping is ketchup, brown sugar & yellow mustard. I highly recommend it! as for this recipe, I added a half cup of water to 2.5 lb meat version of recipe, I also pretty much always use ground turkey rather than ground beef, in meatloaf too, I've made it both ways but we actually prefer ground turkey to ground beef now. As for reviews that say its too sweet (brown sugar) or not sweet enough, etc., you know your families tastes best :) this type of recipe is simple enough that you can start off with less and add to taste and it won't effect it at all. Thanks for this recipe!

This is a great recipe with caribou bacon-burger with an additional 1/4 tsp of chili powder, and 1/2 cup of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. All of this on top of a baked potatoe instead of bread.

Very good recipe and easy to tweak to your preferences. For this one I use red bell peppers instead of green, which have a bitterness where red ones don't.  I also up the onions and use fresh garlic - double what is listed for garlic powder since powder is stronger than fresh.

I decided to make this into sliders. Best decision! However I probably should have caramelized the onion a little first and then added everything else. It was delicious!

Delicious  and easy, with everyday  ingredients. While it was simmering, I made a kale salad to serve with it. As the rule in our house is to finish eating the salad before the main course, the children gobbled their kale to be able to get their hands on the sloppy joes :)) . But, don't count on  6 servings ! This amount is just enough for 4.

Made exactly as per the recipe, except I used fresh garlic instead of powder, as I only keep fresh on hand. The taste was quite good; however, I think a little bit of water would have made them a bit more "sloppy" like they should be. The mixture was  a touch dry as is. Overall good recipe however. Easy too.

So this is a good place to start but I recommend adding and subtracting things to make it your own. I didn't have the peppers and didn't miss them one bit. I also added a bit of worcestershire and tabasco sauce.

This is a great sloppy joe recipe! I use 1/2c. bbq sauce,  1/2c. ketchup and a little beef broth to make it "sloppier".  My family loves it and both of my teenage boys have made it themselves several times. Fantastic, easy recipe!

We really enjoyed this. Based on some of the reviews I did substitute some BBQ sauce for some of the ketchup. I will not be buying the canned sloppy joe mix anymore.

Sloppy Joe's aren't my personal favorite but my brother loves them. I made this recipe for the first time and it was super easy. I did make a few adjustments to meet his palate. First, I added just a touch of olive oil to the pan to add texture to the meat. I also added less onion since he's not a huge fan but added just a hint of onion powder. I added salt and pepper to the meat as it was browning to give it a deeper flavor. As that was browning, I personally prefer to add the sauce ingredients in a separate bowl and whisk them so they fully incorporate together. I added all of the ingredients including about three tablespoons BBQ sauce. That really made the difference! I added it to the meat, onions and peppers and left it on low for the recommended 30 mins. I steamed some slider buns and he LOVED it! It was so easy and most of the ingredients we had at the house. I highly recommend it!!

Making this for the 3rd time. My family loves it, it's the real old-fashioned sloppy joe.  I did add a little bit of molasses, just because we all like it and 1 stalk of celery chopped fine just to add some veggies.  I'm going to add 1 Tbl of vinegar this time to add a little tang.

I've made the recipe earlier exactly as it is posted and it's perfect as is.

Great great. I have made this for the last 5 years. For my family as well as my Firehouse. Have made it exactly the way this says and is great. But I have been expanding it. Add 1/2 lb of chopped up skirt steak, way more peppers and onions (all three colors) and shaved fresh garlic. Just add 2 more teaspoons of brown sugar and another 1/4 cup of ketchup. Give it a try it's great both ways.

Very easy, fairly mild, but tasty. Doubled onions and green peppers. Can use ground beef or ground turkey. Added 1/8 tsp black pepper, and 1/8 tsp salt.

I agree with other comments about adding other ingredients - one I suggest is BBQ sauce if your goal was to reproduce Manwhich.

I've been using this recipe since I first taught myself to cook at about 14-15, and it's one of the few that have stuck without getting any changes! Long standing favorite, so easy. Hardest thing is waiting for it to simmer!

Picky eater, Kid Teated, and Approved! My 7-year-old, somewhat picky eater son, ate three servings of this tonight! "Best Dinner Ever Mom." I followed the instructions, with the exception of exchanging two small fresh crushed garlic cloves for the garlic powder, and only cooking an extra 10-15 min for the wet ingredients to soak into the beef.

I really loved this recipe! My boyfriend likes his sloppy Joe to be a little more tangy and spicy then sweet, so I end up adding 2 tablespoons of vinegar and I mince a few pickled jalapeños to add to it. 
Sooo delicious!

Very easy to make, and the taste is delicious!  I used an orange bell pepper instead, and added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce after reading some of the reviews, and don't know how much it altered the taste, but it was really good.  Served this up with some coleslaw and sliced cucumbers on the side.  Will definitely make again.

Great simple recipe! Ive always used the pkg mix, but I didn't have one on hand. Probably will make my own from now on. I used an extra teaspoon and a half of brown sugar for my taste. I think I will try ketchup and a little BBQ sauce next time and omit the brown sugar. Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

This has been a go to recipe for when we have guests for lunch.  I usually double the recipe and there is plenty to feed 4 adults generous portions.  I make it with an Asian salad on the side.  It makes for a filling and simple lunch.

Any time I make sloppy joes this is the recipe that I turn to. Like many others I double the sauce, but I also add a few shakes of worstershire sauce. I believe it adds to the flavor, my kids love it.

Delicious. Super simple. I used this as a recipe base that I used to use and needed a helpful reminder. I followed recipe except only added 1 tbsp brown sugar and added a squirt of yellow mustard, also cheated and used minced onion bc I'm just not good at cutting small. Definitely making again, everything on hand in cupboard.

Great recipe! I have been making Manwich for years and I never liked it, but I love sloppy joes. I am so happy you shared this recipe, it was awesome! Thanks!

Best. sloppy. joes. ever.   I made the following changes:

1) I used three minced garlic cloves instead of reconstituted and I sauteed it with the ground beef, onions and green pepper.
2) I used 3/4 cup of diced onion and green pepper 
3) I used SPICY BROWN MUSTARD instead of plain
4) I doubled the sauce, which produced the perfect meat to sauce ratio.  

So good, they're on the menu for next week, as well!

So easy to make.  Had to make for family of eight, didn't have dry mustard. Used Manwich with extra ketchup, added orange pepper. Family loved it.

Hands down the BEST Sloppy Joe recipe I've ever had. My whole life I hated (beyond hated) Sloppy Joe...I now know why: because no one made this recipe. It's absolutely fantastic!!!! I make this at least once a week and it's always a smash hit.

I love this recipe! I added yellow, red, and orange bell peppers with the green peppers. I also substituted fresh garlic! Such an easy recipe to make. Thank you for sharing!!

...And 1 year later, this recipe is THE go-to for a fast, easy, and delicious meal. So simple and so many people asking for the recipe. I will be making this forever!!

This recipe is so easy and so tasty. I did make a few changes to used ingredients I had on hand. I used fresh garden chili mild-spicy peppers instead of the green bell pepper, dry mustard instead of prepared and fresh minced garlic instead of powdered. I added a dash or two of hot pepper sauce. My husband says this is a keeper. I think the brown sugar is a secret ingredient for this recipe. Yummy.

Just made this exactly as written, well kind of, and LOVED IT! 

I made a few changes, (one  by mistake).  Like another reviewer, I used 1/2  cup of ketchup and 1/4 cup of bbq  sauce.  The 2nd was that I read the recipe wrong and after adding (2) tablespoons of  brown sugar, realized it was only (3) teaspoons.  I also added a little bit of water, to thin just a tad, to make a little more loose!  No matter though, it was delicious to me and I absolutely loved it!  Put it on a grilled onion roll with a slice of American cheese on the bottom roll!  Ate  with sweet potato fries.  OMG...so yummy!  Thank you for sharing!  This is now my Sloppy Joe go to recipe!  :-)

This is really good and really easy to make! The only thing I do differently is I use 1/2 a cup of ketchup and add 1/2 a cup of tomato sauce. I find that just using 3/4 of a cup of ketchup leaves this on the dry side. I also use minced garlic instead of garlic powder. When I added in the tomato sauce, my husband actually thought I had bought the canned version because it tasted so similar!

While my kids didn't care for it, I enjoyed it.  I increased the amount of green pepper and onions to a 1/3 cup each.  I also added 1/8 cup of Worcestershire sauce and used stone ground mustard in place of prepared mustard.

I got up early to make this for a pitch in at church. I made this as it is written. I used 6 pounds of hamburger so I multiplied the ingredients by 6. The only thing I do not like is the overwhelming mustard taste. We all stood around the skillet, individual spoon in hand & tried it. TOO MUCH MUSTARD. I've put extra brown sugar & 2 oz. of tomatoe paste & it's better but the mustard taste still lays on the back of your tongue. I hope they like it at church. If the mustard was omitted in the recipe I would've given it 5 stars.

This recipe was great! I added about 1/2 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce (personal preference, but you can add a little more) and a dash of hickory liquid smoke flavoring. These changes added a greater depth of flavor and made it a 5 star recipe!

I decided to make this , for the first time, at the last moment for our supper.  We LOVED it!  I had to use dehydrated onions, versus  a fresh onion, because of one family member.  But, I think the final taste was probably the same.  It was simple and I had all the ingredients.  Thank you so much for this!  It will definitely become a family favorite.

This was a very good recipe. I did take advice from other reviewers and cut down on the brown sugar. I added a little more mustard and some Worchestershire sauce and some red wine vinegar. It was delicious. I'm sure a lot of it depends on your taste so for some the original recipe is probably perfect. We like things a little less sweet and with a little more acid.

Delicious!  I went EXACTLY BY THE RECIPE!  I did add 1/2 cup water, after adding the ingredients.  This turned out wonderful.  This really and truly was absolutely delicious!  I will be making this again.  Five stars!  :-)

Great recipe and real easy to make! Made the changes that a few people suggested of only using 1/2 a cup of ketchup and adding 1/4 cup of bbq sauce, left out the brown sugar and added some cayenne pepper to give it a little zing. Homemade sloppy joes are SO much better than the ones I've tried at school and from a can. I can no longer say that I dislike sloppy joes. Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

I just made this for dinner tonight, and it was perfection!  Thick, chunky, not-too-sloppy joe sauce that matched perfectly with the macaroni noodles I boiled up on the side.  Super simple to throw together; I already had all the ingredients at home.  I can't wait to make this one again!

My daughter and I just made this for dinner.  We both agreed that this recipe is a keeper and is super yummy.    I know that it isn't exactly fair to rate a recipe after altering it, but because we didn't have a bell pepper at home it didn't make it into the skillet.

It has good flavor, but as some have mentioned it is too sweet for my taste. I just added about four dashes of Worcestershire sauce and it made it better. I think the next time I make it I will only use one tsp of sugar, keep the Worcestershire sauce, and increase the ketchup to a full cup.

I made these Sloppy joes tonight but substituted the ground beef for lean turkey and the green bell pepper for sweet mini orange peppers I also added 2 spoons of dijon mustard, 2 spoons of brown sugar and 1 spoon of Minced garlic. I think this recipe was good but not my favorite or the Sloppy joes I remember as a kid. Let's all be honest nothing says Sloppy joes like the canned version .

My grandkids loved this recipe. It was easy to prepare. I did cut the peppers and onions small because the grandkids would pick them out if the veggies were large. The onion gave the sloppy joes a good flavor.

This recipe was awesome! Me and my mom (I'm 16) made this but added our own things to it. We added some BBQ Sauce, Red Cayenne Pepper,  Chili Pepper, and Adobo powder. This made it more tangy than sweet, and it came out great!

I tried this recipe and hubby actually think it tastes better than Manwich. I cooked the recipe exactly except for substituting red peppers for green peppers. (It's what I had on hand). Although I did put this in a crockpot on low for three hours. Coming from a family of Southern cooks who likes their barbecue sweeter next time I will add an additional 1/4 c brown sugar (I added the same amount to every can of Manwich). Hubby prefers the recipe as written so I'm rating it four stars. Today I'm making a larger batch (5 pounds hamburger) and planning to freeze it to make this as convenient as keeping Manwich on hand.

I give it five stars. It was a simple ingredient easy to make and gave me plenty of left overs. My boyfriend is picky with what he eats and has had some nasty homemade sloppy Joe's. He loved what I made. I didn't fully follow the recipe. I used honey mustard for sweetness instead of brown sugar and instead of ketchup I used chopped tomatoes in sauce and jack Daniels spicy and bold bbq sauce. I also added red pepper for flavor along with the green pepper. The combo made a semi sweet and spicy tomato sauce that thickened to make the perfect sloppy joe!

This is absolutely delicious.  That said, I omitted the brown sugar, as we don't care for a lot of sweetness in our dishes.  Upon tasting it, I added an extra tsp. mustard, and one Tbs.  Worcestershire!  I will make this over and over!  Love it!!

My family loved it! My 3 year old ate the whole thing. I did however substitute 1/3 tsp organic ground mustard for the squeeze kind. I also added a drizzle of Worcestershire sauce during the simmering process. We will definitely be making this again.

This recipe reminded me of one of my mom's go to recipes when I was a child. I made it with the exact ingredients but since I wanted it to simmer a bit I added 1/4 cup water so it would not dry out.

I tripled the recipe. I only put in 2 tbsp of brown sugar and found it disgustingly sweet. So I tried tempering it with some extra mustard and buffalo wing sauce I had on hand. I also added smoked paprika and cayenne to spice it up a bit. Next time I make this I'll completely omit the brown sugar.

I used fresh chopped garlic instead of garlic powder and cooked it with the ground beef and onions.

This is the best sloppy joe sandwich I've ever had. I follow the recipe really closely. I love it.  Add a little Worcestershire sauce and a little vinegar for more flavor. Just a little.

REALLY good! Followed another reviewers idea to triple the recipe for two pounds of meat. I ended up adding a little water for liquid before simmering. Turned out excellent!

I doubled the recipe for my family of 6. I however did not double the ketchup, instead added in chili sauce for the double. I also added extra garlic powder and extra black pepper too. One thing I would suggest is not to drain your meat completely ( I saved about 1/2 cup liquid)  I also used 95% lean ground beef so it was not greasy. The extra liquid is needed so your sauce doesn't dry out, it is after all it's called  "Sloppy" Joe. It turned out delicious. No more ready made canned sauce !

My husband loves it and it was well received at our church pot luck for the Fourth of July. I will definitely make it again. Only change I made was red peppers instead of green peppers. I double doubled the recipe and I think I may have put in extra sauce, but that certainly didn't hurt it!

This has been our go-to recipe for a while now. So simple, fast, budget-friendly, and tasty! We make this recipe vegan by adding Beyond Meat beefy crumbles in place of the hamburger and we increase the amount of the onions and peppers slightly since we like things to be veggie-heavy.  Thanks for posting it!

This is a great recipe. It's quick and my family loves it. I didn't have a green pepper the first time I made it, but I had a red sweet pepper. I like it better with the red pepper.

I added a bit of water as it simmered twice at the end to keep it from scorching, and that did the trick without making it "loose" and messy to eat. I just cooked it until the water was gone but the tomatoey sauce was darker and tastier.

Tastes much like manwich.  I use to buy manwich, it got to be too expensive.  I added a teaspoon of Worcester sauce.  Will make this again.

Easy and very simple.  Used celery and BBQ sauce since I didn't have green peppers and ketchup; also used ground turkey vs ground beef.   Served over rice, since we don't eat a lot of bread in our family....Awesome meal.  Will make again

Omg! This is so good! Growing up my mom wasn't one to make things from scratch, sloppy joes were always made using Manwich and I loved every bite (not knowing any better of course) but my sophisticated grown up palate can appreciate the simplicity and deliciousness of this recipe. I planned to make it exactly as described but realized I was lacking the green pepper. Hubby agreed that even with out the pepper, this still tasted great! Filing  this in my recipe book as a keeper :)

Really delicious! I didn't have green peppers so I used tomatoes instead. Still good! It was a bit sweeter than most sloppy joe's I've eaten, so I may use reduced sugar ketchup next time.

Added some Worcestershire to the mix and put real garlic into the meat mixture. Didn't really use the exact recipe amounts since I was making enough for 30 people, but did it to taste.   Made a large batch for a birthday party and it was a hit!

This was really good and easy! Instead of using regular ketchup I used jalapeno ketchup and omitted the sugar. This is going into my recipe book

This was the perfect recipe!  The only thing I added was a little more ketchup and a dash or to of Worcestershire sauce.

I'm not a huge sloppy joe fan. I just have never really enjoyed them. Until now. My husband wanted sloppy joes for dinner  and I figured that I had tortured him with a lot of chicken recently, so I came to look. I had everything but the bell pepper so  I figured I'd give it a shot. We all loved it. Even my recently-picky son inhaled it. My anti-sloppy joe self? I'm looking forward to lunch tomorrow!

I measured out the ketchup and then eyeballed the rest. Served it on potato buns and it was incredible. I knew it was really good when my husband mentioned that maybe I should make it for his coworkers during their next busy time and they don't have time to leave for lunch. That's one heck of a compliment!

This went pretty well at my company potluck. I saw a few people go back for seconds, which is always the ultimate compliment. A few said nice things about it. All in all, it was a pretty solid dish but nothing remarkable. In all fairness, I omitted the green pepper because I can not tolerate green pepper so maybe I needed to find something to replace that. It was pretty good. I wish it packed a little more flavor and stuck together a little better but for a last minute dinner, this is a great recipe.

Really enjoy this recipe, my sons are picky so when they can agree on something it makes it ten times easier for my husband and I when it comes to dinner time.

With this recipe I tend to add a bit more of the spices, garlic powder especially, but I also add a few squirts of Swwet Baby Rays honey BBQ sauce, it doesn't give it a BBQ taste, but it adds a touch of smokiness that we really enjoy! Thanks for creating this recipe! :-)

I thought this was delicious!  I followed some of the changes recommended by other reviewers because I thought I would like them.  I made 1-1/2 times the sauce, used 1/2 c ketchup and 1/4 c BBQ sauce instead of all ketchup and no brown sugar because of the sweetness added by the BBQ sauce.  I also added a couple of TB water so there would be enough juice to let it simmer at least 20 minutes.  I am freezing a couple of portions and expect it to work great.  Next time I will double the recipe as I wanted more leftovers!

This was so easy to make and was so delicious! I don't cook very often so wanted to make something that was not too complicated and this filled the bill! Served it with homemade coleslaw that my daughter and I ate on the side and my husband put on top of the barbecue. We were all so pleased with how good it was!

Delicious!  The only change I'd make would be to drain the grease from the beef and onion mixture before adding the other ingredients to cut down on the fat.

This is a very yummy sloppy joe recipe. I did have to add about 1/2 a cup water to be able to simmer it for a half hour. It would have been very very dry otherwise.

Good, quick, basic sloppy joe, without being too saucy. It was too sweet for me, but it it perfect with a few minor adjustments for next time, maybe 1/3 of the brown sugar, though might even omit because of the sugar in ketchup.

This is an absolute staple in our house. The kids will no longer eat canned and my pickiest will even eat the green peppers. We like our sloppy joes extra saucy so we double the ketchup, mustard, garlic powder and brown sugar.

This is a really great sloppy joe recipe. I was trying to figure out what to do w/ a lb of ground beef & thankfully I remembered I had saved this recipe a while back. Soooo good! Making them this way is far better than the canned version! I did omit the sugar as the 1/4 c of bbq sauce I used had brown sugar in it. I also used 1/2 c of ketchup based on other reviews. Perfection :)

This was the BEST sloppy joe I ever had! The loved ones said add this to the dinner menu, followed recipe I only had ground veal so I used that and added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce. Trust me with this recipe you will never buy another can of sloppy joe sauce again!

I followed the recipe exactly, I can see how some people thought it was to sweet, we thought it was good though. Maybe add the Brown Sugar a little at a time and taste as you go. For the ketchup I used Wild Tree Organic Ketchup. I served this on plain white Buns with a slice of Sharp Cheddar and a pickle with Fries on the side. Lots of flavor, a filling meal, I saved this and will make again. Thanks!

I made this twice.  First time I thought it was too ketchupy.  Second time I followed another reviewer's suggestion  and used 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/4 bbq sauce.  Outstanding! I also used Dijon mustard because that's what I had on hand and about 1/2 chopped jalapeno instead of bell pepper.  Never buying canned stuff again!

Whoa, I haven't had sloppy joes in a loooong time, I was never that fond of them. But I needed something to do with ground beef and this popped up. I figured, 5k mainly positive reviews can't be bad. This is freaking delicious. It's on the sweeter side (I may or may not have measured the sugar less than accurately due to a toddler climbing my leg and distracting me) but I think it's really good that way. I haven't waited to see what the picky kids think, I can't really care tonight. Followed the instructions, aside from lessening the simmering time. I cut it to 20 minutes because it was getting dry and we were hungry. :)

Personally I'm not a fan of sloppy joes, but my husband loves them. So when I found this recipe, I decided to give it a try for his sake. I really liked the flavor of this! I didn't measure the brown sugar & added too much & it made it a little too sweet. I added a little water to make it a little more sloppy. I only simmered for 20 minutes. He asked what brand sauce I had used & I said 'Amy's brand'. Will use this recipe again & I may make it for a church dinner!

Made exactly as recipe states except for no green peppers (none in the house). I think it was very delicious and my kids LOVED it.  I cut sub rolls in half and hollowed them out and filled with the "joe" filling to make it less messy to eat and served them with a big salad.   I will definitely make them again.

More healthy & tasty than  the Sloppy Joe packets you can buy at the store.  I add a little extra mustard & brown sugar to give it more zip!

My family loved it. Easy to make. I did follow others lead and replaced some of the ketchup with BBQ.

No more canned Manwich... this is the real deal here! Loved how it was made with ketchup & how it has ingredients that you most likely already have on hand. This was easy, fun, & fast. I only made 3 changes. 1) I cut back to 1 tsp. brown sugar. 2) I used 1 cup ketchup HEINZ! 3) I used 1/4 cup BBQ sauce KC Masterpiece. And I used jalapenos instead of green pepper. This is tangy, bold this way. Thanx for submitting!!

This is my go-to recipe whenever I make Sloppy Joe's, and when I make them for people who've never had them before (which is often, as I live overseas), everyone who's tried them loves them!  I use slightly less brown sugar than the recipe calls for, so that the sweetness isn't overwhelming, otherwise I make no substitutions.

This was delicious!  I made it almost exactly as written except I added a can of baked brown beans because I love those.  Will definitely make this again - and double the amount as we had no leftovers!

I really liked this recipe, but I did make a couple changes per other reviews. I added about 1/2 cup of water since it was so thick and I cut my brown sugar down to 2 teaspoons, but it was still a little too sweet for me so I added a dash of Worcestershire sauce and hot sauce to balance out the sweetness.

Simply Amazing and it WILL be made many times over again.  We might be a little heavy on the onion as compared to the original recipe, but the added flavor is well worth it!

This is perfect for children's taste, but to bump it up a notch to an adult palate the Worcestershire sauce makes it! My old recipe used it, but I made this one exactly as directed, then took a portion out and added the sauce to it. Took it right over the edge to outstanding! I will be using this as my standard recipe from now on.

I made this exactly by the recipe except for just a dash of cinnamon (personal preference). This was the best sloppy joe recipe I have tried. I cook for ten men on a working boat and they loved it.

What I love about this recipe is the flavor of the sloppy joes is there, but without all the mess.  The sauce isn't soupy, but actually helps to keep all the ingredients together.  Its easy to make and so very good.  This will be one I make again.  Thanks!

I loved this recipe!  I used ground turkey instead and it was still just as delicious!  I also added a little more brown sugar and some ginger to bring out the sweetness (since the 3 tsp didn't really do much for me), a Thai chili pepper for spice, and paprika for that smokey taste all to liven it up some.  My fiancé absolutely loved it and said he prefers I make the sauce from now on instead of buying it.

i can't say I'm a sloppy joe afficionado but this really turned out as advertised.  The amount of ketchup was right on.  Before the last 15 minutes of simmering it needed some more brown sugar, I added 3 more teaspoons. Perfect.  You know sometimes you can get a sloppy joe mix that is just a bit running, not the case here.   Great recipe!

This is great, but I only add the brown sugar to taste. Otherwise it is too sweet for us. I've omitted the green pepper as well, but really it just depends on if I have it on hand or not. I don't think it makes such a huge difference in this recipe. My daughter loves Sloppy Joe night with this recipe! Thanks!

Easy.  I used lean ground beef with an oil called Bloody Mary.  I also added Red Pepper Flakes to give it a bite.  Broiled the bun with mozzarella cheese.  Perfect.  Not too sweet at all.

This was super yummy! My husband and my kiddos ate it right up. I did make some changes. One was no green pepper only because I didn't have any. I also added 2 tsp, instead of the 1 tsp, of mustard because of others comments about the sweetness. And i added a 1/4 cup of beef broth because of comments about the dryness.  This was fast, easy, and so delicious!

Back in the day we had no mixes for sloppy joes so all were made from "scratch". This is by far the very best "scratch" recipe I have ever had for sloppy joes. Only changes were celery instead of green pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and cut down on the brown sugar. Very good and very easy!!

Just as it says - a good, tasty and basic recipe.  Easy and quick, uses ingredients on hand.  Used celery instead of green pepper due to allergies and used fresh garlic.  Will use this one again.

I've made this twice now and we loved it.  I've never been a fan of the canned varieties, but hadn't made it myself until this, so I was happy to find that the first recipe I tried was good. The only thing I did different was using a red bell pepper instead of green, just because I don't care for them personally, and I don't think it affected the recipe at all probably. I liked that this recipe was not overly sweet like some of the versions I've had in the past. I tried doubling it and freezing half for later last time, so hopefully it will thaw/reheat well too.

It was a little sweet, but  once I added some more garlic powder and nature season, it tasted much better. The taste also reminds me of the Polynesian sauce at Chick-fil-A .

This is a great recipe. It was a bit too sweet for us the first time I made it, so the second time I skipped the sugar and it was much better. I also didn't have any green pepper, and it didn't seem to make a difference in the flavor. For those watching their salt and/or sugar/HFCS intake, skip the commercial ketchup and make your own. It is just tomato paste, water, vinegar, sugar, salt, and onion/garlic powder. Making your own will allow you to control the amount of salt and sugar.

My whole family loved this recipe. I made it tonight and it turned out amazing. However I did add some honey bbq sauce to it to help decrease the ketchup taste a little bit and I added more brown sugar and mustard to give it more of a sweet n tangy flavor :)

This was an unexpectedly flavorful recipe. I grew up with sloppy joes that had a tomato paste/ sauce base rather than ketchup! I was a bit doubtful but it turned out to be delicious! I loved the small crunch of flavor that the green bell pepper added .I also got a bit exuberant with the mustard, with may have added a minor kick. ;) My family loved it!

I don't know why I've been buying canned. We subbed a few things- minced garlic instead of powdered, most of the ketchup for marinara (ran out) and it was still pretty good. The real plus is the kids can make this themselves. For that reason alone, we give it five stars!

I used dry mustard because that is what I had I on hand, omitted the sugar, and added the last few dashes of A1 sauce just so I could throw out the bottle. It was wonderful. I also put about a half cup of water so it wouldnt dry out when simmering. The green pepper was cut so fine that it disappeared in the slop and my kids didn't know that it was there. Yay! It couldn't have been easier.

Very easy to make. I skipped the bell pepper and doubled the onion. It was a little bit on the sweet side so I would skip the sugar next time as well.

I don't care for sweet meat that much but it was a good start. Maybe add some vinegar & more mustard to make it tangier. I also added two shredded carrots to stretch the meal.

I have made this recipe for 2 years now and have loved it every time! I wanted sloppy Joes and cooked up the hamburger meat. then I realized we were out of the Sloppy Joe cans. I started researching recipes and due to the ratings and few ingredients I made it. it was a hit! I've never considered buying the can again. When I see the cans it reminds me how much better this recipe is. :)

My boyfriend is a very picky eater and I love using this site to find new things to try. I made this as directed tasted the meat and ended up adding a little extra mustard and ketchup and a pinch more brown sugar. My boyfriend LOVED it and ate all the left overs himself.

I've made this for about 40 years....a staple when the kids were young because I could always keep some in the freezer.  However, giving 5 stars but I've always added lemon juice to give the browns sugar sweetness a little tart.  With that addition, it's a 5, otherwise I'd give it a 4 as written.

This recipe was absolutely delicious. I did make a few changes. I took another reviewers advice and I substituted some of the ketchup with bbq sauce which eliminated the need for the sugar. I also used a jalapeño because i like my food a bit spicy. I also substituted 1 cup of the ground beef for a cup of bacon bits. I cooked the bacon bits in a separate pot and when my beef was browned I drained the water and added it to the pot with the bacon. it added a wonderful crunchy elements which i enjoyed. yes not the conventional sloppy Joe but I like to make twists on recipes. I completely recommend you try this recipe it is amazing and I definitely make again

I have been making this recipe for at least 3 years now. I always double the recipe. you dont need to change a thing. tastes great as is, is super simple to make and comes out everytime. I like to toast the buns in the oven before serving. never buy that man which  sauce. you already have everything in the cupboard to whip up this easy yummy dish

This recipe was great! I made it with ground turkey and 2 people in my family thought it was beef.  I followed a reviewers advise and added some crushed red pepper flakes and about a tablespoon of worcestershire  sauce. This recipe is a keeper!

I made this yesterday and my husband said it was by far the best sloppy joe he'd ever had.  My daughter's and I renamed the recipe to "Sloppy Does" though, since I made it with venison :) We also left out the green pepper, because no one in our house really has a liking for it. 
This is going to be a new staple in our house!

This is a good easy recipe, instead of Garlic Powder I put real garlic in it instead. I also put bacon in it.

Really good.  Gave it four stars because it was a little sweet with 3 teaspoons brown sugar.  Next time will only use 2 teaspoons.  Other than that, easy, quick and good!

Have made several times now.  My picky hubby likes it, and so do I!  Only change I make is to decrease the brown sugar a smidge because hubby does like a little less sweet. I, however, love it as written!

I am not a huge sloppy joe's fan but I thought I would give this recipe a try. And it was delicious. The only thing I changed was I add malt vinegar to the dish.

This is a great recipe for sloppy joes. Used red bell pepper, 1/4 cup barbecue and 1/2 cup ketchup, and omitted the brown sugar, as the only subs, based on ingredients on hand. Thanks for sharing

Found this in allrecipes magazine. I now know it by heart I have made it so many times. It is so versatile. I try to abstain from gluten for health reasons so I put this on baked potatoes with cheese on top. It also freezes well, and I often make a double batch to take to family and friends.

Used turkey instead of beef. 1 T. brown sugar. Simmered for 15 minutes. Good with vegetable chips on the side.

Awesome recipe! I only added a bit of crushed red pepper to taste otherwise I followed it verbatim. Let it simmer as the instructions suggested and the flavors grew rich and absolutely delicious. Its always a great feeling when dinner is made, placed on the table, and everything is eaten...no leftovers. Hooray!!  Thanks for sharing your fabulous recipe.

My husband likes these, and they are really good.  I really, really dislike the canned sloppy joe mix you can buy at the grocery store, so I think this recipe is pretty darn fantastic when you compare the two .  A little on the sweet side, but you can cut back on the brown sugar if that's not your thing.  My son REALLY likes these, but you know kids and sugar...

I did add some smoked paprika but that's my vice at the moment.

Was good, but too sweet and ketchupy for me. Added some chilli powder and beef oxo to round it out a bit.  Next time will put 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup BBQ sauce and see what happens.

My husband and I loved this recipe, it was really good! I, being a distracted cook, accidentally added 3 T instead of t of brown sugar... Luckily I was using a little more than a pound of ground turkey to begin with. I also increased my ketchup, mustard and spices a bit, and also added Worcestershire sauce to help balance out my mistake! 

I'm looking forward to trying this again with the correct amounts because I'm sure it will be even more delicious!

WOW! This is surprisingly good. I would definitely make it again. 
But I think it tastes a little better if you eat it right when it is ready.

This is the best Sloppy Joe recipe anywhere!  I added approximately 1/3 cup of water just to get the consistency right for my palette.  Next time I will reduce 3 tsps of brown sugar to 1 rounded tsp.  Will never buy Manwich again!

I agree with the mind set that food doesn't have to be fancy to receive a 5 star rating. This is easy, uses readily available ingredients, and my kids all pronounced it "yummy." That makes it my fave sloppy joe recipe so far, and a 5 star in my book. I didn't change anything except for leaving out the bell pepper, as my family doesn't like them. I would think they would only add to the flavor for those who do. Thanks for a great recipe!

The flavor of this is great - It's spot on.  Might just be the way I remember it as a kid, but I like my sloppy joe to be runnier with  a real tomato component to it, so I added some left over plain canned tomato sauce and canned diced tomatoes (in all, maybe a 50/50 split of each, totaling ~1 1/4 cup). This dilutes the awesome flavor though, so I had to up all the ingredients to get it back to how it was. The sauce and the tomatoes addition make it truly 'sloppy'! Also used Beyond Beef crumbles (it's made from pea protein, and then added 1/4 c water to give more moisture) since our family isn't huge on real ground beef. Served on slightly toasted buns with mac 'n' cheese. Yum.

Very good, the next time I will use hotdog buns to take the sloppy out of it.

Much much better than the canned sloppy joe mix. I am the only one in the house that will eat sloppy joes so I was excited to try it. I was not disappointed. Made it just like it was written and loved it!

Great recipe but it is quite a small one. I doubled it or tripled it both times I made it, depending on the amount of ground beef  I had. I actually measured it - when I did 2.5x the recipe I got exactly ten 1/2 cup portions which makes a generous but not too-sloppy Sloppy Joe. I doubled the garlic powder just because I think there is no such thing as too much garlic, and replaced 1/3 of the ketchup with BBQ sauce. I think it would be definitely too sweet with only ketchup, and in fact was plenty sweet as is, plus the BBQ sauce adds rich flavours. Next time will cut brown sugar in half. No salt as there is plenty in bbq sauce, ketchup etc. Also like many others I added about 1/3 c water per "recipe" in order to cook it for the 30 min. We served it on toasted buns with garlic parmesean mayo and shredded cheese. Our whole family loved it!

Best sloppy joe recipe I've tried.  My husband and I both love it.  It's actually my husband's favorite meal.  I don't change a thing other than omit onion and peppers because I'm not a fan of either.

Loved it and is on the sweet side but easily adjusted but doubling mustard (more tang) and halving the brown sugar.

My kids love when I make these Sloppy Joes. Lately, I have been very lazy and only make the sauce - with ketchup, brown sugar, and mustard - and mix this in with the cooked ground beef. Sometimes if I am in a hurry, I don't even season the beef, and I just let everything cook together on the stove for about 5 more minutes. Doesn't matter, still tastes great!

Excellent recipe. I have made this twice so far and everyone is always impressed by how much better it tastes than when you use the typical canned sauces for sloppy joes (plus making anything from scratch usually comes off as impressive.) I omitted the green pepper just because I think they are disgusting and I added a little bit of Frank's Red Hot Sauce just for a bit more flavor. I highly recommend giving this recipe a shot!

This was delicious. At the last minute I realized that I didn't have enough ketchup. Also I read the other reviewers comments about it being too sweet. I tripled the recipe, so I used a large can of Italian crushed tomatoes, some ketchup and some honey BBQ sauce, and some red wine vinegar. I didn't really measure. Also added a little liquid smoke. Love not using sauce from a jar. Think I will make it this way from now on!

I was craving a really good sloppy joe and decided to make it using this recipe.  We loved it!  My husband is picky about sloppy joe recipes but he loved this one!  If he loves it, it's definitely a good recipe.

My family and I loved this recipe! It is so good to finally find a recipe that is easy to make and tastes so delicious! The only tweak I made was to add a little water while simmering.  I will never buy canned sloppy joes again!

The BEST Sloppy Joes!  My family loves them and they are picky eaters.  I did change it up a bit.  Per another reviewers suggestion I put 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup barbecue sauce.   It was delicious!  This is my 'go to' recipe!

I grew up with sloppy joes so when I came across this recipe I decided to try it, I added a few extra squirts of ketchup mustard and brown sugar since I love a good strong flavor:) This recipe has been the best by far, nothing but compliments and it's quick and easy to make!!

I'm only giving this recipe 4 stars because it was a bit dry... its either something I did or the recipe is kind of dry. Either way it was very flavorful.

Awesome. Changed it a bit. Added puréed sweet potato to up the protein. Didn't have ketchup so I used 2/3 cup Catalina dressing, used fancy mustard instead of yellow mustard. Added sweet peppers and 1/4 green bell pepper. Cut very finely. (Kid friendly)

This is good.  Added the same amount of ketchup, but also I added one can of tomato sauce and a bit of chili powder, but otherwise cooked it as is.   It's nice to have on a busy night for a change of pace.

This was a good basic recipe. I read other reviews saying it was too sweet so I skipped the brown sugar. I put in a little bbq sauce and the rest ketchup. Ketchup has sugar already in it so it was sweet without the added sugar. I also added a tbs of Worcestershire sauce. I would make it again.

Good recipe!  My grandson (14) wanted to make Manwich tonight and I handed him this recipe. He made a wonderful, fast dinner that the whole family enjoyed. He saw how easy it is to cook real food and said the flavor was a lot better than the canned stuff. I call this a win-win!

This was a much better option than the store bought mix! I only made one adjustment, swapping about 1/3 of the ketchup for Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce.Otherwise, I stayed true to the recipe. Everyone who tried it rated it a 5. This one is definitely a keeper for a quick and easy weeknight meal.

I had been gifted 10 lbs of ground beef I could not refreeze, so I cooked it all at one in my slow cooker for crumbles and used a portion for sloppy joes I could refreeze for no cook dinner nights.  This was easy peasy, I did add chopped red pepper because I had a bunch on hand...very good basic recipe.

I've made this recipe several times and we love it.  The only changes I make are to substitute red peppers instead of green only because my family does not care for green peppers, and add extra ketchup.  I will never buy canned sloppy joes again!

Made this today... It's a keeper. I doubled the onions and the green peppers (1/2 cup each), added a teaspoon of dijon mustard in addition to the yellow mustard, and had an "oops" moment with the brown sugar so I'm pretty sure I put a tad more than the outlined 3 teaspoons. Overall, it was deeeeeeelicious!

I hadn't had a sloppy joe sinnce I was a kid. I saw this recipe and it made me want to have one. I wasn't overly impressed but I blame that on a comparison to my childhood. things always tasted better when we were kids! lol. This was pretty good though. I'd make it again for an easy weeknight meal.

This was a simple and delicious recipe. Next time, I'll skip the peppers as I didn't really like the combo, but great overall.

Fast and easy to make. We loved this recipe, but also discussed adding more peppers or jalapeño to cut the sweetness with a little more heat.

I'm tempted to give this 3 stars since it's too sweet, even after cutting the brown sugar to 1 t.  My husband has a sweet tooth and liked it, though, so I'll go with 4.  No one could really tell there were peppers in it, so I'll definitely use those in the future to add more nutrition.

Amazing!!! Only changes I made was I used crushed garlic and let it cook with the peppers and onions first and because of another users review I used 1/2 cup ketchup and about a 1/4 cup barbaque sauce. This deserves an A++++++

I double this recipe when I make it so we'll have leftovers. We like it spicier rather than sweet so I do not double the brown sugar, and I add 2 teaspoons of chili powder. I also add in just a bit more than double of the onion and green pepper.

Great recipe! Delicious. Used 1/2 cup of ketchup and 1/4 cup of bbq sauce instead of the full ketchup amount. My hubby ate it all in one evening. I will probably add a little water next time to make the sauce a little less thick.

This was a great recipe. No more can for me.  I didn't have enough ketchup so I added some tomato sauce to make the 3/4 cup. I added 1/4 tsp chili powder & a hatch chili to the mixture.  It was very good.

Well ... I wasn't looking for a recipe for sloppy joes and hadn't planned on eating it, but I ran across the recipe somehow and loved that it was quick, simple and I had all of the ingredients. Most of them anyway. I didn't have the green peppers. In any case, I've never even been much for sloppy joes, but I made it and it tasted exactly like I remembered them tasting as a child. Maybe I'll eat them more often now! Thanks for the quick, tasty recipe! Having 2 small children, I definitely appreciate quick. :)

Loved them . Big hit with my family and also my coworker friends The only thing I changed is a little less brown sugar and omitted the  green pepper. Not crazy about them in my sloppy joes but some my friends did and loved it.

This was the first time I had ever made sloppy joes from scratch.  This recipe is delicious without any tweeks, but I would make a few just for  personal preference. It is just a little too sweet for my husband and me so I will cut the ketchup with tomato sauce  next time and use a little less brown sugar. But don't get me wrong, this was a delicious recipe and will be my sloppy joe recipe  in the future!

Too sweet and vinegary/tangy for me.  Will need to really doctor it to add depth. Maybe I didn't cook the sauce long enough?

my family loved it!  I made this exactly like the recipe says and it is delicious!  this recipe will definitely become a regular for dinner. I personally would like to cut down on some of the sugar so next time I make it, I will cut the brown sugar in half and see if my family notices

This recipe was fine. No complaints. I followed the recipe exactly. It tasted like sloppy joes. I would make this again, but I wouldn't be any more likely to choose this recipe over another sloppy joe recipe. It was very good, but unremarkable.

This was very tasty.  The entire family liked it.  I did not have the onion or bell pepper so I just left them out and added a touch of onion powder to give the beef that onion flavor. Next time I prepare this one however, I will double the wet ingredients.  I did not have enough sauce to let this simmer as the direction state.  It was more like, keep warm until the rest of dinner was ready. If not double, I will go ahead and prepare the rest of dinner along side the meat mixture so it is fresh.

I loved it! I followed some of the suggestions that people gave such as using a 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup Sweet Baby Rays to give it a little BBQ taste.  After sautéing the beef, onions and peppers  I added 1/2 cup lentils and 1/2cup Beef Broth and put it all in the crock pot for 3-4 hrs on high.  It was incredible! The lentils gave it a heartier taste and my husband loved it!

NOTE: Really about 4.5 STARS, but really very good, with my two changes as follow: I browned the beef and drained the grease in a colander. Using the same pan, I sautéed the onion before returning the beef and adding the rest of the ingredients. I used more brown sugar (about 1 and one-half TBLS) and 1 tsp. of Worcestershire Sauce.

I was committed to making sloppy joes tonight only to find that I was out of my convenient go-to sloppy joe mix. In a rush to find a recipe that called for ingredients I had on-hand, I came across this one. I have to say it was a hit - especially with the kids.  Super quick and easy to make and tasty. I think this will now be my go-to - why mess with a mix when it's this easy.  The only changes I would make is that I would use a less sweet ketchup - and slightly less brown sugar. I upped the garlic for our taste. Another note is that I made it with a meat substitute and you would be hard pressed to tell the difference.  Overall, a great basic recipe that can be personalized as you like. Will definitely make again.

Too sweet. The boyfriend & I prefer more savory/spicy sloppy joes. This basically tasted like sweet ketchup beef. Tried to salvage it with chili powder, but to no avail. :(

Neither my girlfriend or I had tried Sloppy Joes before this, so I have nothing to compare this to. We're both big fans of Sloppy Joes now! Needless to say I'll be making these again!  Thank you!

we make this recipe often. its in my monthly rotation. its quick and easy with things on hand for a last minute meal. my husband likes that they're not messy and can take leftovers to work. lately we've been topping them with jalapeño cheddar cheese slices. just an added twist

I was shy about 2 tbsp of the required amount of catsup so used BBQ sauce to top it off. Also added a bit more mustard. It was SO good! Served with cheddar cheese and mustard on the bun and my hubby loved it.

Fantastic.  I made this for my non-American friends who'd never heard of Sloppy Joes, and they LOVED it.  I added a chopped tomato and a can of corn (because they were just sitting there), and it was great.  Tasted just like home!

Delicious!! Move over Manwich. Yes, it took longer than using Manwich, but it was worth it. I used 1/2 cup of ketchup and a 
6 oz. can of tomato paste. Yummers. my husband loved it. Great
with chips or cole slaw. We have left overs for another meal

Was great, I was missing the bell pepper, mustard and garlic powder. I used garlic salt instead and of course with held adding the regular salt. Only simmered for 15 minutes. Nice and simple. Just sprinkled shredded cheese on top when served, with bun.

I like this quite a bit, but I leave out the brown sugar. Even without it, the sauce borders on too sweet for my tastes. This isn't a saucy sloppy joe recipe; most of the liquid evaporates during cooking. I personally prefer that over a runny sauce. Bonus: it's so easy to throw together! On lazy days I just substitute 1T dried minced onion for the chopped onion and leave out the bell pepper.

These sloppy joes are delicious.  They are quick, easy to make, and the kids love them and ask for more.  This will be a regular on our dinner list.  No more can sloppy joes for us, we can make our own!!!

Homemade sloppy joes make people so happy.  Whenever I make serve them, people are impressed that I've made them from scratch, rather than from a can.  The secret is that it's just as easy to make sloppy joes from scratch as it is to make them from a can, and they are much, much better when they are homemade.  I like to put bread and butter pickle slices onto each sandwich.  It adds a sweet tang.  This is a solid and easy recipe which will impress your friends and family.

It was very sweet for our taste and lacked the tomato flavor we are used to. I already had cut back on the sugar and added about 3-4 tablespoons of tomato paste. Will cut back on sugar next time even more, maybe leave it out all together. I definitely will add a lot more tomato paste to it next time as well! We like ours tomatoey! With some tweaking, this will be my go to recipe for sloppy joes! No more buying the canned stuff!

Hadn't made Sloppy Joe's in a very long time.  This recipe got my attention.  It was very good, but I did make a few changes.  I used ground turkey to begin with, added some chopped celery, cut back on the catsup and added 1/4 cup of cocktail sauce and about 1 Tbsp of Sriracha sauce and 1 Tbsp of Worcestershire.  Tangy, spicy and even more delicious than I remembered.  Thanks for the recipe.  Clare in Asheville

Yum yum yum. Super good and easy. I made in my rice cooker with lentils instead of meat and doubled the sauce. I soaked the lentils for 15 min then put it in my rice cooker and cooked. Then added everything else (x2) and added a 1/2 cup water and cooked. Sooo yummy

I'm not a big sloppy joe person but this is a great recipe. I read about someone using BBQ sauce in place of some of the ketchup and tried it. Delicious!  Anytime I'm going to make sloppy joes I use this recipe.

I've made this a few times and my family loved it.  We used to like Manwich but the taste has changed over the years and we do not like the allspice taste that it has.  For those complaining this is too sweet, check your ketchup labels and choose a lower sugar variety. We use Hunts and it doesn't taste too sweet to us.  If you can't stand canned sloppy joe or one made from a packet, definitely give this a try.  Simple and delicious!

This recipes good! Although during the 30min simmer, I had to start stirring after 10-15mins because it was starting to burn the bottom of the pan, so I added about half cup of water to make it a little more saucy and not sticky. Still tasted great! Also I added spicy Montreal steak seasoning instead of salt and pepper. Definitely gave the flavor a little kick to it. ;)

I used 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup BBQ sauce and it seemed too sweet. Added healthy dose of Worcester and a few capfuls of cider vinegar then a bit more ketchup to cut the sweetness.  I'm glad I left out the brown sugar.  It was good but not great.  I think it was still a bit sweeter than I expected.  I don't think I would use BBQ sauce at all next time.  I'll make it again and add more onion. Coleslaw was a nice side dish.

Tastes great I would do what others have said and do 1/2 cup of ketchup and 1/4 cup BBQ sauce gave it great flavor and saved my dinner when I noticed I didn't have my normal sloppy joe sauce. This is my official sloppy joe sauce now can't live without it.

I made this for my ever so picky eater son. This was so easy!  I reduced the portion just for him (I am a vegan so I don't eat meat) and I left out the peppers (he hates peppers and most all veggies); those were the only alterations I made.  My son loved this recipe!  He wished I would have made more; I had made enough for two sandwiches for him.  Now I have something else to make him!  Thanks for sharing!

This is a basic sloppy joe recipe.  It tasted too much like ketchup so I added some tomato sauce and chili powder.  Not bad after the additions.

Tried this recipe today. It's a keeper for our family. I did use half ketchup and Half  BBQ sauce. As per a review did not need the brown sugar. Delicious. Thank you for a great recipe. My favorite BBQ sauce is half Mauls original and half Bulls Eye original. YUM!

If you're looking for a simple, classic sloppy joe taste, this is the recipe for you. Very good and very easy! I served with peas and macaroni and cheese. Thanks! :)

I've been looking for recipies because mostly everything has onions and my boyfriend hates onions. So I did everything except the onions and he loved it along with the 3 other guys we live with. They are all state troopers so they love a home cooked meal and this hit the spot! I did add a little more mustard but it was fantastic!

Everyone loves this at house even our picky 10 and 8 year old! We used to grab a can of Manwich when we wanted to eat sloppy joes but never again! It's so easy and delicious. Like the precious poster, we will definitely be doubling the recipe next time so we can freeze the leftovers for another night.

Fantastic! My girlfriend and our friends were very well pleased with this delicious recipe. I tried sticking to the original recipe but I realized I had no yellow mustard so I used honey mustard. Great alternative. 6 stars ??????

I really liked this.  I actually made it with cheap cubed steak I got on sale and cut up to ground beef size bites.  The only reason I gave it four stars is the simmer time.  I prefer faster recipes, so I just cut the time down and it was still good.

This is WAY WAY WAY GOOD!! It's SO simple and with a family of 4 but feels like I feed a family of 6.... I had everything on hand. Except the green pepper. I only had a red one. Same results I think.And with home made french fries this meal was a hit! Thanks for the great recipe

This tasted great, but I thought it was a little dried than I would've expected.  I didn't cook it the whole 30 minutes in the end.  I didn't want it to dry out.

Tasty and easy.  Because my husband suffers from gout, I use turkey meat.  As suggested by another reviewer, I make a batch and freeze in a muffin tin and when frozen pot them out and place in a freezer bag. Works great since I am normally cooking for two but if we have company it is simple to have a quick meal.

I made this for my family without the green pepper because I didn't have any.  It was such a big hit that I had to make it again sooner than expected!  Next time, I'll put less brown sugar because it was a little too sweet. mmmmm  I wanted to remind myself to add just a little BBQ sauce next time.

This was my first time making sloppy joes and it came out great. I used a whole medium onion, instead of just a 1/4th of a cup. I also used 1/2 cup of chopped green bell pepper, 1/2 cup of red bell pepper, a tablespoon of the yellow mustard, and 1/4 tsp of salt. I also used turkey instead of beef. Everything else was done as written. Cant go wrong with this recipe. This will defiantly be a stable in my house.

I made this recipe this afternoon and the family loved it! I only made very slight variations, mainly in that I am not an exact measurement guy (unless I'm baking). Plus I didn't have any bell peppers.I also added just a bit of Worcestershire sauce and some paprika.
It was really good and very easy to make.

Very fast to make, very easy and VERY tasty! I followed others suggestions and added 1 teaspoon  Worcestershire Sauce. I also stirred in approximately 1/2 cup water since I wanted my sloppy joes to be a little gummy/saucey rather than drier/crumblier.

Delicious!  Made the recipe exactly, though I found it came together faster than the 30 minutes needed to simmer, but that could be because I used a cast iron skillet.  Will be making again, thanks for making me a hit in my household!

I made this for dinner tonight! And my boyfriend and I loved it. I did modify it a tad. Instead of 3/4 ketchup, I put 1/2 cup of ketchup and 1/4 of Sweet Baby Rays Hickory and Brown Sugar BBQ sauce. And I added a little onion powder and 1 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce.

Thank you! My underweight toddler only wanted sloppy joes and on our college budget we could not afford manwhich brand three times a day....husband and son now prefer this. Great recipe that does well using rough measurements or a little less/more of ingredients (you only half the onions in your fridge).

Excellent!!! Our favorite sloppy joes. Fits our family. We have to five times this recipe and it seems a bit dry so I add four cups of ketchup and two tablespoons of mustard. Great recipe!

I did not add the green pepper as we are not fond of it.  I also did not have any mustard so I used 1 teaspoon of ground mustard spice and a couple of dashes of worcestershire sauce.  Will never buy the canned again.

Wonderful!!!!   Perfect for a quick dinner, or lunch. I used sweet peppers, since I needed to use them.   I did cut back on the brown sugar too.

I made these and haven't stopped making them. My husband loves them and asks for them once a week. The only things I changed, I added 1/2 cup Sweet Baby Ray's bar-b-que sauce and only used 2 teaspoons of brown sugar. They are the best.

This recipe is delicious!  I used ground turkey and also followed a review I read and added 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup BBQ sauce. I also added a little Worcestershire sauce and Texas Pete hot sauce to add a little more flavor. We'll definitely be making this often.

I did this in the slow cooker... worked great.  I also did the 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/4 sweet baby rays bbq sauce.... I think next time I will try the full ketchup amount and add the bbq sauce OR just add 1/4-1/2 cup tomato sauce.

Our family really enjoyed this. I forgot to buy the canned sloppy joe sauce and just looked for a sauce. Came across this recipe. Already had all ingredients on hand which was nice. So easy to throw together. Loved the flavor. Will probably double the sauce next time. Definitely holding on to this one-no need to buy canned sauce ever again.

Loved it! I make a list of recipes for the week on a regular basis, and when I saw how easy this one looked, I had to try it. I also haven't had a sloppy joe in some time, so I thought it would be fun to try. Delicious! I love the brown sugar, it just makes it unlike any sloppy joe I have had and so much better. The canned stuff makes me feel like I'm eating cat food, I don't know. This is much, much better.

Great recipe followed exactly the way it's written. It is sweet so if you don't like sweetness in your meat, skip the brown sugar. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is because of the mustard. I believe it was a bit too much. Next time I will add a bit less. It is a quick and easy meal and goes great with some home made fries (I'd suggest sweet potato!) I will definitely make this one again everyone enjoyed!

I made this tonight and I think it was the best sloppy joes I've ever had! I made a few adjustments according to our personal tastes, however. 1) I did not add green pepper. 2) I used 1 can of tomato sauce instead of ketchup. 3) I put in a few dashes of worcestershire sauce.  This turned out absolutely amazing and the whole family loved it! Especially the hubby!

I rarely "cook" dinner (order pizza, boil hot dogs, etc....), it's primarily my wife who truly cooks, so I decided to make this to help more in the kitchen. The hardest part of this experiment was sticking to the recipe - my wife was very skeptical because it varied from her usual ground beef prep methods. In the end, she loved it, and my kids loved it. This was VERY easy for a scrub like me, it is absolutely delicious. I followed the directions exactly except for one minor change - I didn't use salt and pepper, I added about a teaspoon of Lawry's Seasoning Salt. The consistency was perfect (for us), but others who like it really sloppy will need to adjust (don't ask me how, I suck at this). I read a comment where someone replaced the brown sugar with BBQ sauce, so I'm anxious to try that version next. 1LB of ground beef was enough for about 5-6 sandwiches, so I'll probably do 2LB next. But as is, this recipe is a winner.

Pretty darn delicious! The family loved it! I didn't use the green pepper and instead of the garlic powder I used winn dixie Sazon. When we made the sandwiches we used potato buns and added some provolone cheese. Yummy. Will make again.

Delicious! I didn't change a thing except I used ground turkey.  This is SO much tastier than the canned version I was buying.  I will use this recipe instead from now on.

My family absolutely loves this recipe. My 2 and 6 year old both eat every bite on their plate. Once in a while I substitute the beef for turkey (whatever I have at the time) but I don't modify it at all as it's perfect the way it is. This is my 7th time making it, goodbye canned Joe sauce!

Made this last night, it was a very good consistency.  Not runny at all, nice and thick.  Husband commented on the sweetness, it wasn't off putting...but may only add 1TB of sugar next time and see what happens.  Also, we used a red pepper, so that may have made a difference.  Either way, great sloppy joe recipe.

Have to say it's the best Sloppy Joe I have ever had. Has a hint of BBQ flavor with a nice tang.  I normally use McCormick seasoning package but was out, found this recipe and will not be purchasing the packs anymore.  I used ground chicken and a little water so it could simmer for awhile and it really flavored up nicely. Next time I make this I am going to serve in hotdog buns.

I didn't have any bell pepper, so I poured in some salsa verde... Used less ketchup (half regular, half jalapeno), a little bbq (sweet baby ray's original),light on the brown sugar, dijon mustard instead of regular and it turned out pretty good :) Served on Hawaiian sweet rolls with curly fries! Definitely better than  from a can.

This was amazing!  I left out the green peppers because I knew my kids wouldn't like those. I also added a splash of Worsteshire sauce. For the buns I buttered them with a little garlic salt and toasted them in the oven. These were a big hit!

Very good and easy recipe! I added onion salt instead of onions and left the green peppers out. If I added onions, I personally would saute them first. Would also recommend doubling or tripling this recipe if you're cooking for more than 2 people or want leftovers - 1 lb made 4 medium sandwiches for my family.

This was very good! I thought it was on the sweet side, so I added some red wine vinegar and some Worcestershire sauce. I served it on buns with some french fried onions on top which my kids liked.

I have made this recipe probably 100 times now, the kids always ask for it.  I do make it much more simply now for time and because it still tastes great even when cutting some things.  I usually throw frozen ground beef in the crock-pot in the morning since I never remember to defrost meat and then throw a bunch of garlic (powder or fresh whatever I have) on it with onion powder.  My husband doesn't like chunks of onion so I use onion powder.  I let it cook then drain it off.  I then toss in more garlic (I LOVE garlic), enough ketchup for it to be saucy, a couple of spoonfuls of sugar, and a squirt of mustard.  Dinner is served.  I have made this in massive quantities during moving and just left it in the crock-pot and all the guys just helped themselves during the day.  Also when having people over I will leave this in a crock-pot so the kids can just get more whenever they are hungry.  Great dish, I used to hate sloppy joes before this recipe.

This is ALWAYS a hit with my fiancé and our 6 year old daughter! I double the recipe and instead of using real onions, I used onion powder or dried onions (I hate real onions in my food). I serve this on whole wheat buns to help make it a bit healthier? LOL, great recipe that I make often!

It was easy to make and tasty, but I also tweaked the recipe.  I used some BBQ sauce, which has some sugar, as does the ketchup.  I used a little brown sugar, also.  I thought it needed a little heat, to counteract all the sweet elements.  I added a few drops of tabasco sauce and a bit of chili powder.  It did not make it very spicy, but I thought the flavor was more balanced.

I absolutely love this.  It's beyond me why it never occurred to me to make my own my sloppy joes instead of get it out of the can.  This is so easy so that it would be silly to ever make it out of a can again!!  It's also a recipe you can play with and make your own - my hubby's a big hunter so I never buy ground beef...we always have PLENTY of  ground venison on hand, so that's what I always use.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have made this recipe over 20 times. We have five kids and we all love it. I always double it and when I double it I use 1 cup ketchup and 1/2 cup bbq (sweet baby rays original) and I throw in about 1/3 bottle of Heineken. Simmer for 20 minutes with the lid on and them ten minutes with the lid off and turn the heat up to cook off the liquid.

My family LOVED this recipe. I added a little more ketchup and brown sugar though. Never buying the canned stuff again, this stuff is just to simple to make! (:

Just made this tonight and the family loved it. I wish I made more. I did follow the bbq sauce suggestion and eliminated the brown sugar. I served this with buns that were buttered inside then toasted in the oven just before serving and optional shredded cheese was set out.  Home made coleslaw with a Tb of sirracha sauce mixed-in was my side dish. The Bomb!  Oh, and did I mention that I'm not a sloppy joe fan....I wasn't...I am now.

I thought this recipe worked really well.  It was just enough for my husband, son and me.  I did not add any brown sugar because the ketchup was just sweet enough.  I'm not a fan of bell peppers so I used paprika peppers.  This is a "make again" recipe in our family!

Delish!  I haven't had Sloppy Joes in a long time and I was pleased with this recipe. Next time I think I will omit the brown sugar.  I think the ketchup has enough sugar.

My family didn't like it.  It's hard to go wrong with sloppy joes but I won't use this recipe again.  It was very bland and overdone because of the sugar.  I tried to keep adding ketchup but still turned out dry.  If you follow this recipe I would leave out the brown sugar.

Very good but kinda dry.  Next time I'll double the sauce.  That's the only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars.

Made this for lunch today. I read other reviews and I also tweaked a bit, with little bit of vinegar and little Worcestershire Sauce as well. Added a few fresh jalapeno's that I had in the freezer. The recipe was delicious and a keeper!! Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic flavor and super easy to throw together. Dad said it was "way better than that canned stuff".  Big praise from him. I generally don't tinker much with recipes but recently I was put on a very low sodium diet and have had to start altering recipes to accommodate it.  To avoid using salt I made the following adjustments: used Heinz no salt ketchup, added 2/3 cup diced celery, 2 tsps minced garlic and 1 tsp worsteshire sauce.  After simmering for about 15 minutes I added 1/2 cup of water and a 1/2 tsp vinegar.  After another 15-20 minutes the consistency and flavor were perfect.  Sodium content per serving (before bun) about 150 mg for 4 ounces.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

Always hated sloppy joes growing up, finally decided to give this a try and everyone in my family including myself loves it. I"ve made it a couple of times already, and I prepared it with a bit of bbq sauce and without, it comes out tasting great either way.

This was a hit! My husband and my one year both loved it! Less sloppy than I expected but the flavors were great! Makes about 4 full sized sloppy Joes. I'll make double and freeze half next time as pp suggested.

I made this last night and it was very yummy! I took the advice of other reviews and doubled the sauce. I did 1 Cup bbq sauce and roughly 1/3rd Cup ketchup, maybe a little more. I think if I sdidn't double the sauce it wouldn't have been Sloppy enough. This turned out perfect. Added shredded Fiesta cheese and pickles to the buns as well. Mmm.

The adult version of canned sloppy Joe's it takes the same amount of time as the canned stuff.  Make this for pot luck parties with slider rolls, always a hit.

I really like this recipe with some adjustments. Tried as is, but then had to doctor it up to get it how I like my sloppy joes.  I didn't add green pepper ... too overpowering for me. I doubled the recipe and used 1 cup ketchup and 1/2 c Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. Also added a can of tomato sauce to make it saucier. Also added a couple splashes of Worcestershire. Perfect.

had slightly over 1 lb ground meat so used 1/2 cup ketchup 1/3 cup bbq sauce.  added a little spice (hubby likes his stuff kind of spicy) and since it was a bit dry, added some water and a little cornstarch.  Otherwise followed exactly.  It turned out very good indeed!  served on hoagie buns with some of the inner bread torn out.  we'll be eating this again for supper tomorrow night, thanks for the recipe!

This was really good. In the US I always used the McCormick packages of seasoning, but I can't get it here.  So, I was looking for a scratch recipe.  I missed the part about simmering everything for 45 minutes so the meat hadn't really soaked up the flavor but it was still good.  It seems that it would get a little dry cooking it for that long, but I'll try it next time.  Easy recipe. Thanks for sharing it.

This was so so good!! I've always really wanted to like sloppy joes but manwich was never good in my opinion. So I gave this a go. Never again will I turn to the can version. I followed the recipe exactly only I did half a red bell pepper and half a green bell pepper. I cut up a jalapeño pepper I had on hand and added it as well. Loved it!! Definitely passing this one throughout the fam. Thanks for sharing!

I've made manwhich and my family never really cared for it. I made this recipe last night for dinner and we all devoured the sloppy joes! I added a little more then 3/4cups of ketchup. I also added 2 teaspoons of white sugar and 2 teaspoons of mustard. The red onion also helped make it sweet, but it wasn't too sweet. It was perfect! I will recommend this recipe to others!

Very easy and delicious!! I hadn't had a sloppy joe in years and was used to the canned Manwich version.  This was much better.  I'll start making this more regularly.

Made this with turkey and used a red onion and it turned out awesome. It's sweet and salty and perfect. I like this more than what I think of as a sloppy Joe. It's cheap to make and very easy you must try this recipe.

Pretty great!! So much better than anything from a can! The only thing I did differently was add some minced garlic to the onions and peppers.  I'm Sicilian, I physically cannot cook onions and peppers without garlic! haha.  I still left the garlic powder in the recipe.  Oh, I also made it with double the meat, but triple the sauce.. just personal preference for sauciness. Pretty sure my small changes don't make much difference.. really good recipe!

No fail recipe!!  This recipe has all the ingredients you need for a good sauce, just keep it the way it is or slightly adjust it to your tastes.  I prefer a little less sugar and more ketchup plus some Sriracha.  :)  Why buy the sauce at the store when you probably have all the ingredients already in your fridge?

Made this per recipe. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of Lawry' Original Seasoned Salt and 1/8 teaspoon of black pepper to meat while cooking. This was outstanding. My wife said it was the best she ever had! Wil be making again. It did border on being a little sweet for me, but my wife loved it as is! Thanks for the great easy recipe! Will not be going back to canned sloppy joe mix.

I used ground turkey and made this without onions and peppers for my very picky family.  They loved it.  They liked it much more than the packaged or canned variety.  It was super easy and quick.  I only let it cook for 5 minutes after adding the ingredients to the meat.  I sautéed some onion and peppers for myself and added it to the mixture.  I thought it was fantastic as well. Yum!

This is very good, similar to what my mom used to quickly make in a pinch. My only complaint was it wasn't quite saucy enough. Next time I will add more ketchup (as my family loves ketchup anyway!)

Haven't had a sloppy Joe in years! I used turkey instead, and the family raved! I took some suggestions and made twice the sauce and let it simmer a bit longer....also added fresh minced garlic. Delicious!

This is a great recipe. It is super easy to make. Sorry, Manwich, you're history in this house!
** I make this regularly without the green pepper. Today I upped the brown sugar to 2 Tbl and I added 2 Tbl  Worchestershire sauce and put in a large onion, diced. Yum!!!

I made double the sauce because I had a little more than a pound of group beef.  Very good taste, but I would probably reduce the brown sugar a little next time.

I did alter it a bit for lack of ingredients.  I used ground turkey instead and used minced garlic because I keep forgetting to buy some more powder.

I did have to change it in the middle of cooking because I ended up adding more ground turkey since it didn't look like enough for our whole family and I didn't measure out the ingredients again  and instead just eyeballed it which led to too much mustard (oops!) and I hate mustard so I ended up added a bunch more of the sugar to help it and it tastes wonderful!
If I had left it the same with just the one pound ground turkey, the flavor was still a bit mustard-y for me since I don't like mustard, but still a great sloppy joe flavor.

Update:  Eldest daughter didn't like it and she's normally not too picky.
Youngest daughter scarfed it and the dog tried to steal it from the stove

This was my first time making sloppy joes and they came out fine. I used 1.5 lbs of ground beef, so upped the amounts of everything by a little. Used 3/4 cup of ketchup and 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce--was a little dry this time (esp reheating leftovers), so might up those amounts next time. Tasty joes, though. Thanks to OP and other contributors for sharing:)

This was great, My boyfriend does not like sloppy joes,but my kids love them, so I look for a good recipe.  After reading the reviews I browned one jalapeno and part of a red salsa pepper(no seeds) into the beef mixture. I omitted the brown sugar. I added 1/4c. bbq sauce and only 1/2c. ketchup. It was very good, and the peppers gave it a nice kick, but not too hot. My kids still loved it, and so did the man who doesn't like sloppy joes!

I cook for the Mason's Lodge this year and prepared this meal for a degree.  I prepped all the items in a crock pot, which made it very easy for cleanup.  The meal was simple and elegant in the same step.  I did like other reviews suggested and substituted 1/4 cup of Stubs Sweat Heat combined with 1/2 cup of ketchup.  Big hit at the lodge and I was required by my wife to make the same dish the following day for the family.  Thanks

After reading several reviews (I always check to see what "tweeks" were made and how many people agreed)I made this recipe exactly as is except I added 1 tbsp of Worstechire sauce. These are by far the best sloppy joes my husband and I have ever had. We were amazed at how flavorful they were with the smallest amount of ingredients. I am going to make these again and follow a tip I read which is to make a bigger batch, freeze the leftovers in a muffin tin, once frozen, pop out, cover individually and store for future use - one muffin tin size is a perfect bun-size portion.

i was so worried about trying this recipe when i read all the reviews and so many people saying it was to sweet, my husband isnt big on sweet at all! But i pushed aside my reservations and made it anyway and figured hey if he doesnt like it more for me! well he liked it so much he made me add it to my recipe box so id be sure to find it again, i didnt change a thing about this recipe i made it as written and we loved it! its great on a hawaiian bread roll too.

Thanks for the effort but this was not what I was looking for. I love Sloppy Joes and I was really craving them so you would think I would like this.  This is NOTHING like traditional Sloppy Joes.  The mustard and too much brown sugar destroy it. This was sickly sweet with a horrible bitter aftertaste. My daughter refused to eat it. I was able to add some tomato paste and mellow it out enough to be edible, but if I were to do it again I would leave out the mustard and cut the brown sugar in half if not remove it entirely as catsup already has a ridicules amount of sugar in the first place.

I reviewed this earlier and failed to say that I used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  Sloppy Joes were yummy, and all was eaten at one meal by family.

Too sweet for our family.  I agree with the other posts about tasting like very sweet, thick, ketchup.  It's better the next day but still not a recipe I plan to make again.

It was awesome!! I did change it a bit and used 1/2c ketchup and 1/4 cup of bbq sauce instead of just 3/4 ketchup. And  added a little bit of water while simmering! It was definatly a fave and willl be making it again!! The recipe says it serves 6 but there was no left overs for us (2 adults 1 kid) 
  Great recipe easy and delicious!!

This was simple and yummy! I do tend to like it more on the savory side rather than sweet so I used brown spicy mustard, 2 tbsp Worcestshire, a splash of vinegar, and some crushed red pepper for a kick. I also doubled the sauce.

Super easy to make and delicious. The ingredient list is staples that most people have at home, so that's another plus.  As per another reviewer, I skipped adding the brown sugar until the end, I didn't add it, but I did add about a TBSP of KC BBQ sauce.
Husband said it's just like the original in the can.  Definitely will make it again.

I have been making this recipe for over a year now and the pot is Always empty.  I did follow another suggestion to double the sauce. I would say it depends on how saucy you like. Thank you for a very easy and very tasty recipe. :)

This is delicious!  My only suggestion would be to double the sauce.  

The slimmed down version:
This can be turned into a healthier dish by using ground turkey or chicken, sugar free ketchup, and zero calorie brown sugar.

This is a good base, but I found it too sweet for my taste.  I used 1/4 cup ketchup, 1/4 bbq sauce and 1/2 cup of strained tomatoes.  Additionally, I added 3 tbsp vinegar and a tbsp of worcestershire sauce as others had suggested.  and for something different, adding a bit of smoked paprika rounds it out.

My first time to make sloppy joes without using that famous little can of sauce! So nice to be able to control what goes in. I didn't put in the brown sugar - the ketchup contains plenty for us. Next time I will only use 1/2 teaspoon of mustard since the extra sugar wasn't there to balance the tartness. Overall very pleased!

I have made this twice and both times everyone ate every last bit of their serving and asked for seconds. So easy to make once you made it once. The second time was a breeze.

Thanks for this recipe!

I doubled the meat and tripled the sauce. It was a little sweet, so I'd probably just do 3tsp of brown sugar next time.

Made this recipe tonight, with a few changes. Didnt have brown sugar so I used a teaspoon of molasses with 3 tsp. white sugar, didnt have yellow mustard, so used dijon, and added an half of a can of petite diced tomatoes. My family fell in love with it! Will be a new goto for us!

The base recipe was just okay. However, with some modifications it's a 5 star recipe. I didn't have green bell peppper so I used red, other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It was a little too bland so I added 1/4 cup of bbq sauce and 2 teaspoons of Worcestershire. This added more flavor but was a little too sweet for us. So then I added a few dashes of hot sauce and a couple dashes of cayenne. Now that is yummy!!! It's not spicy, just flavorful.

Personally, this is the second best recipe I've cooked. My first best was a recipe of Boeuf Bourguignon a la Julia Child. This recipe is perfect and it's a hundred times better on the second day/when it's cold in the fridge.
If I can give a tip to everyone who wants to cook it, just DON'T use hamburger buns, especially wonder bread. It will taste awful. I recommend using kaiser buns or large home made buns (can be hamburger buns really, but don't use branded buns. Use store/home buns). 
Enjoy! :)

So easy and fabulous!!  I always add a little more ketchup and some red pepper flakes (my family likes spicy.). I also put in just a pinch of brown sugar or omit it entirely, but this recipe in its own is wonderful!  So easy and adaptable to personal preferences!

This was amazing! I only tried it because I had the kids all excited about sloppy joes only to find out that I didn't have any of the canned mix in the pantry... so I tried this. I like to add some worchestershire. I will never make the canned kind again!

Yummy. A bit sweet. Pull back on the sugar. I add corn and or beans. But then I probably have something other than a sloppy joe!

Not very good... Tasted like beef cooked in ketchup. Had to recover it with Worcestershire sauce, tomato sauce, and a dash of BBQ sauce!

This turned out great. I added a little more ketchup and some water to thin it out. 

I need to double the recipe next time; 13 year old boys love Sloppy Joes.

My family loved these and I will never buy a sauce in a can again.  It is an easily adaptable recipe.  I cook all my ground beef ahead of time so I can buy in bulk (on a budget) and so I can thaw and go (working mom).  I used dried onion, a blend that I bought at one of those parties, and a little garlic bread seasoning in place of the garlic powder.  I reconstituted the onions and then threw everything in a big microwaveable bowl and mixed well.  I microwaved until heated through.  My kids ate seconds and went on and on about these.  So easy.

I thought I would try homemade sloppy joe sauce rather than the canned variety. My husband loves sloppy joes so I figured home made is always way  better than store bought, right? None of my family was overly impressed with the homemade sauce. It was good, don't get me wrong, but when I put the effort in to make a homemade recipe I expect it to be Much better than store bought, and I simply didn't feel it was worth the effort. The sauce is good with a different, more brown sugar flavor than store bought. I'm not sure that I will make this again.

Like everyone else, loved it!  I also had to use a little water because it was not Sloppy Joe-ish enough, but it all worked out in the end.  I'm not a fan of green peppers, so I added pickles in the end for crunch.  Yum!  Next time I'm going to take other's advice and try the crock pot.

Hands Down Best Sloppy Joe recipe Ever!(and I have certainly tried a few.)Definately double the sauce, though. I did the first time and would imagine it'd be pretty dry if not. At 189 calories, what's it going to hurt, right? I paired this with some baked fries. yUm!

I used the recipe today 7-3-2013.  Follow the instructions as written. Made it for dinner. Everyone loved the sloppy Joes. It was easy to prepare and the ingredients I had. I will use this recipe from now on. It was delicious, and I was very pleased. I will never use manwich again. I love the freshness of this recipe. Thanks.

This recipe in its original form did nothing for me at all. Unsurprisingly, it just tasted like meat cooked in catsup. A little too sweet for my taste as well. I added more prepared mustard, some pickle juice, worcestershire sauce, crushed garlic, a little coconut milk, and oregano. Much better.

Made tonight to send with my daughter back to school for a 4th of July party she is having this week.  I tripled the recipe with the exception of just doubling the brown sugar.  It is still a bit sweet.  My suggestion is to put in the regular amount of brown sugar if you are increasing recipe and then add more to your taste.  Overall very tasty.

Family really liked.  I added some Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, cinnamon and clove of garlic. I usually add some chicken gumbo soup, but was out so I just add water. I noticed many people added bbq sauce.  I do sometimes also, but for most bbq sauces you will need to decrease the amount of sugar added.

I prefer more spicier tastes, so when I made this, I was disappointed with how sweet it was.
Even though it didn't meet expectations, it was still good. Just not something I was looking for.

Just tried this recipe and it's a keeper!  I was out of brown sugar, so I added 1 tablespoon of BBQ sauce! YUMMY!! I liked the idea one viewer shared about freezing in cubes. As easy as this recipe is, I'll try that next time, making extra, to have on hand when I'm totally lazy and tired. :) 
Thanks Tamara for sharing a simple recipe that is simply delicious!

This was easy and very tasty!  Even my picky eaters liked it.  Much better than Manwich.  I took the suggestions of some of the reviewers and added about 1/4 of water while simmering, which kept the meat from drying out and sticking to the pan.

Maybe even a 9/10, according to my hubs.  I used 1/2c ketchup and 3/4 cup of bbq sauce.  I doubled the sauce like others rec'd.  And after sauteeing the onion and green bell peppers for a bit and browning the meat slightly, I threw it into the slow cooker for 4-5 hrs.  It came out perfectly.  Will make again.

Have made this a couple times now.  Green pepper makes me gag so I never buy the canned Manwich type mix.  I like this one because I can omit the green pepper and just put in some red pepper flakes to give it a little heat.  It tastes good and is quick and easy - so it rates high in my household.

Followed the instructions pretty closely, except that I used salsa instead of ketchup and added some BBQ sauce. Served it on warm hamburger buns with a side portion of garden salad with homemade honey mustard dressing. T'was delicious and boyfriend was mightily pleased :) Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect. I like my joes a little sloppier so I added a touch of water to make it a little juicier. I will definitely be keeping this recipe on hand.

Great recipe . . . with a few minor tweaks.  To start I tripled the quantities to ensure that there would be leftovers.  Instead of using all ketchup I used 50% ketchup and 1 5.5 oz can of tomatoe paste.  I then added 1 1/2 tablespoons of white wine vinegar and 1 1/2 tablespoons of Manuka honey.  The end result was our kids asking for seconds and thirds . . . not has much leftover as I had planneed ;)

Fast, easy, and tasty.  I use it to make popovers.  Just buy(I use Grands)or make your own biscuit dough, roll it, stuff it with the mixture,  pinch it closed, and bake at 350 for 20 min or until light brown.  It makes it easy for little kids to eat and you can freeze any leftovers for a quick snack or lunch later.

I had some leftover meatloaf(i know, its almost unheard of) that had 2 tbsp onion powder, salt/pepper, bread crumbs and 1 egg. I used probably 3 tbsp ketchup, 1/2-1cup bbq sauce (just what i had in the fridge). Heated it all up, put it on a piece of bread, put a slice of cheddar cheese on top and put it in the oven to melt the cheese. Very tasty. Next time i think i'm going to add some spice. Thank you so much!

This is our favorite recipe for sloppy joes. However we use ground pork instead and always follow the 1/4 cup barbecue sauce, 1/2 cup ketchup tip.

My husband loves this recipe!  I make several batches at a time and can the leftovers.  One pint make 3 really big sandwiches.  It's so nice to just grab a jar off the shelf and heat it up for a few minutes.  I also send jars of it to college with my boys.

This is good - quite good actually BUT...please taste it BEFORE you add the brown sugar. This is very sweet and did not need any sugar! I feel bad only giving it 3 stars because it is better than just "ok", but too sweet to get 4+ stars for me.

This recipe is a great staple. I hate the stuff in the can and making it from scratch doesn't take that long. The only thing I added was a little bit of ginger for zing, but it would have been a hit without this.

This is a great recipe to have on hand for a quick meal.  I will never buy the canned mix again.  I agree with the others, add a little water.  Makes it more "sloppy".

OK this is one of the most versatile & easy recipes to make. Of course I altered this recipe, I use mostly ground turkey I was wanting to use all turkey but I needed a little more than what came in the pack so I bought .75lb of 80% lean ground beef to mix in. I chopped up onion and half a red bell pepper , but in hot skillet of 2 tbs spoon of olive oil then sprinkled it with salt.. I cooked them veggies down to really carmelized and soft as my family don't like crunchy vegetables in food.

I then tossed in the ground turkey which was marinated with worchester sauce. I brown the ground turkey while added in garlic powder, onion powder, and some steak sauce. After the turkey was all cooked I added in the rest of the ground beef browned & cooked it more with turkey & veggies to infuse flavor into the meat. I then added some more worchester sauce. After all the meat was cooked good I then pour contents in strainer. 
Now for the sauce I put in half a can of tomato paste, then used some barbecue sauce.. and I eyeballed the amount of mustard to use in the sauce so I could say I used 2 tables spoon. I then added garlic powder & steak seasoning season mix. I also added 1/4 cup of Apple cider vinegar  & I used barbecue sauce (omitted the sugar element" because Ketchup or barbecue sauce carry  enough sugar, all cooked over medium heat. The key to the sauce is taste as you go. I then added cup of water to make sure enough sauce. I added back the meat into sauce simmer for 20 min & serve

I have made these for years using deer burger & sometimes Italian sausage,  except I add about 3 splashes of Worcestrershire, & use about 1/2 cup of brown sugar instead of 3 tsp. I also don't add pepper, or garlic salt. Love them! 

So, I had to choose a  recipe from Allrecipes with ground beef as an ingredient and “make it over” using Johnsonville’s Italian Sausage, This is the one I chose. Like I said before, I loved them. I also chose to use French bread with Italian Seasonings that I butter toasted on both sides on a flat grill.

Great recipe, and so easy! Never buying Manwich again... But as prepared as directed, MUCH too sweet for my taste. (I'm thinking I could have added a tiny bit of vinegar to cut the sweetness...) Add the Brown Sugar in a smaller amount and taste it, rather than measuring as directed.

This is my go-to recipe for Sloppy Joes.  If I'd known how easy it was all along, I would have never purchased a single can of Manwich.  The recipe doesn't require exactness.  I can dump some onions and peppers, season my ground beef with garlic salt while it cooks and then eyeball the ketchup, mustard and brown sugar.  I like to use ketchup without high fructose corn syrup to help keep it a little healthier.

Seriously good! Best sloppy joe I've ever made and cannot even compare to the one from the can- yuck. Anyway, I followed previous reviewers and did 3/4 cup of ketchup, 1/4 cup of sweet baby ray's barbecue sauce. I also put the onion, pepper and a little garlic in the blender to make my veggies more like a salsa. Sauteed the veggies, added the ground turkey then once done drained the liquid and added the rest of the ingredients from the list. I added a little water to help it simmer longer. You could not tell I used turkey at all! It came out amazing!

So awesome!  Just like the canned Sloppy Joe sauce, only better!  No need to buy that canned sauce any more!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was great.  I highly recommend it!

I omitted the green bell pepper because I didn't have one, and made the recipe otherwise as directed. It was yummy for 3 out of 4 of us (the youngest preschooler didn't like it and ended up only eating the bun).

I just found this recipe and make it for lunch for my husband and I, we loved it! I did leave out the onion and peppers just because I don't like onions or chunks in my sloppy joes. I also added a handful of shredded cheese in the pan at the last minute and stirred it in, it helped the joe be not so sloppy :]

Great sloppy joe recipe! Used red peppers instead of green. Like everyone said it  is sweet.

Will use less sugar next time. Will  definitely make again.

These are THE BEST sloppy Joe's I've ever tasted. My picky picky boyfriend even approved! I left out the green pepper and onion, though. I don't think sloppy joes are meant to be crunchy :)

I don't usually like Sloppy Joe's or green bell peppers but my husband loves them so I thought I'd give this a try.  I really liked it, even the kids.  I wouldn't change anything although it seems like a versatile recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was way too sweet for my family. I doubled the recipe but left the brown sugar as it was and it was still too sweet. Thanks anyway but this one isn't for my family.

I thought it was simple and tasty and I've made it a couple of times.  Unfortunately it was a little sweet for my daughter who tends to say that about a few things that I like.  Good recipe if you don't mind a little sweetness, which of course you can adjust.

I tried this recipe with very high expectations considering the number of great reviews. Unfortunately both my fiance and I didn't enjoy this version of sloppy joes; we found it to be very sweet even after using less brown sugar and we also disliked the amount of peppers and onions it called for.

Very good. My first time making this. I always bought the canned stuff. Never again. This was way better. The only thing i did different was i used only 2 tsp of brown sugar and i used 1/2 cup of catchup and 1/4 cup of sweet baby rays bbq sauce and i did add 1/2 cup of water while it was simmering.

Love this recipe and so does the family. I have been making it for a couple of years. Instead of prepared mustard, I use 1 tsp dried mustard and since we really don't like green pepper, I use celery (same amount as the green pepper). Just made it again yesterday for super bowl and put it in a crock pot to keep it hot. No leftovers. :)

The only change I made was to add chopped red pepper also.  Next time I would cut the brown sugar down to 2 tsp. to make it a little less sweet.

I've been craving sloppy joes, but I didn't want to buy the canned stuff because of the bad ingredients and amount of salt used in it. I used ground turkey instead of beef so it was a bit healthier (Though I think they taste very similar). This was very good when I tasted the original recipe, but I changed a few things so they were more like the sloppy joes I grew up with. I added a bit more mustard and just a touch of BBQ sauce for some spice. I did add about twice as much brown sugar, because I like my sloppy joes sweet. Otherwise, without modifications, it's great and very savory. With my alterations, it's a homemade classic that I had always looked forward to as a kid, but healthier.

I've never had Sloppy Joes before so I was a little worried when I made this for a party, but everyone raved about it! Excellent! I doubled the recipe and added a few dashes of worcestershire and a tad less brown sugar, plus a little extra ketchup because we ate it over rice.

My husband and I love this recipe!  But I tweak it to my personal tastes by adding some Worcestershire sauce, real garlic instead of powder and a slightly larger portion of the onions and peppers.  Easy, tasty and quick!

While I'm not normally a fan of most sloppy joes because of the sweetness, these were very tasty and not so terribly sweet, though I did omit the brown sugar.  Served them at my Christmas Day supper and they were a huge hit!

I have made this recipe for years, minus the green peppers.  I got it from my sister, but lost it recently.  I was so glad to find it here.  You will not be disappointed!

This is a great simple sloppy joe recipe. I didn't add any brown sugar because I didn't think it needed it. It seemed plenty sweet with just the ketchup, mustard and garlic. Will continue to use this recipe!

Thought I had Sloppy Joe mix in the cabinet.  When I found out I did not, I found this recipe.  My husband likes it and said he like to have it again. That's a winner for me; he is very picky. Also, it is very easy to put together.

This is by far the best sloppy joes I have ever had. My family loves it. I normally make it and put it in the crock pot and it is ready whenever we get ready to eat. Will never buy canned sloppy joe sauce again!

Delicious! I used a tsp less of sugar, and it was plenty sweet. Also, I added chili powder cuz it tasted like it was missing a little something. It was perfect with those changes, so this will be my sloppy joe recipe now. Thanks!

So much yummier than the can. The family loves it even when I sneak in extra veggies like zucchini. I've made it with elk, antelope, turkey and regular beef. All awesome.

This recipe makes the best sloppy joe's I've ever had.  Love the idea of adding making them from scratch.  I always make a double batch so I can buy a 12 pack of buns. We never throw away leftovers of these!

Great simple recipe.  However, I substituted half BBQ sauce for half ketchup and doubled the sauce per reviewers suggestions and it turned out great.  This will be on our family week night rotation for sure! :)

I've made this recipe a few times and my family always loves it. The last time I made it I didn't have any fresh vegatables on hand so I used about 2 TBSP freeze-dried bell peppers and about 2 TBSP dehydrated onions. Then I rehydrated them by soaking them in a bowl of water while the meat was browning & while I mixed the other sauce ingredients. After the meat was cooked I drained the excess water off the vegatables and dumped everything onto the meat in the pan and stirred it all together while everything finished thickening & warming together. It was fast, easy, and yummy.

Great recipe! I made this without any veggies and with garlic and herb Mrs. Dash instead of garlic powder--still delicious! Sweet enough for my 2-year-old to enjoy, but no so overwhelming that hubby couldn't enjoy it with some hot sauce. Will make again but will probably make a little more sauce so its more "sloppy."

Made this for my fiancee about three weeks ago and he has wanted it about 5 times since.  We love it.  I add bbq sauce and use a little less ketchup then what the recipe calls for.  I also add Worcestershire Sauce.  Fast, easy and Delicious!

This was THE BEST sloppy Joe's I have EVER tastes. Much better than Manwich and it is just DELISCIOUS. I didn't used any bell peppers though. I think that made it taste even BETTER! Phenominal recipe, definately will made in my house MUCH MORE OFTEN :)

good recipe, was looking for something mom used to make when i was little. i haven't made these for my kids yet so now that they are a bit more mature and willing to try some new things, it's time for sloppy joes. I left out the brown sugar instead of cutting down on the ketchup like some reviewers indicated. i like my sloppy joes to be SLOPPY and SAUCY! i think ketchup has enough sugar in it as is and i probably put in about a 1/2 tablespoon of garlic but we are big garlic lovers

This recipe is quick to whip together. Next time I would double the recipe because it does not make a lot if you need to feed more than 3 or 4 people. Everyone liked it and the ingredients were things I already had on hand. I did not add the bell peppers because my husband can't eat them. All in all I would definitely make this again. I added a bit of barbecue sauce on my sandwich. That was not necessary, for it tasted fine without it. I just require a bit more zing for my taste buds.

Perfectly delicious. Only change was use fresh garlic instead of garlic powder. I'll never use any other sloppy joe recipe. So easy and quick to make.

Awesome recipe!! I added instead a half onion and a whole green pepper, used ground turkey meat and it still came out amazing! This is an easy dish because you can just sort of eyeball all the quantities needed and everything you need is already in your kitchen!My son is a picky eater and he loved it too- this will definately become a family favorite in our household.

Fantastic!!!!   I left out the green peppers because my family doesn't like them, but on their own they really taste delicious!  We're planning on making 10 pounds of this and having it at our Halloween party next week!  :)

This was really good, so  much better than a can or a spice packet and really easy.  Very forgiving too, if it is too sweet add more of the other spices.  I did not have green peppers so I used the red ones and I used regular mustard since I did not have the powdered.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  I did add water to get them more sloppy.  This will be a go to from now on!

I was looking for something to do with hamburger that was quick and easy and this fit the bill.  It is a bit on the sweet side though.  We left out the green peppers and doubled the onions since it was all we had.  My children really liked it.

I liked this recipe a lot, a good base.  I didn't have green pepper on hand, so I used sweet peppers.  I also added a little crushed red pepper and chili powder because my husband likes it a little spicy. I added a little water before simmering because it didn't seem sloppy enough. This was my first time making sloppy joes from scratch, and I think it was a success!  I will likely never buy manwich again!

minor adjustments - added a little less than 1/4c steak sauce, omitted bell pepper and reduced sugar to 1 tsp. Melted 1 Tbsp butter in a skillet and toasted the insides of the buns...so good, there is none left.

Love this.  I normally don't like Sloppy Joes, and I definitely don't like mustard, but my whole family loved this.  Cheap.  Fast.  Pantry ingredients.  Will definitely make again.  I didn't simmer for 30 mins after adding sauce.  Just long enough to heat.  Still tasted great and in less time.

This was a very good change from the regular plain old sloppy joes.  I did make a few changes and it was perfect.  I added Kraft hickory smoked barbecue sauce and reduced the brown sugar to about 1.5 teaspoons.

I used to have a different "go to" sloppy joe recipe.  This is my new "go to" recipe.

I made these for my son's birthday party and many people commented on how good they were! 

I added a splash of apple cider vinegar and increased the brown sugar to taste.

Really good but, sweeter than I'd have expected. If you like spicier food I'd suggest some chili powder or taco seasoning added to it.

Very nice! Not a sloppy Joe fan til NOW. Made triple batch in crockpot, using rather small minced cabbage for about a quarter of the hamburger. About 20 minutes before serving, it seemed a tiny bit too saucy, so, per advice of one reviewer, added just a touch of quick oats (no more than 3 Tbsp, but probably less). That took care of the tiny bit of juices that needed to be settled in, but when it came to dinner time, we couldn't tell any oats were added. Husband said he couldn't tell the cabbage was there. We agreed to try more cabbage next time due to the price of beef (might also try ground turkey & add twice the oats?). Raw sugar, not brown. Had no bell pepper, but doubled the onion. Added 3 cloves fresh garlic along with the onion, while still using powdered garlic. Ran out of ketchup, so used barbeque sauce for about half of the ketchup - would probably like more ketchup, the 2 parts ketchup to 1 part bbq suggested by other reviewers, but it was still very, very good.  Nice, flexible, easy recipe. Will try with all ketchup one of these days, I'm sure. My daughter came to say goodnight after brushing her teeth and saw the recipe and picture on this page while I was reviewing the recipe. She simply had to hover here a while just looking at the picture saying (several times while hugging my arm as I typed away), "I wanted to eat more, but I just couldn't. I was too stuffed.  We should have those every night!" Thanks, Tamara, for a success story from your kitchen to ours!

This recipe is very similar to the one my mother made.  It is easy and delicious.  Sloppy Joes can be sweet or savory; this one is on the sweet side.

9.25.13 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/24264/sloppy-joes-ii/ ... 'Not a big fan of sloppy joes.  Guess it's because they were from a can when I was growing up.  These I can take!  :D  I had leftover (not very good because I used extra lean ground beef) meatloaf, about 2 & a half pounds.  I minced that & added a half cup sauteed onion, 15oz can tomato sauce, 3T brown sugar, 1/2t oregano, 1T chili powder, 1T yellow mustard & 1/4t red pepper.  I used fresh garlic with the onions.  No salt or pepper.  'Didn't need it.  'Could tell it was meatloaf makeover, but it was good.  The meatloaf was insanely big so I will follow this recipe again & with planned ground beef, too - or turkey! 9/13 I think we have a hit here. I subbed 1#mixed turkey w 1/2c minced onion, 1 minced carrot, 2cloves garlic, 15oz tomato sauce, 1T chili powder, 1T brown sugar, 1/2t dry mustard, 1/8t cayenne & 1/2t worcestershire. Pretty yummy & not too sweet or hot for all.  :o  :)

My husband and I love this recipe. I strive to cook low calorie meals, which makes this recipe very appealing to me. The only thing I do differently is use ground turkey instead of ground beef. I also added 1 tbs. of chipotle bbq sauce and a little more ketchup if it was looking more dry to our liking. Excellent recipe!!

Awesome reviews from my family (including a couple of young picky eaters who don't like to try anything).  Definately didn't need as much brown sugar.

Good base recipe. I used ground chicken and substituted red/orange peppers for green. Also put a small amount of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce instead of brown sugar and also addded about a teaspoon of worcestershire sauce. Nice flavor!

This was fantastic.  Definitely better than the canned stuff.  I didn't have an onion on hand, so I used 1 Tbsp of dried onion flakes.  Worked great.

I've made these twice.  The first time I tinkered too much with this great basic recipe.  The next I made only 2 changes.  I added minced, fresh garlic and took another reviewer's suggestion to use 1/2 of catsup and 1/4 cup barbeque sauce.  Mine was hickory flavored, I still added the mustard but not the garlic powder or brown sugar.  These sloppy joes satisfy my occasional cravings for 'kid's' food.  Thanks!

I love it, its perfect as is.  I like things a bit spicyer so I usually substitute the Green Pepper for Jalapeno Peppers... Even red peppers mixed with a spicy red pepper.  Either way this is the best Sloppy Joe recipe in existance, as is, or spiced up!

These were really good and super easy to make! The only thing I did differently from the recepie is I added red and green peppers finely diced, I used yellow mustared in place of prepared mustard that was needed and I added 1/2 cup or less of water to final mixture to thin out mix.  This is a keeper!!

Best Sloppy Joes I have ever had! I didn't change the recipe, but I was feeling a bit impatient and hungry toward the end so I didn't let it simmer for the full 30 min. It still turned out fantastic though!

A little too sweet for my taste. I also like more of a tomato flavor. Next time I will add tomato paste and add the brown sugar to taste. Thanks for sharing!

Is it silly that sloppy joes are my 2nd favorite dish to lasagna?  I just love them, and this recipe was very good and one I will be sticking with. I love how easy it is. I recommend using very lean meat (80% lean is the best!) and also very important if you like saucy sloppy joes: DOUBLE THIS SAUCE.  It would be WAY too dry if it was not doubled in my opinion.

Doubled the recipe for leftovers and followed it as written, but used ground elk meat because that's what we had on hand. It was great, my boyfriend loved it and said they were the best sloppy joes he has ever eaten!

These were really good.  I thought they were a bit to sweet.  I followed the recipe as written.  I will make these again, i read some reviews to add a splash of apple cider vinger and some worstishire sauce to cut down on the sweetness,  I will do that next time.

This is the best sloppy joe recipe my family has ever tasted!  My husband and kids couldn't get enough of it.  I used ground turkey instead of beef because that's what I had on hand and it still turned out tasty and delicious!

Delicious! I was skeptical at first since I am used to sloppy joes with more sauce, but the flavor was wonderful. I halved the recipe and served on rolls, but other than that followed all directions. Definitely a keeper.

I made these for my 9 year old son's birthday party and they were a hit!! I had to copy the recipe down for my MOTHER IN LAW!!! If she wanted the recipe, it had to be good because nobody cooks better than her (according to her). HaHa. Thanks for sharing.

My first time making sloppy Joes thats not from a can! It was a total hit & my hubby even said it was better than his mom's recipe! Super easy to make and super delicious. I didn't have brown sugar so I used 2 tsp of white sugar & 1 tsp of maple syrup. I didn't have bell peppers so I went without it & I used fresh garlic instead of powder. I added a tsp of worshtershire sauce for a little kick. It was absolutely delicious & I will be making this recipe again for sure!

I used ground turkey instead of beef.  Because of this, I added three dashes of worcestershire sauce.  I also used an orange pepper instead of green because we don't like green peppers.  It tasted fresh, tangy and sweet.  I will use this recipe everytime!

I followed AMERETTE's advice of making more sauce, and am glad I did. I first made it per the recipe, and it was a bit dry (hence the 4 stars), so I doubled the sauce ingredients. It came out wonderfully. No more Mannwich in this house!!!

I thought this was really good, but had to modify some things: ( i doubled the recipe)

Added a little bbq sauce, did not use onions, added onion powder, added 1/2 cup water. I think i probably used just under the amount of brown sugar the recipe called for.

Very good! I used jalapeno peppers instead of the green pepper and it had a nice kick. You do need to double the sauce and I also added 1/2 cup water. I  used Moroccan bread instead of hamburger buns, make sure to heat up the Moroccan bread in the micro wave for 30 sec. for each bread. With a garden salad makes for a great meal

I am not a fan of green peppers or onions so I used dried onion bits and a dash of paprika while browning the beef.  I put the beef in a slow cooker as suggested in other comments with the sauces (using ketchup, BBQ sauce and tomato ragu as I didn`t have enough ketchup or BBQ sauce).  It turned out great and I would definitely make it again.

Best I've ever had!!! Manwich just isn't the same! I added some Hickory BBQ Sauce to the mixture and didn't put quite as much Ketchup. Added a touch more mustard and it was to die for! 5 STARS!!

Easy and tasty!  I had to substitute a bit because I was missing the brown sugar, so I used about 1T molasses and 2T white sugar.  I also threw in some frozen peas to jazz it up a little (since I don't eat bread - need something to round it out).  Very good, fast and easy!!

My younger dtr. wanted to have sloppy joe's for dinner, but I didn't want to use the canned stuff or the mix.  I tried this recipe. My older dtr. complained about our choice for dinner and my husband was actually shocked about me making something so "simple".  Well, yes, it was very simple, but everyone loved it!  We haven't eaten sloppy joe's in over 8-10 years and all family members gave it a thumbs up!  I served tater tots and macaroni salad with it.  So simple, so easy, so silly-fun!  I made one adjustment, instead of 3/4 cup of ketchup, I used 1/2 c. ketchup and 1/4 c. of BBQ sauce.

WONDERFUL.  This is my new "go to " for sloppy joes.  No more canned sauce for us.  I made on small change.  I used a sprinkle of died minced onion instead of fresh just because I didn't have any fresh onion.  I also added red bell pepper just because my daughter loves them.  I came out fantastic.

Perfect sloppy joes.  I didn't change much just used brown mustard instead of yellow (all I had in the fridge), added an extra handful of peppers and onion and added a 1/4 tsp of onion powder to the sauce.  Served with baked french fries I and corn on the cob. Definitely will make it again.

Best manwich or sloppy joe ever. The difference I made was that I added a can of drained Ro-tel but other than that the recipe I didn't change. Was great. Thanks for such a simple recipe and so good. Will be making this one over and over.

Very easy and to me, way way better than the canned stuff. I like this as a go to recipe when I'm running low on groceries...It uses stuff I usually have on hand. It's also very forgiving as far as the quantities of the ingredients. A+ for sure!

Hey this is pretty yummy.  I'm kinda pricky when it comes to my sloppy joes.  My mom cans a sweet onion sauce that I grew up with in her famous sloppy joes, so this recipe has some pretty tough competion.  With all that said this recipe all in all was a real good and really easy to make.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I love this recipe!  I add an additional 1/2 cup of my favorite barbecue sauce to the mixture.  People actually request this for potlucks and no, not because I can't cook anything else, either, lol.  This is truly a great recipe.

We love this recipe as written and love it even more with a few modifications. We add a 1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes and an 1/8 teaspoon of celery seed. It is especially good on homemade bread.

Very good and tasty.  Won't buy manwich anymore.  Only I thought it too sweet.  The ketchup already has sugar in it.  Will try again using only 1tsp brown sugar.  Thanks

I followed the recipe to a "T" and it was very good! I noticed that the sauce was slightly on the sweeter side after a few minutes of simmering so I had to add just a little water, nothing more. It was very tasty in toasted hamburger buns and served with buttered corn on the cob. nice!
02/19/15 This time I used ground turkey meat and a real garlic clove. I added 1/2 cup ketchup, a 1/2 c Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce, a shot of Worcestershire sauce and a tsp of liquid smoke, and a tsp of vinegar for a little zing plus 1 more tsp brown sugar for balance and little water. I baked some buttermilk biscuits to place in the sloppy joes. For a side dish I baked some potato wedges. YUMMMY!!

Pretty good for a quick meal.  I did find it a bit sweet for my liking and may omit the brown sugar completely next time.  I also added 1/2 cup of water during the simmering time.

I cut little caps out of the bun and removed some of the bun inside to make bowl, scooped the sloppy joe mixture into the bowl, topped with some cheddar cheese.  I stuck this under the broiler until the cheese was melted and stuck the cap back on the bun!  They weren't so sloppy after this.

Goos basic recipe, with the exception of adding less sugar, and some drizzles of Worchestire (hope I spelled this right...lol) Sauce. May try another recipe next time.

Great base recipe!  Made my own changes to make it a 5: (1) used ground turkey breast since had it on had and it was a great sub since the sauce added such a good flavor to usually dry meat. (2) cookede in all in a crock pot per other request and because I had such lean meat to help it not be so dry. (3) we like hotter-style food so I used the 3/4c. ketchup with the 20 oz. Gr. Turkey breast, upped the onion, pepper and used fresh garlic (so much better) and 2 Tbsp. Chipolte Tabasco to give it a kick with a good flavor.

I would give this a 3 and 1/2 maybe. a little sweet. next time i think i will add more vinger to cut sweetness.  used extra lean ground beef so i didn't have to drain it, ground mustard (out of regular mustard), and sweet peppers (out of green peppers). followed others advice, and added a litte more ketchup, worschtire sauce, to the mix. I also added fresh garlic when sauted the onions and peppers.

I love this recipe. It is easy, fast and I always have all the ingredients. I did omit the brown sugar, for my own taste. The ketchup has corn syrup in it already, and it was very flavorful without the addition.

My mom used to make a recipe similar to this, but as another reviewer mentioned, she added a bit of vinegar and Worcestershire sauce. Also, for some occasions, add a bit of bourbon for a real kick!

The other addition, that makes it even better, IMO, is to add a piece of thinly sliced Velveeta on top!

Made this as a quick last minute meal and was a big hit. I did make a few changes I used diced green chilies instead of bell peppers and to offset the chillies a bit I used about a cup of ketchup and more brown sugar. Will make again.

I agree with other comments that the end result is too dry.  I just add about 3/4 water and it turns out perfect.  I like that it is slightly sweet.

These are fantastic.  My family, with kids, loved them.  Put them in muffin/cupcake tins to freeze remaining.  Stored in a Ziplock bag in freezer and re-heat for a quick meal.  Also, did not fully drain meat and stuck to original recipe proportions, and the dish was not dry.  It was perfect!

Good basic recipe.  I used ground turkey to keep it extra lean, a red pepper (because that's what I had) and added a good amount of Lousiana Hot Sauce to cut down the sweetness.  Served it over ziti pasta.  Very good.  Thanks for the recipe!

Following another review, I added BBQ sauce instead of brown sugar and as I don't eat ground beef, made this with ground turkey. My SO and sons loved this and are already begging for more! Personally, I don't like ketchup at all and think it could use significantly less but my ketchup fans loved it and actually added more.

this recipie is awsome!  My husband & I went to a Taste of Home Cooking Scool last Sat. and came home late & hungry. Went online and found this with a few other versions. Thought it would be too sweet so added montreal steak spice and some worcestershire sauce and bingo he loved it and asked for it a week later over fresh haddock.

Very good.  Like other reviewers, I reduced the amount of ketchup and added some barbecue sauce.  I tasted the mixture before adding brown sugar because my BBQ sauce had sugar in it.

Absolutely the BEST Sloppy Joe recipe. No more store bought varieties, I'm sticking to this one. I took another person's advice and used 1/2c ketchup & 1/4c BBQ sauce.  Perfect!!

This recipe was delicious, though I did later make a few changes that made it a 5-star for me:
Added Oregano, chili powder and substituted 16oz tomato puree for the ketchup.

This is one of my favourite recipes.  I used two packages of veggie crumbles (one original and one Mexican-gave it just a hint of spice), so I used 2 1/2 the amount of sauce.  I too found that it seemed pretty ketcupy so I added a bit of bbq sauce and some worcestershire sauce.  I put it in the crock pot, but it only needed about 3 hours on low.

Kind of plain, and not as good as Manwich. But...the cholesterol & calorie counts are better. Put a few dashes of hot sauce on it and it's not bad.

Wow. So much better than the awful canned Sloppy Joe sauce I grew up eating, which has ridiculous amounts of sugar. Like others have noted, the next time I'll cut the brown sugar by half and it should be just as good. 

But overall great recipe, loved by my wife and daughters.

It was good, but not the best Sloppy Joe I've had.  I thought it was a little sweet and not quite spicy enough.  Next time, I'll cut the brown sugar in 1/2, use only about 1/2 cup ketchup and add 1/4 cup BBQ sauce.  I would imagine if you use a brown sugar BBQ sauce, you could probably cut the brown sugar completely.

A very good way to make sloppy joes... really not much harder than opening a can of manwhich... and the little effort it takes is well worth it... will make again... maybe subsituting real maple syrup for the brown sugar

Good basic sloppy joe recipe. I found it was missing some depth of flavor so I added about a teaspoon of worcestershire sauce and reduced the sugar to only one teaspoon. Believe me, it was sweet enough!

This was easy to make and very tasty.  Everyone loved it, but my husband and I felt it was a little to sweet and "ketchup-y" tasting, even though I put a little less ketchup than the recipe called for.  Next time I may use tomato sauce and paste instead and I might up the mustard just a tad.

Great recipe Tamara! I made this with lean ground turkey and it was amazing. Took me right back to childhood. To give the turkey a lil more flavor, I added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce, a packet of beef bouillon and 1 tsp kitchen bouquet for depth of flavor. I also added some chili sauce because I personally like a lil kick. Very versatile, delicious recipe. Thanks.

This was a WONDERFUL recipe. Why the four stars? Because I did make some changes to make it the delectable dinner that it was. :) The changes I made were:
1. Added tomato sauce to the ketchup to make it a little more "sloppy." 
2. Used green, red, and orange peppers for extra color.
3. Added Emeril's southwest spice blend for extra kick.
This is not to say that the recipe would not have been great without these changes--just that to my eye/palate these modifications were a good idea. :)
Thanks for this recipe--it is a keeper!

Very good.  The brown sugar gives it a sweet taste.  This recipe is different than canned sloppey joes because it is not as watery, and it is not as tomato-ey.  I will make this again.

There is no other way of making Sloppy Joe's II these are the best ever made. We make this recipe and call it Bar-B-Q in the coal region of Pennsylvania. We've been making them this way for 59 years now, and there the BEST

Very tasty!  I followed the suggestion of adding BBQ sauce and did so in addition to all the ketchup to keep it a little more saucy.  Will most definitely make this again and be tossing my old sloppy joe recipe, its been replaced. :)

What a quick, delicious, successful meal.  I eliminated onions (family is allergic) and green pepper (I don't like).  And it still came out great. Fast, and usually have all ingredients in the pantry.

i was nervous making this recipe because my boyfriend loves the Manwich Bold- i was afraid this wouldnt be as good since i've never made a sloppy joe before... wrong! he loved it! a few things i did differently: used 1 6oz. can tomato paste instead of ketchup, substituted Jack Daniels Original BBQ sauce instead of using the brown sugar (a couple glugs; eyeballed it), and added some chili pepper (about 1-2 Tspoons; again, eyeballed it)... came out great!  i am not big on exact-measure ingredients, so this recipe worked out well for that.

Always have the ingredients at home and this is a whole lot LESS SALTY than store bought mixes for those that are watching their salt intake. Great taste.

Very good sloppy joes!  I made half this recipe.  I didn’t seem to have enough “sauce” to simmer for 30 minutes, but no matter, I just simmered to the desired consistency.  I made this early in the day and refrigerated it, covered.  When time to reheat, I did need to add a little water to get it back to a good consistency.  We really like these and Hubs polished off the little bit that was left in the pan, even without a bun!  Guess he must have liked it!

Mmmm. This was so delicious. I followed the recipe exactly other than I added some celery too. Also, I used Splenda brown sugar and low sugar ketchup. I would give it 10 stars if I could. Absolutely fantastic!!!

This is a great sloppy joe recipe.  I took the advice of a previous reviewer and used less brown sugar.  I recommend only 1 1/2 t of brown sugar instead of the 3 t the recipe calls for, unless you like your sloppy joes really sweet.  I also added a dash of worcestershire sauce.  Delicous!   I will definitely be using this recipe instead of manwich in the future.

This is the one!  Better Homes & Gardens had chili powder instead of brown sugar, which is fine but not the kid-friendly recipe that I remember.

I have made this twice now and got rave reviews both times.  The 2nd time I tripled the recipe and used only 4 T. brown sugar and it was still plenty sweet.  I threw in some diced jalapeno peppers that I had frozen from the summer garden. Several friends asked how I made it.  Thanks Tamara!!

This was very good.  However I changed up the recipe a little.  I sauted the onion and bell pepper first and i added about a teaspoon of cayenne.  We would like it to be a little saucier, so i am going to try to add a can of tomato paste next time.  Thanks for the recipe.

You are life saver Tamra! When I reached for a can of sloppy Jo mix and found out I had used my last one I frantically surfed the web and found your recipe. I did not tell my husband I tried a new recipe, I wanted to see if he would notice and he did. He said he liked it better than the can stuff.

Everyone in my family LOVED this.  I served it as a Sloppy Joe pizza instead of on buns.  I made crusty mustard foccachia bread and used the completed SJ mix as the sole pizza topping (mainly because I didn't have cheddar cheese to put on it too).  This is an AMAZING recipe.  It didn't need extra water.

I've been using this recipe for years and friends and family still get rave reviews.  There are only 2 changes that I make - I season the meat with garlic powder and black pepper while it's browning, and I omit the brown sugar and instead mix ketchup, mustard, and BBQ sauce in a bowl until it's at a color and consistency that I like, then I pour that into the pan.  The BBQ sauce adds a smokiness to it while not making it too sweet.

We loved these! We like them with more sauce so we only simmered for 10 minutes. Next time I might double the sauce and simmer for 30 so the flavors can blend. Will make again for sure!

These were very good!  Very basic recipe and it was delicious.  I of course tweaked it a little for my taste buds by adding a little Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce (Kikkoman Umakuchi Shoyu [flavor enhanced soy sauce]).  Will definitely make this one again!

Very tastey. Easy to make. You have to double the sauce otherwise it's too dry for the amount of meat. I also add 3/4 cup spaghetti sauce to the sauce (personal preference). I cooked it in the crock pot for 3 hours on low.

We really liked this.  I doubled the recipe, and for half the meat, I used Gimme Lean ("raw" meat substitute that you brown like ground beef).  Not counting breakfast, we have eaten it for 4 meals in a row!  Highly recommend :)

Made this tonight for my boyfriend and I, thought it was pretty good, but a little too ketchup-y. Next time I think I'll use less ketchup and maybe replace it with a bbq sauce. Otherwise is was very tasty and easy, will definitely be using this recipe to make it again.

A little sweet, but I may have just used to much brown sugar or the wrong onions.  Overall I though it was great and a great alternative to canned sloppy joes.

Good and easy! No need to use the canned stuff with this recipe.  I did add a splash of white vinegar and replaced 1/4 of the ketchup with barbecue sauce.  BBQ had brown sugar in it, so I only added one teaspoon of brown sugar.  Thanks for the recipe!

I decided to try this for our family reunion tomorrow and scaled it for 60. I pretty much followed the recipe as written, but since I had to make such a large quantity, I browned the meat with pepper and onion in batches, adding them to the crockpot as they were done. Then used the same pan and made the sauce. Just brought it to a simmer so to break down the sugar. I did add about 3/4c bbq sauce in addition to the ketchup and a few dashes of worst sauce and one packet of McCormick Sloppy Joe seasoning (Only did this b/c I was such a huge amount - probably would only use a few tsp if it were standard size batch).  It is simmering in my crockpot right now and it is heavenly. I have to keep smacking hubby's hand b/c he keeps stealing bites here and there...might not be enough when I get done!  I'm so excited to bring it tomorrow.   Thank you for this fantastic recipe!

Simple and good! I doubled the sauce and it was moist enough, although next time I might add some water to thin it out a little.  My changes were to sub 1/3 of the ketchup with bbq sauce.  I didn't add the brown sugar because my bbq sauce was a brown sugar flavor.  Also skipped the green pepper because I didn't have any, but would like to try it next time! My husband liked it a lot!

Perfect!  Thought I had the sloppy joe mix in the cubbard and I did not.  The kids were ready for sloppy joe and I was like oh no!  Found this recipe and, wow... easy and saved the day.  Oh and the home made sloppy joes came out amazing!  Thank you.

My husband doesn't really like Sloppy Joes but he thought these were pretty good and said he would eat them again.  I thought they were a little too sweet, but I didn't have all the ingredients when making this, so I substituted!  I didn't put any onion in (my husband doesn't like them).  I used red pepper instead of green, and I used less brown sugar.  All in all, we were happy with them.  I will probably use this recipe if I get a craving for Sloppy Joes again! :)

Really good.  Can't remember the last time I had a sloppy joe, probably over 15 years.  This was good although not very "sloppy".  Next time I'll make more sauce.  Just a tad too dry for our liking.

Super easy and quick dinner.  Only change I made was that I used ground chicken.  I added some beef bullion paste to substitute the beef flavor.  KIDS loved it!

This recipe was one of the best tasting recipes for sloppy joes that I have ever tried. I adjusted as needed for serving size of course, but it was extremely easy to make, taste and enjoy!

A simple, delicious recipe. I omitted the bell peppers, but it was just as good.

This was just okay in my opinion.  I prepared it exactly as written (minus brown sugar ... I used white sugar as that's all I had on hand).  Maybe the fact that I didn't use brown sugar made the difference, but it was too "ketchuppish" for my taste.  I don't care for ketchp to begin with but thought I'd try this out.  As someone else suggested, I added a half cup of water and a teaspoon of oatmeal to make it sticky ... didn't notice a difference at all.  I would make this again because it was good, but would probably modify it to my taste.

OMG so good!  Quick, Simple and they taste fresh They dont give you that fat slobby sluggish junky feeling after eating them like the one in the can does.  My husband doesn't like sloppy joes but he even admitted that these were good.  I would definitely make again!

Made as written and have also  added 2-3 tsp of white vinegar, a tsp of Worcestershire sauce, and some tomato paste (per another review).  Also may change up the veges with carrots, red peppers, etc.

A bit mild for my tastes, but very good for children.  I also tried it with leftover roast pork for a version of pork barbeque sandwiches.  I sauted the onions and pepper, added the other ingrediants and shredded pork, and simmered for 30 minutes.

Yummy stuff, thanks for the recipe.  My family had a labor day party at the lake and we made this for about 40 people.  Everyone loved it, especially the cook (me), because I didn't have to spend the whole afternoon in front of the grill.  More time in the lake and not on the bake.  Served with cole slaw, baked beans, and pasta salad.  Awesome meal.

This is a great basic sloppy joe receipe.  Instead of adding brown sugar try adding your favorite BBQ sauce really is great.

A bit dry though I used more ingredients. Substituted ground 1.25 pounds ground turkey and 1/4 cup (before cooking) of quinoa - the latter for some texture. Will try again but with half the brown sugar.

I followed the recipe exactly.  I can't believe how easy this was to make, yet it tasted as good as some of the much more complicated sloppy joe recipes I have tried.  Easy and delicious, what more could I ask for?

Next time I will add more onion and bell pepper. Oh, and less mustard... otherwise it's great! I did put in some BBQ sauce in addition to the required ketchup to make it more "wet".

I have never really cared for Sloppy Joes, my husband calls it his childhood comfort food.  Needless to say when I made this the first thing out of his mouth was...."this is good...keep this recipe". So I will make it again for sure. Thanks Tamara!

loved it, I did sub. a small can of tomato sauce for some of the ketchup, added 1/4 tspn chilli powder, and a tbsp or so of vinegar, used garlic salt so left out the reg salt. left out the brown sugar too. The ketchup made it plenty sweet. I used a lid when simmering so had lots of sloppiness left.

Fantastic.  Made it exactly the way the recipe called for.  I also made it with fresh garlic (1 tsp) and put browned ground meat, onion & pepper in crock pot with remaining ingredients and cooked for 1.5 hrs on high.  Yummy!!!  A new family favorite.

This recipe is awesome! I usually hate sloppy joes, but these were soooo good! I doubled the recipe (made two pounds of ground chuck) and left out the bell pepper (picky hubby).  They turned out so good! I served them on sesame seed buns with american singles on top and made seasoned fries to go with them. Great dinner! Thanks!

This is much like my mom's recipe, except she added a can of undiluted chicken gumbo soup, and no sugar.  A little more runny, but still good.

I guess I'm used to the pouch mixes, because this seemed off.  Not that it wasn't good, it just wasn't quite what I was expecting.  Still, it was tasty and super easy.  I've never used canned stuff because it's horrible.  I cut back a teaspoon of the brown sugar because it seemed a little too much, but that was after doubling the recipe.  Also, I eat mine on hotdog buns so they're not quite so sloppy, which is especially good when kids are involved.  :)  Thank you, Tamara.

Very good and easy recipe. Although, oddly enough, I did not have enough ketchup on hand so I used an entire bottle of chili sauce and added a bit more brown sugar to even out the tangyness. Came out great!

I didn't simmer them as long so they were more saucy.  Also omitted the green pepper as my family doesn't like them and subsituted dried minced onion when I added the ketchup.

Great, simple, and easy recipe for sloppy joe's.  They remind me of the ones I had in the elementary school cafeterias, sweet and meaty.  :)  I added more ketchup because I like my sloppy joes wetter.   I would definitely make these again.  Serve with bread or put a scoop of it on salad.

This recipe is a great "pantry" recipe - the ingredients are things most people already have (only 4 things to buy: beef, onion, green pepper, buns). I am never buying sloppy joe packaged mix or canned mix again! We are making this again tonight. It's the perfect patio/beer/no fuss Sunday recipe.

This recipe is a delicious and great for a quick weeknight dinner.  I followed the recipe exactly and it has a nice tang.  I doubt it would feed 6 adults though.  It would serve four people, max.

I've tried a few SJ recipes from AR and in my opinion this is the best.  Made as written but doubled, used 1/2 ketchup 1/2 tomato sauce and added worch. to make up for the lack of ketchup.  BETTER THE NEXT DAY.  A keeper!

So, my son wanted sloppy joes for dinner. As soon as I put the meat in the skillet I realized that I forgot to buy sloppy joe mix. AR to the rescue! I used  approx 1/4 tsp onion powder (no onions), omitted the green peppers (yuck), and used approx 1/4 tsp minced garlic. I also threw in some soy sauce (nice dash or two) and approx 2 tbsp bbq sauce. Ended up adding maybe 1/4 cup water because it was a little too thick. Turned out great!

This was very, very delicious! I had to use chilies intead of bell pepper (they are 98 cents each..ouch!) This was the first time I have ever had sloppy joes that did not use a packaged mix. I don't think I'll ever use one again! I actually just ate the leftovers, and it was even better than when it was just made.

Wow!  I pretty much licked the pan before I washed it!  Soooo good.  I made the recipe as is the first time.  Great.  Only thing i needed was a little water as it simmered so it stayed "sloppy".  The second time I tailored it to our tastes.  I used ground turkey, 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar, 1/2 cup beer and took the sugar down to 1 tbsp.  I also added 1 cup shredded carrot to bump up the veggie factor.  Either way a great recipe as is, or to tailor.  Thanks Tamara

This saved the night tonight. We wanted sloppy joes and I forgot to buy manwich at the store today. I've always known that the sauce was easy to make but have never taken the time to learn. This was great! It uses simple ingredients that I always have on hand. We doubled the sauce side of the ingredients, but next time we'll use just a little less brown sugar. Otherwise it was great, just the way I expect sloppy joes to taste.

Really good- hadn't made sloppy joes in so long.  I used ground chicken to lighten them up.  Also added some chopped celery to the veggie saute, and a little hot pepper sauce for extra zip.  Thank you for a delicious trip down memory lane.

Best sloppy joes I've ever tasted.  So easy and sooo good!  I added a little bit more ingredients to make it more flavorful.  Also added New Orleans seasoning (Tonys Chachere's)

When I couldn't locate the can of sloppy joe sauce that I swore was in the cupboard -  and after I had already browned my ground beef in preparation - I had to find a recipe for homemade sloppy joes.  Once again, the great cooks on allrecipes.com saved the day.  This is better than the canned stuff that we've eaten forever!!  The fact that it can be made with ingredients you already have on hand is an added bonus.  This will be my sloppy joe recipe from now on!

Made exactly as written. But it was close! I originally grabbed for DRY mustard, but as I read the recipe more closely, it was just regular old yellow mustard! *whew*  Everyone in my family thought these sloppy joes were delicious. It was quite sweet. I'll make this recipe again! Especially since their "these are the best sloppy joes" goes really well with my "these are easy to make!"

I used ground turkey and Splenda's brown sugar.  Other than that everything was the same.  Great recipe - easy to make.  Definitely a keeper!

The only thing I changed was using 1/4 cup of the ketchup as BBQ sauce and reducing the brown sugar to 1 tsp. As someone else said, there is brown sugar in the BBQ sauce so I didn't want it too sweet. My husband is a big Sloppy Joes fan and he absolutely loved it. After his first two bites he told me to never lose this recipe and don't try any other ones. They were fabulous!

Delicious!  This was my first time making sloppy joe's.  I added more onions to the recipe as I didn't think 1/4 cup would be enough for my taste.  I used a whole onion.  It was YUM-MEE!!

HUGE HIT! Next time I need to definitely make a double batch.  The sauce got too thick when simmering so I added some water because my side dishes were not ready.  Next time I wont simmer so long.  This stuff is awesome and I'm admittedly not a big fan of sloppy joes.  Now I am!

This recipe is just phenominal!  I was a little skeptical stearing away from my jar of Not So Sloppy but I gave it a shot, and boy am I glad I did!!  I will NEVER eat sloppy joe mix from the store again!  I followed the recipe to a T, the only thing I didnt do was cook it for as long as it stated... I simmered about 15min and that was plenty!  Keeps the family begging for more!

I only had ground chicken on hand so I used that instead. I subbed around 1/4 cup hickory/brown sugar bbq sauce for the brown sugar. So, the end result was sweeter. It was a fast and relatively healthy weekday dinner.

Excellent. I was wanting something different from Manwich, and these hit the spot. I don't think I'll ever buy the cans again. I subbed in 1/4 c. BBQ for 1/4 c. of ketchup, added a little Worcestershire, used ground turkey instead of ground beef, and used brown mustard instead of yellow.  The end results were the best Joes I've ever eaten.  Good enough that I reviewed it on my blog and will be making this again.  http://logankstewart.blogspot.com/2010/03/more-food-or-why-dove-chocolate-is.html

This is the perfect sloppy Joe. I gave this recipe to a friend and her family didn't like it because it was too sweet. If you are looking for barbaque flavor this recipe isn't for you BUT if you want the onld traditional sloppy joe (sweet) make and enjoy.

These were good. No comment from the hubby so I'm thinking he wasn't a fan. I tried the joes before I added the brown sugar and I think they were better. I would make again but would omit the brown sugar...

With this recipe, I made mini sloppy joes for a cocktail party and they were a hit. Like other reviewers, I made slight adjustments by using less sugar (~1 tsp less), adding a few splashes of red wine vinegar, and adding ~1/2 cup of water. This is a keeper!

I will have to try this again and rerate it. I forgot to cook the onions with the meat so I cooked them separately and of course they carmelized. I think the carmelized flavor enhanced the garlic and it tasted too garlic-y. When I made the sauce I didn't think it was as sweet as I remember "Manwich" being which is my sloppy joe standard.

Great recipe! New family favorite. I  made a few changes based our family's taste. I shredded carrots, added red onion, jalepeno, and chopped garlic. I used ground mustard, but I might also add dijon mustard next time. I also added worchester sauce, red pepper flakes, and cumin. I used tomatoe sauce and bbq sauce instead of ketchup. I did not use sugar.  Thanks for sharing this recipe. I vow to never use Manwich again.

Pretty good. I added some A1, crushed red pepper and serrano chilies to make it really zing. I also used garlic salt and garlic pepper in lieu of garlic powder. A delicious and easy recipe that can be modified to suit any taste. Yum!

I have made these more times than I can count.  Delicious.  I generally double the vegetables and make a little more of the ketchup, mustard and brown sugar sauce.  I also serve open face with melted sharp cheddar on top.  Great comfort food and not loaded with fat and calories.

I too added 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce into the mix & left out the brown sugar like Meredith did. The Sloppy Joes came out so delicious. My husband loved them. This is definitely a recipe I'll continue to use. A++

This is really good! I like to scoop leftovers with an ice cream scoop and freeze in a muffin tin until frozen. I then pop them out and put in Ziploc Freezer bag...perfect single servings as needed!

My husband absolutely loved this recipe.  For me it was a tad bit too sweet so will add some vinegar and reduce the sugar next time.  Still, it was quite tasty, and I love the fact that it is not  high in calories!  Hooray!

A really quick, simple and tasty recipe. A little high in sodium but much healthier than the stuff in a can. I left out the brown sugar because we aren't fans of "sweet" sloppy joes, and it was still really good.

good easy recipe. I ran out of ketchup while I was making it so I only had 1/4 cup. So, to make up for that, I used BBQ sauce instead. Also ran out of yellow mustard, so I used Dijon. It turned out very good with those modifications! I added some water to the pan while it simmered, and cut the simmer time down to about 15 minutes and it was perfect.

These were great, fast and full of flavor! My husband isn't a big sloppy joe fan but even as I was cooking them he was saying how good they smelled. We all loved them I will make this version over the canned or packaged sauce anyday ty.

My husband & I really liked this recipe.  Unfortunately, our kids tend to prefer the packaged sloppy joe mix so I don't make this often.

This was such an easy great meal that my entire family enjoyed. I already had all the ingredients and it took about a half an hour to pull together. To make the sauce more "sloppy" I replaced the brown sugar with 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce and a half a cup of water, I served with corn and will diffidently be making this one again!

Soo much better than canned SJ mix.  Husband loved it and ate almost the whole pot by himself, (in one sitting). Try some on a saltine cracker.

My dad says "need more slop!" I made it with extra lean turkey, which might have made the difference. I followed the recipe exactly otherwise. I thought it was pretty good but my dad and brother weren't too impressed.

I made this with Morningstar crumbles to make it vegetarian. It needed more sauce (turned out dry), but I don't think it was the fault of the recipe, it's because I used soy "meat." Otherwise, it was wonderful and very easy to make!

This is a great recipe. We followed the exact recipe the first time and were very happy, however, we like a bit more mustard so we doubled the amount and followed the advice of an earlier post adding a splash of vinegar, and worchestershire sauce.

Very good! Chopped up two cloves of garlic instead of using the garlic powder, a few dashes of worcestershire, and I didn't have any green pepper, so I omitted that. Really tasty. Served with potato wedges and a green salad. Thanks! :)

Pretty darn good.  I would adjust the brown sugar down just a bit, or maybe be prepared to add 2/3 first, stir and taste, and then if it needs more sweetness throw it in.  Much better than Manwich!

This recipe was really good although a little sweet.  As others have stated, I added water, a little cayenne pepper, 1/2 c ketchup & 1/4 c BBQ sauce.  Next time I'll omit the sugar and it should be terrific.  Thanks Tamara, great recipe.

pretty good. i made a few changes : added a splash of worcestershire sauce, used an 8oz can of tomato sauce and added ketchup as needed( to make it sticky), also used about 1/2 cup of bbq sauce. the mustard in this recipe is great to balance out the sweetness.

I added 1/3 cup bbq sauce to this dish.  It was looking a bit dry for the simmer and I found the extra sauces were just right!  GADS this was good and I made my hamburger bun recipe published here to go along with them.  They are a bit denser than store bought fluff, so it makes a REAL hearty meal!  Thanks for sharing Tamara!  I'm craving them again!

So easy, quick and really good.  Kids love them too. I use whatever color pepper I have on hand, sometimes sub bbq for halve the ketchup, and it can be made even without onion and pepper. This mommy of 4 really appreciates this recipe!**** I originally rated this 4 stars, but I've been making it so long, and we all love it so much I have to change to 5 stars. I've even served it to guests, and everyone is always blown away! Nothing like the can or packet!!

Pretty good.  I was kinda if-y about ketchup and brown sugar.  All I could smell was ketchup, but after simmering I have to say the taste was good.  Next time I think I will omit the sugar since it was too sweet for me.

This recipe was excellent even though I substituted Lean Ground Turkey for Beef.  I also eliminated the green pepper but added 1 large onion.  This was great on the honey wheat soft buns I made.  Definitely a keeper ~ Thanks :-)

Like most say, add a bit of water before sauteing, it's too thick otherwise.  Yummy, yummy, yummy, you'll never buy Manwich again!

This was a great recipe. So simple to make yet so satisfying. I skipped the sugar since the ketchup I was using was sweet enough already, and unfortunately had no green bell peppers. We added freshly diced tomatoes (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup) in its place. Also used 1/2 lb of ground turkey instead of 1 lb of ground beef. But still, made 3 small sized open-faced sloppy joe sandwiches for me and 3 heaping large ones for my roommate. I think having the green bell peppers would have definitely given it that nice bitter flavor to add to it. We also added a teensy bit of thyme and fresh crushed oregano. YUM!! Would definitely make this again.

Mmm Yum! An obvious man favorite but even I like this one. Red peppers instead of green and they work very well. I (mostly) doubled the sauce on recommendations and modified slightly. 1/4C barbecue sauce, 1/4C water, 1C ketchup, 1T prepared minced garlic, 1/2T mustard, 1/2T hot taco sauce, 1T brown sugar. Perfecto!

I made this recipe for a weekday dinner instead of using canned mix but wasn't really pleased with the results. I mean, the sloppy joes wern't horrible, they just wern't good. mI didn't think that there was enough tomato flavor or sauce and that it was too beefy tasting if that makes any sense. WOn't b making this again.

the ingredients in this recipe were great, but not nearly enough, and i did tweak them a bit. i used 1.15 lbs of lean ground beef and needed to double the sauce. i feel like it could have used one more dose of sauce.  i also added 2 t of minced garlic and 2 t of worcestershire sauce. cooked the beef in a skillet and then added everything to a slow cooker on simmer for 4 hours. so good.

I was looking for a better alternative to the usual can mix that my daughter hates. We all flipped for this simple classic!! I did add a bit more ketchup to make them a little saucier and they were awesome!! Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was fabulous.  I followed others and reduced the ketchup and added BBQ sauce.  I also finely chopped carrots and added them as well to increase my child's vegetable intake.  Will absolutely make again.

I followed this recipe almost exactly (though I did rinse and drain the beef to reduce the fat content between browning it and cooking it in the seasoning).  It was delicious, and the leftovers were perfect in Shepherd's pies.

OMG!!!! hope delicious were these, i have never in my life had a sloppy joe, being from england only heard of then through american tv shows..YUMMY, my daughters and husband loved them, the only thing i changed was i left out the sugar and replaced 1/3 of the ketchup with BBQ sauce, the bbq sauce added sweetness and i felt it would be too sweet if i added the sugar aswell, apart from that i left everything the same.. i will definatly make this again...thanx Tamara for a great recipe.

YUM!! I made this with some Yve's "ground turkey" soy crumbles and it was a real winner. I cut the sugar a bit, and added 1 tablespoon of water to thin it out.  I like mine a little more "savory" and not quite so thick, but otherwise this is a perfect Sloppy Joe recipe. I will try it with dried TVP next time to see if it soaks up the flavors.

I was in the mood for sloppy joes, but didn't have any of the canned stuff around. I did an internet search and this was the first recipe that came up. We really liked it! I didn't have any green peppers left in the garden, but had lots of ripe poblanos and used one of them instead. We will definitely make these again. No more Manwich for us!

Very tasty.  I have to admit this was the first time I ever made sloppy joes from scratch and I am glad I did.  Very easy and very tasty.  Get a little nice veggie action in it.  No need for Manwich!!

Loved this.  Just tweaked it a little.  Substituted banana peppers chopped for the green bell pepper added about 1 tsp. of the juice as well.  Then added tomato sauce until it was the consistency we liked.  About 3/4 of a 15 ounce can.

I will never use that canned stuff again. This recipe is awesome. I usually add a few more squeezes of ketchup and add a few splashes of worcester sauce.

These were very good...I used red bell pepper, as I was out of green, but otherwise followed exactly. Had a little sweetness which was different but I really enjoyed. Thanks!

We are not huge sloppy joe fans, but this recipe is great for an quick and easy dinner.  It's tasty, cheap, easy and filling and we seem to always have these ingredients on hand.  One little thing I added was some Tapatio hot sauce for a bit of zing.  Just a few squirts added to the recipe was perfect!

Left out the green pepper since I didn't have any and my son isn't a fan, but when I make this again I will put it back in and just dice it small. Thought it was a good, filling, hearty recipe. The flavor was good, didn't knock my socks off - but it was a good solid Sloppy Joe recipe! I think it goes great with a slice of cheese on top and a wheat bun for some extra flavor. Yummy!

Bland dry recipe. I chose to try this recipe based on the number of positive reviews. I had to tweak it so much I lost count of the changes.. I'll try something else next time

After preparing this dish you wouldn't even know that I used ground venison instead of ground beef.  This recipe is outstanding and I will prepare this again.  I halfed the recipe again to have more sauce and added worcestershire sauce and hot sauce to taste.  WOW!!  Can't wait to fix these sloppy joes again.  Thank you Tamara for the recipe.  I bet ground turkey would be good also.

I used 2lbs instead of 1 for 6 people and that was barely enough.  Also I think it was a bit too sweet so I added a can of tomato sauce and paste and added a little vinegar.  Worked out really well!

This is the basic recipe that I remember as a kid. That was way before anyone even heard of canwich or the just as unappetizing dry mixes. Thanks. I give this recipe 5 stars and two grubs up.

Good, basic recipe.  Will put this one in my recipe box and use from time to time.

UPDATE:  I made them again without the brown sugar and a couple of dashes of cayenne pepper and they were even better!

This was a hit at a potluck dinner. I didn't have any to bring home. How disappointing! I wanted some for the next day it was so good. Thanks for a recipe that I will most definitely make again and next time I will set some aside to keep at home.

This is a great, easy way to get dinner together with things you already have on hand. I've made them with and without the bell pepper and can't tell that much of a difference. I use fresh garlic instead of the powder. They won't replace my regular home-made sloppy joe recipe, but these are very good.

My husband and I loved this recipe. I had a lot of doubts about it at first. The catsup and mustard in it sounded questionable. But it was delicious! It was incredibly easy. We used pork instead of beef since we had leftovers and were trying to use them up. We plan to make this often!

I have made this several times now and my family really loves it.  We are a picky family and do not like green peppers in our sloppy joes.  I just leave them out and usually have to double the recipe just for the 5 of us.(2 are only 2 & 4).  LOL!!!  Thank you!!

I had planned on making sloppy joes for dinner when I realized I had everything except the sauce.  So I looked up this recipe on the fly and it did not disappoint.  We (5 kids and husband) couldn't tell the difference.  This will definitely be in our recipe rotation.

Really good and very simple recipe.  The only changes I made were adding a little cumin and coarse kosher salt.  This one is going in my book! Thanks!

Very good- I think like others I can't resist making a few changes.  I added about 1/4 cup barbeque sauce that I had made a few days earlier, a diced roma tomato, and 1/2 a jalepeno.  I also didn't measure the garlic powder, but I'm sure it was more than was called for.  Also, since I am on a salt restricted diet I used no salt added Ketchup and did not add salt.  With all the other veggies and spices I didn't miss the salt.  My husband loved it and went back for seconds and thirds!  I loved this recipe!

This recipe is amazing and so easy and quick to make. I use ground turkey instead of beef and cook chopped garlic cloves with the meat, onions, and peppers instead of the garlic powder. Delicious!!

Very good sloppy joes!  I have been looking for a good sloppy joe recipe and I think this is it!  I liked it because I usually have all the ingredients on hand and it was quick and easy.  The only thing I didn't happen to have was the green pepper, but they were still very good. Thanks!

NEVER buying sloppy joe sauce again!  I took the advice of another reviewer and instead of 3/4 cup ketchup, I used 1/2 cup of ketchup and 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce...SO GOOD!  My husband took one bite and could not stop talking about how delicious this was!  I think that next time I make this, I will double the sauce recipe, because we like our sloppy joes extra sloppy :).  Thank you so much for an absolutely amazing, quick, and easy recipe!

Everyone in our house loved these. I used spicy brown mustard because that's all I had, and upped the brown sugar an extra tsp to off-set the spice. Didn't use salt or pepper, it didn't need it! Oh, I also used ground turkey like I do as often as possible. Great!

When finding that I was out of the canned sauced, I made this. It was very quick and my boys (13 & 7) loved it; said it was much better than the canned sauce.

I called my friends and told them about these slopy joes I made!!! and it was the first time too! This recipe did not dissapoint me at all! I will use this recipe from now on to make these delicious sloppy joes! I had to tweak it a bit, so i added A-1 steak sauce to the mix and some tomato paste as well, but they came out awesome and were gone as soon as the family got the first taste!

I added some BBQ sauce to the mixture and omitted the brown sugar. I ended up adding quite a bit more ketchup than the recipe calls for because it seemed really dry. The final result was very tasty, we both enjoyed our meal.

I grew up without ever eating sloppy joes. So when I had my first one I was excited. It was a Manwich and it was awful. I have never had one since. Now that I have two boys who have had sloppy joes at school (and loved them), I am on a hunt for a good recipe. This is it! I followed some other person's advice and only used 1/2 c ketchup and 1/4 c bbq sauce and omit the brown sugar. I pureed the onion and bell pepper in a blender before adding it to the beef. My boys don't like the veggie looking stuff so I had to be a little sneaky. I ate mine with toasted corn tortilla chips (kinda like a chili) and it was fabulous.

This was a great recipe! Brought back all kinds of old memories. I didn't use the brown sugar, BUT I bet it's just as good. I used KC Masterpiece bbq sauce instead.

My husband doesn't really like sloppy joes but he did like this recipe.  I thought it was much better than any mix or canned sloppy joes you can get in the grocery store and I didn't think it needed any more spices but I can see if you are one who likes hot and spicy that you would want to kick this one up a bit.  Excellent recipe - I highly recommend it.

I absolutely hate sloppy joes from a can, such as manwich, but I decided to give this recipe a try and I LOVED IT!!  The only thing that I would change would be to add less sugar because my husband and I found it to be a bit too sweet.  Thank you so much for a sloppy joe recipe that I can enjoy!

I made this for dinner tonight and the kids and I loved it.  I didn't add the green pepper since I didn't have any, but used everything else in the recipe and we all were pleased.  I will be making this again.

Excellent!!! Both my picky eaters ate it and asked for seconds.  Next time I'll double or triple it and freeze leftovers for later.  It was a small 6 servings.

This recipe is one of the best recipes that I have used from this website.  I make it a couple times a month.  Leftovers reheat well and are also good on tortilla chips.  YUM!  My children absoutely love these Sloppy Joes.  Way better than the canned mix to add to ground beef.  Kudos!

Yummy! Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious!  This will definitely be added to the dinner rotation, but I think next time I'll cut down the brown sugar - the ketchup has enough sugar in it already!

So easy and so very delicious!  I took the advise of others and doubled the sauce and it comes out perfect every time.  No special trip to the store - just use what we have on hand every day for an easy and tastey meal!  MMMMMM!

This is a great recipe!  Not too ketchup-y (which is extremely easy to get), and just the right amount of tang. I added a bit of cumin to mine for a little smoky background.  My picky husband raved!

Made this last week to get out of going to the grocery store. Wasn't much in the fridge but I had what this called for. It turned out fantastic!! My husband isn't wild for Manwiches but he raved over this. Definitely a keeper. Also, my picky (altho getting better) almost 5year old loved them! I browned my ground beef, peppers and onions in the morning and then just put everything in the crock pot on low and let it go til DH got home from work that evening, served with macaroni salad and potato chips. FANTASTIC!!

I am rating this for my husband.  he loved it and asked me to save this one for him!  I added a little more sugar than called for, but pretty much followed the rest of the recipe..  Thanks for helping me make one of DH's favorites from yester-year a success.

My husband loved this! I took someone's advise and added a teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce and two tsp of vinegar and when it started to get a bit dry I poured in a little chicken broth to 'wet' it. Delish!!!

This was really easy and very delicious. I use my own homemade ketchup, and I would have used a bit more if I hadn't run out! I also threw in a 1/2 t of molasses and only used 1 t of sugar.

This recipe was okay until I added a few items...I added sun-dried tomatoes to the beef cooking, after all was said and done I tasted and it was missing something so I added barbeque seasoning, cumin, sage, adobo seasoning, and crushed red pepper seasoning.

Very good. I didn't have bell pepper but it didn't seem to need it. I followed the directions then added a little bbq sauce. Had plenty for a family of 3 and some leftovers for the next day. Thanks for such an easy recipe.

This recipe was great.   Great flavor, easy to prepare.  Enough said!    No more manwiches for me.   This is my Sloppy Joe recipe from now on.   Better that Hunt's Manwich sauce any day!!!!!

This is a great recipe.  The only thing that I changed was to replace the regular yellow mustard with some mustard-based bbq sauce because I was all out.  These were great and I will definitely make again.

I've made this many times and it always is delicious and simple.  I make mine with ground turkey.  It's much better than the canned stuff and not that much more work...worth it.

Made the recipe as written, turned out fantastic!  My husband and I both really enjoyed them.  It was my first time trying Sloppy Joes without using Manwich.  I did find it had a little bit of a sweeter taste than Manwich though - while it was great I think next time I might leave out the brown sugar and try some yummy bbq sauce instead as some other suggested.(wanted to make the "real" recipe first and then try some experimenting)  We will definitely be making these again!!

I omitted the green bell peppers and forgot to add the mustard, but the sloppy joes turned out delicious. They were a big hit and so easy to make. Thank you for this fabulous, simple recipe!

A great recipe because it's so simple, and the ingredients are things I usually have on hand. I added some barbeque sauce as another reviewer suggested and cut the brown sugar, and now I've been told there's no need to buy the canned stuff again. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband decided to play cook and use this website since I always do.  He loved these!  He did make one adjustment that was awesome - he added a few slices of bacon that he salt and peppered and then crumbled in. Oh it was good!

This family stand-by was absolutely original--zesty sweet! I usually use tons of worcestire, but this was great without it. Sauteing the onions and garlic with the beef was a great trick. My 4 picky palates asked for seconds! Of course, I had to skip the bell pepper. This will be my new give-away meal for moms with new babies, with a loaf of crusty french bread and a crunchy salad.

This was too sweet for my tastes, but my kids loved it.  I think I'll reduce the ketchup next time and see if that cuts the sweetness for me.

This is a very tasty sloppy joe recipe. I have made it several times and the kids have asked if it is the recipe or the "store" kind. They are always excited when I tell them it is the homemade version. I wanted to give it a 4 1/2, but that is not an option. I think the taste is really good, but not "blow-me-a-way" good, but I gave it a 5 because I didn't think it only deserved a four. Just the right amount of spice and flavor. Would definitely be a good recipe to make for guests because nothing is too overpowering about the recipe. I have had some sloppy joes where it has a distinct mustard flavor...not my favorite! Have made this at least 3 times now.

This was my first attempt at sloppy joes, and they were delicious!  I think the serving size is a bit misleading, because I had 1.25 lb of meat, and it only made 5 servings.  So adjust accordingly.  I omitted the green peppers, and slightly increased the amount of sauce, though I didn't completely double it.  So quick and easy, too!

This was very good, simple and quick. I knew with a hungry husband and two fast growing teenage stepsons that one pound of ground beef would not go very far. I doubled the recipe, but used one pound of ground beef and one pound of country pork sausage. With the green bell pepper and onion I took the chopping a step further. The boys don't care for onion and pepper very much. I knew it would be good in it, so I pulverized it in my mini food processer. Blended it in the meat and they didn't even know it was there. They raved about it. It is gone!

Mixed reviews at my house. My husband loved the dish. My three year old didn't eat much of it and I had to force myself to swallow it. I was very disappointed. I will never make this again. Had it not been for my husband (who will eat anything) liking it, I would rate this a 1.

I like Sloppy Joes, but they are not usually a favorite.  I didn't have quite enough ketchup so I added a little Red Hot sauce.  I also don't like green peppers, so I did not add them.

I have made this twice now and both times it got great reviews from everyone!  Followed the recipe to a T.  However, both times I found myself adding Ketchup, just didn't have the sloppy we are use to.  Fantastic Recipe, its a keeper.

Very easy- ingredients I had on hand- great flavor- it's all good. I think I may try less brown sugar and a touch of Worcestershire sauce as mentioned by another. 'Glad to have a great basic recipe.

It's good, yes, however it is definitely too dry. I added a 1/4 cup of water like one of the previous reviewer's suggested and I still found it to be a bit too dry. So next time I will add more ketchup and leave out the green peppers because I'm not a big fan of them. I'd probably add more onion, too.

So darn tasty!  I double the sauce as others have suggested and used with ground turkey.  My husband (who says ground turkey "tastes weird") raved about these!  Even my picky toddler was licking her fingers.  I have made this several times and it's always a welcome dinner. Thanks for this recipe.

very good recipe.  I took another person's suggestion of substituting bar-b-que sauce for a portion of the ketchup.  The next time I think I will try it with a little less sauce.  Anyway, it was still great.  All 3 of my kids wanted seconds! Even my 3 year old who is very picky!  Will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing.

Excellent recipe!  Lean ground beef is best since it doesn't make the bread so soggy (and reduces the fat). The green pepper definitely made it!  Only changes I made were I added a little water during cooking since the mixture did run really thick.  I also added a few drops of Worcestershire sauce, extra garlic powder and black pepper.  I had leftover hotdog buns so I served them open faced with a knife and fork and a side of chips.  An instant hit!

This is an excellant recipe.  I can use the ingredients I have on hand.  The end result is delicious, with no leftovers.  I've been looking a long time for a good sloppy joe recipe, that is easy, as well as tasty to replace the canned sauce I usually buy.

my family went wild! This was by far,the best recipe for sloppy joes that I have tried. I did add alittle more mustard and used brown splenda instead of brown sugar. It got very thick so I thinned it out a bit with a little tomato juice.Next time (very soon) I will make it with brown sugar.yummy!

My hubby said it was to dry, but I really liked it. I used extra lean ground sirloin so that's probably why he felt it was dry. I think it was great so I give it a 5 star.

I'm 28 and never had a sloppy joe. I've never been a fan of onions, so I never tried one. So I finally made them, and yea! I skipped the onion, which I think made the mix a bit sweet. But this is a keeper.

I substituted ground turkey for the beef and it still turned out moist and delicious.  My boyfriend, aptly named joe, said they were the best he'd ever tasted.  Will become a regular recipe in this household.  The only reason I didn't give it a five was because it tasted a bit "ketchupy", but yummmy nonetheless

This is an awesome recipe and incredibly easy to make.  It's a tad on the sweet side though, so may do something to adjust that next time I make it.  Also, for every 1 lb of meat, expect to serve about 2 people!  Everyone wants seconds!

Husband made this and I didn't actually get a chance to taste it but, he said it was pretty good.  He, of course, added a few additions as he always does to make it "his own" but a great recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Great!  Followed the recipe ingredients almost exactly.  Upped everything up for 1.5 lbs meat, and added some recommended oatmeal for stickiness.  Also only simmered for about 15 minutes. Boyfriend and his friend loooved it. =)  Will definitely make again.

I also put this in a crockpot after browning the ground beef.  It was excellent!  I put some veggies that I needed to use up into the food processor and added them to the mix in the crockpot and no one could tell, they just ate them up.

This was good enough where I'll be following the first reviewer's suit and no longer buy the canned stuff! Shoot, I won't even buy the premade stuff in the refridgerated section of the store anymore! Not only is it good enough, but even cheaper in the long run if you eat this often enough! :) Thanks for contributing this! :)

I am not a lover of Sloppy Joes but these are great!  My husband has always wanted me to make Sloppy Joes for him but I never have liked any of the receipes I have tried--until now!  The first time I made them, I recalculated the recipe and fed a crowd of 30 people--there wasn't a drop left!  Each time I have made these I have doubled the sauce ingredients.  Yum-O!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was great!  The only thing I did differently was to add minced garlic in addition to the garlic powder.  Next time I will probably just use the minced garlic.  They would be wonderful either way, though.  Thanks so much for the great recipe.

very good! my 5 year old & 20 month old loved it. I added a few dashes of worchestire sauce and it was excellent. Also added a bit of water, it would have burned while simmering if I hadn't.

It wasn't what I expected Sloppy Joes to taste like. It just tasted like "ketchuped" meat. Not a fan. But it's cheap and uses ingredients you usually have on hand.

This was a great recipe!  I used ground Turkey Breast instead of ground meat and I did not have any green pepper.  I used a little bit of olive oil to brown the ground turkey and onions.  This was the best sloppy joe I ever had!  I can not wait for lunchtime!

Very good recipe. My family thought it was a bit too sweet so I will omit the brown sugar next time. I browned the ground beef, onions, and peppers and threw it in the slow cooker with the other ingredients for a few hours. Quick and easy to throw together!

Great recipe!  Quick, easy and tasty.  My son (16) made it and said that there is no need to by the canned stuff again.  He did  find it a bit dry so he added a 1/2 can of tomato soup, which added just the right amount of sauce to it. Will definitely make again.

Very solid recipe! Will definitely make again.   But I would not recommend the slow cooker preparation, which is what I used (3-4 hours on low), because while the sauce was excellent, the ground meat seemed too dry. Next time, I will simmer it as the recipe directs and then refrigerate and reheat when it's dinnertime.

Best sloppy joe recipe EVER. It's not "sloppy", either, so it stays on the bun and isn't messy to eat. It's absolutley delicious and very easy to make! Sometimes I omit the onion and green pepper it's still delicious. When I have omitted the onion, I did add a little seasoned salt.

I've made this several times following the recipe exactly and we love them! I highly recommend draining & rinsing the hamburger meat after browning, even if there isn't an abundance of fat. These are the perfect sloppy joes.

I liked the simplicity of this recipe but found it to be a bit dry; added some tomato sauce.  Next time, I'll leave out the mustard as it was too overpowering.

These sloppy joes were great! After browning the meat with the onions and peppers (to which I also added a shredded carrot), I combined the meat/veg with the sauce in the crockpot and put it on low for 3 hrs as suggested in another review.  I also modified the sauce - I added another 1/2 cup of ketchup, used about 2 tblspns mustard and brown sugar, upped the garlic powder to match, and used 2 tblspns bbq sauce, just to make it a little more saucy and a tad less ketchupy.

This is very similar to my Mom's recipe except that hers has 1 tbsp of chili powder, catsup is increased to 1 cup and the addition of 2 tbsp of vinegar and 2 tbsp of worchestershire sauce and a splash of tabasco.  We've been using it for ribs as well as hamburger and slow cooked beef.  Amazing!  With the addition of my items, I would give it 5 stars.

Really good homemade sloppy joe sauce. I added water, so it could cook down longer as well as make it more sloppy. I'll probably omit or use less brown sugar next time, since it turned out a bit on the sweet side.

Too sweet.  Not BAD really, but just too much brown sugar flavor.

Just made this for dinner tonight and it was a winner.  I did make a few changes suggested by other reviewers.  I used 1/2 cup of ketchup and 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce.  I also added 1/4 of diced red pepper which seemed to disappear along with the green pepper and onion after having cooked.  This was a good thing since the husband isn't so keen on peppers.  LOL  I added about 1/2 tsp of onion salt instead of plain salt and also added 1 1/2tsp of hickory liquid smoke.  Super Sloppy Sandwich served with coleslaw made for a wonderful meal.  Thanks.

So easy to make and much more tasty than the can (and cheaper since you usually have the ingredients around the house).  Like others, I did make a few modifications.  I increased the onions and green peppers to 1/2 cup and sprinkled garlic salt and pepper on the meat while browning.  I also added a little (about 2 tbsp) BBQ sauce and found the need to add a little water to the mixture while it was simmering.  It was perfect!  I will never use the canned stuff again!!!

We are not fans of Sloppy Joes BUT I found this recipe and decided to try it for a Sunday evening meal.  My husband and I both enjoyed it - had seconds!  The only change I made was to add some chicken broth to the meat while it was simmering - that added more flavor and some additional sauce.  This is a keeper.

A dream come true! My husband REFUSED to eat any Sloppy Joes that were not out of the Manwich can, until today! I made this recipe for him and didn't tell him how I made it until after he ate it. Needless to say he loved it and asked me to make it again for dinner soon! Thanks for the recipe!

This is the easiest sloppy joe recipe I've ever come across and it's yummy too. I cut the brown sugar in half only because I'm not a huge sweets person, but other than that it was perfect how it was already.

I've made this recipe a few times, and every time it's turned out great. I've done it strictly as the recipe says and it turns out just fine, and I've also added in various things that me and my fiancee like or increased some things (like the amount of onions) depending on our own preferences. Either way, the recipe is worth a 5. I would note, however, that for me and my fiancee increasing the recipe to 8-12 servings (1 1/2 - 2lb of beef) is just about right for us, as 1lb doesn't seem like enough for two.

I made these when our kids came home for the holidays.  There were 10 of us and not a crumb was left even though I increased the servings to 24.  Excellent basic recipe that can be spiced up or used as is.  Thanks for the great "joes".

This was a great recipe! I sauted the green bell pepper and onion and then added the ground beef. I also used a little more brown sugar than the recipe called for. My parents are always telling me to make this for them!

This is my girls favorite sloppy joe recipe. I dont always put bell pepper in as I dont care for it or I put thick slices in and let it flavor the meat and remove it before serving. Other than that I cook it per the recipe. Thanks

The only thing I know how to cook is eggs in the morning.  after losing my wife, I decided that instead of heating up a can of beans for lunch and supper, I would try to cook something.  This was the first recipe I tried.  
It is great, EXCEPT, my memory is not what it used to be, I used one CUP of mustard instead of one teaspoon.  :)  good thing I like mustard.  Next time I make it, I will only use one teaspoon.  Even with the STRONG mustard taste, I could tell this was a great recipe.

Better than any sloppy jo sauce from a can!!  I made it in the crock pot, adding just a little more ketchup, mustard and brown sugar.  I also added extra onions and green peppers and put a side of mashed potatoes with it.  Fantastic!

This was fantastic, I sauteed the onions and red pepper separately with fresh garlic, we like them caramelized. I double the sauce, and instead of all ketchup I used 1/2 ketchup, 1/2 baby Rays BBQ sauce.
A keeper...thanks!

I had my doubts about the mustard in this recipe, but the combination of flavors was really quite good.  I doubled the recipe except for the green pepper (because I didn't have much) and cut the brown sugar by about 1/3.  The full amount of brown sugar would have made the recipe too sweet, IMO.  This is a good recipe if you like to pick up your sloppy joes and eat them in the bun.  If you prefer to eat them open-faced, you might want to add some water to make more sauce.  I also like the fact that it's a tasty homemade sauce without the additives that come with the prepared sauces.

This is a great homemade recipe that utilizes what you already have in your pantry and fridge. I didn't add the bell pepper and it was still awesome. I did add 3 cloves of garlic. Other than that, I would not change a thing. Perfect. Thank you!

I didn't think I liked sloppy joes... Until this recipe. Easy and so good! We don't change a thing, other than to double it.

I like the convenience of making this from scratch, not having to buy sauce in the can. I can make it less "sloppy" or extra "sloppy"   Thank you Tamara

I made this recipe with Jenni-O Ground Turkey (20 oz) and it was just YUM YUM!  My family loved it so much.  I am definately going to add it into my regular menu schedule!  I threw just a tiny dash of cayenne in there and it tasted wayyy better than Manwich- which is my husbands favorite and he begs for it.  Thanks for this great recipe. 

I will use it again and again!

ABSOLUTELY PERFECT!!! We made the Sloppy Joe the Plumbers (ha ha) for our election night party and everyone loved them! I usually make a few substitutions with recipes but followed this one exactly--it's perfect! I'll never buy Manwich again!

I would have given this 5 stars, because my husband LOVED it, but I decided to rate 4 stars based on my opinion of it.  It was pretty good, and I'll make again because the hubby loved it.

Very quick, easy& tasty. I did 1/2 cp. BBQ sauce & 1/2 cp ketchup. I added some minced garlic to the meat& used a red pepper instead. I did cut back on the garlic powder.  Turned out delicious I had kids licking the plates!!

I found this recipe on here a few months ago and have made this many times since then. I'm not a huge sloppy joe fan, but these are awesome! My husband says they are the best he's ever had!! I did add about a tbsp of worcestershire( as suggested by some members), and I doubled the recipe tonight because in the past one pound of ground beef is gone before we know it. So, hopefully with doubling it we can have leftovers tomorrow. And these are leftovers I know won't go bad in the fridge :)

much better than the canned stuff.  easy to make.  just brown some ground beef and add some stuff, simmer, and pack it on a bun....mmmm mmmm good!!!!

definetly use bbq sauce in place of half the ketchup.  I reccomend masterpiece bbq sauce.

We made this and did the improvement that others suggested. It turned out just okay. I used a combo of ground beef and ground turkey. It may have just been the turkey that gave this an odd taste. What ever it was the kids wouldn't eat it even though it was covered in cheese and the hubby and I thought it was edible but not some thing we'd want again. Good thing I made a double batch and have so many leftovers!

Works great using ground turkey instead of beef and using half bbq sauce along with ketchup

Totally taste! Can be a little sweet but the brand of ketchup can affect this. I added a little chili sauce and less sugar. Not sure where they got 6 servings as this only fed my husband and I with no leftovers. Maybe because its soo good... Next time I'll double the recipe. Dont cook it much longer than the 30 mins. or it wont have much sauce...

VERY tangy and flavorful.  I enjoyed this but I can see that it may be a little too tangy for some, maybe a little more brown sugar next time.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe is the best...  We made it for our community luncheon at our plant and it got many, many compliments.  It is easy to make and tastes great - people keep coming back for more.  We never have any leftovers when we serve these sloppy joes.

This recipe is sooo good! I am not a huge fan of sloppy joe's but with 3 kids who love them, I get requests for them a lot. Everyone loved these, they were really, really good. I always have all of the ingredients on hand, especially helpful recipe to have when pressed for time. These have a great flavor and are so much better than any canned sauce. These will now be a staple in our home. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

I thought this was good. I added some banana peppers, used only 1 teaspoon sugar, hot sauce and some unsweet barbaque sauce. I didnt want to change it that much but alot of reviewer said It was too sweet and I cant stand sweet meals. While it was still alittle sweet the bbq gave it that extra push it needed.(had with tator tots) Id probally make this again. Like once every 3 months meal.

This reminds me of my Mom's recipe when I was growing up. My kids really loved it and it's great fuel for volleyball practice. We used red pepper instead of green and it was great.

FANTASTIC!  I have been craving a sloppy joe and because of these reviews I tried it!  I added more ketchup and a swirl of barbeque sauce (Kraft, Hickory Smoke).  FA-BU-LOUS!  Oh, I also added real garlic instead of the powder (2 cloves).

This was a little ketchupy for me but my kids liked them.  Next time I may cut back slightly on the ketchup and substitue with something like chili sauce or tomato sauce. Will definately make again.

Wow! Absolutely delicious! I've been craving a sloppy joe all week. The Manwich sauce of today doesn't taste like it did when I was a kid but this does. Perfect. Wouldn't change a thing and it was a breeze to make.

Made a HUGE batch of this for a party we were throwing.  I wanted something that I could make ahead of time and just serve out of a crockpot.  This was perfect!  I diced the green peppers and onions up very fine (to try and sneak it past the picky eaters).  And I substituted barbecue sauce for about a third of the ketchup.  Everyone was raving and couldn't believe it didn't come out of a can!

This is very good, sweeter than some sloppy joes.  I enjoyed it very much.  It's a little dryer than some.

This is a great sloppy joe recipe.  I left out the green peppers (they don't like me!) and followed the rest of the recipe to the letter.  Husband loves them.  Have made them twice this week!  Thanks to the original poster!

I LOVE this recipe!!  I hate green peppers, but by chopping them very finely, the sandwiches are wonderful.  If I could give you 10 stars, I would.
Thank you SO much for sharing!!

This was SOOO much better than the canned stuff.  My husband was leary of the bell pepper, but once he tried it (and I convinced him it was in the canned ingredients) he loved it.  He had me write the recipe down so he could use it again.  A couple of my kids thought it was too sweet so I may cut down the brown sugar a tad.  THANKS!

Definitely 5 stars for Sloppy Joes. I am typically not a fan of them at all, but my brother-in-law used this recipe one night and I was amazed at the difference between these and the kind I'm usually served at functions. These definitely aren't as saucy as most, but that is a huge plus for me. Everyone else seemed to love these too. Red peppers were also used along with the green.

I just tried this recipe last night for supper, and I must tell you this will be a favorite at our house from now on . My hubby does not like things too sweet, so I only added 1 tsp of sugar to the recipe. It was still great.   Thanks !

Very tasty, lots of great flavor!  My husband and I usually like things a little spicier, so I added 2 jalapeno peppers and 1 yellow pepper (sweet & mildly spicy).  It was delicious!

Very good and simple. It sure makes buying a can of Sloppy Joe sauce seem silly. I can save money by doing it this way and have the same great flavor. Seems smart to me!

We did not like this.  It was way too sweet even with the changes I made. I added garlic and chili powder, replaced part of the ketchup with chili powder.  I gave it 3 stars because it was edible.

These were ok - I used mostly ketchup but did add about a 1/4 - 1/3 cup of BBQ sauce to make the 3/4 cup, but the BBQ is what I tasted the most.
Not out of this world but decent enough.

My aunt made this in the late 50's. This recipe is the closest to that yummy taste of he Sloppy Joes of the past. My aunt had five kids plus two more cousins for the summer. She made beef go a long ways.
Yummmy flavor for yummy flavors.

This was the sloppy joe recipe I grew up with!  I thought it was a big family secret!  It's an easy recipe and you can adjust everything to taste.  This is by far our family's favorite sloppy joe recipe.

I made this today and it's wonderful! I doubled the recipe so I could freeze some for later. I doubled all the ingredients except for the Ketchup. I used 1/2 cup Ketchup, 1/2 cup BBQ sauce and 1/2 cup Tomatoe Puree. I also added 2 diced fresh tomatoes from my garden. Very good, just the right about of sweetness and savory. Thanks so much!

My family would only eat sloppy joes made from a mix (no noticeable vegies!) I tried this recipe (chopped the vegies good) and have had raves ever since.  Now my daughter asks for this (she never eats sloppy joes) and my husband (who has been eating dried sloppy joe mix for the last 30 years!) states, "This is the best mix yet!"  I won't tell him if you don't...

I liked this recipe alot. Very quick and simple. I might have had sloppy joe's atleast 10 times in my whole life if not less and I'm 31, my boyfriend on the other hand,who is a manwhich freak didn't care to much for them but he did eat one and come back for a second one. For me though they were perfect and for him he'll stick to his canned stuff he said. Thanks for the easy recipe. I'll try it with gound chicken next time.

Easy and very tasty. I tripled the recipe and took it for my son's award banquet, I was disappointed when there was none left to take back home.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!!

These aren't sloppy sloppy joes. I thought they were perfect. I don't need to make a mess to enjoy a sloppy joe, but my husband wanted more sauce. If you want more slop, I recommend doubling the sauce. The only change I made to the recipe was leaving out the green peppers, because my husband doesn't like them.

I have always hated sloppy joes because I had always had them from a can. My family loves them though, so I saw this recipe and thought I'd try it. It was so easy, and I had everything I needed to make it already at home. It was so yummy and got better and better the longer it cooked. Thank you! My family loved it as well and we all have agreed no more cans!! (I did add a generous teaspoon of worchestire sauce)

I thought I'd try this out as I'd never had a Sloppy Joe before (Being English) and so gave it a go on the 4th of July. 

I guesstimated most of the measurements and added BBQ Sauce as others had suggested instead of the brown sugar. 

I'm not sure if it tasted anything like it was supposed to but it was good comfort food and my boyfriend demolished most of the leftovers before I'd even finished my first helping!

Good The-Cupboard-is-almost-bare fodder as you always have condiments and it only needs the basics otherwise.

This is the best sloppy joe recipe! I have tried it several ways and it always turns out delicious. Sometimes I do not add the bell pepper and I use dried minced onion and you still get that great flavor. This first time I made these I actually forgot to add the brown sugar and they still came out great! Simmering this for at least 30 minutes is absolutely necessary to get that great flavor. Best recipe for these by far!

This recipe got rave reviews in my house!!!  My oldest doesn't really like sloppy joes...mainly because I use the kind from a can, but she loved this recipe and ate 1 and 1/2 sandwiches.  My hubby said to make sure to save this one.  I think it was simple too, made it exactly as stated here.  Will definitely make again!!

The end result of this recipe was great, with one change.  I felt like 3/4 cup ketchup wasn't enough, so in addition to that I added about 1/2 cup or so of barbecue sauce.  It added a nice kick.  Thanks for the great recipe

The only change I made was to use bbq sauce as some had mentioned instead of the sugar and I also used ground turkey. My dh had never had sloppy joes before, since he's from France and now I find them popping up in conversations, which means I'll be making these a lot more.

really good. Although, I substituted about half the ketchup with tomato sauce. Thought the ketchup taste might be strong if I didn't for the kids. I didnt measure exact -just squirted ketchup into measuring cup eyeballed it to half and topped off with tomato sauce. Everyone said it reminded them of childhood meals. A great comfort food.

We just fixed this for dinner tonight and will be making it again, but using pulled pork instead of ground beef.  The sweetness of the sloppy joe sauce mixture was odd with the hamburger meat.  This came out tasting very BBQ-ish.

This recipe is great just as is! I tried it using one clove of crushed garlic instead of powder (I did not have powder on hand)and it was just as good.

Pretty tasty. I used Sweet Baby Ray's honey barbecue sauce in place of the brown sugar, then threw the whole thing into the slow cooker for a few hours.

This recipe is SOOO easy to make, I used a little "Adobo" as I was browning the meat, and substituted 1/4 cup of BBQ sauce for ketchup. My 5 & 3 year old boys absolutely loved it. would highly recomend to anybody looking for a quick meal.

Easy and delicious!  I didn't have enough ketchup so I used about 1/4 cup ketchup and 1/2 cup tomato sauce. I didn't use as much sugar as the recipe called for, only about 1 tbsp.  Very tasty.

WOW! I stumbled upon this recipe out of sheer luck. Since I'm in college, and I only had a few things on hand, I was looking for an easy recipe involving ground beef. My first thought was meatloaf, but I had no eggs, and then I found this bad boy. Sloppy Joes are one of my favorites and I have never tried making them from scratch. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. I don't think I'm ever making another canned version - you can really taste the layers of flavors in this one. 
The only thing I chose to add were:
1 tbs of worsticher sauce (I know I spelled that wrong)
&
about a tsp of cumin.
Fantastic! Not only was it delicious, but  easy and quick. I will definitely be making this again !!!

This has become a family favorite in our house!  I generally use minced dry onions and leave out the green peppers when making it for my family.  This makes up in big batches and freezes quite well.  The recipe is on the sweet side, but we like it that way.

Not to our liking - far too much "sour" from the ketchup.  I may try making sloppy joes again some time, but with plain tomato sauce.

I have not had sloppy joes since i was little, this was just how I remembered it.  Perfect.  I did make mine with Venison ground meat, since I have a freezer full.  Great new way to use venison and it did not taste gamey.

My son has been craving sloppy joes and I didn't want to buy a mix, and didn't have ketchup on hand.  So, starring into the cupboard, I pulled out a can of tomato soup and used 1/2 of it with about 3 tbsp of BBQ sauce to the recipe.  It's mild enough to satisfy a little boys cravings and simple enough for a busy mom's day.  Tastes pretty good -- thanks so much!

I really wanted to give this recipe higher praise, but I couldn't. It was just ok. The flavor was lacking for the pack of a punch sloppy joes are supposed to have.

I made this for my son and husband (doubling the recipe) and I was lucky to get even one sandwich out of the meal!  They devoured it - next time I'll triple the recipe...

My family and I are vegetarians so I had to substitute the meat with Yves Meatless Ground but it came out just as good.  It was a big hit and they wanted more.

Love this recipe, even though I changed it a bit.  Didn't have peppers, used onions; traded the ketchup for taco sauce; omitted the sugar.  Husband loves it and we've made it more than once.

I made a few changes so I'm only giving the original recipe a 4.  With the few changes I would rate ir a 4.5 - 5.  The recipe was great and it will definitely be a repeat for us.  It was easy didn't require alot of multi-tasking which I love.  I made the recipe as instructed, but felt like it needed a few more things once I got it into the pan, so in the end I used about 1 c. of ketchup total and because it didn't seem juicy enough I added about a 1/2 c. of water.  We really didn't taste the bell pepper at all, so perhaps I should have cut it into larger chunks or just omit it next time.  The flavor wasn't lacking without the bell pepper.  It was a little sweet, so next time I'll either cut back on the brown sugar a bit, or add a little more mustard.

I served these with roasted potato chunks seasoned with seasoning salt.  A perfect accompaniment.  I'll probably double the recipe next time and put a container in the freezer for later.

Great recipe.  I added 1/4 cup of barbecue sauce for part of the ketchup.   I'll definitely make this again.  I might add a dash of red pepper sauce.  No more cans for us.  This one is really easy.

This is really good!  Good homemade flavor.  Kids really liked it. (no left overs for lunch the next day)  Had everything for it on hand except green peppers.  Kids don't like them anyway.  Will make again.

A great basic recipe! I doubled it and used 3/4 cup ketchup and 3/4 cup Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Chipotle barbecue sauce and it was delicious! Just the right amount of sauce--not too sloppy. Will definitely use again.

This was much blander than I'd expected it to be, despite adding twice the garlic powder called for. I'd expected more flavor. It was also a bit watery, despite draining as directed.

A nice simple recipe!  I used tomato sauce instead of the ketchup, and I only simmered for about 15 minutes.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe. I like my sloppy joes a little less "sloppy" so the amount of sauce was just perfect. I'll definitely make this again with my changes.

Excellent sloppy joe recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used 1 cup ketchup instead of 3/4.  Also, I was out of green pepper so we went without it and it was still delicious!  My family raved about the sloppy joes.  So much better than Manwich.  This will be our sloppy joe recipe from here on out.  No more canned sauce for us!  Thanks a bunch Tamara!

This was super easy! I made a few adjustments after reading the reviews... I used 1/2 C Ketchup and 1/4 C Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce. YUMMY!! I also used minced garlic instead of garlic powder and I used Dijon Mustard instead of the regular kind. My only change next time would be to add a little cheese to the mix right before serving to make it alittle "gooier".

I was skeptical that this wouldn't be good (main ingredient ketchup?!), but listened to the other reviews and tried it anyways.  I added a touch of bbq sauce and it was AWESOME!!!  I will never buy Manwich again!  (I also didn't add green pepper because I didn't have it and I cut down on the brown sugar.)

We loved this - nothing 'over the top.' I increased all of the ingredients a bit, because I had a 1.4 lb. package of ground beef that I needed to use.

Very good recipe.  I didn't have any green peppers so left them out and I added 1/2 c water and 2T oats to thicken it into not so sloppy joes.  My 3 year old said they were the best "hamburgers" he's ever eaten!!

I never follow recipes exactly, so I had planned on using BBQ sauce along with the ketchup mixture, but found I did not have any.  So, I was forced to follow this recipe exactly.  I'm Oh so glad I did!  Excellent easy recipe.  It was a hit with the kids and the husband that constantly compares my cooking to his mom's.  He gave it 5 stars too.  Thanks so much.  I also never write reviews on recipes, but I couldn't help it this time!

We made these for a family gathering and they were delicious.  They were quite sloppy, a bit sweet, but we'll definitely make again.

This recipe is awesome! Very inexpensive to make! I used pablano peppers instead of the green peppers to add just a little kick. (Be sure to remove all the seeds and wear gloves when you do. Almost all of the painful spice is in the seeds. I can't handle much spicy foods). I have already made this recipe 3 times in the past month! And the last time was with green peppers and was also grrreat!

This recipe made great sloppy joes. The only thing i did differently was subsitute 1/4c ketchup for smoky barbcue sauce and added only 1t. of brown sugar. they were delicious. My boyfriend is asking for them once a week now. thanks.

Finally a really good sloppy joe recipe and so easy. I have made this many times and it is delicious. The only change I make is the green pepper, I use a red or orange simply because I don't like the taste of the green.

Excellent recipe!  I'm not really much for measuring stuff out, so I think I used a little more mustard and brown sugar.  I didn't have any ketchup either so I emprovised with tomato paste and vinegar.  To spice it up I used a little curry and its awesome!

This is a good recipe for sloppy Joe's. I have made it several times and my nephew requests it when he comes over. I omit the green pepper, since my husband doesn't like them, and some times I add red pepper flakes for a bit of a kick. I also butter my hamburger buns and sprinkle them with garlic salt. Really good!

My family really liked these but I did think they were too sweet.  The reason: I used 1/2 ketsup and 1/2 BBQ sauce and then 1/2 of the brown sugar (BBQ is already loaded with sugar so next time I will leave out the brown sugar). I added worchestershire sauce when I was trying to cut the sugar taste.  Will make again.

Love this recipe! I left out the green pepper but I chopped up 1 jalepeno and sauteed it in. It was awesome with just a little zip! I also added some worcestershire sauce.

I'm only giving this three stars because I had to do quite a bit of tweaking to get it right for my taste.  As a base for making sloppy joes your 'own' (without the help of Manwich) it's okay.  It was a little too dry and crumbly for my family.  Since first using this recipe, I double it now and I actually use one can of Manwich (can't believe I'm admitting that) just for the sloppy factor and then add ketchup, mustard, brown sugar, etc. (The brown sugar is the key to this recipe, so whatever changes you make, don't skip the sugar, if anything add a little more!)

Almost anything is better than a can. I did like the the suggestion by ARNOLDIRR about making extra and freezing it in the cupcake holders and once frozen you can individually place into freezer bags. (sometimes I like adding small amounts of cooked white rice to the mix- makes a good filler)

I am giving this 3 stars because I also had to doctor it up to give it some flavor. I sprinkled in some chili powder and more water.  Tasted much better after the chili powder was added. Next time I will try using less b. sugar as it was a bit too sweet as others suggested & maybe some worchestershire sauce too!

Very easy and very tasty.  It was not too "sloppy" and stayed on the bun well.  It was delicious on a toasted ciabatta roll.  As suggested by other reviewers, I substituted 1/2 of the ketchup with BBQ sauce.

These sloppy joes are sooo much easier than using the store bought mix, and they taste better too!  I added about 1 cup of water, and a bit more ketchup since the meat is sort of dry, and they are supposed to be "sloppy".  I also added some hot sauce and red pepper flakes to give it a little kick.  Yum!

This is a really good recipe! I used ground turkey instead of ground beef to make it lower in fat.  I used half a red onion, half a green pepper, and a diced tomato.  Like a few others I used 1/2 cup of ketchup and 1/4 cup BBQ sauce.  I found myself having to add half a cup of water and maybe another 1/4 cup of ketchup because otherwise it would have been too dry.  Will definitely make again with my changes!

Love it because it's quick, easy, and uses ingredients I usually have on hand. Flavor is great, kids love it, although I prefer it with 2 Tbsp. of brown sugar rather than the 3 Tbsp. recommended.

These were great.  I will never by the canned again.  I took the advice of others and doubled the sauce.  I used the recommended amount of brown sugar and they were sweet but that is the way I like them.  I am sure they would be good with bbq sauce too!  Thanks for sharing.

Yum! Great recipe... I veganized it by switching the ground beef for Yves meatless ground. I also skipped the brown sugar and used 1/2c tangy BBQ sauce and 1/4c ketchup.

Ok I gave this 4 stars because my kids liked it. My husband and I on the other hand did not. It was dry and didn't have any flavor to us. It really needs to have the sauce part doubled to be a sloppy joe. I may try it again because of the kids, and I will double that part. It needs some flavor.

I made 3 servings worth of the Sloppy Joes (I cut the recommended servings in half).  It was a tasty and easy recipe, but a few things:

It was a bit sweet as others had stated, so I added about 1/2 tablespoon of soy sauce to mellow out the sweetness and to give it more flavor.  

It was pretty thick, so I added a full cup of water--the mixture sucked it right up and it became more "sloppy" as I like it not so thick.

I like to eat veggies so I added more veggies than the portion called for and added 1/2 onion and one whole green bell pepper in with the ground beef. My fiancee told me that sloppy joes usually dont have much veggies in it, but I felt it didnt hurt the recipe (although, that may not have been the point :D  )  

I was very surprised at the taste of the dish with so few ingredients.  Thank you for the recipe.

the best i've ever made, but i made some alterations (like most every other reviewer).  still, it was a great base to work from.  my only comment is that it doesn't feed as many as it claims, but maybe we load our buns up more than is normal.

Good recipe.  Quick and easy.  I didn't really measure out everything just added stuff and tasted which is how I usually cook.  It turned out well.  Could use a little less brown sugar.  My husband is not a fan of sweet sauces.  But it was a quick easy recipe and tasted fine.

I forgot how much I love sloppy joes!!!  I didn't want all the bread that goes with them, so I served my sloppy joes over brown rice.  Also I didn't have ketchup, so I used Heinz 57, I think it was even better then regular ketchup.

Never again will we have sloppy joes from a can.  These are so good.  The only thing I did different is I cut the brown sugar to 1 1/2 t. and added 1 1/2 t. of bbq sauce.  It still had the sweetness, but also gave it some zing!

I like the flavor very much, but just to dry for me. I will make again and double up on the sauce. Thank you for the recipe

I thought this recipe was really good, but my boyfriend absolutely LOVED it!  I added a few splashes of worchestshire sauce and hot sauce, and 1/4 c of water to let it simmer.  Only 4 stars bc I didn't like the green peppers.  Definitely going to make again though!!

I had to use some ground beef before it expired and I tried this recipe and was pleasently suprised.  I add cole slaw on the top of my sloppy joes and bbq sandwiches.  It must be a southern thing.

Perfect recipe, would not change a thing. I doubled the recipe and it was enough for about 8 sandwiches (not 12). I served them with tater tots for a football game, the meal was a huge hit.
I have made them with beef and ground turkey.  Both were great, so go with turkey if you want to make it a tad healthier.

I've made this a few times now.  My family (including my 2 picky children) love this.  I found I had to really "water it down" big time since it seems so thick after adding the sauce.  Even with all the extra liquid, it's still tasty.  Oh, don't leave out the green onions, it adds significantly to the taste.

These were SO great!! Some reviews griped about them not being sloppy enough, but I like them neater. Also, I didn't drain the meat (I buy lean beef so I don't have to drain it!).
I also used fresh minced garlic instead of powder and a teaspoon of worcestershire sauce. Awesome!

I would have given this a 5, but the mixture was very, very dry and I ended up adding about 1/4 cup of water (no broth on hand) which worked out pretty good after it cooked down.  The flavor was great and I will use this again, maybe adding tomato sauce or beef broth to make them sloppier.

Awesome! I can honestly say this is the one I will continue to make! It is the easiest and best flavor I have ever had! I made it without green pepper only because I didn't have one at the time. I will add it next time and I'm sure it will just be that much better :)

We all loved this recipe.  Considering what's needed to make these, I will never buy Manwich (or any other brand) again.  Next time I'll try adding the barbecue.  Very easy and quick to make.

My husband had never had sloppy joes from scratch and I had never had sloppy joes PERIOD. We both enjoyed the meal very much and the kids loved it, too! My husband still likes the canned kind better, but he gave this recipe his seal of approval as well. :)

This freezes and reheats very well.

Tastes great but you need to double the sauce or it will be way too dry.  Also you do not need to add nearly that much sugar unless you have a sweet tooth!

This had a nice flavor, but was way too dry. Plus it was just missing something. I added Worchestershire Sauce, an entire can of tomato puree (that cut the sweetness a bit.) I added Tabasco (that's the law here in New Orleans)
I will make again, but cut way back on the sugar and add more tomato sauce or puree. It needs some spices.

This was easy and delicious! I agree that I will never make from a can again. I used only two teaspoons of the brown sugar as well and think next time I will only use one. 

Thanks again, it was great!

These were better than I expected, but something about it wasnt quite right. I think it was just the brown sugar maybe. I would cut back on or eliminate it altogether. It had a sweet taste I didnt like. Others said it was good, but didnt really eat a lot, I had a lot of left overs at my party.

I have to admit that I have never heard of " Sloppy Joes " (probley because I live over the water in the UK) but it sounded good and I made it out of curiosity. It was delicious and I will certainly try a few of the alternative recipes. I have just retired and getting a lot of enjoyment cooking new meals. I find this site one of the best and I hope you dont mind an old limey pindching a couple of your american recipes.

I just made this recipe and I have to agree with everyone else--it's very good. I've never been a fan of Sloppy Joe's, but this recipe sure made me into one. I did modify the recipe based on one of the reviewer's and that was instead of placing 3/4C of ketchup, I placed 2/3C ketchup and 1/4C of bbq. Serve with a side of cole slaw and you'll be good to go!

Very Good...  Quick and Easy... I havent made sloppy joes in a long time because that canned stuff is icky.

I did a few things different only because I was limited to items on hand.  I used red bell pepper and white onion and cooked it down before I added it to the meat.  It was great.  I also had to use a can of tomato sauce with my ketchup because I didnt have enough.   

Thanks for the receipe.

My family loves Manwich, but I hate it.  So I tried this recipe and it was awesome, except it was lacking a little worchestire sauce.  I will definitely make these again, with a little tweaking... : )

Was a little skeptical about this recipe b/c it seemed so simple- but both my husband and I were totally impressed!  I used ground turkey and added a little bit of vinegar + cayenne pepper (as mentioned by a previous reviewer) to tone down the sweetness... it was an awesome, quick weeknight meal!  Thanks.

Very kid-friendly recipe.  This is nice and thick so it stays on the bun (providing you simmer as directed).  This one consistently makes my menu.

This is a great recipe.  Much easier and tastier to make homemade sloppy joes than to buy the canned stuff.  I didn't have enough ketchup, so I  ended up with 1/2 cup barbecue sauce and 1/4 ketchup.  Next time, I will try it the original way, but this way was delicious!

This recipe is messy, easy, and just awesome!  My fiance and I loved this!  I halved the recipe for just the two of us.  I like making things from scratch than using pre-made, canned stuff that's got Lord-knows-what in it.  Thank you for sharing!

Absolutely wonderful. I did the same as another poster and only used 2/3 ketchup and 1/3 bbq sauce and it was just perfect. Hubby requested it twice in the first week i made it!!

I wish I could give this 4.5 stars. The flavor was very nice, although a bit too sweet for my preference. Also, I left out the green pepper because my husband doesn't like them. All in all, I'm going to keep this recipe in my rotation.

Incredibly easy and really very good taste. Have to admit I can't stand peppers so I left those out but other than that, it was excellent. We ate it open-faced on toast with a piece of melted american cheese. A great, quick meal.

Very, very good!  I usually don't have green pepper on-hand, so I add a bit more onion.  And Dijon mustard works fine, too.  I also have used ground turkey and/or ground chicken, with good results.  With a recipe like this, there is no reason to buy the canned stuff.

My hubby said this was okay, but I really liked it!  More importantly, my two and three year olds gobbled it up!  I made a mistake and added a can of seasoned diced tomatoes with the liquid...so I added some quick oats to soak it up and it actually turned out to be a very tasty and chunky mistake!

My husband and I loved this recipe. We ate them up so fast that I had to make more to get us over the NEED to eat them. I ran out of ketchup and used BBQ and a little less broan sugare, probably better then the original way.

We had this for dinner when my FIL was visiting.  Everyone loved it as it was. I thought it was a little sweet.   My husband was kind of scared of me making sloppy joes, but he loved it.  No more cans for us.  Thank you.

I had never made sloppy joes before, and this recipe was great! I added bbq sauce and water to simmer and it was perfect! I also don't like green peppers so I used a red one. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good! I didn't have an onion at home so I used onion powder, and my husband loves BBQ sauce so I used that in place of the ketchup.  It was a hit!

My husband and I both agree this is the best sloppy joe recipe I have tried. HOWEVER, it was a little dry for us. I added an extra 1/2 cup BBQ sauce because we like it to be really sloppy. With the extra sauce it was perfect!!

Wow, just wow!  I added about double the veggies and added two small stalks of celery.  So yummy!  I plan to make a much larger pan of it next time to freeze for later!

This is our most favorite sloppy joe recipe, we been using it for years. Very easy, and can do with what you have on hand, for a super quick dinner. We do omit the green pepper, cause no one here like it, but it still comes out gooood.

I used chili sauce instead of the ketchup and added an 8oz. can of tomato sauce because it didn't seem "sloppy" enough.

So yummy!!!  I use ground turkey and add a few shakes of Worshestershire to "beef"  it up a little.  I'll simmer for awhile or even transfer to a small crock on low for a few hours.  I'll never buy the cans again!

This recipe is so good!  The Sloppy Joes taste delicious, and they're so easy to make!  Another good thing is that the ingredients are probably already in the cabinet or refrigerator, so it's a good last minute meal.

Great recipe.  At the suggestion of others, I replaced some of the ketchup with bar-b-q sauce and left out the brown sugar.  For a more sour flavor which I prefer, I used additional mustard and some lemon juice to taste.  This recipe will become a regular in our house.

This is a great recipe.  I took the advise of other reviewers and substituted 1/2 of the catsup with BBQ sauce.  I also used ground turkey and reduced the amount of sugar to 1Tbs.
My husband said it was just like his Mom used to make

This was NOT what I expected... I used less sugar, thinking I could add more if it needed it and wished I hadn't at all.  It had a very sweet/sour taste to it, not the manwich taste I was looking for.. I probably won't be making this again.  PS: it was th efirst time my hubby or kids have had it, and I was going on and on about how much they will like them, remembering what my Mom served when I was a kid.  They thought i wa crazy LOL.

I made these and they turned out great.  So easy and i just threw it all in the crock pot after cooking the meet to keep it warm until everyone was ready to eat.  My kids had never really had them before and really enjoyed them.  Didn't change a thing!

Wow, I guess I'm in the minority because I really didn't care for this and neither did my family. Maybe we're just not big fans of Sloppy Joes but it just tasted like sweet hamburger.

Yummy & easy to make.  After reading others' reviews, I added a tad more ketchup. My husband thought it was a just little too sweet for his taste, so next time I will lessen the brown sugar.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good.  It wasn't as wet as I would have liked.  It definately wasn't dry.  Next time I may make it with more sauce.  But, I will definately make it again.

This is the best, easiest recipe. This was my first time making sloppy joe and I thoroughly enjoyed it. My boyfriend is a picky eater and a great chef so it's hard to show him up. He asked for seconds! We will definitely make this again.
I used red peppers and had to add extra sauce because it wasn't sloppy enough. I ended up using BBQ sauce because I ran out of ketchup and it was still lovely. I added onion powder, chili powder, and a little more peppers to balance out the flavor. I also used  ground turkey for health reasons. We used wheat bread and had green beans on the side. Enjoy!

Definite keeper!  I did make a few alterations - used yellow peppers instead of green; added 2 Tbsp cider vinegar; many splashes of Worcestershire (it was a lot).  I put in a small can of tomato paste which, of course, made it super thick, then added approx. 1/4 cup of water which helped "sloppy" it up.  Served it on whole wheat buns with carrot sticks.

This is the first recipe on allrecipes that has compelled me to write a review.  Simply excellent.  I omitted the brown sugar, added about 10 dashes of both worcestershire sauce and tobasco.  Very lightly toasted the buns.  Easy and delicious.

OMG, this was THE best sloppy joe I've ever had.  we were fighting over this one.  I used red peppers b/c I didn't have green.  I don't think it affected the taste.  toasted hamburger buns, spread w/ a thin layer of mayo (miracle whip would be too sweet), added cheese and had baked fries and carrot sticks on the side.  So good!

I doubled the sauce part of the recipe and added a shredded carrot with the onion. My family loved it and asked me to make it more often. personally, I thought it was way too sweet...but I am not a fan of Sloppy Joes. I'll probably make it in bulk and freeze it in single serving sizes.

Great recipe!!!  A little sweet so next time will decrease brown sugar to 2 teaspoons.  I added 1/2 tsp chili powder, and to save time I used 1/4 cup frozed pepper strips and chopped them in food chopper.

These had a nice flavor, different from your ordinary "sloppy joe packet" although, they left an odd after taste. will probably continue to look for another sloppy joe recipe.

I triple this recipe, as it's perfect for a crowd. My changes are adding one can of tomato sauce to keep it moist and I delete the brown sugar, as the ketchup  makes it plenty sweet! DELICIOUS and easy!

Excellent recipe; nice alternative to the traditional sloppy joe.  I have had this "sweeter" sloppy joe many times though, and was expected something more from the rave reviews.

These are the best sloppy joes, as many before me have said. The only thing I changed was added 1/4 c extra ketchup and a couple dashes of worchestshire sauce to make them more sloppy.

This recipe is BORING.  It has potential, but you'd need to add a lot of different flavors to make it better.  I still prefer Manwich.  I may try it again, but I'm going to have to tinker with it a lot.

My family enjoyed this recipe very much. I had to omit the green peppers and onions for family member preference but I used onion powder in place of onions. I also omitted the brown sugar and used Famous Dave's Sweet and Sassy BBQ Sauce. I do not think we will ever go back to Manwich again.

I had to make a few changes based upon what I had in the house. First, instead of regular ketchup, I used curry flavored. Next, I substituted some of the ketchup with BBQ sauce, as others suggested. Finally, I tried making a lower fat version using ground turkey. Turned out great.

Wow! Brings back the memories of how Sloppy Joe´s should taste.  I definately give it 5 stars because it tastes so good and helps me  not be so homesick here in Germany! By the way melted cheddar cheese tastes wonderful on top of the mixture.
Thanks.

I have already made these sloppy joes twice last week and they turned out perfect. Both my husband and son loved them. I just didn't add any sugar because the ketchup sauce was sweet enough, and moreover we, French people usually never put any sugar in our meat dishes. Will definitely make them again!

I've made sloppy joes from a generic brand can a couple times and they weren't popular with my family.  This was much better.  A little sweet for our tastes, we will use half the  brown sugar next time.  I'll definately keep this recipe around for when  quick meal is required.  I made some with "soy ground beef crumbles" as well for our vegetarian daughter.  I served these on fresh whole wheat kaiser rolls with coleslaw on the side.

I thought this was decent but not the best sloppy joe recipe I've ever had.  It was a bit dry.

Great recipe; so easy to make!  My kids absolutely loved this.  I will use this from now on instead of the sauce from the can.  The only change I  made was to use a clove of fresh garlic, minced instead of the garlic powder.

Yummy and easy. Thank you for this recipe. 
Much later: I just picked this recipe again, not realizing it was already in my recipe box. Even better the second time. The brown sugar is just the thing to lift it above and beyond the others.

This is by far, better than the canned stuff.  I did add about 1/4 to 1/2 C. water at the beginning of the simmer for the regular size recipe and it was just right.  My family loved it!!!

My 5 year old son declared me the best cook in the world; my 3 year old daughter who normally doesn't eat meat (other than chicken nuggets) ate a whole sandwich; and my husband loved them also. Thanks so much for this recipe. I am sure I will be making this often.

This was so good!  I did not change anything and it was great. I think I will try the slow cooker next time.  I will never buy manwich again. The ingredients were simple, I had them all in my cupboard.  I did not have to go to the store.  That was a big plus. Thank you Tamara

Wow! It was my first sloppy joe ever because we don't have them here in Belgium. Let me tell you I'll make this again and again and again: it's super yummy, cheap and easy to make! I added a bit more ketchup because I felt it was too thick and a dash of worcestershire sauce. Amazing!

Simply...wonderful. Only change I made was to add a little more ketchup and maybe a half cup of water because we don't like it thick. Teenage sons and husband wolfed this down in no time.  Thanks for sharing.

I haven't eaten this on a bun yet, but it already tastes pretty good.  I was really short on time, and had a lack of ideas for dinner, and this seemed the perfect solution.  I did add a couple of globs of BBQ sauce and I think it might have pretty much ruined the original flavor which was great, but tasted like mustard, which I cannot stand.  So, I think it probably tasted a little better without the BBQ sauce( it's overpowering), but it's still yummy tasting.  I added 1/2 c. water and a 1 T. of quick oats as per other reviews suggested.  I'm excited for dinner!  Thanks for the recipe!

The most awesome and easiest sloppy joes I've ever eaten.  Everyone from 11 and up ate these quickly.  I recommend to double the recipe for left overs.  Only left out green pepper.

This was pretty good, but not the best sloppy joes I've ever had.  I left out the bell peppers and added minced garlic, chili powder, red pepper flakes, additional garlic powder and a few splashes of Worstershire sauce.  I think it might have been better if it was a little bit more saucy.

Pretty tasty!  I too added vinegar and worcestershire, not really to adjust the flavor, but to sloppy it up just a tad.  Although I'm not a fan of soggy bread, and the limited slop was appreciated, it still seemed rather dry.  I also used ground venison in place of beef.  Will make again!

Great easy meal to make. I added 1 tsp. of worstershire sauce for a little extra flavor. Also, I recommend doubling this recipe if you like leftovers for the next couple of nights.

I didn't care for this at all. It was too sweet, and I thought it had too much onion in it. My husband was the only one who liked it out of 6 people.  I even tried spicing it up, but nothing helped. I won't be making this again.

We have never had sloppy joes before, but we will definitely be having them again my children really loved them thought they were the best even the older members of the family said much the same.I also added a can of kidney beans to it as well as a red pepper and it turned out great.Thanks for such a quick easy yummy recipe.

We really liked these but with a few changes.  I decreased the ketchup and added a can of tomato paste, added 1 tsp of Worcestershire sauce and a dash of red pepper.  The sloppiness was just right and they tasted great, much better than the canned stuff.

Well, this was my first ever Sloppy Joe, and all I can say is 'mmmmmm.' Husband, a seasoned SJ veteran, also really enjoyed it! I used less sugar - personal preference - and because I ran out of yellow mustard, I used some horseradish sauce. Tasted great! Thanks, Tamara!

Very good. I listened to previous reviews and only put 1 tsp. of brown sugar. That was definitely enough. I'll probably try adding a can of tomato sauce next time.

This was good, I needed to add a little more ketchup and reduce the brown sugar, to sweet for me and of course added cayenne for a little spice.

I made a triple batch of these sloppy joes (with no modifications) at a recent camping trip and they were a huge hit. I also made a second batch with 1 pound of vegetarian ground "beef" -- also a huge hit!

A definite keeper... this recipe was very tasty, easy to make, and the ingredients called for are generally pantry staples.  For personal preference, I left out the bell peppers and added a couple of dashes of steak sauce for added flavor.  You can easily adjust the sweetness by cutting back on the brown sugar.  A much better solution for sloppy joes than the canned sauces available in grocery stores!

Good base recipe and will use again. 
This time: I added tomato sauce and Worcestershire sauce, used half the brown sugar, used 1/2 hamburger and 1/2 sausage meat, and topped with cheese.  This was pretty good.
Next time: Add chili pepper, and try with only hamburger.

Sensational! These are great. I've made them twice, and, like some others, the second time I left out the brown sugar and reduced the ketchup to 1/2 cup. I also added 1/2 t chili powder. The first time I made these, I had to keep them warm until my hubby got home from work, so I continually added beef broth while it simmered. OUTSTANDING!!! I am so glad I found this recipe. We pile the meat up on ours, so 1lb of beef ususally gives us 2 or 3 sandwiches (depending on how greedy everybody is at the time!). I really don't think this recipe NEEDS the brown sugar, but have some on hand because you may like it with it in there. I usually just serve these on buns, but another reviewer mentioned broiling them with cheese...HELLO! I'm gonna try that! I definitely prefer this over Manwich in a can with artificial everything, chemical preservatives, and Heaven knows what else! Thank you so much for sharing this!

I agree with others, I won't you the canned stuff again - and I even messed up the recipe!  I read it wrong and used tablespoons of brown sugar by mistake.  It was obviously too sweet, so I browned some more hamburger, and increased everything else some and added some vinegar, it was still a little on the sweet side, but still pretty good.  Next time with the right amount of sugar it should be perfect.  Since I had leftovers, I used it as a base for a thrown together spagetti sauce and it was excellant.  I will make this again.

This was okay, but really too dry for a 'classic' sloppy joe. I will try adding tomato sauce next time and will cut back on the brown suger to about half what it calls for since we all agreed it was too sweet.

A very good start. I  added 1/2 c ketchup plus 1/4 c bbq sauce which I think was a little strong so next time will add a tad less of the bbq. I cooked the peppers, onions and hamburger on the stove than put it all in the crockpot on low for the afternoon. Very easy, would be great for a group. And I liked the idea of freezing in muffin cups for single servings later.

Great recipe! A little thick for me - I added a can of tomato sauce, jar of spaghetti sauce, 3 Tbsp. chili powder and a little ground mustard. Turned out great! I also used a help with frozen diced green peppers and onions. Was very quick and I fixed this for 50 people at our church Wed. meal. Thanks!

This was really good. About half way through cooking, it seemed a little dry so I added one 8 oz can of tomato sauce. Turned out great!

Unfortunately, I tried adding water and even doubling the recipe to make it sloppy, and ended up using a packet of sloppy joe mix and a can of tomato paste. This sauce tastes more like meatloaf topping and really is closer to taco beef.

Wonderful!  I think I used a little more ground beef than the recipe called for because I had to use just a bit over a cup to get my mixture moist enough.  The combinations of spices and condiments really are tasty!  This is much better than canned sauce because you can play with the flavours yourself.  I am going to try using some of the mixture between bread in my sandwich maker for lunch tomorrow!

I followed the recipe exactly although I used ground turkey instead of beef.  Pretty good but not the best I've ever had.  I do think the sauce would have went better with beef.  But it still seemed to be missing something.  Next time I will add the vinegar and worchestshire (sp?)  per other reviewer suggestions.  
Also, I recommend covering the pan when you simmer, because it creates more liquid.  I simmered for about 15 minutes with the lid on, and another 5 with it off and there was plenty of sauce

Good, but not *Amazing* to merit 5*s.  I like that it's easy, uses ingredients usually on hand, but I wasn't overly impressed by the flavor.  A nice fallback for when I have groundbeef sitting around and don't feel like putting together anything elaborate.  I'll probably try to find a better recipe

Both my husband and I loved this recipe.  I followed another user's advice and added the green pepper and onion to the meat while it was browning.  I think next time I will use tomato sauce instead of ketchup though because the ketchup seemed a little salty.  Great, fast recipe that tastes better and fresher than the canned sloppy joe mix!

I gave this recipe 5 stars but i think any recipe would be an improvement over canned sloppy joe mix.  (Added my salt and pepper at the end of first step.  Also i needed a bit of water for the 30 min. simmer.)  Easy recipe to make and personalize with other ingredients.  Thank you Tamara.

I made this last night for a quick meal, and my husband LOVED it!  He's not normally a Sloppy Joe kind of guy, but he has raved about this and has asked that I make it again - always a good sign.  I added a splash of worcestershire and some red pepper flakes.  Double the recipe - it's great!

I added 2 TBSP of brown sugar, omitted the green pepper (hubby doesn't like them), and increased the garlic, and it's absolutely amazing!!  I had all the ingredients on hand, and since I've got about 7 lbs of hamburger in the freezer, I'll be making this one for awhile!  Wonderful!!

this was awesome. but i did make few alterations. instead of using ground beef i used packaged italian meatballs that come frozen. frozen italian meatballs are made seasoned already so all you have to do is heat them up and ground them. i used white sugar instead of brown and i added water like one reviewer suggested to reach my desired "sloppy" consistency. i also added no salt because the ketchup and frozen meatballs have salt in them already; adding more salt is unnecessary. i've never made sloppy joes before and it was so easy. it will definitely be a regular selection for dinner. thanx.

This was simple to prepare, and a very nice flavor.  I didn't change much, except to add a little water to make them a bit "sloppier".  I would definitely use this recipe again.

these were simple and good. i'm not a sloppy joe fan because it always came out of a can, but this is great. i put an extra tsp of brown sugar in it and added more garlic powder and then topped it with cheese and served, it was great. thanks for the recipe.

Good for sloppy joes.  I used a red vs. green pepper and added red pepper flakes for a kick.  A nice and tasty change from burgers.

I usually don't like sloppy joes at all...but this recipe I LOVED! I don't care for green peppers so I left them out and they were great!

I hadn't had sloppy joes in a long time - these were really good. :)  I omitted the peppers/onions because I don't like them.  Next time I will reduce the br. sugar (a little too sweet for us) and add some chili powder and worcestershire sauce.  Thanks for a new dinner recipe that's so easy!!

Wow, I couldn't believe a sloppy joe could be so good!  This was so simple and easy and had so much flavor.  The garlic powder and brown sugar create an amazing flavor.  I too will never buy manwich again.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

This recipe was very good. After I finished simmering the meat, I was skeptical about this meal being enough. Little did I know, it was enough to give each person 2 sloppy joes and everyone was full. It was tastey & also very easy to make. My 11 year old little sister helped me.

This was good. The adults liked it better than the kids.  Really minced the onion and green pepper, then made sure the beef didn't have lumps.  7/2011 made for after 1776 play for cast and neighbors and mom.

I enjoyed this recipe very much and only made a couple of minor changes - I added some garlic cloves instead of garlic powder and I ended up adding a small amount of tomato paste.  I had not had sloppy joes in years and thought that it needed a stronger "tomato taste", hence the tomato paste.  My husband absolutely loved them - I will definitely be making them again.  Thanks for such a terrific recipe!

This was a quick and easy meal on a Sunday afternoon. I added fresh garlic along with a few dried chilis.
This had a really great flavor and my husband and I will make this more often. 
Forget the canned stuff this is so much better!
Thanks for the recipe. It's a keeper.

This was good, but not "saucy" enough.  Also, unless you already have these ingredients on hand it's not any cheaper to make this vs buying a can of Manwich.  I'll make this again if I happen to have the ingredients, but won't go out and buy them to make this special.

Very good. A little sweet for my taste, but that may have been because I substituted onion salt for chopped onion because I was fresh out. All in all, very tasty and my kids were impressed that it was homemade.

I was skeptical at first....there is so much ketchup in it I couldn't imagine that it was going to taste good. Well, I was wrong- it was great!!  I used ground turkey and whole wheat buns.  My husband really liked it and so did my 8 year old.  This is going to have a permanent home in my recipe box!

I think this was really good, my only changes were to cut the brown sugar to 2 tblsp and add Hickory and Brown Sugar BBQ sauce.( Only like 2 tblsp) This made it taste more like sloppy joes to me.My husband liked them but would of preferred more sauce. I will make this again-Thanks for the recipe!

Good hearty fare.  I had no beef, so I substituted ground turkey, skipped green peppers, and added sweet chili sauce, some pork rub spice, half a can of tomato paste, and chili powder.

It was a too sweet for our taste. I would not put in the brown sugar and a lot less ketchup.

made this for dinner tonight and my husband told me he liked them better than manwich because they were not as messy.  They are easy to make.  I also added a little chili powder and worchestershire sauce.

Tried it with 1/2 cup ketchup since 3/4 cup sounded like too much for 1 lb. of ground beef.  Used ground sirloin(tastes great, very low fat, but expensive).  Also added 1 t. worcestershire sauce.  It was very good.  Thanx Tamara, Susie

Very tasty...
but I was a tad disappointed when my boyfriend said, "Mmm, nothing meets Hunts Manwich!" and I had to explain to him that this was NOT canned.

Yumm. It was very good. I added Worcestershire sauce to my meat while it was cooking because I like the taste of it. I used a clove of garlic, because all I had was garlic salt and I didn't want to make it too salty. At the end, I decided to add a few dollops of bbq sauce to add a smoked taste. 

Over all really good. I thought it was a tiny bit sweet. But that would be my fault. I had 1 1/2 lbs. of meat so I increased my ingredients. Next time I'll leave the sugar alone. Either way it was yummy and I'll use this recipe every time I make sloppy joes.

Very Good!  I didn't have any green peppers on hand so I added a few jarred jalapeno pepper rings and chopped them up(approx. a tspn)and added them to the pan which gave it a nice bite.  I also felt as though it was missing a little something at the very end so, I decided to add a tad more of ketchup and a teaspoon of pure 100% maple syrup.  That was the ticket!!!!  After that, it was soooooooo good!  I give this recipe 4 stars for what it tasted like before I added the maple syrup, but I'd give it 5 stars afterwards!!!!

The BEST recipe!  I triple it and make it in my BIG lift out crock pot.....(cooking the meat for 1 hour in it first and then adding rest of ingre.)  Leave in for up to 10 hours on LOW.  Meat is SOOO tender and flavors are just right!  YUMMY!!

Very good recipie!  I found it to sweet for my own taste.  My kids LOVED it though.  My usually recipie is much more savory.  I think next time I'll add less sugar and use tomato paste.  Otherwise really yummy!

I'm from Yorkshire in England and we don't have sloppy joes over here so making this recipe was my first experience of them.  I substituted half the ketchup for hot tomato salsa and served them over burger buns with grated cheese and sour cream - and they were gorgeous! I will definitely make them again.

It was okay. I had to add extra mustard b/c it tasted so much like ketchup. On that note, my 2 year old loved it.

These are great!  I skipped the onion, as hubby doesn't like it and didn't add salt.  I did add a bit of hot pepper sauce for kick.  My kids loved these as did I, and I am not usually a sloppy joe fan.  A keeper for us!

Excellent recipe!  I tried this after Hurricane Frances when me and some co-workers were making lunches and dinners for our water utilities line crew workers who were working around the clock.  They loved it and some got seconds with no bun!

I doubled the sauce recipe so I could put this in my crock pot.  It was perfect after about 3 hours on low.  Tasted just like I expected.  Nice and sweet!  Definitely will be my sloppy joe recipe from now on!

These were awesome!  My whole family, including my picky 4 and 2 year olds LOVED it!  Thanks for such an awesome recipe :)  I did add more ketchup and even some bbq sauce and just cooked it with browned ground turkey in the crock pot.  WAY better than Manwich!

Excellent!!  I added more onion and green pepper than called for (1/2 cup), and a bit more mustard for an extra kick.  I served this on texas toast.  I used to make sloppy joes w/ BBQ sauce instead of brown sugar.  I like this much better.  Thanks!

So easy and yummy!  A big hit with my picky husband and toddler.  I don't add green bell pepper but add just a bit more onion instead. We like it a little saucier so I add water as it cooks.  A great quick meal!  Tamara, Thanks for sharing.

Was a great recipe.  Added a bit more onion and green pepper.  Turned out fine.  My husband hates sloppy joes and now this  recipe can be declared a winner for my family.  Thanks for sharing.

This has a great taste to it!  It got excellent raves from the family and had a nice sweet bite to it, hence the brown sugar.
Thanks!!  Will make again.

This is the best Sloppy Joe recipe!  It's a regular in our home. :)

The only things I changed were that I didn't add the brown sugar and I added 2 tbsp vinegar and 1 tbsp of worcestshire sauce. Delicious!

My son LOVED these! He ate 3 in one sitting. I'm not a ketchup fan so I was a bit less enthusiastic. I always like to try a recipe as it's written the first time, and these are great if you ARE a ketchup fan, however I think I'll try adding Worcestershire the next time. I really liked that they weren't too sloppy ~ easier laundry day for me. :-) Thanks Tamara. These will be part of our regular rotation from now on.

This is such an easy recipe.  I made this one at work for cooking class with my clients...we all enjoyed it.   I cheated and added some extra seasoning, and a tad more sugar...was even better the next day.  This is keeper for me.

This was a terrific recipe!  I followed the advice from one of the other reviews and only added 1 tsp of brown sugar.  I also changed the ketchup to 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/4 cup Heinz 57.  My husband loved them!  Definitely a keeper!

I would not make these again.  First of all, they were way too garlicky even though I halved the amount of garlic powder.  I didn't think the sauce had enough flavor, so I kept adding things to try to improve it.  I added some Worcestershire sauce and even a little dry mustard to try to give it more kick.  Eventually they turned out okay, but I would look for a different recipe the next time I wanted Sloppy Joes.

Fast, easy, and delicious. I added some worcestershire as other reviewers recommended. This was my first attempt at homemade sloppy joes as I always used the can sauce. I will definitely be making these again, they are much better.

I love these. I have cravings for them all the time. I thought it was GREAT. I used other users suggestions, and used 1/4 cup of heinz 57, and i tsp brown sugar. My husband said they were missing something, and needed to be much "sloppier", which is why this only gets a 4. But I LOVED it.

This recipe is great. It has a nice filling and rich flavor, and tastes good with my favorite side dish, mashed potatoes. I decided not to use peppers, though it would taste good with them. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

This was our first experience with sloppy joes. I wanted to give this 3 stars and my husband wanted to give it 5 so I'm giving it a rating in between. I thought it was too sweet but I like that it uses ingredients that I usually have on hand.

Easy, fast and delicious.  I used ground turkey for a lower fat version, and one clove of garlic minced, instead of garlic powder.   The whole family loved it!

Well, im a college student, so im sitting at my computer eating these excellent sloppy joe's. Just wanted to say they are a tiny bit sweet for my taste, but still delicious. I used grey poupon and worstershire sauce. I think next tie id use less brown sugar, or something to tone down the ketchup a bit.

These were wonderful.  The only thing I changed was that I added 1/2 cup ketchup and 1/2 cup Sweet Baby Ray's Barbeque sauce.  My 2 year old loved them as well as my exrremely picky husband!

This recipe was well liked by all. I thought it was a little bit too sweet/tangy. But some may like it this way. Next time I will use half the sugar and a little less ketchup.

These were really good. I also doubled the recipe but next time I will leave out the onions since we aren't fond of them and I thought they over-powered the mixture. Still, better than a can of manwich!

I made these for lunch today along with the oven roasted potatoes from this site and my husband said "Wow!  These are the best sloppy joes you have ever made!"  And I totally agree with him.  Even my picky 5 year old who never likes anything ate her entire sandwich (a once a month feat) and asked for more. I did leave out the onions and peppers since my husband and daughter don't really like them and I didn't use any salt or pepper.  I also doubled the sauce and I'm glad I did since I think they would have been too dry if I hadn't.  They were great this way, and so easy to make too!

This was a great change of pace from the usual sloppy joes!  I used 1 c. of ketchup and added worsteshire and tobasco sauce and omitted the peppers (my husband won't eat them!).  They were delicious!

Easy, yummy comfort food.  Not haute cuisine by any stretch, but who looks for that in sloppy joes?  I serve this frequently when we have casual guests dropping in & there are never leftovers.

These are so much better than the sloppy joes you get from a can!  This recipe is very easy to make, fast to make, and tastes good.  I usually add a little splash of worcestershire to it.

I did what other reviewers recommended to cut down on the brown sugar to 1 tsp. I also omitted the green pepper (kids are picky). They gobbled it all down wanted more, I will double this recipe the next time. Thanks for sharing Tamara.

I have always been partial to Manwich even tho I think it's too spicy, so I tried this recipe and find it to be too sweet and not spicy enough...so the solution was to mix the two together with 2 lbs of beef and I think it's just great.

Good recipe.  It's a keeper!  I am glad I followed another reviewers suggestion to double the sauce.  It had the desired sloppy Joe consistency after simmering.

This recipe me reminds me of my 8th grade Home-Ec. cookbook.  It's down-home good stuff.  I made this for a Cub Scout potluck and the boys' gobbled it up.  However, I had to double the recipe but didn't have enough ground beef, so I substituted ground sausage.  I was also in a crunch for time so I made it about noon, and simmered it in the crock pot until serving time.  This one's a keeper!!!

DELICIOUS! My whole family loved them!  My husband raved about how much, much better these were than the store-bought, canned variety.  I sent the leftovers with him for lunch today...I'm wishing there were more for me!  I did add a little more ketchup, as I was afraid it would be too dry. Easy and excellent!

Pretty good, I made with ground turkey breast since we only eat red meat once in awhile.  It was quick and easy to put together which is a plus.

The 1st time I made this recipe before I went to work. I put it in my slow cooker-BIG mistake! The sauce was burnt and they tasted horrible because of it.  I tried it again and it turned out better.

This was wonderful and easy!  I made 1 1/2 batches because I figured it would be good to have leftovers.  The recipe said that it fed 6 people...well, it was just enough to feed 2 kids and myself.  They loved them!  This was my first time trying recipes from here and I wish I had read the reviews first.  However, I would have made the recipe as is the first time anyway but this is one suggestion I would recommend to anyone trying out a recipe for the first time--check out the reviews for hints and suggestions.  By the way, I did double the sauce and cut the brown sugar in half.

I left the green peppers out. My husband is a "selective" eater.  He loved them.  I will be making them again!

We just threw a huge 70's Disco Party for my mom's 40th Birthday and these were definitely the hit of the party! (Along with the Chocolate Bar Fondue recipe) Even people who hate sloppy joes loved them. Thanks for sharing.

With all the good ratings I had high hopes for this recipe.  Unfortunately my family just didn't go for it.  It had a "ketchup and mustard" taste.  Sorta bland.  We are used to sloppy joes that taste more "barbequey" (as in barbeque-sauce-like). Not for us I guess.

I made this recipe for a crowd and quaddroupled it. It was so good and went very fast. Took none home. I followed the the recipe to a T. My husband also thought it was the best and I have been making sloppy joes for 38 years.

My husband is not a hamburger fan but loves canned Manwiches.  Well he said this was a 100% better than the canned Manwiches.  I added a couple of shots of Worchestire sauce and added a bit of hot sauce to tame down the sweetness of the brown sugar.  It is a definite "do again" recipe.  I also doubled the recipe to make it saucy and to easily feed 4 with enough for one more leftover.

Simple,basic old fashioned Sloppy joe's. I cut down on the brown sugar and did not miss it at all.Very well received by everyone..from toddler to Great Grandma.Also added more ketchup and water so sauce did not evaporate while simmering.

I can't believe I wasted my money on the canned versions all this time!  This was just how I liked it...before I put the mustard in so added a tsp. of Worchestershire sauce to counteract the mustard.  Will make this all the time!

I had planned Sloppy Joes for supper only to realize the Manwich mix I thought was in the cupboard was not there -- whipped this sauce up with the beef I had already browned and it was great!!  Made it a few weeks later for an impromptu family gathering and got many compliments -- "What kind of sauce is this?" - "My own!" I proudly proclaimed -- THANKS for the recipe.  This is stuff I always have on hand I will not be buying Manwich anymore!!

I totally agree with the other reviewers that this was by far one of the best sloppy joe recipes I've ever tasted.  Thanks to the other comments, I had already planned to make only four servings, because there definitely wasn't enough for six people.

My husband and I both thought this tasted great.  My kids aren't keen on this kind of food so I really couldn't rate it on the kid friendly level.  I didn't have any green peppers to add but it still had plenty of flavor.  Delicious and fast!

This was very tasty!! If you are making this for 4 or more people, I would definately double the recipe.  This is most definately better than the store-bought sloppy joe mix.  I will be making this my permanent sloppy joe recipe!

I have never tasted a more delicious Sloppy Joe - and my husband agrees.  I added about a tablespoon and a half of sweet barbeque sauce (Montgomery Inn brand to be exact - Cincinnati favorite) to give it a little kick.  Perfect!

This is a great basic sloppy joe recipe that you can customize to suit your taste. I found it tasty just the way it is and I have made it with the addition of other ingredients that really enhanced it. So give it a try and don't be afraid to experiment with it.

Great recipe - our bell choir at church has used it twice for meals served at church and it was a huge success! We've served over 100 people each time and have had many compliments and no complaints.

I added my own special kick to this recipe by using the Light Brown Sugar, Sambal Oelek, half ketchup and half Heinz 57 sauce and Sweet-Hot Mustard.... I also sauteed the onions and peppers in olive oil first.. That sure kicks it up another notch!!!
Yummy!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Great recipe! I sauteed the onions and peppers in hot and spicy garic oil before adding the beef. Additionally, my secret incredient that I add to the sauce is spicy tamarind sauce. Adds additonal sweetness and a bit of a punch.

Excellent recipe! In the past I have always used the other "Name Brand" sloppy joe sauce, which I never really cared for anyway. Thumbs Up!

This was ok, I think my family liked it well enough. It could have used a dash of Worchester I think. Unfortunately we only had the green ketchup on hand so it looked unappealing but it tasted ok. It tasted a little to ketchup-y for me..

This is now our regular Sloppy Joe recipe, it's very good.  We like it better than canned Manwich.

The family and I enjoyed this a lot, especially my youngest daughter, who actually ate 1 1/2 of these.  We like this a lot better than the ones made with Hunt's or Manwich brand sloppy joe sauce.
