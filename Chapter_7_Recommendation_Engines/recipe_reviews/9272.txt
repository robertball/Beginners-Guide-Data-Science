I made this one for my husband who loves fruitcake. It was moist, buttery with a nice proportion of fruit to cake. It was a big hit!

This is definitely our kind of cake because we do like all the fruits.   This also keeps well (wrapped in foil) - can also drizzle some rum over the top after it is baked.   I did make one change and that was to subsitute corn syrup for honey (no honey lovers here) which works fine.  Highly recommend this little fruit cake.
