Instead of orange juice I used pineapple and added just a dash of ground cloves.  Everyone loved it.

I made it several times, once I ran out of orange marmalade, I used the lemon one, I had an awesome citrus glaze/sauce. Another version is the one in which I substitute Maille, with Maille grainy mustard. This sauce is such a success that I also use it with meatballs, chops and even with roasted cod. Sometimes I add orange zest, for scent and aesthetic purpose.
