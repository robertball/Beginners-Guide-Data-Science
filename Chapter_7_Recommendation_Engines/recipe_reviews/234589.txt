This is a keeper.  The dipping sauce has too much butter I used it to put over rice.

These came out of the deep fryer a lot different than I expected. They came out a real dark rich color and looked as if they had been coated is some type of thick sticky sauce even though I hadn't put anything on them yet. The tequila really came through and was the most potent but you could taste the other flavors as well. Now about the sauce. I am confused as to what you mean by Thai style chili sauce. When I see that I think of the pinkish sauce sold in the Asian food aisle but it barely has any heat at all so maybe you are referring to a Sriracha type sauce instead? I'm not sure but I think either would actually work fine on this recipe. These were good and turned out very pretty.
