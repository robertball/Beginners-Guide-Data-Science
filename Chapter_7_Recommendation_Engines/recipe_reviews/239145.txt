Five star all the way. Now getting ready to make this a third time. My wife is a pie baker supreme, but has been very busy with her business lately, and thus, if I want dessert, I have to do it. No, I'm not complaining. I love to cook, but would never do a pie, since that was her kingdom. Her being so busy, gave me an opportunity to make a pie and not hurt her feelings. This was my first venture into the world of pie making, and it was highly successful. She loved it!!! Thanks Chef John. This filling is fantastic. Attention all you DIVAS out there. Make this as is. Don't send a review in saying you used whole wheat flour to make it more healthy or used less sugar because it seem like too much from your vast experience. As Nilke says, "Just do it".

Loved the little kick of cayenne. Pie was not runny, just perfect. I made one to eat right away. I made the filling for two more pies, placing each in a foil lined pie pan. When the filling was frozen, I pulled them out of the pans and placed them in gallon-size ziploc bags and froze them for future pies.

I tried this recipe for the first time for my 4th of July dinner for 7 people. Like every Chef John recipe I've made it was fantastic.  Came out beautifully and every bit was scarfed down. It made 8 generous pieces. I refrigerated the 8th piece for the next day (it was even better). 

I used a 9.5 scalloped glass pie pan but followed the recipe exactly. What I really liked about it is that it wasn't loaded with cinnamon.  Over use of cinnamon makes everything taste the same-like cinnamon! I used 8 medium sized & very juicy peaches but it did not turn watery or ruin the crust.. 

It was my first lattice work pie.  I made my crust with the old standard Crisco recipe but I made 1 1/4 recipe because my pan was a tiny bit bigger and to allow for lattice boo boos. It was actually very easy to do thanks to the video.

Have one negative remark. The recipe said 30 minutes prep time.  It took me an hour+.  Baked to a perfect golden brown in 1 hours & 25 minutes.  I was surprised it didn't overbrown with the cream & sugar on it, but I watched it closely.

I started early to have plenty of cooling time so I was ok.  It was well worth the time and effort an I will definitely make it again.  

Thanks again Chef John for another winner!

This peach pie is the best that I have ever had and I am a professional home baker. I too, as Larissa on here, used the French Pie Pastry recipe and it was the perfect pairing. A family member brought back fresh peaches from South Carolina and they were delicious in this recipe. Thank you Chef John, as always you shared another superb recipe. P.S. I made the pie exactly as written- don't change a thing.

This is a keeper. It's now my go to for peach pie. Only thing I did different was to let the peaches & sugar set overnight because the peaches weren't really completely ripe. The next morning they were perfect to give me the syrup I needed. It came out perfect & everyone loved it!

Made exactly as written and it was delicious.  I made my pie crusts before I put the filling together and cut the second crust into strips for the lattice.  I really had trouble with the strips when I was putting the lattice together on top.  Finally, I decided to pop the cut strips into the freezer for about 15 minutes.  That sure helped!  I will definitely do that ahead of time next time I make this.

When paired with the Allrecipe.com's Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust Recipe, this peach pie is out of this world! Just a head's up, if your peaches are super ripe, as were mine, you'll still end up with the "wet pie sydrome". Yes, I strained for 5 minutes (15 actually). Yes, I did reduce juices to a syrup. And yes, the pie was still wet. Needless to say I highly recommend using just ripe peaches. Still, very delicious and definitely a keeper!

I used frozen peaches because peaches were out  season. I made the lattice crust for the first time ever. My pie did not bubble over at all. It was really beautiful.

I consider myself a pie snob. Tried this recipe and followed it exactly. It concerned me baking it at 350, rather low for a pie. It came out excellent. I enter competitions, so I 'm pretty judgmental when it comes to rating a pie.  My advice: MAKE IT !

My husband had a serious craving for peach pie and all we had on hand was canned peaches. This recipe was great with canned peaches and I cannot wait to make with with fresh ones! I skipped the syrup step and added some syrup from the can in its place.

Thank you Chef John for submitting this recipe. It was peach pie perfection, even with the rock hard peaches I had to work with. My only deviation was to add a splash of Triple Sec to the syrup. Highly recommended and will definitely make this again.

From one Chef to another, an absolutely perfect recipe and truly professional result! -My only change (since I didn't even have any cayenne pepper in the house, Oops! But i use mainly hot pepper sauces in savory cooking and spicy food not really my  thing anyway!), just added a small grind black pepper instead of the cayenne.

Also, doubled the recipe and used nine store bought pie crusts in 9 inch aluminum pie plates. Would be that much more labor intensive to make the pie dough as well, already quite a lot to prep and execute this pie, and when I bake, it's on my own personal time and I've never been a pie dough pro! And I like to share the resulting product with family, friends or neighbors! 
-Used around 4-5lbs (12 med-large Peaches) for the 2 pies. Cut back only slightly on the flour/sugar mixture as half of the peaches I had were not very ripe yet so I knew the extra sugar/flour would still be needed to compensate. 
That amount and final product was spot on and Delish! Quality, texture, taste and presentation gets this chefs approval! 
The two pie-loving widowers in my building will be so happy!! Thanks Chef John!

I made this for my sister & her husband when they came to visit for the weekend.  We LOVED it. Very simple to make also.  We'll be my go to pie.  I made it the second time and used frozen peaches worked just as well and made it even easier.

The flavor was very good.  I liked the little kick of the cayenne pepper.  It was a little runny when I cut it but I refrigerated over night and it wasn't runny anymore.  I only put in part of the reduced juices because I thought all of it might cause it to be too runny.  Due to the difference in how juicy your peaches might be, it might be better to have specified an amount of reduced juice to add.  I followed the cooking temperature and time stated in the recipe but in the future I might try what was suggested in other peach pie recipes I read - 450 degrees for 15 minutes and then 350 degrees for 30 minutes more.  My pie was pretty dark and crispy around the edges after an hour and 15 minutes at 350.

Best peach pie recipe I have ever made or eaten.  I have made 5 of these peach pies this week!  A dear friend of mine wanted a home made peach pie and I thought I would try a new recipe.  I was intrigued and nervous about the cayenne pepper but now, I can't imagine ever making a peach pie without it. Thank you for sharing!

I did not use the cayenne pepper, but used 2 heavy shakes of cinnamon. I didn't have whipping cream, so I used egg white instead. That worked fine - the pie was well received by my husband. I also used Pillsbury prepared crusts.

EXCELLENT!   This is the best peach pie I have ever made.  I used peaches that I froze last summer.  What a January treat!  I didn't have any cream to brush the crust so I added a little butter to my 2% milk.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  Chef John, you never let me down!

Ok. So this pie turned out to be really good, but it tasted like a boxed pie.... I guess the chef knows exactly what he's doing by making it taste and look like a perfect frozen pie.

Of course Chief Johns Recipes are the best.  I did make my own changes,  Nothing major, Used half brown sugar and half white, for a caramel flavor.

Oh my goodness - this is insanely delish and don't omit anything. My only suggestion is if you're using ripe peaches in season, they can be pretty sweet on their own so you might want to reduce the sugar a bit if you don't like overly sweet pie. Thanks for another super recipe Chef John!

Chef John is a genius. Adding cayenne to peaches takes it the extra mile. I wish I would have taken a pic but I was too busy eating it all. Thanks for the recipe.

We didn't care for the cayenne pepper in the filling. It took away from the flavor of the fresh peaches. I would make the filling again as stated, but would use my own flavorings.

I made this pie exactly as written.  I believe a key step is the draining and thickening the juice. I served it with ice cream at a dinner party.  All three of the women are good cooks and they wanted the recipe saying it was the best peach pie they had ever eaten. Definately a keeper.

This is an exceptional peach pie!  The peaches I used were gorgeous but very ripe. There was so much juice that I was nervous to make the syrup and add it, so I did not.
The pie was perfect. Juicy, but not runny.  I was very glad I skipped that step in this particular instance.

This is a flavorful pie.  I substituted 1/2 tsp nutmeg for the cayenne and increased the cinnamon to 3/4 tsp.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to the T and it made a soupy pie.  That’s why I gave it 4 stars.  Will increase the corn starch next time.

After reading a couple recipes, I adjusted the flour to 1/3 cup and mixed it with all the sugar and cornstarch and added it to my sliced peaches.  My peaches were very ripe and juicy. Baked for 35 minutes with the edges covered with foil liner, then removed foil and baked for another 20 minutes at 350. This pie turned out perfect.

Made this EXACTLY as written. Took it to a community picnic and got raves from several people. One specifically commented that the peachy tartness to sweetness was perfect. Reducing the juice is genius to avoid sogginess. At age 60, this was my first lattice crust ever, as well! It looked beautiful. I wish I’d taken a picture! This is my new go-to recipe for peach pie.

Good recipe overall. I skipped the  cayenne pepper and added nutmeg. (Sorry Chef John, lol) I wanted the pie to set up well so I used some tapioca starch in the filling as well. Set up quickly and sliced beautifully. 
Important notes: lattice is imperative to evaporate the liquid and you MUST cool completely. I make these the ‘day before’ (much to the chagrin if my dessert loving husband :D ) and they’re just perfect to slice and serve, cold or slightly warmed.
A dollop of crème fresh, whipped cream or even decadent french vanilla ice cream takes this into the heavenly category,

This was delicious!! I was hoping to make the recipe as written, but I had a whole bunch of peaches in the freezer from the summer. They ended up being so liquidy that I wasn't able to make syrup. I boiled it for over 20 minutes and it still didn't get syrupy. I did everything else according to the recipe and it still came out fantastic (even without the syrup!)

I've been dying to make a peach pie but after 3 fails I was unsure about this with the whole syrup step. But I was totally wrong the entire thing was a breeze!! Excellent tips in the video a must watch! Will definitely be making again.

This was my first attempt at a peach pie, it was fantastic! I was worried about having a soggy bottom because I usually blind bake the bottom crust of pies. The crust was perfect and crisp! I didn't have any cayenne pepper and I substituted lime for lemon juice, still turned out great!

I'm eating a slice at 10pm and it is delicious!  Chef John  has great recipes so I normally don't  mess with them but I did tweak this one slightly and here is my reasoning - decreased sugar to 3/4 cup because my Palisade (Colorado) Peaches are super sweet and I don't like anything extra sugary.   I also skipped the corn starch.  I don't like the gummy aftertaste so I never use it.  I didn't peel the peaches because it's a waste of time and the peel isn't noticeable at all. I used a premade crust that is made without any corn syrup, added flavorings, etc. from a brand called Wholly Wholesome.  Tasty but not too thick so it doesn't overwhelm the peachy flavor.  My pie was so good and has great peach flavor.  It's not runny at 
 all and slices so well.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe. Followed it exactly, except I used store bought Pillsbury piecrust. The pinch of cayenne enhanced the flavor and gave the pie a little kick! Perfect texture.The trick of soaking the peaches and then making the syrup worked great. Juicy, not runny and not gluey. Perfect!

My wife and I both thought hard about this and there was truly nothing we wanted to change about this recipe.  The pie was just perfect.  We made no changes to the recipe.  Don't let the cayenne pepper scare you.  If you truly use a pinch, there is not enough cayenne (or cinnamon) that you can easily identify it as an individual flavor.  The combination of everything was wonderful.

Me and my mom made this pie for a pool party, and everyone loved it. We had a bit of extra peach, so we made a little mini tart. All the juice spilled out in the oven, but it was great anyway. I recommend using that peach syrup for pancakes or waffles, or just by itself. I will make this next peach season for sure!

I found peaches that were over a half pound each and just couldn’t resist using this recipe. Refrigerator store bought pie crust is just fine. I prefer baking in my own glass pie pan. I gave this a heavy tablespoon of corn starch and also brought my syrup to about 220F. No one likes watery pie. Coated the top in lattice, then brushed on some coffee creamer and sprinkled in raw sugar. Excellent simple recipe.

Absolutely amazing peach pie. I left out the cayenne pepper due to an allergy and it was still amazing! I used a pie crust recipe from all recipes as well. It’s my no fail crust recipe and the two combined were phenomenal.

I loved this pie and so did everybody else.  I added crushed pistachios into the crust and in the center, but left the rest of the recipe unchanged.  Used fresh peaches which makes a huge difference in my opinion, but frozen might work as well.  I will be making this “peachstachio” pie again without a doubt.

My first ever peach pie!  Only changes I made were 1) Didn't do the lattice, but cut out a design on the upper crust which allowed to breathe properly 2) Brushed the upper crust with egg white instead of the cream.  Was not overly sweet,  just right and everyone who had it wished they had another slice. Will definitely make again!

Made this for the first time today and boy did I get rave reviews! This is the best peach pie I’ve ever made, thank you! I did skip the cayenne though because I’m a chicken but followed everything else to a tee.

This is very easy to prepare especially when I cheated with store bought dough due to a time crunch.  When my peaches go ripe in a day due to a heat wave this is a perfect go to before they hit the garbage with bruises.

You don't taste the pepper but it sure enhances the lovely peach flavor with richness.  Its not too sweet and the taste of the peach is the star.  A big hit in my house will make again for sure.  I didn't have to cook it a hour so keep a eye on it.

I never tell folk it has cayenne unless they admit to loving it first. I feel that the cayenneI in just the right amount is that "secret ingredient" little something something!

 I have made the filling portion of this recipe for two peach seasons now and it is my absolute favorite peach pie anywhere. You could say that my using only the filling changes it, but let's face it we all have our favorite crusts. I'm typically a lard butter girl (lardbutt LOL!) but I pair this with a 16 T butter 4 T Horizon brand solid vegetable shortening crust. (the little bit of shortening for tenderness)

I follow the filling to a T, experimenting with how generous I want the pinch of cayenne to be from a scaredy cat pinch to a happy generous one. 

This last time I forgot the butter pats on the filled pie and it was still fantastic. Depending on the peaches I have had variations of baking time but for me, in my oven, I've needed to go longer on the pie bake time. This year I had to keep shoving it back in for a good 30 more mins, putting foil on edges as needed. I follow the part where he says Bake until bubbling!!! (I also look for their it not to look watery or clear peach juice wise but make sure to balance that with crust perfection. This years peaches were the wettest yet but the taste was still fantastic and the pie did thicken more overnight. I keep fruit pies on counter for a day plus and in the rare event more is left, I then move to fridge by end of 2nd day. 

This is a keeper, I can

Yum. Will make again - used einkorn all purpose flour and kept dough chilled while assembling.  Thanks to all who mentioned frozen peaches - I did not have a source for fresh Freestone so went with frozen with encouragement from earlier reviewers.  Thawed in the bag (somewhat) then treated like fresh.  Great flavor and not soupy, runny, gooey, or soggy - Thank you, Chef John!  PS - A+ Video :-)

Oh my goodness!  Total deliciousness. The first pie didn’t make it 20 minutes so hopefully this one we will allow to cool first. Don’t change anything. I used a pillsbury refrigerator crust and turned out fabulous. Thanks Chef John for this pie recipe.

Excellent recipe but did make a couple of changes.  I used peaches that I had frozen before and baked the pie on the lowest rack in the oven to also help prevent a soggy bottom crust.

This is the best peach pie ever!!!  Delicious!!!!  I have made it 5 times without fail.  My four year old grandson requested, out of the blue, that NiNi make it for his birthday.  I love the tiny pinch of cayenne and the pinch of cinnamon.  They compliment one another and keep quests guessing about the ingredients.  Hint: boil peaches for one minute then put them in ice water......peels easily with your hands (10 sec).

Absolutely perfect, especially with some French Vanilla ice cream.  Way better than a birthday cake :)  The peaches stayed firm and didn't turn to mush, and the sauce was not runny.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

Made it and loved it, next time I make it though I am going to use a more juicy peach and something a bit more tart than the ones I used though. I rarely eat desserts I make except a small piece, with this I ate most of it over several days. If you want a peach pie try this one.

I did exactly as the recipe. No changes on anything. It turned out great. My husband loved it! He said it was the best pie he’d ever had and he is a picky “foodie”. I will be making it again.

It was very good. I think cooking the juice down really worked. I didn't add the pinch of cayenne, but will try it next time.

I am not normally a pie maker & this was my first weaved pie crust! Loved I! Perfect pie for the dinner party. Used Chef John’s pie crust recipe for the food processor also. Will make this again!

This pie was absolutely amazing!!! I made it exactly as the instructions said, but I used my own crust recipe and lime juice instead of lemon it called for. Everyone raved about how good it looked and most of all the yumminess! The added pepper was an EXCELLENT touch and did draw attention to the peaches rather than to the cinnamon. Thank you for sharing!!! Definitely my go to recipe for pies from now on!

This is the very first peach pie I have ever attempted and it was absolutely delicious! The next time I will boil the peach and sugar juices  longer because the pie was still a bit “loose”. It didn’t come out in a beautiful slice but rather sloppy. That was MY mistake! I also used a refrigerated pie dough product but will use my own dough recipe next time. The lattice crust was quite easy thanks to Chef John’s video!

The only difference with my recipe was that I used frozen peaches (home frozen). I had a lot more liquid but when I reduced it as instructed I had more syrup but it did not affect the consistency. As usually Chef John is perfection!!! The photo will show that I am not the best on crust but it was great! (I did use the wrong size - shoulda gone with the 9")

Don't skimp on this one. Follow every step; take no shortcuts. This pie lets the peaches take the spotlight. Not cloyingly sweet, just perfect. I used a combination of pure lard and butter for the crust, which provided a beautiful canvas for this summer masterpiece, courtesy of Chef John.

This is the best peach pie ever...and the boiling down of the juices really lets it firm up. It's always better the second day and is so good, I think ice cream spoils it! I used Epicurious' "Best Pie Crust" which uses 1/2 cup lard and 1/2 cup unsalted butter.

With great respect for Chef John, I figured he knew what he was doing. So I made this peach pie exactly as written and it had to be the best!   I was curious about the cayenne pepper, but it was a small amount so I went with it.  Just wish that there was something more specific than 'pinch' to measure.  But it worked.  Thanks.

This pie was super delicious. It is a bit time consuming but definitely worth it. I used local farm grown peaches and they were already quite sweet, I cut the sugar down by 1/4 cup but I think I could have done even more. This pie wasn't overly soupy whatsoever it was perfect. I would definitely make this again, thanks Chef John!

This pie was delicious! I have a favorite pie crust so didn’t use the one in the recipe but did the filling exactly. It was the perfect texture and was very flavorful. I’ve already made two more for friends!

Made it exactly as directed with two exceptions.  I cut out the unsalted butter but substituted it with salted butter. I and skipped the salt in recipe. As always, I steal all of Chef John's recipes.

This pie is outstanding!  I made it 3 times last peach season.   Everyone who tried it, LOVED it..! We just picked up a bushel of peaches from a local orchard, and I am about to make this pie again.  Wondering if anyone knows - can I make & freeze the filling?  Or would it be better to cook and freeze the finished pies?  I want to have this awesome pie on hand over the holidays.  Feed back is welcome!! :)

Such a good recipe. a few extra steps, but they are worth it. Draining the peaches and making a syrup to add back in makes for a never soggy pie. Really good ! I've made this twice now, great both times

First Peach pie I ever made and it came out perfect. It tasted great and was even better after a day in the fridge. I went back to the store to get more peaches before the sale ended.

Unfortunately I could only get fresh clingstone white peaches but it was very tasty regardless! It would have been more colorful with the freestone however everyone raved about it. I'll definitely make it again!

It wasn't easy for this rookie, but it turned out very tasty. Made it exactly as listed, but next time will add a little more sugar. Thanks, John. You're the man!

This pie was terrific.  I kept what was left in the refrigerator and even that didn’t get runny. I did use a little more cinnamon than called for, skipped the butter on top because I forgot. and I made a regular crust for the top.  This is a keeper recipe and I’m going to try this technique for other fruit pies!

I cut the recipe in half (as I had exactly 1-1/2 pounds of peaches on hand), and used a 9" tart pan. Baked for 45 minutes, and it turned out perfect! Beautiful and delicious! Served this with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream. Yum! Thanks Chef John!

This was outstanding! I am not an experienced pie baker, in fact, I don't  even like pie all that much. I love Chef John and his videos though, and after I watched this, I couldn't resist trying it. I bought peaches and let them ripen for a few days on the counter. They felt soft and perfect today when I went to prepare the pie. But when I cut them, every single one was mealy! I was so disappointed! Can you make pie with mealy peaches? I decided to try it, and I'm so glad I did! I followed the recipe EXACTLY. I have had problems before with watery fruit pies, but not his time. This pie was perfect. My whole family raved about it. Even my husband said, "I don't even like peaches, but I love this pie!" I can't wait to make this again!

I used a French pastry crust for this peach pie and it was too hard to work with to make a lattice top. I tasted the filling and it was divine. It smells delish, but I just took it out of the oven so it’s too hot to eat. But it is a very pretty pie. I baked for an hr and 10 min. I used orange juice instead of lemon juice, that’s what I had on hand. I had two “uh ohs”,  I forgot to dot with butter and sprinkle sugar on the top. Also I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup.

Making the juices into a syrup helped keep it from being runny!  I was short a few peaches, so I added strawberries that I had on hand and kept everything the same.  Am making it again today.

Cooking dabbler here. Wanted to recreate a peach pie our fraternity cook, Wilma, made from time to time. She used red hots (cinnamon imperials) in the filling. I used Costco jar peaches and store pie crust. Followed the recipe but halved the sugar and skipped making syrup. Looked and tasted great. Even the picky grandkids ate it happily. Chef John always makes me look good.

This was my first attempt at baking a pie and it turned out fabulous.  I made exactly as directed and it was delicious.  It took some time to prepare but was worth the effort.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, I will definitely make again.

I did not add the cayenne pepper due to a strong dislike for that ingredient by a family member.  However I followed the rest of the ingredients and the recipe and it turned out great.  It is the best peach pie I ever made.  It was not runny and tasted fantastic.  Thanks Chef John!

I did not make any changes. This is the first time I made a lattice crust, the instructional video was excellent. I only stopped it 3 times and reviewed  to get it right. Chef John gave great advice to drain the peach juice and reduce it by cooking. The flavors were wonderful and the pie did not bake over. This is my "go to" peach pie recipe. Thank you Chef John!

I made the peach pie last year and believe I wrote a review and said I would freeeze the filling and see how that turned out.  It was delicious.  I still have another in the freezer and will make that for our Thanksgiving Dinner, first Monday in October.  I made the pies again this year.  They are delicious and I get lots of compliments.  Probably my homemade pastry has something to do with it also!!

This is really good.  I made it twice exactly as written and it is very good tasting.  I am thankful for the good instructions on prepping the peaches, because I have made peach pie in the past by trying to prep them just like I do apples.  They do not cook the same way.  I also made this without the cinnamon and cayenne, and was also good.  The type of peaches do make a big difference too.  If you go picking, the ones that are good for fresh eating are not always also good cooked.  This summer I picked a variety called Red Haven and they were really good in this recipe.  Most recently I made this in muffin tins instead of one big pie.  Good for sharing.

I made no changes although I was a bit hesitant about the cayenne. It was perfect!  A pinch to some is not a pinch to others. I held back a little. Additionally, I did NOT mention the addition of cayenne.  Will I make it again? Absolutely! Will I follow this recipe?  Absolutely!

This is the perfect peach pie, and although it's my policy to never follow a recipe exactly, I went with the many reviews and followed it to a tee. The result was PEACH PERFECTION...my
Mom who's the best pie baker EVER and who isn't eating much sugar right now actually asked if she could keep the last slice of pie for herself when our picnic ended! Haha....! Thats all I need to know; Mom approves so this is a keeper recipe forever.

Exceptional pie! I made my own pie crust, but followed directions exactly for the filling and construction. It was really good and I will make it again and again. Thank you Chef John!

It was my first try at making a pie, dough and all. It was perfect and so easy to do. The cayenne pinch add a little pizzaz and all my friends now want more pie. Oh my!

This recipe was perfect. Just the right consistency when warmed , not runny.  I just did double crust no lattice. I plan to try apple using the same drain and boil the juice to add back method..

Loved this peach pie filling.  Chef John always comes through with a great recipe.  I loved the video and made a beautiful lattice crust for my two pies.  Thank you for a great recipe.
I didn't change a thing, it's perfect!

I put a crumb crust on the pie, my husband loved it.  Next time I'll use a deeper dish pie plate as I had some run-over, or I'll just use less peaches.  I started with more than called for in the recipe.

I just made this yesterday and it was delicious. I have been making pies for years and I always had trouble with my peach pie being too juicy and the crust getting soggy. This was great and the filling thickened up wonderfully. I followed the recipe exactly and would not change a thing. This is the first time I made a lattice top, I always thought it was too hard but following the video made it so easy, I will definitely do it again. This one's a keeper!

I didn't make any changes.   I just cheated on the pie crust and bought some didn't have time to make the pie crust.  The pie was just simply delicious and I will definitely make it again and maybe this time I'll do the pie crust.  Family enjoyed every bite, of course they had vanilla ice cream.

I ended up making one change which was accidental. I didn't have enough peaches.  To make up the difference I added mangos. Everyone loved it. It didn't change the taste because the peach nectar  was strong.

Any time you see a 5 star chef John recipe, it is worth making! It turned out superbly!  It was fun to make, and an extra set of hands to help with the lattice top is, well, necessary in my case.  "Over? No, that one goes under!"  Boiling the syrup worked great.  You do not notice the pinch of cayenne, although you might notice it's absence if you omit it.  I only wish I had aluminum foil shielded the edge of the crust sooner, as it got a little to dark, but still delicious and beautiful pie!

Perfect  amount of sweetness. It wasn't runny even though I didn't reduce the juice all the way down to syrup (I added a splash of peach bourbon which wouldn't boil down completely). I didn't brush anything on top (didn't want the extra calories from the heavy cream) and found it wasn't needed anyway. I found the video to be useful - I followed his tips and it was the first time I made lattice that looked right.

My first attempt at a peach pie was many years ago. It was a complete disaster.   Peach soup is what it looked like, which is why I couldn't bring myself to try a bite of it. When I saw Chef John's recipe, I decided to try one more time.  I followed the directions exactly, and it turned out perfect.  Everyone loved it including myself.  Yes, I will make this again.  It was worth the effort.  For the record, I watched it three times. :)

I'm rating this 5 stars for flavor.  I actually made a peach cobbler and used the spice combo here,  the tiny pinch of cinnamon and cayenne pepper.  Wow!  I loved it!  Like you said, Chef John, you can't really detect the spice flavor..but there is a little hint of heat on the palate after you have a bite.  Outstanding!  Will use this spice combo again with peaches.  Thanks!

Pie turned out great. I used peaches that had dropped from  the tree. They tasted great in the pie even though they were not ripe and still hard. The only complaint I received from the guests at the picnic was there was not enough for everyone to get a slice.

Went exactly by the directions omitted the cayenne pepper. (don't like it) added a extra pinch of cinnamon. It was fantastic. Never would have thought to make the syrup. I had always had the trouble with watery pies but not this time.

This was a great pie, but I honestly didn't care for the hint of cayenne in it. I thought it made it taste like the peaches were cut on a dirty cutting board. Everything else about the pie was perfect though!

Very good recipe.  Left out cayenne since I didn't have any.  Used refrigerated pillsbury pie dough and added sugar in the raw on top of dough instead of white sugar.

I admit after reading the reviews, I played it safe and omitted the cayenne pepper. I make fresh peach pie only once or twice a year and didn’t want to regret using the pepper. Other than that, I followed this recipe to the letter and I love it. 
I think bringing the peach juices to a boil is what completes this recipe and makes it probably the best I have ever made and the best I have ever eaten. No runny-pie syndrome describes it perfectly. 
I am making a second pie today because the first one lasted maybe 24 hour. Try it, you will not be sorry!

Loved it ! I had an abundance of fresh ripe peaches and decided to give this recipe a try. I omitted the cayenne pepper but followed everything else exactly as written. I loved the fact that the filling wasn't too runny and it was not too sweet either. It was just right. I will definitely make this again. I think next time I will add a dash of nutmeg. This recipe is a keeper.

I didn't have cayenne but it was still amazing. The filling wasn't too funny and tasted awesome! The whipping cream and sugar really made the crust flaky (I used pre made pie crust). Definitely a keeper

This was a fantastic recipe and everyone loved it. I used lemon essential oil (1 drop) instead of the lemon juice and since I made this the night before I let it sit in the fridge over night and baked next day. Turns out the flavors came together even better! The essential oil made it more lemony then I'm sure the original recipe is;  however if you like lemon this is a real treat in combo with the peach!

This is a wonderful recipe. I cut back the sugar to about 3/4 of a cup because I prefer pies to be less sweet. I also cut out the cayenne but I added about 1/3 cup of peach schnapps to the syrup. 
Perfect consistency, not too watery. Tastes amazing. Definitely making this again next peach season. I love the technique of boiling down the juices to make a syrup, I'll use that in other recipes as well.

Omitted the cayenne pepper as I didn't have any; forgot to add the butter...didn't matter as this pie is peach heaven! Do NOT skip the step where you boil the juice into a syrup, that is key to the filling gelling together. If you follow the instructions, you will end up with a gorgeous pie that does NOT fall flat when you cut into it. I am now making more Chef John recipes because this one was phenomenal!

Wonderful recipe. It really helped to thicken up the juices from the peaches.   Only four stars because it is a bit more labor intensive.  I'm quite sure we will do this again.

Hands down best peach pie recipe ever! Reducing the sugar and juices into a syrup is genius! I paired this with my Great Aunt Junes pie crust and it was to die for! Warning! Do not use frozen peaches! You must only use fresh ripe peaches.

Best peach pie we've ever had. Period. The depth of flavor was subtle yet undeniable- cayenne and cinnamon married well with the peach syrup reduction. A new favorite!

My husband is a fruit pie fanatic. Thanks to the flour, corn starch, and the process of boiling the syrup to thicken, this pie stood firm and tall! I used a homemade crust and my pie was an absolute success. This recipe will go into my pie collection.

In most ways this was a fantastic pie, but I'm not a fan of the cayenne. Next time I'm going back to a tough of almond extract and maybe nutmeg.

Best peach pie ever and it was my first! The only thing I will do different next is sprinkle more turbine sugar after I brush it with the sugar and cream mixture:) Thanks for another great recipe.  My "No fail pie crust" from this site was the perfect compliment.

Delicious! Will definitely make again. I was a little lazy and didn't peel the peaches or lattice the top. I do not have much experience making pies so I just added the top crust. The cream and sugar brushed on the top crust was AMAZING!

I could only find regular Southern Yellow Peaches. Yes, prepping them wasn't easy. I had to drop them in boiling water and peel them. Make 4 cuts before freeing the stone and they weren't easy to chop. But they were DELICIOUS!! The peaches were juicy and flavorful! I used Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust recipe from AllRecipes.com as well. Turned out great!

This was the first time I attempted peach pie. It turned out great. I followed the recipe exactly.

So delish, even without the cinnamon, cayenne, and lemon juice (my husband is allergic to them all).  We loved how great this pie tasted and the lattice top made it very attractive too!  I can't wait to make it again!

I read several reviews to make sure this came out well, but it was very soupy. I followed the directions, so I'm not sure what happened.

It was an OK recipe, but it is nothing exceptional. I'll be looking for a different recipe.

Followed the instructions to the letter. Came out perfectly, and I am in no way a pie fan, but this was delicious!

I didn't make any changes and I would definitely make it again and it is the best recipe for peach pie I have ever had and I have shared it with my friends on Facebook.

Best peach pie ever. I didn't have a lemon so I substituted lime juice, which works just fine. Chef John rocks!

This pie is so delicious!  Mine turned out just a little runny, either because I didn't cook down the sauce enough or because the peaches were just juicier.  I followed the directions which are right on the mark otherwise!  Yummy, Chef John!  Thanks!

The peach sauce reduction really made all the difference. I added a shot of peach schnapps. Better than any restaurant pie. Will make again, soon!

Spectacular success.  Used the butter flakey Pie Crust recipe by Dana, on this site, and doubled it to make the crust and a lattice top.  Pie gone in one day among 3 people.  Had to make another one the following weekend by popular demand.  Perfect!

This peach pie was AMAZING!! It took all afternoon but it was worth it. We used the French Pastry Pie Crust Recipe and added a little extra cayenne pepper. So delicious! -Alayna and Larissa

Wow...I was worried because I used a different peach and they were not ripe. It is February in New Jersey, peaches are just not in season. The pie came out picture perfect and tasted amazing!! The pie was gobbled up immediately. I can only imagine that in the spring and summer that this recipe will even be more incredible with better peaches available! Thanks John, you inspired me to make this!!

Beautiful, delicious pie!!  I highly recommend this recipe! I followed it exactly as it says except omitted the cayenne pepper, because I didn't have any. But I really don't think it was needed. Will definitely make this again and again!
