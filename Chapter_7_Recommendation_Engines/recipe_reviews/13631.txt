Absolutely yummy! I added a bit of fresh nutmeg to mine. This is basically a crustless onion quiche, and it is SO flavorful!  Be sure to drain all of the butter/oil off of the cooked onions before adding them to the cream mixture. Sprinkle sweet paprika and dried parsley over the top for lovely color.

A great side dish!  A unanimous Easter dinner hit!  No leftovers and the recipe went home with two happy families. I think next time I just might try decreasing the amount of butter by 1-2 tablespoons. (Howevewr, I can always go back to the original recipe if that is not satisfactory.)

I made this as a side dish for Passover dinner and it was delicious.  The only adjustment was I used fat free half and half instead of cream to cut down on calories.

Made this last night and was pleasantly surprised!  Tasted really good.  I think I could've sliced more than 4 cups worth, though.  I'm glad I used a 1 1/2 qt instead of a 2 qt casserole dish.  I should have probably used a 1 qt dish. Be sure to use the 2/3 cup Parmesan.  It gives a nice crunch.

Used FF half-n-half, added a squirt of dijon and a little Frank's Hot Sauce. YUM. This would make an excellent starter for macaroni and cheese or thickened up, a good dip.

I can't get over how delicious this easy-to-prepare onion dish was.  Make it per the instructions, and double the recipe, because it will *all* get eaten.

I made this to accompany a nice filet mignon. Made it as specified but added about a 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper. Not necessarily something I would serve in large quatities as a side but a very nice to accompaniment to any steak.

such a great recipe, definitely no need for all that butter though, melting enough to coat the pan before saut√©ing onions is PLENTY, I like to keep the onions a little bit undercooked before putting them into the oven where they finish up and have the best texture.  definitely a staple dish prepared at all holidays in my family and whenever we roast chicken. sooo good and simple

I made this to take to a church potluck, I added some garlic powder and celery salt to the heavy whipping cream mixture. I got rave reviews from everybody there, but it just still seemed like something was missing and was a little too oniony... I will probably make it again but experiment more with it.

These were so good!! Better than I expected.  Made them for my family and then reheated them the next night in the oven for some guests.  They were great then too!!  One guest said he doesn't even like onions and he had 3 plates full!  Great & Easy recipe!!

We are members of a local food co-op and while it is wonderful we sometimes get an excess of certain produce that we can't use quickly enough. Onions this time. I made this for my husband and we both loved it!!!! It will probably be a side for Holiday gatherings. It could also be a great dip if the onions are cut small enough. (1 side note, this recipe caused a lot of gas)

I've made this recipe twice and each time was a great hit.  I followed the recipe to a "T" but added  2 more onions to it.  The only thing I found that it isn't a good leftover addition to the next days meal.  It just doesn't have the same flavour.  This recipe is a huge keeper but will not keep leftovers.

Good recipe.  I didn't have heavy cream, so I used half and half, and it turned out just fine.  I think I should have added parsley or something to it to make it look a little more festive and not so bland, but overall it was very good.

Delicious. I made this dish three times now for different guests and it always gets very good feedbacks. I use the recipe per instructions, doubled the onions, though, since there is not much left of the onions after cooking them tender. Im wondering if it shouldn't say "4 sliced onions" instead of "4 cups sliced onions"?
Use leftovers the next day to top pork chops - a treat!
Thanks for this great and easy recipe, Christine!

I used more onions that it called for with the same amount of sauce and it was plenty moist.  May have been soupy with just the recipe amount.  
Served it Thanksgiving and didn't have leftovers!

I only changed the amount of butter as I had the onions cooking with olive oil when I found the recipe.  I added a tablespoon of butter to the pan of onions, and proceeded with the recipe as written.  I really like it, and will make it again.

Truly delicious, and so simple too! That's a winner in my book. This dish could be a side to so many meals, or even as a topping on a jacket potato like I had last night. So versatile. It's a keeper, thanks!

Made as a special treat for the family. I accidentally subbed Romano for the Parmesan (didn't pay enough attention at the grocery) and it was still delicious. Will definitely be making again - thanks do much for sharing!

I followed the receipt except I used Cheddar/Colby Jack cheese because that what I had and sprinkled some Panko bread crumbs on top. It turned out very good!

These were soooo good. I will make again. I made this recipe as directed and it tasted great. I don't think I would add anything more to it. New favorite side dish.

I thought my brother-in-law was going to scrape the finish off my casserole dish trying to get all the leftovers out.  Made exactly as the recipes states and was a huge hit.  Brother-in-law wants 2 made for Thanksgiving!!!

I like that it didn't taste so egg-y. I actually ran out of parmesan cheese and had to use mozzarella instead and it turned out great!

This was good. I think, to add a little flavor and color, I will add a small jar of pimientos next time.
