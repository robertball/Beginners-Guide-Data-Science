I made this for hubby's lunch & he LOVED it!! I subbed 2 things based on what I had-I used red onion in place of the green onion & bleu cheese in place of the feta. Served it in a wrap w/lettuce & tomato. The guys at work were jealous ;)

I am usually not a chicken salad fan, but this was great.  I like the spice.  I made chicken salad wraps with avocado.  The avocado is a great compliment to the spice.

This was pretty good.  At first it seemed kind of soggy with the amount of mayo and sour cream and the texture was not quite what I wanted it to be.  So I added some chopped green bell peppers and some chopped onion to give it more of a crunch.  That really added a LOT more flavor and it was perfect!  Next time I will definitely reduce the mayo and sour cream to suit my family's preference. It tastes great after chilling in the fridge overnight and is awesome served with crackers.

Very good!  I love the southwest sauce at subway and this recipe is a lot like that. Itâ€™s a nice change from the normal chicken salad.  The only thing might add next time is a little fresh lime juice and cilantro.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a great idea for jazzing up plain old chicken salad! For my own taste, I added WAY less mayo and sour cream, and used a shredded pepper cheese instead.  You really could change this around a hundred ways and it would be great.  Thank you for the recipe.

Instead of using mayo, I made a honey mustard dressing.  It made the salad sweet and spicy- delicious.  Only thing I would do different next time is grill chicken breasts myself instead of buying pre-cooked chicken cubes.

This was delicious!  I dislike most chicken salads because they call for ingredients that I don't like (celery, raw onions, etc.) but this one fit the bill for my picky preferences.  I changed the mayo/sour cream ratio to 1/2 cup each because I love sour cream, and I used minced shallots instead of green onions for their milder onion flavor, and since I didn't have garlic salt I used garlic paste (about two tablespoons for the whole recipe) and added regular table salt and pepper to taste.  I also served it on wheat with thinly sliced cucumber and shredded lettuce... it provided a crunchy, cool contrast to the spicy, creamy chicken that complimented it perfectly.  I shared it with my mom and her coworker who both loved it.  I had to print out copies of the recipe for them!  This would be great for a picnic or potluck lunch.  I'll be making it again for sure!

The dressing is very good! To cut the fat a little, we only used a 1/2 cup mayo. My husband accidentally put in a whole (small) can of chipotle peppers in, and it was HOT. Sour cream helped dilute. And viola, you have a really good DIP, not just a dressing!

I cooked up some chicken tenders with some salt and pepper, and ended up with a little less than the 2.5 cups needed, so I used 2 chipotle peppers instead of 3 and I'm glad I did. We like it spicy, and that amount was just right for us. I didn't have green onion on hand so I used some regular white onion and it added a wonderful crunch! I eyeballed the mayo, adding just enough to make the salad moist. I despise typical chicken salads, but this new spin on chicken salad is amazing! I added about 1-2 tbsp fresh chopped cilantro and 1/4-1/2 tsp of lime juice. Perfect! Thanks for the yummy recipe!

A nice change from typical chicken salad, I did put in some celery instead of green onions due for personal  preference.  I also only used 2 chipotle peppers, three might have been too hot for us.  Thanks for sharing!

Since many reviews mentioned 1 cup was too much mayonnaise I just eye-balled the amount until it reached the consistency I like for chicken salad, which was  a tad more than half cup. I did add some chopped celery along with the green onions for a bit more crunch. Watch the amount of peppers, I just used two and it was pretty spicy, if I had three might have been too spicy..and I like spice hot. I made sandwich wraps with large flour tortillas and a leaf of lettuce, a very nice change from regular chicken salad.

WOW This is soo good. I used it as a filling for a sandwich and a dip with crackers, good both ways. I will make this again!! I actually misread the recipe and didn't add the mayo, I was wondering why after 3 tbls of sour cream it was still very dry, so I just added more sour cream.

this is terrific! I have a rotisserie cooker, so I was able to use chicken breast roasted on the bone. (It made a BIG difference, the chicken was super moist and flavorful) I added green peppers to give it some more flavor and crunch and would recommended doing so.
I wrapped it up with red onion and tomatoes in a sun-dried tomato and basil wrap, and served lunch to a few very satisfied people.  I also sent this to work with my husband, and his coworkers were very envious :)
I will make this again, and again, and again!

This is a great alternative to traditional chicken salad.  It has just a bit of a kick, but enough to definitely know the Chipotle's are in there!  I served these on croissants and they were wonderful!

Used goat cheese because my feta was flavored with basil and tomato and I didn't think I'd like that combo. This was delicious! I love chipotle anyway and the combination with the creamy cheeses was great and made a tasty sandwich!

This was delicious! I didnâ€™t have cooked chicken and wanted something fast so I used canned chicken breast. Served it on bread with sliced avocado on the side.

I enjoyed this quite a bit! I don't find that many uses for chipotle in adobo sauce so I was happy to come across this one. I love the smoky heat and the sharpness of the feta. I used it as a spread for toasted pita triangles. I'll use this recipe many times in the future. Thanks! :o)

Sure wasn't what I thought it could be. The only thing I did was use 1 chipotle pepper instead of 1 1/2.  Glad I didn't use all because it would've been a waste of a good chipotle pepper. The salad seemed very dry & like something was lacking.

This was really delicious, we had it on sandwiches and toast.  I only used 1/2 cup mayo as 1c would have been waay too much.  We also didn't have feta so we left that out (would have been even better with it), and instead of green onions we only had shallots which worked nicely.

This gets 5 stars because my bf who does not like chicken salad loved this. I like the standard chicken salad & made a batch of this for him & my own. I tasted his & was actually a little disappointed I hadn't made more for myself.

I made it as is with an addition of cilantro and it was quite tasty!  Unlike other reviewers, I thought it needed the full cup of mayo - otherwise it was too dry.  Perfect for my Keto diet.  Will definitely make again!

I cut this recipe in half and used 1 large can of chicken. I think it's a really great recipe that is fantastic if you tweak it the way you want. I used all 3 chipotle peppers even with cutting the recipe in half. I switched out red onion for the green and added celery, because my husband likes some crunch to his chicken salad. I used a fiesta shredded cheese blend and added just a bit of cumin for some extra flavor. I really think the use of chipotle peppers and sour cream is awesome in this recipe. Thanks!

I loved this salad. Had to make a few adjustments since me and my other half are both lactose intolerant, as much as we love feta. I added greek spices and lemon juice, which in the right amount can make up for sour cream.

Super easy, super good!  I used a rotisserie chicken, but next time will grill some chicken breasts.  The only thing I did different was added sweet onion and a big T. of adobe sauce b/c I love it!!  Not too spicy at all.  Ate on a hamburger bun with avocado and tomato, yum!

it was very good though I did make one substitution. I find the chipotle peppers in adobo a little hot for my taste. I used 2 tp's of Penzey's Chipotle (ground red) instead. It still had plenty of kick for me. Thanks for sharing.

Served  On a multi grain bun with a slice of tomato and Avacado. Loved the taste the chipotle peppers added to this chicken salad. Great recipe.

I use this as a base and add things to it based on what I have on hand. I made a very good variation with cilantro, cherry tomatoes and cucumbers. YUM! Try changing it up a little and see what you can make.

The best chicken salad base recipe ever. I have done a lot with this recipe and I haven't had any complaints. It's always a hit.

I took this recipe and added a can of corn, a can of black beans, and a couple tomatoes and tossed with the dressing made with 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour cream and served on a bed of lettuce for an entree salad.  My boyfriend is still raving about it.
