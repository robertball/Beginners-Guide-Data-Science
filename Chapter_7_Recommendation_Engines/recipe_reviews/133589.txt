Nice low-carb addition instead of the real stuff! I added waterchesnuts to the veggies. I also used poultry seasoning instead of sage, and added onion powder. I didn't add salt bc I try to cook without it. I used about 2/3 cup of low sodium chicken stock instead of water and boullion. I used the flat side of a spoon to smoosh the garbanzo beans and spices together, which seemed to work better (and was cleaner) than using my hands. I found that it needed longer in the oven; I liked it browned on top. Served with turkey tenderloin and green beans. Will make again!

I made this for my family on Thanksgiving.  It was very good.  However, if I made it again I would cut down on the amount of sage used.

We've never been big on bread stuffings, but we love chickpeas, so we decided to give this recipe a try for Thanksgiving.  It was a keeper!  The leftovers tasted even better the next day.  I've already been asked to share the recipe.  Thanks!

This is sooo delicious! It is great to have something so healthy for me that tastes like a food that I would usually try and eat in moderation without it being full of chemical ingredients I can't pronounce. It is a little dryer than stuffing made with bread iw, but it isn't dry in and of itself. I love sage but found it to be a little too strong. Next time I will try using about 3/4 the amount called for. I took another reviewer's advice and used a spoon to mash the beans-- definitely easier this way. Thanks for a great, healthy recipe that will be on my menu at least once a month!

Absolutely fantastic! I was actually stunned by how true to the real thing this comes out- I would just add pine nuts to give it a little crunch. I'd serve this on Thanksgiving, though, and that's pretty high praise.

This was pretty good for what it's intended to be. I like the concept but it wouldn't replace traditional stuffing for me. Not that it needs to do so. The sage was a little heavy for us. I would definitely make this again but perhaps use the seasonings from my regular stuffing recipe rather than so much sage.  Thanks for the great idea.

Had high expectations since relatives have gone gluten free. It was OK & looked like stuffing but just tasted like a pan of chick peas. Leftovers were formed  into patties, fried & served w/ a curry sauce. That was pretty tasty.

I was a little nervous about how this would turn out but I loved the idea of preparing with less calories, carbs, etc.  Everyone loved the twist on the traditional dressing/stuffing.   This is a great recipe for vegetarians and those who follow a low-carb or South Beach way of life.  Thanks!  :D

This was a hit with my family.  My daughter has started cutting her carb intake, just before Christmas, and stuffing is her favorite part of the meal.  I found this recipe, but added my normal stuffing items of sausage, cranberries and apples.  It was so good, that I will use it at our Christmas dinner this year instead of normal bread stuffing!

I so badly wanted this to be delicious -- or even average.  Sadly, it was just not good.  I used less sage, but other than that followed the recipe pretty closely and was disappointed.

I made this for Thanksgiving since I have some family members with a gluten allergy - so breadless is the way to go. This was so delicious, everyone loved it and there were no leftovers - so I'm making more today!  REALLY GOOD!!!

I thought it was great. I did not use mushrooms, but I did not miss them. I think next time I will add bellpipper. And I did not miss the bread taste.

I REALLY enjoyed this! And, definitely will be making it, again! I did not measure my veggies - but went way over the measurements stated in the recipe. I used half of a sweet onion, 3 celery stalks, and a good sized handful of baby bellas. I am out of sage, so I subbed poultry seasoning - and I would do that again. I started out using my masher to mash the chickpeas, then finished with my hands. I added a good handful of lower sugar dried cranberries. My friend's husband tasted it, and liked it before being told there was no bread in it - and was surprised to learn of that "deficit" (= I liked that, while not "low" carb, it was at least healthier than a pan of white bread - and higher in protein! Thank you for sharing!

I was skeptical, but this turned out pretty good. I did find it a tab bit too salty; maybe that's just me. I used a potato masher instead of my hands to mash it, and it seemed to work.

I wanted a gluten-free stuffing for Thanksgiving,  so I found and tried this recipe.  Frankly, I am amazed at how well this turned out!  It went into the oven wet and mushy but came out just like my mom's stuffing.  In honor of her, I added her signature green apple chunks and walnuts, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It was delicious!  Definitely needs the walnuts and apples, though IMO :)  I'm making this again this weekend

Made this exactly to recipe, but used poultry seasoning. This was awful.  Tasted like chick peas with seasoning.

Stuffing is my favorite part of a turkey dinner and I've finally found a satisfying substitute!   Absolutely fantastic, thanks for sharing this recipe.

This recipe is awesome! I make it every year for Thanksgiving as a low carb option :) Super popular, but i also have regular stuffing for those who want it.

Excellent!  I added an apple and used fresh parsley instead of the sage, and garbanzo water instead of the broth.  Turned out lovely.  Will now be a staple!

This recipe turned out absolutely amazing. I used vegetable bouillon instead. It is an awesome alternative for anyone looking for a healthier version of the traditional stuffing.
