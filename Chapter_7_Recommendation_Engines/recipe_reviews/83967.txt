These were pretty good. I omitted the olives and peppers (picky family). I only had enough chicken mixture for two layers. I did use extra cheese, and might add some cumin next time. Will make again.

I substituted Rotel tomatoes for the diced tomatoes.  My husband has requested it again--family favorite!
