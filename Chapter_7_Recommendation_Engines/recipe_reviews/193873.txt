This was very good. I did make a few changes. My husband, a Chef, said you should use loin and not tenderloin. I used a loin roast and was perfect. I added cumin, coriander, a dark beer (fat tire, my favorite), and a spoon full of peanut butter. Sounds strange, but you only want enough fot the nutty flavor, helps bring out the flavors of the beans. Added hot sauce too. Severed over lime flavor chips, toped with black sour cream, cheese and black olives. To me, it was almost a gormet natchos not a chili, but the word chili is different in every place. I think I would take the lid off for an hour, to much liquid or add a little less broth, or even less beer, can always drink what you don't use, right.

Yes! My Auntie Jerre's!  I love it made it several times.  Last time, I added a bottle of beer, green chilies and then hot sauce at the end.  Nice versatile recipe. She knows cooking...

I had some pork stew meat that I bought on clearance that I used in this recipe instead of a pork tenderloin (I am a mom on a very tight budget!). I did double the meat in this recipe only because I had two 1 1/2 pound packages that I needed to use. I tossed the stew meat with a little flour and the spices, then quickly browned the meat in a little EVOO before adding it to the crockpot. The recipe didn't specify which kind of salsa to use so I used salsa verde. This is cooking away right now--smells amazing. I'll update my review once we've had a chance to eat it. EDITED: VERY good. I liked this quite a bit. Next time, I think I'll add more red pepper and add a little more spices, maybe some fresh garlic, too.

A very different recipe for chili.  A nice change.  Make sure you don't add more chicken broth than the recipe calls for.  Also, don't drain the black beans.

Love this recipe.  I made it with "Smokin' Hot" Cilantro salsa and it was quite tasty.  Please note, the nutrition information on the side looks to me to be off considerably.  Based on the ingredients and 8 serving portions, I calculate it closer to 400 calories per serving rather than the 644 shown on the nutrition information.  Do your own math!

This was very good.  I used a pork roast instead of tenderloin to save money.  I added 1 can of mild green chilis and adobo seasoning.  Served over chips with sour cream.

I thought this was great.  I also added green chilies like others recommended.  Though I did serve this over a cilantro lime rice.  The combo was really good.

This was delicious! Healthy and very good. I added 1/2 bottle of beer, minced garlic and a bay leaf. Delish! Very hearty and filling, as well. A keeper, for sure.

I used the recipe as inspiration for the ingredients I had on hand and it is super tasty. (My changes - generous amounts of mexican seasoning blend, and chili powder. A whooole lotta garlic, big fat cloves sliced up. Pinto beans with jalapenos. Fire roasted tomatoes with adobo seasoning. Chopped fresh pasilla pepper as well as the red pepper. Fresh chopped serrano peppers.) Will definitely do this again.

Awesome recipe, I make something similar stove top but use ground turkey which my bf ask for all the time. So I thought this would be a hit, it really was! I followed the recipe exactly with two exceptions, I found it needed more chicken broth so I added that and we love corn in our chili so I added that :)) Delish! I also paired it with corn bread, very yummy. BF thinks he may be asking more of this vs. the stove top!

We LOVED this recipe! Never would've thought to use a pork roast for chili, but let me tell you, it worked out wonderfully. I didn't find any need to slice up the pork into strips; just put the roast in the crockpot whole and then you can easily shred the meat with a couple of forks before serving. Also, there's no need to use pork tenderloin. A less expensive cut of pork works well as the slow cooker will make it super tender. This is now known as "Piggy Chili" in our house; thanks for the post!

This is delicious!! I made it more or less according to the recipe - I rarely measure anything, especially when it comes to chili, soup, etc.  I did use my own homemade salsa instead of commercial, because that's what was on hand, and added a bottle of Dos Equis Amber beer.  It took no time to load the slow cooker. After ladling into my bowl, I topped it with ff sour cream - oh, so good!! Hubby used a Mexican blend of cheeses on his, and was "m'mming" all the way to the bottom of his bowl! He usually takes leftovers for his lunch, but I cooked something else for him so that I could have them to myself!!! This dish is now on my recipe rotation - thanks so much!

I love this recipe. I have made it numerous times. I do make a few changes though. I use one can black beans, one can light red kidney beans, one can dark red kidney beans (instead of three cans black beans...for variation). I also add in one can of corn and one can of diced tomatoes. My husband loves this and loves having leftovers for his lunch at work. I usually pair this with rolls, corn bread, and/or tortilla chips. I also love to add cheese and sour cream to my serving :-)

This was really a great recipe. Super easy to make. Didn't have black beans so I used 2 cans of pinto beans instead. Used a can of roasted tomatoes and a small can of green chilis instead of salsa. Delicious...

I make this recipe so often, that my friends and family think of it as "my" recipe now.  Everyone loves it.  People ask for second helpings -- even those serious foodies, who consider themselves gourmets/gourmands. Thank you for publishing this recipe!  I cook it on the stove top: brown the meat with the onions, then add the rest of the ingredients and simmer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  Use your favorite salsa.

My whole family loved this.  We used a pork loin roast like mara840 suggested it was approx. 2 1/4 which probably gave a better meat to bean ratio.  I cut it in half so it would cook faster and trimmed off the layer of fat on top.  At the end I just shredded the meat with a fork.  I took the lid off at the end like others suggested, but I don't think that was necessary.  I added 2 cloves chopped garlic and a green pepper and extra onion and a can of green chilies because I had it on hand and it's healthy.  I chopped the veggies pretty small too.  I served it over brown rice which was pretty good and also fried up some polenta which I had on had.  Polenta wasn't good on its own, but fabulous when topped with this chili.  My boys even loved it.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was rather bland and watery, more like soup than chili.  I then started adding other ingredients.  For flavor and to thicken, I added one small can of tomato paste, half a bottle of beer, half cup brown sugar, and 1/4 cup jalapeno slices.  I probably will not make this recipe again.

We make this all the time and love to freeze the extras. I play around with this menu and what I have in my pantry and it always turns out great! We love lots of tomatoes, beans, and corn in ours and use pork shoulder (instead of tenderloin). After 8 hours in the crockput the meats falls into pieces! Great recipe- customize it, it's very forgiving!

this was very good and healthy.  i cut up the pork into cubes before cooking to avoid having to do it later.  only other aleration i made was to add a can of green chilis.  i also used a cilantro flavored salsa.  10 hours on low in crock.   for added texture, top chili with crumbled tortilla chips just before serving.

I am not a chile connoisseur; my husband is.  I discovered that I prefer pork in my chile as opposed to ground beef.  Huh...who knew?  I really liked this, but I think I would have liked it even better had I used hot salsa instead of mild.  My husband added cayenne pepper to his.  I was trying to use up foods I already had in my pantry, so I used 1 can of black beans and 2 of light red kidney beans.  I will definitely make this again.

I had an almost 3lb pork loin roast. I wanted chunks instead of shredded meat, so I cut it up, flour and salt and peppered it and browned with the onions and garlic. Then cooked it in the crock pot. I used my own homemade salsa and also added some jalapeños and chili peppers from the garden. Still used the three cans of beans called for, just one was red beans. Simmered it a good 8 hours and it was so delicious, we topped it with some sour cream, scallions and cheddar cheese.

I am rating this recipe on the changes I made to the origional recipe, but without the changes, the chili would be awesome too!  I can't tolerate black beans, so added what I had(1 can great northern, 1 can red kidney and 1 can chili beans, all drained and rinsed). Sliced thin a pork loin, trimmed of fat and added a can of diced green chilies instead of green pepper, which I don't like. After it cooked for about 4 hours, I added 1/2 cup dark beer. Cooked a total of 8 hours on low, then shredded the pork strips(they were very tender and it was easy to do). The flavor was outstanding. I think next time I will try it with a can of fire roasted tomatoes. This recipe will be wonderful with multiple changes and additions and will be in my Favorites file!

I had lost my taste for chili a while ago.  We made a pork roast and needed to use up the leftover meat.  My husband found this recipe and made it for me while I was at work.  He normally does not do the cooking.  To my suprise this turned out to be the best chili I have had in a while.  I even ate  the leftovers, which I normally never do.  Will try with steak next.  Excellent flavor and easy to make.  I printed off the recipe and gave it to some girls at work to try.

Excellent!! I halved the recipe and used boneless sirloin pork chops instead of the tenderloin. The low and slow cooking method makes the meat fall-apart tender, so I didn't bother using an expensive cut of pork. I'm not sure why people said not to increase the amount of liquid because while I halved everything else, I kept the 1/2 cup of chicken broth. After 8 hours on low there was very little liquid, so instead of serving this as a stew I made up a batch of Lime Cilantro Rice (from this site) and served the stew over that. Fantastic combination!! Thank you so much; I'll make often! :)

I really hate being the poor reviewer here, but.... Neither my hubby or I liked this - AT ALL. For my DH, this was too beany (but he isn't a fan of beans anyways). Oddly, I thought the same thing (on the contrary, I LOVE beans). The ratio of beans / pork was terribly off. This was nothing more than black bean soup with a bit of pork. I even "doctored" this up a bit by adding a bottle of Corona lite and a 4 oz. can of diced green chilies as ValleyGirl mentioned she sometimes does. I used premium salsa too. I just don't know what all the rave reviews are about (?). Even with fresh cilantro garnish, this was quite mediocre. I must say, for ease of preparation and cost of ingredients, this is deserving of 5 stars, but tastewise, I can't give more than 3 (and really shouldn't...). I enjoyed the southwest salad (Dole blend) and black bean & salsa bread (purchased from my grocer's bakery) MUCH more than the main course and would have been VERY hungry without both. Sorry ValleyGirl. I'm not sure how your Aunt won first place with this recipe, but I'm happy for her nonetheless. :)

This recipe did not disappoint! I made it as the recipe written except that I used green bell pepper instead of red. The recipe does not indicate that the black beans be drained but after researching whether or not black beans should be drained I decided to drain them. (The video for the recipe does say to drain them.)  After 40 years of never draining beans for chili's I have made I decided to drain the beans for this and am glad I did.  As often with crock-pot cookery the dishes look like they need more liquid than they do and in the end I tend to wish that I had not added any additional liquids because more then enough comes from the vegetables and meat as they cook.  As someone else suggested I served this over cilantro lime rice with a dollop of reduced fat sour cream on top. I read that many people add some beer to this recipe.  I'm sure it has a great flavor but the recipe will be more soup like rather than stew consistency.

I've made this a number of times now and thought I should finally give it the rating it deserves.  I do a fair amount of slow cooker recipes, so any that have a good flavor are very appreciated at our house! I think the combo of ingredients really blends well.  I've made minor adjustments based on ingredients on hand, and it always works out.  I love to have leftovers with eggs the next day as a sort of huevos rancheros- yum, tastes even better the next day!

I made this extremely easy meal one day, not expecting much. I used a Loin roast, instead of a tenderloin - you cook it for so long, it will come out tender. My family surprisingly stopped by and I served it over rice, with a little bit of cheese. My 15-year-old sister begged my Mom to get the recipie, my mom went out and got a crock pot so she can make it and my Dad - the meat-and-potato guy - was telling everyone how good it was. I froze the leftovers and send it with myhusband when he travels!!! I'm going home to eat some leftovers now!!!! Yum... Oh, I used Cilatro salsa and added corn and some hot sauce! Perfect, easy dinner!!!

Fabulous!  I cooked it on the stove sauteing the onion and chunked tenderloin.    When the onion became translucent the other ingredients were added after draining two cans of the black beans.  After bringing to a boil, the chili simmered between 60 and 90 minutes before the tenderloin was removed and shredded.  The tenderloin then was placed back in the pot with two cans of Rtoel tomatoes with green chilis.  This one is definitely a keeper.

I love recipes that are simple to throw together for those busy days when we don't have forever to spend in the kitchen.  I followed this recipe exactly, did not read any reviews.  It really was simple to make but I found the overall taste as written to be pretty bland.  It needs something to give it a kick, I used medium salsa, maybe hot would have been better and perhaps a few Jalapenos.

For me, this was only an okay recipe... I found it a little thin and bland.  I think I would have liked it better with a different bean... pintos maybe?  While I love the flavor of black beans, they don't work as well in a chili for me, as I like my chili thick

I thought this was good, but not really fantastic. I cook for a family with 3 kids. I would have given this 3 stars, but the some what picky 4 y/o said this was the most wonderful thing he ever had in his mouth! I changed a few things. Added frozen corn (kids like corn), used a crock pot after browning meat/onions, inreased the chili/cumin. In the last 30 minutes of cooking, I threw in cilantro and the juice of one lime. Poured it into a casserole, topped it with cheddar cheese, baked until cheese melted. I will make this for the family again.

This recipe is fabulous!  I followed the recipe and used the tenderloin.  I put it in the slow cooker whole and after 8-10 hours, I pulled it out and shredded it.  It was so tender.  My husband doesn't like black beans, so I substituted a small white bean, maybe navy beans.  I also added some fresh jalapenos.  We served with sour cream.  Yummy!  Thanks for sharing!

I made a version of this based on what I had which ended up being leftover thick cut pork chops with the bone. I simmered the pork chops on low until they fell of the bone. De-fatted the broth and used that broth instead of chicken. I didn't have salsa on hand but used two large tomatoes and added garlic and a bit more cumin. Awesome. Everyone loved it!

This was amazing!  I used a pork loin roast rather than a tenderloin and it came out very tender.  I served it with Cilantro Lime rice and it reminded me so much of a burrito bowl from Chipotle.  I will definitely make this again.

If you use mild salsa, this is a very mild chili, which makes it perfect for smaller kiddos. I served this last night to 4 adults and 6 kids (6-12 years old) and everyone loved it. Those who wanted it spicy added a few drops of hot pepper sauce. I didn't drain the beans. Served with shredded cheese and sour cream. Meant to put avocados on the table too--but forgot!

So good! I forgot to review this the first time I made it. A very comforting and hearty dish, although I do add garlic, diced tomatoes, jalapenos and a pinch of red pepper  flakes because I love spice! So good and can be made on stove top on low for 4 to 6 hours also. Meat just falls apart with barely any effort. Sooo good. :) Thanks!

This was great!  We drained the liquid and served over rice with A Hint of Lime Tortilla chips.  Also topped with Cheddar cheese and sour cream.   I also added a small can of green chilies while cooking, as others suggested.

Love it!!!  I used pork stew and if I hadn't of had it on hand, would have used a "cheap" cut of pork.  I have made it twice now and it is a nice change.

I also added extras as everyone else did. I cooked some black beans and rice in chicken broth before adding to the mixture. I also added jalapenos and corn to the veggies & used some hot sauce, seasoning salt & a bay leaf to the spices. As far as the meat I used a pork shoulder that I just cut in to pieces it's a little fatty but if you marinate it in some peanut butter & sweet bbq sauce I think it really adds some flavor. This is a really easy fun crock pot recipes that you can add all kinds of extras to.

Excellent! Perfectly spiced. Varied the beans with 1 can black, 1 can white, and 1 can pinto.

Everyone in my family - including the kids -  enjoyed this recipe.  It exceeded my expectations.  I did use a pork loin and about a half a bottle of beer.  Otherwise, followed the original recipe.  Highly recommend!

Good and easy, but I did find that it needed more flavor, so I added garlic salt, doubled the chili powder and cumin, also some cayenne pepper.  Toppings are important, I believe - shredded cheese, sour cream, scallions, and avocado.  Some cilantro would have been a nice garnish as well.  Family said they really enjoyed it and would eat again.  There are so many recipes out there that I may try something else next time, but I am happy I made it.

Very good.  Threw in a can of Rotel just to give it a little kick since all I had was mild salsa.

Wow!  I'd give this 10 stars if I could!  DELICIOUS!  I added a small can of green chilis and used a combination of black beans and red kidney beans.  I also squirted in some Sriracha sauce to give it a bit more kick.  When you shred the pork, the chili really thickens up quite nicely.  We topped it with shredded cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  I ate mine with tortilla scoops.  YUM!

I wanted to put 5 stars but since I made some changes, thought I'd better not. I read the comments & changed the following: used pork loin, added 2 minced garlic cloves, 1 minced jalapeno, 2 chopped chipotles in adobe sauce, spoonful of peanut butter & eyeballed salsa. I omitted the chix broth b/c there was plenty of liquid + we like it thicker; after shredding pork, it was perfect texture. Topped with cheese & sour cream. It was easy, tasted fantastic & nearly the perfect heat as is (we like it hot!). Thanks to Aunt Jerre!

Great, easy recipe.  My family loved it.  The only change I made was to use one can of spicy chili beans and two cans of black beans, instead of the three that it called for.

This is so delicious and pretty easy to make!  I did these minor variations: used pork loin, I had a 1.11 lb roast and cubed it.  I only had 2 cans of black beans and I used those and substituted a can of hominy for the 3rd because the flavors mesh well.  It was delicious.  Since I cooked it overnight and woke up smelling it, I used for an omelet filling Sunday morning, sprinkling it with a little cheese and chopped fresh tomato.  Yum, what a great versatile recipe.  I thank you for passing on your Aunt Jerre's recipe!

This was delicious! Not quite as thick as a traditional chili, but I didn't mind that. If you wanted it thicker, you could drain the beans or leave the chicken broth out, but I liked it the way it was and thought it tasted even better reheated the next day.

Fantastic, especially given how easy it is to put together. Threw it in the crock pot in 15 minutes, and had a delicious chili for dinner. I used pinto beans (only 2 cans), because that's what I had, and also, about 30 minutes before eating I added a can of diced green chilis. Gave it a little extra zing. A keeper, thanks!

My whole family loved this recipe! I made a few changes. I used canned tomatoes instead of salsa. It''s cheaper and doesn't contain sugar. I only cooked it for 5 hours on high. I put the pork in whole and then shredded it at the end to save time. It came apart beautifully! I also added the beans 1 hour before the end because I was concerned they would turn to mush and also added a little more of the seasonings at this time. 1 and 1/2 the recipe made two meals for me and the 4 6ft. guys in my family.

I wasn't sure what to expect......pork in a chili?  But, this was delicious!  My husband told me that this was a keeper!  Leftovers were delicious as well.
Will definitely make again.

Something was missing in this recipe, just not sure what.  Awfully expensive meat to be slow cooking it.  Probably won't make again.

delicious - makes a ton.  I pureed my salsa out of personal preference for no chunks, and added some corn as well.  Served over rice, with cornbread on the side.

I have to give this one 5 stars even though I have never cooked it for the 10 hours.  I always have pork loin or chops left over from dinner.  I cut up my leftovers and add everything else and let simmer for 45 minutes or so.  Makes for a super quick dinner and kids and husband really like it!  I also add the peanut butter as suggested by another reviewer.  Great recipe, I've made it several times!

Outstanding! I used approximately 2lb of pork loin and added about 2/3 of a bottle of Guinness beer. I had my husband roast the red pepper and 3 ears of corn on the grill. I also added about 5 cloves of roasted garlic.  For the black beans, I used 2 cans of Bush's Black Bean Fiesta and 1 can of regular black beans.

I had a one pound pre-seasoned tenderloin,used kidney and black beans,chili powder, I was suprised at the flavor, very good. Only changes next will be cutting meat up ahead of time, I left mine whole till the end then shredded it but found the pieces were kinda big to eat with a spoon in the end. I added diced tomatos. I will not drain the beans next time either, will be doing again or sure.

Excellent chili w/ a different twist.  I used pork loin, cut up into larger chunks and cooked on hi for 4 hours.  Pork shredded easily.  Great for a snowy Saturday meal.

Delicious! The house smelled amazing when I got home from work. Like many reviewers, I used pork loin instead of tenderloin. When you are slow cooking like this, you can often use cheaper cuts of meat, since the low and slow heat tenderizes just about anything. Even after shredding the pork, I felt the consistency was more like a stew than a chili, but I was actually happier with that result.

Give your Aunt Jerre a hug from me!  This recipe was absolutely devine.  My husband devoured it.  And I couldn't get enough either.  Easy to make and the flavors came together beautifully.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe.  Your Aunt Jerre deserved FIRST prize!

Thank you so much for this recipe! It is so good!  Only changes I made were a three bean mix of pinto beans, dark red kidney beans and black beans. And I added some chopped jalapeno. The pork tenderloin I used was 2.3 pounds.  So a meatier chili. And I left it whole in the Crock-Pot til it was time to serve then I shredded it. I have a newer fast cooking crock pot like so many others of us do but since my  pork tenderloin  was still a little bit Frozen  I definitely cooked it  10 hours on low. Served with a little sour cream some cheddar cheese and corn tortilla chips. Loved it and can't wait to use the leftovers for quesadillas or tacos and freeze the rest! Thanks Jerre!

As others, I added some items that really made it yummy. I added chopped garlic, bay leaf, green chili's and a healthy squirt of Sriracha. I used pork loin which I was able to find marinated in lime and cilantro which added more flavor depth and kept the pork tender. I would absolutely make this again!

Jerre’s recipe is a great idea and a good basis for making it your own. As is, I think it would be too bland. I gathered suggestions from other reviewers and it was a huge 5 star success. Hot enough to make my husband’s nose run, but not too hot for me with added cheese and sour cream. 

I served it over brown rice in a bowl lined around the edges with Lime Tortilla chips. Next time I’d just use regular tortilla chips for scooping. We squeezed a little lime over the chili and that was enough. It was a little soupy, but fine over rice and I think it will thicken up. If not, it’s still good.

I started the crockpot on low at 8:45 a.m for about an hour, upped it to high for about 3 hours and back to low until we ate around 6:00 p.m.

I used a 1.6 lb package of thick boneless pork chops and increased the seasonings a little to account for that. I cut them in large cubes which were hard to shred, but I liked the chunks of meat too.

I substituted one can of corn for a can of beans (all drained). 
I kept the onion and the red pepper the same and used medium salsa.  
My additions: 4 oz can of mild green chopped chiles, 14.5 oz can of fire roasted diced tomatoes with Adobo seasoning, 3 Tbs minced garlic from a jar (equivalent to 3 cloves). 
I used 2 chicken bouillon cubes and 1/2 c  of ale instead of chicken broth (we drank the remainder of the ale with the chili). Yum!

It’s a keeper.

I loved how simple it was!  I liked it a lot and ate two bowls.  My girls only gave it a 5 or 6 on a scale of 1 to 10 though, they just thought it was okay.  But I was pleasantly surprised and I would make it again.

I have made this chili about 10 times now, and the whole family loves it!  Sometimes I use the canned black beans, but sometimes I soak black beans and they work great too.  I usually add a little more onion than it calls for.  It is a great chili recipe.  It is not really SPICY so my little kids like it too.  You can make it spicy if you want though, but I think it would cover up the delicious taste of the pork and the beans.  I use pork loin, and not the tenderloin...but I have also used pork country style boneless ribs.  It always turns out great.

I'm writing a "Pre-Review" because I changed things up a bit due to on hand ingredients and review suggestions I warped into my own version.  I will edit this after dinner tonight :)

I had a 15oz Peppercorn Tenderloin so I scaled the recipe to 5 servings (but it looks more like 6-7 to me)and cubed the meat into small pieces.  I used 3/4 of a red onion, 3/4 of a yellow bell pepper, 1 can of black beans, 4 small chicken bullion cubes, 2 cups plus one can (bean can) of water, 1 1/2 cups medium salsa, 1/2 cup salsa verde, 1/2 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp oregano, and 1 1/4 tsp chili powder.  I am cooking this on high for 4 hours and will transfer to stove-top if not done at that time.  With fewer ingredients and higher temps I don't foresee a problem as this has worked for me with many slow cooker recipes over the years.  Looking forward to updating tonight!

Wow! Tasty, easy, versatile, and diabetic friendly. What else can you ask for? This has to be the most successful crock pot recipe I have ever seen. It's not only ridiculously easy to make, it's ridiculously delicious! I made it as written with the single variance of adding a small can of green chilies. There are so many ways you can riff on this basic recipe, you can make it once a month for a year and never repeat the same meal. I would give it more stars if I could.

Just started a pot of this wonderful and versatile chili in my slow cooker!  I like to start with the recipe as written and tweak the spices as it cooks.  This is my favorite "leftover lunch"!  Everyone in the break room takes notice when I reheat it in the microwave!  I like to add Greek yogurt or ff sour cream to mine.

This soup is tasty, but it's not really that special.  It's just a standard black bean soup recipe with pork added.  Very nutritious though.

This was a nice dish.  The only change I made was to use chili flavored can tomatos  and 1/4 cup diced jalapenos because I didn't have any salsa on hand.  I will make again but will use hot salsa as mine needed more kick.

DEEEELICIOUS!  Started it this morning for tonight's dinner.  Didn't have any chicken broth, but had enough liquid in it that I felt it didn't need it anyway.  The pork pulled apart very easily, and we ate it on tortillas--some corn, others flour.  I'm recommending this recipe to my friends/family!  Give Aunt Jerre my thanks for sharing this recipe!

I love this recipe! I cook it twice a month to take to work for a week. The only thing I do differently is that I season and brown the pork chunks before I toss them in the crock pot. Then I de-glaze the pan I brown them in with the broth. Om-nom-nom.

Have made this several times now for family gatherings, everyone raves. I've changed it a bit each time and came up with the perfect combo. I add a 4oz can of green chilis, 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1 green pepper, and a cup of frozen corn. My aunt won't let me visit unless I am bringing some. LOL

Needed more flavor, so I doubled the chili powder and cumin, and added some cayenne pepper. A 4.5 that we will cook again.

It is SOOOOOOO good! I can't wait to make it again!  My husband and mother in law LOVED it and so did I! I did do 2 cans black bean 1 can red (just to mix it up) and also had some fresh corn I threw in to boot.  You can do SO much with this! My husband made burritos with it, it was awesome with in a bread bowl with some cheese on top and it would be aesome on nachos.  I am SOO excited about this it is not even funny! Took 15 minutes in the morning to do and came home to a fantastic meal!  It did make ALOT of food though so you will have left overs OR you can feed a huge family!

Wow, was this good! And so easy and forgiving. I picked up two pounds of pork sirloin chops for cheap at the store, and was looking for something to do with them. I remembered this recipe, and it worked great. I did change things based on what I had on hand- used 1 can of black beans, 1/2 jar of salsa, and a dark beer in place of the chicken broth. To make up for not having quite enough salsa, I doubled the spices. Awesome! The meat just fell apart at the end. I served it in bowls over the "Lime Cilantro Rice" from this site, and it was perfect. I plan to freeze about half of it as well. Thanks for sharing, ValleyGirl!

This was great! I read the other reviews and incorporated some of their ideas (added frozen corn, left the tenderlon whole and shedded it at the end, reduced number of cans of beans because I only had one, increased chicken broth to 1 cup) and it was a smash hit at my house. And so totally simple to throw together! This will become a regular at our house. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a big hit with my husband! I made a couple changes. 2 lbs pork, 1 can black beans, 1 can light kidney beans and 1 can dark kidney beans. Also added 2 serranos. It came out perfectly! Especially delicious topped with shredded cheese and sour cream. This will be a reoccurring dish in our household.

I make this recipe often and my family loves it. I do add a little more of all the seasonings and I think it is much better with green peppers instead of red.

I liked this quite a bit. The pork was wonderfully tender after being in the slow cooker for so long. However, both my husband and I felt that it was missing something, though we're not sure what (maybe a can of diced or stewed tomatoes..). I would make again though, because it was very easy to make and very filling.

Really good and really easy.  The pork shredded so easily after cooking all day in the slow cooker.  The flavors were terrific.  Great fall day chili.  Served with mexican cornbread.

Absolutely loved it! So simple but the flavors are fabulous! I too doubled the spices and the chicken broth and it was the perfect amount of liquid. My husband went back for 2nds, which he never does except for ice cream!

Delicious! I follwed the recipe exactly, using a 1.7lb pork tenderloin and slow cooking for 9 hours. I loved the southwest flavors and the pork was so tender, will definitely make again!

This was a great recipe! I did not use salsa or chicken broth. Instead, I used a whole bottle of beer, a 28oz can of fire roasted tomatoes, and a small can of green chilies. Next time I will buy a bigger can or two cans of chilies and cut back to 2 cans of beans. I like meat/bean ratio to be in favor of the meat! I also used a pork loin that was frozen and it worked great. I did remove the pork first and scraped the fat off before shredding. I also plan on using the leftovers as a burrito filling.

I made this wanting to not have it too dry, so I used an entire can of chicken broth, and added a bottle of dark beer and the water from the beans.  I also added a small can of chopped chilis and omitted the red bell pepper.  The end result was a bit more like soup than chili, so I made rice and layered the chili on top of the rice in the bowl.  I then added the garnishments (shredded sharp chedder cheese, advocado, cilantro and sour cream) and OMG, how delicious!  The tenderloin 2" thick slices didn't really break up while cooking but I broke most of them myself in the pot into big chunks, and the meat easily broke up further in the bowls. I WILL make this again omitting only the chicken broth, which I assume will make it thicker and I will try it over chips, as I had originally intended to tonight.

I made this using a bag of  black beans that I slow cooked, (not from a can). I did not have the bell peppers, but this was still a very good chili. I also used a pork roast - a cheaper cut, since this was to be slow cooked (save yourself some money and purchase a cheaper cut, it will still come out just as good and tender). I actually slow cooked the pork roast the previous day for BBQ pork sands, and I saved half of that pork (minus the BBQ sauce) and  used the left-over's for this chili by adding it the last 30 minutes of the cooking time.  This chili was amazing, and easy peasy. I have a family of 6 and big eaters, but because I used a bag of black beans, and a cheaper cut of pork this chili is super easy on your budget, especially if you need to feed a crowd. We had more than enough to freeze for another meal - which even further stretches your grocery budget. This chili is very economical and I LOVE that!  I served this with "Grandmothers Buttermilk Cornbread", and I will more than likely use the rest of this left over chili in burritos for our next meal.

I made this tonight, and my family absolutely loved it. The only differences that I made were to add about a Tbsp of garlic and I used Mrs. Dash chili lime seasoning instead of the chili powder. I probably used a little extra of the Mrs. Dash also. This was so amazing. It was filling, healthy, and delicious, and it was so simple to make! I added chopped avocado, crushed tortilla chips, chopped cilantro, and cheese to the bowls just before serving. I did add just a little salt also, but that might vary depending on the brand of beans and salsa you use. Thank you Jerre for a great recipe!

We found this to be a little bland and ended up adding more spices as we were eating.  I even added a jalapeno whil this was cooking but that just wasn't enough for us.

Very good.  It had a good flavor and the pork was very tender.  I cooked mine for 7 1/2 hours.  All the kids raved - they came up with the 5 star rating.  I served with a dollop of sour cream and shredded cheddar.

Valley Girl, you and your Aunt Jerre just might be my new best friends!  I had to force myself to stop at one bowl!!!  I made only a few minor changes: I only had 1/2 jar of salsa so I added a can of rotel & used a small can of veggie broth (instead of the 1/2 c of chicken broth).  My only  addition was 1/2 cup of burgundy wine.  My house smells fantastic, my lunch was wonderful and I can not wait until dinner tonight to have another bowl.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!!!

This is great! I used 2 1/2 pounds of pork tenderloin cut into big chunks and used 2 cans of black beans and one can of chili beans.  Also, added a can of diced jalapenos to give it a little extra spice.  Cooked on high for 5 hours and it was perfect.

Initially, I thought it was a bit bland after tasting just the chili with nothing extra added to it. Then I added some salt, pepper, cheese, and sour cream to my bowl of chili and it was great!

Very good.  I didn't have 3 cans of black beans, so I just used 2, and it turned out fine.  I also used  a pork tenderloin that was pre seasoned with onion and garlic.  It had perhaps some other seasonings as well, but it worked perfectly.  The salsa gave it a nice bite and the beans and pork made this a very filling dinner.  I let it cook in the slow cooker probably about 8 1/2 hours, then broke up the pork with a fork.  It was so tender and easy to break up, and it definitely does make it a thicker chili as opposed to a stew if you break up the pork chunks.  Bf gave this his seal of approval.  :o)  Thanks for the recipe!

I cut the tenderloin into cubes.  I did drain the beans because I read it cuts down on the "gas factor".  Next time I will but the meat into strips.  Everyone loved it!!!

Very good chili that was extremely easy to make. Followed directions to a "t". The only thing I would like more is for it to be a little thicker but that's an easy fix.

This is a great, easy, quick recipe and the next time I make it I'm sure it will be even better.  I will use a hotter salsa and will take another reviewer's recommendation to use 2 cans of black beans and one can spicy chili beans.  Also, since we like our chili with a lot of tomatoes I added a can of diced tomatoes with green chilies.  Just like some other reviewers said, it seemed a little runny for chili until I shredded the pork.  Then it was the perfect chili consistency and perfect for the first week of fall!  I thought my stud husband had the best chili recipe...until tonight!  This will now be our go to chili recipe.  Even my picky 3 yr old liked it a lot!!!

My family enjoyed this and it was a nice change of pace from the regular chili.  I too added a can of green chiles and some garlic.  I added extra broth initially so it was really watery at the end but once I shredded the pork a little bit it absorbed all the juice and thickened right up.

I wasn't sure what to expect with this but it was very good.  If you like your food spicy, use Meijer Gold Medium Habanero Lime Salsa.  Gave it a good kick.  Will make again and again.

Bottom line:  Delicious!   I was dubious after reading so many mixed reviews  (not real chili! must add more stuff!) but decided to follow the recipe exactly (almost) to give it an honest assessment.  I made no additions to the recipe but did use a medium onion. As far as draining the beans I drained only the top liquid off of 2 of the 3 cans (I will probably drain a bit more liquid off next time)  Also, I trimmed the pork to remove ALL the fat and snappy stuff.   I used Kroger brand medium salsa, which gave it *just* the right amount of heat.  TIP - to shred the meat post-cooking I used a slotted spoon to pull the meat out into a shallow bowl to shred it pretty finely, then dumped the shredded meat back in.  Impossible to do while the meat chunks are still swimming around in the crock pot.  Definitely recommend this recipe as written!

My husband rated this as a five, so I will as well. He said it was missing some seasoning but he really enjoyed it. I didn’t use tenderloin but loin, based on someone else’s review.

This was delicious!  No changes necessary.  Do drain the beans.  I imagine it would have been watery if not!

My family enjoyed this recipe. I did use 3/4 cup of chicken broth and this didn't seem to cause any issues - there was lots of liquid. I also put in 2 onions as it is quite a large recipe for only a small onion. I felt it was lacking salt, despite the chicken broth. The recipe doesn't call for it. It was a little bland without it. I would add 1 tsp for starters next time.

too watery.  cooked it uncovered to reduce it.  I didn't even add the liquid it called for.  Flavor was very mild. It was just OK.

Followed recipe as written, and set slow cooker for 8 hours. It  tasted delicious, but it was a little too mushy for me. I think 6 or 7 hours cooking would be better.

I used pork loin, like many recommended! I added some green chiles, and substituted a can of corn for one of the cans of black beans. I also added twice the chili powder, and used hot salsa. Put in more onions than called for (which I loved!), and would probably think about putting two peppers in it instead on one. In the future I might leave off the chicken broth, and add a few diced up jalapeños.  All in all, very good!

I had more meat and less black beans than the recipe called for so I made my necessary changes. I doubled the spices because of the meat and I added 1 can of corn to offset the missing beans. I also added 1 can of Ro-tel tomatoes with green chilis as I didnt have enough salsa for a double recipe.  I would have made this as if I had all the ingredients but for a meal out of the pantry this was really good.

Great recipe! I haven't made it as stated because I just used what I had on hand. I substituted 1lb dried great northern beans for the black beans and used an entire box of chicken stock. I also added green chiles and salt. Seriously good. This will go in the regular rotation!

So easy, and so flavorful.  I didn't make any changes.  I can see that depending on your favorite salsa, it can take on different tastes.  Used the cilantro flavored La Victoria.  Keeping this one!

Made this three times in as many weeks!! Super recipe! While it is PERFECT as is, I have noticed that the salsa you use is very important (use a good one). I added a fresh jalapeno for some more heat, but this recipe is fabulous! I have shared it many times, already! Thanks for sharing this award winning recipe (I see why it did so well)!

I took the suggestion of others and added a brown ale.  I think next time I make it I'll add another can of beans.  Both my 1 1/2 year old and 4 year old emptied their plates!

My family loved this recipe.  Of course I had to doctor it up as suggested in several reviews.  Instead of 3 cans of black beans, I used 1 can black beans, 1 can pinto beans and 1 can spicy chili beans.  I also added a 1/2 cup of beer, green chilies, garlic, diced tomatoes, dried cilantro and a little "Frank's Red Hot Sauce".  Topped it off with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream.  Wonderful flavor and not too watery.  The only thing I would do different is I would break up the pork about an hour before serving to blend the flavors into the pork.  Our 7 year old daughter says "that chili is awesome".  My husband added some chopped jalapenos and extra hot sauce.  Definitely will make again.

OK, I don't know what went wrong because I followed the recipe exactly and this dish was extremely bland and quite dry --there was nowhere near as much gravy as in the pictures. But I can't for the life of me figure out what might have gone wrong; this recipe sounds quite straightforward and pretty much foolproof. Perhaps it would have been less dry if I hadn't drained the beans (the video specified they had to be drained), but even then, it tasted so bland that I had to add tons of hot sauce and salt to make this dish half palatable. I just don't get the raving reviews.

This was so bland, I don't understand why people are raving about it.  After four hours I tasted it and poured in half a bottle of beer.  It didn't make it much better but at least now I didn't care so much.

I made this for a family gathering and it was a huge hit! I actually cooked in my big pot on the stove and then transferred it to the crock pot when we left the house. I added more chicken broth and some roasted green chili's to it.  Will be one of my favorites!

I didn't have the time for making it on low, so I went 4 1/2 hours on high and the meat was amazing. I didn't have green chilis on hand but next time I'll use them. Reminds me of a really good bean soup more than a chili, but who cares? It tastes so good. I also used a pork roast instead of a tenderloin.

I used a 3 lb pork roast I know a ton of meat... but man is this good!!!!!!!

This came out better then I thought it would.  I made a few substitutions.  I used 1.5 lbs of pork shoulder cubed up, green pepper instead of red, substituted a bottle of beer for the chicken broth, and added a can of chopped chili peppers.  I also drained the beans as I don't think bean juice adds to any recipe.  My local grocery store sells a really delicious chipotle salsa that I used.    About halfway through the cooking I was worried the pork wouldn't be tender enough, but when I went to shred it a few hours later it just fell apart.  Added a few dashes of hot sauce at the end for heat.  This is going into the winter soup rotation for sure.

Great Recipe, Like all recipes, I used this as a guide and added, 1/8# of bacon, substituted one of the black bean cans with pinto beans, added garlic, a serano pepper, omitted the broth and added one bottle of dark beer.  Cam out perfect liquid was...and was Wonderful in flavor.  Thanks valley Girl for sharing.

Excellent chili and so super easy!  I used a pork roast and shredded it up after it was cooked.  Doubled the recipe and used one jar salsa verde and one regular salsa.  It was a big hit at a small get together of friends. Hubby also enjoyed this the next day after it had thickened up as burrito filling.

This was good.  I added fresh garlic and some dried cilantro instead of the oregano.  I probably will add more spices and heat next time.  I also just used a pork roast because tenderloin is expensive and tender to begin with I cant think of putting it in a crockpot all day.  I may add some lime juice to it also next time.

Pretty good flavor.  I ended up adding minced garlic and garlic salt to give it more flavor.  I also used a hand-held blender to give the chili added thickness.  To serve, I added a small scoup of sour cream, minced onions and jalepenos for added texture.

Added beer (porter) instead of chicken stock, and omitted red bell pepper (didn't have any).   Added 1 can tomato paste.  Used a pork tenderloin that was preseasoned, and added some chipotle in adobo (we like spicy chili), as well as some Mrs Dash Table variety.   Was delicious!!! Keeper recipe - neither my fiance or myself is big on pork but this is a keeper!

I made this today exactly how the recipe was written. I did tilt the crock pot lid for the last 2-3 hours so it was on the thick side. It was absolutely outstanding and I am a bit of a chili snob. I served it with Artisan bread and sour cream. Great recipe ValleyGirl!!!! Aunt Jerre has a winner on her hands!!

This was delicious. I used pork loin rather than tenderloin since that's what I had on hand. Great texture. I used a chicken bullion cube dissolved in 1/2 cup of water - I didn't add any extra salt and it was perfect. Will definitely make again!

This was very good, but I did double the spices and added garlic, diced green chiles, a can of jalepinto beans, and a bottle of beer, which all helped the flavor even more. I also drained and rinsed the black beans before adding them to the slow cooker. I will definitely make again, I appreciated how simple it was to make and the colors of the black beans, white onion and red pepper made the presentation awesome as well.**update:  made this again without the garlic and beer, used 2 cans of black beans, 1 can of jalepinto, and 1 can of S&W bean mix (can't remember if it was San Antonio or Sante Fe...). This was much better.

I thought this was really good.  I added a can of rotel tomatoes and some cayenne pepper.  I couldn't decide if I should drain the beans or not and decided not to.  Next time I will drain them.  It was a little too watery.  I used leftover pulled pork (used the kalua pig recipe for that) instead of pork tenderloin and am so happy to have a new way to use up my leftover pulled pork!  Since my pork was already cooked, I only put this in the slow cooker for about 3 hours.  I put it on high for a little while then turned it down to med-low.  Garnished with sour cream, shredded cheese, and crushed tortilla chips.

We really liked this.  At first, I was worried it wasn't going to taste good, b/c we've never made chili with anything but hamburger meat.  But this was really good.  We will definitely make this again.

Good Hearty Chili with a nice mexican flair. Wonderful taste, leaves you wanting more. Like others I added chili powder, chipotle peppers, garlic, taco seasoning, and cayenne pepper for an extra kick. I served it with green onions, sour cream, shredded cheese, and cilantro. This was wonderful. As a side I made the "Sweet Corn Cakes" recipe found on this website. YUMMY!

A very solid chili for a group, won't offend anyone. Those who want it spicier can add their own Tobasco sauce. I added garlic and a can of chili peppers, served over rice with cheese, sour cream and cilantro. I like my chili a little wetter, so used 2 cups of broth but I did not add the liquid from the black beans. For variety, I think I would add garbanzo beans, corn and chopped tomatoes. I will be making a few meals for over 100 people soon ~ I think this will be one of them!

We liked this. I followed this recipe exactly, except I swapped one can of beans for corn. The recipe didn't specify whether I should drain the beans, so I didn't. It turned out pretty good. There is a LOT of meat in this. If you want to cut costs, this can be a much less expensive recipe if you cut down a half pound of meat, and perhaps add a can of diced tomatoes. Also, others recommended using pork loin instead of tenderloin - at half the price, I might try that next time - I just wanted to stay true to the recipe this first time.

This is the best chili recipe I have ever tried! I loved it.  I used all of the ingredients listed, but only had one pound of pork tenderloin, so after it cooked for a few hours, I added some store-bought frozen beef meatballs.  I also added 1 can of hot Rotelle tomatoes. It was a bit too spicy for my son, but my daughter and I loved it. Next time, I will use the mild Rotelle so my son can enjoy it with us.

Served to the inlaws tonight for dinner and it was a hit! I followed others advice and added a can of green chilies, a minced garlic clove and frozen corn.  Shredding the pork with two forks at the end definitely thickened it up.  I also served it with the cilantro and lime rice topped it with a dollop of sour cream and shredded cheddar cheese.  Yum!

This was great!  I used pork loin (because that is what I had).  Used a lot more chicken broth than it called for (just didn't seem like enough).  Lastly, we served it with sour cream and a little cheese.  Would have been nice if I had tortilla chips too.  Thanks for the recipe!

It was soo yummy.  My husband who doesn't like beans in his chili gobbled it up.  I tool out i can of beans and replaced it with a can of corn near the end of cooking.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

This recipe was easy to put together and great on a cool fall day.  Even my picky eater had seconds.  I did add the green chilis at the end as others suggested and would consider putting in jalapenos next time.  I also will leave out the red peppers next time because they were still tough when we went to eat our chili.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I found this recipe last year and have made it more than several times. It's a fast no fail no fuss recipe. Great served over rice!

A little shredded cheese gives this dish just the little kick it needs.

Yummy! This was really good!  I used one pork tenderloin, two cans of black beans (all I had) and added a couple splashes of hot sauce at the end....so good!  Leftovers were even better!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great flavor!  I used leftover pork tenderloin.  Did not add the broth as it seemed to have enough liquid. Added diced chiles.  Very Yummy!

This recipe just seemed like it was missing something. I did add a can of beer to give it more liquid. I thought there were WAY too many beans. I also made low carb elbow noodles. Not sure if I'd take the time to make this one again.

We loved this!  I used On the Border salsa and topped it with cheese and served with chips.  Spend the money and use the pork tenderloin-it melted in our mouths!

I made this recipe for Super Bowl Sunday! I used peppercorn marinated tenderloins, doubled the recipe and followed the recipe except leaving out the oregano. I added 2 cans of ro tel tomatoes served with cheese and spit cream. It was delicious. I will definitely make it again.

Delicious! As others suggested, I used a pork roast rather than tenderloin, and that worked great. Cooked on low for 9 hours, it just fell apart. I also added a can of diced tomatoes and a can of diced green chilis. It got rave reviews at my office crockpot potluck. Thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

This is delicious and easy.  Made this for family who are Gluten Free.  One of them also avoids Cilantro so I substituted Spicy Marinara sauce for the salsa.  Everyone loved it!!!

Next time I will cut up pork in bite size pieces instead of strips.
I added about a cup of my homemade tomato juice and more canned beans (chili beans & kidney). But pretty much stuck to the recipe and it very a winner! Gonna freeze the leftovers and serve to company that is coming.

My husband really liked it!

Made this for dinner  and was happy with flavor and tenderness but adding rice weakened the taste and my sauce did not thicken.  Did get a family review of "you can make that again" and asked for lunch leftovers.  It was done at 8 hours but left it in  for another hour while I  toasted some thin whole wheat  sandwich rounds (orowheat) cut into 4ths and spread with fresh avocado mash.  Second day was thicker.

I followed the directions exactly excluding one can of beans and i did drain and rinse the cans i used. That's A LOT of beans. It was ok. It's a very rustic tasting chili, like what you'd imagine in a kettle over an open fire. Smoky and quite salty although the recipe calls for zero salt. It's not soupy so I topped it off with Monterey jack cheese and sour cream and ate with blue corn chips. Wasn't bad but i probably will not make it again. I'm extremely picky with chili though. If you like a very easy rustic style chili then yes, I'd recommend this.

I am definitely not a black bean eater however this dish was tasty! next time I will definitely add a thickening agent to make it less soupy and more of a chili / stew.

Nice and simple.  I couldn't find my pepper flakes so just added extra chili powder and some other pepper powder.  I like hot and spicy.

Very tasty and easy to make. I would add more beans next time. I agree the base comes out a little thin but it didn't bother us, worked out great with some sour cream, crumbled tortilla chips and shredded cheese.

This was a very good recipe. It did not say to drain the black beans, so I didn't and I put a whole can of chicken broth in instead of a 1/2 cup. I will definitely make this again, but I will add celery and a can or two of chopped stewed tomatoes. If you like black beans I recommend making this. Very easy and tasty.

Made this chili exactly as directed except I used a pork loin roast as others suggested.  To us, it was very bland.  Perhaps using chili beans in gravy instead of black beans would help.  Also the addition of jalapenos, garlic, and additional cumin, chili powder and onion would kick it up, but then It's getting to be a whole different recipe.

Super nice variation on the standard chili. The shredded pork is a really nice touch. I tossed in a little cinnamon just because. Highly recommended! Thank you Aunt Jerre.

I added a full Tablespoon of Chili powder. Otherwise followed the recipe. I used mild salsa because I like mild. Easy for my husband to add some hot sauce & we both had it the way we like it.  Will make it again probably for Super Bowl Sunday & have some friends over.

This is the best chili recipe ever! I forgot to put this recipe in the slow cooker, so cooked it on the stove.  I also browned the pork with garlic salt and pepper in the flour. So tasty!

Like others, I added the beer, garlic, Mexican seasoning blend. I didn't have salsa so I used a can of diced tomatoes. Didn't use the adobo sauce to keep it mild for the kids. Smelled great all day. Served over rice. It's a keeper!

I used 1 can of black beans and 2 cans of chili beans. I also added 1 can of diced tomatoes. I’d add a little more chili powder. Chili was good and very easy to make!

Easy, quick to assemble,   and delicious !!! I added a can of corn which gave it a little more color and sweetness.  I also added quick cooking barley to thicken it up.
Love it!!!

We loved this chili.  I wanted to have everything ready to put into slow cooker very early in the AM before work so I cut meat up the night before and mixed in with salsa,  onion and peppers, and spices, and placed in refrigerator..  In the morning I put everything in cooker with 2 cans of black beans. I was concerned because of some comments about to many beans. When I came home from work, I added another can of beans and some jalapeños and cooked for a couple more hours.Meat shredded beautifully. So easy. I willl definitely make again. Total cook time was  about 8 hrs.

Good but on the bland side, I did increase some of the spices and used a nice porter instead of chicken broth, but still not enough flavor. Will make again, but am going to kick up the spices.. but less cummin, more chili, probably an adobo canned jalepeno or 2, maybe some dried ancho chillies ground into powder...

I made this yesterday with just a few changes. As suggested by another reviewer, I used a pork loin. I used 2 cans of beans as that’s all I had. No cumin, not a fan. Added garlic and a bay leaf, and some fresh ground black pepper. Delicious. At the end it was a little too watery so I added a small can of tomato paste. I will make this again. So easy.

Easy to make. Hold shredding until the end of  time ssthe meat tends to dry out 
Sour cream was best condiment I found  for this. 
To spice up or down use the  varieties of  salsas, but you can make it bland to cover everyone, and set out the options for fire eaters as well as little lambs

This is an absolutely fabulous dish!  I added two types of mild peppers plus fresh garlic, cilantro and parsley and slow cooked it for only 3.5 hours to achieve a thickness proper for serving over rice. This is the type of recipe that opens up to many individual flavors and seasonings.  I look forward to experimenting in the future!

TBH, it was watery and pretty bland. Not that it can't be good but I like spicy food so jalapenos, sriracha, etc., made it work for me. This recipe has the potential to be great again.

If possible, I make recipes as written, and I did so with this one. I'm skeptical of slow cooker dishes that have no precooking, but I just dumped everything in and 8 hrs later, it was done and tasted great. I served it over brown rice and garnished it with a bit of cheese and sour cream. It was a big hit with the whole family. Will be making this again!

Family loved it. Added leftover grilled chicken, and beef flank from last nights bbq. Added a corona beer. Will serve with white rice. Our split house of mexican/Cuban it served both. Kids loved the sauce.  May add some tomato paste later to give more thicker texture. Will turn leftovers into burritos tomorrow.

This recipe was so easy! We used approximately 6 cups of soaked black beans instead of canned beans. We doubled the seasonings, and added a can of green chilies.  It’s definitely been added to our monthly rotation.

This was delicious! The only change I would make is to sauté the peppers and onions first so they're not as crunchy.

I usually make my chili with ground beef and turkey, so I tried this, because I had a pork tenderloin, and it was easy. Wow!  Great!   I did not deviate from the recipe at all.  I often get pork tenderloin from Costco and was looking for a different way to use it.  I'm impressed with how easy it is and how excellent it turns out.  I used two forks to shred the pork when it was done and it thickened up nicely as the recipe stated.  You can vary the spiciness  by using different types of salsa.  Next time I may try throwing in pinto and/or kidney beans just for some variety, but the black beans were good.  It's super easy to combine the ingredients in the crock pot in the morning, and you have a tasty hot meal when you get home.

Excellent recipe!  I did double the meat because we like our chili meaty, so I doubled the spices too.  Also added green chili’s as some suggested.  Will definitely make again.

I followed the advice of one reviewer whose husband was a chef. He recommended a loin and I'm glad I did because I was able to shred it keeping it in the crockpot. So tender! No reason to try a different cut of meat. I did 1 can of black, 1 can of kidney and I kind of wish I'd stayed with black or instead of kidney, chili or pinto. I liked how I dumped everything and when I got home it was done. Perfect slow cooker recipe! The second time I made it it wasn't as good. I served it over baked potatoes to make it more bearable. Maybe the salsa makes or breaks it.

This was very good and a family hit.  It smelled spicy but was not , which is fine for me and my daughter, but my husband and son added some hot sauce to it.  I used mild salsa, but that was the only change I made.  Easy to put together and make!

Loved this chili! Used 4 pork loins which I forgot to chop up but no need as they literally fell apart when finished cooking. Upped spices as suggested (2 tsp cumin, 1/2 cup fresh cilantro near end of cooking time). I didn't have an onion so left that out and added 2 cloves garlic. Also subbed 1 cup dried black turtle beans for the canned and added 1 can kidney beans and chopped tomatoes instead of the salsa. The flavor was great and oregano worked surprisingly well! Next time may add some corn.

I made this recipe exactly as listed. I did use a medium salsa that was pretty spicy, so the chili itself had a little bite to it. I served it with a sprinkle of cheddar cheese and a dollop of sour cream. Everyone in my family loved it.

I used close to 3 lbs. of pork loin roast. I only increased the dry seasonings to 1.5 tsp. for each tsp. called for. I kept the wet ingredients the same, and would not have wanted to increase the liquid.  I used green salsa, and the flavor was excellent. I did add some cilantro towards the very end of the cooking time. We served this over rice, but I did have hard rolls as well as corn tortillas, and corn chips for those that wanted to experiment. The men loved it on the hard rolls. I enjoyed it over rice. We had leftovers and I am looking forward to lunch:-)

This seems like a decent recipe base, but it's a bit watery and bland. I'll probably start with this recipe again, but I think I'll add a few different types of beans and a bunch of BBQ sauce to give it some more body.

Easy prep and delicious! I made it twice in past week. Even the very picky grandsons eat it.  I did put a little more chili powder to spice it up and used a medium hot salsa.

The kids were coming to dinner & we didn't want to cook our pork on the grill in the rain.  I found this recipe and thought it would be good on a rainy day!  I will definitely make this chili again.  The pork was so tender and the flavor was awesome!! We all loved it over brown rice with cheese & sour cream topping!!

Awesome recipe. I added a habanero (seeded and chopped) fresh garlic, double the cumin and chili powder, added crushed red pepper and smoked salt. also used herdez salsa Verde and chopped up a couple tomatillos to throw in there. added the pork in large chunks and then shredded just before serving. Served with cheese, Greek yogurt, and avocado. Super delicious!

Delicious!  I used pork loin instead of tenderloin, and the pork was very tender.  Will definitely make this again!  Also, had to cook it on high, because of time constraints and it turned out great!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

My family doesn't like "spicy" foods but they loved this and I put Tabasco on mine. Used pork shoulder and shredded with two forks. Added a can of corn (drained) but could have used frozen. Did not rinse the beans. Will make again.

This was phenomenal! Because I like spicy I added two fresh minced jalapeños and increased the ground cumin, chili powder, paprika to two tablespoons each. Only thing I would change is draining the black bean cans a bit, as it could stand to be slightly thicker.  Very important to use pork tenderloin, and the whole ten hours. The meat simply shreds itself.  Will definitely make again.

Used a just under 1 lb. tenderloin.  Thawed it slightly in microwave and cut it into 2" pieces.  Only used 2 cans beans, 1 black and 1 kidney (drained and rinsed them both).  Didn't use any broth.  Used 1 can diced tomatoes and only about 1 C. salsa.  Used seasonings called for in recipe, could have used a little more as I used low or no salt items.  Cooked it on high for around 45 min. and then on low for 9 1/2 hrs.  It was very good.  Pork shredded easily and it was just the right thickness.  Served it over brown rice.

Outstanding! Made this with leftover smoked pork loin and it was heavenly! Topped it with shredded cheddar cheese, sour cream and diced homegrown jalapeños! I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe! I made a double batch and I'm sure it'll be gone soon. I'll be making this again! As other reviewers have said, do NOT drain the black beans.

This recipe was the best chili recipe I've made so far. You could put it over rice or serve it with toast or even naan bread.

I read the reviews about it being too watery because of the half cup of chicken broth so instead i added a quarter cup of chicken broth and it was perfect! It had the right amount of spice and the black beans were scrumptious.

I ended up using the pork tenderloin and splitting it up after cooked and it was almost like pulled pork the way it came apart. Again, perfect!

Recommend to any chili lovers out there!

It was very good.  I seasoned the pork with seasoning salt, garlic powder and onion powder.  I did everything else as instructed and made cilantro rice for it.  I also did not drain the beans.  everyone like it.

I used a pork roast and added corn and a half beer.  I found it a little bland. I added salt and a little hot sauce and that helped.  I did use low sodium black beans  which may be a mistake. Still it was easy and the family scarfed it down.

This was a big hit, will absolutely make again!! This is what I did: I used a bag of dried black beans, soaked them in water overnight. Then in the morning I drained them, threw them in a dutch oven with all other ingredients. I used a 32 oz. Box of chicken broth (instead of the 2 cups) and also added a small can of tomato paste and 3 cloves of chopped garlic. I am currently without crockpot, so I put my Dutch oven into the oven, set at 250 and let it go for about 5 hours...omg, so good and the house spelled incredible. Perfect meal on a cold rainy new england day, after an evening of kids playing baseball. The meat was so tender, and I did not brown it or anything. Thank you so much for this perfect meal!

Delicious and easy dinner. I don't know, however, that I can call it chili. We had a bowl of it tonight, but I think the leftovers will be over cilantro rice, as a burrito or possibly nachos. Whatever you want to call it though, it was great. I'm guessing leftovers will get even better.

DELICIOUS!!! The only changes I made were minor: the canned black beans were already seasoned; I threw in a few garlic cloves; and I used beer in place of chicken stock.  The pork was some already-cooked butt roast I had in the freezer which I thawed before using.  I can't wait to make this again!

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I will be making it again.  I followed the recipe with the following changes:  I did not drain the beans and used 2 cans black bean and 1 can pinto bean. I used pace picante hot salsa.  I doubled the chili powder and added about a cup of chopped New Mexico hatch chili.  I served it in a bowl with shredded cheddar, a dollop of sour cream, chopped fresh cilantro, and barely crushed tortilla chips on top.  Muy bueno!  And so easy!

Wow, great, easy recipe. I had all the ingredients, but no time to cook. With all the thumbs up I was hoping this would be my dinner solution.  I followed the recipe exactly and we enjoyed every bite. The best part is you can make this as spicy or mild as you like by changing the "heat" of the salsa. Thanks for a great recipe!

Fabulous flavors in this chili and it's so quickly "tossed" together.  I didn't use the pre-made salsa, but instead added fresh diced jalapenos  and a can of fire roasted tomatoes. Other changes include garlic, a pinch of cayenne, about a 1/2 tsp of fresh orange zest, and two cans of kidney beans, one can of pinto beans (instead of black beans). Wow, thanks for sharing this one, Sally/Jerre.

This was the best chili we have ever made, and we have tried lots of recipes!! This will become a staple in our house, especially for the colder months! My husband and I agree, it is really good served over rice, it seems to complete the meal and balance the texture of the chili. It would probably be good over tortilla chips too.

I thought this dish was bland, and I'm not one who likes a lot of spice. If I decide to make this again, I would definitely add some green chilies and add a lot more chili powder and/or hot sauce.

My family, including kids, really liked this.  I used a mild salsa and found I personally would have liked more spice, but it was perfect for children.  You could easily increase the heat with a different salsa. I did not drain beans and it was soupy so served over rice.  I didn't even add the broth. I added 1 can of mild chiles and some garlic, per other suggestions.  Will definitely make again.

Delicious.  I took some commenters suggestions and used a loin roast and added a bottle of beer.  I didn't drain the beans and because of all the extra liquid, I skipped the chicken broth and just threw in a chicken broullion cube.  Also added minced garlic, cayenne and a couple pieces of crumbled bacon leftover from breakfast.  We make a lot of chili in my house and my husband says this one is the best!

Loved this recipe!  Doubled the meat and used HOT Pace picante sauce and then followed recipe exactly.  It had a great kick and I wouldn't change a thing!   Can't wait to make it again.

We used mango lime salsa Hot Mexican-style Chili Powder.  Also added a can of green chilis.  So easy and so good!  I assembled it in less than 15 minutes before I left for work and came home to a wonderful aroma and great meal.  Served with Chipotle Copycat Cilantro/Lime rice.

OK this recipe is ridiculously good.  The kind of slow cook that you have to "taste check" every 10 mins or so.  Great base for other things...tonight I'm putting it on rice.

This was wonderful...I am on a special diet, with intake of 100 calories/meal (5 times a day)...I loved this.  Actually my whole family loved it...the flavor was wonderful.  I did use tenderloin, calorie count was lower, and since my son doesn't like peppers (substituted chopped celery...for fiber and fill).  My brother came back for seconds.

note: for everyone else I made packaged Mexican rice...for me, just this chili was enough.  Added garlic powder(my favorite flavoring)

I've made this countless times over the years, both exactly as directed and with changes, and it always comes out great. It's a brilliant base recipe. If you don't have salsa on hand, a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles and a can of tomato sauce substitutes nicely. Pintos or red beans work well, green pepper instead of red pepper, add garlic or lime. If you don't have enough time to cook on low, four hours on high works well also.  One of my family's favorites.

Not that bad, but not as good as I expected. Could have been salsa I chose (just *regular* medium hot CasaRosa). Others thought it was *pretty good*. Actually worked out better the next day ... warmed up the leftovers, but thinned it down with an extra cup of chicken broth so that it was more like a soup. Served it with hearty bread and a salad.

This is really good.  Used 3lb pork loin.  Seasoned some flour, dredged the meat and browned before added to the slow cooker.  I also sauteed the onions.  Used one green and one red pepper.  Two cans of black bean, one can each of red kidney and cannelli beans.  Used same amount of salsa and upped the chicken broth to 1 cup.  Put in one can of green chilies, and used suggested seasoning.  The pork shredded beautifully.  May add a bit more seasoning next time.  So tasty and perfect for a chilly New York night.  Will make again.

This was amazing!! I did substitute a can of corn for one of the black beans because I love corn in my chili:) and had fresh cilantro, shredded cheese and sour cream for garnish. This was such a hit with my hubby he asked me to make it to take on his annual hunting trip! Very high praise for him:D

this was very easy, and very good. my fiancee asked that i make it to keep on hand so he can take to lunch everyday! the only thing i would do is shredd up the pork instead of keeping it in cubes, so when i make it again, i will add an entire tenderloin, then remove it, shredd it, and the mix it back in. but this is a super yummy change to ordinary chili.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  I think the next time I will make some slight altercations that will make this a five star recipe.  I will cut my pepper and onion into smaller pieces the next time (just a personal preference it doesn't alter the taste)  I will also add salt and pepper.  I thought it was a little flat without it.  I think adding a jalapeño would also be a nice touch.  This was easy to do and fairly economical.  I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing Valley Girl.

This recipe was a hit!! I cooked this for a big crowd of people on a camping trip.  There were people in all age groups and everyone loved it!! I made a few changes... I had to increase the recipe to serve 12 so keep that in mind. I used two cans of black beans and one of spicy chili beans. I also used a medium salsa for an extra kick. I also added a can of corn. I crushed up tortilla chips into the bottom of each bowl, put the chili on top of that, and then topped it with sour cream and shredded cheese. I am going to make this for our anual super bowl party!!

Delicious! I did use other reviewers' suggestions of using pork loin instead of tenderloin, adding chopped garlic, three chopped chipotle peppers in adobo sauce and a can of green chiles.   Perfect for a cold night.

This was Awesome!!  I used 2 can black beans and 1 can black beans and jalepeno.  Then the salsa was chipolte habanero.  It had a kick to it but with sour cream and cheese it was just perfect.  I like my chili thicker so I just turned up the heat at the end and used a little cornstarch to thicken it up.  My two boys ate it all up, I'm lucky I got a bowl.  Will make again!  Thanks

This is why I love this website!  This is a recipe I never would have made based on the ingredients, but I search for recipes that have high ratings and this one came up during a search, so I thought...I'll give it a try.  Wow! We had this last night and it was wonderful.  I browned the pork tenderloin first (covered it with flour, garlic powder, black pepper - then browned in butter) before adding it to the slow cooker.  The only other change I made was to add a can of Rotel diced tomatoes with green chiles.  Totally awesome and so simple.  Served with rice, a dollop of sour cream, and Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread from this site (also awesome). Thanks a bunch!

We LOVED this recipe.  I added a can of diced green chilis, but otherwise followed the directions exactly.  It was super easy to throw together before heading to the office and ready when we got home.  I can see us using this recipe often now that it's getting chili... oops, CHILLY out.  LOL

This is the BEST slowcooker chili recipe you will taste. I use "fire roasted" salsa, and I have made this chili twice: once with chunks of beef and last night with ground turkey. It was fantastic both times.

Even the kids ate it!  I did not rinse the beans - I think the natural thickening agents from that liquid helped with consistency.  The pork was wonderfully tender - as I thnk I cut the peices to small to begin with there was not much shredding involved. I misread the ingredients and added 2T of chili powder...but it made no difference - this will be great as leftovers on nachos tonight!

In our house when I try a new recipe they are either one timers or keepers.  This one is definitely a keeper.  My husband and I loved it.  It didn't say whether to drain the black beans or not, so I didn't.  It was just the right consistency. Not too spicy, just right.

An excellent change-up from regular ground beef chili. Easy to prepare and great tasting. We will definitely make this again.

We had this tonight---Fabulous!  Great fall/winter meal.   I used black & red beans to mix it up, added the canned chili's & used pork tenderloin---I cooked the tenderloin whole in the crock all day then an hour before serving pulled it all apart, like pulled pork, it was awesome.  This is a keeper and will become a regular.  A+

This recipe was easy to make and tasted great.  I made only a few small changes-used two cans of black beans and one can of chili beans (although I think in retrospect it would have tasted just fine with black beans only) and then we added some sour cream and mild cheddar cheese to garnish and it tasted great!  We loved it!

I used my husbands last bottle of beer (Amberbach) to make this and luckily he loved it.  He even joked that he "stocked up" for next time I wanted to make this.  I used a green pepper instead of red because that's what I had, and I topped it with mexican blend cheese.  Yum!

Excellent recipe I limited the spice for my kids and it was still flavorsome.  For adults, I added canned green chilis and hald the chili powder  - yum!

This was very, very good but we all agreed there was something missing.  The meat in this chili was wonderful. Followed the recipe exactly except added 2 cloves chopped garlic. Topped with sour cream and cheddar cheese. Will definitely make this again and will probably add green chilies as other reviewers suggested.

My family loved this chili!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I chose a cheaper cut of pork (shoulder).  It was easy, delicious, and it tasted even better as leftovers.  Thank you!

I made this recipe with deer tenderloin instead of the pork.  It was fantastic!  The only change I made was adding a can of green chiles.  Anyone who is a wild game lover should definately try this the next time they want to do something different.
