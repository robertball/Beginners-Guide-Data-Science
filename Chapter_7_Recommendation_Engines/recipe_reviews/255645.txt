This gravy is super simple to make, and very tasty.  I served it with turkey  meatballs and mashed potatoes.  True comfort food!

So easy and made the last minute rush to get everything on the table much less stressful. Thanks for sharing. This gravy base will be a part of our Thanksgiving from now on.
