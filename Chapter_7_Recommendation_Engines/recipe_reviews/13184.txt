I had only had Cream of Cauliflower soup once in my life about seven years ago in Scotland.  It was so delicious and I bragged about it for years.  Since we are growing fresh cauliflower in our garden, my husband suggested I try to make some.  Not only was it simple, but out of this world.  Should you happen to get ahold of some home grown cauliflower, that is definitely the way to go.  Our neighbors said they've never had anything like it and bragged for hours.  I don't cook with unsalted butter, so, I used salted which didn't seem to hurt it.  I, too, used extra cauliflower and I did not use the cheese...didn't need it.  :)

We found this to be wonderful with fresh local autumn cauliflower. Did not puree it much the second time...just used a potato masher in the pot a little bit. We liked the texture. Instead of Swiss, I used a cheddar with garlic, just because it's what I had, very successfully. Kids liked it, too!!

Omitted the milk and cream.  Instead, used 4 oz cream cheese.  I also did not use swiss cheese on top.  Very gourmet tasting.

This is the most flavourful Cauliflower soup recipe I have ever made. Much better than Joy of Cooking, which I usually make. Changes? Only had 1/2 cup of white wine,and only used 1 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese and it didn't seem to hurt the end result at all. This soup rocks.Thank you Holly ...

This was very nice. The wine gave it a good taste, but I felt it needed more spices so I added more tarragon and some garlic salt, too. It came out a little thin even though I used cheese which thickened it some. It was overall nice though, will make again.

UPDATE: This is my second time making this soup and this time I doubled the amount of cauliflower and it came out nice and thick. Mmmm...

Very Good.  I scaled down the milk/whipping cream liquid to 1 c. half & half for the right consistency for me. My opinion is that another c. would have made the soup too watery.  Start off with half and add to your liking.

I followed the recipe exactly and when it was finished and I tasted it I was about to give it 2 stars for INCREDIBLE BLANDNESS.  I wasn't serving it that day and the next day when I tried it - the soup was delicious. I would suggest that you purchase the Largest cauliflower that you can find since the 8 cups of liquid that it calls for can over power the taste of the vegetables.  Thank you submitter - it is freezing outside today and I can't wait to go home and have some more soup!!!

This soup has a great base that worked beautifully.  The grown-ups enjoyed the soup, but the flavor I ended up with was definitely not kid-friendly.  I made the following adjustments: 2 leeks and no onion; used half-and-half instead of cream/ did not steam the cauliflower and just added it raw to cook in the broth; served with chedder cheese as a garnish.  I loved it!  The result was a rich, yummy, and unexpected cream soup.

Next time, I think I'll keep the leeks, cut back on the milk, make sure my wine is really dry, use swiss cheese and garnish with hot pepper for those that want more flavor.

Thanks for inspiring me to put my least favorite veggies to good use!

I would rate this soup a 3.5.  It seemed to be lacking some flavor.  I needed to add a bunch of salt and some extra sharp cheddar to add flavor.  I think next time I will use salted butter, add some garlic and crushed red pepper with the onions.  I will also caramelize the onions for added depth.  I'm not sure how this will mix with the thyme and tarragon but it seems to be lacking a bolder flavor.  If these modifications don't work I will try some fresh basil.  And definitely puree all of the soup, otherwise the whole vegetables are left lacking for flavor.  This is a great start to a potentially superb soup.  Oh, and definitely cut down on the liquid.  I cut the broth down to 4 cups and didn't steam the cauliflower ahead of time but let it soften in the broth to keep the flavor in the soup base and not left in a steamer.  I also used all cream hoping this would bolden the flavor.

This was very tasty.  Did not add the cheese. It seemed rich enough without it.  Also, used less chicken broth than called for because it seemed like alot for the amount of cauliflower.

This was really good.  The only thing I did different was not putting any white wine in the soup, I didn't have any.  I also did not use cheese.  It was really good without it.  I did puree most of it, but left some very small pieces of cauliflower.
Will make this again!

I am making a return trip to Italy in just two short months and would like to "lose a few" before then.  I am focused on finding recipes that are rich in flavor but low in carbs - this was perfect. It's just a beautiful and delicious first course soup, elegant in its simplicity!  I didn't use any cheese at all (the soup was very good without it) and wonder if the flour was even necessary as I believe this would have been plenty thick and creamy without it. This is velvety smooth and mildly but pleasantly flavored.  I finished each serving with a sprinkling of chopped green onion and a drizzle of white truffle oil, which took this over the top.

This is an excellent soup.  My husband loved it.  I made a few minor changes:  I used 1 stick of reduced fat butter and substituted 2 cups of skim milk for the milk/whipping cream.  I grated the carrot insteading of chopping to make sure it would cook fully.  I also reduced wine to 1/4 cup.  I did not add tarragon or thyme, but seasoned with 1 1/2 teas. salt & fresh ground pepper. I used two 16 oz packages of frozen cauliflower (cooked & mashed) instead of fresh.   I was reluctant to try the Swiss cheese, but it was absolutely wonderful in this soup.

Really delicious and not as heavy as it may seem.  WIth the cheese added, it's even better.  But watch out, the recipe makes a huge amount, literally, 12 servings for 12 hungry people.

So, I had this gorgeous head of cauliflower, it's fall, so, I wanted to try soup.  I looked around and got a general idea of what I wanted to try and thought this recipe sounded tasty.  I didn't have leeks, so just used an onion, used salted butter, and garlic. Always garlic! Instead of steaming the cauliflower, I roasted it with a drizzle of olive oil, salt and pepper, until nearing tenderness in the oven around 425.  I added just a bit of water and covered with foil to steam. I don't think anything tastes better than roasted or grilled veggies with that combo, and I thought it might make this more flavorful which I needed since I didn't have tarragon on hand and just used what little fresh thyme I had.  Also no cream or white pepper, just added a bit of milk after I pureed the soup and a small amount of cheddar and parm.  My husband mentioned several times how good it was and I agreed. Very nice flavor, rich, but still subtle. Will make again.

This is a good and delicious soup with mild flavour, but I think it is essential to use all the ingredients listed, otherwise the soup can be a little bland. Leek, carrot, wine, spices and cheese are essential ingredients. I would use Manchego or some other sheep cheese for this soup.

The only reason this is not rated higher is because I really did not like the tarragon/thyme seasonings.  That is probably just personal preference, but it really put me off to the point that I didn't even finish the bowl.  That said, the taste and texture of the soup without those herbs was very, very nice.  Because of some of the reviews and to save myself a shopping trip, I used 1 can of evaporated milk instead of milk and cream and about a third of the amount of swiss called for.  Evaporated milk is very nice in soups like this, but I bet it would also be good with the heavy cream.  I think the soup will be much more enjoyable with a different blend of herbs and I think I might experiment with cheddar cheese as well.  It is a good recipe that I will definitely we trying again with revisions.

Great flavor!  I used only 1 Tbl. butter, fat-free half and half instead of whipping cream, and left out the cheese to reduce the fat.  I also added some cornstarch to thicken.  Wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!

This soup was delicious-I left it a little chunky and I think next time I will use slightly less wine.  I also recommend making it ahead and letting it sit before serving as (like with most soups) it gets a lot better.  And cheese is not optional in my house....

I am hooked on this recipe! The only things I omitted was the milk and the carrot. I felt the heavy cream was enough for our taste. I doubled the recipe because I was sure that we would like it very much and I was right! The Thyme and Terragon added so much to this. I was able to use cauliflower and leeks from our veggie garden. This recipe is a keeper!!! I highly recommend it.

We loved this soup...my only tweaks were to not use tarragon (don't care for the flavor) ground some fresh nutmeg instead, and used about 1/2cup or so of the white wine (all I had left!) which I accidentally put in before the flour, so it acted more as a wonderful deglazing ingredient.  Then I added the flour.   Other than that...yummmmm :) The leftovers were even better the next day,,,you could really taste the flavor of both the leeks and wine. Thanks for the post!  Oh, I forgot...did not use the cheese, not necessary.

A nice soup.  I was hoping for something thicker - next time I'll add a touch more flour.  I used fresh thyme and omitted tarragon.  I didn't have wine on hand, so omitted that and added a bit of water to dilute the broth.  I didn't steam the cauliflower first - I added it at the same time as the broth.  I thought more of the cauliflower flavour would be retained that way.  

I am allergic to cow's milk - so I used approximately 2 tbsps goat's cream and substituted the milk for soy milk.  It turned out great and my boyfriend loved it too!

This was so delicious.  Try bleu cheese instead of swiss cheese for a unique and amazing taste.  You won't need to use very much to notice it.  Try melting in about 1/4 cup of crumbled bleu cheese and then topping the soup with additional crumbles.  Serve with oyster soup crackers - Sooo good!

I liked this recipe because it had a roux. The flavor and texture was excellent.  I used a hand blender to puree the cauliflower in the pot instead of transfering it to a food processer and making more cleanup.I skipped the cheese which I thought was unneccesary and extra calories

Easy, yummy soup.  I left out the swiss cheese and was still very pleased with the consistency.  Because I did not have thyme, I used tarragon and a blend of basil, chervil, and marjoram.

Delicious!  I followed the recipe as close as I could with what I had on hand.  I had to use frozen leeks instead of fresh, some cooking sherry as I didn't have enough white wine, and half-and-half instead of heavy cream. The cheese I didn't consider optional.  :-) Those changes apparently didn't make much difference as the soup was wonderful. This will definitely go in my fall/winter meal rotation.  Thanks for submitting, MARBALET!

This an amazing base for a great cream of cauliflower!! I like a thicker, creamier consistency. So my first try I only added 4 cups of veggie stock, half an onion, a few pinches of salt and garlic salt, and 1 1/2 cups of swiss cheese as I had a medium/small head of cauliflower. Next time I'll adjust the amount of veggie stock to the size/amount of cauliflower and add fresh garlic instead. Otherwise a very yummy cream of cauliflower soup!! Will definitely be a fall/winter staple. The swiss cheese definitely added a nice touch.

Packed with full volume flavour! I was so proud of myself (I'm not an expert soup maker!). Here is what I changed: I didn't have tarragon, so I used thyme, oregano, and some "veg-it" salt replacer thing. White pepper can't be bought here, so I used black. I more than doubled the carrots. I used mostly homemade turkey stock instead of chicken. In the end I didn't add the milk or cheese, just a few dollops of creme fraiche.  I will absolutely make this soup again (and next time double the recipe) -- it is my new favourite! I pureed it, but I think it could have be left chunky and even without the creme fraiche.

This is divine! I doubled the recipe but omitted leeks, onion, tarragon, cream and cheese.  I used 3 carrots, lemon zest, and only 3 TB. of light butter.  I also used 1 cup skim milk and 1 cup fat free half and half.  Only used 6 cups of chicken stock in total.  I froze leftovers yesterday and am eating it again tonight b/c it was so good and really healthy!

I was hoping this recipe would get pretty close to some cream of cauliflower soup I had at a restaurant recently.  It was good, but still needs a little... something to be like the one I had.  I'll keep tweaking!

So so yummy! I had to change things up a bit only because I thought that I had some if the ingredients but after starting dinner, I found out I was missing some things. I used celery instead of leeks and substituted sage and poultry seasoning for terragon. I am going to make sure that I have the proper ingredients next time I make it...because I will definitely be making this soup again and again!!! Yummy!

I was not very impressed with this soup. I did everything except for add the flour and milk at the end. It was good, but nothing amazing. I will not make this again as I think there are better methods for preparing cauliflower.

This is an excellent recipe. Two tips: use a dry white wine and forget the milk and cream. The key is in the seasonings. I used a parmesan and romano cheese  and herb seasoning. Turned out great.

Blah! For the amount of calories in this dish, I would have expected a lot more flavor. I don't think the cheese is optional, since you need it for added depth. I'm just not impressed.

I want to give this recipe a 3.5 as per the directions and 4 with my changes.  I left out the flour to make it gluten free and reduced the liquid 3 cups and it was still a little too liquidy. Instead of 1 cup milk and 1 cup cream, I used just 1 cup half and half and it was plenty "creamy."  I used a blend of swiss and guyrere cheese- cheese definitely "makes" the soup.  Will make again- great way to use up a head of cauliflower that was starting to go bad.

Very good! The only ingredients I changed were I used 4 tbsp salted butter, 8 cups chicken broth, and 1 cup half and half cream instead of 1 cup each of milk and cream.  I prepared all up until adding cream as directed the night before. The next morning I put the pureed soup in a crock pot and added the cream then and let it sit on low all morning for a work luncheon and had shredded cheese(I used med. cheddar) available on the side. I thought no need for any other spices other than tarragon and thyme, and the wine gave it a great flavour too.

A perfectly good soup, but not quite 5 star.  The tarragon was too dominant, and although we like a variety of foods with spice, no one in our house was quite sold on this soup.

I loved this soup. Because everyone said the veggie stock was bland I used 1/2 cup of brown beer and water instead. I used an extra 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar. I didn't add any butter or milk, figured the soup would be creamy enough with just the cheddar.. The soup came out too creamy for my husband and just right for me.  I'll make it again. Great taste

i think this soup recipe is very good. i took the advice of other cookers and i cut back a cup on the chicken broth, and i put in two head of cauliflower, instead of one. also just puree just one head of caulifower, so that the soup would have some texter. i believe that it will even be better sitting in the refrigerator for a night. very good soup.

Easy to make, very flavorful.  Only thing we changed was that we pureed it all then added a 2nd head of cauliflower that was just steamed and cut up.

After following the recipe exactly (save using a mixer instead of a blender to keep a bit of texture to the soup), a pleasantly flavored soup with a nice consistency was the result; everyone who partook in the meal was pleased. I ,however, couldn't help but spending my meal asking myself what ingredient was missing in order for this to really be excellent. Today on leftovers I have tried a few different options, and unfortunatly still have not hit on it, but intend on giving this recipe a try again in order to really take it to that next level. I would say this is a solid recipe, worth being tried, and would give it 3,5 stars if I had the option.

This turned out amazing! The tarragon fits perfectly with the cauliflower and the soup feels luxiourious, even though the ingredients were pretty inexpensive. I will probably use less broth next time and pick out some chunks of the veggies to put in after pureeing the rest, for texture. But this is a definite keeper!

Absolutely 5 stars!  Wonderful flavour.  I didn't have tarragon (even dried, it is very difficult to get in South Africa) so used marjoram instead.  And I left out the cheese, which it didn't need as it was so tasty as is.  Thanks Holly - hubby loved it.

Steamed a small head of cauliflower and added the florets in with the already made creamed soup .  I also added more chicken stock for a soupier consistency.  Very flavorful soup!

My family loves this soup.  However, I added a finely chopped jalapeño pepper to my celery mix and sauted it together.  I also added Slap ya Mama spices to it.  It gives it a nice heat to it that enhances the flavors.  I also added cheddar cheese.  Instead of using cream or regular milk, I added Califa coconut milk to it.  The coconut flavor is very mild and gives it a nice taste as well as cuts down on the calories and is also healthier.  I use the Califa coconut milk and water blend which is a thicker blend than Silk and not as sweet tasting.  I also added a tsp of basil.  I have 4 picky grandchildren and they ate it up!!! I didn't puree it. We like the textures of the chopped up veggies.  I just use my cuisinart chopper to finely chop the cauliflower, celery and jalapeño pepper and then I grated my carrots.  I also added Better Than Bouillon chicken flavor to the water which added flavor.  So, this soup is full of wonderful flavors. The tarragon tops the flavors off with a richness that my family loves!!!!

Yes, I did make changes.  I didn't have leeks, so used only onions.  I left out the flour, as it looks more like a paste in the photo, not a soup.  I used vegetable stock, along with leftover potato water from cooking potatoes the day before.  Did not use heavy whipping cream, but milk only.  I also didn't use cheese.  I did add fresh garlic cloves, and celery salt.  This was a very, very flavourful soup.  I feel I avoided a lot of extra calories by leaving out the flour, whipping cream and cheese.  Just keep tasting as you make it and add whatever pleases you.  Soup recipes can be tailored to your own taste.  This soup (as I made it) was awesome.  I would definitely make it again.

EXCELLENT! This was my first time making cream of cauliflower soup and it did not disappoint. The only change I made was to only use half a cup of cream and half a cup of milk. The consistency was perfect. Not too runny, but not too thick. Go ahead and add the Swiss cheese for some extra pazazz! Great recipe if you want to impress friends and family for a dinner party! :D

Very good recipe.  My husband and I had cream of cauliflower soup at a restaurant a few months ago, and I have been looking for a recipe to make it.  This is it!!

 I omitted the tarragon and leek (because I did not have any on hand), and simmered the soup for 45 minutes instead of 30.  I omitted the milk and cream altogether because I liked the consistency and thickness of the soup without it.  I added 1/2 cup white cheddar and 2 cups parmesan instead of the swiss.  Absolutely amazing!

When reheating the soup, it might be necessary to add some cream or half and half to thin it.

Just made this soup.  I had bought a head of cauliflower and then hubby had 6 teeth pulled and cannot chew.  Rather than throw it out I happened to see the recipe and it is so good.  My changes included someone who added small diced potatoes and celery and curry and I also included small chopped 1 cup of smoked center cut chopped ham and nutmeg.  Husband loves it.  Fantastic.

Just finished enjoying it!  I made a few minor changes. I omitted the tarragon and cut the thyme in half - only because I have a very potent jar.  I also substituted an additional cup of chicken broth for the white wine because I didn't have any.  As far as the milk/cream addition, I added some cream cheese instead, as another reviewer mentioned.  It came out fabulous with some crusty home made bread.  Almost forgot, I also added a stalk of chopped celery. Didn't even need the cheese!  I'm looking forward to the leftovers for lunch tomorrow... Thank you for a delicious recipe!

If you like curry in purred soups, add it! :) Gave it a wonderful flavor. I had to make a few changes since I didn't have a few ingredients on hand. I didn't have leeks or white wine. I only added 4 cups of broth. The trick is to have your heat up high enough and not add the broth took quickly. Let the soup thicken before you add more liquid or it will be very liquify. I used "I can't believe it's not butter light" and only added a tiny bit of salt at the end. I added a celery, about six fingerling potatoes (chopped up small and threw in after the cauliflower. They cooked nicely while the whole soup simmered) and one teaspoon of curry powder. I'm sure with my additions plus the white wine and leek this soup would be even more amazing!

Wonderful flavor.  Deliteful taste!  Best soup I've made in a long, long, long time.  I followed the instructions exactly up to the addition of the milk products.  Then I added just half of the cream and milk and half cheese and it is incredible!    Highly recommend for dinner with a loaf of french or sour dough bread.

I have to say this is the first cauliflower soup I've tried to make on my own.  I tried this in a local restaurant and fell in love with it!!!  So I came upon this recipe and couldn't wait to try it.  I left out the white wine. I just added more chicken stock for more liquid.  I used skim milk since there's already cream and instead of Swiss cheese I wanted to use half cheddar and half pepper jack since that's what the restaurant uses in there cauliflower soup.  We loved this and I will be making this again soon.  It was great with whole wheat french bread to dip!!!!!  Yummmy comfort food!

I really liked this recipe, I tweaked it a bit, of course.  I didn't have any wine so I had to skip that step, I'm sure it would have been a nicer soup had I been able to add it.  I added a dash of pepper flakes for a tinsy bit of warmth and a bit more seasoning than called for, including a bay leaf.      I am wondering if it would freeze alright, considering the cheese in the soup...?

OMG - yum.  I made some substitutions too:   5 baked potatoes, peeled instead of leeks, 2-3 Tbsp cream cheese instead of heavy cream, 2 splashes cooking sherry instead of white wine. I threw in some cooked, chopped chicken breast at the end.  It would also be great with tortellini or chunky croutons.  Yum, yum.  My kids even asked for seconds.

Good recipe - just a few changes made it the best cauliflower soup I have ever eaten.  For the chicken stock, I used the College Inn Chicken stock with wine and herbs; I cut the wine down to about 1/2 cup because of the wine already in the stock and I cut the milk to 1/2 cup to decrease the volume slightly.  I increased the butter to 8 Tbsp and used 2 leeks, no onion.  I also added 2 cloves of sliced garlic and a large sprig of fresh rosemary.  I cooked the cauliflower in the broth, then pureed in the pot with immersion blender.  My final change was to thicken when the cream/milk was added rather than to make a roux at the beginning.

This is a really good recipe.  I love the combination of the tarragon, thyme and wine.  I did not puree the soup as we like a chunkier soup.  I only 1/2 cup of cream to cut down on the fat.  Instead, I added 1 1/2 c. milk and heated it on the stove and thickened it with flour.  I only gave it 4 stars because I felt there was a spice missing.  I'll definitely make it again!

Sorry, I tried to love this soup. I actually would give it 3.5 stars - 4 is pushing it - My children (13, 12, & 9) did not like it as much and rated it between 2.5-3. I will only rate something 5 star that the whole family loves & that I would make again. I did use just 1/2 c. milk + 1/2 c. half & half, half of an onion & half of the swiss cheese. I did not puree it, but mashed it in the pot for added texture (a little too much texture). It had too much wine in it, maybe too sophisticated of a flavor for my kids. If you are going to try this, consider pureeing half of the soup and using 1/4 c. wine for a more family-friendly soup.

Wow, this soup was great!  Restaurant quality.  My hubby (a self proclaimed gourmet cook)and I just loved it. I added a few dashes of Tabasco sauce for flavor and some of Penzy's spices 4/S seasoning.  I only pureed half of the cauliflower as well for some texture.  I also only used 1-1/2 cups of swiss cheese.  The only other change I will make the next time I make this is to use lowfat half & half instead of the whipping cream.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I must say I was rather disappointed I wasted so much time and ingredients on this soup. The leek/spice combination made this soup taste rather odd. Also, I did not like the result after pureeing in the blender. All traces of the cauliflower were just gone, I couldn't even taste it. Sorry, just not my idea of cream of cauliflower soup.
