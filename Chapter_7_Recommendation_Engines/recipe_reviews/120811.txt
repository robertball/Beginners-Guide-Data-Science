This was amazingly simple to put together, few ingredients, and tasted good.  I used refrigerated pizza dough (already opens up into a rectangle you just smoosh it a bit more with your hands to thin it.  I liked chopping my onion and red pepper into a glass measuring cup, adding fresh garlic, italian herbs, and a little olive oil.  Stirred it up and cooked for 90 seconds.  Easy peasy.  Used sliced american cheese instead of shredded cheddar.  I'm sure either would be fine (and thought pepper jack was a good idea that someone else had).  Used the milk wash because I didn't have any eggs.  While it was cooking, I mixed equal parts of light mayo, fat free sour cream, whole grain dijon mustard, and creamy horseradish to use as a dip.  All in all, a simple tasty meal.

Fabulous recipe!  Took the advice of a reviewer and used refrigerated french bread loaf instead of frozen bread dough...saved lots of time.  I sauteed the veggies and seasoning instead of microwaving them.  Served it with soup and my whole family loved it!

This was good but a little dry.  It needs some sort of sauce inside.  Instead of a frozen dough I made one out of bisquick mix.  2 cups bisquick mix, 1 tsp or parsley, 1 tsp dry mustard, 1/2 cup of milk.  Mix together and roll out.  Place filling on it then roll up.  Bake according to recipe.

this was excellent! We all really loved it and it was great for the kids because we place the onions and peppers on one half for me and my husband and left the other half without for my son. Thanks for a great recipe!

Very tasty!  But too salty for me.  I would use garlic powder instead of garlic salt next time.  Also, I just used a refridgerated french bread loaf instead and it saved some time and was very good!

Very tasty!!  Made this for a couple of hungry farmers, and they raved all day about it!  Here are the things I did differently--I used 1 loaf refrigerated French bread and I doubled all the veggies and added more deli roast beef (I also recommend using a high quality roast beef), additionally I added a can of mushrooms.  In a skillet with some butter, I sautéed all the veggies and then added my roast beef, put the mixture on the rolled-out bread, added some shredded cheese, and rolled up. *Note, if you are not a big roller-upper like I am, make sure you end up rolling onto the baking sheet you are going to bake on, I learned this the hard way!*  I brushed the dough with the egg wash, cut slits for the steam and sprinkled some cheese and a little Parmesan and herb seasoning.  Delicious!  Made a dipping sauce with some real mayo and A-1.  Make sure you let this sit 10-15 minutes before slicing.

YUMMMMY! I made this exactly as stated only used yellow instead of red onion and cooked red pepper and onion on stove top in some olive oil rather than in microwave. I read other reviews that said this was too salty - I didn't think so. Also that it was dry, and I didn't find that it was dry either! I used the Rhodes frozen bread and it worked perfectly. My daughter dips everything in ranch, so I tried it and it was good this way. I will make this again - easy and tasty!

**Made this a 2nd time and used different roast beef (on sale) from the deli and wish that I had tasted before purchasing because it was extremely salty! So get the good stuff and taste first!

Great recipe!  Will make this again.  You can make this even easier by using a jar of Italian pepper salad - then you don't have to cook the peppers & onions.   That's what I used. Thanks for sharing.

I used my bread machine to mix up a 2 lb. batch of whole wheat pizza dough, but I think 2 lbs. is a bit too much bread. As a diabetic, I need something with more meat and less carbs (less bread!!). This is a great recipe though and seems versatile enough to experiment with other types of fillings. DH *loved* this and made a point to tell me (2 days later!) to be sure to keep this recipe, so we'll definitely be making this again, just with less bread. :)

Really enjoyed this recipe. I made up a batch of home made french bread dough using my stand mixer (Baking Nana's personal recipe from this site - it makes just the right amount of dough needed and is a terrific recipe), formed the loaf ahead of time, and kept it refrigerated until dinner time. The only thing I would change if I made this again would be to increase the veggie part of the filling slightly, as I found it a bit skimpy, and/or I would add in some diced mushrooms. I used a simple milk wash rather than fussing with the egg white/water wash. Works just as well. Any leftovers make a great lunch for the next day. This would also lend itself to any combination of seasonings/meat/cheese. I will be referring back to this recipe often.

I'm giving hubby's rating as I'm not a fan of Italian seasoning on beef. He liked it. The bottom was extremely soggy, actually sitting in a puddle. I thought the seasoning was way too overpowering, even tho I only used 1/2 tsp.

Really good! Yep, tweaked a bit. Used pizza crust from Pillsbury. I sauteed the onions, peppers, spices, minced garlic in EVOO. Then used triple cheese blend w/ Angus beef from the deli. Brushed w/ egg wash. Baked for 20 min. sit for 7 min. Delish! Definitely a keeper. And I will play with recipe for other ideas. YUM!

This was awesome! BUT I really didn't have most of the ingredients (which shows just how versatile it is).  I took advice from others and bought the pre-made pizza dough and higher quality roast beef from the deli (it really does add salt even when it's better quality).  I didn't have anything else so I used a mixture of shredded pepperjack and cheddar cheeses, added mushrooms, spices from recipe, and giardiniera (hot peppers) to taste.  I was so pleased at how easy this was and how AWESOME it tasted. You can change this up so easily with other lunch meats....  I even thought about doing a reuben version.  I will warn that the pizza dough cracks when you take it out of the roll container and it's hard to patch so use caution : )

Very good. Husband loved it. I made it with the refrigerated pizza dough as per another reviewer since it comes out of the can just the right size. Husaband thinks it could have less cheese and more meat. I did brush with egg, but didn't use up all of the egg, and then sprinkled dough with artisan parm cheese from the shred cheese section of store and the dough was so delicious. I will definitely be experimenting with this recipe with other meats, veggies and cheeses.

I did change a few things, but only because I had the time.  I get that the recipe is for quick and easy, and I do appreciate that.  However I had time to saute, so I did.  I  only had green pepper and yellow onion, so I used that.  When I went to get the EVO out, I saw the balsamic and it said "pick me! pick me!" so I gave that a shake.  Then when I was layering everything out and I grabbed the cheese, I saw my new fav. in the frig, Lite Sweet Vidallion Onion dressing, so I gave that a few shakes after I laid down the meat and veggies. Then I topped with Italian Blend of cheese.  My roast was leftover from one night this week, so I saved some back and froze it knowing this was on the menu for today.  I didn't weigh it, but it was probably way more than 8 oz.  The only trouble I had, was that at 30 minutes I thought it looked really good, so I took it out and let it set up.  Once cut, the inside was still doughy.  I figured if I tried to put it back in as is, all the insides would ooze out.  So I decided to go ahead and slice it up and lay it out on the cookie sheet.  So that was my bad for not letting it go a little longer.  Loved the recipe.  Loved the flavors.  Loved the presentation.  Thank you for sharing.

This tasted so good and was a huge hit with all the co-workers I made it for.  I will say that the frozen dough was not the best way to go. I had a really hard time working with the dough.  So next time I will surely use the refrigerated kind or make my own.

I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. And used chopped giardiniera vegetables in place of the sweet red peppers. It was great.

Absolutely delicious!  Even my husband (who doesn't care for roast beef) loved it!  I used Rhodes frozen white bread & it was yummy!  It was not dry at all and didn't even need sauce or anything.  Next time I might add mushrooms to my section!  Yummy!!

Thanks for this recipe.  We raise our own beef so roasts are plentiful.  I simply shredded some roast beef and continued on with recipe as stated.  I also served a couple different dips...1)horseradish & whipped cream & 2) Ranch.  Very good recipe...Rhodes dough is the better choice here.  Very delicious & our guests enjoyed it...none leftover :(

Not exactly what I would consider a "quick" recipe, and I notice the prep time listed doesn't include the 90 minutes of letting the dough rise. I would make this again, as it was quite tasty (I found myself going back for seconds), but I think I might try what others suggested and getting refrigerated pizza dough to truly simplify the preparation when I want a quick lunch.

Great recipe - I couldnt' find bread dough at my grocery store so I made dough in my bread machine and it turned out great!  My husband loved it.  It's perfect with a bowl of soup on a cool fall night!

The only thing I would add is to make sure you use good quality roast beef to get the best flavor.

Found this to be rather bland. Might try again with a little pesto added.

Pretty good, I made my own dough and added a mayonnaise spread by adding mayo, Italian dressing, garlic powder and fresh ground pepper.  Topped with cheese, and braided the loaf.

Served this at a large family gathering, people with varying food preferences, all loved it! Easy to make, just remember to thaw the dough out ahead of time. Don't make too long of a slit on top of the sandwich before baking. It’s on my keeper list!

Just made this for dinner, and was surprised how easy it was. Took the tip to roll on the pan ur going to bake it on and worked beautifully. Halved the recipe, added mushrooms and a horseradish spread. Rhodes frozen dough was great, but hard to keep rolled out. Also, dont like italian seasoning, so I used chicago steak seasoning and this had such a great flavor! Would have given it 5, but only 4 since I tweaked it:)

Not bad! I thought it needed a dash more flavor--next time I will probably use real garlic versus garlic salt.

Very good.  I made my own simple bread dough and this recipe came out great.  My family loved it and it went fast!   I'll definitely be making this again as is, and will be trying other fillings as well.

It was pretty good. I'm not sure if I really liked the flavor of the frozen bread dough. So next time I might use my own. I used roasted red peppers from a jar and sauted them with the onions in a little butter instead of microwaving them. Next time I will also be more careful of the roast beef I use. I'm gonna buy better quality next time, not just what's one sale. I used provolone slices instead of cheddar cheese and it worked just fine. Instead of the egg wash I just brushed it with melted butter with some garlic powder in it. Over all I liked it though, I just wanna try it differently next time.

I think the reviewer who complained about this being dry will find it is the bisquick mixture that makes it dry.  I have tried to make runzas with bisquick and they are always dry.

I did not care for this. But would depend on the bread dough used. Mine never cooked inside, but outside was almost overdone at 23 min cooktime. For the bread I used the "White Bread For The Bread Machine" by Diana on this site. I didn't have red onions or peppers. So I used reg. onion and green peppers, also added munster cheese as well as the cheddar. Other then the undercooked bread, the Italian seasoning was way too much. I couldn't taste anything else. As is, I won't be making again. I'll have to figure something else out
