This recipe was great, with a few personalized tweaks.  I even won the chili cook-off at my job.  Some variations that I tried which were extremely successful:

1. Sautee the (red) onion with olive oil, salt and cracked pepper prior to adding it into the cooker.

2. Season your turkey as it browns with salt, cracked pepper and a little chipotle chile powder.

3. Instead of chili beans, I used Great Northern.  They really complimented the turkey, in my opinion.

4. Split your tomato portion - half regular diced, half fire roasted (as mentioned in other reviews).  

5. Add in a small can of green chiles and diced jalapenos if you're looking for a little more spice with that sweet pumpkin.

6. Canned, pureed pumpkin works just as well if you feel like being lazy (I certainly was).

7. My local store was out of pumpkin pie spice (shame on me for waiting to buy it until October) - so I used varying dashes of Cinnamon, Paprika and Cumin.

8. Use Chipotle chili powder instead of regular.  A couple tablespoons of cayenne pepper will also add some spice!

9. Season! Season! Season!  There is no mention of salt and pepper in the ingredients, so I presume it's understood.  But don't forget to SEASON the mixture!!

Finally, I created a special sour cream mixture by mixing 3 parts sour cream to 1 part pumpkin puree and added a little chipotle chile powder.  This really made the dish!

Enjoy!

My family really loved this chili.  It is very thick and hearty and has a sweet spicy flavor.  I like to prepare healthy meals for my family and am used to substituting ingredients to make them healthier but with this recipe I didn't have to change a thing! The only thing I did do differently was to use a 15 oz. can of pure pumpkin for convenience. I will be making this again!

I looked at several other pumpkin chili recipes and the ones that got 700 reviews. Every positive review had so many changes and this recipe seemed to reflect them. I made this Halloween night and it was sooo delicious.  We followed the recipe as it was listed except for these changes: canned tomatoes with diced chiles, unseasoned black beans (all I had in the pantry), and no brown sugar (I just forgot).  I had some extra canned pumpkin puree (about a cup) that I threw in (why not?) and an extra can of beans to stretch the recipe further. It was really delicious. The flavor was subtle, it was so hearty and good. We ate it with honey cornbread and sour cream. Utter perfection. We will be adding this to our chili rotation!

I'm a Texan and we love our chili HOT, so when I decided to try this recipe, I was skeptical that we would like it.  I had leftover turkey and since the weatherman was predicting ice and snow, my family wanted chili. So I searched Allrecipes and found this one with the interesting pumpkin addition. I had never heard of putting pumpkin or sweet potatoes in chili. That sounded insane. But wanting to try something new, I tried this recipe using my leftover turkey chopped up, sweet potatoes instead of pumpkin, and added more heat with jalapenos, Cajun seasoning, and chipotle chili powder. I also added a bag of frozen chopped onions and peppers and fresh cilantro. OMG! It was delicious. I had to stop my boys from eating it after 3 bowls each.  I served it with just tortilla chips, nothing more on top as some suggested.  If you are skeptical, try this and add your own flair to it. I even had to give the homemaking teacher at my school the recipe after she tried it. She was amazed at the flavor of the sweet and spicy blend. This will definitely become part of my chili rotation.

Awesome recipe!  By far the best ever chili recipe and this will become my staple. I did a little tweaking.  Here is what I did modified:  
1 Chili seasoning packet,
3 pounds of ground turkey, cooked in olive oil,
4 table spoons of brown sugar,
1 teaspoon of cinnamon,
1 can of white northern beans to replace the black beans,
2 cans of diced tomatoes with zesty mild chilies, 
1 can of Libby Pumpkin. 


Other than what I listed above, I used everything else such as the chili beans and pumpkin pie spice.   Cooked it on high for 1 hour and then low for about 4-5 hours or until hot and bubbly.

When I saw this recipe and read the reviews, I couldn't wait to try it. I love pumpkin and I love chili, but they are not meant to be put together. It tasted like I dumped a pumpkin pie into my chili. Like some other reviewers, I used a can of pumpkin instead of fresh. Maybe that makes a difference, but I doubt it.

We LOVED this chili - the picture doesn't do it justice. Full of flavor and so healthy, too. I substituted Rotel for the tomatoes, so it was extra hot. I will add half the chili powder next time.

Excellent combination of spicy and sweet! I did make a couple alterations. First, I browned the turkey with the onions and some chili powder. Second, I used a 15 oz can of pumpkin pur√©e in place of fresh pumpkin. Next, I used  two 14 oz cans of regular diced tomatoes, one small can of Rotel chili tomatoes and one 14 oz can of white beans. I also replaced the brown sugar with a little bit of agave. Cooked on low for about 3 hours and high for an hour. Came out so delicious with just enough sweet to offset the heat!

This was so delicious and very well received on a Football Sunday. Didn't think the fresh pumpkin was going to be easy to deal with but it was.

Just tried this tonight and despite husband and daughter not being enthusiastic when I said I was making turkey pumpkin chili, they ended up loving it (even my 12 year-old ).  I used a few of the suggestions from other reviewers such as using canned pumpkin (2 cups), adding a chopped jalepeno pepper, and using white kidney/cannellini beans instead of black beans.  I also added a 3rd can of beans as another review suggested, so I ened up using 1 can of chili beans and 2 cans of cannellini beans.  Other than that, I kept everything the same, including the amount of spices (though I did add salt and pepper).  My husband said he would have liked more spices, but I thought it was good as is.  I might add more jalepenos next time for a little more heat.  It was a big success and will be a part of our regular meal planning from now on.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Simply fantastic!!  Followed recipe to the letter but added 2/3 lb. Turkey Sausage, a Pumpkin Ale, can of mushrooms & 2 jalapenos for more "kick".... Came out the perfect blend of sweet & spicy!! A wonderful fall-time treat and a rather low calorie one at that!!

This is very good. It is very hearty and has a bit of sweetness to it. Ignore the photo, which makes it look disgusting, and just follow the recipe.

Great as a base recipe. I made several changes but just to tweak to my preferences. I cooked the onion & peppers in with the turkey & evoo prior to adding to crock pot. I also started the pumpkin first by adding water just to cover pumpkin chunks & set crock pot on high. Meanwhile, I cooked the turkey, onion, green pepper & seasonings (chili powder, s & p, Italian seasoning & nutmeg. Once that was cooked, I added the meat to the crock pot along with tomato sauce, crushed garlic & fresh blanched tomatoes. I also only added like a tbsp of Brown sugar (just to balance the acidity of the tomato sauce, not to sweeten). I then allowed that simmer together until pumpkin was tender then added the kidney beans, garbanzo beans & black (not chili beans). It continued to dinner on low until thickened. It came out delicious!

This is filling, easy, and fairly tasty. Like others I first sauteed the onion (and a few cloves of garlic) before browning the meat. Then I tossed everything into the crock pot, along with a sweet potato, and some salt and pepper, and cooked on high for about four hours. The final product was good but not as rich and full-bodied as I had hoped. A shake of cinnamon helped bring out the flavor. The kids almost all had doubles, and that counts for a lot.

Sweeter than I expected and not spicy, so add some more heat if you like it hot. Super delicious, eaten by my kids even! I substituted butternut squash for the pumpkin because at TJs they had pre-cubed squash, making the recipe super simple, only took about 5-10 minutes total hands on time. Will make it again!

I followed the recipe almost exactly-- including using fresh instead of canned pumpkin-- except that I couldn't fit all the beans into my slow cooker. I just don't enjoy the chill/pumpkin pie spice combination. It might be more bearable without the sugar, but I doubt I'll try the recipe again to find out.

I was hoping this would be the chili recipe that won my kids over but, sadly, it wasn't. I loved it though! It is a wonderful blend of fall flavors and the cinnamon really stands out. Next time, I may add some green chiles to kick it up a notch.

Too sweet for us! Had to add red pepper flakes, hot sauce, and more chili powder. Loved using the pumpkin but I think the pumpkin pie spice and brown sugar made it too sweet for our tastes.

As I added each ingredient to the slow cooker and did a taste test, I fell more and more in LOVE with this chilli. UNTIL I added the pumpkin pie spice. It ruined the chilli in my opinion. I will certainly make this again, but without it next time. I would suggest scooping out a bit of the chilli in a separate bowl, and adding a little of the pumpkin pie spice there to test it out first. If you love it, then great, if not, omit it. (I think the pumpkin pie spice is also the reason the most critical reviewer hated this chilli. BUT it is 5-Stars without it). 

I should also mention that instead of pumpkin, I used candied sweet potatoes the second time around and ohhhhh my goodness. It was even better! (But that's just a personal preference.)

Super awesome and I don't like even a little sweet in any of my main dishes, but I love this   with added spice. I used organic canned pumpkin, made it a little spicer, soaked and used garbanzo beans because that was all I had, used leftover diced turkey, and added some water to make it at the right consistency for us (I also had used a lot of beans and turkey so it was super thick). Not huge changes and I believe if I had made it exactly as written it would have tasted just the same, if not better.

I love pumpkin and I love a hearty, spicy chili. Sadly, the two didn't come together for me here. Chili powder by itself is not 'spicy' and needs more depth of flavor. So this was definitely sweet but didn't have the oomph I was looking for. After the fact I noticed that many reviewers added a lot of different things to get this to their taste. I hate when people give bad reviews after completely changing a recipe so I try to make it at least close to 'as written' and then doctor to my taste. I couldn't make this happen for this recipe. It had an OK flavor but was missing something. If you like sweet chili, this one will work for you.

Really liked the pumpkin flavor!  I added another tablespoon of chili powder to contrast the sweet flavors. I also added  a bag of frozen southwest vegetables ( green and red peppers , corn and more black beans ).   Easy and tasty!!

Loved the combination of the chili spice with the sweetness of the brown sugar & pumpkin.  Just added a pinch of salt to the final product & it tasted great!  Hearty, but not overwhelmingly heavy.  Just right.  :)

I made this last night and it was amazing! I seasoned the turkey with garlic and pepper before I threw it in. I also used the Rotel diced tomatoes with the green chilis in it. Cubing the pumpkin was kind of a pain, but it was so worth it. It was a big hit.

Good chili, but I will say, I tweeked this just a bit, added a few things from another Pumpkin Chili recipe. I added one yellow and one orange bell pepper and doubled the cumin and chili powder, added hot pepper flakes and a small can of green chilies. LOVED the fresh pumpkin in this recipe. Great base recipe to work with and make it your own. Thank you!

I did a few things different. 1) when browning the turkey I added a few cloves of garlic and seasoned with salt and pepper 2) I didn't have any black beans so I just doubled the kidney beans 3) I used canned pumpkin instead of fresh and 4) I used fire roasted tomatoes.  

My end product doesn't look anything like the picture -- I'm not sure what the green stuff is in the pic!

It is our favorite. I make it often and always get raves. Last Fall when fresh pumpkins were available  I bought several pumpkins and cut into required pieces and put them in plastic bags to use all year. Worked great!

Hands down one of the best chili's I have ever made. I did make a few tweaks....
1. I seasoned the turkey as I cooked it with some shallots (that I saut√©ed first before adding the turkey) and then with salt, smoked paprika, and onion powder.
2. To the chili I didn't have fresh pumpkin, so I did a can of the pumpkin puree and added two cups of diced butternut squash, and a small call of diced green chilis. I also added additional seasoning--cumin, smoked paprika, a little extra chili powder, and a dash of cayenne pepper. Oh and salt :) AND I omitted the pumpkin pie spice--I didn't want this too sweet and pie tasting.
3. I didn't have time for the slow cooker, so I did this on the stove top and let everything simmer for an hour and fifteen minutes, adding a bit of water as some of the liquid evaporated.

Seriously...so delicious. My husband agreed--best chili yet!

This was DELICIOUS!!  Took some of the suggestions...saut√©ed the onions with the turkey, and added all the seasonings to the meat and onion mixture prior to putting them in the crock pot.  Used one can plain diced tomatoes and one can fire roasted.  Used a large can of plain pumpkin, but reserved a half cup to make the yummy sour cream topping for the chili as suggested by the same reviewer.  My own finishing touch....chopped cilantro on top just before serving.  It was AWESOME!!  I will DEFINITELY make this again!!

This is very yummy! I made it nearly as written except my crockpot wasn't working so I simmered it stovetop, substituted great Northern beans for the chili beans, and butternut squash for the pumpkin (too lazy to cube pumpkin and you can buy prechopped butternut squash). It was delicious and my whole family loved it. I served it with corn muffins and it is a satisfying healthy Fall meal!

Wonderful recipe, I won second place at the local Chili cook-off. I make it all the time, the family loves it.  Last time I made it I tripled the recipe and didn't have any left overs.  It's what I make when my daughter comes home from college. Love it!

Saut√©ed a red onion before cooking the turkey.  Added about 1 tsp. of salt to the chili and used only 2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice.  Any more and it would have been too sweet.  May also cut back on the brown sugar next time.  Used canned pur√©ed pumpkin for ease.  Used white  beans instead of kidney.  Good recipe and very easy!

Very good recipe!!! I used a few different ingredients! I used a bit of paprika, cream cheese, peppercorn and rotel instead of regular diced tomatoes. It wasnt a bad idea to add about a 1/4 cup of water. I also 86ed the brown sugar, the pumpkin added just enough sweet to make a sweet and salty combination that was to die for. This one is definitely getting added to my weekly makings!! Oh and instead of using cubed pumpkin i used puree and it was awesome!!   5 stars!!

I really liked the pumpkin in this chili, but I found the pumpkin pie spices to be too much.  It was more sweet than I would have liked.  My son wouldn't eat it.

Loved the sweet and slightly spicy combo.  I used canned pumpkin instead of fresh, and substituted Rotel for the tomatoes.  I thought it tasted better reheated.

Used a ~2.5 cups of sweet potatoes plus 1/2 can of pumpkin puree and used 2 cans of kidney beans instead just because that is what I had. Also cut the sugar in half, tasted sweet but not too sweet.

Served with cheese and sour cream, thought it was very good especially as a change to normal chili

I‚Äôve now made it twice the second time I dbld the recipe copied it exactly then tweaked it along the way.  I baked and pur√©ed the remainder of my Pumpkin and added it along with the cubed. Salt pepper more pumpkin spice more chili powder more sugar a lil cayenne when it was a bit too watery I mixed in some gluten free baking pancake mix to thicken it.   Well I wasn‚Äôt sure at first but I always found the way to taste a chili is day two!  Everyone loved it.    Served to with tortilla chips and sour cream.   We needed gluten free for this occasion.

I made this for my Halloween Party years ago! Instead of using cut up chunks of pumpkin, I used Pumpkin puree.  I topped it off with mexican cheese blend of shredded cheese and served corn bread wirh it.  It was such a hit, I made it again for a dinner party.  I was short on funds, so I used Pumpkin Pie Filling since I didn't have the pumpkin pie spices.   It actually tasted better.  I had zero leftovers.  And for both occasions,  I used two slow cookers.  I'm so glad this recipe is still around!  I plan on making it for a third time this Halloween season 2019!  I'm definitely writing it down this time, just in case.

This ended up tasting like barbecue sauce, and therefore, like baked beans more than chili. I had halved the brown sugar,  but wish I'd left it out entirely- the pumpkin and pumpkin pie spice already give enough sweetness (or the illusion thereof). 2 stars for taste but 4 for healthfulness.

Am making this for the second time. Made no changes from original recipe either time. I think jalape√±os would be a good addition, but both times I‚Äôve made it was for youngsters. It‚Äôs delicious as is, but I think can be easily enhanced to your own tastes.

I also dislike it when someone completely changes a recipe then gives it a low rating.  That being said, I like to read how others have ‚Äútweaked‚Äù a recipe.  This is what I did different, I cooked it on the stove because I started it late. I took advice from another reviewer and used great northern beans instead because I dislike chili beans, and I I used regular black beans because that‚Äôs what I had on hand. I used 2# ground turkey and I also started with 1/2 tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice and 1 tablespoon brown sugar and 1/2 tablespoon chili powder. Those amounts ended up being perfect for me. I cooked my onion in olive oil, then added the ground turkey. After browning the turkey, I added the remaining ingredients. We like things spicy so I used 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes and 1 can of diced tomatoes with jalape√±os. I also par boiled the pumpkin because I was afraid it wouldn‚Äôt be cooked in time. My boyfriend, who didn‚Äôt think this even sounded good, enjoyed it and wants me to make it again. I never would‚Äôve thought to add pumpkin to chili. Thank you!

Followed what the other reviews said to do.
Saute red onion and meat with spices - salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, minced garlic, and some chili powder.
I used beef instead of turkey along with the chili beans and black as stated in the recipe. Mixed up the tomatoes with fire roasted and no sodium added ones. Added a small can of diced green chilies. 
Instead of pumpkin spice,  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon, some paprika, and 1 1/5 tsp of cumin. 
Don't forget sour cream and shredded cheese for the top.

Used red onion, 1/2 tbsp chipotle, extra fresh tomatoes and canned pumpkin. Grated cheddar cheese on top and served with a dollop of sour cream!

I made this chili, without knowing that my kids and parents would be stopping by.  I was already leery about making chili with turkey, my husband only likes beef chili.  But, to my amazement EVERYONE LOVED this chili!! I will be making it again.  I used canned pumpkin like some of the other reviewers did.  Easy and delicious!!

This was very tasty.  I really liked it.  BUT, I nearly killed myself cutting up the pumpkin,  That part took me forever.  And I really struggled to do it.  I will not make it again because of this.

This recipe passed the husband test with flying colors!  He was surprised as to how good it was.    He especailly liked the taste of cinnamon in the mix.   I, too added some tweeks.  I used fresh pumpkin (small pie pumpkin will do) and found an eaasier way to dice.   Cleaned out the pumpkin and sliced into 8 wedges.  Put in a covered dish with about an inch of water.  Microwaved 3-4 minutes.  One then can easily remove skin and dice.  I also added some extra chili seasoning & S & P.  Cooked at high for 3 hours.  Pumkpin was just soft enough to eat but didn't fall apart as originl recipe stated.  Will make again.

I made a double batch hoping to have leftovers for lunch. I used white beans instead of black and kidney beans. My family LOVES this recipe there was none left for the next day ??. What a great fall chili recipe.

Everyone loved this chili and I will definitely make it again.  Slight changes include using 1.5 pounds of turkey, using cubed sweet potatoes instead of pumpkin, throwing in one can of pumpkin puree, and adding 1/4 cup of water.

Excellent chili

I made this recipe last week and was a little apprehensive because  I thought  it would be a little sweet since my family does not necessarily like a sweet meat dish.  Although there was also the savory spices used I was  VERY pleasantly surprised that it was a big hit with my family.  First time recipes I will follow as written and did but next time I make it I will add a bit more chili powder.   Most chilis are a little spicier so I will tweek it to my family‚Äôs liking .

I doubled this recipe for a work potluck, using red onion and chipolte chili pepper.   Cooked meat and onion and then mixed into other ingredients the night before, put in crockpot in am.  Was perfect by lunch time.  And, a huge hit.  Coincidentally, made as listed, only has 1 Weight Watcher point per serving!

I‚Äôve never been a fan of chili but the pumpkin in this recipe caught my attention. It was delicious!  I used canned pumpkin and added a little bit of cayenne to give it a kick.  I‚Äôm not a fan of beans, so I left out the black and only used chili.

I love this recipe, so different.  I used red onion but it didn't cook in 3 hrs. on low, so set in on high until done.  I am giving out the recipe to friends already after they tasted it. Thanks for something new.

Salt and pepper obviously missing. I made as directed and gave it 2-3 stars.
 I then had to doctor it up so much so much to serve it to my family that I can‚Äôt give the original version any more than 2-3 stars.  I REALLY wanted to like this one. Dang it.

Made this a few years ago for a Halloween party. At first everyone kind of turned thier noses up and said,  "ewww"
One brave soul tried it...
Came back in the house about 45 min later and it was almost gone, and I mean you couldn't scrape enough up to eat gone.

This is one of my family's favorite recipes. I add an extra can of black beans and reduce the sugar by 1 T. When pumpkins are not in season, I substitute an equal amount of SWEET POTATOES (or more). My family actually prefers it with the sweet potatoes. It's better the next day when all the spices settle in. You can adjust the heat based on what kind of chili powder you use and whether you use "hot" chili beans or "mild". I've made every variation from barely spicy to "sets off the smoke alarm". All have been delicious. Great served over macaroni, rice or spaghetti squash.

Good idea but poorly written and not tested. Of course you need salt and pepper but first you need flavor and there's just not that much here. Brown the onions and pumpkin with the turkey for starters. Next you need some heat and most chili powder just doesn't have it. I used 2tsp of chipotle chilis or you could use the powder or something similar. I also added more chili powder (spice islands) and the flavor was getting ok. So be prepared to work on it but as written it's not good.

I made this chili exactly as the recipe shows. My husband, who hates really spicy food and has never been a big fan of chili at all, loved this! Making it again and again.

Very good flavor.  It's not mentioned in the recipe, but I seasoned my turkey with salt and pepper when browning and also saut√©ed my onions before adding them.  I opted for the easy canned pumpkin and Bush's Northern Chili beans as prior review suggested as well.  I doubled the batch for a family gathering and it filled my large crockpot to the brim.  Cooked on low for 6 hours, stirred once an hour.  Husband said "Delicious".   Will make again!

I used squash since I couldn‚Äôt  find it pre-cut pumpkin and added cumin and red pepper flakes. It was still a little sweet but we enjoyed it and will make again (maybe with less brown sugar next time).

Love, love, love it and will definitely make again.  There were substitutions, mainly based on what I had handy.  I used pumpkin puree (was hesitant but it worked) instead of cubed pumpkin.  I added a package of Chili seasoning, a tin of green chilis, and used veggie ground round instead of turkey.  Personally, I love the sweet/savory of it all.  YUM!!!

This recipe is a nice change from traditional chili, I loved it as did my husband. Will make it again and again, nice comfort food. As far as the actual recipe it was a base for me as I always tweak to my liking.

Excellent chili recipe! I made this for a friend's birthday party and everyone loved it. The only thing I did differently was to use the stove top instead of the slow cooker and I added maybe 1/8 tsp ground red pepper for a little heat.  I'm glad I doubled the recipe - now I have some leftovers.  This will be my only chili recipe!

OMGosh!  The best ever!  I cooked  it on stove top, simmering a couple hours after bringing everything to a boil. I followed the recipe with these extra details: I used two 12 oz. "tubes" of organic ground turkey, a whole white onion (sauteed) and a whole roasted hokkaido pumpkin.  Added a little extra pumpkin pie spice and brown sugar and a jar of Pace Medium salsa.  It's perfect!

It really needs something. When I heated up the left overs I added lots of cinnamon and salt. It helped, but I probably won't make this recipe again.

We thought it was very good!  Especially with the low calorie count.  The only thing we did was sprinkle some Texas Pete into it.  Even with the chiles, we thought it needed some more heat!

The hardest thing was gutting the pumpkin and cutting off the  thick outer skin.  Everything else was simple.  My family loved it!  I made a double batch and they devoured it in no time.

Delicious flavor, but even cutting the chilli powder in half made it too spicy for my delicate palate.  A dallop of sour cream on top eased the fire in my mouth. Otherwise though, it was easy to prepare (lots of chopping!) and the flavour is amazing.

Delicious! I didn't have prep time to cut and cube a pumpkin, so I used pre cut butternut squash.  I swapped out chili beans for black beans and cannellini beans. We tore it up! So easy and so tasty.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe! I am vegetarian and so I made a couple of changes. Omitted the turkey and saut√©ed the onions before adding to crockpot and because I‚Äôm lazy I also used 2 cups of canned pumpkin. The pumpkin gave it so much flavor. I cooked on low for about 4 hours. Perfect!

delicious but way too sweet.  Not sure if it was the pumpkin or tomatoes but regret adding that brown sugar.  My only advice would be to add the sugar, as needed-to taste, at the end of cooking.

I followed the recipe exactlyexcept for using the canned pumpkin since it was easier then cutting up a pumpkin.  It was very easy and seemed pretty healthy.  I thought the pumpkin taste was a little weird but my boyfriend said he really liked it.  It had a good chili taste overall though.

I made this, doctored up the recipe a bit with rotel diced tomatoes with chiles versus diced tomatoes, and used reduced sodium kidney beans versus chili beans, and this dish was BOMB! Love the mix of spicy and sweet! This recipe is a keeper for sure!

Any ideas on what to substitute for the tomatoes? or any ingredients containing tomatoes? I sometimes make a chili with sweet potatoes instead of pumpkin, and that's 5 star!

I absolutely loved this and I can't wait to make it again!  I did make a mistake, and confused this with another recipe, so I used 1 can of pumpkin instead of fresh, but it turned out perfectly!  It had a very similar taste to Skyline chili, probably because of the cinnamon in the pie spice.

I do have another recommendation though, try using it with hot chili beans instead of mild, the spice helps balance the flavor of the pie spice. 

I'm looking forward to making this again with fresh pumpkin this time, but I may prefer the canned just for convenience.

It‚Äôs an interesting change of pace. I made few changes, but they were: I cut the fresh pumpkin into smaller than cubed pieces - felt this would help get the pumpkin flavor infused into everything; I added a little pumpkin puree for good measure - about a half a can; I added one hot pepper (all I had on hand). As with all chili, it‚Äôs much better after a day in the fridge. The first day I had some, just to sample, and the turkey was pretty noticeably turkey, if that makes sense. It was still good but you can tell and see it was turkey. After a day in the fridge it was much less turkey like - just looked like normal beef chili. And it was great. I wouldn‚Äôt want this every time, but for an autumn change of pace, it was really very good. Give it a try.

Deliciously easy. I made it and followed the suggestions made by Ashley White except I did not have the chipotle chili seasoning. I did use can pureed pumpkin (NOT pumpkin pie mix) and added red pepper flakes. I used 1 can of Northern Beans and 1 can of another white bean, I think cannellini. I definitely think white beans & turkey go excellent together. I sauteed the onions first adding some pepper and salt then put in crock pot. I served this with brown rice....total score here.

I made this for a fall-themed pot-luck and it went over very well (even with another chili competing.) I personally, thought it was a little low on the salt (but I tend to like more salt than others.) I will probably make this again and not change the recipe, though I will keep adding salt to my own bowl.

Made this and I personally loved it - but couldn't get "secret ingredients" past hubby. He ate it but wasn't enthusiastic for seconds. The next day, I tossed in 8 oz can of tomato sauce and some more chili powder, simmered on warm in crockpot. He liked that better! I followed direction pretty closely except I used more ground turkey as we like meaty chili, 1/2 the amount of pie spice, and added 1 tsp cumin. Served with cornbread. For me, five stars, but given that it may not appeal to all palates going with four. Best for open minded and adventuresome eaters!

Used rotel with chiles for half of the diced tomatoes like another reader suggested.  Also added half processed chipotle Chile in adobo sauce with about 2 tbsp sauce..  My husband loved it topped with sour cream and shredded cheddar.

I have made this twice. Once in the slow cooker and once on top of the stove. I added a diced fire roasted hatch chili from my stash in the freezer. I used 1 can diced tomatoes and 1 can fire roasted salsa in place of the 28 oz can of diced tomatoes.

Great taste.
I only substitute the chili powder with the chipotle powder as mentionned in one of the reviews it gave it a great taste. I even won the chili cook off at work.
 I will definitely make it again.

Everyone loved this chili!  I was making it for a crowd so I tripled the recipe except for the beans. When it came time to add the beans, after adding 4 cans, I stopped. There were plenty of beans! I did use fresh pumpkin and it was so worth the hassle of peeling the pumpkin! The chunks of pumpkin gave it such a rich taste.  I also added a whole very spicy pepper to the pot while it was cooking for some extra spice!   Will definitely make again!

wow I had my doubts at first, but to my surprise, it had a very spicy harvest taste, I thought it was excellent---it was very thick and hardy --I really would not change anything in it,  I may have added a tiny bit more brown sugar but that was all. this is a keeper in my book.  I am all for trying something new and different and I am so glad I tried it.

I added a tablespoon of Cayenne, 1 bell pepper, some diced garlic, used red onion & a can of Hatch green chilis. I was afraid if I told my husband there was pumpkin & turkey in it he wouldn't eat it, so I gave him a taste when it was almost done & he said it was good, then I told him. At dinner he ate 2 big bowls & said he would have a 3rd bowl if he wasn't afraid he would be too full.  Needless to say it was a big hit!!!!!

I made it exactly as it was written, since I hadn't made it before, but was using fresh frozen pumpkin I prepared previously. To keep it from being mushy, I cubed the pumpkin that was cubed and cooked before freezing, so thawed it and then heated it in the microwave and about an hour before serving added the heated pumpkin to the mix. The family really enjoyed it, but I think I will add more chili powder and pumpkin spice and a little salt, as my beans were no sodium. Yummy and can't wait for the next "go"!

I followed Ashley White's suggestions for this recipe and it was the best chili I have ever made. It was loved by everyone!!   Make this chili!  I used a can of Libby's because it's way easier and tastes great.  I also made mine very spicy (with three fresh jalape√±os, diced, and 1.5 tablespoon of cayenne). It was incredible, but also very easy to tone down if you prefer.

YUM! I did make some changes for convenience and my personal taste preference (spiced it up a bit). I cooked the onion with the ground turkey and seasoned with a bit of salt, pepper, and cumin. I used a 14.5 oz can of pumpkin puree. For the diced tomatoes I used half garlic & onion seasoned and half fire-roasted. For more spice I added a small can of mild green chilies and one chopped chipotle pepper in adobe sauce. Finally, I used Great Northern + black beans and I didn't drain them, just emptied the cans in. Simmered on the stovetop for about 1.5 hrs. Great flavor and even with my additions not really spicy, just tasty!

Was delicious and everyone at work loved it. Alterations I made from other review suggestions were: saut√©ed onions, fire roasted tomatos, and pumpkin puree. 
For next time, I will definitely salt more during cooking.

Fantastic recipe.  I had not previously ever cut up a pumpkin for a recipe before, and was surprised how many cups of flesh a pumpkin has (mine yielded over 10 cups).  Therefore, I suggest getting a very small pumpkin or making multiple batches or dishes.

This was excellent! I followed the suggestions of the top reviewer and it was the bomb! Truly the richest tasting, best chili I have made! The chipotle chili powder and pumpkin combine to give it a very appealing flavor.  Served topped with shredded cheddar cheese, dollop of sour cream, and tortilla chips on the side - delicious! I rarely leave reviews and had to for this one because it was that good! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This was really good!  I added a tablespoon of cocoa and a teaspoon of cumin.  (Cinnamon and chili powder, might as well go for a mole taste). I did thicken it with a slurry at the end.  The chunks of pumpkin added a wonderful texture to it ( it would ruin it to try using canned pumpkin pur√©e).  The pumpkin pie spice was very mild tasting, but added a great depth to the flavor.  This is my new go-to chili recipe!

This came out really well. I made a few changes. I  cut up a pie pumpkin and roasted it with some chili seasoning and oilive oil. Used fire roasted tomatoes with greed chilies. 
I also browned the turkey and sauted the onions before adding to crock pot. 
The best addition was that I blended my own pumpkin pie spices instead of store bought. 
Will be making this healthy dish again and to share at work.

I really liked this chili recipe.  I used butternut squash instead of  pumpkin.  My 12 year old did not care for the squash but liked everything else.  I did find it needed more than 3 hours on low.

Excellent. I followed the recipe pretty closely except I used homemade pumpkin puree and dry pinto and great northern white beans because it's what I had on hand. I will be making it again.

Modified it a bit.  I added a can of tomato sauce and steamed the pumpkin first (it was more like 3.5 cups of pumpkin). Added a bit of cayenne pepper.  Easy to make on the stove top as well.

Very tasty, but more like stew than chili. I made it on the stovetop, cooking on lowest heat setting for several hours. I have found the spice flavors meld better the longer I leave this in the fridge. Rewarmed leftovers are fantastic!

There is a nice balance of flavors here but I feel they are overpowered by too much heat.   I would cut the chili powder should 1 teaspoon,not 1 tablespoon.

I don't know how to rate this properly.  I made it as directed and quickly realized it needed so much more.  First, there wasn't nearly enough liquid.  It was just crumbled turkey, onions, beans, pumpkin and tomatoes.  So I added garlic and peppers for more volume and added at least one can of chicken broth plus a can of tomato paste for more tomato flavor.  It still lacked any kind of seasoning so I added cumin, coriander, cinnamon and probably doubled the chili powder and pumpkin spice.  I also added salt and pepper which I don't recall being listed but there we are.  What I made, I really liked but it wasn't as directed.  I did try what was directed but it just needed way too much more.  To that end, I'd make my version again but I would double the pumpkin, frankly.  Oh, I didn't use brown sugar because I didn't want it sweet and rarely put sugar in my food.  In the end, yes, I liked it but not as it was directed.  Sorry.

This was a great October chili.  The only thing I did differently was brown the onions in the pan after I removed the browned turkey.  This helped loosen the turkey bits that were stuck in the pan , made for an easy pan clean up too!  It didn't say to top with cheese but the picture showed it and the cheese helped cut the spices.  I will definitely make again!

This is a wonderful fall chili recipe!  So full of flavor.  I would probably cook it on top of the stove or bake t for hours to help it thicken up more and give it more of a "chili" consistancy .  This is definitely a make again for my family.

This was fantastic with some of the additions suggested.   Fire Roasted Tomatoes and Chili peppers were a definite plus to the recipe.  I also added a little V8 juice because it was a bit too thick.  I used Great Northern beans instead of black beans as well.  Even the nay sayers had a second bowl!!!  Great fall twist for chili lovers!  Will definitely be making this again...

It was just ok. Lacking in big bold chili flavors. I even followed one person's suggestion and substituted Chipotle chili for regular Chili powder. I won't be adding this one to my collection.

This was fantastic! I didn't bother with the slow cooker, since the turkey had to be browned first. Browned it together with the onion, garlic, and I threw in a shallot. Proceeded as  a regular chili, simmered for about 90 minutes.  Served with a little grated cheddar, a dollop of Greek yogurt, and a couple dashes of Grace's hot sauce. Yum!

I rarely use my slow cooker but decided to give this recipe a try. Glad I did.  After reading some reviews, I made a few changes to the ingredients.  Since it's not quite pumpkin season yet, I used prepacked sweet potato cubes. I replaced back beans with white beans. It tasted it fine but I regretted not using seasoned black beans. I used red onion, which I sauted before adding to the crockpot.  I also added 3-4 cloves of chopped garlic. When browning the turkey, I seasoned with salt, pepper, chili powder,  and cayenne.  Next time, I will just buy a spicer chili powder. I felt the cayenne didn't taste right. So don't do use that. For the tomatoes, I used diced tomatoes with roasted garlic. I also added some pickled jalapeno to the chili.  I let it cook for 4 hours on low. My family of four loved it and I froze the rest for another night. It makes plenty for 2 nights dinner.

This is a great, unique chili recipe that only needed a few small tweaks to be perfect for me! Like most people I did use the canned pumpkin, just out of convenience. And I saut√©ed the onion (with a clove of garlic) before browning the turkey, which I think added a lot of flavor. The one thing I will say is that the original recipe wasn't as spicy as I'm used to, so I ended up adding another tablespoon of chili powder and about a tablespoon and a half of chipotle Tabasco and that did wonders. I will definitely make this again!

This is the first of many recipes that I make each year when Sugar Pie Pumpkins come into season!  I am not big on hot spices, so I cut the chili powder by half!  I also use sweet Walla Walla Onions and 3 cups of multi-colored  bell peppers  to enhance both the flavor and color, and a small can of diced chili's to give off a very small amount of heat! I use  canellini and black beans as well! If you're used to using fresh pumpkin,  there is a big difference in taste from canned! I halve, then roast the pie pumpkins sprinkled with pumpkin pie spice  foe about 20 minutes at 400¬∞ so peeling and cubing them is a breeze!  I make this at least 3 times every winter as it is the best  (and healthiest ) chili that I have ever had!

Nice recipe, would make it again . Just a few of my own taste preference adjustments along with other reviewers recommendations:  Cubed my pumpkin 1/2 - 3/4", used combo of 1 TBS sweet and also 1 TBS smoked paprika, 1 TBS fresh ground cumin, and a little less allspice than called for, several chopped fresh garlic cloves sauteed as the onions were almost done (so as not to burn),  1 small can mild green chilies, and of course, freshly grated nutmeg (the jar stuff has no taste). Also, had some frozen corn (about 1.5 - 2 cups) which we had steamed & froze late summer, and quick seared/pan-fried the corn in a little olive oil before putting it in the slow cooker, adding fresh garlic, sprinkle of smoked paprika, 1/2 tsp ground cumin, sprinkle of kosher salt & ground pepper about a minute before removing from the cast iron pan. Also used organic cannelini beans, which worked well. 

The recipe still had the nice warming attributes of the original recipe intended while adding a little more "southwest" flavor, or so I believe. In any case, it came out very good. 

Vegetarians note: I also made a vegetarian version - exact duplicate of the above meat version, using combo of some browned Quorn cutlets & Gardein Veg-chicken strips, also came out just great.

I thought this was kind of weird.  My kids liked it, but my husband and I thought it was just okay.  I'm not sure if it was the sweetness or the combination of ingredients, but something was off.  I made it almost as written, except that I used canned pumpkin like many 5-star reviews had mentioned, and my store didn't carry seasoned black beans, so I used regular black beans.  I wouldn't make this again.

My husband loves this so much, he requested it twice in one week! Following tips in other reviews, I used 1/2 fire-roasted diced tomatoes and 1/2 regular canned diced tomatoes, and cannellini beans instead of black beans.  For our tastes, I used about 1/2 tablespoon of chili seasoning, and 1/2 tablespoon chipotle chili seasoning. I also added a tablespoon or two of chicken base. I love chicken base and use it frequently in recipes, but do be careful using it! It is very salty, so adjust your salt accordingly. I cooked ground turkey breast with 1/2 of a large sweet onion, and added salt and pepper to the mixture. Threw everything but the pumpkin into the crockpot and cooked on low for about 3 or 4 hours, then added the fresh cubed pumpkin and cooked for about 3 more hours. I added the pumpkin later so it wouldn't completely disintegrate. Topped with cheese and sour cream and with corn muffins on the side, it was a hit!

I've been looking for a fun and festive fall chili recipe, and I came across this one. I read the reviews and followed the tips. Here are the changes I made to the recipe:  sauteed onion with the turkey and seasoned with salt, pepper, and chipolte chili powder.  I used one can of great northern beans and one can of small red beans.  I used a can of pumpkin instead of fresh.  I used one can of fire roasted tomatoes and one can of Rotel.  I also had a package of spicy jalape√±o chicken sausage in the fridge, so I sliced it up and threw that in, too.  It's simmering on the stove instead of the crock pot. I just tasted it, and it is exactly what I was looking for! It's the perfect combination of sweet, spicy, and savory. It's perfect for a crisp autumn day!! I love sour cream, so I will throw some chipolte chili powder in the sour cream and dollop it on top! I'm serving cornbread with it ! Can't wait!!

Added a bit more spice so the chili wasn't so sweet and doubled everything.  I used canned Pumpkin. My 10 year old daughter made this for a Chili Cook Off and it was perfection!!

Mine turned out tasty, but I had to guess on a couple things.  First, there was no mention of what to do with the onion. I sauteed it with the meat. I used ground chicken thigh meat.  Secondly, I didn't know what was meant by "chili beans" I used kidney.  I prepared "seasoned black beans" myself using a classic chili seasoning mix I like, a red jalapeno, 1 garlic clove and half an onion.  I also used fire roasted tomatoes, which I think have a lot more flavor than plain.

We didn't love this. Myself and my mom liked it ok but my husband and children said "please don't put pumpkin in the chili again." I like to try new things and thought this sounded like an interesting recipe. I made it exactly as stated but used canned pumpkin for convenience. If you're looking for a healthy twist to chili, then this is a good option, but overall it's definitely not better than the real deal.

I thought this recipe was quite good. I'd give it 4.5 of there were half stars. I thought it was a little mild for my tastes, although I didn't use chili beans. I used kidney and black beans, as well as canned pumpkin. I ended up adding quite a bit more chili powder,  salt, and pepper. That fixed much of the mildness. I also served it over noodles with cheese and crackers on top. My wife thinks it was wonderful. We put the leftovers in the fridge and are taking it to work all week. Do try this recipe, especially during the fall.

Excellent! Word of advice, add some liquid to the slow cooker. Either water or tomato juice.

I added some broth for the last hour & a half so it wouldn't dry out.
