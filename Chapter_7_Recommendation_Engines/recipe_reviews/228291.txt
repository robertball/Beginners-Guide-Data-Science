Moscato wine and lemon-lime soda really bring this to life.

This is so good.  I had a bottle of wine I had to use up and this was perfect, fruity and refreshing.

I modified it, but not on purpose -- I misread the recipe. I used two bottles of semi-sweet Seyval Blanc (Midwestern wine grape) and where the recipe for pink lemonade printed on the side of the can say dilute by 4 cans, I diluted by 1/2 of that. I also just put a splash of the lemon lime soda (maybe an ounce or so) on top after pouring the beverage into the glass so it didn't go flat. I tested it on many people who all loved it!

I had a get together this weekend and this was a HUGE hit. I modified it, only one half of the wine *one bottle* and half of a liter of sprite, with one can of lemonade and strawberries and lemons instead of raspberries. People loved it. Thank you

Refreshing and delicious but a bit too sweet for our taste. Next time I'll use club soda in place of the lemon lime soda

This was very good and a hit at the party we took it to (all gone).  It is very sweet, but pairs nicely with spicy food.  I would make this again for sure.

I've made this twice. The first time, I misread the recipe and added a whole bottle of soda. This tasted OK, but I thought I should give it another try before rating it. The second try tasted better, but I would have been happier with the wine alone.
