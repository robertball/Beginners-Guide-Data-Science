This was a delicious casserole! I modified it a bit to suit the tastes of my family members. I used a seasoning blend by Pictsweet that has chopped onions, green and red bell peppers, celery, and garlic salt. I sauteed this blend in a little butter while cutting up the squash. I added the squash and water to the sauteed veggies and cooked together for 15 minutes. I substituted cream of celery for the cream of mushroom and added a little cajun seasoning (Tony Chachere's). The casserole came out beautiful and tasted awesome.

Yum!  I sauted the squash and onion with some garlic powder and topped the casserole with Italian seasoned bread crumbs and a few sprays of I Can't Believe It's Not Butter instead of croutons.  This was easy to make and I'm sure we'll be having it again soon.

Fantastic recipe!!  I lightened it considerably by using Egg Beaters instead of eggs, reducing the cheese to 1 cup (and using 2% milk cheddar cheese), and using just 1/2 cup bread crumbs instead of the croutons.  I also found I was out of mushroom soup....I used 98% fat free Broccoli Cheese soup instead and it was fabulous!! Definately a keeper!

This is a GREAT way to cook a LOT of squash.  It has a good consistency and it was VERY easy to make.  My only suggestion would be to add in salt and pepper to taste as ingredients.  Also, a little bit of garlic salt gave it an extra seasoning boost.

Wonderful, wonderful casserole.  I used zuchinni and yellow squash.  I added black pepper to the soup mixture (suggested by previous reviewer).  I used a four-cheese blend instead of all cheddar.  Lastly, I mistakenly bought mushroom soup with roasted garlic--I love garlic and the casserole was just wonderful.  My finnicky teenager loves it too!

Very good combination of flavors, however, still just a little bland. I added a little garlic powder, italian seasoning and seaasoned salt to my individual helping. It really gave the dish a pick-me-up.

I was looking for a quick and easy vegetarian casserole recipe and this fit the bill perfectly. I used a mixture of zucchini and pattypan squash instead of yellow squash and substituted mozzarella cheese for the cheddar. It did come out a little soggy since the squash released moisture during the cooking, but I also added an extra egg so that may have contributed as well. Instead of the croutons, I topped it with Romano cheese and panko breadcrumbs. I served the casserole with a slotted spoon so it wouldn't drip, and the crunch of the panko was a perfect complement to the softness of the squash. Overall, it was very good.

A WINNER!  I love squash casserole & have been looking for a great recipe for years.   It’s hard to find decent recipe without sour cream (as I’m not a big fan).  I have tried similar recipes without the egg.  THE EGG MAKES THE DIFFERENCE!  It adds great texture to the casserole!  
My changes include:  adding ½ cup grated carrot for color, stewing the squash, carrots, & onion in butter and chicken broth, adding 3-4 dashes of pepper sauce and garlic powder  to the mix for depth of flavor, and using bread crumbs dotted with butter on top instead of croutons.  
SUPER DUPER YUMMY! Try it!

I thought this tasted alright. The only change I made was subbing a cup of litely buttered ritz type crackers for the croutons, because I don't care for casseroles with bread crumb or crouton toppings. I also used lite cheddar and a little less than what was called for as cheese does not come in 2 cup bags anymore I realized and that is what I had bought. This will all get eaten up, but I personally thought it was kind of mushy, and it doesn't reheat very well either.

Fabulous!  I made it a little bit healthier by doubling the squash.  It's great with any summer squash.  I used crookneck, zucchini, patty pan, 8 ball, opo, and chinese silk squash in mine.  Also, sharp cheddar and seasoned bread crumbs really bring out the flavor.  Yummy!

I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and used seasoned bread crumbs because I did not have seasoned croutons.  Excellent.  Will make again and again.  Thanks.

This was a different twist to the regular cheesy squash casseroles I've made before. I used 1 cup of "Cream of Mushroom Soup I" instead of the canned stuff, 1 large yellow squash, 1/2 onion, and the rest of the recipe as is.

Well I had a neighbor friend give us a lot of squash, I had no clue what to do with it all. Well I made this last night. My husband said it was the best thing of the whole dinner. I made it like it should of been made but added salt and pepper and garlic. But I do that with most of my cooking. I also mixed a few of the croutons in the mix. All in all I was suprised squash could taste so good!!

We simply luh-uhved this dish. The only thing we did different was added a few pinches of garlic salt to the squash and onion mix(as recommended by other reviewers). Oh yeah, we made sure to drain it well afterwards(also recommended by other reviewers). Thanx JTJW. Cheers :o)

This was pretty good.  I added some garlic salt and pepper to my steamed squash and onions.  I only steamed the vegetables for 10 minutes and next time will steam for only about 7 minutes because I do like them a little crispier.  The croutons were pretty good but we do prefer the chicken flavored stuffing mix.

This was a great casserole recipe. Good for church potlucks.  I didn't have a full 2 cups of cheddar so I used 1 cup of cheddar and 1 cup of fiesta blend cheese. I also didn't have any croutons so I used crushed townhouse crackers with melted butter to make a topping--so good. I might add chopped green chilis next time

This recipe needs a little something extra to give it some zing. I steamed the squash and onion in the microwave in advance so it was very quick to throw this together for a church potluck on Sunday morning. I will definitely make this again, but will likely add minced garlic, salt, pepper, onion powder etc. to add another dimension to the flavor. This recipe will be perfect for a stress free holiday side dish. Thank you!

I liked this okay. I used yellow squash and zuchinni both and also added a little onion and garlic for some more flavor. I enjoyed the taste of this a lot but wasn't crazy about the texture. I think it's the eggs that I don't care for. I will make this again but will try adding either more cream of soup or some sour cream.

Excellent! I ended up creating a cream of chicken base instead of using cream of mushroom soup. I also used bread crumbs instead of croutons on top since I did not have any on hand. Still game out great! I will definitely make this again!

I use seasoned stuffing mix in mine instead  of the croutons.  To make this super easy, you can buy 2-3 cans (depending on how squashy you want it to taste) of squash with vidalia onions already included in the can.

This is really nice, the taste is good. The kids somehow had a problem with the chunks of squash, they usually have a problem of some sort anyway with something new. They will get used to it.

This was a great dish. I did make a few changes. I used both yellow and zucchini squash chopped up and sauted with a little butter along with the onion. I used cream of broccoli and cheese soup and crushed up about 1 cup of croutons and mixed them in. I used cheddar and monterey cheese. It will be a regular in our house.

This is SO delicious!  It was like a crustless quiche.  We didn't have any seasoned croutons, so we used plain stuffing-type bread cubes, and sprinkled some seasoning on top (oregano, basil, black pepper, garlic & onion powders).  This is probably supposed to be a side dish, but we liked it so much that it was the whole meal (and a few extra helpings, LOL).

Smells delicious! I added chopped mushrooms, and since I didn't have croutons, I topped it with fried onions.

Wow!  This was amazing!  I had all this yellow squash and did not know what to do with it! I looked on this site and thought that this recipe sounded easy and good! Excellent choice. I made slow cooked ribs and light salad. Dinner was a BIG hit! Thanks!

One word....AWESOME! Everyone loved it. My sister said it was cheesy, squashy goodness!  *I used seasoned bread crumbs because I didn't have croutons and I sauteed the squash & onions and added a few Tbsp. of water. Next time I make this I'll use more cheese just because I'm a cheese-lover. This recipe is a keeper!

This was wonderful.  I did however, make some changes.  I left out the eggs because I don't like that texture.  I added some garlic and pepper and a little onion flakes to mixture before putting over squash and onion.  For topping I used crushed crackers and shredded cheese.  YUMMM  I'm wondering what it would be like to add some green pepeprs.

We loved it.  I sauted the veggies like some suggested & added fresh mushrooms.  I cut back on the cheese & used only one egg.  Also added one carrot.  Instead of croutons, I used 3/4 cup ritz crackers.

Family loved this. Only suggestions would be drain squash VERY well or you get water in the bottom of casserole and I am going to mix the soup mixture with the squash mixture instead of just ladeling it over the top. It didn't make it all the way to the bottom on its own.

This was good though had to make changes because of not having mushroom soup on hand.  Instead made a white sauce from 2 tbs. butter and 1/4 flour, liquid from small can of mushrooms & and little soy milk until it was the consistancy of canned soup, also added garlic and onion powder.  Steamed the squash in the microwave for 5 minutes, twice, draining after each time heated.  The squash was still a bit crunchy, and next time will try it for 15 min. in microwave.  After putting steamed vegetables in baking dish, spread topping on top.  Next time will mix in with the vegetables, as the flavor from sauce and cheese would have been throughout the dish.  We did enjoy this and will make it again as posted.

This was a good blend of flavors, but just a little drier than I had expected. I might try adding a little milk to moisten just a bit before cooking. Overall, the casserole held up well and was easy to prepare. I did add a little garlic powder, but still seemed to be missing something. Still good. Thanks.

This was good, but I think our family just prefers our squash to be lightly steamed with other veggies and served as is.  Just a preference, because we love a similar recipe to this that uses chicken instead of the squash, but we serve our veggies on the side with it.  It's still worthy of a four star, though, because it was good overall. :)

Very good recipe. Even my husband (not a big fan of squash) enjoyed this dish. I used yellow squash and zuchinni squash plus I added a bit of salt and pepper to the cheese/soup/egg mixture. I didn't have any croutons SO I used seasoned bread crumbs mixed with 2T of melted butter...then sprinkled that on the top. Yum. 
This is a nice recipe to keep on hand when you are looking for ways to use your squash. The leftovers taste GREAT reheated the next day too!

Very easy to put together. A bit too moist at completion but rather tasty.  Could use some more herbal additions; will have to experiment with that.

I made this and followed some of the advice of others and sautéed the squash with a tablespoon of butter and the onion and added a clove of garlic instead of boiling. I used butter and garlic croutons to put on top and it was delicious! My husband and I loved it.  Followed the rest of the directions.

This was delicious and my husband couldn't put his fork down.  I did make a few small changes.  I added garlic powder to the boiling water, used 2 cups of 4 Cheese Mexican Blend shredded cheese, and topped with French Fried Onions because it's what I had on hand.  It was fantastic and I will definitely make again!

I love this recipe! I've had a lot of really beautiful summer squash from my garden this year, and no idea what to do with so much.  So I started searching for a recipe that's would utilize a lot at once. And this recipe was perfect for that purpose. Like other reviewers, I did add in my own spices. And instead of boiling, I sautéed the squash and onions in a little bit of extra virgin olive oil, with lots of garlic powder, and some seasoning salt and pepper, until it was tender but still crisp. And after baking it covered for 25 minutes, when I pulled it out to add the breadcrumbs,  it seemed a bit dry to me. So I stirred in about 1/4 cup of milk,  added a nice layer of Italian bread crumbs to the top, then stuck it back in the oven, uncovered, for an additional 25 mins. It turned out creamy, and delish!! The squash wasn't soggy at all! I'm guessing reviewers that had issues with theyre squash turning out soggy probably over cooked it in the first step. My husband who typically doesn't care for any kind of squash raved about it! Even took some to work in his lunch the day after! My whole family loved it! Thanks for a great recipe! I'll definitely be making it many more times in the future!

I had to change the number of servings to 4.  I followed the recipe set up after the change but when it was done,  the ranch and mayo made the consistency too thick.  The flavor of the ranch dressing was overbearing.
I did not like it at all but will try again with the original amount of servings to see if it makes a difference.

Steamed all the veggies together. Whipped 3 eggs on the kitchen aide for 8 min. Little boys of extra seasoning and cooked outside on the traeger which never fails!

Casserole good as written. However I use chicken stock rather than water & do not add more salt. I reserve the stock after squash & onions have cooked for later use (usually rice!) I change up the topping, sometimes Seasoned Panko Bread Crumbs, crushed Ritz crackers or crushed Pepperidge Farm Herb Seasoned stuffing. But really any topping works. ;-)

It's comfort food. I over did it with the garlic, and used several types of squash. Also used bread crumbs, and 1 egg. It's very good dish. Will make again.

This was alright. I didn't have enough squash so I used a bit of cucumber. I thought the textures of the squash and cucumber worked fine together. I also cooked it for 15 minutes in the microwave and then 10 in the oven to save time. That seemed to work out just fine. I don't planning on making this again.

I followed the recipe except for the following:  I sauteed the squash and onions, added salt and pepper, left out the eggs, and topped with crushed crackers instead of croutons. This is the best squash casserole recipe I've ever used.

This was pretty good. It's really  bland though. It needs to be kicked up a few notches. Next time I think I'll mince some garlic with the squash instead of onions.

I found this recipe to be VERY BLAND, LACKING FLAVOR and tasting like cream of mushroom soup.  I made some of the recommended changes (sauting veggies, added carrots and used ritz crackers) and still found it to be a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT

This was a good dish.  I would classify it as a casserole, but it turned out great.  Next time I would use fat free cheese because it was rather rich, and maybe low cal soup.  Other then that it was was good.

Delicious-  I didn't have any croutons so I used panko bread crumbs mixed with curls of parmigean cheese and this did provide the crunch.

This was great except for one thing. The croutons. Don't get me wrong I like croutons but on top of this otherwise perfectly good dish was just wrong. 

I think I'll make it again but instead try instant stuffing as one reviewer did or maybe crushed ritz crackers mixed with butter. But not croutons. 

Thanks. 

Kate

A neighbor had brought us a bunch of squash, and I was getting a little tired of stir-frying it.  I tried this recipe, and lo and behold, even my picky kids liked it!  I don't like mushrooms, so I used cream of celery soup instead.  This was a delicious way to get my kids to eat squash.  We got two meals out of it, too!

Not mind-blowing but a good, satisfactory side dish and a good way to use up squash from the garden. I lightened it up with egg whites (instead of whole eggs) and reduced fat cheddar cheese. Like other reviews I added some garlic salt and Italian seasoning for extra flavor. I also had to use break crumbs in liue of croutons but that worked out OK as well.

An alternative to grilling squash...especially when you are getting it from everyone that has a garden.

Very, very good!  Made this for lunch and my daughter and I both had 2nds.  I sauted squash, zucchini and onions and added a little salt, pepper and garlic, everything else as the recipe suggested.  Will make again!

Delicious!  I don't even like squash and I loved this!  My grandmother sent us home with a large amount of squash, and I needed to make something with it, since I didn't want it to go to waste.  It is absolutely wonderful.  I did like a previous reviewer and added salt and a very liberal amount of pepper.  Wonderful.  Thank you!

This was really good, and I got a ton of compliments on it.  The only thing I wasn't that crazy about was the fact that the croutons get kind of hard and chewy on top.  Maybe I will crush them next time.  Great recipe!
