As written, it is a two pot meal. The recipe should read "remove chicken to a plate, add water and sauce to skillet."   However,  I added a bit of garlic salt to the chicken before coating it in the cheese/herb mix, and just quickly browned the outside.  Then I kept the chicken in the pan to finish cooking with the sauce and pasta.  Nice and easy, and fewer dishes.  Tip: 2.5 cups of water equals a jarful.  I'd probably make it again.

I thought it was great! I added some plain bread crumbs (1/4 c) to help coat the chicken.

Very tasty.  I did add only some garlic salt to the Parmesan cheese/Italian seasonings as my husband likes more salt in things.

Nice and easy summertime recipe with no oven baking! My favorite part was cooking the spaghetti with water and sauce combined, this idea adds better flavor to the dish.

This is so delicious and easy to make! I followed the recipe completely, except just used a jar of sauce I already had on hand. Very quick and I am so impressed with the taste.
