Hey Raquel. It is a great recipe, and I wanted the opportunity to explain myself. I just realized you saw the website, and haven't heard what I do on the radio. You know my email, so feel free to email me as soon as possible to we can rectify this situation.  Scott

This was delicious! I used my own whole wheat crust and omitted the banana peppers because I had none - added a little chopped red bell pepper and a few mushrooms I needed to use up.  The addition of chicken makes this a very hearty, meaty pizza, and I love that unmistakeable chourico flavor and the garlicky sauce.   Thanks, Raquel!

Great pizza, our only change was to use canned chicken to save time. We will definitely make this again!

The taste of it satisfied my pizza craving.  I had been searching a long time ago looking for informative recipe sites like gourmetrecipe which helped me improve my skills in cooking, so far I have learned a lot from this very good site too.  Thank you because my family and friends enjoyed foods which I have learned from these sites.
