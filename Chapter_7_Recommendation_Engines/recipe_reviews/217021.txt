My grocery store does not carry Escarole. I spoke to the produce manager and he suggested romaine lettuce. So I added it at the end right before I melted the cheese on top. It was de-lish. The romaine gave it a nice crisp texture. Don't forget to add salt and pepper. it really needs it.

This is terrific and wonderfully filling.  Substituted diced tomatoes w/chilis in tomato juice (added a nice kick), rinsed beans and discarded liquid to reduce amount of salt, plus added 1 tablespoon fresh minced rosemary.

Very good and definitely filling! I didn't have Cannellini beans  so I used a can of chickpeas.   Delicious, although can use some salt and pepper...Served on couscous.

This recipe caught my eye because of the ease of preparation and the use of whole, healthful ingredients. I was shopping for the ingredients when I noticed that fully cooked, flavored chicken sausages are packaged in the 12 oz. portion called for in the recipe. I'm glad I made the substitution, as I believe the final product would have been slightly bland with just chicken, even after seasoning with salt and pepper

This was good but could use a few tweaks to make it better. I'll add more seasoning next time and maybe some red wine vinegar.

Super delish! My whole family loved this! I made a couple of changes like using navy beans, green onions, & I nixed the cheese to cut a bit of the fat. I also didn't have a lot of time to cut & prepare chicken breasts, so I used a bag of Oscar Mayer turkey bacon bits. I just threw them in at the end with the escarole. I served it over plain cous cous. It was scrumptious & did not need any additional seasonings!

Pretty good.  I substituted chickpeas for the cannelini, and swiss chard for the escarole, because its what I had on hand.  I would definitely add some spice of some sort next time!  Served it with rice.  Healthy!

I really like this recipe. It is true that adding the pecorino makes a big difference so I can see why some would call it bland. I sometimes add chicken if cooking for folks who like meat. Delicious and nutritious.

This was very good. I made as written except for the beans. I used white limas because that is all I had on hand.  I had gotten some escarole and spinach in my CSA box today and so I thought I would give this a try. The only thing I would do different next time is to add more seasoning.  Because there are only two of us I have left overs.  We will see how well they reheat later this week.

The original recipe would be so blend, I don't know if I would be able to eat it.  None of the ingredients add to the flavor, and after reading all five start reviews I noticed that everyone changed the recipe.  I have added my own spice mix and made it taste like something, but the original deserves one star.  I am giving it two for using healthy ingredients.

Couldn't find escarole so used kale instead. This was soooo good! Definitely making it again.

Yummy!  My husband and 4 of my 6 kids gobbled this up!  I doubled the recipe, but we had so many leftovers I probably wouldn't have needed to.  It really is filling.  I used fresh tomatoes instead of canned and one romaine heart instead of escarole because I don't know what that is.  I'm not a fan of cooked lettuces, so I probably won't do that next time and I'll add more onion and garlic.  4 stars because it's a little bland before you add seasoning. It was good and a nice break from Italian, Mexican and Chinese which we do frequently.

Used radicchio. Pretty good with that substitution and I like that it has such healthy ingredients. I rinsed and drained the beans, so there was not enough liquid and I had to keep adding water. Next time I would keep some of the tomato juice. Needed salt and pepper, and I'll try chicken sausage next time, too, for a little more flavor. Like this one, though!

My entire family ate this meal and it was super easy. I didn't have frozen spinach, or canned tomatoes...so I diced up one whole tomato and sauteed some mushrooms with the chicken. That's the only difference and it was delicious!! Will definitely make again.
