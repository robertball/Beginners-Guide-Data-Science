I used peach yogurt instead of the soy milk and it turned out really great--very smooth and tasty.

This was very good. I used Orange Peach Mango juice - Dole and Tropicana both make it and both taste pretty much the same. It wasn't quite as sweet as where I wanted it at first, so I added a bit more juice and a bit of honey as well to sweeten it up. I also used frozen peaches and mango. Very creamy and refreshing. I'll definitely be making it again.

I didn't have any soy milk so I used 2% milk instead.  Delicious!  This recipe has opened a whole new "smoothie" world for me!  Thanks!

Yum! We really enjoyed this. Very refreshing. I used frozen, unsweetened peaches and a dash of vanilla extract (only had regular soy milk). My mango wasn't as ripe as I would have liked so also added the smallest touch of honey. Hubby said he would enjoy this on his way to work in the morning. Will be making again tomorrow morning Thanks for sharing!

This is for mango lovers. This taste really good and drank this as a snack (its was filling). I replaced the peaches and soy milk for soy peach yogurt. ALso I added mango juice. I like thick yogurt, so i froze everything.

Great smoothie for mango lovers! I added orange juice, a little vanilla soy milk, a little peach yogurt, mangos and squeezed the juice from it, and then frozen strawberries (my blender won't crush ice unless it's crushed).   The strawberries evened out the taste and definitely keep adding orange juice until it evens out the extreme mango taste and it will be perfect.   Love it!

Four stars from Hubs, five from me.  Since there is no ability to rate the average between the two,  my  5-star rating will rule.  I didn’t have soy milk (we’ve tried it and don’t care for it) so I used milk and a sugar-free French Vanilla syrup as a substitute and to sweeten this up a little.  My mangoes and peaches were ripe and juicy - I stuck them in the freezer for awhile since I decided to make this on the spur of the moment and also added a handful of ice cubes just to ensure that this would be good and cold.  The verdict? I was really impressed.  Didn’t miss the typical yogurt smoothie at all; in fact, I actually preferred the omission.  While you can taste the mango and peach flavors on their own, it still has a unique, almost tropical flavor.  Creamy and thick – and with no yogurt!  And what a beautiful yellow-orange color, flecked with the tiniest bits of the peach peel.  Hubs agrees with me for the most part, but explains his 4-star rating by the fact that, one, he is even more discriminating with his 5-star ratings than I am and because he thought this wasn’t quite as robustly flavored as he prefers in a smoothie.

This smoothie is quite delicious and healthy as well. It wasn't as sweet as I had expected, but after a few sips I adjusted to the taste and loved it! It's not that it's not sweet.. because it is.. I think I'm just too used to the overly sugary smoothies from local smoothie joints!  If you are looking for something sweet, I would recommend adding in a little bit of honey. I will continue making this as-is.

I really enjoyed this smoothie! I changed the recipe just a bit. I peeled the peach before slicing, reduced the orange juice to 1/4 cup, used 3/4 cup regular 1% milk and put in a packet of Jay Robb's vanilla flavored whey protein! Great way to get some protein in a delicious smoothie!

This is a fabulous smoothie.  I used 1% milk, frozen mangos and a fresh ripe peach with the orange juice.   The consistency of this drink is perfect.  We loved it.

This was great for my kids, one of which is just getting over having his tonsils removed. I used both an organic peach and organic mango and instead of vanilla soy milk I used lowfat buttermilk with a teaspoon of vanilla. HUGE hit. Kids flipped over it. As soon as they finished the first cup, they begged for another!

This is great!  I used homemade almond milk.  Added some ice cubes.  Loved the other reviewer's tip about squeezing the mango pit.  I love mangos and will do this from now on.  I also juiced a whole navel orange for this.  Bought some organic kale to add to it this weekend.  My mangos should be ripe by then.  It's taken me a long time to find the right time to eat a mango.  I like them when they get soft and just start to ever so slightly shrivel.  The hard as a rock ones have a good week or more to ripen on the counter.

Refreshing but I can taste a little chalkyness from the frozen mangoes. Overall, it was good. I would like to make this with philippine mangoes next time.

Very yummy! Thanks for the great idea. I did end up using rice milk in place of the soy milk. I also added a touch of honey.

I used large can of peaches, frozen mangoes, whole milk and added 1 TB. vanilla. One of my kids that said he hated mangoes and peaches in anything but as plain fruit with my persuasion gave in and though added sugar guzzled the cup. I think it was the vanilla flavoring in this that really helped the taste.

Didn't have vanilla soy milk so just used 1 percent and added a tiny bit of vanilla. So good!

This was delicious! Since i didnt prepare the frozen fruits I just put some ice and blended it! I used half a cup of 1% milk and a teaspoon of vanilla extract to compensate for the vanilla soy milk. Delicious! Thanks

This is a very tropical, refreshing smoothie.  I froze 1/2 of a fresh peach and 1/2 of a mango together and then made 1 serving of the smoothie with skim milk, orange juice, and 2 packets of Splenda.  It was so thick I had a hard time getting it blended, but it sure was worth the effort and the wait!  Delicious!

For peri-menopausal women -- this is great!!! Add ground flaxseeds and FROZEN fruit (included in other comments).  The soy and flax will serve as sources of estrogen. Prepare and drink daily for nutritious, delicious benefits.

I initially gave this smoothie 3 stars because I used canned peaches!  I wrote the following:  

This smoothie was good but not exceptional.  I didn't really like the flavor combination.  I think freezing the fruit is a must for this recipe because when it's not cold, it's really gritty from the mango.

Now I change my mind and give it 5 stars.  The secret is in using fresh peaches.  It was slightly tart and sweet.  I did add ice because I like mine really cold. Thanks and sorry about the previous rating.

Nice flavor, just the right amount of sweetness. I added 2 tbsp of ground flax for extra nutrition and a 1/4 cup of vanilla yogurt as I only had regular milk, no vanilla soy. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Tried the recipe as is with frozen peaches instead of fresh.  It was SUPER!  Will definitely make again!  It tasted like it had added sugar even though it didn't.

MMMM, SO yummy and very refreshing (especially on an unusually hot March day!!).  I had to make mine strictly 'mango' as I did not have peaches and used frozen mango chunks in place of fresh.  Fantastic, can't wait to make this one again - tomorrow sounds good to me!

I really liked this, but my kids and husband did not.  I did have to use canned peaches, but I don't think that the rest of my family is a fan of mangos.  Still a really good recipe and a great way to get kids to try new things.

Really good! However, with no fresh fruit on hand, I substituted a peach with 1/2 cup peach yogurt and the mango with one scoop mango ice cream (which had mango chunks in it). With the vanilla soymilk and OJ, it came out amazing... very creamy and not too sweet.

This was really good.  I had no soy milk on hand so I substituted 2% milk.  Also, I added a little liquid honey to increase the sweetness a little. I used frozen mango and keep that on hand just to use in a smoothie

This recipe was very delicious and I don't even like peaches or mangos, but somehow this turned out great! I made it without substituting anything, but I added in a little bit of sugar to sweeten it.

I thought this was rather good, but I had to make quite a bit of changes. I didn't have vanilla soy milk, so I used low-fat milk and I added a few drops of vanilla extract and some Truvia sweetener. I ended up using up to 3 packets, or more than I normally do. When I first blended it, it had kind of a fiberous texture which I have never experienced with a smoothie. I have also never used mango in one either. To change the texture I added 6 ice cubes and had to blend at least 3 times as long as other smoothies to get it smooth. After all that it was good, but I would have been just as happy eating the fresh mango. It is not something I buy often, was a little expensive, and was nice and sweet. Thank you for the drink combination idea though. Peaches are great in smoothies.

Delicious! I started making this and then realized I didn't have peaches, but I did have apricots that needed to be used up anyway so I substituted those instead.  I have no doubt htis would be just as tasty with the peaches. The mango flavor came through just fine, and it just an all around great summer smoothie. Thanks for sharing!

It was Okay. We messed up on the blending part and didn't blend it long enough. Also, you should peel the peach because all of the peach peels showed in the smoothie.

I used frozen mango and canned peaches. It was OK, but a bit tart. A little honey would have helped. I think I prefer these fruits with a ripe banana for some added sweetness. It was very smooth.

5.6.17   Mango and peach is a good combination for a smoothie.  Used frozen fruit, so the consistency was how I like it, a bit on the thick side.  Nice mid-morning snack.

I used 1/2 cup Greek yogurt instead of milk.  I added about 6 ice cubes. 
It came out thick , creamy, and very tasty. My expert six year old loves it.

Great tasting smoothie recipe!  I used frozen mangos and peaches.  I also used vanilla almond milk in place of soy.  Very tasty!

Made this with coconut and almond milk, and used only half of the orange juice.  Delicious!

Good tropical flavor.  Pretty thick so had to add more orange juice and soy milk but the kids liked it so I considered that a big win.  I added wheat germ to my portion.  Would definitely make again.

I made this smoothie just as the recipe stated.  I felt that the consistency was a little too thick and slightly mushy.  I tried adding a little extra OJ, but it didn't really help.  The smoothie was very filling, which I liked, but I won't make it again.  Just okay for me.

Our family has a smoothie everyday in the summer with all the fresh fruit. Here is how we do it. I pour a tad of juice- for easy blending we usually have orange mango in the fridge. Add a good yogurt cup or 8 oz- I keep a lot of vanilla/honey Noosa in fridge for this and just empty the container. When fruits are fresh I throw whatever -like berries- strawberries blueberries raspberries- maybe a peach or mango and blend. Sometimes I add a squirt of honey. 
If you use frozen fruit it makes it "icy" but you can also add a hand full of crushed ice from frig for that. Healthy delicious!!

Delicious! Something helpful I've learned is that peach skins can be easily removed by inserting the peach in boiling water for a minute or two (depending on how soft they are).  The skins will slide right off!

I used fresh fruit and found out it was too much of a room temperature to really enjoy...so I had to refrigerate it for awhile.  Next time...I'll put the fresh fruit in the fridge to get it cold.
