Good recipe foundation here.. I used Rice Chex because that is what I had on hand and I made it the consistency of panko crumbs. I seasoned the chicken pieces with salt and pepper before coating. I also seasoned the crumbs with a few spices. The recipe might turn out a little bland if there was no seasoning. The pieces came out super crispy and it was delightful. The kids really liked it too!

I made this while my Mom was visiting (she has full blown celiac disease) and they were a total hit!! The chicken was really soft and tender and my kids loved it too! Definitely prefer rice flour over gluten free flour, which I find quite dense. I made another round and froze them so that we could pull them out as needed for quick dinners before soccer practice.

We used gluten free bread crumbs instead of cereal, and everyone in the family was in LOVE with this fun "kid friendly" meal. My husband added a little Cajun seasoning to the flour mix for one breast's worth of nuggets. The extra pop of flavor made this an "adult friendly" treat, too!

The first time we made this we had some gluten-free bread crumbs we wanted to use; everyone loved it.  I also used a basic gluten-free flour blend instead of plain rice flour.  This time we followed the recipe using Corn Chex and they liked it even more (if that is somehow possible).  I left the Chex in the bag and crushed it with a rolling pin instead of the processor.  Such a nice tasty nugget and the gluten version is not missed!

Yummy! I have extremely picky kids and this was the first meal in a long time everyone stayed at the table because they were EATING!  I love the crunch from the Chex.  Next time Iâ€™ll add seasoned salt to the rice flour and I want to see I can bake them and get a similar (but healthier) result.

I use the gluten free brown rice flour to coat the chicken and fry in either grape seed oil or olive oil.  Delicious!
