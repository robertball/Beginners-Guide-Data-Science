I've been making tortilla pizzas for a long time and any sauce or topping is fine,but let me add this... to start flip tortilla over and spray with veg. spray of your choice and sprinkle with either parm. cheese or corn meal. flip, put on baking sheet and add your toppings. easy to remove and really adds something. just a tip.

Quick and easy for a light lunch! I opted to leave off the onion and green pepper and keep it simple. I used Roma tomatoes that I lightly salted, added some cracked black pepper and minced garlic along with the mozzarella cheese. When it was done I topped it with fresh basil and drizzled a little olive oil over top - YUM!

Very easy, tasty, quick meal.  We replaced the green pepper with sliced portabello mushrooms and olive oil instead of canola oil (personal preferences).  I look forward to trying other toppings combos in the future!
We also diced the tomatoes instead of slicing them.  Wonderful light dinner along with a side salad - we will have this many times to come.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very, very good. I was running low on materials, so I replaced the onion and pepper with pepperoni, and used sliced circles of mozzarella instead of shredded. It turned out wonderfully!

Because I have carnivores in the family, I used 6 ounces of ground round to saute with the onion and green paper, and also tossed in a 1/2 Tbsp of home-made taco seasoning mix along with the oregano and garlic powder, which all cooked together. Then I put 1/4 of the mix onto a 10" flour tortilla, covered with the tomato and cheese mixture, folded each one over, and baked for 8 minutes. Great, easy-to-make finger food on a busy week-day night.

This little concoction was delicious! So simple to make and can be made a lot of different ways! I sauted in cooking spray to cut out some fat.

This pizza is delicious, easy to make, and very cheap, too! It couldn't get any better with this combination; the prices may vary, but for us, making 12 servings of this would only cost us $15, and even less for the future because the oregano and garlic powder can be reused. We added personally sliced pepperoni, and that made a heck of a difference because without that meat, we probably wouldn't have enjoyed it as much ;) We're going to try mushrooms next time we make it!!! This is a definite recommendation!

I used red pepper and mushrooms on mine instead of onions and green peppers. YUMMY! Great recipe - thanks! My entire family loved it.

Perfect lunch! Used red peppers instead of green and a Vidalia onion. Olive oil instead of canola and fresh garlic instead of powder. I also added a cup of fresh sliced mushrooms. Added some dried basil to the tomatoes. Slight modifications to a very good recipe.

Very easy, and a refreshing light lunch.  I really liked these, but my hubby and two sons were not as enthused as I was, which is why I am giving this only four stars.

These were OK.  I used extra thick Gordita style tortilla shells, brushed them with EVO, added fresh basil, garlic and Parmesan but both my wife and I thought they still lacked something.  In all, it's a real quick, relatively healthy meal and beats most anything poured out of a can.

This was just as good as I thought it would be.  It would taste great with a little bit of seasoned chicken on it as well to be more filling.

I added chicken (3 boneless skinless tighes cooked and cubed) I used yellow bell pepper instead of green. Very good and the chicken was a plus for my family. Thank you for sharing.

This was good but needed more seasoning or something.  The tomatoes made the tortillas soggy after a couple of minutes so you have to eat it fast!  Fresh basil would be a great addition to this!

used olive oil instead of canola, baby bella mushrooms and red pepper instead of onions and green pepper, really delicious -the very light seasonings work to make it a light, delicate, enjoyable lunch, with a side salad.
