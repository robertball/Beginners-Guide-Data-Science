Hooray for Grampa! I make this now so often I have the recipe memorized. I use it for turkey burgers. A great addition is to chop some fresh basil and mix that up in there too. And, yes, it still tastes great if you cook it and eat it right away!

I have been trying to cook healthier, but wanted a heartier breakfast sometime, and I came across this recipe. I had 1 lb of ground turkey in the fridge, so it was perfect. It tasted pretty close to what I know as sausage, but boy was it peppery! When I measured out the spices I tried to use level spoons of the spices, because I was worried about all the pepper, red and black. To make even sized patties, I used a 1 tablespoon cookie scoop and did 2 scoops per patty and made 10. I am not sure how to change this, with the pepper. It might be just me, but whenever I have bought store bought patties I always bought the maple brown sugar sausage patties, if they have them. I may just like a sweeter breakfast sausage. But, they all got eaten.

Used sage instead of coriander. Broiled in oven 4 minutes per side and topped with cheese. Absolutely fabulous! Tastes exactly like sausage but without the calories and fat.

Per other reviewers, I cut back the pepper to 1/2 teaspoon. I did add 1/2 teaspoon of rubbed sage. I made no other changes or substitutions. I used my 1/4 dry measuring cup to make uniform sized burgers. I just patted the mixture into the measuring cup, then plopped it out and formed into a patty. I didn't need the olive oil to brown them--I used my George Foreman Grill. Very easy--very tasty. My sons and I ate every single one of these. I'll use this recipe again and again.

Usually I change recipes to suit my own tastes, but this one I left as is and the outcome was phenomenal! This tastes just like normal sausage, my boyfriend couldn't even tell I had used turkey. I used this in stuffed mushrooms as well as in a strata and it was perfect. I am going to make my own sausage all the time now! And the added bonus is I don't have to feel guilty eating it!

This is are really yummy recipe. I sometimes change up the spices, adding sage, clove and ginger. It's just the taste that I have been looking for. Sweet, but not too sweet.

Yum!! So easy and delicious. Cooked some of these up with roasted potatoes, roasted broccoli and fried eggs... a great 'comfort meal' for a chilly evening. The coriander really does make it taste like sausage! I ground up whole seeds... lots of 'em. :)

I love this recipe.  Have made it a number of times and now use it in my lasagne that calls for sausage.  We can't have too much salt so I cut the salt.  We really like fennel and now I add 1 1/2 tsp of fennel.  If you don't like it too spicy hot, I suggest you halve the cayenne and add more if you like.  My non stick pan handles this without the oil.

Love this recipe - we make it with 5 lbs of ground turkey at a time (use the adjust recipe feature - makes 20 servings).  We mix it up in our Kitchenaid Mixer with the dough hook - placing turkey in first then adding all spices and seasonings.  We do cut back on the peppers a bit, just our preference - but love it both ways!  We scoop up 1/4 cup at a time, form into patties, place them on parchment lined baking sheets and freeze for several hours.  When frozen, we fold them into the parchment - to keep the patties separate - and place all in zip lock freezer bags.  So much better and healthier than the nasty stuff found in the freezer aisle in the supermarket.

This is wonderful sausage....tons of flavor!!!  Followed the recipe exactly and I will be for many years to come.  I love that it's made with turkey so not quite as fattening but still gives the satisfaction of eating sausage!  Thanks for posting.

I used 93/7 ground turkey, so I knew that if even slightly overcooked, it would be dry.  I watched it closely and, fortunately, it was cooked just right yielding moist patties.  I was out of cayenne, so I substituted red pepper flakes which worked great.  I liked the flavor of this sausage, but one thing I would consider in the future would be the addition of sage.  Grampa, you did a good job on this healthier version of breakfast sausage!

The seasonings in this are really good - spot on.  My only complaint from hubby was that is was a bit dry - I used very lean ground turkey.   Crumbled in a breakfast casserole will be really good I am sure.   Thanks for sharing your special recipe with us.

These sausages were great! They tasted as good as regular sausage, but without the fat and nitrates. They were easy to put together and heated up well for lunch the next day. I'll definitely be making them again.

Delicious and so easy to make! I made this nearly as written (I was out of town and didn't have any cayenne...ended up using crushed red pepper). I was skeptical to make this recipe because I'm used to adding sage and other seasonings along with some maple syrup, but I really liked the flavor of these turkey sausage patties. I think the coriander is perfect in this recipe and a spice I would not have thought to use when making turkey sausage patties. I also loved the brown sugar in these that I swear helps the patties brown nicely and lends a subtle hint of sweet. I formed my patties a little smaller and yielded 6 patties. I used 93% lean ground turkey and didn't have a problem with the patties getting dry. I was going to rate these four stars because while my husband liked these, he said he prefers the other recipe I usually make. Oh well, I loved these too so more for me and none for him! So, a 5 star rating in my book, and a 4 in his book. :) Thanks for sharing your FIL's recipe, FrackFamily5! I look forward to making a large batch of these in the future!

This was excellent! My husband isn't a fan of breakfast sausage due to sage and other spices so this one was a big winner in his book too.  This recipe is super simple and bursting with flavor. I've actually made quite a few of this recipe submitter's recipes and they've all been great!

The flavor was outstanding and browned beautifully.  What a great alternative to store bought that’s packed with much higher levels of sodium than what this recipe calls for.

Easy to make and good flavor!  Added a few additional spices to our liking.  Family was 1/2 fans & 1/2 not convinced due to texture.

I didn't think I would like this recipe as I am not a fan of ground turkey. This is really good though.  I baked it in the oven and cut into slices. It is really flavorful and tastes delicious. Thank you for sharing Grandpa's recipe:)

Really good sausage. One thing I'll do different is less salt and peppers. Was a little too hot for my taste and a bit on the salty side. I also added a bit of onion powder and garlic powder.

It was so dry and boring.  If I make again, it needs some spice and also would be better as a filler when recipes call for sausage such as lasagna.

Turned out a little tough and dry.   Maybe mixed too long or cooked too long.  Will cook the remainder a little shorter time.  Flavor was good.

I made this for breakfast this morning and we both really loved it. I know it's called coriander sausage and it sure stands out in the flavor. I had around 1/3 pound or so of ground turkey so maybe the ratios were a little off. I normally don't do this when I try a new recipe but, I added a pinch of sage. We had this sausage with omelets and British muffins and they were great together. Hopefully next time that I make this it will be with a full pound of ground turkey and let it rest in the refrigerator over night. All in all it was a great substitute for store bought pork sausage. Definitely a keeper!

Made this turkey sausage the other day then forgot about it so it sat in the fridge for 2 days.  Next time I make this I'm going to up the seasoning and add sage.  I use the leaner turkey to cut back on the fat content and only used 1/2 tsp black pepper.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.
