I was very skeptical about this recipe.  I've always eaten avacados in guacamole or as a sandwich spread...but never in a "dessert" form.  Suprisingly enough, this was really good.  Very rich and creamy.  My husband was actually the one who made this for me.  This is how he grew up eating avacados...so he considers them to be like a fruit rather than a vegetable.  We didn't add the sugar or the other ingredients...only avacados and condensed milk.  All I can say is "don't knock it till ya try it!"  Thanks L.

I never would have guessed this would be good!  I was looking for something to do with a couple of avocados before they were over-ripe and found this.  I used heavy whipping cream cuz that's what I had, and I threw in a banana for kicks as well as some plain yogurt...

I wish this recipe turned out great because of the orginality of such a recipe, but it just did not do it for me. I love avacados and sweetened condensed milk, but not together. But, Thanks for giving me a chance to try something different!

I grew up with avocado milkshakes.  However, we always put vanilla ice cream in ours, so I just added a few scoops.  Very good!  Thanks for the recipe!

As a unabashed avocado junkie, I was hopeful.  When the shake came out the consistency of pudding, I triple checked the recipe to make sure I wasn't missing some liquid, shrugged, and served it in bowls.  My 3-year-old and I had the same reaction.  Our initial enthusiam diminished in direct proportion to the quantity consumed.  Some ingredient (milk powder?) left a perceptible micro-crunchiness I could feel in my molars.  Perhaps we would have enjoyed it more if we hadn't tried it solo.  I really liked the creaminess of the avocado and appreciate the idea of adding it to other smoothies.

This was so yummy. I was surprised that it tasted so good. I couldn't even tell that it had avacado in it. I did add a banana to it. I gave some to my kids while they were watching a movie. It was dark and they couldn't see that it was green, and they all drank some and liked it. I will definitely make this again.

This was great - and I'm not an avocado fan at all. I left out the dry milk and it was just fine. Really complements a tangy, spicy meal as it's blandly sweet in an avocado-y way - had it with marinated steak, asparagus, and stuffed portabello mushrooms and it was really refreshing during the meal. Thanks for a unique drink!

I have not tried this recipe but wanted to share how we make it in southern Brazil: just blend some avocado with milk and sugar to taste. You freeze the milk or add a little bit of ice if you prefer it super cold. It's creamy and delicious!

I am an avocado fanatic and so I thought I would absolutely love this. I omitted the dry milk and added regular milk and really liked the consistency. The flavor was ok. I think my brain is so programmed to eat the avocado as a savory food and not a sweet food, that it made this shake really odd. I think if I drink enough of them, I could get used to it. :)

I saw this recipe and knew I had to try it, but I did not have many of the ingredients... So this is what I did for 1 portion: 1 avocado 1 c milk 1 c ice 2 tsp sugar 1 tsp vanilla extract The result was like a creamy milkshake with a slight hint of avocado. Delicious!

At first I loved it and couldn't get enough, but then all of a sudden it was just TOO much avocado in one dose.  I LOVE avocados but I could not stomach much of this.  I think it was all the sweetness.  I dipped some fresh fruit in it to try and eat it up.  It was a good idea for a recipe.

I substituted the milk powder with regular milk and it turned out really good.  My mom used to make this for me all the time; it's very popular among the Vietnamese who usually drizzle their avocados with condensed milk or eat it with sugar.  I heard the Indonesians also do the same thing except they drizzle Hershey's syrup down the side of the glass.

I made this recipe exactly as it called for and it made an excellent PUDDING. For a milkshake consistency, add milk, more ice, more sweet condensed milk and omit milk powder. However, this sacrifices the avocado flavour.

This is awesome, I am not one for Avocado's but this is good.  K so I didn't use ice, took them, pitted them, put them in a blender x2, added milk sugar and drank it Mmmmmm so good.  Filling so you decrease your appetite too.  I give this two thumbs up for taste, and for curbing ones appetite :)
