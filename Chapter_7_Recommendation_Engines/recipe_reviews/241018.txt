This screams healthy! The few strawberries it had did give it a muddied color so just for eye appeal I doubled the spinach giving a greener smoothie and much more appetizing look although the smoothie was delicious before that. I didn't have tofu so I tossed in some cashew milk.

The ingredients for this smoothie are great tasting together.  I am not a sugar fan, but I did add some ground stevia leaf to sweeten it up.  I only gripe here would  be thinking that this drink was protein packed with 1 ounce of tofu.  It does have protein with it but is not high in amount. I ended up adding a scoop of my own unsweetened, unflavored soy protein powder which also added thickness.  Overall the flavor is very good.  But if you are looking for a one dish meal of veggie/protein, it is lacking.  Thank you for the recipe!
