what a complete mess.  i should have suspected from the directions that it didn't make sense to put all the sugar with the apples.  needed some of the sugar to beat with the eggs and oil.  a complete flop, the cake is caved in all around the bundt pan and what a waste of ingredients.

I took the advice favoring putting only part of the sugar with the apples. I put a half of cup, and the rest I mixed with the eggs and vanilla. The cake was great. It was light, moist, and flavorful. I sprinkled it with confectionary sugar. Would definitely recommend it.

I absolutely love this recipe.  I made it first for Christmas dinner.  I made up an easy little icing of cream cheese, apples and walnuts along with powdered sugar and a splash of milk.  My 2 brothers said it was the best cake ever.  In fact, my sister and I always have a "competition" and I was crowned champ :).  This past weekend I made the cake again along with my icing for some family that was visiting - we actually had it while it was still warm and the icing was gooey - OH MY GOSH - it was delish.

In 50 + years of baking. I think the problem is in the way it is put together, with all the sugar being added to the apples and not the batter first.

My Apple Walnut Cake turned out a beautiful, moist and flavorsome cake. However I did take some readers' advice and beat half the sugar with the eggs and oil and combined the other half with the apples. Also, I reduced the quantity of sugar from 2 cups to 1 1/2 cups, but that i guess is a matter of personal taste. All in all, a great recipe and a scrumptious cake.

I came across this recipe when I was in a pinch on Christmas Eve.  All the ingredients were items I already had on hand, it was convenient, quick, and absolutely delicious!  I don't understand what the fuss is about, I followed the recipe precisely and it came out perfect!  It's definately going to be a new holiday tradition in my family.  Everyone loved it!

This cake was fantastic.  I made it just as the directions indicated, and it was wonderful.  Not TOO sweet.  Was very easy to make also.

I was scared to try this cake because of some of the other reviews, but it turned out really good. I made a caramel glaze for it and that added a nice flavor.

I made this cake, but changed the process.  Mixed the sugar, flour, soda, cinnamon and salt together. Beat the eggs, oil and vanilla separately, then added to flour mixture. Batter is very thick. Then I added the apples and nuts and poured/spread into a 9X13 pan and baked for 40 minutes. It was perfect.

I made the apple walnut cake for Christmas, it turned out tasty, but dry. When i made the dough, i felt like sth. was missing, it was not moist enough then already. Overall it turned out good...

I think this is a fantastic recipe.  When I was younger my first job was in a bakery, and they used to sell an apple walnut cake.  They would never give me the recipe, but this one is the one I've been searching for forever!  I did take the suggestion of beating half the sugar with the oil and eggs, and it turned out perfect.  I didn't have a bunt pan, so I used a nine-inch spring form pan.  It worked, but the center was a little burnt, so I would definitely reccomend using the bunt pan.  The batter looks as if it's going to be very dry, but the moisture from the apples keeps it moist.  I topped it with dulce de leche (sort of like caramel) and crushed walnuts.  It's delicious

Very moist, and it looked exactly as in the picture. Everyone in my office loved it. But the only problem was I could not taste the apple but everything else. I could definetaly tasted the sugar so maybe next time I will put less sugar. But other than that my coworkers enjoyed it!

I used 1/2 sugar as well on the apples, other half I used brown sugar, also substituted applesauce for oil for a bit more healthier, very moist and turned out nice and dark with the brown sugar. No need for icing!

I've used my family apple cake recipe for years.  I've switched to this one:  it has the same ingredients but more apple and less oil.  Seems like a win all the way around.  I did increase the walnuts to 1 1/2 cups.  

The cake has a beautiful rise and a dark crust that hides the nut and apple filled cake.

I wish I would have read the reviews first. The directions did not make sense to me but I figured since I had not made it myself maybe I should  just follow the way it was posted. Wrong! There is probably 1/3 of it still in the greased and floured Bundt pan. I have no idea how it tastes so I cannot comment on that. Those of you who were smarter than I and split up the sugar, or mixed all the dry together then incorporated in the wet, way to go. I gave this 3 stars only because, as I mentioned, I have not tasted it so I wanted to be fair.

This was absolutely delicious. I used a "generous" cup of nuts because I really like nuts; but made no other changes. It was excellent. Moist, not too sweet; gone before I could take a picture!

Very easy recipe. I also took the advice from the comments and divided  the sugar between the egg mixture and the apples.  The cake came out perfect, even though I forgot to add the walnuts. Served it with vanilla ice cream and homemade caramel sauce!!!  Will be my new go to recipe and dessert for Thanksgiving!!! Another comment is that is was very moist and everyone in my family loved it, my granddaughter couldn't stop saying how much she loved it!!

Great cake I did what others suggested with the sugar the only thing 
I did different was adding a splash of fresh cider to the chopped
Apple's. Next time I make it I will not bake it for sixty minutes but
Will check it at 55! Cake was moist and light.I did dust it with powdered
Sugar but a glaze would top if off! DELISH!! Oh, I added a half cup raisins..Yum!

Have made this cake many times through the years. I was taught to core and chop the apples, pour all of sugar over apples and refrigerate for an hour. This way apples and sugar make their own juice making cake very dense and moist.

I found this recipe to be horrible!  Maybe because it didn't state how large the apples should be chopped.  I did measure carefully, as the recipe prompted; thoroughly greased & floured my bundt pan, but the cake fell apart when I tried to remove it.  I was planning to take it to a party, but had to go to the trouble of making something else.  And, I'm not a bad baker; in fact, I've received praise for my treats when I bring them and have won a blue ribbon for a recipe I submitted to a contest in a local newspaper.All those expensive ingredients, all the work, and I ended up with a mess which my husband wants me to throw away, and I probably will, as I'm diabetic.
I was thoroughly disappointed, to say the least!
