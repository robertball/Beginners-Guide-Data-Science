Fun to make and fun to eat.  I made a few changes.  I took the advice of other reviews and cut the butter in half.  Instead of using a thermometer I just brought the mixture to a boil and boiled it for 4 minutes.  Then I added 1/4 teaspoon baking soda and baked it at 250 degrees for 1/2 hour, stirring once while baking.  This made the popcorn drier and crispier which is the way we like it.

So yummy!  my neighbor and I made like 10 batches of all different flavors of jello.  Then we mixed it all in a big tub and put them in snack size baggies to give out at Halloween.  With all the different colors they looked great!  Did learn a lot after so many batches:   use half the butter and only 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup.  Let the mixture come to a boil and then boil for 4 minutes STIRRING OFTEN!  This was easier than dealing with the candy thermometer for me.  This will be a family tradition and I can't wait until my girls are old enough to help make this with me!

I was totally new to the idea of making flavored popcorn so I tried a few different recipes.  I tried this one, the Kraft Gelatin-based Recipe (on their website), and a traditional crunchy candy coated popcorn recipe available searching the web.  This one was the least to our liking.

This project is messy, so in my opinion I would opt for the one that produces the best result for the work involved.  To me that is a crunchy popcorn kernel with wonderful custom flavor.  

Gelatin-based recipes tasted, well, gelatinous.  THey were gooey, gummy, and stick-in your teeth tacky.

The traditional candymaking version which included making a candy coating (sugar, butter, corn syrup, flavored oil) removing the mixture from the heat to add baking soda, coating the popcorn, baking for an hour and stirring periodically produced exactly what I expected.  The result was crispy, crunchy, sweet flavored kernels that could be easily broken up before storing.  It was just like opening a box of crunchy cracker jacks or Poppycock, except the recipe yielded loads and loads for very little money.

To sum up, there are much better recipes out there.  This gets two stars for initially peaking my interest in the item and helping to educate me on the process of making my own addictive popcorn snacks, but I won't be using it again.

Very good.  I changed the butter & sugar also.  I also baked at 250 for 30 min, stirring once.  Do not use sugar-free jello - it doesn't work.

I reduced the butter as suggested by other reviewers.  This was really good I ended up doing three batches of green apple, watermelon, and berry blue.  Mixed all together and yum.  I think it was easier to mix in a big bowl first though, the popcorn was coated better.

This was very good. I only used about 9 cups of popcorn and like others said, cut the butter in half. I used cherry Jello and you could taste the cherry.  I also followed the advice of another reviewer and added baking soda. The result was a crispy dry popcorn that you usually find on boardwalks and at fairs.   I also baked it for about 40 minutes and that dried it out even more and made the taste pop.  I am anxious to try try other flavors.  This will be a good recipe to use at Halloween. I plan on using berry, pineapple, peach, orange and pina colada. I will also make grape but add a few drops of purple food coloring so it does not turn grey.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

Wow! This stuff is great. I too cut down the butter, though not QUITE by half. (Instead of 1 cup, I used 1/2 cup + 2 Tbsp.) So far I've done watermelon, cran-raspberry, apple, berry blue, and cherry. I have a question for all you more experienced candy makers out there, though. How the heck do I get it to hardball stage without scorching the sugar on the bottom?

I'm giving this 5 stars because it's super yummy and relatively easy once you get the hang of it.  I've made 10 batches now for 4th of July....cherry and berry blue.  (The blue looked more like teal on the popcorn, though...just in case you plan on using blue).  I did find that margarine worked just as well as butter (used 1/2 cup as suggested by others) and I didn't need all the sugar..it's sweet enough with just 1/2 cup.  Didn't use the thermometer.  I just boiled it for 3 minutes & baked it at 250.  Very fun and yummy treat!

very Pleased. Kids wanted to make popcorn balls. I didn't have enough corn syrup. I had this recipe saved. Tried it. The kids were happy. Fruit flavor and looked and tasted yummy. I also used 1/2 the butter and sugar.

I LOVE this recipe!  It is always a favorite around Halloween and Christmas!  All the flavors are good.  Although, the grape didn't turn out as well as I had hoped.  It looked gray and didnt have a real grape taste.

This one is great! I must admit I was a little leary of gelatin on my popcorn but I admit I have been pleasantly surprised.  I like to seperate into batches using different flavored gelatin for a nice layered display in a clear glass bowl.

We buy flavored popcorn from a little shop that's about 2 hours away from us!  It's very expensive, but delicious; I'll never buy it there again because this recipe tastes amazing!!  My brother & husband think this is even better than the store's!   I've made the berry blue, island pineapple (add a tsp of coconut flavoring to make it pina colada), strawberry (add a tsp of strawberry flavoring), & raspberry (also added a tsp of raspberry flavoring) so far!  I planning on making several different flavors at a time to add extra fun to parties & giving this as gifts!!  Everyone that has tried it LOVES it!!  :)  Thanks so much for sharing!

I absolutely love this recipe!!!  I have made this many times using different flavors.  Every time I make it I wish I had made 2 batches at once since it never lasts long.  One batch is gone in 3 sittings!  My only problem making this is that I have glass cookware and the sugar burns on the bottom of the pan somewhere over 200 degrees but I can't taste it so it's not a big deal except when cleaning the pot.  I always only use 1 stick of butter.  My favorite way to cook this is when I add 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda to the mixture after taking it off the heat but before pouring over the popcorn.  I like it just fine without the added baking soda so on the times I forget to add it it's still very good.  I bake it for 30 minutes after adding the sugar mixture and never make into popcorn balls or turn it out on foil.  Ideally, I want to eat an all raw diet (fruits, veggies, nuts, sprouts, and seeds, etc.) but recipes like this break my will power!!!

ATTENTION: You'll want to read this!! To cut down on the mess take a roaster out of it's warmer and put the popcorn in it. It holds all of it very well and fits in an oven just fine. This allows you to stir it without making a mess too. Plus you don't have to divide it up so it's much easier to handle.

Really good twist to a popcorn treat!  I used Berry Fusion Jello (which is blackberry and raspberry flavored). I also just used 3 bags of lightly buttered microwave popcorn; it is a good salty, sweet combination.  Will make again trying other flavors.

This is a fun recipe!  I reduced the margarine to 1/2 cup and took MTEDWARDS advice to just let the whole thing boil (keep stirring) for 4 min, then remove from heat and add 1/2 tsp soda.  Much easier than messing with a candy thermometer.  Oh ya, I also upped the popcorn to about 20 cups, so that it wasn't so sickenly sweet.  Still lots of flavor and it turned out nice and crispy.

This is so fun! I used orange jell-o and threw in about 1/3 of a bag of vanilla baking chips! Delicious! I didn't hold mine in the oven. I shook it up in a paper bag (where I kept the popcorn warm) to distribute the flavor!

This was a real let down.  I made it for a team BBQ in lime and lemon.  Lots of people tried a nibble but no one went for more and I threw most of it out.  I followed the recipe with the alterations exactly but it just tasted weird.  Along with all of the clean up involved this recipe will not be used again that is for sure!

So glad I found this recipe!  Took the advice of everyone else and used 1/2 c butter and reduced the sugar to 1/2 c.  I also added 1/4 tsp. baking soda when I took the candy coating off of the heat.  I cooked for 35 minutes at 250, stirring twice.  At first I didn't think it would turn out crips and crunchy like I wanted it.  It just needed a few minutes to cool off and it was perfect!  Brings me back to childhood and I'm so happy to share it with my 4 yr old daughter.

Really yummy candied popcorn! Changes I made to the recipe: used 2 Tbsp Coconut Oil to 1/2 Cup unpopped kernels. Picked out any unpopped kernels. Used 1/2 cup unsalted butter, reduced water to 2 Tbsp, added 10 drops more food coloring to brighten the finished look. Added 10 drops of sour drops to brighten the fruity flavors.  Cooked the syrup for 4 minutes after boiling. Removed from heat and stirred in 1/4 tsp baking soda. The 300 degree oven was just too hot. It caramelized the candy. I dropped the temp to 240 and left the popcorn in for 1/2 hour to dry it out. After these changes, I am thrilled with the light, tangy-sweet crisp texture and beautiful color.

Used 1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, 1/2 cup sugar and the rest of the ingredients as indicated. Didn't use a thermometer. When mixture started to boil, I started a timer and boiled for 4 minutes exactly. I had the popcorn in a large bowl and poured the mixture on top, stirred to coat evenly and then pour the popcorn in the greased baking pan in the oven at 250 for about 30-40 minutes stirring every 10 minutes. I used strawberry gelatin and I liked how it turned out.

This was much easier than I'd imagined. I did some modifications as suggested by others, 1/2 C butter and a more popcorn. I also added 1 Tbsp of honey. I think 10min was a little long in my oven, but that could just be me. I made this for my son's Kindergarten class, used strawberry jello & added a spoon full of milk chocolate chips to each serving after it had cooled. They all loved it! We'll be doing this again I'm sure.

With some tweaking, could probably be much better, but was not a nice 'glazed' fruit flavor like expected. Too strong (used raspberry) and sugary as well. Won't be making again.

Not a fan of the fruit flavor.  I did lime and pineapple fusion.  Did not enjoy the taste and my 2 sons wouldn't eat it.  I may head to the store to do a different flavor.

Just recently made this recipe for a family fun night.  I made it just the way it said at first.  I love butter, but this was too much b/c the popcorn was pretty soggy.  It's also a reallly strong flavor.  I think next time I'll take others' advice and cut the butter in half, and I think I'll also cut the gelatin in half too.  It has the potential to be really delicious.  YOu just have to tweak it to your liking, just like everything else!

This recipe was very cool we had a lot of fun making it.  I modified a little bit and only used 1/3 c butter and I did not roll into balls instead I lightly mixed th epopcorn with the sugar mix and the peices got partially coated.  It was great just like the flavored popcorn at the mall.  One note though, I live in a very humid area and by mid-day the popcorn all started to melt together.  Dry days would be best for this treat.

I made this the way as directed and then with the decrease in butter. The decrease in butter was the winner. The difference is the crispiness. The 1 cup of butter gives it a gummy sort of texture. We mixed them together and it was still a hit. We made cherry and blue raspberry. The kids loved it.

Strange but good. It was really sticky when it came out of the oven but immediately cooled and hardened. I used more than 10 cups of popcorn, probably more like 14 and per other recs, used a little more than 1/2 cup butter instead of 1 cup. Kids liked it and think it will make a great gift around the holidays.

This was easy and tasty.  I used cherry jello and only 1/2 cup of sugar.  It was crunchy and sweet.  Can't wait to make a lot of different flavors.  Thanks!

I think this recipe is excellent, although I did change some things due to other readers suggestions.  I only used a half a cup plus about a tablespoon of butter, and when I turned off the heat I added about a quarter to a half a teaspoon of baking soda.  I also baked it at 250 degrees for about a half hour stirring in between.  Turned out great!

Very messy to work with but fun.  I made this with my niece and it really sugared her up!  She spent more time licking the gelatin off her fingers.  My dad, who is not keen to sweet things, had more than three helpings!

This recipe called for WAY too much butter.  Traditional popcorn ball recipes call for very little or no butter, so I was really surprised when this one called for so much.  You figure that you have to put in 1 cup of butter for only 10 popcorn balls, that's a ton of butter per serving.  I tried it anyway, and they were so buttery that they were unedible.  I think I will try the recipe again, but with more corn syrup (to make them stick together better) and a whole lot less butter.

Great recipe.  I thought it was really quick and easy.  Having a candy thermometer is helpful.  It was crunchy and flavorful.  I did cut back a little on the butter & sugar (1 1/2 sticks of butter & 3/4 cup of sugar).  Big hit at a party - mixed ages.  Hubby wants me to make it again with different flavors.

Yum!!  I followed the other advice and changed the butter and sugar and added baking soda.  We made peach flavored which I thought would be gross, but its really good!  I think next time I will make a little less popcorn because it didn't get all covered.  Can't wait to try more flavors!!

I madethis withgrap Jello brand gelatin. I used only 1 stick of butter and boiled for 4 minutes, added a teensy bit of baking soda. I pured it on the popcorn, baked @300 for 5mins, stirred and bakedfor another 5mins.  It turned brown and tasted bad. Barely any grape flavorat all. Actually a little burnt. I am disappointed since my kids love this expensive stuff. I may try again, but may look for antoher recipe.

This has become a must around our house for road trips, parties, and lazy days- thanks for a great recipe! I do only use 6 Tbs butter, 1/2 cup sugar and just stir boiling for four minutes as reccomended previously. I love that this is crunchy and not sticky!

The taste is just how I remember it, but the popcorn turned out a little soggy. I had it in a 250* oven at 30 minutes as suggested, but I think next time I'm going to try it as listed in the directions. Hopefully, it will turn out crunchy!

My kids really enjoyed this recipe, especially since they were able to choose their favorite flavor of jello!  I did cut the amount of butter in half and it worked fine.  Next time I am going to try to cut back a little on the sugar as well (I found it to be really sweet, although my kids did not complain about this...what a surprise!). We plan to make two batches at Christmas - one flavored strawberry and the other lime, and mix them together.  I'm sure the red and green popcorn will be a hit at Christmas parties!  Thanks for the recipe!

I have to agree that there is too much butter, but I will definitely use this recipe again cutting the butter in half.  Yummy!

Wasn’t very crispy, but maybe I could have left it out longer. My kids loved it. Very yummy. We made Berry Blue Jello flavor.

I made this anticipating the candy popcorn that I love without the peanut oil so often used to make it. I was impressed when it was first out of the oven, but it got soggy after a couple of hours and stale by the next day.

I made it as is and almost ate it all. I'm making a second batch using someone's suggestion of half of the butter.

This came out great for me only change I made was I used my homemade corn syrup instead of store bought. It came out perfect. I didn't even try balling them up because my 14 year old son (only one I have left at home) dug into them and asked me not to make them into balls.
I used both candy  and a regular digital thermometer  and had no issues. The next time around I will try less sugar to compare sweetness. Other wise no issues at all with this. Now my wheels are turning with the possibility of flavors.

This turned out great, besides being a little chewy. But the flavor was great. Reminded me of popcorn I love to get while on vacation at a specialty shop.

Great recipe,  I did what others suggested and reduced butter to 1 stick, or 1/2 c. I also reduced sugar to 1/2 c. After cooking all ingredients for 4 minutes I added 1/2 teaspoon baking soda and then baked it in the oven,  it was not sticky to eat and so good!

I always have trouble with pouring hot things onto popcorn. Like butter.  The popcorn shrivels up.  What is the trick to keeping the popcorn normal size?

We just made this for the Psych sleepover party. We used 1/2 c butter and 1/2 c sugar and island pineapple Jello. When the mix came to a boil we boiled it, whisking constantly for 4 minutes, like another reviewer suggested. Then baked it at 300 for 10 minutes....AMAZING!!

I kind of had a kitchen disaster with this recipe. It was not the recipe's fault, just simple human error. Great Recipe to try FOR your kids, NOT WITH YOUR KIDS. You have to bring this to a boil, and you don't want little ones standing in the way when your moving around a 250 degree pot of liquid.

I used a bag of lite (works best for flavored popcorns) microwave popcorn, I cut the butter in half & only used 1/2 cup of sugar. I didn't keep the popcorn warm as I didn't see the point since it was to be heated again. I just left these in clusters...the grands really liked them...thanks!

I used only half the butter called for in the recipe (good thing since I wound up eating almost all of it in one day)!  It worked just fine, and next time I am going to try cutting back on the sugar.  I made green "Shrek" popcorn, and my 6 year old loved it.  We sprinkled it with green colored sugar for a little extra "sparkle."  Thanks Grandma Berthie, for this fun party recipe!!

My kids loved this. I did not make it in to balls - just had big chunks of this great tasting orange popcorn. Easy snack to make for kids of all ages :-)
