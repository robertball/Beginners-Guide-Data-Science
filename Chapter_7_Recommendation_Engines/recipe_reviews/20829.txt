I tried this recipe FOUR TIMES before it worked out for me.  
#1...Put everything in the bread machine except the chocolate chips.  Waited for the fruit/nut timer to go off.  TV on loud.  Missed timer.  Resulting bread sweet and moist, but chipless.
#2...Put everything in the bread machine, including chips.  Chips melted.  Had chocolate bread.  Both Boyfriend and I didn't like it.
#3...Put everything in bread machine except chips.  Waited for timer.  Added chips.  Chips STILL MELTED.  Was disgusted with self.  Threw batter away.
#4...Added all ingredients except chips to bread machine.  Selected dough only.  When dough was finished, kneaded chips into dough (it was VERY STICKY), put it in a greased and floured 10" bread pan, let it rise a bit, baked it at 350 for about a half hour.  The resulting bread was moist and nicely speckled with gooey chocolate chips.  WHEW!!!   :)

Next time I make it, I will make the dough only, knead in the chips, and then select the bake only function to bake it in the bread machine.  It cooks more evenly in the machine, it seems.  Learn from my mistakes:  if in fact you want chocolate CHIp bread, and not chocolate bread, you'll need to knead.  Best of luck and thanks Heather for your recipe.  My boyfriend is happy!!!!

My husband loves it.  I have sent tis recipe to many friends. To make it lower in fat I substituted skim milk, 2 egg whites & lower fat margarine.  I also use the basic recipe & substitue nuts & raisons for chocoloate chips. Thank you Thankyou.

This is a real good bread that isn't too sweet or heavy in fat, but has a nice chocolate flavor. I've made it many times and eat it as a desert bread with butter, heated or toasted. Good one, Heather!

I tried this recipe out on my new bread machine, and I think it turned out well.  The chocolate chips do melt during kneeding, and since I wanted chips throughout the bread I added more during the second rise cycle.  I think it would actually make a great cinnamon raison bread if I substitute raisins for chocolate chips.  My bf's only complaint was that it was a little dry, so I may experiment a little with the  ingredients to get a moister bread.

Few things I did different - I forgot to add the chocolate chips in last and added them with the wet ingredients so it turned the whole dough a chocolate brown and also made it too wet so I added more flour. I let the bread machine do the kneading but took it out for the bake cycle and added some more chocolate chips. It just came out of the oven (32 minutes at 350) and we had melty double chocolatey bread - mmmmm!! I also used 2 tblsp. vegetable oil instead of the butter because I didn't have the butter. It does have a very subtle but definently there cinnamon flavor, it almost should be called Cinammon Chocolate Chip Bread, except that I'm not a big cinnamon fan and I love this bread so that name would probably have turned me off. Next time I would wait to put the chocolate chips in - the chocolate bread is good but I think I used close to 2 cups of chocolate chips, too much to be anywhere near good for you. I would still bake it in the oven, but I would let it cool in the pan instead of taking it out right away so that we would get chocolate chips instead of a chocolate ribbon. Definently will be making again when I'm craving something chocolatey and sweet and don't have the butter to make cookies :) ! Thanks Heather!

Great bread.  Perfect texture, soft with chips swirled through.  Don't add chips until 2nd kneading.  I actually used 3/4 cup mini chips and 3/4 cup regular semi-sweet.  We love chocolate!  Just needs a pinch of cinnamon.

I cannot BELIEVE how great this turned out!!! Amazing!!!! I didn't even use bread flour, I used regular, and it still came out fantastic. I froze the chips just like the others suggested, and it worked out beautifully. It was GONE in one day! So good! Next time I will add a bit more chocolate chips, or some dried cranberries. DELICIOUS!!

I added the chocolate chips at the beep for the add-in cycle and wound up with chocolate bread (after reading the other reviews, I realize I should've frozen them first).  My son loves it, but my husband and I both think it is just "ok".  Sorry!

This was so good! I added 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder to make it extra rich and 1 teaspoon vanilla.

This didn't come out well for us- we seem to have lost the chocolate chips in the bread machine! We followed the right directions, but we ended up with some kind of bread that was missing the chips? I don't know what happened there.  The only good thing about it was that it came our nice and soft.

Excellent recipe!  I substituted vanilla for the cinnamon and used white chocolate chips.  I used the fruit/nut setting on my machine with light crust and it turned out great.  Thanks!

This bread was delicious, however, I think it does need to be a bit sweeter.  Next time I am adding a little more sugar and chocolate chips.  I saw where someone added cocoa..may do that as well.  Overall, this was excellent!

So I don't know what happened but the bread did not cook in the middle. Is there something wrong with my bread machine.  I just made a different loaf of bread earlier today and it came out perfect.  Any suggestions?  The part of the bread that was cooked was delicious.

So good and smelled WONDERFUL!! Followed others suggestions and froze the chocolate chips first. Otherwise followed directions as stated. So good right out of the bread machine but by the next day is was a little dry already so eat it right away...it's not hard!

I would make this again just for the heavenly smell of it when it bakes!  I froze my chocolate chips and added them by hand (after the mixing cycle of my bread machine, then put it right back into the bread machine).  what a special bread! I did it without cinnamon just to have the pure chocolate flavor, but I will try it with cinnamon next time.  I will be making this again and again.

This is a great recipe although I did a few things differently. I used the dough cycle on my bread machine and followed the ingredients list exactly, keeping the chocolate chips in the refrigerator to keep them cold and prevent melting. On the advice of other reviewers I did not put them in during the "add in" beeper. I let the dough finish the full dough cycle in the  machine, then took it out and divided into three loaves for my small loaf pans. I kneaded the cold chocolate chips into the three loaves (this was tricky as the chips did not want to "stick" in the dough evenly, but with some patience you can do it). I let the loaves rise for another 45 minutes or so, then baked at 350* in my oven for about 30  minutes. Wow!!! The chocolate chips were perfectly placed and the bread was delicious! I think it's best warm straight out of the oven. This was a big hit in my house and I will definitely be making it again! Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

I can't give this a 5 because I changed several things.  I omitted the cinnamon and added a little vanilla.  I froze the chips and added then at the "add nuts" signal and they did not melt very much.  I ended up having to add 3/8 cup more flour as after 5 minutes kneading it was way too liquidy!  Perhaps I mismeasured the liquids.  I reduced the chips to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 cup chopped macadamia nuts.  Good texture and flavor.

I really liked this.  Good warm with butter.  Next time I am adding more cinnamon and a little more chocolate chips.  I also used frozen chips, per the previous reviews.  Worked well.

The chocolate chips really do need to be frozen.  I also suggest that you add the chips at the last minute of the stir in stage.  In my bread maker the chips melted before it baked the first time I made this.  I then added the chips in right before it started the rise cycle and it worked great.

I think you need to freeze the chocolate chips before you add them in. That should prevent them from melting.
