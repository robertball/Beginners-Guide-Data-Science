Very easy to put together from start to finish. I will say I foobarb'ed with the Italian Sausage links, I used Hot Turkey Polish Sausage instead. Even though it worked out well. I'll have to try to use the italian sausage links the next time. Ours had a bit of a bite to it was, just a little acidic not much just a tad. However, my littliest one said she like "stagetti night" and was prouf of it ;-) Thank you LindaT.

I made this sauce last night for dinner and it was very well received. I must admit, I usually just use jarred spaghetti sauce but I decided to give this a try and I'm so glad I did, it was super flavorful and more importantly, so easy and quick to make. Thanks for sharing Linda!

I followed this recipe exact. I used half of the spaghetti sauce last night to make a Hamburger Helper-kind of skillet meal (I really just cooked elbow macaroni, drained it and folded it into the sauce and sprinkled more fresh parmesan cheese on top) and froze the other half. The boys liked the combination of meats in this one, the hot italian sausage gave the sauce just enough heat without going overboard.

Super yummy...I used a full pound of extra lean hot Italian chicken sausage out of the casing, cooked and crumbled, omitted the ground beef since I had none. Used four cans of crushed tomatoes with basil, added a diced red pepper and baby bella mushrooms which I cooked along with the onion and sausage. I added everything to the crockpot and it was a wonderful easy and very flavorful, chunky sauce. Served over whole wheat spaghetti and served with a salad. Family enjoyed, thanks!

Best recipe yet !!   - I make a big batch and freeze in smaller containers ( 71 servings at a time ! ).   My husband wants me to stick with this recipe from now on !    I agree - works great in Lasagna too !

Oh, my, yum!  This recipe definitely shows why slow food is better.  There is a richness and depth of flavor present that cannot be duplicated by a jar sauce.  Not a convenience food, but definitely worth repeating , I'm grateful Mama Palomba shared her recipe with the submitter, and I'm glad Linda shared with Allrecipes!

I was hoping to make a sauce from scratch that would stand out.  I thought this sauce ended up tasting like it came from a jar.  I didn't add sausage so maybe that's why.  I wouldn't make it again .

Very good did add 3 T of sun dried tomatoes and substitued red wine for water.  Used a 1 pnd  of ground beef instead of 2.  Added some red pepper flakes to spice it up. Nice thick sauce with great flavor.

Delicious! I halved the recipe and I used fresh herbs rather than dried. I used hot Italian sausage (never buy mild sausage) and the ground chuck. Very easy to make.

Delicious! I made a 1/2 batch to sample before I did a double batch for a family gathering. It passed with flying colors and I ate the 1/2 batch like soup while the double batch was cooking. It is THAT good! Who needs pasta with a sauce this good? ;) Love the combination of sausage and ground beef. For the sausage I used all mild in place of hot because here in Michigan people are heat wimps. Thanks for a keeper Linda!

The best spaghetti sauce recipe I have found. So odd that 3000 people have added it to Favorites, but only a very small number have reviewed. The only change is that I used one pound of hot sausage, because I didn't want to buy a pound of hot and a pound of mild and freeze what was left. This is a fantastic sauce, and I will make it again and again.

A perfect blend of flavors but more importantly, this sauce has a perfect consistency for using with short-cut pasta or in lasagne. It's so rich and thick, you can eat it with a fork or a piece of bread! The ratio of tomatoes to meat is right on. Thank you for the recipe.

This was absolutely delicious. I used organic Guin Muir puree and followed the instructions to a T. Not too spicy and the mixture of flavors from cooking each additional ingredient in the leftovers from the previous ingredient really added a ton of complexity to the dish. So meaty- almost a chili! Will be making again! Thanks, Linda!!

Although I have not yet made this, I DID eat it---several servings of it to be exact!  Baking Nana featured this at an AR Peeps Christmas get-together.  This is something that I WILL be making in the next couple of weeks for something quick to pull from my freezer when things get hectic!  I can honestly rate this a 5 Star!  Thank you so much, LindaT.

I love this recipe!  The first time I made it, I made it as written, but I cut it in half.  There was still MORE than enough (I was able to freeze 3 containers of it after dinner was done).  I was not a fan of the hot sausage in it, to me it gave it a burnt taste.  I made it again tonight, except I substituted ground turkey for the beef and used all mild sausage (my store didnt have any turkey sausage or I would have used that).  I also put the meat in the food processor so there werent any huge chunks in there.  After making a batch of stuffed shells for my daughter and I, I still had enough to fill 4 dishes to freeze.  This sauce is better than anything I have ever bought in the store, and costs way less in the end.  And it is versatile, which makes it even better!

We just got back from Italy and I had a craving for the Spaghetti Bolognese we had there.  This recipe is a keeper!  Very easy to make and so scrumptious!  It has the rich flavor that I loved in Italy.  Everyone is the family loved it!  Will definitely be making it again.  

Only change I made was instead of using 2 different sausages (hot and mild) , I just used Italian sausage to keep it easier as I didn't want to buy 2 different flavors and only use half of each.

A very rich and delicious sauce.  I would consider draining the ground beef and sausage drippings, however, if you are concerned or sensitive to an abundant amount of fat in your diet.

Absolutely loved this hearty and delicious meat sauce. I used fresh herbs instead of dried, tripling the amount called for. I will definitely be making this one again.

Thick and meaty, very flexible recipe and great to freeze for last minute needs.  What's not to like.  I have made this with the puree, without it and using stewed tomato's, beef, chicken, turkey always good and always easy to put together. Thank you for sharing this.

Delicious! I scaled this down to 8 servings and used all fresh herbs (3x the dried amount). We had this over spaghetti tonight, and will have the remaining sauce later in the week, maybe over polenta. Thanks for the recipe Linda!
