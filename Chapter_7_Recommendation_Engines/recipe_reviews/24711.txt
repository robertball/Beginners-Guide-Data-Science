I thought this was OK, maybe a little dry. My 10 yr old loves it though. No one knew about the tofu either. I used extra firm tofu and pressed it dry, then mashed it up with the cheese. I then added in garlic, oregano, basil. I shredded the carrots and zucchini and boiled them for a couple of minutes before adding in. I didn't use the whole box of shells, but it gave me a full 9x13 pan worth. I topped it with a roasted garlic and onion jarred pasta sauce, for the flavor.

Excellent. I did without the ricotta & instead used 14oz. of firm tofu. As well, I substituted the cheese with mozzarella soy cheese. Came out fabulously. Even the "dairy people" didn't notice anything weird. Loved by all.

I didn't have ricotta, so I left it out, and the recipe was still wonderful. Very easy to make, tastes great, and extremely nutitious. A real winner that I'll make again and again....

These stuffed shells were great.  I used fat free ricotta cheese and substituted the zucchini for broccoli and spinach.  Then, I put the carrots and broccoli in a food processor and chopped the spinach before cooking them. My boyfriend and I both agreed that the spinach was a great addition to the recipe.

I found this recipe in my vegetarian cookbook and loved it!  Simple, easy & delicioius.  I modified it by using mostly Veggie Shredds instead of real cheese & used fat-free ricotta. I also used Five Brothers Fresh Tomato & Basil sauce instead of making the sauce with the recipe because we like lots of sauce (and it was faster!).

The filling is excellent, mild, perfectly textured and tasty. Be careful when adding or substituting vegetables that you drain everything very well. I recommend blending the tofu, ricotta and egg until smooth before stirring in the carrot mixture and cheeses. I used 2 jars of spinach spaghetti sauce and pepperoni crumbles and tons more cheese.   Makes more than 4 servings though - maybe 6.

This turned out pretty good. I used fresh spinach and carrots for the veggies. I also replaced the onion with some chopped garlic. Next time I will use  less garlic and more veggies. Also, I really like my shells stuffed full. This recipe was a little short. My 2 year old loved it. It was reasonably easy to make. Play with the seasonings and veggies to give the recipe more taste.

i was feeling lazy so i used prego garlic lovers sauce, AND my boyfriend is super picky about what veggies he likes so i used carrots and broccoli instead of the zucchini.  it came out great.  he's one of those "ew tofu" people and he wouldn't have even know it was tofu if i hadn't told him.  we both loved it and will totally make it again.  this time i'll make the broccoli a little finer, but other than that i wouldn't change a thing.

I really enjoyed this dinner.  My husband and I each ate 5 shells each and were full, and that was only half a serving.  I doubled the veggies, and I used jarred sauce instead of making my own to save time.

Honestly, very bland. Needs more spices and I think this would be good. The texture of the tofu if you blend it really good fits right in and you'll never know its there. The tofu really needs a lot of seasoning though so don't be scared of the spices & herbs.

Made this into manicotti, because shells aren't sold out here. Left out the zucchini because I didn't have any as well as the egg because I don't eat them. Mixed in with my tofu/ricotta/mozzarella mixture some pepper, Italian seasoning, minced garlic, the shredded carrot and diced onion. After stuffing the manicotti, I used jarred sauce for convenience and then sprinkled some shredded mozzarella on top.

Wow -- this blew me away. The flavor was even better than traditional cheese-stuffed shells, but no one would ever guess that there's tofu (or shredded veggies) in these! I used zucchini squash, summer squash and carrot for the veggies, doubled the filling, and doctored up prepared spaghetti sauce. My son, who avoids anything with vegetables or texture, ate this up. Thanks for a phenomenal vegetarian main dish!

I loved the fact that the tofu blends in so well with the cheese. The final product was rich but not heavy, which was a very nice change from traditional stuffed shells.  I'm a lazy cook, so I used a store bought-spaghetti sauce instead of making my own and it worked just fine!

In addition, the next time I make it I will skip the carrots and saute rather than boil the vegetables. The carrot did not work for me at all; I'd rather go more traditional and use spinach instead. I don't like to boil broccoli because I think that enhances its natural bitterness and nobody in my house likes that smell!

My family really enjoyed it, and it made so much I gave some to a single co-worker; she loved it!

Thanks for a tasty way to incorporate tofu into my meal repertoire!

made this last night, and it was delicious!  i will definitely make it again.  i did use a store bought sauce (like a lot of other folks), but i used the zucchini and carrots and it was great. (i also used soft tofu, which wasn't specified in the recipe, but seemed like the right choice for this meal.)

This was very good.  I adjusted a little to use up what I had on hand and was happy with the results.  I used my own pasta sauce and also substituted cottage cheese for ricotta cheese.

My daughter made this last night for her boyfriend and let us have a taste.  We were very impressed and are looking forward to her making them for the rest of the family.  (She too used store bought sauce, but added some onion, garlic, green pepper and tomato to give it a more homemade taste.)

WOW!  I made this last night and my husband went on and on about how good it was and went back for seconds.  This all from a man who swore he hates tofu and would never like it no matter what I did!  I admit not telling him about the tofu until the end of the meal :)

This can be a bit long to make but taste great.  Less calories then using only cheese and you are still getting a lots of calcium if you use the high in calcium tofu.  The kids couldn't tell that it was not all cheese stuffing!

Maybe I'm just slow, but the prep time took me longer than 10 minutes, lol. I followed the directions exactly and it tasted great. You really can't taste the tofu either. Next time I plan on making twice the tomato sauce. My husband thought the sauce ratio was good, but my daughter and I like our pastas really saucy. I might add some olives next time, too.

I used a 12 oz package of pasta shells and just shredded one whole zucchini and carrot. when it came time to stuff the shells, that seemed too labor intensive for me, so I just layered the bottom of the pan with the shells and then scooped the filling over them, mixing somewhat.

Really good. A little bland.  The changes I made are: added Italian seasoning and used Alfredo sauce.  My husband is a meat eater and I am not, and we both loved it.  This is a keeper.

This is by far my favorite tofu recipe. I've made it for tons of people who aren't vegetarian and who don't even like tofu and everyone always likes it. I substitute a 10 oz package of frozen (thawed) spinach for the carrot and the zucchini (but you could really just add it in additionally) and I use a jar of spaghetti sauce instead of making my own. This also freezes fantastically. If you're planning to freeze it, you don't have to saute the onion first.

These were delicious and like most everyone else has said you would never know there is tofu in them.  But they took me closer to an hour of prep than the 10 mins it says and that was using jarred sauce.  I also sauteed the veggies rather than cooking them in water and added a little garlic and basil to the tofu/cheese mixture.  I would definitely make them again though.

This was a very easy recipe to make. I even added mushrooms because I had them in my frig. My daughter refuses to eat carrots but she asked for more. My husband won't even look at tofu and he ate 6 shells. I will definitely keep this recipe and make it again,and again, and again!!

This is a great meatless meal. I didn't shred my carrots or zucchini i chopped them finely and sauteed them in some canola oil instead of adding the water. I did squeeze my tofu to get some of the excess liquid out. I didn't make the sauce ( busy weeknight) so this review is just for the filling. Great I would make these again!!!

It was okay.  We didn't like the crunchiness of the carrots in it. Maybe I didn't cook them long enough before I added them.

Very yummy and fresh tasting! I really liked the addition of the chunky tomato stuff on top--might could use a TINY bit more of that. Still super good!

I increased this recipe to feed 6-7 people. It was delicious, but there wasn't enough stuffing to fill all the shells! It could have been my own error, but it wouldn't hurt to make a little extra stuffing so that your shells are nice and packed. Also, if you layer the shells, make sure you put your sauce and cheese in between layers. Scrumptious!

5 stars from whole family!  Doubled the veggies, shredded fine, added spinach and threw in some extra cheese.  Used a jar sauce and added the spices to that.  Used manicotti shells because didn't have jumbo shells, were a pain to stuff but tasted great!

The tofu blends in so easily. I did not make the sauce myself-- just poured some Newman's over it-- and it was still delish!

I thought this was a great recipie! I made it for my (meat eating) family and they didn't even know they had tofu in them. I used 1/2 cottage cheese and 1/2 ricotta instead of all ricotta though.

I really liked the idea of this recipe, but as someone who likes tofu on its own, I didn't see the need for it in the shells.  I found the stuffing mix too dry with the tofu.  Flavors were good however, so I might recommend this for someone trying to "sneak" tofu in a meal for some protein.

I thought this was a pretty bland finale after all that work.  I didn't take any 'short cuts', and there wasn't as much flavor as I was hoping.  Also, I would double the filling -- unless you use a teeny bit you'll never fill all the shells.  My 'warm through' took 40 minutes, and by then I was tired of waiting, but it still wasn't satisfyingly hot...overall, kind of a bummer.  The three stars are three hopeful stars that I can zest it up a little next time.

Loved this one! Absolute fav.. Delicious!  I skipped the carrots and added mushrooms instead.  Sauted the veggies in olive oil and a bit of butter.  Used additional mozzerella instead of monterey cheese.  Followed the advice of others and added oregno, basil, garlic powder to the tofu mixture.  Used prepared Whole Foods pasta sauce. Have served this to many people...vegetarians and meat eaters and all have enjoyed!

My newly vegetarian husband absolutely loved these stuffed shells! The sauce is a bit lacking, but I just threw in a few ingredients that normally go into my marinara sauce- a splash of red wine, crushed red pepper flakes and a touch of honey- to add more flavor. I also did all the veggies in the food processor, then added the rest of the ingredients and blended the filling until smooth. Since the veggies were ground, there was no need to cook them first, which saved time. I will definitely be making this often!

A great vegetarian recipe. I added a bit of cinnamon to the red sauce to make the dish a bit more fragrant as well as sweet (it can be heavy on the stomach!), and it turned out perfect with the addition.

It was ok, and nutritious. I nevertheless think it was pretty bland, that's why I only gave 3 stars.

This was the best Italian dinner I have had in a while!  I took the advise of the other reviews.  I used low fat ricotta and low fat cheese and the taste was still great.  I also use a jar of sause instead of making my own.  The only thing I changed was I added more carrots, more zucchini and omitted the onions.  My husband is one of the pickiest eaters and I've made it twice in two weeks!  Thank you for the great recipe!!

These turned out fantastic.  I used fat-free ricotta cheese and it tasted great.  One tip...I would definitely drain the tofu really well before using it...I usually freeze it first and then thaw it and press it.  I didn't drain it the first time and a lot of water came out....Delicious though!!

I'd accidentally purchased a 16 oz container of tofu so I simply doubled the stuffing ingredients!  Turned out to be the perfect amount for all the shells.  I'm lazy so I used a 25.5 oz jar of organic spaghetti which I doctored with sauteed fresh tomatoes, onions and garlic and the same spices offered in the recipe. t was super delicious.  Will now put this in my rotation. Tasty and feeds a crowd without a big dent in the budget!   Thank you very much, CookingForDummies, for sharing this recipe!

I LOVED this! Super creamy and tasty! Added 1 clove minced garlic to the veggie steam saute for the filling, and some fresh chopped basil. Used cottage cheese instead of ricotta, and a medium firm tofu so that it mashed well.  Used a canned tomato sauce, but warmed it with 1 clove minced garlic, some extra oregano and thyme. In the last few minutes added 1 1/2 cups of large chopped rounds of grape tomato and 2 tbsp. fresh basil, to create a fresh and chunky texture to the sauce.

I made it with alfredo sauce instead of using tomatoes. It was delicious. I cooked some in an airfryer and the rest inthe oven. I forgot to add garlic and that would have made it better!

Excellent recipe. Doubled the spices and added a teaspoon of cumin and cayenne powder as that is more to our taste. Also used low fat/fat free mozzarella and ricotta and I don't think it made any difference. Cannot tell there is tofu in there at all (used silken and mixed in the blender for extra smoothness). Only thing is that the servings are off, one box of shells is wayyy more than 8 servings. We were eating it for days (there are two of us).

The tofu really lightens this dish compared to recipes which use cheese only. Mine turned out a little bland but a little salt or parmesan will bring out the flavor.

Twas a little bland AND WAY too little filling.IF I make it again, the cheese mixture will get some extra herbs/spices added to it.  I added 8 2" cremini mushrooms that I shredded along with the 2 carrots and whole zucchini, extra mozzarella cheese and extra monterey jack. Used the called for amount of ricotta and tofu.  Instead of water, cooked the veggies in 1 tablespoon butter.  Since I didn't want to "waste" the vegetable juices, I squeezed the veggies, draining into a container and used it in the sauce.  Good thing I added that amount of liquid, about 1/2 cup, because the sauce didn't really pour.  Should have added some water or maybe wine to it.

This recipe was pretty good; I doubled the ingredients to make two meals, so now I have another dinner all set to go in the freezer, so that's convenient.  I put extra tofu in, so I wasn't fooling anyone as far as taste goes, but we all enjoy tofu so it wasn't an issue.  The one thing I would modify is to add more seasonings to the filling.  We found it kind of bland.  I would try it again.  Thanks.

This was great! I didn't have ricotta so doubled the tofu.  I put fresh mushrooms and spinach in the food processor and used more zucchini, onion and carrots than called for.  I also added garlic.  We couldn't get enough!  Healthy comfort food. I will make it definitely again!

I changed this significantly. Had hoped I didn't have to rate it. Thank you for the base recipe. I used soft tofu, sub'd Xantham Gum for the egg (child allergic to egg whites), added only 1/2 cup of pre-shredded italian cheeses, no ricotta, made some homemade marinara and added part of the sauteed onion, green pepper, mushroom & garlic mixture to the tofu after mashing it instead of the carrot/zucchini/onion mixture recommeded. I will add an extra tsp or 2 of salt to the tofu mix next time to make up for the lack of salty cheese I omitted. The two 5 year olds and two 2 year olds as well as all the parents ate on this single recipe. It was plenty although we had leftover shells w/ not enough tofu mix to put in them so the kids got some pasta w/ sauce as well.

I made this last night and my family loved it. I made the stuffing just like the recipe, I used a jar of sauce to save time, and I sprinkled a Panko bread crumb mixture on top with cheese. It was delicious!

This was really good, but I found I had to make way more sauce and filling. For the sauce I used a whole large can of Tomato paste and about 4 fresh diced tomatoes. I also added more spices to taste.

For the filling I added 2 garlic cloves minced, and  also added about 1 C chopped mushroom. I found that I had to add extra carrots and zucchini as well. An entire box of cooked shells would not fit in the 9x13 pan, but I did use all the filling to fill what I could fit in there.

This was a hit last night with the whole family.  I used our favorite spaghetti sauce instead of making it as directed.  I forgot to cook the shredded carrots and zuc so they went in raw.  I shredded them on the fine setting so it didn't seem to be a big deal.  I will definitely make this one again!

Good, not the best I've ever had. The cheese mixture filled 28 shells. I would make sure to really finely chop/grate the veggies next time: I used some pre-grated carrot that threw off the texture. I also used store-bought sauce in response to previous complaints. I added some chopped fresh parsley to the cheese mixture.

Great Recipe and easy to make.  I've made it three times and one time I didn't have much time so I left out the vegetables and it was still great and very fast.

This recipe was VERY good. I loved it, probably more than cheese stuffed shells because it was creamier. Yum. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made this for my family and didn't tell them it was tofu! Everyone agreed it was pretty good. I think you could also use less tofu and more cheese to make it even more tasty ;)

I'm giving this 3 stars becasue it was just ok.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was just missing something.  I wasn't too fond of the sauce, I'm sure that it would be much better with a different sauce.  Seems like most who gave this 5 stars used their own sauce or a store bought sauce.

Very tasty, even my 15-months old son asked for a second plate! Just be ready to spend more time in your kitchen than what it is said, 55 minutes total time is unrealistic.

very good! My husband was quite surprised to learn that tofu was in this recipe! (He is not a vegetarian and had a bad idea of how tofu must taste!) I used fresh spinach and carrots that I sauteed in water! Thank ya.

These shells were very good.  My only complaint was that they seemed just a bit dry, but that is probably because I made them a day ahead and so they sat in the fridge for 24 hrs.  Also, like many here, I used a canned sauce.
