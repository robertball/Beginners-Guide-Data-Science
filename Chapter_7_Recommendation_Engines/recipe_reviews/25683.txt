needs potatoes for sure, definatly needed to be scaled back. But the idea of thickening with a roux was such a brilliant idea. I use a roux to think all my gravys but never thought to use it in my chowder.

the taste of the chowder is good but I had to do a lot of guesing as how to make it.  there are steps left out as how to put every thing together. The portions of the ingredients is not correct eighter, the amt. of butter with flour is not right because 1 1/2T flour to 23/4 butter is not enough to make a rue for thicking purpose, is still far to wartery I even addes extra and it still didn't work, at the end had to thinken soup with some cornstartch and water. All in all  will not use this one again

This recipe seems fine except for the fact that the chicken broth mentioned in the ingredients does not seem to be required in the cooking instructions. is a little mystery.

Scaled recipe down because 80 servings would've been way too many left overs.  Butter/flour amounts are off, directions don't include the chicken broth, there was too much celery compared to the onion.  Along with red potato, I also added some shredded carrot because I had half of a large carrot to use up.  I found the chowder to be a bit thin and we were not impressed with this recipe, though because of my additions it was nice and chunky.  Not bad, but not for us.  Thanks for the try.
