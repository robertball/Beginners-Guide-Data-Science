I'm giving this 4 stars after having made a few alterations. First, I left out the tomatoes, cilantro, and red wine vinegar simply because I didn't have any on hand. I then used both green and red bell peppers (good for the flavor and the color), some chili powder (to taste), and added some frozen corn that I had left over. Having cooked these ingredients on the stove top, as well as the garlic, black beans, and olive oil from the recipe, I mixed it all together with the squash.  To finish, I topped it off with my favorite salsa (Southwest Salsa from Safeway).

In the end, it was pretty dang good. Definitely not bland, as it has been called in other reviews, but I think this was largely due to my alterations - the salsa is what really helped I think. My wife also added sour cream, which she claims was another great addition (I'm not a fan of sour cream, so no comment from me). Really, the only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 in the end is that the texture was a bit "mushy" which detracted slightly from the overall experience.

We ate it as a meal in and of itself, but it would go along great as a side to many Southwestern/Mexican/Spanish inspired dishes. I think I might try the leftovers in a tortilla with some cheese tomorrow.

Interesting. I substituted kidney beans for black beans, mushrooms for green pepper and didn't have enough tomatoes, but I still feel this could have used something else. It was very tasty with lime juice added after serving though.

I actually used this as a guidline and changed it to fit what I had in the house. I used celery, tomatoes,a yellow pepper, a garlic & black pepper spice I had, parsely for color and then I used a "Rasberry Bliss", spray, salad dressing.I also added pecans! This was really good, I actually enjoyed eating spaghetti squash!

I used mexican stewed tomatoes and roasted some anahiem chiles instead of green bell pepper and used 10 oz of montery jack cheese half on top and half mixed in and minus the red wine vinager, and it was excellent.  trust me.

Good recipe.  My 4 year old loved it (but then she loves most veggies including brussel sprouts). I didn't quite follow the baking instructions on this recipe, instead baked it at 350 F for 40 minutes on an uncovered, greased baking tray. I didn't have black beans, so substituted with dark kidney beans. Also,I used roasted red pepper , and balsamic vinegar instead of red wine. My family and I loved the dish. This is a great base recipe and forgives omissions and substitutions - perfect for the everyday home cook

Delicious flavor and texture combination.  I also added 1 roasted poblano and used 1 can of Rotel instead of fresh tomatoes.  YUM!  I ate all the leftovers myself, before anyone else could get to them!

When I finished making the recipe I had some doubts about my children (ages 4-12) liking it. I added a little cheese and popped it in the oven for ten min. or so to melt the cheese. They all loved it! :)

This was good on it's own, but even better when served with grilled andouille sausage.  I cheated and cooked the squash in the microwave: pierce a few times with a sharp knife, cook on high heat in microwave on a plate for 7 minutes, turn over, cook for 7 more minutes, let rest for 10 minutes, halve squash lengthwise, remove seeds, pull squash out with a fork.

This was pretty good.  Something different if your bored of traditional squash recipes.  I added chicken to make it a complete meal.  I think it would have been good with a couple of hot peppers added as well.

I like all of the ingredients in this recipe and gave it a try.  It was a little bland. I also garnished it with sour cream.   Next time I will add more Mexican seasoning and I'm sure it will be great. It is a very attractive dish.

I thought this dish was pretty good. We added a small can of chopped and peeled green chiles, chili powder, and substituted diced yellow pepper for the green pepper. My only disappointment with this dish was the texture being all the same . I think next time I'll add some red onion at the end to add some crunch. I wish the spaghetti squash had ended up less mushy - maybe I cooked it too long? This is a tasty dish, and I bet it would be great as a filling for veggie enchiladas.

This was good.  It didn't get rave reviews from the family, but they don't care for spaghetti squash.  I thought it was really good....I used pico de gallo salsa instead of tomatoes.

I added sausage to this, and without the sausage it would have been pretty lame. I used both red and green peppers, and with the added sausage and added cheese my family had this for a meal with biscuits on the side. Pretty good, but not great.

I thought this was a bit bland. I even added jalapenos and made it extra spicy. It was good, don't get me wrong, just didn't have as much flavor as I was expecting.

This was very good.  I followed other recommendations and added Chile Powder and some corn.  I served them on top of baked corn tortillas.  Very yummy!

I really enjoyed this.  It was my first experience with Spaghetti Squash and I was very pleased.  The only problem was I ended up having to throw some of it away because it made a ton and my DH (who doesn't like black beans) wouldn't eat it and I couldn't finish it all.

This was wonderful.  The flavors were subtle with just a hint of sweetness from the vinegar. My husband added cheese, but I tried it and it over powered the fresh taste.  Lime might be nice instead of the vinegar.  I should add that we really have cut down on our salt use and now realize how salt can interfere with the good flavors. Thanks!

Read the reviews, adopted some of the suggestions, and it turned out terrific!  I made the following changes:  I cooked the squash in the microwave. (Saved a lot of time).  Pierce several times and cook on high for 7 minutes on each side, turning once.  Let sit for 10 minutes.  Cut lengthwise and remove squash.  I used 1/2 red pepper instead of green pepper, added a 4 oz can of green chiles, used one 14.5 oz can of stewed tomatoes instead of fresh tomatoes, added cooked chicken meat to make it a whole meal.  My husband and I loved it!

This was okay, but maybe I overcooked the squash or used too much water in the pan?  It came out kinda mushy...more so than I thought it should have.  It was my first go at spaghetti squash though...

I didn't have tomatoes, but I did put in a can of organic diced tomatoes.  I also added some chopped spinach just for a little added color.  Our family has to watch our sodium intake, so I  used Mrs. Dash for seasoning.  I didn't precook the bans...I mixed everything together, put it in a casserole dish (sprayed with  olive oil), and baked it at 350 degrees for 35 minutes...easy peasy...oh yes, and tasty!

Well, I didn't have red wine vinegar, so I used balsamic instead. Then I sauteed some chicken and added that to the mix as well. It turned out not the prettiest meal with it's color darkened by the black beans, but, oh MAN was it delicious!! Since it has sort of a Mexican taste to it, I had sour cream on hand for individual tastes. Turned out nothing like the picture, but awesome just the same!

Added some seared flank steak. Tasted great. i think next time I might add some jalapeno or green onion to give it a little kick.
