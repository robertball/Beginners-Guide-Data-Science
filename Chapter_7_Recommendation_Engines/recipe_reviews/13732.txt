I have a diffrent recipie for these that uses 2 cups of grated cheese instead of canned cheese soup and I like mine better.  I had to try it though and they were not really bad just messy.

I first tasted these when a friend of mine made them.  I thought they were wonderful.  I failed to get the recipe so I came home and did a search and found them on this site (joined up too).  Only thing I did different was I used a mini muffin tin and they baked up wonderfully.  This recipe actually made over 48 mini muffins.

Very easy to make and very delicious. But I found the dough to be somewhat messy and sticky. Perhaps chilling the dough thoroughly might help but this is a definite repeat recipe at my house.

I'm not too big on sausage myself, but I thought that this would be a great appetizer for Turkey Day so I gave it a try anyways. IT WAS A HIT!! Going by other users' suggestions I did alter the recipe a bit.. I used 1 cup of shredded cheese and 1 cup of the Cheddar Cheese Soup, also I sprinkled the top of the sausage balls with garlic powder and chili powder before sticking them in the oven.

These are great for breakfast. I use 3 cups of biscuit mix instead and I scoop them onto the baking sheet with two spoons instead of using my hands. This is the only thing my husband requested for Christmas morning breakfast!

I made these sausage balls with a savory sage sausage and they were eagerly eaten up by my extended family. My husband suggested they would taste great dipped in a warm mustard sauce which I'll definately try next time. I made these sausage balls two days in advance and then froze them. I baked them for an extra five minutes and they turned out fine. This helped shift prep time to far before my guests arrived.

I used the mini muffin also. I used hot sausage meat maybe a little bit too hot.  Next time I'll mix 1/2 and 1/2 But I don't know what is buttermilk mix.

I first tried these at a party and they were more moist than my old favorite recipe....so I had to try making them myself! They are sticky when you mix them and hard to form into a ball shape because they cling to your hands, so another reviewer's suggestion of using a miniature muffin tin would be a great fix for that problem...or next time I might try refrigerating the dough for 30 minutes before to see if that firms it up any.  The taste is great, but some extra shredded cheese might make it even better!

I made these on Thanksgiving and they were a hit.  Everyone loved them.  I did use a mini muffin pan and spoons to fill it.  It is very sticky.  I will definately make these again.  Thanks for the recipe.

I'm simply amazed at the high rating this recipe received.  It was the only "bomb" at my Thanksgiving meal.  I made it for an appetizer.  Out of 16 guests, only 1 liked it.  While the recipe is very easy to make, it has a very bland taste.  Nobody had any idea what they were eating--one person guessed he was eating a crab cake!  Don't waste your time on this one...

Yummy!  Did not last long both times I have fixed them.  First time I followed the recipe exactly, the second time I did not have the right soup, so used cream of mushroom instead.  My 6 year old son who hates mushrooms could not get enough of these!  Thanks for a great recipe!

My family loved this recipe.  I made these sausage balls as pre-thanksgiving appetizers. The family loved them.  My wife had to stop herself from filling up on them.  The re-heat very well.  I served them for breakfast the day after to rave reviews.  Thanks for the recipe!

TERRIFIC! I changed per other suggestions  by using 2-1/2 C. buttermilk baking mix (I sifted my mix into the sausage and Cream of Mushroom soup. Also I sprayed w/ PAM the mini muffin tins and they came out easier than the ones I baked on a cookie sheet with no spray. I mixed the mixture the day before & used 2 spoons to form balls which was very easy and no stickyness like other readers said.

I loved it - I used spicy italian sausage mixed with mild and they were great!  Had a bite to them.  And using soup instead of shredded cheese made the 'dough' a lot easier to work with.

This recipe tastes so much better using xtra sharp vermont white cheddar as opposed to the cheddar soup.  Also, sage sausage adds a very nice flavor  I have found that I always shorten the cooking time by 2-3 minutes as they harden up after taking them out.  Soooo good!!!

I've tried several different receipes for Sausage Balls.  This is by far the best.  I make them for all holidays.  They are a little messy to make, but in the end its worth it.

I'm giving this 3 stars because my son generally liked it and because I did make some modifications. Personally, I thought it was entirely to "biscuity." I used twice the amount of pork and didn't increase the amount of baking mix, yet I felt it tasted more like a sausage flavored biscuit than a more meatball flavor that I was expecting. Probably won't make again. At least not with the baking mix.

I made these for an appetizer for Christmas for our family gathering and they were a hit. I used half of the cheese soup and 1/2 cup of shredded colby jack cheese mix. I served these with a spicy mustard sauce by Chief John from Allrecipes.com. This is a sticky dough so be prepared to deal with the mess on your hands if you try to roll the sausage  mixtute into balls. I used a cookie scoop to try and eliminate some of the mess. They still well worth the effort.  I'll be making these ssusage balls for our family on New Years for breakfast brunch.

I made these and they were great!! They are messy a little but not dry at all. Instead of rolling them in a ball, I just dropped them like cookies. Only 3 left, and we ate them the next morning-don't need to heat them up. Still good!!

I used Bisquick and hot sausage for a spicy taste and added about a cup of shredded cheese to reduce the "stickiness" somewhat and add a little more cheesy flavor.  They were easy to "drop" using an ice cream scoop and a spoon (actually easier than forming balls with other recipes).  I have always loved sausage balls but other recipes using just shredded cheese (or adding butter of milk) always seemed a little dry and/or greasy.  This recipe is moist inside and crunchy outside without any greasiness.

Fantastic. I used smoked Gouda instead - because Gouda is gooda, and Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free Biscuit Mix because I have Celiac disease. These came out amazing. I almost ate the entire pan of them while they were still 350F.

I didn't have condensed cream of cheddar soup.  I used cream of mushroom and I used deer sausage. It was really good.  Simple and delicious.  Can't wait to try it with cream of cheddar

Quick, easy, delicious! Yes, the mix is sticky but I spooned it into greased mini muffin tins. No need to roll into balls, it settles nicely into the tin. When done merely turn out onto a plate. Perfectly done meatballs!

I used fresh grated cheddar cheese & these were the best sausage balls I've ever had! Usually they're very dry but these proportions made for the perfect consistency.

This recipe was easy, but I found the mixture to be very dry.  I ended up adding about a 1/4 cup of water to get it all mixed in.  I also used 2 cups of shredded cheddar as opposed to the canned soup.  Once the mixture was combined well I did use mini muffin cups to bake them in and they turned out awesome!  I will make these again.

I've made these for years. I always add about 1/2 cup of milk so they bind together. After I scoop out the balls, I wet my hands and roll them into more-perfectly round balls. Works great! Tastes fantastic.

I made these into balls,(yes they were very sticky), and very lightly put them in muffin tins and served them with toothpicks and a honey mustard dressing. 2 out of seven people at my house did not enjoy these on Thanksgiving.
