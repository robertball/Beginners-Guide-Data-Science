There is far too much lemon juice called for in the dressing--and unfortunately that really overpowered all the other flavors. I think it would be better without the lemon juice at all especially since the Dijon mustard adds enough tang to the dressing already. At the very least reduce it drastically. It's a shame that my heirlooms were overwhelmed by the lemon juice because they should really not have their flavor hidden but rather complimented. I would maybe make something similar in the future but with a very different dressing.
