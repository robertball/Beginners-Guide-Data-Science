Note: most recipes for the instant pot appear to be made for the 6 quart, so do not be surprised when you get a burn notice...it makes sense, especially because the 8 quart is bigger in volume, thus more room for liquid to spread out and become thinner creating the chance of evaporation.

Onto the review- I made changes and because I made changes I refuse to lower the rating, even though the changes didnâ€™t work so well. 
I reduced  the sour cream to 12 ounces, and used 12 ounces plain greek yogurt. I did this to lower the overall fat/calories. It worked beautifully until I added in the plain Greek yogurt. Although I was careful, the sauce did curdle. 
I found this remarkably similar to a stroganoff and it was delicious!
