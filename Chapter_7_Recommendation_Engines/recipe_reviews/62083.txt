The 2 star rating may be generous.  The onion soup mix makes the dressing WAAAAAY too salty. I can't believe it's only 327 grams of sodium.  Also turns out very thick and tan in color, more like a chip dip than a salad dressing.  I added about 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 teaspoon of sugar to try and save it.  I was the only one didn't like it at all.  It's going in the reject pile.

I used much less of the dried seasoning and it was still way too much.  I liked the avocado, but it really got drowned out by even the reduced seasonings.

I made this with fat free yogurt because I didn't have any sour cream. After tasting it, I remixed it using an additional avocado. A previous reviewer was right when stating this was more like a dip than a dressing, so that's how we're eating it. I'll try making it again using sour cream to see if improves the flavor.
