I adapted the original recipe. I exchanged the water for  soymilk, adding 1 Tbsp vinegar to the soymilk. I also added 1 Tbsp sugar, the grated rind of a lemon, and 1/2 tsp vanilla. My batter was a little runny, so I sprinkled in about a Tbsp or so more of cornmeal. I'll be making these again.

This pancake was easy to make, but it was the worst tasting pancake I ever ate. I threw the remaining batter away.

These were very flat, tasteless pancakes.  I subbed ordinary dairy milk for the soy milk and ended up adding 1/3 cup of sugar once I tasted the first one and that helped, but I won't be making these again  . these just caught my attention as I thought they would be a little like a pancake version of Nigella's blueberry cornmeal muffins - they absolutely were not.

I loved them.  I cook for a few vegans and they loved the pancakes.  So easy to make.  The pancakes  tasted just like buckwheat. Wonderful! Thanks!

Very good basic recipe!  I add a little touch of honey and use vanilla soy milk.  I have also added a little bit of orange extract to them which makes them out of this world.  My kids love them!  I use frozen blueberries and chop them up a little so they aren't lumpy.  I've made these dozens of times, and they are a keeper!

If you like buckwheat pancakes, you will enjoy the firm and excellent taste of these pancakes.  Very, very good.

Used almond milk instead of soy milk and cream of wheat instead of the cornmeal.  I like that the cream of wheat gave it some texture.  I was the only one who ate these.  It made enough for me to freeze some for later.  I also used frozen blueberrie, and they worked just fine.

Very filling breakfast.  I made a few changes.  Scaled the recipe for 3 servings, didn't use any oil, used light vanilla soy milk, added a mashed very ripe banana, 1 cup blueberries, added vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and a little splenda for baking, and served with syrup warmed with cinnamon & nutmeg. YUM!  Thanks for a great starter recipe.

Could be my mistake, but I can't imagine them turning out much better.  My suggestion would be to beat them with a blender before letting it sit to get some air trapped in the batter. Maybe use some kind of egg replacer

I skip the blueberries and use these as a base for a more savoury breakfast. They are quite good. You can sub part of the ww flour for white and get a poofier pancake. My preschooler loves them too (maple syrup and fruit on his portion, mushrooms and onions on ours)

Tried them as written first but too runny and lacking flavor. Also stick to all my skippers, even the nonstick one. Added more flour, some sugar and almond extract. They were much better then. It's a good base recipe for eggless pancakes but needs to be played with.

I loved them.  Of course they're not your fluffy pancake, but I loved the texture and flavor.  I don't think I changed anything--made them thinner if need be, but that's just a by sight thing.

Good! A nice hearty flavor. The only changes I made were I used vanilla almond milk because we don't buy soy and I added a little raw honey, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Will def. make again!

Not too bad. I just developed a severe lactose intolerance, so I decided to give these pancakes a try. They tasted very grainy because of the cornmeal, and I thought they were much better without maple syrup poured on top....I preferred them plain.

These were good pancakes. A little harder that normal because of the cornmeal, but they were still good and filling. To make the pancakes really healthy, I added some wheat germ and flaxseed to them. It did not ruin or alter the taste of them, they still tasted delicious.

I really like these! VERY tasty, and I like the texture as well. We always have fresh or frozen raspberries on hand, because we grow our own, and I have often substituted these for blueberries. VERY good. I make these often.

Fantastic recipe!  My husband and I discovered blueberry cornmeal pancakes on a trip to Santa Fe.  Everytime we make these, it takes us back to that special weekend.

Only changes I made was add whole milk and add a tsp. of vanilla, for flavor. I don't use soy milk in this house. The batter was on the thin side but puffed up once they started cooking. These cooked up differently than other blueberry pancakes I've made. I don't know if I'll make it again, I would like to see if it might just have been an error on my part.

We love whole wheat pancakes, but we did not care for these. Perhaps if you are vegan these are what you are used to, but they were not our cup of tea at all. Dense, chewy, and not a good flavor.

I made these for myself and really liked them, they do have a heavier buckwheat taste which I like but I might not serve them to other people who are more into all american pancakes.  I made these healthier by using fax seed in the recipe and instead of using syrup I sauteed strawberries with vanilla soymilk mixed with a big of cornstarch and spenda in a pan which made a creamy sauce to pour over.

I substituted half and half for the soy milk, used unbleached all purpose flour and added 2 tablespoons of sugar to make up for the lack of sweetness from the soy milk.  It was a great success.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.

I loved these pancakes. I especially liked that it didn't require eggs. Great for those times one realizes that there are none in the refrigerator and I have an allergy to egg yolks. I added banana & pecans. TASTY! Definitely will make again.

Very very good. I used skim instead of soy milk, halved the recipe, and used white four instead of wheat. I definitely want to try it with the wheat, but even without these were company-worthy. They were not sweet, which my boyfriend missed, but I really liked it and part or all of the batch could be sweetened up for personal taste. Will be repeated, thanks very much for sharing!

Good for egg-free. Needs 1-2 Tbs honey or sugar if you want a slightly sweet result. Batter as written is not sweet at all.

Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I used it as a base and made a couple changes to suit our taste.  I added the cornmeal to the milk and water, along with a squeeze of lemon, an egg, a pinch of sugar and some vanilla.  This I let stand for five minutes, and added the flour, baking powder, salt and baking soda last (well, almost last, I added the blueberries dead last).  I used a little more flour than listed, cos of the extra liquid.  Cooked them in a nonstick pan with butter.  Fantastic.

Oh yeah another good recipe!
I was a little surprised they turned out as good as they did without any egg.
I used 1/3 orange juice and 1/4 cup water the water and Kamut flour instead of w.w. and added a tbs. of real maple syrup. I served with an awesome blueberry sauce from this site

My family thought these were different. The texture was a little weird and when I cooked them they stuck to the bottem of he pan even with more oil in the pan the second time. Also note that if you have picky eaters they might not eat them, because of the blueberries and the cornmeal the pancakes look like wierd green circles with blue blobs. the are Heavy in my opinion, I only ate three (I made mine small) and they are stuck at the bottem of my stomach.

Heeded the blandness warning, some cinnamon, vanilla and molasses spread went a long way.

This recipe as is, I agree with others, it is tasteless and flat! To make them yummy, this is what I changed....combine milk/soy, water, veg oil and cornmeal then set that aside! This will make the cornmeal softer :) Combine the rest of the ingredients plus 1/8 to 1/4 cup of brown sugar depending how sweet you would like them. You can also add a 1/2 tsp vanilla if you want to use less sugar. You need some sweetness with cornmeal, that's what makes is good! Now take your wet mixture that you set aside and beat in one egg! That is what is going to make them fluffy :) Add the wet to the dry mixture, mix until it is all combined and scoop into your hot pan. That's it!! I like to leave out the blueberries and heat them up in the microwave to make a type of compote and add it on top. They are also sooo good if you add a couple of slices of banana while cooking! The bananas soften and almost caramelize :) We just finished some and we all, including my 1.5 and picky 3 year olds loved them! Enjoy :)

I love these pancakes!  They have become a weekend staple in our house.  I use almond milk, and up the ratio of cornmeal to flour (cornmeal scoops are heaping and flour is scant)  Being a former vegan/vegetarian - this is the best!  I've also found that using a spray for the griddle (instead of oil) keeps the pancakes from getting that "first pancake" look and density.

I enjoyed making this recipe. I didn't have whole wheat flour, so I substituted all purpose flour and I don't think it made a huge difference in over all effect. Everyone who ate them liked them. I think you could use any fruit in them and they would be just fine.

After I read the reviews this is what I incorporated. I added some vanilla extract and some honey to the wet ingredients. I did not have whole wheat flour so I used regular flour and regular cornmeal. I also did not fold in the fruit. I topped them with fresh strawberries and syrup. They were not too sweet and were filling. Don't expect them to be really fluffy and airy. We are not vegans but this is a great base recipe.

Tasty pancakes!  I tweaked it a bit-- used half all-purpose and half whole wheat flours.  I also added about 2 tablespoons of honey for sweetness.  One thing kept this from 5 stars-- I use a cast iron griddle, but felt I needed to really go heavy on the no-stick spray to keep them from sticking.  That's unusual for this griddle, but I can't identify why this particular recipe was sticking...

These were pretty good, but a little bland.  Adding one Tbsp of sugar improved the flavor a little bit.  I might make them again, though, because it's nice to have an eggless pancake recipe sometimes.

This was a disappointment.  I wanted to taste the cornmeal, but instead they taste like buckwheat.  No flavor.  Won't make again.

I really liked these because they're tasty and relatively healthy. I added some lemon peel (grated and dehydrated) because I love the tastes of lemon and blueberry together. To make them fluffier I substituted club soda for the water. This is a keeper.

I really like these pancakes. I would suggest letting the batter sit maybe another couple of minutes, just because the cornmeal is still pretty gritty after 5, but otherwise I think these are a very filling, tasty, and healthy pancake.

Turned out ok, looked good. The taste through me off a bit, not sure I liked the flavor. It was easy to make. They looked good, my husband liked them, but I will not be making again do to my personal preference.

These were good. I used fat free soy milk and I assume that lowered the fat content some. I also used canola oil. Will definately make these again!!

Okay, I cheated a little.  I wanted to use my fresh blueberries but had no cornmeal, so I substituted semolina flour for the cornmeal.  Well, they were good and VERY filling.  Kind of a cross between a pancake and a muffin maybe?  Thanks!  Will try again when I get cornmeal since I need an eggfree pancake recipe.

Yummy! All I had on hand were thawed from frozen blueberries, but still very good! I put Smucker's raspberry syrup on them... mmmmm.... and filling, too!
