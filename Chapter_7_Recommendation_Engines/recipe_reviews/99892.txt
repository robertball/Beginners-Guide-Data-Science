We loved these, but they are a bit messy to eat.  I used thick cut bacon that I pre-cooked to the soft stage.  This way I avoided flare-ups on my grill and the bacon was crisp by the time the pork was cooked.  Next time, I probably use a tomato based sauce.

I can't wrap my head around mustard based sauces so I used regular ol Sweet Baby Ray's sauce and this was REALLY good. Cook the bacon before rolling it up. I seared it and finished it in the oven. Yummy.

This a great appitizer for summer, I pre-cooked bacon and used a teriyaki seasoned pork tenderloin, because thats what i had. I sliced loin longways then in half to make more, they were more managable to eat, I also used Famous Daves sweet & sassy the combo of teriyaki and sweet bbq sause was wonderful, Thanks for passing this along will be making again.

I took what some of the previous reviewers had said and cooked the bacon a little first.  I am not a huge pork fan but I could eat this again.  My husband loved it!

This was really very good.  The pork stayed very moist and tender. Next time, we will probably use a tomato-based bbq sauce instead of the yellow sauce.

This was so delicious! I sliced my tenderloin that was partially frozen into 1 inch round slices. Pre cooked the bacon slightly and let cool. Wrapped 1 and a half slices of bacon around it and secured with toothpicks. Then made a marinade with Webers Chipotle Marinade mix. Pored the marinade over the pork with the bacon wrapped around it and let that marinade for around half hour. Then cooked on the grill with our favorite red bbq sauce since we don't have mustard based sauces here. It was so good! Even my daughter that isn't fond of pork liked it! Thanks!

What a fun way to do something different with pork tenderloin.  These came together very quickly and I put them on metal skewers.  As per other reviews I did pre-cook the bacon for about 4 minutes - just until it was transparent.  I did not have a mustard base bbq so we used a Rhubarb Ketchup (AR recipe) sauce to baste while grilling.  Yes Tyler, we will be making this again.  Thank You.

I tried making these several months ago and they are fabulous! I highly recommend them. I usually serve baked beans and we NEVER have any left-overs. Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe.

It had a good flavor -we used Kraft red BBQ sauce since we didn't have mustard based sauce, but you have to really want to eat a lot of pork to enjoy it!

My family loved these.  I always have problems using toothpicks, they break, so I threaded 5 or 6 on metal skewers and pulled them off before serving.  Also, I like using Cavender's Greek Seasoning on pork.  I sprinkled the tenderloin strips with Cavender's before rolling them up.  No need for additional salt and pepper and the flavor is great!

Very, very good...but labor intensive. I had a hard time slicing the pork to roll well with the bacon. I think I will have the butcher slice it for me next time. I used the recipe "Best Carolina BBQ Meat Sauce" for the mustard-based sauce. It was perfect for this dish.

Was not good at all. Bacon doesn't get crisp, and the tenderloin was almost overdone. Although it was really easy to make, I wouldn't make this again.

Yummy! These are very very good and work great as an entree or an appetizer.  I will say it helps to pound the tenderloin thin and season them first.  I seasoned them with cajun seasoning and chili powder.  I only grilled them for about 10 minutes and finished them off in the oven covered with foil - this made them nice and tender and made sure they were cooked through.  I will definitely make again.

I gave this recipe to a friend. He made it for his family and watched it disappear as soon as he removed from the grill.

This was the first time I've ever had a Carolina-style BBQ sauce, and it won't be my last - this stuff is awesome! This recipe was quick and easy and delicious. We don't have the grill out since it's the dead of winter, so I cooked these in a grill pan on the stove top and they turned out perfect.
