Well, I'm not a fan of fruit salad in general, I had neither a fresh orange nor tinned pineapple, but I also was feeling like all I've been serving for dessert lately is a bowl of one type of fruit per evening.  So I made this with a tin of mandarin oranges (forgetting my husband's childhood-bred aversion to them--oops) and fresh pineapple, just squeezing juice out of the rinds into the dressing as I went, and, remembering some of these reviews, jerking my hand back before the whole teaspoon of poppy seeds tumbled in. Oh, also, I had no kiwi, but did toss in about 1/2 pint of fresh blueberries.  And it was all terrific!  Is it the poppy seeds that make it taste so special?  Whatever. I'm thinking of making another to bring to a pool party next week.  Katy, you've converted me to a fruit salad fan!  Well done!

A fruit salad is only as good as its parts...I'm giving this recipe three stars because I was not terribly impressed with the results of using canned pineapple. I found it produced a somewhat bland, watery sauce. That said, I like the idea of the recipe and will DEFINITELY make it again using fresh pineapple instead. The combination of citrus and honey is a delicious enhancement to fresh fruit without being overbearing. I have no doubt that using ll fresh fruit will make this a five-star fruit salad. Thanks for the recipe!

I used two cans of mandarin oranges, a can of pineapple, two kiwis, two small packages of blueberries and a package of strawberries and maybe a cup of grapes.  Given how much fruit I used, I figured I'd double the "dressing," but ended up with a little too much liquid.  I think I could have left the liquids the same, but still used the full teaspoon of poppy seeds and been just fine.  Even though it was a little liquidy in the bottom, everyone enjoyed it!

A wonderful combination of fruits!  You could also add a bit of sliced banana right before serving.  The dressing was just the thing to tie it all together, but I would use less poppy seeds next time.  Terrific...thanks for sharing Katy!

Good fruit salad Katy.  I didn't have the strawberries, so I added an extra orange.  The lime dressing is really good.  I'm not sure if you need as many poppy seeds as the recipe calls for.  I just sprinkled what I thought was enough over the top.  Will be a great summer salad!

I made this for an Easter picnic and everyone loved it; one of my friends even asked for the recipe!  I did use fresh pineapple instead of canned and I think I would put in less poppy seeds next time too.  It was even better the next day.

Very good. Don't use all the poppy seeds though. Unless you realllly love them. Just add a few and see how it is, then adjust to how many you think looks/tastes right.

We love this! I just use whatever fresh fruit I have on hand and it is a perfect light, refreshing addition to any menu. This time, I had fresh pineapple, watermelon, mango, blackberries, strawberries, kiwi and pomegranates. The dressing is a perfect match (omitted the poppy seeds.)  We will continue to enjoy this. Thanks for sharing!

This was quite good!  Tasted it as written, then doubled the lime juice- thought it needed more tang.  Also added a small watermelon, and that was the BEST part once it soaked up the juices.  Leftovers were a little soggy the next day, but made an awesome smoothie...

Wonderful, light, tangy fruit salad.  I made a few changes based on what fruit I had in the house.  First I used fresh pineapple and used mandarin oranges, so I didn't cut them.  Since I didn't have any reserved pineapple juice, I used a kiwi strawberry blend that my kids were drinking at the time and used lemon instead of lime juice.  I think this recipe lends itself to make it however you want with different fruits and juices.  I think it would be great just the way the recipe is written, but was also great the way we had it.  I love the crunch of the poppy seeds, the sweet fruit, the slightly tart dressing, and most of all, the fact that my kids loved it.  Thanks for a great, healthy, delicious recipe!

I'm giving this five stars on the basis of my single substitution of fresh pineapple and pineapple nectar in place of canned pineapple with its juice.  With this in mind, let me say that this recipe couldn't get any better.  All the ingredients were right on target and the perfect amounts.  There are a lot of reviews saying to cut back on the poppy seeds, don't.  Please try it as written before you make any changes because the poppy seeds set this recipe over the top and were not overpowering.  Simply put, fantastic.

Made this for Thanksgiving supper - very nice & light, got several compliments on the dressing although I wasn't overly impressed.  Perhaps it doesn't triple well.  Maybe a little more honey, the dressing was pretty "juicy". Seems like a good summer salad!

Absolutely amazing! Its so versatile. Just use whatever fruit you like or have on hand. I like using mandarin oranges instead of a normal orange, blueberries, and blackberries in addition to the original ingredients.

This was a beautiful looking salad.  The poppy seeds had people intrigued right off so they knew there was something different about *this* fruit salad.  The more comments made, the more of my co-workers came to check it out.  I went with fresh pineapple and juiced the flesh from the rind for the reserved juice.  The orange slices I sliced into three bite sized segments.  I was making for a somewhat large group of about 25 so I added more fruit than was indicated.  Used a whole pineapple, one orange diced as stated above, one kiwi, a little over a cup of strawberries, I halved red and green grapes and threw in a big handful of blueberries for color and at the last minute sliced up a banana.  I did not adjust the lime juice and poppyseed mixture to accomodate the add'l fruit as after reading previous reviews it seemed there was more than enough.  I really wish I had taken a picture because it was a beautiful mix of colors.  The entire bowl disappeared in the first 1/2 hour it was presented and several people asked what was in the 'sauce'.  Will definately make again.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I was craving fruit salad today and this hit the spot. There's no need to change a thing, but fresh fruit always tastes better. I loved the flavor the dressing gave the fruit.

Excellent!  I also added only 1/2-3/4 tsp. poppy seeds.  Very refreshing.  Would like to try it with fresh pineapple sometime as well as when strawberries are actually in season.

Made this yesterday for a group of 20 and this was a big hit. Excellent and quick. I did cut down a bit on the pineapples and increased the oranges. Our 5 year old who is very picky on the fruits enjoyed it a lot. Thanks for sharing this.

AMAZING! I have been making this for years now and the dressing makes any fruit combo taste fantastic! Just use whatever fresh fruit you have on hand. No more mediocre yogurt tossed fruit salads. People will ask for your secret recipe because this is the most amazing way to eat fruit!

Good.  Also used fresh pineapple (which is always worth it) and the juice from the rinds and less poppy seeds.  Thought it was good - don't care for the oranges as much in there.  I will do blueberries and bananas next time.

Very delicous.  The canned pinapple was great.  I didn't have fresh orange, so I used mandarin... I won't do that again becuase it added to much soupy-ness.  BUt, it was still delicous!  Also, I went without poppy seeds.

I used a whole fresh pineapple for a double batch. Canned = :(   I used far fewer poppy seeds per the suggestion of other reviewers. Actually just 1/2 tsp for a double-batch. That worked out well...a darn tasty and beautiful dish!

I recommend using all fresh fruit and omit the oranges.  I added blueberries.  The dressing is amazing and have gotten many raves.

Delicious! I loved the combination of fruits and the fact it's very tangy. I omitted the pineapple bacause I prefer to use fresh fruit in my fruit salads, but since I didn't have any pineapple I used a couple of peaches and also omitted the grapes. I doubled the amount of lime juice and it was perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

Taste was excellent.  I've taken it to an outdoor party, a work potluck and made it today at home.  Well received at the party and home-not well liked at work.  May have been the poppy seeds-people kept asking, "What are those black things?".  I omitted the lime zest and the poppy seeds at home (the lime was zested out!) and I liked that one best.

This is such a delicious fruit salad recipe.  I did use canned orange segments instead of fresh; I did add bananas; and I did decrease the amount of poppy seeds.  All in all, it is on my list of favorite 'company' salads.  Thanks, Katy.

Tried this recipe out for a family birthday party yesterday. I used fresh pineapple instead of canned and pineapple juice from a carton.  The sauce is EVERYTHING!  Sweet and tangy....and all the previous reviewers are right, this salad is even better the longer it marinates.

This recipe should be titled "Fresh Pineapple" Salad.  I took this to a family gathering & it was a hit.  Used Fresh Pineapple, didn't have any fresh strawberries, but did use fresh oranges, red and green grapes sliced in half, & Kiwi.  Did not add extra pineapple juice, used fresh squeezed lime with lime zest mixed with slightly heated honey, cooled before adding to fruit.  Did not add Poppy seeds, didn't need it. This recipe is a keeper for a fresh non-typical fruit salad.

I have made this fruit salad several times for summer cookouts and every time I have brought home an empty bowl.  It is light and refreshing and goes so well with grilled foods. The only change I made was to reduce the amount of poppy seeds...I used 1/2 tsp. instead of the full teaspoon suggested.

This is a great subtle addition, it is not at all overpowering to the natural taste of the fruits.  It's a different and still healthy to enjoy summer fruit.  I used all fresh fruits instead of canned just on personal preference.

It is excellent.  We have made it many times for company and after dinner dessert.  Everyone loves it.  I don't add poppy seeds because of our very young children who love this salad/dessert.

Wonderful!  I served on the side of a Carribean meal of jerk chicken and pineapple rice.  I didn't have fresh limes, so I used bottled Key lime juice, and it was still terrific.  I agree with others about cutting down the poppy seeds - 1/2 tsp. was plenty.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great mix of fruit. Dressing adds a nice flavor to the fruit. This dish was enjoyed by all who ate it. I did use fresh pineapple and less sesame seeds. Next time I would use red grapes instead of green for some more color.

Love this recipe. You can use most any fruit you want. But my favorite part about this recipe is the lime dressing. It's so simple, yet really wonderful. Oh, and I had no poppy seeds; so I substituted chia seeds, an added health benefit . The women @ Ladies Brunch were pleased.

You really can't go wrong with this recipe!  What a wonderful summer salad!  Don't count on their being leftovers either.  I used kiwi, red grapes, bananas (add last minute), pineapple and strawberries.  YUM!

This was too soggy and I didn't enjoy the flavor that much.  I wish i had just put all the fruit together in a bowl without any dressing...it would have been much better.

This was just "ok". I used fresh pineapple and also added Rasberry, Blueberry and Mangos. The dressing was alittle too tangy. I think I would change that up next time. I thought it had too much lime-citrus taste for the salad and didn't blend well with the other fruits.

Very good!  I added some mango and blueberries too and used fresh pineapple rather than canned.  Served it to friends and got rave reviews!

Love it!  I used canned mandarin oranges because the fresh oranges didn't look all that great.  I used fresh pineapple because there is nothing better!  It turned out wonderful.  Love the honey/lime dressing!  thanks for the great recipe, Katy!

YUM!!  This is really good!  I added a bit more honey because it was a bit too tangy at first.  I will make this again for sure!

Excellent and easy to make.  I used fresh pineapple instead of canned, and I used orange juice instead of reserved pineapple juice.  I also used the recommended 1/2 tsp poppy seed.  I might add more next time.  It has a delicious tang from the lime juice and lemon zest.  There was not a single piece of fruit left at brunch. This was devoured!

This salad was a huge hit at a recent family get together. I scaled the recipe to 8 servings and it was fantasic.  Substituted fresh pineapple for the canned. Also reduced the amount of poppy seed as suggested by other reviewers.  This is a really nice light dessert that I will enjoy again and again.  A big thumps up for this one.  Try it, you will not be disappointed.  Thanks Katy for a terrific recipe.

Great fruit salad.  Next time I will put less pineapple.  Pineapple flavor was a little too strong.  I also put more kiwi and stawberries than called for.  Will definitly make again.

Excellent recipe!  Very quick to make since most of the fruit used is low-maintenance.  I loved the fresh, sweet (but not too sweet) and slightly crisp flavor.  A big hit with all of my relatives who are sometimes hard to please.

I substituted kiwi for green grapes and it was just as delicious! We all loved the tangy zip of the lime juice with the sweetness of the fruit. We will be making variations of this all summer long as it's the perfect side to so many different summer meals.

I used strawberries, blackberries, green grapes, raspberries, fresh pineapple,  and bananas. The dressing seemed a little tangy for me so I added some honey. Overall it seemed lite and not too sweet. I might make this my go to fruit salad dressing.

I had quite a few oranges and strawberries to use up, and found this recipe. I made it just using those 2 fruits. This was very good!!  I think you could add most any fruit to this recipe.

I will eliminate the lime zest next time and add a little more honey.  I will warm the honey before adding the other ingredients as the honey didn't want to blend well.

Really loved this dressing.  Served it for guests at "Breakfast for Dinner" night, it was a hit.  You can use this dressing with any combination of fruit.  Fresh lime juice is crucial--don't use bottled!

We enjoyed this.  I doubled the dressing.  Will probably make again.  I used pineapple chunks (8 oz), 1 orange, 1 kiwi, some green grapes, some strawberries, and blueberries and the lime zest.  It was very good.  I used the dressing as is, except for an extra squirt of honey.

A very light and tasty fruit salad.  The flavor combinations were great together.  I used a fresh pineapple and also added some mango to the recipe.  I didn't get much juice from my pineapple, so I juiced a fresh orange instead.  I also used lemon in place of the lime because that's what I had on hand.  Very delicious!

I love fresh pineapple but can only eat about two bites and my mouth gets really sore. Canned pineapple is fine. So I'll stick with as written.

What can I say? It tastes like a fruit salad, which is as good as your fruit is fresh. Four stars because the poppyseeds were a bit much. Added some blueberries I had on hand for good measure.

Using canned pineapple for this salad gave it an artificial taste to me. All the other fruits were so fresh and wonderful. The dressing was good - next time I'll try it with fresh pineapple; I think that will make a huge difference.

This was really good.  I added raspberrys and left out the orange.  It first I thought the lime was overpowering, however once I let it sit for awhile and let all the flavers mix, it was good.  I also added fat free cool whip on top of each serving!
