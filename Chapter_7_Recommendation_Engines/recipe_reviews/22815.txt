I didn't understand why some people didn't like this very much.  I've made it a million times and we always love it.  It's quick and easy and a great accompaniment to soup or stew.  Then the last time I made it I actually had self-rising flour on hand (usually I make my own substitute).  It was no where near as good when made with self-rising flour.  I highly recommend using this substitue:  3 cups all purpose flour, 4 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt.  I know it seems like a lot of baking powder, but if you like a buttery slightly salty bread you'll love it.  I also always use butter on top, not margarine as the recipe states.  Finally, if you have it on hand, dark beer makes this bread even better.

The difference between this beer bread and the Beer Bread I, is the margarine/butter poured on top before baking. And it makes all the difference in the world. This bread is much better and has a much bettter crumb to it.  Sometimes I add Italian herbs and garlic powder. If you have problems with the margarine/butter overflowing into your oven just make a slit down the center of the bread, before pouring it on.  It helps control the direction of the melted margarine/butter and helps for more even distribution too.

I really liked this recipe. After buying a box of Beer Bread from Tastefully Simple for 4.00 and making it I knew I had to find a recipe to make this type of bread and lo and behold I found it here. This bread is so good and moist. I would love to experiment with different types of beer. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Great recipe. I also increased sugar to my preference. A note about playing with the flour. You can substitute any flour you like but if it is not self-rising you'll need to use some baking powder. The beer reacts with the soda in the the baking powder to help make the bread fluffier. Try adding 4 T of baking powder to your dry ingredients if you are using a flour that isn't self rising.

I tried this recipe because we LOVE the beer bread mix that we buy from "Tastefully Simple".  This recipe wasn't quite as sweet as the bread from "Tastefully Simple", but it was still good.  Next time I will add an extra tablespoon of sugar.

This recipe is amazing - who knew that you could make bread with only 3 ingredients? and in about 3 minutes?Fantastic! This recipe is extremely adaptable. I've made it twice now, each time adding grated cheese and garlic and onion powder. The second time I added a bunch of dried herbs (rosemary, basil, oregano, thyme) and it was sensational! Next time I might try adding spanish chorizo. I love the crunchy/chewy crust that it forms! I have used both self-raising and plain flour + baking powder and room-temperature and cold beer and each combination worked out fine. GREAT recipe!

I've tried this recipe a while back and it is very bland to me. I tried it again increasing the sugar to 1/2 cup and it was awesome! I baked mine for 50 min at 350. The kids gobbled it up.

Who would have thought so few ingredients would make such a great bread! People kept asking how to make this and thought it came out of bread machine.  The butter melted on top made a nice crust and all I did was increase the sugar to 6 Tbsp.  I can't wait to make this again and play with some herbs and spices added to the batter.  Thanks!

I've been making this bread for years.  It's delicious warm from the oven and has a wonderful crust due to the butter...don't omit that part!  It's great with dill added for tomato soup, shredded cheddar added with chili....you get the idea.  It's not a good keeper for me, however, and is best eaten warm from the oven.  A mild beer is best in my opinion, also.

I too was looking to recreate Tastefully Simple's bread because I live in Japan now and can't get it here! This bread is definitely a great substitute. I don't have self-rising flour so I followed the directions given by reviewer SynevaB on 12/18. Also I used ginger ale which is delicious and I only needed to cook mine for 38 minutes. It was perfectly moist! Tonight I also made "Kettle Corn" from this site and it is awesome too!

I sent my daughter to the grocery store for flour and she brought back self-rising flour by mistake.  I did not want it to just sit on my pantry shelf, so I looked up things that used this kind of flour. I never, ever, baked bread before, though it was too much trouble. But, I decided to try it. This recioe was great! I make it all the time now. Thanks Vickie.

This recipe turned out wonderful.  Hubby works at a beer distributor and took this for a potluck lunch.  It was the first to go.  I added some shredded mozzerela, minced dried garlic, and parsley to the flour before adding the beer to make it "Italian".  I also split into 2 loaves and allowed the batter to rise in the pans for about 30 minutes before baking.  They turned out lighter and fluffier this way.  Great recipe!!

Yum! I used 3 cups of all-purpose flour 3/4 tsp salt and 4 tsp baking powder. I also only used around TBS sugar because I used a can of Sprite instead of beer.:) I only used 2 TBS margarine mixed with a couple shakes of garlic powder and I used two 5.75" x 3" loaf pans. They only took around 35 minutes to bake and they go great with the Chicago Dip (a spinach dip) off this site. Oh and I put a baking sheet under the pans in the oven to catch the margarine overflow. Yummy salty buttery.. Delicious! Thanks for sharing Vickie!

It s an O.K bread only nothing too special about it. I did have trouble with the baking time...becuase on my 1# try it got burnt at the bottom which I had to throw it away.On my second time it came out just right but I did reduce the timing. It was ready in almost ready in 35 minutes.So be careful!! do to the fact you don t want to threw the first one away. The flavor was also quiet dull.

Super nice bread! Hubby absolutely loved it since I used his favorite dark beer! Increasing the sugar to 1/2 cup is a great hint. I also substituted the self-rising flour for: 3 cups all-purpose 4 1/2 teaspoons baking powder and 1 teaspoon salt. Instead of butter/margarine I brushed the top of the mixture with milk which gave the crust a beautiful texture and color. Baking in a glass 8x8 pan reduced cooking time to 30 minutes. I've started another family tradition with this Brew Bread!

YUM! I did modify to use all purpose flour as others had posted. Any carbonated drink will work for beer bread - it alters the taste a little. The first time I made this recipe, I used root beer. It was great!

After preparing this recipe today, we found it delicious.  I don't think it has the yeasty flavor of Tastefully Simple's or Pampered Chef's beer breads, and it is also much lighter.  It is very thick upon mixing, unlike some purchased mixes.  I also only baked it for 45 minutes in a stoneware loaf dish, and it was perfect and moist.  I served it cubed with a garlic dip mixture of 8 oz. cream cheese, 4 oz. mayo, 1 t. garlic powder, 1 t. dried parsley flakes, and 1/2 teaspoon of seasoned salt and the kids went nuts over it.  I will bake some of these for gifts for Christmas, and maybe try freezing a couple to have on hand for company, for sure.

So I haven't finished this recipe yet but it just started my new oven (this is the second time I'm using it.)on fire when the the bread rose and pushed the melted margarine onto the heating element. A couple shakes of baking soda fixed the problem so if I can collect myself I will proceed with an old cookie sheet under the pan to catch the drippings.

I loved this recipe.  It couldn't be more simple.  I used another reviewers substitution for self rising flour and added one extra tbsp of sugar.  I only had plain old Bud Light on hand, but it turned out great.  It only had a mild beer taste so the kiddo's loved it.  This recipe will become a staple in this house!!!

I followed the advice of several reviewers and added 4 Tablespoons of baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon of salt due to using all-purpose flour.  Used Miller Lite beer.  Beautiful bread.  Sliced right out of the oven, brushed with butter and added cheddar cheese for garlic toast.  Love this recipe and will make it a lot!

Yummy!!  If you want to make it even easier - use Bisquick.  Just add 1/4 C to 1/2 cup sugar depending on how sweet you want it.  I usually bake mine in muffin tins and pair it up with chicken corn chowder or vegetable soup.  Oh yeah....I've found that good old Bud (not light) gives it the best taste.

I didn't have self-rising flour so used someone else's suggestion of 3 c all-purpose flour + 4 1/2 tsp baking powder + 1 tsp salt. Thought the butter was a bit much so only used about 2/3 of it but bread was a little dry compared to the Tastefully Simple recipe so would put in all of the butter next time. Would also probably put 1 Tbsp more sugar in next time, per other reviewers. Didn't allow myself enough time to get the beer to room temp so put it in a water pitcher with warm water.

I have followed this receipt for several years, but this I eliminated the beer and replaced it with 7up.  The result is the same texture and lightness, however the bitter aftertaste from the beer is gone. Also, I did shorten the baking time to around 40 minutes.

I made this when I had a Pampered Chef party once and the consultant thought I had used a PC mix for it.  Why spend $6 for 2 loaves when you can make a loaf for pennies!  It makes a great gift for people too.

Excellent! My husband and I both love to cook and therefore are pretty critical-
I did look at the other reviews and added a bit more of sugar. I also included a pinch of paprika, dried parsley, garlic powder and about a 1/4 cup of parmesean cheese. Also, I used about 1/2 the amount of butter. We served it with vegetable beef stew and it was great. Thank you for this keeper...

A great hit with my boys! I add 1 tsp of italian seasonings and 1 tsp of garlic powder to mine. I've made it with Shark Top Sam Adams Winter Lager and OBP2. (The Shark Top is probably my favorite but the men preferred the Winter Lager.)

This is a wonderful and easy and quick bread to make for dinner. Goes well with zesty soups and stews. My family is a 'big bread with dinner eating family' so this is nice when ya don't feel like making biscuits cornbread or yeast bread/rolls. You can zest it up too by adding different spices/seasonings. Just let it cool slightly before slicing.

Exactly as the recipe called for it was pretty good.  About even number liked it that didn't.  I can see without the sugar and some shredded cheese and garlic and herbs it could be wonderful.  It was SOOO easy though and it was nice to have bread to serve with the meal.  45 minutes definitely.  60 minutes would have made it far too dry and perhaps burnt.

My husband and I don't drink beer so when I had to buy beer to make the French Dip sandwiches I didn't know what to do with the extra beer.  Thank you Allrecipes.com. This bread was very easy and delicious.  Looking forward to experimenting with it, maybe making rolls/biscuits with it!
****3/38/10-made rolls out of the dough.  Spooned it into cupcake pan (made 15).  Baked 350 for 15 min.  Don't forget to pour the melted butter on top before baking, otherwise looks kind of anemic!

I love beer bread and have been working from this recipe for a while.  Since I do not buy self-rising flour I use 4 T baking powder in additionn to the other dry ingredients.  Recently I brought a loaf to party and my friend's mother who is a retired home ec teacher loved it so much she asked for the recipe!

This was wonderful. I made it for a party and had to print off 4 copies for friends. I made it exactly as specified except I didn't use self rise flour (I didn't have any). To make your own self rise flour: 1 1/2 tsp baking powber and 1/2 tsp salt for every cup of flour.

I used the flour mixture in previous reviews, and it came out great.  I added a 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese to the dough and some garlic powder and it came out kind of like Red Lobster biscuits in slice form.

So easy & yummy! I think this tastes almost identical to Tastefully Simple beer bread mix that is so expensive this is a great alternative & just as simple. For the reviews that said it was dry I think they over baked it I only baked mine about 40 to 45 minutes. Wonderful recipe!

This had an interesting flavor and it definitely gets points for being very easy. Never had beer bread before so not sure if I would make it again as we didn't particularly love it. I used my beer straight from the fridge and it still came out fine. Made my own self-rising flour. I thought it might benefit from the addition of some cheese or other add-ins.

A loaf of bread start to finish in an hour and 10 minutes. Wow! Other than the ease of preparation and the wonderful taste my house had the smell I remember from my mom's house when she baked bread all day. I did use a premium lager and another spoonful of sugar. It was the perfect bread for the vegetable beef soup I had made for dinner. There isn't a crumb left after hubby wrapped up the leftovers and took it to work with him today for his lunch. Thank you Vickie for sharing a recipe I'll make many times over for my family!!

Great recipe! If you are serving this bread with a main meal - I wouldn't take the suggestions below to add more sugar. I made this recipe with self-rising cake flour. I might add some dried or fresh parsley next time though. This loaf was great - after tasting it - I'd call it: Beer Biscuit Loaf - because it tastes like homemade biscuits. Delicious!!!! Perhaps a bit of crumbled cooked bacon for a twist!!! 10/15/04 - Made this a second time - but with regular flour and didn't like it! Will always use cake flour for this recipe!!!!!

I'm not a beer drinker, but finding a lone bottle from the holidays made me think of trying this. Unbelievable Good! The beer was an apple cider ale, I can't imagine what reg. beer would be like, but this one was soooo good. I used about 6 T sugar, should've used a bit of cinnamon too!  For the reviews about it being bland- they picked out the beer! Definitly will be buying beer now. I imagine Blue Moon--I think orangy-would be good. Super easy. P.S. It does rise a good bit, remember that with the butter top, mine started about 1 inch from the top of pan and just barely missed having the butter go over.

I was disappointed in this recipe. I love the Tastefully Simple Beer Bread mix and was hoping that this recipe would produce a similar loaf. This recipe produced a very dry loaf of bread and the flavor was lacking. I might try it again but the next time I will add some cooking oil to the batter to see if it comes out moister.

Fantastic! I've been using this recipe for awhile. I used one of the PC mixes. I thought there had to be a cheaper way. Actually I like this better. I'm going to try adding some of the extras after reading more reviews. We love it with stew soup and sometimes for dessert. Thanks so much for sharing it!!

This bread was good basic. It was a little greasy when I first took it out of the oven probably because of the butter but after it cooled a bit I liked it a lot better. I wasn't paying attention and put butter on top instead of margarine the first time I made it. Then the second time I used margarine like the recipe calls for and actually preferred it the other way. Made two loaves and 45 minutes was just perfect. Will deffinately make it again very easy!

I didn't have self-rising flour so I used the substitution in one of the comments--3 cups flour 4 1/2 tsp 1 tsp salt. I also subbed 1 cup of whole wheat flour for one of the cups of all purpose flour. Used butter instead of margarine of course--but I put the bread pan on a baking sheet because some of the comments mentioned the butter overflowing. It did and I was glad for the baking sheet to catch it. The bread is moist and yummy but the top and bottom crusts are a little bit hard to cut through which I find to be somewhat common with beer breads and it doesn't bother me--Once you toast it it's wonderfully crunchy. I used a good stout beer and it had a wonderful flavor. I'll definitely make it again.

Wonderful recipe that results in a thick dense very satisfying beer bread. I used a Leinie's Sunset Wheat and the flavor of the beer came through beautifully without being overpowering. I am looking forward to using highly hopped flavorful beers - specifically Three Floyds' Alpha King seems like it would make an interesting bread.

This bread came out spectacular spectacular. I used Guinness and some grated sharp cheddar along with some basil thyme garlic powder and white pepper. Next time I make it I'll leave it in longer (only baked for 45 minutes this time). A great loaf especially with a slice of cheese on top!

I'm giving the recipe 5 stars even though I think I may have chosen the wrong beer. I used the Sam Adams blackberry wheat beer and drank one as it baked. When I tried a slice just now it kind of freaked me out to taste the same thing in both solid and liquid form. I'm not sure how I feel about the way the blackberry flavor stays in the bread an orangey beer like shock top may have been a better choice. The recipe is VERY simple though and I'm glad to have found something so cool/cheap/easy to make. I sifted my flour FYI. And I used salted butter instead of margarine. Anyway I can't wait to try this with a stout or porter. I think I know what will happen to the leftover St. Patrick's Day Guinness in my apartment. I'll bet the chocolate/coffee taste of that beer will be totally different from this one. - an update. I made it with some dark chocolate-tasting ale (Dos Perros from a brewery in TN?) and a bit of cinnamon. It was MUCH better.

I would give this 4 stars..but my daughter who actually made this rated it 2 stars So I've decided to settle on 3. This bread has alot of potential. ALONE it's not all that great. I will be making this again Because it is crazy EASY.... Next time I will be adding garlic powder Fresh rosemary....and any other herb I can find that will suit this bread.... It is very very DENSE. So be aware of that. Thanks for sharing. I will be trying this again... I'll let you know how it all turns out

Very good and couldn't be easier to make! I skipped pouring the butter on top (although I know it would have made it even yummier!) but it was still great.

I love this recipe! It is so simple and easy. The only 2 things I have learned to chanfe is to add more sugar and bake it for about 30-35 minutes. I use the smartware baking pans so I am not sure if that is why the baking time makes such a differnce. All I know is that I make it all the time and it's a winner over and over! PS much cheaper than the tastfuly simple beer bread for sure and its even better I think.

I usually buy a mix for beer bread but thought I'd try making it from scratch since I love baking. It just didn't compare. This recipe has great reviews so maybe it's just a matter of personal taste but I'll continue buying the mix.

I was disappointed in this recipe. I too was looking for a recipe to replace the expensive but yummy Tastefully Simple mix that we love and always get rave reviews about. I followed this recipe to a 'T.' and it turned out very dry and tastless even with taking it out of the oven a tiny bit early. Might do some research on "tweeks" and try again. Others seem to like. Thanks for the recipe

This is awesome & so so easy. Gave the recipe to husband's secretary today. I did increase the sugar to 1/2 cup let it rest in pan 10 min thern poured 1/4 cup melted butter over before baking. Came out great. Plan on putting mix in jars for gifts. How simple is that?

How easy was that? Turned out great with a heavy Porter for flavor. Am going to make again and add spices while using a lighter beer to accompany pasta. I did take other reviewers advice and use three cups all purpose flour and 4.5tsp baking powder. I had salted butter so left out extra.

Very good! This IS a very biscut-y bread. I used Apple Spice beer and the hint of apple was quite nice. Next time I'll probably use the same beer only add cinnamon as well to enhance those flavors.

EXCELLENT! I used Yuengling Lager and this bread came out tasting fantastic! Smells great and easy to make. I followed some others' suggestions and doubled the amount of sugar and it tastes great but I made it as a side for lasagne and sweet bread just didn't seem to match well so I guess it just depends on what you're making it for. Next time if I'm making this to accompany a red sauce dish again I'll keep the reccommended amount of sugar and add some garlic and cheese instead. I did like the sweet bread for breakfast with some butter. Fantastic!

SO sorry to rate this when I changed something but I didn't have self rising flour so I had to add some salt and baking powder (4 1/2 tsp powder and 1 tsp salt). That being said we really liked this! I'm not even a beer fan and it still gets a four from me. Just know before you make it that it tastes very strongly of beer.

We ve made this bread at least 200 times and have never had an issue with it not tasting amazing. We prefer it sweeter so we add 5 Tablespoons of sugar. We serve it with the garlic galore dip mix recipe from Wildtree and the combo is to die for.

I have used this recipe on numerous occasions and everyone loved it. The only change i made was I used a Pottery bowl in which I make. Instead of preheating your oven like in the recipe When using a pottery bowl You place the it in a "COLD" oven. By using this type of pottery bowl makes the bread more old timey so to speak. Thank you for the wonderful recipe I will use it often.

AMAZING!! I've had problems before with the breads not rising so I added 1tsp of baking powder just to be sure....beautiful. I also used 5 TBS sugar instead of 3 because I was using strong beer. Perfect. I didn't need all of the butter before baking but used the remainder when the loaf came out of the oven.

This is one of my most favorite quick bread recipes. I had to stop making this bread so often because we just couldn't stop eating it! When I make it I find it goes best with my crockpot beer chili and crockpot beef stew. My kids get such a kick out of eating bread with beer in it.

Delicious! Tried this for the first time. Added 4 tablespoons of sugar instead of 3. My loaf was done in 45 minutes. Variance between 45 -60 minutes must be the type of loaf pan used. I used glass so it took less time. Can't wait to try different ingredients such as raisins and cinnamon.

I was looking for a recipe similar to Wind and Willow beer bread. This was pretty close but the texture was not quite there. I added a cup of sugar since i like a sweeter bread. Looking forward working with the texture and trying different beers.

I've never had beer bread before so with nothing to compare it to i was a little nervous. I just finished a piece warm out of the oven and it was heavenly! Having read the reviews i upped the sugar to 1/2 cup and used regular all purpose flour plus baking powder and salt. I used Rickards Red this time around and already can't wait to start experimenting with this recipe. Now i just have to resist going back for more or i'll have to bake another loaf before hubby gets home just so he gets a taste!

This recipe is easy and it tastes great. I've made it several times and the outcome really depends on the type of beer used. Recently I used a vanilla porter and it came out sweet and delicious. I plan to use a cocoa porter tonight. When I used Guinness it came out more savory but still great. The recipe still worked when I forgot to make adjustments for high altitude cooking (I live at 6000ft above sea level). Really you can't go wrong.

Good texture and great for a first try of making from scratch. (I LOVED Trader Joe's beer bread mix which they have discontinued). I didn't have self-rising so I added 1 1/2 tsp salt and 4 1/2 tsp baking powder. I also added 1 tsp garlic powder but it was still lacking in flavor a bit-- will add a little something else next time. Will definitely make again though!

Certainly not as good as I had hoped it would be. Came out chewy and very crusty. An extremely dense bread. Not one of my "keepers."

This bread was great! My family loved it! But I did make it with half white sugar and half brown...just because some of the other recipes called for it. But over all it was a great quick and easy bread!

This is the greatest. I make my own SR flour and it's so easy to make. Sorry Tastefully Simple - yours is great too but why pay 4?

Great and easy recipe. Beer bread makes into amazing cinnamon sugar toast or French toast.

OUTSTANDIND recipe and very simple. Tastes just like Tastefully simple. I made it twice once with a light beer and once with a dark lager beer. The lager one tasted better plus had a more appealing color to the bread. Cube the bread and serve with hot spinach and artichoke dip.

This recipe is great! So simple and the bread turns out great every time. I usually have to add extra flour and then shape it into a loaf before baking.

I used this site s Self-Rising Flour recipe since all I had was all-purpose. This bread was so easy to throw together and have ready to go with my Quick and Easy Chicken Noodle Soup also on this site. The best part is that crusty top!

I liked it a lot and my husband did also.... I poured the melted butter on the top before baking.... I did use only 2 teaspoons of baking powder, because I didn’t want it to taste “baking-powdery”.... It probably would have raised a bit higher with the 3 teaspoons, but I was happy with 2.... Best part is how quick and easy it was to make.... Will definitely make again.... Use a hand mixer....

If I could give 10 stars I would! This is the best beer bread. It taste just as good as the "tastefully simple" one. AND costs less. A win win!

Everyone really liked this. I thought it was ok. Not QUITE as good as the tastefully simple boxed beer bread. I can't understand why though since the ingredients are the same and I used the same type of beer as was used in the T.S. bread I had before. My four-yr-old niece lOVED it. It was a little TOO beer-y. So maybe a little less beer. It's better with Cheddar and garlic. I made this a few ways. I tried with a smoked bacon-cheddar cheese and that was the best. Just mix the shredded cheese in with the flour.

This is my son's favorite treat. I originally found it in my grandmother journal which was lost in a previous move. So glad I can make it again.

This is a winner in our household. So easy and so so tasty. We love to thick slice the bread and pop it in the toaster and then smother in butter. OH MY MY MOUTH IS WATERING!!!

Super tasty & super easy! I've tried it a few different times with different micro-brew beers. Some of the richer beers are overwhelming in my opinion so although I love strong micro-brews I like this bread best w/ St. Paulie Girl beer and a handful of quality grated sharp cheddar. YUM. My 10 yr old daughter tries to think of dinner ideas that work around this beer bread because she's so crazy about it.

I just made this and it was very good! I do think that some additional spices or herbs would really make this a great bread. But it really couldn't be easier!

I make this just as the recipe states about 50% of the time. My family loves this and whenever I make it there is never any left after dinner. Have also added a large handful of grated cheese roasted garlic fresh herbs or whatever else is on hand and the family loves it too.
