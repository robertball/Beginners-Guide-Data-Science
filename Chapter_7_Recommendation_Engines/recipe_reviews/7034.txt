This bread was awesome! It was just like the one that the rustic bakery down the street from my house sells.  Like others who commented on this recipe, I substituted molasses for the dark corn syrup.  I did not use a bread machine, rather I mixed everything, let it rise for about an hour. punched it down, formed it into a large round loaf, and cut deep "vents" in a star pattern across the top and baked for about 35 minutes at 350 degrees. GREAT RECIPE!!! And easy...Update: I made this again but added 2 t. onion powder and it was AMAZING!!!

I am a 91 year old [WW-2 Marine] who has been making bread going on 2 years now.  Recently have acquired a used bread machine and use it to work the dough and take it thru the 1st rise.  Then I divide in 2 regular loaf pans and let rise again and then bake.  Have for breakfast every morning toasted with orange marmolade and black coffee.  It is good enough to help me get to 100.

This is perhaps the very best bread I have ever eaten in my life! I butter the slices and make a sandwich from Cloverdale Tangy Summer Sausage, Koop's Horseradish Mustard, and sharp cheddar.  It's wonderful!  I use real butter in the recipe.  I must CAUTION anyone that is going to try this recipe to go light on the yeast to begin with.  The top of the loaf over raised and hit the lid of my Hitachi machine four times.  I cut the amount of regular Fleischmann's Active Dry yeast each time and found that about 1-1/4 tsp. is about the correct amount. This bread has a nice crisp crust and soft cake-like texture unlike any other dark bread you may have tried. The little bit of fennel seed really does make a big difference.

My Russian friend says this is very close to the bread she grew up on in the Ukraine. She says all that is missing is to brush a little egg white onto the top before baking and sprinkle with course salt.

THIS IS EXCELLENT!  The only changes I made to this: 2 T corn oil not margarine, 2 T Malt Syrup, found at health food store,  and 1 1/4 yeast which was plenty, I set mine on dough, then when the bread machine beeped, I took mini loafs and placed dough in several loaf pans.  Let them raise to about double in size and baked at about 350 degree oven for 30-35 minutes.  You could not find much better russian bread than this one.  I make it often now. and LOVE It!  Best... receipe you can find on here for bread... if you like Rye flavor go for it.. Thanks Mary!

Excellent recipe.  I did not have instant coffee granules and the bread was absolutely delicious.  Guest comments were "better than any dark bread I've ever had", "very moist, delicate flavour".  This will be a regular bread recipe for sure!

I bought Russian black bread and loved it.....this recipe is even better and so easy to make in a bread machine. It is the perfect bread to serve with a hearty soup...especially borscht!

Oops!Too much yeast. The bread was too high even for my 2lbs machine. Not quite authentic though. While it was baking and I was smelling the aroma I had much higher hopes. After tasting it I am still not dissapointed but it is not quite what I had hoped for.

I thought the bread was great. I did not have bread flour, just regular flour.I was out of gluten so I was wondering how it would all work. I substituted molasses for corn syrup, and olive oil for margarine. I added two teaspoon onion powder. The bread turned out great, it was moist and flavorful. The bread was nice and soft. It would make a nice sandwich bread, also would go great with many soups.

WARNING: If you make this recipe in a 1 1/2 pound loaf bread machine, even if you only use 1 1/4 tsp yeast, the dough rises too high and overflows the pan.  This recipe uses over 3 and 1/2 cups dry ingredients, and most 1 1/2 pound loaf bread machines recommend using at max 3 cups.  Just a fair warning before you try this recipe!

This recipe is AMAZING.  I love a good, heavy homemade bread with lots of flavor, and this does NOT disappoint!
Minor quibble:  instructions only assume the cook uses a bread machine.  This recipe is also easily prepared the traditional way:
1.  Combine the dry ingredients (except yeast)
2.  Combine the yeast and the wet ingredients, except the butter (I always use unsalted butter for breads.)
3.  Mix the wet and dry ingredients together.  Add the softened butter, then turn out onto a floured surface and knead until smooth and firm.
4.  Return the ball of dough to a greased bowl, cover, and put in a warm place to rise until doubled in size, about an hour or so.
5.  Punch down, then turn out and separate into two portions.
6.  Form each portion into a loaf and put into loaf pans.
7.  Cover loaf pans and allow dough to rise again until doubled in size, about another hour.
8.  Bake at 350 for about 40 minutes until crust is golden and bread sounds hollow when thumped.
9.  Put loaves out onto a wire rack to cool.

Optional:  you may want to brush egg white over the loaves and sprinkle with kosher salt and/or sesame seeds just before baking for extra-attractive and delicious crust!

This bread was fabulous!  I made it without a bread machine and as I was writing down my mixing process,  I realized that I made a mistake and used 2 pkgs of yeast instead of 2tsp.  That explains why the texture was soft and fluffy. Perfect for sandwiches. I know this bread is supposed to be dense and heavy, but I really liked the results using the 2 pkgs of yeast. Please refer to my customized version of this recipe for detailed steps on how to make this without a bread machine.

Excellent bread. For authentic flavor, forget fennel seeds - you must use charnuskas (czarnuskas), sometimes called black caraway or onion seed, nigella sativa (similar to the black cumin seeds sold for Indian cooking, but try to get the Russian version, available from specialty spice places like Aphrodisia in NYC). I didn't use coffee either; I used more brown sugar, no corn syrup; butter & oil instead of margarine. There's plenty of rise in this bread, so next time I will try also adding some toasted barley flour.

Very good bread. Thought that with a ful cup of rye flour it be very dense but it wasn't. 2 teaspoons of yeast is plenty. One of my favorites.

My Ukrainian wife liked it!!!  I first baked it as is, came out great.  However, the 2nd time I made it I subbed 1 cup of the bread flour with whole wheat instead. (ran out of bread flour)  I also added 2 tablespoons of gluten and used an extra 1/2 teaspoon of yeast.  It came out more soft & fluffy and less dense.  A good tasting & well balanced bread.  The vinegar is a must.

This is a flavorful, dark bread. It has become a standard for my family. It makes the best sandwiches and keeps well.  Sometimes I add dried cranberries and nuts.

This is a really good loaf of bread. We didn't have coffee granules, so I replaced a half cup of the water in the recipe with a half cup of regular coffee.

Good bread.  I used molasses, and combined with the rye, this made the bread very sticky (a problem since I hand-kneaded).  However, adding 1/2 c more flour made it managable and the texture was still great.  Would have preferred a harder crust, so maybe next time I will play with the oven temp. (I also steamed the oven.)  FYI- Don't worry about the taste/smell of the vinegar; it fades to a nice "bite" after a day.

A lovely tasting bread.  Though not all that authentic, it makes a chewy and surprisingly light loaf.  I substituted black strap molasses for the corn syrup to give it more of a bite and flax seeds because I just love them.

This bread is excellent, very hearty and thick. I followed the instructions other than using black molasses for the corn syrup and cut the cocoa back to 2 tbsp. Mixed it in my KitchenAid, then baked in the oven. I did notice this bread takes a lot longer to rise. Not sure why. 5 stars and highly recommended!

Excellent bread. It has a slightly bitter aftertaste which we didn't mind. I made 2 changes, 1. I used wine vinegar instead of cider vinegar and 2. I substituted 1 3/4 tsp of bread machine yeast for the regular yeast. (it rose to just the right height). The only thing I might do differently next time is add more caraway seeds because we really love them.

I loved this bread.  I had to add additional flour to mine because it was really sticky.  The flavor is perfect to go with corned beef.

WOW. This bread is amazing- rich, complex taste, great texture, it doesn't even need anything on it! I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of bread flour, 3 tablespoons of molasses instead of the corn syrup/ brown sugar, olive oil instead of margarine, and the 2 tsp of onion powder recommended below. I don't have a bread machine- I mixed everything together, let it double, punched it down, and let it rise in a loaf pan. It makes a dense, sticky dough that takes a while to rise, but you don't need any extra flour. Baked at 350 for 1 hour.

Loved this! Was planning on having a Reuben so went out and bought pastrami, deli Swiss cheese, and sauerkraut with horseradish mustard. First bite was simply divine. Used molasses instead of dark corn syrup. Used real butter as I don't like margarine. Used the fennel seed as well. Also added 2 teaspoons of wheat gluten. This has to be one of the best breads I've ever made and I make nearly a different kind every day while living here in the US and missing our European breads! Will make this again!

This recipe turned out delicious.  The only reason I gave 4 stars is that it was too big for my bread machine and made a huge, burnt, doughy mess on the lid :(  I will use this recipe again in the future and just make dinner rolls!  It went perfectly with my corned beef and cabbage dinner.

Greatttttt Bread!!! I use molasses instead of corn syrup, and double or triple up on the caraway and fennel seed. Sometimes I grind the fennel. My wife says that it tastes like the bread she ate while in Europe.  I make it often.

We make variations of this every week.  The recipe calls for too much yeast and will stick to the lid of your bread machine if you use 2 teaspoons.  Try 1-1/4 teaspoons instead.  We normally use a European setting instead of the whole wheat setting.  The dark corn syrup works OK, but try malt syrup or molasses for variation.  The malt syrup (my favorite) seems to turn out a little sweeter; the molasses has a little more of a "bite."  I prefer corn oil to the margarine, but either will work OK.  We eat about half of the loaf, and use the other half to make kvas.

This recipe is so awesome.  It is incredibly tasty, I have made it 3 times in the past week.  It rises like crazy, I've cut down the yeast a little and will have to do it again as it opens the lid on my Philips.  Everyone who has tasted this bread cannot say enough about it - they love it, thanks for sharing this wonderful bread recipe.

Love this recipe. I used vegetable oil in place of margarine, molasses in place of dark corn syrup, and all-purpose flour in place of the bread flour, simply because it was what I had on hand. I had no instant coffee and so omitted it, but the bread still came out great. I mixed and kneaded with the dough hook of a stand mixer, let rise in a warm place for about 1.5 hours, transferred to oiled loaf pans to rise for an additional 30 minutes, and baked for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. The bread was incredibly moist and flavorful. I made three loaves for my co-op house and they disappeared within half a day.

I searched for a while for a good dark rye bread recipe and so far this one is a winner. As  fredjbuck  suggested I added 2 tbsp gluten and 1/2 tsp yeast, also used dark brown sugar instead of corn syrup and accidentally forgot margarine :) .
Came out perfect.

This is similiar to Lithuanian dark rye bread that I am familiar with.  To get a more "sour" taste, I decreased the water and increased the vinegar to 1/4 cup.  I also substituted molasses for the dk corn syrup. I used this recipe to make 4 bread bowls and served mushroom soup in them. It's a dish we always look forward to eating at a traditional restuarant when we visit Lithuania.

This bread is great, I will make it again. Very moist and fluffy. Some changes I made: All-purpose flour instead of bread flour, olive oil instead of margerine, molasses instead of corn syrup. Also, I mixed everything in an electric mixer and baked for 40min in an oven (I don't have a bread machine). Finally, I brushed the top with egg whites and coarse salt.

I have been experimenting with Rye Bread recipes since I volunteered to donate 2 home baked loaves for the church's Lutefisk dinner. This is the one!! I made it w/the help of my KitchenAid mixer and shaped it into 2 smaller round loaves on a cookie sheet. Excellent flavor, moist, and rose just perfectly. I also used molasses in place of the dark corn syrup. Otherwise, I used all of the ingredients as listed.

Good recipe.  I tried it, because my wife is Russian, and we both love black bread.  It didn't really taste the same to us, but the taste is at least as good.  I would call this a pumpernickel.  I modified it a little and by now have made ten loaves at least.  

As written, this dough was too wet for my machine.  I'm recommending 1.25 cups of water instead of 1.5.  (Also, I live at 6300 feet -- or 1920 meters-- above sea level, and half a teaspoon of active dry yeast up here is plenty.  More yeast creates a giant bubble atop the loaf that subsequently implodes into a bowl shape.)

I use 1.5 tsp of salt instead of 1, and I add a quarter teaspoon of dill seed as well.  Both changes improve the taste, I think.  Substituting molasses for dark corn syrup works fine, as does butter for margarine, but neither of these latter two substitutions particularly improves the flavor.

Awesome bread!  I increased the yeast  to  4 teaspoons, I used the 2# loaf and light crust setting and the Express Bake cycle on my Sunbeam Bread Machine.  In less than an hour it's done. It's my favorite loaf so far.  I wouldn't think of buying store shelf bread.

This bread was outstanding!  So soft and moist.  I used molasses in place of the dark corn syrup only because that is what I had.  I also cut the caraway seeds in half but next time, I'll probably follow the amount listed.  This is a brown bread with a mild rye taste.  Excellent for sandwiches like corn beef, ham, or open-faced melted sandwiches.  I would highly recommend this bread.

I really loved this bread.  The caraway seeds make this really good.  I first put this on my dough setting of my breadmaker, let it rise after that, and then baked it in the oven.  This recipe was enough to fill two loaf pans.

This bread is simply amazing!  The first time I made this, I used molasses because we didn't have any dark corn syrup, and increased the coffee granules to 1 tablespoon (by accident) -- and it worked.  Just what real bread should taste like and I made it! Thank you Mary for submitting this awesome recipe.

This bread came out very yummy and with a moist crumb.  I don't have a bread machine - I don't think I could give up the tactile feeling of making bread by hand.  I made this using a sponge starter and so a lot of my amounts were different, but I adjusted the liquid to add the vinegar, molasses (no corn syrup), and oil.  I didn't have coffee granules or fennel, but I think next time I will play around with adding some strong coffee and definately add the fennel.  I believe that both will add another layer of flavor.  I baked round loaves at 450F with the bread on the lowest rack possible, and I also steamed the oven.  This gives it a very nice crust and helps keep the insides from drying out.  Thanks for a fun rye recipe! Cont. 2/1/09 I've made this bread a couple more times with the strong coffee and the fennel.  Both really added to the flavor of the bread.  Also, I used high gluten bread flour which really helps keep the bread from being too dense.  Now I'm going to try making it with a rye sourdough starter.  Again, thanks for a fun recipe!

This bread looks and tastes similar to black bread from motherland. It was a hit at our russian party. I change the recipe a little. I substitute oil for margarine and molasses for corn syrup and use 1 package of yeast. I also don't use bread machine. You will definately love this bread if you like rye bread!

This is the best Black Bread recipe I have ever made.  I had to cut the recipe down a bit since my "old" bread machine will only hold 2 cups of flour.  I have made this recipe several times.  It is my all time favorite.

I used the dough setting, then baked at 350 for about 30-40 minutes.  This bread has a wonderful flavor.  I will definitely bake again!

Love this bread. I use molasses instead of corn syrup. I make 2 loaves and bake it at 350'F for 35 min, as suggested by one reviewer.

Turned out great! Thank you so much for the recipe and the comments! Thanks to the comments I substituted molasses for dark corn syrup ( didn't have any syrup at home). The recipe calls for 1 1/2 cup  of water,  so i used one cup of water and half cup of coffee (thanks to the comments again), cause I didn't have any instant coffee at home.  I normally never post comments,  but had to register and leave my comment on this one! I will be making it all the time! It tastes just like the bread I remember when growing up in Ukraine.

This is the first raised bread I've made, and it was an amazing one to start on!  The flavors all work perfectly together, and it's so soft and perfect the first time around!

I tried the recipe and the list of ingredients (I adjusted the caraway seed down) and all worked well in the end.  unfortunately I had to reference other similar recipes to get the preperation and cooking instructions. So the end result was good for me but the recipe is incomplete if you prefer to work without a bread machine.

Loved this bread!  Very savory!  I did add a little more flour to the bread machine as the dough was kneaded.

I followed the directions as written, and even measured the temperature of my water, but the bread came out under-baked.  My bread machine has settings for 1.5 lb and 2 lb loaves.  I used the 2lb setting.  Maybe if I had a different kind of bread machine it would've worked better?

My family loves homemade bread and this is one of our favorites! I don't know how "authentic" it is as far as the Russian aspect goes, but this bread is delicious and works great for bread bowls filled w/ soup or chilli.

This bread recipe turned out sooo good.  I substiuted olie oil for butter, used balsamic vinegar in place of the cider vinegar, and didn't hae the instant coffee so left it out.  This bread is BETTER than store bought.  I will make it again and again! Thanks for this wonderful recipe!  Sherrie

I wish I had the option of 3.5 stars here. I made the recipe as written, except I substituted molasses for the corn syrup and omitted the optional fennel seeds. I used the bread machine for the dough, then shaped it into a loaf and baked it in the oven. The result was a beautiful, soft loaf. There was a slight sweetness to the bread that wasn't to my taste. Next time I make it I will try omitting the brown sugar. I will also halve the coffee and cut back the cocoa to 2 tablespoons, as I found the bread had a bit of a bitter edge that doesn't go well with the very soft, almost white bread texture. Other than that, it was great!

This was very easy to make with wonderful taste and texture.  It also keep fresh quite a few days. Next time I will cut back on the caraway the suggested amount is a bit much.

We enjoyed this bread very much and i will definately make it again. I don't have a bread machine so i proofed the yeast in the water (110 degree) with the brown sugar, then added the rest of the ingredients ( i added 4 teas. vital wheat gluten to aid in the rising process) and kneeded 10 minutes. Let it rise for 1 hour then punched it down and formed in a loaf pan and let it rise another hour. Baked at 350 for 30 minutes and found that it probably could have used another 5 to 10 minutes in the oven. Also, i will add a little extra brown sugar next time but thats just personal taste.

Don't know how close this is to Russian Black Bread, but it's a hefty rye that I actually like.  I made it into 4 small round loaves that I used for bread bowls, and it went well with the soup I made.  I served along with some pork loin, and it makes nice sandwich bread with the pork--flavors go well together.  I'm not a big fan of rye breads, but this one is quite good.  Even bf agreed.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful flavour and aroma. Mine was just shy of being done. I'm sure another 20 minutes would have made a difference. My breadmaker's troubleshooting said to decrease the water in the recipe by 2 tbsp. I will try that next. If that doesn't work I will make the dough in the machine and finish baking it in the oven. I couldn't see that anyone else had this problem so I can only think that it is my machine, although I have not had this happen with other bread loaves. I plan to try again tommorow. 
Thanks - This is really great tasting bread.

This was absolutely the best Black Bread recipe for the bread machine I've tried. I prepared it exactly as directed with the exception of using oil instead of margarine and using 2 tablespoons of molasses rather than dark syrup. It was yummy! I will be using this recipe from here on. Thanks for a great one!

Wow!  Fabulous.  Thanks for the tip on substituting molasses in for the dark corn syrup.  I also used oil instead of butter/margarine for a moister crumb.

this bread is the best i made this last night, i mixed everything in the bread machine but baked it in the oven. backed it at 350 for about an hour. Also i left it to rise for a little too long so i divided the dough into and i had two loves of bread. also i used one and half tbs of viniger i thought it would be too sour and it was great. very soft and very good. next time i will leave out the seed since i do not care for them. My hubby thought I bought it.

I made this in my bread machine; used half molasses and half dark syrup; otherwise everything else was as stated in the recipe.  I love rye bread; I don't think I'm crazy about the cocoa in the bread though.  I'm eating it, but I don't think I'll make it again.

This is just an excellent and easy recipe.  The bread is light, moist and seems to stay fresher much longer than many other recipes I have tried in my breadmaker.  I also used the ends (crusts) to make some truly delicious croutons to be used in soups and salads.  I made the recipe exactly as stated and was very happy with the results.  I will definitely use this one again and again.

Used 1 Tbsp vinegar instead of 2, Canola oil instead of margarine. Bread came out excellent. Saved recipe as a favorite.

This is the best black bread recipe that I have ever made.   It's great fresh,  and wonderful toasted the next day.  Just make sure you let the bread rest after you take it out of the machine.  
The gluten needs to  bind together so that it is not doughy.   Thanks

I don't drink coffee at all and hubby doesn't drink instant so I left out the coffee granules.  Other than that followed directions as stated.  I had never had Russian Black Bread before but my husband had and loved it.  Told me it was as good as any he'd had from a bakery.

This bread is FANTASTIC.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe almost to a T which was very good in the first place.  Yesterday I tried it again but made some modifications: white flour instead of bread flour; canola oil for margarine; white sugar for corn syrup; molasses for the brown sugar; no cocoa powder; no seeds of any kind.  I made this recipe WITHOUT the bread machine, letting the dough rise for about 2 hours (more than doubled) in the first rise, then shaping four loaves (I converted the recipe to 48 servings) then letting the loaves rise for an hour or two (some got to rise longer since my oven is only big enough to bake one at a time).  I got a fantastically light and fluffy bread with a great taste - definitely the BEST bread I've ever made.  It was far from being black with all my modifications but that didn't matter much.  LOVED IT!!  THANK YOU!!

This bread was excellent.  I added two tablespoons of Vital Wheat Gluten which I add to all my breads.  Rises beautifully to sandwich size loaf.  Made this with my stand mixer instead of a bread machine.

Of course, this is not exactly the same bread as the one I used eat as a child in Moscow but it is definitely VERY tasty!  I also made it without a bread machine: mixed all the ingredients with a KitchenAid, let it rise for an hour, punched it down, and let it rise for 40 more minutes.  I tried it both with and without onion powder (another reviewer's suggestion) and I prefer it without: makes it taste more 'authentic'.  Will definitely keep on making this bread - it's great for sandwiches and gifts! (I sent a loaf to my mother-in-law as a b-day present).

I always ordered Russian Black bread at a small deli, so I was thrilled when I found this recipe.  I was disappointed in the taste and appearance.  It looked more like a dark rye bread and left a sour after taste.  Will not make this again.  Will try others.

I made this bread without a bread machine.  I formed it into a large round loaf and baked it on flat pan. I substituted olive oil for the margarine.  It worked really well.  My in-laws from Moscow are visiting us now and they both loved it.

What a treat!  Dark and dense, this bread is a delight.I live in rural Taiwan and finding bread that isn't sweet is really hard.  I made this bread today and took it with me when I met with some friends.  They loved it!  Now I have to make it weekly for them.
I can't get some of the ingredients so subbed cumin seeds for the caraway, skipped the fennel and used olive oil.

I've been searching for a bread maker recipe for a pumpernickel style bread forever and all have failed until this one. It's great!!  I almost always make this instead of the complicated pumpernickel I have made by hand for years.

Great texture- not to dense.  Very flavorful.

excellent recipe!  i followed some of the reviewers comments and used molasses instead of syrup, oil instead of margarine, slightly less baking powder, and sprinkled coarse salt on top before baking. 
 this was my first attempt at using the bread machine and it was somewhat of a disaster as i accidentally selected the "rapid rise whole wheat" setting instead of the regular whole wheat setting. a quick phone call to the makers of the bread machine, and we were back on track - i had to take the dough out of the machine before baking, knead it again and then let it rise again.  i hope to make this again soon - and with the correct setting this time!

Tasty recipe.  I used a different style of baking for this as I am skeptical of my bread maker (I don't think the heating element is working to well).  I used 1 tablespoon of white distilled vinegar istead of the cider vinegar.  The white is more acidic so therefore I used less.  I also didn't add any dark corn syrup.  I was thinking of adding molasses but held out.  I also primed the yeast in warm sugar water for ten minutes.  Instead of baking it in a loaf I decided to go flat style and it turned out well.  I glazed olive oil and sea salt over the top during the last five minutes of baking (my added touch).

This bread was amazing. I made it by hand & eschewed loaf pans to just bake it on a stone. Seems like it's going to be a family favourite. Here are the by-hand mods:
- Soften the yeast in 1/2 cup of the water & a pinch of sugar for about 10 minutes
- Use just the rye flour to start
- Add remaining dry ingredients
- Add butter & wet ingredients, then mix
- Add 1c of the flour & mix
- Add yeast mixture
- Stir in remaining flour 1/2c at a time until the dough is shaggy (trust me, you'll know)
- Turn out onto a floured surface & knead for 8-10 minutes
- Rise & bake according to the editor's footnotes

I used the egg & salt topping someone else suggested, which really put it over the top.

I did change a few things in this recipe, but it was incredible! I think it would be 5 stars either way, but I used whole wheat flour instead of bread flour, swapped corn syrup for molasses, no brown sugar and used tbsp unsweetened applesauce and 1 tbsp olive oil. I didn't have caraway or add fennel, but this bread was so rich with a perfect crust, I will definitely make it again! I used the dough setting and rolled it out into a rye loaf shape to bake. I even forgot the paddle in the bread maker for the first while, and it still turned out! Thank you!

I have made other recipes for Russian Black Bread but this is the best I have ever made.  My family said it looked as if I had bought the loaf in a artisan bake shop and they gobbled it up and asked for more.  The recipe was followed exactly, mixed in bread machine, shaped and baked in oven.  The only change I made was to brush the loaf after slashing with water instead of egg white and then sprinkling kosher salt over it.  I also milled my own hard white, hard red and rye grain.  The crust was crisp and chewy just like I personally like and the aroma while baking in the oven was absolutely heavenly.  Thank you for posting this recipe.  I have another loaf in the overn as we speak.  BTW the dough is very wet and sticky but don't add extra flour, just wet and rewet your whole hands to take it out of the bread machine and again when you are shaping the loaf.  Your hands won't stick to the dough as long as they are wet and you can work with it with no trouble.  It is supposed to be a wet slack dough.  I keep a bowl of water beside me when taking out of machine and shaping on the meal dusted parchment and rewet my hands as needed, a trick I learned from a bread baker I know. Prepare to be amazed.

Bread machine not needed.take yeast1/2tsp extra with brown sugar, 110f water & prove it.then add it to the dough . Also I didn't have bread flour, used all purpose with 2tbsp wheat gluten.Combine everything in stand mixer & let rise in greased bowl until double in size. Mine rose beautifully, almost triple.Then divide dough into 2equal halves &place them in medium size loaf pan & let rise again till double (minimum 30min).mine rose very beautifully  but I don't know why it got deflated "a little" prior to baking.Baked both loaves 350f for 35min.Got little hard on top, 30 min would have been fine.Anyway its wasn't bad, but I wouldn't consider it perfect either.

I'm new to bread making but this recipe makes me feel like a baker.  It was easy to follow and spot on.  The bread is absolutely delicious.  Hardest thing was waiting to slice it.  Confession, I didn't last the hour.  Family was impressed with this.  I will definitely make again.  Thanks for the great recipe and making me feel like a rock star.

This bread is SO good!! I used the bread machine to mix it - bloomed the yeast in bottom of pan first - then made as listed except used molasses (didn't have dark corn syrup) and left out the optional fennel. When the "dough" cycle was finished, I flattened the bread & rolled into a log, cut it into 12 pieces, put them in greased muffin tins & let them rise till doubled. Baked @375* for 23 min. They are big & beautiful and the taste and texture are excellent - close grain, a little chewy, and sturdy - great for sopping up gravies or making a sandwich. I highly recommend it!

This bread turned out awesome!  I don't have a bread machine, so I followed the editor's notes with no problems!  I did not have any dark corn syrup, so I substituted 2 tbsp of light corn syrup and 1 tbsp of molasses.  I also substituted 1/4 cup of the bread flour for spent grain flour (I'm a home brewer and try not to let anything go to waste!).  This bread is great... I plan on using a loaf of it to make rueben patty melts tonight!

This is a delicious bread. More airy and soft than I expected Russian Black bread to be, but no less wonderful. I used my bread machine through the first rise, but finished traditionally. Lovely. Thank you for sharing!

Wonderful. I made as written except substituting molassas for dark corn syrup, and won't change anything in the many more times I'm sure to make this. I'm not a huge fan of vinegar but I LOVED the little bit of bite it gave the bread. Thanks so much for sharing.

I just made this tonight as a "test run" for Christmas - delicious!

I followed the recipe to a T, but only made the dough in the bread machine as I don't care for the shape it makes. 

Then I baked it the same way as Mark Bittman's "No Knead Bread" recipe - in a cast iron pot with a lid at 450 for a half hour. Then removed the lid and baked another 15. This gives it a CRISPY crust and a soft, moist middle. 

Very flavorful - I love this bread with Peanut butter for breakfast.

I'm sure it is just my personal taste, because my husband loved it, but I just don't like this. It is very heavy and has a very strong flavor.  It did rise nicely, and I too baked it in the oven.  I needed to add an extra 12 cup of flour to make a bread dough. Not sure why, but oh well.

Excellent.  I also added 2 t. onion powder per another reader's suggestion.  I didn't have the instant coffee, so I made it without it.  I think it needed it to make it a bit darker.  Tasted great.

This was my first bread trial, and I was pretty happy with it, but I'd omit the fennel next time.  There should be something else than cocoa and coffee to color the bread!

I made this into 16 rolls; baked at 400 about 15-20 min. and served with honey butter. Maybe I don't have the right taste for this because I didn't like the cocoa taste. But I did leave out the caraway and fennel because I haven't learned to enjoy those seeds, so maybe that is key. HOWEVER, the texture is WONDERFUL! And, as previous reviewers have noted, onion really makes it (I sprinkled the powder on a baked, buttered roll to find out), so I will make again, adding 2 tsp. onion powder. I also want to try it with whole wheat bread flour.

I have been buying black bread from the store for fondue, but the store i shop at only sells it sliced and I wanted bigger chunks for fondue. 

This recipe was great. I did not have dark corn syrup, so I used light. 

The caraway and fennel seed gave it a little more "zip" than the bread that I buy - but it was a good addition.

I've made this numerous times for my family, and it's one of their favourites. We had a party last weekend and wanted some breads for the table, so I made several types of bread, including this one. I was amazed to be asked by seven different people what was in this recipe, as they loved it! I can only say this is a real winner and congratulations on such a successful recipe!

After some fussing, (my machine is a little old) and kneading in some extra flour by hand, this loaf was delicious. I have been enjoying it for three days now. Thanks.

I didn't have any bread flour so I added some wheat gluten to my dough to give the bread some rise. I left out the fennel but kept the caraway in and the resulting flavor was very good. I really enjoyed this bread, and it went well with soup or just toasted with butter.

I tried this in my bread maker and found that the baking part of it doesn't work anymore.  For a long time now I've been using the dough mode and then taking it out, shaping it, and baking in a bread pan.

So I tried coverting this to a mixer method.  It didn't rise as well as I'd like.  But those who like Rye Bread liked this.  I don't like Rye at all but made it for others.  I'm giving this a 4 star rating because I'm not happy with the final product visually, but others really liked the flavor.

This bread was good, but it was very light and fluffy, and the flavor just wasn't what I was expecting.  It wasn't a bad bread, it just didn't seem like what a dark russian bread should be.

My first time making dark russian rye.  Color is lighter than what we have previosly purchased in stores but the flavor of this one was missing nothing. My husband and I loved it .Had it with cream cheese and olives. Wonderful!!! We were concerned we would find the amt. of vinegar too intense so we cut it down. Next time I will try it with the full amt. This is my 8th loaf of bread made with my bread machine. (I've owned it 3weeks) Just sooo much fun :) :)  Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe!

I have made this bread every week since I found this recipe. My husband and I are both hooked on this bread!   I have made a couple of adjustments -  I make strong coffee for part of the water. I use molasses instead of dark corn syrup, and don’t add the fennel seeds.  I put all ingredients into mixing bowl after proofing the yeast.  I use my kitchen aid stand mixer and let my dough hook do all work. In 10 to 12 minutes it is ready to rise...   Very easy and delicious!!

I made some slight changes.  First... I didn't have any Dark Corn syrup.. so I used one Tablespoon light corn syrup, and one Tablespoon molasses.  Also... I wanted more of a "rye" taste, so used 1 and 1/2 cups bread flour, and 2 cups rye flour.  Turned out great.  It will be my "go to" rye bread!

I just made this bread for the first time and I was very surprised how well it came out. I eat Russian bread every day, I like Borodinskiy and Orlovsky which I get from Russian store, and this bread has a very similar taste and texture to both of those breads. I would definitely make this one again. Like others, I added only one and a quarter teaspoon of yeast, I use 1.5lb bread machine and the dough  did not hit the lid as it was rising, I also used 2tbsp of molasses instead of corn syrup and I used whole rye flour and I did not add any seeds. Next time I will also add a bit more salt and sugar. Great bread!
Update: made the bread again and had to add another star, it came out amazing. This time added 2 tsp of yeast, like the original recipe states (still no problem with dough raising excessively) . I decreased cocoa to 1 tbsp and coffee to 1/2 tsp to decrease the bitterness. Added 2 and 1/2 tbsp molasses to add a bit more sweetness, will probably add 3 tbsp next time.

This bread is mind blowingly good and I truly can't understand why there are critical reviews at all. I did have to switch out margarine for canola oil and dark corn syrup for molasses (because that's what I had available without going back to the store).  Had a slice with butter and it just completely blew my mind, I bet it would be great with sauerkraut and cheese. I will have to test this theory when I get back from the store. Thanks for this incredibly awesome recipe, it is an instant favorite. :)

I don't know what Russian black bread should taste like, but I didn't care for the sour and strong taste of this by itself.  That being said, I used it in the Ruben Casserole and also made a bread bowl out of it for the Dilly Rye Boat Dip (both on this site) and it was good in those recipes.

Delicious bread! I love the flavor and texture. I did not have instant coffee granules, so I brewed an 8 oz cup of coffee to use in place of 1 cup of water. I also did not have dark corn syrup, but I had molasses, therefore, I made that substitution, like many other reviewers had done. I added fennel seeds even though it is optional and I am very happy that I did. I think that the seeds help give the bread more depth in flavor. I followed the instructions for making the dough on a stand mixer exactly as written, but I shaped the dough into a boule for a rustic-looking bread. I baked my bread in a pre-heated bare cast iron Dutch oven -- the resulting bread has a crispy crust, but the interior is super ultra soft, tender, pillowy and light as a cloud! I will definitely make this again! I really enjoy it very much!

I goofed and put the ingredients in the bread machine in the wrong order - so the dough was way too wet in the beginning. I added more wheat flour during the kneading cycle and saved the dough.  It turned out well and my colleagues at work devoured the bread.  **Note: I used molasses instead of corn syrup.

This was a really good bread, but I will tweak it to my tastes.  I followed one reviewers suggestion to add 2 teaspoons of onion powder; if I add it at all it will be 1 teaspoon, but the bread probably doesn't need it.  I also followed the suggestion to use molasses instead of dark corn syrup, which I liked.  Next time I plan on using a full envelope (1 tablespoon) of yeast instead of 2 teaspoons as the bread was a little dense for me.  I may also increase the caraway and fennel seeds.  The fennel gave a pleasant and surprising pop of flavor every now and then. I used all purpose flour instead of bread flour.  It's a good bread and worth making.  I don't have a bread machine, so I kneaded the bread for around 15 minutes, then let it rise for an hour.  I shaped it into a loaf, slashed the top and let it rise for around 30 minutes then cooked it at 350 for 35 minutes.  I think I will try 375 next time for a slightly crunchier crust.

I left out brown sugar and coffee(as I dont use) and it was still too sweet until I added butter. Otherwise, it was a good loaf, but I think I will stick to my other recipe

The water maybe too much, my loaf collapsed. Is it for 1 1/2 lb setting in the bread machine?

First rye bread that actually came out fluffy, not dense! Dough is really sticky do not be alarmed, kneed in mixer with dough hook. I used 2 tsp. salt, 2 and 1/4 tbsp caraway. I used some homemade citrus vinegar because I was out of apple cider vinegar and it was just fine.  I also added 3 tsp vital wheat gluten because I have such a hard time with rye. And as always I used butter not margarine. This made 2 small loaves. But they are fluffy and gorgeous tasting.

I made this for my pregnant Ukrainian wife and she said it was exactly like what she grew up eating back in Kiev.  If that is not a ringing endorsement then nothing is!

It was extremely easy to make and came out moister than most Russian breads, but that is probably because it is fresh and not sitting in the store for a whole day before it is purchased.

A hit at this house. Great flavor with the Caraway seeds. A stand-by recipe here. Great as a side for any meal and using it sliced with a dip on a vegetable tray.

I just made 2 loaves of this bread today.  My only substitution was 2 T molasses instead of 2 T corn syrup.  I did not use a bread machine.  I let the dough rise in a covered greased  bowl for about 90 minutes until doubled.  I then formed a loaf and let the dough rise freeform on a parchment covered cookie sheet for another 60 minutes.  I baked the bread at 350 degrees for 40 minutes on the same parchment covered cookie sheet.  The bread was perfect and tasted great.

I like it a lot good flavor and the texture and softness is perfect. I used honey and Blackstrap molasses instead of dark corn syrup and dusted with rye flour while kneading as needed for moisture corrections.

I made this bread by hand, as I have neither bread machine nor stand mixer, and it turned out great. 


I didn't have any caraway seeds and I don't like fennel, but did add in flaked, dried onion, which was tasty, though felt it could have done with more salt. My husband's response was "meh, it's bread" and shrugged when eating it, and would have preferred it sweeter; I found it to be nicely bitter with a backbite (which I like), dense, and flavoured gently with undertones from the molasses. It's very nice for tea time, served warm with butter and a little blackberry or Polish sour cherry jam. 


For those who want to make it by hand:
- combine yeast and water (should be about 43-48C / 110-120F) and let sit for ten minutes
- sift together dry ingredients
- add in molasses (if using rather than corn syrup), vinegar, and yeast mix, then stir with wooden spoon
- add in the butter.


This should combine to make a very sticky dough. Turn out onto floured surface and knead for ten to fifteen minutes. I ended up adding maybe another cup of flour or more over the course of the kneading process.


Preheat your oven for one minute at 200C / 400F, then turn off. Put the dough in a greased bowl, cover with slightly dampened tea towel and leave to proof in the oven for an hour.


Punch down, knead for a few minutes on floured board. If making one large loaf, flour pan, liberally flour loaf top (so wrap doesn't stick), cover with plastic wrap, and leave to proof for 45 minutes in warm oven

I love this bread!!!!   I substituted molasses for dark corn syrup.  We added more rye flour as the dough was kneaded, so we probably used closer to two cups of rye flour.   We substituted whole wheat flour.   We let the first rise occur overnight.   We made two loaves.  The bread had a wonderful crust, and it had a wonderfully authentic rye taste and dense texture.   I will make it this way again.

Made a loaf last night in the bread maker and let it sit overnight before I cut it, found with other things I've made that bread needs to sit for a few hours before it's at it best.  It's awesome, one of the best breads I've ever had, can't wait to make Kvas with it.

Excellent. Moist, soft, and full of flavor.  I read several reviews and kept them in mind as I made my bread. I substituted bacon fat for margarine, cane syrup for corn syrup, and used Hershey's Special dark cocoa powder. I used the dough cycle on my bread machine, then kneaded it, formed one large loaf, let rise, cut vents, brushed with egg whites, and sprinkled with sea salt. I baked for 30 minutes at 400 with several other things in the oven.  The loaf was huge! Next time I will either halve the recipe or make two smaller loaves.

I used bread machine, whole wheat, 2 lb section, followed other review with only 1 1/4 tsp fast rising yeast, omit instant coffee as I don't have it, but will add in next time to try. I used delay so the bread is ready next morning, it came out perfect, crusty outside while very soft inside, goes great with coffee.

Best dark bread I've ever made!  Crumb was light and fluffy and the crust just ever slightly so chewy.  Perfect balance of sweetness and rye.   I used double the caraway at my family's insistence.   Working on my second batch today, as we speak.   Lots of requests for this one.   Thanks,  Mary.

I had a bit of trouble with this bread, unfortunately. The flavor was satisfactory, but my bread took much longer than one hour to rise and burnt (on the bottom) at the oven temperature given in the instructions while the interior of the bread remained raw. I made the recipe twice (using the traditional method without a bread machine) and had the same problem both times. To be fair, I made free-form round loaves cooked on a sheet pan with parchment rather than using conventional loaf pans. Just the same, I would plan on allowing two or three hours for the initial rise and perhaps lowering the baking temperature a bit (at least for part of the baking period).

The consistency of the bread was good, but none of us liked the taste.  I suspect it was the caraway.  The taste was very strong.  We each took a few bites, and that was it.  Perhaps we'd like this bread if the caraway was omitted, but I'm not sure if I'm going to try this one again . . . sorry.

Lovely bread. Dark and flavousome with a little 'tang' from the vinegar and seeds. The texture was light yet chewy. Perfect with a wholesome soup to provide a complete meal. Will definitely be making this many times in the future. Thanks for posting.

Just made this bread for the first time and I am enthralled by it. The best dark, maybe best ever, bread I have ever made.  The crust is perfectly crusty, crunchy and the crumb is beautiful and delicious.  Good just to eat by itself.  I could eat this without butter which is saying a lot for me.  But, wonderful with any accompaniment including, as someone else mentioned, cheeses. I only substituted melted butter for the margarine.  Used the dark corn syrup...did not substitute molasses as some have mentioned, because I don't like the strong flavor it imparts.  I fully intend to make a lot more of this recipe.

I made this today and it is so good.  I cut the vinegar (used malt vinegar) back to 1 Tbsp. and used half molassas and half dk corn syrup.  The only thing I'll do next time is increase the salt by 1/2 tsp and toast the caraway and fennel a little before adding it to release more of the flavor.  Love the chewy crust and the moist, soft crumb.  Will definately make this again.

Oh wow, this was good!  I joined just to comment on it :)  Normally I hate when people change recipes on here and then review them based on their changes (it alters the original recipe!) but I am doing it too:  used whole wheat bread flour instead of regular, subbed molasses for corn oil, didn't have unsweetened cocoa powder so used 3 tbsp chocolate protein powder and left out the brown sugar, and didn't add in the optional fennel, but will next time; put it in the breadmaker on the "dough" setting and baked it in the oven at 350 for 35 minutes.  I kept the amount of yeast at 2 tsp and didn't have problems with it rising too rapidly like some other reviewers.  It was tangy, with a crisp crust and a soft inside-- a keeper for sure!

I am sooooo in love with this recipe.  It is fantastic.  Just the type of hearty bread recipe I needed for my breadmaker.

This one underwhelmed me.  The bread did not taste pleasant at all when eaten plain or with butter only.  HOWEVER - when eaten with highly spiced homemade corned beef, the bread added to the flavor of the meat and was a good combination.  The corned beef had a strong brown sugar and mustard glaze, and I think that enhanced the otherwise bitter flavor of the bread and vice versa.

Excellent recipe! I added about a cup more rye flour and AP flour because the dough seemed a bit wet. Great flavour and texture.

I made this to serve to our missions team.  This past summer we spent 10 days on a missions trip in Ukraine.  Three of the members of our team lived in Ukraine for several years.  They said this was very similar to the bread they bought from the bakery there and that it was probably the best black bread they had ever eaten.  It was a great success! I made it just like the recipe except I substituted olive oil for the margarine.

I made this for my sister who loves black bread and she just loved it. Thank you for an excellent black bread recipe. I followed the advice of another and used onion salt and mixed by hand instead of a bread machine and it still turned out really good.

This is a great recipe.  I've made it several times.  I mix in the bread machine and bake in bread pans in the oven.  The texture is good even after its been frozen.  A favorite at our house.
