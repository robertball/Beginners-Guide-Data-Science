This is really good, I have picky eaters in my house and they all love this, even without the cheese sauce. We dip ours in mustard, so good.

We made this during a snow storm.  looking for recipes by ingredients.  There were no leftovers.  This came out great and is a very customizable dish.  Old Bay, mushroom, onions, and other flavors are easily added.  I would suggest finding a different cheese sauce or making it a day ahead.  It was very runny for the dish, but the remaining sauce was great on chili and made quick au gratin out of leftover home fries.

For simplicity sake, I substituted a Pillsbury crescent roll and just sprinkled grated Monterey Jack on the top after cooking. I used half the egg as a wash before cooking to achieve a golden brown color.  I didn't try to form a ring as it works well as a loaf. I surrounded it on a platter with lettuce, grape tomatoes, apple and cucumber slices. Lunch guests were happy.

This is also good just using the sheets of pillsbury crescent rolls if you don't want to get messy with the dough. My husband and son loved it!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was a big hit! My daughter and 2 granddaughters couldn't eat it fast enough. I'm bad about following recipes, but the only changes I made were to add some broccoli and mushrooms to the filling, and used crescent roll dough instead of baking mix. It was awesome, and we will definitely be making it again.

Found this to be very tasty but also had trouble rolling out the dough large enough to form a roll.  Mine ended up to be a 1/2 roll.  Will try the Pillsbury crescent roll which should work good.  I also found the cheese sauce too runny and not very "cheesy". It ended up more of a brown sauce.  I do believe you need the sauce as it probably would be dry without it.

The kids liked it. I made some alterations based on reviews I read. I used onion powder instead of chopped fresh onion, and I didn't make the cheese sauce. Instead I served it with mustard. I did feel like it was a bit on the dry side (the cheese sauce would probably help that). Next time I make it I am going to increase the cheese hoping to make it less dry.

My husband liked this a lot more than i did so i'm giving it  4 stars.  I think I was expecting it to be crunchier.  It was more like a soft biscuit.  Maybe it just needed to be baked a little longer but mine looked exactly like the picture. 
I think 6 servings would be a stretch.

This was good, but I had trouble getting my dough to roll out big enough.  Next time I will add another cup of biscuit mix and some water as I had barely enough to form this into a ring.  The crescent roll dough sounds like an option but increases the cost.  My husband doesn't like onion pieces so I used onion powder, some roasted garlic and chopped mushrooms.  The filling was much more moist that expected.  Although my ring was much smaller than appears in the photo, it was flavorful and my husband said the recipe is a keeper.
