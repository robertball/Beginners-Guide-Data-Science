This is a nice vegetarian entree that's simple to make. It's slightly bland on its own, but pairing it with the marina sauce does the trick. Next time I think I'll add some diced tomatoes and possibly sub the spinach for chopped broccoli florets.

This is actually a really great recipe, especially since it kind of acts as a base and it lets you add what you want. Instead of using fresh onion and garlic I used powders, canned spinach (1 can, it tastes great and didn't make a difference), and I used 1 egg instead of 2. I didn't have any squash so I used the No Roll Pie Crust from this site that I love and made 2 huge spinach pies. It tastes delicious and I don't find it bland at all. If you want to spice it up some just add some cayenne pepper and chicken chunks or something. Terrific recipe!

Made as directed and this was a bit on the bland side.  Without the marinara I don't think it would be nearly as good, but if tweaked this could be a great recipe.

NOT bland.  Add a little more italian seasoning; can also substitute 1 cup plain greek yogurt for half of the ricotta, which adds a little flavor.  Main variation: pour  the sauce (I used 1 jar Classico florentine/cheese) into the bottom of the dish, then place the squash on top, sprinkle with parmesan, cook, with final 5-10 mins  high broil to brown cheese.

Good way to use up a bunch of extra summer squash that is so plentiful right now... but something was missing with this recipe, I just didn't find it satisfying.  Maybe next time I'll try cooking some of the sauce over the stuffed squash, add some cubed cream cheese to the filling and possibly some ground meat or sausage; not sure.
