I did not care for this recipe. Mabe if you add pinch of salt it's better.

I used toasted whole grain bread - I don't suggest toasting the bread all the way, maybe use day old bread, sliced a bit thicker than regular sandwich bread.  The first piece I didn't soak long enough and the cornflakes didn't want to stick.  The next piece I soaked longer but that used up too much egg mixture and I didn't have enough to do 4 pieces of toast.  The recipe doesn't say to use spray or to butter the baking dish - I used a sheet pan lined with parchment and sprayed the parchment with cooking spray.  Unfortunately, between toasting the bread, baking and lack of oil or butter these were just too dry for us.  This could be a tasty breakfast with a few modifications.

I apologize in advance, but I'm not going to rate this recipe (since I haven't made it yet), but instead make a note:  A local restaurant near our house makes Cap'n Crunch french toast...and it is AMAZING!  I'll try this recipe using crushed Cap'n Crunch cereal but will pan fry it instead.  Based on the taste and crispiness of the one I ate, I could tell it was fried.  Okay not healthy, but Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm....
