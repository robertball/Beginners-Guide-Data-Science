I used whole kernel sweet corn instead of cream style corn. And instead of water, I used the water that I drained from the can of corn. This came out delicious!!

The flavors on this are quite good together. I used a lil extra of onion and garlic, and the only extra spice I added was paprika. Overall it was really flavorful! My only complaint was that the chops were dry. Not sure if this was due to a long cook time or what. Either way, a recipe worth trying!! Try with rice and/or green beans!

I had no idea creamed corn would make such a nice gravy for the pork! left out the water and onions and we got a nice brownish sauce the consistency of gravy with little bits of corn in it, haha, very very easy supper. we had it with mashed potatoes, salad, and the other half of the can of corn (we only did 2 servings instead of 4) on the side. really nice! I'd make this again.

This was very good the pork chops was so tender. I put it in top of some smashed potatoes and pour gravy on top of it. It was a very good menu and my guest enjoyed it.

I made this last night and it was incredible. Not so much that it was really great tasting (which it was) but it was different and that made it even better.

I thought this was just ok.  I was really excited to try it because I love creamed corn, however, once in the oven the corn turned incredibly soupy (yes, much soupier than it's usual consistency) and I was disappointed that it was so thin.    Husband thought it was just ok as well.

This was great! I did not have garlic, and instead of minced onion,  I sliced a small onion and carmelized it and  then added McCormick Grill Mates steak seasoning to the chops. Excellent! Next time I will try to have garlic on hand. Oh, no need to add water.
