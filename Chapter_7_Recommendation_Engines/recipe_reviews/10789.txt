These are the only sugar cookies I make!  I use one cup confectioner's sugar and one cup granulated, though, and I also prefer using orange or lemon extract as the vanilla is a bit plain.   I also only use 1/4 tsp salt.  Be careful not to overbake - I like them when the bottoms are only slightly golden - tops should look white.

I was sitting here watching CNN waiting for the Obama/McCain debate when into my mind, sugar cookies appeared. I got on my computer to find a "recipe, brown edge sugar cookies" thinking it would turn up nothing since the subject was too long and that I would probably end up on a porn site. I could not have been more wrong but to find this Heavenly recipe for the best sugar cookies I ever made. I checked the larder and found:  No butter!  Since my wife is at work, my son is at the "Y" and I being legally blind, (unable to drive) I sought out a substitute. Aha! One stick of margarine and the scrapings in an old can of Crisco.  I quickly combined the ingredients thinking that even though they would not exactly be up to snuff, I would eat anything with flour and sugar.  I went back to the television to await the cooling period.  Exactly 1/2 hour later, I pulled the dough from the fridge and started the ball rolling so to speak. Oh my! To my dismay, the dough was so soft, but I continued on anyway. 10 minutes later, I checked the oven to see to my surprise, 6 inch sugar cookies with perfect brown edges. I let them cool for a few minutes then let them set on brown paper. The only problem was 12 cookies on that sheet was too many and the edges were imperfect.  So, what is any good baker to do?  Yup, I ate the first dozen and they were heavenly. When I finish, I will take a picture of them and post it here. I can't wait to get some butter.

Awesome cookie, I used a cookie press the first time and it worked out great. The second time I used a scoop and again they were just as wonderful.

Delicious!!  These were exactly what I was looking for!  My first batch I baked for 8 minutes and they came out very soft.  My next batches I baked for about 11 minutes because I wanted a sturdier cookie so I could frost them.  These are delicious and easy.

Tasty and pretty. 

Only caveat is be aware these are not suitable for sugar cookie cut outs, even after chilling. They spread like crazy

I have been searching for the perfect sugar cookie recipe and I found it!  The only thing is that you have to leave the dough in the frig for 2 hours.  I added food coloring to sugar and made different pastel colors for easter and sprinkled a different color on every cookie.  Thanks for the great recipe!

These turned out perfect. I followed the recipe almost to a tee. The only thing I changed was I added a 1/2 tsp of almond extract for extra flavor!

This is the best recipe for cookies ever. And, I made them vegan using egg replacer, soy-milk and a fake-butter! They are perfect and taste delicious. Ice them with your favorite vegan frosting and they are the best. I baked them for 10 minutes, they will be very soft when they first come out of the oven but just wait a few minutes o move them.

I chose this recipe because of the high ratings by others, but my experience was not so good. Although the end result was very tasty, the dough was EXTREMELY difficult to work with. First, 20 minutes of chilling did nothing for it - I had to wait several hours before it was at a workable state. Even then, and taking only small bits at a time, the dough was still so soft and sticky that rolling was exasperating and very difficult. Once finally rolled, and cut, it was so soft that I could not get a single cookie up and onto the cookie sheet without being squished into a little ball.  The addition of more flour did not help, and I didn't want to continue to add more for fear of a tough end result.  I did two completely separate batches with the same exact results, so it wasn't just a fluke. Bottom line - tastes great, but way too hard to work with. I'll keep looking for the perfect sugar cookie recipe.

Ok, this is I think my 1st review, and I must say this is simply an outstanding cookie. I took a snowflake cookie cutter and made snowflake cookies as an experimental project for a wedding coming up in Jan. The 1st batch I made, I received awesome reviews on the taste of this cookie. I took the advice of others and used only 1/2 cup of oil.  I am glad I made this cookie and so will the Bride. :)

When I was a kid my mother made these cookies for every occasion.  She decorated them with decorator frosting.  The cream of tartat makes all the difference.  Thanks!

I've tried many sugar cookie recipes in the past, but this one is the best. The finished cookies are delicate and crispy and delicious. I used about 2/3rds of a cup of oil instead of a full cup, since the dough seemed the right consistency, and had to cook them for 12-13 minutes a batch, but they are wonderful. Thank you.

Finaly my search is over! These are the best sugar cookies that I have ever made. I did cut the oil by half as suggested by a friend. These are delicate, buttery perfection. Thanks Janet! This is the only sugar cookie recipe I will ever use.

WOW! that's all i have to say. These are so delicious and so easy. The cookies are also not very time consuming which is a BIG +!! I substituted the 1c veg oil for 1c EVOO (i do that whenever a recipe calls for veg oil)and instead of 1t vanilla I did 1/2t almond and 1/2t vanilla. Straight out of the oven they were a tiny bit greasy but, I placed on paper towels to cool after the first batch and that seemed to cut down on the greasiness; still yummy though! I absolutely love how they melt in your mouth! Will definitely make again!!

I have to say,   hands down,   this is the best recipe for making cutout cookies.  Easy to work with,  doesn't stick,  and tastes wonderful!  (Thinking the oil in it helps it not stick.)   I can't believe I almost didn't try this recipes because of the oil.   I have used this recipe time and time again.  I even used the recipe for the cookies in jars as my wedding favors.

i made these with vegan replacements, and they were pretty good. i didn't use cream of tartar and have no idea what that would have added. i mean, shocker, they were tasty because there's a friggin' CUP of butter. but they were really thin and i sort of prefer a thicker, chewier cookie... i didn't have to chill my dough at all, and i used raw cane sugar instead of white which i think made them tastier. anyway overall pretty good.

This was pretty good.....The flavor is a little dull, and thats after i doubled the vanilla mind you. You really do have to add all the oil, i have no idea why people are saying that u should decrease it! This recipe was just a tad of a letdown....I MAY try it again, but if I did I would top it with frosting or add almond extract to the batter....so in actuality i would give it a 3.5-4 Stars

I've made these already twice. They are not great for cut outs as they spread during baking but they taste too good for that to matter.

It was tasty. But when I made them they turned out as flat as a pancake and they expanded all over the entire pan. It was a disaster.

The best sugar cookie I've ever had! Very soft and delicious. I used 1/2 cup of vegetable oil instead of a whole cup, and they came out perfectly.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I used it to make snickerdoodles and baked a few without rolling them in cinnamon/sugar and they're the best sugar cookie I've ever had (well, to this point in my life). It makes a lot, but that's okay, because I'm taking these to work to share with everyone...if they last that long!

Awesome cookies. I made these for a children's party and they were gone in the first 20 minutes. Good for both children and adults!

Excellent cookie. Light, crisp, and delicately sweet. I followed one of the reviewers suggestions and used about 1/4 cup less vegetable oil. The dough is a little sticky -- not a problem for adults, but maybe problematic for children. Thank you. This is the perfect cookie for me.

These cookies were very good and easy to make.  I wanted a cut-out cookie,  but these were too soft for that, but they were still delcious.

This recipe makes an incredible sugar cookie. I made them for Christmas, used green and red colored sugar and shaped them into christmas trees and ornaments. My neighbors loved them. My family loved them too.

Great sugar cookies! I substituted vegetable oil with olive because I had no other oil, but it just gives the cookie a little olive oil flavor and is probably a little better for you! I love the Hello Kitty’s! This recipe is great for a Christmas cookies and next time I’ll try it with the vegitable oil.

Very tasty, but certainly not a cut out cookie. I followed the directions exactly- and although they're good drop cookies I was looking for a cookie to cut with the fam as we get snowed in. Disappointing but hey, a cookie is a cookie!

Not going to try this one again.  I added another cup of flour and at least then the "dough"  (batter, really) didn't run off the cookie sheet!  WAAAAy to much oil!

I rolled them into about the size of a ping pong ball then pressed them with a fork both ways! They were Delicious! Also Icing and sprinkles are a must!

These are fabulous!  My husband just asked me to make sugar cookies.  Well, the last time I tried they didn't turn out very well, so I was a bit hesitant.  I decided to look online for a recipe, and this one appealed to me the most.  I'm glad I found this recipe!  These were wonderful - soft and yummy.  Easy to make too!  Thank you!

these were delicious.  i used to make cut-out frosted Christmas cookies.  they turned out very buttery, a nice mix of salty-sweet and were perfectly complemented by the land o' lakes buttercream frosting a previous reviewer recommended.  my only issue was that for some reason my dough was a bit sticky so i added a whole cup of flour, which didn't alter the recipe too much.  i suggest keeping the dough in the fridge that you aren't using until you roll it out so it's easier to roll.  yum!
