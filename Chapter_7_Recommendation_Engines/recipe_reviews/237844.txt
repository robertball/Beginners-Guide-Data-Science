Very good! I really liked that it used the ingredients I almost always have on hand. I also cut the recipe in half for 2 flat iron steaks (I guess about 2 pounds). I followed the advice of the other reviewer and added some pepper flakes, which was a really nice addition. I would make this again, for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

we enjoyed the flavor profile of this recipe.. i cut this recipe in half (thinking the full amount might be too salty) and used this on a little under 3 lbs of thick sirloin pork chops.. i marinated for about 6-7 hours but think it would have been better for much longer.. or maybe on a thinner cut of meat.. bf said this would probably be good on skirt steak.. our only suggestion would be to add some heat on the end.. be it red pepper flakes, cayenne, or some plain black pepper.. this is definitely a do over.. ty for the recipe

Cooked as follows: Pour the marinade over the beef tips and toss to coat. Marinate in the refrigerator for at least an hour or up to 3 hours, but no longer than 3 hours total.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.

Line a baking sheet with foil then place a rack on top. Spray the rack with cooking spray.

Drain the marinade from the beef tips then add the beef tips to the baking rack, leaving some space in between so they roast evenly.

Roast for 15 minutes, then place under the broiler for 3-4 minutes to crisp up the edges.

Remove the beef to a serving bowl then pour any juices from the bottom of the baking sheet over the beef tips.
