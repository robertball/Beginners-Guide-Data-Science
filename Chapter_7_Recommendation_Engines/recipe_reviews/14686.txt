WOW what a dissapointment!  I'm not sure how the positive reviewers got this one to turn out.  First, the soup mixture is very thick to pour over 2lbs of beef roast!  Where is the water or liquid ingrediant?  I mean, after cooking it for 4 hours with no water? How can the meat stay tender?  Not wanting to alter the recipe too much, I even added a 1/2 cup of water to the soup mix.  Not even 2 hours later, I checked it and the soup/gravy mixture had cooked away!  The meat was burned and there was no way I could ever think about adding noodles.  Maybe the cooking temp is too high or too long(i cooked it as directed)?  We ended up throwing the burnt meat (and what was left of the "gravy"...most of it had crusted to the baking dish) and cooking a pizza instead.  I would not recommend nor will I make again.

This dish is absolutely delicious and so easy! The important thing is to keep the dish VERY tightly sealed when cooking.  It will cook nicely in its own juices.  Pick a meat with a moderate amount of fat. Cook for less time if reducing the recipe.  It really is wonderful, and I am picky..........EDIT....... BAH! DRAT!  I made this dish at a friend's house and it started burning at 3 hours ( I smelled it)... I realize now that the secret to my success was the SHALLOW PAN I was cooking in.. A 5x5x2 glass dish, tightly sealed with foil.  I tried a deep dutch oven and it DID NOT WORK.   I hope this helps you. xxx

Great to make for company!  I substituted "herb & garlic" soup mix and added baby carrots.  Also used pearl onions.  Yum!

I made a few changes to mine and it was awesome! 2 lbs. beef steak cut in cubes 1 tsp Italian seasoning 2 cubes beef bullion 1 medium onion  1 family size can cream of mushroom soup Put in a slow cooker until the meat is very tender.I added 8ozs of fresh mushrooms cut in large chunks about an hour before it was close to being done. Then 1 cup of burgundy wine about the last 1/2 hour before it's done. I used a homemade egg noodle which I put in at the sametime as the wine. It was fantastic. I love cooking with wine and the slowcooker!

This is very good for how easy it is -- to avoid the bad experiences of others cover TIGHTLY. I've done this in a deep baking dish sealed with tinfoil, and I've actually had to remove the tinfoil towards the end to get it to reduce, certainly never too dry. We also  increase the wine a bit.

I don't know if I did something wrong or what but my meat came out very dry and I didn't even cook it for th full time.  I think I'd probably get better results by doing this in the slowcooker.

Changed my recipe up some but still used the base of this recipe. cut meat lbs down. Kept roast whole for time reasons. Left lemon flovar out. Uped temp to 350 put in a 1.5 inch flat bottom casserole dish with foil top. Added water in middle of time. Removed meat added the cooked noodles to casserole dish and stir then cut meat and placed on top for presentation. Came out quick and worth while

a few changes....do NOT drain mushrooms and put mixture over the noodles rather then mixing them in.  Can also use onion soup mix if you do not have soup mix mentioned.  I use this recipe per 1 1/2 lb meat and cook in roasting pan for 2 hrs. or more at 275 degrees -- check at that time and if you find it too thick add a little water or more wine.  If you don't want to use wine use apple juice.  sorry - couldn't get custom version area to work.  This is a winner.

First off, after reading all the negative reviews about making it in  the oven, I decided to make it in the slow cooker(low for 8 hours added wine and mushroom on the 6th hour). Make sure to choose a lean cut of beef or the fat from the beef will drown out the flavor. Also make sure to remove the cover for the last 30 minutes of cooking & stir a bit so the alcohol vapor can leave the slow-cooker. Very delicious if made correctly though.

Very tasty and worth making. I don't use canned soup so I made my own mushroom soup and used fresh mushrooms. I browned my meat in a skillet with the onion and mushrooms and then deglazed the pan with the cup of beef bullion after that I followed the recipe as written. Next time I will cut the cook time to 2 hours other then that I won't change a thing.

I read through the reviews and covered the pan tightly. I didn't know what "lemon herb soup mix" was... It very vague so I looked it up and improvised. 
I cut down the time to 2 hours. My result: Everything was very rich, tender, saucy, and moist. Such a very very good recipe.
