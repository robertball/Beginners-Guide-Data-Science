I made just half the recipe and used powdered vanilla since I didn t have liquid. I soaked the cashews in the water for 30 minutes and blended 2 min in intervals using a bullet type blender. I had very little pulp after. The crescent milk is delicious and made great coffee creamer substitute.

Delicious drink either hot or cold. I was uneasy following these instructions. It doesn't require soaking the cashews and I didn't like the idea of straining the pulp after having added the vanilla and agave twice to boot. But I did follow the method and am happy with the results. I allowed the cashews water vanilla and agave to set for about an hour though. I used a vanilla bean (scraped) instead of extract. All-in-all this is a great drink and pretty accurate method. And the pulp made some fine cookies to go along with the milk.:-)
