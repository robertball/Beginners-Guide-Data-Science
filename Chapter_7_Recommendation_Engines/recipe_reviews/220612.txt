I served this over toast with a fried egg on top, like the recipe suggests, and it was DELICIOUS!  And easy to make!  I used skim milk, as it was all I had, and it didn't seem to make a difference. This is definitely a keeper!

Lord have mercy! This is GOOD! I made it exactly like the recipe except I made twice the amount and used a mixture of pinto beans, navy beans and black beans. I tasted it to make sure its actually good, and finally stopped myself after the fifth big bite. This is comfort food and so tasty! We shall have it over hot biscuits.

Well Ive never heard of rarebit and thought it sounded interesting so gave it a try and glad I did! This dish was so easy and quick to make and tasted great. I had it with and without the toast and it was delicious! Almost exactly like my moms home made mac and cheese sauce but with beans added to it. Definitely keeping this one

I have made this several times.  I love it, but it is definitely a folksy comfort dish, and so quick and easy to make.  I gave it 4 stars because my teenagers will not even try it.  Their loss - more for me.

This recipe was introduced to me by a friend and I fell in love right away. I like how easy it is to make and that it stretches easily to feed extra people. The leftovers also freeze really well.

You know what, it's really good! I love that it is so simple, inexpensive, and delicious. Also a great idea for an easy meatless meal when you're wanting something along those lines. As already pointed out, it goes great on toast.  
I used just a little over 1 cup of cheese because it was all I had and I was not about to go to the store just to get another bag of cheese. My love of cheese is great, but my laziness is sometimes even greater. It still tasted wonderful. 
(Looks really appetizing with a bit of dill and paprika sprinkled on top- thanks to the poster of that photo for the idea!)

Warm and rich.  The fried egg on top is a nice touch.  Not something you want to eat if you are trying to lose weight...but I'm not, so I had seconds!

As others have said, this is easy, tasty comfort food. Made exactly as described. When I have my next helping, I think I'll add a sprinkle of paprika on top.

I LICKED THE PLATE CLEAN. That's all I have to say. This recipe is flexible for what you have on hand, though I did try to stay close to the original. I used honey mustard because I didn't have dijon, and I doubled the white beans for extra protein and fiber, and reduced fat cheese (on a diet in which I an eat whatever I want that fits the food budget!). The flavor is fantastic, it only took about 15 min to make, and it's cheap. What more could you want? I may add a few additional seasonings to tailor for my own taste (garlic, maybe cayenne...), but even the base recipe is phenomenal. Thanks to you and your mother for this winner!

I really enjoyed this. I had to try it because it reminded me of a similar dish my mom used to make (well, it seemed similar to me). I grew up overseas, and our diet was pretty limited to our garden, what produce came down the trail on it's way to market, and a limited array of canned-type foods we ordered in from the "big city" once or twice a year. Among these "special" treats were canned, yes, canned hot dogs. Sort of Vienna sausage-esque, but bigger. Although I shudder to think of eating it now, hot dog gravy on toast was the pinnacle of childhood comfort food. Only difference was no cheese. There WAS no cheese out there! I'm happy to admit that this far surpassed hot dog gravy, and the fried egg on top really nailed it to the door. Thanks for this fun (but better!) throwback to my rural upbringing!

Boy, does this bring back memories.  It has been eons since Iâ€™ve heard the word rarebit.  I used my Panini press to toast a baguette I had sliced lengthwise, and then added sliced tomatoes to the toasted bread, and gently grilled.  I topped it with the cheese mixture which had the added bonus of the white beans.   What a fabulous meatless meal. Thanks for sharing.

This is pretty much your basic white sauce as a base & I had to make a few changes like onion flakes instead of onion, mild cheddar cheese,  horseradish mustard & after I plated it up over toast I cut up a boiled egg rather than fry one because I already had them. I also mixed in a can of white beans that were mixed with veggies.  Then I put it over toast.  It was really good, but next time I want to have the correct ingredients so I can make it like it's written.

I've made this several times and love it! I originally followed it exactly but now have a modified version I follow where I halve all the ingredients except for the beans and mustard. I also often add whatever greens I have on hand. It makes a ton but freezes well.

I didn't like the cheese factor. Wondering if it would be good with white sausage gravy instead.

Loved this! It's even better than traditional Welsh rarebit. Not overly cheesy, nice and subtle.

I lightened it up (a little) with almond milk, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. To the author's comments, yes, this is comfort food.

I was very excited about this dish as it combines two of my favourite things: beans and cheese. I was willing to take the calorie hit because I thought it was going to absolutely delicious, but I actually found it pretty bland.

So quick, easy, & delicious! I had a package of mixed beans that I used, but white beans would work just as well. I'll be saving this recipe for years to come! I made a large batch &  added the leftovers to a  pot of  white chili that was being made-great addition! It thickens up very quickly, so watch it & stir frequently!
