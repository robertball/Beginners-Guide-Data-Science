We used ground beef sirlion, beef broth instead of water, a pinch of salt, Lawry's seasoning salt, Accent seasoning, onions, sesame oil, and added a combination of red and yellow bell peppers. Along with Minute Rice cooked in the remaining beef broth, this meal took at least 10 minutes instead of the five minutes suggested, but a quick meal regardless and very tasty! My hubby said it tasted like a lettuce wrap from PF Chang's ^_^

Looking for a quick meal?  This one is fabulous.  I recommend, however, cutting the cabbage very thin with a mandolin and using a larger portion of the vegetables.

This was really great and fast.  I used green bell peppers.  Everyone liked it.  The only thing that I did different was that I doubled the recipe and I didn't add as much soy sauce as stated.  After it was cooked we added more soy sauce to everyones individual taste.  Veg's were still crisp as well.  Note:  Don't leave a lid on it if you want the veg's crisp.  They will sog up.

Wow!!  SOOO good.  I doubled the recipe, and only used one red pepper (actually, it was an orange pepper), and replaced the other pepper with an onion, which I cooked with the garlic and hamburger.  Per other reviewers’ suggestions, I used a generous amount of salt (thoroughly ground into the thoroughly-ground-up hamburger meat, of course).  My only beef (pun intended) with the recipe is that the purported total cooking and prep time is fifteen minutes (LOL)!!  It’s more like an HOUR and fifteen minutes!!  This goes very well with this sesame green beans recipe (http://sidedish.allrecipes.com/az/SsmGrnBns.asp).

This was just OK. Personally I didn't like the taste of ground beef in a stir fry. Would prefer to make this with strips of beef.

This was so wonderful! We couldn't stop eating it. I used ground round, so I didn't have to drain any grease off. I added a cube of beef bouillon, 1/2 tsp or so of onion powder, and substituted hot oil, otherwise followed as directed. Served this with Puerto Rican steamed rice. This is so delicious and so economical too! Thank you Pearlie for posting this.

Excellent!  I really enjoyed this.  I adjusted the recipe for what I had on hand and double it with the exception of the bell pepper.  I used ground turkey and added a beef bullion cube and 2 tbsp of worcestershire sauce to the meat mixture to give it more of a beef flavor.  I also added some diced onion, sauted them with the bell pepper and served it over Jasmine rice.  Yummy! This recipe was so fast and easy... great for week nights.    Thanks for the recipe.

I wasn't sure how well we would like this recipe just as it was, but it turned out very good. I did add some hot chile oil and added an orange bell pepper with the red. I made double the sauce since we lke stir fry saucy. I will definitely make this again and may add broccoli nex time!

This was my most adventurous attempt to date, and I am happy to say it was a hit! I took advice from some other reviewers, and added some spices, and a little more soy...but overall it was tasty and quick! Hubby liked it, and baby girl is still eating her serving with gusto. Thanks for the great quick recipe Perlie!

Nice dish. Added a can of bamboo shoots and a small pinch of chinese five spice, plus some summer sqaush from end of summer bounty. We had it over steamed brown rice. Quite a nice way to use cabbage ground beef and veggies.

I made this twice in 1 week. Awesome. 1st time used green bell pepper (what I had) and added a bit of ginger. 2nd time I used chicken, threw in some broccoli, yellow onion, green onion and  more ginger in addition to the cabbage and bell pepper. This is so easy and delicious. All 3 of us couldn't get enough. Thank you so much for sharing.

I thought this recipe was pretty tasty "I did add alot more seasonings", but my dear husband said that it tasted like something they would serve on a navy ship.  He spent 20 years in the navy, so he has a pretty good understanding of their cuisine.

I would give this recipe 4.5 stars if I could.  Didn't knock our socks off, but it was a quick meal w/ a great taste.  I used 1 cup of beef broth instead of the water, and added red pepper flakes for some heat and color.  Great basic recipe that's easy to alter according to your own tastes.  Will definitely be making this one again !!  Thanks Pearlie !

i loved this recipe.  i made one slight change and that was that i used cut up sirloin instead of hamburger.  simply because i prefer peices of beef.  i would, next time, put my cabbage and bell pepper in at different times.  maybe i like my cabbage a little more cooked than the recipe intends, but when the cabbage was done, my bell peppers were soggy.  but otherwise, fantastic!!

I made a few adjustments like others did.  I used sliced sirloin filet which I marinated in mushroom soy sauce while I prepared the vegetables.  I can't say how much, I just did it to taste, MAYBE about 3tbsp and a few shakes of garlic powder (in addition to the cloves of garlic).  My boyfriend doesn't like peppers, so I used onions instead.  I think fresh sliced mushrooms would have been great in it if I had any on hand.  Kept everything else the same.  Everything turned out great.  This dish is similar to a dish that my mom makes.  She uses kale though, so I think kale would be a great substitute for the cabbage.  Only gave it a 4 though because even with all the changes and was great, it still needed something extra for oomph in flavor.  Mushrooms may make it a 5 for me.  Will definitely try again.

Really good! I only used 3 cloves of garlic (and that was even kinda pushing it for our tastes), added water chestnuts, and splashed in a little sesame oil. Served over brown rice. Hubby loves beef, cabbage, rice, and anything involving soy sauce so he was a happy camper. :)

This is like Japanese dish called Sukiyaki, but that dish uses thinly sliced beef steak, cooked in hot wok, set aside, then veggies are stir-fried, a few at a time, and kept hot. Beef is then dipped in beaten egg  while hot, before eaten, and veggies with sauce served over hot fluffy rice. My husband made this while stationed in Japan, brought recipe home from there. Good dish

I doubled the hamburger and cabbage, used one green pepper and one onion, doubled the soy sauce and used the same amount of hoison sauce since I had it on hand and they say the secret to great Chinese is lots of sauce.  Very yummy!  Would even be great without the meat for a nice vegetarian meal.

I prepared this in my wok.  I salted and browned the ground beef first, removed it, and poured off the oil.  I added half a chopped onion to the recipe and stir fried until softened.  After the onions were softened, I added in the garlic and about a teaspoon of fresh grated ginger.  I like black pepper so I used 1 ½ teaspoons of coarse ground pepper.  Then I added the cabbage and stir fried it for 3-4 minutes.  I added in two tablespoons of water and the soy sauce, lowered the heat and covered the wok to let the cabbage steam to soften it to al dente, about 3 minutes.  I placed the ground beef back into the wok and tossed it with the other ingredients.  I didn't have a fresh red bell pepper so I used jarred and added those in after the ground beef, tossing just to mix them in.  I omitted the cornstarch and ½ cup of water completely.

Wow, this was more interesting than I thought it would be for such a simple recipe.  I sautéed the garlic in a mix of olive oil, sesame oil and spicy chili oil.  I added some onion with the cabbage, and a beef bullion cube with the water and cornstarch.  I served the whole thing over rice.  The veggies stayed crisp, a nice mild mix of flavors.  Next time, I might punch it up with some red pepper flakes.  One review mentioned trying it with strips of beef instead.  I initially thought a stir fry with ground beef sounded strange, but the beef really blends in with the flavors well.  I would recommend trying it with the ground beef at least one.  I was pleasantly surprised.

Very good but needed a little more flavor. Next time I'll add a bunch of sliced scallions, a few more garlic cloves and use beef bouillon in place of the water.

This was very different from what my family usually dines upon; but they loved it. (Except my 3 year old turned up her nose w/out a taste, so her opinion doesn't count.) My husband said it looked like Hamburger Helper but he raved about the taste. I made extra sauce, served w/ white rice and Hawaiian bread. This is a great CHEAP recipe! Thanks!

Good and easy dish. I added onions, lots of seasonings and a bit of chili oil to spice things up a bit. I also used soy and teriyaki sauce. Hubby loves cabbage so this was a definite hit. Thanks Pearlie!

Fabulous!  I added a little beef bouillon to enhance the beef flavour, and some frozen peas and corn for colour.  I will certainly make this again.

One of my absolute favorite recipes on here! Even friends that "don't really like cabbage" love this when I make it, I make mine a little saucier by increasing the corn startch mixture & soy sauce (I don't measure when I cook so can't give exacts). This dish is DEEE-LISH!

YUM!!  There is nothing like a good kick of ground black pepper in a good old stir-fry, so this really hit the spot for us!  I passed on using the veggie oil as the ground beef has plenty of its own grease.  I just browned the beef & added the garlic to it a couple minutes before adding the bell pepper & cabbage.  I used 1/4 of a onion (sliced) that I had on hand and I would do that again.  The cooking time is a little longer than stated but still pretty quick - just stir-fry until your veggies are to your tenderness preference.  Everything else was perfect amounts & we enjoyed this dish with steamed jasmine rice and a side of egg drop soup.  Thank you for this recipe!  :)

I love, love, love this recipe! This is fast and easy and really versatile. The only thing I've noticed is that I've had to bring the amount of pepper way down, but that's because we don't like super spicy/hot foods. I've used this recipe more than once and it's a regular in my menu now. I never knew homemade stir-fry could turn out so good!

Actually, I thought this was pretty good, and healthy, too! Not sure what the others who hated it so much did wrong. My veges weren't soggy, either. If you know how to stir-fry, they should still be crisp when served. I used an orange bell pepper and everything was yummy! Also, as I am on a very strict diabetic diet, this was good because I could eat all of the ingredients. Thanks!

I thought this was great, but I did make some adjustments.  I added 1 Tbl. minced fresh ginger with the garlic, which was key to the authentic flavor.  I used 1 pkg. thin strips of beef instead of ground beef, as others suggested.  I used a bag of chopped cabbage as a timesaver (would definitely do that again!).  Next time I will marinate the beef overnight in some oil and soy sauce to make it more tender (it was still tough even thought it was wafer-thin, and I didn't over cook it).  Just as a personal preference, I will double the sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

We love this, could not get the kids to try it but my husband and I love it. Just the right amount of pepper to give it spice. I boil up some oriental ramen noodles, drain the water and sprinkle the seasoning packet on the noodles then toss with the hamburger/cabbage mixture.

I was heistant about making this dish and kept eyeing it.  Finally tried it tonight.  Very good!  I used carrots, snap beans, celery, cabbage and red bell peppers.  I stirred in 3 cups of brown rice to the cooked dish and served all together.  The veggies were still crunchy and everyone seemed to like it a lot.  My only concern was that it was too salty (not for the kids), but I'm sure that was my fault for not measuring the soy sauce.  I'll definitely try this one again (and measure the soy...LOL)

My mother-in-law is Japanese and she made this for my hubby's family all the time.  I simply cook the beef and onion with a minced head of garlic, drain off excess grease, then add the cabbage and some soy sauce.  I always serve it over rice.  I have tried to play with the recipe by trying different seasonings but my family seems to prefer it the same old way.   It is a great stand-by when I do not know what to cook and do not have alot of time.

yummy yummy!  family loved it, husband took leftovers to work.  following advice we used sirloins strips in place of ground beef and, in spirit of haluski, served with egg noodles instead of rice.  noodles sucked up juices overnigt for fantastic leftovers.  so glad to find this recipe absolute keeper!

My friend told me to try this recipe and it turned out great.  I sauteed a sliced small onion with the garlic, then added the beef with siracha sauce and crushed red chillies.  I also added a chicken stock boullion.

Really good as is but I made a few changes for our taste.  I used top sirloin cut into strips. I added 1/4 t. red pepper flakes, and for the sauce, I mixed 3 T. soy sauce, 1 T. rice vinegar, and 2 dashes hot chili oil together and poured it over all.  We like it a little spicy.  I only needed to use 1 t. cornstarch mixed with  1 T. water.  Thanks for a great recipe Pearlie!!

I was sort of let down by the outcome of this recipe. I thought it was real bland, even though I added more soy sauce.  I would also recommend cooking the bell pepper first for a few minutes and then adding the cabbage because it takes longer to cook.  The cabbage ended up being wilty and the whole meal took to long for what it was worth.  It was edible, but would not make again.

I did like this recipe but found it lackluster ...
Second Round: 
added a TBSP of fish sauce to the meat (1/2 ground Pork 1/2 beef) before frying ... added 1/2 tsp ginger with garlic after browning meat and instead of water broth. A hit of sriracha at the end and that brought the rating up to 4.5 and made it a keeper ...

I added a spoonful of hoisin sauce and some chili/garlic sauce for some zing.  1 lb. of ground chuck and a pre chopped package of coleslaw mix.  Put the cabbage at the end of recipe to keep some crunch.  Will be making this one again.

I found this recipe to be 100% authentic as if I were eating it in China.  I don't mean americanized Chinese.  I mean real Chinese.  One thing I did differently, I added a whole head of cabbage as opposed to 1/2 since I wanted more veggies.  I also added top round steak instead of ground beef.  Overall, 4 out of 5 stars. =)

I doubled the recipe but put in much more black pepper than called for as I didn't think the amount in the recipe was enough. With that tweak and adding a little sweet soy sauce, it was a tasty and simple dinner for a busy weekday night.

very tasty stir fry... I am not sure if I really like using ground beef in a stir fry but this still turned out good... very cheap and easy to make.. I doubled the recipe... and added an onion instead of a a second bell pepper... also I used beef broth instead of water.. next time I might try using thinly sliced beef instead of hamburger... very peppery... good flavor..

Yum!  Doubled the recipe - did not use the cornstarch.  This is a good base recipe.  You do need to ADD some additional seasonings - like ginger, chinese allspice, paprika, etc.  Also, don't be afraid to add more cabbage, mushrooms, etc. This turned out great for us and makes a ton.  Will make again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

Outside of using yellow pepper and adding 2T. oyster sauce we followed this completely and while it was good and will be used again, it was a little bland and slightly greasy. Next time we'll try adding sesame oil instead of oyster sauce and will drain the beef before adding the vegetables. Thanks for the recipe!

When asked "what's for dinner tonight?" I responded ground beef stir fry...WHAT??? was the response.  This is a really fast and tasty dish.  I did add half an onion, vertically-sliced, but followed the recipe otherwise.  I had some concerns about 1 tsp pepper, so I started with 1/2 tsp, but after tasting, added the additional 1/2 tsp, just the right amount of pepper for us.  I had a package of noodles from the oriental market that had been sitting in the fridge for a while, so I used that instead of rice.  Next time, I'll definitely use the rice.  Great Friday night meal, thanks!

I thought this was very good.  I doubled the meat seasoned with a little onion powder, salt and pepper and added cooked rice and garlic in with the meat mixture.  I don't like peppers so left that out and it was still tasty.  Next time I'm going to substitute elbow mac instead of rice.  Great easy meal to make during the week and bring leftovers to work for lunch.

Excellent!  It's like eating an egg roll without the fried "roll" part!  Yum.  Definitely making this one again.

This was awesome.  Easy to make and very tasty.  I added sliced onions to the stir-fry.

This is not the most beautiful meal, but it tastes great. I gave it 4 stars because I didn't totally follow it.  I added a soy garlic sauce made by Iron Chef.  This was a great addition, it added more flavor.  I definately would make it again as there were no leftovers.

My husband abhors cabbage so I don't make this recipe often, but when he was deployed I had it all the time. It's easy to reheat as leftovers and I love the flavor combination. Delicious!

Fantastic!  Very simple to make.  I used venison, added a little onion, and reduced the black pepper to 1/4 tsp.  I loved it!  Thanks for a quick and easy recipe!

Love this recipe! I doubled it using a lb. of ground turkey and a whole small head of cabbage, shredded. I omitted the red pepper because I didn't have any on hand. I substituted julienned baby carrots, diagonally sliced celery and some chopped onion. Really great taste... our family of 4 ate it all in one sitting! :) Thanks, Pearlie!

I, also, added some things to spice this up, and it went from a 3 to a 5-star. I added green onions, sesame oil, ginger root, chili garlic sauce, and extra cabbage (shredded semi-finely) I served over jasmine rice and my husband loved it!

I love how easy this recipe was to make!  Even my chef boyfriend was impressed.  The original recipe is too bland for my taste, so I added a little more salt (to taste) and then added 2 tsp of chili garlic sauce (find in the Asian aisle).  If you like it spicy, the chili garlic sauce gives it a nice kick.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  I like to use extra lean ground beef to keep the recipe healthier.  YUM!

Yummy!  Husband and I really enjoyed this--definitely a "make again" recipe.  I made it with zucchini and carrots instead of bell pepper and it was great.  Also, I didn't have any cornstarch on hand and left it out.  After the meal, I mixed the leftover stir-fry and rice together.  We had to add more soy sauce, but it tasted good that way as leftovers, too!

This has become one of our favorites. I especially like how it can be made from ingredients that keep for a long time making a great "last minute dinner". Tonight I substituted breakfast sausage for the ground beef. Sounds kind of weird but it turned out great. Also have put other veggies on hand in. Also if you're short on time use a package of pre-cut cole slaw mix.

This was a great easy recipe that really makes a lot so for those who have people who like seconds, this is the recipe for you. Italian sausage made with venison and a green pepper were the only substitutes that I made. We ate it for two days and the dish still held up. My kids are particular when it comes to peppers, but they didn't seem to mind. This is a comfort recipe.

I would definitely make this again. It's a quick and easy weeknight meal. I decided to kick it up a notch and I used Johnsonville Sweet Italian sausage instead of the ground beef.  I kept everything else the same.  I don't normally use oil when I brown ground beef, or any other ground meat, so I omitted it. I served this over basmati rice. Yum!

It was a good combination of ingredients and pretty quick and easy to make. However, I made it exactly to the recipe and to be honest it was a bit boring. I would have enjoyed it a bit more with some more interesting flavors. It did all get eaten so it wasn't a bad recipe, just not very exciting.

This stuff tastes GREAT served with white rice and a little bit more soy sauce drizzled over it. I've made this two or three times now! Love it! I can't remember if it says to add onion or not but I always put onion in mine.

It was ok. It didn't have as much flavor as I was hoping. If I make it again I think I'll add some fresh chopped ginger because it just seemed to need something else.

I made several changes to this recipe - however as written I am sure Grumpy would have liked it better.  I changed up the sauce some and spiced it up with black bean chili sauce.  I totally LOVED it.  I am big on peppers and spice.  I think next time I will have to forgo the spice for Grumpy and go with the amount of peppers in the recipe.  I guess this was more for me than him since he's not a pepper fan either but I was craving beef cabbage and peppers and this recipe came up first in my search!

We thought this recipe was pretty good, not spectacular but all right. Since I all ready had to defrost a pound of ground beef I went on ahead and used the whole pound and a whole head of the cabbage. I doubled the water and cornstarch mixture too, but didn't want the soy sauce to overwhelm the dish so I left that at the 2T. Turned out much more filling than I thought it would and we have plenty leftover for the next couple of days. The prep time does take longer than the 15 minutes stated, but it's still pretty easy to prepare. I thought this would have more flavor than it did, but still tasted good. Not sure if I would make again, but it does make for a very easy dinner that doesn't take a whole lot of time. Thanks for the recipe, LI-ANN!

I think this would have been better if I had a wok to cook it in.  And next time I would add some chopped ginger or ground ginger powder.  It needed some flavor.  I plan to make again and tweak according to our tastes.

This one is a keeper.  Not only is it quick, but it is very tasty.  The only change I made was to use beef broth instead of water with the cornstarch.  I also tossed sliced scallions in just before serving.  Thanks for a quick and delicious weeknight meal.

This was a decent weeknight meal that came together quickly.  I used sirloin strips instead of ground beef and added some rice wine vinegar to the sauce.

Nice,  easy  dish to make. I served it over Jasmine rice and topped with Sriracha hot sauce (it was a little bland but I like spicy food- get your hot sauce out if you are like me).  Next time, I'll try a little sesame oil and maybe some Oyster sauce or the spiciness of fresh ginger might be nice.

This was kind of greasy, maybe from the grade of ground chuck I used. This was filling and really good with rooster hot sauce on top. Served with some cooked rice. and added a yellow pepper with the red pepper.

This was definitely good, but not wonderful. Certainly easy, with very simple ingredients, but it lacked some flavor that I just can't quite identify. Husband suggested ginger could improve it, but I don't think that alone would elevate this recipe from okay/good to super/delicious. I'll probably experiment with it again, because of its simplicity, but it wasn't what I'd hoped.

I think this recipe is great! I would have never put ground beef in a chinese dish, but it was good. The first time I followed the recipe the next few times I had to improvise and now I use brown gravy mix in stead of cornstarch, and double the sauce. I also add some chinese hot sauce for more kick. Tonight I used ground turkey and it was really good. I will cook this again!
Update-Jan 2012--once again loved this recipe!! Even my son that normally wouldn't look at Cabbage, loves it!

This is really good.  I used a whole pound of ground beef and used 2 carrots in place of the red pepper.  Simple and inexpensive - thanks for sharing!

I recommend doubling the recipe for a little left over.  Also, I put broccoli in it and it was delicious.

Doubling the recipe, I used strips of beef, one napa (Chinese) cabbage, a small onion, one red and one green pepper, and handful of mushrooms, and omitted the black pepper.  Instead I used a 1/4 teaspoon of curry, red pepper, and ginger, and a pinch of cayenne.It was excellent this way - I think it would've been very bland as submitted.  Served with jasmine rice.

Awesome quick and easy!!!  My kids loved this and ask for it all the time.  Its easy to see why its the mac & cheese of Asian children.  Served with rice or over noodles and easy to tweak with other veggies & variations on the sauce this dish has become a favorite in our household.

This was fabulous! It had great Chinese flavor, and was more economical than the recipes calling for pepper steak. I added an onion with the garlic and used a mixture of ground beef and ground turkey. It's great over rice. Thanks for a winner!

This is relatively tasteless until you tweak it.  I added onion, beef broth, salt and chili garlic sauce as recommended, and I thought it still needed something.  Not sure what though.
I served it over brown rice that I cooked in beef broth.  Has potential, but just ok for me.

Very good and very easy.  I cut up 3 chicken breasts and sauteed them in the oil with the garlic.  I also doubled the recipe and used 1 red pepper and 1 orange pepper.  The sauce was very tasty but a little thinner than I had hoped.  I think next time I will cut back on the water.  I had no issues needing salt.  In fact, next time I will use low sodium soy sauce since I've noticed my fingers are swelling slightly.  I will also grate a little ginger in with the cabbage, add some green onion and maybe some shredded carrots, mushrooms, and water chestnuts.  I think broccoli would be too strong a flavor to add.

used 1/2 bag of coleslaw instead of bok choy! (last time we used bok choy I really, really cleaned it, yet still found a fly within it's many crevaces! Ew, do you blame me?)
Added:  
sliced one onion 
about 1 tsp minced fresh ginger 
My entire clan, including ages 2, 4, 7 & 12 ate it up and LOVED it!  My husbandand I really enjoyed it! (I was skeptical, ground beef in a Chinese recipe?)  I loved that it was incredibly cheap and fast to make.  Good on thin, Chinese noodles or Rice!  Don't let rice-a-roni know about this!  They'll patent it!
NOTE: Used ground Turkey, GREAT!

Don't know if I should have given this recipe 4 stars because a few changes were made.  Based on suggestions from other reviews...add onion, mushrooms, bean sprouts & beef broth instead of plain water.  It turned out really good!  We had it over rice and it would probably be even better over ramen noodles...thanks for the recipe, we'll make again.

Good simple recipe but remember that in oriental cusine one should also use a little sliced onion with the garlic and grate in some fresh ginger root it will add another depth of flavor without calories.

This was really easy and tasty.  My husband, 7 and 3 year olds ate it up in no time.  I used red cabbage instead of green and added onions and celery as well.  Didn't do the cornstarch and water at the end and it was fine.

I usually don't write reviews, but this was absolutely wonderful.  I will put this on my menu rotation.  The only thing I changed was that I doubled the recipe and added half of an onion cut in strips.  Yum yum!

This was pretty good. I should have drained the oil once the groundbeef was cooked. Not doing so, made it too oily. Otherwise, the flavor was wonderful.

I always check the reviewers comments but this time I was in a rush and didn't.  Mistake!  This was a VERY BLAND DISH - we ended up shaking more soy sauce on it when we ate it to give it some more flavor.  Had I followed the reviewers suggestions - I would have added onion, mushroom etc. to this dish.  I am giving it a 3 rating but with some changes this could be a better dish.

This a definite keeper!  My 12 y/o son loved it. I used a pound of ground beef but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Very quick and easy. It had a nice thick rich flavorful gravy. I'll be making this again soon. Yum!

I stumbled upon this recipe while looking for a way to use up ground sirloin.  I substituted green beans for the cabbage, doubled the soy and added chili paste.  The flavor was good, but the texture reminded me of boxed dinners...will try again with sliced beef and not ground.

I also used top sirloin cut into strips, however I marinated the beef in schewan sauce and a dash of chili garlic sauce.  I added an onion and snap peas and found this dish to be very good.  I like my food spicy, so I added more chili garlic sauce to my plate.  Will make again.

Cabbage is always good stir-fried, but the original recipe needs more flavor.  I used some grated ginger and red pepper flakes instead of black pepper.  It's more interesting-looking if you use red cabbage or yellow bell peppers.

I made this with 1 bag of coleslaw mix already shredded and a bag of frozen stir-fry peppers.  Also used 1 1/2 lbs hamburger so the recipe came out to about double portions. I used beef broth instead of water with the cornstarch and used twice the amount with 2 TB cornstarch. Also I thought it needed more pizazz so added ginger, cayenne pepper, and hot sauce.  Turned out pretty good.

Even though I used ground sirloin and drained what fat there was, the dish was still greasy. Almost like the cabbage soaked up the fat. I think I'll try it again, but maybe with ground turkey.

This has become one of our household staples. It's quick and easy to make, and everyone enjoys it. I add a beef bullion cube or beef stock like others have recommended.

I used 1/2 lb of ground pork as that is what i had and a full bag of the coleslaw mix with carrot , green and red cabbage. Could easily be made Whole 30 with aminos and arrowroot powder instead of soy sauce and cornstarch.  Great flavor, very, very easy to whip up, very quick.

I followed the reviews and changed it around a bit.  I used turkey sausage, added a whole onion to the meat while cooking, used broth instead of water to mix with the cornstarch and I doubled the recipe. I also had a bag of cole slaw mix on hand to add instead of straight cabbage. I made this for my parents and 3 year old daughter and there was almost none left over (it made quite a lot). The ingredients sounded too simple to be that flavorful, but the dish pleasantly surprised us all! The best part - all of the ingredients were on hand so no extra trip to the grocery store!

I loved this recipe so much!  Followed directions exactly except replaced water with chicken broth.  I am a huge stir fry fan and never even considered using ground beef!  It was awesome.  I also bought a bag of shredded cabbage and it worked great!  Definitely shred the cabbage as thin as you can if using a head.  I will  make this again ( soon) ! May add some fresh ginger and a little oyster sauce next time .

Update:  I have made this several more times but with fresh ground turkey.  I also add a thin sliced onion and some fresh Thai Basil from my herb garden.  Super easy to make and very delicious!!!

never thought my Irish Mom's Chinese comfort food would be published, NICE...
as a fancy dish, not incredibly great, but kept me growing up and keeps me coming back now for seconds and small thirds, so i am in as 5 for home cooking, and 4 for chef ratings...  Something wonderful about cabbage. I add celery tops for fun too...  Nice job. thanks.

Black pepper beef has be in my arsenal for a very long time. I found a Black Pepper sauce at my local Asian store and have been using the prepared sauce for several years.

I use strips of beef rather than ground.

This was ok-  I followed the recipe as written except for adding an onion.  I tried it because I had a huge head of cabbage I needed to use.  I resisted adding other things because I wanted to see if the recipe was as good as the reviews said. It needs more flavor, it didn't really taste like a stir fry.  I think I will try chicken next time and marinate it first in Soyaki from Trader Joes and then add a little sesame oil when I cook the veggies.

Quick, delicious, healthy meal.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef and added onions, Worcestershire  Sauce, and bouillon. I also seasoned with Mrs. Dash.  My picky husband and daughter both told me I should make it again.

Good basic recipe.  Use dark soy sauce to make it more authentic.  And you could use ground pork if you want.  Make sure to add some sesame oil while cooking.  I needed more flavor, so I added some ginger (keep peeled ginger in freezer and you can always have some on hand to grate into your meals).  

My chow mein noodles needed some curry powder, so i sprinkled about 1 Tbsp into them and stirred it into the finished mixture.  I like some Korean hot paste mixed in to, made it delicious.  With my changes, it would be a fantastic recipe (like 4 stars), but as written I have to rate it 3.5.

Wow, this was tasty!! Loved it, I would never have thought to make a stir fry with hamburger, but it works. It tasted a lot better than I was expecting.  I will make this again for sure. Oh, and I used beef broth instead of the water, about 1 cup so there would be plenty of sauce.

This was good.  I added a bit of Sriracha and it made it pretty spicy.  I think it needs just a bit more flavor but the texture was great and it's a pretty healthy and flexible recipe.  I will be making it again.

I tried this recipe yesterday, and the results were AMAZING!!! I tweaked a few things though - I first boiled the ground beef in some water to make it easier to cook. I also used one large red onion together with the garlic, grated 3 carrots and mixed them with the cabbage, and seasoned the dish with salt, garam masala, and ground coriander (In addition to the black pepper). My first attempt at this, and I LOVED it!

Loved it.  So easy yet the crunch of the cabbage adds so much to the dish.  I used a mandolin (my latest kitchen toy which I think I'll be using a lot!) for the cabbage.  My husband wants me to add this to the regular rotation.
update 4/11/14:  This is still so good - it really holds up well and I love it plain or served over rice.  I still make it all the time, now I just need to take a photo!  (Unfortunately, it's all gone before I can)

This recipe wasn't bad- it just wasn't good, either.  It was extremely bland as written.  I ended up adding onion and garlic powders, sriracha, fish sauce, and ginger.  My husband topped his with hot banana sauce.  With the extra seasonings it was ok, but not one I'll be repeating.

This turned out quite well, although I did add an onion and doubled the sauce.  I had to use an orange pepper in lieu of the red (store had no red).  Served with asian noodles and fried rice.  Thanks for sharing this tasty and economical recipe, LI-ANN!

The recipe says 2 tablespoons of soy sauce. You will need quite a bit more than that! Also, reduce the amount of water you use or increase the amount of cornstarch. My boyfriend loved it, I thought it was good, but not great. It works with the hamburger which surprised me.Its a good base recipe, and you can play around with it.

I made this even though my husband was against the cabbage. I added an onion, Worcestershire sauce, substituted ground turkey, and doubled the cabbage. Served it over jasmine rice. My husband just loved it and now asks me to make it.

The pepper taste was a lot stronger in this dish than I thought it'd be.  I had trouble getting the sauce to thicken so it turned out sort of watery, but was still a big hit.  I added some sliced carrots to the mix too.

Used green pepper instead of red because I had it on hand. As I was preparing I was thinking my grandson is not going to eat this (he's funny about the way things "look") but he CLEANED his plate. I served it over rice and it was pretty good. When I make it again, I will definitely "spice" it up as it was a little bland. Not sure what the 1/2 t. cornstarch did, it didn't seem to thicked at all. I also liked the idea of adding broccoli next time.

I really liked this dish, it is quick and tasty. I did, however, make the ground beef in another pan making sure there were large chunks of meat, then I added it to the pepper and cabbage mixture and gently stirred it in making sure not to break the meat up too much.

I doubled this recipe and cheated a little bit.  Instead of shredding a cabbage (I'm lazy and have no interest in shredding a cabbage myself), I used a bag of cole slaw cabbage mix.  I also used a green pepper instead of red.  Overall, I think this was a decent recipe.  I think it could have used more black pepper.  Since it's in the title of the recipe, I expected it to stand out more than it actually did.  I also didn't think there was enough soy sauce.  If making it again, I'd use a lot more of that and less water.  The ground beef does give it a different flavor/texture and it probably would be better with some sort of beef strips.  But for economics sake, the ground beef was fine.  I would make this again, with the few changes I mentioned.  It was cheap and easy and everyone enjoyed it.

There is no way that just soy sauce and garlic cloves can season plain ground beef and add flavor to the veggies. I added so much additional seasoning to this.

This just needed something.  It was good and easy to make and a meal right up my alley, but just lacked flavor.  I used ground chicken and a couple of hot italian sausage (crumbled out of its casing) instead of beef.  Loved the caggage in it.  Needed extra soy sauce.  Added corn and used beef broth instead of water.  Will prob make again, but will amp up the seasoning and try it with beef.

This recipe is easy, but totally bland as written.  You'll notice that almost every reviewer who gave this dish 4 stars or higher made a ton of modifications.  I salvaged the meal with some Sriracha sauce, but in the future I'll keep looking.

Made as written except I added onions and yellow peppers.  Also added beef bouilion to the water/cornstarch mixture.  It was okay.  Nothing spectacular.  Probably won't make it again.

Delicious dish.  Wasn't sure about the ground beef but the texture and flavor were wonderful. I used red and orange peppers and beef broth rather than water.  Loved the cabbage.  I adjusted the soy sauce amount to taste (used slightly more).  The black pepper gave it a kick but I wouldn't recommend cutting the amount.  This dish was even better warmed up the next day.

Great meal that takes no time to prepare, and no time to cook.  I added half a cup more soy sauce for a MUCH BETTER taste.  Kid friendly meal, but also great for an adult occasion.

This was pretty good but I cut the black pepper in half.  I'm glad I did b/c it was on the verge of too peppery even with just the 1/2 tsp.

I made a healthier version with ground turkey, olive oil, and used a whole head of cabbage since I used a pound of turkey. I also used the suggestion of another person and used chicken broth mixed with the cold water and cornstarch. Served it with steamed long grain brown rice. YUMMY!!! My four year old licked her plate clean! Amazing for a picky eater. Added to my recipe box!

I made this with a whole head of cabbage and instead of ground beef, used textured veggie protein mealstarter "crumbles." Really good! I love those things and may never use ground beef in a recipe again! I also used a bit of ginger and some minced onion and vegetable broth instead of water.  Yummy!

I have to join the ranks of those who really like this dish. It was easy, but not that quick (maybe the prep time calculated did not include the time to prep the veggies). My husband is not a fan of pepper, so I reduced the amount of black pepper.  I shredded half of a Chinese cabbage, and the amount seemed too much for the ground beef, so I doubled the meat, and the proportion seemed perfect. Next time (and there will be a next time) I will put the red pepper strips in a little earlier. My daughter didn't try the food yet, but I expect a high rating from her as well... Thanks for a tasty recipe for a vegetable that I have rarely cooked before.

This caught my eye so last night I had a lb of ground beef thawed and decided to make this. I did double the sauce and cut back on the oil, but this was very, very good, easy and budget friendly. I think I will use some chili oil next time as we like some kick, but will make this again often. I like the fact that you can change it up based upon what you have in the fridge. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is one of the best Chinese recipes I have ever made--simple and delicious.  It tastes more like meals I have gotten in Chinatown in Philadelphia than at your more typical "Chinese" buffet.  I think the quality of the ingredients makes a big difference in this recipe--I used ground grass-fed beef, and this dish really showcased the depth of flavor of the meat.

Great Recipe! The only thing I did differently was use a very finely sliced flat iron steak instead of gb. I roasted a 1.5lb piece of flat iron steak in the oven at 280 for 45 min or until the steak has an internal temp of 135. Let it cool and slice very thin, Add it AFTER the veg and enjoy.

Quick, easy and customizable. Like other reviewers, I added a bit more seasoning - sesame oil, some onion powder, a dash of hoisin sauce. I also added sliced green onions, and sprinkled some toasted sesame seeds over the finished dish. Not bad at all. Thanks!

I make this recipe for my family once a month with a few changes. We use ground turkey instead of beef, cook onions in a little sesame oil with cabbage, bell peppers & garlic. I also use chicken or beef broth instead of water.  I add Chinese 5 spice over the whole dish at the end, cook for a few mins more & serve over brown rice.  My boyfriend's teenager loves it!!

We substituted soy crumbles for the meat to make this a vegetarian dish.  Double the sauce it'll be good!

This is sooooooooooo good! My picky husband even likes it. He turned his nose up at it when he saw it and said "eeew, is that chinese food??" I made him try it and he liked it! I've fixed this several times so far. I cut back on the garlic and I added sliced green onions.

Absolutely delicious and quick.  I used boneless pork chops cut into strips because that is what I had taken out for dinner. I also used EVOO, other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I put this recipe in my favorites.  Thanks for the delicious quick meal.

This was very good.  I doubled the recipe and added zucchini.  I also used red cabbage because that's what I had.  I will make again and will probably use chicken or another cut of beef.  I was glad to find this though because I had ground meat out and my husband brought in a ton of peppers from the garden.  Thanks for posting!

I've made this several times and we always enjoy it. The meat tends to stick to the skillet so you might want to use a non-stick variety if you have one.

Quite tasty.  I used green onions in place of the red pepper, and added some brown sugar to the soy sauce.  Then to serve the stir fry I cooked ramen noodles and tossed it together to let the wonderful flavor of the sauce meld with the noodles.  Garnished it with a few chives for extra color.

The recipee by itself did not have much flavor.  I added extra soy sauce once it was on my plate & that helped.  I think adding stir fry sauce or something else to add flavor would help.

We all found this pretty plain even though I added mushrooms and onions.  It did help to put more black pepper on while eating eat.  Maybe with different spices it would be more tasty but this wasn't for us...sorry.

I love, love, love it!!! I use more garlic and have found I don't need the cornstarch or water at the end. Maybe, I use more cabbage than listed, so it doesn't have a lot of sauce to thicken.

I really liked it until I added the cornstarch mixture. The cornstarch gave it a weird taste and made it mushy. If I make agin I will leave out the cornstarch.

I agree with the person who said the meat should be drained of fat. I didn't my first try and I think it probably took away from the taste of this dish. On the plus side, everyone in my household liked it. Will keep this one.

This was surprisingly good.  I chose this recipe because I had ground beef and cabbage I wanted to use up.  With a couple dashes of Franks Red Hot Sauce to give it a little zip, the family really liked this.

Had a little too much cabbage in it the first time I made it, so the second time I bought an even smaller head, otherwise use 1/3 head.  I also added onion, carrots, mushrooms to the stirfry.

Very quick to make meal although I did not use chinese cabbage, just the regular cabbage which I precooked a bit first. We enjoyed this dish, just enough for 2 with a bit left over for a lunch for 1.

This was very easy to make and very good, although I thought it needed a little more flavor, so I added a bottle of ginger teriyaki sauce I had on hand.  I also used ground turkey instead of ground beef.

This recipe was quite a pleasant surprise! Looking for something that would help me incorporate other veggies into our meals,I used ground turkey, and decided to add onion as other reviews suggested, minced the garlic and sauted it in the oil on lower heat for a bit. Other than that, I stuck to the recipe, and served over hot rice. 
This is definitely a recipe I will use again. I gave it 4 stars only because the sauce never really thickened to a sauce consistency that I expected. I didnt add the beef boullion as other reviews suggested and was very happy with the flavor. Thank you for helping me find a way to get our 11 year old to eat cabbage!

This recipe is cheap and it makes alot when combined with rice, I don't know where all the sauce is that other reviewers are talking about. Before adding the water and corn starch I stood over the stove wondering what I was supposed to be thickening up. I added onion, salt and some more soy sauce. Not sure If i will make it again.

Very good. I like this healthy and yuumy meal.  I didn't add quite as much black pepper (family preference) and substituted beef stock for the water.  THere is a lot of natural flavor in this dish and my family loved it.  Will make again and again!

Our family loved this recipe - I did make a few changes,as others had suggested.  I added some onion, which I browned with the beef and pepper strips - also used beef broth in place of water.  I added some sesame oil and a bit of hot sauce.  Served it over rice.  There were no leftovers.  We have a garden and the cabbage is at it's peak, so we will be enjoying this again soon.  Thanks Pearlie.

I'm glad that I read all the other posted reviews as I took many of the suggestions into account when making this, ie: added salt, more seasonings, mushrooms, carrots and onions.  I don't think I'll make this again, though.

This is terrific!  A new family favourite. Even #2 daughter who hates cabbage loved it.  I added a sprinkling of red chili flakes and two chopped green onions at the end of the cooking time for a little fresh crunch.  Just fantastic flavour.  Thanks Pearlie!

I made this for it's low carb value.  It was ok but nothing special.  Be prepared to cook it longer than recipe suggests.  Also, if I made it again, I would substitute onion for some of the peppers.  I seasoned my ground beef with garlic powder and seasoning salt, but the recipe still needed more salt or soy sauce.

I liked this recipe because the most work was in preparing the food and then the cooking was easy.  The vegetable were so much better than the pre-packed oriental ones.  I used the mixture it was marinaded in to also cook with and make the recipe more moist.  This may have contributed to it being a little too salty and my husband to say it was too mushy.

I really liked this but as written and with my added additional seasoning it was bland.   Shredded the cabbage and pepper and added an onion and green onion.  To the meat mix I added a 1/2 tsp of ground ginger.   I added seasme oil to the pan to fry up the veg. To the vegetables I added more ginger and pepper.  I doubled the soy sauce and didn’t need the cornstarch.   Served over rice and it neede sriracha.  I’ll make it again.  Just make sure to add more spices.

Oh my goodness! I was TOTALLY skeptical of this recipe with ground beef, but based on the reviews, I had to try it.  I doubled the recipe & the only thing I added was a can of chopped water chestnuts, onion, beef broth instead of water & some sesame oil.  I served it over spaghetti because I didn’t have egg noodles.  My family DEVOURED it.  My daughter said it tastes like Pei Wei’s lettuce wraps.  LOVED this for flavor, ease & low cost to make. WIN! WIN! WIN!

Found this to be just ok.  Since cabbage does not soak up flavor this recipe comes down to the juice.  I tried tweaking this to my  tastes and it just wouldn't pull together.  I used fish sauce and added diced tomatoes and a pinch of sugar.  It just didn't do anything for me.  It was healthy (love cabbage as a super food) and warm which fits the bill some nights.

Very quick weeknight meal, who doesn't like that? I omitted bell peppers as I'm not fond of them and cornstarch (didn't think I needed a thickening agent). The beau went back for seconds; overall great meal.

Thought there would be leftovers for lunch but everyone loved it .  I can't have soy so I swapped out the soy sauce for coconut aminos and my heat loving husband and son added some siracha to theirs.  Very simple and quick.

Great way to use up a bunch of cabbage! I used green and purple cabbage, coconut aminos (instead of soy sauce) and added onion and yellow bell peppers. Also added a little Chinese 5 spice. I left out the corn starch/water combo so it was less of a stir fry and more of a ground meat dish. Easy dish to prep for lunch this week. Will serve over rice or cauliflower rice.

I made this following the recipe almost exactly, except that I changed the corn starch for flour, as I didn't have any. It was delicious and satisfying. I will add more  spices next time, but that's just my personal taste.

I made the recipe almost to the letter... The only difference was, the head of cabbage that I had seemed like it was making way too much as I was shredding it, so I only used 1/2 the head. Also, I added one more tablespoon of soy sauce, probably would have been fine without the extra.

I WILL make it again, but when I do I will use a bag of cole slaw cabbage because it's basically already cut up cabbage with a little bit of carrot. That will make it very quick and easy! It is a good recipe... 
It would probably also be good with chicken or sliced beef!

Made some changes.  Didn't think  ground beef should be in a stir fry so i changed to pork.  Used pork steak.  Followed the recipe for the most part but added a little Sambal Oelek Chili paste to spice it up.  Doubled the recipe as we had a lot of unexpected family to the cabin that afternoon.  Added a little carrot in addition to the red pepper for color only.  Cooked 7 cups of white rice and everything went!  Many came back for seconds and asked for recipe.

After reading other reviews, I minced and added a tablespoon of fresh ginger, substituted sesame oil, doubled the cabbage, and added oyster sauce.  I was pleased with the flavors and freshness of ingredients.

I read a lot of the reviews before I made it.  I added some minced ginger, rice vinegar, beef bullion and a partial bag of 'stir fry' vegetables because I had them in the freezer needing to be used. Served it with basmati rice. It was delicious and easy to put together. This dish begs to be made the same day as a visit to the farmer's market. It has many possibilities.

A tasty, quick stir fry. I doubled the recipe, added 2 zucchinis, used tamari instead of soy sauce, olive oil instead of vegetable, arrowroot instead of cornstarch (increased to 1.5 TBs) and chicken stock instead of water. I also added some salt to taste. I sauteed the peppers and zucchini first, then  removed and browned the beef, added the garlic in the last 30 seconds before adding the cabbage, other veggies and the liquids. I mixed the stock and soy together with the thickener and added at the same time and just cooked until thickened. I thought it needed a bit of zip so stirred in 2 TBs of chili garlic sauce. Garnished with some toasted sesame seeds and served over steamed white rice.

If was so delicious, I made it a second time four days later. Everyone raved both times. The only change I made was that I  used only one red bell pepper for a doubled batch,  added beef bouillon to the water , and added toasted slivered almonds before serving. It was a 10!

Good stuff - pretty much as advertised.  I made it without change but noted that when I make it again, I want to kick it up a notch, perhaps with the addition of some spicy peppers.  Leftovers were better than when the dish was just made.

This was great for low-carb seekers. I doubled the beef and the sauce and added onions. You could use just about any vegetable.  The beef drippings and the soy sauce create a nice rich flavor. Great leftovers.

I tried to make this recipe as close to what it called.  However I really thought that 1/2 a head of cabbage was too much so I opted for 1/4 which for me was perfect.

I combined some leftover ground pork that I had sautéed with onion, with best quality fresh ground beef. Also substituted a light sprinkling to taste of whole black peppercorns. I also took the easy route with prepared coleslaw mix. It was done in a jiffy, and was light and tasty, served over rice vermicelli noodles.

There was an error on the website, so it shows I made this dish twice, but I only made it once.  I love it! Easy, quick and full of flavor. I added onions and shredded carrots. I might use broccoli instead of cabbage next time to see a different flavor profile. Watch the heat factor if using a wok. Cooks quickly. Definite keeper!

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I used a pkg of coleslaw mix  which made it really easy to prepare.  Great taste and will make this again.

This was really tasty and so simple to put together! I like things on the hot side, so I added a diced jalapeno as well as a couple teaspoons of habanero pepper flakes. I'd make this again in an instant!!

I hacked the recipe.  Used meatless crumbles (vegetarian) and frozen cut cup pepper strips and served over shataki spaghetti noodles! Did chop fresh cabbage.  Amazing, easy, quick and great satisfying taste.

I used a 12 oz package of Morning Star Farms Grillers Crumbles, fettucini and 3 tbsp of tamari sause instead of soy sauce.  I did not add any cornstach..  After cooking the fettucini I added it to the stir fry.  It's vegan and tastes great.

The dish was okay but, I was expecting more flavor. If I make it again,I'll probably add sliced onions and something that adds some spice.

Took advice using beef broth instead of water and used already shredded cabbage in bags.  I also gave it a little back heat using Chinese chili sauce. came out mighty tasty. Next time I will add more cabbage and peppers.

I can see myself making this again. I omitted the cornstarch because it wasn't so watery as to where I couldn't stand it. I also added sausage links, yellow bell pepper in addition to the red and spinach to the mix. Since I'm on a low-carb kick I omitted the rice but it tasted so good, full of flavor!

Excellent quick all in one meal.  Not a big beef eater, but the ground sirloin was great.  I added some ginger along with the garlic to give the beef a little kick.

with a couple changes to the original recipe, I made this..used beef strips which I tenderized with a mallet  and napa cabbage..recipe turned out great. I am trying to go more stir fry for meals instead of frying and  this recipe is a great start for anyone who wants to go that way and get away from frying so much...its easy and quick..

Loved this recipe a thing I changed was I did add fresh ginger and onions. Served it with Chinese noodles. I think it would also make a delicious lettuce wrap with hoisin sauce.

This was so simple. I did not make it exactly like the recipe but close. I did not use the cornstarch or water.  I was worried the soy sauce alone would not be flavorful enough but it was delicious. I used cabbage, pepper, broccoli, cauliflower and mushrooms. Simple, fast and delicious. I will definitely make this again.

Delicious! I used beef loin and added in fresh grated ginger and onion,  and subbed beef broth for the water. Left out added salt because the broth was salty enough.

I use petite sirloin steaks that I slice into thin strips in place of the hamburger and use appx 1 lb. I've made it with and without the cabbage, and I use onion and a green pepper (instead of red) cut into strips.

This was good, and much simpler and thus faster than most of my Asian recipes. I eliminated the need for oil by using the fat from the ground beef to cook the cabbage. I did the garlic almost at the end of the cooking time. I added an extra teaspoon of soy sauce, and some cayenne pepper for me.

I used Stir-Fry Beef instead of Ground Beef and it was awesome. Like the comments say, good flavor, but the aroma is very good as well. It will make you hungry!

This was quite tasty, easy to prepare, and very economical. I do have a couple of suggestions - I added a sliced onion that I had hanging around and needed to be used up in with the cabbage, and I used chicken broth instead of water. I think the next time I make it I'll add some grated ginger, too, and a splash of fish sauce to give it a little more oomph. It was great as is, though, and I got a good-sized dinner out of it and I have what appears to be two lunches left over. Just make sure you leave a little crunch in the cabbage!

This is delicious and easy to make. I really enjoyed it! My only suggestion is to add some fresh ginger root when adding the garlic. It adds the perfect Asian flavor to the dish. Thanks for the recipe!

Pretty good! I tried to stay true to the written recipe. Only change is using beef broth instead of water with the corn starch. And ...a dash of hot pepper flakes. Perfect dish served over brown rice.

Very good. Nothing too exciting, but tasty, easily made meal that all 4 of us(me, husband, 2 randomly picky teen girls)  enjoyed. Definitely will put this into rotation.

My husband and I (and my sister) loved this recipes!  Thankfully I doubled the recipe-- and added  just a few shredded carrots to make it go farther, because I could have eaten the whole pan by myself!  We kept saying, as we were taking delicious, mouth watering  bites, how good it was!  The recipe is perfect as is, but we like the Mae Ploy Sweet Chili Sauce so my husband talked me into trying a little.  I drizzled it on a little section of my serving, and because we both like the sweet chili sauce so much, it did not disappoint.  It added a 'sweet bite' to it which doubled the excitement my taste buds were already celebrating.    So easy and ingredients I have in my refrigerator often.   You could save prep time by using 2-3 bags of shredded cole slaw mix (cabbage and carrots).  I'm looking forward to making this again because we loved it so much and because we really enjoy Chinese!   I am resisting having the little bit of leftovers for breakfast as I'm typing this comment!  Thank you for posting this oh so yummy recipe!

This was easy and quick, and I had all the ingredients on hand.  I used less garlic, more meat, added sliced onion and more mild peppers (red, green, yellow and orange) for color.  The salt is definitely needed as the taste was understated.  I omitted the cornstarch thickener as that was unnecessary.  A good, simple recipe for a satisfying meal served with rice.

I like the idea of ground beef and cabbage in a stir fry, but it does need to be punched up for more flavor.  It needs more vegetables ... maybe carrots, onions, additional bell peppers ... and more seasoning, such as ginger and chili paste.  Definitely use beef broth instead of the water called for.  We also added more soy sauce at the table, which helped.  But we liked it enough to try it again with some changes.

The whole family liked this recipe. Will definitely make it again. Some changes we made were using a coleslaw mix instead of the cabbage head for easier prep. As well as using cocoamino instead of soy sauce.  I served it with cauliflower rice for a low carb dinner, and even the kids ate it up.

I made this according to the recipe except that I added some onion. it was ok, but lacked flavor.  Next time, I would add some spices, maybe ginger and red pepper flakes. Also, as some reviewers mentioned,  I would probably use beef strips, although the ground beef was easy. I'd give this 3.5 stars if I could.

Made as written this recipe is bland. Quick yes ,however, the ground beef in a stir fry did not mess well. I loved the cabbage in this recipe! Mixed with a flank steak, onions and ginger or something this could be excellent.

This is a fast and simple dinner! 
I doubled the recipe since I had 1 lb of ground beef.
I omitted the oil as I used a non stick pan.
I had a bunch of vegetables to use up, I used onions, carrots, celery, green pepper, mushrooms and cabbage.
For the sauce I used light soya sauce, brown sugar, cornstarch, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, minced garlic, sesame oil and water.
We ate the stirfry with rice and added Sambal Oleck for an extra kick .

Followed many of the top reviews' recommendations (beef broth instead of water, sesame oil, onion, red AND yellow bell pepper) and I also cooked the beef with some mirin and added green pepper for garnish. It still felt rather bland. One recommendation I did not follow was to add some salt; I think I would do that, and also add ginger next time to see if it is better.

This is quick and easy but I wish I had read the reviews and used beef brother instead of water. It was just a little bland. Of course I didn't add salt. That would probably make a difference but I'm on a low sodium diet. I did use a bit of sesame oil and I used ground sirloin. I think I will play with this recipe some more and probably add some more veggies and maybe some nuts.

This recipe is good however I had to double it. My adjustment was definitely related to salt. For some reason, it was lacking it so I adjusted salt and soy sauce to my taste. As an overall, the recipe reminded me of a childhood food I used to eat. I was pleasantly surprised as I have not tasted the flavors in ages! I will try it as others suggest with strips of beef. I boiled rice to add as a side but I think soba noodles would also be great with it!

I made this for dinner earlier tonight. I used around 1 lb of lean ground beef, which I seasoned with salt and pepper prior to browning. I cooked the veggies for 5 minutes. My tolerance for hot/spicy foods isn't high, therefore I decreased the ground black pepper to 3/4 teaspoon. I served it over steamed white rice. My hubby and I enjoyed it!

Surprisingly good and extremely simple! I was looking for a quick recipe to use up some cabbage in the fridge. I agree with others that it needs a bit of depth to heighten the flavors (although I did leave out the garlic) - half an onion with the veggies and some sesame oil should do the trick. I will make this again.

I have made this several times and have found it to be VERY bland as written and still so, even after adding onion & using beef broth & some sesame oil as some reviewers have suggested. I like that it is low carb & healthy so will keep working with it awhile longer. Next time will add ginger , chili flakes, and additional veggies.

This was just okay...totally edible, but not outstanding.  I made two slight changes and that is to add just a few flakes of red pepper and reduced the black pepper from 1 teaspoon to about 1/2 teaspoon and used pulled chicken instead of beef.  Maybe the beef would've been better, but I wanted to use chicken because I had already thawed it.  I had made a Leeann Chin recipe years ago with cabbage that sounded similar but this wasn't close enough).  So, I ordered the Leeann Chin cookbook so I could get the recipe.  Don't think I would make this again...even if I did use chicken instead of beef....don't think that would have made that big of a difference.  It could have used a touch of fish sauce to really increase the flavor.

This a good recipe to follow then you can add in all your extra favorites.  I used thin cut beef sirloin and added mushrooms.  I also marinated the meat in a little Worcestershire and soy suace and hot oil (we like spicy)

So mixed about how I feel about this recipe. First of all I used strips of beef and chicken. I bought the precut ones from the meat section. I followed the rest of the recipe as is.  I did add montreal steak seasoning and some chili sauce. It would have been bland without it. If I make it again, I will use beef broth instead of water. My sauce never thickened. Not sure why. My child thought the dish looked unappetizing and refused to eat it. Hence he went to bed hungry. One person in the house loved it. The others thought it was okay. I think its a good base stir fry recipe. Just needs more flavor and less sauce.

Sauté 1/2 chopped onion first, before adding the garlic.  Half the soy sauce.  I also used peanut oil because I had it on hand. With the changes, it was 5 stars!

I used the ingredient search to find this recipe. I'm cleaning out my pantry and freezer and needed to use up a bag of stir fry vegetables. I followed this recipe using the bag of stir fry veggies and omitting the cabbage (didn't have any). I also had a baggie of cooked rice in the freezer and added it in with everything else. Really good. I would make this again using the cabbage. We enjoyed it.

I made this with beef strips instead of ground beef.  First I sauteed onion, celery, and zucchini in some oil.  Added the beef to cook.  I added the cabbage and bell peppers last to keep some crunch.  im glad that i made the sauce separately so i could thicken it up and then add as much or little as i wanted (it is very salty)!  Added little at a time to the veggies and beef and stirred, until it was to my taste.  Great!  Carrots and other veggies would be good too!

6-12-2016  ~had a two-fold mission tonight.  First, since I’m heading out of town again in a couple of days it’s time to use up the produce I have in the fridge  - and I wanted a meal that was low carb.  (It’s time to knock back on them for awhile!)  This is what I came up with.  Skip the rice and you’ve got a healthy meal, with lots of protein and a minimal amount of carbohydrates.  I had intended to use the ground beef called for, but when I spotted a couple of No Name steaks in the freezer I just couldn’t pass them up and used them instead, sliced real thin.   I wasn’t too enthused, I must say.  Yay, a cabbage dinner – but it fit my needs for tonight.  I thought it would be lacking in flavor.  Wrong.  I thought it would be too peppery, and overly salty too with all that soy sauce.  Wrong.  I thought it would be just plain boring, especially since I would not be enjoying it with rice.  Wrong again.   Given its simplicity, this was fairly lively in flavor and, while I would have preferred it over some rice, it was still quite satisfying.

I did follow some other reviewers and add/modify this a bit. First of all, i used beef strips instead of ground. Then I marinated them in a soy sauce/sesame oil/Worcestershire mixture as I was preparing the other ingredients. This added a lot more flavour and tenderized the meat. I also used beef broth instead of water and at the end added green onions. My family really loved it! I'll make this again for sure. Oh and I added a lot more black pepper!

We used one pound of ground beef, left the cabbage the same, one and a half red peppers, a small, thinly sliced onion, and doubled the sauce.  I think some broccoli and/or other veggies would be good additions, as well as a little more soy sauce.  We also got the beef browning first, so didn't need the oil.  Very enjoyable over rice.

Good basic recipe, but a bland. I would recommend following the advice of "judiesdream" and add flavor with beef broth, salt, and seasonings.

Really like this.  Sometimes I add mushrooms.  And to make it very simple, I use cold slaw instead of a head of cabbage.   Also, I add more soy to taste.

This recipe should be moved to the low calorie category.  It is lite fare and lightly filling. (I used 93% ground beef.) The carb count is even low minus the rice.  I served it with a name brand classic chinese cooking sauce as a condiment for whoever wanted it and that seemed to give the needed taste. Would make again because of the nutritional value and ease of preparation. Additionally, some felt steak strips would have been better. I didn't mind the ground beef.

Made this tonight for supper and OMG I could have eaten the entire thing myself!  I used 1 lb. of ground beef because that's what I had defrosted and truthfully I think it was better that way.  I didn't measure the soy sauce, I just poured in what I wanted.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  Quick and easy to put together and super delicious!  Next time I won't bother adding the cornstach and water. PS:  one time I had no red pepper so swapped it for shredded carrot and it was just as delicious ??

PS:  Made this without the meat and it’s equally delicious!

Very quick, and it was tasty for how easy it was! But I think it's pretty bland, and it would look less pre-chewed with beef strips instead of ground beef. After taste-testing, I added some vinegar. An onion helped, too.

I'm always looking for ways to get veggies in the family dinner that everyone will like. Husband, kids and I all enjoyed this so much! I had a head of cabbage to use and saw this and went for it. I followed some suggestions I read like adding a tsp of sesame oil at the beginning and adding an onion with the ground beef. I didn't have any peppers and didn't want to go to the store. But all cabbage was wonderful. I also used beef broth instead of water. Thank you for the new recipe!

Even my picky nine year old liked this! I made a few adjustments for our tastes. I used sesame oil, cut up sirlion steaks into strips, chopped up 3 or four scallions and added a can of water chestnuts. I also doubled the sauce since I accidentally added a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce when I started. I was worried that I had ruined it but i would absolutely do it again! I think my total cook time was closer to 25 mins total.

Very good. I added onion and green beans. Also I cut the recipe in half (we're empty nesters) but there's still lots left for a second meal. With just 1/4 cup water, I added 2 tsp. corn starch and it was still not quite thick enough even with very lean ground beef.  I will most probably make this again.

This was very good, plus it was fun to make.  I did add a half an onion thinly sliced, 1 carrot thinly sliced, 3 slices bacon chopped and fried till crisp and added it to the lot.  I did charge it up with about a TBS of the Red Chili Oil and a pinch of Red Pepper Flakes, we tend to like spice.
Thanks for the idea for an easy no fuss meal.

I really liked this. It is sort of a quasi American-Asian dish sort of like chop suey. I made a few changes based on recommendations of someone else that made this. I spritzed a pan with oil and halfway browned the 96% lean hamburger at temp 6.5 Then added a sliced onion, and about a Tblsp of sesame oil, and the garlic and 3/4 of a tsp of black pepper. It was a little peppery, so I may further reduce it to 1/2 tsp. next time. After the onions were softened I added the cabbage and red bell pepper then turned the temp to 3.5 and covered with a lid. It took no less than 20 minutes stirring about every 5 minutes to soften the cabbage and red pepper. I used low sodium soy sauce and added 1 tsp beef paste to the water before mixing both in. ty

We used roasted red peppers, but I could have easily had more veggies. We also doubled the recipe, the servings were pretty small before we doubled it.

Really like the flavor.  Substituted ground turkey for beef to cut calories., so added a little more pepper.  The liquid never thickened but I thought no it was due to the fact ours was old. Will replace it and try again.

Doubled the recipe. It was delicious. Took longer than '5 mins' cooking time, but still very simple and tasty. I added a T of honey and red pepper flakes for more of a kick.

Thank you for a delicious recipe! I will definitely make it again! I did use chicken, but ultimately the same. One time, I had some left over brown sugar, bacon and apple chicken ( a recipe I found on another website) so I just shredded the chicken and added just a touch of the Apple liquid and it was great! I could use any type of meat for this recipe because it is so versatile. It's made me fall in love all over again with Stir- Fry!

I made it exactly and it was just average, nothing special and pretty bland. It could be better with using beef broth vs water, red pepper flakes, onion, however, as is, 3 stars.

This was very good and fast to put together.  One thing I did differently was to use packaged cole slaw mix for the cabbage.  Also added a few mushrooms.

Followed other suggestions to use stock rather then water, which I believe definitely made it better then it would have been.  Even with some other adjustments, some onion and hot pepper (we like spicy), hubby and I thought it was just ok, not a keeper, but worth a try.

This was pretty tasty, but certainly did not blow me away. I borrowed from several other reviewers' suggestions and used beef broth in place of the water and I drizzled sesame oil over the bowls at the end. Served with hot jasmine rice. Quick, easy and cheap!

Easy and quick recipe, but the flavor was so-so.  Perhaps too much soy sauce.  I probably won't make it again.

Great recipe, enjoyed by all. Followed recipe but increased pepper and added a thinly sliced onion.  Will say it does need a dash of salt even with the soy sauce, but was delishes. Oh, and used the whole small head of cabbage which i shredded in my food processor.

Used ground turkey and replaced 1/2 the water with beef stock to make it more "beefy".  Used 3 cups of cabbage/broccoli slaw.  Cooked the veggies tender crisp.  Excellent flavour and easy to prepare.  Changes were because of dietary needs.  More slaw next time.

Was good , but it lacked a sweetness. I added mirin [sweet japanese rice wine]  but u could add a little  honey , agave, pomogranite molassis., or a splash of orange liquor to make it amazing.

Didn't have any rd bell pepper, so I tossed in some shredded carrots - wonderful!  Just like it said, I had to keep my family from eating it out of the wok before it was served!  Even my VERY picky 9-yr old daughter loved it!  One extra thing I added to the rice was a 1/2 tablespoon of Kikkoman's rice seasoning - Perfecto!

I have been making  recipe for over fifty years. Back when you could buy hamburger for 5 pounds for a dollar. Cheap to feed the kids and my wife and I. Just make sure you rinse the hamburger in HOT water prior to adding to cabbage. The more extra veggies added, the further it goes. Now I add some roasted sesame oil. Not much, maybe a tsp. Depends on how much you are making. Very versatile dish.

I really liked this recipe.  The only change I made was I substituted the beef with ground turkey.  It was really easy to make.  I served it in a pita pocket.  Really good I will make it again with no additional changes!

I made this recipe first time yesterday and let me just say it was delicious and a hit with my family. I did not follow exact direction/ingredients I used garlic salt in place of garlic cloves and did not use corn starch or water. I made my rice as I would make mexican rice (brown,add water cover at high simmer). I added a twist to this meal by taking a piece if lettuce romaine heart filling it and eating like a lettuce wrap. It was sooooooo good.

If you've got hamburger to use up and you're in the mood for stir fry this will work. If you're looking for more of an Asian flavor add a little hoisin sauce or oyster sauce (which also has a lot of salt). Adding thick sliced onion to the veggies adds great flavor too. A lot of different left over fresh veggies could be thrown in here...onion, celery, thinly sliced carrot, bok choy instead of reg cabbage...whatever you've got to use up.  

As the recipe stands it's tasty but just not big on Asian flavor. Oh...I drained off some of the hamburger fat that clogs your arteries too before I added the veggies. Most hamburger is at least 20% fat.

If you're looking for a quick and tasty meal, this is it! I was pleasantly surprised by how delicious this was, and my husband has deemed it regular-rotation-worthy. I made the following tweaks, in case this inspires anyone: Used black garlic instead of white garlic (gives it a sweet smoky kick), added two teaspoons of vinegar for a little bit more acidity, and added some oyster sauce as well as soy sauce. We absolutely loved the cabbage and pepper, it almost tasted like a  hamburger stir fry somehow. Thanks for sharing!

I have looked at this recipe several times and was a little unsure whether or not to make it but decided finally to give it a try tonight. I had to double the recipe for my big family.  I did make some changes for flavoring based on some other reviews. I fried the ground beef with 2 cloves of minced garlic, salt and onion powder before removing from the pan, I discarded some of the oil from the ground beef but saved the remaining to fry the cabbage in.  I also added, shredded carrots, sliced red onion and I only had frozen cut up green pepper so I used that too.  After the veggies were tender crisp I put the ground beef back in the pot along with the soy sauce.  To make the sauce better I used one cup of beef broth, 1 big teaspoon of beef bouillon and 2 teaspoons of cornstarch mixed together. This mixture made a good sauce the thickened up nicely and gave it loads of flavor.  Great basic recipe that can be adapted to fit what you have on hand. This will go in my regular rotation as the whole family loved it.

I ended up using thinly sliced beef cubes rather than ground beef; half the amount of bell pepper; some red cabbage rather than green; and some crushed red pepper flakes for a bit of added flavour. This was ready in 20 minutes as stated and tasted great! Definitely looking forward to making this again.

I used angus beef cut into strips instead of brown beef. I doubled the recipe except the cabbage and added half an onion and a whole green and yellow bell pepper. Also added a bullion cube to the water. This is so yummy.

I was hesitant when I made this recipe for my 10 year old daughter--she isn't picky but...cabbage?  She took a bite, said "this is great" and tucked into a huge portion.  She then came back for seconds and took it to school in a thermos the next day.  A true success.  I did add some minced ginger to the meat and some scallions to the vegetables, to enhance the Asian feel, but nothing else was needed. Really good stuff.

Last night I made this for my family. My youngest son who's 14 yr old is a picky eater and  was floored when he asked for more. I did substitute beef broth for water. Turned out awesome my wife was shocked that I could cook something so quick and turn out tasting so good.

I used stir-fry strips of beef since I had that on hand and added concentrated beef stock for a little added flavor. I also added a little sesame oil with the vegetable oil. I will make this again & again. The hubby LOVED it.

I've made this several times now and it's a new family favorite.  I use a pound of beef and a whole cabbage for four people.  I make it even simpler by omitting the bell pepper and not thickening the sauce.  Also, I put the lid on for a while to let the cabbage cook down and soften.

Wow...so good!  I just made this tonight and hubby and I loved it.  I heated the oil with red pepper flakes (lots for heat) added grated carrots and a little bit of hoisin sauce (homemade).  I also added a beef bullion cube to the water before adding the corn starch.  I served these over plain romaine noodles and they knocked our socks off!  Thank you so much for the recipe....I may be able to cook afterall.  :-)

Great recipe.  I used sesame oil and thin sirloin steak cut into strips.  At the table each person added more pepper and soy sauce to taste.  We served it over rice.  Everyone loved it.

I have to be honest, I didn't notice that this was a ground beef recipe until I read a 3 star review of it.  I used strips of beef precut for stir fry at the grocery store, and was sadly out of red pepper. I also live with someone who has some very strict requirements sodium-wise in her diet.  That means that this had too much soy sauce for me to safely prepare, and I had to substitute worcestershire sauce instead.  It was really fantastic, and I don't even like cabbage!  I used bok choy.

This was okay. I think it would have been good if I had listened to some of the other reviews. Ground beef just doesn't work as a stir fry. Steak would have been better.  It needed more flavor.

Great... I doubled the recipe, instead of ground beef, I used venison in thin strips,added bean sprouts, onions, a bit more soy, beef boullion and a splash of sesame oil. Surprisingly good. Will make again, thanks.

A very easy and affordable dish! Can be kind of on the spicy side for those who are not used to a lot of black pepper so adjust seasoning to own taste. Served this over white rice and a side of egg rolls.

This is good even without the peppers.  I didn't have any peppers at home so I made the recipe without them.  Added a dash of garlic salt and onion salt.  At the end I added ramen noodles and added a little more water.  The end result is great.

This dish was really, really good!  I doubled the soy sauce, water and cornstarch (my family likes it saucy!).  Next time, and there will be many!, I think I'll mix the rice into it before serving.  Thanks!

This was very tasty.  I did make a couple of changes per the advice of other readers. I did add some Hoisin and some Sesame Oil.   This was excellent. My Fiance devoured it.  I think I will try it with pork. mmmmmmmmmmmm

I LOVE this recipe!! My husband who is a picky eater even likes it. We like it so much that I fix it nearly once a week for dinner.
We're not huge garlic fans so I cut way back on the garlic. I also add green onions sliced in about 1 inch pieces.
This recipe is so easy too.

Excellent dish!  Made it with ground venison and followed other reviewers advice; included season salt, sesame oil, ginger, green onion. Served over rice. It was delish! For those who have venison, great dish that will "hide" the game flavor. Thanks for sharing, will make again.

I thought it was a bit greasy so I'll work on that next time, but my husband loved it and keeps begging me to make it again.  So filling with all the cabbage, you don't even have to serve it with rice!

This didn't go over too well with the men in the family...maybe because of its presentation? I would suggest cutting the cabbage in larger chunks, and adding some more spices, as it was pretty bland.

This was okay. I have never seen ground beef in a stir-fry before, and it definitely wasn't my favorite. I think I would like it a lot more if the meat was seasoned and there were twice the amount of vegetables. We ended up adding some salt, sesame oil, and hot chili sauce to give it some more flavor.

I don't know why I never thought to put cabbage in stir fry before--thanks for the great idea!  I resisted the urge to change the recipe too much the first time, however I did double the soy sauce.  I will be making this again and again with different additions - like onions - until I perfect it.

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this.  I needed a quick supper and had everything in the fridge.  I cooked the ground beef and chopped the veggies while the rice was cooking.  I had a small zucchini in the fridge so I sliced 1/2 of it up and threw it in.  Next time I'll double the recipe and add onion, celery and thinly sliced carrot.  The cabbage really added a lot to the flavour of this dish.

We love this recipe! The first time we made it I was very surprised by how good the flavor was. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because the 2 Tbsp of oil called for is way too much in my opinion. I usually make the dish with about 1 teaspoon of oil and it comes out great. Tasty, cheap, and quick-- what more could you ask for?

I read the mixed reviews, and was determined for mine to come out tasty! Instead of veg. oil, I used chile oil, which did give it some heat. I also put a little onion powder and garlic salt on the meat. I added chopped onion and mushroom. Instead of water I used beef broth. I served over brown rice. And it STILL needed soy sauce once at the table. I probably wont make this again. If I do it would be because it is healthy, not because it was that great. And I would serve oer noodles. The ground beef over rice was too much of the same texture.

This is one of my husbands staple recipes. He follows the recipe to the letter (as men do) and it is delicious. If you are looking for a sweet stir fry flavor than this is not a good one to try. This is spicy and savoury dish. Love it!

Great recipe - something different to throw into the rotation!  Quick and easy, made with ground turkey, added a can of sliced mushrooms, and threw in a bit extra pepper for some kick.  Will for sure make again.  Thanks for sharing!

I personally loved this recipe - except that there was WAY to much pepper for my husband and kids. I also didn't have a bell pepper, so I used celery and it was great!

Really good.  We both loved it.  Added our own vegetables.  A bag of cole slaw mix saved time over shredding the cabbage, broccoli, mushrooms and water chestnuts and one thinly sliced onion.

I was unsure about using ground beef in a stir fry, but was generally pleased with this recipe.  Following a few suggestions, I added onion, substituted beef broth for the water, added salt to taste (it actually need quite a bit, and we're not big salt fans) and I added 2 TBSP of sweet chili sauce.  It had a good flavor, but honestly was still a bit weak.  Maybe next time I will try browning the beef in a seasoned oil.  I served it over brown rice that I cooked in beef broth.  I will make this again.

I made this for my hubby last night and it was a hit.  Like others suggested, I doubled the recipe and it made a ton of food.  Also, I used a combination of teriyaki sauce and worshetire sauce because I was out of soy sauce and it worked great!  It did take a lot longer than the recipe suggested for the cabbage to tender up (closer to 30-40 minutes).  I will definitely make this again.

This was good.  I used a little sesame oil with it.  I've never used ground beef in a stir-fry before, but it was actually good!

This was nice with rice but we found it a bit bland - next time I'll try putting some spices or something in.  By the way, why 'black' pepper in the title?

I was excited about this recipe because I love cabbage in chinese, others had rated it so highly, and because of how versitle it is when it comes to veggies you can add, but I was really disappointed.  I headed the advice of others and added more spices - onion powder and ginger - to the meat as it cooked.  I replaced the water with beef broth, and added mushrooms and water chestnuts.  For the cabbage, I used a bag of cole slaw, with carrot.  When I tried it just before serving over rice, I discovered the sauce was definitely lacking.  Adding teriyaki helped, but it wasn't enough to save it.

I've made this recipe over and over - always on a regular skillet, with cabbage or with lettuce it's YUM! (though the cabbage does cook better!) My anti-veggie picky husband LoVeS it as well. thanks Pearlie!

Heeded others advice and added mushrooms, garlic, scallions. Quick, but nothing special.

Simple fun and yummy.  I substituted the ground beef with ground turkey seasoned with pepper, seasoned salt, and basil. We enjoyed a great deal.  We served over hot rice...really good.

Wow was this easy and good. This will be one of my regular recipes.  I used peanut oil to stirfry, and added onions and seasoned salt.  I think that I will increase the cornstarch to 1 Tablespoon next time.  So delicious!
