Delicious. It was a big hit at the family fall reunion. Even the people who drink very little enjoyed this. The recipe was copied many times.

Fabulous- this is Fall in a glass!!  I didnâ€™t have vanilla vodka so I used regular vodka with a little vanilla Torani syrup.  This legitimately tastes EXACTLY like apple pie!!!  This one is a keeper!
