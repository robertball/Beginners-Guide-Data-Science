good and refreshing.
second time I mashed small can of peaches in lite syrup with 1 cup of peach schnapps and 1/4 cup of pear vodka, then added 2-3 sliced fresh peaches, some basil leaves torn into small pieces, and one thinly sliced lime and 2 mandarins. This marinated for a day. At serving time I added one bottle of Pinot Grigio and one bottle of sparkling peach wine, plenty of ice, and a few large basil leaves to each glass.

I love this recipe!  Light, easy, and I can use the basil from my garden!  I've made it twice now, and haven't used agave nectar or even sugar, and we just drink it right up.  :)

Absolutely delicious and a huge hit at the bridal shower!   We used a bit more peach schnapps (can also use peach liquor), but omitted the agave.  Portion is one full bottle of schnapps to four magnum bottles of wine.   We marinated only the sliced peaches and chopped basil in the schnapps overnight (to save space in the fridge) and then added the wine the next morning.

I thought this was just ok. The basil is very subtle. I guess I just donâ€™t care for Schnapps. Thank you for the recipe.

Awesome recipe...Everyone loved it!  I added club soda and a little triple sec, and used sugar instead of agave nectar since i didn't have any and it turned out perfect!
