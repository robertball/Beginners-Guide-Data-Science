This was excellent! I used the dressing to whip up some buffalo ranch sauce!! Used dried dill versus fresh dill, 1/4 tsp. Also used dried parsley -- 1/4 Tbsp. And, minced that celery very small so the dressing was not too chunky. I'm positive the flavors will meld over the next few days, but at first taste, yum!
