I have a recipe very similar that I make for Thanksgiving. I LOVE how quick and easy it is to make. Here is what I do differently: 4 Tbsp butter, 1 pkg refrigerater biscuits, 2 gloves finely chopped garlic, 1 tbsp parsley, 1 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp thyme, 2 tbsp grated parmesan, 1 tbsp sesame seeds. Also - you can prepare this several hours prior, store in frig. Bring to room temp fore baking.

I agree with other reviews that this calls for too much butter!  I used 3T and it was plenty!  We loved the flavor of parsley, dill, & onion (& 1/2 tsp garlic powder added) in these fun little savory bites.  To make this simple, I put the dried seasonings in a ziploc bag, then threw in the biscuit pieces & tossed them around to coat.  Then I put them in the pan & poured the melted butter evenly over the tops.  Worked out great!  Thanks for this easy & quick recipe!  Will use it again for sure!  :)

it's very rare that i find myself frustrated that 5 stars is the highest i can rate a recipe. if i could i would give this recipe 10. it was amazing! i did everything as follows but added grated and shredded parmesan cheese to the top. oh so yummy. i served this with the quick and easy chicken noodle soup from this site. oh and i highly recommend not taking out the dill. it makes it sooo much better. i added garlic powder as well.

Excellent! I made mine in muffin tins--3 dough balls per muffin cup--and they were great and so easy to make. I used Pillsbury Buttermilk Grands, italian seasoning, garlic and onion powder.  My husband loved them. Very tasty!!

These were really good! I had a can of Grands biscuits that needed to be used and decided to try this recipe. Made as directed except I added about 3/4 teaspoon of garlic powder to the butter mixture and topped with parmesan cheese before baking. These were buttery good! Thanks for posting. :)

This is a great recipe...a real time-saver when you want something more than plain old biscuits. I reduced the amount of butter and sustituted italian seasoning for the dill, since I'm not a dill fan. Any seasoning mix would work well for this.

These were good and went fast, but personally I would have liked something a little crunchier.  I scaled the butter back to 4 tbsp and substituted the dill/parsley for a healthy shake of Italian seasoning blend.  I also added some garlic powder and minced garlic, with a dash of parmasean cheese over all.  I baked mine according to package directions and used 2 cans of biscuit dough in 2 cake pans (doubling the entire butter/herb mixture)...and still had nothing left.

We really love these. Had some biscuits in the fridg that needed to be used, and this was perfect. I only used 4 Tbsp. of butter, added garlic powder, and I used 1/4 tsp dried thyme instead of dill. I also added a little salt. Cut each biscuit into quarters and used a muffin tin, I like that each bite was a little crunchy :) Delish! Thanks for posting this BRENDATX

While mixing the butter I eliminated the dillweed and added dried parsley, basil and oregano.   I then realized I didn't have biscuits but pizza dough in fridge!  So, I quickly whipped up J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits and brushed on top and sides before baking.  AWESOME!!  Will definitely  make this herb butter again.

These were RIICH!! But so, so good...and so, so sinful! I didn't use the dried onion because I didn't have any - I felt like it could use some salt or something. Next time I might try some garlic salt. It's best to let these cool off a bit before trying to take them out of the pan (I did these in a muffin tin, by the way....4 pieces per tin) otherwise they don't stick together in biscuit form, they just come out in four small pieces. But if you let them cool a bit, they come out as one nice, uniform biscuit. I had some butter/herb mixture left after I rolled all of the dough in it, so after baking for 12 minutes, I used a basting brush to brush the remaining butter over the top of the biscuits to keep them from getting too dry. I baked an additional 3 minutes after that and they came out just perfect!

This is such a great way to spruce up regular biscuits. So good!
Now whenever I heat up a can of corn I put melted butter and dill in and the corn is 10x better!
Little touches like that make the dish taste so much better.

Fantastic!  I was so sick of frozen garlic bread and the soggy leftovers.  This is absolutely perfect for four servings.  The only thing I tweaked was the seasoning, the amount of butter and bake time/temp were perfect.  Delicate crust outside, tender and moist on the inside.  Love this and have already addded it to my favorites. Make this and it will get gone!  Thank you for the great recipe!

My family loved these! I used only half the butter called for and just drizzled it over the biscuits in the pan. They were plenty buttery!

Good biscuit.  I used onion powder instead of flakes.  I agree.  You can use any spices.  Make it italian, mexican, ect... I will make this again when I want easy biscuits.

Loved the idea of this, my son loves refig. bisquits so i always have them on hand. But mine did not cook well in the middle so i tried them again in 2  pans and for me came out much better. Also did one with Italian seasoning and Parm cheese. Thanks for easy and tasty idea.

Well good grief, why didn't I think of this sooner.  I did add a little garlic powder, just seemed natural.  I added 3 of the chunks to a muffin tin, and the remaining biscuit I cut even smaller and added another piece to the tins, as far as it would go.  My thinking behind using the muffin tins, is that it would be easier to freeze and thaw out as needed, although I am not so sure there will be any left to freeze.  Thank you fo being so creative and for sharing with us.

These were so delicious.  I did change the herbs as I wanted these to eat with an Italian dinner.  I used Italian Seasoning, garlic powder, Parmesan and dried onion.  I did reduce the butter to just 4 tablespoons.  S simple, quick to make and taste delicious.  A perfect combination!

These are easy and went great with the beef stew we paired them with.  Less butter would be better.  I added garlic powder to the recipe and sprinkled the top with parmesan as others have directed.  It turned a boring, yucky product (canned biscuits) to fun and delicious.  To make them look pretty, I placed groups of 4 quarters into a muffin pan and reduced bake time by 2-3 minutes.  They look, smell, and taste delicious.

While I like the type of herbs that this recipe called for, I don't think it was enough to really do the recipe justice. After following this recipe to a T, the smell had a very wonderfully aromatic scent in the air but I barely could taste the flavors that baked into the biscuits above the biscuits over all orginal taste. It really tasted like a cooked buttered biscuit. This recipe could really use some hmph in flavors, oregano, garlic and parmesan possibly added to it.

I have made these several times and they are great!  I've used different groups of herbs, but they have all turned out wonderful.  Everyone loves them.  No one can believe how simple these are.  I use about 3/4 of a stick of butter, and that is perfect.  I cook them in a glass 8" square pan so I can see their progress.  Always delish!!!

I went to a friend’s house for dinner just before Christmas and she made these, she added the cheese, they were delicious.  I've done them as a breakfast treat, cutting the biscuits the same way adding 3 tbs of melted butter, cinnamon and sugar.  What a treat, they were really wonderul, and flew off the plate. Jay

When you consider that there are only 5 ingredients in this dish, and it is not home-made dough I have to say it is pretty good. It's just something different than plain biscuits. I thought there was a little too much butter though and ended up using about 1/2 the amount and I still felt that was more than enough.

Don't be afraid to go heavy on the herbs - very good biscuits...basic with just a little smidgen of something special.

These were good, altho I wish I had added garlic. They were a tad bland. Also, after the 12 min, the middle was still gooey so I had to pull it all apart & bake another 5 min.

These are soooo good! After reading the reviews, I reduced the butter to 1/3 cup and that was perfect. The 8" round cake pan I used worked fine but it was a very tight fit because I had purchased "Grands" size biscuits. I was a little concerned about the exterior biscuits being done before the middle. I added 2 min to the bake time and they were nicely browned on the outside and done in the middle. So easy and fast with excellent results. We will use this recipe often. Thanks for sharing!

One of my most favorite quick bread recipes. I use the reduced fat biscuits, half the butter and sometimes, I'll use a homemade italian dressing mix or ranch dressing mix to really kick the flavor up a notch. This is THE BEST with a hearty soup, like a good thick potato or beef stew.

This is pretty good.  I just made it for the first time, but I used garlic and onion powder.  The thing I would do different is that I would pour the extra butter mixture over the bicuits AFTER they come out of the oven so the flavor might get further into the bread.  Of course, that may make it too soggy...

Well, I can see that I’m in the minority on this one.  I followed the recipe, but did cut back on the butter by half as suggested by a number of other reviewers.  I didn’t have dried minced onion so I used some onion powder and I added a little garlic powder.  I had to bake mine quite a bit longer, because after 12 minutes they didn’t appear to be done at all.  And the end result wasn’t nearly as pretty as some of the photos.  Sorry, but I think I’ll keep looking.

The bomb!! I will make these again and again!! I added 1/4 tsp basil and 1/4 tsp garlic powder to the butter mixture. I used less butter than called for as well and herb biscuits were still buttery-delish! Thank you for a superb recipe!

I didn't have any biscuit dough handy, so I used the bread sticks dough I had. I also skipped the dill weed since I didn't have any. They turned out to be okay. I think I will make them again next time with the dill weed!

I thoroughly enjoyed these.  It's like buttering your biscuits without having to actually butter them.  And the pieces are bite sized too which makes them convenient.  Only thing is I found out I'm not a big fan of the dill weed taste.  Next time I'll make this with parsley and granulated garlic or something else that fits my taste better.

Hubby loved these.  I used Grands the first time, second time the flaky, layer-y version... used to be called Hungry Jacks.  I preferred the latter.  I used soy butter instead of regular and probably on a 1/3 of the butter dictated by the recipe.  I also only made the 1/2 can size of biscuits.  Definitely making this for my x-mas guests.

Wonderful, easy and adaptable! Mix and match herbs as suited to the meal. I make this all the time. My local grocery store puts the smaller biscuits on sale for .50 cents a tube all the time and I stock up. Can't buy garlic bread or dinner rolls cheaper!

This was really, really yummy. My boyfriend and I ate the whole pan in one night! I followed the direction of other cooks and added a few more spices. I added a 1/2 teaspoon of Italian seasoning, 1/2 Basil and 1 teaspoon of Garlic powder. Delicious!

I loved that this was so quick and easy and added a nice touch to an otherwise boring dinner tonight.  I added garlic powder and basil to the butter.  The biscuit pieces pull apart easily after baking and I thought this would be great using these bread pieces on the side with a spinach dip instead of the usual bread bowl with dip.   Thanks for sharing!

Yum! I made this as written, except for using Grands biscuits and fresh parsley. These are definitely guilty pleasure food all around. I would cut down on the butter next time because it was a little over the top - even for pleasure eating - but I loved the generous use of dill weed in this. Thanks for the recipe!

After reading the reviews I wasn't quite sure I wanted to use so much dill so I followed the proportions of spices from the "Savory Biscuits" recipe on this site.  There was A LOT of herbs on every bite but it wasn't over powering; the taste was amazing.  I used a 9" cake pan and it was too big for every piece to touch but they still cooked up perfectly.

Good base recipe. You can use butter, soy margarine, regular margarine depending on your taste/diet. Herbs you prefer(using chopped fresh garlic tonight) or how about cinnamon sugar for breakfast.

Super tasty. I didn't have parsley on hand so I used Italian seasoning. I did take a persons advice, cut down on the butter to 3 tbls. And poured the butter over the biscuits after I tossed them in a plastic bag with spices. Thank You for Sharing. A Keeper.

This is a 'fun' recipe, especially for kids on spaghetti night. They are bite size and very tasty, but be easy on the butter and bake a little longer because I ended up with a soggy, buttery and doughy bottom but draining it and increasing the cooking time fixed the problem and they were a big hit.

This recipe, was great.. It was a little confusing and the biscuits came out a little small.. They were very flavorful and savory but again a litle too small..

Outstanding - didn't need all of the butter. I added some poppy seeds instead of sesame.

Loveed them I cooked them on the grill when I was cooking mini meat loafs. I try and cook on the grill as much as I can on the grill in the summer. They went faster then the meat loaf.

WOW these were amazing.  The storewas out of the regular size biscuits, so I had to buy grands.  They worked perfect as well.  I had fresh parsley so I used that.  My company loved these.  I will make these regularly.  Try these!

Very easy and delicious.  I used 1/3 cup melted butter just and didn't have the dill weed - will add it the next time. Definitely will make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

These were yummy!  I had to give them 4 stars instead of 5 because they were a little too buttery. (I know, I didn't think it was possible to be too buttery!)  I used a different combo of herbs - parsley, thyme and sage with garlic and onion powder.

YUM! Oh my were these every delicious! I had crescents in the house which I rolled as usual and then just sliced in half. Like others, I did cut back on the butter and added in a goodly amount of garlic powder. Whatever butter was left I simply brushed over the top of the rolls and then sprinkled with parm cheese. Everyone raved and thank you!

I didn't have dill weed, but did have dill seeds. Ummm yeah I learned the hard way that they don't taste the same. They did taste good when I brushed those seeds off though.

This is an awesome recipe and wonderful shortcut, I cut the biscuits in quarters and used a muffin pan for the roll effect, instead of the dill weed, I used rosemary & Italian herbs with minced garlic instead of minced onion. They were perfect ??

This was so easy to get together and a great way to jazz up a canned biscuit.  Based on the suggestions of others, I only used 4 tbsp. of butter and after tasting them I could have only used 3 tbsp. and they would have been fine.

Made it using approx half of the butter and half of the dill (that would have been too much). Also subbed onion powder, was out of the onion flakes. Went great with chicken pot pie soup.

Wow! This was really good. Perfect recipe for a quick addition to dinner. I don't care for dill that much, but I added it and really enjoyed it! Everyone loved it. I am so thankful to have this. You can add anything you enjoy. Thanks for this recipe! (I would have added a photo, but they were gone too quickly. Maybe next time).

I made these over the weekend and I only got 2 bites.  The guys wiped these out and kept raving how good they were.  I made them exactly as posted.    Next time, I will be sure to get several cans of biscuits when I make them.

What a simple recipe that tastes great.  My hubby loves these biscuits!  I've made them quite a few times now and sometimes add a little garlic powder to seasonings.  I also sprinkle with fresh grated parm cheese or cheddar. Delish!

Excellent and easy.  I did not change a thing.  However, next time I will reduce the butter as the bottom of the pan was a little greasy and also use only 1 teaspoon of dried dill weed.

A nice quick addition to our meal. I will say that the 1/2 cup of butter was WAY too much. Next time I will use a 1/4 cup of butter. I think the addition of some salt would have made a big difference. Actually, it did, I ended up sprinkling some salt on after they cooked. I also just cooked according to the package directions.

This seems like such a simple idea, but I never thought of it before.  Like other reviewers, I skipped the dill and added garlic powder.  It was a great addition to our meal and my three extremely picky children loved them.  This will be something I make often with whatever seasonings sound good at the time. Thanks for the recipe and idea!

My MIL introduced me to this recipe. It was a must with my husbands family. They serve it with parmasan chicken. Very yummy and supper easy to make.

Certainly nothing wrong with these, but I think it would be easier to skip the rolling and just dump everything on the biscuits flat in the pan.  (Though being round gives a different visual.)  I also made these exactly as is except for using a bit of onion powder instead of minced (minced I thought would be gross in a biscuit)... there are other similar recipes that I think are better, like the changes others are making, which is just turning this recipe into other recipes.

Pretty good. I skipped the dill and added garlic salt/powder since I was pairing this with chicken Parmesan.
