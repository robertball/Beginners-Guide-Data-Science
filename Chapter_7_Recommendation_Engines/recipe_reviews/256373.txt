Totally amazing. I made it a gluten free version substituting the flour for gluten free flour. I took it to a worksgiving party and everyone loved the unexpected coconut on top of this. I would make this again and agian.

I only made the topping. I had made a similar recipe in the past but it was lost and I couldn’t remember it. My family loved this one so it won’t be hard to find it again.

Wonderful dish. I did add more brown sugar then what Was called for. I don’t believe the family wants to wait till next year for me to make this again.

I made this for Thanksgiving and the sweet potato lovers in my family loved it.  The first change I made was the white sugar.  Instead of 3/4 cup, I used 1/3 cup and it still was too sweet.  The sweet potato portion was not nearly enough to cover a 9 x 12 pan, so I used a 6 x 9.  With the smaller pan, I had lots of topping left over, so I froze it to be used in the next batch.  after a few tweaks, this recipe is a keeper.
