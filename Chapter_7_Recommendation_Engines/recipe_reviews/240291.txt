All of these sauces can be tweaked to suit the individual.  Here's what I did to make it suit my taste:
Make that two tablespoons of chili powder.
Forget the onion an garlic powder, add the real stuff by putting all of the ingredients in a blender plus 3 cloves of garlic, 1/2 onion.  The secret thing to make this sauce even better is to simmer it for at least an hour to bring out the flavor of the fresh onions and garlic.

A great tasting sauce without having a prominent vinegar flavor as some major brands do. The sauce wow factor can be changed by adding or subtracting the amount of cayenne. This has a mild spiciness as per ingredients so next time I will double the cayenne. This has a good consistency that will hold well on your tacos or even as a dip.

Really good flavor. I'll never buy taco sauce again !!  Recently went to a friends house where they were having tacos and noticed a "Honey Chipotle" name brand sauce, came home tweaked this recipe . Can not tell the difference between the two.

Really good, made it twice now. I usually only have tomato paste on hand so I add water to get the right consistency and just skip the water listed in the recipe. Also, I've used red wine vinegar and apple cider vinegar because it's all I had and still tastes great.

Excellent flavor, easy to alter so that it isn't too spicy. Much better than store-bought. Thanks.

I was making my standby Burrito Pie from this site, and didn't have any taco sauce. In an effort to avoid going to the store, I came upon this recipe and was thrilled to find out I had everything in my cabinet. This taco sauce was very tasty and we loved the Burrito Pie we made with it. It will be my new go-to taco sauce recipe, and I will never buy storebought again!

I am not a fan of overly processed food, so love having an option for homemade sauces too. This one is soooo good!! Everyone loved it! I have made this one a ton of times, and am always happy with the results.

Terrific Taco Sauce! We like a little more heat to our sauces, so I added a small serrano pepper (seeded) then blended the sauce before the simmering stage. Loved it!

I followed all of the directions, but for some reason, mine had a high tomato flavor.  So it turned out the be a cross between taco sauce and pizza sauce -- which was actually perfect for us this time -- because I made it to use on taco pizza, lol!  I'll do this as is each time I make taco pizza.  But as a straight-up taco sauce, I think I need to tweak the spices a little more.  But overall, I love have this recipe instead of the canned stuff.  Like others have mentioned, it's great having all the ingredients on hand as well!

Very easy to make, but pretty spicy. Be sure to decrease the amount of peppers used if you want a more mild sauce. This sauce gets better after it sits in the refrigerator for an hour or so. Excellent recipe! I will make this again!

Dude, this sauce is delicious. That said, I had a 15oz can of sauce and just added a splash of water, as it seemed it's only duty was to cook out. I simmered a bit longer, maybe a 1/2 hour & then let it cool on the stove for an hour or so. I transferred to a squeeze bottle & refrigerated a few hours. 

The 1/2 tsp of Cayenne gives it a healthy heat, but not "hot" to someone that likes spicy food. If you're not a big fan of the spicy food, reduce it.

I add more some fresh onion and garlic as well as the powders, more chili powder and a little ghost pepper because we like it hot, but this is a great recipe with the flavor of the bottled taco sauce without the corn syrup. I've been making this for a couple of years now.

Never knew you could make your own taco sauce till tonight when we realized we didn't have any.  I had all ingredients on hand-whipped it up in no time.  It was a hair runny for my liking so will reduce the water next time.  It tasted like store bought-probably would be better after 24 hours in the fridge.

Holy cow, I am so glad I Googled this! I am making some bean burritos and I was like "man, I want some chili sauce like a Taco Bueno" and THIS IS IS. I love that you really can adjust to taste, I double the chili powder. Next time I'll prob leave out the sugar and the vinegar cooks down sweet enough for me. Thanks for posting this, it seriously is so easy!

The perfect ingredients to adjust to your liking. I noticed some people called it spicy, I call it less than mild. The flavor is excellent, so heat is easy to adjust to the individuals liking. 

Mixed it, sampled it, and loved it so much I almost missed the cooking step.  I made a half batch. Simmered for 10 minutes. It thickened up very nice.  

To me, this is as good as store bought, and at a fraction of the cost.

Best thing, my family liked it as well. They said it tasted store bought.

This is the first review I've ever written for any Allrecipes recipe and am happy to do so. Made it for the first time today and all I can say is wow! It is fantastic. It's one of those recipes I wish I had found when it first came out because my husband and I use a lot of hot sauce. So simple and yet so flavorful, knocks any store bought hot sauce right off our kitchen shelf! Thank you so much for submitting this recipe.

Made this tonight for tacos and it was great.
Much better than what's available in my regular supermarket.  Based on other reviews I was worried it would be to tomatoey, but it seemed just right to me.   I froze half for next time and will definitely be making this again.

Make this a day in advance...It’s ok right off the stove but it’s really good after a night in the fridge!   I had to sub chipotle pepper since that’s what I had on hand, and I added a splash of Worcestershire sauce based on another couple of reviews - other than that I followed the recipe as written.   Keeper recipe!

Absolutely love it! Now I can make one batch without the cayenne pepper and split it to make a hotter sauce for me and a milder one for my husband. It tastes exactly like what you can buy in the supermarket without all the chemicals and you know what's in it. One difference is we don't use white sugar and I substituted 3/4 tsp of Truvia for the teaspoon of sugar.

I'll never buy taco sauce again.  This is so easy to make and is so full of flavor.  If I happen to have any leftovers I won't use right away, I freeze it.

very easy to make as i had all the ingredients at hand.  just the right amount of spice.  it is a bit heavy on the cumin, but i like cumin.  i imagine it will only get better with time.  going to freeze the whole batch.

Used apple cider instead of white vinegar, 2 big dashes Worcestershire sauce, 1 full tsp. chili powder, 2 packets Splenda and no cayenne. It was perfect for us! Thank you!

It was too tame for my taste as is. I added a lot more heat, more garlic salt, more chili powder, and a dash of Worcester sauce (enhances the vinegar/sugar taste). Afterwards it was great. ;)

I liked it, kids didn't because the're used to the more sugary Ortega bottled sauce. This cost a lot less to make and they'll get used to it. I added an extra teaspoon of sugar.

Great base recipe that gets the flavor I’m looking for. It’s also easy to sub ingredients for what you have. I was out of tomato sauce, actually any tomato products except for Italian stewed tomatoes. I just blended that up with the other ingredients and it was perfect.

This sauce competes with store bought options very well. Only modification I made was an extra dash of cayenne for some extra heat. My only complaint is that the sauce was slightly too "tomatoey" for my tastes, but nowhere near enough to call it bad. Don't think I'll ever have to buy taco sauce again!

Very good with the right amount of zip. Of course, you can adjust the spices to suit yourself. I halved it and will use in making  Chorizo Stuffed Poblano Peppers from this site. The rest I'll divide into plastic ziplock bags and freeze, as suggested by a reviewer. Very easy recipe, with no additives like you could find in store-bought stuff. Thanks for the recipe Michael!

I’m making this right now for the 4th or 5th time.  I will NEVER buy this in the store again!  I don’t typically use garlic salt, only garlic powder, so I use 1 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp salt.  I also cut back on the cayenne, so I can chop a few fresh jalapeños into my taco salad...I love this stuff! Freezing the leftovers is great!

Made as directed. We served it immediately and was underwhelmed the first time. Tried it again a few days later and loved it. It was a near clone of my kids favorite Mexican style fast food place. Next time I’ll be sure to make it a day ahead to let the flavors mingle before serving.

I edited it a bit myself, having a mentor of cooking of about 25+ years suggest some alternatives to the ingredients here since I didn't have any of them. However, it turned out amazingly well! My friends loved it during our taco potluck get together! :D

Followed exactly . Impressed. It's great with no far out ingredients to buy.  Perfect texture. Fraction of store bought price and tastes better.  Makes a nice wet burrito red sauce too.  This one made the favorites list.  Thanks for sharing.

I substituted chicken broth for the water to make it a little richer, and I added a bit more chili powder. Delicious!

This was a delicious sauce that could be used with so many Mexican dishes, and it could be tweaked for taste preferences. Perfect as is, though.

Oh my gosh this taco sauce is amazing!!  Sometimes I will try a recipe and it doesn't quite taste like what I thought it would and I know that just goes by the individual.  But I am with everyone else...I will never buy taco sauce again!  I don't like chunky sauces so this is amazing!  My husband loved it too and it's so easy!!

This will be my go to sauce. The only change I made, was I had no sauce so used a quart of tomato juice in my little crock pot and cooked it down. Great.

The only changes I made were to double the amount of chili powder and cayenne to make it a bit hotter. Loved it! Used it on top of the Chicken Enchiladas I recipe found on this site. Great combo!!

Great sauce. I was a little short on cumin though, and I'm sure when I make it again with the full amount it will be even better.

Started out with the recipe as posted. Very close to our favorite store brand, but had just a little too much vinegar for our taste. Added another 8 oz. tomato sauce, bumped up the water to 1 cup, onion powder to 1Tbsp, garlic powder to 1/2 Tbsp, sugar to 1 tsp, chili powder to 1 tsp, and reduced the cayenne to 1/4 tsp. I let it simmer for over an hour, and it was great!

love this recipe as a baseline. I Added 1/2 tsp ground coriander seed and a little more vinegar. Next time I will try using fresh onion and garlic simmering it longer.
