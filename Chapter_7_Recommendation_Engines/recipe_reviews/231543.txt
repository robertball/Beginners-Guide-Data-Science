I like ginger, but even I thought this was way too ginger-y. The dressing was pretty runny. It has potential but needs to tweaks.

This is a delightful combination of flavors, unlike any coleslaw ever encountered.  Next time I will combine the  shallots and ginger in the dressing ingredients, pulsing them to thoroughly incorporate them.  Immediately after making this slaw I ate a big bowlful.  I couldn't stop.  i was so glad I made a double batch so I could have some more before breakfast today.

Absolutely delicious!! We had large red cabbage from our garden and didn't know what to make with it and found this great, easy recipe. It's also great without the wasabi paste, almost better, since you can taste all the ingredients better without it.

Loved this recipe.  I had to cut back on the mayo and oil and skip the seeds and nuts to make it low cal, but the ginger gave it such a nice flavor.

Very different from any other slaw recipe I’ve tried. I didn’t have sunflower seeds, so I used egusi. Thank you for the recipe.

Dialed back the ginger and basil a tad for a more subtle appearance.
