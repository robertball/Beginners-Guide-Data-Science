I LOVE this recipe - It appeared in a Parenting Magazine years ago, just after my daughter was born and I've been making it ever since. I usually just add a tablespoon of butter (if any at all) You won't miss it! I also cut down on the chocolate chips (personal preference)

I have been making this for many years!  You can always substitute chocolate chips for 2tsp of pumpkin pie spice!

Too buttery. Used half of what it called for and it still tasted too strong.

A hit at a teenager birthday party. I preferred it with 1/2 the butter, but I'm not a butter fanatic either. Instead everyone at the party loved it as is, so 5 stars is is! It's a fool proof way to serve a cheesecake flavour without needing to bake. It is also nice to serve with different types of cookies (also accommodating gluten free, nut free and other special diets). I topped some of them with toasted almonds, some with strawberry preserves and some as is. The top favourites for "scoops" were graham crackers and Pavesini! Thank you Angela Naumann for your recipe.

This recipe was a hit.  Everyone loved it.  I made a few changes.  I only used 1 tbsp of light brown sugar because I didn't want it too sweet and only about 1/3 stick of butter instead of a full stick because it's what I had.  I also only used 1/2 cup of mini chocolate chips.  A full cup would have been way too much and would have overpowered the cheesecake flavor.  Make sure you have enough graham crackers.  This dip would have been gone if I had brought more graham crackers. I would definitely make this again.

Always a popular offering! And so easy! The only thing I changed was to only put 1/4 stick of butter in it; a whole stick just sounded like overkill.  Had requests for the recipe. Thanks!

Yummy with apple slices & honey or chocolate graham sticks. For a delicious variation, use peanut butter instead of butter (& leave out brown sugar & vanilla).

Loved it! I cut the butter down to a 1/3 stick based on another reviewer and it was perfect. I server it with graham crackers and mini Nilla wafers.

Ive been making this for years. Must have every year at family Christmas party. I usually have to double batch it. I've often forgotten the brown sugar but still always a hit. Tastes awesome on a toasted plain bagel too.

I came across this recipe and have been wanting to try it since my family are big cheesecake lovers. I don't always feel like taking the time to make a traditional cheesecake. this dip is delish, and sooo easy to whip together. The only change I made to the recipe is that I only used half the butter called for in the original recipe. it tastes just like cheesecake and was a huge hit with my family.  Thank you so much for a great recipe.

I doubled the recipe except the butter, using only half stick. I also used 3 Tbs of vanilla because we love vanilla!  Tastes wonderful with graham crackers or vanilla waffers.

This is a good base for a dip. I've made this many times and each time different.  I've added peanut butter, different flavor chips, and melted chocolate.  It's even good with a little cinnamon. This a must staple for your recipe collection.

Tastes better if you make ahead and let it sit a while before eating.  I only used 1/4 stick of butter and that was plenty for my taste.  I'll definitely make this again but may try some other add-in besides chocolate chips.

okay, so I am the annoying person who tweaks the recipe. I did not add chocolate chips because, quite frankly I did not want to put the giant ones I had in a dip.  I thought the ratio would be off per dipping would be off.  I did however put crushed oreos on top, it was a huge hit.  I made a graveyard theme for a halloween party with Milano cookie headstones.

I made it according to The recipe, I think it was delicious; however, maybe just a tad too sweet. But that is just probably by taste buds, I think next time I would just add a little less powdered sugar. But it was delicious and everyone was asking what was in it as it.

We made no changes and this dip was FANTASTIC.  It would be a great party dip if you don't make the mistake of "tasting" it first!  You might wind up eating the whole batch before the party starts!  Thank you for an easy and delicious recipe!

I made this tonight because I wanted something sweet and quick to make. This recipe was perfect!! It tasted so good, especially with strawberries and grapes! I will definitely make again!

Bit too much for a dip in my opinion, but makes for a pretty fantastic no-bake cheesecake! 
Next time, I'm going to try chocolate shavings instead of chips to get a less concentrated blend.

It's like eating cookie dough. Very addictive. Make sure you have some place to take it, like to a party. It will be devoured.

Pretty good...gave it 4 1/2 stars.  Made as directed and served with almond cookies.  A nice addition to our Ladies Bible Study Christmas Party.
