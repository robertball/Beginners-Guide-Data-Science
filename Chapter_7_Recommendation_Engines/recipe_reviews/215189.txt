Delicious! I used fat free vanilla yogurt and skim milk to keep it on the lighter side. This was very good for breakfast.

The flavor of this smoothie was very appealing. I changed nothing, only adding in a few blueberries. I like that it primarily uses pineapple juice rather than orange juice, which usually makes a smoothie too tart.  I would recommend using frozen fruit to make it more refreshing (but additional liquid is needed if you do that). Tip* if you use very ripe strawberries, it cancels out the need to add the sugar. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

The only change that I made on this was I added oatmeal to it. I wanted it to have extra fiber, but other than that, this is a good beverage. thanks for sharing it.

I thought this tasted good. Pretty similar to the type I used to make when I first started making smoothies. It kind of tasted like a melted strawberry shake and I used a frozen banana. After I tasted the recipe I added about 8 ice cubes, as I always do with smoothies, because I prefer them icy cold. I also subbed the sugar with 1 packet of Truvia. Lately, I have been throwing vegetables in them also, and added a handful of shredded carrots, but that was only to get some veggies in. It tasted great as is.

I used a large frozen banana, Stacy's organic vanilla yogurt and 1/4 cup Dole strawberry-pineapple-orange juice. The kids thought this was great, though I did have to add a little more juice.

I'm actually agreeing with everyone thus far?  That never happens. LOL.  There was just enough juice and yogurt in this to keep the strawberry subtle and not get too over-powering.  (I don't like banana or strawberry either one to get too over-powering and like other flavors to sort of "calm them down" - yogurt works well for that.)  It mixed up well and was easy to drink.  But not a wow, so a 4.

Very yummy! I took some strawberries out and added raspberries, blackberries, and blueberries. I also substituted stevia blend for sugar and used less than called for. I also used orange juice because I didn't have pineapple. Delicious!

I only had frozen fruit, so I tried a frostier version of this recipe (tbh, I had no patience to thaw fruit).... and ended up discovering one of the best ice cream recipes! If you like this as a smoothie, treat yourself to the frozen version. Awesome!

I've been having a horrible time getting my kid to eat healthy things.  She is just ridiculously fussy!   I've tried making other smoothies before and they've always been bland (to her), but she loves the ones at McDonalds (of course).    This is great.   I get her to have some yogurt and lots of fruit (I used frozen strawberries and blueberries) and strawberry yogurt.   I would definitely try this throwing some oatmeal in, as someone else suggested, but we'll wait for a weekend for that when I have more time to deal with the "ugh... what did you DO to this?!?"    She always knows....

Pretty good taste and job....being my 1st time but used FRESH cut pineapples instead of juice, almond milk, blueberries, light Greek yogurt, ice cubes, and about 1/4 of a banana. No sugar or orange juice. Children like it.

I love this easy to follow recipe! My kids(teenagers) love smoothies, but it ends up being a chore sometimes so we normally just buy them. I decided to buck up, get the ingredients, and just make them. I used a frozen blend of strawberries, peaches, and bananas so I did not need to add a fresh whole banana. It still tasted great and my daughter said "It was refreshing!" That's a win-win in my world! I'm pretty sure you could change up the fruits as well as adding some spinach, whey protien powder, or add some spirits for a nice frozen 'happy hour' drink. Happy blending!

I appreciate  reading other people's experience using a recipe, so here's mine.  I had to use ingredients on hand, and I omitted the sugar because I've never thought a smoothie needed added sugar.  I gave it a high rating because the ratio of ingredient types worked well. I used plain unsweetened Greek yogurt, apple cider instead of the pineapple juice,  frozen strawberries, and since I increased the recipe by 50% I used one fresh banana plus a handful  of frozen banana. No changes to other ingredients. Using frozen fruit makes it thicker, but it was still smooth, and drinkable (no spoon required). Good enough to add to my recipe box. Without the pineapple juice, I felt it should be labeled Strawberry Banana Yogurt Smoothie.

A whole banana in my opinion over powered the smoothie so I would recommend half of one otherwise tasted great.....

Really good, but try adding 1 cup rasberries and 1cup blackberries, it's even better.

This turned out great! I made it with the sugar called for, but it was probably unnecessary. The pineapple and orange juice do much to sweeten already. Seriously one of the best smoothies I've ever had!

This recipe was fantastic, though I substituted the banana for spinach and I also didn't put in the Orange juice. I used cherry yogurt and it was delicious

This was a very good smoothie even my four year old liked it. We will make this again, but maybe tinker with it a bit it needed a little bit more flavor since I felt it was missing something.

This is pretty good.  I added a little more milk and orange juice and skipped the pineapple juice. (I didn't have any).
