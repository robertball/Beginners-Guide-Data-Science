What a success!!! This recipe was delicious. I didn't have any 'over ripe' bananas, so i used 4 instead of the recommended 3. I also covered the top with foil for the last 15 minutes which slightly steamed the loaf and made it deliciously moist!! Will be making this one again very soon!

The banana bread is delicious!
With the 1 cup of sugar, i halved it using half
white sugar and half brown sugar and it came out yummy!  Definitely make this again =)

I make banana bread all the time and I'm always looking for a new banana bread recipe. This one is not it.
"Banana Cake" is misleading because it did not have a cake-like texture to me. It was yet another average bland banana bread recipe. The exterior gets too overdone and brown while the inside was rather dry. This is not a recipe that is different enough to stand out among all my other banana bread recipes.

This banana bread is awesome! I used 4 bananas, and added about 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon and a couple of handfulls of chopped walnuts. I did have to bake it for about 1 hour and 10 minutes, but it was well worth the wait. I took it out of the oven about 20 minutes ago, and it's almost gone! Great recipe!

What a great recipe.  I've never had banana cake, and to me this tasted just like banana bread--which is exactly what I wanted.  It had a great banana flavor, and was perfect for breakfast.  I also cut down on the sugar (to about 3/4 a cup) and it was perfect for my taste.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have been making banana bread/cake for about 25 years and this is the best I've ever found.  My kids (4 & 5) love making it w/ me - it's a great kid friendly recipe.  If I serve it for breakfast I serve it as is, sometimes w/ butter.  For dessert I make a powder sugar or cream cheese glaze (depends on what I have on hand) and pour on top of it while it is still warm (not hot)- this is my husband's favorite way to eat it.  The glaze makes it more of a "cake" but still not overly sweet like regular frosted cake.  Thank you Sandi for a great recipe!

Tasty! I made one change--I cut the sugar back by half. I had a two-pack package of Nature's Valley Oats and Honey that I crushed up and sprinkled over the top before baking, just to use it and get it out of my pantry. I'm glad I cut the sugar by half. My bananas were really ripe, if I hadn't it would have been way too sweet. Nice basic banana bread recipe. I got 12 medium sized muffins out of this recipe. 350* for 20 minutes was just right.

The recipe was great! Like one other reviewer here, I thought it was a bit sweet but then that's
a personal taste. Next time I'll cut the sugar out a bit. The texture and consistency was terrific. Thanks for sharing!

Finally a banana bread recipe that I like!!  I have tried several recipes from this site that have been too bland, too dry, etc...  This one is great!!!  I took the liberty of making a couple changes after reading other reviews, I replaced the 1 cup sugar w/ 1/4 cup splenda and 1/2 cup brown sugar, added an extra banana, extra egg and some cinnamon.  It was full of flavor, moist and delicious!!! Thanks for the keeper!!

loved this, lots of banana flavour, very light texture and so easy to make. My only change was to use 1/2 a cup of white sugar and 1/2 a cup of brown sugar. Thank you for sharing this with us.

So moist and easy to prepare! I replaced the 1 cup of sugar with 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup Splenda. I used 2 very 'expired' large bananas and sprinkled cinnamon and brown sugar on top before baking. Save yourself some time and forget the baking powder and soda...just use self rising flour instead. I baked this in a glass pyrex dish lined with non-stick baking paper, so easy to remove and clean. I will definitely make this again, in fact I have some very ripe bananas waiting in the freezer for next time!

Awesome! Best Banana loaf ever. Didnt change the recipe at all and was perfectly moist. For those who have written a review to say it was bland or tasteless...the secret is the ripe bananas. If the bananas have a strong "ripe banana" smell, you can guarantee fullness of flavour also.

I was drawn to this recipe because a) it uses 3 overripe bananas, which I had and b) the pic showed muffins, which I thought I would make. In the end, though, I made a 5x9 loaf. I added 1/4 c. each chocolate and peanut butter chips. I also used 1/2 c white and 1/2 c brown sugar as suggested by another reviewer. Within an hour of coming out of the oven my 5x9 had become 5x2, and I was asked to make this again. Many thanks for an easy recipe, Sandi!

I made this recipe for the first time about 6 years ago when the restaurant I worked in needed some "extras" for our breakfast buffet. Customers ate it up like crazy and asked repeatedly for the recipe. Sandi, this is just excellent.  I used, as per suggestions by others, an extra egg to assure optimum moistness. Just wanted you to know there are hundreds of people in the Niagara area that enjoy this loaf regularly. Thanks for posting it

I wish I could compare this recipe to the other banana bread/loaf/cake recipes on this site but this recipe is so awesome, I have not even tried any others.  I make this banana loaf at least once a month for the last few years.  I don't adjust the recipe at all, though I often double it. It is delicious and moist- the right amount of sweet and flavor.  So simple and easy to make too.

Moist and delicious and simple. I used one extra banana, and I covered the loaf with foil for the last ~10 mins of baking. I made this when my boyfriend was craving a store bought banana loaf cake, he thought this was better :)

I added 1.5 tsp of cinnamon and handful of walnuts, used only half the sugar (and raw sugar), used 4 bananas and substituted half the flour for whole wheat...turned out great!

This was an easy and fail proof cake. I had all the ingredients I needed and everyone loved it. Keep it as is and don't substitute, it's already low-fat and tastes great. I used a litle banana frosting to sweeten it but next time I think I'll use cream cheese.

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recommendations made by previous reviewers ( 1/2 c butter, 1/2 c white sugar, 1/4 c brown sugar, and a pinch of cinnamon ) and it turned out better that I could have expected. My 6 yr old daughter will be over the moon when she sees a piece of this yummy loaf in her lunch tomorrow. Thanks Sandi :)

I had 3 banana's that were so-oooo ripe, black was so close to being their new color.  They were going to be snack for my horses, when I just happened to be browsing Allrecipes, and came across this recipe.  I decided to give it a try.  I'm glad I did.  WONDERFUL!!!  Quick, Easy and very Moist.  Sorry Shasta and Brigg's, no more banana's for snacks.  Back to the carrot's and apple's.  Maybe I'll give them a little taste for their sacrifice.  Thank you Sandi.

Fantastic recipe! Easy way to use up old bananas. I also substituted whole wheat flour and used raw organic sugar. 
I made mine in mini loaf pans. Perfect size for lunches

This is AMAZING Banana Bread. I added 1 very small shredded apple to the batter along with a handful of Pecan Pieces and Walnut Pieces. When I'm making it for my 11 year old, I also throw in a couple of handfuls of Chocolate Chips along with the apples and nuts....to die for. What a way to eat Bananas and Apples... :-)

This is a good basic recipe with a pure banana flavor. It has a great cake texture, less dense than bread. My son won't eat nuts so this recipe was perfect for our home! I may put a foil tent over the top for the first 30 mins. or so because it did brown a bit too much on top as other reviews mention. I'll keep this recipe around and use it when my bananas look sad.

This turned out as a really great banana bread recipe!  I did mine in mini-loaf pans and I also added frozen cranberries to the mixture.  It puffed up nicely, looks appetizing and also tastes really good.  I didn't drizzle icing on mine, but I think that would be a really great touch to add a little more sweetness.

I give this recipe 4 star.  However, I suggest that anyone using this recipe can modify as follows: Instead of using sugar, add one more egg and 10grams (1 tablespoon) of granulated coffee,1/4 cup chopped almonds and 2 tablespoon of grated 90% dark cholocate.  This will help those on sugar free diet or watching the calories - I personally think their is enough bananas to help the taste. Enjoy

Excellent banana bread/cake recipe. I actually did not have the full amount of banana's this recipe called for and yet it was still very moist and flavorful. I am sure it would have been even denser if I followed the recipe to a T. Could be a versatile recipe to add walnets or chocolate chips to for added flavor.

The bestest ever banana cake.  I ran out of white sugar and so I used half white half brown sugar for the first cake I made and it was delicious.  Then the second one I made, I used all brown sugar....absolutely delicious.  A very moist, light and fluffy cake.  I finish the cake with lemon frosting once cooled.

***I first rated this recipe 2 stars and really didn't care for it, but after this loaf sat for a day or two it tasted wonderful! I can't believe how much the flavor improved in a couple of days, with the simple ingredients I will most likely make this again***

This was a fabulous recipe that I will make over and over again.  I split the recipe between two smaller loaf pans and it works out just great with less baking time.  This bread (cake)disappears quickly at my house!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This is the best banana bread! I love it and I make it for my staff just about every other week. Its really simple and I love the fact that I don't have to throw away overripe bananas. I freeze them just like Sandi Suggessted! Its a great Idea and I just love it.  I add walnuts to mine and everyone raves!! Thank you Ms. Sandi!

This is the best banana bread recipe I have ever made.  My family loved it!  You can add a few walnuts to give it a nutty crunch, but it is excellent as is.

I wanted to try making a gluten free banana loaf for my 15-month old son since he has a serious wheat allergy. I cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup, subbed the AP flour with gluten free AP baking flour, and I added 1/4 cup sour cream too. When I mixed the ingredients all together it felt a little too wet to me so I added a little more flour. I baked the loaf to close to 50 mins. The loaf came out pretty tasty!  It doesn't taste gluten free!  It was quite moist and not too sweet. Hopefully my little one will like it!

Great recipe! Easy to make and tastes lovely.

I switched the quantities of of baking soda and powder and used only 2 very ripe bananas for a milder flavour.

My husband and son said this was the best banana bread they have ever tasted.  It was a big hit.  I will be baking it again the second I get some overripe bananas...  I wouldn't call it "cake" either.  It's more like traditional banana bread.  ADAPTS - I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, as someone suggested, and I used 4 bananas (which I had in the freezer, so they were not only full of flavour but they were mashed already and pretty-much ready to go when I peeled them).  I will do this again next time.  Thank you Sandi!

** 18 MONTHS LATER ** This is still the only banana bread recipe I use.  Everyone loves it... Three things - Add 1/2 tsp cinnamon, Split the 1 cup sugar with 1/2 brown + 1/2 white... 

TODAY I MADE MUFFINS AND WANTED TO SHARE COOK TIMES:
1- medium muffin tin, batter half full - 16 minutes
2 - large/xl muffin tin, batter 2/3 full - 32 minutes

Delicious as muffins and easier to put in kids' lunches!

Fantastic recipie.  I wanted to eat the whole thing but, of course, I didn't.  The cake is a little on the heavier side but still wonderful.  I made only a few minor changes.  I used 3/4 cup sugar instead of 1 cup.  Next time I will use 1/2 cup sugar.  I added some chopped walnuts and some golden raisins.  What a company dessert this would be dished with some vanilla ice cream.  Bravo on this one.  Thank you!!!

I am very happy with this banana bread. I used 4 bananas and added a splash of milk to them when I mashed them because mine were not very ripe. I also added walnuts and a dash of cinnamon. I used to make my mom's recipe with shortening and many more ingredients which was always moist on top and dry on the bottom. This one is moist from top to bottom, not just on top. I will make again and again and next time I will add a few spices to jazz it up. Thanks for the great recipe! My husband raved.

I had banannas that needed to be used before the weekend was over. I was looking for a simple recipe with ingredients I had on hand, and found this. Wrote it down on paper, and made it.
I made muffins instead of a loaf because I don't own a loaf pan. I doubled the recipe exactly as written, but used 8 banannas instead. I got exactly 24 muffins. Baked the pans one at a time, for 20 minutes. They came out perfect. Tasted one, and yummy. When I came back to this site just now to rate them, I realized I didn't write down the vanilla..But the good thing is, I wasn't missing anything on taste without it. I'm going to cover half with cream cheese frosting,and leave the others plain. They are good just the way they are.

I can't believe I'm the only person whose final product turned out bad.  It was DRY, Dry, Dry.  I even reduced the baking time to 45 min.  Besides using a little less sugar, followed the recipe exactly.

I doubled this recipe and made two loaves of this "bread". It was soooo good and moist, even thought I was short one banana. Everybody liked it. I will certainly use this recipe again. The only thing I will do next time is cut down on the sugar, it was just a little to sweet for my taste but still delicious. Thanks for sharing this one.

I just made this recipe today and it is the banana bread recipe that I have been looking for and hadn't been able to find! I did use 1/2 cup butter, 2 eggs and a pinch of salt. The original recipe might have been good, but I'm sticking with the changes since we loved it!

I've made it twice in one week.  My husband's favorite is banana bread which this is.  I made a mistake the first time and used 1/2 c butter and it turned out great.  Rather than chance the 1/4 c butter I've stayed with the larger amount, it was so good.

I couldn't believe how easy this was to make, and it was so yummy, everyone loved it!  For extra, I served cake with fresh banana slices and a touch of whipped cream, it was perfect, thank you!  Also tasted great warmed for breakfast the next day.

This is a great, super simple recipe.  It was a little better when I added an extra egg (2 eggs total) and another 1/4 cup of butter.  A little heavier, but better.

It looked and tasted really good. However, for people new to baking (like me) you should specify in the instructions that I had to mix the softened butter and sugar together first - which creams the butter with the sugar so that the resulted batter doesn't end up with little lumps of butter throughout the mixture. Overall, great recipe but the instructions should have more detail in the mixing process.

This was pretty good, I followed someone else's advice and covered the loaf with foil for the last 15 minutes and it turns out extremely moist! I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I tried it with Bob's Red Mill Gluten-Free all purpose baking flour as well and it was so moist and flavourful.

Amazing! Everybody that tries this asks for the recipe. It is delicious and moist, not mention it's easy to make. I've made this about 20 times over the past three years, and always find it tastes better if you use 3 large bananas, and if you have small ones, add another to the mix :)

Really good, basic banana loaf, but way too sweet.  Halve the sugar and use properly ripe bananas - preferably ripe to the point where you're wondering whether to just throw them away - and it's great.  Adding 100g dark chocolate chunks makes it luxurious.

Sandi: Your recipe was delicious! It't the first time I make a bread from scratch, it was perfecto! 
Thank you so much! What I do so my baking doesn't get hard I put them in a ziploc bag and seal it! The steam of the hot bread keeps it moist and soft for a very long time. 
Excellent recipe! I LOVE IT, MY HUSBAND, SON AND FRIEND LOVED IT ASWELL.

Usually I'm not a big fan of banana cake but this is so good. The cake was very moist and the taste was perfectly balanced. For some reasons my cake didn't came out as puffy as I thought it would be. Or maybe it's supposed to be like that. Will definitely make it many more times.

My 22-year-old son discovered this and made it as a treat for me.  It is, quite simply, delicious!  Very moist, quick & easy. As another poster mentioned, the only change I made was from 1 cup sugar to 1/2 cup.  This get 2 enthusiastic thumbs up from me.  :D

I thought this was great.  I made muffins out of it and they were great, not too sweet to me as some have said.  I did have to add another egg as it was way to dry and I used four bananas as mine were smaller ones.  I added chocolate chips to half, wish I had used them in all it was awesome!  Good easy recipe, I cut way back on bake time as I was doing muffins got done quick.

Great, wonderfull banana bread, you can add a lot of diferent ingredientas. I will make a lot of recipes from this one, from banana bread to banana chocolate chip cinnamon cake, etc. This cake has the simplicity we need to expand our creativity in the kitchen.
I will make 10 cakes today for a dinner at church. I'm sure they will love it.

Hi I have cooked this cake several times and each time it is a hit with everyone.  I am now given bananas just so I will make it.   
This is the simpliest cake I have made and tastes fab.

pretty good.
I'd say 3 1/2 bananas will make it more moist. 3 is too dry for me.
easy and hard to fail. :)

Great tasting banana bread. I followed the recipe exactly, except I only had two bananas but the flavor was still magnificent. I also saw someone recommending glazing the cake with milk chocolate, which sounded great for a more festive dessert. Thanks very much!

A wonderful basic recipe. Being from the caribbean I love spices and took the advice of others and added cinnamon, allspice , almond extract and an extra egg. I am also cutting back on sugar so I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Everyone loves this recipe, this is great for beginners.

I made this recipe in just a few minutes for company that loves banana bread which it tastes just like more so than a cake. I also cooked it in a bundt pan and added a little cinnamon after it was in the pan which made a beautiful swirly color and enhanced the flavor. It was pretty good. No complaints.

A good banana cake. I used 4 ripe bananas as that was what was left in the fruit bowl. The cooking time was a little longer than stated to get the centre cooked and the edges were a little dark but that might be my oven. Thanks.

Easy, moist and tasted wonderful!  The bananas I used were small, so I used 4 small ones and it worked perfectly.  I will definitely use this recipe again.  May try it as mini loaves or muffins next time just for fun.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

This recipe was so easy and I had all the ingredients I needed already in my cupboard. I would suggest not altering the recipe, it's nice and low-fat as is! I used a banana frosting to sweeten it but next time I think cream cheese frosting would be divine.

I used a full teaspoon of baking powder for a more cake like result and used only half a cup of sugar. Instead of two eggs as some users suggested, I added a dollop of sour cream, about 1/4 cup. The result was GREAT!!!

extremely fuss-free and easy to bake! i replaced the egg with half a large banana and used cinnamon instead of vanila essence as i couldn't find the essence. i also replaced the white sugar with brown sugar and it came out a lovely toffee colour~! enjoy...

After reading several reviews, I too doubled the butter and egg.  I shook  a little salt in.  This cake/loaf was really good!!  Because of it's sweetness it seemed more cake-like.  Next time I will try cutting down on the sugar just to see how it tastes.  I had three pieces last night (once warm out of the oven, once at room temperature and once when wrapping it up.  This morning my husband and I had some cold from the refrigerator and again it was terrific.  Don't think you can go wrong trying this recipe.

Great receipe!!! Thanks Sandi.  The texture is somewhat between bread and cake, but it's really moist.  Taste so good and easy to make.  I followed some modifications as suggested by previous reviewers by adding one extra egg, and reduce white sugar to 3/4 cup.

Very nice and moist, very quick and simple. I took some of the advice and did half half brown and white sugar, i used 2 big bananas; which didn't need mashing as they were SO very ripe.. and i added some cinnamon and some ground walnuts. These gave a nice texture, as the loaf was soft and moist with tiny little crunchy bits! Also the top was nice and crunchy!

This was really good.  I made it with wheat flour and it was good but made it a little gritty, so I wouldn't suggest it.  I will make it again - but with white flour this time.  And I added about a cup or so of chopped walnuts.  It was very moist.

This certainly isn't banana CAKE- but it IS one of the best banana BREAD recipes I've come across.  I took the advice of others and added an extra egg, 1/4 cup applesauce (instead of more butter), 1/2 tsp salt (it really makes a difference) and 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  It took the full 60 minutes to bake.  The house smelled so good I was getting upset waiting.  I ate almost half the loaf!!!  It's that good.  Thanks for the recipe.

My new favorite way to use up bananas. This is surprisingly moist, and could not be any easier to make. I have added coconut and baked it as mini loaves, and mini chocolate chips and baked it as mini muffins. It is a little sweeter than a banana bread, yet it's not quite a cake. I think it would make a good 13x9 snack cake with a milk chocolate frosting. Hmmm...I have bananas in the freezer....

This made a good loaf of banana bread, but my worst fear (whenever I make banana bread in a loaf pan instead of muffins) came true.  I took it out too soon so it was a little under-done and caved in a bit.  Most of it was still edible though.  Make this bread but follow cook time!

I thought this recipe was great.  My mom and I bought a bunch of cheap banana at the store that were starting to become overripe, and descided to make a banana loaf.  I have one but we descided to try a new one.  I took the advice in some other posts, and I doubled the butter and double the egg.  We also descided to double the recipe (ontop of the two doubled ingredients so now instead of 2 eggs it's 4) so we can make a big loaf and a small one and freeze one.  It doubled perfectly (some recipes can't be doubled), and I don't think we're gonna have a chance to freeze one because one loaf is almost gone and it was made yesterday.  Great recipe!!

This is delicious.  I used the 8x3 loaf pans and made 3 perfect loaves.  Froze two for later.  This works better than 2 bigger loaves for my smaller family.  Wonderfully moist, doesn't need frosting.

Loved this Banana Bread. I made it in the food processor and it was moist, dense and flavourful. I am a terrible baker and this recipe is forgiving.

Very easy recipe - thank you! I’ve made it twice in the past week using whole wheat flour both times. I used 2 medium eggs for a single batch because of the whole wheat flour, and when I doubled the recipe I used 4 medium eggs. Delicious!!!

I basically followed the recipe but used the same amount of  vegetable oil as I was in a hurry and didn't want the hassle of taking out the butter and melting it (it was for a potluck and the decision to bake was made about 1.5hours or so before I had to leave). I also added just a splash of milk in the mix. Turned out fine and I loved it. Thanks for the recipe. It's definitely a keeper.

I love this recipe, it's so yummy. I made a few adjustments that took it to the next level. 1) I reduced the amount of flour by a quarter or you can add an extra banana to increase the moisture. 2) I submitted the butter for avocado oil (much healthier) 3) optional, I added chocolate chip and or walnuts.

This was my first attempt at banana loaf and we deem it a success. I made it exactly as written, only substituting splenda for the sugar.

I took the advice of one reviewer and covered it in foil for the last fifteen minutes of cooking. This is a bit dry and that cover, near the end, will help maintain some of the moisture.

Super easy to make.  An icing or glaze would go well with this, if you are not concerned about the calories.

Made one change only: 1/4 Cup of sugar instead of 1 C.  We all felt it was still sweet enough.  I baked it for 30 minutes uncovered, then 20 more minutes covered in aluminum foil. I used white flour only, no whole wheat like I usually do, and  I still feel it came out just a little dry.  The rest of the family was happy enough with it, though.  Maybe next time I'll reduce the cooking time by a few minutes.

I made these as muffins, baking for about 25 min. These were light and fluffy with a nice crispy edge on the top.  Very sweet, even though I put in slightly less than 1 cup of sugar.

Loved this.  I did not have butter so I used margarine.  I also used an extra half of a banana just to make it more flavorful.  I noticed some complaining about the sweetness, but it was fine with me.  I did, however, notice there is no salt called for in this recipe which is unusual.  Most sweets have salt to enhance the sugar, so I added 1/4 teaspoon salt and the sweetness was perfect.  Will definitely make again and again! Thank you for sharing :)

The mixture was a bit too watery so I added 2 tablespoonful of flour to it. I'm not sure if this changed much. The cake itself was quite, 'grainy', possibly due to my very noob-like way of mixing everything together and throwing in extra flour.  Overall, I think this is a very simple and easy to make cake - throw everything in, bake, (cool), eat. It also smells very nice - my whole place smelled heavenly banana cake-like for the entire time it cooked.

I loved this recipe! The only change I made was adding a jar of baby applesauce for moisture. I topped it with a banana cream cheese drizzle. It was wonderful. Next time however I think I should only bake it for 40 minutes. Other than that it's a very good recipe!

Impressively simple and delicious! After reading the reviews, I ended up adding walnuts and an additional banana; mine were on the smaller side. It's possible that this caused the cake to become extra moist and tender. It is truly lightweight and delectable! Mine was ready in 47 minutes. It got dark brown on top and all around and it was fully cooked on the inside. I did use a 9x9 Pyrex pan though, so that's probably why it took less than the recommended time.

Very dense and moist! I made 12 muffins; 350 for 20 minutes was perfect. Used half white and half whole wheat flour. Also used half white and half brown sugar. Next time, I will take advice of some reviewers and cut sugar down a little. I love sweet things, but even my sweet tooth thinks this is a little too sweet. It's very, very good, though! One review said it was dry...the way mine turned out, I can't imagine anyone getting a dry product from this recipe!

YUM!! With over 20 years of banana bread making behind me, I have to say this is the perfect recipe. I only had 2 bananas but it still worked out well. I added 1 tsp nutmeg and 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon just because I love them. We didn't find ot too sweet at all. Maybe because of the nutmeg and cinnamon ? A big plus is the way it doesn't crumble like traditional banana bread does. Even when sliced and toasted !

I am really pleased with this recipe. It's moist, the sweetness is just right for my taste and it's easy to make.  I baked it on a muffin tin and I only needed 20 mins.  This is excellent. I will definitely making this again.

My kind of baking - everything in 1 bowl!!!  I made this yesterday and it's nearly gone!  The only change I made was to decrease the sugar to 3/4 cup and I threw in a handful of chocolate chips.  The next time I make it I'll take some other reviewers advice and add some cinnamon just to change it around a bit.  This is a simple and delicious banana loaf.  Thanks for the recipe.

It's a bit too sweet for me so I usually add a bit less sugar. Other than that it is delicious and easy to make.

Amazing recipe!  Perfect and moist EVERY TIME!!!  Very flexible as well.  I can put in dried cranberries or flax seeds or coconuts and it will still come out perfect :)

This is an excellent recipe, the Loaf came out great, and this is the first time ever that i've baked! Now my wife wants me to make it as often as possible. I used half the sugar requirement, coz it was a little on the sweet side;)

This wasn't one of my favorites.  I read other reviews and reduced the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup.   I also used 100% madagascar vanilla instead of imitation vanilla.  I'm not sure if that caused a huge difference, but this tasted weird to me.  I will try it again and stick to the recipe.  Also, it definitely didn't require 50 minutes.  I left it in for 30 and it was slightly scorched.  Oh, but I used a mini loaf pan which made 9 mini loafs.  I know...I changed the recipe.

What really attracted me to this recipe was the simplicity of the ingredient list - basic items which can easily be found in the kitchen! Cake turned out really yummy; I substituted about 50g of the sugar with brown sugar, and added some chocolate chips and walnut pieces as well. A definite keeper, I will be making this over and over again!

Excellent. This is the only banana cake recipe you'll ever need. Just to make a change, I add chopped walnuts and sometimes golden sultanas.

I took a previous reviewers advice and added an extra egg, 1/4 cup applesauce, 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  It was so moist and delicious!  Highly recommended!

i followed the modifications of adding an extra egg, 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/2 cup of walnuts. in addition, i cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar and also added a dash of banana flavour. it turned out yummy! we like having it for breakfast.

This is the BEST banana cake/loaf recipe I've ever tried.  Very moist.  Added crushed almonds for a variation and topped with allspice cream cheese frosting.

Great recipe!  I took the advice of adding more applesauce and extra egg.  The loaf was really tasty but it came out a bit darker on the top than I expected.

My family loved it! I'm not a banana cake fan, I would normally NEVER make banana cake for myself. But I couldn't get enough of it either! I used three really ripe bananas, no nuts. Wonderful texture and flavor. And so very easy to make!
