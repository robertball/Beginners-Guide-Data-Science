These were delicious.  I made the dough up early in the morning, with counter-top rising rather than fridge overnight rising.  The dough was too thin and sticky to work with by hand, so I just used two spoons to scoop the dough into the oil.  I put the remaining dough in the fridge for 24 hours, and the donut consistency the next day was even better.

I ate too many of these, but I do not regret it. I think it would be really good with some lemon or orange zest added to the dough, or perhaps to the sugar used to coat the donuts. Cooking temp is very important.

My Portuguese mother made malasadas.  Now I can share these wonderful delights with my friends in Ocala, FL.  This recipe is perfect!

Made this with my gluten-free flour and they turned out soooo yummy!  Definitely time consuming though.

I followed recipe exactly but my dough never thickened enough to knead. It was more like a thick batter. I just dropped spoonfuls into oil.

These turned out just like the way my mom made them. They were eaten up in no time by my husband's family. Thanks so much for posting the recipe!

I fried up about 1/2 the batch and put the left overs in a greased  Gal. ziplock bag. in frig. for the next day better the second then the first. Thank you for the recipe. I well make it over and over.

I made these malasadas.  They were better than average.  I am sure with some practice, they will get even better.  
The dough was a little soupy, so I added a bit of flour.  I could have mis-counted the flour, but I really should be able to count to 8.  We only have a half cup measure.

I cooked them on the stove in a skillet and in a fry-daddy.  The fry dadddy would only hold one at a time, but the temp was perfect 340 degrees.  The pan on the stove help 4 at a time but was really hard to keep a constant temp. I used a digital temp probe (sneaky).

I combined the dusting sugar with li hing powder, 3 Tablespoons sugar to 1 teaspoon li hing powder. These taste very good! I only rate this a 4 because as written, it is difficult to combine the ingredients. In the future I will add all liquid ingredients to the egg and sugar mixture and then add the liquid mixture to the dry mixture.


This is a soft dough, like thick/fluffy pancake batter. Rather than handling the dough I found it easier to scoop some dough with a spoon and push it into the heated oil with an oiled finger.

well It has been a long long time since I have had Malasadas...this brought back memories!Thanks for posting this-my gramma(vova) has passed since and my mom doesnt remember how to make. I can now make this for my children and some day my grandchildren. It was a little bit of trial and error for me getting the dough to rise and it was quite sticky to deal with but I would not add/change a thing! This was so DELICIOUS!! And authentic! 5 stars!

These come out very light and airy.  I like a fried dough that's a little heavier, but my Portuguese grandparents thought they came out perfect. The dough is tricky to work with- it's very soupy.  I added 1 cup more flour and it was still the consistancy of pancake batter.  Next time I think I'll add some lemon zest to the dough for a little more flavor.  All in all, a very good recipe.

Amazing!  I let it rise until double then put it in the fridge overnight.  The dough was sticky, but the water trick worked to keep your hands free of dough.  The hardest part was keeping the oil at the right temperature...the darker ones were nice and crispy though. :)

This recipe is a little off. I just made a batch and it was too loose. 3/4 cup of melted butter is too much in itself. 3/4 of a stick maybe? I was really looking forward to having these as I haven't had a good malasadas in quite sometime. I guess I'll just head to Fall River to find some. Please correct this recipe. Thank You.

the dough was sticky. let it rise overnight. only rose 1/4, not doubled(i think its the yeast).. so i punched in 1 tsp bakin soda into dough. my first batch was dense . it was 1cm thick. i made the rest into 1 inch balls and  rolled about 1/4 inch. half was cinnamon. i froze them between wax paper and place in bowl. cover to stop the freezer taste. they thaw out really fast. didnt deep fry, just fry. use the paper bag method to coat in sugar. these puff really good when i fried them. i always let double for at least 6 hrs. easy and will always make. simply good.

My family makes these every year for Easter we called him flagues. My great-grandmother Pacheco brought this recipe over from the Azores. The dough is supposed to be extremely soupy and she always would stretch it out rather thin just with her hands and if you put it in the oil she popped a hole right in the center, any whole makes a good crispy spot! I've also had these at Lords bakery on King Street in Honolulu, it's just the most wonderful home made Portuguese pastry there is. This and Massa Slavs or sweet bread, are absolutely amazing. Thank you so much for sharing.
