This was a good recipe, I will try it again.  However I will just make regular white rice w/water.  The chicken broth didn't seem to make much of a difference.

I just made this again last night, it was definatley better.  I seasoned the beef and bell peppers with a fajita seasoning packet while cooking on the stove.  I threw the green onions in the beef mixture during the last 5 minutes.  I doubled the honey mustard sauce. Lastly, I served this NEXT TO steamed white rice, cooked with out the chicken broth.

This recipe was great!  Very flavorful and healthy!  My only suggestion would be to double up on the Dijon/honey mixture as it seemed that it needed more sauce.  I bet this recipe would be great with chicken too!

This dish was great but lacked flavor :-( My daughter and began adding things to pep it up a bit. We ended up adding sliced onion, chopped garlic, and a tad of fresh ginger. Viola! It turned out great! The rice also required more liquid than called for in the orginal recipe. We also added coarse black pepper and used chives instead of the green onions. It all turned out wonderful! The children found it a hit as well!

This recipe was really good as a basic recipe.  I didnt make the rice how they said, I just  made basic white rice.  I used about 2 generous table spoon amounts of soy sauce and some sesame oil to give it an asian flavor.  Instead of a green onion I used a regular onion.  And finally, I added about 1/4 cup of orange juice to the mixture.  It turned out well, just be careful not to overcook the steak.

Fantastic quick dish with tastey results everyone loved! I used double the original ammount of honey and dijon mustard, as it did need a bit more sauce.

Quick & tasty! This recipe was a hit with my family. I didn’t have chicken broth, so I served this with Basmati Rice and left the green onions out for the kids. Also, I seasoned it with “Emeril's essence” instead of salt & pepper.

This is a pretty good recipe with a few alterations...  I cook the rice in my rice cooker without the chicken broth, Usually use 2 or 3 whole bell peppers, leave out the green onion, double the sauce, and add some garlic.

This was a good recipe.  My kids even tried it and liked it.  My husband liked the sweet/tangy flavor of the mustard and honey.  The onions in the rice are a nice twist.  Thank You.

The whole family enjoyed this, even the picky little one.  Doubled the beef and sauce.  Added a little ground ginger, black pepper, salt, and minced garlic to the beef and pepper mixture while it was cooking.

The key is to watch not to overcook the meat.  I used all the suggestions for adding spices and this turned out pretty good.  If anything a little too sweet for my husband so I might cut back on the honey next time.

The beef and peppers were colorful, but would benefit with something either sour or spicy.  The green onions in the rice were good but the chicken stock didn't add much flavor and that will be the last time I use the stovetop to cook the rice as it burned some and undercooked other parts.

This was very good although it does not make a lot of sauce to cover the meat.  I was skeptical on the amount of dijon called for since I am not a fan but the honey balanced out the taste quite nicely.  The rice was fantastic, who knew adding some chopped green onion to rice would give it such a different taste. Will definetly do this dish again.

I made this last night with a few alterations. I did not have any beef, so I used chicken. I also did not finely chop the peppers, but instead kept them in larger chunks. I added onions to the vegetable mixture, which I also seasoned with a bit of garlic powder. Finally, I cooked instant white rice like normal and doubled the honey mustard sauce.

Not being a big fan of mustard I thought the mustard flavor was way over powering.  Even my husband that likes mustard said it was too much but still lacked something.  It looked nice but I won't be making this one again.

I didn't care for the odd combination of ingredients in the meat part of the recipe, however, I continue to use chicken stock and scallions in my rice.
