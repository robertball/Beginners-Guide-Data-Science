I am a huge Paleo follower and I've been longing for a healthy chocolate chip cookie recipe.  This recipe nailed it!  I used all the ingredients except instead of using the dark chocolate chips I substituted a bar and a half of 85% dark chocolate bars.  I used the end of a screwdriver to break up the bar into very small pieces.  I was afraid my cookies would stick to the baking sheet so I sprayed some olive oil on it.  I am so happy to have come across this recipe - delicious!

My husband is a severe critic of anything with coconut flour in it. These cookies surprised both me and my husband, and we enjoyed them very much!  No water needed.  I did refrigerate them for about an hour before baking them so they would be a little more firm to roll into balls.  I do need to say that I halved the recipe (12 servings), and found that the amount of chocolate chips indicated for this amount (1/4 cup plus 2 Tbsp) was way too much...I couldn't get them all to mix into the dough.  Next time I will not add the extra 2 Tbsp if I make that batch size again.  10 minutes was a good time, they were firm on the outside and very soft on the inside.  Next time I might cook them for only 8 minutes to have an even softer outer.  :)

The dough was very hard to work with and the chocolate chips would not stick in the cookies. I finally made it into one big pan cookie with the chips on top and it worked out ok.

Dough was very stiff, so I added 2 TBS coconut milk. Also used 1 TBS maple syrup to increase sweetness. My husband REALLY liked these. Thank you for the recipe.

I Tried some with vanilla and they were too bland.  They definitely need almond extract. In another batch I added walnuts and a bit of chopped raisins. These were keepers:-) With the additions they rate 5 stars.

Specialty flour is expensive, and I’m cheap. I replaced the 2 cup flour, 1/3 cup coconut flour and 2/3 cup coconut flakes with 1 1/2 cup finely food processor-ed quick oats and 1 1/2 cup regular quick oats. It was easier to work with.  I added some baking powder and they even puffed out a bit!

Not a fan. Dough was stiff and bland. I had to add some coconut milk to make it workable and a bit of maple syrup to make them a tad sweeter. I will not make again. There's a bunch of Paleo cookie recipes out there that are easier and tastier.

The batter was the best I've tried so far!  I used Maple Syrup (same amount) instead of honey.  I only had unsweetened chocolate and no matter what I did, the chocolate did not taste good so I skipped it.   (I don't eat sugar).  The cookies without the chocolate were great.  I can't wait to try them with good chocolate!

They are delicious, exceeded my expectations by far. It's so gratifying knowing that they well balanced in terms of ingredients. Can be pricey to make, butbso worth it.

The cookies turned out very dry. I did use a vegan butter as a sub for almond butter but this is not something I will make again.

Very tasty! I starting mixing everything together because I didn't read through the directions first BUT they turned out awesome. So, if you don't feel like following all the steps, throw it together in one bowl & mix with a hand mixer. It is a little dry but delicious. Kids & husband love them!

These cookies are surprisingly good. I added about two teaspoons of water to hold dough together. They are substantial enough that I don't eat too many at one sitting. I may try adding walnuts next time. Really great!

I'd like to try this recipe, but the instructions are incomplete.  When and how do you mix in the flour/coconut combo?  I'm guessing you add it in step 3.  Can someone please clarify?  Thanks!
