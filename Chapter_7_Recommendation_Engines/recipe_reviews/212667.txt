Duck was good. Recipe was complex. I used cranberries instead of raisens.  The only thing I would change is the carrots. They where hard. I believe mushrooms would of cooked better. I added fresh Tyme to my stock. Served with potatoes and applesauce.

This duck was AMAZING! Of course, starting with good products helps, but this recipe resulted in a juicy, well-prepared duck and a wonderful sauce/gravy! I would definitely recommend the recipe!

I made this duck for Christmas and everyone loved it.  I made two ducks, and I doubled the stuffing mixture, plus I added about 1/2 cup of fresh cranberries.  I read the reviews, but I decided to add the carrots to the pan, and next time I would add more carrots and onions to serve with the dinner-they were delicious! 
When I was chopping the onion, I chopped it a little small for the stuffing, and then chopped some larger onion for the pan. Next time I would chop all of the onion somewhat larger.
I made 1 1/2 times the basting sauce (and used white cranberry juice instead of lemon juice) and stock, but it makes a lot of sauce. Next time I would not increase the stock or basting sauce recipe for two ducks. (The sauce was delicious and definitely worth the effort!).

I used Mary's organic duck. I splashed some dry sherry inside and let it sit for 30 min while prepairing the rest. Used more apples and no carrots, following an advise of previous user. Didnit use a lemon juice, but sherry for basting....I added some nutmeg, clove, orange zest, few haselnuts, walnuts and also few pitted sour cherries to stuffing of apples, sweet onion and raisins. Baked duck together with apples in the roasting pan. It came out ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! It was tasting as old world game! Served with rosmary mash pottoes...yammm!

We had never roasted duck before.  For a Christmas dinner for six, we roasted two six-pound ducks following this recipe with only a few changes.  Our ducks were already heavily browned after a half hour, so we lowered them in the oven and covered them with foil.  We removed them from the oven after two hours when the thermometer read 172 degrees F.  In retrospect, we probably should have cooked them longer because the flesh around the bone, though warm, was still reddish pink.  Our stuffing included cranberries, and we sauteed the onions.  Everyone raved over the recipe, which we joined with sauteed brussels sprouts, sauteed spinach, garlic mashed potatoes, red wine, and flan.

Another change we made was to add a second sauce made from a reduction of about one-third cup of balsamic vinegar, one-third cup of raspberry preserves, a splash of red wine, and a splash of chicken stock with salt, pepper, and cinnamon.  (Next time I would probably thicken with cornstarch.)  Boil, then reduce the heat and strain the mixture to remove the seeds.  Our guests preferred this more pungent sauce for the duck.

Thank you Adams Family.

I really enjoyed this recipe as it was my first time trying out duck. However I wasn't a big fan having fruit for the stuffing. I found the fruit inside to taste different than I really thought it would have been.  Other than that I love the taste of the meat. Very flavorful, I would recommend having some red wine!

I also found that duck can really feed only 2. There isn't a lot of meat on duck.

LOVED the Flavor! I have been eating duck on major holidays for going on 20yrs. I really wanted to find a new recipe, and this is it. I will say I did tweak it in the sense I didn't have time for all the step by step stuff. I added all the ingredients to the crock pot and cooked on low for 8hrs. and it was amazing!! I did remove the skin from the bird about an hour before serving and we served with white rice, broccoli and yeast rolls. It was by far one of the best meals we have eaten this month!

I definitely plan on using this duck recipe again :) It was actually my first time making and eating duck! The only thing I did different was make stuffing with the raisin mixture. I was in a hurry shopping  and grabbed cranberry juice infused raisins (never even heard of that) and it tastes even better. I might even make this for every holiday:) it's a little time consuming so, next time I'll debone the duck so it cooks faster. Seriously, anyone reading this you have to use this recipe! It's so simple especially if you like to cook!

I brined my duck first, which I strongly recommend. Then I followed this recipe nearly to a T, just adjusting for taste. It was divine!

I really liked this recipe,  I did cook the duck for 2 hours longer than suggested to extract all the fat, it came out incredible.  Worth the effort

Turned out great! Put the stuffing in the duck stock and rendered it down to make a great sauce.
