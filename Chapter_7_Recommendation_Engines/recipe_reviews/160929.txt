I am a huge fan of Grilled Salmon, and have tried two previous maple-soy glazes. This one is the WINNER! It was just the right balance of salty and sweet. I cut the pepper down just a bit (I have small children) and I actually mixed up the glaze and cooked it on the stove in a saucepan and added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up.  I cooked the salmon on the grill without cedar planks but on foil and when it was 90% done, I brushed the glaze on reserving some for rice and veggies. (I doubled the glaze recipe).  It was terrific. I had a maple soy glaze recipe from Bon Appetite that I had tried but this one is going to be replacing it. Thanks.

This was excellent!  I made a few adjustments to bring more flavor to the salmon and to cook inside rather than out.  I used double couarsely ground salt and pepper and heavily rubbed the top of the salmon.  I also put 1 tsp of ginger and garlic in the glaze mixture.  I then lightly pan-seared the salmon in olive oil on one side, placed the fillets in the oven on broil and basted with the glaze about 4 times for 10 minutes (I prefer my salmon more well done than not). It was easy and quick to make and my guests loved it.

Amazing! For 2 people, chose to broil @ 450 instead. Used 1.25 lbs salmon fillet & cut in 1/2. Skinned it & rubbed salt & pepper on both sides. Seared all sides on stovetop in olive oil. Dbl the glaze amt (used 6 svg measurements) cooked on stove & added cornstarch to thicken. Broiled salmon on broiler pan for 8 min, taking it out every 2 min to baste generously with glaze. Served with brown rice & mixed veggies & extra glaze. YUMMY!!!!! Thank you!

I was surprised how good this turned out, I love the salty and sweet combo.  Everyone had a second helping of this.  Only change I made was that I added minced garlic after reading some of the reviews.  I also served the spinach alfredo rice recipe as a side dish from this website, fantastic!!

I've tried quite a few salmon glaze/marinade type recipes from this website and without a doubt, this is the BEST one out there!  (I even tried a recipe that had 1300 reviews with 5 stars and it couldn't touch this one).  This recipe also makes a great presentation, better than the photo shown.

Excellent recipe. Salmon  was tasty and very moist. I added some garlic to the glaze and the salmon took a little longer than 10 min.  I will make this again.

Perfect glaze for fresh Arctic Char, with just the right balance of sweet, salty, and a little tang from the lime. Baked in the oven at 450C for 10 min per inch of fillet thickness. Mmmmm!

Really enjoyed, however very sweet without a thickening of the  glaze when baked - thin without the caramelized crust I'd hoped for.

Nice combination of flavors but I didn't think this added a whole lot of flavor to the fish. Perhaps if the salmon were marinated in it for a few hours, it would hold more taste. There is a recipe on here for a salmon marinade with brown sugar and soy sauce that we LOVE - I just didn't have time to let the fish soak, so I opted for a glaze, thinking it would work almost as well. I was wrong.

I found this glaze to be far too thin, but of excellent taste. Next time, I'll cook it down on the stove before basting, or use it as a marinade instead. Also goes great on green beans!

I made a few changes to make it lighter and for what I had on hand. I used 1/4 c sugar free maple syrup, 2 T low sodium soy sauce, 1 T Hoisin sauce, 2 T EVOO, 1 T lime juice, 1 t dry mustard, 1 t minced garlic to marinade 4 pieces of salmon in a zip lock bag for an hour. I made another batch of the marinade without measuring this time and used garlic powder instead of minced to brush on the fish when grilling it on foil on the gas grill. My husband wasn't a big fan on salmon but he LOVED this. This is a keeper for us!

My husband is a salmon critic and has had the best cooked salmon in the nation.  This salmon recipe was his all time favorite and the most delicious we have ever had.  The smoked flavor with the maple was incredible.  I didn't change anything from the recipe and we will have it again and again!

This was a really nice way to prepare salmon.  I forgot to use the lime zest and chives, but added garlic & ginger per other reviewers' suggestions.  I saved a bit of the glaze for my husband to put on his after it cooked.  I broiled it in the over rather than grilling. SImply, yet yummy.  Thanks!

Family thought this was only "ok" as every one felt it was too sweet and overpowered the salmon taste.

In all fairness...didn't use cedar planks. So ended up pretty darn bland. Nice idea, though.

MY TASTE BUDS HAVE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY!  Ok, so I "screwed up" the recipe but still loved, loved, loved it!  Next time I "may" follow the recipe but it was sooo good they way I did it that I might repeat my "mistakes".  I used sugar-free maple syrup so I could stick to my diet and used equal parts syrup and soy sauce, which was the "mistake".  Added garlic powder and black pepper per the recipe but than decided to add red pepper flakes.  Ohmigoodness!  Loved the little bit of "bite" that the red pepper flakes added to the sweet/salty taste!  And you can add as much or as little as you like.  Baked in foil pouch for 20 min than broiled for 3.  Literally licked the plate clean!  Thanks for sharing!

I LOVED this.  I cooked the salmon like the review from Ann-Marie.  I made the glaze (and I did NOT use cornstarch to thicken -- just kept basting), seared the salmon in olive oil in a skillet, and then broiled it, basting frequently with the glaze -- until the glaze was quite dark -- almost blackened!  YUM!  It was delicious and very moist in the thickest part of the salmon.  Lovely!  I will make this again and again.  Did not need chives or lemon to finish it off either.

Made in a skillet instead of on a grill. The flavor of the marinade was good, don't get me wrong, but it didn't permeate the fish. It either needs stronger flavors, some long marinating trime or a sauce to pour on top of something, I don't know. I would play with it but there are so many other recipes out there to try that this one wasn't outstading enough for me to try again.

Delicious!  Made this tonight, I had never cooked on a cedar plank before.  Wonderful flavour.  The maple was understated, but you knew it was there. Definitely will do again.

I would actually only give this recipe a 4.5 if I could but if I have to choose between 4 and 5, it is more like a 5. I really enjoyed the sauce and I took the advice of another chef and added some corn starch to thicken the sauce.  But I feel that it needs something.  I can't quite put my finger on it. I'm going to play with adding some ginger or garlic.

Excellent flavor! I used olive oil instead of butter and I marinated the salmon for 1 hour. It turned out fantastic.

The marinade was almost sweet, very subtle, and I needed to grill it longer than 10 minutes.  It was very moist.

This is our to to salmon recipe and nothing compares! I do not cook this on the BBQ. I usually wrap the salmon and sauce in Parchment Paper and put it in the oven at 350 F for 15-20 min.

I'm not a big fish eater but after having this dish at a restaurant in Rhode Island I had to try to replicate it.  This glaze was dead on.  My entire family loved it!  I didn't prepare it on a cedar plank but wrapped it in some foil and placed it on the grill.  When it was about 15 minutes from being done I removed the top section of the foil and brushed on the glaze and let it caramelize.

I love this glaze and use it on salmon and cod during and after cooking.   I  add 1/2 tsp of hot pepper flakes for heat and bring it to a simmer, but I stay with the recipe otherwise.   Delicious!

Great recipe.  I had to serve a meal to accomodate allergies and specific diets, and this one fit the bill perfectly.  The lime flavour came through nicely , however the maple syrup didn't for some reason.

Guys, this was great! And tbh, I skipped the plank and even the grill, one hectic rainy day. The flavors are interesting and tasty and enhance the fish rather than detracting from it. I love the idea of trying it on pork or veggies, too

Excellent taste, magazine-worthy look, ma sha Allah.  I broil it - being directly beneath the flame imparts a delicious, warm hue reminiscent of grilling outdoors.

A note on salmon: I never thought salmon quality mattered much, but wild-caught, never-frozen Alaskan Is. The. Best.  It's so moist and tender that it's still as bright pink and flexible after broiling as before.  In comparison, farm-raised feels like eating a bald tire on the side of the road while fighting off famished vultures.

You'll pay for it, but when cooking for company, you'll find fresh, wild-caught Alaskan worth every penny.

didn't bother with a cedar plank.  I didn't have lime so I used lemon juice/zest.  Marinated for an hour in fridge.  Broiled in oven, basting a few times.  Squeezed lemon juice on top and YUMMMMMMMM...  definitely my favorite salmon dish!!

was looking for a quick salmon recipe. The maple syrup caught my eye and decided to give it a try. Read the other reviews and decided to add the ginger, garlic and corn starch others recommended. Didn't have limes so used lemon juice. Was snowing outside so baked in over at 450 for 10 minutes. So easy and delicious. I am still licking the glaze off the bottom of the plate! Will definitely try it again with the plank and limes.

This was just what I was looking for.  I used tamarind soy sauce and some fresh cilantro.  I took another reviewer's suggestion.  I seared it in a sauté pan. Then broiled about third rack from broiler.  10 mins, basting every two minutes.  Then just before done, I put it close to boiler to brown more.  Then I added some cornstarch to the remaining sauce to thicken.  Yummy

I've used allrecipes for years, and this is my very first review. This recipe was so good that I just had to rate it. Made it exactly as the recipes says and it came out perfect. The best salmon I've ever had (and we eat it a lot!) Even my 1 year old kept asking for more. This will be my go-to recipe from now on.
