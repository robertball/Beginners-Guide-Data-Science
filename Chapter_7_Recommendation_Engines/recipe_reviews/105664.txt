Easy and extremely tasty.  I didn't have 16 rosemary sprigs, but I had no trouble putting 3 or 4 shrimp on each.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe tonight. I think it's the best shrimp we've ever cooked at home and it's so easy. We didn't add the sea salt because it didn't need it. Thanks for a great recipe!

These make for a wonderful presentation with 1-2 shrimp per skewer - perfect for appetizers at a party.  As part of a meal, I lay the rosemary skewers over a bed of seasoned rice or barley (love it with the barley bake - recipe on this site).

The rosemary imparts a surprisingly strong flavor!  I couldn't taste the thyme and am not sure if marinating the shrimp beforehand really gives it much additional flavor - next time I'll probably skip this step.

The flavors are great and this dish cooks very quickly. I recommend using fresh jumbo shrimp.

What a great meal- healthy and bursting with flavor.  The only thing I changed was to add 2 shrimp per sprig of rosemary.  Thanks, I will be making this one again.

Excellent recipe!  I cheated and put the shrimp in a grilling basket and laid the rosemary over the shrimp and it was fantastic!

So delicious and easy too! I also put 2-3 shrimp per sprig of rosemary. I did use the sea salt because I love salt.

It was delightful. I go out to eat a lot, and I would pay good money for this dish. The only thing I would only add a small pinch of, is the sea salt. I didn't think that went to well, with the other wonderful spices. The rosemary added a wonderful aroma, and set the mood, aswell.
