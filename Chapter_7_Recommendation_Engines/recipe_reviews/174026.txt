This is really a 4+. What a wonderful way to use eggplants! The recipe is easy, if you have the appropriate Indian spices on hand. I would agree with the former reviewer about bumping up the tomato and coconut. My eggplant turned out a bit tough-skinned. I've never cooked eggplant, so I wonder if it would be smart to peel it like a potato or cucumber? With rice, naan, and a salad, this would be a fabulous meal.

Used two eggplants, fried in two batches. Used a small can of green chiles, omitted fenugreek, used onion powder (didn't have kalonji), 2/3 can tomato paste and water, and dried cilantro. Also doubled the coconut milk. Sprinkled with cashews, served over brown rice with naan. My mom dislikes Indian food and she LOVED this!! I was impressed by this recipe myself! Try it, it's delicious!!

Very good, would definitely make again.  I doubled the tomatoe puree and the coconut milk because I like these types of recipes a little saucier.  Next time, I will probably substitute lamb or chicken for the eggplant for a different twist.

This was my first attempt at Indian cooking and I have to say it was a huge success!  This dish is absolutely delicious.  Because I didn't have some of the spices on hand I used a good curry which I browned slightly in the skillet and the flavor was excellent. I did omit the oil using a nonstick skillet. I have to give this one 5 stars.

I didn't have all the ingredients but just made up for what I missed.  I had mostly what I needed and it was delicious and easy.  It was a nice hearty dish too so I don't need to make any meat.  I'll definitely make it again.

Pretty good. I tried it the first time with Asian eggplant. You don't need to sweat the eggplant nor do you need to remove the skin. I also tried it with run of the mill eggplant, sweated and skin removed, also good. :) IMO, coconut milk is not necessary to make this delish.

I love this recipe and have been making it for years. I admit, like many other reviewers, I donâ€™t use all the appropriate spices, but I make do with what I have. I highly recommend for anyone about to make this is try their best to use fenugreek though, as it really gives this dish a wonderful flavor. I also always use an entire can of coconut milk, not just the half cup as listed in the recipe. I always eat this dish with basmati rice. The whole meal comes together really quickly given how complex the flavors are; it tastes like something that would take hours.

Very tasty. I didn't have the onion seed. I added some onion powder but not sure if it's anywhere near similar flavor. I followed the recipe and it came our very well. I was just looking for someplace to try the fenugreek spice I happened to buy. Wow, what a great result!

This was really good, even my husband who doesn't care for eggplant liked it.  I also increased the tomato and coconut milk and added urad  dahl just because I love the texture it gives.   I peeled the eggplant as well and served over brown rice.  Thanks for the tips and thanks for the recipe.  I'll def be making again in the near future!

Fantastic. I added a bit more spice than suggested and had to substitute flavored oils/spices for the seeds, but it was so delicious regardless. I wish I could rate this 100 stars.

Loved the flavor! I did not have coconut milk, kalonji or a chili pepper; it'll probably taste a lot better with those ingredients.
6 tablespoons is a little over a 1/3 cup of oil - quite a lot. I had to use a slotted spoon to serve it. I used more eggplant than called for, and even used 2 celery stalks, leftover from a different eggplant recipe hoping they would be coated and use some oil. Still pretty oily. Is it supposed to be that way, or did I miss something? I am not at all familiar with Indian cooking.(I switched to olive oil - I figured if I was using that much, it might as well be something "healthier.") I'm definitely making it again, though - my neighbor has a bumper crop of eggplants this year!

Very good recipe. I had to make a few alterations. I did not have coconut milk, tomato puree, green chile pepper, or kalonji. I  also added 1 pound of tofu and 1 cup of black beans. I friend the eggplant and tofu in coconut oil until golden, proceeded with the recipe as directed substituting 1 green pepper (for the green chile), 2 cans of tomato sauce, and almond milk. I added the black beans when I returned the eggplant to the mixture. I served over rice. I will be making this again. One note, this is a milder dish (keeping in mind I did not use a chile). If you like a very spicy dish you may want to make a few adjustments.

Sliced eggplant into batons and grilled it on my cast iron griller to save on calories. Added some chat masala at the end of cooking to give it a bit of a zing. Very yummy.

I baked the eggplant instead of frying. I would rate this 5 stars if there was more sauce, which I love! Great recipe, will make again!

Delicious. I made it as shown except I did not have the onion seeds. Regarding amounts, I added a half can of tomato sauce and a half can of Chaokoh coconut milk and that was perfect. I made sure to cook the eggplant very well, because I like it mushy. One of my favorite vegan Indian dishes.

Very tasty; I liked the blend of all the spices. I would definitely double the tomatoes (and I used canned, diced) and the coconut milk. Maybe to make it a bit more tangy, I would add some vinegar or even more tomatoes. I made this again, and this time used almond milk in place of the coconut milk, and it was fine. Very good.

Great base recipe! I took the advice of others here and added more crushed tomatoes and coconut milk. This is exactly what I needed in my life right now and forevermore. I served this with fine leftover biryani rice and it is a magnificent combination.

Yum!  My eggplant was very large, and once I added onion (1 1/2) and tomatoes (1 can diced), this made quite a bit more than I expected.  Which was good, because I took it with my lunches all week!  Subbed onion powder for onion seed and only used 1/4 cup coconut milk, as I needed the rest of the can for another recipe.  Tasty addition to my Indian recipe collection!

The sauce was great, but my eggplant turned out spongy and watery. Could be it was not a great eggplant - but TBH I always have trouble with eggplant. Why do I keep buying them?

The sauce could have used a bit more heat, and I think I didn't season it quite enough. I added some jarred coriander chutney and pickled garlic from the Indian grocery, and it was perfect.

I had sesame, but not the other seeds, so I added about 1/2 tsp. of ground cumin.  I used 1cup of light coconut milk and pureed two ripe tomatoes to make 1 cup as others suggested.
I also salted, rinsed, then lightly brushed my eggplant slices  with olive oil  and cooked in the oven at 400 degrees, turning halfway to save some calories. 
My husband and I really enjoyed this over rice.

The recipe is great, very authentic and easy enough to prepare... bf was not a fan so I was left with considerable leftovers...which made a great soup! I added about 1/2 cup of red cargo rice and a quart or so of chicken broth and it made a great lunch soup! Thanks for the interesting recipe!
