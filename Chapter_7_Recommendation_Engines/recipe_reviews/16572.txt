I didn't find these cookies that good.  I must have burned the chips or something.

My mother always made these for Christmas when I was a child to bring to my aunt's annual party on Christmas Eve.  Her's had CASHEWS in addition to the butterscotch and noodles and she called them "Chinese Chews", which I am sure she didn't make up herself.  I think I have heard them called "Haystacks" also.

WAY TOO SWEET!  I would either add more chowmain noodles, or add in peanuts like others suggested.  Make sure your haystack is SMALL.  They are way too rich and sweet to eat a big one.
I will make these again but with the suggested changes.

I LOVE these things. I didn't think I was much of a butterscotch fan but I guess I am because I couldn't stop eating these! I only use 1c butterscotch chips and about 8oz noodles (or as many as can be lightly coated) otherwise I think they'd be way too sweet. I add about 1 tsp shortening to the chips & melt them in the microwave on low. They are good with cashews or peanuts but they are wonderful plain too. If you make them small & more flat than round, they are easier to eat. Super fast & easy to make!

I melted the butterscotch chips in the microwave on 70% power, stirring frequently instead of on the stovetop. Made these as a birthday treat for my butterscotch-loving grandson...he was a happy camper. Thansk for the recipe Shayna Rice!

How easy can you get! This is great for kids.  Parents do not have to supervise much in this activity.  Some people refer to these as haystacks.  They are a quick, fun, no nonsense snack.  If you are in a bind for a dish to bring to a scout meeting..make this!

This recipe was pretty good. My only complaint was that the cookies fell apart while you were eating them making a lot of crumbs. Beyond being messy, they were great. A little sweet for my taste, but I should have known that going in.

Great recipe!  I, too, followed others' suggestions and put in 1/4 cup of chocolate chips and 1 3/4 cup of butterscotch chips.  Thanks for this recipe!  Easy to make and easy clean up!

I've liked these since I was a kid.  Sometimes we mix in 1/4 chocolate chips and reduce the amount of butterscotch and it adds some depth of flavor.

We love these.  But I do use twice the amount of noodles, ADD 1/2 cup of semi sweet chips and chopped cashews (because we don't all like peanuts).

I remembered having these while growing up, but never figured out how to make them.  I'm glad it's just that easy!  I hope my kids will love them as much as I do.

It doesnâ€™t get any simpler than this. . . and yummy too.  I came across this recipe when I was looking for a way to use up some leftover ingredients that had been in my pantry too long.   I had enough ingredients to make half the recipe.  I microwaved the butterscotch chips for two minutes at half power, stirring once in the middle and then at the end, then just stirred in the noodles.  Fast & easy.

We LOVED this recipe, but I added peanuts to it.  Instead of using the stove, I just melted the chips in the microwave, and it only took a couple of minutes!

Made exactly as written. Broke up chow mein noodles into smaller pieces before adding to the melted butterscotch morsels. I did press down each cookie for uniformity. Came together and set up perfectly. Lovely presentation. This was added to the bundle of food gifts I gave to my children and grand children for Christmas this year. They were too sweet for me and mine. For our tastes, next year I will experiment with adding more chow mein noodles, add a bit more peanut butter as well as roasted peanuts to cut down on the sweetness as well as making them smaller.

This is probably my all-time favorite cookie and have been making it for years, except with a few variations.  My family melts 1 cup of peanut butter with the butterscotch chips, and we also add mini marshmallows and/or chopped peanuts.  Super easy to make and some darn delicious!

These are a quick & unique treat that are so easy to make.  You can also prepare with milk chocolate chips, but they don't set as quickly.
