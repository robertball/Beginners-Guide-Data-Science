Great recipe and standard for elderberry syrup.  You do NOT want to cut down on the honey.  It is not just used to sweeten the syrup.  Raw honey is a powerhouse, having anti-viral, anti-fungal and anti-bacterial properties.  It has many other good uses as well, wound care, antihistamine, burns, boost immunity, reduces cholesterol, controls blood sugar levels and many more!

I'm giving this 5 stars for the medicinal value alone and was tasty, but with that said I thought the honey was a bit overpowering (for me.) That's easily fixed, I will use less honey next time or half honey and corn syrup. If you're looking for a thick syrup- this isn't.  I added a cornstarch slurry. The ratio is 1 teas cornstarch to 1 Tb. cold water per cup of berry liquid; add to hot mixture and cook a bit. I also added 1 to 2 tb. fresh lemon juice, thought it gave another flavor element. I enjoyed some of the syrup in my lemonade, sort of took on a gourmet flavor and a beautiful color. Really liked the optional spices when added.

I thought the honey was a bit overpowering and will use about 1/2 the amount next time.  I made a double batch and had to simmer it for about an hour and a half to get it to reduce down to half.  I've been giving each of the kids about a tsp each day and taking a Tbsp for myself.  Lets hope it keeps the colds and flus away!!

I made no changes- except for using half the amount of dried elderberries as fresh, and leaving out the ginger root. I also added the full amount of raw honey to the warm elderberry syrup. I bought a few pounds of dried elderberries on Amazon that weren't too expensive so I could make this recipe. I tripled the recipe and simmered it for an hour and a half. Then I water bath canned it for 20 minutes so I can preserve it and give away as needed during the cold and flu season. A triple batch made 2 quarts and 6 pints. I take a Tablespoon daily as a preventative to colds and flu. Or, you can take a Tablespoon every 2-3 hours at the first sign of illness. It's delicious and amazingly effective for illness! And its WAY cheaper to make your own than to buy it- I have looked and seen that a half pint goes for about 4 dollars! AND you know what's in your own :) Thanks for sharing this recipe- it's definitely a keeper!

My elderberry syrup is steeping as I type.  Two things: I accidentally dumped in twice the amount of dried elderberries as are called for ...so I doubled my recipe.  Also, I decided to steep the solids first and add the honey after straining them out.  I think I will lose less of the honey-goodness that way.  (In addition, if I use raw honey, I can avoid cooking it with this method!)

I read the reviews before I made this and cut way back on the honey.  I tripled the recipe (3 cups berries to 9 cups water) and only added about 3/4 cup of honey in the end.  The result was perfect.  Just a tad sweet and a nice compliment to the cinnamon/clove/ginger flavor.  Also, I didn't have cinnamon sticks or whole cloves so I added ground cinnamon and the same with the cloves being sure not to go too heavy on them.  I did have fresh ginger.  This turned out to be more juice than syrup, but I suppose you could boil it for much longer to get more of a syrup consistency.

We did not like the ginger.  Tried it again with no ginger and a few more cinnamon sticks and it turned out much better.
