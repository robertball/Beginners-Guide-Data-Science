It's funny....this is the second recipe I've come across this week that I first saw in a 1963 cookbook published by the Farm Journal. (The other recipe is for Ambrosial Jam which is fabulous - peaches, oranges, lemons, cantaloupe and pineapple - YUM). The point is I guess that classic recipes never die. Rummage Relish is just the thing for all of the green tomatoes in my garden.

I made this last week and it turned out great!  I cut the vegetables in the late evening and put it in the fridge overnight. The next morning it was ready to make into relish. This will be great on hot dogs or in potato salad. I made a half batch and ended up with 7 jelly jars of relish. I will make this again when I run out!

This is a great recipe to use an abundance of green tomatoes. Here in Houston tomato season is over at the end of June, but we're still getting peppers and cukes, so everything except the cabbage and onions came fresh from the garden. I did salt the veggies and squeezed them dry, but did not rinse. I also cut the sugar in half as my family doesnt care for sweet relishes/pickles. Used a small food processor to roughly chop veggies. Wish I had a bigger one. Tasty, fragrant and visually appealing product. My house smells fantastic. Excellent spice combo/ flavors. This will be standard end of tomato season fare!

I found this recipe in a 1943 WWII Ball Blue Book. I made it yesterday and it is fantastic! The yield was 10 + 1/2 pints after simmering and then draining some of the liquid off. I processed it for 20 minutes. The jars are beautiful and worthy of gift giving.

I made this recipe, added 1 teaspoon turmeric and 1 tablespoon of grated fresh ginger (instead of the dried ginger) also used whole cloves with 1 teaspoon allspice berries in cheesecloth.  Other ingredients as given in the recipe, but only used 3 cups of sugar and it was very sweet.  Tasted it after it was finished and it was amazing.  Absolutely the best.

There was a sudden unforeseen weather change here in Chicago that I had a lot of green tomatoes and didn't know what to do with them when I bumped into this recipe while surfing the net.  I followed the instructions with all the ingredients and spices listed, and oh boy! It was the best relish recipe I ever had.  I intend to plant more tomatoes in late summer next  year  so I can harvest more green tomatoes and make more of this delightful relish, and maybe add some hot peppers too.   I just wish I could have shared this recipe with my mom and my aunts who were great cooks during their times back in the day.  Thank you so much for posting.

This is also known as Piccalilli Relish. The first time I had it, it was made by my Great-Grandmother and Grandmother in the early 70s. My mother and I have been making it since she passed bc it is so good and nothing can be found comparable in the grocery stores even though the label may say Piccalilli Relish or Piccalilli Pickle. The store bought versions are terrible compared to this homemade relish.

Delicious. Made it just as the recipe called for. I did add more hot peppers as we like hot. Itâ€™s perfect.

I did not have quite the same ingredients as last year but I cant tell the difference in the great taste. It will be one of my favorites
