I haven't eaten chorizo in decades because of the fat content. This recipe has convinced me to reintroduce this delicious sausage in my diet. I used it in another recipe, therefore not following step two, and my family loved it. I used Mexican oregano, smoked paprika, and New Mexico chile powder. Thank you for the recipe.

I love the flavor of chorizo, but I don't really care to eat red meat so this twist with turkey was perfect for me.   I used it to make a Picadillo recipe instead of regular chorizo which was a huge hit at our taco bar.  I made it into chorizo breakfast patties that perfectly  offset the sweet breakfast bread pudding I served them with.  While this will never be an exact copy of the real thing the flavor profile hits most of the notes I wanted and really lends itself to adding that depth of flavor real chorizo is known for.

My whole family enjoyed this recipe, but next time I make it, Iâ€™ll reduce the amount of oil and salt, even if that makes it less like chorizo.

I did make it and added a little more olive oil than the recipe called for. I am familiar with turkey and how dry it gets. I also added cayenne pepper instead of dried red peppers, I did not have any. I also did not use an orange. All in all, the meat was juicy and tender. We made taco salad and a pita Mexican pizza. I would definitely make this recipe again.
