I used chopped garlic, and omitted the BBQ sauce.  I served tomato slices on the side.  This is great dish!

I loved them, it was a nice way to eat all the proteins and vegetables that we need and the kids ate them like nothing. It is the first time I dont battle with the lentils. Ha!

Great recipe! I split the pita as directed, used BBQ sauce on one side, and put hummus on the other side, I think both go great with this mix. Will make this again for sure, super simple, super delicious.
