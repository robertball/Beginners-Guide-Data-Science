We have used this recipe for years.  There is no better anywhere!!  We are not fans of anything sweet when it comes to meat but this gentle sweetness is insane when combined with the red pepper flakes.  We don't use liquid smoke but throw it on the grill with a few chunks of wood for 30 minutes and it is perfect.

Used this recipe to the letter for 5lbs of deer heart.  Recipe scaled up very well.  

Be sure to use the recommended amount of Morton Tender Quick salt, and go sparingly on the liquid smoke.   Too much of either will make it inedible.

I had the smoker going all of Memorial Day Weekend and decided to empty the venison out of the freezer. I did use a smoker instead of the oven but this recipe is spot on for venison jerky.
