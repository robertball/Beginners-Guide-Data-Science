AWESOME!  My husbands family grew up in the greater Bing. area and he loves when we go to the "cabin" and get Speedies.  I was thrilled when i stumbled across this recipe to be able to re-create this for him.  I made them and took them camping.  Super easy and super tasty.  This will be a regular for us.  I followed the recipe as is.  Thanks!

JOYBOWES you made my day! I have so many memories of summertime based around spiedies and salt potatoes being mostly raised in the same area of New York too...I have no idea why I never thought it could be possible to break this recipe down. I thought I'd be forever doomed to Salimedas State Fair bottle hoarding when I went there for visits. You get my first review, this really is a great recipe! On a side note...you'll appreaciate this, my boyfriend is from Long Island and I took him out upstate one summer and he found a spiedie booth and asked...whats a SPY_EDDIE? He fell in love with them too...not for the faint of heart. I'd say if you've never tried them only marinate them a day to see how powerful a kick you like, especially with small pieces of chicken it can be overwhelming to some. Wash it down with a cocktail? That helps too! Thanks again Joy!

We loved these!!!! We weren't able to grill so we baked at 350 for about 10 min depending on the size of your cuts... we had fresh chocolate mint plants in the back yard that we subbed for the dried mint and it turned out great, even though it wasn't "dried". Everything else we followed exactly. I'm sure grilled would be amazing! I'm so glad I stumbled up on this recipe. Absolutely delicious!

I went a little off course, squeezed a whole lemon, and divided it into 2 gallon containers, left the skin in the marinade, 1/2 cup fresh basil made this puppy sing.  Instead of the mint, I added fresh rosemary, and did not use garlic salt.  I did crush 2 more cloves of garlic before I minced them, and added sea salt.  I also did one container with the white vinegar, and another with the red.  With the red wine vinegar I was able to cook the meat to 160 which is standard anyway and keep the moisture intact, not to mention it was a little richer in flavor.  I had rave reviews, and with the red wine vinegar ones people thought I stole Lupo's recipe.

Coming from the Greater Binghamton area, We LOVE spiedies! This is a great recipe. Many restuarants in our area have built off from the original recipes and added condiments to create dozens of different versions, but the original versions are our pride and joy. Thanks so much for adding this as I didn't have time to throw my own recipe on here to share.

This is a good recipe and I know Binghamton is proud of their spiedies - but in acuality this is just another kind of shish kabob. I love shish kabob (or kabobs of any kind)and have collected quite a few marinades for them it.  As a preference I prefer to eat this on a plate with grill onions and green peppers and then shake some hot sauce on it and serve it with a Tzatziki sauce.  I use Tzatziki Sauce I from this site but there are quite a few that you can choose from.  Just eating these plain on hero bread didn't do it for us -have to use some condiments!  Thanks submitter.

To be honest, I would give this 3 stars, but that's because I made the stupid mistake of making this with that hideous "lemon juice" that comes in the yellow plastic lemon-shaped squeezy thing. As a result, it had a weird nasty chemically disinfectant taste. Yuck. Other than that, this was ok. I'll make it again with real lemon juice.

Spiedies are great.  I tend to use fresh spices as opposed to the dried versions.

I am originally froom Central NY, Cortland, and now live in Florida. No one has ever heard of Spiedies or the NY State Spiedie Sauce.  We have had visitors bring a gallon to us.  I love everyones comments. Anxious to make this in time for The SuperBowl. I too have marinated for 5 days and gives you a big punch. LOVE this site.

This was delicious and just the recipe I needed.  I followed it except for the cooking.  I cut the chicken into large cubes, marinated one day, and baked at 350F for seven minutes.

Very good flavor and perfect for summer grilling.  Followed this recipe exactly as written.  I marinated the chicken from Friday afternoon to Sunday evening and served on toasted hot dog buns. It was good without any condiments, as suggested by the submitter, but I think next time I will serve them with Cucumber Raita to make it a little creamier.

I love spiedies! I am so grateful for this recipe. I am from the greater Binghamton and grew up eating them. I've used this with pork tenderloin and chicken. So, so good. It's a little taste of home in Indiana.

These were yummy!  Made a 1/2 batch and left out mint (did not have) and marinated for 24 hours.  They were flavorful and moist, just right.  Will use the leftovers to top a salad tonight.

This was excellent and tasted as I remembered them from NYS. We cooked them on George Forman and they were not dry. I didn't change a thing for the marinade.

I made this and used chicken breast chunks.  I broiled them in the oven since is was raining outside.  It was very tender and delicious!  I let it marinate for 5 days.  I've now made another batch but this time am using london broil chunks.

Thank you for your recipe. These were like my mother in law made! My husband grew up in Binghamton area. His Grandparents lived on Maple St in Endicott for 60+ years. Speidies are truly a part of the culture in the area. We lived in the area for 13 yrs and I fell in love with them- ate them made from lamb, pork, chicken and venison. The challenge is finding the bread on the West Coast where we live now. Our five sons & daughter will be here this weekend with families and we are having or own Speidie Fest!

Made these the other night after they had marinated for a good 48 hours.  Even though it was in the 20's outside my fiance grilled them.  They were very good, very strong but good flavor.  We didn't have the italian bread to make them authentic but they were still good.  Next time I would definitely have some on hand - it would probably mellow them put a bit.  But I love strong marinade flavor so I liked them without it.  Thanks for the recipe.  Never heard of them before.  Will make again - probably in the summer when its warmer out!

Wonderful!! I had never had a spiedie before but my husband wanted me to make them for him. This is the first recipe I tried and the only ingredient change I made was to use onion powder instead of the mint. My husband tried a bite and said..."this is exactly what they should taste like". Score!! He likes to have a little juice with his meat, so instead of grilling I sauted the chicken in my wok with a little extra sauce. It worked just fine! I also cut the meat small and it only sat for 5 hours. It flavored the meat well in that short of time although next time I will definitely use a full day!

this was too good to be true.  i'm from syracuse, ny so spiedies are a regular thing around here--- had family in town from rochester (1 1/2 hrs away) who hadn't heard of spiedies.  my first attempt at making them myself-had them marinating for only one night and this was sooo good. only thing i found was that i used ziploc bags to marinate/hold chicken.  used like 4 bags inside eachother and it STILL leaked.  thought i was saving dishwasher space.. next time i will definately be using one of my pyrex containers.  so that was my own fault :(  will absolutely be making this over and over and over again!

I only use the lemon and mint when I do these with lamb. Plus I use red wine vinegar. If you use chicken, they will be ready as soon as one day in the marinade. Heavier meat like pork, lamb and venison need the whole 3 days so that the vinegar tenderizes the meat. Any day with spiedies is a good day. Best eaten on Jimmy Roma's italian bread which you can only get in Endicott.

I grew up in Endicott, NY just outside of Binghamton.  Spiedies represent summertime to me.  I left Broome Country many years ago and didn;t eenjoy spiedies often for many years.  In recent years my sister mpved back up north and sends me Lupo's original spiedie sauce a couple of times per year but that never last long around our house.  This recipe is great and helps us get through summer down south!  Use fresh herbs and don't omit the mint if you want to taste them as they were meant to be.

This is a fantastic recipe for spiedies! I love spiedie salads and I was thrilled when I found this recipe. Now I can make them at home anytime and I use fresh ingredients from the garden when I can. Absolutely delicious as written! I also love how versatile this is. I sometimes add red pepper flakes or some minced cayenne or jalapeno pepper for a little kick! Thank you so much for the submission!

I first tried Spedies from a Roadside Vendor on Rt 17 just outside Binghamton.Then I found Loupos in Endicott.These were great. Made them at home & they turned out wonderful.They are well worth making.Everyone loved them.Marinade them,grill them, eat them on a sub or hogie roll.I saved the marinade,cooked it on the stove, and drizzled the sauce on the meat.Instead of using White Vinegar in the recipe,I use White Wine Vinegar.

Yummy, I made this w/fresh herbs, more lomen juice, no garlic salt, and no mint (didn't have any) and marinated chicken breast pieces for 48 hours. Really good, and much healthier then the bottled kind. Trying it again this weekend and sticking closer to the original recipe.

I didn't have any mint so I skipped it and it was really good. Too cold outside to grill so I baked the pieces at 350 for 30 minutes. My whole family, including two picky kids loved it. I marinated it for about 48 hours. I can't wait until I can make this again.

My husband and I love these.  The longer they marinate the better as far as we're concerned.  We usually eat them with pita bread and hummus or tzatziki.  This is one that I marinate early in the week and look forward to.

While I've never actually made this myself, my husband grew up 20 miles outside binghamton, NY and these were a staple for his family. When he moved out to CA, my the whole family talked about them. Well, my mother in law made this recipe, and OMG, they're right!

My old next door neighbor grew up in the Endicott area and he used make these like twice a month. He used 'Lupo's' or 'State Fair' sauce --he even sent us some as a christmas gift after we moved! These are now a tradition in our family as well! Love em. this recipe is perfect! He taught us to serve them on sliced italian bread with roasted red peppers on top....YUMMY!!!!! I've used white wine and red wine vinegar before, & I usually leave out the mint, (just not a fan of it.)---very good recipe!

I am only giving this a 3 because of operator error...lol...I overcooked my Spiedies!  LOL....anyway....this is a great and very tasty marinade....I did marinate chunks of very lean, fatless, skinless pork.....they became very dry on the grill even though I marinated them for over 24 hours.....again because I overcooked them....the meat was tough.....I will try again and use chicken.  Thanks for a tasty marinade!

The flavor was good but these were very dry - and not from overcooking them.  I could almost feel how dry they were when I put them on the skewers.  I think it may be from the white vinegar.  Next time I think I will try white wine vinegar or less lemon juice.

Yum!  Great marinade-I only marinated for 24 hours (the oliva oil mixture was congealed after one night). The chicken was tender and flavorful.  Also, I broiled these kabobs for 20 minutes on high in my oven as it was raining the night I made these.

Not 5 star good, but quite good.  Soaked 2 days in the marinade.  I admit, I skipped the mint also.  We enjoyed the sandwich and the kids like the chicken skewers.

Having grown up in the Binghamton area, I've been eating spiedies all my life, but certainly not as often since moving away. These were very good, and thank you Joy for the recipe. I had a cookout yesterday and my guests loved them! The only change I will try next time is more garlic and black pepper, at least a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon. But all in all it was great to bring a little Binghamton to Philadelphia. Thanks again!

LOVED this recipe. Next time I'll use a little less lemon and vinegar but other than that it was great. I made shish kebabs with it and served it with orzo seasoned with Greek seasoning and lemon juice then topped with parmesan chese. A new favorite!!

Fantastic!  This is similar to a fancy restaurant version of souvlaki and the family loved it.  I marinated the chicken for 2 days, and also tried it with some beef.  The flavour was very good.  I was a bit hesitant about the mint as I have never used mint in cooking, but it added a subtle touch and was not at all overdone.
I served the meal with Spicy Yogurt Dip on the side, and a salad.
Thanks for sharing!

* the last time I made this I didn't have any mint, so I used organic spearmint tea and the flavour was even better!

Having been born and raised in the Binghamton, NY area, I'm very familiar with Spiedies. The best ones were cooked over a small grill outside of small taverns on the north side of Endicott, NY (a stone's throw from Binghamton). Fresh herbs do not make a "real" spiedie, you must use dried for the authentic taste, and if it's not served on a slice of fresh Italian bread, again, it's not a spiedie. All of that said, this is a good recipe though the best are made with the Spiedie sauces made in the Binghamton area.

I made this recipe as closely as I could (substituted the olive oil for vegetable oil, and the lemon juice was replaced by lime juice.)

That said, this was absolutely delicious. I shared with a friend from the Binghamton area and he loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this 3x now. It is delicious!! I used only 1 teaspoon of salt, omitted the garlic salt and used garlic powder instead.  I also increased the cloves of garlic to 7. (no Dracula in this house!) I also used fresh mint from my garden. I put the most recent batch in the freezer and will use in a few days to see if the flavor and meat consistently is the same. I read that it should last up to 9 months in the freezer....we shall see.

This was excellent! I only marinated for 3 hours but chicken was super tender, the tang from the vinegar came through and blended well with all the seasonings. I did reduce all the ingredients by half for 2.5 pounds of chicken. Had to do the cooking in broiler as my gas grill ran out of gas. Would have been fantastic grilled.

I can see where someone might say these were no big deal but for us they were different than any chicken I have put on the grill before. The ingredients are things I usually have on hand which is a bonus. The marinade makes tangy little grilled bites of goodness. I will definitely be putting these in our chicken rotation.

The written down version of stuff we like to do always surprises me. This is one of those things we do often and is a familiar friend on the weekends. 
I made this according to the recipe and added a cut up fresh serrano pepper to the marinade. It came out well and was a tasty addition to the pork ribs an smoked fish we enjoyed that day. Thanks. Nice recipe!

Delicious. Added in 1 tablespoon of sugar since I used more lemon. Did not use basil or mint just 1 tablespoon of Italian seasoning with lots of oregano and fresh minced garlic. Salt and pepper with red pepper too which gave it a zing! Cooked it up stove top. Put it in a whole wheat wrap and sprinkled garlic salt on top then diced cucumbers and onions.  Spectacular. Ate 3 in one day so yummy. A nice lemony garlicky yogurt sour cream mayo sauce would have been nice on top too but I kept it simple. Thinking of making it again so yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!!! I actually used Red Wine Vinegar instead and forgot to get mint, so went without. Also, I am really bad about remembering to take pictures (sorry). I will be adding this to my more frequently used dishes. It is as close as I have gotten to re-creating my favorite Chicken Kabob dish at Zorba's Restaurant in OKC.

I love this! It is good cold as leftovers. I only omitted the basil because my husband does not care for it. I have made this several times and is is a fast family favorite.

Good marinade.  Not really different than most, but good none the less.  Important to have speedies small...not like the usual large kabob pieces.... and also with no veggies don't have to worry about uneven cook times on every type of item on the kabob.  Speedies are just that....speedy and delicious!!

Growing up in the Southern Tier of NY we had spiedies at pretty much every get together during the summer.  Not having the bottles of sauce readily available here in Massachusetts, I decided to try this recipe and make my own marinade. I let the chicken marinate for 2-1/2 days and served on hot dog rolls.  Italian bread is more authentic, but the rolls are a little easier I think.  I served to my friends at a cookout this weekend and received all-around good reviews.  I did not add mint, but might do that if I were to make lamb, otherwise followed the recipe.

Thanks for the recipe! Had spiedies for the first time at a friends birthday party in Charlotte, NC. Now they have been introduced to South Carolina! Made them 3 or 4 times now. Might be becoming a pro! Making a batch for a little vacation and tried putting wings in with the marinade this time, SPIEDIE WINGS!

Wonderful! Like so many others, I once lived in upstate NY (Owego) and spiedies were part of our summers. My sister still lives there and I often asked her to send me sauce. Now I make my own and love them with chicken. We're having a salad bar gathering at our house this weekend, to welcome spring. After some wine tasting, we'll settle in for healthy salads. My husband is vegetarian but the rest of us will love adding the yummy bites of chicken to our salads. Oh, and I find it interesting, don't you, that so many of us USED to live there! I've lived in VT, CA, and now WA since those early days!

This is great. I am from upstate NY, but live in Florida now.  I still "import" Salamida brand sauce in the bottle from time to time. This recipe is very close to that.

Oh yeah! I AM NOT from NY... but have visited many times. My corporate office is in Elmira. I was introduced to Spiedies by one of the transplants to our NC branch. Instant love! I had guys bringing bottles of spiedie sauce down every time a work truck came this way. Local grocery store sells Salamida Spiedie Sauce, but at $5 a bottle it was getting way too pricey. This recipe rocks. I have tweaked it a bit to suit my personal tastes. We keep a couple of bottles of homemade sauce on the counter to use as salad dressing. My bride soaks her turkey burgers in it before she cooks them. AWESOME! We also use it for stir fry with a bit of extra olive oil.

This is really GOOD. I am a Southern raised cook, with a touch of Yankee ( My Dad is from the North ). I don't have a grill, so I put mine on a grate and under the broiler. If it's any better off the grill I would love to eat it. Try it and enjoy !

This is a great recipe, though I found that I had to add a lot more vinegar in to make it taste as sharp as the original. I happened to have two original bottles that I was using and ran out of sauce and used this recipe to make some more. I left some in reserve so I could compare the two and the original spiedie's has a lot more vinegar in it. Unfortunately I was pouring and tasting as I went so I didn't have a actual measurement but I'd guess I at least added another cup. I also used apple cider as that was what the ingredients on the bottle said.

I grew up in Endicott NY and my mother made spiedies all the time.  She had acquired the recipe from a friend who was from Italy and settled in Endicott.  I feel pretty sure her recipe was authentic.  This is the closed recipe I have seen to hers.  The main difference I noticed is her recipe called for 1.5 cups of oil to 1/2 cup vinegar. I do not marinate chicken for more than 4 hrs because the vinegar and lemon juice actually cook the meat. We always had them on Italian Bread.  Bon Appetit

I cut the recipe in half and added a bit more garlic, but other than that I made this recipe as directed.   only marinated one day and think that longer might have been better. Also, I think I will give them a shot with fresh herbs next time. Eating them did remind me of being in upstate NY!

Easily my favorite recipe I have ever found anywhere. It's a strange, powerful aroma that's nearly off-putting (You have large amounts of mint, lemon juice, vinegar, basil, and garlic--so of course it's an unusual and strong mix.), but the taste is just incredible and quite unlike anything else I've ever tasted.
Another great thing about these is their versatility. The chicken pieces can be used in hot dog buns or hoagie rolls like the recipe suggests, but they are also delicious on pasta with simply oil or butter, on salads, on pesto pizzas, or even by themselves.

My dad and I are pretty, well, bad at grilling chicken. But we teamed up with this one for last fourth of July and man - tasty! We were afraid of drying out the chicken so we laid an aluminum foil "tray" on the grill and poured the leftover marinade on them. 
Don't think you can just omit the bread part; I don't know why but it tastes really complete that way. I'd never had spiedies before but I certainly will again!
