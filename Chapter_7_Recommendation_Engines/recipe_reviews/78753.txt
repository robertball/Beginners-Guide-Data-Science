Very tasty! I doubled the marinade and saved half to cook down rather than using
what had been marinading on the pork. I also cut the tenderloin down the middle in a "butterfly" fashion so it could absorb more flavor. All in all a great flavor combo. I served with rice and winter squash. YUM!

Linda W. is a FANTASTIC cook. This is the 2nd of her recipes I've tried & I cannot wait to try her others. The first one I tried was "Rosemary Chicken with Orange-Maple Glaze". Both are outstanding. For this recipe, I used Linda's recipe more as an inspiration for a chicken dish. I used two boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of pork. I DID NOT marinate the chicken. I simply sprinkled each breast with kosher salt, black pepper and Red Robin seasoning (which is basically a season salt). I cooked the breasts about 7 minutes on each side in some olive oil. Meanwhile I doubled the sauce recipe. I used pomegranate juice (the stuff in the curvy small bottle at the grocery). I did not use an actual pomegranate at any point. After I cooked the chicken breasts on each side for 7 minutes, I poured the sauce over the chicken & quickly scraped up the bits of chicken and flavors from the bottom of the pan. I put a lid on the pan and simmered for 15 minutes. Then I removed the chicken to a plate, added a tablespoon of butter to the sauce and about a tablespoon of brown sugar (the pomegranate juice is pretty tart & the honey wasn't enough to overcome it). I simmered the sauce for 1 more minute then spooned it over the chicken breasts, brown rice & peas. This was excellent and a really nice change of pace for chicken. Thanks again Linda for the recipe inspiration. I look forward to trying your other recipes!

I used chicken instead of pork and pan fried it but followed everything else the same. The flavor was amazing. The only thing I would do different next time is to double the sauce to pour over mashed potatoes.

This turned out pretty well, but I think it would have been even better if I had marinated it for the full amount of time (my fault).  Also, it took an extra 10 minutes or so to fully cook on the inside.  The sauce had a really nice sweet/spicy flavor that was a great complement to the pork.

this turned out to be an amazingly elegant birthday dinner for my husband, and it really only took about an hour to prepare (even though it looked as if i had spent hours slaving in the kitchen). i used a pork loin and roasted it whole using a meat thermometer so as not to overcook. i asked the butcher not to remove all of the fat from the roast so as to keep the meat juicy and tender. i scored the fat in a crisscross pattern so it looked beatiful served at the dinner table. i served it with steamed broccoli and grilled red potatoes, halved. i saved some of the pomegranate arils whole for garnish and used some orange slices on the serving platter. Wow! all my guests asked for seconds.  this is a keeper!

I really liked this pork tenderloin.  I did add some rosemary to it because I like it and it goes well with mustard and orange.  The only problem I had was the meat came out of the oven looking a little anemic.  If I choose this marinade again then I'd definitely brown the meat first, or grill it, and then fiish it in the oven.

This is an excellent dish.  I as some reviewers have noted doubled the marinade recipe and made sauce out of the reserved portion.  I made this with pork tenderloin. butterflied boneless/skinless chicken breasts and thighs and it was fantastic.  Served with wild brown rice and garlic roasted asparagus.  Yummmmy

Very tasty! I didn't have pomegranate juice, so I used all orange juice. Instead if sprinkling pomegranate seeds on the pork, I used the seeds in the marinade. I seared the tenderloin on all sides then baked in the oven.

Amazing sauce.  It was both sweet and savory with the pork.  I think the sauce will also be great with chicken.

Lots of flavors!  Hardest part was getting the seeds out of the pomegranate.  If you are pressed for time, just use the bottled juice or buy the pomegranate seeds on their own.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! Even though pomegranates can be a fussy fruit, using the seeds as a garnish is an excellent touch! Definitely worth the work

This is really good.  One tip.  Let the orange and pomegranite juice come to room temp or the honey is just going turn into a lump and not compbine very well with the other ingredients.  You can then put it in the fridge.

Wonderful flavour, but you need to increase the sauce by a factor of 4, by the time you reduce it to half to intensify the flavour you have so little sauce.....and it is a wonderful sauce... to serve with the pork.

It was good, I reduced the sauce to concentrate the  flavors as was recommended.  I used chicken breasts instead of the pork.  Overall it was good, but probably not a keeper for me.

DELICIOUS!  We cooked it on the grill, and it was perfect!  I couldn't find plain pomegranate juice, so I used blueberry pomegranate juice.  Otherwise, I followed it exactly.  This was a great recipe that we will be making again!

I was really looking forward to this meal and was very disapointed.  The only thing I did different was use pomegranate/blueberry juice.  The sauce was not good at all to ANY of my family members so it was almost to dry without a sauce.

YUM! Great recipe- I didn't have time to marinade so did this on the stove top by browning the escalopes in a little oil then adding the marinade to the pan. Will definitely be doing this one again!

Great results! Made a few modifications such as juice on hand (pomegranate/blueberry) and increased the cyanne pepper,no little ones here. Regular mustard and I used a baking bag,no basting! I will marinate for three hours next time to capture more flavor. Thanks!

I thought it was pretty good, the meat was tender but  it needed just a bit more flavor, a bit more salt, a bit more mustard and something else....have not decided what the something else is going to be....

It was delicious.  I accidentally purchased POM with Cherry, but I don't think it made a difference.  Not overly attractive but very tasty!
