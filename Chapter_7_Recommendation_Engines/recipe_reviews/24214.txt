These were not quite what I expected, but definitely tasty.  I made a few revisions: I plumped the raisins in warm water before adding, added chopped pecans, and increased the cinnamon to a teaspoon.  Next time, I'll increase the other spices as well, and try to use more applesauce and less oil.  They are not too sweet, a lot of carrot texture, without a lot of muffin, cakelike texture.  DEFINITELY spray the muffin tin or liners, the muffins tend to stick.

These muffins were great.  I have been looking for a great tasting healthy breakfast muffin for a long time, and now my search is over! I did make a few adjustments - I doubled each spice ingredient (per other reviews) and I doubled the applesouce and halved the veggie oil.  Not too sweet and the longer they sit (so the flavors can meld) the better they get!!  Love this recipe. Thanks Sara.

I made these for the kids at the school that I work at...although the were very hearty and healthy, the kids did not care for them (maybe because they WERE hearty and healthy)...

Oh My Gosh!  These muffins turned out so yummy - I just ate 3 in a row!  I would highly recommend spraying the muffins tins/cups with oil as my muffins got stuck to the paper cups.

I really like these muffins! The only thing I did differently was add a little wheat germ on top of the muffins before they baked...just a little something extra. Very good flavor, very moist. They freeze well too - a plus, since I'm usually the only one to eat muffins in my house. Just take one out of the freezer and defrost in the microwave for a few seconds...presto! Instant breakfast! Thanks for the recipe!

I really like these because you can make them very healthy. I used only 1/4 c. raisins and added extra carrot. I made sure to squeeze the water out of the carrots too.

i found this while searching for something to use up carrots. GREAT RECIPE! the only thing i changed was adding more of the spices, along with cardamom, and i had to make sour milk bc i had no buttermilk. i was brave and tried a double recipe--excellent!!i thought they were very sweet. the mini muffins turned out perfect too.

These muffins are healthier than the ones I usually make, due to the whole wheat flour and honey, however....perhaps equal amounts of whole wheat and regular flour would make them a bit lighter.  A nice muffin overall.

These were ok. They are kinda bland by themselves but we enjoyed them with cream cheese. Probably won't be making them again.

These were really, really bland, even though I doubled the spices per other reviews.  On the positive side, they were wonderfully moist.

I've tried alot of muffin recipes and thought this one to be exceptional.  I think of a muffin as a healthier version of a cupcake.  So, if I want desert, I'll make cupcakes.  This was slightly dense and quite moist.  I subbed  blueberries for the raisins, added 1/2 c nuts, and sprinkled the top with a little carmel sprinkle from pampered chef.  They were over-the-top good.  Kids loved them.  Thanks!

Really not a fan.  First time I've made something with a 4 star rating that turned out to not be so good.  I didn't have whole wheat flour, so I used all white, maybe this was the difference?  But I found them spongy and hard to get cooked all the way through.  They looked nice coming out of the oven (though I don't know where the "dark" is supposed to come from), but as soon as they started cooling they completely shrank.  Kids like them though.

I just made these as a 'Birthday Cake' for my little friend who just turned 1. I did soak the raisins (habit) and used OJ instead of applesauce (didn't have any). For those who aren't accustomed to a high-sugar diet, the raisins and honey make this recipe plenty sweet enough. I sweetened cream-cheese with a tiny bit of honey for icing.

I loved 'em! I made them for my dad for Father's Day and he said they were just like his mom used to make! I also doubled the spices as suggested and they turned out simply fantastic! Maybe a little more raisins next time though. Oh, and I plumped my raisins in warm water before adding them as well and they were plump and remarkably juicy! Yum Yum Yum!

They are weak on flavor, the batter was super stiff and cooked up dense like hockey pucks.  It needs salt, it doesn't taste like carrots

I have been making this recipe every month for 4 years. Tried and true. The only difference I make is double the seasoning of nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves. Personally, 1/4 tsp is not enough. Secondly ALWAYS PLUMP YOUR RAISINS!  There isn't much oil or fat in this, so plump the raisins to add moisture. While you are getting the recipe together, pour boiling water over your raisins just to cover. Once you are ready for them, drain the water and use the raisins. Trust me, the extra water helps keep them from being dry. Also, I have moved three times and each oven I use has required a different baking time for this recipe. Generally they are ready in 16-17 min.
Oh, and I only ever make these as mini muffins. Beware, the recipe will make about 3 dozen.

Great muffins. light, fluffy and moist. I used soured milk because I didn't have buttermilk, and I used 1.5 tbsp unsalted butter because i didn't have any applesauce. I doubled the spice quantities and added cardamom. My yield came to 16 muffins with 187 calories each. Thank you for a great recipe. WIll definitely make this again.

This was a very nice muffin that rose very well. I think these would only be considered "too dense" by those used to eating cake-like muffins. My kids really enjoyed them. I did add a bit more salt, as 1/8 tsp simply isn't enough, and that lack of salt may have contributed to the "bland" flavour other reviewers mention. To make them taste a little closer to carrot cake, you will need to triple (at least) the spices, but for a nice, lightly spiced muffin, doubling the spices is just fine.

I have to say that I wasn't very happy with the way that these turned out. I did increase the spices and added only 1/2 cup of raisins. But, they just weren't muffin like enough for what I was expecting.

My mini-muffins finished in about 9 minutes, and yielded 36 minis.

These need a little something. I doubled the spices per others suggestions, but they're still a little bland. May add mashed bananas instead of the applesauce if I do these again, for added sweetness. 

Also, they were just a little bit rubbery, but pretty sure that's my fault from over stirring.

This recipe has potential and is worth tweaking.

If I could give a 1 1/2 star rating I would.  There is no sweetness at all to these muffins, and they have almost a bitter aftertaste to them.  I'm hoping at least *I* can eat them with a little added icing drizzle or something as I know the rest of the family won't :( So glad I halved the recipe for the first go.  To echo what another reviewer wrote - I don't think I've ever had such bad results from a 4 star recipe before.

Hmm. I modified these & they were not so great. I thought I had wheat flour but didn't so used half regular & half sorghum flour. I then expected a more cake-like muffin & got it. I also used the bagged shredded carrots, about which I was conflicted, and I was right: they needed to be shred finer. Several reviewers stated that they stick to the pan so I used paper muffin cups, and they stuck to those also.  I will not make again.

these were awful, tasteless

I ended up trashing the whole batch!
