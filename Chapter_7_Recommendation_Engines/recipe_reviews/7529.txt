Amazing cake. It did take several hours of work but I did attempt this with a 15 month old toddler at my feet! My husband who loves orange and poppy seed cakes also loved it. Very very tasy and worth the effort. The glaze was thicker than I expected but could've been thinned out with extra boiling water if I'd wanted to. It "glazed" the cake no troubles though.
