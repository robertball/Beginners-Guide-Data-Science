Made this recipe several times. I generally use a baking pan instead of ramekins, and I'll add shrimp or other shellfish to it also. It's always a winner!

I made this for a dinner party of 10 using the prepare ahead suggestions that Amber posted in her review.  Being able to make individual servings made it easy to serve and gave it a classy touch. I did add 1 lb medimum shrimp, grated parmesan and used shallots instead of onion because they have a tamer flavor.  Seasoned the sauce with 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning which does a fantastic job of enhancing the flavors of the seafood.  Most everyone loved it, though it is a bit expensive to make for a very large gathering.

I used this recipe for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. This is definitely not for everday consumption but is great when you need a "fancy" dinner. I did make a lot of extra sauce so it covered the fish in the ramikins and then completely covered them in crab and cheese.  The ramikins are great for a dinner party because each person gets an individual serving, a nice touch.  I made this early in the day then put them in the fridge.  Then before dinner, put on the cheese and browned while everyone had cocktails.  Very little work during the actual party.  A couple people thought the overall taste was a little like lobster.  I am going to try next with monkfish.  Great recipe!

This was indeed, very rich. I cut the recipe in half & cooked it in two large ramekins, figuring since we weren't having an appetizer w/ it that we would want bigger portions. Not so. Smaller portions would have been perfect although next time I do think that I will serve a pureed vegetable soup as a first course. I used tilapia instead of halibut, shallots instead of onions, added a can of tiny shrimp (rinsed & drained) & used a jack/colby blend of cheese. Served it w/ pinot grigio (it's what I used w/ the tilapia too), Lemon Butter Snow Peas & a mixed greens salad w/ Lemon Chiffon Pudding for dessert. Thansk for the recipe Carolyn!

Thought this was a great starting point, I made quite a few changes.  I added bay scallops and tiger shrimp, and garlic.  I also use portabella mushrooms instead of button and I used the whole can of milk with just a tab more flour.  I had to use imitation crab which was just what was available at the time :(  I also subbed grouper instead of halibut.  overall I think it was great, I still feel like the first step is missing something, maybe I will add garlic to wine to give the seafood just a little more flavor.  I will be making this again, thank you for the recipe!

I felt that this recipe was just ok.. My boyfriend and I love cooking together so we thought we'd try this recipe out because we love seafood and the name of the recipe was cute. I think the fish at the bottom could have used a squeeze of lemon and a dash of salt.. It was bland. I wish the sauce was creamier, so that it would seep down through the layers.. It did not. Maybe too much flour? I really wanted to like this more. My boyfriend agreed it was just ok also.

I added 1 clove of garlic w/the veggie mixture & used the whites of 4 green onions, & using the greens when layering. Added the cheese(about 1/2c) right into the sauce & a little Old Bay. Even after that, the sauce did taste like it was missing something. However, once baked w/the fish(used flounder) & crab, it was fantastic! I do think the green onions helped too! Excellent! I do feel that this is more of an accompaniment to main dish, tho. Maybe a small steak? Idk, it just didn't feel like a main dish to me. I served it w/crusty bread, asparagus, & a baked potato. The potato just didn't go.

This was excellent although alot of work.  Only make this when you have the time for many steps.  The fish market did not have halibut so I substituted scrod which was still wonderful.  I also used one baking dish instead of individual dishes.  The whole meal was delicious but very rich.  I may use half the sauce next time to make a thinner layer over the fish to cut down on the richness of it.  All in all a flavorful pleaser!

I added small salad shrimp on top of the crabmeat.  My husband was totally impressed.  He said it was better than restaurant quality!

I took a chance and tried this out on a couple for dinner one night who happen to be fabulous cooks themselves, so I really wanted to impress.  And impressed they were!  Not only was this simple to make, it tasted like restaurant-quality. I'll make this again and again.

This recipe is awesome.  I've made it a number of times.  Always a hit. I suggest using a wine that you enjoy drinking. I can't ever find fresh halibut so I've always used talipia.  I do use more crabmeat and more cheese as someone else suggested.  The sauce is rich, but it's worth the work.  Thanks, Carolyn, for a delicious dish.

*FABULOUS* Recipe!  I only added 1/2 tsp Old Bay Seasoning and used tilapia filets. I also used canned LUMP crab meat as the fresh crab was too expensive. (Be sure to rinse well with water first if you use the canned variety.) I think you could use just about any seafood combo and this would be delicious!

This was VERY rich.  We liked it, but I will probably make it with regular milk instead of evaporated milk next time.

I'll give this five stars because I can see that it would be excellent, however mine was not.  The sauce is Awesome!  I loved it.  But where I live I am unable to get real crab meat or fresh halibut.  The frozen halibut was terrible so I tried again with tilapia, failed again.  Plus the imitation crab meat just doesn't cut it.  It's worth another attempt though because I really like the flavor of the sauce and I can see how good this recipe would be with the right sea food.

Excellent Valentine's Day dish that my husband and I loved. The flavor was not what I was expecting, but it was good. Very rich so a little went a long way, but a great dish overall. I made it in a 9x13 pan which worked fine, but wasn't as presentable as ramekins would have been.

Awesome!! My family (and guests) unanimously voted this on the "keeper" list-which doesn't happen very often! I substituted shallots for onions, and added some large chopped shrimp.  I made in advance and then heated for maybe 20 mins covered in the oven, then uncovered for the last 5 mins.  It was very rich, even with low fat milk.  Served with just a green salad and hot sourdough bread-really nice Sunday evening meal on a cold night. :-)

Very tasty, but far too rich for our taste.  Was a lot of work.  Restaurant quality dish.  I'm sure it would be a hit at a dinner party.

Very tasty! I made this for Valentines day and it was a great success.  My hubby doesn't like halibut, so I used salmon instead.  Make sure to serve immediately.  I will be making this one again!

Very good!!  I ended up having to make with shrimp and crab because the fish I bought ended up spoiled so I had to thaw some raw shrimp and use that instead.  It still was very good.  My hubby and 7 year old son really loved this.  I will for sure make this again!

I substituted the wine and used chicken broth (I only had red wine) and the fish turned out fine.  Overall this takes a bit of time to make but the results are well worth it.  I used a 9 x 13 dish instead of individual ramekins.  The sauce is very creamy and mushroomy tasting.  I'm not sure it really needs the cheese on top...but I did add it.  Next time I might omit it.  This is very nice dish to prepare for company.  This recipe also uses very expensive ingredients!  Halibut isn't cheap and either is crabmeat.  It cost me approx. $40 to make...not including the cost of sides and wine to drink!  I also would recommend a new name for the recipe - this one annoys me!  Haha!

Wonderful dish!  I made this for my husband's birthday and he loved it!  I made it in a 9 x 13 pan, since I didn't have enough ramekins.  I made everything the afternoon of and just popped it all in the oven at dinner time--it turned out great.  I used shrimp (since that's what I had), but I will make this again and use crab.  A hint of Old Bay seasoning in the sauce was perfect for our tastes.  Delicious!  I will make this again.

This recipe is quite delicious, but the only problem was that it costs a bit too much to make unless you serve to someone who is a seafood LOVER. 
My husband enjoyed it, but he enjoys meatloaf too - it was just another dinner to him.

Elegant to say the least. Altho I loved the idea of the individual ramekins, I didn't have enough on hand so I had to place all of the fish into one casserole dish. Not as pretty, but absolutely delicious! This gives me a great excuse to go out and buy some. Thank you so much Carolyn!

Changed it a bit, added garlic to the onions etc and used 3/4 c of cheese.  How yummy!  Wonderful!

I was not thrilled with this though I did not have any crab on hand which could have made the difference.  My halibut seemed over done and dry and I didn't think the sauce was specacular.  Not sure if I will try it with the crab or not.  It was edible but not wonderful.

I hate seafood, but this was great. I'd bought 8-oz. ramekins for this; but you don't need them. My guests liked this, too. The worst part was chopping the mushroom, onion, and red pepper; but it was worth it. Mmmm.

I'm sorry, this was very disappointing for us. I made it for a special occasion and spent a lot of time and money to get the best quality seafood available, but neither of us wanted to finish our portions. I won't be trying it again, I'm afraid.

Tasted sauce before pouring over fish and it was too bland for my taste. This is a wonderful base recipe but needed some seasoning adjustments so I am giving 4 stars. With the changes I made it turned out heavenly! Crab can be costly, so I used a can of fancy white crab drained. I also chopped 1/2 lb cooked jumbo shrimp and put them on top of the cooked fish along with the crab. I added 2 cloves minced garlic & used bulbs of green onions in place of yellow onions, sauteing them with the sweet red bell pepper. I added 1 tsp Old Bay seasoning to sauce, along with 1/4 cup grated Parm. I baked in glass 7x11 baking dish. The sauce seemed very thick and when I tried to spoon over the dish it was not covering the fish very well. I added the rest of the can of evaporated milk to the sauce which made it perfect consistency for spooning and covering fish. However, after baking the sauce had thinned out more and it was wonderful to use hot french bread to sop up the extra sauce on our plates. I did slice the green onion tops and sprinkled them over the sauce before baking it. This would be good served over a hot bed of rice, too! It is rich, but not too rich in my opinion. Hubby was not crazy about it like I was, but he is not fond of cream base sauces.

I made this yesterday and I am not sure if I did something wrong, I found it pretty bland, even with adding garlic to the vegetables while they were being sauteed. This recipe does have potential though, maybe with some tweaking I can bring up the flavour...I will try replacing the flour, butter and milk mixture with a combination of cream of celery soup and 1/4 cup of wine...I may even heat that up and melt the cheese in that first before adding the sauteed vegetables and spreading over the crab and fish. I will try it again and rerate.

Yum!  The only thing I'd do a little differently next time is to make sure the white sauce didn't get too thick.  I think the dish would have been better if it were creamier.  The leftovers even tasted great the next day.

My husband made this for me for VAlentine's  Day in 2001.  We've made it many times since.  Great for people who think they don't like fish!  Love making it for company.  Rich and delicious!

I enjoyed this dish quite a bit, but the rest of my family could take it or leave it. I added a little "Old Bay with Garlic and Herb" seasoning to the sauce (and was glad I did, as it would have been a little bland without it), but the flavour of the red pepper was wonderful! I didn't have the full amount of crab, so I added some small cooked shrimp with it. I only used 1/4 cup white wine, and it was more than enough to cover the fish. I thought it was an elegant and delicious dish, and would proudly make it again!

I made this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day this past weekend.  He loved it, and ate the leftovers Sunday also!  Some changes though:  I did use Salmon instead of halibut, very good!  I would use more crabmeat and more cheese next time.  Also, I would make more of the sauce that goes over the crab and fish.  It was good, but there wasn't enough of it!

Before making this dish, I read the reviews and many of them mentioned that the dish is bland.  I would agree if I made it the original way.  White pepper alone won't season the dish properly.  I'm lucky enough to live on the West Coast of Canada where we have a great supply of fish and crab and since I went fishing last weekend, I had a fresh supply of halibut and crab.  First off, I seasoned the fish with a planking spice that I make all the time and then poured the white wine over it.  The biggest glaring thing I saw in the recipe was to bake the fish for 20 minutes.  That is too long as it will make the fish rubbery and will ruin the entire dish.  I baked mine for 11 minutes, turned out perfectly.  For the sauce, I added 3/4 tbsp of Old Bay Seasoning and a teaspoon of minced garlic.  Like another user, I increased the flour and used an entire can of evaporated milk.  Instead of using little ramekins, I used my Le Creuset Soup Bowls (4 of them).  When I placed the halibut in the bowl, I flaked it as opposed to leaving it whole.  I think that made a big difference.  I added a big handful of crab on top, followed by two big heaping spoons of sauce making sure the halibut and crab were covered.  I then added a big handful of shredded Monterey Jack Cheese on top.  I baked it for 10 minutes to heat through and then broiled it at 400 f for 2 minutes to brown.  It turned out fantastic.  I think the changes I made, made all the difference.

This was amazing! I made it for my husband for Valentine's Day and oh my so good! It does have a few steps, so you have to plan accordingly, but is is well worth it.  I had to substitute some ingredients, because I didn't want to go to the store, so I used salmon, and had no wine,so I used apple juice diluted with water, and added a few tablespoons of white vinegar to cook the fish.  I can't wait to try it with wine next time.  When I make this again, I will make and assemble the day before, so it's easy to pop into the oven before dinner.  Also, I hate the name, and refuse to serve something to my in-laws named the way to a man's heart...so my suggestion is "Carolyn's Seafood Spectacular"...thanks Carolyn for creating and then sharing this one!

Yum!! I used talapia and shrimp instead of crab as well.  I would make this with shrimp and chicken really anything because the flavor was really good.  I probably used more cheese than it called for because I was eyeing it :) Thanks for another creative fish dish

I made this for my boyfriend and he was very impressed!  He couldn't stop talking about it.  I used flounder instead of Halibut and heavy whipping cream instead of evaporated milk.  It wasn't as rich as some reviewers said...maybe because of the cream.

Delicious! I used immitation crab meat which was a HUGE mistake. It overpowered the halibut. Next time I'll spring for the good stuff! I also added about a tsp of minced garlic to the sauce, as well as about 1/3 C white wine. Very tasty. Shrimp is a wonderful addition too. I'll definately make this again.

This was very good.  Used Alaskan Halibut, topped with med. sized shrimp and extra cheese on top.  Made in larger dishes and this recipe worked great for 4. I added a little cajun seasoning to the sauce.  Will make again!  Thank you.

This was tasty, I added 3/4 of the cheese plus 1/4 tsp cayenne and a bit more salt to the sauce, and then scattered the other 1/4 cheese on the top, also made as one larger casserole instead of individual ramkins.  Good recipe for people who don't like their seafood to taste too "fishy".

I followed the recipe exactly (unusual for me!) and thought this recipe was just ok.  I usually love cooking with wine, but thought in this case, the fish ended up with too strong a wine flavor.  Also, the red pepper in the sauce kind of overpowered any other flavor.  I might try this recipe again, making a few adjustments - might cook fish in a garlic/olive oil mix, and reduce or eliminate the red pepper

Eh...I wasn't that impressed with this recipe.  I felt like I wasted good fish.  I think it would be MUCH better w/chicken!  I used salmon instead of halibut.  I thought it was fairly bland.  It looks fancy, but the cream sauce completely masks the flavor of the fish and the wine.  Good recipe for people who want to eat fish, but don't like fish.

I cooked this tonight.  Local store didn't have halibut, so I used catfish instead.  Sauce was excellent, and so was the crabmeat.  I felt it would be even better over baked chicken.  Needs garlic.  Made Cajun Crab Soup, also from allrecipes, to go along with the meal.

This takes a lot of work.  We used salmon and imitation crab but it still turned out good.  Will try halibut next time.

I gave this 5 stars but agree with others that it needs more flavor.  Add garlic and Old Bay to pick it up a notch.  Would also be good with some red pepper flakes.  I added shrimp and some green onions to the seafood combo.  Was the perfect surf to our surf and turf meal.

Incredibly rich but very tasty.   I added extra salt and pepper and garlic.

I will make this again, with modifications. I think adding garlic to the mushroom/red bell pepper mixture will add a little extra flavor. 
I had to substitute tilapia for halibut , which worked but I think I would have enjoyed this with a "meatier" fish like salmon or tuna.
I would have preferred cheddar cheese as well. I don't think the ramekins are 100% necessary for the recipe. Next time I will cook it in ceramic cookware.

Made this recipe for the first time. I used cod due to no halibut at store.  Added minced garlic and shrimp.  He went back for seconds!!

This recipe did not turn out for us at all.  The sauce was bland and tasteless.  It may have been the fish - we used filet of sole and it completely fell apart in the wine.  Couldn't find fresh crab, so I used frozen.  Overall bland and too heavy...no flavor.  If I had managed to get fresh crab, it would've been ruined by this recipe - better to just eat the crab by itself.

I made this for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day.  We both were immediately in love with this recipe!  It was so delicious, with so many varied flavors.  We both considered it restaurant quality.  The only changes I made to the recipe were baking it in a 9 x 8 pan, and adding shrimp and scallops.  Again, it was over the top delicious!

This was good. It was pretty easy to make and had good flavor. It was too rich for me, but my husband loved it. Guess that is how it got it's name... Nice for a special dinner but won't make my "regulars" list.
PS- I used flounder as the fish and fat free evap. milk (but it was still really rich).

This was really good!  Like some other reviewers suggested, I skipped the ramekins and just baked everything in a dish, and used more cheese.

Absolutly delicious! Next time I will avoid the ramakins, and make larger preportions on the serving plate. (This seemed like an unneccesary step!)I will probably also add a few cloves of garlic just to put a little extra something into the sauce!

This was good, but I can't help but think it was missing some thing.  Perhaps, garlic.
