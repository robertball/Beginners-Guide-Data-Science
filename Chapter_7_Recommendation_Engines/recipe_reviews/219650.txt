Awesome recipe!  I always want to make Scalloped Potatoes but I am always in a hurry.  This recipe tastes just like the baked kind.  The only thing I did changed was that I diced the potatoes instead of slicing.  It made sense to me because you are stirring them throughout the cooking process.  I didn't want to end up with mashed potatoes.

These were great after I mixed in pepper and a can of cream of mushroom....I did add more potatoes and upped the recipe to 8 servings so it wasn't runny because of the added soup. Mix in some shredded cheese at the end and they're even better! Super fast...I have a feeling this will be a go to recipe at the camper this fall!!!

Awesome, quick and easy! Added cheese per suggestions. Allrecipes needs to quit with the footnote tips about aluminum foil when it comes to microwave recipes.. You never know, somone's going to be dumb enough to do it.

A good way to get dinner on the table, especially in summer, when time is short. Thanks for the idea.

This was fabulous!  I  can't believe that I didn't have any fresh onion, so I substituted 1 tbsp of onion powder and added a huge scoop of fresh minced garlic.  I also used seasoned salt instead of regular salt.  I had three huge baking potatoes instead of four smaller potatoes, but it didn't make any difference once they were sliced up.  My potatoes were done in exactly 15 minutes.  Recieved 8 thumbs up...10 thumbs up once I sprinkled a bit of cheese over my 7 year olds plate.  This is definitely a keeper!!!!

I was looking for a scallop potato recipe to cook in my microwave as I didn't want to heat up the house with the oven.  It was 97 degrees AND humid today!  This fit the bill; it was delicious and cut the cooking time drastically.  Just one note though, if you're watching your salt cut in half or even more.  I used 1 t. salt and it was still plenty salty.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I have made similar recipes before.  I thought it was very good, a bit bland, but it's supposed to be.  I used dried parsley on top, and a bit of paprika.  They added color and flavor.  Microwave ovens can vary a lot in their wattage, and therefore it impacts the
cooking times.  ALSO very important --- don't make the potato slices too thick!  It makes them take too long to cook.  Keep them a uniform thickness, it helps.  And stir every 5 minutes, as the recipe states.  I used only about half of the salt, as I don't like it.  Hubby loved it, too. Yummy!  : )  post by Fun2cook

I thought these were pretty good. However note: I had 4 baked potatoes leftover (so mine were already cooked). I just peeled and sliced them. Since the potatoes were already cooked I decided to saute the onion in the butter until softened and I added the salt to that. I cut the amount of salt in half, as I tend to do for most recipes. It was plenty. I added some paprika straight to the flour. I mixed it all together and poured the milk over as directed. I covered it with plastic wrap and microwaved it for 6 minutes. After 3 minutes it was still a little liquidy, so I stirred in another spoonful of flour and put it back in the microwave to finish cooking. It thickened up and was creamy. To add a little more flavor I stirred in about 1/2 cup fine shredded cheddar mixed with jalepeno pepper cheese. Although, it was not needed. Thanks, for a quick and easy side tonight with what I had in the house.

Excellent.  Used slicing blade on food processor to make slicing potatoes a breeze.  Ended up with uniform slices.  Used 2 t salt as written.  Tossed with 2 T flour.  Melted 4 T butter and mixed it in (we like butter!)  Used heavy cream instead of milk.  Easy and so much faster than oven method.  This one is a keeper.

Love this...(Finally figured out to avoid boil over)...I do not use optional items, but add cubed ham for additional flavor.  I microwave UNCOVERED  for about 5 mins. on high power (1000 watt oven), stir, then micro 5 mins. more at 70% power; stir again and micro 5 mins. +/-longer at 60% power.  This way, there is no splatter or boil over for me.

I only added one teaspoon plus a bit more of salt. It took 25 minutes in the microwave, browned it in the toaster oven on convection for about five minutes. Added a sprinkle of smoked paprika and parsley to the sauce, then more smoked paprika, shredded cheese and panko crumbs to the top, after taking out of microwave. It was delicious.

No changes made!! Delicious as it is written.  I was soooo happy when I came across this recipe. I was skeptical, but glad I made them anyway.  Great for the working woman, and the retired woman who doesn't want to mess with the oven!!!!!

I just made this tonight, and it came out GREAT!  I used six potatoes instead of four (there were six of us eating), and I should have left it in the microwave a few more minutes (probably 20) - of course, my microwave isn't the world's greatest either....  As the oven was already on (baked ribs) I threw some cheese over it at the end and browned it up.  But this is the EASIEST as well as one of the TASTIEST scalloped potato recipes I have tried, and it is way easier than trying to make them in the oven (which can take a LONG time....).  Thanks for the great recipe!

This came out great and so easy.  I used onion powder instead of fresh onion and baked in the oven for 15 minutes after microwaving just to brown a bit and crisp the top but, I'm sure it would have been just as good as written.

These turned out great!  Didn't have enough room in the oven so I found this recipe as my Plan B.  I used half milk and half cream and added a good sprinkle of garlic powder.  Will definitely make these again!

The writer must have a microwave with the wattage of the sun. Took my microwave 45 minutes to cook 4 sliced potatoes in the slew of milk as written. The sauce was bland and common. I'm amazed the cook felt the need to share. Won't make again.

Way too much salt. I will make again because it really is simple to make. If you're going to make this, don't use 2 teaspoons of salt though way too much

The recipe is nice, but took much longer.  Per other suggestions, I added 2 T more butter, 1/4 tsp garlic salt, 1 c chopped  ham and  1 cup  grated cheddar.    I sliced just two large potatoes very thin, and the potatoes still weren't done after 25 minutes.  I added 2 more T. of flour because the milk still seemed soupy.  Finally, I put the potaotes in the oven for 15 minutes more and they were  done.  Maybe it's because I didn't cover the potatoes in the micro.  I don't have a glass lid, and don't cover anything with plastic.  Oh, well, it turned out really good, thank you for the recipe.

Delicious! I needed a quick dinner the first time I made this and loved it. Because I'm used to making it in the oven and the potatoes being almost covered in milk I added more milk and ended up having to add more flour partway through.
Made it again tonight, comparing it with my oven recipe. That one calls for 3t flour and 4T butter for 1-1/2 cups milk with 4 potatoes. We used fingerling potatoes (not sure on the amount), layered potatoes, dots of butter, shakes of flour, salt, and garlic powder, then added spiral ham chunks, a handful of shredded cheddar, and a handful of shredded mozzarella to the layer. I ended up needing an extra tablespoon of flour, so I increased the milk by 1/2 cup. Cooking time was a bit more due to the quantity. I think it took about 30-40 minutes,  stirring every 5 minutes.
Everyone loved it, most notably my sister who a) does not like skins on potatoes, and b) does not like scalloped potatoes. We're definitely making this again!

I chopped the potatoes, then microwaved for about 18 minuites, stirring throughout. I then added shredded cheese, and mixed.

Was doubtful but needed to use the microwave as my oven was in use.  I was concerned it would turn to mush turning so frequently but was pleased they didn’t.  The only change was gluten free flour and I added cheese at the end.  Everyone loved them.

They were not as creamy as the ones I make with a white sauce in the oven... also didn't get that nice golden brown topping, i had to pUT them in the ovenue on broulette for about 10 minutes...  taste was good, but took longer to cook than recipe..  maybe because I had a bit too much potatoe and didn't adust the milk enough...  but I would make them again.

This was great.  In the future I would cut back salt more, I used 1 tsp, but think it would be fine with less.  Followed recipe  using 8 small red potatoes, microwaved for 15 mins total then put in 350 oven while grilling pork chops.  Hubby loved them.  Note the milk used was actually Almond.  Will make again, also I have a heavy hand with pepper.  Loved it.

GREAT way to make potatoes in little time.  I'd cook just a bit longer, but tried another reviewers method to minimize boil over by varying power/time. Will reduce salt next time (and I LOVE salt) and I added cheddar, but salt overpowered the dish.

I added butter and heavy cream at the end. I must have used large potatoes and needed more sauce. The texture and flavors were on point! Definitely added to my weekly menus.

I made this with 1 giant bakers potato and it easily made three servings in 10 minutes. It was a life saver. I always forget scalloped potatoes take so long the traditional way, but now i was able to cook them while the chicken finished. The fam loved it. I will be using this again.

Excellent easy recipe, that turned out very creamy. Use this as a base to add whatever additions you enjoy (but it is good, just as it is). I added garlic powder and smoked paprika. Then, once cooked, topped with fresh grated parmesan and ran it under the broiler until cheese was melted and slightly browned. I liked  this recipe BETTER than oven versions! Seems like the potatoes were creamier and more moist than oven versions.

Very good.  Tastes just like the oven-baked potatoes, only easier and faster!   These will be on my menu more often.

Yes - my only changes were to make it gluten free.  Used a mix of quinoa flour and brown rice flour.   Also added a pinch of black pepper.  Family loved it!

I wanted to make  scalloped potatoes when company dropped by unexpectedly for dinner, but needed it done quicker than the traditional baked version, so I tried this. It was very similar to a recipe my grandmother used years ago (before microwaves, so it was baked). I have to admit, I just followed the method and didn't measure anything, and added garlic powder and smoked bacon sea salt. Yum! Everyone loved it. I'll make it again, and may vary it by adding cheese or herbs the final minute of cooking.  Great shortcut recipe and it only used the one Pyrex bowl it cooked in.

These were pretty good. I followed the recipe as written, including the optional parsley and paprika. They were too salty for my taste and could have benefited from more onion . I'll reduce the salt and up the onion next time. They were actually better the next day as leftovers.

This was a decent recipe. I asked my hubby to find a microwave scalloped potatoes recipe since we were short on time. I let him go and this is what he found. Several things we did differently: 1. He forgot to add the butter but it didn't matter in the end and you don't miss it. 2. It took a lot longer to cook in the microwave...and ours is brand new. I probably microwaved it a good 20 minutes more. 3. I added shredded cheese and panko crumbs to the top and broiled it a few minutes until golden brown. 4. We added sliced onions rather than chopped (though I see now it included chopped onions). Delicious. I'd make it again but it's not a quick dish.

Recipe was okay tasting. Don't forget to add the salt, I did to reduce sodium and the potatoes were bland. I added cheese to increase flavor. The dish made a mess in my microwave also. Started spilling out of the bowel. Was okay tasting and left a mess.
