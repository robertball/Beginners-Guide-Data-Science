I just made this pie today and it was absolutely fabulous. To be honest, I was going to add it to all the recipes on this website, but I decided to search for it first. If you like pumpkin pie and cool whip, you will love this recipe. IT tastes just like regular pumpkin pie covered in whipped cream. Delicious!!!

My family has been making this exact recipe for years on thanksgiving and it always is a big hit.  I have never had one person taste it that didnt want a second piece!! I actually prefer this over regular pumpkin pie. If you are looking for a special dessert this thanksgiving, you definitely have to try this recipe!

This was a wonderful recipe. And so easy!! I made it first and simply put it into the fridge until it was time for dessert.  It doesn't get simpler than that!  Thanks a lot!!

This pie was just "OK" in my opinion. I made one for a potluck at work and one for Thanksgiving at my grandma's. I didn't think the pie set very well...it was kind of messy, and I did everything exactly according to instruction. I also thought it could use a little more pumpkin flavoring. I thought it was good, but I probably will not make it again.
