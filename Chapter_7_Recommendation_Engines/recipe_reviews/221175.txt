Really enjoyed this recipe.  As my husband said, it is a crunchy potato salad without the potatoes.  
I used raw cauliflower rather than cooking it.

I really enjoyed this.  It tastes just like egg salad but but the nutritional benefits of cauliflower.  I make exactly as written and served with whole wheat pitas.

This salad is a nice change for something different.  We didn't love the taste of the pickle relish in this dish.  If you like it in potato and macaroni salad then you will like it in here.  I should have followed my instincts and left it out.  This does keep very well in the fridge for a couple of days.  It is a nice salad to pack in lunches.  Thanks Rosalie for sharing.

I am completely won over with this recipe!  It is so easy, and scrumptious.  I will never have to worry about what to do with extra cauliflower again.

This is a really nice change of pace.  I steamed my head of cauliflower to ensure that it wouldn't get too soft.  I used 4 eggs, and chopped bread and butter pickles in place of the relish.  I also used half of a large carrot and an extra green onion.  I know that straight mayo would not do it for us so I have a standard 'dressing' for salads like this - mixing mayo, sour cream and honey mustard significantly thinned with milk and some pickle juice then seasoned to taste.  The crunch of the cauliflower and the pickle is what makes the salad for me - none of that mealy potato texture.  Plus - at less than half the calories of potato salad you just can't go wrong.  Thanks for sharing, Rosalie!  This is going to be a new standard.

I just finished making this and I am very pleased! I only added one green onion, as I'm not a huge fan, but it gives the salad a delicate flavor I am quite enjoying (:

Very good!  served with fish sticks and no need for tartar sauce.  I also did not cook the cauliflower and enjoyed the crunch.

This was a great base recipe for me.  I took several other comments here and applied them and added some of my own.  I had fresh green beans, broccoli and cauliflower, so i threw them all in the pot and boiled for 10 minutes.  I was hoping that the boiling wouldn't make things too wimpy and it did not.  Because I had about three times the cups of veggies called for, i made the dressing out of about 1/2 cup of relish, 1/2 cup of some German mustard, and 1/2 cup of Mayo.  threw in the eggs and the peeled carrots, and this is awesome!  Thanks so much for getting me started!!

A good substitute for potato salad.   Used Sandwich Spread and may.   Didn't add extra pickle relish.   Love the crunch!

Who's recipe is quick and easy to make.  Taste very similar to potato salad.  I added chopped red onions instead of green onions.  It is delicious.  I added it to my favorite recipes.

Yum! Made as directed but added dill and celery seed. I think next time I make this I will be cooking the cauliflower less. other than that, delicious!

I kept the cauliflower raw and crunchy.  Family liked it and my son said it reminded him of coleslaw.

Yum, such a great alternative to potato salad. I would skip the carrots next time and I added a little celery seed.

We enjoyed this recipe. I added extra mustard and vinegar. Without, it tasted somewhat bland but I like food to be flavorful. I'll experiment with different mustards next time such as Dijon.

I used a bit of grated onion as I didn't have green onions and grated some cornichon in it as I don't like pickle relish.  I also forgot the mustard!  It was still really really good and I'll add this to my favorite easy salad list.

I enjoyed the taste of this; however the texture was a little off putting. I think this is a great idea and a good recipe - the flavor is excellent! It is just not for me. I omitted the mayo as I cannot stand it, and used Greek yogurt instead. (I added a tad more mustard to make up for the tartness of the yogurt.)
Thank you for sharing your recipe!
