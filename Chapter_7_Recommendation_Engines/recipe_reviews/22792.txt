this recipe produced two fine loaves of very flavorful bread  Prep couldn't have been easier...a good project for kids. It had the "bite" from the soda and the buttermilk that makes the bread so wonderful.  I shipped it to two friends and it arrived in perfect condition and was enjoyed by all!

this had really good flavor, except, being the ignorant 15 year old cook that I am, I wasn't expecting it to be like a flat bread. I had wanted to make a loaf og bread but thats ok it still came out good! and hey, you learn something new every day!

Five stars for simplicity.  I used all-purpose white and special-for-bread whole wheat flour and this turned out great.  Used fake buttermilk - 1 tbsp vinegar for each cup milk and let sit 10 minutes on counter.  Stirred about 1 cup of raisins into the flour mix before the milk to make raisin bread.  Tasty and chewy, great warm with jam and honey.

Excellent!  This bread tastes exactly as I remember it in Ireland; great warm with butter and jam.  Easy to make.  Thanks for sharing it.

Pretty good, but I was hoping for something that rivaled the "Katie O'Reilly" brand that is sold in stores around St. Patrick's day and has very similar ingredients. I added an egg to help hold the loaf together, and changed some of the whole wheat flour to oat flour, which unfortunately, made it more crumbly.

If you don't have buttermilk (which can be difficult to find in stores), you can go a couple of different directions. You can follow the advice of  one of the other reviewers and use vinegar milk. (Not the tastiest option.) You can buy powdered buttermilk in bulk food stores, which is what I used, and is also not terribly tasty. Yogurt mixed with a bit of milk to loosen it up is a good option, although lowfat yogurt can also be a bit bland. The tastiest substitute is probably sour cream, but also the fattiest.

I added 2 cups of currents, which gave it a nice sweet flavor.

I think next time I'll add more oil or butter to give the loaf more flavor.

Holy YUM!! This bread is so incredibly delicious - I've been thinking about it all day! I've neither had nor made this before, but it's my mum's favourite so I whipped it up last night. So easy and so GOOD! I didn't have buttermilk so I made some using milk and vinegar (1 tbsp/cup milk - let sit 10 min.) and it's still getting rave reviews. I got 2 round loaves, and the shapes came out a little different because I scored the top of one with an X and left the other one alone. The X loaf came out rounder while the untouched loaf rose upwards a little more. It kind of looks like a muffin. Aesthetically, I liked the X loaf better, but they taste equaly great. Thanks for the recipe!!

My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this, it goes great with any kind of thick soup or stew! The bread didn't seem to rise enough, although maybe that was just me..it's good though!

Because the recipe allows for some variation, I used some coconut milk that I had sitting around. I also added cinnamon and 1/4 t extra baking soda. The bread turned out great.

Looks like a brick when it's taken out of the oven, but the bread has a great mild flavor that goes well with many hearty stews, or can be slathered with honey butter as a snack with a cup of tea.  It's a very simple recipe. I like it and will be making again.

It tastes good, but I like another soda bread recipe better.  I don't know if I did something wrong, or if the dough was supposed to be so sticky. Might want to add a little extra flour.

I've tested other soda bread recipes on AllRecipes, but I keep coming back to this one -- simple and perfect. It's a nice base for experimentation, too; I've tried it with currants and with rosemary, and it never fails to please. I do suggest, though, that you seek out *real* buttermilk (not that low-fat nonsense) if it's available in your area. You'll taste the difference, if you can keep your guests from scarfing the loaves up before you get a decent bite!

I've never had real Irish soda bread, but I made this exactly according to the recipe and it was not so good. It was very heavy, and because of the the grainy, heavy texture it didn't taste too great either. And, it looks nothing like the picture shown- when you use whole wheat flour, the bread is brown....

Wow this is GREAT!! I cut the recipe in half and I didn't have buttermilk so I used coconut milk kefir instead which I figured would work because it has the same kind of tang to it. I shaped the dough into a round loaf and sprinkled it with oats before I baked it and it came out gorgeous! A great thing to make when you have no eggs and not a lot of sugar on hand. This is a keeper!!

Made this on Easter Sunday.  Took one warm loaf to brunch and kept the other for myself.  Only changes in recipe was to use half and half instead of milk and canola oil instead of vegetable.  This bread is fantastic and will become a staple.  A couple of days after baking this bread, cut off some slices, buttered both sides and pan fried them.  Tossed on a plate and poured on some maple syrup.  Made an outstanding breakfast as it went perfect with some good dark roast coffee.

This was just so-so.  We did eat it with butter on it.  I think next time, I will try this or a different one with a little less whole wheat flour in it.  My kids did not like this at all and that is unusual.  They usually like most types of bread.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but I did exactly what the recipe said and the bread is dry.  Maybe it will be better tomorrow after it rest for awhile. Never make this again.

Wholesome, non-sweet whole wheat soda bread.  Would get 5 stars if the photo was not so misleading: 1. Photo shows a white loaf, while whole wheat flour results in a darker denser loaf -  not a problem but show it like it is!! 2. Photo shows a loaf obviously baked in a loaf pan, while the recipe calls for shaping the dough into round loaves, and baking on a baking sheet. Other than that, it is a good recipe. Thank you.

I have several recipes for soda bread. This one is a little drier than the one I was usually make. I added raisins for a little texture and caraway seed because I like the flavor. All in all a good bread. Co-workers and my Irish-Italien husband liked it. When it's a day old try topping it with the cinnimon honey butter that's also on this site.

I am new to making breads and had my doubts about this as I was preparing.  I actually turned out really good.  It was quick and easy to make.  We enjoyed it with butter and honey.  I used 1 tbsp of vinegar to 1 cup on milk for the buttermilk and did not change anything else.  I am going to make this with beer cheese soup for our St. Patty's day party.  Thanks!

Made this to go along with our St. Patrick's Day meal of Beef and Irish Stout Stew and Irish Champ (both excellent recipes from this site).  This was my first time making Irish Soda Bread, so I felt like perhaps I didn't do it quite the justice it deserved.  I did half the recipe.  The dough was drier than perhaps it should've been, but I knew from experience making scones that I didn't want to over knead the dough, so I made the loaf the best I could and baked it.  I think it was good, but maybe could be better with a bit more practice on my part.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe. I followed the recipe as written with the following changes: used powdered buttermilk as I had it in the pantry, added about 1 1/2 cups of raisins, and I liberally sprinkled the tops of each loaf with granulated sugar before baking. This made two loaves which quickly disappeared at work with rave reviews and requests for the recipe.

Took to a St. Patty's day party. Made one with raisins and fennel and one without. Both were good but the raisin/fennel went the fastest.

SORRY, IT WAS TERRIBLE!  TWO BIG BRICKS! AND THE PICTURE LOOKED NOTHING LIKE WHAT I MADE!   I REALLY THINK THE WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR WAS WHAT MADE IT A FLOP.

Mine came out awful!  I think it must have been that my WW flour was too old or something.  Even the dough didn't act right!  I'll try again sometime with fresh whole wheat flour.  MIne came out like big flour bricks!  Probably my fault though, so I'll leave the rating at 4 stars and just warn folks to use fresh ingredients!  (I actually WAS trying to use up that old flour!  Oh well!)

This is a delicious bread, quick and easy to make.  I followed the recipe as listed and the bread turned out a lot lighter than other Irish Soda Bread recipes I have tried.  This was a pleasant surprise since, given the quantity of whole wheat flour in the recipe, I had expected it to be more dense.  If you are looking for the sweet style of Irish Soda Bread, look elsewhere.  But if you are looking for a tasty simple loaf give this a try.  By the way, I don't know what the picture that accompanies this recipe is of, but I doubt it is of this predominantly whole-grain bread.

A great bread that's nigh impossible to screw up. I replaced the single cup of regular milk with the rest of the buttermilk I'd bought (since I don't use milk aside from for cooking) with no problems.

This was my first try at soda bread. I found my dough was way too sticky to form nice round cakes. I am not sure what I did wrong. I will try again, but maybe follow a different recipe to see if there is a difference in texture.

Sooooo yummy! Moist and buttery, I have found my favorite Irish soda bread recipe! I out in more all purpose flour instead of wheat.
