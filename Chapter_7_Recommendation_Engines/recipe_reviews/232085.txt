Just made this recipe, actually made a variation. I only used 1 cup of oats,(I cut it down because I didn't want to waste the oats if I screwed it up!) I added steal cut oats, Chai seed and Hemp seed as well as the wheat germ. I didn't have coconut, but substituted the oil for coconut oil. I didn't use brown sugar, I used maybe a 1/3 cup (all that I had) of coconut sugar and about a 1/4 cup or so of organic maple syrup and some stevia. Also cut down the spices. I added dried cranberries, pumpkin seeds,and almonds.  It came out great.  I've never made granola before and used this as a guide. I'm surprised more people don't make their own, so easy and good. You can see I changed a lot from a very good recipe and worked with what I had.

I changed it around a little, but loved the recipe!!  I used 1/2 brown sugar-1/2 pure maple syrup (cooked covered in the microwave for 3 mins., prior to adding to the oat mixture).  I added 1/2 teaspoon of maple flavoring to the 1/2 cup of water.  I used whole pecans, hazelnuts, sliced almonds, and whole flaxseeds (just my preference).  I too, thought a teaspoon of salt enhanced the flavor.
To cook it, I separated the mixture onto 2 cookie sheets, lined in foil and sprayed with cooking spray.  I placed both pans into the preheated **375 degree** oven for 12 mins. stirring after 6 mins.  I then lowered the heat to 300 degrees, stirred it once more, and returned it to  a 300 degree oven for an additional 6 mins.  I then turned the oven off completely, do not open the oven door to check or stir it again.  The trick is to leave it in the oven until the oven with the granola inside, has cooled down completely..  This cuts the baking time to 18 mins., and makes it all very crunchy, but not overdone!  When it comes out of the oven, completely cooled, I added white raisins, and craisins.  So very yummy.  
One last note...after removing the cooled granola from the oven (BEFORE adding the craisins/raisins) reserve 1-2 cups and add chocolate, or carob chips, to to the reserved granola, it's perfect on top ice cream or frozen yogurt!!!

Fantastic!  I used cranberries & pecans instead of raisins and almonds.  Also added in 1/2 cup of sunflower seeds and 1/2 cup cashew pieces.  I only had to bake for 45 minutes.  Will definitely make this again.

Exactly what I was looking for, a bare bones, basic granola with only a few inexpensive ingredients. The possibilities to customize this are endless.

Excellent, easy recipe. I add a teaspoon of salt and some real maple syrup in place of half the brown sugar. I also used walnuts and pecans and dried cranberries. We love this granola! And I made some for gifts for teachers at my sons' preschool and was asked for the recipe, and now they make it all the time too.

The cup of water threw me for a loop because I've never seen a recipe that calls for that much--but it made it clump better which is exactly what I was hoping for.  Great, sweet flavor.  I added dried cranberries and chopped almonds at the end and omitted the nutmeg.  This will now be my go to recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This was just what I was looking for!! Very easy to throw together, sweet and balanced. I only cooked mine for 30 minutes total, it was crispy enough for us. I will certainly be making this again!

This is very good!  I subbed out some honey for some of the brown sugar, just for preference.  I don't like raisins so I subbed out for some dried cranberries.  Loved the coconut!  Served this on some plain yogurt I had sweetened with honey and sliced strawberries.  Nice breakfast!

This is the first granola recipe that hasn't either burnt, stuck to my pan or been sickly sweet. Would make again! would add some sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, or other small nuts to add to the recipe.

Good granola recipe.  I didn't have wheat germ, but other than that I used the recipe exactly as written.  I only baked for 45 minutes as the coconut was starting to look and smelling burnt, so I suggest watching it carefully during the last half hour.  Great tasting!  Thank you.

I didn't have flaked coconut, so didn't use it. Like others reviewers I changed it up a bit. I added about a tbsp and a half of honey, and used virgin coconut oil instead of regular oil. I added dried cranberries, yogurt covered raisins, chopped pecans, and chopped almonds. It was a nice granola, but have made better. Google "Lazy granola", in my opinion, that recipe tastes better!

I combine soft butter, cinnamon, molasses, honey, and maple syrup with some almond extract, maple extract, and vanilla. Mix it then pour it over flour dusted oats, dried cranberries & raisins & chopped almonds.  Stir it while pouring the mixture. Then I use my hands and work the mixture into the oats then I add just a little brown sugar to taste. I bake mine with a very watchful eye at 400 degrees.  I test it for crunchiness.  I always make this recipe at the end of the month when I am out of box cereal and I want some cereal.  I always have theses Items in my pantry so it is nice to have when your out of box cereal.  I forgot to add some salt.

Mt 8 yr old granddaughter & I made this recipe, only making a few substitutions, & it was AMAZING! I have tried a lot of granola recipes, &had just not found that right one, well this is it! The entire family loves it. We substituted coconut oil for the vegetable oil, dried blueberries for the raisins, & then 1/2 brown sugar & 1/2 Stevia. I'm sure any dried fruit will do, and if you like it on the sweeter side, stick with all brown sugar, but I definitely recommend the coconut oil! It is so much heathy, & has a great flavor.

This is a very versatile recipe and after trying about a dozen others, I've come back to this one as my keeper. I love chunky granola and the water in this recipe does the trick. I tend to cut down on the oil and have added applesauce as a replacement with good results. I typically at least double the cinnamon  and add pumpkin seeds and/or sunflower seeds, and I put the raisins in at the beginning because I prefer them dried out and chewy. Also add dried cranberries once it comes out of the oven (45 minutes does it rather than the hour recommended in the recipe).

This is a very good and tasty recipe as is, but I added dried cranberries and walnuts. It is a great recipe to add any nut or cereal oat you like.

I love this recipe. I usually add it to my yogurt but have also eaten it as is. It's great! I found that 35-40 minutes is just right. I felt that it was overcooked when I went any longer. It is great with dried cherries.

I left out the wheat germ and raisins and added almonds and walnuts before toasting.  Also used instant oats instead of old fashioned since that is what I had.  Very good!

Needs a little salt.  Has that typical metalic taste that unsalted oatmeal has. Otherwise quite good.

I just made this and threw it out. I followed the recipe exactly and by 45 minutes it had burned. I will try this recipe again either lowering the temp to 250 and baking for 1 hour stirring every 15 OR baking at 325 for 30 min and stirring every 10. It smelled great before it burned though!!

325 for an hour seems too long; the granola was close to being burnt, even with stirring every 15 minutes.

I had never made granola before. I remember my grandma making it when I was a kid. 
I followed it pretty closely, except I added some honey,  cranberries, walnuts, & used I little bit of melted down coconut oil as well a little veg. Oil. It turned out pretty good. Super yummy in milk. I feel like I made my own organic cereal !!!

Loved this recipe and very easy to modify to taste.  I added maple syrup instead of sugar and instead of almonds put in pecans.  Instead of wheat germ, added wheat bran. Added chopped stem ginger and a bit of the ginger syrup from the jar, too, before baking.  Instead of nutmeg, added a teaspoon of ground ginger.  Wonderful gingery granola!  Will use again and again

My first time making granola, so I have nothing to compare, but I'll be making this again soon.  I couldn't find wheat germ at my grocery store so I subbed an extra cup of oats.  It didn't clump as much as I hoped, but the flakes turned out nice and crunchy.

Fantastic!  I didn't have the wheat germ so I left it out. I added the coconut when 15minutes were left for baking so the coconut would not burn. Delicious!  I added dried cranberries,almonds, after baking.

I was very unsure of this when i pulled it out of the oven looked very dry and smelled as if the nutmeg would be too much. But the next morning my wife had it on yogurt and i ate as cereal and was very good. I will make again using different nuts and fruits in it. Would recommend it.

This was sooooo good! Of course I tweaked the recipe a bit due to availability of ingredients, I added walnuts to the oats, omitted the nutmeg (didn't have any), used sweetened, shredded coconut, and olive oil for the oil. It turned out fabulous! Perfectly golden and sweet. I didn't think it was too sweet at all with one cup of brown sugar (I used dark), the flavors were perfect. Not to mention my whole house had the enticing smell of brown sugar and vanilla wafting throughout! A big plus! I stirred the oats every 15 minutes as instructed, but I only cooked them for around 50 minutes, I think the full hour would have been a bit too much. I added dried cranberries once cooled and it is perfection! Thank you so much Jaime for the amazing recipe! I definitely will be making this again and again!

Easy and delicious!  I  have made it numerous times just as the recipe directs and its  a favorite. After cooking,  I add various kinds of dried fruit, berries and nuts ... it would be hard to find a more delicious granola.

I’m trying to cut down on sugar so I made this recipe using only a quarter cup of brown sugar and about a quarter cup of Splenda. Otherwise just made it the same. It’s really easy to make and very good I bake it in 15 minute intervals. Stir and add the coconut and the almonds to toast after the first and second intervals.

This is a great basic recipe. Very easy to make.  If you're using a convection oven, stir every 10 minutes, and reduce the baking time.  The full hour got it too toasty, but 30-40 minutes was perfect.

I made two batches of this to take on a four-day school field trip with 30 middle schoolers.  The first batch I used the raisins and slivered almonds (and a full cup of coconut flakes).  On the second batch, I used 8 oz. craisins and I pulsed two leftover chocolate bars I had stashed from Christmas.  The kids gobbled it up and loved it.    I'll never buy granola again.

Very tasty. ...I changed up and used 1/2 cup of brown rice syrup instead of the brown sugar. I did not have all 5 cups of oatmeal and used 1 cup of oat bran  and 1/2 c. flax seeds in its place. It worked fine.

I've been making a similar recipe every week for years (I add no wheat germ).  If you oil the pans, you need add NO oil and it's still delicious.  I reduce the sugar/water and coconut for health reasons, since I eat a lot of it.

this is a great recipe as is, it's an even better base to make your own. We try to make ours as healthy as possible so we use coconut oil, also a little extra water we like it clumpy. We also add a bag of sliced almonds, some chopped pecans, craisins, flax seed, bran, and in place of brown sugar we use sugar free maple syrup and a little honey. We bake it at 350 for 45 minutes it gets dark and crunchy but not burnt in less time

I used the basic recipe, added 1/4 of molasses, 1/4 honey and a TON of fresh fruit that I dried.  Very tasty.
