I thought is was great, and so did my family.  I did use apple cider instead of wine, and spicy Italian sausage instead of bratwurst, and 6 black peppercorns instead of white pepper.  ...So in short, I used this recipe as a framework and filled in the white spaces with whatever I had on hand, but like I said, we thought is was great.

I made this recipe exactly as written and was disappointed in the lack of contrasting flavors in this soup.  The seasoning was adequate, but the sweet potato and carrot were too similar.  If I try it again, I'll substitute an alternative for the carrot to improve the appearance and variation in texture.

I substituted frozen, Italian-style, turkey meatballs for the bratwurst - because I had them and theyâ€™re a more heart-friendly ingredient.  It was delicious.  I added 1/2 to 1 C. of extra water to tone the strength and make a better soup consistency.  It was delicious!

I just finished a big bowl of this and some beer bread and it was delicious. I used turkey smoked sasuage because that was in the freezer and  browned it first.  This recipe would be dellicious with almost any combo of veggies, but the ones in the recipe are good enough for me. I have leftovers and I am very happy!

I made this recipe, substituting white wine with sherry cooking wine, cut the bratwurst in half since that's all I had on hand, used 1 sweet potato and 1 white potato and added 1 cup apple juice along with the broth.  Then I sprinkled in just a bit of cajun seasoning.  It is delicious and definitely one to make again and again!

I used yams instead of sweet potatoes because that's all the grocery store had, I browned the turkey bratwurst even though the recipe doesn't say anything about it, and I only used 1/4 cup rice cooking wine because it was the first time I'd ever used it and I was worried about not liking it.  I had to almost double the broth to keep it a soup instead of a stew, but I thought it turned out great!  The flavors and spices mixed very nicely; makes a very good fall/winter soup.  This recipe will definitely be made again, although I don't know if I'm going to increase the amount of wine from 1/4 cup that I used to 1/2 cup that it calls for... I like it just the way I made it so much!

If you are looking for consistency, color, and flavor you will have to increase your flavor to taste.  Bouillon cubes (chicken and beef), fresh herbs, garlic, red onion, and substituting corn for carrots.  Takes good to great!

I make something very similar to this with great results.  Instead of the other seasonings, try adding cajon season to taste.

The combination of cabbage and sweet potatoes amazingly works.  This recipe is highly recommended for flavor and simplicity!

This recipe didn't do it for me. The veggies were really overcooked and the turkey sausage lost a lot of flavor during cooking.

Used 1/4 vinegar & 1/4 C water instead of the wine.  Might try to reduce to 1/8 C & 3/8 C mix next time.  Increased chicken broth to 4 C.  Pretty good.

We enjoyed the flavor of this soup.  I added about a cup more broth for a more soup-like consistency.  I will certainly make this again.  Thanks!

I agree that this is a good low budget Winter soup.  I also agree that it is a bit bland.  I used cooking sherry instead of white wine [just because that is what I had on hand].  Also, for my second serving, I added a healthy squirt of yellow mustard along with some fresh baked yellow corn bread. A veritable Winter feast.

This soup is delicious! I came across this recipe late this afternoon and decided to make it since I had everything it called for.  The only thing I didn't have was the 5-6 hours it would take in the crockpot.  I went fowarded with the recipe, but cooked it on the stove.   I have fresh thyme and rosemary so I  chose to use that.  I also had some leftover fresh garlic and 1/2 onion so I  put that in with the sausage and browned it all together before throwing it all into my  Dutch oven.  I followed the instructions as written, but only had to cook it until the sweet potatoes were soft... approximately  40 minutes.
So much flavor in a dish that was so easy to put together!  My husband loves this!  Thanks for the recipe!

Easy, Economical, Healthy. The sweet potato was a nice balance of flavor to the strong cabbage flavor.

This was quite yummy! I added a yellow potato and a parsnip. I also took the suggestions of others and added 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar and 4 cups instead of 3 of veggie broth.

I agree with a reviewer who mentioned the similarities between the carrots and the sweet potatoes. The soup just didn't taste good. I followed the recipe exactly as written, but wondered if I goofed up somehow in its construction.

I used this recipe for a starting point. I read the other reviews and decided to season it to my preference. Surprisingly, the ingredients taste pretty good together.

I made this, and although it's still simmering, I had a bowl and it's awesome!  I made some changes.  

(1) I added a mix of hot and sweet italian sausage (1 lb)
(2) I added 6 cups of broth and no wine
(3) I added an onion
(4) I added minced garlic
(5) Due to the increased size, I added a lot more thyme and rosemary
(6) I added an entire head of napa cabbage and more sweet potatoes (white w/purple skin so it would be more colorful)

Turned out great! I'd definitely make again with the changes above.  I think the amount of sausage in the original would be far too overwhelming.

I have three picky eater grade-school boys who weren't too excited about eating a cabbage soup, but they all ate it up and enjoyed it quite a bit. I replaced the sweet potatoes with white potatoes, and added a cup of water for more broth. For anyone in weight watchers, based on the ingredients I used, this soup calculated at 3 smart points for 1 cup of soup and is quite filling. Overall, we enjoyed and it's super easy to make.

Delicious!!! This soup/stew recipe was great, but I added to it.
I added the following ingredients:
2 Garlc cloves
2 slices of jalapeÃ±o (so refreshing.. I could've added more)
1/3 cup of red onion
2 celery sticks
1/2 teaspoon of caraway seeds
1/2 teaspoon of adobo
Chicken bullion
A sprinkle of dry mustard
Additional Rosemary
I didn't have Thyme, so I used Bells seasonings. 
I cooked it on low for 8 hours.. I had too! I turned it on when I left the house, and turned it off when I came home.. 
Yummy!!! 
I paired it up with some beer bread... 
GOOD EATS!!! 
Thank you! :o)

Followed exactly and found that like others the sweet potato and carrot are too similar. I think using white potatoes might have been better.

The cabbage never softened up. The wine made the sausage taste weird.

My Hubby and I loved this soup! I added 1 small chopped  onion to the bottom of crockpot, an extra can of chicken broth, and in the last 45 minutes of cooking added 1 can of white cannelli beans, fully drained. The soup over all had a delicate sweet flavor which was a nice surprise. May try a little corn or chopped small rutabega next time,  since the carrots and sweet potatoes were similar in flavor. Definitely will be making this again! Thank you for sharing

I used the basic recipe but based on previous reviews I added a chopped onion, minced garlic and a can of diced tomatoes; also I used turkey kielbasa.  It was a delicious, satisfying soup

This is just great! I didn't have the sausage it called for but used some chicken spinach sausage, and it turned out delicious. The sweet potatoes dissolve and thicken the soup and give it a really good sweet taste.

This was delicious.  I used sausage and extra veggies, and did it on the stove top rather than in the slow cooker.  We loved it, thanks for sharing!

Substitute white potatoes for sweet potatoes. Use kielbasa instead of turkey bratwurst and beef broth instead of chicken broth. Add broccoli at the end.

Great dinner and easy to make.  I substituted cider for wine as suggested by another reader.  I will make this again.

I used one HUGE sweet potato only and omitted the wine. Used some turkey and cheese bratwursts i had on hand and browned in a skillet first.  This turned out really well and I'm gonna add this to my rotation of foods. Smelled so good cooking all night!

Used fresh rosemary and thyme, and added some dijon mustard for a little tang. Served with rye bread and pickled eggs.
