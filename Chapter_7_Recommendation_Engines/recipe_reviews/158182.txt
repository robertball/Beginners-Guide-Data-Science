Light, refreshing dressing that lets the salad greens shine and be the star. Didn't add the Parmesan to the dressing, preferring to add freshly shaved Parmigiano-Reggiano right before serving. Also elected to omit the sugar, even tho' it was a slight amount. Hubs and I really enjoyed this. I was particularly appreciative of the olive oil to vinegar ratio, which made this much less acrid and tangy than other dressings.  Nice.

Excellent salad dressing!  It's more of a vinaigrette than a traditional Caesar dressing. It's great with or without the Parmesan cheese.  And, it doesn't overpower your mixed greens - this is a definite keeper.

Pretty good tasting, but boy is it ugly looking! Maybe I'll try it with white balsamic to make the colour less brown. If you could make it nicer looking, it would work well as a dip for baby romaine leaves, mushrooms, baby carrots and breadsticks, but it needs a looks makeover before anyone would venture to try it.

I made this and served it in France (where the dressing bar is very high), and there were smiles all around. I couldn't find white wine vinegar, though, so I used all balsamic. It didn't seem to matter. The dressing came together (though it needed more stirring after sitting out a while), and it worked great as a dressing for our chicken caesar wraps.  I'm definitely bookmarking this recipe to reuse!

This is really tasty.   When I make salad dressing, I always leave out the oil.  When ready to serve, I toss the salad with oil to coat, then add the dressing.  This works a lot better because the dressing never gets overly oily.  Also I left out the salt because Parmesan  cheese is very salty.

I got used to the store-bought caesar vinaigrette, but realized after making dinner + salads one evening that I was out- so I searched and found this recipe.  I followed it pretty closely, except I used the "green can" parm cheese and 1 tsp of minced garlic in water instead of mincing my own. :P  It turned out great! Tasted way better than the storebought stuff. I'm never buying pre-made caesar dressing again!

This is really good, but I cut back on the oil. I normally like a more vinegar-y dressing, so I knew I wouldn't like that amount of oil. However, the flavor turned out great - bet it would be a great marinade too! Thanks!

although it's not a classic Caesar dressing; it's simple and delicious alternative to those who do not like anchovies.

I really did not care for this at all. My hubs didn't either, but he's not a fan of vinegar based dressings anyways. :( Most noticeable to me, the vinegar / oil ratio was terribly off. My dressing tasted like straight up EVOO - and rightfully so... 2/3 c. of olive oil is far too much! Even store-bought vinaigrette isn't this oily! Perhaps my taste buds are "off," but I won't be attempting this again to find out. Maybe this will suit your tastes, but it really didn't do anything for us. Thanks anyways, chefmommy. :-)

Don't go in expecting regular caesar dressing (the creamy or vinaigrette kind)... but it was good and a bit different from the usual. I think the lemon zest taste was a bit off for me--next time I'll probably just do a squirt of fresh lemon juice instead. I also cut down on the oil--used about 1/2 cup instead of 2/3 cup. 

Use an immersion blender to emulsify it--we didn't have any problem with oil separation after that!

Great recipe using things you have on hand!  Didn't have white wine vinegar, so used one Tbsp lemon juice and one Tbsp balsamic instead.  And only used 1/2 c. oil.  Tasted so fresh!

tasty when stirred up enough.  My husband tried to use it when it had settled and didn't stir it enough and got a big mouth full of oil!   Will probably not use often ; )

This is a very good Caesar Vinaigrette dressing.  It is much thinner with a totally different texture than your regular creamy vinaigrette.  We were having a “taste test” to choose a dressing for the salad for Christmas dinner.  I made a traditional Caesar dressing and this one.  We were all split on our choice as we liked both of them.  I really liked how the leftovers of this held up in the refrigerator.  It stayed well blended without the separation happening with the oil and vinegars.   I will be making this recipe again.

Definitely in my rotation now.  Made this for guests and everyone cheered--even my non-salad-eating husband.  I decreased the oil and plan to add a little water next time to reduce the calories.  Very good and easy!

Made as described.  Very refreshing.  For me the lemon zest was a key ingredient.  I may use lemon olive oil next time.

Surprisingly with such good reviews, I found this dressing to be terrible.  The olive oil overpowers everything else so it tastes like oil and nothing else.  In order to make this work, I may leave out the oil all together or triple the spices, mustard and vinegars.  UPDATE 081512 I tripled the spices, increased the vinegar and mustard and left it in the fridge overnight.  Definitely better this time around though I still think adjustments need to be made.  Decreasing the oil may make this a good chicken marinade maybe?  However, I did use this over salad greens and after the changes, it did turn out pretty good.

Sorry, but we didn't like this at all. It's not really a caesar vinaigrette/dressing per se, there's no taste to suggest it would enhance a Caesar salad, save for the freshly grated parmesan. This is a vinaigrette that would be more suitable for a regular green salad, but, with far less oil. I should have picked up on the excess oil when mixing the dressing and reduced it accordingly, but unfortunately, I followed the recipe exactly.

Absolutley loved this dressing. Its the perfect combination of tangy and sweet and adds flavor to even the plainest of salads. The only problem was that my boyfriend, who isn't that fond of vinagrettes to begin with, really didn't care for the sweetness to it He doesn't really care for balsamic at all however. For all those who like it sweet and spicy, this is the dressing for you.

Delicious, just delicious. Simply put this is a seafood and gluten free caesar dressing. It is a light and tasty way to liven up your salad like a caesar salad but without the eggs and Worcestershire sauce. Thank you Chefmommy for your recipe.

I cheated and used the roasted garlic in a tube. It gave the dressing a nice touch. I will have to get some white balsamic in future, mine is very dark not yellow like the picture.

I'm always looking for good salad dressing recipes because my husband and I eat so much salad.  This one had a nice light flavor and wasn't overpowering like some balsamic vinaigrettes.  It also had a hint of sweetness along with tanginess, which I like.

This was my first time following a recipe for dressing, normally I just throw a bunch of things together and hope they work, I added some more garlic salt and lemon juice to complement the main dish of the night. Nice dressing!

Tasty dressing, though I wouldn't really describe it as a caesar. More like a vinaigrette that is slightly reminiscent of a caesar. I didn't have any Italian seasoning so I used a sprinkle of basil, thyme and oregano each and I used about half the recommended lemon zest because that's all I had on hand.

Dressing was tasty but I wouldn’t call it a Caesar dressing. Balsamic vinegar didn’t go with what I normally call Caesar salad.

Yummy.  I ran out of olive oil, so I used coconut oil instead.  I also subbed a few drops of lemon juice for the lemon zest.

Delicious! I added only half the salt and squeezed in a pea size amount of anchovy paste. Will try next time without the balsamic.

Not a fan of super oily dressing, or sugar in my salad dressing.
Prefer the authentic dressing for Caesar, with egg & anchovies.

I HAVE tried it before and almost panicked when I wanted to use it again today for a special Father's day meal.Fortunately I was able to retrieve it from an e-mail I had sent my brother with the recipe.It was too good not to share! Thank you so much and keep them coming-please. From a friend in Canada. :)

While I feel the recipe name could be a little misleading, I still cannot resist giving this 5 stars due to the wonderful flavor of this dressing!!  It does not particularly remind me of a traditional Caesar dressing, but it is bright, citrus-y and refreshing, nonetheless!  I loved it and will be putting it in me keeper file!  Thanks for sharing, chefmommy!

Great basic for just romaine. Cut parmesan cheese except for topping and do not try to be creative with toppings. No ham, eggs, radish, work well with this dressing.

Absolutely delicious! Doesn't really taste like caesar at all, but it's amazing on its own. My modifications: I skip the parmesean, double the recipe, and use honey instead of sugar, then add more to taste if it's too acidic.

It's amazing on a kale salad with some shaved onions, carrots and dried cranberries. 

I did the math and it's about 86calories per tbsp. Mmm!

I loved this!  I used white balsamic in place the balsamic and left the sugar out. Although it does not replicate Caesar, it is delish!
