I only made one change, I omitted the cinnamon. I threw all my ingredients into my smaller crockpot and let it go all day while I was at work. Once I got home, all I had to do was mush it a bit with an old fashioned potato masher (and after taste testing this, add a scant quarter cup of sugar). The smell of this was AMAZING. You could smell it outside! Simple as could be, ten million times tastier than homemade applesauce any day. Who knew?

I have been processing pears for the last 2 weeks. Pear Apple Sauce, Pear Jam, Pear Honey and now Pear Sauce.
What a wonderful taste. I don't vary on a recipe the first time out but I came home without lemon juice (forgot to put on my list)and was just too pooped to go back shopping. I used 15 pears, 2 tbsp. of fresh Pineapple juice (I used for the Pear Honey) and a couple of shakes of ground cinnamon. That's it. Followed the process, used a hand blender and the results were wonderful. Such a pure and healthy sauce we will enjoy until I make again next year. You gotta love, "all natural, no sugar added". This recipe is in my book to stay. Thank you Steve.

Came out delicious. I'd recommend a few teaspoons of lemon - I used 3 pears so work off that. As well the water amount should be updated as you'll need to have it close to covering for it not to burn and get to the proper consistency once it's cooked.

This recipe wAs delicious and a hit with the entire family. I served it with pork chops instead of applesauce. I didn't have quite enough pears so I added a baked Fuji apple to it. I will definitely make this recipe again.

Awesome way to use soft pears!  I used a food mill to remove the seeds and cores and it worked great.

I used small cooking pears, which were hard. Adjustments were made but same ingredients. Turned out very tasty and delicious.
