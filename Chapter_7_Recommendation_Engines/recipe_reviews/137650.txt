As the author of this recipe, I'd like to respond to some recent reviews. Indeed, this is a simple soup born out of generations that lived simply and were lucky if they had meat once every six months. The light and simple flavors are meant to be savored, and the vinegar at the end is imperative - it really adds a much needed dimension of flavour to the soup, and I'd never eat the soup without the vinegar! I use red wine vinegar. *** Also, someone commented on the soup not being healthy - with 1 tablespoon of olive oil per serving, and under 15 grams of (healthy) fat, I don't see how it could be considered otherwise! Anyone who knows anything about the revered Mediterranean diet knows that one of its virtues is olive oil as the main source of (healthy) fat. Skip the drizzle of olive oil at the end (which I often do) if you're scared of too much fat. *** Finally, for those who don't like rosemary, feel free to skip it - not everyone in Greece uses rosemary when making Fakes. Thanks and enjoy!

My whole family loved this soup, even the two picky teenagers.  Don't be shy when adding the vinegar it defiantly needed it. Delicious!

I make this all the time - It's pretty much a staple in my house now. I find that it is a very forgiving recipe. Make it with or without tomato paste; I actually prefer it without. Tonight I didn't have onion so I just used extra carrot and added a can of tomatoes. It's always yummy and satisfying. You have to add the vinegar though, it makes it much more flavorful. It doesn't matter what kind you use, I use balsamic most of the time. Perfect with crusty french bread and goat cheese..yum!

Update: I recently began experimenting with the recipe by adding 3 diced and peeled red potatoes, a can of diced tomatoes, and a dash of cayenne. Perhaps not as traditional but delicious nonetheless!

My mom wouldn't give me a recipe for fakes because she said it was just in her head and I should just learn by watching but then she would never show me how to make them! So I searched the internet and your recipe seemed to be closest to what I thought it should. And it was! Delicious! Tastes just like my mom's. Don't tell HER though. ;)

I just recently went vegetarian for health and weight loss. This is one of the first recipes I tried. Wonderful! 

I used broth instead of water. Out of habit I accidentally used chicken broth, however next time i will use veggie broth.

I also added an extra carrot and a finaly chopped zucchini for extra veggies. In addition, I didn't have brown lentils on hand - i had red, black and pearl barley. So i did 2 oz red lentils, 2 oz barley and 4 oz red lentils.

It was superb. I def recommend to everyone.

Fakes are something out of this world! Super nutritious, good for you and with tons of flavor! Just a few tips from someone who is Greek:
1. Add a lot of carrots. They help with not feeling "heavy" after having a plate of legumes.
2. DO NOT FORGET TO RINSE THEM AFTER BOILING FOR A WHILE! IT IS A CRUCIAL STEP TO COOKING FAKES. IF YOU SKIP THIS STEP YOU WILL BE LEFT WITH LEGUMES TASTING LIKE DOG FOOD. YOU DO NOT WANT TO DO THIS.
3. Sprinkle some grated Greek cheese on top of your plate ex. xerotiri which is salty or something similar to it. 
4. Grind some fresh black pepper.
5. Finally, for an extra boost of flavor add a few drops of mild Tabasco.... Fakes will soon become your new best -comfort food...

Easy to make, and delicious, especially when reheated the following day. I doubled the quantity of spices, and used chicken broth instead of water, but regardless of how you tweak this recipe the red wine vinegar topper is an absolute must!

This is very close to a recipe my mother would make when I was growing up.  We didn't have a lot of money and this was a very economical yet nutritional and a very healthy meal.  Serve with some crusty Italian bread and you have a real winner.  My mom was Italian but didn't put the tomato or vinegar in it - she did add about a cup of chopped celery - she also didn't use rosemary.  I know from making it more often than I can count that I will love this and will try it with the vinegar and rosemary.  Can't belive some thought it was not healthy - just the fiber alone is worth it.  Cut down on the oil if you must.  This is not a highly spiced soup - it's savory and great on a rainy day.  Thanks so much Diana for posting this one - it's comfort food and real winner in my book!

I have tried several lentil soup recipes trying to duplicate one that I enjoyed in a poplular little Greek restaurant in Manhattan. This tastes almost exactly like it.  It is delicious, easy, healthy and inexpensive.  I put in a bit more tomato paste & a pinch of herbs de provence & a very little bit of fresh rosemary.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.  I rinsed the lentils as another reviewer recommended & used a good splash of vinegar for each serving.  This is a definite keeper!

Quick & EZ . Excellent flavor. If someone said "not enuf flavor, or boring", clearly they did not follow this recipe. It even says salt & pepper to taste. I added a bit more tomato paste, and cauliflower, but I sure didn't need to! YUM!!

This was delicious!!!! I let the lentils soak for an hour and a half before cooking, and so didn't need to boil/rinse as in step 1. They came out very soft. Also used chicken broth and left out the bay leaves as I was out of them. Definitely add the vinegar, 1-2 tablespoons per bowl right before you serve. Great Recipe!!!

Outstanding blend of flavors - one of those classic recipes in which every ingredient is essential, and the final product transcends the simplicity of the ingredients! I finally, finally had the time to make this soup, and it is fabulous!! I *love* lentils, and this soup - my gosh, it is wonderful, Diana! Thank you for sharing this recipe! :) I also liked your comment about this soup being meatless. You said, "this is a simple soup, born out of generations of (those) that lived simply and were lucky if they had meat once every six months." Nothing could be further from the truth - no further commentary needed. (Also, this is not a recipe for use in any slow cooker; this is a serious soup, that needs attention.) I used Greek Cook's suggestion of adding more carrots, and I also added chopped celery, along with some freshly-minced parsley (used a mezzaluna), for both flavor and additional color. I also added a sprig of fresh rosemary to this soup (see Step 2 in the directions), along with 2 bouillon cubes as another reviewer had mentioned - one chicken, and one vegetable. I also added more garlic, since I love garlic! I used the "Ponti" brand of red wine vinegar -  I put that out on the table in a nice carafe, to be used as needed, along with a small carafe of extra virgin olive oil!! (Please do NOT use balsamic vinegar, as that is too strong for this delicate dish.) Serve with a nice bread, and there you have it! Excellent!! Thanks again, Diana!! ~ Lauren

outstanding! I've been looking for the lentil soup recipe my mom always made but couldn't find it because I thought it was an Italian recipe, turns out it is this recipe (minus the vinegar)! I'm so glad to have found it. It really is delicious. I didn't have any tomato paste so I just chopped up some tomatoes instead. YUMMY. THANK YOU!

This is delicious!  Easy to make too.  The vinegar is a must.  I've made this a few times now, and I like to make a bunch of extra to keep on hand for lunch during the week.

Oh my goodness, this was so yummy.  At the end, before I added the salt/pepper/paste, I tasted it, and it was so dang good that I didn't even think it needed added salt or pepper.  And because I so loved the taste as is, I didn't even add the paste.  I doubled the recipe..for leftovers..but only added 6 cups water and used that really $$ veggie broth powder from the HFS.  I used 3 tsps of powder.  Oh..seeing as I love garlic so much, I added 6 cloves.  YES.  SIX. :O  To die for recipe Diana.  I forgot to mention. I took a bit of the soup aside and tried the vinegar, and I really did not like that taste.  I will leave that as an aside for anyone who wants to add on their own.

I have made this several times and it is WONDERFUL!!  My boyfriend is from Athens and he is always talking about his grandmothers cooking.  I made this soup for him and he absolutely loved it.  So did the rest of our friends! =)  He likes a LOT of olive oil so I increased the amount of oil.  I also love to use Cavendar's Greek Seasoning.  It adds a really nice touch.  I love this soup because it tastes so good and it is really healthy too.  It's also very inexpensive to make.  AWESOME recipe Diana.  Thanks so much.  I brought a little bit of grandma back with this one! =)

Very good. When I read this I got hungry for it and had to have it... It reminded me of my familys recipe which I hadn't thought of until the end when I was reading about the vinegar & I realized where the vinegar or tart flavor came from!  Being of Lebanese background we made this very similarly but instead of vinegar we used lemon juice & we used dried mint instead of oregano & rosemary.  I like both recipes and glad I tried this one. I added a few flakes of red pepper and had it with a Greek type salad & small piece of homemade veggie pizza to take place of the bread-which I feel rounds out the meal.  MUST HAVE BREAD!!  : >)  Thank you for the good Sunday night meal.

Great recipe! As close as you're going get to authentic village style lentil soup. I grew up eating this soup, but really started appreciating and savoring at the Grecian Taverna in Chicago. It's a great hardy soup for the winter months ahead. Vinegar and extra virgin olive oil are a must with a lot good bread, of course.

Great recipe!  Married to a Greek and made this for hubby during fasting time for Easter. Its delicious! I used green lentils (forgot it was brown lentils) which is why it turned out lighter.  Taste is amazing!  Better than the can stuff!!! Would highly recommend this recipe to anyone!

PERFECT! This recipe is amazingly delicious. Follow every step and you can't go wrong. The lentils are tender and the flavors are divine. I have sometimes served it over rice.

My mother-in-law grew up in Southern Greece and ran a restaurant with her now-passed husband for several years.  Not much gets out of her kitchen without a healthy dose of cinnamon, which is excellent for flavor and digestion.

This recipe produced a soup that is awfully close to hers and very good, although I made some modifications.    I substituted chicken stock for the water, I added two stalks of celery, I skipped the rosemary, and I probably didn't use a full quarter cup of olive oil (I sprayed my pot with Pam Olive Oil and then went around the pan two or three times with a drizzle of olive oil).  Then, REALLY IMPORTANTLY, I added a cinnamon stick when simmering the lentils  You could just as easily use ground cinnamon if you don't have a stick.  Also, I didn't skimp on the tomato paste or the oregano--I probably added about 1/2 of a small can of tomato paste and a scant tablespoon of oregano (I use dried and I always crush it by rubbing my palms together over the stock pot as I add it to the soup--just because that's how my MIL does it).  Because I used stock, I skipped the additional salt.

My husband liked it without the vinegar, I would recommend adding a little (not a lot) for brightness.  With the cinnamon, you really could go either way.  I didn't see the need to add olive oil at the end as a garnish so I skipped that.

This is a great meal that will fill you up, is cheap, relatively easy to make, and will keep in the fridge for a week if you make extras.

Nothing like finding traditional Greek recipes on the web.  My mother-in-law (she pasted away 15 years ago) made this recipe many times and I would watch.  I tried to duplicate this from memory to no avail.  Not like Yai-yai's I would here. I tried your recipe and waited for my husbands and daughter's response.  Got so many oohs and aahs along with a stroll down memory lane with thoughts of my mother-in-law on how she cooked with so much love.  I realized in the past the ingredient I left out was the tomato paste and I also over cooked the lentils.  Likeyou said, the vinegar makes this dish.  I keep the vinegar on the table because my hubby puts in alot.  Thanks a bunch. :)

This recipe is ridiculous!! Seriously, it's out of this world. I've made three different lentil soups from this site and they were pretty good but this one takes the cake! I doubled all of the spices in this recipe (I find that a lot of recipes on this site are very bland) and the flavor was amazing! Delish!

Love this!  Very similar to the recipe I learned from my Greek mother-in-law.  We usually add carrots, celery, and garlic.  On occasion, we've added fresh shredded spinach (near the end of the cooking time).  Sometimes, we've added a chopped potato or two, earlier in the cooking process.  Makes it a little heartier.  The vinegar is a must, for that tangy taste that makes this soup so satisfying.

My Greek friend brought this soup into work and I needed the recipe. Her recipes is very similar but she uses a small can of tomato sauce instead of the paste, she also adds celery and omits the rosemary, but what takes it to the another level is to add a splash of red wine vinegar before serving. A must try.

So excited to find this recipe. Greek lentil soup is a fave in our house, having a Greek father! I haven't made it in a while, and could not find my tried & true recipe.  This is it..or tastes darn close.  You must use the vinegar..it's the only way to go...and makes a healthy soup more delish! Great soup for chilly winter evening, and great for energy!!

My husband is a Greek chef and this recipe is the closest that I found to his. He does a few things a little differently though that some of you may want to try. He doesn't put oregano or rosemary in it, but instead puts 6 whole-spice. Also, he puts a can on tomato sauce instead of tomato paste in it. He also puts 1/2 cup of olive oil in it, but doesn't add it til the end so that it doesn't get to hot since you have to be careful with overheating olive oil. Oh we also put apple cidar vinegar on it instead.

Excellent! I made this for our meal today, but I did make a few changes. I added about 1 cup of Morning Star Sausage Crumbles and I used Vegetable Broth instead of the water. It is a MUST to spritz a bit of Balsamic Vineagar on the soup when you eat it! YUMMO!!! I made some pits bread and some home made hummus and we had a feast! THanks for posting this recipe!!!

Excellent!  Tastes just like my mom's.  I also tried it with added potatoes, canned tomatoes and cayenne pepper as one reviewer recommended and liked the variation.  We drizzled with balsamic vinegar and even my kids ages 3-11 ate it up.  Diana, thank you so much for this gem!

Great recipe just like mother served to 8 kids about once a week using navy beans instead of lentilles with a small side portion of meat like broiled pork chop or lamb. Mother used a can of diced tomatoes or stewed tomatoes instead of some of the water. Also the vinegar is essential. Also add 1/2 celery stalk per serving with the top leaves included!

I am sure this recipe is quite good--I deviated from it quite a bit, though, and added instead of a quart of water, two cups of water and a cube of bouillon and a large can of organic crushed tomatoes with basil.  I also included cubed potatoes with the carrots.  It turned out a delicious thick lentil stewy soup, vegetarian and wonderful, even leftover.  A splash of balsamic vinegar and a few crumbles of feta cheese on top was the lovely finishing touch.

I thought this soup was excellent, vinegar and all.  We served it with pumpernickel bread and made that our entire meal.  My 10-year-old son preferred it without the vinegar.

This is a very lightly flavored soup; although this bothered me at first, I appreciated this (more authentic?) lighter Mediterranean flavor.  Great w/ a side of toasted crusty bread and dipping oil!

This Fakes recipe is super easy! Traditional,  and very tasty ! I added a little bit more tomato paste and it is perfect! I always double up the recipe with the intention of freezing half (easy prep for my on the go lifestyle), however whenever my extended family gets wind that I've made it, there are never any left overs to freeze! This has become a staple in my home. I love that it's healthy and weight watchers friendly!

There is something so wholesome and satisfying to a good lentil soup. This one is DELICIOUS and I like a little drizzle of good Balsamic vinegar on it. Tangy and kind of sweet, it so complements the earthiness of the lentils. This freezes well also, for a quick dinner when you have no time to cook. Thanks Diana.

This is a delicious soup, although a little too polite for my tastes. The second time I made it I upped the spices and added 1/2 tsp cumin and a pinch of red pepper flakes. I also substituted vegetable stock for the water and a can of low sod diced tomatoes (with juice) for the paste. The vinegar garnish is a must, and I found that balsamic vinegar is better--smoother and less spiky than red wine vinegar. For a fuller meal, I accompanied the soup with Roasted Swiss Chard with Feta (on this site) and some crusty bread.

This is the perfect easy dish for a chilly fall evening and I'll be making it throughout the winter, too. It's so easy yet so delicious and nutritious. Serve with bread, cornbread or biscuits and it's a complete filling meal, especially for vegetarians!

To those that said it was bland, make certain you sauté the onion, garlic and carrots to bring out the full flavor and boil the soup with the oregano and rosemary as directed before adding the tomato paste and simmering for the remaining minutes. To achieve the proper full-bodied flavor, follow the steps and you won't be disappointed. Also, don't forget to add the salt and pepper.

My mother made this for me when I was a child.  It brought back so many memories.  Now I can make it for my family.  I used lemon juice instead of vinegar because that was at hand and drizzled a little extra virgin olive oil as well, a really good quality, so for flavour only.  Great recipe.

Great, healthy recipe, although I tend to put more spices into dishes than most so I added a bit more oregano and rosemary than the recipe called for.  I also wish a suggestion of how much vinegar to add at the end was directly in the ingredients section, because I rarely add vinegar to anything so I was unsure how much to add without overdoing it. :) But otherwise, good recipe!

Diana - I made this in Athens, GR today for my Greek boyfriend and he said they were the best fakes ever!  Thank you SO MUCH for the impressive recipe. We didn't have tomato paste so i used a pureed fresh tomato and it was great.

This is NOT something I would usually try to make, but a long time ago I bought a bag of lentils and had no idea what to do with them. I had all the other ingredients on hand so I gave it a try.   I like it! I did make some changes: double the recipe EXCEPT for the amount of oil - left that at 1/4 cup,  no rosemary, can of tomato sauce instead of paste. The vinegar at the end is delicious and necessary. I've tried both red wine and balsamic - both were good.  This was SO CHEAP to make, filling and pretty healthy (5 WW PointsPlus points/cup).

This recipe is very flexible!  I used Split Green Lentils, instead of brown, and I threw in a can of diced tomatoes, instead of tomato paste, because it's what I had on hand.  I doubled the amount of garlic.  I used chicken stock, in place of water.  This turned out delish!  I added Red Wine Vinegar, and a drizzle of olive oil to each bowl, before serving.   Had plenty left-over, and had lunch the next day (I forgot all about the vinegar and olive oil, but the soup was still delish!!).    I rated 5 stars, because this soup is very flexible, and hard to mess it up!  :)

I made this without the olive oil for a strict fast meal at church.  I added celery and softened the veggies and garlic with a slow simmer in a bit of water.  Added vinegar at the end and this was fabulous!  I can't wait to try it with the oil once Lent is over.  Everyone at church thought I cheated and added the oil, because the flavor had so much depth!  Thanks for the recipe!

I found this flavorless as written. It benefited from a teaspoon of cumin and a 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne. I served it with balsamic vinegar and feta as per another reviewers suggestion. The bites with the balsamic and feta were tasty, but overall not worth making again. This is the only dinner I've ever made that my family wouldn't finish.

Love love LOVE this! I've made it at least over a dozen times by now, my family and friends can't get enough! I've tweaked it so it's perfect for me. 
Few small changes: I use one teaspoon oregano, one teaspoon rosemary, and 3 bay leaves. Also I use 3 tablespoons tomato paste. Putting 1/2 tablespoon of the red wine vinegar at the end really gives it a nice depth of flavor. 
Try it with feta cheese and sriracha (for an extra kick) for even more flavor!

I made this in the slow cooker (2 hours on high) for my family and everyone loved it.  I just threw threw soaked lentils and all the ingredients in the pot and turned it on.  This is the traditional Italian way of making lentil soup.  The vinegar at the end is the advice that you should heed.  It doesn't actually change the flavour, just enhances.  I used apple cider vinegar.  We'll be using this recipe again.  Thank you.

This is an outstanding lentil soup, and even acceptable to my vegan friends.   It has lots of flavor and is a very healthy and hearty dish.  Thank you for sharing this with us, Diana.

This soup was delicious.  I made a double batch and followed the recipe to the letter.  I will agree that the red wine vinegar really gives it some zip.  Add it, you will not be sorry!  I let the soup sit for about 90 minutes before I ate it.  I think this helped the flavors meld together.  Next time I might add chicken or beef broth instead of water.  Maybe even some pancetta to keep the meat eaters happy i.e. the bf.  Also, I got some already cooked brown lentil's from the store which was nice as I was able to skip step 1.  
I looked forward to serving this with a nice salad and bread for a hearty and healthy well  rounded meal.  I highly recommend this soup!!

Yep, that is the authentic Greek recipe and a typical Friday meal in Greece. Very healthy indeed...May I add, other that the vinegar, accompany this with feta cheese and some sourdough bread. My family also very often had (dried) sardines on the table (for extra protein). These flavors all go great together with fakes.

I made this recipe for my potluck soup lunch at work.  It was a hit!n I did not have tomato paste, so I added a few tablespoons of tomato sauce and reduced the water by a bit.  I think next time around I might add some orzo to change it up a bit.

Delicious but I like thick lentil soup so I will keep the cover ajar for the last cooking period next time I make this.  I liked the vinegar but my daughter didn't.  The soup already has a delicious flavor.

This soup is wonderful and easy. I have made it several times now. Even my kids eat it.  Last night I tossed in some shredded chicken....not a good idea!  We all agreed I should have just left it the regular way.

I am new to cooking with lentils and since I had everything at home, I decided to give this a try for lunch today. I gotta say..I'm loving this recipe! It's very easy to make and is really healthy but great tasting! YUM. I am already planning on making another pot this week. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! It's most definitely a keeper!

OMG!!  It's simmering while I write this.  I just tasted it and it has another 5 minutes or so to simmer.  It is soooo delicious; just what I have been craving.  Such rich flavor (maybe it's the Bay leaves that make it so yummy??).  So easy, too.  Next time I will double recipe just so I have enough for as many days as possible.  I also just made the Greek Garbanzo Bean Salad and it's marinating right now.  Can't wait to eat this Greek dinner!

This is a great cold weather soup.  It's filling & delicious.  I didn't have rosemary, so I omitted it, but stuck to the recipe other than that.  I agree with other reviews I have read, the red wine vinegar & olive oil are a great addition to the soup.  My husband typically frowns on lentils, but he ate every bite of his soup & kept saying how delicious it was!  This is a keeper.

This is the best fakes soup recipe ever!  The only complaint I have is that the quantity is too small.  If you are making it for more than just yourself, double the recipe, because it is so good that everyone will want seconds!

This soup tastes great AND it's healthy!  My husband thought it was "okay, a little too healthy-tasting" but I really liked it.  Since soups usually taste better the day after they are made I made it a day ahead and I loved it.  I used vegetable broth instead of water.

This was absolutely delicious!  Thank you so much for this recipe.  The little differences I made was increase the quantity of oregano and rosemary and also added thyme.    I made for my vegetarian days of week so I added a bunch of raw spinach in the bowl before pouring hot soup so that the spinach would wilt a little.  Drizzled some olive oil and red wine vinegar and served with a whole wheat toasted topped with baba ganoush from this website.    So yummy!!!

Excellent soup and really well received by my guests who all wanted to have the recipe.  I had searched a recipe like this after having a great lentil soup at a Greek restaurant and this fit the bill perfectly.  

I used a hand blender to puree some of the lentils at the end and make a thicker soup.  Also used the balsamic vinegar as suggested by some reviewers.

Like this with balsamic, but think that the smell of two bay leaves is just overpowering. Next time will add only one leave. 1 liter (quart) of water is definitely not enough. I used 1qt of chicken stock and a few splashes of water. Love lentils!

My husband is Greek and this is EXACTLY how his family has always made this soup. My friends are always asking me if we have any lentil (or other bean) soup left over so they can try some. Most of my friends are health conscious and appreciate a low fat, protein rich soup. We always use olive oil and fresh vegetables so everyone feels good about eating at our house!  Anyone who doesn't like this recipe can tweak it but PLEASE look up the advantages of using oil iol before you do.

This is a wonderfully simple soup. Instead of tomato paste, I used a can of crushed tomatoes, and fresh herbs from my garden. Sauteed the veggies in the oil to bring out the sugars before I poured in the lentils, tomato, and chicken stock instead of water. Delicious! I'm not Greek, but I wish I were!

I really didn't expect this to amount to much after looking the ingredient list over, but man was I surprised!!  This is so delicious, light and flavorful!  Especially after you add the RWV and OO at the end.  I will serve it over rice to make it more appealing to my kids but I will certainy keep making this just how the recipe calls!  Note:  all I had on hand were red lentils not brown.

I've been using this recipe for a couple of years now. It is one of our favorites. I skip the oil at the end but that is the only thing we changed. I love this. Thanks

Great lentil soup. It's very similar to how I always made lentil soup, which is what I found appealing. The key is the vinegar at the end. I thought it was a little weird at first but it actually tasted really good. Also, I'm italian so I put grated romano or pamasean cheese on everything... that really enhances the lentils even more. Enjoy.

My significant other is Greek but his family recipe is a bit different (I leave that one for him to cook - I don't want to mess with it!). This one sounded really tasty so I tried it and now this is MY recipe for fakes :)
I followed the recipe exactly, except all I had in my pantry were red lentils so I skipped the fist step. It turned out great. I think next time I might have to double the recipe because between two of us, we almost finished it all. The vinegar is absolutely necessary to add at the end, it really enhances the flavours. Thanks for the recipe Diana.

Good, easy, inexpensive soup!  Definitely drizzle some balsamic vinegar on it to up the flavor.  I think next time, I'll add more carrots and peas as well, otherwise it was great!

First rate.  I boil this down a bit and eat it as stew instead of soup.  It's perfect the way it is.  Healthy, satisfying, easy and cheap.  Thanks!

Easy, hearty, and budget friendly soup that tastes good too!  The only change I made was to use less olive oil than the 1/4c and I also left out the rosemary.  I used a few splashes of red wine vinegar at the end of cooking.

Pretty good.  I had to tinker a bit since I didn't have carrots and I really wanted to make this for dinner last night.  I used red and orange bell peppers and canned tomatoes instead . . .probably not Greek, but I thought it worked.  I liked it okay, but I forgot the vinegar suggestion completely, so I'm  going to try that with the leftovers tonight.  Bf thought it was okay but ate all of it, so it must've been good enough!  I'm not sure about lentils in general, but I'm willing to keep trying them, and this was a good recipe to start with.  Thanks for the recipe!

I pre-soaked my lentils for about 1 1/2 hrs to speed up the cooking process.  My family loved it... I prepared it with extra garlic, oregano & rosemary and used chicken broth instead of water.  I think that this dish will become part of our weekly rotation - so easy to make & tasted great!!

I have been doctoring with this recipe on and off for a year now trying desperately to replicate the Greek Lentil Soup that they serve at my favorite two restaurants. I have finally figured it out, for those who are interested - I used 3 medium tomatoes and 1 cup of olive oil and blended the oil and tomatoes into a puree, which added thickness. That is the main modification that made the soup taste wonderful. The other modification was to use half beef-broth and half water, but I don't think it is as important as the puree - but I could swear everytime I eat at a Greek restaurant that there is some beefy taste - so if you're not a vegetarian give that a shot as well! I also cooked it in a slow-cooker for 4 hours on high which seemed to really bring out flavors and make the lentils nice and soft.

Very nice. I'm not much of a soup eater, and I was sceptical about a soup with no meat in it, but this was very good. Tasty, filling, and inexpensive. Drizzling red wine vinegar in it, immediately before eating, is a must.

I also had some lentils that I needed to cook, and on a cold, dreary day in Indiana, this fit the bill!  I did add some Greek seasoning from Penzey's.  I was leery of the vinegar at first, but after I tasted it, I agreed that this is what the lentils need.  With a splash of fresh olive oil, it was good indeed!

I really liked this soup and very glad that so many of the reviewers stressed that the red wine vinegar was a must. I like my soups very thick so I used only a little over half of the water recommended. Very good recipe.

This recipe is perfect. So easy, so quick, so delicious and so good for you. The only thing I do differently is use chicken stock instead of water. And it really is incredible how big of a difference the red wine vinegar makes... I take the soup off the heat and add a few shakes to the whole batch while it's still hot. The flavors instantly come alive.

I thought this was really good.  I had my doubts, but very tasty.  I am not a vinegar fan, but I put some basalmic vinegar on it and I agree it really brings out the flavor of the lentils.  I also didn't have tomatoe paste so I added a can of chopped tomatoes.

Overall quite good, but I made it with a bean mix instead (lentils included) and added some pasta. I also sauted the garlic and onions along with some pieces of smoked ham to give it extra flavor. The vinegar is a must, not optional. Otherwise it stays kind of bland. All in all, a very tasty and healthy recipe.

Perfect just as written! I especially love the kick from the red wine vinegar. Would even be good as a blended soup for those who want a smoother texture.

Wonderful soup.  Served to several friends who were somewhat anxious about lentils, but they loved it. I use balsamic vinegar to top it off with the olive oil and always serve with a crusty bread. Sometimes I have added a 15 oz can of diced tomatoes along with the tomato paste. Also I generally double the recipe as the lentils come in 16oz packages. One of those recipes that get better the next day!

I was skeptical at first because of the simplicity, but this has become one of my staple recipes.  The vinegar is absolutely essential in my opinion.  We make this at least twice a month.  It is cheap, nutritious, and very tasty.

This recipe is spot-on perfect, Diana.  And yes, the vinegar is a must.  I've occassionally played with this recipe and added celery and/or spinach, and on occassion a shake of paprika to the tomato paste to kick up the flavour a bit.  A huge pot doesn't last long in our home!

This recipe is so simple but oh so good. I followed the recipe exactly (normally I use broth instead of water in other recipes) and I'm glad because it came out perfectly. And like everyone else said, the vinegar adds so much more flavor, definitely do it! I will make this again not only because it is so good but because it is also very healthy.

This is very light in flavour so I tweaked it and made inauthentic Greek lentil soup. I upped the oregano and rosemary and added a touch of allspice. When cooking the lentils, I added 2 celery stalks which I discarded after cooking.

Lovely! This is a great combination of flavours and the vinegar accents ties all of the flavours together wonderfully. Very easy to make. Great recipe as is. UPDATE: In my opinion, this soup is best when it's fresh and all of the subtle flavours are still distinct and fresh. It's still good the day after, but it tasted best right after cooking.

Pretty good.  I used French green lentils, which I prefer most of the time, but I think brown lentils would have been better.  I made a double batch, and I'm hoping the flavors will be better tomorrow.

We routinely have lentil stew, but had lost my recipe. This was as close as I could find. Lentils are great for protein, and lots of veggies is good. Sometimes for the veggies I will just buy a bag of frozen vegetables (like a stir-fry mix). Super easy,and the red peppers add alot of 'zing' to the mix. Great recipe!

Excellent recipe, very tasty. I added a bit of Italian seasoning in addition and used chicken broth.. the tomato paste and red wine vinegar add depth. A little extra carrot as well, will make again.

This recipe is fantastic! We often reach for this soup when we are fasting before the holidays (no animal derived products/vegan diet). I omit the rosemary (personal preference) and double the oregano instead. I also sometimes add crushed red pepper and stir the red wine vinegar right into the pot at the very end. Otherwise, I follow the ingredients, their quantities and the instructions to a T! Thank you for this wonderful and comforting recipe!

This was just as I remembered my mother and grandmothers fakes, thank you! I used mainly chicken broth (1.5 qts) and 2 cups of water. Didn't make any other substitutions. My mother rotated between adding celery, potatoes, and/or carrots. Whatever she had on hand. Doubled the recipe to have lots of leftovers!

This was awesome and a definite keeper. Like a lot of other posts, I used broth instead of water and since I am not a big fan of rosemary I left it out and used thyme instead. 
Served with a Greek green salad, homemade hummus with tostitos scoops and leftover fresh fruit.

Really nice comfort food soup! I made it as written except in place of water I used chicken broth I had on hand from a leftover rotisserie chicken simmered down. The vinegar adds a really nice flavor. I'll likely made this again.... I have made it now twice with half chicken broth, love it, the vinegar adds so much! If your looking for a simple but slightly different soup I highly recommend it!

I don't usually like to be a recipe tweaker but I just had to with this one. It was very bland. I ended up having to add a lot of salt, pepper, and cayenne. I think next time I might substitute the water with vegetable or chicken broth.

Have just made this but adjusted for two people. The only thing missing was the Bay leaf. I was slightly let down with the lack of taste but put this down to my first attempt. Will tweak it when I try again. The Red Wine Vinegar is a must as it does lift the dish and the fibre hit is very effective. I had a small portion left so I had it the following day. It was good and shows that this dish can also be saved and set aside for a work lunch.

So amazing if you up the amount of spices and tomato paste. Give the vinegar a try- it really does add a depth of flavor! Cheap and easy to make, my family asks me for this all the time! Go-to for Meatless Mondays :)

Wow, delicious! I added chicken stock instead of water and used fresh rosemary (delicious), but otherwise the recipe was the same. We also used Balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar as that's all we had. It was amazing. I agree, the vinegar (or lemon) is an important part of the recipe. It really brings out the flavours. This will be a regular part of our menus from now on.

Delicious, full bodied, hearty soup- vinegar is imperative!  This is a wonderful, healthy option for vegetarians and meat eaters! We were reluctant to add vinegar however once we did it brought this dish to another level- amazing! I usually double carrots for extra vitamin and add locatelli cheese to individual dish and top with vinegar. My family loves it!

This is the first time I've ever left a review for a recipe.  I made this tonight and just have to say that this soup is amazing!!!  It's so simple and quick to make, but the result tastes like a sweet Greek grandma slaved away in the kitchen all day.  It's nutritious, delicious and filling- but not heavy.  I have two young boys who turn their nose up at anything that isn't pizza or chicken  nuggets and they both loved this soup!  I'm so glad I found this recipe.  It's now our new meatless Monday dinner.  Thank you for sharing this!!  It's a new favorite in my family! : )

I have made this recipe a couple of times and have thought it was fantastic. Instead of using water, I use chicken stock instead. I think it gives the soup a fuller taste even if it adds a few more calories. I also use balsamic vinegar at the end instead of red wine vinegar, which turns out really well. Thanks for submitting this recipe!

This is the second time I have made this recipe. The first time I followed the instructions exactly and it turned out well. A little light on the flavour but still quite tasty. This time when I made it I did not drain the lentils and I added diced potatoes. I cooked the lentils until they were almost done then added the potatoes.
After about ten minutes I added the spices/seasonings and gave it a good stir. I only sauteed the onions, not the garlic. When it was about five minutes away from being done I added the tomato paste, carrot, garlic, adjusted the seasoning, and added a bit of chicken base. It was very good this time around. Overall I think this is a good recipe to use and can be adjusted to taste. Will save this one.
 **ALWAYS sort and rinse dry beans, lentils, etc before use. They may contain bits of soil, rocks, and other debri.**

Thank you!! My yiayia lived with us when I was young, and this is one of those dishes that makes me think of her. I have tried over the years to find a recipe like hers, and this is the closest I have found...it is wonderful! It is great even if you don't have memories of a greek grandma :) I do want to add for others trying this recipe, the red wine vinegar is NOT optional! It is what gives this soup its distinct flavor. I just add it to the whole pot after I am done cooking...just stir in a little bit at a time until you like the taste.

This was very good.  I decided it might need more flavor, so instead of all water I used 1/2 veggie broth and was liberal with the seasoning measures.  It was delicious.  Both my kids enjoyed it and said we need to make it again...that is high praise.:-)

The only change I made to the recipe was to use more carrots- I used 4, and I accidently put in 2 tbsp of tomato paste which I don't think hurt the recipe at all. My husband, 3 year old and 2 year old loved this soup. I really liked it too but I thought it was way too oily and I didn't even drizzle the olive oil on top after cooking. I'll definitely make this again but next time I'll use half of the olive oil and maybe throw in a few more carrots and it'll be perfect! Thanks for sharing!

My husband raved about this soup, something he doesn't do often, and I make giant pots of soup all the time (for the ease and quantity). I doubled the recipe and used just a couple cups of some veggie stock I had on hand; didn't put in any vinegar. It was so very tasty!

I was married to a Greek and  know how to make many varieties of this soup. This is by far the best! I have made this several times with the only change being a few more carrots. It is a perfect soup for vegetarians and meat lovers alike. I follow a plant based whole foods diet and this flavorful soup offers excellent nutrition.  Simply fantastic!

I make lentil soup all the time and really liked this version for when I don't want the meat.  Also,  Ive never thought to par cook the lentils but makes sense.  I would never omit the evoo or the vinegar at the end for its the Ying/Yang that rounds out the dish.  Parmesan, or romana would also be an option to finish with since there is no meat.  Also this recipe could be started with rendering some pork fat for richness.  The only problem I have with this recipe would be that I would fry my paste with those vegetables,  never just add raw paste to a pot of liquid.  I'm Italian and we always fry our paste to bring out the sweetness and get rid od the raw taste.

I liked the foundation of this recipe. I added 1/8tsp chili powder, 2 tsp balsamic vinegarette, 1 tsp salt, 1 qt chicken broth, and 2 tbs lemon juice. Much more flavor.

I love fakes at good Greek restaurants. This recipe is simple but the flavors are complex. Good with or without the vinegar (I prefer, husband doesn't). I had cooked a batch of lentils earlier this week and decided to try them in this recipe. That made the soup easy and quick. I did also use boxed veg broth and did not have to add any extra salt. This is very tasty. I did also add celery and a small yellow summer squash. This is now a go to recipe for us. Thank you!

I came looking for 'Greek' inspiration and found it, in the recipe and the comments. I'm a "short-cut chef" so I generally toss technique out the window and just focus on ingredients.  I started with 1 C picked-over but NOT soaked black-eyed peas, 3 C water, in slow cooker for 2 1/2 hours on High; drain, rinse, return to cooker WHICH HAS NOW BEEN TURNED OFF. Add 6 thawed 'cubes' of tomato paste (large can of tomato paste previously frozen in ice cube trays that measure 2 T each) to cooker. Add approximately 1/2 t jarred roasted garlic, 1/2 t oregano, 1/2 t rosemary to cooker (I had no bay leaves). Chop 1/2 onion, sauté in a good drizzle of olive oil in cast iron skillet 'til soft and slightly caramelized. Add several big handfuls rough-chopped fresh spinach to skillet, cook and stir around 'til softened. Add onions and spinach to cooker. Peel and dice 1 large carrot, place in small Pyrex dish with 2 T water, cover with small plate, microwave on High for 3 minutes stirring once, drain, add to cooker. Stir all. Taste. Added 1 tsp apple cider vinegar (it's all I had...).  LOVE!!! I'm not a 'bean soup' person so I didn't add additional water or broth; I just wanted me a tasty bowl o' beans, and now I have it. It doesn't taste like the lentils from our local Greek Orthodox church supper, but what do I know?  This is REALLY GOOD!  Thanks for sharing, Diana!

I gave this recipe 2 stars because it has too much garlic and not enough flavor.  Also the boiling and draining proved to be an unnecessary step.  I love garlic but this calls for about twice the amount it should.  I used sweet mayan onions and would not recommend  using the sweet onions because the sweetness of the carrots and bay leaves is enough.  I added one diced celery stalk to this recipe and an additional one and a half teaspoons of tomato paste for more flavor. It does need a more spice.  I added a tsp paprika and 1/4 tsp red chili flakes.  I also added 2 cups fresh baby spinach leaves and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil after I turned the heat off.  The vinegar helped balance the sweetness and cut the over powering garlic.  I used about a tsp of vinegar in my bowl. It was better the next day.  The garlic seemed to mellow out.

Super easy, super healthy, super delicious.  Everything a recipe should be!

To reiterate what everyone else has said - the vinegar is key!  I was a little disappointed with my first taste (pre-vinegar) so I put some red wine vinegar in and then proceeded to have two big bowls because I couldn't put the spoon down!  

This isn't just going to be revisited, this is going to be part of the regular rotation in my kitchen.

A keeper; made it as written except I used pomegranate vinegar as a condiment--delicious. Easy to make; I found this recipe by searching for an uncomplicated lentil soup recipe and this delivered.  Wife said it needed more flavor and recommended chicken or vegetable stock instead of water.

This is a great mediterranean recipe. I do not understand how some reviewers gave it 1 star. I made it multiple times and each time, I barely have leftovers. We all love it. I skip the initial phase of cooking the lentils for 10 min and it works. I use a mix of olive oil and apple cider vinegar for the end drizzle. Perfect.

Bravo Diana!  I am of Greek descent and was craving my yiayia's lentil soup.  She is long gone and I never did get her recipe.  This was delicious and hearty.  I used chicken stock instead of water and added a can of condensed Campbell's tomato soup.  I had never heard of using red wine vinegar as a garnish and found it so odd that I re-read it a couple of times.  It really makes a huge difference and will now be a staple on our table when I serve this dish.  Efharisto!

Wonderful, delicious and mouth watering good!!  Loved it ... the only thing was that I did not know how much red wine vinegar to add as it is not in the ingredients?  I added about 3 TBSP. to the whole recipe and it was great!  Thanx Ms. Moutsopoulos for sharing this simple but very nutritious and filling soup.

This is a great soup that was easy to make.  My husband accidentally poured in too much vinegar and ruined his (ha).  Definitely use the vinegar sparingly -- but is really does add to the soup.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  My kids ate it too.

This is really great soup, and quite healthy. The only change I made to the recipe was to use half water/half veggie broth. As others have already mentioned, the vinegar is essential to this soup.  Highly recommended, thanks for sharing this recipe!

SO DELICIOUS. Even my mom raved (NO small feat!) I had made fakes before, but it was never this good. I think it was the tomato paste that made it taste more authentic and took it to a new level.

A couple small tweaks: Doubled the recipe.
I added an extra 2C of water because it got ridiculously thick. 
A little squeeze of fresh lemon juice for brightness.
Anytime I sauté onion or garlic, I ALWAYS deglaze tha pan with a little white wine to get that nice toasted flavor off the pan. Also, I waited to add the carrots until it was almost time to deglaze so they wouldn't turn to mush.
I used fresh garden herbs instead of dried: lots of oregano, a little sprig of rosemary and a tiny bit of thyme.
Dash of paprika. 
Simmered on very low for 3 hours beyond recommended time.

Again, so fabulous! Thanks for this recipe!

Easy and delicious dish. I made it with some adjustments though. I cooked and added some sweet Italian sausage in and made the dish less watery (more like a stew). I also recommend to sprinkle it with wine vinegar, it brings up the flavor of the dish. My husband doesn't get excited about lentils but he approved it in this form. Will be cooking it again. Thank you for the recipe!

Just Ok. kind of bland. next time I will use chicken stock instead of water. I liked it with balsamic vinegar more than the red wine vinegar.

This is very good and healthy too.  Red wine vinegar is mandatory, the traditional greek way.  I've used chicken or beef broth for extra flavour and cumin & chili powder instead of oregano and rosemary and it's very good too.  I skip the tomato paste and use a spoon or two of tomato sauce, but it could be skipped entirely and still taste great.

A big hit with my whole family and very easy to make, too.  I thought it was delicious even without the vinegar, but liked it both ways.  I didn't simmer as long as called for since we were in a hurry to eat, and it was still terrific.  Will definitely make this again.

I had never heard of Fakes, but decided to try this recipe because I had some lentils and a bag of shredded carrots. I didn't actually follow the directions; I just threw all the ingredients in my slow cooker, minus the onions because I don't like them (30 minutes = 2 hours on high, or 4 hours on low). The thing I was confused about... didn't say how much vinegar or when to add it. I guessed & went with one tablespoon of balsamic in the pot before serving it. 

As soup, I didn’t really think much of it (though as I said, I didn’t follow the directions, so perhaps that makes a difference). I would rate it a 5 for how easy it was, a 3 for how it tasted, so I’m going with 4. Plus, I can’t fault the recipe if I didn’t follow it.

But the next day, I used it to make stuffed bell peppers. I made some white rice, stuffed yellow bell peppers with the rice & the Fakes, and baked them in the oven at 350 for 25 minutes. They were really good. They were even better for lunch the day after that, when the broth had more time to soak into the rice.

I found it to be a very simple recipe especially if you used canned lentils.  I literally had an hour to make it before traveling so the dried lentils aren't an option. 
For some extra flavour I added chicken stock.  
Love it with the red wine vinegar!  That's what sold me in the first place, being  a vinegar fiend.  I knew I must like a soup that uses vinegar as a seasoning!

This soup is very flavorful and delicious. It tastes very similar to my grandma's Greek bean soup. I added an extra onion, Italian sausage, and used some homemade tomato sauce. I also cooked it with the lid off for a while to thicken it. Served with parmesan cheese on top.

This was my first time trying lentils and I can say that I am a fan of them!!  This soup was delicious!  I used chicken broth instead of water & added some (just a little) diced celery, leeks, zucchini & squash to the carrots and onions that were already listed in the ingredients.  Thanks so much for sharing your awesome recipe!

This is an incredibly simple soup, but don't let that fool you!  It is a hearty and very filling.  I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out amazing.  I do believe the vinegar is key!  It enhanced the flavors! I am putting this on my regular rotation.

My entire family loved this recipe including my children and their grandparents.  I doubled the recipe using 1 quart of water and 1 quart of vegetable broth.  I also added chopped celery to the chopped onion, carrot, and garlic.  The soup was flavorful and everyone enjoyed it.  Thank you for a great recipe.

I only used the one tablespoon of olive oil to saute the veggies so it wasn't oily at all. The vinegar is a must.

While the flavor was OK, it needed a lot of salt and pepper and would have been entirely bland without the drizzle of vinegar at the end. Because of the high amount of olive oil, I had the unpleasant sensation of drinking a bowl of oil.

I never had Fakes before, so maybe I just didn't know what to expect.  I tasted this out of the pot before serving, and the only flavor I could taste was the rosemary.  Other than that, it was quite bland.  I thought it was better once I added the oil and vinegar.  My boyfriend didn't like it at all, so I dumped his out and got him a new bowl without the oil and vinegar.  He said it was a little better, but still didn't eat it.  I took the leftovers to a friend's house the next day, and she didn't like it either.  She said it had a weird flavor, and when I told her it was rosemary, she said, "Oh yeah, that's it."  To enjoy this soup, you've really got to like vinegar, and add a healthy portion to the soup to give it some flavor.  I also didn't get the "healthy" part.  There's close to 500 calories and 30 grams of fat in one bowl.  It'd be worth it if it tasted better.

This is a good base recipe so I am giving it 5 stars because of that.  But, I did use chicken stock instead of the water and had to add more spices.  I added more salt and some Greek seasoning I happened to have on hand.  I also added some diced potatoes and orange bell pepper which I needed to use up. Adding the vinegar was something I would not have thought of so this was nice as well. I also added a dash of hot sauce to my serving and this made it perfect.

Really simple and delicious recipe. I cooked the veggies a little longer and added 3tbsp of tomato paste. The acidity from the red wine vinegar helps the flavor go from good to great but add carefully to taste.

I accidentally added more tomato paste than I should have but my husband loved it anyway.  Ate it all with chunks of bread.  I will definitely make it again but with the recommended amount of tomato paste.

Its a good, healthy, quick recipe. I added fresh chives and yellow pepper as well as more onion. An addition of potatoes would make it even better. :)

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added a pinch of cayenne, a tsp of cumin, and used balsamic vinegar instead of red wine vinegar at the end. Yet, it feels like something's missing. I think next time I'll use veggie broth to kick up the flavor. This soup has the potential to be very good if I could just find that extra something that's missing.

This was an excellent soup! I didn't have any brown lentils in stock (thought I did - then discovered I didn't). Substituted with green lentils instead. Near the end of the cooking time - I poured in juice and abit of grated lemon to add abit of taste. Also, instead of wine vinegar - used some aged balsamic vinegar - which made this soup even more outstanding in taste! I will make this again for sure.

This is absolutely my new favorite soup!! I actually doubled the recipe. It was so easy to prepare.  I think the combination drizzle of olive oil and red wine vinegar on top really nailed it for me. I haven't had that particular combination before. It was awesome!! Thanks to whoever submitted the recipe. I'll keep it forever!!

I've made this a couple of time straight from the recipe and while it was okay, it just wasn't wonderful. This time instead of a quart of water, I used 2 cups water, 1 cup of chicken broth and a cup of red wine.  Instead of 1 tbsp tomato paste, I used a quarter cup of ketchup and  I  added a dash of hot sauce.  

So now it's not Fakes, but it does have a more robust flavor. 

Do add the recommended olive oil and vinegar on top when served. That helps a lot.

I used chicken broth in the step with the vegetables, to replace the water,, as well as three carrots and garlic powder in addition to minced garlic.  
Omitted the tomato paste and replaced with can diced tomatoes, added extra oregano.  When finished cooking I added two tablespoons of red wine vinegar and sliced kalamata olives, then feta and sour cream in each serving.

Lentil soup is my favorite “comfort food,” and this recipe is the one I always return to.  I follow exactly as instructed and agree that the vinegar is an integral ingredient. Good quality olive oil makes a difference, too. Add some warm pita or a crusty baguette to dip for a perfect meal.

Oh my goodness! I’m on day FIVE of eating this for lunch & it is delicious!! It’s rare that I don’t change a recipe, but literally changed nothing with this! All I had was Balsalmic vinegar, which has been delicious. I did take half of the finished product & blend it in my vitamix—it turned into a creamy texture my kid’s would actually eat. And low & behold after much nose-sniffing & tongue-sticking, 2/3 kids admitted it was yummy as well! Served initially with sourdough bread, I’ve eaten it plain for every meal following. Definitely making again!

An excellent, versatile recipe. 

I'm really responding in support of the author's comments in response to some critics. I want to be very clear that while I followed the outlines of this recipe, I used what I had on hand.

I was out of bay leaves, but I added mint. 

I added 4 potatoes, cut in small chunks. 

I added chicken stock.

I tasted it to adjust seasoning, and then added a healthy glug of white wine vinegar. 

It was excellent. Even my lentil-hating kid liked it.

I didn't have any bay leaves so I had to leave them out. Before adding the red wine vinegar it was at best a 3 star recipe flavor wise. Adding the vinegar definitely kicked the flavor up a notch. IF you try it without the vinegar and don't like it then I'd encourage you to try it again with the vinegar.

I loved this recipe. Part of the appeal of lentils is how hearty and earthy they are. They are simple and satisfying. This recipe allows them to shine by complementing the lentil's natural flavor without overpowering it. I used dried basil instead of rosemary, as I personally don't prefer rosemary, but otherwise followed this to a T. It's my new go-to when I want something hot and delicious that doesn't take a lot of effort.

We used way more tomato paste than recommended (the whole can) and added more oregano, plus sage and onion powder. Also instead of just water we did half water, half chicken broth. We loved it and our picky friend (who "hates lentil soup") liked it enough to ask to take some leftovers home! I'm sure we made it less authentic with our changes... but  it was a good soup!

I love this so much!!! I'm on the Mediterranean diet and this is my go-to food. I have two bowls in the freezer right now. I do add some better-than-boullion to jazz it up and some salt. I usually don't add the vinegar. . I don't know why, I just prefer it without. Yum Yum Yummo. I could eat it every day.

I found it relatively flavourless, actually, even after adding the red wine vinegar. I think if you used beef broth instead of water it would take it up a level! Will be doing that next time. 

Added double the carrots and a zucchini, too, which added a nice amount of texture! :)

I followed the recipe as is, but I think I may have been heavy handed with the rosemary.  It was a very easy and tasty recipe.  Next time, I'll go easy on the rosemary.

Great base recipe. Added a few things like celery and some red wine, red pepper flake to get the right flavor.

Tastes amazing but I think I overcooked the lentils - they broke down. I added hot sauce bc spicy is my weakness but I would double the seasonings if I make this again.

Daughter has recently gone vegetarian so looking for easy recipes like this where I can take part of it and add meat for those that choose that.  This recipe was a good, simple meal.  I made a double recipe and added sausage to half and left half vegetarian.

I make this often! I’ve gotten so many compliments on it. It’s a good basic lentil soup recipe. I’ve always used whatever vinegar I have on hand and when it’s all done we use garlic salt to taste! This with a fresh loaf of bread (made in the bread maker) is a great healthy meal!

I chose this recipe because it was the closest to my grandmothers. I have a food sensitivity to garlic, so I left it out, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

We enjoyed this one. Mine turned out a little more reddish because I put extra tomato paste. We had steamed broccoli with it and we all ended up putting it in our lentils and liked it.

The leftovers of this soup were much tastier than the night I cooked it. I think next time I'll serve it the day after I cook it to let the flavors blend.

First of all the red wine vinegar is a MUST! I followed the recipe exactly and I was convinced that I didn’t like the soup until I tried the vinegar. It does makes the soup so flavorful. And for anyone interested: I worked it out and the soup comes to about 150 cal per serving (I’m considering one cup a serving). It’s so healthy and filling you can’t go wrong!

This was incredible. I used chicken stock instead of water, and added celery too, threw it all into the slow cooker on low for 6.5 hours, added Jimmy Dean cooked turkey sausage crumbles and another cup and a half of chicken stock for another hour on low. 7.5 hours total. It was insanely good. Left out the olive oil but do drizzle with balsamic vinegar to taste. Gave my neighbor a bowl and he can’t stop raving about it. Making another batch this week. My favorite soup ever by far. Thank you Diana for your family recipe, adding it to my own family recipes now. Hope you don’t mind.

I fell in love with Fakes when I was staying with a host family in Greece for 2 months. When I came back home to Canada I tried to find a recipe everywhere and this one comes the closest to the one my host mom used to make. It's so delicious, hearty and easy to make!

Turned out great!  I love how simple and quick it is.  I had all the ingredients on hand.

I only made a few modifications: substituted homemade stock for 1/2 the liquid; added 2 stalks chopped celery; didn't have red wine vinegar so used apple cider vinegar.

I made this 3x always excellent. The first time I didn’t have red wine vinegar so I used balsamic. The 2nd time I used the red wine vinegar. I actually prefer the soup with balsamic better. Only thing I added was a little cauliflower. Great recipe I’ve shared it with many extended family they love it too.

I love this soup...Super-easy to make with ingredients I almost aways have on hand. The change I suggest is to use broth instead of plain water. The vinegar is such a great surprise, and I liked it with even a little more than suggested!

This meets my four criteria for cooking: easy, nutritious, delicious and cheap. I cut a corner and used Trader Joe’s steamed lentils. I used less water as the lentils were precooked and cooked for less time but everything else was according to the recipe. Really nice on a cold day like today. Thank you!

I made this last night for a simple dinner. My  daughter and I loved it! It was very filling. I'm making another batch this afternoon for lunch this upcoming week!

A simple, delicious and healthy dinner! Carrots are slow to cook, so I cooked the sliced carrots in the microwave before adding them to the skillet. They came out soft, like I like them.

This is easy and delicious and I am not a true fan of typical lentil soup. The tasty touch of the red wine vinegar really makes it pop.

Simply delicious! Recipe is perfect as is. Don’t skip the vinegar - as far as I am concerned it’s not optional. Added a handful of chopped kale during the last 5 minutes of simmering just because and it worked out great.

Probably one of my favourite recipes on here. Quick, easy, and it tastes great. I generally just crush a tomato in place of the tomato paste.

Very good, Diana. Thank you. I chose this recipe because I had some lentils that were getting old. My expectations were low. I just thought I was making a soup that would be heart healthy, and not especially tasty. I was wrong. My son and his buddy Aaron both liked this a lot, as did I. I did learn that the older lentils are, the longer they take to soften, but with patience, everything came out great.  On a lark I added a romano/parmesan grated cheese blend as a garnish in the individual bowls, and it was the bomb.

This was a delight! I had to use white wine vinegar (no red wine vinegar on hand) and added a minced celery stalk (just because I’m trying to use up some extra), but I don’t think either changes the recipe dramatically. WOW! So yummy, filling, and flavorful. The vinegar really brightens up and puts some oomph in the soup. I can’t imagine it without it. Especially since it’s technically vegan, so the vinegar really opened it up instead of relying on ham or something else. Thanks for sharing this delicious recipe! And I also agree with the OP: the olive oil is a must and makes it true to the Mediterranean diet. Olive oil is incredibly healthy, is a great animal fat substitute, and helps make this recipe filling.

I love this simple yet flavorful soup!  It’s perfect for my vegetarian friends too.  I do add some red potatoes the last 10 mins of cooking because that’s how the Greek restaurant locally does it & it tastes the same as theirs.  It is also delicious with adding some browned Italian sausage if you want some meat in it.  Thank you for sharing it!  It will be passed down to my family too!

Surprisingly delicious!!! Took the advice of adding extra carrots (3 but next time I'll definitely do 5) and used fresh rosemary instead of dried. Vinegar creates the magic here so its a must have!! Easy, healthy, tasty... 10/10 stars. I feel like this would be a great soup to use whatever leftover veggies you have too. Very versatile!

This soup is amazing!!  The olive oil and red wine vinegar pairs so well with the soup and its already delicious flavors.  It is by far one of my favorite soups to make!!!

When I want a nice soup to make, I reach for my bag of lentils!

Thank you for sharing this most wonderful soup recipe.

Really loved this soup! It was my first time making and eating Fakes and I would definitely do it again!
I did change some of the seasoning (partially on accident). I got mixed up and added about a tablespoon of rosemary and oregano, rather than a pinch. It turned out to be a happy accident, though, because the soup was kind of bland even with the extra herbs.
Also added about a teaspoon of  curry powder, ground ginger, and about a tablespoon of salt. After the additional seasoning, the soup tasted great! I'll have to try it with the red wine vinegar next time!

I have been eating a lot of lentil soup lately.  However, I only had one recipe and was getting burned out, so came across this one and thought I'd give it a shot.  I followed it exactly, however, I did have some leftover brown rice in the frig that needed using, so I tossed it in. (I love rice with lentils & it makes soups thicker & heartier.)  I put all the ingredients into my Pressure Cooker (a knock off of the Instant Pot), set the timer for 30 minutes, and wala, it was done.  The taste test, in my opinion, seemed rather bland, so I tossed in another teaspoon of salt and more red wine vinegar.  After several hefty shakes of the red wine vinegar, it tasted wonderful!  I have added this to my recipe box & will be making this again, double batch next time!  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

It's a bland soup.  I used extra garlic and a large onion. I used the red wine vinegar.  It's not bad tasting at all but it's not flavourful.  Thanks.

I made this today because hubby has a cold and wanted some soup.  I did add some celery because I had to get rid of it and it was mostly leaves and inner stalks.  We both enjoyed the result and added the vinegar and some yogurt topper along with chopped parsley and green onions.  Delicious!!

it was quick and easy to make. it had lots of flavor to it also. I am thinking of adding maybe some smoked ham to it the next time that I make it. I want to see how it affects the flavor.

I loved this soup and so does my boyfriend. I have made several times now. I substitute red lentils in the recipe and make them beforehand and it cuts down on cooking time. I also use 2-3 cups of cooked lentils. Yum!

Even though I tweeked the recipe a bit, I give it a 5 star as it is all the basics in the ingredients included and how to prepare.  I followed the seasonings suggested but added a bit more.  What is critical to the taste is the splash of vinegar at the end.  This time (and I have made this recipe many times) I used balsamic vineger because that was what I had on hand.

Me and my Greek BF loved this. Extremely versatile dish...used the green and red lentils I had on hand with some veggie broth. We love spice, so I added cayenne and it wasn’t enough, so we added tabasco. We will likely try a jalapeño next time. I know this sounds weird and completely negates the health benefits, but when my daughter walked by with some spicy nacho Doritos, I felt possessed to add a few to my bowl. Yum! Like crackers in chili but w/o the crackers or chili :-)

Very good! I made it with red lentils, since that is what I had. I used 2 carrots. I didn't have tomato paste so I used 3T. of tomato sauce. Yummy!

Not a bad base recipe, but definitely too bland for my tastes. I used part water and part broth, a heavy hand with the oregano and rosemary, a heaping tablespoon of tomato paste, and drizzled with garlic-infused olive oil at the end with the red wine vinegar (which definitely is the flavor highlight). Next time, I'll just use this as inspiration and add more spices, more tomato paste, plus some spinach for more color

This is possibly the best soup I've ever eaten in my entire life.  I'm a big fan of soup and also lentils and I made this exactly according to the recipe except I added 1 stalk of celery to the starting mirepoix just because I have extra from a bunch I'm trying to use up, used a pretty sparing amount of salt (for me anyway) and it's absolutely divine.  I actually can't believe how good something so simple is.  It's also super easy to make.  The hardest part of the whole recipe was the fact that I didn't have ground oregano or rosemary so I had to take the dried whole leave versions that I had in my pantry and grind them up.  Thanks so much for this recipe!  This is going in my regular rotation for sure.

I accidentally used too much water but it still turned out delicious. As most reviews stated, definitely add the vinegar at the end and serve with a couple of spoonful's of feta. Definitely making this one again!

My Greek mother-in-law made this often, and we enjoyed it every time. Trouble is, she doesn't have a recipe (she has never owned measuring cups/spoons, just eyeballs all ingredients from memory). Was looking for a recipe with exact measurenents so I can make it for my family, now that we live across country.  This is basically an exact dupe to hers and I am very thankful to you for posting it. Only difference is I used vegetable broth instead of water. I also used a food processor to finely chop and mince up the onion, garlic, and carrot all together -- that really made the soup very hearty, but not too thick, either. Oh and I would say vinegar is a must! Delicious! Now our little one can enjoy Yia-Yia's cooking from afar. :)

I’m Of Greek background and this is an authentic recipe! I make these without the canned lentils same process just a little more cooking time. So hearty  and you can’t go wrong with extra celery & carrots. Such a healthy hearty soup! Or and it’s VEGAN to boot!

Thought it tasted great, then added the red wine vinegar. Whoa!  So much better!  I used chicken broth instead of water and a whole 6oz can of tomato paste.

I didn't have bay leaves, so I used sage instead, which I thought would be a good complementary seasoning, and I left out the vinegar and substituted celery for the onion.  I listened to some of the reviewers and used broth instead of water- it was half veggie, half chicken broth, just based on what I had in my fridge.  I did approximately double the recipe, using a whole bag of lentils, a whole (small) can of tomato paste, and extra veggies.  I liked the soup, and thought that it was herby and flavorful, nice and thick, but not gummy.  My husband really enjoyed it, as well, so it disappeared pretty quickly.  If I make it again, I might add some chopped chicken or another vegetable, like corn or broccoli.  Seems like a good base.

Didn't take very long to make, I doubled the recipe as it sounded very good, that without a doubt was, enjoying it with my wife and friend who BTW is Greek and we all agreed. The next day we ate it again, which after most soups, turned from very good to excellent. Thank you.

This was so delicious and very easy to make. I used chicken broth in place of the water. The red wine vinegar gives it another level of flavor, and  I'm glad that I used it.  The olive oil was a nice touch, too, which makes this soup healthy and Mediterranean-diet type. Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious soup.  Makes a big batch and I had a bowl for lunch every day this past week.  Easy to make.  A little  more tomato tasting for me.  Next time I will add more broth and less tomatoes.  But very great taste.

Sooo good, sooo easy, sooo healthy, and few ingredients! This turned out amazing! I noticed some reviews mentioned it's lacking flavor so for every "pinch" I instead added a generous sprinkle (like 3 pinches). Going to keep this recipe to make again and again!

Great recipe and very much in line with a traditional Fake.
Additions for me include one freshly grated tomato that I throw in while veggies are cooking. I also add celery and potatoes and omit the rosemary.  Definitely add some red vinegar to your bowl of Fakes as it truly adds a tasty dimension to the soup.

I made this soup because my Hubby was sick. Super tasty. I used vegetable broth instead of water. I chatted with a lady at work who is Greek and she said her Mother's recipe is different and uses a different vinegar. It's a very simple but amazing soup.

This was a delicious soup, healthy and quick to make given the 10 minute pre cook of the lentils.  I used green lentils and low sodium chicken broth in place of water.  The red wine vinegar added to the zing, applied individually to taste.  I also tried it with fresh lime instead and it was also fantastic.

I really liked this paired with brown rice. Very hardy and filling, and perfect for a vegetarian meal.  The only change I made was to substitute chopped red pepper for the carrot because I ran out of carrots.  At first I thought this would be too bland for my pallet but I was wrong.   Thanks for sharing, Diana.

Delicious! (And plenty of food -- with my bowls, I got 6+ servings of soup!)

 I followed the recipe pretty much exactly -- I misread the directions and added the tomato paste with the lentils (oops!) but it still turned out quite well. I'm looking forward to trying it again, correctly this time! It was very forgiving. 

One tip: make sure you crunch up your rosemary a bit. Mine was kinda old, so I added a bit extra (

This was a very good way to prepare lentils. I didn't add the olive oil at the end, but I did add a bit more vinegar (okay, like a Tbsp more because I only had apple cider vinegar and it isn't as bold as red wine vinegar). I paired it with a rustic garlic bread and have zero regrets.

Loved this recipe, I couldn't find red lentils so used the regular ones.  We ended up not being able to eat it the day I made it so we ate it reheated the next day. I needed to add a good amount of water to "soup it up". I thought of using broth but decided against it).  It was delish!  Use quality olive oil as it really would make a difference!  Be light on the vinegar as I learned I like with quite a bit more than my hubby.  Will definitely make again!!!

My family liked this recipe very much. I did add about double the garlic called for, and added about 1/2 tsp. of cumin near the end. The dash of red wine vinegar adds a nice note of brightness, so I'd recommend trying it.

I made this for a friend who doesn't eat meat. This soup is delicious, especially for being meatless!   I definitely recommend adding the apple cider vinegar at the end, it adds a great little splash of flavor to this yummy, hearty soup! I'll be making it again for my husband and I.

This was very tasty. I did not put in the tomato paste and I tried it both with and without the vinegar. I liked it with out the vinegar best.

I doubled  the amount to make a big pot. I added two celery ribs along with the carrots. I made it sour with lemon juice and I added sour cream in the bowl.  One question I have is - there is  any way I can eliminate the skin of the lentils? One other think - I found only green lentils.

This is a really delicious soup! I'm new to cooking and this recipe was easy to follow. The soup is simple but flavorful and the red wine vinegar makes it really great. The only change I made  to the recipe was to add more of the recommended spices and garlic--I added about three pinches of rosemary and oregano and like 1.5 tbsp of garlic. I'll definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Just made this and it was delicious!  The only thing I did was not add the extra olive oil for serving.  I did add the vinegar and it is a must; it brought the test to a whole new level.  This is a keeper.

I found this to be a somewhat bland soup, but not so much that I didn't like it.  To people used to typical American foods, I suggest reading some of the positive reviews and see how others are augmenting the flavor.

Goes very well with a slice of toasted  garlic bread :-)

A simple soup to make with ingredients I had on hand. The flavor developed as the soup aged a day or so. I would make it again.

I just made this today. It is delicious and hardy! I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't put the red wine vinegar in. I am doing the Standard Process 21-Day Purification and this was a recipe that fit in the guidelines perfectly.  I saved a little time chopping by adding the onion and carrot to the vitamix.

I, and my husband, are very pleased! Thanks for the share.

Best Lentil Soup

I just made it for the second time. My husband is Greek and he loved it just as much as I do. I tried many recipes out of many Greek Cookbooks and this one was easier to make and the best by far. I doubled the recipe this time. It freezes well, and I definitely needed to make more. I recommend you try it, I think you will be happy you did.

This is my favorite vegetarian dish. It is simple to make and very filling. I also like that it is very economical to make and I typically have all the ingredients on hand. I do use fresh spices instead of dried since I grow my own. I just double the amount of spices in the recipe when I use fresh. I also feel the vinegar is a must. It adds a very nice flavor to the dish. I use a splash of balsamic.

Added a few things, like a few chopped apples, some cauliflower, potatoes, and left out the spinach.  It's what I had on hand.  I used half the salt recommended, but did add two vegetarian bouillon cubes for other flavor.  Oh, I didn't use the pepper - couldn't find it!  Awesome!! YUMMY!!

This is a great 'base' for a lentil soup.  I start with this recipe and jazz it up a bit depending on what I have on hand.  Some changes I have made - I have used a variety of colored lentils, add more veggies (carrot, broccoli, green beans, whatever I have on hand), I like to add cumin, and I always add vinegar and olive oil to the top of each fresh bowl when served.  As far as the veggies are concerned: I use an emulsification mixer to puree the veggies down to a smooth or mostly smooth soup. By pureeing the veggies in this way, I can sneak in several for flavor and nutrition.

Excellent recipe for Lentil Soup. I made it exactly as stated and only increased the seasonings because I like foods seasoned heavily. Call me European. Anyway, the vinegar at the end and a drizzle of EVOO is the key to an awesome finish. Enjoy.

Made this for the first time today. Used green spouted lentils since they were in the cupboard, so only simmered 10 minutes at the end. Added 2 Tbsp of red wine vinegar at the end and it was perfection. Only wish I had tried this earlier.

Yum yum yum! I followed the recipe exactly (maybe adding a bit more than a pinch of oregano). It's simple and easy to make but surprisingly tasty and filling. I feel like the vinegar shouldn't be labeled as "optional" though; it's a must. Without it, you're really just left with lentil water.

Delicious! I drizzled fresh lemon juice and olive oil on top instead of the vinegar. I think I may add a dash of liquid smoke to it next time, but it's fantastic just the way it is, too.

Flavorless until we added the red wine vinegar, and then it just tasted like vinegar. Will not make again and have to find something to do with the leftovers.

I love this recipe. It is in my regular rotation of meals. Wonderful served with a piece of toasted garlic bread. I was hesitant on adding red wine vinegar at first, now I add about 1/4 C of it to my soup. Thank you for sharing this recipe. It's amazing.

At first it didn't look good but after simmering it for a while until the lentils were easily crushed and the soup turned brown, it was really good. I'll be making this again.

I've made this recipe every winter for at least three years. WE LOVE IT!!! it's perfect for cold winter days. I do add Italian turkey sausage just because my family like the lentil soup we get from Carabbas. Other than that I follow the recipe exactly except for the vinegar. I'm actually cooking some right now lol

Relies heavily on vinegar for flavor. For a more complex flavor profile I added celery, 3 tbsp of tomato paste, spinach, and 1/2 tsp rosemary. I also ended up adding a healthy splash of vinegar instead of the tablespoon in the recipe.

This is a great recipe! My mom made faki, as she calls it, all the time when I was growing up. I wanted to find a recipe that had a little more depth than hers, and this is it! I love the rosemary- such a great addition to the soup! I would highly recommend using chicken broth instead of water when you're adding the quart to the beans and everything else- I've made it with water, and it's just not as good.

I've tried it with and without the red wine vinegar , and I prefer it without. 

Overall, really yummy soup!

I have made this several times and it has always turned out really good. It tastes better with the vinegar and olive oil. I have used balsamic vinegar and raw apple cider vinegar.

Excellent, a new favorite!! I used white onion, fresh rosemary, chicken broth, two carrots, and I didn't have any bay leaves so they were left out.  Turned out amazing!  I boiled the lentils in the first step for a few minutes longer, sauteed the onion, carrot and garlic for a few minutes longer, then sauteed the spices and drained lentils with the vegetables for a minute or two before adding the broth.  Topped with the olive oil and red wine vinegar before serving as suggested, perfect flavoring.

This recipe is fabulous!!! I've been making it for a couple years, and my family loves it!  My daughter loves it so much that she requested I make it for her 12th birthday party this weekend! We add a TON of red wine vinegar to each bowl. It wouldn't have much flavor without it,  so if you don't like vinegar, you might want to add different spices/flavors. We love the simplicity and flavor as is.  Thank you!

I love the subtle flavors in this soup, as well as the intense flavor of the vinegar.  I first learned to make this without the tomato puree, but have tried it with puree as well.  But always, I sprinkle some fresh diced tomato, thinly sliced scallions on top of each serving, topped with a drizzle of olive oil  and a teaspoon (or more) of wine vinegar.   It is just a wonderful soup!

Tasty!  I would definitely make this again.  I followed the recipe exactly - it was a little bland for my taste.  I added a bit more red wine vinegar, a dash of garlic salt, and a bit a feta cheese to my bowl -- PERFECT!

I made this in massive quantity for my daughters wedding (Greek Buffet). I used 1 large bay leaf instead of two, I made the recipe for "Greek Seasoning" on All Recipes and used 1 heaping teaspoon of that, plus 1/2 teas oregano, 1 vege bullion cube. No rosemary.I cut the oil by half when cooking but plan to drizzle some on when served. I used 6 cups of water instead of 8, since I wasn't making soup. This turned out wonderful as a vegan option! Thank You for this wonderful recipe! This cooks up well in the crock pot!

Very little flavour, rather bland even with the added red wine vinegar.  Had to add much more spices than what the recipe calls for. I guess my family prefer more stronger tasting soups.

As many people have already mentioned, the red wine vinegar in this dish is crucial.  For a bit more spice, I also added a 1.5 tbsp of Tapatio.

I made this with the following adjustments: no tomato paste (I'm not a fan of tomato flavor) and I used crushed bay leaves instead of whole leaves.  It was a good hearty soup and the whole family ate it up, but it seemed to be missing a little flavor.  I love lentil soup so I will definitely try this again and maybe throw in the tomato paste...

This is wonderful. The only thing I did differently was to add a can of diced tomatoes. DEFINITELY add the olive oil and red wine vinegar at the end - it kicks it up to a whole new level. Thanks for sharing.

This was a tasty, simple and filling meal.  I do find that lentils require ALOT more seasoning; like soup beans they tend to suck up the salt, etc.  However, this is a great base that can easily be spiced up a bit with additions of whatever suits your fancy at the time.  Serve with some warm naan bread and a dollop of sour cream.

My husband and I hated it...it was bland so I added a tab more of the seasonings it called for but it didn't help much. It was pretty boring and I honestly don't know what to change to make it taste better. I won't be making this again!

I didn't have tomato paste so I used ketchup instead. I used more than the recipe suggested.  I also added in 1/2 cup of barley during the last 30mins.  It turned out tasty, though I'm not used to the taste of vinegar in soup. I would probably make some adjustment next time.

Hi I tried your recipe and its very good, my mom is greek, and she and my yiayia made it without carrots (don't know why)...i am not used to it being sweeter with carrots.  Also instead of vinegar, mom used white, dry vermouth...

I make this recipe and it is great. The one thing I change is you have to add in a ton of tomato paste to get the consistency right. I am talking a 12 ounce can. Some add ketchup instead. Also, I put in more rosemary, and double the lentils.

Even my picky kids eat this soup.  We LOVE it! I didn't know to boil the lentils and rinse them before making them into soup before making this recipe, so THANKS for the tip that has improved some of my other favorite recipes.  

We add broth instead of water.  (I like Better Than Bouillon's veggie base, but chicken does well, too.)  When serving, I salt and pepper the top and load it up with red wine vinegar.  In a bind I've used any tomato product to sub for the tomato paste, including tomato soup and tomato sauce.

P.S. Don't be shy about the olive oil.  Olive oil is one of the healthiest thing around.  In some health food stores and restaurants, you can order a shot of it to chug down.  It lubricates your insides and promotes healthy digestion, not to mention a multitude of other benefits.  Good fat is good for your body and a necessary element for good health.

I really enjoyed this soup. I did make some adjustments to boost the flavor. I used vegetable stock instead of water and added probably more like 3T of tomato paste but other than that was pretty true to the recipe. The splash at the vinegar at the end is an absolute must do. It really makes it delicious.

My husband was skeptical about lentil soup but loved this.  I did add red pepper flakes and lemon juice. We used red wine vinegar and that really does make this soup.

Being Greek, this soup was always a staple on our dinner table. I LOVE it. My dad always added a tablespoon (or more to taste) to his hot bowl of soup at the table and ate it with raw onion. I eat it like that to this day. It is hearty and delicious and goes wonderful with a rustic bread on a wintery cold day. LOVE! -Tina Vasilatos-Gdovic

This was so incredibly bland when taste testing.  I cook brown and red lentils every week and this is the most disappointing lentil recipe I have ever made.  I had to add extra EVERYTHING plus some chicken broth and bouillon cubes.  Bland, bland, bland. Major disappointment.

This was a great soup.  I used a whole can of tomato paste but the rest was as written.  I didn't need to simmer for 30-40 minutes....the lentils were soft when I added the paste in. I did need to add salt & pepper at that point.  When serving I spilled the red wine vinegar so it was much more than a tsp but it really made the meal.

Very good, very simple. It definitely needs the vinegar. I think I personally prefer more "exotic" flavors in my soups or something, because I didn't *love* this recipe. BUT it was really good and I definitely appreciate the solid comfort of simple and traditional flavors. Thanks for sharing! I'm glad I tried this. :)

Wow! So delicious! I used regular white vinegar and it was amazing. I could eat this every week-the only thing I might change next time is to add even more carrots because they were so good.

Made it last night, was a big hit thanks Diana. Stuck to your recipe and it turned out great. Next time I wanna try adding some lemon before serving. Also curious about trying it with vinegar, sounds delicious.

Absolutely wonderful recipe!  One thing I found different was precooking the lentils slightly -- at first I thought this was a rather redundant step, but was really happy with the results.  It seemed to really preserve the texture of the lentils in the soup.  I ended up pureeing about 1/2 of the soup for a richer consistency and added white wine vinegar at the end.  Whole family loved -- even the picky ones! Thanks for submitting.

I've made this exactly as written for years and my family loves it.  Don't skip the vinegar.

I was really worried when I tried it before the last simmer (30-45 min)...tasted like water!  So I added the tomato paste, s/p, and a bit of veg bouillon, hoping for the best.   Thankfully, the flavours melded during the simmer because it tasted much different afterwards.  Tried both Pomegranate Vinegar and regular red wine balsamic...both of us agreed the lighter pomegranate was nicer. 

After making it a second time, I've decided it's not worth making again.

I've made this twice! It was great both times. The second time I added balsamic vinegar, a dash of cayenne pepper, and some all spice while it was simmering. We added a dash of hot sauce to our individual bowls too. This gave it quite a kick.   Thanks!

Loved this recipe.  Only difference I did was omit the vinegar, add about 2 cups of thinly sliced brats and quite a bit of salt.  It was very bland.  Nonetheless, incredibly high in fiber and vitamins.

This was really good and my whole family ate it and liked it.  This made me very happy since legumes are so healthy and I happen to love them.  They were even better the next day as beans always are.  I think the only thing I changed was that I added a little leftover chicken and broth that I had slow-cooked to remove the last of the meat from a roast chicken. Thank you Diane!  I had never had fakes before.  Great recipe.

My lentils came out too mushy, and there was no liquid at all... The red wine vinegar is a nice touch, but otherwise I found it to be way too underspiced.

Very nice simple soup, made much more complex with the olive oil and red wine vinegar on top.  Husband hated it.

Great in terms of a base recipe, but did make minor tweaks.. Used vegetable stock in place of some of the water, as suggested by others.  Added extra carrots and also some celery.  As for spices, I added much more oregano and a little cayenne for a little kick.  I think I'm the only one that doesn't like the vinegar in my lentil soup.  I preferred it with a little grated parm or romano, but I'm sure feta would be delicious as well!!

I never knew my husband liked lentils until I decided to try this soup. He complained about the vinegar, but that didn't stop him from inhaling the bowl in 30 seconds flat!

This recipe is alright.  The vinegar definitely adds a hit of flavour for serving, but I was hoping for something richer.  I'm thinking that using stock (as others have) would make it tastier.

**Updated: Aha!  The key is to add enough salt and pepper!  A can of tomatoes is a good addition too!

This was such an easy and delicious recipe.  I made three minor changes for convenience:  I added some red beans that I had in the fridge, I subbed half a zucchini for the carrot that I didn't have on hand, and I used half chicken broth in place of half of the water.  It was superb, flavorful and the vinegar and oil was the perfect touch.

This was a great recipe. I replaced one cup of water with vegetable broth and added 1/2 cup chopped, frozen spinach. I was skeptical about the vinegar, but it was surprisingly good. I'll certainly make this again.

Delicious!  you could probably jazz it up with some vibrant herbs, but this is yummy as-is.  Great choice for those on a budget.
