This was so delicious!! I loved what the egg whites and sugar did for the cake! I made my own whipped cream and cut back on some of the sugar (only used 1/4 cup with the strawberries and 1/8 for the top of the dough) and it was delicious! I also substituted cinnamon for nutmeg, since I didn't have any. Will definitely make again!

This was the most delicious Strawberry Shortcake I have ever made. My 54 year old son requested strawberry for Valentine's dinner. I supprised him with this recipe. Being a home cook chef, he gave it high ratings. The cake was crispy yet tender. It lent itself to the juices of the strawberries. I made chocolate covered strawberries dipped in finely chopped pecans and decorated the top of the cake with them. Of course I had whipped on the top for a bed for them.  The center was uncovered to show the strawberries. I will use this cake recipies for all my fruit shortcakes.

Really good flavour! I made my own whipped cream and it went perfectly with the strawberries. For those saying the cake itself was too dry; this recipe is for a traditional shortcake, which is meant to be overall dry. If you want one resembling more like a regular cake, this isn’t the recipe for you. However, the flavour of this cake was fantastic. Will make again.

I made this tonight and was disappointed in the taste and the dryness of the cake.  If I ever try it again I will try it with self rising flour, the baking powder made it taste bitter.  It looked beautiful though.

For a beginner baker like me I found this recipe easy to follow and was super pleased with how it turned out! The whipped egg whites really made the top of the cakes golden and I'm happy that they have a scone-type quality.

I may have whipped my egg whites *too* stiffly, because there didn’t seem to be enough to cover both pans, and when I spread it, it picked up bits of the lower layer, leaving it bare. I fixed the problem by whipping two more egg whites, but not using all of those two, and I sprinkled an extra tablespoon(ish) more sugar between the two pans to make up for the extra egg. I also subbed vanilla almond milk for the milk and used Cool Whip for the whipped topping. This shortcake was YUMMY fresh—and warm, especially. After it was completely cooled, I stored it in a sealed container on the counter, but this morning the tops were a little soggy, which was disappointing. I wonder if it should be stored in the refrigerator? I am going to try making this with gluten-free 1:1 baking blend flour for my gluten-intolerant daughter during blueberry season (she’s allergic to strawberries, poor kid.) I think it would be awesome with blueberries.

I thought it was pretty good. I cut down baking powder to 3 tablespoons. You definitely need all the sugar. Everyone said it was fantastic.

I made some modifications as I went.  I cut the sugar as many other reviews suggested.  I added cinnamon along with the nutmeg.  I also added vanilla extract to the cake (what cake doesn't have that?!).  I then baked some strawberries IN the cake under the egg white fluff.  The cake itself came out a touch dry, but with cool whip it is great.

This is a perfect dessert! I too cut the sugar in half for the strawberries and the egg white topping. This recipe is delicious and refreshing! I am making it a second time to bring to a dinner invite! It’s not too sweet, love it!

The only change I made was substituting cinnamon for the nutmeg.  My family loved this.

Love this recipe!  I used 1/4 cup sugar in the batter.  Sense the berries are already sweet I used a half cup of OJ poured over the berries and left on the counter until they make even more juice.  I made it in nine inch rounds and cutting it was messy but delicious!  This time I cut the batter with a biscuit cutter and baked on cookie sheet.  Easier to serve!  I may add orange peel zest next time to the batter.  Will give it some more flavour!  Thanks so much for a great recipe.

I made it for a birthday and at the last min. i had to make another cake because it was to crumbly and fell apart. also the look was not the pleasing. However it did tastes like a strawberry scone.  I was not happy with this cake overall.

This was great. Everyone at our family gathering gave it a thumbs up. I did make a couple of changes after reading previous reviews about the dryness of the cake.  I pierced the cake with a fork several tomes then layered the strawberries with the juice on the cake before the whipped cream. I also made it the night before to allow time for the cake to absorb the strawberry juice.  Amazing!

My shortcake was somewhat hard. I was expecting a fluffier cake. The mix is really thick, a little like bread dough. There is not a whole lot of dough to put in the pans; you just have to pat it until it's somewhat smooth. These were just okay to me. I had made strawberry short cake a few years ago, and they were so delicious! I guess I've set my bar high.
