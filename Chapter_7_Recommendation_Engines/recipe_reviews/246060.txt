Loved this simple recipe that brightened up my dish. I forgot to add water and it separated a little, but maybe because I stopped to reheat it a couple times. It was really smooth before I started my reheating.

NO MICROWAVE, and quick and simple. I chopped some arugula, left it uncooked and added a sauteed green onion to that, dropped my fried eggs on that and added the sauce. Great!

Very easy but way too much lemon.  Next time I'm going to use only 1/2 a tablespoon!

I would definitely recommend this recipe. I like the extra flavor of the lemon juice as well.

We thought this was very nice.  I made half a recipe, and it was easy to make and tasted quite like what we thought it would.  I served it over chicken because hollandaise doesn't always have to go over eggs.  I would make this again.  Don't forego the cayenne because it adds the zing that I think this needed.  Thank you so much for this quick and easy way to make a hollandaise!
