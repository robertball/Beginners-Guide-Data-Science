I made it this morning and loved it.  Next time, I'll add the milk and ice cubes first and crush the ice a bit before adding the rest.  It got to be a bit much for my blender when I added everything at once.  Maybe because I used frozen fruit.

Delicious! I scaled this recipe down to one serving and it came out bursting with flavor. I used some vanilla flavored milk I had, mixed berry yogurt, and I added half a lemonade packet (the ones you stick in a bottle of water) and this smoothie came out just great. Perfect flavor combination; you wouldn't think it's something healthy:)

I LOVE this smoothie!! I like to make some substitutions, though. I use light vanilla soy milk, light n' fit yogurt and crystal light mix. It's a perfect light breakfast for a hot summer day - and super low in calories! In fact, I'm drinking one right now! :)

This is so good!!Scaled it down a bit though: used 1 container FF vanilla yogurt, 3/4 cup skim milk, 5 strawberries,1/4 cup blueberries and 1/2 packet of Crystal Light lemonade. This was the perfect combo!!!

Delish! Tastes like a smoothie I'd get from one of those uppity fru fru drink stores. My alterations: used vanilla non-fat yogurt instead of berry, used rasberries (frozen) in place of strawberries, and crystal light rasberry lemonade mix.

I think this recipe is good, but there is one thing I would change if I made it again.  When it calls for powdered lemonade, make sure to get the kind where you just mix the powder with water.  We used Koolaid brand and it was very tart.  After adding a couple tablespoons of suger, it was delicous!

I followed this recipe to a T and found it rather bland and watery. Where's the sugar? To improve on it, I changed the recipe by using 3 tablespoon of honey, milk instead of skim milk, 2.5 cups  of mixed berry and 4 teaspoon of the lemonade mix.

My food critic husband gave the modified version his thumbs up!

I don't use powdered lemonade mix but I liked the idea of the hint of lemon so I just added a little fresh lemon juice, which proved to be just barely noticeable anyway. I used frozen blueberries and strawberries and wanted this thicker, so I omitted the ice cubes and added just enough milk to get it to the consistency I wanted. Hubs is the one who drinks these and his first comment was that this was good but could be a little sweeter.  But by the time he got to his second mugful he said it was fine just as is.  :)

This was great! We used 2% milk. This had a nice zing to it from the lemonade mix. Thanks for the post.

This was such an easy recipe to make and it was so good! I made it using vanilla yogurt instead of blueberry yogurt, used frozen blueberries, and used cherry berry lemonade mix and it was great! Two thumbs up (-:

I'm pretty much on the side of those who said this was bland.  Blueberry usually gives these a pretty good flavor kick, but not so here.  Maybe it's all that milk.  Because my fruit was frozen the ice was unnecessary.  All that ice would really water this down.  The bit of lemon was a nice idea, but it tasted exactly like what it was: lemonade mix, and I thought it very obvious.

The addition of the lemonade powder adds just the right amount of tartness to this smoothie.  I used raspberries instead of blueberries and frozen strawberries, so I eliminated the ice.  This smoothie is very versatile as far as different berries that can be used.  A great, refreshing, summertime drink.  Thanks!

A great smoothie!  Variations:  I also made this once without yogurt and it was still great! Same flavor, a little less thick.   I've used frozen fruit instead of fresh, omitting the icecubes.

I used frozen strawberries and frozen blueberries, so there was no need for ice cubes. I also used 2% milk, as that was all I had. Both kids and I loved this one. I had found some sugar-free lemonade drink mix for cheap at Grocery Outlet a month or so ago so this worked out perfect. VERY good.

I have made this smoothie several times now. It is awesome. The only change I made to it was to add a little bit of honey to it. I like my smoothie a little bit sweeter. My daughter who has never cared for smoothies before loved this. Thank you for the recipe. This is definitely a keeper.

This smoothis is the shiz and I think that it should be made all the time around the world especially have it available in resturants. I also think this can be a party smoothie and could possible contain some alcohol to lighten up the night if ur in that  party mood, but on the other hand its also good as is and should be made all the time. Of course follow the recipe cause I accidently added to much lemonade powder and it came out a little lemony.

This was pretty good. I used fat free plain yogurt, light soy milk, and zero calorie/sugar free lemonade mix to make it healthier. I didn't have any strawberries so I used a banana. Next time I will cut the amount of lemonade mix in half, it was a little too overpowering.

I changed it up a little bit, I used vanilla yogurt and double the ice cubes (ten). I also used crystal light lemonade which is very strong, so in the future I will use half the amount. All in all I loved it, its a little strong on the sweet side, so a citrus fruit like an orange on the side would be great for breakfast! I plan on using it during the school year because I rarely have time to eat before I run off to school and this can eaisly be put in a coffee cup or water bottle to bring on the go!

Unfortunately, I did not have skim milk around and used whole, but the recipe still turned out great! And like another reviewer, I used a kool aid lemonade packet (only 1/2 tsp), making it super tart and had to balance it out by adding some sugar. It's certainly a nice break away from the regular strawberry banana ones I've been making all this time!!

LOVE this healthy drink, I did read the other reviews and can't wait to make it with light vanilla soy milk!  The sweetness from the blueberry yogurt and the blueberries and strawberrys is perfect!  Thanks for sharing this drink!

Fantastic & refreshing. I added a bit of water to make it a bit runnier. The lemon is a nice touch. You can substitute any yogurt flavour or frozen berries and it tastes great!

Had my Home Ec/Foods classes make this one - we used Strawberry Vanilla Yogurt because we had it on hand. Added the lemonade crystals and the other ingredients as listed. The most common comment I got was "When do we get to make this again??". I make one "drink" per week with them as a treat - Orange Julius, Iced Cappuccino, etc. This one was a "keeper"! Thanks so much!!

I transformed this recipie into a protein shake and it was the best I've ever had!  I put one scoop of vanilla protein (dymatize brand), frozen mixed berries, 1/2 packet of raspberry lemonade crystal lite, and 1 cup of ice cubes.  It was amazing!

I found this recipe to be very good.  My friend added more lemon mix than the recipe called for but it still turned out great.  It is a very addicting recipe that i could easily get use to having.

Delicious!  I used 1C frozen mixed berries (from Costco)and 1/2C plain yogurt plus the teaspoon of lemonade mix per the recipe.  The berries and lemonade mix give it a great flavor, you don't even need the flavored yogurt.  I also added a packet of Splenda but I'm not sure it needed it.

Pretty good nothing special though. I liked the extra bit of tast the Lemonad provides. We also added a small banana and some flax to it and it was a nice quick breakfast on the go.

This was a delicious smoothie Lisa. I used lemon yogurt and didn't need the ice as my berries were frozen. I also added a tablespoon of wheat germ for some extra goodness. Thanks!

Four stars because the idea of mixing the blueberries with the lemon flavor is awesome. But when I made this and it was    very bland. After I added a lot more of the strawberry lemonade mix it became sweet enough, but because I added it after I had finished the smoothie, I could still taste the granules.

Only changes I made were not using any ice cubes and used organic vanilla yogurt. I used refrigerated strawberries and blueberries so it was pretty cold without the ice. I made this twice in a week after finding this recipe and will continue to use it, probably on a weekly basis to get in some servings of fruit. BF also really liked this smoothie.

This smoothie was everything I want in a smoothie: low-fat/cal., easy AND quick to make, and FULL of flavor! I made the recipe exactly as described but substituted the blueberry yogurt or Dannon's light and fit raspberry yogurt. 

The sugar-free lemonade drink mix really adds some zesty, refreshing goodness to the smoothie! I am planning on making one tomorrow morning! Yum!

I used fresh blueberries and frozen raspberries (instead of the strawberries). When using frozen fruit, try skipping the ice!

Substituted the strawberries with raspberries (allergy) and as my first home made smoothie it came out great!  Super tasty, and the lemonade mix adds a great hint of extra flavor I've never noticed in smoothies I've had before!  I'll be making this again and again.

This is excellent! My family and freinds really like it. I agree with most everyone else, however. Either use flavored yogurt, or add some sugar (I, personally, add sugar.)
You can also use any fruit you want! I've tried strawberrypeach, grapeblueberry, and many others.

This was a really good, refreshing smoothie.  Using both blueberry yogurt and frozen blueberries made the blueberry taste stand out better.  I had to use a little orange juice because I didn't have the lemon, but I will try again with the lemon.

Really tasty. Maybe less milk than what it says cause it has a milky taste. It has a sweet taste not as much lemon taste in it as I thought. But overall it’s a great smoothie.

To make this healthier I used coconut almond milk - little more flavor as well.  No need for sweeteners.  Freezing strawberries and blueberries also eliminates the need for ice.

Be careful not to leave the smoothie alone for too long or it will curdle because of the lemon and milk. Trust me, I learned this the hard way. I tried to blend it again but it just got this weird jello-y texture. Nevertheless, it was a great tasting smoothie when I had it.
