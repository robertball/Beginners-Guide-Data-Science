I made this with regular flour and instead of mixing milk with cream I just used half and half for the whole thing. It was very easy to make, really quick and had almost no clean up, thanks!!

I also poured the whole thing into a greased, non stick pan and cooked it on medium heat until puffy. Then I sliced it into wedges. You can use any fruit topping you want on this :)

This was a great gluten-free dessert for my family. We used a different strawberry topping just because we didn't have all the ingredients on hand to make yours. But we loved the flavor of this, and the ease of making it. Thanks for sharing!

I've only made the sauce so far (to top Angel Food Cake), but it was fabulous! I used a frozen berry mix (blackberries, raspberries and blueberries), and threw in the 3 fresh straswberries I had on hand. I only had grape juice, not concentrate, so I used a bit more than called for. The berrie never poppd since they were frozen, and the sauce took a while to thicken, but again, they were frozen berries. The custard looks so good and easy, I can't wait to try it! This is my kind of treat. Love it-thanks!

I only made the berry sauce to top a pound cake.  Yummy!  I got a lot of compliments.  It took quite a while to thicken up - maybe because I used frozen berries?  This tart sauce was a perfect way to cut the sweetness of the cake and ice cream.
