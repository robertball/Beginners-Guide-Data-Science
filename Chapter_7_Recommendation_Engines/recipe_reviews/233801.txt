This deserves MORE stars than just the five!  We loved this.  Of course, you have to take into consideration the quality of the fish that you get, and we got ours at a high quality restaurant where they have a fresh fish market.  This was so good that I want to go back tomorrow to repeat this dinner!  I followed the recipe exactly (even using the brand of capers from the recipe submitter!) including the timing of the bbq'ing.  We could seriously eat this at least once a week!  Thanks so much!

Chilled the mayo/caper mix prior to putting it on the fish, stayed nice & firm. Added a little Old Bay to the marinade. Great recipe! Made my wife's the exact same way but substituted the Mahi Mahi with chicken breast.

I added garlic to the mix and topped it with Parmesan & panko then baked.  It was great!

The marinated fish was *excellent*.  I just marinated the fish and oven baked it at 350 for about 20-25 minutes in a glass casserole (I did not wrap it in foil).  Mom and kids liked the sauce, I was OK with it.  I used cod.

Absolutely fantastic and easy to follow recipe. I used flash frozen mahi mahi from Costco an did not use the Blackwell brand capers. I added a sprinkle of cayenne pepper along with the salt and pepper. I could not have enjoyed this dish any more and it was a hit with everyone else too.

This was super simple and amazing! I made the lemon caper sauce about 2 hours in advance. Some of the reviews stated that the sauce was bland so I spilt it into two containers and in one I added about a teaspoon of Old Bay Seasoning. Both sauces were good but the one with the Old Bay was outstanding! This is a keeper!

I added extra lime juice to the marinade as well as some old bay seasoning.   Also included scallions in the mayo sauce along with seasoning salt. Served this with steamed bok choy

I only made the sauce, but wanted to say I would rinse the capers next time.  It was too salty.

I tried this and my family was extremley disapointed.  
The sauce was very bland, did not have much flavor, I even added some dill to the sauce I think it needs alot more capers.  
I grilled my fish and it was tasty I used Ahi Tuna instead as I like the flavor better.

Sad to say this didn't do it for us. I had such high hopes but it really just tasted like mayo and capers on fish. I realize that's what it is, but I was expecting it to taste different. It also got runny as it sat on the plate and didn't look too appetizing. Maybe I did something wrong, or the quality of our fish was bad or maybe this just wasn't the recipe for us.

The only changes I made was to add Old Bay to the Caper Sauce and I baked the Mahi in the oven.

I am making the sauce again today to go with baked cod!

We loved this recipe.  I couldn't find the herbed cream cheese, so I substituted the vegetable cream cheese but kept everything else the same.  Will certainly make again as it is Keto/low carb friendly!

This was very good! Even hubby liked it. I have to agree with other reviewers that the sauce is underwhelming, with an overwhelming mayonnaise taste, if that makes sense. I added a Florida seafood seasoning and some dill but it was still just "eh." I will make this again but will have to work on tweaking the sauce! 

I served this with a side of roasted leeks and sweet potatoes for me, and steamed broccoli for my husband.

Served with basmati rice. I did add the suggested scallions in addition to the capers. Go slow with the lemon juice to avoid it being too runny.

I love doing this with the mahi mahi  we buy from Costco. It's flash  frozen and very good. I do add a little bay seasoning to the fish when grilling. And dill and Old bay seasoning to the sauce too. It is one of our go to fish dishes now. Thanks!
