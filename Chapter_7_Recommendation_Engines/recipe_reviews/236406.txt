VERY easy and quick to make.  Made half recipe for myself. Maybe fresh cooked bacon would bring out more bacon flavor.  Will be trying that next time.  Over all A-/B+

This was really good! I used fresh cooked, crumbled bacon in place of bacon bits. This went great with our soft pretzels tonight and I think it would even be great as a burger topping~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

The color of the dip made it look unappetizing.  So most guests didn't try it.
