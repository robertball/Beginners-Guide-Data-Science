It's really good and easy to make. I was a little unsure of what it would taste like in a tortilla but it adds to the flavor instead of taking away from it. I highly recommend using the uncooked tortillas instead of the regular flour variety you buy off the grocery shelf. The uncooked tortilla (that you heat in a pan at home) has a more refined and authentic taste. We swapped out the chocolate chips for milk chocolate peanut butter cups.
