Used this recipe because it seemed pretty close to what I used to make. The apple butter was very good and not as sweet as other apple butters. Definitely try to use Granny Smith's as indicated in recipe. I used a mix of McIntosh and Cortland apples and while the butter was still good, it was a little sweeter than I would have liked. My husband thought it was perfect. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this on my instapot. 7 minutes high pressure and 10 minutes natural release. Then after I blended it I slow cooked it on high with a lid on it slightly ajar for 5 hours. Its SO GOOD. Has a beautiful color and just the right amount of sweetness. I toast some English muffins, put some regular butter on them and then the apple butter. Best way to eat it.

It goes without saying, this Chef CANNOT make a mediocre or bad dish regardless of the category. You never cease to amaze me Chef.  This Apple Butter is by far the best I've ever had and making it is a breeze. If there were more than 5* to rate it, I'd have them all lined up and knocked each star down when I tagged it! ?? This would be AWESOME as Christmas gifts, a Birthday treat for a lover of this...like me! Thanks for sharing Chef. I can't wait to try more of your recipes. Y'all do yourself a favor, make it and make enough (in my case the freezer) be it canning or freezing.  Don't forget the gift idea; your friends will be dropping hints for bigger jars especially those who can't cook! Enjoy! IT ROCKS!!

I used Gala apples but tasted before hand so I could decide about the sugar amount. I decided one cup would be plenty and it was. I cut the salt down to 1/4 teaspoon and omitted the allspice as I didn't have any. This took pretty much all day but worth it. I will make again!

I used the left over honey crisp apple slices from my kids' lunch. I cut the recipe to 1/3 of the amounts. In total the process took 3 hours. The apple butter is delicious. I even compared it to a store bought brand already in my fridge and Chef John's far outshone it. I will make this again.

Made this apple butter today and it turned out GREAT! I only used a splash of apple cider vinegar, instead of water. And I used about a cup of apple cider. I only used one cup of white sugar and increase the brown sugar to 1 cup. I also used about 4 ounces of cinnamon red hot imperials. The color is absolutely stunning and the taste is off the charts!!!!!

I didn't make any changes other than only having 2# of apples peeled and cored. I just halved the ingredients. Very easy and very tasty. I will definitely make this again.

I’ve made this twice, and reduced the vinegar by half based on other reviews. It’s amazing! The first time I chose not to strain it, the second time I did, and it made it smoother. Because you don’t peel the apples, there are tiny slivers of peel left in the finished product but it’s not bothersome. If you want to remove them then press it through a fine strainer after it’s cooked. This makes excellent gifts to share! I’ll never buy store-bought apple butter again.

This was very good but our batch turned out a bit too sweet for my taste. That may be because we used a bag of mixed apple types picked by the kids from our trip to the orchard.  Or it could be that I personally just like things a little less sweet than others. Next time I make this, I will cut back on the sugar a bit. Other than that detail, it has great flavor. Our batch yielded 7 8oz jars.

Wow! Turned out just like I hoped it would. Definitely worth it. We got about 5 1/2 cups of apple butter when all was said and done.

SUPER easy! This was my 1st time doing ANY of this kind of thing. Cooked all day, made my house smell amazing. Im jarring for the future right now, it made 7, 8oz jars of apple butter, flavor it sweet and tart (might be my fault, in my excitement I feel some of the apples were under ripe). I cut a little smaller than 1 inch pieces and was able to cook for a little less time.

Fantastic,  im not an apple cider vinegar fan but i tried a batch with none, then 2nd batch with less sugar and half the vinegar and i believe the vinegar set it off! I like my apple butter a little more of a tart than a sweet one so...highly recommend  this winner!

Super easy to make. I used red delicious apples and it cooked up fine. Next time Ill cut back on the spices since this is a little too spicy for my taste as a  fruit "butter". 
I used traditional water bath canning method (for applesauce)  rather than refrigerating/freezing.

There is nothing that can compare to the sweet, cinnamony, applish taste of this superb blend of Chef John's ingredients: made it just like the recipe - except used McIntosh apples and did it in my Instantpot: very quick, indeed! However, using the Chef's great admonition - have patience - and it will come out unbelievably.

I followed the recipe except i put the lid on part of the 4-5 hours it was supposed to be uncovered.  I also used Fugi and Honeycrisp apples because i already had them,  so mine was pretty sweet, but It turned out to be so delicious...absolutely wonderful.  My friends and family who ate it thought it was really outstanding and that it wasn't too sweet.  I will probably use the same variety of apples again but cut back the sugar just a little because it isn't necessary

I used all quince the first time. Thought it was better than the one from the person that gave me all the fruit! I liked that it was not too sweet. Will use a combo of quince and apple today and report back.

My house was filled with the scent of apples, and spice lovely!  Truly a pleasure to make, stir and create Christmas  canned presents!

Excellent and well worth the time. I need to reduce  amount of apples since I have a small slow cooker. Mine will only take 1-1 !/2 pounds of apples.

This is a great recipe!  I've made slow cooker apple butter before, but never left the peels on. I followed the directions as written, with the only exception being it took a lot longer with my crock pot then the recipe stated.  However, it turned out wonderful, and I ended up canning it in jelly jars for Christmas gifts!

I love Chef John's recipes, usually.  This recipe - I hated.  Weird with the apple cider vinegar.  My boyfriend hated it too.  For as long as it took, I was expecting something great.  No where near to great.

I would peel the granny Smith apples cause for me the peel didn't really dissolve and if u drain the first liquid just add a bit of water to help it be smooth. Also a potato masher works good too.
