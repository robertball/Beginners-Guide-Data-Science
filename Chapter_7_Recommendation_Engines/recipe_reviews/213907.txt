This is great and exactly like my "Mom's Best Haroset" just without the pecans. My mom has passed away 4 years ago and Passover has never been the same without her haroset. Thanks for the memory.

I will be making this this year on Holy Thursday (my traditional commemoration), but I will be using Pomegranate Juice instead of Wine. We have alcoholics in our family, and there will be children there for dinner, too. I'm thinking that I'll use only 1 kind of Nuts (probably the Pecans, since I still have some left-over from Christmas Pecan Pie baking :) ) and that I'll toss in some Raisins or Craisins for just that additional "something" that will make it perfect.
