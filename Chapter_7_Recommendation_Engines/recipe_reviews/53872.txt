I probably would have given these 5 stars if I had used macadamia nut butter and carob.  But given the price of these items, and the difficulty in finding them, I used Cashew Butter and cocoa instead.  They still turned out great!  VERY easy, and firmed up nicely.  Thanks, Christine!

This is my kind of recipe! We don't eat chocolate, and at times I get this incredible craving for carob. Never made "no-bake" cookies before; I like the baking process too much, but it's been hot and this recipe looked good. 2 Tb of carob didn't seem enough, so I doubled it. Also, prefer the almond butter-carob combination better, or cashew butter, and so didn't use macadamia, but I'm sure that's excellent too. All in all, it was hard not to eat the whole plate at once, but I had to set a good example for the kids...

Drool drool! So easy and so decadent. (Can't bear carob, so used cocoa instead.)
