My family has been making this for forever. We do however make it different. When simmering the saukraut we add a couple of tablespoons of sugar to cut the sharpness of the kraut. I also never use cream of anything soup in mine, it surely isn't authentic with the soup in it.

Very good.  I had lost my family recipe for this dish.  The only thing I added that is in my old recipe is 1 cup of sour cream mixed with the mushroom soup.
Thanks Bea.

I really enjoyed this, as well as my coworkers. I followed the recipe exactly, except I halved the number of servings. The cooking time took a bit longer than stated, however, but I think it is well worth it. Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy to fix and the saurkraut does not overwhelm the flavors of the other items. MMMMM

My Polish MIL makes this often, but  she doubles the amount of pasta and skips the condensed soup.  She also tosses it all together in a baking dish and bakes it for 30 mintues at 350 degrees.  4 stars for her version.  2 stars for this one.

Honestly, just okay.  The recipe makes a TON -- literally filled my dutch oven -- and takes quite a while to cook.  I ate all the leftovers but probably won't make it again.  If I'm feeling lazy, I'll just go with frozen pierogis!

This was just ok.  I think it would have been better with more sauteed onions and some Kielbasa or something.  I don't know .... it was missing something.  I also love cheese potatoes with my perogies.  Maybe that is what I was missing???

People! To really make this the best part of Easter dinner, get a package (or 2) of FARMERS CHEESE and mix it through.  Everyone will remember it weeks after it is gone.  Make it as a side for polish sausage anytime of the year.

I made this recipe in the summer for a picnic and loved it.  It makes a lot so I shared it with the neighbors, my Polish Priest, etc.

Good, easy meal for a cold day. We even whipped up our own white sauce with mushrooms to make it even more "homemade". (I only gave it a 4 b/c it was pretty "heavy".)

We like to add turkey kielbasa. We cut in to discs and brown in olive oil, then add to the mixture and bake the entire casserole (put Italian breadcrumbs on top). Delicious!

3/11/17 - second time making, very easy and makes a lot!  Not great nutritional value but would be perfect for a pot luck.  We got tired of eating after 3 days ...  I used 1 lb sauerkraut with 1 lb pasta and 2 cans soup.

Hmm, definitely would agree with previous reviewers. missing SOMETHING. I even sauteed the cabbage and onion in olive oil to add flavor, and added a little bit of sauteed green peppers. I sprinkled the top with garlic cheese bread crumbs, then baked it on 350 for 10 minutes. It still just mostly tasted like cream of mushroom soup... Not sure how I will tweak it next time, but definitely want to try it again! My hubby loved it! :) Maybe garlic? Definitely Polska Kielbasas would be delicious but then this couldn't really be called a Pierogi Casserole... :)

Very good substitute for real pierogi.   Lots of flavor, yet easy to put together.

A bit too much butter, I'd say!  But otherwise, very tasty.
