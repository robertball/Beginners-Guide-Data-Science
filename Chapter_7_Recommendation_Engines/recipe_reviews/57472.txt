This turned out great. I used boneless chicken breasts and the grillmaster/husbandchef cooked these over the coals for 5 min each side then placed them in foil boats and spooned sauce on and cooked them another 5 minutes. He didn't soak the wood chips in the beer muttering something about "alcohol abuse" and chose to baste his innards instead with the ice cold beers. We used a store brand hickory sauce and this turned out great. There were no leftovers.
