This is my recipe.  What's up with people who give you bad ratings when they DO NOT follow the recipe?  If you don't follow the recipe and "do your own thing" and it's bad, keep your thoughts to yourself, PLEASE!  It's not fair!

This one is a winner!  I eliminated the tomatoe soup entirely as there is plenty of great sauce without it.  I also used sharp cheddar cheese.  In addition, I substituted Kuners refried black beans with lime.  They gave it the spicy zip that others felt was lacking.    I also prepared the burritos without the lettuce and tomatoe, put them in a 9X13 pan, topped them with the sauce and cheese and baked them at 250 degrees for about 20 minutes until hot and bubbly.  Then I served them on a bed of lettuce and topped with tomatoe and greeen onion.This was of restaurant quality when finished!

Very good and pretty easy to make. I think this is a five star recipe if added to the monthly rotation, but if looking for a special meal, I would give it four stars.  Anyways, like many other reviewers I made a few changes.  First sauteed small whole onion and 2 cloves of garlic in large skillet.  Then added 1 tsp cumin and 3/4 tsp oregano, then added ground beef.  After pink was gone from the meat I added the can of refried beans, the green chilies and a can of Rotel.  Moved the pan to a cool area and added cilantro. For the sauce I wanted to avoid the "tomatoey" flavor that other reviews tended to dislike so I eliminated the tomato sauce altogether.  Instead I mixed two 10 oz cans of enchilada sauce with the one 15 oz can of chili without sauce. To serve, I placed a small amount of the sauce in a 9x13 pan and then rolled the burritos and placed them in the pan, then covered them with the remainder of the sauce and a mixture of medium and sharp cheddar cheese.  Baked in a 350 degree oven for about 10-15 minutes.  Then covered the top of the pan with shredded lettuce, fresh tomato and green onions.  Overall pretty happy with the result.  Made 12 and found I needed two 9x13 pans.  Family ate 1 pan the first night and the 2nd the next and loved it.  Thanks for such an easy recipe...  Very nice on a school night.

I must say that the recipe does not state "authentic" or "healthy", so why all the angry bad reviews? This is quick and easy, and can use ingredients most people have on hand. And the quality of your ingredients is the key. You have to choose an enchilada sauce that you already know is good, a lot of cheap enchilada sauce is bitter, which will make this terrible. It is common sense, and if you are like me, you will know right away by reading the recipe if this is something healthy. People need to quit being so mean! This is a wet burrito recipe for goodness sake!

I prepared this recipe for Cinco de Mayo and must say I did not care for this!  My family didn't like it either.  I don't even have any suggestions as to how it can be inproved, other than , I think the person who submitted it originally and the good reviews for it must be from the East where there aren't many authentic Mexican restaurants and don't know how REAL good Mexican food should taste.  Sorry, just didn't like it, but other people may like the taste.

THIS IS A NEW FAVORITE!  Although they create quite a mess, they are very easy to make!  I always double the recipe and feeze half, I don't use the beans (we're not fans of beans), and I don't use the tomato soup, instead I use an extra can of enchilada sauce for a bit more spice!  I baked them instead of microwaved them, I like them a little crispier and I used a little bit more cheese.  We also like to garnish with black olives!  These have turned out GREAT every time, we will be enjoying these A LOT MORE!  THANK YOU!

These were the best burritos my husband and I have ever had. Even better than my favorite maxican resaurant. I substituted the tomato soup for 1/2 cup of salsa to add a little more spice to the sauce and I made my own guacamole. I also baked this dish at 350 degrees for 10-15 minutes without anything on top of the buriitos except cheese and green onions. It was fabulous.

Very good recipe!  I made these the night before and put in a 9x13 greased pan, added a little cheese inside before rolling up.  Added a little extra cumin and used only 1/2 can of refried beans.   Put the sauce on the next day right before baking.  Baked @ 350 for about 45 minutes, then added cheese on top and baked a little longer.  Served with chopped tomatoes, lettuce, and sour cream.  Husband and company loved them!

This recipe is destined for the hall of fame!  What a delicious and easy meal this was, the whole family loved it.  The only changes I made were to leave out the green chilies and serve them on the side so everyone could adjust the heat to their liking.  Also, I made all of the burritos, placed them in a large baking pan, and spooned the sauce and cheese over them.  Then I put them in a 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes to melt the cheese.  I can't say enough good things about this recipe.  I only used about half of the sauce (and I didn't skimp), so I saved the remainder for the next time I make this dish.  I can guarantee it will be soon!  Thanks a bunch, Sydney!!

These are better than some wet burritos I've had in Mexican restaurants.  I did make some changes, however.  I used ground turkey instead of ground beef because it is more tender, has less fat, and is equally delicious.  I cooked the ground turkey with onions, green pepper, garlic, and chicken bouillion cube.  Then I added some medium heat salsa (or picante sauce) and the green chilies and simmered.  Added chopped cilantro at the end.  For the beans, I made my own "refried" beans.  Pour the contents of can of pinto beans in a saucepan over medium high heat.  Add about 1/2 can of water.  Add chopped onion, green pepper, garlic, and bouillion cube.  Cook until beans are tender and most of water is evaporated.  Add tomato sauce (about 4-6 oz) or tomato paste (a couple of tablespoons) to thicken and add flavor.  After most of water is gone (make sure to stir often so they don't stick), then grind this mixture in a food processor or blender and you'll have the most flavorful, healthful "refried" beans ever.  Assembled the wet burritos as recipe calls for and everyone loved them!

Having been raised in a traditional Mexican home, these burritos were just not that good.  They were certainly not reminiscent of anything authentically true to kind of good Mexican fare that my mother and so many of my relatives made. Too many canned, processed products (come on, tomato soup?) made this very gringo tasting in my book, and the sodium, fat and cholesterol content was way to high! Not at all healthy!  If you're not familiar with traditional Mexican cooking, then this is probably alright. But for me, I was not at all impressed with the quality of this dish.

@ltgreen...why did you bother rating this?  Your "variations" are so far from the recipe that it makes it an entirely different dish.  The recipe, as written, is wonderful.

Wet burritos--- who knew they were such a regional favorite.  East coast doesn't get it, unless you run into someone from Michigan.  This turned out superb... although the tomato soup was noticeably tomato soup--- Enchilada sauce is the perfect substitute ***NOT SALSA!

This is a wonderful recipe.  We are very particular at our house when it comes to mexican food and my husband asks to have this for dinner.  I did make a couple of substitutions.  I eliminated the tomato soup, replaced the cumin with a TBS of chili powder, and added a can of Rotel tomatoes in place of the enchilada sauce and green chilis.  Absolutely fabulous!

Gets a A++++! I use green enchilada sauce and cut the tomato soup out. Everyone loves them when I make them. After I roll up the tortilla I get a pan with a little butter and fry the burrito both sides until crisp. Then I add the sauce and cheese and onion on top. Always a hit!

I loved this recipe.  I set a small portion aside because my husband can't handle refried beans and he still thought is was great.  I would like to point out to Paula Jo that no matter where you are from people can tell if something taste good or not.

This is a good recipe if you aren't expecting the authentic mexican flavors. Having lived over 20 yrs 12 miles from mexico and have spent a lot of time in Mexico, I've eaten alot of authentic mexican foods and have learned to make many of them. I made this dish according to the recipe, then made it again for that true mexican flavor.I used shredded beef brisket, omitted the tomatoe soup and canned chili, added cilantro, and made my own refried beans out of dried pinto beans that I cooked til tender, then I refried the beans in bacon fat (true mexican refried beans are refried using lard which is pork fat)

Followed the recipe exactly and we did not like it. The condensed soup and name should have been a clue that this recipe is heavily midwesternized. We don't call them "wet", we call them "smothered." Don't bother if you like Tex-Mex or more authentic Mexican food.

I made these last night! FABULOUS!!!  Probably the best burrito/mexican type dish I've made at home! I'm having some of the leftovers (there weren't many) now for lunch and they are even better today!  The only thing I did differently was not put the lettuce and tomato inside the wrap, we added those as toppings.  Absolutely delicious recipe!

Really, really did not like these.  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly.  The burritos were good, the sauce just was not our thing at ALL.  It really does remind me of the sauce from canned ravioli.  I'm kind of sad, I've been wanting to try these for a while. I'm not sure what would make these more to our taste, more than likely will not even try.

My husband rejects almost any  " mexican "  dishes. This even includes "GASP " enchiladas which are my favoriteHowever he loves this recipe!! the only change I make is to add the fresh veggies on top after baking. I have made this following the recipie and I have made it using "charlies slow cooked mexican beef" instead of ground beef.  Come on folks give the lady a break. the recipe is sound enough to play with and still not mees it up. ( if you can cook...)
Thanks Sydney for giving me a way to please my husband and kids as well as myself!

These were wonderful!  I had most of the ingredients on hand and threw them together in 30 minutes (including baking time).  I filled 6 burritos with ground turkey, refried beans and chilis, added the rotel/enchilada sauce/chili mixture to the leftover filling and poured it all on my assembled burritos, then topped with about 1 1/2 cups of mexican shredded cheese.  Baked in a 9x13 pan until the cheese was bubbly.  When I took them out of the oven I topped them with some chopped iceberg lettuce and served alongside tortilla strips (which we used to eat up the extra sauce).  These were so filling, my husband could only eat one!  I will definitely be making these again - fast, easy and satisfying!

Before I tried this recipe I had read the reviews stating it had a canned taste. Those reviews are spot on. I followed the recipe exactly and while everyone in my family ate it and thought it was okay, it isn't something I can see myself making again.

I want to start by saying that if you are Hispanic or used to authentic burritos this is not the recipe for you. My friend printed this recipe and made it. My husband is Mexican and so is her boyfriend. None of us cared for this recipe.

I made these last weekend and they were a hit! I read many of the reviews and made only slight changes to the recipe based on others advice.  I substituted on can of rotel for the tomato soup. I also used freshly roasted green chilies (the canned ones have no flavor and are a waste of money...in my opinion). I also baked in a 9x13 pan as suggested by others. Served with choice of toppings...homemade guacamole, sour cream, black olives, lettuce and tomatoes. Added a nice yellow rice as a side dish. Great dinner and will be making again.

My whole family loves this recipe - we've been enjoying it for years!  My only change is to use chili powder with the meat rather than cumin as I don't care for cumin much.  Very good recipe!

My husband and I think these taste and look like restaurant quality burritos.  I left out the tomato soup, added a 1/2 cup of salsa instead, and baked them at 350 for 20 minutes.  I wasn't sure about the chili w/o beans, but it was good.  They were very filling! Thanks for the recipe!

Fabulous is correct. Due to requests, I have made these several times. I stayed true to the content of the recipe but did change how I served them. I put the burritos together using the ground beef mixture, a sprinkle of cheese and a little bit of sauce for the inside of the tortilla. Then I put some of the sauce in the bottom of a baking dish and placed the wrapped tortilla on top. I covered them with a little more sauce and cheese and put them in a 325 degree oven for about 15 minutes, until the cheese was melted. I had the lettuce, tomato, green onion, sour cream, sauce and cheese out to let everyone apply the toppings of their choice to a warm burrito. This just seemed to work out better for us. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written.
Everyone has asked about the sauce as it seems to be one of the main flavors which puts this ahead of other burrito recipes. 
Thanks so much for the GREAT recipe!!!!!!!!

I didnt like it....All the canned ingredients gave it a "canned" taste. I like mexican and texmex but this just didn't make the mark... I wont be making it again.

I know this recipe doesn't claim to be authentic but honestly, it isn't good at all. Very "canned" taste. The filling for the burrito is good but the only way to make this better would be to make a sauce from scratch without canned food. Prefer Taco Bell over this one. Sorry...one star.

These are FABULOUS!!!!! Made 4 VERY lg. burritos for my fiance & I Sat. night. While I liked these, my fiance not so much. He didn't like the "beany" filling or "wet" texture, but he isn't a big "sauce covered burrito/enchilada fan" anyways, so no surprise there. These are basically an enchilada, rolled burrito-style. The only diff. b/t the 2 is just that - how they are rolled. I only made a few ch., for the most part out of necessity. Here's what I did: a) baked my burritos in a 350 degree oven for 20 min., b) subbed a 14.5 oz. can of diced tomatoes & green chilies, c) used La Preferida brand zesty salsa refried beans, d) served the chopped tomato, lettuce & green onion as garnish & e) used an entire 8 oz. bag of Mexican-blend cheese instead of just 2 c. worth (I sprinkled a generous amt. inside ea. burrito & the rest on top). I also spread a bit of sauce on the bottom of my baking dish. As I mentioned earlier, I made 4 burritos (all that would fit in my PC stoneware dish). I saved the remaining meat/bean mix. for nachos (yum!). Oh, and I really enjoyed the sauce, but do think I will use salsa rather than tomato soup next time (I usually don't have soup on hand, but this time I did). For a nice presentation, I served over shredded lettuce w/ a side of La Preferida Mexican rice (EXACTLY what our fav. Mexican restaurant serves - who knew!) & tortilla chips. Margaritas were the perfect complement. Thx. for sharing, Sydney : ) These are AWESOME!!!

I almost balked when I saw the tomato soup in the recipe but figured "what the heck" and gave it a try.
I stuck to the recipe but did add 1 teas. Cumin and 2 minced Garlic (must be my California heritage), my husband and I are flavor junkies! Otherwise my ingredients were the same.  
I was going to bake it but then thought I liked the idea of shredded lettuce and the fresh diced tomatoes in it, so I was a good girl and followed the directions to a "T".  After nuking them for 30 secs, I added a scoop of Guacamole, a scoop of Sour Cream, some Olives and sliced Green Onions.  We both loved this dish, the lettuce remained crispy inside and the flavor was great..........it's a keeper!

Great recipe!  I know people always say its not the same recipe if you change things but the second time around I omitted the chili and soup.  I felt like it really didn't need either.  Restaurant quality for sure.  Mine even looked so good I added a picture! :) Enjoy!

This is the best burrito recipe ever!!! My fiance couldn't believe how good they were even though he hates tomatoe soup (I think it really makes the sauce). The only thing I did different was bake them in a 9x13 pan instead of microwave. Awesome recipe...can't wait to make for company. Thanks

Good recipe... (I did NOT use the tomato soup) Rather than the canned stuff, I used some leftover chili I made and threw into the freezer last week. I also added a TON of spices and some mexican rice to the ground sirloin. I wrapped the meat into a burrito, then fried both sides in a pan with a Tablespoon of oil, then I put the burritos in an oven at 350, topped with the sauce and cheese.. To plate this I served on top a pile of shredded lettuce and topped with some fresh pico de gallo I made, as well as some sour cream..

These really ARE fabulous. I followed the recipe exact, using homemade enchilada sauce. I did add a little more cumin and a cup of shredded carrot. My husband inhaled FIVE stuffed-full burritos. Very good. This is going in the "keeper" file. EDITED NEXT DAY: I don't care if these aren't authentic mexican burritos. My husband loves them. I used the leftovers from last night to make him Ultimate Nachos today. He is well beyond thrilled. Kudos to the person who came up with the recipe.

As many other reviewers have stated, I too skip the tomato sauce and use green enchilada sauce.  I skip the sauce on top for the kids and add shredded taco cheese to the top and bake them at 350 for 20 minutes or so.  I have made these for a lot of get togethers and everytime they get rave reviews.  Thank you for a spectacular recipe!  (one quick note, if you're doubling the recipe, I have found that you really only need to double the beans, meat and enchilada sauce.)  Enjoy!

My husband loved it so much he said he would have paid money for it.  I did not use the ground beef.  I used the recipe for Drip Beef Sandwiches for the meat.  I just dumped the juice.  I added the rest of the ingred. after shredding the beef. I also added about half a bottle of beer.  I put the enchilada sauce mixture in a shallow baking dish, added the burrito's, topped with more sauce and cheese and put them in the oven till the cheese melted. We loved them.  I have quite a bit left over-the roast was about 3lbs. so I am going to make nachos tonight.

I like only a hint of hotness to enter my mouth. I prefer that my unscorched tastebuds be able to TASTE the food. This does it. I put a small bowl of chopped chiles and a bottle of hot sauce on the table along with the guacamole and sour cream. Now everyone can eat and enjoy! (I also make sure I have plenty of cold milk on hand in case of accidental flare ups in the mouth). I made this as written, and everyone at the table thought it was great!! 
So sit back and enjoy "bad food" now and again. Give your taste buds a treat - and have a twinkie for dessert!!!

I made this dish Tonight for dinner. I was very doubtful that my family would like it because of the chili in the sauce. Like it! THEY ARE STILL RAVING over it. My husband & both sons are fighting over the leftovers for lunch at work tomorrow. Only thing I might change is using a tad bit less "chili with no beans". It seems to take a lil away from the dish. Will I make it again, ABSOLUTELY YES!!

My son saw these and he exclaimed... "Enchiritos!" and by all means, he was right! He gobbled down 2 huge ones and "mmm"ed through every bite. lol ....
 I used ground turkey instead of beef. I also added some chili powder and cilantro along with the other seasonings. I served it on a bed of romaine lettuce and built it up from there... topped with tomatoes, olives, jalapenos & reduced-fat cheese. I served it with some of my homemade mexi-corn.  Truly, as the recipe title states... Fabulous! :)

Really good!  I didn't care for the brand of enchilada sauce we used... very strong... very spicy.  That didn't have anything to do with the recipe itself.  The recipe was yummy!  I made it exactly as written and would only change the enchilada sauce.  Otherwise, will definitely make again!

These were okay.  I followed the recipe, but my whole family thought the filling was really bland and boring.  I think if I did it over, I'd use chicken in a slow cooker with garlic, oil, cumin, chili pepper, salt, and chicken broth and shred it, then add the beans and finish the recipe.

Fabulous is right....but what posters said about leaving out the tomato soup was correct; it honestly doesn't need it

Restaurant quality!  The sauce is delicious and I'm not sure about West coast or East coast quality, as a previous reviewer mentioned, but a wet burrito isn't typical fare served in Mexico, so it doesn't matter what coast you're on, these are just darn good!

Yum! I was skeptical about the tomato soup but decided to use it anyway and I'm glad I did using just enchilada sauce would have been too spicy for the little ones. Will definitely be making this again and soon. Thanks for a family favorite.

We didnt really care for this recipe, it wasnt bad , it just wasnt to our tastes. It was too sweet and not spicey enough.But I havn't given up! I will make it again with a few changes. #1 being to omit the tomatoe soup.

Great tasting burrito; I ended up putting mine in a disposable pan, covering with sauce and a Colby-Jack shredded cheese combo and baked for 20 minutes. Topped with sour cream and picante sauce on the side. Wonderful meal. Cannot wait for the leftovers today.

Oh wow! These were so good! Me and my husband loved them. The seven year didn't but no surprise there. I made a small change or two. I used salsa instead of tomato soup. I made mine up put some of the enchilada mixture in the bottom of a casserole and put the burritos in and then covered the burritos with cheese and more enchilada sauce. I baked them for about 15-20 min. at 350 degrees. Wonderful, wonderful recipe. Try these, you will not be disappointed.

I made these for dinner last night.  I followed the recipe for the most part, but had to change a few things due to what I had available.  I used 10 inch tortillas instead of 12.  I also didn't put any lettuce in them.  I used one tomato and 4 green onions.  I put all of the burritos in a glass baking dish and topped them with some of the sauce (not all...it would be way too much),  sharp cheddar cheese (because I didn't have the mexican kind), green onions and the little bits of tomato left on my cutting board.  We baked them in a 425 degree oven for about 15 minutes.  They were yummy with a side of sour cream and the extra sauce if you really like alot.  I think next time I will add shredded lettuce on the side, too.  For me the sauce tasted a little too much like canned chili, so next time I might cut down or eliminate it all together.  I was also a little hesitant about the beans because my husband and I are not big refried beans fans, but the flavor was not overwhelming and the textures of everything blended well.  5 stars!

Loved this!  Followed the recipe, except I baked them instead of putting them in the microwave.   I will definitely make them again.  Next time I will add green pepper with the onions.  Personal preference.

Made this last night & it turned out amazing!! The only thing i did extra was add Rotel along with another can of green chile & cut up tomatos. I also didnt warm the tortillas in the microwave, i did in the oven for a couple of minutes(long enough for the cheese to melt but not too long or the shell would be to hard). Def adding this to my monthly menu:))

These were pretty good!  I did adjust one thing, I'm not a fan of refried beans, so I only used about half of the can.  Good call, personally speaking, as it was plenty bean-y enough with that amount.  Wasn't impressed with Hormel brand chili, but that was no fault of this recipe, I'll try a different one next time (Wolf brand was much better).  I thought the filling was just a tad bland, maybe because the beans drag it down for me, but I still really enjoyed the burritos and they were simple enough to make (problem solved -- I now make these w/o the refried beans).  Oh, I topped mine with the lettuce and tomato instead of putting those inside (plus some sour cream - yum!).  I'll certainly make these again, thanks for the recipe!

I've now made this three times and have loved it each time.  The first time I made it nearly to the letter, simply leaving out the tomato soup as I'm not a fan of it.  The second and third time, making "mexican style shredded beef" that I did in the crockpot beforehand.  Both times were amazing.  I prefer the shredded beef to the ground beef, but the ground beef is really good too if you'd like something faster.  I also add in cheese inside the burrito, cover with the enchilada/chili mixture, top with more cheese and bake at 350 for 20 minutes.  YUM!  Tastes just like the authentic mexican burrito I get from our local shop.  Definitely a keeper.

Mmmmmm...These were great! I nixed the tomato soup but made the sauce of new mexico red chile & the hormel chili with beans (didn't have any w/out). I also made Mexican Rice to put in the burritos and microwaved for 30 seconds as stated in the recipe and my family loved these.

Family loved this burrito.  I made as written with all ingredients.  The only change:  I put in a 13 x 9 pan and baked at 350° for about 30 minutes rather than using the microwave.  I individually froze the leftovers for a quick dinner on a busy weeknight.  Thanks SYDNEY6 - we very much enjoyed this.

These were only "okay" I don't think I'll make them again. Considering how unhealthy these are, I don't think my body will complain. I do Weight Watchers, and one of these is 24 points, for a reference, I get 30 points a day... yah, not good enough to be worth that.

I did like the meat filling though, which is the 3 stars. I'll use it in my burrito recipe from now on.

These were good - not quite fabulous. I followed the recipe except I did not add the whole can of refried beans and was glad that I didn't. I also baked these in the oven instead of in the microwave - but I think the result would have been the same. They were just missing something - not sure what.

I didn't have all the correct ingredients, so I am grateful the foundation of this recipe was right on the money, otherwise my variations would have been horrible, as it turns out, my changes enhanced a great recipe. So first, I didn't have chilli without beans, in fact I didn't have any chilli to speak of, nor did I have chopped tomatoes, or green onions, or chilli peppers or enchilada sauce. Ok so needless to say I took the remaining ingredients, plus added tomato paste, three cups of water, a package of taco seasoning, cream of chicken soup, and cook it all together in a large pot, once everything was cooked down, I added 1 cup of salsa and 1 can of diced tomatoes and peppers, the generic rotell tomatoes.  Anyway, I layered the bottom of a large casserole dish with the sauce, then placed one tortilla over it, layered with sauce and cheese and layered with another tortilla, until all ten were used. I put it in oven at 350 for 30 minutes to cook tomatoes all the way down. Then I served it over a bed of shredded lettuce with a spoonful of sour cream on top, wow too die for, the wet burrito idea was great, next time I will make it as designed, but I am glad I was able to overcome the missing ingredients.

Delicious!!  I followed other reviewers and omitted the tomatoe soup and used 20oz can of enchilada sauce instead. I put a little of the sauce on the bottom of a 9x13 pan, assembled the burritos, poured the rest of the sauce on the burritos and topped with cheese. Baked on 350 for 10 minutes just to melt the cheese.

These were so yummy and quick to make.  I don't think you could mess these up if you tried.  I too omitted the tomato soup and I didn't have any chili, so I did without.  So I just uesd a can of Hatch's tex-mex enchilada sauce and 2 TBSP of salsa.  The sauce was still very good.  In addition to the refried beans, I added a can of Bush's Black Bean Fiesta (grillin' beans).  It really added a nice flavor!  I made my burritos and put them in a baking dish and cooked for 10 min @ 350 to melt the cheese.  My family loved it.  I will be making this often!

I didn't put lettuce/tomatoes inside, I put them on top after baking. I made all 6, froze 2 for later, and refrigerated the other 4 for a couple hours until dinnertime and then baked at 350 for 20 minutes. Served with salsa verde, sour cream, and tortilla chips. Oh, and I used ground venison instead of beef, doubled the enchilada sauce, and used chili with bean (all I had). Thanks!

As a lover of Tex-Mex food, I can honestly say this is delicious. I can understand how others might think it was bland or something because there's not a lot of spices/flavors added. But on taste alone, with the mixture of beef, refried beans, and the yummy sauce that makes it "wet" - well this one is a winner. We gobbled it up and were stuffed afterward. Even my 9 year old literally licked her plate clean (good thing we were at home lol). 5 stars in my book!

I made this last night for Cinco De Mayo and it was a huge hit! I did change some things because some of the dinner guests cannot have spicy things.  I omitted the chilies and green onion and just added taco seasoning to the meat/bean mixture about half a packet.  I also forgot the tomato soup at the store and had a Soup At Hand Tomato soup and just added 1/2 since it's not condensed.  My family can't wait until I make it again.  I served it with sour cream also and mexican rice and of course strawberry margaritas!!!

Quick and easy.  Used  (9 ounce) jar homestyle beef gravy  in lieu of chili without beans, because that's what I had on hand, and the gravy was suggested in another recipe.

Popped in the oven, not the microwave.
5 Stars for easy, speed and taste for an everyday recipe.

Loved that. I'm not a big burrito person, but my husband likes them.  And I enjoyed them too.  This will definately be in the dinner rotation.

I'd actually give this a 4 1/2 stars. Over all this dish was really really good plus really easy and fast. We made it almost exactly. We did not add the lettuce or diced chilies as some didn't like either but I don't think it made too much of a difference (although I'd love to try it with the lettuce). We didn't did have cumin so we used coriander. We also added cheese to the inside of the burrito as well as on top. And like the others suggested we baked it in the oven for 20 min.
I was skeptical about the chili without beans and the tomato soup but after reading the other reviews I used both. I am glad I did!
I think next next we may try adding rice to the burritos, maybe corn or black beans. I can't wait to make it again!

My husband loves these.  I grew up in SoCal and also grew up eating "Mexican" food.  After moving to Colorado 20+ years ago; I've learned that every region has differences and respect that - especially in cooking.  Because someone says it "isn't traditional" means nothing to me.  This is a great little recipe for a filling, easy, satisfying meal!  I like to make my own enchilada sauce, use my homemade chili (I keep tons in quart freezer bags) and mashed pinto beans, then I bake these - my husband thanks you for posting this recipe, and so do I.

Really, really delicious!!!  Only change that I made, was to roll up the meat/bean mixture inside tortilla; put all burritos in a 13x9 pan; cover with tomato soup mixture; top with cheese and bake in 350 oven for 25 minutes.  YUMMY!!!  Husband like too!

I was a leery at first because I grew up on mexican and tex-mex and I had never heard of a wet burrito, it sounds like something a yankee came up with, especially using tomato soup. But,I've made this twice. It was fairly good the first time even though I had to use a brand of enchilada sauce I don't care for to get the right size can. The second time I used my favorite Hatch brand enchilada sauce and subbed a small can of tomato paste for the soup. It was excellent! After I melted the cheese on top I drizzled them with crema mexicana. For you yankees it's like the mexican version of creme fraiche. The next time I'm going to use one of my favorite burrito fillings. Brown 1 lb lean ground beef with 1 lb chorizo(the fresh stuff not the portugese kind they have up north) and a finely chopped onion,drain excess fat and add 1 can of refried beans,stir over low heat til thoroughly blended. It should be just as good.

I liked these, as did my neighbors!  I didn't add the diced green chile peppers (I am a sissy when it comes to heat!).  Followed recipe, except didn't put lettuce and tomato inside burrito - I didn't think I'd want nuked lettuce and tomato inside; served on the side with sour cream.  Also, didn't use green onions, as I didn't have any.  Tried one nuked by itself, others I put in a Corningware casserole and heated up.  Also, made the "Homemade Flour Tortillas" from this site.  They were good too and I made 12-8" tortillas from the recipe. Kept them soft and pliable with damp paper towel and waxed paper, in a plastic bag. Give it a try!

I must have done something very wrong. I did not care for this. Everything went well until I topped with the enchilada sauce combo. Mine was bitter and hot-----no other flavor----and I used mild sauce no less. I always read the reviews before trying any of the recipes and was really excited about this one-----so many people love it.

These were good but considering these are made with enchilada sauce and chili peppers, I was expecting a little more "kick".  I also wasn't crazy about the the sauce.  It was too "tomato-ey".  I will, however, try making these again but maybe with some chili powder and without the tomato soup.

This has become one of our favorite recipes - it tastes just like going out to a great Mexican restaurant and is SO easy.  I've made it 4 or 5 times and always look forward to eating it!

I make a couple small changes.  I use chili beans instead of refried beans - I didn't like the consistency of the refried beans mixed with the beef even though I usually like refried beans.  Then, instead of tomato soup I use one can of red enchilada sauce and one can of green enchilada sauce - medium for a little kick!

I serve them on the plate with a side of Mexican rice and refried beans and my boyfriend always comments how it looks just like his favorite restaurant - and tastes as good too!

Unbelievably good burritos!! I used whole wheat tortillas and I baked them in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes (should have done 15-20).  I think one thing I would do different next time is make my own enchilada sauce.  The sauce was good, but I would like to try one of the others from this site.

I thought this recipe was very good!  My husband loved it and it will become one of our monthly meals.  I followed some of the others suggestions and also made some of the following changes.  I added some chili powder and finely diced up about four slices of jalenpano hot peppers and mixed them into the bean mixture for some spice.  I substituted 1/2 cup of salsa for the tomato soup.  I poured some of the sauce into the bottom of a 9 x 13 glass dish (this prevents sticking), Layed the tortilla flat and filled with bean mixture and toped with a few tablespoons of cheddar cheese and then rolled tightly. Placed them on top of the sauce.  I used burrito size flour tortillas and managed to get to get about six burritos side by side and then two burritos long ways into the dish.  Just play with it to make enough room.  Then I poured the remaining sauce over the entire dish.  I covered with aluminum foil and baked at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes or so until hot and bubbly.  I then uncovered the dish and sprinkled with cheddar cheese and baked an additional 5 or 10 minutes until cheese is melted. You can then top with whatever you like...lettuce, tomato, sour cream.  You can also make this ahead of time and keep in the refridgerator.  You may just have to heat a little longer.  Enjoy!!  We did!!

This was fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly except for the substitution of our favorite salsa for the tomato soup as others suggested.  

My husband absolutely loved it and asked that we have it again soon.  We've decided to pass on going out for mexican and stay home as this is much better than similar dishes we've had out.  Very easy and so good.  This recipe will stay in our regular meal  rotation.

Great.  Followed the recipe exactly except I put the burritos with only the meat filling in a casserole dish and covered with the sauce.  Bake covered for about 20 minutes at 350 degrees, uncover, top with cheese, and bake another 5-10 minutes.  Top with lettuce, tomatoes, fresh cilantro, etc.  Tastes better than restaurant burritos!

We (bf & I) didn't really care for this recipe.  It was quite a lot of work, and then the sauce ended up tasting a lot like ketchup.  That might be because I went for "mild" on all options -- perhaps if it was spicier it would be better... but I'm not a big spice fan. :)

The one thing I couldn't find was "chili without beans" -- isn't chili, by definition, bean-filled?  I asked at my grocery store and they told me it is "chili sauce".  Or is it something else, maybe an American thing not available here?

If you want authentic go to Mexico. If you want a really good wet burrito then try this. Try to use name brand ingredients and not the generic. It eliminates some of the "canned" taste some are  referring to. I have also used chicken instead of ground beef and it is just as good.

Excellent and easy to make.  The filling isn't much different from a recipe I've used in the past, but with some differences.  What really makes this recipe great is the wet sauce, which is very tasty without being too spicy.  As a single man cooking for myself this recipe created plenty of extra for leftovers and they reheat just fine, too.

This dish is good and easy, it isn't "authentic" Mexican food but it's good just the same.  I used homemade enchilada sauce and omit the chile beans. I also baked instead of microwaved. Looking for a fast meal for the family this is your answer. thank you.

This is my family's most requested recipe as these burritos taste like ones from our local Mexican restaurant.  The secret is in the sauce.  I brown the meat and add a packet of taco seasoning only.  The refried beans are a side item like the lettuce, tomato, cheese, etc.  I also use extra-large burrito tortillas (larger than the 12" inch size). Take your tortilla, spread refried beans in the middle, add meat and cheese.  Roll up burrito and top with sauce and more cheese.  Pop it in the microwave for a minute or until the cheese is melted and then add lettuce, tomatoes, etc.  I don't care for warm lettuce and tomato and that's why I add it last.  With regard to the sauce, I mix all ingredients in a blender so it has a nice, creamy texture.  I don't heat it on the stove as it's going into the microwave anyway.  Excellent recipe!!

I made this for 3 teenagers who will eat almost anything, and my husband and I. Nobody liked it as we did not care for the flavors of the sauce. I followed the recipe exactly, and family vote was to not make again. That being said, with a few changes, (like omitting the tomato soup) this might become palatable.

Great recipe.  I did not have any tomato soup so I substituted 1-1/2 cups of my favorite salsa.  My husband said he liked it better than the restaurant we frequent.  Thanks for a great recipe.

yes i loved these wet burrito's, no they are not authentic, but to us, usa born, they taste great, but did not add tomato soup, did not want this to be a campbells thing, there is a authentic mexican restaurant, and they serve authentic, but were loosing business, s they came up with a wet burrito, all meats are cooked by the mothers and grand mother and aunts and uncles, the beans start out dry and cooked to perfection, choice of pinto, or black beans, love black beans, well made it my way, excluding tomato soup, a good enchlada sauce, which i bought from the authentic mexican restaurant, they gave me tips, they serve wet burrito's to stay in business, also mexican breakfast burritos, i really do not know what goes into these, but they are good, so quit complaining about all of this, make it the way you want, i do, i do not feel that one person has all the answers, cooking from your heart is what it is about, don't like canded good, make your own, what ever scratches your itch, some great receipes come from mistakes, or a genius idea, love wet burritos!! make it your way

These were actually pretty good.  They do NOT taste like anything traditional or even Tex-mex, but more like a chilli cheese burger.  The only change I made was to line them, seam side down, in a greased baking sheet and pour all the sauce over them, then sprinkle with cheese and bake at 325 for about 15 minutes.  Microwaving them one by one is just silly. Also, I skipped the tomato soup. Overall, we enjoyed it!

We give the recipe only 4 stars as it is written. But with minor changes it deserves 5 stars! We omitted the tomato sauce and added an extra can of enchilada sauce. Doubled the onion in the meat mixture. Rolled up 8 burritos with plenty of monterey jack cheese in each, and put them in a 13x9 baking dish, covered with sauce (we did not heat the sauce), and baked at 350F for 30 minutes. Fast, cheap, and delicious!

This was GREAT!!  I added a few more spices to the meat mixture (paprika, cayenne pepper, and red pepper flakes) because we like a little heat.  My husband does not really care for mexican food and he talked about how good this was.  I doubled the meat mixture as well, but did not double the red sauce mixture and still had plenty of it left over.  This will be one of our regulars! Thanks so much for this one!

Never heard of "wet" burritos before, but I tried this recipe recently and found I really like wet burritos - sort of like enchiladas but a little less work. I used ground turkey and vegetarian refried beans (no lard) and I subbed Rotel tomato sauce for the tomato soup. I had never seen Rotel tomato sauce before, but it was very good in this recipe. I have the filling, sauce, and tortillas on hand now for a quick lunch. I froze some of the filling for future burritos.

I made this for family and friends a couple of weeks ago and all I can say is FANTASTIC! These are as good, if not better, than any I've had in restaurants. I did not change a thing to the recipe ingredients at all. The only thing I did differently was place all of the rolled burritos onto baking pans, topped with the sauce and cheese and then baked for a few minutes to melt the cheese. Everyone loved them and one of our friends who is Mexican said they tasted just like what his mother made when he was growing up. Simple to make, great taste.

This is a Keeper.  Even if I just make regular Taco's my son prefers a burrito. I'll just make the sauce and use it and he loves it! I will be putting this in my recipe box!

We really enjoyed this.  I made my own enchilada sauce because I do not like it canned.  Other than that, it was great!

I used 2 cans of ench sauce instead of the tomato soup. I was thinking that it was just ok but not good enough to make again. Hubby inhaled his first one (thought he was just hungry) and put down another one pretty quickly. 9 yr old didn't like it. As I was cleanning up, hubby said it was good and asked that I make it again (he really isn't that vocal about dinner). I mentioned that I thought it was just because he was hungry, he said partailly, but mostly because he liked it. Ok, guess I'll make it again.

After reading some of the reviews I chose not to use the tomato soup which was a great decision as I prefer a drier, wet burrito. I used chicken instead of ground beef just because I realized too late I didn't have any but these were so good I will be making them again soon with the beef. My guy's ex was Mexican and so he hates Mexican food because that's all she cooked and he said, "put these on our regular menu because they don't taste like anything she's ever made."

I followed the recipe except my sauce was just the enchilada sauce with the canned tomatoes.  I thought it was really good.  I only gave 4 stars because it did lack a little "pizzaz" but everyone (kids & DH) liked it.  Of course I love enchiladas and this is a little similar.  It's easy and versitile, you could add whatever into the filling (peppers, shrooms, spicy things, chopped carrots & celery).  I didn't this time but I will, I like to sneak in veggies for my family.

Will for sure make it again.

I made these with shredded chicken instead of the ground beef and spices. I omitted the soup and chili. On the inside: fat free refried beans, chicken, tomatoes, spinach, cheese. Topped with: cheese, fresh cilantro and scallions. I baked them (covered with foil) at 350 for 20 minutes, then I removed the foil and baked for another 5. After they came out of the oven, I topped them with sliced black olives. Served them with sour cream, sliced avocado and tortilla chips. Delicious! I think next time I will omit the refried beans and make black beans & rice to add to the filling.

Very good, not very spicy though.  I doubled the spices to add more zip to the burrito.  The recipe makes lots of sauce, enough for a double recipe.  I will freeze it for next time.

Ehhh, not what I had in mind. The meat had no taste to it when the spices were added. I had to add chili seasoning, garlic salt, onion powder and more cumin. And as for the sauce that goes over these "fabulous" burritos, it tasted too much like tomato. Will not make again...

I made the recipes pretty much as written - I didn't have time to read reviews to figure out what everyone else had done/not done to"improve." I must say- I made the meat mixture, tasted it and was worried as to whether or not it would turn out okay.  Same with the "sauce"  My kids had after school activities, so I assembled the burritos (without lettuce & tomato inside) and put them in a 9x13 dish.  Heated the sauce and left it on the stove (so the burritos didn't get soggy).  After sports, I came home, smothered in sauce & cheese & baked at 350 for 20 minutes. Served on a bed of lettuce topped with more onion, black olives, chopped tomato and sour cream. There was no need for my earlier skepticism.  The flavors came together SO well!  My 3 young kids (10 & younger) gobbled their burrito!  Will definitely make again!!

I'm glad I finally tried this recipe. Its really good, I've been looking at it for about a year. I did cut out the tomato soup and added an extra 1/2 can of enchilada sauce. I baked them instead of microwaving. Easy and a big hit with my family, served this with Mexican Rice III (AR)

Growing up a restaurant close to my house served wet burritos and I haven't been able to find them since they closed. I did make a few adjustments: I used a can of black beans pureed in my food processor since I didn't have refried on hand. Added a layer of picante salsa before rolling up the meat. Omitted the can of chili without beans, also didn't have any. Put the lettuce and green onion on top after melting the cheese instead of inside so it would stay crisp. FInally, I topped it with sour cream, a lime wedge and jalapeno relish. SO GOOD.

This recipe is okay.  I really enjoyed the sauce on top but it was very "tomatoey".  The filling is really just ok.  There is too much refried beans in the filling giving you a mouthfull of mush with every bite.  It is really easy to make though.

Yum... this hit the spot!  We used ground turkey in ours and I made a few changes; inside I omitted the chopped chili's and added 1 T of chili powder.   For the sauce on top I left out the soup.. Fabulous! :)

Very wet!  Overall good flavor, slightly salty. I omitted the tomato sauce and next time will omit the salt also.  Used verde enchilada sauce and only 1 cup of cheese on top.  Followed recommendation of others to bake instead of nuke.

I loved the sauce for this, perfect amount of sweetness (not too sweet as I was afraid it would be), perfect amount of spicy.  I gave it 4 stars since I didn't follow the rest of the recipe, only made the sauce and used it the same way over chicken enchiladas.  I was really leary of the sauce after reading reviews, but I think if you live in an area where you dont' often get authentic Mexican food, you'll love it.

This is a 5-star recipe because it, A) Tastes so good, and B) It's easy and fast!!  Good recipe for busy after-school nights!  My only change, didn't use the tomato soup in the "gravy", didn't miss it at all, in fact glad I didn't add it, so thanks to all the reviewers who said to skip it.  It really pays off to read the reviews around here!

Made this recipe for my husband and I last night.  I chose it not only because it was so highly reviewed by others, but because it seemed really easy to make, even with all the ingredients listed. -AND- I've seen tons of episodes on Food Network where they visit a mexican restaurant and they pour this fabulous looking red sauce over it.  I had to try it.  So, I've got to say that this dish was not only easy to make, but it tasted fantastic.  I didn't change anything, but I did add mexican style rice inside the burrito.  I love rice in my burritos for some reason.  But let me talk about the red sauce..... I was amazed that a can of chilli, tomato soup and enchilada sauce, could make such a wonderful, spicy red sauce.  You dump each can into a pot, heat it up and it's ready.  I just stirred it up a couple of times.  Can't get any easier than that.  I don't have the time to spend hours preparing a true mexican red sauce, so this one was great.  You have got to try this recipe.  Yummy!

So good! I've been craving Mexican food and this hit the spot! Did change it up a bit by adding cooked white rice and cut down on some of the fat by using ground turkey, fat free sour cream, & fat free refied beans. Also followed another cooks suggestion and put it in a 9x13 pan and cooked for about 20 minutes at 350. Will make these again and again!

My husband loves carnitas wet burritos from a local taco shop so I thought I would give this a try. It was very good, I questioned putting together the chili w/out beans with the enchilada sauce but it came out great made exactly as directed minus green chile peppers and I will make again. Maybe next time using shredded beef instead of ground beef.

this was amazing!  I sent my husband to the grocery store with a list and he came home with steak chilli without beans as it was all he could find..  it looked kinda like dog food but the whole dish was amazing!  I cooked in a 9x13 pan and added some cheese to the beef mixture before rolling!  I omitted the tomato soup and served with lettuce tomato and sour cream...  Husband loved it I loved it and I am going to make this dish for my family's next get together!  Thank you so much for such an easy quick dinner recipe!

These are EXCELLENT! I followed the recipe to the letter with the exception of using chili with beans. I was a tad nervous after reading the reviews that the tomato soup made the sauce too sweet. I am so very glad I decided to make as written because they are perfect! I topped these with sour cream,  I love them and will use this recipe often. Thanks :)

Pretty good. Made as directed, except left out the green onions, as I don't like them. One totally filled me up so I have leftovers. Maybe I'll have another for dinner. Husband also really liked them.

This is the first time that I have tried to make burritos at home. My family loved them. It reminded me of the burrito at our favorite mexican restaurant. I made the recipe exactly as written and it was perfect. I may try with chicken next time. Thanks for the recipe!

My family did not like the sauce you use to top these burritos, and I didn't like it either.  I admit it could have simply been the brand of enchilada sauce I bought, but it wasn't tasty at all.  I am giving it two stars because the filling was decent.  Not something out of this world, but it was good enough to make again if I want to fill taco shells, top nachos, or make tostadas.  Oh, and we live in New Mexico, so it could also simply be that we eat more traditional Mexican food here and this was simply not something we are used to!

Huge hit with the familly. I used as much low fat/healthy items as possible.  Extra lean turkey, added chopped green pepper to meat mixture, turkey chili, Heart Healthy tomato soup, fat free vegetarian refried beans & 1/2 c. of 2% cheese.  Also used shells that are very high in fiber and low in fat.  It didn't make it taste 'healthy' at all!!!  They all loved it, I will make again and again.

These are very good. I poured some sauce in the bottom of a 13x9 pan and placed baritos in then topped w/ sauce and cheese.  I only had green enchilada sauce but it did not seem to matter.  Very filling!

WOW!  I'm not one to rate many recipes, especially when there are already so many great reviews, but I just HAD to come back and say how incredible these are!  We had these two nights in a row and couldn't wait to eat them the second night.  I also did not add the tomato soup and baked them in two separate 9x13 pans.  OUTSTANDING!  Thank you!

Absolutely fabulous!  I have made this dish at least 4 times and it is excellent.   Make sure to use salsa instead of the tomato soup in the sauce that goes over the burrito.

Really enjoyed the burritos. I followed some of the other suggestions by not using the tomato soup. I did add a lot more spice to the meat mixture (we like it really hot). Made all the burritos then placed in a glass baking dish and into the oven for about 20 minutes. We will make these again.

Great burritos, even my step daughter said these were "amazing!".  It sure made a lot of sauce even though I was pretty generous when serving.  I froze the leftovers to save for the next time I make these.

These were pretty good, the sauce seemed to be lacking something although I'm not sure what.  I'm not sure I liked the thickness of the meat/bean mixture and I did thin it out a bit with some leftover beef broth I had in the fridge.  Otherwise everyone seemed to enjoy them and they were so easy to make!  I'll try again but maybe experiment a little.

Pretty good, we needed a little more heat for our taste buds.  Baked and served with guacamole.

Awesome burritos.  I made these "as is" because I was cooking for two people who don't like spicy food.  If you do like it spicy, you will need to add some jalepeno's or some hot enchilada sauce, because it's a very mild recipe.  Excellent recipe, thanks!!

Tasted great! I had to make some changes for lack of ingredients. Instead of topping with ENCHILADA SAUCE/CHILI- I used 1 can of tomatoe soup and I blended 1 can of mexican style diced tomatoes. (tomatoes with spices) 1 tsp of onion powder, 1\2 tsp each; oregano, basil,  cumin, salt, pepper. Simmer. I added some Wondra Flour for thickening. Warmed the tortillas for 20 sec and wraped up the meat mixtures, topped with the sauce and shreaded cheese and baked for 15 min at 350. Hope this helps for those lacking can of enchilada suace.

Good,good,good.  These tasted as good as my fav burrito from the local authentic mexican restaraunt.  I also followed the advice of others and did not put the tomato soup and used more enchilada sauce.  I also added sliced black olives and jalapenos.  Wonderful.

These were SO GOOD.  I can't even write what my husband said about them. He loved them.  I did as others said and instead of using cumin I added taco seasoning to the meat/bean mixture.  I also cooked them until the cheese was melted.  I will definitely make again and again.  Thanks.

This recipe is excellent.  Like many others, I tweeked a few things.  I used taco seasoning and a bit of chili powder.  I added spinach to the beef mixture instead of lettuce.  I also only used half of the tomato soup and included four oz of salsa.  I added two tbsp of cheese before wrapping up the burritos.  Baked at 350 for 20 min, took the burritos out and added a bit more cheese, back in for five minutes. Topped them with lettuce, tomato fresh cilantro and sour cream.  A few cut jalapenos on the side and they were good to go.  I served these at a dinner party and everyone loved them!

Sauce tasted slighlty like tomato soup or canned ravioli- yuck!! Would rather used canned or the "10-minute enchilada sauce" recipe from this site. Thought the beef needed a lot more seasoning, and overall, the dish could use MUCH more cumin and heat. Will not make again.

My husband said these taste just like the ones his mom used to  make.  I didn't put the lettuce inside the burrito but on top, along with olives and jalapenos and the tomatoes and onions.  I also added burrito seasoning to the ground beef and used 1/2 the refried beans.  Delicious!

Rockin' good!  I put these together like enchiladas- meaning I put the filling in, put them in a baking dish, added the sauce over the top, put the cheese over everything and warmed it in a cool oven until my husband got home.  YUM!!!!!!!!!  This is the kind of food that starts good and gets better and better and better with each bite!!!  GOOD STUFF!!!

This was good, but I was hoping for great.  The only thing I didn't really like was the sauce - it had way too much tomato flavor for me.  I think next time I will try adding half the amount of tomato soup, or maybe omit all together.  Maybe just a personal preference, but the tomato soup just took over the whole dish.

Made a few changes to suit our tastes and what I had on hand but we loved this!  Used about 2T. of very hot homemade salsa in the filling.  Also put about 1 T. diced canned tomatoes and about 2 T. shredded cheese inside the tortillas and left out the lettuce and fresh tomato.  For the sauce I used a can of salsa verde and the rest of the can of diced tomatoes with another 2 T. of the very hot homemade salsa.  I topped it with more shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheese (because I was out of Monterrey Jack cheese) and baked it at 350 for about 25 minutes.  To serve I topped it with the reserved lettuce and tomato.  Will definitely make again and again!

Very easy to make, because you're just mixing a bunch of stuff.  They end up looking pretty impressive.  The sauce (unchanged from recipe) was on the sweet side, so if you enjoy that sweet/salty combination (as we do) - you will like it.  My husband said he enjoyed this more than food he's had at local Mexican restaurants.

UMMMM...This recipe was great. I only used 1/2 can of tomato soup and 1/2 cup of salsa, and instead of all the spices I used a package of burrito seasoning. My 7 year old loved it and even said that it was better then our favorite mexican food rest. Thanks for sharing this recipe I've already given it to two people and I only made the dish an hour ago....

I thought these were very yummy!  I did modify a bit.  I used salsa instead of the tomato soup as some others
suggested, it just sounded better.  Also, I used turkey chili and low-fat refried beans to make it a bit healthier.  There is so much flavor going on with these burritos, you don't even notice!

I have made these a few times already.  My husband loves them, and the kids think they are great!  Personally, I love them myself.  They are a little time consuming to make, but well worth the results.  I have used some of the other raters tips, such as putting them in the oven rather than the microwave.  A great touch!  We also used Taco seasoning instead of all the spices, and it works out well.  Definately, a KEEPER for us!  Thanks a bunch!

My husband absolutely loved the sauce for this.  I really didn't care for it, I really disliked the tomato soup flavor.  The sad part was, that was the best part of this recipe, otherwise it was just regular, run-of-the-mill burritos.  The meat really needed something, although I'm not sure what.  The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because my husband raved and raved about the sauce, and insisted I make it again.  My sole rating would have been 2 stars.

Fabulous recipe!! Very easy to make, very quick to prepare and very tasty. We followed the recipe as stated and it was a hit even with an 8 yr. old. The flavors are delcious together and we thought the dish tasted better than our local Mexican restaurants offerings and we live in an area with many authetic Mexican restaurants. Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I thought the tomato soup an odd ingredient for a Mexican dish, but the sauce was great. The bean filling had a wonderful flavor. I put it all together and baked it in the oven until hot. I will definitely make them again.

Very good and easy. Did make a few changes though.  I used a package of taco seasoning instead of the spices and instead of tomato soup I used about 1/2 c. salsa.  I baked them in the oven then put the shredded lettuce, olives and sour cream on the top.  Also added some cilantro on top - what is mexican food without cilantro!!!

This is really good!!  I didnt have cumin so I just threw in a taco seasoning packet, so it was probably pretty similar!  The sauce on top was great too!! So tasty and you only need one to fill you up!  I might cut the tomato soup in half or out next time, i put a lot of tomato on  as topping too so I could really taste the tomato soup, but really it was great as is!!

I've been cooking for many years; this recipe took me more than fifteen minutes to prepare, or I'm just a slow cook. I thought it was much better the next day. Also, make sure you use really good quality tortillas, the authentic type, not "Mission".

I feel awful giving this recipe a bad review because I know the submitter has been following. So full disclosure, I made this for our whole family, including picky kids, so I left out the chiles and cut the cumin in half. Otherwise, I followed it to a tee.

There were a number of things I didn't love.  First, it was quite a lot of work for burritos, which are usually quite easy, and I found that with the number of ingredients, it actually got quite expensive to make.  Also, I didn't like the number of canned items in this recipe - I feel like when we make tacos or burritos, it's usually pretty wholesome, but this recipe felt very "processed."

The lettuce got kind of wilty being in the microwave, and the green onions were really overpowering.  It's also tough to serve everyone at the same time because these have to be finished one-by-one in the microwave.

All in all, I'd stick with seasoned ground meat and refried beans in a tortillas, topped with a good salsa and cheese, put in the oven for 20 minutes or so (our family's version of wet burritos) -- cheaper, healthier, and less work!

Thank you for the recipe!

I thought I had remembered everything I needed when I went to the store but i forgot beanless chili. Instead I added 4 oz of regular chili and added a little chili powder to the sauce. I made my husband two huge burritos and I was surprised when he actually finished both of them. Will definitely be making these again

Thank you so much for this recipe. I am only 44, but because of a pituitary tumor, I had to have all of my teeth surgically removed 6 weeks ago.  This is the first delicious thing I have been able to eat. My husband made it for me and when I tasted it I almost cried.  I had to substitute the tomato soup with more enchilada sauce because I couldn't find one without MSG which gives me terrible migraines.  Otherwise, I would have followed it exactly.  This is our new favorite food and will always remind me of the day I didn't have to eat mashed potatoes anymore! God bless you!

We made these exactly per the recipe. They were better than our local Mexican-style restaurant. They make great leftovers since you make the burritos as you go. The only change I would make would be to put the cheese inside of the burrito, since it slips off with all of the sauce. Thanks for the recipe!

WOWWOWWOWW! Absolutely amazing! Best burrito recipe we've ever had! Better than the restaurants! The hubby and myself were pleasantly surprised on how easy they were to make, and how perfect these were. I have to admit, I was quite skeptical considering some the ingredients that didn't sound too great... but we were absolutely shocked when we tasted how wonderful they turned out!! One tip... MAKE THESE USING THE INGREDIENTS LISTED... there is no need to alter them because we could tell that the ingredients listed marry together very very well, and there were no changes needed! The only difference with ours tonight was that we didn't have a can of Hormel chili without beans like we thought we did, so we made the sauce without it. However, we didn't need it at all...the sauce was great just with the tomato soup & enchilada sauce mixture...you cannot taste the soup, it just enhances the enchilada sauce to make it a little thicker and nicer for burritos. We also added a little of the Mexican cheese & tomatoes both inside and also outside as directed after pouring sauce over them. This is definitely one of our better recipes we've ever gotten from this website, and we will make it over and over again!! Amazing recipe, kudos to whomever submitted it! This recipe ROCKS!! 5-stars all the way - both in terrific flavor, and how easy it is to make them. Other great thing is that we usually have all the ingredients in the house!

Loved it!!  I added some mild hot sauce to zest it up a little.  I read a few other people omitted the tomato soup - I may try that next time since there is soooo much left over sauce.

I think it was the sauce that I didn't like. It seemed too tangy and not spicy and deep enough. IF I were to make this again I would leave out the tomato soup. EDIT- Day 2: my husband loved these and I ate part of one today. Leftovers were pretty good.

Wonderful, versatile recipe!  I heated them all together in the oven before putting the lettuce and tomatoes on. This has been a "keeper" recipe since the first time I made it.

this recipe is very good. I omitted the tomato soup like others suggested, added cilantro to the mixture and baked until cheese was gooey. I served it over a bed of shredded lettuce instead of putting lettuce in the burrito. Even the pickiest of my four kids loved it. Next time I will make some fresh guacamole to go with it.

Wickedly awesome and easy to make - I also dropped the tomatoe soup like some other reviewer had done as found it gave more kick, chilli with beans was fine and when spooning the filling into the tortilla, also added couple spoons of chunky salsa which added a nice flavour. We bake ours in the oven for about 15 minutes which brings it all together nicely. This has become a regular now in our home.

These are quite good for a burrito made at home (I don't think I'll ever make one as delicious as the ones we get at our favorite Mexican restaurant).  I've been making these for awhile, and for the first time last night, I omitted the tomato soup, and doubled the enchilada sauce instead. They were even better!  I was looking for a more meaty taste to the sauce, I suppose.  I also added 2 tsp. cumin and 1 tsp. garlic powder to this sauce (we like flavorful dishes) and this has been our best wet burrito yet! Like others, I bake these at 350* until the cheese melts, 10 mins. or so, then broil on High for two minutes.

You know it's a good recipe when your hubby immediately goes, "mmmmm" into the first bite!!! It reminded us of a chili cheese burrito from Taco Bell, which is our favorite!! I didn't use the tomato soup and it was still nice and saucy. I also added chili powder and omitted the salt. I baked it in the oven at 350° for 15 min, then served on lettuce. This WILL be a regular for the family meal rotation!!

Loved it, I thought the tomato soup was a great idea!  I don't know why the one individual is claiming it isn't authentic Mexican?!?!  It doesn't have to be, in order, to taste good.  It was delicious!

I'm feeling very proud of myself. My hubby is the chef in our family, and I'm very hesitant about trying new things (I don't mind eating new things, but preparing them??? LOL). We both loved it.

This was one of the best burrito recipes I have ever tried. The topping sounds strange but is PERFECT. I wanted to bake them in the oven so I Didn't add the Lettuce and tomato, I put it on the side to serve when done. Everyone that has tried them LOVES them, Those that post negative reviews don't know what they are talking about. Thank you for a great recipe that I will make forever.

I would leave the refried beans on the side.  You could use some of the chili inside with the beef, onions, and peppers or you could add some tomato paste and leave the juices from cooking the beef and discard the chili. I would leave the tomato soup for this winter and use the enchilada sauce on the outside with some grated cheese. Save lettuce, tomatoes, and green onions for outside when the enchiladas have been cooked. Gets you closer to authentic but not all the way there.

This was a very good recipe for wet burritos. If it does not have full Mexican flavor, so what! If you have ever been to Germany and had a McDonalds pork rib sandwich you will know they are not like here. Just enjoy the flavor the way it is or change it to your liking. I like it the way it is.

Very yummy, my husband said it was like "Taco Boy" which is high praise. I melted the cheese in the microwave then put lettuce, tomato, sour cream on the side. Kids liked it dry with meat and cheese inside and sour cream to dip.

This is one of my husband's top 3 favorite meals. I had a lot of extra sauce the first time I made them, so I froze what was left over and it turned out to be just enough for the next time. Yes, it does taste like it's from a can, but it's better than the sum of its parts! Thank you for an easy weeknight recipe!

I made this EXACTLY as written, and they were very very good!  At first I wanted to skip the Tomato Soup, but my son said he'd prefer it to too much Enchilada Sauce, then I remembered my hubby LOVES tomato soup, so I figured I'd try it.  It was great!  See my pictures, I fit 6 burritos perfectly into my larger 9.5" x 15" glass baking dish.  I opted to bake it in the oven for 10 minutes at 350, and I let each person add their own lettuce and tomatoes when the dish came out of the oven.  Everyone loved it!

This is a great recipe!  I am from MI and moved to OK.  I told so many people about Wet Burritos and finally figured out it must be regional.  There are many variations of this recipe and you can make it any way you like.  Don't rate it if you change it and don't like what you've done.  However feel free to alter to taste and enjoy the wonders of all the melded flavors..  thank you so much Sydney6 for sharing such a fun tasty recipe!

This recipe is amazing I have made it for me and my fiancé twice now and we really enjoy it never fails, only difference that we do is instead of all red enchilada sauce we also use tomatillo sauce on half and red sauce on the other half and also instead of zapping it in the microwave we pre-heat oven to 350 and bake for 20-25 minutes it makes them a little more crispy when they are done in the oven other than that great recipe !!!!!

My family and I enjoyed this recipe very much! I did make some changes. I like my own enchilada sauce better than store bought brands. I also did not like the tomato soup after I had it mixed in; so I added more chili powder, oregano, and cumin to help counteract that taste. Next time, I just might add a couple Tbsp. of heavy cream, instead. Overall, this is a very good recipe and I'm glad we tried it.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was great!  My husband loves Mexican, but I'm a pickier eater, and we both loved it. It does make a lot more sauce than we needed, but it was all easy and delicious :). I served it with cilantro lime rice, which was perfect with it!

Awesome recipe!  Each time I make these they're a hit. My kids love these, my husband loves them and whoever else joins us always does too. These are easy to make and oh so good!  Thanks for the recipe!

I've been eyeing this recipe for a while now, I'm so glad I finally gave it a chance. I read a good handful of reviews an decided to omit the tomato soup as suggested. Other then that I followed the recipe as far as ingredients go. I did though however cook the onion and garlic a little before adding the ground beef to cook with it. This recipe was delicious, thanks for sharing! :)

I made this a couple of months ago - served it for company - we loved it.  Having read some of the reviews I omitted the tomato soup.  I want to make it again but I want to do a "make ahead" so I am not putting it all together at the last minute.  I saw one reviewer that said they did this - there may have been others but I only saw one.  My concern is whether this will make them soggy???  Can someone respond to this please.

I guess being that I am not Hispanic, I don't know "beans" about burritos. Maybe ignorance is bliss, because my husband and I loved them. I did not change a thing. I liked the tomato flavor the soup gave. So I guess to each his own. Five stars from me.  Made these again tonight, 4 years later, and my hubby still thinks they are great. I am not from out East either as someone suggested. I know what a good burrito tastes like as we have plenty of Mexican restaurants here. There is a lot of sauce. If one doubles this make sure you have 12 tortillas as it will fill that many and more than enough sauce.  I also filled mine, placed them in a casserole dish and baked them. I placed the cheese on just before I removed them from the oven.

My first burritos and they tasted fabulous. Very pleased with the result. Did not use tomato sauce. I cut down quantity of green chiles because I was leery of it being too hot for me. My sweetheart loves the heat but I am more of a wimp. I changed the way I put them together as some reviewers had done. Put a little bit of cheese in with the meat mixture  when putting together the burritos. Put them in a baking dish, liberally spooned sauce over all, sprinkled cheese on top, and heated through in 350° oven for about 20 minutes.  Served the shredded lettuce, chopped fresh tomato, sliced black olives, and sour cream separately at the table. Oh - and extra hot jalapenos for my heat lover.  They were, as I said, delicious - and easy to make too. Will definitely fix again.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.

These were soooooooo yummy.  I didn't have tomato soup or chili, so I just used enchilada sauce.  This was so quick and easy.  Will be making this on a regular basis from now on!

I agree with the person who wrote the recipe. Don't change the recipe, then give a bad review, that's just stupidity. Anyway, iv made this recipe 3 times now and love it.  The last two times I made it, I made my own homemade enchilada sauce. Regardless, iv very thankful for a yummy recipe the whole fam can enjoy.

I LOVE this recipe.  I do just one thing differently in that I put some of the sauce on the bottom of a glass 13 by 9 baking dish and then roll up the tortillas and place them in the dish.  I then cover them completely with the rest of the sauce and sprinkle whatever cheese I have left as I put some inside the tortilla as well.  I then bake them for 10-15 minutes in a 350 degree oven instead of doing them one at a time in the microwave.  Delish!

I have to say that I took both recipe's here on all recipes, and added and omitted to combine both,  Then just a little of my own flare, ;) for the sauce,  I did leave the tomato soup out, put the chili no beans in, canned tomatoes with garlic and onion diced, enchilada sauce, and the brown gravy, I doubled it so I had alot of sauce,  for the meat, 2 pds, I did top sirloin so as not to be fatty, took 4 large garlic cloves cut them up, a white sweet onion about a 1/2 cup simmered until just brown,  I added  taco seasoning two packets, then let sit while I made the sauce to simmer.  When I wrapped the burritos, I did add the cheese, sour cream, fresh tomatoes , beans, chiles if desired for those who wanted them. and meat.  I then rolled and put more cheese, tomatoes, sour cream, black olives and lots of sauce on top, tucking them all up close and neat next to each other... covered with foil and cooked at 350 for 45 minutes..... I have to say Yum Yum......  I know I altered it but I am from California,,,,, oh yes I did put in the cumin!!!!! My husband loves spicy my kids don't, so he had a little scotch bonnet over the top.  AND don't forget the fresh Cilantro!!!!   Kudo's for SYNDEY6 ,, sorry if this is confusing to understand late night!

This recipe gets extra points because it is the only recipe that my brother has ever requested I make.  He usually doesn't have much of opinion on what I serve when he comes over, but he's requested this again and again.  That may not sound like a big deal... but if you knew my brother you would know that it is :)

I did follow some of the changes that others suggested (eliminated tomato soup especially just because that sounded nasty) and I will add fresh ingredients that mesh well with these flavors if I have them on hand.  Great starting point.

Just as described and very tasty. I used chicken and cooked the chicken in the crockpot which made it easy to shred.

Hey this recipe is amazing, despite all the white people crying about 'authentic' 'Mexican' food, my family is from South America and we all thought it was amazing.  Follow the recipe and you are in for a great treat.

I don't know why anyone would take stars off for this not being "authentic". I did not see "authentic Mexican" listed anywhere in this recipe.The only place I've even seen wet burritos was in Michigan, and that's a little above the border if you haven't noticed. We've Americanized a bunch of other cultures' foods with delicious results, so it doesn't mean this isn't a great burrito dish. 

Anyway, this was so delicious and easy to make! I did make some small changes that were recommended by some reviewers - no tomato soup and double the enchilada sauce to make the burrito sauce, increased some of the meat seasoning, and baked all the burritos with the sauce and cheese at 350 for about 15 minutes. My husband thought it was amazing. While it's a little too heavy to go into the regular rotation, I will be making this again!

WE loved these! I used ground elk, home canned salsa for the tomato soup, and 15oz. enchilada sauce. I put a handful of cheese on top of the meat before rolling up. Placed them into a 9x13 greased pan, poured the sauce mixture on top to cover completely, then sprinkled with some cheese. I baked them about 20 minutes. We like lettuce, tomato and avocado on top of ours.

The chili covered burrito was one of my favorites at a place I used to go so I had to try this. We absolutely loved it. My grown son said it was better than anything he'd ever eaten at any Mexican restaurant! I followed the recipe exactly as written except I put the lettuce & tomato on the plate after heating the sauce covered burrito with cheese in the microwave. Also added a dollop of sour cream. Everyone loved it & I'll definitely be making it again.

Well, after reading reviews I agree that there are so many different variations to this recipe that I can't imagine how you would rate it in the first place.  If you want "authentic", why would you make this at all.  Did you read the ingredient list and directions?? I made this exactly as written and it was fine for a quick dinner.  No complaints in my house. Please, if you are going to rate a recipe make it as submitted or post your own.

This was good.  I made the recipe as is and the family liked it.  I also made a lighter version that was 1/3 less calories, 1/2 the fat by exchanging these 4 things
1) 8" wheat tortia
2) black beans for refried
3) ground turkey
4) Ro-Tel Diced tomato / green chili for chili no beans (this adds a lot of heat to the dish.

Loved this recipe!!  This is my first time posting on all recipes, but I've been cooking up a storm using all the great ideas for almost 2 years now..   We had it last nite, and I think the only thing I changed was not adding the soup, used a little cayenne pepper just because I'm a spice fiend, and baked it instead of microwaving...  Thanks so much, it was delicious!    Julie

I love most Mexican cooking inspired recipes, and this one is no exception - it's really good!  It seems, though, that a lot of reviewers are actually making some sort of Burrito/Enchilada hybrid, and that's fine as long as they don't complain about the results of THEIR recipe and attribute it to the originator.

Tastes exaactly like the Swanson Frozen TV Dinner burritos. Soft and bland with plenty of that processed tomato flavor that I crave!

I made a couple of changes - I used burrito seasoning with the meat, used a can of starter chili tomatoes (we don't have non-bean chili here) and put some homemade guacamole inside instead of lettuce. I also laid them all in a platter, topped with sauce and cheese and put it in the oven for 10 mins. It turned out amazing!!! Delicious meal!!! Thanks for the starter!!!

This was very good. I did not have any chili so I just did without and it still tasted very good. I would highly recommend broiling the cheese instead of microwaving it, it gives a much better flavor and crisps it up a little.

I will for sure make this again. I did not make burritos but layered the tortillas in the pan with the meat casserole style. For the sauce, I used rotel, chili, and tomato sauce.

I made this recipe yesterday for dinner, exactly as instructed....4 out of 4 people in this household loved them. I wouldn't do anything different. The one thing I did do however was, made the enchilada sauce from a packet, the can kind had red or green chilies in it and I didn't want it to get too hot..I like to enjoy my food not scarf it down and chase it with something to drink to cool my mouth off. The flavors melded together so nicely. I wouldn't sweat the bad reviews, putting yourself and your recipe out there is courageous and you have to realize that everyone has different tastes and you aren't going to get perfect reviews from everyone, be happy that you got so many good ones! I will definitely be making this again. Thanks!

My whole family loves this dish. It has the most perfect flavor. It is neither too spicy nor too mild. We do have a slight change, instead of tomato soup, we use enchilada sauce. I would recommend this dish to everyone.

The burrito I made came out looking restaurant quality! I changed a few things, added some habanero hot sauce to the meat mixture, added some guacamole, and used ground chicken instead of ground beef, and it came out just great! Definitely something I'm going to make to impress the girlfriend, because it tastes great but looks fabulous topped with the sauce and melted cheese, didn't think it would come out looking so good when i threw it in the mic to melt the cheese, thanks!

These burritos are so delicious, but so terribly bad for you. At first I thought the sauce would be too tomato-y, but it really does blend nicely. Also, if there's any leftover filling, it makes for great chip dip when mixed with salsa, or cheese, or just about anything, really.

These were absolutely great!! I do have to confess that I didn't use the tomato soup but used a can of Spartan Mexican tomatoes in its place and also, because I don't care for cumin, I used 1 TBLS of chili powder in its place. My husband thought they were the best he'd eaten in a long, long time. Will definately be making these again soon and not waiting for next year's Cinco de Mayo!!

I was leery of this recipe because of all the canned ingredients, especially the canned chili. But the finished product didn't have a "can" taste and was actually pretty good. I did add more spice to the meat as I like spicy/hot food. But this is a very good base recipe... Next time I will add things like peppers, mushrooms, black beans, corn, tomatoes to the filling.

Thank you for an excellent wet burrito recipe!  I have a young family (1 year old and 3 year old) who can't do as much spice as this recipe, so to tame it down I put only 1/2 the green chile peppers and cumin that it calls for.  With this minor change it is perfect for our whole family and it's devoured in no time!

This the first time I have made this recipe so I made it exactly as written, and it was really good. Next time I make them,and yes there will be a next time, I will add more spice to the hamburger mixture and raw onions and cheese inside the burritos,just because of personal preference.Thanks for a new quick weeknight meal.

YUM!!  Only change was that we didn't have the tomato soup and subbed 8oz tomato sauce w/ 1/4c. water.  Served with the Lime Cilantro Rice recipe off this site with a side of guac.

The only thing I changed was to add jalepenos and a little chili powder (i like spicy) and used a green chili to top it, rather then the red one here.  I have to say these burritos were one of the best burritos I've made at home with ground beef and I'm mexican.  My whole family devoured them and already told me they want this on our regular menu.  Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious! I did make my own enchilada sauce. I added brown rice to the meat mix. I omitted lettuce & tomatoes. Once warmed, I added dollops of guacamole & sour cream

Yummy!! We loved these and will make again. I didn't use the soup and used 2 cans of enchilada sauce instead. Only other thing I did different was to make all the burritos and put them in a casserole dish. I then poured the sauce over them and added cheese to the top and baked them for 10 or 15 mintues at 350.

These are fantastic burritos, and one of my husband's favorite things for me to make - and he's the pickiest eater I know! I generally follow the recipe for the most part, and I serve tortilla chips and fresh, home-made green salsa as an appetizer beforehand. Makes for a great tex-mex dish that my husband raves to everyone about and that he says tastes even better the next day after the flavors have come together in the fridge.
It makes huge burritos! It's only my husband and me so there's always leftovers and I can never finish a whole one but they're very good!

I made these for my family, but had to do so when they weren't home so they would not know what all was in them.  Had my son seen me making them he probably would not have eaten them.   My husband and son both loved them!  Thanks for sharing.

This was pretty good. The tomato soup makes the sauce a tad sweet for my taste, but it is still a keeper.

My husband loved this which makes it five stars for me! I enjoyed it as well but for the first time since we married he actually finished his plate before me and informed me that it was "probably the best burrito I've ever had." This won't be something we eat often only because it isn't the healthiest thing out there but we will certainly be having it in place of a run to the local taco bell. Thank you!

Husband says these are his favorite.. Used can of Rotel instead to tomato soup...put a tiny bit of shredded cheese on tortillas before putting meat mixture on.  Placed in glass baking pan, pour sauce over- a bit of cheese and baked at 350 for 30 min..will look for low sodium ingriendents for the next time...btw- this was super reheated for leftovers.

So that's how they do it!!! You could thin the sauce a little. I did not have the chili and my crew will only eat ground turkey anyway and it was still delicious, like going out!  I threw in some corn to stretch it a bit. popped a beer and voila!

I followed the recipe to a "T"... I did have reservations about the tomato soup but went ahead and did exactly as the recipe called for. The burritos were absolutely delicious! My husband, the picky eater, even gave me a rare 2 thumbs up compliment. Being from CA I'm definately spoiled by good Mexican food and this recipe did not disappoint.

Thank you, Sydney for this awesome recipe!  I use a rotisserie chicken instead of the ground beef, but wouldn't change a thing!  It is a little "putzy" to make, but well worth it.  The last time I served these, my guests told me they were "restaurant quality!"  Definitely worth the effort...delicious!

Really good. For some reason I was expecting more of a kick. These were very mild, very child friendly. I think next time Ill sub the tomato soup for salsa to kick it up a bit. Used ground turkey and turkey chili. Will make again!

I thought it was really tasty!  To fit my tastebuds I used spicy beans and a can of rotel intstead of the tomatoe sauce.  Next time I think I will just use a can of chilli sauce, instead of actual chilli.  I didn't like the mixing of the fresh made hamburger with the canned stuff.  Also, I baked mine at 350 for about 30 minutes.

Great Recipe!  I did what others recommended and poured sauce over the burritos and then baked on 350 for 25 minutes.  I did tweek by adding Mexican blend cheese inside the burritos right before I wrapped them up to bake them.  It was yummy, cheesy, deliciousness!
Will definitely make this one again!

FABULOUS! Made this tonight for the first time and it was amazing. My husband and I loved it. Only changes I made were minimal. First, I used a taco seasoning packet rather than the cumin, salt, pepper. I also bought a box of mexican rice that I was going to serve as a side, but decided to put it in. So I cooked the rice according to the directions, and then I stirred it in with the meat before filling the burritos. AMAZING! The rice was really good. I also followed others advice, and baked them for a few minutes for the cheese to melt, rather than microwave. AMAZING recipe, so glad I came across it!

I had never heard of a wet Burrito before. But the picture looked so yummy. I decided "what the heck" I will give it a try. I followed the recipe to a tee, except for the tomato soup.  I forgot to get some, but my chili and sauce looked really sloppy allready. It turned out to be excellent. I had people over and they couldnt believe how yummy it was. Very filling! I piled everything in a 9x13 pan and through it in the oven for a minute or at least till the cheese was melted. I topped with the leftover lettuce, tomatoes, onions. Dolliped sour cream and salsa. Great recipe. YUMMY.

This recipe is a hit with my family. The only change I made was to use the rotel instead of the tomato soup and I baked them for 30 minutes at 350. My daughter said I had to make this agian SOON. As stated by others it is easy and delicious.

These were so good, I felt like I was dining at a local Mexican restaurant.  I used the recipe "10 minute enchilada sauce" since I discovered halfway through I did not have any canned.  I also used Skyline chili, since we live in Cincinnati.  Wonderful!  I was skeptical of putting the lettuce and tomato inside the burrito then reheating to melt the cheese, but they were great.  My son wants them again tonight!

I took reviewers advice and left out the tomato soup, I'm so glad I did, it was EXCELLENT and not canned tasting.  I only had 4 tortillas on hand and this easily makes 4 large burritos.  I put it in a baking dish with (warmed sauce) on bottom and a large drizzle of sauce down the middle of the burritos.  I did not cover the whole burrito for presentation purposes, so I had some left over.  I forgot to put the tomatoes in the burrito, so I microwaved them for 15 secs and garnished the top of my dish with tomatoes and green onions after it baked.  I skipped the lettuce & salsa, but sour cream is a must. The look and taste of this dish is perfection.  There was no canned taste at all.

Delicious and so easy to make!  I did change it a bit by putting the bean mix in the tortillas, placing the stuffed tortillas in a 9 x 13 pan, pouring the sauce over them, sprinkling on the cheese and baking at 350 degrees for about 20 mintues.

Hubby And kid approved.  I made a few substitutions based on others comments & my own taste buds.  I did bake them as others suggested.  Overall, very well received at our dinner table.

Does anyone remember the Havana Inn restaurant in Denver, Colorado and their fabulous "TacoBurritos"?  This was the best ever - somewhat like this fabulous wet burrito only better.

Had to work with what I had on hand while snowed in here in CT but even with substitutions, my family loved this! Did not have tomato soup, canned chili or enchilada sauce so I browned ground beef with garlic and onion, seasoned with salt, pepper, cumin and a little oregano after draining fat. I added green chilies and refried beans to beef mix and then added 1 can of rotels because the mixture was a little stiff. Scooped mixture and cheddar jack into tortillas and placed rolled burritos in a 13x9. For lack of sauce ingredients, I ended up pouring a jar of medium picante over the whole pan, topping with more cheese and baking at 350 for about 20 min. Served as suggested with sour cream, lettuce and tomato and it was devoured. Will keep this one on rotation! Thanks Sydney...

OMG! These were the best burritos that I have ever had. My husband asked me to make them for dinner the next night so he could invite his parents over. The only thing I did different was to place them in a baking dish and put then in the oven for about 5 minutes.

Although I made some changes, these burritos are delicious! I made the filling the same way but instead of the tomato soup and chilli, I just poured green enchilada sauce on top and sprinkled with cheese and then baked for 20 minutes... they were so yummy!!

This recipe gets 5 stars because my entire family loved it - even those who had initally said that the name  doesn't sound so good!  Even the last 2 picky eaters.  Definately better the next day.  Not a true mexican dish (especially with canned tomato soup) but very good.  I followed exactly except for the tomato soup - didn't add it because my enchilada sauce was a very large jar.  Will be making this again!

This was great did not change anything.  My family of 5 loved it.  I made 2 8x8 pans one with corn tortillas and one with flour.  They both got completely eaten.  My kids had it for lunch wanted more so then dinner and they wanted it again.

Wow! This recipe is amazing! So worth the title of Fabulous! I was skeptical about using tomato soup. But, went with the reviews and made it. My youngest daughter and husband thought they were great. They are even better the next day! Only difference I did was threw them in the oven instead of microwave. Will totally make this again!

This was a great basic wet burrito recipe. It tasted very good as directed above, and provides an excellent base for future experimentation.   Beware of what enchilada sauce you use. While I LOVE spicy food, the brand I used created a sauce that was much too spicy for my taste. I was quite glad the tomato soup was included. Choose your enchilada sauce carefully!

These had more of an enchilada taste instead of what I think of when I hear 'wet burrito'.  I didn't care for it that much.  I like enchiladas, but microwaving them didn't really add to the appeal any.

This sounded very good, but my family and I just didn't like it at all. We are in TX and have authentic tex mex here so maybe that is why. Maybe it was the brand of enchilada sauce I used. I don't know it just wasn't good. Had tons of leftovers that went to waste and had to make the kids something else to eat entirely.

These were really tasty, with a couple of adjustments. I used salsa instead of tomato soup and would suggest using more meat than called for.

This is a great recipe, thank you SYDNEY6 for sharing! I substituted salsa for the tomato soup, and a mix of jalapeno and banana peppers for the chilis. Other than that went by the book. Baked the finished product for 20 minutes on 350, topped with sour cream and a slice of jalapeno. My husband loved that, unlike the burritos we usually have, he doesn't have to worry about these falling apart when you pick them up. This is a nice change from our usual burrito dinner.

I have made this twice now.  (Didn't use green onion because they are still frozen, and I couldn't wait til spring to try this recipe.)  I browned the beef with 1/2 cup chopped sweet onion.  Added uncooked sweet onion to each burrito (we love onions).  Loaded everything inside the burrito, topped with sauce and more cheese.  Reheated in oven.  Excellent recipe.  Thank you.

Made this last night and it totally hit the spot!  It is a perfect substitute for a restaurant style burrito, but at home.  YUMMY!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I bake the burritos at the end to melt the cheese.  Thanks for sharing!

Instead of using the microwave, what I did was roll up my burritos and placed them in a 9x13 in baking dish, poured the tomato mixture, and cheese over the burritos and place them in the oven until the cheese melted.  (I also added sour cream, inside the burritos)

Fabulous is correct! I did take the advice of others and change a few things, nothing major, just adjusting seasonings to taste preferences, baking in the oven rather than microwaving. I probably cook atleast 2 receipes from this site every week and this is in my top 3. Delicious. Better than any restaurant I've been to. THANK YOU!

Really good recipe.  I did use the chili for the topping, only the enchilada sauce and tomato soup.  The more tomato soup I added, the less I like it.  Next time, I will just use 1 can of Old El Paso Enchilada Sauce (medium) to make my burrito wet and skip the tomato soup.  Also, I used homemade refried beans, which are always better if you can make them.  Other than that, this is a keeper!  4 stars from me!!!

I increased the filling and baked these.  They were very good and we loved the sauce.  Baking them made the tortillas a little gummy, so next time I will microwave as instructed.

Loved this recipe, I added some more hot spices and followed another reviewers suggestion and poured sauce on top of burritos and baked for about 20 minutes.  10 minutes into cooking I added the cheddar.

I was excited to try this -picture looks great and it sounded good.  My husband said this was 'ok' but I didn't care for it all.  The filling was too pasty and almost had a gritty quality - and the sauce smelled like tomato soup. Even though I accidentally picked up the 'hot' enchilada sauce, somehow mixed with the chili and tomato soup I kept getting a 'sweet' taste that I didn't like. Sorry, won't be trying this again.

This is awesome!! However, I totally agree w/Sydney6 and others as to WHY people insist on changing the recipe then give the original recipe a low rating.  It seems unfair and unreasonable.

This was a huge hit here. I used dried minced onion, 1 Hatch chile pepper diced, instead of the canned, and homemade chile gravy sauce from the "tex-mex beef and cheese enchiladas" recipe instead of making this sauce since I don't keep canned chili or enchilada sauce in the house. This was really quick and easy and my husband is looking forward to what little leftovers there were for his lunch tomorrow. Thanks, he said please make this one again, and SOON! He wants me to serve this over the holidays when family is here, it's that good. I would have given 5 stars, but since I used homemade sauce instead of the recipe that wouldn't be fair and accurate, but it was worth 5 plus stars the way mine turned out. Judging from the high ratings and small changes lots of reviewers made, I'd say this recipe is a winner for it's versatility and adaptablity to any cook and kitchen. So... many thanks!

This recipe is very good! I didn't have a can of enchilada sauce so I used an extra can of tomato soup and added more cumin, paprika, and chili powder. It tasted fantastic!

The name says it all! These really were fabulous! I did take the advice of other and omitted the tomato soup. I used the canned chili and enchilada sauce called for, and then I added some bottled taco sauce to the topping since I didn't have another can of enchilada sauce. I made these up with the shredded cheddar added to each burrito, put them in a pan, covered with the sauce and baked at 375 degrees for about 35min. Again- you have to try this recipe- its fantastic!!!

This recipe was just like the name states FABULOUS!!  Tonight was my first time making it and it turned out perfectly.  I did not change a thing, even though I noticed a lot of people said not to use the tomato soup.  I think the suggestions to this recipe are not needed at all.  This is a quick and easy meal that seems like you spent a few hours making.  I’m not sure why some would say to bake it because I have never seen a baked burrito in my life.  I will be making this recipe again for sure.  Thanks for sharing this with us.

SYDNEY6, You've been put on my COOKS I LIKE list. This recipe has the flavor that I've been looking for since 1989 when I first fell in love with the Burrito Grande at TACO DEL SOL and I have never been able to duplicate the recipe. Thanks so much for sharing this. I did not change a single thing, but followed the recipe exactly as you wrote it out. I don't know why other cooks omited the tomato soup. I can't imagine the recipe without it. The sauce was perfect. ~~~ Of course, you must know that I will be watching for more of your recipes to try because I will know that if you like it, it is bound to be delicious!

Not sure why Michigan has been mentioned all the time with this recipe, since I'm from Michigan too. My kids really liked this.  I omitted the tomato soup and used 1 cup of salsa as others said.  This was easy to make, a lot of pans and dishes, but good.

I am very picky when it comes to Mexican food, but this...was THE BEST!  LOVED IT!  My boyfriend loved it.  I didn't use chili though and I used green and red enchilada sauce.  I will make this again and again!  Thanks Sydney!

These were very good!  I made them exactly as written except that I used black beans instead of refried beans.  The only change I would make would be to add more cheese to them.

3.5 Stars.  Omitted the individual spices and used Penzey's Chicken Taco.  Only half the can of FF refried beans (had to sneak those in!) Skipped the tomato soup, and just subbed in a can of drained Rotel.  I admit, I was terribly nervous about the Chili / Enchilada sauce mix, but it wasn't too bad - though I'd prefer just regular enchilada sauce.  Topped with Reduced Fat Mexican Cheese, FF Sour Cream, and about a million jalapenos.

Delicious! Absolutely restaurant quality. Best of all, the recipe is quite forgiving and accommodating, allowing for personal taste preferences and availability of ingredients. For instance, I didn't have enchilada sauce, so used taco sauce. I didn't have refried beans or green chiles, so left them out. I didn't have Mexican-blend cheese, so used mozzarella and a little cheddar. I don't like canned tomato soup, so used canned diced tomatoes. I also spiced up the beef with an envelope of taco mix, in addition to the spices in the recipe. And, thanks to previous reviews, I put them in a 9-by-11 glass baking dish and baked at 350 for 20 minutes. Perfect!! I topped with a dollop of sour cream and used simple diced lettuce and tomato on the side. I made six fat ones and my husband and I ate them all at one sitting. This is a keeper!

This was delicious!! Everyone that had them loved them! Pretty easy to make as well. It made 8 when I made them and they were pretty stuffed. I also put them all in a baking dish and covered them with sauce and cheese and stuck them in the oven so they were all ready at the same time

I made this with a few changes per other reviews... omitted the tomato soup and used a can of rotel in the sauce mixed with the enchilada sauce and chili with no beans.  I also baked in the oven for 10 minutes with cheese on top, then added lettuce and sour cream just before serving.  Absolutely delicious!!  My whole family raved and I will definitely make this again.

These are fantabulous! My first venture at makine mexican. I'm just learning (at 40) to get into cooking more. I alway found it a hassle and not fun until recently. These were fun to make and a huge hit! We upped the garlic, onion, and instead of black pepper I used cayenne. Great food.

Loved these!  The filling was awesome and I'll probably make that from now on as my filling for regular burritos!

This is a good recipe and easy to make.  A lot of the reviewers are saying they used tomatoe sauce, but the recipe calls for tomatoe soup- either way I didn't use either.  I used a can of green enchilado sauce instead (28oz) I probably could have gotten by with the smaller can.  I also subbed black beans for refried just a personal perference.  Other than that I kept it all the same.  My kids enjoyed it and it was a good way to use ground beef.  It also came together very fast.  I also skipped the nuking and put it in the oven until the cheese melted and the sauce was bubbling.  Thanks for sharing.

Update.  We have made these several times and I still look forward to it when I know that is what we are having for dinner.  I even look forward to the left overs.  Tonight we tried something a little differnt with this.  We made everything exactly as is but we didnt roll up the burritos.  We deceided to make this into a lasagna dish.  It was just as good as the rolled up version.  Thanks for the EXCELLENT recipe.  Ive been looking for a good wet burrito recipe for a while.  We tried these and we were very impressed. Much better than expected.

I made these and changed the recipe a little. I skipped the canned chili and tomato soup and used two cans of red enchilada sauce and one can of green enchilada sauce. I also baked them instead of microwaving. They turned out REALLY good. My husband (who usually comes poking around for seconds and thirds) was FULL after the first one. He was happy there were left overs to take for lunch the next day. I stuffed them full of the filling (that I added some chopped cilantro to) and topped with the sauces and cheese before baking covered at 350. After about twenty minutes (when the cheese was melted) I took them out, garnished with sour cream, tomatos, and a little lettuce. I will definetly make these again.

made a few modifications as everyone had mentioned. I used two 10 oz cans of enchilada sauce instead of tomato sauce.  I also used Chiwauwa cheese (for quesadillas) as well as cheddar cheese. My family loved it. By the time I wanted leftovers the next day, someone already beat me to it!  Will definitely make again!

Very presentable, but not an unforgetable dish. Has lots of potential, with a few tweaks here and there for more flavor.

I actually converted this recipe to nachos! I grated about 4 cups of cheddar and monterey jack and sprinkled heavily over two platters of chips and put in 350 over for about 10 min to melt cheese, piled meat (without refried beans) on top, added tomatoes more cheese and sour cream and guacamole on the side. It was really yummy. Next time I would have added less enchilada sauce, more chili with no beans and taco sauce to make it less enchilada tasting.

Filling was great. Sauce was good, but a little too much tomato taste. We like spicy, so I used spicy fat free refried beans & spicy chili. I also used tortillas with no hydrogenated oils to make just a tad healthier. Will make this again. Husband liked it.

really delicious.  my husband LOVED these.  I was able to sneak in some 'healthier' things that normally would get pushed aside.  i used spinach instead of lettuce, whole wheat tortillas, and 92% lean ground beef.  I added some of the sauce directly to the bean/beef mixture b/c mine was slightly dry (due to lean ground beef?).  I baked in casserole dish as other reviewers did.

Excellent!  The whole family enjoyed these even my 7 and 4 year olds.  My husband said to only use this recipe from now on.  I also substituted the salsa for the tomato soup (I didn't have any at the time) and it was delicious.  Thanks for the recipe!

These burritos were fabulous! The only thing we changed was we added 1 small can of chopped olives to the meat mixture and put cheese inside the burritos as well as on top. Next time we make this we're going to add taco seasoning to the meat mixture for some more flavor. We will definitely be making these again! Thanks for sharing!

I made this the other night and it was delicious. I followed the recipe also putting a small amount of cheese inside each burrito. I covered the bottom of the baking dish lightly with the sauce and put more sauce on top of the burritos. I baked them at 350º for 20 minutes, then put some Mexican cheese blend on top and baked on 200º for about 10 minutes more. Chopped lettuce, onion and spooned on some salsa with a squeeze of lime juice for a salad. Served with rice. It surprised me how good they turned out. Individually added hot sauce.

This is kind of odd. Not spicy, but actually rather bland. We baked ours at 250 to melt the cheese and warm the sauce.

These were so good.  I followed other reviewers advice and only added half a can of tomato soup.  I also added 1/4 teaspoon of crushed red pepper for some extra spice.  I put in a 9x13 pan and baked at 350 until cheese was melted.

I was impressed with this recipe!  My family loves tex-mex, but most recipes I try are too bland for us.

I admit that I still added extra cumin, garlic, and onion, because I have to "doctor up" everything, and I too used only 1/2 can of refried beans.  I used "Hot" tobasco canned chili to extra zip and the whole family loved this.  It's going in my recipe book.

These burritos were really good. I made them for my parents and they were a hit. Next time I will make more ground beef mixture because it seemed like there wasn't enough for the amount of red sauce and other toppings.

Delicious! The whole family loved these. The sauce is especially good... I was amazed that a combination of chili, tomato soup and enchilada sauce would taste so great. I'll definitely be making these again... thanks for a keeper!

These were better than any of my other burrito recipes.  I did have much more sauce than I needed.  I coated the bottom of my pan with about 1 cp. of sauce before putting the tortillas in and still had plenty of sauce to freeze.

My fiance and I loved this recipe!  The only change I will make for next time is to only use about 10 oz of the chili and use red pepper instead of black to make it more spicy.  Great recipe!

I was looking for something quick & something different to make for dinner & this really does fit the bill. I tried it out on my family who just loved it & I've been informed by my family that they would like it on a regular basis.
So thank you Sydney 6 for making my life a little easier.

I was unsure when I read the ingredients since I really dislike canned chili, however these were very good. I did bake six of them at 350° for about 20 minutes instead of using the microwave. They were a hit with the entire family.

I have been looking for a wet burrito recipe similar to a well known West Michigan Mexican restaurant.  This recipe did not disappoint.   I resisted the urge to modify anything and made it exactly as written.   Made a total of five good portioned burritos with 12” tortillas.  Only change was loading them into a 9x13 saucing them up coving with cheese and placing them in the oven until cheese was melted.

I made it exactly. Kids liked it.  But we are old school TEX MEX.   Adults  no likey too much. Canned refried beans are not an option versus homemade.  Yes more effort but worth it I promise. Didn't care much for the sauce.   It's costly to make and  tastes like something out of a "Chef Boyardee" can. But if you don't mind that canned taste of beans and sauce and don't mind the price making it then go for it.  FYI  plenty of  good red sauce recipes out there.  One I like is on this website in fact.  The photo is sauce in a glass skull jar.  MUCH cheaper, simpler,  and tastes better. But just matter of preference.  I made again using  this wet sauce recipe and scratch refried beans  and like much better.  Kids too. ... TIP: For better taste don't  mix beans and meat per instructions. Keep separate and layer your burritos. Put a thin to moderate layer of beans topped with a generous layer of meat.  and a TBS sauce before folding.  Include  a TBS  of green salsa  for added flavor. Mixed beans and meat has a mushy texture the beans overwhelm the meat flavor. And for sure don't over heat lettuce and tomato if  you put inside.  Wilty not good. Better to add on top after  heating I think.

Brilliant. Easy to make, excellent even reheated. What I do is make the filling and the sauce each and then combine them on a warm tortilla when it’s time to serve. Storing the filling and sauce separate from each other and the tortilla makes reheating and eating leftovers a snap, and keeps the taste perfect even a week after you first make them.

First off, excellent dish. I followed to the letter - except I put the lettuce and tomato outside. when making the sauce I thought there was going to be a lot left over, but it's the perfect amount of sauce. I chose tortillas that are made out of flour AND corn... just a taste preference. 
Will make this for family night when the fam comes for game night. Thank you

The combination of hormel chili and enchilada sauce is my new go to sauce for burritos and enchiladas.  It is thicker and milder.  Don't need the tomato soup.

I love burritos and this one is very easy to make, I rolled mine and placed all in the baking dish, poured the sauce on top baked for about 20-25 minutes, sprinkled with cheese and left in oven till cheese was well melted.  The only change I will probably make next time is to leave out the enchilada sauce or maybe only add a small amount, that's just for a personal taste of a family member.  I enjoyed this dish a lot and will definitely be making again.

I thought it was more than decent, after I kicked up the flavor with some heat. My two dogs (border collie and German Shepard) licked their plates clean.I gave some to my two neighbors and they said it was excellent. Keep in mind that they like anything that's free. My two cats gave it a sniff and then walked off. Cats are funny that way, if you know what I mean.
Overall....more than decent chow thats easy to make.

Very delicious and so easy! I followed another reviewer and did not add the tomato soup and it still turned out great. I love how simple this is to microwave each one, that way everyone can build their own.

Wow, this recipe was surprisingly tasty! I was a little skeptical of the wet sauce, but I followed others advice...used 1 can of Rotel tomatoes in place of the condensed tomato soup, used the entire 15 oz can of enchilada sauce (because what else are you going to do with the leftver 5 extra oz) and the chili w/o beans. Next time, I would put just the filling inside the tortilla, add the sauce and cheese on top, and microwave. Garnish with green onions, lettuce, tomato, guacamole, and sour cream.

I agree. I followed the directions exactly and it was absolutely awesome! I’m taking care of my elderly parents and they both loved it. I’ll be making this one again. There was also enough for leftovers which helps me out a lot.

My husband and I LOVE these burritos!  We make them A LOT!  I pretty much follow the directions except I fill the burrito with meat mixture and lots of cheese inside then put sauce on top and more cheese micro it until cheese is melted then add the lettuce tomato and sour cream. We serve it with a big handful of Tostito's and it's so yummy!  We always have leftover's for the next day!  It's not Authentic Mexican food (Go to Mexico for that)...but it's delicious!

Loved the recipe!! Made this "as is" minus the tomato soup because I forgot to buy it. My wife and kids are picky eaters and all said to make this a regular addition to the dinner rotation!

I didn't do the recipe that was listed.  Everyone's taste is different, so I know what I like in Mexican food.  I didn't put lettuce and tomato inside the burritp and I used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce.  I baked the burritos at 359 for 15 minutes.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe.  I have tried making burritos on my own, but was missing elements.  Your recipe is awesome.

Fantastic!!  We served them in cabbage leaves instead of tortilla (blanch in boiling water for 1 min) and it was great!  Also used extra filling and baked for 'dip' and ate with tortillas.  Will definitly be making again!!

This is a great and delicious recipe, and I lived in Houston, Texas growing up  , and McAllen Tx, 8 miles from the Mexican border later, and I know what Mexican Food should taste like. This recipe is very authentic, and tasty, I just used the chile con carne I had made already, and sliced up some pickled jalapenos I always have on hand.  Thank you so much for sharing this incredible recipe Cindy.  cc.

 Also, I like tex mex cheese enchiladas with chili gravy, and the gravy in this recipe is perfect for that too with an added dash of cumin, a bit of crushed garlic, a speck of Mexican oregano, and a shake of onion powder.

I love this recipe and it reheats wonderfully. It is wonderful using fresh tortillas from your grocery store bakery dept. I doubled the recipe, but only used ONE can of tomato soup...the resulting sauce is less tomato-y and very flavorful. I'm considering adding ground beef and trying this same sauce on cheese enchiladas!

We had guests over and served this. We all liked it. I put burritos in pan covered with sauce and cheese and baked until cheese melted we served lettuce, tomato, green onion, black olives and sour cream for toppings after baked.

Kids loved it. Single dad victory! Way too much sauce generated with this recipe. I would leave out the chilli next time? Seemed redundant anyway and the meat in it wasn't as good as the meat I browned myself. Needs plenty of hot sauce if you like a kick. I might try fresh jalapeno's next time.

This recipe keeps getting better. No chilli needed. Sub fresh red jalapeño and fresh scotch bonnet peppers, minced, for the canned jalapeño. Bake in oven, not microwave, 25 minutes at 375. and MakeExtra!

Very easy and tasty for a quick dinner.  I added a little cilantro seasoning and some extra cumin.  Didn't have any mexican cheese but had plenty of Colby jack, mozzarella, and sharp cheddar.  After I made the meat mixture, I topped off the burrito portion with the sauce mix, cheese, black olives and let it bake in the oven for 10 minutes @ 350.  I then placed the rest of the toppings.  The family loved it.

The only thing i did was use bigger tortillas because that's what I had on hand.
I brought them to a potluck and it was one of the first things devoured.

I did it the first time around exactly as the recipe called. The sauce was bland, almost too sweet from the tomato soup. 

The next night I made it again, only this time I used a small can tomato sauce and added 1/4 tsp cayenne and 1/4 tsp adobe powder. Much better on the flavor, more savory than sweet. 

The combination of the onion, meat, beans and chilis was great. The first night I did the hamburger, the second night I did shredded chicken thighs. Both are different flavors and very good. 

The three star rating is based on the original recipe.

Starts off with the right spices...but using so much canned 'stuff' diminishes the rich, authentic taste of a wet burrito.  It's a simple recipe for a more simple pallet.  Tomato soup and canned chili was the first warning sign, lettuce and tomato inside the tortilla the second and microwaving the third strike.

My family would love for me to make something Mexican for dinner 7 nights/week. That being said, this is one of their favorite recipes! My husband told me it was better than any burrito he has had in a restaurant (if we go out to eat, he will only go to a Mexican restaurant so he has had lots of burritos!)
The only thing I changed was using enchilada sauce instead of the tomoat soup. 
I make this recipe a lot and it is AMAZING!!!!! Thank you for sharing!

I made this last night per the video (baking in the oven) and it was fantastic.  I followed the stuffing recipe exactly.  For the sauce I added a bit of Franks Hot Sauce.  My wife went nuts for this dish.  High five for this recipe!!!!!

It's funny, but there a tiny local restaurant in my town that actually serves these exact same burritos!! Everyone in town know and lives these things, and all my friends think I'm brilliant because I can make em.. Recipe doesn't say authentic, but just because they're not authentic dosnt mean they're not amazing wonderful!! Thanks for making me look brilliant, love the recipe!!

This recipe makes waaaaay too much red sauce! And tasted too much like chili still. I had to add more enchilada sauce to counteract the chili taste (even more red sauce)... The mixture for the inside of the burritos was a bit bland. I added more salt, more cumin, green chile sauce and jalapeños to make them more flavorful. At the end of the day, the flavor still came off pretty one-note. Kinda disappointed.

I like the recipe and made a couple of changes to fit my taste. As I am not a big fan of refried beans, I only used half of the recommended and as I do like green chili's, I added at least 3/4 can more. Other than that, I did enjoy this dish.

I made this for my family of 6. 4 teenagers. everyone liked this recipe when I made it as stated. I made it again, this time substituting enchilada sauce for the tomato sauce (I thought I had tomato sauce but didn't) and everyone LOVED it then! Thank you for the recipe!

I have made this dish several times and I love it. It is one of my favorite Mexican dishes to make. I only altered it slightly once, because I didn't have a can of chili without beans. I had to use a can with beans, and it was still delicious.

Very good!  Kids even ate it without much complaining!  Didn't use the tomato sauce, used smaller tortillas, added a tiny bit of cheese inside with filling,   Used refried black beans. Cooked at 275 degrees for quite a while until we were ready to eat - and it didn't get dry.   Put the shredded lettuce in a bowl on the table.  
Thanks for the recipe!

I changed the microwave to oven 350 for 17 minutes (though keeping eye on it cause est. 15-20 minutes so I choose 17) and I just put the mixture and cheese on the inside and put the sauce and melted cheese on the top.

Made this only thing I changed was using 2 cans enchilada sauce instead of  any tomato also didn't measure seasonings I seasoned to  taste and only used half a can of refried beans. I put them in a pan topped with sauce and cheese and heated them in the oven 10-15 minutes then we garnished them with sour cream, lett, tom etc. They were yummy! Will make again!

Excellent!  These are the changes I made based only on personal preference:  black beans rather than refried, shredded chicken rather than beef, eliminated the tomato soup and added a little salsa instead.  Added grated cheddar cheese within the enchilada.  Covered the enchiladas with more cheddar, more enchilada sauce and small back olives.  Baked rather than microwaved.

It was tasteless and lacked any complexity. The tomato soup was too much I think and it needed more spices.

I LOVE this dish and so did my family. So easy. Never made burritos wet before but will now Frequently. Only change made, used larger can of enchilada sauce and no tomato soup because I didn't have any. I didn't put lettuce and tomatoes inside only on top with a dollop of Daisy. Scrumptious

I did not make any changes! I was a little hesitant about tomato soup but decided to try and it was a hit! We have a family of 7 and not one of them complained and the littlest one even got seconds! Thanks for sharing!

I didn't have all the ingredients on hand but I used what I had and it turned out delicious.  I didn't use tomato soup, I used homemade salsa instead and the chili and enchilada sauce were also homemade.  I didn't have the tomato and lettuce or green onion. I pout a dollop of sour cream on top upon serving. I will be making this again for sure.

Followed the recipe.  I agree with the ratings that state it did not taste authentic.  I liked the chili in it.  The sweet flavor comes from the tomato soup, which I would leave out if I made it again.

I  mix Spanish rice into the meat and really stuff them. I also add less chill is as I don't care for them and I still think these are amazing. My whole family loves them!
I plan to try chicken ones at my daughters request.

Thought they were super good going to add it to our monthly meals! I like to put them in the toaster oven before the sauce goes on to make them a but crispy.

For those that say this is bad because we do not know what "Real Mexican Food Should Taste Like" I have to ask: Is "Real Mexican Food" supposed to taste like ? This recipe is awesome, tastes great and who cares if it is "Real Mexican" or not? What a pompous critical review. Do not listen to it. This is awesome. I think the number of positive reviews speak for itself. I like to add wine to my chili. Does that make it bad because it does not taste like "Chili is supposed to"? Nope. Can you imagine if everything tasted the way one person thought it should taste? Incredible.

I just use a package of taco seasoning for the meat/bean mix. I've made it as the recipe stands and it is wonderful! This time, I improvised on the sauce a bit...only 1/2 can of Turkey chili - no beans (all I had), one can of enchilada sauce, and a package of Progresso Triple Cheese Sauce (foil pack). This also turned out great!

Since I did not have all the proper ingredients onhand, I made several substitutions and I believe the original recipe here would have been much better than mine...I would like to do this one again!

Made this recipe, sticking to the ingredients and instructions with one exception:  I added a second pound of lean ground beef to the meat mixture.  The taste was really good, but the texture was fairly mushy through and through.  Next time I would add fresh chopped onions to the burritos, just before microwaving to reheat.  We will be making these again.

Okay.  I was really excited about this recipe and was really looking forward to eating it.  Sigh.  Trying not to change much about this recipe but also trying to take into account all the reviews and tips, the only thing I changed was leaving out the tomato sauce and adding in some salsa.  The burritos themselves where easy to make and honestly a little fun to assemble.  I took the advice from other posts and popped them into a preheated oven instead of making one at a time in the microwave.  Sat down and took my first bite;  instant disappointment.  By adding the beans to the meat mixture, the result is this horrible mushy texture that is really unappetizing.  Also, the lettuce and tomato should have been held off and added at the end on top of the burritos.  I don't think however, that these changes would have saved this dish.  As I was eating it, my mind was coming up with what changes would improve the texture and taste.  I came up with so many changes that it just became silly to try to save this recipe when my mind was coming up with something completely different.  I will say that my husband and son ate them and thought they were okay, but they are also loving and supportive and were trying to be kind.  My husband usually waits until a couple days later to mention that we shouldn't make "that recipe" again. LOL

These were very bland.  There was not enough seasonings.  Maybe if a taco or burrito seasoning packet would've been added it would've been better.  We did not enjoy them at all.

Very yummy.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  I thought it might be a little too much tomato so I allowed the sauce to cook longer.  It was excellent.

I enjoyed this meal but wouldn't say it was amazing. With that said, everyone still devoured theirs (even the 4 yr old). If you read Buckys review some subs and additions were made that I think would make a big difference. Removing the tomato soup, adding some lime, and perhaps sharp cheddar. I'd make it again with these changes, though, since it was quick and easy.

They tasted a little different than what we were looking for, but we liked them and will make again. I did not use beans because we don't like them, and I didn't have any tomato soup on hand. But everything else is the same. Topped with lettuce, cheese, avocado and sour cream. Great tasting and different than tacos! Good for something different!

Sooooo goooooood!  Yes, I will make this again and again!  I don't use this recipe for the sauce, instead I use the recipe for Enchilada Sauce on this site by Anna Marie.  I believe this is what made it sooooo goooooood to me!  And bake it in the oven @ 350 degrees for about 25 minutes to crisp up the tortillas, not the microwave, then add cheese for the past 5 minutes...just to melt it.  Yum!

We loved these!  Used black beans instead of refried beans.  Had enormous tortillas, so next time, I'll double the beef/bean mixture to go inside of the burritos, and make a few more since there is plenty of sauce.  We put half the cheese in the burritos and half on the sauce.  We put the lettuce and tomato on top after baking in the oven on 325 for about 25 minutes.  (Put a little of the sauce in the bottom of your casserole dish before putting the burritos on top.)

Loved this recipe!!! Served it to my whole family and roommate. I followed how others had reviewed it and left out the tomato soup. Added some salsa to the sauce instead. I also baked the burritos in the oven with the sauce on top for about 20 minutes at 350 degrees. Turned out great!!!! I will definitely be making this again!!!

Didn't use the tomato soup and didn't have a can of beanless chili. Used an extra can of enchilada sauce and baked for 30 minutes at 375, then topped with cheese. An easy go to recipe!

Love this one. I cook for my son and myself and always make a dozen for freezing. Follow the recipe and its amazing. Replace tomato soup with 10 minute enchilada sauce recipe, and even a little more authentic tasting. For UK ingredients use jalapeños for green chillies, and the restaurant style taco seasoning recipe for the meat. Perfect thanks Cindy.

Yummy!  I didn't have some of ingredients in hand so used tomato sauce for tomato soup, omitted chille without beans, and had to make my own enchilada sauce from this site.  The sauce was too spicy so ended up adding some gravy mix powder and tasted pretty good.  So my rating is NOT based on what this original recipe calls for...  now I can't wait to try the recipe as is!

Very simple recipe, these were very easy to make and quick.  I doubled the recipe and instead of putting them together and warming them in the microwave, I filled the shells with the meat mixture, rolled them up and put them in a sprayed cake pan and then covered them in the sauce, topped with cheese and baked in the oven at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes or until the cheese melted and they started to bubble.  My kids loved these!

My fiance liked it but we both agreed we would like more spice.  We used double enchilada sauce omitting the tomato soup for more Mexican flavor.  I couldn't get past the canned chili in the sauce so next time I'll work on a more Mexican red sauce.  We put all the burritos under the broiler in a baking dish to melt the cheese.  This is a good base recipe but based on your taste preferences may need modified to suit your family.

I liked the idea of the recipe.  Used ground chicken instead of beef, canned black beans instead of refried beans. Also added 1/2 can green enchilada sauce to mixture along with onions, garlic, cumin and seasoned salt instead of green chilis. Heated tortillas on skillet,  Added grated colby cheese to the burritos and some salsa.  Rolled them up and served with heated left over green sauce.  Topped with sour cream and more salsa.  It's a winner!

From the East (MI) I had my share of Wet Burritos. Now in Ohio they don't know what they are! I was glad to see this with red sauce and not the green. When we eat them in MI we are often given the choice of lettuce inside or out. Patron choice, we do inside. I omitted the tomato soup because we like it less runny inside. Since we like things the hotter, I added lots of cumin. I will make these again. I will get the biggest shells I can find to make rolling easier with all my stuffings!! I did add 1 extra can of enchilada sauce after pulling it out of the oven. The wetter the better!

If you like Taco Bell Encharito's served in some areas you will love these.  My kids like them and I tolerate them but could not make alot as they don't seem too healthy.  Quick and easy and a great recipe for those who love fast food quality food.

Thank you. This native Texan has prepared this recipe a number of times. It's a quick, fun dish. I found the sauce a bit too sweet. I prefer substituting 8 ounces tomato sauce for the tomato soup.

I can not give this recipe 5 stars because I did change 1 thing. I used my home made chili from left overs on it and with that, I can give it 10 stars. I cooked everything as the recipe called for other than the chili. If you want a bad meal, use canned chili, if you want an EXCELLENT meal, use home made chili.

Really enjoyed this. I did, however, take out the tomato soup.  Having lived in Texas I wasn't happy with the taste.  All in all this is a very good version of a Tex-mex wet burrito!  Thank you Cindy.

This was pretty darn good! Comfort tex mex which is what I was expecting. I topped it with lettuce and pico, but made as directed, just with lean chili and fat free beans to ease the calorie load a tad. Would have been great with guacamole or sour cream on top, but alas I had none. Yummy and filling!!

This recipe is infinitely adaptable and served as a great base from which to start.  I used 10" flour tortillas (a full package of ten), placing about 6 in a Pyrex 9x13 and the remainder in an 8x8.  I had a few leftovers in the fridge that I added to the filling mixture, including about 1/2 C. of pinto beans and a scant 1 C. of homemade turkey chili, so I was able to make plenty of burritos (enough for two nights).  I omitted the lettuce & tomatoes from the filling and instead served it on top. I also used 96/4 lean turkey, which I drained.  The sauce is delicious but does make a ton, so there's plenty to drizzle on the pan bottom to prevent any sticking.  With a few modifications (fat free refried beans, lean turkey, low fat chili, light cheese) it's still delicious but also a decently healthful -- and totally filling! -- dinner.
I'll happily put this in the rotation.

I husband thought this recipe was a keeper.  I will add sour cream and guacamole
and salsa next time on my dish to add additional flavor.  Our grandson like the burrito without the sauce. He is not into spice yet.  All in all, I will make this again. Fast and easy and tasty.                                                      

 For a faster version, try left over or canned chili for the filling and on top for the sauce. Heat the chili. Warm the flour on a dry pan turning once the tortilla begins to rise. I like the flavor and texture of the flour tortilla better.. Add avocado or guacamole, tomatoes green onions, chopped black olives, sour cream and salsa. Yummy!!!

I made this for my husbands birthday when we stayed at a lodge for a weekend getaway. I made exactly as written and it was delicious. My husband doesn't care for tomato soup based sauces, but he loved this. Don't worry about the wrapping up the lettuce before you microwave it. It's delicious! Next time I make for the family, I will place 4-5 burritos on a jelly roll pan and broil for 5 mins to melt cheese (more for ease of making many at a time). Top with everything you would top a taco with! Excellent!!

Great quick and easy recipe..it states 45 minutes but we got it done a lot quicker. Hubby cut the veggies, I opened cans and heated on the stove. I don't usually use so many processed foods but it sure sped up the process. It's a bit more expensive then we normally spend for dinner (lean burger); it cost $18.91 w/o tax and my pack of tortillas had 8 so I made that many. It's just 3 of us so I took the extras and put them in freezer containers for work day lunches. We'll make this again on occasion..reminded us of the taco bell enchiritos..

Satisfied my Tex/Mex crave, but don't even look at the sodium count... just enjoy!  Definitely looking forward to leftovers. Surprisingly fresh tasting considering all the canned ingredients. Make sure your meat mixture gets very thick. I did have to reduce mine alot under very low heat depending on the moisture content of the diced chilies and re-fried beans you use. I had some great sweet potato chips as a side.

I love this recipe.  It is as close to the wet burritos they serve at Mexican resturants as it gets!  I did not have any no bean chili so I used cayenne pepper, chipotle chili seasoning and added a lil flour.  It was PERFECT!!

Cindy, although I changed it up a little, I thought it was great.  I put in in a baking dish without the tomato and lettuce.  I covered it with foil, baked it for 40 min @350.  I added the cheese once it came out of the oven.  My dh is eating it as we speak. I added a little bit more spices because we are from Texas and like our burritos a little spicy.  I will definitely make it again.

I don't usually like wet burritos, but this one was great. I also don't care for a tomatoey taste which is why I'm not a big fan of Italian pastas. I always switch out chile el pato in place of tomato sauce. Gives it a little bit of tomato with a little spice thrown in. Thank you for the great idea. I love making these. Very easy.

My husband and I loved this recipe!  Followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful!  I think i would leave out the refried beans the next time I make it.  I think I would prefer it with just the meat and cheese but the sauce was incredible!

Easy, excellent recipe as is.  I did add 1/2 lb. seasoned taco meat (because it was left over in frig.)  My whole family loved it!  This will definitely be a recipe I use every few weeks.  Thanks for the recipe Cindy!

Big hit with my family.  I was skeptical at first because I do not care for enchialda sauce and I have never had anything made by Hormel.  Made the recipe exactly as written and it was excellent.  I was pleasantly surprised.  Do not hesitate to make this one.  Thank you Cindy for sharing!

Simple and great recipe! I left out the tomato soup. Also used a green enchilada sauce and spiced things up a bit with some additional cumin, chili powder and cayenne. Turned out perfect. This one will be added to my regular rotation!

WOW - So good and so easy!  I never learned to cook so, at 55, I'm trying a few of the easy recipes. OMGosh!!  This is soooo good.  Hubby loved it too, as did the friends I shared a little with.   The only change I made (based on prior reviews) was that I substituted one can of drained Rotel for the tomato soup.  Yum Yum.  Thanks so much Sydney!

This is "pantry friendly", easy to prep and a totally awesome taste.  When we do Mexican-in, this is the requested dish.  I have it saved in "Family Favorites" and "Main Dishes".  If "Most Requested" was an option, it would be there as well.  Oh...BTW...I didn't choose this recipe because it was "healthy".  I chose it because it sounded good and it paid off!

We liked this recipe. Didn't have chili w/no beans so added pinto beans instead (not sure why). It leaves a tomato soup after taste which was the only reason i didn't rate it a 5 star. Overall it was pretty good.

This was wonderfully quick and easy to fix, and tasted great!  Since this was my first time making it, I mostly followed the recipe exactly.  I did leave out the tomato soup, using 1/2 cup salsa instead, and used chili with beans, since I didn't have chili with no beans on hand.  It tasted great as prepared, but we generally like a little more spice, so next time I will try adding chopped chipotles or pickled jalapenos.  This was a great variation to the "dry" burritos we often fix.

This is a keeper. I didn't have tomato soup on hand so I used blended stewed tomatoes instead, otherwise I followed the recipe. I was hesitant to add the shredded lettuce inside the burrito, but I'm glad I did.Thanks for sharing this one.

Love Love Love these! I followed the recipe almost exactly. The only thing I did differently was to put the lettuce and tomatoes on top of the burritos instead of inside. I liked Beaner720's idea of making them the night before and baking them later. This recipe is so good and so easy to make!

W-O-N-D-E-R-F-U-L! A local restaurant serves wet burritos & I always order them.  These are JUST AS GOOD!  You will not miss the lettuce if you are afraid the lettuce will wimp out on you; if making ahead.  I will be making these over and over and over . . . THANKS!

Really nice, I made my own enchilada sauce, also from Allrecipes.com, it was a good dish and I would make it again. Only thing I didn't do besides using my own sauce was I put the lettuce on top of the enchilada and topped with sliced black olives.

Oh my gosh... These were SO good. I was worried about it being warmed with lettuce inside but it wasn't a problem at all. It stayed nice and crisp.   Thanks Sydney. This is definitely a keeper. The hubby LOVED IT!!

This is the first time I've ever rated a recipe. This recipe was featured on all recipes last year and I tried it. It's become our family's go to enchilada meal. It tastes authentic, just spicy enough without shredding my grandsons tongue and easy enough to put together after work. The only change I make to it is to substitute the tomato soup for another can of enchilada sauce. Since enchilada sauce comes in a variety of spicinesses, you can customize the heat to suit your tastes. Love this recipe, thank you for sharing it!

Winner! I followed the base recipe but made it with leftover roasted chicken meat and added some diced tomatoes with green chile peppers along with the refried beans for the filling. Used a large can of enchilada sauce instead of tomato soup because that is what I had on hand. Baked it as BEANER720 recommended. IMO, this recipe is a winner because you can adjust to your taste and swap out your protein and it works.

These were really good.  Took other people's advice and eliminated the soup and just doubled the enchilada sauce.  Also used leftover turkey since I didn't have ground beef.  Very, very tasty.  Hubby and daughter enjoyed them thoroughly.  Will definitely be making again.

Had to change the recipe based on the ingredients I had on hand.  I used ground turkey, fat free refried beans and tomato sauce instead of the tomato soup.  All else, remained the same. Oh, and I almost forgot, I used 2 garlic cloves instead of just the one. I still would have rated it 4 stars though because I like my filling more meatier and this was too (for lack of a better word) mushy for me.  I really liked the wet sauce and the overall flavor of the burrito was good, even with my few changes.  I will try this again, but I plan to leave out the refried beans and maybe just serve them on the side next time.

Could easily be thrown in a pan to be frozen and heated later as enchiladas.

Husband loved it!  We converted them to enchiladas by using corn tortillas and topping cheese on top of the sauce.  I did not use tomato soup, and used a wonderful enchilada sauce that I also added just a touch to the meat to tie it all together. Delicious!

My family loved this!  I put refried black beans in it and a 15 oz of enchilada sauce and added some Cholula sauce for some heat.  I also poured the sauce over it and naked it for 25 minutes.  Very Yummy!

This is a great recipe, easy and delicious!!  I used rotel diced tomatoes to top and added black olives and sour cream.  Other than that I made as is. Oh, I did place the burritos in a glass baking dish and popped them in the oven at 350° for about 10 min. until cheese was melted.  This one is definitely going in my cookbook.  Easy weeknight meal add well!

My family really liked these, from the 4 year old to the adults. I had to make changes to accommodate being a vegetarian, so I used 1/2 pound hamburger and 2 cups cooked brown rice for the meat eaters and brown rice for mine. Instead of the chili without beans, I used chili beans with sauce. That made it somewhat bland, so I added chili powder, onion and garlic powders and cumin to the sauce. I used Red Enchilada Sauce by Sara.  I wasn't too sure about the tomato soup but used it and after it all came together, it worked out great. I baked it, topped it with Guacamole by Bob Cody, sour cream, tomatoes and lettuce, and enjoyed it! Thank you! I thought it was delicious even without the meat!

These burritos are easy and fun to make! If I want to make a few quick meals for the week, I just add the sauce straight into the burrito. I also like to add a little bit of rice to the burrito.

These are great! Better than ones you get in a restaurant. I added the onions to the raw hamburger when I cooked it, as well as the S&P. After draining, I doubled the cumin and added 1 T. of taco seasoning to the meat along with the garlic. I substituted 2/3 of a can of Herdez red salsa instead of the tomato soup (this made the sauce a little hot, but hubby loved it!) I added all of the other ingredients listed. I put a little cheese inside and baked them in the oven at 350* (without the lettuce and tomato inside) for 20 minutes, then topped with cheese and baked for 5 more minutes until the cheese melted. Topped with lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream and green onions. Yummy!

Very good!  Made similar changes as other reviewers; excluded the tomato soup and opted for baking the combined ingredients at 350 for 20 minutes.  I also used Cincinnati style chili, as that's what I had on hand, and the family loved it.

Very good!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  My husband really liked them.  Next time I would use spicier enchilada sauce and refried beans to give it more kick.  We like our food spicy.  The only problem is that I wound up with way too much sauce and it was sweeter than I would have liked.  I think next time I'll omit the tomato soup.

I found this recipe perfect as is, and with a side of spanish rice and the refried beans, my husband said it was better than any he had eaten in Mexico City! I did find other uses for the sauce. I combined the enchilada sauce and green chilipeppers in a sauce pan and heated thru. Now I can use it with all of our Mexican dishes since everyone (but me) likes thier food swimming in greenchili! Thank you for that! Now if I could just master sopillas!...sigh... :D

There is truth in advertising here- they really are "wet" burritos.  I left out the refried beans, which my family loathes, and prepared as written.  I did find it a little time-consuming and, more than anything, I did not like the microwave approach.  It tended to toughen the tortilla and, as previously mentioned, they were almost too wet.  I haven't tried going back and baking them yet but that is another option.  Otherwise, when spiced according to your individual tastes, these are quite good.

I have cooked this many times baking it in 350 degree oven for 25 minutes instead of microwaving. I also put a little of the sauce in the bottom of the 9 by 13 baking dish before adding the enchiladas.  I also add a small can of sliced black olives with the green onions. To spice it up I use a pound of Kris' Amazing Shredded Mexican Beef instead of ground beef.

We looooove this recipe. I've made it three times now and have always gotten rave reviews. The only change I made was generously coating the bottom of a 9 X 13 greased casserole dish. I then fill the burritos as stated and put the remaining sauce on top. Top with cheese and put in the oven at 400 degrees for 20 minutes.

Delicious!

This is one of our favorite meals, I've made it at least a dozen times. The changes I make; I leave out the tomato soup all together. I also make all the burritos, put them in a casserole dish, top with sauce & cheese and warm in the oven til cheese is melted. So good!

Simple & tasty. I used or eliminated the tomato soup, but always use whole beans instead of refried. This is on my list of Go-To Favorites.
Added note -- there are copycat recipes for 'enchiritos', I've read those recipes and I don't even try them because they don't even sound as good as this one (and I know this tastes 'fabulous').

The whole family loved it. We left the beans and meat separate and set it up like a taco bar, so everyone was able to do their own to their preferences. Added guacamole and sour cream on the side to top with also.

Very good.  I thought this was a good recipe but not the biggest fan of the sauce.  I will say, however, that my husband and daughter did like the sauce!  It was just a little too sweet for me possibly from the tomato soup.

I make these for my boyfriend and he loves them.  He even told his mother my receipe was better than hers...first time ever!  I do change a bit.  I use taco seasoning instead of the spices (because I am lazy) I also skip the soup and add another can of enchilada sauce.  Then I skip direction #3 and bake them, covered in sauce, cheese and green onions at 350 for 15 minutes.  I serve lettuce, tomato, and sour cream on the side.  I love the ease of this and my family loves the taste.  It doesn't replace our favorite Mexican Restaurant, but it's great for a week night meal!  And best part is, everyone thinks of it as a special treat!

Fabulous isn't a good enough word for this recipe. I rolled the tortillas and put them in a dish with the sauce and baked them in the oven. Had the lettuce and tomato and other stuff on the side. Don't listen to the people that don't like it try it you will see for yourself.

My husband & son love Mexican-style food.  Being Canucks, the closest we get to real Mexican food is the local Taco Bell.  We started off with the hard tacos available in grocery stores.  I have found recipes for fajitas & quesadillas, but until I got this recipe they had to rely on frozen burritos.

We had the wet burritos tonight for supper. They were so good, the leftovers are being prepared for freezing.  I was disappointed that I could only eat one, they are so good..... thank so much for sharing.

ps - would have submitted a photo, but they disappeared too fast....

Made this last night for the hubby and close friends and everyone raved about it!!! Added extra onion to the meat and some extra seasoning - smoked papria and cayenne. Threw in some cheese when I rolled them up. Covered them with sauce and more cheese and baked them at 350 for 20-30 minutes. Served with chopped green onions, extra cheese, extra sauce, sour cream, chopped lettuce, chopped tomatoes, and homeade guacamole. Side dish - Spanish rice. Definitely a keeper!!

Well, I've never been much for cooking with canned foods but I can definitely see some potential for this recipe once I alter a bit to suit my from-scratch methods. This is good because I don't have much luck with burritos and enchiladas. They're usually way too heavy so this recipe provides a good basis for me. Love me some Tex-Mex!

I made this as written and I thought the burrito part was ok but I did not like the sauce. It is easy to make and good for a quick weeknight meal - but I think I would try something else for the sauce next time. Probably won't be making this again.

Did not have Enchilada sauce, so I made the recipe from this site.  After rolling up all of the burritos, I put them into a 9x13 dish, poured the sauce over top of them, and put them in the oven until the cheese melted.  This was very yummy.

I was very leary as I started making this because I did not like the taste of the sauce (too much tomato soup flavor), however, I have to say that when all the flavors combined, it was good!  I cooked at 350 in 9x13 for 15 minutes though and it only needed 1/2 the sauce - it made a ton.

I made these the other night and they were fabulous! The whole family thought so too and for that alone this recipe gets 5 stars. I made as directed but I ended up with 9 burritos instead of 6. I must not have put the full amount into the tortilla, but honestly it couldn't hold much more and still close. I will definately be making these again! Thanks Sydney6!

Made this for dinner tonight, followed the recipe mostly, I didn't put the lettuce and tomato in the burrito, instead I filled the burritos with meat mix and cheese, put in a 9 By 13 dish and covered with suave and cheese then baked at350 degrees for 25 minutes. Topped with lettuce, tomato, sour cream, guacamole and olives. Entire family loved them. My 8 year old couldn't get enough!

I made this last night, following the recipe almost exactly. The only thing I changed was that I added cheese in the burrito as well as on top. Also, I did put the tomatoes and lettuce on top rather than putting it inside the burrito. These were AWESOME! Thank you so much for a great recipe SYDNEY6!!!!!

One of the best Mexican recipes I have ever made. It was so fantastic. I added 1/2 cup salsa to the beef/bean mixture, and then topped it when cool salsa to serve. Just amazing.

Recipe was so yummy!  I added rice to the burritos.  Also, like others, omited lettuce and tomatoes.  Cooked in the oven to melt cheese and added veggies on top at the end.  Also topped with some homemade guacamole.  Delish!  Will be adding this into our monthly menu!

Whole Family  loved these !  I doubled the recipe . I only used one can of tomato  soup & two cans of enchilada sauce  .  I also baked them  in the oven , instead of the microwave. Delicious ! My husband could have used more spice but that is his personal preference , the kids and I thought they were perfect .

Kudos to such a good recipe.  But it's interesting because I was searching for a super easy chili recipe that basically involved doctoring up a couple cans of chili (without beans).  This can make absolutely the best chili ever (my husband says so and he's hard to please).  I followed other reviewers' advice and replaced the canned tomato soup with an equal amount of Rotel diced tomatoes and chilis.  Instead of putting the canned chili, enchilada sauce, etc. in a separate pan, I just added that (I doubled the amount of canned chili) to the ground beef mixture.  Also, I didn't have the regular kind of canned enchilada sauce, so I added what I had: Old El Paso green enchilada sauce.  That might make it too spicy for some, but my husband and I loved it.  I don't like the taste of any of the canned refried beans, so I simply added a can of drained, rinsed kidney beans that I hit with an immersion blender, more to give it extra body, similar to an Easy Skillet Taco recipe from SL.  I'll be taking this one to a family reunion/potluck, carrying it in a crock pot for ease of keeping hot.  Some time soon I will definitely try these very tasty-sounding wet burritos.  Thanks for the wonderful idea!

We liked these but we didn't like the seasonings (particulary the garlic), we will use regular burrito/taco seasonings next time.

Very good.  Do not use Skyline for the Chili, use a normal canned chili like Bush's or something.   And if you don't have tomato soup sub in some salsa!

My husband said to keep this recipe and he almost never says that. It is very,very close to the wet burrito from the little joint he loves that is too far for frequent visits. Left the lettuce and tomato out and baked the burritos and sauce in a 9 by 13. We love these, but we are from the east so I know they may not be really authentic

Very impressed!!  Super good and easy.
I have used AllRecipes to cook at least 4 nights a week for the last year and this is the first recipe I felt strong enough about to rate!!
Didn't change much except baking at the end instead of microwaving.  
No need to visit a Mexican restaurant with this one in my repertoire :)

I only used a 1/2 can of refried beans and subbed Turkey chili for regular chili for the topping - I didn't care so much for the sauce on top but overall I thought this was a good recipe and would make again.

Husband loved it!  Said "make this anytime you want."  We had a lot of sauce leftover, but he's happy to use it in the morning on eggs.  Thanks for a great recipe!  I made it exactly as written (except I used venison burger).

These were very yummy!  I left out the tomato soup, and there was plenty of sauce without it.  I went with others' suggestions and put the lettuce and tomato on top after baking the burritos in the oven at 350 for 10-15 minutes.  I'm sure I'll be making these often!

Thought these were very very good.  I did have to substitute 1/2 package of taco seasoning ( no cumin).  I did not use refried beans, we don't care for them.  Also, as some noted I left out the tomato sauce.  Will make again and try with chicken also..  WOW. Even my picky husband ate them.

A little salty for my tastes due to the canned goods. I made a couple minor variations suggested by others, doubling enchilada sauce and omitting tomato soup, baking for 15 min @350 instead of microwaving, served on top of lettuce bed, garnished with green onion and tomato. It looked and tasted as good as something I would get at a mexican style chain restaurant. Not real authentic but good nevertheless.

This was my first attempt at making a wet burrito.  It was fairly easy to make, but made 4 times too much sauce.  It was extremely obvious that this was an Americans take on Mexican dish.  It was good, just not what I was looking for.

I would have to say that this is the best recipe for burritos that I have ever found.  My husband even said "Why go out to a Mexican restaurant, when you can make it right here for me?"  Not sure, if I should be really happy, because I would like a break from cooking once in a while.  Anyway, I followed this recipe exactly and despite some of the other reviews, I wouldn't change anything.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  We love it!

This was freaking amazing! I of course altered the recipe just a little to fit my taste. I just added some taco seasoning to the meat (oh, and I used turkey, its better for you) and I added a little salsa to the meat mixture. I like a little heat, and the beans made it kinda thick so the salsa helped. Then I baked it, added a little more cheese of course, and some pico de gallo. It was delicious! Good job all recipes!

Tastes like what you receive in a restaurant. I hold the lettuce back and lay it beside the burrito with a spoonful of sour cream.

Awesome and not too much work. I did have to sub for two things: did not have refried beans, so I used a can of mexi-corn I had on hand (corn, onions, green peppers and black beans); did not have enchilada sauce, so I added a can of chili with beans to the sauce. It was very, very good.  I hate to change the recipe and give it such good ratings, but I think that is part of the beauty of this one-there are so many varied yummy ingredients that add to the overall effect- subbing one or two does not detract from the deliciousness of this. I think there are many ways you could make this and have it turn out great, which to me is part of a 5 star recipe. Thanks!

pretty good,  used chicken and homemade chilli.  Husband flat out refused to put the sauce on the burrito (just on his rice) but said it was a bit watery, but tasty.  I thought it was a bit on the salty side.  However, I did not use tomato soup.  I think Ill make this again and follow the recipe to the T.  Either way, tasty.

This is for the lady who says everyone who likes this must be from the east.  I live in Texas down by Mexico and my best friend is actually from Mexico and we all love it.  This is a great recipe.  But you need to follow recipe exactly.

I made these this week and they were VERY good!!  Like others, I left out the tomato soup and added a can of Rotel Tomatoes to the sauce.  I like that.  Served leftovers to my sister the next day and they were even better!  I think from now on when these are on my menu for the week I will put these together the night before and put them in the fridge and cook them the day we eat them.  I also cooked mine in a casserole dish at 350 for 30 minutes.  Would definitely recommend!!

This was sooo good and very easy.  The only thing I didn't do was add tomato soup to the sauce.  I will definitely be making this one again.

This was just ok. Not at all restaurant quality like some have said. Maybe just spoiled when it comes to Mexican food being from California.

My family requests this almost on a weekly basis. It is a crowd pleaser, especially with the kids. I like to spice it up for the adults by adding several good splashes of hot sauce. We are from out west where there is some very good authentic mexican food and I would say this rates up there.

I didn't have any garlic on hand but I don't think it made much difference.  This was a great recipe but I will only make half the sauce next time because it made a lot.

My husband loved this. I made this one with low fat versions of each ingredient. Turkey chili, fatfree refried beans, lowfat sour cream and cheese. Instead of assembling the burritos and heating them separately, I place them in a baking dish, covered with the sauce and cheese and baked 350 until the cheese was melted around 20 min. Then dress however you like with the lettuce, tomato and whatever else you like. Excellent recipe and something I would have never thought to make.

This is a really simple and delicious recipe. I did away with the tomato soup and enchilada sauce, and simply soup some salsa and shredded cheddar over the burritos before popping into the oven. Delish!

Good, a nice change from the usual burrito. I topped the filling with olives, tomatoes, cheese. Rolled them up, put them in a 9x13 pan, covered with the sauce and more cheese, baked at 350 for 30 minutes.

These were great! Obviously a little messy, but even my 4-year-old likely them. I used salsa instead of the tomato soup, and it was wonderful. Thank you!

This recipe is very good, although I have changed some things. I added an extra pound of ground beef, as just one pound with the can of beans took away some of the meat flavor. Guess you could halve the amount of beans, but I like leftovers of this. I also took out the tomato soup as it seemed to dilute the sauce. The chili and enchilada sauce together added a spicey flavor. Will look at adding jalapenos instead of green chilis next time!

I made this last weekend, it was wonderful and so easy. I made the recipe as written and was thrilled with the finished product. The boys gave it two thumbs up and asked me to keep on making it. I served this with spanish rice on the side. I will keep this in my monthly rotation.

I thought this recipe was great and so easy to make. I used salsa and tomato sauce instead of tomato soup and chili, and I cooked it in the oven for 25 minutes to melt the cheese rather than using the microwave. And I used 1.5 lbs of ground beef (with a little taco seasoning); 1 lb just did not seem like enough. What a wonderful recipe! I will certainly make this again.

Celebrated Cinco de Mayo with this burrito.  It is absolutely wonderful.  My husband and I order wet burritos when we are at Mexican Restaurants, and this ranks right up there with the best we have had!  Delicious!!!  Quick and easy too.  I used salsa in place of the tomato soup like others had suggested, and iit was great!!!  Enough for lefovers!!

I have tried these with both burger and ground turkey and both are pretty good as far as the flavor goes. I don't cook in the microwave so I put mine in a baking dish and put in the oven for a while. The prep is a bit much for me as I don't really have that kind of time just for a burrito - not sure if I'll be making again.

This is absolutely fabulous. Everyone should give a shot at this. I tried the best burritos in Mexico some 6 years back. Until i tried this recipe, nothing else came close. Well, not the best but this is one darn good burrito i tell ya. SO SIMPLE TO MAKE. You don't have to follow the ingredients as is but be generous with the meat, the beans, the cheese and everything will fall into place. Nothing else matters after that ;) Seriously good meal i tell ya.

Fantastic!  I am so very glad I decided to make as written because they are perfect!  I topped these with sour cream, I love them and will use this recipe often.  I have tried different brands of chili w/o beans and Nally seems to be the winner at our house (the boys don't seem to care for Hormel as much).   Great recipe.  Nice and easy!

Easy to make, and even my picky daughter loved it! Served with Mexican rice on the side, very filling.

These burritos are soooo good & easy.The only thing I do differently from the recipe is put them in a 350 degree oven for about 20 minutes, have made several times and will definitely make again and again.

TY SYDNEY6 , This was a first attempt for homemade wet burritos for me, and everyone raved about them. I had more filling than i could fit into my tortillas, but it didn't go to waste! My daughter, her boyfriend and I made lunch with it the next day..... it was amazing!

These were easy to make and fun to assemble. My husband went ga-ga over them and has requested that I make them again this weekend! I used a can of Rotel instead of the tomato soup - it added spice and texture.

I decided to make this exactly like the recipe instructs, and it turned out delicious.  My husband and I just moved to Iowa from Texas and haven't found great Tex-Mex here, but this rivals our favorite dishes from restaurants in Texas.  Thank you so much for sharing.

I love this recipe!!!! I made it for the hubby because this is what he orders every time we go to a mexican restaraunt. It is way better than our favorite restaraunt!! I change 2 things though, left out the beans just because we don't like them and I also don't use tamato soup, instead I use salsa. Recomend it completly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I made this a couple nights ago for my husband and he LOVED it.  He doesn't give many thing 5 stars, and he isn't a fan of enchilada sauce, so this is a winner for our family.  I didn't modify anything either.

Excellent! I used chicken instead of the beef and added a little bit of ginger (for some extra zing). Turned out beautifully and is now one of my favorite meals!

This was very tasty, but rather time cosuming for to make.  It also made a TON of filling...we saved it and had it with nachos the next night.  The sauce was good and unique.

This recipe is great.  I made it with Rotel instead of tomato soup but the great part is that it's so adaptable to individual tastes.  You can make it as hot or mild as you want and determine which flavors you want to dominate.   I cut back a little on the cumin and used a smaller can of chili but I think this is one of my favorites in all of the recipes I've tried.   I baked it at 350 until the cheese was melting and the sauce was bubbling.  (about 20 minutes)  I ate it with the garnishes cold.   Awesome.

First time ever making enchiladas/burritos. My 13 yr old said Can we have these again?? I said Sure.  He said, Tomorrow??  I followed the recommendations of others, using 2 cans of sauce, no tomato soup, finishing in oven. I used chicken (boiled, shredded) instead of ground beef, the wife said ground beef wouldn't have been as good.  Really enjoyed these!!  Served w/and over rice, and the Honey Cornbread from here.

4.5 stars given. I was a little disappointed as everyone rated it so high, but my husband loved it. He didn't use a lot of the wet sauce - he put some inside the burrito.  Lower rating by me as my tummy didn't like the wet sauce that I piled on top of the burrito. Too many cans for my taste, but I think most people would like this approach as it's easy to prepare.

This recipe was fabulous and not difficult to make.  It was also great as a leftover.  The beef mixture would make a great nacho topping.

Loved these!  I went with a few changes based on other reviews, very minor stuff.  Used the Rotel tomatoes in place of the tomato soup and put in the oven for a few minutes on 400 to melt the cheese before putting the lettuce and tomato on.  Served with sour cream and Guac and this was a hit!  Will make again for sure.

A Hit With Us...I always try to keep to the recipe exactly the first time, but I needed to make two changes.  First, I used extra lean ground turkey, as we aren't eating beef any longer.  Next I left out the onions because of my husband's allergy.  We absolutely loved the end result.  They were so easy and leftovers kept well enough to travel to work to enjoy again.  I will definitely make again.  I think next time I will leave out the can of soup like someone else recommended.  It really wasn't necessary.  Thanks for the recipe.

I liked these burritos.  Like others had said, I added rotel tomatoes.  I also added in some green/red peppers into the meat mixture to add flavor.  I did not use the tomato soup.  I used green enchilada sauce with the no bean chili.  I baked these at 350 for 20 min.  Then turned the oven off and topped the enchiladas with cheese and put them back into the oven for 10 min.   Topped w/ sour cream.  Delicious!

I'll be honest. Except for baking in the oven for 10 minutes, I followed the recipe exactly. When I started preparing the sauce on the stove I was a little nervous. The smell was HORRIBLE. I had read the review about it having too much of a 'canned' taste and I really thought I was about to ruin the burritos by pouring it over the top so I only used about half of the sauce. I was wrong. I pulled them out of the oven and they smelled and tasted so good I wished I had used all of the sauce. Me and my husband loved them and are having them again tonight.

This recipe was good, not great. The sauce was too sweet. I think I would have preferred just the enchilada sauce. I also thought it was a little bland. I would make it again but with modifications. I think it could be better topped with black olives and avocado slices and maybe some sharper cheeses.

My mom used to make wet burritos similar to this when I was growing up in Michigan. We had a group of people over, and I made these, with a couple changes, and people wanted to take their leftovers home with them. I used salsa instead of the tomato sauce. I also made one with just bean, and added a portion of the sauce to the bean, and added 1/2 tbsp cumin and 1/2 tbsp chili powder. I baked them in the oven together to melt the cheese.

Excellent burritos, the sauce is great. I did add one package of cooked taco rice to the filling, but that's the only change I made (personal preference, I like rice in burritos) and it would have been 5 stars without it too.

This recipe was really good and it has a great presentation. The sauce was a bit too sweet.  Next time, I think I will add half of the soup or maybe substitute with tomato sauce.

I am so glad I found this recipe!  I live an hour away from the nearest city that serves wet burritos, so am happy that I can make them at home and they taste just like the ones in the restaurant!  Delicious!  The only changes I made were to omit the cumin and the tomato soup.  Great recipe, thank you, thank you!

Me and my boyfriend stumbled across this recipe one day after have A LOT of trouble trying to decide what to make for dinner and decided this one looked easy and tasty.  Aside from having to cut up the veggies, this recipe is super super simple and it's absolutely delicious!!!!  We made it two nights in a row!  It's perfect with guacamole and sour cream to top it.

This was FABULOUS. I did as others said and did not use the tomato soup. I made some with just ground turkey and some with ground turkey and beans (I like bean my fiance does not). I also added some salsa to the turkey/bean mixture. We really loved this but it makes a lot, I think more than 6 servings. I will be making this again.

I made this recipe last night.  I thought it was great.  I was a little concerned when I read one reviewer write that the recipe was too much work.  However, I don't know how it could be easier!  Besides some chopping of the vegetables, it was super easy.  And delicious!  I also liked how by using the microwave I didn't have any gooey, messy, dirty casserole dishes that needed to be cleaned afterward.  Very good, even though I forgot to add the chilis!  Oops! Next time.  And there will be a next time.

This is a very good weekday meal.  I will definitely be adding it to the rotation.  The mistake I made was buying a little can of chopped jalapenos and they were HOT!  So next time, just the regular chiles.  I finished it off in the oven rather than the microwave.  Also, rather than the tomato soup, I used a can of green enchilada sauce and added that to the red enchilada sauce.

The inside stuff (beef/bean mixture) was great but I didn't like the sauce.  Maybe because it was canned chili and canned enchilada sauce.  I bet it would be great if you made homemade chili and enchilada sauce but that would take a lot longer.  I may try it one day when I have time.

good recipe!  I used 1/2 cup salsa instead of the tomato soup (didn't have any on hand) I also made all the burritos and placed in a 9 x 13 pan and covered with sauce and baked for 20-30 min.  Husband liked recipe too.

Awesome burritos. Forgot the condensed tomato soup but the sauce still turned out great. Made a side of yellow rice and black beans and it complemented the burritos well. Would definitely recommend to anyone!

Don't let the name gross ya out...these were GREAT!  Mother in law made these for newphews birthday dinner (he requested beef burritos) and they were really good!  Next time would not put the tomato soup in the sauce though.  We all thought that was a bit much.  Will make these myself at our house for dinner as they were that good!

I am giving this four stars because I didn't end up using the chili mixture.  I heated it up, and the smell really turned me off to it, and I usually like canned chili.  I think it was the chili and enchilada sauce together.  But, the meat mixture was very good, and I will be using this recipe for my burritos in the future, minus the chili.

Considering my husband looked this recipe up on his own and made it on his own, it deserves 5 stars just for that.  However, it actually tasted really great too.  Fun new dish!

I, too, think this is a GREAT recipe! I love Mexican food, and this is a pretty easy recipe for us! I used half the refried beans and changed a few things like the others, and to top it off we grill the burrito (put lettuce and cheese and sauce on top after its done being grilled. I think it adds a great touch!

Very good recipe. I left out the refried beans, and think I would try it with them the next time. Also- as a personal preference I think I would make these with either Chicken or pork next time.

We really enjoyed this recipe. The first time I made this, I followed the recipe only tweaking when I felt that it needed more heat.However, we often have burritos featuring other leftover mexican food to clean out the fridge (taco filing, fajita filing, enchilada filing, etc). So now when we have burritos, I use only the sauce portion of this recipe to turn our ordinary burritos into wet burritos. Thanks for an easy and delicious recipe!

Yummy!  My family loved these!  Even my picky 7YO!  I followed the suggestions in some of the other reviews.  I used Ro-tel instead of tomato soup.  It just seemed like a better taste combination.  I also mixed most of the cheese in with the burger/bean mixture for ease of filling the burritos.  I put a little bit of sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 pan, placed the filled burritos in next, and then covered with the rest of the sauce.  Then sprinkled the rest of the cheese (I used more cheese than the recipe called for) on top.  Baked at 350 for 20 minutes.  Then topped with other ingredients before serving.  These were great.  Hubby (who is Mexican-American, and kind of picky about his burritos) actually liked these.  He did make a few suggestions.  One of those was that it would be better with meat other than burger (he likes his burritos with shredded or chopped beef, pork, or chicken).  All in all, this is a fabulous recipe.  The most time consuming part was rolling the burritos and that really took no time at all!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Really good for the short amount of time it took to make. My boyfriend suggested adding some rice to the mix so the burritos were a little fuller and putting some guacamole and sour cream on top as well. To make it easier for serving, I rolled the burritos a lined them up in a 9x13 glass pyrex and then spooned the sauce on top of them all. I added my cheese and other toppings and placed it in the oven for about ten minutes-long enough to melt the cheese. Then I served each burrito with a spatula.

My family loved this recipe...it was exactly what we had been looking for!  The only things I did differently to accommodate our tastes was to omit the refried beans and substitute the tomato soup for an extra can of enchilada sauce (I used one mild and one hot).  I also placed all the burritos in a 9x13 with sauce and cheese over top and placed in the oven.   Served with lettuce & onions on top....delicious!

VERY GOOD! I left out the chili and tomato soup for the topping and just used red enchilada sauce. Was very easy and very good! We looked forward to leftover night!

Our whole family loves these burritos. I tried the recipe exactly as stated the first time. We decided to leave out the tomato soup the next time we made it and it's even better with just a good red enchilada sauce and less pure tomato flavor.

Even my boyfriend, who is very picky, liked it.  It's a change from the usual tacos that I make.  Changes to recipe:  Replaced the tomato soup with salsa.  I would recommend using mild enchilada and not hot. I used hot, and it took away from the burrito flavor.

These were incredible! I took others' suggestions. I cut the tomato soup in half and put the burritos in the oven to melt the cheese. My husband really enjoyed them a lot! They were another big success! Thank you for a great recipe!

These are soooooo good! I used organic spaghetti sauce in place of tomato soup. I also added a dollop of sour cream on top with a touch of lime zest. Absolutely wonderful! I make this alot! YUM YUM YUM!

GREAT GREAT GREAT!!! DELICIOUS!! ...I can't STAND spicy things...So I only used a tiny bit of cumin and with the sauce, I just combined the chili and tomato soup...It turned out great! and NOT SPICY! To add a little flavor to the beef/bean mixture, I added a bit of sage, red pepper, and basil...The beef/bean mixture tasted SOOOO much better than the first time I made it! GREAT RECIPE! I LOVE IT! I will make these for company!! Also...You can just make up a 9x13 pan and bake it for a bit...Then you don't have to microwave individual plates and it is more presentable that way. THANKS!

These were okay.  The sauce was a little too sweet, I'd suggest using 1/2 a can of the condensed soup to remedy that.  I probably won't make these again, neither my husband nor I enjoyed them very much.

I added a package of taco seasoning to the meat instead of the cumin. I also added a little bit of cumin to the sauce to give it more of a Mexican taste. I loved it and my husband ate it up but said it taste too tomatoey...whatever that means. Thanks!

My boyfriend and I give this one 4 stars.  For some reason the meat seemed like it needed a little more spice to it but other than that I was really happy.  The sauce on top of the burrito was the best part!  I'm definitely making this again!  :)

They are Fabulous!!! The reason I gave it 4 stars is because I change it up a bit, I used spicy beans, jalapeno peppers instead of Chile & 1/2 the enchilada sauce also I baked mine at 350 degrees (pre heated oven) for about 15-25 minutes so the cheese can melt & crust a bit, I also added cheese inside the burritos, I guess you can do so much with this recipe to spice it up and make it the way you like it. It’s easy to make so I’ll be making it again & again. Thank You.

These were ok. I'm not sure I'd make them again. If I do, I'll use less refried beans for sure. My husband liked them more than I did.

As recommended, I skipped the tomato soup and added about 3/4 cup of hot salsa. I added plenty of cheese inside of the burritos and out, and next time, the only thing I'll change is to add more heat, maybe with hot enchilada sauce and an extra can of diced chiles. Once served, we slathered our burritos in lettuce, sour cream, salsa, and olives. Also, no tomato or lettuce on the inside. Muy bueno!

I thought these were good, but maybe not fabulous due to the canned ingredients.  I just prefer the made-from-scratch taste.

This is the best burrito recipe that I have ever made. I have had authentic Mexican burritos and they do not even come close to this recipe. Very easy to make and very flavorful. Deserves a five star rating

I made this recipe for some friends who were not from the area and had never had a "wet" burrito. They absolutely LOVED it!! Since then, whenever I see them they want me to make this recipe! 

I have experimented with the recipe just to switch things up.

These were unbelievably good.  Just like in a restaurant. I tried to make more figure friendly. I used whole wheat tortillas, fat-free refried beans, ground turkey breast, low-fat cheese.  I also made my own enchilada sauce (Mrs. Espy's) from this site.  Thank you soooo much for this one!

These burritos were okay.  I did not use cumin, I don't like it.  I also did not use tomato soup.  To be honest, this was the first time in my life I have ever tried enchilada sauce from a can.  I guess I was spoiled having only tried the homemade stuff. The meat/bean mixture was great.  I really enjoyed that.  It was just the sauce i wasn't satisfied with.  These burrito would be perfect with some homemade green chili.

Oh my Gooooooodness!  Everyone flipped out over these at my dinner table.  I used Green Enchilada sauce and that got better reviews from my guests than the Red Enchilada sauce.

Yummy! The sauce makes the difference. I made a chuck roast in the slow cooker. Shredded the beef and used instead of ground meat.

Very good.  I made a big batch of these so I rolled up the burritoes and put in an 11x13 baking dish, covered with sauce and cheese and green onions and put in the oven until the cheese melted.  I was initially hesitant about the tomato soup for the sauce, but it did taste good once all mixed together.  Easy simple recipe.

This was so good! My husband has already requested to have it again. I did alternate it a little. Instead of refried beans, I used a can of pintos. Instead of ground beef, I used shredded chicken. I poured the sauce over burritos. I baked it in a 9x13 pan in the oven at 350 for 30 min. This is yummy!

Wow!  This is a great burrito!  This is the first recipe that I felt compelled to write about (and I have made many great meals off of this website) .  My whole family had seconds and said it looked and tasted right out of an authentic (American) Mexican restaurant.  I only made one change and it was simply out of convenience.  I used 20oz of the enchilada sauce and omitted the tomato soup simply because I had a 20oz can of sauce and I wanted to use the whole thing.  It came out wonderful - and it was EASY!

These were great, my family loved them.  I made a few changes though.  I used taco seasoning instead of the spices because I always have taco seasoning on hand.  I only used half of the can of tomato soup.  I just added a little bit, tasted, and added a little more until I thought it tasted right.  I completely left out the chili.  I'm not a huge meat eater and the meat in the burrito as well as on top sounded like it would be a little too much for me.  I think next time I'll bake them like it has been suggested because it was a pain to keep getting up and refilling everyone's plates!

Loved it!  and so easy.  A leisurely 40 minutes from the time I stepped into the kitchen till it was on the table.  I made a few changes, though.  I left out the green chiles and refried beans because I didn't have any.  I added some chili powder and a little enchilada sauce to the meat, and instead of tomato soup I used a 17 oz. can of enchilada sauce.  I put some of the sauce in the bottom of a 13x9 pan, added the filled tortillas (which I didn't bother to warm up), poured the rest of the sauce over the top, topped with cheese, and heated in a 350 degree oven for 15 minutes.  This will become a staple at our house.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe! For a lower-sodium version, I make refried beans from dry beans, and use homemade chili (again with dry beans) for the sauce.  It's a little extra effort, but worth it if you have to watch your sodium intake.

Wow this is excellent. My husband and I really liked the sauce. I only did two things differently. I used garlic salt instead of garlic, because I seasoned my meat my usual way (salt pepper, garlic salt) before I realized there was garlic to be added. DH doesn't like tomatoes but he likes salsa so I used salsa in place of the tomatoes topping the meat mixture. Very good, will make again!

Hubby and I loved this recipe. As per a previous suggestion I used only 1/2 can of refried beans and spiced it up with chopped jalopenos. Nummy!

They really made a hit in my house. I wasn't sure about the authenticity of adding Tomato Soup but the sauce mixture was delicious!!! i used lowfat cheese, low carb wholewheat tortillas and fat free refried beans. No one knew otherwise . This recipe is staying around for a long while.

This recipe makes enough that I can freeze meat mixutre & gravy for several more meals. I omitted the salt & pepper & used less cheese than called for. We usually fix fried burritos, but this was a nice change.

I loved this recipe! I did use a little bit less than the full can of refried beans and I used the fat free kind. It was delicious! I will definately make this again!

Very good recipe!  Best wet burritos we ever made at home, and just as good as our favorite restaurant burritos.  We like ours mild, so we used only about 1/2 the chopped jalapeno peppers and it was perfect.  Kids loved them too!

For people like me who like Mexican food without it being too hot this was a great recipe. It had a lot of flavor and didn't make us breathe fire! I made a bunch of these and froze them for quick dinners later in the week and they tasted great.

I didn't use the chili or soup because that just seemed like too much, especially for a dinner for 2, but even without this was really great. Also super easy. It's going into our regular rotation for sure.

THESE WERE TASTY BUT THERE WAS A BIT MORE SAUCE THAN NEEDED..THEY WERE ALSO A LITTLE BIT HARD GETTING OUT OF THE CASSEROLE DISH(MESSY)..I USED EXTRA LEAN GROUND BEEF AND TURKEY CHILI TO MAKE IT LOWER IN FAT..OVERALL THE TASTE WAS GOOD..JUST WANTED TO ADD, EVEN BETTER THE NEXT DAY.

These are really easy and good! I filled the burritos, placed them in a baking dish, poured the sauce over them and topped with cheese. I left them long enough to melt the cheese.

I had mixed reviews from my family.  Overall, I think it passed the test as a keeper.  I did use chili with beans and added a can of Rotel tomatoes. Served in warm tortillas, with cheese, lettuce, sour cream, etc. I am going to add kidney beans to the leftovers and pass off as chili tonight! ;)

This was excellent!  I actually added an extra half pound of beef to make the mixture thicker inside the burritos, and it was still delicious.  There is plenty of sauce left over after the burritos so make sure to use a lot on each burrito!  The only thing I could suggest would be to reduce the amount of tomato soup added to the sauce, mine was a bit too tomato and not enough spice for my taste.

I was skeptical about the sauce and when I tasted it while it was cooking it tasted too much like chili.  But it turned out okay actually on the burritos.  Would make again but without mixing the refried beans with the beef, and maybe without the chili and tomato soup and make a more mexican flavored sauce.

This recipe was excellent and so easy to make!  I think next time I may try to substitute black beans for the refried beans but other than that I wouldn't change a thing! And this recipe will definitely become a staple in my house! Thanks!!

Delicious!  I made them for my husband and son tonight and they thought they were from a Mexican restaurant.  I used fat free soup and chili with beans and they were fantastic.  Thanks for the great recipe!
