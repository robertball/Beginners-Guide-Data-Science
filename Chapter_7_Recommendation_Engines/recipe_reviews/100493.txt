Great Salsa and it goes great with grill beef or chicken. The reason why this salsa is famous in Mexico and why is called salsa Chilena is because this is originally from Chile and a Chilean living in Zacatecas add the peppers for the Mexican taste.

I love this salsa.
I also live in Zacatecas and have been buying this salsa in its commercial form for along while. I tried this recipe and it's better than the one I buy.
The second time I made it, I did increase the garlic, salt, and the chiles a bit, by about 50%, I like it that way, and my wife prefers the original, milder version.

I made this salsa and kept to the exact proportions suggested by original maker. The cup of olive oil was too much. The result was; the olive oil rose to the top and I kept having to mix it, then it would rise to the top again. I wasnâ€™t impressed with the salsa, but if I were to make it again, I would probably go with 1/3 olive oil and add more if needed.

I wasn't sure what to expect from this recipe since it was made of olive oil. My family was pleasantly surprised! Full of flavor...we will definitely be using this recipe again

A perfect salsa for grilled steaks and no doubt other grilled meats. My serranos were small so I used six which resulted in the perfect amount of heat.
