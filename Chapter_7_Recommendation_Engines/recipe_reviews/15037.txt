Made 2 nut recipes from this site. The glazed nuts and these. Brought both into the office and had a taste test.  These won hands down. Taste just like the candied pecans you get on a salad in a fancy restaurant. Will be taking to parties as host/hostess gifts wrapped in pretty cellophane with a sprig of pine and a bow. Thanks.

I wanted a recipe to dress up some leftover nuts I had from holiday baking (walnuts, whole almonds, and pecans). I threw it together at the last minute for my Superbowl party as people were coming in the door. It was SO quick and So easy and SOOO delicious!! Don't be surprised when it looks horrible as it starts cooking, cause it's not too pretty. However, I followed the directions to a T, and they came out wonderful!!Everyone loved them, and a few people left with the recipe! I will be making bags/tins of these for gifts next Christmas! Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent. This has a nice light and crunchy texture and taste, and what I love about this recipe is that you can take your time to evenly coat the nuts (and you can noticeably see which ones you've coated), while a lot of other candied nut recipes involving using the stovetop, you are required to work very quickly to coat the nuts before the mixture hardens. I compared these candied nuts with the stovetop candied nuts, and the feedback was that these ones tasted more unique! I also personally prefer the texture, look and taste of these ones. I will definitely be making these again

I found this to be a good recipe, but, I used
1/2 the amount of butter and they came out great -
less rich but more puffy with meringue (prettier
too).

Yum! I made these a night ago and I've eaten half of them already on my own. I used almonds (plus some flaked almonds) as I ran out of nuts so I also had to halve the recipe after I realised.  I followed the recipe word for word after that and it came out great!  It doesn't sound like it will work but it does!

These are wonderful! Just like the ones you can buy fresh and warm in the mall. I added cinnamon, nutmeg and ground ginger to the egg mixture before adding the nuts. I'll be packaging these for Christmas gifts this year, they are that good!

I've made "sugared nuts" before and thought I'd try something a bit different.  I don't even like nuts very well but I can't stop eating these!  Even my daughter (2 years) who won't eat regular nuts enjoys these.  I made a batch by mixing walnuts and pecans.  My favorite are the pecans, but both are excellent.  I added a cup of the finished product to my Chex Mix recipe this year and guests want to know what the sweet flavor is that they enjoy in the mix!  These nuts are easy, store well in a sealed container and are difficult to sample because "just one more" keeps popping into my head!

It's February 1st and I'm craving these nuts now!  I made them for my holiday gift baskets and they were a huge hit!  A little strange looking when you first start mixing the nuts with the egg whites and put them on the 'swimming in butter' tray.  But it all makes sense as you begin to toss them every half hour.

I quadrupled the recipe and turned pecans, walnuts and almonds into Swedish Nuts.  They were incredible additions to my gift baskets.  They are a new tradition I'm adding to my recipe box for family and friends!

Oh and as much as you'll be tempted to, for the sake of calories...don't skimp on the butter.  The butter helps to brown and crisp the nuts.  The batch I skimped on, its easy to tell the difference.  They didn't brown as much and looked more beige than brown.  You don't want that.

This is it! This is the spiced nut recipe I have been searching for. The only change I made to the recipe was to line my baking sheet w/ parchment paper before melting teh butter. Then I could just remove the pecans from the oven & let them cool on the baking pan w/out fear of them sticking. I added some dried cranberries to half the batch & loved teh addition. Thanks Joanie Critchlow!

Very good and easy.  I was using pecans from my pecan tree and didn't know how much a pound was.  It's about 3 1/2 cups in case anyone else needs to know!

I always get requests to make these and pecans are best.  Other than that I tweak it different each time. Like instead of 1 cup white sugar try half cup white & half cup light brown sugar for a little more flavour. Or substituting the vanilla extract for almond and adding a dash of ginger. Hard to mess this delicious recipe up. Be prepared to get hooked on them.

My brother had "candied pecans" listed as one of his indulgences on his Christmas wish list, so I made a pound of this recipe for him.  He was in heaven and wouldn't share any with the rest of his family.  Guess he's getting some for his birthday too.  I added a half a teaspoon of cinnamon for extra flavor.  Be careful, it's easy to eat the whole batch at once.. it's that good.

I made an initial batch of egg white mixture and it never did get glossy and stiff.  So I threw it away and tried again, thinking some egg yolk was in the first batch.  The second batch, same result.  I was about to give up but I followed through with the rest of the recipe.  The mix didn't look nice at all while cooking but after it cooled - delicious!  I will make this again, even after that bad experience!

I have made these twice already and they are very good.  Easy and yummy to have around for snacks for any gathering.  I add an assortment of nuts, usually pecans, walnuts, cashews and almonds.  I just keep adding nuts until the egg white mixture will coat what I have in bowl without too much left over.  I also add cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice and cloves to the mix (a sprinkling of each before I add the nuts).  I haven't tried it without but i think the spices help the flavour a lot. When they come out of the oven I give them a generous sprinking with cinnamon sugar.  This makes a lot of nuts but they keep well in tupperware for a couple of weeks.  Thanks!

I love these nuts!  I used 1/2 cup Splenda, 1/2 cup sugar and they were even lighter...just watch as they cook more quickly.

My book group is discussing Stieg Larsson's "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" tomorrow night, so I made these Swedish Nuts to go with the Swedish theme.  They were very easy to make, and they are absolutely delicious!!  Crispy, nutty, and sweet--who doesn't love that? Even if they do taste a bit Christmasy and this is August...  But still, I can't wait to put them out with the Swedish meatballs and Swedish fish (the candy, not lutefisk) that I'll also be serving!

Very yummy! They looked very white in the beginning but they do actually darken to a nice brown. I used 1/2 the butter and was still very delicious.

These were pretty good, I used 3/4 cup splenda instead of the sugar.  I would like to make them again adding cinnamon, cumin and cayenne pepper for a spicy sweet treat.

I have made these with mixed nuts out of a can. I deleted the salt and kind of brushed off the excess salt from the nuts. Easy!!

I made this for an after theater get together and they were a huge hit! I kept hearing "who made the nuts?" My friend's husband particularly loved them.  I'm making some tomorrow for a baby shower and I'll send extra home with my friend for her hubby.

These are delicious.  I'v made them using Splenda in place of the sugar.  But, my favorite variation is to use 2 teaspoons of orage extract in place of the vanilla and add 2 teaspoons of cinnamon.  Yummy.

These were just okay. We ate them and liked them well enough, but I will never use this recipe again.

I have a new addiction. These were fantastic. I'm not sure I beat the egg mixture correctly because the nuts were covered in this white slime mixture. However, after it bakes it becomes translucent

I make these every year to give as gifts.  They are wonderfully good to snack on when you need a little bit of sweet.  **Note: Keep a careful watch when you toast the nuts-- they go from toasted to burnt in no time! Same goes when baking:  pay close attention to the nuts or else the butter can burn and ruin the whole batch.

Fantastic! Reminds me of a recipe my mother used to make when I was a child.  I substituted some brown sugar for some of the white sugar, and added a little cinnamon to taste.  I also sprinkled some cinnamon/white sugar mixture on during the last 5 minutes of baking.  Can't wait to try them in a mandarin orange/chicken salad with dried cranberries and a sesame orange dressing.  Yum!

I made these for a birthday party.  It was a huge hit!  By the end of the party everyone wanted the recipe.  I gave this recipe five stars, not only for the taste, but also because it was so easy to make.  I sprinkled a little extra sugar over them after they had cooked and were still a little warm.  Great recipe! Thanks! I will be making these again for Christmas!

Either people loved them or hated them.  I personally loved them, they were all gone before we came home from church, so the majority of people enjoyed them.  Very easy to make too!

These are SO good!  I made them for a progressive dinner (we were making appetizers) and everyone loved them.  I ate the leftovers the next day (I ate way too many)!  These were excellent for the holidays and I will probably make them again soon!

Wow, are these sweet!  I made the recipe as written, but I think they need some cinnamon or other spice, and maybe also some cayenne to temper the sweetness.  They're easy enough to make and bake up nicely, although a lot of my coating fell off the nuts as I stirred them.

These are fantastic! I added a sprinkle of allspice and a dash cinnamon to the mixture before coating the nuts. They make wonderful homemade Christmas gifts in my family. Easy enough to make all  year round, but I save them for the holidays. People get so excited when they see them!

Wonderful. I made them last year and again this year, and everyone seems to love them! I followed the recipe exactly, and made 3 pounds of nuts, with almonds, pecans, and walnuts. I wouldn't suggest almonds, as they don't stay coated very well.

This is a fabulous recipe, and it is so easy and fast. I made one batch following the recipe, but cutting the amount of butter to half. I liked this, which put more meringue on the nuts as someone else suggested. However, the second batch was made with cinnamon and a dash of cayenne also suggested by someone else. It was also delicious. Since I was going to a Christmas lunch with friends, I quickly bagged some in ziploc snack bags, folded the closing strip under the bag, and tied a wide red ribbon around the plastic bag. Arriving at the luncheon a bit early, I placed one at each place setting. Everyone was thrilled and the table looked a bit more festive. Thanks for the recipe.

Thank you so much for this recipe. Aussies not used to this kind of Xmas treat - and I felt like a genius. Very popular with family and friends.  Roll on Xmas 2007
Added a little chilli powder which gave it a beautiful kick

Finally, a spiced nuts "keeper" recipe. They were crispy and subtly flavored. I used walnuts instead of pecans, added some cinnamon & a dash of cayenne, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Watch out your oven isn't too hot, as they can burn easily. Thank you Joanie Critchlow for posting this.

These nuts are great! The first time I made them I burned them. I didn't even want to serve them, but my sister in law loved them even burnt. I have made them a couple of times since and each time they have come out perfectly. I think my oven runs hot so I lowered the temp to 300. Last time I made them I added cayenne pepper to them for a sweet spicy flavor and they were a hit! Made them again today regular and they are already gone. So easy and impressive!

AMAZING!  Very easy and absolutely delicious.  I tried it with almonds also, but I like the pecans much better.  These are a big hit with anyone who likes nuts.  Warning: they are very addictive!!!

Awesome, awesome. Everyone loved this recipe, so glad I tried it. Thank you Joanie, its a definate keeper. I plan trying almonds the next time. I used two 10 oz. bags of pecans, and they still were great. You gotta try these. I hit the wrong button on the rating, so sorry, It a definate 5

I love these.  They are so easy, delicious, and addictive.  Can easily use 2 1bs of pecan halves.  Have given out at Christmas and make for other special occasions.

Love these!  I made these for New Year's Eve and they were eaten up in minutes.  Made them again for another gathering a week later and again they were gone in minutes.  I used the pecans and loved them.  I thought they look beautiful, especially how the sugar hardened into the cracks of the pecans.  My 7 year old son said they looked like they were topped with snow.  Excellent recipe Joanie! Thanks a bunch.

I beat everything in the blender, so needless to say it never got stiff or formed peaks.  They came out fantastic despite this, and I was so pleased with the results.  I like to thrown them in a ziploc and keep a stash in my car for those mid-drive cravings.  Thanks for the simple, delicious recipe!

I made this with toasted mixed nuts, and it was very, very good.  The vanilla was a good touch.  It was ALMOST as good as a recipe given to me many years ago, by a friend.  I'll submit it in the future, in the hopes it will be accepted by the Allrecipes staff.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

These are great.  However my first batch got a little too brown because of the butter. The second time, I only used 1/2 the amount of butter and they were so much prettier.  I also used walnuts instead of pecans.  I like them better.

I think these will be good.  I am still letting them cool.  I did substitute Swerve sugar substitute for the sugar since I am diabetic and trying to stay very low carb.  They seem a little sticky yet.  I may try them on a larger sheet pan next time.

This is everyone's favorite. I gave jars of these for small office gifts and people put the jar back on my desk with their names on it for refills. It's also my family's favorite too. I make it just as written, many times over. It has been years since I've made it but plan to make them again this year and I buy my pecans in bulk at Costco, it's the most cost effective way to buy them.

SOOOOO... Easy!!  They were a big hit with the guys especially.  I loved the idea of being able to make them a few days ahead of time and then put them in a gallon ice cream bucket till the holidays.  Will be made anytime we have guests, just as a nice snack.

After 24 minutes, my nuts were done.  I wrapped these in decorative baggies and gave them out as gifts at Christmas.  I've received NUMEROUS recipe requests.  P.S.  I LOVE them, too!!!

Cannot get eggs to peak and glossy after adding sugar. Used two different methods (first all at once and second attempt a little a time). Eggs always went "flat" but remained glossy. Didn't attempt to bake since unsure what result would be.

I took these to a fall themed supper club last night and they were a hit.  I followed the directions exactly as written.  These nuts are quick and easy to make and I will be sharing them with many others over the holidays.

These were great!  As another reviewer commented, they don't look too pretty but taste yummy.  I used walnuts instead of pecans because I mistakenly bought them instead.  Would use walnuts again 'cuz they're cheaper.
