I followed the recipe exactly. I made this for our son who has type I diabetes and is also gluten sensitive. He didn't care for it as much as several other recipes. I plan to try it again using different flours, perhaps a combination of brown and white rice flour and some teff. We find buckwheat to have a strong flavor. It made a very heavy loaf and for our taste needed spices, perhaps cinnamon, clove and cardamon. I appreciate the gluten free recipe and lack of added oil.

My husband has been on a very limited diet do to allergies... No wheat, corn, rice flours just to name a few. This one works great for us! Easy to prepare.  I added blueberries once because raisins are an allergen. I also added nutmeg for some additional spice!

Very good texture and flavor. I put the raisins on top. Used rice flour instead of teff flour. I will try this again!

I did not use slivered almonds but whole almonds I loosely pounded. I just like the texture better than slivers. The bread is amazing. Perfect texture for a non yeast bread and the Buckwheat taste is great. You'd never know there is zucchini in it!
