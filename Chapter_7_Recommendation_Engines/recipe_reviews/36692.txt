I thought this sandwich was INCREDIBLE! I love Portabello sandwiches and this was SO easy and delicious. I'm a new vegeterian so this will definately become a fave of mine. I actually  toasted the sourdough bread with the provolone cheese in the toaster oven so the cheese was niely melted. I also added a shake or two of oregano to the basil mayo in addition to the fresh basil. Also I tossed the roasted peppers in the skillet for the last two minutes of cooking, just enough to get them hot. I admit it was a bit sloppy to eat but totally delicious

My husband and I really enjoyed these sandwiches!  I served them on hard rolls instead of sourdough.  I loved the basil mayo.  I think I would make it ahead of time and let the flavors blend but it was still very good.  I'd also would heat up the red peppers with the mushrooms so the temperature of the vegatables was consistent throughout the sandwich.  We'll have these again!

Prepared for a vegetarian meal and wife and I both loved this. I also added the peppers to the mushrooms just to bring up to temp.  Also added just a sprinkle of balsamic vinegar at the end.  Great recipe Thanks.

I tried this and modified it a bit.  I added a bit of whorstechire and garlic w/ mushrooms and fried onions separately.  Additionally, I used a sub roll instead to make it more like a cheesteak and added a bit of horseradish to the spread and it was FANTASTIC!!!

I sauted mushrooms, onions, sliced red peppers, & garlic together.  Served on pita pocket instead of sourdough bread, and used shredded mossorella.  More friendly for those of us who are weight watching.  Very tasty.

Not exactly what I was expecting....there wasn't as much as a mushroom taste as I would have liked, and the mayo and bell peppers seemed a little overpowering.  If I were to make it again, I would warm up the peppers a bit, and slightly toast the bread in the oven.

Absolutely fantastic!  I substituted fresh red peppers for the bottled roasted peppers and sauteed them along with the mushrooms and onions, and it worked out wonderfully!

Very nice light meal~ the onions and mushrooms (not a pepper fan) were really flavorful... I didn't even really need the basil-mayonnaise, next time I'll probably do without. Am making this again soon with the leftover mushrooms.

Awesome! I used basil pesto in place of the basil mayo because I needed to use it up and it was great! I am making them again tonight. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Great recipe! I followed other reviewer's suggestions and heated the red peppers with the mushrooms and onions. I also shredded the provolone and heated it with the vegetable mixture (helps the messiness by make everything stick together a bit) until it bubbled. In the future I would slice the mushrooms thinner and cut the peppers into smaller pieces so that you get a bit of each flavor with each bite.

Love the concept of this recipe! Added balamic vinegar and soy sauce to the cooking mushrooms to give it more "meaty" taste, and skipped the mayo entirely. Also roasted a red pepper on the gas stove and added it to the sandwich--a delicious and healthy "steak" treat.

We put these babies on the grill along with sliced tomatoes. Once grilled we topped the cheesy mushrooms with the tomatoes, raw red onions a little marinara sauce and served on toasted portugese rolls. Fantastic and thanks!

OOOOH!  One word: A-MA-ZING! I'm on Weight Watchers so I slightly changed this recipe to try to cut down even furthur on calories and fat.  I sub'd english muffins for the bread and used Veggie Slices Provolone (soy cheese) instead of the real provolone.  Toasted the muffins before assembling.  Once assembled I microwaved them for 50 seconds or so until the soy cheese melted (this also brings the peppers up to the temperature of the rest of the sandwich). YUM! The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was because it was super messy to eat.

This recipe has potential, but it is not a 5 star yet.  Next time, I will buy the large portobellos, and saute them with some garlic and perhaps a bit of fresh oregano, along with the onions and roasted peppers and perhaps crushed red pepper and S&P.

I did not make the basil mayo for this recipe because I forgot to buy some fresh basil.  I did use some hummus in place of the mayo.  I love portabello mushrooms, but this recipe needs a little extra something in the mushroom/onion mixture.  Some spice or marinade or something. I will definately make again and continue experimenting to get that little extra something it needs.

Good eats!  I added the peppers to the pan just long enough to warm them.  Didn't even use cheese and though messy, it was wonderful (as most messy things are).

Excellent sandwich! My husband and I are new vegetarians and this meal makes us glad we are. Very quick and easy to make and tastes delicious. I only used a fraction of the mayo, though.

My girlfriend and I thought this receipe was great.  It was easy to fix and tasted wonderful.  We will definately be having it again.  I used pita bread and put them between paper towels int he microwave to make them soft.  I also left out the onion by request of my girlfriend and they were still excellent.

Scrumpious!  Even my meat-eating friends thought this was wonderful.  My only change was to marinate the mushrooms with balsamic vinegar and olive oil before cooking.  Drop the mayo, the sandwich is good enough it doesn't need all the sugar that fat-free mayo brings with it.

These were fantastic!!!  I have "veg-tendencies" and am always looking for veg recipes that taste like "real" food.  This is definately a keeper! I tweeked it a little too...made the mayo with dried basil an hour ahead, heated the peppers with the mushroom/onion mixture for the last 2 minutes and toasted the bread.  I wouldn't change anything else though.  The flavors from each ingredient blended perfectly.

These sandwiches are awesome! I didn't have any fresh basil, so I used dried-I would recommend making the mayo w/ basil ahead of time if you use dried. A great, easy, different recipe!

The mushrooms were a bit too juicy for my taste, but my boyfriend really liked it. So I suppose I'll be making it again but be warned the juices were running down my arms so probably not kid friendly.

These were excellent! My boyfriend and I both loved them.  I mixed the basil and mayo ahead of time and chilled it for about an hour to blend the flavors.  We used all of the mayo that was called for because our bread was sort of dry. Try this!!!

my husband and I loved these :)though the recipe calls for way too much mayo for us . we only 
used about 1/2 the amount of mayo/basil called for . These are excellant and we will be making them again !

This was the best portobello mushroom sandwich ever.  The basil mayo and provolone cheese give it a unique flavor.

This sandwich was pretty spectacular. I served it over flat pretzel bread with pepper jack cheese, and sauteed the bell peppers with the mushroom and onion. I also added about 1/2 a teaspoon each of dried parsley, dried oregano, and garlic powder (for lack of fresh garlic) to the basil mayonnaise dressing. The end result was admittedly very messy, but absolutely delicious. I never knew mushroom could taste so good!

I mixed up the mayo ahead of time and marinated the onions and mushrooms in balsamic and olive oil, and then added oregano, salt, and pepper when I sauteed them. Left out the red peppers b/c I don't like them, and the cheese b/c I didn't have any. Still, fabulous sandwiches!!! I've already made them twice since getting this recipe a week ago.

Pretty good recipe.  I put the filling on focaccia bread and grilled it in a panini press.

These were pretty  good.  I used old world green/black olive and gruyere cheese bread, and added some montreal steak seasoning to the mushrooms and onions for flavor.

I've made this several times now, and each time we've been thoroughly satisfied. I only use half the amount of mushrooms suggested, but my husband and I find that's enough for both of us. I also use a whole fresh red bell pepper (which I sautee) instead of bottled. The basil-pepper-mayo and provolone complement the other flavors perfectly. It makes for a great light, though somewhat drippy, dinner.

These were definitely a hit.  I was worried my "meat & potatoes" husband would think it was missing something so I added 1/3 lb. shaved angus beef from the deli right at the end.  I served on soft hoagie rolls that I toasted under the broiler.  Will definitely make again.

This was such a great recipe!  Thank you so much.  It was quick, easy, and delicious.  The only thing I did different was I placed the sandwich on my foreman grill and pressed it.  That way, the bread was toasted and everything melted together.  Thanks again for the recipe!

Instead of making a sandwich, I grilled the onion & mushrooms & added them to pasta w/marinara sauce. It was great!
