This is exactly how I make my breakfast sausage from ground turkey only I do go a little lighter on the salt/pepper. My whole family loves this. NOTE: This can be used in just about any recipe that calls for sausage, just don't form the meat into patties. I like to use it in spaghetti sauce or egg bakes the most. My family honestly can't tell the difference between this and regular pork sausage.

I was looking for a good recipe to make my own sausage and this one is a GREAT starter recipe. I used all of the ingredients with the exception of the brown sugar. (Watching our sugar intake) However with that said, I replaced that with apple pie spice, dried fennel seed, and a touch of paprika. Those spices have natural sweetness to them. Since ground turkey can be dry due to the lack of fat, I patted the sausage out and allowed them to rest in the refrigerator over night to tenderize and soak up all of the flavors. The sausage came out great!!! I cooked them on a non-stick griddle with a touch of EVOO and they came out yummy!!! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

Family loved it. Only used 1 tsp of salt as husband needs to watch sodium. Also added 1/4 tsp of ground ginger. Definitely will make again, and will mix it up the night before so the flavors can blend a bit more before cooking.

Absolutely spot on in the seasonings for this sausage.  I didn't have marjaram so left that out but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I made the Jimmy Dean Breakfast casserole with it and it was divine.  Everyone who ate it thought the sausage was delicious.

This was absolutely wonderful. We only added less than a 1/2 tsp of salt and didn't put in the brown sugar. Also we included a teaspoon of McCormick Maple Smokehouse seasoning as well as their Cajun seasoning. Instead of pan frying we lightly spray greased a an oven sheet and baked them, flipping occasionally. 
Overall this recipe was terrific! For a large family who is transitioning to much healthier choices this was a recipe that satisfied everyone. I'm convinced that we won't be buying sausage anymore

I love this recipe!  I've tried several versions of homemade turkey sausage over the years and this one is by FAR my favorite.  I made it exactly as written.

I thought this was a very good base recipe. I used regular 85/15 ground turkey, added garlic powder, onion powder, Worcestershire sauce, ground savory, Mrs Dash lemon pepper, and ground ginger. I also upped the rest of the herbs. I do think it's a bit sweet so next time I'll cut back to 1 tsp sugar and add 1 tsp molasses. I may add some ground sumac, and ground mustard, too. 
Those of you with dry sausage may have a couple of problems:
Using ground turkey *breast*. There isn't enough fat to keep the sausage moist. Add some oil, or softened butter, and you'll be back in business!
Giving in to the temptation to squish the patties down while cooking. Never do that, with any kind of party! If it's not flat enough then fix that in the forming stage, not the cooking stage. It squeezes all the juices into the pan :-(
Or you could be simply overcooking it. Make sure you keep an eye on these, and use a timer if you have to. I have two little kids, so timers are common here!

My family flipped out, it was sooooooooo freaking delish!  I will never settle for the bland, premade turkey patties that you find at the supermarket.  I made this recipe last night as an alternate lower fat breakfast option that I could eat this coming week, as I have begun diet number 42.  I choose to alter it a bit by doubling all of the spices, plus I added 1 teaspoon each of fennel and ginger just for kicks because I had them on-hand.  I went an extra step and ground all of the seasoning in my spice grinder (aka former coffee grinder) to help with combining.  I made them all two ounces to aid in portion control, but I guess that only works if you limit how many you eat at one meal, which is not easy my friend!  I went ahead and made another batch of the seasoning mix and bagged it up for a future use, which will be very soon!  Thanks for "my" new secret family recipe!

Made this twice and tweaked it just a bit. I added 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, 1/4 tsp garlic powder and 1/2 tsp onion powder. This has great flavor. Keeper!

Used 1 pound of turkey instead of 2.  Used 1 tsp. Salt and pepper.  Add 1/2 tsp. garlic, because we love garlic in everything.  Kept all other measurements the same.  

Tastes JUST LIKE REAL SAUSAGE, BUT BETTER!!! My husband went on and on about how good this is.  All kids ate it up.  This is now my go to recipe for sausage.  I will never buy store  brought again.  Thank you for submitting this recipe.

For those who mentione dry patties, check to see if your  turkey  is  85/15.  If you buy ground  turkey  any leaner than that  it may fry up on the dry side, because  there  is  less  fat (96/4).  Hope this helps.

Flavor was great! However my turkey was super dry. Not sure what I did wrong.  I will use this recipe again but will use ground pork instead.

This was my first time trying to make sausage and I choose this recipe because of the ingredients. I made a few changes and will make a few more to suite my taste. I like more heat and added more red pepper flakes and also more sage, brown sugar and thyme. Guess you can say I like my more hearty! I would recommend this recipe and have since my first try. Will be making a batch this weekend and freezing half for next week. Thanks!!!!

absolutely fantastic!!  i only use 1 lb of turkey (so in essence the spices - except for the salt - are doubled as another reviewer said).  also i fried them in a pan but they were a little dry.  however, when i made them on the panini grill, they turned out simply perfect.  they tasted even better when reheated in the microwave (i think the flavors had a chance to settle in).  will never buy breakfast sausages again!

Added a bit more heat because we like things spicy; however, really great recipe! Also, used basic oregano for the marjoram (essentially the same thing)!

Best turkey sausage I've ever eaten. I put a pinch more sage in mine, because I like it that way. The brown sugar makes all the difference. I'll be making this forever.

We don't buy ready-made breakfast sausage anymore! I make them on the weekend and freeze them, uncooked,  between layers of parchment paper in a gallon ziplock bag for breakfast during the week.

This is great! I mixed the ingredients together, pattied it out, and put it in the freezer. When I want to cook a couple of pieces, I defrost them in the microwave, then fry them in a skillet with a touch of oil! I highly recommend these!

I make this almost every morning for my boyfriend, and I. We love it!! We either do not shape the patties, and have it as a side to an omelet, and french toast, or we do make them into patties, and we make breakfast, brunch, or even burgers for dinner! Very yum! I would recommend

I really like this recipe!  I am making it for the second time today.  My husband ate it though he only likes pork sausage, but at least he ate it and said it was good (picky about certain things).  I'm happy because now I can make my favorite coffee shop drive thru breakfast on those mornings when I leave empty stomached.  Turkey sausage, fried egg, cheese in a small tortilla wrap.  So good.  Thanks for the recipe.  I did add minced garlic because - well, why not!
Updated 11/2017-  I make this all the time, this is my go-to turkey sausage and breakfast sausage recipe .

I thought these tasted good, but honestly felt like it was more reminiscent of a turkey burger in flavor than a sausage patty. There is another recipe for turkey sausage on the site, that I tweak and make a bit sweeter that I liked more. This has more of a heat taste to it. I followed the recipe exactly, only making 1/2 recipe and further cutting the hot red pepper flakes in half. Glad I did that, because these were plenty hot. The cook times were way off. I sat over the stove 25 plus minutes. At temp 7 they wanted to burn. At low, or temp 3, the internal temp would not move. Something in-between that would be good. I felt like I was standing over the stove forever. I finally gave up on my thermometer registering the best temp, because the patties would have been completely dry at that time. If I made again, I would add more sweetener, less heat, and probably broil them. The salt and pepper could be reduced some too. I got 9 thick patties and cooked them in 1 tablespoon of grapeseed oil. Loved the calories count at 91 each, including the cooking oil, using lean turkey meat. I may make these in the future, with the intent for sandwiches though and stick to my other recipe for breakfast.

Turkey sausage certainly is a healthy option to pork sausage.  It's very lean, so if you want something visually appetizing, add just a little bit of oil to the skillet so it browns nicely.  This was good, not my favorite, but it's still worthy of a 4-star rating.

This recipe has really good balanced flavors. I like to mix it and let it set for a while to allow the flavors to blend. I also use a tablespoon of bacon fat to fry it in. It takes away the dryness,  adds some great flavor, and still works for a Paleo or Whole 30 diet (minus the sugar). Yum!

These are magnificent and my husband said they were as good as pork sausages!  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  We now keep them in the freezer to have every morning for breakfast.  High protein and low calorie for training diet.

Loved this recipe! Didn't have marjoram so I substituted with a small amount of oregano and it was great. I'll add marjoram next time and see what the difference will make.

I accidentally bought regular frozen ground turkey, instead of turkey sausage.  I didn't add the brown sugar, but this is a great recipe!

Saved my Christmas stuffing!

Just made this for breakfast . Our household is transitioning to leaner meats, this was perfect. The only change I made is , when I mixed the ingredients into the turkey I added about 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of organic maple syrup into the mixture. I really enjoyed the recipe , even my four year old loved it.

My wife loves it and after tasting myself it's better than any sausage bought in the store.  Did not have ground thyme and will cut back on the salt. Thanks This recipe is great.  Ideas are flowing now.

Tried this recipe and loved it. I always liked spicy sausage so I added a dash of cayenne and some maple syrup.  The sausage was delicious and my family loved it too.

Winner Winner Turkey Breakfast Sausage!!! Followed the recipe as written (to be fair I did halve the whole recipe cause I didn't want to waste 2 pounds of turkey in case we didn't like it). Great blend of spices.  May tinker around the next time but as written great flavor.

I liked this recipe, however, next time I'll add more sage.  Also maybe a bit more brown sugar.  We enjoyed them on Smart Buns with a fried egg on top.  This recipe is a keeper.

Found the ground meat to be loose, so added an egg to bind the patties. Also added freshly ground ginger and fresh minced onion.

Tastes so much better than store bought turkey sausage and close to pork sausage. Only had 1 LB of turkey so I cut all spices in half. After frying a mini patty to taste test I decided to add just a hint more sage and a bit of extra red pepper flakes. That's all I changed. Tastes great!

I only had 1 lb of turkey, so I halved the spices. I left out the sugar, and realized I didn't have any sage. So, I added more flavor by sauteing half a small onion and a few chopped mushrooms to add to the sausage mix.  Delicious! Next time I'll try it the same way, but add in the sage. I used lean turkey, so it got a bit dry, but we didn't mind.

Great recipe!  I dislike people who completely modify the recipe but I had to because I only had 1lb of turkey so  I used  1.5 t. poultry seasoning, and 3.5 t of white sugar. It wasn't dry like another rater stated.  I will definitely make again, so much cheaper and no preservatives.  Thanks for posting this recipe!

I was skeptical, so I only did 1 lb instead of 2 adjusting seasoning to match.  YES!  This taste like the real deal.  I gave up beef and (sadly) pork, but there are things I really miss like breakfast sausage.  This does it for me.  I didn’t have marjoram, so made do without, but I can only imagine how much better it’ll be next time when I add it.  A few reviewers said it was little dry, so I added a dose of Olive oil, and I took the advice of another reviewer and did not buy lean turkey.  I will definitely be making this again.

Costco was out of turkey sausage so hubby brought home organic ground turkey.  Discovered this recipe and raided our herb garden to try it out.  The results were outstanding and we now have a very easy and affordable recipe to create organic breakfast sausage!!  It saved my sausage and cornbread stuffing recipe for Thanksgiving and the whole family wanted the recipe to make their own from now on as well!!  So excited to have found this.  The fresh herbs made the sausage absolutely delicious.  Added just a little bit more (i.e. 2 teaspoons instead of 1-1/2, or 1 teaspoon instead of 1/2).

I have made this several times for my family. My husband and toddler especially enjoy this. Flavorful and tender, they can be prepped ahead of time to cook in the morning or if they are already cooked, a quick spin in the microwave does the trick. For kids, just omit the red pepper flakes and you're good to go.

Very easy. I did not have red pepper. I think it would have been better  with it. This was much better than the commercial  product

The flavor was not quite perfect, but I think that's just a personal preference. They were way better than other recipes I've tried, for sure. I think I would add a little more sage next time and consider a bit of fennel. I cooked it as crumbles to use in a casserole, but I think it would be great as patties, also. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved the recipe but when I made the turkey sausage; the taste was rather mild. I ended up adding garlic, more red pepper, sage, pepper and some seasoning salt.

Flavor was really great but mine wound up super dry (as some other reviewers mentioned). I understand that's the part of the nature of working with turkey meat but it was so dry (not over-cooked, I was very careful) it wasn't good-eating alone, we could only eat it mixed in with something that had moisture, like eggs or biscuit gravy.

This was a recipe of opportunity, we had 1lb of ground turkey left from another recipe.  We halved this and the flavors were great. Have to work on cook time since our came out a bit dry.  Thank you!!!

I found this recipe a couple of years ago and make it almost weekly. I follow it closely - sometimes changing it up with bourbon smoked paprika and bourbon smoked sugar. I always put in a bit of liquid smoke (yes, there is a theme of smoked flavor going on here!) The only other change is I use  Peter pepper instead of red pepper flakes - as that is what we grow each year.

I really like this recipe.  
I used lean ground chicken instead of turkey.  find that mixing in seasoning and sitting in fridge for a couple of hours before cooking is best.

I thought I'd give this a try after the wonderful reviews, but  both my husband and I felt it had no flavor whatsoever.  Not enough seasoning and I didn't even eat mine.  Rest went in the trash.  I have other recipes for this that are much better.

This is excellent. I used ground turkey. Made it as is and will adjust just a little to my taste next time. It was a little spicer then I like but my son loved the heat.  Great taste to the finished product.

Wow! I've never made sausage before so I was very happy when I ate it and it tastes like sausage! I followed the recipe except did not use any sugar and replaced the marjoram with oregano, since I didn't have marjoram.

A tad too salty for my taste. And if you don't want spicy sausage, lessen the pepper flakes. It was a bit spicier than I expected. Overall, this is a great recipe without all the chemicals. Thank you for sharing.

I like this low-fat recipe as opposed to the traditional pork sausage; however, I feel the spices were not enough to make the sausage as robust as I would have liked it. Maybe next time I'll add more red pepper flakes and sage, and a little less thyme.

Excellent, but as was noted, cut the sage by at least half. My wife loves sage and still said it was too much. I will cut it to 1/3 next time. I put in a little (1/8 tsp) like I saw in some other recipes and I thought it was good.

We made it with Turkey 93% Fat Free and it was absolutely delicious.  We mixed it and made patties the night before we cooked it and I imagine that it helped the flavors intensify.  It was so good!

I have made it twice now and everyone loves it!  I keep it ground and use it for breakfast burritos and tonight for the super bowl we are putting it in our cheese dip!  I made enough for tomorrow morning to use in our breakfast hash brown muffin since I am feeding 7 hungry college students! Love its versatility for me too since I am gluten free.

Delicious! Make sure you take note that the recipe calls for 2 lb of turkey. I accidentally doubled the sugar before I realized this so my patties tasted a bit like they had some maple syrup on them. I am sure my kids will not complain, haha!

Love this recipe. I did modify. I make a big batch , 3 lbs turkey and 1 lb ground chicken to add more flavor and moisture. I double up the seasoning , except the sage, I add only 1 tbs. I make large patties and put them in parchement paper in the freezer, take out just  few as needed. Thanks so much for sharing this one, my family and friends love it. AND I eat it for breakfast everyday...slice of garden tomato and large green leaf lettuce, perfect low carb high protien breakfast!

Excellent recipe! Thank you.Just like the store bought flavor after making it a bit more spicy. I added cayenne pepper too. I have thrown so much money at the store bought turkey sausages. No more! I made it from five pounds of turkey and doubled the spices. Still had to up them a bit as I like more spices. After that I could taste the store bought  taste that I like.I am good for a month now.One question though, I froze the patties and when reheated they are a bit on the dry side.Is there anything I can add to combat dryness. Bye bye to buying turkey sausages. I will make my own now, Great Recipe.

This is so good.  I love the fact that I know what is in it and it is fresh.  I used sea salt instead of Kosher salt because that is what I had on hand.  Next time I am going to try ground chicken.

This was a real life saver.  It tastes exactly the same.  Its amazing!  The only difference is the texture is a little bit dry but thats probably because their is hardly any grease.  So much healthier.  My husband even commented that it was tasty and he is a pork guy :)

Really good! I didn't  have any marjoram, and I accidentally added too much brown sugar, but it was still delicious. Made a few patties for breakfast and used the rest in spaghetti sauce. Very good -

only change I made was using half the salt due to dietary requirements.  This made excellent breakfast sausage patties.  I am looking forward to trying it for sausage gravy.

I have made this recipe numerous times for several pork sausage lovers.  I do omit the brown sugar.  They have all praised it.  Even my 80 year old mother-in-law, who hates ground turkey, loved it so much she asked for the recipe.  This is my go-to sausage recipe, now!

I like my sausage with fennel, so I could not help but add that in.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and the result was exactly how you expect good sausage to be.  This will be my go to recipe.

My whole family of six loves this recipe. It's very tasty. I wouldn't use breast unless you add some oil. I did without the oil and it was dry.  This recipe is fastly becoming a tradition for our weekend breakfast and its also great to prepare ahead of time to take camping. It was a big hit with the other family we went with.

This is the perfect mix of spices.   I will be making these from now on.  Next time I may leave the sugar out since I thought they tasted a little sweet. Thanks for sharing.

This is the best recipe I've found thus far for turkey sausage and now has become a hit in our home.  We've ditched the other sausages for the healthier version this recipe.

I have made this twice now it is that good!  I was amazed how much better this is than preseason kind which is too salty. I added extra the second time I made this, I added just a pinch of garlic and onion powder was awesome.  I make these for healthy breakfast sandwich and it makes them so yummy. Thank you for the great addition to my recipe box

We don't eat pork anymore but my husband & I both like sausage. This is the answer. I make sausage sandwiches for a weekend breakfast and we both think they are just as good as any naughty, fatty pork sausage you could have. Better since we don't have to feel guilty! I usually don't have marjoram on hand bot make them without and never miss it. I do go slightly heavy on the other seasonings but not much. I just usually add a tad more sage & thyme. We LOVE these. Start with naturally low fat ground turkey and still feel like you're really splurging.

This came out pretty good.  I used the ground turkey with the lowest fat and it came out a bit dry.  The family loved it, though, so I will definitely be trying again!

I will use this again and again.  We don't eat pork and the vegetarian sausages are too full of salt so I have missed breakfast sausage...that is until now.  I wanted to make it so badly but didn't have any sage; used poultry season instead, left out the salt altogether and added Truvia Baking Blend brown sugar.  What the brown sugar adds is not only a tiny bit of sweetness but the nice crispy brown that you get when you fry it.  I'm going to let it sit overnight, but I fried up a little one and it was delicious.  I'm so glad you posted this.

My family really enjoyed how the sausage came out even without the last three ingredients.  The sage, which I had, was the key. I also used onion and garlic powder and paparika. I will certainly make this again.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! I used lean turkey, not extra lean. I also cut the recipe in half so it would work with the 1.25-pound packages from the store. I divided it into 10 balls (5 servings), smooshed them in the heated pan (medium and sprayed with Pam) and cooked 3 minutes on one side and 4 minutes on the other. They could NOT have been better!

So yummy, thank you.  Very tasty and moist.  I might add a little more salt next time, but I used pre-packaged ground turkey and likely had more than 2 pounds.  I also might try just a touch of garlic.  Saving this recipe right now.

This sausage recipe is delicious!  I didn't use the reccomended amount of turkey as it is just my daughter and I.  Therefore I had to guess, we both like spice so I put it in until I could see & smell them.  It was so flavorful and moist, will definitely make this again.  Thank you for such a great  recipe!

I used a little Stevia instead of brown sugar because we are watching our sugar intake.  I added a bit more pepper and red pepper flakes, and I think I will add even more next time for a spicier sausage.  Still, it was tasty and I will definitely be making it again to avoid the chemicals in store-bought breakfast sausage.

this was very tasty.. immediately made me think poultry seasoning.. idk if i missed the ginger that is there in Mom's Turkey Sausage Patties.. but wouldn't mind adding it to this recipe next time or use the poultry seasoning and see if that reduces a step.. omitted the brown sugar per usual.. ty for the recipe.. 
~~UPDATE: this time i added 1/2 tsp of ginger and reduced the thyme to 1/2 tsp.. still left out the brown sugar and added just a bit more kosher salt.. very yummy.. ty again for the recipe

I made these for make ahead frozen breakfast sandwiches and they taste fantastic! Just like any breakfast sausage, except you know exactly what's in these. My only thing is that hey shrunk a lot while cooking so the potion sizing was off my for sandwiches, but that's something I should have thought of. These FREEZE WELL.

I did it exactly as the recipe said and it turned out amazing!  Tastes just like store-bought breakfast sausage except it has a little bit of a kick, so if you/your kids are sensitive to spice, maybe add a little less red pepper.  But it was delicious!

This is a great basic that I needed to start.  I used no salt, no sugar.  I did use organic ground turkey, poultry seasoning, granulated garlic, rubbed sage and a little thyme.  Red pepper flakes, and ground black pepper.    The patties were delicious, and intend on doing this again rather than buy from the store.  Thanks, Mike!
