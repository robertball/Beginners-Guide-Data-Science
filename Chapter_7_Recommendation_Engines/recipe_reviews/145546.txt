Wow, wow, wow....this is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had!  The combo of flavors is perfect.  I used the apricot preserves as called for (except sugar free) and will add a bit more next time.  Make sure to use your grill pan for the pretty grill marks.  This would be a wonderful sandwich for a luncheon or company.  I'm stuffed from eating it but already dreaming of the one I will make again tomorrow.  Thanks sweet tea, your my hero for the day!

Good sandwich but prefer to use mango chutney (a tangy one) in place of apricot preserves. The apricot was too sweet for our tastes.   I am sure other meats could replace the ham, e.g. turkey, chicken.

I made this as a late Friday evening supper.  I chose it simply due to the fact that it did not have a 1/4 - 1/2 cup of butter as the others did.  It is awesome.  Yummmm.    I made a few modifications based upon what was already in fridge. Used orange marmalade and spicy brown mustard :>. Also sprinkled just a bit of garlic on one slice of bread...what's a recipe without garlic.  Came out wonderful.  Now my husband gives this 4 star as he felt the orange marmalade was a bit too sweet.  But the recipe didn't call for orange marmalade!  I tried to find the mango chutney at a local grocery store to no avail.  I think next time I will just cut the amount of jam in half as it was really a nice complement to the brie.  We also needed to zap in microwave for 30 secs...didn't get hot enough.  This made perfect. Make sure your brie gets nice and hot and slightly runny.  Makes perfect.

Served a group of 20 lunch today... most knew there was something different about these sandwiches ... everyone loved them... no one guessed sugar free apricot preserves which is so good with the Brie Cheese... I used French bread and grilled them in the Panini press.  Big Hit!

This was good but it was missing something..I think I'll try the spicy chutney suggestion...I also used thick ham slices and I really feel like deli ham would have been better.  I will make again though, with those changes.

Sooo fabulous! The taste, texture, flavor = yumminess. I may cut back the mustard next time, but it was still excellent!

This was an absolutely delicious sandwich! I never would have thought to pair the apricot preserves with the brie ham and mustard! This was a huge hit with the guests, and is often requested! As a varation, I have also used granary bread (5 grain bread etc) and it tasted just as delicious!

Made this for dinner last night.  The Brie was a bit of a pain to work with but I did enjoy the experience of using olive oil to grill a sandwich instead of the usual butter.  That worked out fine and although the sandwich was pretty good, very filling and a nice change of pace from the usual, I doubt I'll make this one again unless I can find some tips on how to work with Brie cheese that doesn't include getting it all over myself prior to getting it on a sandwich.  If I do make this again, I will try the Mango Chutney suggestion because that sounds very tasty. Great sandwich, just a bit fussy to put together.

I haven't tried this yet, but one reviewer commented that Mango Chutney would be good. Try Mango Chutney, Black Forest ham, extra sharp white cheddar on sour dough. Delicious!

These were amazing. I made them on large croissants from Sam's Club, slathered jelly on both sides rolled up 4 pieces of Black Forest Ham and a large chunk of the brie in the middle with a generous dollop of dijon then popped them in the oven for about 5 minutes on 375 degrees, just enough to melt the brie and make the croissant crisp.  Easy for a large crowd.  We did trays of 15 and served fifty. They were a real hit.

I changed it a little, and what I made would have been a 4 and not a 5, but since I "lightened" it, I am sure the original would have been a 5.  Yum!  I think using SF preserves made it too watery though.  Won't do that next time.  I also used light butter instead of oil, and didn't have a grill pan so a plain skillet had to do...

I made this with double the amount of brie, so a 1/2 wedge per person... wasn't able to heat it up, but it was really good bread so it was still good, but I will make it again and grill it as I know it will be a MILLION times better... might try spiral ham too.

This was a really good sandwich, boys loved it.  We used jalapeno jelly instead of apricot preserves.  Just regular bread.   We also added a fried egg.

I'm not eating carbs so I ate without the bread and still very good.

This is awesome! I used peach jelly (it was all we had). The flavors of the jelly and the mustard complement each other really well. I would use thick cut ham in future as we used the thin shaved ham and the flavor was not strong enough

This looked like a gourmet sandwich but was so easy to make. Loved the tangy apricot preserves with the Brie. I will make again.

This was awesome!  I will definitely make it again.  I made it with  sliced open faced baguettes.  Pre toasted the bread first.  Then layered the slices with the Brie some orange marmalade and then thin sliced Black Forest ham put it back in the oven at 350 to melt the cheese.  Wow!  It took about 5 or 6 minutes to melt.  I forgot the mustard.

Mmmmmm! Cut back a little on the mustard. Also really good with raspberry preserves if no apricot in the house. If raspberry seeds are an issue for you, use seedless raspberry jam. For anybody with difficulty getting the brie to melt on the sandwich, heat your ham slices in a hot pan for just a few seconds to heat it up before layering the brie onto it.

This is VERY good.  I was hesitant about the apricot preserves, but IMO it was the best part.  Definitely on the to-do again list.

This is super yummy! Decadent! I think the key is to be patient and let the brie get gooey and hot. I make mine in a cast iron skillet like any grilled cheese. One may experiment with the preserves, amounts of ingredients etc. to suit individual tastes.  I have even put a few very thinly sliced apples on mine in addition to everything else.

i just made this because i just went shopping and i had some brie and didnt know what to do with it as its not something i eat all the time!It was ok, but i too think i need something else, not sure what maybe some spinach?
