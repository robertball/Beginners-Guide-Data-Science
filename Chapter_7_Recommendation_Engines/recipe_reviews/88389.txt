Wonderful change from your usual peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I used the last of the organic strawberries I had and homemade strawberry freezer jam. My son and I split it and wished we'd had more ingredients to make another. What a treat!

This was surprisingly good. I toasted two pieces of regular wheat bread (since a sandwich just isn't a sandwich without being toasted) and added only the banana to the sandwich since I didn't have any strawberries, and it came out great. A really tasty lunch or snack.

I found this little recipe when I was doing an ingredient search for ways to use my almond butter. For so few and simple ingredients it was really delicious. Also not a combination I would have thought to put together. My kids enjoyed this one as well.

This was an interesting combination. I didn't have wheat bread, but I had a wheat sub roll and used that. I have had almond butter around awhile and keep forgetting about it. I used all the ingredients but the strawberries. I didn't have them, but I was using strawberry jam anyway. It kind of reminded me of a banana split sandwich. It was kind of sweet, for a sandwich. I cut it in half and one half filled me up.
