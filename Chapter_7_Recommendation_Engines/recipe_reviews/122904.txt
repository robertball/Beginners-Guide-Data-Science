I thought that this recipe was really good! I used garlic powder and oregano on mine, and they turned out perfect. I was making some baked pasta and noticed that we didn't have any garlic bread... This was a great stand in, and I'm sure we will be using it again.

Used garlic powder instead of garlic salt because my butter was salted. I love garlic bread and this was great.

I made this with the measurements given but I blended the butter, garlic powder (not salt) and parmasaen cheese and then put it on the bread. It was good but next time I will toast one side under the broiler and then flip it over and put on the butter mixture and broil. My first try, the bread was a bit soft on the bottom. Also, next time I will use more garlic. Overall, this was a yummy, quick and convenient addition to a meal.

We threw in an additional quarter teaspoon of garlic powder for added oomph. My eldest boy was able to make this all on his own which was a huge ego booster for him which made me just love the recipe even more. GREAT for day old bread you buy off of the clearance rack and it halves well.

Very good, except that I heat mine in a skillet.  Buttered side first until slightly browned, then flip it over to toast the plain side.  It also helps to mix all the ingredients first.

This was easy to do, and tasty coming out of the oven, hence the 3 stars. However, 5 minutes later, the bottom was soaking wet and soft, and I'd have given it 0 stars if we hadn't eaten it so fast. Next time I'll turn the bread halfway through, then spread the butter and garlic and broil again, to make sure both sides are toasty and dry. Thanks for the recipe!

SO easy and so good! I didn't realize I didn't have any frozen garlic toast, so this was a stand in.  It will continue to be as well - yum!  Also have added cheese which is excellent as well. Thanks for the easy tasty recipe!

A quick way to make garlic bread for pasta night without having to buy or make a loaf. I use whatever sandwich bread I have on hand. I also like to use Johnny's garlic seasoning.

This was a fast and easy recipe.  I used garlic powder instead of the salt, and I broiled one side with butter before I broiled the other side with the powder and cheese.  It was good except next time I think I will use roasted garlic.

This recipe was absolutely perfect!  My whole famiy gobbled it up so fast that I had to make more, and I did not mind at all since it was so easy to make! I made sure that the unsalted butter was soft enough to spread easily and layered it on thick. It was not soggy at all! I broiled the bread in the oven at 500 degrees for about 5 to 7 minutes. It was perfect in color, texture and taste!

This is great toast for what it is. Nothing fancy, no artisan breads or fancy butters, but still a good standard garlic toast. I used Texas Toast thick sliced white bread. Very economical too! I've made this both with the garlic salt and with just garlic powder, both are good, but we prefer it without the salt.
