I made this recipe for Christmas because we have a diabetic family member. EVERYONE loved it! It was simple to make and came out great.

This was AMAZING. My mother literally cried, it was so good. She claims it's the best turkey she's ever had, and and I'd have to agree. I used a 3 lb. turkey breast (the recipe calls for 1.5 lb.), and cooked uncovered at 350 F for an hour and a half. I doubled the sauce and spices, but ended up with too much of those. It came out perfect- absolutely moist and cooked through. I poured the juices over the final product.

In terms of the cranberry sauce: I would really recommend increasing the brown sugar significantly- not as good for you, but the sauce was way too bitter without it.

This was a huge disappointment! I have had great success with well-reviewed recipes on this site so I expected it to be good. Everything turned out a disaster. The cranberry sauce never thickened enough (I cooked it almost an hour), the rub had WAY too much pepper (I should have known to reduce it by half... a tablespoon is way too much). I followed the recipe exactly and I had to throw it all away.

This was a terrific recipe. I made if for a group of friends and they all raved about it.  I would recommend it.

I didn't like the peppery taste of this recipe.  My husband liked it, but I thought the pepper was overwhelming.
