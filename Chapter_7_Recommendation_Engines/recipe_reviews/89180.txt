The recipe didn't say what kind of potatoes to use, so I used russett. As soon as I put the sauce in, it was clear that the author meant to use significantly smaller potatoes. I put probably 5 times the amount of soy and cayenne in and it was still bland and tasteless from too much potato versus other ingredients. Even if I had used smaller potatoes, they still would have come out tasting like ordinary breakfast potatoes and not anything special. I actually wound up turning these into breakfast burritos, adding eggs, salsa and sour cream wrapped in a flour tortilla. They were really good like that.

I liked this! I used a can of new potatoes (it's all I had), and the store was out of red bell peppers, so I used orange. I also was out of sesame seeds, but I made do without. Here's a hint- for that "fiery" flavor, don't premix the cayenne and soy sauce. Start at step two, and then add the cayenne and soy sauce directly to the potatoes and veggies. Up the cayenne to a full teaspoon like I did. A pinch of pepper will light the match, but a tablespoon will give you fire. ;)

Excellent!  I didn't have any sesame seeds so I added a little sesame oil to the sauce.  I used one small red pepper and one small yellow pepper.  Made with small russett potatoes.  "Fiery" really isn't a great representation of the taste of this dish, but it was still delicious.  Will most definitely make again!

Highly recommended! I was a little skeptical about the ingredients in this Korean side dish, but did it ever turn out well. Everyone loved them, and I was asked to make this again.

I would definitely make this again! It's quick and tasty. I recommend increasing the soy sauce to 2 T., as well as cooking the potatoes at least 10 minutes in the oil. I felt more comfortable measuring the cayenne. I used 1/8 teaspoon, and it was just right for us.

I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. It's taste better for us!

I don't understand what difference it makes what kind of potato you use.  As long as you cut them into bite sized pieces.  I used russets. I used peanut oil and saut√©ed the potatoes with the cayenne so the potatoes would absorb the heat in the cayenne.  Then added the other ingredients. Very good.

I was looking for something quick to go with some rice and chick peas I had on hand (based on the Spiced Quinoa recipe found on this site - made with rice instead of quinoa).  This fit the bill.  I had to add a little water after frying the potatoes and onions (no green onions on hand, so I used one small onion).  When potatoes were cooked through, I let the liquid evaporate then added the remaining ingredients (increasing both the cayenne and soya sauce as other reviewers noted).  A winner for all the family - even my kids who are not big red pepper fans.
