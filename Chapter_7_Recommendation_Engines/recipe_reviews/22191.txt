I agree with previous reviews-this tasted OK, but the glaze was not thick and the chicken was a little dry.

OK, after reading everyones review this is what I did. I dredgd the chicken in flour and browned it quickly. Put it in an oven safe pot, used orange juice concentrate, honey, lemon juice and citrus pepper. Baked covered 45 minutes at 325. Came out delicious - sauce was thickened by the flour. Served over white rice.

I made this recipe exactly how it says and could not eat it.  It did not appeal to me, especially since I dont like honey.  I will not make this recipe again.  Eight other people tried this chicken too and none were too fond of it.  My dog, who is a picky eater, also did not eat it.

This was ok, it just seemed to lack something.  I added a little bit more honey to try and thicken the sauce up some.  I think this might work if it was used with a stir-fry or something which is probably how I will make it again.

The recipe was very easy to make, but I didn't really care for the taste of it.  I think I preferred the cornbread more.

It was a little change of pace for chicken.  Something different for a change.

We weren't impressed with this recipe, it was very disappointing.  The flavor of the glaze was OK but the chicken was dry and had NO flavor.  Maybe it just needed to be marinated in the honey/O.J.  But I don't think I'll be making this one again.

The chicken tasted great, however the acidic nature of the orange juice and honey really dried out the chicken.  If I were to make it again, I wouldn't cook the chicken in the glaze.  I would rather cook it on the stove top with cornstarch then brush the glaze onto the chicken during the last half of the cooking time.  I would also double the amount of salt to add depth to the flavor.

While this dish was easy to make, I wasn't really impressed with the taste.  The chicken was much more citrusy than anything else.
