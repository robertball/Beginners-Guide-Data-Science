I have tried several oatmeal chocolate chip recipes and this is by far the best.  The previous reviewer must have overdone an ingredient as I did not find it too be to floury or tasteless, in fact, it was quite the opposite.  The cookies were excellent and rich with flavor.  I even found this recipe better than the 5 star oat/choc cookie recipe that is so popular.  I think the key is the dark brown sugar, it just makes the whole cookie.  Excellent cookie!  I will never use another recipe again!

Although I'd like to, I couldn't give this recipe the full 5 star rating, since I took the advice from some of the other reviews. Here are the small tweaks I made:
- 1 full cup more rolled oats
- an extra teaspoon of vanilla
- half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat
- half dark brown sugar and half golden
- baked them for only 15 minutes

They turned out awesome, soft and chewy and lots of chocolate! This recipe is a keeper!

I loved this cookie!  The only thing I disagree with is the number of servings.  My recipe made 24 3-inch cookies.  For it to make only 15 they would have to be really big.... Also, I tried it again and replaced the 2 cups of chocolate chips with 1 cup white chocolate chips and 1 cup macadamia nut halves.  Those cookies were YUMMY too!!!

yummy indeed.  but i did add the extra cup of oats as well as some cinnamon.  and less chocolate and some raisins.  the base of the cookie is definitely worth 4 stars.

My family loves Oatmeal Chocolate Chip cookies and this recipe in particular.  I read through the reviews when I made these and finally decided to do and add just what the recipe called for.  They turned out phenomenally!  What's more I shared these at work and got rave reviews as well.  This recipe is a keeper for sure!

I'm on always in search of the perrrrfect oatmeal cookie that will be a knock-your-socks off variety. I added 1/2cup chopped toasted walnuts, 1 cup cappucino chips and 1 cup milk chocolate chips to mine, rather than 2 cups of semi-sweet chips. Yum! I, too got more than 15 cookies out of this recipe. Great recipe Megs.

Really yummy! I followed the recipe exactly, even down to the cooking time and temp (which I wasn't sure would work well). I had to use half semisweet and half butterscotch chips because that's all I had in the cupboard. Very nice texture. A little crunchy around the outside but chewy on the inside. Yummy!

I got almost 50 cookies from the one batch and they were a nice size, too!
I divided the dough into thirds: to one, I added dried cranberries, to the second, chocolate chips, and to the third, raisins.
I used a miniscoop to get fairly uniformly-sized cookies. I rolled each into a ball in my hands and gently flattened each a tiny bit.
I baked the first batch for the full 20 minutes and found them a bit too crispy for my taste.  I baked the chocolate chip and raisin ones only 10 minutes until just almost set and let them sit in the pan about 5 minutes, then removed them with a spatula to the cooling rack.  I prefer this more tender version.
One nice thing about these cookies is that they are not too sweet, although one CAN adjust the sweetness, of course. I will definitely make these again but
I probably will add more fruit or chocolate chips next time because they do spread quite a bit while baking and I like to get something in each bite.

My family was very impressed with these cookies. Yummy.  I would only change two things less chocolate chips and more oatmeal.  But hey that is just me.  Like I said my family loved these cookies. Great Job Meg!!

I tweaked this a bit (couldn't resist) but the result was worth it.  Used 1 1/2 cups oats, 1 cup brown and 1/2 cup white sugar, 1/2 margarine and 1/2 shortening and added 1 tsp. cinnamon in place of one of the teaspoons of vanilla.  Also, used raisins and craisins in place of the choc. chips.  Took the cookies to my daughter's volleyball game and the team devoured them!  I'll definitely try them again with the choc. chips.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars hoping that others will read "MsMilne"'s recommendations, as I did. I am eating one now and they are delicious with these recommendations (extra vanilla, half ww flour, extra oats.) I also put a big handful of flax seeds in, just because, why not, and we use powdered egg substitute (because of the cruelty to chickens.) 

Anyway- Awesome team effort, Meg and Ms Milne!

These cookies are delish but I had to add an extra cup of oats so they weren't flat. I also lowered the baking time to 14 minutes. Very yummy but I'm going to keep looking for the best oatmeal choc chip recipe.

This is the only chocolate chip oatmeal cookie recipe I use anymore.  I have found that refrigerating the dough for an hour makes a big difference in how the cookies bake.  If you like a soft, full cookie I recommend cooling the dough awhile.

way too much flour, way too little oatmeal. made dry, cake-like chocolate chip cookies with a few oats mixed in.   sorry meg, but i was really looking forward to some homemade oatmeal cookies.   i guess if you were low on oats but still really wanted to make cookies you could use this recipe and end up with cookies.

I just made these beauties! I must add, my family's fav cookie is this one. I try a ton of recipes for this, but I think I found "the one"! I must also add that I too did some little tweaks, like less chips (we like the cookie) and reduced salt to almost nothin' since I had only salted butter on hand (still perfect), but most importantly..I did one stick butter and finished w/1/2C. canola oil (my husband has high BP and it doesn't hurt none to mix up your oil (I know that will make the pastry folks wince), but really they turn out perfect! (You get only half the butter and some good for ya oil--so it's health food now y'all!) I also threw in some finely ground hazelnut about 1/2C(your coffee will love you), but was disappointed by the 42 cookie yeild (I am not counting the fact that dough MUST be sampled!!) Just keep your sampling in check and maybe you'll get the right number! (For the person who didn't like Ms. M's cookies..it may be that you didn't use high quality ingredients?! I have found it can significantly improve the flavor of everything!) Thank you for sharing Ms. M, they are easy and delicious!

This recipe is pretty darn good.  

I made the cookies without using any wheat flour.  Instead, for the two cups of flour I subbed in 3/4 cup garbanzo bean flour, 3/4 cup spelt flour and 1/2 cup white rice flour. I put in 1 tsp. baking powder instead of the 1/2 tsp. of baking soda, so they would raise nicely. Not using wheat flour can effect how much the baked good raises. 

I reduced the sugar by 1/3 cup, too, and with all the chocolate-y goodness, I thought the cookies were plenty sweet.

I followed this recipes to a T and they tasted ok, but when I put them in the over they went completely flat. They would be better if they were fuller and more chewy.

These were very good. I added 1 cup raisins in with the chocolate chips. Otherwise, I think the cookies would have been too doughy. Also, you don't need to grease the pans or wait 5 minutes to take them off the sheet. Very yummy, crispy but soft cookies. Oh, and use real butter, it tastes way better.

wow, this was one of the worst cookie recipes I've ever tried.  I read the reviews before I tried the recipe out for myself and the reviews were so good!  I did everything exactly according to the recipe.  As I read the recipe, I thought 'My, that's a lot of flour.' My cookies were the most dry, flavorless things I've ever tasted.  It was like eating globs of hardened flour with chocolate chips. I later added more sugar and salted butter to the dough (I only baked about 9 cookies at first to see how they would turn out), and although it made the cookies a lot flatter and crispy on the edges, they at least tasted like cookies.  This recipe is simply terrible!

This recipe definitely makes more than 15 cookies as stated.  I think we ended up with almost 32 cookies!  WHAT I DID DIFFERENT:  I added 1 more cup of oatmeal as suggested by another reviewer and put in twice the amount of vanilla.  I ran out of unsalted butter so I added 1/2 c. salted butter.  I also added about 1/4 c. of coconut flakes just for something extra.  I think next time I will toast the coconut flakes first to add even more flavor.  After the first batch I baked them for 23-25 minutes instead of 21 minutes.  They came out crunchier on the outside but were still moist on the inside.  My husband and daughter devoured the first batch before they even finished cooling.  My husband isn't usually an oatmeal raisin person so I tried this one out and he said it was a "keeper".    Thanks Meg for the yummy recipe!!!

This is a great cookie.  We do not like supper chocolaty cookies so I substituted 1 c of chopped walnuts for 1/2 of the chocolate chips.  I made smaller cookies and baked them for 12 minutes. Other then that I followed the recipe as written.  My husband asked me to write the recipe in my permanent cookbook.  I will be making these again.

Overall, a super cookie. Next time I may add a bit more oats, but regardless these cookies were delicious. Cooking time was exact, came out golden & perfect! Great job, Meg!

I made them last night and they were really yummy. I did add an additional teaspoon of vanilla and 1 more cup of oatmeal. Little less baking time because I like my cookies chewy!

Thanks Meg, These cookies taste great!  after reading the reviews I did switch the flour amount with the oats.(2 cups oats and 1 c. flour) and my 4 yr old granddaughter added the brown sugar to the dry mix, but everything turned out great..I turned the heat up to 350 and baked them for 14 min.  made 24 nice size cookies... keep up the good work!

YUM YUM!!!  These are wonderful.  I added 3/4 cup chopped walnuts and baked for only 15 minutes...my oven does tend to run hot, however.  Anyway, they were perfect.  Thanks for a keeper!

Excellent cookie recipe.  I don't like overly sweet desserts but this was perfect.  I added more oats to the recipe and used chocolate chunks.  It made more than 15 cookies.  I didn't bake them all but froze the rest.  I just bake a few at a time so we can enjoy freshly baked cookies repeatedly with one batch.

These are the lightest, fluffiest oatmeal cookies I've had. I only had dried out light brown sugar, so I used that but also added a few tablespoons of molassess and they came out great!

This recipe was Excellent!  I only had one egg so I cut the flour back to 1.5 cups and I added a 1/2 cup of dried cranberries to the batter.  It made more than 15 cookies.

Great recipe with lots of flavor!!

good cookies -- but -- I followed the recipe exactly and found 2 cups of chocolate chips as way too much.  I would only use one cup.  I have double checked and 2 cups of chips has to be wrong.  I only put in 1 cup and it was more than enough and the cookies were great.  I did not trust the low temp - 300 degrees but used that temp and went for 25 minutes and they turned out great.

Just finished making them and they are awesome!  I don't think I made enough I am also going to give some to my co workers.  I think maybe more oats could be used.  I also used mini-semi sweet chocolates.  That's what I had and used so I didn't have to buy some.  But I LOVE'em and my 3 year old son does too.  It's 9pm and he can't stop eating them.

Loved this recipe!  I like how it uses all brown sugar.  The only thing i did different was use 3/4 cup semi sweet morsels, 3/4 cup butterscotch morsels, and 3/4 cup chopped walnuts.  They were excellent.  Next time (as another reveiwer mentioned)  I want to do the white chocolate morsels with macadamia nuts.  It sounds like it would fit this cookie PErFECT!  I also refrigerated the dough before baking so they wouldnt come out flat.  well it worked and i am very happy. thanks for the recipe

I was looking for a normal oatmeal chocolate chip recipie, and I found this one.  Easy to follow and my cookies turned out really well.  The only thing I would tweak is the time in the oven, I added a couple of minutes cooking time and they turned out much better.  My kids loved them.  Definately make this recipie again.

Best. Cookies. Ever.  I used white sugar by accident, but took out a 1/3 cup of it and put in a 1/3 cup of brown sugar to try and salvage my mistake. The still turned out perfect! I only baked them for 18 minutes though, because I didn't like them so well-done.  I also use Ghirardelli chocolate chips, which is the perfect touch to these cookies... along with crushed walnuts. Simply perfect. My whole family got a sample, and they all agree these cookies are their absolute favorite!

I really loved these cookies, they were really good! The only thing I changed is the amount of rolled oats-I added 2 cups instead of 1. I absolutely love oatmeal cookies, and this recipe is now one of my favourites=)

Unfortunately, this recipe was a big disappointment!  They spread out so thin, and even though I greased the baking sheet, I could not remove them!  They all crumbled apart and made a huge mess!  The parts of the cookie we were able to chip away DID taste good, though!  I will not be making this recipe again.  Sorry!

Crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside! They were wonderful just out of the oven, but by the next day they had gotten a bit dense on the inside, so I reheated them in the microwave for about 15 seconds and that set them right! 

A semi-obvious tip: make sure your brown sugar isn't too clumpy - I was a bit lazy and ended up with "chocolate chip and brown sugar chunk" cookies!

These were only ok... Compared to usual oatmeal cookies I thought there wasn't nearly enough oatmeal!! and they weren't very sweet; kind of just tasted like dough with chocolate. I would definitely choose another recipe next time.

These cookies were really good!!!!!!!!!  I recently made another oatmeal cookie recipe from this site & it was awful so I wasn't sure how these would turn out, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I didn't have any choc chips, so I used mini marshmallows instead like one reviewer on here, & they were pretty good!  Thanks!!!!

Thanks so much, Megs. My family devoured the last batch. My five-year-old is an extremely picky eater and he's asked me to make a new batch three times in the past week. This one's a definite keeper. I'm grateful to you.

I've never made cookies before but with this recipe, it was a cinch. And they were very good! I like mine a bit browner and crunchier, so I kept them in for about 30 minutes as opposed to 20. They were yummy!

I liked this recipe. I made cookies smaller and I ended up with almost 50 of them, since they were smaller they came up more crunchy (that was actually my intention). I did not have enough chocolate chips at home so I put less and they still came out nicely. Next time I will try to add chop walnuts.

Maybe I did something wrong but mine came out VERY DRY, BUT the flavor is very good. Maybe I should have added more butter??

Thank you for this great recipe! I would recommend adding an extra cup of oats to really get a better oat texture and flavor, and reducing the chocolate chips to 1 or 1 1/2 cups. A cup of walnuts or a dried fruit with a cup of chocolate chips would be a good middle so the chocolate isn't overpowering.

These turned out kind of dry and floury for me.  I took the advice of others and added an extra cup of oats, so maybe you need to something to counteract that addition.

I made these over the weekend with some of the suggested tweeks. One extra cup of oats and an extra teaspoon of vanilla. They are super yummy and were a big hit at the office. My questions is they get very hard very fast. Are their any teeks that will help them not get so hard? They still taste great but hard.
