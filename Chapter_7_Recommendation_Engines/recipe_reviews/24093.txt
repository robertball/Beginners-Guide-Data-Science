Very good.  Used 2 cans cooked chicken, 1 can Cream of Potato, 1 can Cream of Chicken, and 1 1/2 cups frozen veggies in addition to the spices mentioned.  Easy to prepare, great to keep one of these in the freezer.

easy and tasty.  Warning-don't add any more of the thyme than called for and if you don't like this herb, try adding poultry seasoning.  GREAT recipe as it, but a little too much thyme and your pot pie will taste like dirt. (yeah, I found that out first hand) My kids devoured this.

This recipe turned out pretty good. It did seem like a lot of work considering how many pre-made frozen pot pie dishes there are available on the market. I made the following changes: cut thyme in half, added frozen mixed vegetables, added a can of pearl onions to the sauce (this was a huge mistake). If you enjoy the flavor of onions I recommend adding onion powder instead of the pearl onions I tried. They did not blend in with the dish and the texture was not something I enjoyed. I will probably not be making this again.

This is a GREAT RECIPE!!!!!!!!!!!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could!!!  I couldn't help myself, I made a couple tiny changes that make this recipe sing! I poached my chicken with Bell's poultry seasoning- that's the key-, added a little more milk (1/2cup total) and a second can of cream of potato soup. I've tried this with frozen mixed veg and with Veg-All brand canned mixed vegetables and the Veg-All is the way to go!  This meal is completed, in our house, with some cranberry sauce....DELICIOUS!!!!!!!  EASY!!!!!!!  WONDERFUL!!!!!!!!!!  Thanks for sharing!

A classic!  Instead of canned veggies, I use frozen mixed vegetables (thawed, of course), as well as thawed pearl onions in sauce.  Also, cream of chicken soup, and no milk.  You can use the refrigerated pie crusts to save time, too.  A perfect dish for those cold Autumn nights!

This is a good recipe, easy to fix, and great comfort food.  I used a refrigerated pie crust.  I also left out the thyme because I'm not fond of it.  Other than that I went exactly by this recipe.  I don't like it when others rate a recipe low based on their idea of the nutrition value of the recipe.  I also don't care to read that someone liked it but made a few changes.  Or in other words they made an entirely different dish with their 'few' changes.  If you think this is too high in sodium you can use low sodium soups and leave out the salt.  If you're not comfortable with that make something else for dinner.

Nice quick recipe, unfortunately too high in sodium for people with high blood pressure.
It would have to modified to eliminate canned soup and vegetables.

I thought this was a very good recipe. It tasted delicious and it was a cinch to make. Next time I may use a half a can of more soup or add a little more milk just to make it a little more "soupier". It took a little more time to bake (50 minutes).

This was a hit at my house! It is FANTASTIC! I used thawed, frozen veggies but followed everything else exactly. It does take a little longer to bake.

Great pie, would be 5 stars except I added an extra can of potato soup.  And it took a bit longer to cook than stated, although probably depends on your oven.  Delicious and great even as leftovers!

A very easy and tasty dish. I used frozen vegetables instead of canned, but I would not recommend this. The vegetables weren't thawed completely and it made the whole dish quite watery. Otherwise, this was perfect. Just the right amount of spices. Thanks for the recipe!

It is a quick and simple recipe that my boyfriend and I both enjoyed! I did do a few variations on this as well using half a can of cream of chicken soup with the cream of potato, added half a cup if celery, and instead of using thyme I substitued it with poultry seasoning. was very yummy..The bake time took a little longer then indicated. I would recommend 375 for 40-45mins until crust is golden brown.

This is a good start for a recipe.  I added a can of cream of mushroom soup and quite a bit more milk to get it to the consistency that I like.  I also used two frozen pie crusts (thawed) and I baked the bottom crust before I  poured the chicken mixture into it.  I'll make it again.

I had to adjust this recipe because I didn't realize it was not meant for a deep dish pan...my mistake!  I added 2 more cans of veggies and a can of cream of chicken.  Very good.  Next time I'll double this recipe to fill my deep dish pie plate.

I made this with phillo dough instead of pie crust and came out great.  I'll make this again but use fresh ingredients instead as you could tell the vegetables were canned.  I used more milk than what was called for, about double and omitted the salt. Very good starter recipe for someone just learning to make homemade pot pies.

Excellent. I recomend adding a good shot of both garlic and onion powder. Beware if you're timing it closely because my pie took a little over an hour to bake completely!

My company gave it a 5+, but I gave it a 4 because I used both a 1/4 tsp. of thyme and Poultry seasoning as another rater advised.I'd cut them both in half next time. Also used frozen veggies and Cream of celery soup W/a Diced, al dente potato.Next time (and there will be a next time) I'll add some canned baby limas. I think this would raise it just another notch.Yummy,yummee!

I love this recipe. Nothing fancy, very easy. I mean, c'mon.... chicken pot pie is NOT a gourmet dish, and it SHOULD be a fast meal as this recipe demonstrates. My girlfriends and I get together every month for a theme dinner party, and this was featured at our "comfort food" dinner w/ mac n' cheese & ice cream sundaes. Yum!

This is the best pot pie recipe I have tried. I didn't make my own pastry, I used the Tenderflake pie shells. I did not change anything other than that. It is the easiest pot pie I've made. I'm not sure why people have said it's a lot of work. How hard is it to open a few cans of soup/veggies? I will definitely be making this again and again and again.......

I used this recipe more for the method than the exact flavor. The method was good.  I made two pies, but I only had one top crust, so I made a lattice top on both. I used Golden Mushroom soup, and a lot more milk than called for to thin it out. Should've thinned it more, the lattice top doesn't hold the steam in the way a full top crust does. I added a lot of other herbs and spices. Even tossed in some dried mustard greens I had lying around. The chicken I used was a smoked chicken, and I used a little less than half a smoked chicken in the two pies with a lot of frozen mixed veg I heated in the microwave. It took a good deal longer to bake than the 25 to 30 minutes, but it was a deep dish pie, and there were two. Hubby was very happy with it, the kids loved it. Rating it four stars because it obviously needs a lot more interest than the base recipe--more herbs and spices, etc. But the method is good.

I think I have fixed this recipe before, but I'm not real positive.  It was good then.  This time, maybe it was the chicken, because it tasted very dry to all of us.  Thank you for your recipe.

I thought this recipe was just okay - maybe a little boring.  I used canned chicken breast meat (2 - 13 oz. cans), which turned out fine.  My complaint was that there wasn't much of a gravy to it - I think next time I'll try one of the recipes which call for a cream (chicken or whatever) soup.  Also, I definitely wouldn't add anymore that what's called for as far as the thyme.

My husband and kids loved this recipe!!! I altered it by adding  defrosted frozen grean beans, peas and carrots and omitted the thyme and salt. I also added an extra half can of cream of chicken because I had it in the pantry and the mixture seemed a little bit too firm. I also prebaked the bottom of the pie for 5 minutes and had to increase the cooking time to 45 min (but maybe that's just my oven). Great recipe.....will make again!

This was really good.  My pie crust did not bake all the way, though.  I think I will use a homemade crust next time...or bake the crust first before adding the filling.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very fast and easy. Use frozen crusts for even less hassle. Great for those nights you want to cook but don't have a lot of time. I used frozen veggies instead of canned. My kids loved it.

Followed the recipe as was and it turned out excellent-kids loved it. Wish there was a lower fat option for the pie crust though.

Like some, I substituted frozen veggies for the canned.  Since I have to be careful with salt, I used Campbells Healthy Request soups.  They contain less sodium.  Plus No-Salt substitute works as well for the "Salt to Taste".  Thanks for the recipe!

This was really good.  I added a little more milk because it seemed a bit dry.  Also used refrigerated crusts.  Was even better the next day for leftovers.

Cooking time waaaayyy off.  Really needs to cook about 50 minutes so plan accordingly.  Otherwise, my family really enjoyed.  We tend to like spicier dishes so I used creole seasoning instead of the thyme, salt and pepper.  Next time I would add more spices to it.

I adapted this recipe because I had leftover chicken and gravy from the night before. I thickened the gravy with a simple milk and flour mixture & stirred it into the chicken & gravy while it was boiling. I added a can of drained mixed vegetables (took out the potatoes) to the chicken mixture. I also brushed the crust with egg wash before baking and baked for 40 minutes. It turned out great!

I made it the way it says it was good, but a little dry so next time I will add a little more milk. I used Chef John's recipe for flakey crust and it was wonderful. I will make this again.

I made this for a quick week night dinner and it was a real hit!  I followed the recipe except i used cream of chicken with herbs soup and added an extra splash of milk.  I also added a can of diced new potatoes, and a 1/4 tsp of celery salt.  I did brown the chicken before adding using rotisserie and Montreal chicken seasoning and s & p.  I topped the mixture with 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese.  Husband loved it and he doesn't really care for chicken.  will make it again.

This was very good!  An excellent home style pot pie for a winter evening. I may have used more filling in my pie, so it maybe could’ve used a little more soup mixture, but it held its shape well & was quite tasty!  The pic shows all that was left after the hubby & I had dinner, & he took a good-sized slice for lunch the next day!  4-stars is only because it took close to an hour to bake!  Will make again!

Very good and easy to make. I added extra spices just to dress it up a bit, poultry seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Made a butter crust only for the top. Will make again

I made this today. It was delicious. Changes made  : 1box of frozen mixed veggies thawed, pre rolled  pie crusts, a pinch  of dried thyme, and 1/4 teaspoon of both Montreal steak seasoning and powdered garlic. Egg washed the top of crust also. Cooked for 45 minutes. Would make this again.

This was my first attempt at a savory pie and it worked out great! Taking suggestions from other reviews I made some changes:used 2 frozen pie crusts, half a can of cream of celery in addition to the cream of potato soup. Also added little less than 1/2cup of heavy cream to get desired consistency. Only 1/8 tsp of thyme, salted liberally, about 1/4 tsp Italian seasoning, pepper to taste and the parsley called for. Baked @375 for 45 mins. This recipe was a great starting point to make the chicken pot pie I was craving, thanks for sharing!

This was very good and easy.  I used already cooked Roast Chicken from Safeway, 15oz of frozen mixed vegies, and Pillsbury premade pie crusts, took 10 mins to put together and about 40 mins to cook.  Yummy!

Easy and very yummy!! I took advise from others and did not use the thyme. While cooking the chicken, I added some diced onions, celery and potatoes. I used cream of chicken and omitted the cream of celery and cream of potato.

i love this recipe. i added 2 cans of cream of potato soup instead of one. it need more cooking time. almost a hour.. whenever i have leftover chicken or turkey i make this pie...
