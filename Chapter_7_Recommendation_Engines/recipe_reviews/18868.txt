I gave this 4 stars cause I prefer it the way I make it.  I add 1 T. soy sauce to the dressing and use 2 packets of sweetener with regular white vinegar and regular vegetable oil.  I also add a bucnh of chopped green onions to the salad.  I toast the almonds along with some sesame seeds.  This recipe has made the rounds with my friends and has gone all over the country by now!  Thanks.

I broiled the chicken breasts. With my salad mix, I used lightly chopped cashews instead of almonds. I added chopped green onions and slivered canned water chestnuts. Splenda was the perfect sweetener for the dressing, and I gave the dressing a splash of soy sauce. Thank you for a fast recipe. It's perfect for work lunch.

Okay, so it's not as good as the Chinese chicken salad you make from scratch, but for a quick and easy recipe, this one is remarkably tasty.  My family made me promise to make it again (and again) and that's a promise I'll be happy to keep!

This is my middle son's very favorite salad. So much so, he requested that it be served at his graduation open house last June, where it went over famously!
The only change I made was substituting white vinegar and sugar for the called for items. No difference noted!

This recipe was wonderful.  My husband asked for more!  When I first started, I wasn't sure about the ingredients but it was great!  I will serve this again!

We loved this recipe.  I leave out the chicken and sweetener and serve as a light summer side dish.  It is so easy to put together.  Maybe it should be save as Chinese Cabbage Salad without the chicken?

A great summer salad! Easy and quick to make, especially if you buy pre-cooked chicken. Yum!

The taste was really quite good. Needed more of the dressing though, so next time I'll multiply the ingredients a bit, and make it less vinegary. But the crunch and taste were really great, esp. since I added water chestnuts per others' reviews. I'm keeping this one in my recipe box.

A have made this recipe for many years - I add green onion and lots and lots of cilantro.  The cilantro for me really makes the salad.  I also use peanut oil instead of corn oil because it gives it a nicer flavor.

Easy!  I love this one.  I use canned chicken instead just to cut down on time.

This is a great salad. I grilled the chicken breast on the George Forman grill, used broccoli cole slaw, and olive oil. I am not a big fan of vinegar taste but this was delicious. I served it with toasted sourdough bread. My husband loved it also. I most definitely will make again.

This quick and easy recipe was a hit on a hot summer evening. I agreed with the other reviews and added slice green onions - otherwise I followed the recipe as directed.
