This indeed is a wonderful wild rice soup recipe but let me save y'all a little time: buy a can (or two if you like it with extra rice) of the pre-cooked wild rice.  Drain & rinse and you've just shaved off 2 hours of prep time for this recipe.  BUT a nice addition I discovered: some grocery stores offer this nice mix of fresh mushrooms (shitake, portabella, etc...) already pre-sliced ~ perhaps for stir fry but I bought a package and when I sauted the onions, I sauted these mushrooms in too!  Wonderful! A can of diced pimentos also adds some beautiful color to this soup as well.

I had to do some major substitutions based on what I had around, but it still came out great.  For starters I had to use long grain white rice instead of wild rice, I had to use condensed cheddar cheese soup instead of cheese spread, and i had to use equal parts of milk and melted butter instead of half and half but it was still excellent!

This is one of the best wild rice soups I have made.  Every person that has tasted it absolutely raves about it.  I am asked to bring it to gatherings over and over.

Soooooo good! My husband is weird and doesn’t like rice IN anything, but loves it on the side... well he just had to get over it in this case! I loved it, my son loved it, and my husband really likes it too (even with the rice in there )!

Delicious! My family couldnt resist the idea of bacon rice soup! To save some time, I used some ready rice packets. I also substituted chicken broth for the water.

This recipe was good and we served it with crusty bread.  The recipe is built for convenience and in the spirit of that and what is now available off the shelf in 2018 I really only made two changes.  Making the wild rice is definitely time consuming so I used two 8.8 oz Microwavable Packets of wild rice which yielded the 3 cups of cooked rice required.  Also in the spirit of convenience I cooked the bacon on a sheet pan in the oven, while I sautéed the onions in a Half Tablespoon of butter.  These two changes did not alter the recipe’s flavor at all but definitely made it easier to clean-up and reduced the overall cook time dramatically.  As I said we enjoyed this recipe, it provides for a great taste, and warmth for those chilly nights.
