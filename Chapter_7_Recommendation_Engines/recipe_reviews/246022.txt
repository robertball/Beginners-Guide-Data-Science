I loved this recipe. I ended up having to puree the tomatoes, only because my kids are picky. However, the flavor is there. I've just been diagnosed with celiac disease, and I'm so glad I found these noodles. The only suggestion I have is to add a touch of oil to the boiling water and to stir immediately or the noodles will stick together forming an uncooked clump. I learned that the hard way getting busy in the kitchen. We will be having this again.

This was very good! The texture of the BarillaÂ® Gluten Free noodles were great and my noodle loving toddler had no suspicions! I did not have gluten free bread, so I soaked and drained some oats I blended in the food processor. This worked like a charm. I did end up adding additional garlic and other seasonings as well. If you like lots of flavor, you may want to as well! :) Add grated parmesan to the noodles for an extra kick of flavor!

Made this for dinner tonight and it was a huge hit.  My husband was surprised when I told him that it was gluten free.  The kids both asked for seconds!

The meatballs in this recipe are the same my Sicilian mother-in-law makes, but she uses stale, wheat bread. My kids and their father have been raised on this recipe and never tire of it. I had doubts about using soaked, gluten free bread, but it worked. I used the heel of the loaf and let it sit a couple of hours to dry up a bit. It didn't turn immediately to mush and really helped bind the meat, lending a moist texture once cooked. I used Barilla GF Tortiglioni instead of their spaghetti and it held up to all the handling and made it to the plate like regular pasta. Definitely a keeper for those of us who must eat gluten free and even a very good meal for those who don't eat GF.

Surprisingly close to the real deal!!
I loved the texture of the noodles, and when mixed in with some seasoning and sauce, you couldn't tell the difference! 
Will fool many dinner guests with this.
