I only had vanilla yogurt so I used sour cream instead. Also, I had marinated chicken tenders leftover so I reheated and used them instead of bacon.
Next time I need to add more sour cream but all in all it was A1. My son actually said it was good also. Imagine that.

I substituted regular bacon for the turkey bacon and doubled the recipe. It was good but it wasn’t like any carbonara I’ve ever had. It wasn’t creamy for one thing. Next time maybe I’ll try adding some milk or cream.
