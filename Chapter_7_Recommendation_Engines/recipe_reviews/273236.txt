I did make changes. I added cubed fillet of "Ocean Rockfish", a splash of lemon juice, and left off the egg, figuring we had our protein from the fish. It was delicious!

I love this recipe!!! It's very similar to what we make and call "breakfast fried rice".  Instead of mixing the egg in, I made a very thin, flat omelet to place over the rice, and topped with both ketchup and a kewpie mayonnaise mix.  I also subbed edamame for the peas because I didn't have frozen peas handy. So delicious!!! Thank you!
