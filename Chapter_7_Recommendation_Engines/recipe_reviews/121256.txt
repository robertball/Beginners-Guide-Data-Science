This cornbread is excellent. The only thing I think is that it needs less flour and more corn meal. I would definitely use this again. Thanks for a really good, from basically scratch corn bread.

This was my first time making cornbread and I have to tell ya, it was GREAT! and incredibly moist (for cornbread). My family loved it. The next time I would probably add a bit more sugar but it tasted really good the way it is. BTW, I noticed that when a cake recipe calls for "vegetable oil" it tends to come out very dry; so I would recommend to stick with butter or margarine:)

This recipe is amazing!  Best Cornbread ever!  I added some honey to the final batter and it came out perfect.  No need to put any butter or dressing on this cornbread, it is delicious and moist exactly how it is!  Perfect accompaniment to any stew, soup, or chili!  Will definitly make this cornbread again!

UPDATE: I made muffins with this. My husband doesn't really like cornbread and he ate a whole muffin plus said he really really liked this cornbread, something he's never said about any cornbread before. He loved the light non gritty non grainy texture. I did use the mixer to do this up quickly.
original review: DELICIOUS!!! This is my new favorite cornbread. I LOVE this cornbread!This was moist, rich tasting, lighter than most cornbreads, nice corn grain texture but sort of cake-like as it wasn't heavy or dense or too gritty. This was so delicious, even cold and without butter, this cornbread is exceptionally good! This made a large pan full and the bread rose really high and was perfect for splitting open, in fact, the pieces were so tall, it needed to be split to be eaten. Thanks Nicole, this is wonderfully sweet cornbread cake. MMMmmmmmm....

This recipe is FANTASTIC. It was really quick and easy. I added a generous squirt of honey and cooked it in a 9 inch cake pan for about 35-40 minutes. The top got very golden brown which gave it a really great crunch and the inside was soft and sweet. I absolutely recommend it!

Being from the south I've had just about every cornbread around and this one is great and simple!  The only thing I can add is to make it in a cast iron skillet.  Pour just enough oil to lightly coat the bottom of the skillet and put the skillet in the oven while it preheats and you mix the ingredients.  Then when you pour the mixture into the skillet it gives your cornbread the most amazing crispy crust.

I have tried this as written and it's very good, but think the flour should be reduced to 2 cups, and the cornmeal increased to 1 1/3 cups.  

This last time I made it, I added in some pepper jack cheese, and chopped fire roasted bell peppers essentially making jacked up corn bread :)  It was extremely good!!!

WOW!  This recipe has replaced all others I have ever had for corn bread.  I needed a last minute bread to send to work with my brother and they devoured it! They even asked for it again instead of cookies! It is moist even without extra butter, but the syrup makes it out of this world!

This cornbread was delicious. I usually try not to offer a review on a recipe which I have altered, but the end results were just too good not too share. I ommitted the sugar entirely (I do not like sweet cornbread, and the suger seems like empty calories to me). I also upped the quantity of cornmeal by a half cup and I added about 1 cup of shredded Aged White Cheddar to the batter before baking. It made the interior incredibly moist and tasty!

This is an excellent recipe.  Instead of baking in one large pan, I made corn muffins.  The baking time was 13-14 minutes and a single batch makes about 20 muffins.

Excellent tasting corn bread recipe. I've made this twice, once as written and once with my own modifications. Both are delicious. The second time I made this cornbread I added a little zip by tossing in a 4oz can of mild green chiles, 1/3 cup of frozen corn, and about 1/2 cup of shredded sharp cheddar cheese. With the additions it ended up (obviously) making more batter. I ended up with about 2 doz. corn muffins--I did not have to alter any of the dry or wet ingredients or the cook time, it worked out just perfect.

Delicious! I used soy milk, margarine and an egg replacer (ground flax and hot water) to make it vegan. A bit too sweet for our taste- next time we will halve the sugar.

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!  I even tried cutting flour to 2 cups even then added a third cup more cornmeal. Moist, delicious, buttery goodness!  :-)

I really enjoyed this corn bread- it was so moist! These are the changes I made based on reading other reviews and my own thinking :-) I used 2 cups flour (instead of 2 and 1/3) and used 1 and 1/3 cornmeal (instead of just 1) and I also added about a table spoon of real maple sugar! It was delicious! Thanks for sharing!

The thought of cornbread has never really excited me.  The few times I've made a batch resulted in a rather boring and dry side to chili or a bread/roll replacement to any Mexican and Southern US themed dinners. I needed something to go with the slow cooker taco soup I made for dinner this evening and I just wasn't in the mood to make bread. This was to be the last time for a cornbread option. With a history of tossing most leftovers away I chose to 1/2 the recipe - just in case- I followed instructions and baked it for 23 minutes. After testing I let it cool  for 15 minutes prior to cutting it into squares. After just one bite, everyone agreed that the taste was exceptional. The soup was supposed to be the star of tonight's dinner but quickly this wonderful cornbread stole the show. DELICIOUS!

I had a boxed cornbread mix that I knew wouldn't be enough so I used this recipe too. There was no comparison. This was WAY better. It was fluffy and delicious. The only thing I did differently was cut it in half and I used 2 small eggs (instead of 1.5). I will never used the boxed stuff again.

This cornbread is wonderfull!!!!!!!!!! my family absolutly loved it. I live in Chile where every american thing is very hard to find like chocolate chips, cornmeal, cornsyrup, etc. But I used instant yellow polenta which worked wonderfully.. I assume its the same as cornmeal. This cornbread brought bake memories from my childhood. Everybody in Chile thinks american food is just burgers and cheese but I have proven them wrong making this, carrot cake, oatmeal chocolate chip cookies..  Update: I have discovered that if you brush a little melted butter on the hot corn bread it turns out prettier. My cornbread just doesnt come out with a golden top but this helps alot!

Ok..the deal is I can not make cornbread. No matter how hard I try it just is never good. This cornbread came out amazing!!!!!!!! The only corn bread I have ever had this good,light and fluffy is my mom's old fashioned buttermilk cornbread and she hasn't been able to make it for quite some time. I never thought I could ever make cornbread this good ever!!!! If I can make this it is fool proof! Thanks for sharing. This is our new family recipe!!! :)Our  daughter doesn't like cornbread and she loves this. I told her she never liked it before because it was mine..LOL

This is fantastic - moist & delicious.  I used a half recipe in an 8 x 8' pan and it worked out great.

Quick, easy and delicious. What more could you want? I saw Morgan's picture of this and decided to try it. Then I nearly forgot so I threw it together at the last minute. My little granddaughters and I all loved it! Thanks for a great cornbread recipe.

I got sooo many compliments on this corn bread.  My best friend said it was the best corn bread he had ever had - EVER!  I made one modification and added a can of creamed corn so it was a bit more dense and moist, and it was absolutely delicious!  We enjoyed it with hearty okra and tomatoes!

BEST. CORNBREAD. EVER.
Can't bake enough of the stuff - it's gone the same day even when I bake a double batch. Tonight I did a triple batch but waited until after dinner so my 4 sons and hubby would be full - YEAH, RIGHT! They're already sniffing around and crowding the kitchen in hopes of a piece before bed!

I should have known by reading the ingredients, but this version of corn bread was way too sweet and fluffy for my taste, almost cake-like. In fact, maybe with some cream cheese icing, it would be a good cake (I'm not being sarcastic). If you're looking for a down-home, southern cornbread, then keep looking.

10 stars! I will NEVER use a boxed mix again!  This so easy, and absolutely delish!  I squirted some honey in the batter, and would do that again for sure - added a nice little extra sweetness.  My house smells amazing!

TASTY RECIPE, BUT TOO SWEET FOR ME.....I AM NOT A FAN OF SWEET CORNBREADS....HOWEVER IF YOU CUT SUGAR BY  1/2 OR EVEN A LITTLE MORE, AND ADD ABOUT A 1/3 CUP MORE CORN MEAL.....THIS BECOMES A VERY YUMMY RECIPE

Finally, I've found my go-to cornbread recipe. I don't know what it is, but I've struggled to find one that would work for me. They've all be gritty or baked unevenly, or haven't been the right sweetness. Plus I don't have a cast iron skillet and rarely have buttermilk around so I was hoping to find something that I could make with what I *did* have! This one was it. And the fact that it uses butter is probably part of what makes it so great. It is the perfect blend of light, moist and just "corny" enough. Even the sweetness worked. I did adjust the balance of flour and cornmeal, doing about 2 cups flour and about 1 1/2 cups cornmeal. I also used someone else's suggestion about a 9 inch cake pan. I buttered it and baked for about 40 minutes. It was crunchy and cracked on top and moist and delish inside. I am looking forward to taking this and tweaking it, such as using honey and trying muffin tins. Just awesome!

Tried this cornbread, and it was okay.  All right, it was pretty good, but I was comparing it with the recipe on this site called "sweet corn bread" which I had just made previously, and I'm sorry to say, this recipe fell short.  We still ate it, but I will be making the "sweet corn bread" from here one out, since my husband and I both prefer that one.

I substituted some ingredients. I made this recipe with buttermilk, and polenta (italian cornmeal). Turned out pretty good overall. This is mostly a sweet bread. This recipe calls for the same amount of sugar I use in other breads. If you want it less sweet, consider using slightly less sugar. Will make this recipe again. Next time I will use bacon grease to grease the pan (as my grandmother does).

This was my first time making cornbread.   I made two batches.  One regular (it came out a touch drier than I was hoping for, but it was my fault, I put it in the oven for the full 27 minutes instead of checking it at 22 min)  I made a second batch at my husbands request with minced jalapenos in it.  He really loved the 2nd batch.  I brought the oven temp. down to 390 and cooked for the full 27 minutes the 2nd time (checking at 22 min.)  

Great recipe, thank you for sharing!  We will be holding on to this recipe.

This cornbread is so good! It went perfectly with our chili!  To make it just a bit healthier, I used fresh ground white wheat flour and sugar in the raw. I'll certainly be making again. Thanks for sharing!

I made no changes to the recipe, and this came out very well.  Moist, with a slight bit of crumble from the cornmeal, sweet, and the edges had a nice tiny bit of golden crunchiness (but only a little).  I recommend this recipe just the way it is.  Maybe some time in the future I'll try some modifications, like maple syrup, or something for an additional flavoring.  But as far as I am concerned, the recipe is perfectly fine just the way it is given.   While it was baking, the apartment was filling up with rich butter scent, and I couldn't wait to taste it.

This was the best, fluffiest, perfectly sweet, light cornbread I have ever eaten. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added a huge squirt of honey into the batter right before I poured it into the baking dish and oh my... it was DELICIOUS!!! A must have for a nice big bowl of homemade chili on a chilly fall evening - and that's exactly how I served it!

Great recipe but you HAVE to reverse the flour and cornmeal portions. MUCH better this way! I also only added 3/4 cup sugar and the bread was sweet enough without being over powering. Make these changes and you will not be dissapointed.

This recipe turned out great for me. I used a cast-iron skillet, buttered it really well and nearly trippled the cooking time as it was a smaller skillet, not more than 12 inches. I also used mostly brown sugar to give it an extra something. This definetly tasted a lot like jiffy which is what I have I have been striving to replicate.

I tried this recipe straight out of the oven and was a little disappointed, but once it fully cooled, I was impressed! This recipe is so easy as to be called fool-proof and yields a sweet, moist, corn bread with excellent mouth feel. I think it could stand to have more corn meal and less white flour. MODIFICATIONS: I reduced the butter to 8TB (1 stick) and added about 1/4cup of apple sauce. It was still quite buttery! I also used buttermilk in place of milk - something I recommend. Enjoy!

Absolutely delicious. I have tried a number of different recipes and this is the best so far. No need to use softened butter, you can use melted butter just as easily without compromise of texture. If you like sweet cornbread this is the one! I add a few Tbsps of agave nectar for extra sweetness too. Like a previous reviewer, I used all whole wheat flour and just 2 eggs and you couldnt tell the difference.

This is a great recipe, I am new to making cornbread that is not just from a box.  I always add honey to my cornbread and I did so to this.  My kids loved it, my daughter even ate the leftovers for breakfast.  Wonderful recipe, thanks.

The cornbread was delicious. It went well both with stew for dinner and with jam the next day for breakfast. Should be stored in the fridge, though. It seems to spoil quite quickly.

AM-AZ-ING! I have never made cornbread before so I was a little worried but this recipe is SO GOOD! I followed the ingredients exactly as listed. Won't be trying any other recipes! I'm stuck on this one.

We're in the clear minority, but I didn't like this recipe.  We like cornbread, but this was more like cornbread cake.  It did not have enough texture or flavor.

This delicious corn bread is perfect for kids and cranky hubbies that are not sure whether they like cornbread. Sweet, light, moist, and not too grainy. Of course, if you are a cornbread fan, you might miss the gritty texture of cornmeal - there's not much in this recipe.

I grew up making cornbread from the recipe on the back of the Quaker cornmeal container.  It's a tried-and-true recipe and rather nostalgic.  This fall I decided to buck tradition and give this recipe a go and wow, it was heavenly!  The consistency of this cornbread is airy.  It's also sweet and crumbles perfectly, accompanying a pot of beans, stew, or chili well.  Hands down, this is the best cornbread recipe on this site.  It will replace Quaker's recipe from here on out.

Ok so my kids loved it...but it did not taste anything like corn bread!~  There is so little actual corn meal in the recipe that it really was more like a sweet bread (and very very sweet, I even used less sugar than it called for and it was still very sweet).  So I think this would make a great easy base but for me personally if I am looking for CORNBREAD, this needs a bit of work.

I reduce the sugar to 2/3 of a cup, and I also reduce the flour to 2 cups and increase the cornmeal to 1 and 1/3 cups. Next time I would also maybe like to try substituting buttermilk for the milk. Good recipe though, I do like it! It's very moist!

Easy to make.  

There are very few recipes on this site that I don't "doctor up" in some way.  I didn't have to change a thing.  Delicious just the way it is!

So light and fluffly, best corn bread ever. I only used 2 cups of flour; and a little more cornmeal than called for - about 1 1/3 cups. In the oven for 24 minutes. Delightful and buttery!! Went great with my "Simple Turkey Chilli" (another great recipe on here)!

I served this tonight to a bunch of Southern grad students living far from home, and we all loved it! There was none leftover. The only change I made was to switch the amounts of flour and corn meal; a change I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

I had never made cornbread myself prior to using this recipe, and all of my memories of cornbread involved my father taking over the entire kitchen for an hour or more, measuring and mixing and adding and subtracting ingredients at a dizzying speed, with a cast iron skillet hissing all the while in the background ... And the outcome being a heavy, dense, much too salty loaf of bread that I was never all that impressed with as a child.

So you can imagine how surprised I was to find out just how easy and quick making cornbread can be --- And, of course, the flavour was spectacular!

However, I wouldn't recommend this recipe to those looking for the type of saltier, denser cornbread my Dad used to make, as this cornbread is really more like sweet corncake than anything else!

Personally, though, I absolutely love it.

I did everything the recipe says except I melted bacon grease in a cast iron skillet and got it hot.  Then I poured  batter into skillet and put it into oven at 425 degrees.  Served it with honey butter.  Was the BEST corn bread EVER!!!

This went down like "a house on fire"... Fantastic! Delicious with Honey Butter or just by itself. Will definitely make it again. 

I live in South Africa and our flour categories are a bit different so if there are any South African's wanting to make this, I used some Self-Raising Flour that I had in the cupboard and didn't add the baking powder.  You can do that and it will turn out fine, though in the future I plan on making it according to the directions.

Followed to a tee! First time I ever made cornbread from scratch (usually I don't like cornbread, but this was great)! I only had whole grain cornmeal, so the texture was slightly grainy, but the taste was still AMAZING! Baked for the full 27 minutes.

I make this recipe for years, and my grandchildren love it. the one differance that I do,
instead of 1 cup sugar, I make it with 1/2 cup sugar, mix it with all the dry ingredients. then I melt the butter, + 1/2 cup honey, add the milk /or soy milk,  add the eggs blend well, pour to the dry ingredients mix just to blend.
Pour into warm heavy skillet with some butter
and bake it in pre-prepare 400 hot oven for about 20 minutes.
Enjoy.

I followed the recipe the no alteration. It was very good but not the best I've ever made. I agree with other reviewers that you should reduce the flour and add more corn meal.

I've never tasted cornbread this good, ever!  I read the reviews but really wasn't expecting to like it this much, as I'm not normally a cornbread fan, but I've eaten five pieces in two days.  It's really sweet, so if you don't like sweet cornbread you might not agree with me, but it's moist and delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.

I have always made the recipe on the back of the corn meal box, but not this time. This corn bread recipe is superb. It is almost cake like, soft, moist and tender. I have saved this and will making this for years to come!:)

For once, I made this recipe exactly as stated instead of changing things up. It turned out great. I am not a big cornbread fan but my family loves cornbread. This cornbread is sweet, which is how we like it, and turned out perfect. I wouldn't change a thing.

This was pretty crumbly. It is a deceiving corn bread, it looks dry at first but when you eat it, it is very moist. If I could figure out how to make it less crumbly it would be create.

I ran out of white flour and used whole wheat and it was EXCELLENT! If you enjoy whole wheat, give it a try. We hosted several families for dinner and every child ate seconds, from ages 1- 10! The top will get very dark and crusty which looked almost overcooked but the taste was great. Also, perhaps because I used whole wheat flour (?) it took longer to cook. We will be making this again.

Wow! A last-minute addition to a chili meal, and it turned out great!  I followed the recipe to the letter, using margarine, and using convect-bake at 400 for 22 min.  The crust was nice and crunchy, and the inside was melt-in your mouth! Thanks for sharing!

I've been making this cornbread for 2 years and it is my families favorite. After making this over 20 times, this is what i do to make it perfect. Add several tbsp of honey, reduce flour by one third cup, add more cornmeal by one third cup and add an additional one quarter cup of white sugar. Yes this will make it sweet but that is how my family likes it. I've also added an ear of corn to the mix and that is delicious as well. Best cornbread in the world hands down.

I also added a big squirt of honey to the batter and baked it in a 9x9 pan for 45-50 minutes.  After 30 minutes of baking I checked often to make sure it didn't over bake.  This is by far the best corn bread recipe ever!  It's moist like cake.

This was my first time making cornbread from scratch. The recipe was delicious. In this recipe, I used only 2 cups flour. I also added a dash of baking soda. This is a nice, Southern American treat.

Best cornbread I have ever made!  I had only a scant cup of cornmeal, and I still thought the flavor was excellent.  Used 2% milk. Definitely my go-to recipe from now on!

This is a great recipe, yielding a perfect corn bread flavor and at the right density.   I followed the recipe exactly, and found that it required more like 40-45 mins in the oven.   Thanks for sharing, this will be my go-to recipe for  Corn Bread!

This cornbread had a great flavor and texture! I truly appreciated the buttery flavor and as a result did not need to add any butter after it was baked! I accidentally added more milk than the recipe called for(I was enthralled by a television program and wasn't paying attention) and it still turned out perfectly! I opted to make this recipe over another because I didn't have any buttermilk on hand and refused a trip to the store for one ingredient! With that being said, I was very pleased with the outcome and will actually use this as my go to recipe from now on!

My husband always asks for moist sweet corn bread and I've looked and looked.  He ranted and raved about this one.  He LOVED it!!  My girlfriend calls this corn cake not corn bread, I've made it several times and he ooohs and awes each time so this is a keeper!!

Just made this tonight with some chili and it turned out awesome!  I didn't change a thing.  The one thing I don't understand is what is the point of initially mixing the items in three seperate bowls, when you are going to combine them and re-mix?  Why not just throw all items into the mixing bowl at once?  Other than that, awesome awesome recipe!

This was an ok recipe.  My husband said it was a little dry, and it did seem to dry up quickly by the next day even after being tightly covered.  It had a good flavor, though.  I think I just like more cake-like cornbread.

This corn bread was very tasty. The perfect sweetness. I added nutmeg for a little hint of fall flavor. Though I would have to say it was a bit too crumbly for me.

I was looking for a moist corn bread recipe.  This one fit the bill perfectly.  It was a great balance of flavor.  I added one ingredient which was 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla to the mix.  LOVED IT!

absolutely delicious. I would definitely recommend this recipe to anyone looking for a sweet cornbread. The only thing I would add is, once the oven is preheated muffins cook within 20 minutes, and longer and they burn quite fast. A must try recipe!

Very good though a bit too sweet. I will cut down on the sugar just a little next time. (I used xylitol which is birch sugar.) Served with Flatlander Chili from this site. Yum!

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out great with our homemade chili! Then the next morning we had some with some morning coffee.. delicious! If I were to change anything, then I would reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup and use honey as a substitute for the rest.

I'm a corn bread fanatic and this is the best home-made version I've come across.  I've since tried to healthify it a bit by using whole grain flour and will either cut down the sugar a bit with stevia, or will use half sugar (organic raw) and half erythritol - an all-natural sugar alcohol made from birchwood extract.  You truly cannot tell a difference.  Tasty!!!  p.s.  Here's a super fun tip for picky eaters - cut up hotdogs into thirds, place corn bread batter in muffin tins, and pop the cut up hotdogs in the middle before baking.  Healthy corn dogs that freeze beautifully and work well in a kid's lunch.  (of course my hubby and I have eaten more than our daughter has....)

Delectable. I used Bob's Blue Corn cornmeal at half cornmeal, half flour. Also a big squeeze of honey. I think the blue corn might need to cook a bit longer, but it is worth it as it has a lovely sweet flavour. This should be called corn cake. ;)

This recipe was also very easy, which is a bonus. Thank you!

I made this today, Super Bowl Sunday 2012, for the first time. I followed the recipe exactly. It was excellent and all my guests loved it also. 
It is a GREAT basic cornbread and needs no additions, but if you want to... go for it, it would take corn, jalapeños, sweet peppers, more sugar, more cornmeal, whatever you want to add. BUT, the basic recipe can definitely stand on its own.

My family really enjoyed this! I added some honey and took out a bit of flour so its not as thick. I reccomend not to bake in muffin tins as it dries out, making it in a pan lets it stays moist.

I have been looking for a good cornbread recipe and I found it! Moist, buttery, perfect! It did however make a little too much for the four of us, so I will probably cut recipe in half next time and bake in 8x8 pan instead

Tasted AWESOME, but it fell apart when it was picked up.  I added a dollop of honey to it as another review stated, not sure if that had something to do with it, but it kind of took away from it when you couldn't pick it up to eat it.  I would give five stars if it weren't for that.  All in all, was really good!

Light n fluffy and very easy to prepare. Definitely needs less flour and more cornmeal. Will try that next time. 
I used half the sugar and made them as cornbread muffins instead. I cut up a pack of bacon n lightly fried it, then added some of this to each muffin. I placed 2 spoonfuls of muffin batter in each muffin cup, then added the bacon, then topped with another spoonful of muffin batter. The result - yummy corn muffins well complimented by the bacon bites in the middle

This was excellent!  I even cut down the butter a little bit, don't know exactly how much I put in, but less than was called for.  
It was very tasty and soft.  I actually added a can of corn to it, without the juice, and that gave it an extra texture that was nice.

THIS IS AMAZING! I have always made corn bread from the box and it wasn't that good and most of the time it would stick to the pan really bad. When I made this, the whole pan was gone! It's tick, delicious, and makes a good amount! I will never follow another recipe except this one as long as I live! I'm cuban and my family has never had corn bread, soon we will be moving close to my family and when i make this for them they are going to die!!! that's how good it is!! & stack up on your buttery because it's not called buttery for no reason!!

Excellent!  I made this recipe with two very slight modifications: 1) I used sugar in the raw as it has a slight molasses flavor and 2) I made it as muffins.  It made 24 cornbread muffins.  I baked them in two batches of 12 at 400 for about 22 min.  As a new "cook" who just moved in with her boyfriend, I'm trying to find recipes we both can enjoy.  While I was making this recipe to go with a chili recipe I also found on the site my BF informed me he doesnt really like cornbread, but would at least try these.  He ended up eating 2 muffins and is excited about the leftovers (I will freeze some for future use.)   Thanks for helping this cooking impaired girl who only knew how to boil water and heat up a lean cuisine find a great recipe that I can use for a long time.  And for everyone who takes the time to write reviews please know that they are super helpful for people like me!

I used this cornbread for my thanksgiving stuffing, and it was a little too sweet for that purpose, but my southern cornbread-loving boyfriend loved the pieces i served him to tide him over til dinner... it also makes a great spoonbread when you add 1/4 cup melted butter and a can of creamed corn at the end and choose the shorter baking time

Mmm...loved this cornbread! Just decreased the flour by 1/3 cup, increased the cornmeal by the same amount & added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla (my family likes it on the sweeter side). Baked it in a HOT buttered cast iron skillet - yummy cornbread perfection!!!

This recipe makes a wonderfully moist tasty corn bread.  not the traditional 'corn meal' texture, more of a moist cake.  the favor can't be beat.  it is absolutely delicious!    -it's the New Year !  BE SURE TO BUY NEW BAKING POWDER!!  enjoy!  and THANKS

This is my go-to for cornbread. I do half corn meal and half flour and substitute the butter for Best Life buttery baking sticks. It makes quite a portion and isn't too gritty or too cake like. Perfect balance for all cornbread lovers. :)

I made one change that I am sure is not necessary. Instead of regular milk I used evaporated milk, exact measurements but the milk mixture half water half evaporated milk. This was a great recipe. I was a little bit nervous about the sugar but it came out fabulously. Not too sweet. I used a dark pan and I had to move the pan from the middle rack to the top rack at 22 minutes. I will definitely save this recipe to use again!

Best cornbread I've ever had! I took it to a chili cook-off and got a ton of compliments.  Went over very well with the family as well.  The sweet taste is terrific for cutting any spice in chili.

For me this was just okay, although my friend who is from the southern states loved it. I like my corn bread a little less sweet, so maybe next time I will add less sugar.

I don't know how I missed this recipe in my search for the perfect cornbread.  Made it exactly as written but as muffins after scaling the recipe down to 8 servings and it made 12 muffins filled with about 1/3 cup of batter each.  Baked for about 18 minutes and they were PERFECT.  I don't need to look for another recipe.  So good.

Great recipe.  I modified just a bit.  Used equal amounts of cornmeal and flour.  Next time will use 1/2 cup sugar instead of 2/3.  Very moist and buttery. One of my favorite recipes.

My husband says that this cornbread is better than his grandmothers - very high praise indeed!  I will never cook cornbread any other way.  It is moist and flavorful, even after a few days if it lasts that long!

Very good. Tender and fluffy, but a little too sweet for my taste.  I had already started the recipie and found I was short one egg, so proceeded with only two eggs. I also substituted the milk with buttermilk I needed to use up. Still turned out great. Next time I will reduce the sugar a bit.

I made twice. First I used a medium texture of cornmeal and substituted the flour with corn flour. It didn't rise as high as the one I made as the reciped stated but it was really good - almost creamy. The second one was according to the recipe and was wonderful as well.

I have been looking (for years) for a corn bread recipe that would be anything like the recipe my mom used.  Horray!  This is it!  Try it, you won't be disappointed!  This recipe made 20 nice sized corn bread muffins that took 20 min to bake at 400 in my oven.

Made exactly as stated but reduced recipe to 8 servings so could make in an 8x8 inch square pan (don't need a whole 9x13). It was superb. My loved it better than any cornbread I have ever made before. Will be our new recipe! (DO NOT overbake-- dries out!)

This was the BEST cornbread ever!!! Like another reviewer said I will NEVER buy box again. It was delicious with the perfect amount of sweetness. I made large muffins instead of a loaf and they were gobbled right up with some Black Bean Chili. Making again tonight. I orginally had them on October 7th.

Excellent!!!  Moist and delicious!  I did follow a recommendation by others to lessen flour and add cornmeal, so I changed the recipe to 2 c flour and   1 1/3 c cornmeal.  The texture was perfect.

It's probably fine as is, but I refuse to put that much sugar in cornbread so here are my tweaks:

Reduce sugar to 1/2 cup and milk to 1 1/2 to compensate.

Do as everyone suggests and change to 1 1/3 cup cornmeal and just 2 of flour.

Grease cast iron skillet (you'll need a big one, I think mine is 10") and heat in 400' oven.  Then pour in cornbread and it's perfectly done in 20-22 minutes or so.  Do not overcook, trust your toothpick :)

This cornbread was perfect!  Served it with the homemade chili and was delic.  Like others,  i used 1 1/2 cups of cornmeal and 2 cups of flour.  Otherwise i went according to the recipe.  Perfect with any meal,  especially the chili.

Like another reviewer, this was my first time making corn bread.  It was SO good!  I might have preferred it a little sweeter, so I may add a little more sugar next time, but it was delicious.  My husband and I both loved it.  It was fairly easy to make, which was a huge plus for beginners like me.  I will definitely be making this again.

I followed the recipe as it was, as with baking things can be a bit funny. This bread had amazing flavor and was moist. Didn't last a week in our house! 

One complaint and the only reason it's not 5 stars is it was too crumbly. I like my bread to be a bit firm and have more spring in it. Might be the altitude we are at (6500 ft). Next time I will use less flour and more corn meal...cutting back on the flour cuts back on the crumbles. Also, mixing the flour in more will help release the gluten which will bond everything together.

Never made corn bread before, and I have to say it turned out fantastic. I put in 1.5 cups of corn meal and 1.75 cups of flour for taste preference, but that is it.

Delectable!  Used 2 cups flour, 1 1/3 corn meal, baked 30 minutes for a golden cast, covered up immmediately to retain moisture....will try less sugar next time, but absolutely delicious as is.

This absolutely HAS to be the BEST corn bread recipe I have ever tried!  Every time I have made this, I have to double, sometimes triple it because my family can make it dissappear in no time.  I have made this recipe each time without making any changes - it is perfect as-is.  Thank you so much for sharing!

This is the best recipe I've ever had. My family is from the south (Kansas City, KS; Slidell, LA; Tyler, TX). My kids not only ate it for dinner, but turned it into a desert by adding caramel and ice cream on top of it later. You CANNOT go wrong with this recipe!

Best cornbread ever- after many alterations. Soymilk for milk, skipped the eggs, replaced half the butter with olive oil, 1/2 c flour with more cornmeal, handful of flaxmeal added along with a can of drained mexicorn. ANd I mistook the Bk Powder for BK soda- fortunately I only added 3 tsp... salty but delish. Oh, and I had to cook it for probably 45 minutes. Eat with Chili!

I don't know if it is just my oven, or if others are having this problem too... It came out dark on top but half raw inside, so took some tweaking. Next time I think I'll bake it at a much lower heat for longer. It tastes great though! (I did add extra sugar because I like my corn bread sweet)

I followed the recipe exactly, I did not make a single substitution or add anything it didn't call for. It came out very dry and crumbly.  If anyone has any advice please let me know as I would like to try it again with some tips.

I won't make boxed cornbread anymore! This is cake-like, but its so creamy and soft its amazing. I hate how crumbly regular cornbread can be. This is just the opposite! Love it.

I have tried many five star recipes and thought so-so.  This is definitely a five star.  As per other reviewers suggestions, I made a few changes but the original recipe is excellent also.  After several variations, my favorite is with the following changes: buttermilk instead of regular milk, 1 3/4 C flour and 1 1/3 + 1/4 C of cornmeal.  I didn't have any canned corn in the house so I used not quite a full jar of Trader Joe's corn salsa, drained.  It gave the muffins just the right bite.  Also, I made mini muffins, baking them 10 - 11 minutes.  It makes 5 1/2  to 6 dozen minis.  Actually, second time around, I made half plain and half with not quite half a jar of the corn salsa.  Try this, you'll like it.

Whoa.  I have never been so excited about corn bread before, but this stuff is perfect!  Even with having to wait for my husband to buy the baking powder, it still was amazing.  Fantastic recipe.  Will definitely use again and again...

this recipe sounds great as is, but i made it with rice flour and splenda, then added a can of creamed corn.  it was FANTASTIC even my husband (who very much dislikes normal corn bread) ate it day after day until it was gone.

It came out good; I just had to make sure not to over bake it.  The 3rd time I made it - I made it with 2 c flour and 1 1/3 c cornmeal and added about 1/4 c honey, it came out nice and moist and with a definite corn flavor.

My nine year old son and I made this the other night.  This was the BEST corn bread I have ever had! It was moist and tasty. The only problem was that we didn't make enough. My son is convinced that his influence was what made it so great.  Maybe.

I didn't get to taste the fruits of my labor, but I was told everyone at the potluck said it was the best cornbread they ever had.  I added about 1/2 cup honey.

I made it as is the first time and rated it based on original recipe.  Call it a thing, but when I make corn bread, I think there should be more corn than flour.  So the second time I used 2 1/2 cups corn meal and 1 1/2 cups flour.  Also added 2/3 cup molasses for sweetness and color.  Good recipe on its own, but I think my tweaking made it great CORN bread.

This was awesome.  I halved the recipe and baked in a cast iron skillet for 25 minutes at 375.  This is a very sweet cornbread.

Very delicious!! Cooked to a T with the exception of using 1 cup of brown sugar instead of regular sugar.  I used Arrowhead Organic Cornmeal.  This recipe was great coming from someone who traditionally used Jiffy (which is slightly sweet which our family likes).  I am a new cornmeal from scratch convert!!  It was extremely simple and easy to make!

Nice recipe.  Whole family liked it.  I did adjust the flour/cornmeal to 2 c. flour, 1 1/3 cornmeal, because I like my cornbread a little more corny.  The only thing I didn't like, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, was that it wasn't that quick to make and took 3 bowls so not easy clean up.  But that's my laziness complaining.  For flavor it was a 5.

This recipe was fabulous! It really is a good starting point for your "own" cornbread recipe. I reduced the amount of sugar (since my fiance doesn't like a really sweet cornbread) and did half and half of cornmeal and flour to give it less of a cake-like consistency. I made this with homemade chili and it was perfect! Will be making again soon. Thank you!

OMG!  This is by far some of the best cornbread I've had in a long time, and I've tried many.  Wonderful texture with out being to grainy and nice and moist.  I only used 1/2 c. of sugar because of my own preferences and it was still plenty sweet but dangerously good!  I will look no further, this is now my cornbread recipe.  Can't wait to make Mexican cornbread with it.  Thank you for the great recipe.

In our home we love cornbread, and this is the best I have ever served to my family and friends. I made it in my Cuisinart and it came together so nicely. I could tell it was going to be fabulous because it was thick and creamy and smelled wonderful. It is really perfect just as is and I would not alter anything. I may next time try to add a can of corn just to see how that would alter it. Kudo's to the chef.

I have tried oh so many corn bread and corn muffin recipes, only to be disappointed. THIS is a GREAT recipe. Full cornbread taste. I may try using buttermilk next time as an experiment, but it is fabulous just the way it is. Definitely best when eaten shortly after cooking.

Yum! I halved the recipe and cooked it in a (pre-heated with a tad of olive oil) cast iron skillet. I split the all-purpose flour with half whole wheat and it was superb. Nice texture. (Not at all authentic for Southerners who don't eat sweet cornbread, but if you think of it as something else altogether, it's delicious.)

This cornbread turned out more like yellow cake, so it's great if you like sweeter cornbread. Next time I'll use more cornmeal, one less egg, and less sugar, to get a more savory cornbread.

YUMMY! WOW! I used cupcake trays which made me 24 muffins and cooked for only 22 min. I patted about 4-5 pickled jalapeno slice dry with a paper towel before placing them on top. SWEET, BUTTERY, SPICY! The other tray I added cheddar cheese on top. Cooked them at the same time.  I took one of each and added them to a corn and 3 bean spicy chili. YUM YUM YUM! PERFECT CORN BREAD! PS If you LOVE spicy you should add more jalapenos mixed in the batter because it was pretty mild for me.

wow, does this need another 5 star rating? Very tasty, the perfect sweetness, moistness, and texture. Very good. I followed the recipe exactly and could not stop eating it. This one is a good one to use during Thanksgiving without giving it a test-run. It's that good.

A-MAZ-ING! I know... some think that corn bread is corn bread, but honestly, this corn bread is a cut above the rest. Soooo moist -- I find that corn bread can be crumbly or get crumbly after a day or two... this kept it's moist texture. All of my "samplers" (friends, boyfriend, parents) raved about this. A keeper this is!

This is an ok recipe if you are not looking for a good old fashioned cornbread recipe.  This recipe tastes too breadyw, like it didn't have enough cornmeal.  I didn't try reversing the proportions of cornmeal to flour (I made it according to recipe), but it sure tasted like I should have.  Even Jiffy mix has more of a cornmeal taste!  If you don't like old fashioned souther cornbread, this may be the recipe for you.

Best cornbread I've ever tried to make! Got so many compliments on it. And it's versatile! It was a nice side to dinner, a quick add-on to breakfast, and it was even soft/cakey enough to be eaten warm with vanilla icecream for dessert!

following others' comments, i reduced sugar to 3/4c and increased the cornmeal by 1/2c and reduced flour by 1/2c.  very tasty.  next time around i may add a little more butter to make it more dense/moist and try the full sugar to see what that flavor tastes like.

The ONLY thing less than perfect about this cornbread was that it was a little crumbly.  Great taste and very moist.  I used powdered milk and mixed it in with the dry ingredients and put water in with the eggs.

This cornbread is moist and fluffy, not flat and dry like so many. I didn't use nearly as much sugar as the recipe calls for, but I don't like sweet cornbread whereas my husband does. I creamed 1 whole stick of butter with about 4 tbsp sugar, along with about 3 or 4 tbsp of whole wheat flour and a splash of milk. I reduced the flour to 1 1/2 cups and increased the cornmeal to 1 1/2 cups. After I poured the batter into the pan, I drizzled a heaping tbsp or two of honey on one half of the batter. I swirled the honey into the half of the batter and folded it in with great results. My half was not overly sweet, and my husband's half was as sweet as he likes it. Next time I will add a can of regular sweet corn to the mix. This is my new cornbread recipe!

I had never attempted cornbread before. I chose this one because it was basic and not too difficult. It was certainly a hit at the barbeque. Everyone commented on the great taste and texture. All I did was follow the directions as set out. I enjoyed it, and will certainly make it again soon. Five stars for sure.

I have adjusted this recipe like many others - added more cornmeal and 1/4 cup honey and reduced the amount of sugar by the equivalent amount. What I added was corn from a roasted cob that added an amazing amount of flavor and texture. I brought this in for an office pot luck and thanks to the recipe, it disappeared among many, many dishes. But I cannot recommend enough adding fresh corn to this recipe - especially if you have it in-season.

This is my new go to corn bread recipe, it is so good! Made a few changes, used 3/4 cup sugar, added a squirt of honey, decreased the flour to 2 cups and increased the cornmeal to 1 1/3 cup. I made it into muffins and baked for about 15 minutes. Turned out perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

i thought it was great.  I added an additional 1/3 cup of cornmeal and omitted 1/3 cup of flour.  It was "corny" enough for us.  It was sweet, but not too much and these are good even without butter on top.  I think honey in the batter would be DIVINE!! I was able to make 22 muffins filled 2/3 to the top.

I made this up a bit differently than the recipe said - I mixed the cornmeal and milk first and let that sit.  Then I creamed the butter and sugar and added the egg to that.  I mixed the two wet mixtures together, then added the salt, baking powder, and flour.  I also substituted brown sugar for white, as I thought that would make it more flavourful.  What I ended up with was not cornbread.....my brother dubbed it "Pancakebread"!  It looks, smells, and taste exactly like pancakes.  It's even better than real pancakes because it soaks up the syrup so well.  My brother - who is autistic and therefore an extremely picky eater - said it was the best thing I'd ever made.  That's about the highest praise you can get, Nicole!  I love it even though it wasn't what I intended to make.  I'll be making this a lot from now on!

I didn't find this dry at all. I made exactly according to recipe, only brushing a bit of butter on the top right as it came out of the oven, as katielovestobake recommended. Quite buttery, which I love. I think I would have prefered it to be more corn-y, but a good bread recipe as is.

This recipe is perfect AS IS!!! It was delicious!! I always bake cornbread and try different recipes. My family of 6 complimented it and said it was the best one yet. We had friends over for dinner and they couldn't get enough of it! They still rave about it. Delicious! Thank you for the recipe.

I am not a big fan of cornbread, but this is one of the best recipes I've found.  The reason I typically don't like cornbread is that it is too dry.  However, this recipe was very moist and everyone enjoyed it.  Made it exactly as the recipe called for - did not change a thing.  This will be my "go to" recipe for cornbread from now on.

I can't have sugar and white flour because of health reasons, however, I decided to make this for my family to go along with a vegetable-beef soup.  To quote my daughter "This is the best cornbread I've ever had in my life and I am not a big cornbread fan!"  Since this came from a 15 year old, I'm going to give it a 5 star rating.  I have no clue how it really tastes, but since they all ate it and thought it was terrific, that speaks enough for me.

Delicious.  Made as specified.  Good balance of sweetness, fine texture, and it will not crumble when you hold it.  I made it for my friend's thanksgiving potluck dinner.

My husband and I loved this cornbread!!  We recently moved to Australia and are quickly finding that most of the "staples" we use at home (such as boxed Jiffy cornbread!!) aren't here!  I was able to find "polenta" which is either the same, or very close to, cornmeal and so that's what I used to make this cornbread.  It was awesome!  I just might give up the boxed stuff forever!  Thank you for a great recipe!

I used whole wheat flour instead of the white and evaporated cane juice sugar instead of processed sugar and it tasted great. I followed the advice of one review and only used 1/2 cup of sugar but next time I will use the whole cup because I could barely taste the sugar.

This is an AWESOME recipe for corn bread!  I like it on the sweeter side, and this was PERFECT.  I also did part of the batch as muffins instead of as directed, and that took the exact same amount of time to bake and was a BIG HIT with my 6 year old son!

I am currently in Africa, with limited cooking resources, but was craving some home food. So I decided to make this recipe. This recipe was easy to make and I could find all the ingredients necessary to make it. It was delicious as well! It gave me the comfort food that I was wanting.

Man this was some good cornbread although instead of using the whole 1 and 2/3 of a cup of milk,  I used 1 cup of milk and 2/3's of a cup of buttermilk and added about 1/4 of a cup of honey...It wasn't too sweet and it wasn't dry at all...Good Recipe!!

Some friends were coming over with red beans and rice and just on a whim I found this recipe and threw it together.  It was so delicious and easy I made it again the next day to go with lunch!  I will never go back to boxed cornbread.

Sweet and flavorful.  Makes a BIG batch.  I did not have enough of any one kind of butter, so I used 4T salted butter, 2T unsalted butter, and 4T margarine.

I have never been able to make good corn bread until now.  Thank you!
The only thing I did differently was I added about 3/4 can of creamed corn before pouring the batter into the pan.  It just took a few minutes longer to bake.

I love the texture of this corn bread, and it is so moist!  I added chopped green chilis and 3/4 cup frozen (thawed) corn for fun.  It turned out great!

I usually don't like cornbread because it's too crumbly, especially the second day, but this recipe came out perfect.  I used 1/2 cup of honey and 1/2 cup of sugar and did everything else exactly as directed, and it turned out moist, sweet, and perfectly cooked after 25 minutes.  Only a little bit was left over, and it's tasty even on day two!

Awesome cornbread! I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out delicious. It was definately better on the first day when it was warm out of the oven - doesn't warm up very well the next day. Even my husband, who claims to "hate cornbread" loved it - I plan to make this again!

i used this recipe on Turkey day and it came out great.  however, i made a few changes since i am quite the little  baker, lol.  i used 2 cups of flour, 1 1/3 cups of cornmeal plus a little extra and 1 1/2 cup of sugar.  i also sifted all the dry ingredients.  becuase i used  more cornmeal the  top of it came out crunchy, delish!  i also add creamed corn to my cornbread, keeps it  moist and it's somewhat sweet so you can lessen some of the sugar you put in.  all in all, very tasty.

I absolutely love this recipe. I usually make it exactly as its written. However, this time  due to accommodating a wheat allergy, I  modified the recipe by substituting corn flour for the wheat flour. The substitution worked well,  and the corn bread taste as rich and fluffy as when made with wheat flour, maybe even better!

This is amazing. I am requested to bring it to BBQs all the time.  If you have left overs just cut a piece in half and "toast" is in some butter on a pan. Top with a touch of maple syrup.  A little piece of heaven.

This is by far the best cornbread recipe I have ever stumbled upon. The bread is moist without losing the essence of grainy cornbread. This cornbread is really really good--perfection even. Even my sister who is not a big fan of cornbread loves it. I plan to use this recipe over and over! thank you!!!

This was a very easy recipe for sure! I used silicone baking pans and had perfect muffin form. I do echo the comments of someone else that I would prefer more corn meal to flower. I will modify that a bit next time. Doesn't change the fact it's a great recipe!

Best and easiest cornbread to make! I was cooking for a friend and he said he wanted cornbread. Well, I have never made cornbread in my entire life and decided to give this one a try!  This recipe is a keeper! He LOVED it! He ranked it next to his mom's cornbread! (and that is hard to get by) It was moist and sweet tasted amazing! I don't even really care for cornbread, but I couldn't stop eating this! I baked it for exactly 22 minutes. The only thing is that it did fall apart quite easily, but that can be blamed on my part for not mixing it how it explained. Definitely worth trying once in your life!

very well received, i took away 1/3 flour and added 1/3 cornmeal.  Delish!  Next time maybe will add some jalepeno flakes to give it a sweet/spicy flavour.

Best corn bread ever!  After trying 13 different recipies for my son's graduation this was by far the best!  The recipie makes approx 24 muffins and freezes extreemly well.  After making 23 dozen of these I wouldn't change a thing!  MANY reqeusts for the recipe at the reception.

This is a keeper.  Thanks so much for sharing.   So very moist and buttery with just enough sweetness.  I had to bring to work to keep myself from eating the whole container.   You will enjoy

This is the BEST corn bread recipe I have ever tried.  My Uncle came home from California and I made it to serve alongside my Aunt's chili.  He said it was better than my great-grandmother's recipe that he used to eat as a child.  This is definitely a keeper! Thanks, Nicole.

Love it! I had been using a mix from Costco but had bought some corn meal in the bulk section today and found this recipe (I used this one since I didn't have any buttermilk, but that one looks popular too). Ground my cornmeal a bit more using my spice mill, but essentially followed the recipe. Came out fantastic. Easy too. I won't be buying the mix anymore because my kids like this one much better.

Excellent. Very Fluffy.

I did not have much milk so did 1/2 milk and 1/2 tap water. Also added about 2 Tbsp of honey and that gave it a great sweetness.

This is the best cornbread recipe i found that seems easy. I cooked it once to the recipe but melted the fat and poured in rather than creaming it and it came out really nice and a light crumbly texture. I also used 30g less flour and 30g more cornmeal. I will use a bit less sugar next time tho  yummy

As others have said, no need to change anything.  Works just fine the way it is.  Tried this last night with some Memphis dry rub ribs and worked out perfectly.  Just the right tender and moist bread to the flavourful meat.  

Just a side note that I definitely needed it in the oven a little longer than 27 minutes.  I will contribute that to the smaller pan that I used which caused the bread to be slightly thicker.  You may wish to check the time based on your pan size and your oven's own unique heat signature.

This was pretty good - didn't disappoint, though not as good as I've had.  A little crumbly when you try to cut them 5 minutes out of the oven, so I'd wait more like 10  - 15.

This is the best corn bread I have ever tasted!  The only thing that i did differently is I added corn that I froze last summer and cooked it a little longer (I think the corn made it a wetter batter).  Fantastic recipe. Thank you!

For those of you who watch the Big Bang Theory, the Sheldon in my life simlpy reviewed this as 'splended', and coming from him thats worth a thousand words of praise. I followed the recipe as far as I was able- I did however add a dollop of honey, and i didn't have any cornmeal. No Cornmeal?? I nearly flipped my lid, but in the end I had to use cornflour. For anyone in the same situation, there is no taste difference. Trust me, my fella would have said so ;P Thanks Nicole!

This was a hit with the kids.  I made it to go with chili.  I used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat.  I had to use the blender for the batter because the butter had a lot of chunks.

Perfect amount of sweetness. I coated my pan in Crisco to give it a crunchy outside.

Improvised this great cornbread recipe by adding 1/2 c sugar vs. 1 cup and lessened (is that a word?) the flour by 3/4 c but added that amount more of corn meal.  I listoned to The 2 other recipe raters who said it was a bit too sweet and not enough cornmeal.  I like it corny!  Came out great, probably a bit denser but very good.  This is one I'll print out to use again.

I made this recipe exactly as it was written but found that the taste of baking soda was a bit too prevalent. Had I reduced the amount of baking soda the end result would have been an A+. Despite the baking soda flavor the cornbread was extremely soft/moist  and buttery.

Fantastic recipe. This was my first time making cord bread and it turned out great! I was a little worried when pouring the batter into the pan to bake, it was an odd texture but it bakes up very nicely. It went great with chili!

I added ~1/2 teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper and baked it in a 12" iron skillet.  When it came out, I drizzled 1 tablespoon of honey and 1 tablespoon of butter cut into dabs over the top.  DELICIOUS!

This is our family's favorite cornbread recipe now. I've made it three or four times and am just getting around to reviewing it, but the combination of price, taste, texture, and ease make it a five-star comfort food recipe for me. The only change I make is to cut the sugar by approximately half, which it just a matter of taste. Actually, the reason I pulled it up today was that I'm taking this to a get-together this afternoon, where I know it will be well received. Thank you for the recipe!

This is a good base recipe but needs some work to make it great. It does need less flour, more cornmeal. I added corn kernels  and honey to the batter. I sprinkled crushed dried rosemary ontop before baking. Next time I'll top with coarse sea salt in addition to the rosemary then drizzle with honey. 

I was going to give this 4 stars then realized that many adjustments are needed. Sorry, this is too bland for 4-5 stars.

I always 1/3 the recipe for my husband and I. Best one I've found on here, yet is still missing something. Maybe next time I'll add some honey and cut the sugar. Still very good though, moist with a good texture and little bit sweet with out being overly sugary.

Oh my gosh; I could have eaten half the pan in 1 setting!  It was fabulous.  It had a sweet taste, and I'm a bit of a sugar addict so I loved that.  With the butter (I used real butter) I didn't need to butter it when I ate it either.

I made this to serve with chili...everyone raved about it! I decreased the flour by 1/3 cup and added 1/3 cup of cornmeal as suggested by another reviewer, but I'm sure it would have been fantastic even without the changes. I'm sure this is going to be requested again! Thanks for the awesome recipe!!!

This is one of the best corn bread recipes! Because I didn't have any milk, I substituted it with half evaporated milk and half water. It turned out great and I think it even made it a little sweeter! Its almost like eating cake! I think I am going to make muffins out of them and put jelly in the centers :)

This is a nice buttery corn bread. I wasn't familiar with it before but decided to make it anyways. It turned out great & the whole family loved it. We will be making it again.

I made this to go along with chilli and it was a huge success. Everyone at the party raved about the cornbread and how tasty it was. It had a nice buttery flavor without being greasy and was soft without falling apart. Loved it!

I fixed this corn bread to go with chili. While the flavor was good, the corn bread was heavy. I prefer a lighter bread. Any suggestions. I followed directions exactly and really did enjoy the sweetness.

I liked this recipe as a starting point. However I feel the corn meal to white flower ratio is heavy on the white flower. I used 2 cups of corn meal and less white flower. Also adding a half cup of maple syrup took it up a knotch ;)

It was a perfectly dense cornbread. I am looking for something a bit sweeter though, so next time I'll add more sugar and maybe add in some honey.

This is a great recipe. I love how it's simple, yet tastes so good! I've made it two times thus far. Both times it has received rave reviews from the family. It's soft, sweet, and a great compliment to chili!

It was delicous and so easy. I used 1/3 less flour and 1/3 more cornmeal and honey as others had suggested . So buttery and moist. It was a hit with everyone. 
Thanks for sharing!!

Perfect!!! Just the right amount of sugar for me. I added a teaspoon of honey for an added kick(personal preference).
I have been looking for a wonderful corn bread recipe...and found it! Thanks for sharing Nicole!!

Fabulous and addictive!! Very dense but moist. I did add more cornmeal and less flour (1 2/3 c each) but everything else was this recipe. Sweet and corny, almost as good as Jiffy. The whipping of the butter and sugar probably helped it get the right texture.

Simple, easy and tasty. Can't ask for more than that. I used butter milk (I had extra from another recipe and I wanted to use it up) instead of milk and used more corn meal than flour. Also, I added about 2 tablespoons of honey, from what the other reviewers said it sounded delicious and I prefer my cornbread pretty sweet.

I used white corn meal (purely because I didn't have any traditional corn meal on hand) and the bread came out so light and sweet! It's really great warm with a little butter and honey!

Taste overall is not bad....a pretty good cornbread BUT not buttery at all. NOT bad cornbread but it didn't taste to far off what you can make from a box. Still in search of a real buttery corn bread that doesn't leave that dry taste in ur mouth

This is a great corn bread recipe.  I got a lot of compliments.  I thought it could be just a little more moist though.

Everyone loved this. It is super light, more cake-like. Might try iy with more cornbread and less flour but then, why mess with a home run?

I go through a lot of recipes from this site trying to find the perfect one. I had to comment on this one. It is amazing. So good! I made it exactly how the recipe stated except I put it into muffin cups instead of the pan simply because it's easier for the kids to just grab and go, than have to cut. The entire family LOVED it. Best corn bread recipe ever. I'm at high altitude as well, and they still came out great, just lowered the heat to 350 degrees and cooked for less time. Perfect, Perfect, PERFECT!!!

I enjoyed this corn bread. The only thing that I did not like about it was that is did fall apart pretty easy. Other than that the taste was great and it was super easy to make.

My husband LOVED this cornbread and he doesn't like cornbread normally. I did add an 1/8th cup of honey to the recipe and it turned out perfect! This will be the only recipe we will use from now on for cornbread.

This cornbread was delicious! Everyone loved it! I made it with chili and had some friends over. They're both from the south so I must admit, I was a little nervous that this cornbread wouldn't be as good as what they're used to having. However, it was a HUGE hit! Completely gone at the end of the night. My husband even asked me to make another batch the next day to eat with the leftover chili! I did add about 1/4 c honey to mine! So good!!

This bread is wonderfully buttery and has great texture, but I agree with a previous reviewer, it needs more cornmeal and less flour.  I also added a generous squirt of honey and it is just sweet enough.  I did a half batch (used 2 eggs and slightly less milk than called for to accommodate the extra liquid from the egg) and cooked it in a loaf pan for about 30-33 mins and it had a great crust to it.  Definitely a great recipe as it stands, but could be tweaked to be fantastic.

Moist, flavorful, and delicious! I made this recipe for a New England Labor Day party (to go with lobsters, drawn butter, fresh corn, clam chowder, cole slaw, blueberry pie). It was a hit! I did reduce the flour and up the corn meal as others suggested which gave it a real corn taste. This is a very sweet "cake" more than "bread", but only one person complained, everyone else loved it. I will definitely make again.

I followed the advice of others and increased the cornmeal to 1 1/3 cup and decreased the flour to 2 cups. This is truly the best cornbread recipes I have tried to date!  No more looking for me....  I can't wait to bring this to a dinner party to show off!

The original recipe is fine, more of a cake-consistency tho. I prefer a more corny flavored/texture corn bread-- so the 2nd time I used 2 cups flour, and 1  1/3 cup cornmeal- it was fantastic!
Cover the pan immediately after taking out of the oven- makes it even more moist for the next day!!!

This was the most delicious cornbread that I've ever had! The only thing I did different was I put 2 cups flour and 1+1/3 cups cornmeal. Definitely making it again!

This was great. I've tried several other corn bread recipes- fancy and simple- and they're always either too greasy or too dry and crumbly. This one was perfect! The search ends. I like my cornbread a little grainier, and the cake-like comments made me nervous, so I did do as another reviewer posted and increased the cornmeal by 1/3 cup and decreased the flour by the same. I thought it was just right. And still great, if not better, cold and leftover the next day. (good thing because there's lots leftover!)

Turned out PERFECT! Much better than any mix, and not much more complicated to make (and doesn't contain lard/animal fat like most packaged mixes do).

When I first tried it when I took it out of the oven I thought that the baking powder was overwhelming.  However, it was much better after it cooled a little bit.   It turned out being really moist and not as crumbly as some recipes.  It makes a lot of cornbread for my husband, 22 month old, and I but it was great for the next two days!  Make sure it is well wrapped.

I really enjoyed this recipe. For ease of measuring, I used 11Tblsp of butter rathan 2/3 cup ( Lazy me, I didn't feel like using a measuring cup). It tastes great, has great flavor. Bakes up nice and high. I make this into muffins. It is great with additional add-ins like jalapenos/chilli powder for Mexi-cornbread, can't imagine this not being equally if not more tasty with cheddar cheese. As an added depth of flavor, I added mace, which I add to most anything corn, but only a very small amount. Mace adds even more of a 'sweet butter' taste without adding more butter...I think 11Tblsps is enough. Great recipe!!

I made a pot roast with potatoes, carrots, onions, green peppers and garlic in beef broth, made a pot of cabbage but didn't have a jiffy corn bread mix.  I searched for a good corn bread recipe and saw this.  I made it and I it will stand with Jiffy and any of the rest of the store bought brands.  OMG...I LOVE it!!!

yummm ... i added corn kernels and made it as  muffins, cooking on 375 for about 15-20 min. ... yeilded a little more batter than 12 muffins so I made the rest in a very small casserole pan I had and I actually think that was better so unless you like the ease of having muffins around it is probably best in the 9x13.  Probably the best I have made, def a 5 star worthy recipe!

delicious! i used white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, and sunflower milk because i had some. i also added a can of corn to the mix. I was astonished at how sweet it was-- ended up eating quite a it of the batter before i even stuck it in the over because it was so tasty! I think It might end up being too sweet after a couple of days, though. Still, definitely a recipe i will use again!

I made this recipe last night to go along with a barbecue.  It was very good.  I decreased the flour by the 1/3 cup and increased the cornmeal 1/3 cup.  I was worried about the density.  Once the pan cooled and was ready to eat it was the perfect, just-crumbly enough consistency for enjoying!

Follow this recipe to the letter and you will not be disappointed!  I made muffins and adjusting the amount to 9 servings to equal 1 stick of butter. It actually made 12 muffins. (Perfect size)They tasted more like cake than bread and I made a honey frosting... People went crazy for them. One time I added 1 cup corn kernals for a more rustic flavore and they were amazing!

Made this tonight and did not change a thing in the recipe. We loved it! It does have a creamier texture than my regular cornbread recipe, which does not have butter and only 1 egg. We liked this one so much better than my old recipe. This will become my go-to cornbread recipe from now on. Thanks!

If you choose wheat bread over white this is not the recipe for you! Way too much flour and sugar. Not grandma's southern cornbread in my book.

Simple and exellent. My planned dish (a complicated one) for a potluck FAILED on construction. I had this ready as a quick replacement in minutes. I might try a maple sugar replacement for the regualr sugar and a light glaze to make this a full on sweet dessert treat, but I digress. This was great as is, with no changes.

I've made alot of Corn Bread over the years and this is the BEST recipe yet.  Light, fluffy and rich.  The only thing I changed was to add one diced halapeno for some spice.  Two thumbs up.

My family absolutly loved this corn bread. My son said we should have it every night with dinner!! I thought it was way too sweet and it was more like cake. I like a savory corn bread. But, it was a big hit at my house! Keep in mind it is sweet!

Moist and delicious! I've been using the ol' Betty Crocker recipe and didn't think there was much you could do to improve cornbread... but this recipe is so delicious I eat it like cake (with honey and butter). Thanks!

LOVE IT!!!!!  I was a little worried about how much flour it had when I first tried the recipe, but you don't even notice, it always turns out delicious.  The only thing we did different was add a good squirt of honey which made it even better. I will make this recipe over and over!

The best corn bread I have ever made.  I added a 12oz can of corn (drained) and  one anaheim pepper.  The pepper made it pretty spicy, however it went well with the taco soup I made to go with it.

This is an awesome cornbread. I was looking for a sweet, fluffly, moist recipe and followed it exactly. It came out awesome. I guess I would possibly add a little more sugar next time, but other than that it came out perfect.

This was very good but maybe a bit on the dry side.  I have doubled the portion for everything and 1 loaf and a full glass tray of 13x9x5.  It goes very well with chilli.  The corn bread was still very good after 4 days stored on the counter.

Good recipe I make with whole wheat flour. I tried using coconut oil in one attempt and it was good but too much coconut flavor. I add a can of cream corn to the recipe before baking and it stays super moist!

This is an awesome cornbread recipe...many are so dry--but not this one!
Sifted the flour--I added 3 tbs of sourcream-used SmartBalance instead of butter...used 2/3 cup sugar and 1/3 agave nectar..added 1/4 cup more cornmeal...came out so moist! 
Family cant' stop eating them!!!

Very good. Could perhaps use a little more corn meal. But such a fast and easy addition to a meal.

awesome. i didn't used to like "sweet" cornbread, but this recipe has changed my mind. after making it, at first i thought i should have added less white flour and more cornmeal, but two days and 8 pieces later, i think it's fine how it is

This is a great recipe. It doesn't need a full cup of sugar though. I used 2/3cup of sugar. It is very moist (for cornbread) and I will definitely keep it as my go to recipe. It works well as muffins too. This would also be very nice with blueberries mixed in for a brunch/breakfast muffin. Thanks.

Very Yummy. I made a few modifications. My family loved it. Plenty sweet I cant imagine adding more sugar. I used Whole Wheat four. It still came out so moist. I baked the 12 serving size, I cut down the flour by 1/3 cup and added 1/3 cup more cornmeal. I also cut the milk down by 2/3 cup and used 2/3 sour cream.

So I made some really yummy additions. The first is to use 1/3cp coconut oil and 1/3 cp butter(in place 2/3 butter). I added some sweetness by using 1/2 cp honey 1/2 cp sugar (in place of the 1 cp sugar). I only used 1 1/3cp flour, and 2cp ground pollenta/cornmeal. Then I sprinkled the top with frozen corn kernels before putting it in the oven. Turned out so nice and moist and yummy!!! A true favorite!

This corm bread is absolutely unreal!!  Having grown up in the south, I've had lots of delicious corn bread in my day, made by some pretty amazing cooks (Grandmas, Aunts, Mom) and this recipe is right there at the top.  It's moist, sweet and buttery, just how corn bread should be.  I will be making this corn bread for years to come!

I have been looking for a recipe just like this! It is wonderful and cakey, but that is what I like.  I would definitely recommend reducing the sugar to at least 1/2 cup if you just want it sweet enough but not like a dessert.  I also added 1/2 cup of sour cream and it's great!

This cornbread recipe is delicious and buttery, just like it's name. I didn't have regular milk and substituted heavy cream for the milk. I really liked the effect. The corn bread was sweet and had wonderful flavor, of course at full fat content. I'll definitely be making this treat more often now!

This is a great recipe. It is very sweet which I like but others may not :) I did take advice from someone else and do more corn bread than it calls for. So I did half regular flour and half cornmeal...turned out amazing! I had it with homemade chili...mmmm.

This is a lite and moist cornbread.  The recipe as written makes a ton of cornbread. Instead of using regular milk, I used Silk's vanilla soymilk.  I personally like my cornbread painfully sweet, so, the next time I make this I will probably add an 1/4 or 1/3 cup of sugar.  Finally, it cooked for exactly 22 minutes in my metal pan.  Update: Instead of adding more sugar, eating the cornbread with honey makes this absolutely wonderful!

I printed this recipe two years ago and it remains one of the most used recipes in my home.  It was so unreadable today that I had to find it online again and decided to finally rate it.  I make huge batches of this, bake it in muffin pans, freeze the muffins, and take out however much I need that day for soup.  I usually add some creamed corn for texture but it isn't necessary.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe.

This recipe is delicious!!! I added a little more cornmeal and a little less flour. I also added about 1/4 cup of cream cheese and 1 can of cream corn. With or without those ingredients this recipe is perfect!!! I am definitely saving this one for the future.

Best Cornbread I've ever made.  I cut the sugar in half and added a couple generous squirts of honey and also took a reviewer's tip and added slightly less cornmeal/less flour.    It's a keeper recipe, thank you!

Beat the sugar and butter, added the eggs and milk to the same bowl, beat again then added the dry ingredients and stirred.  There were some small lumps in the batter but if I hurt the recipe you sure couldn't tell and I dirtied only one bowl. This is a great recipe! Will definitely make again and goes great w/hoppin' john. Found out the second time I made it a whisk is much better than an electric hand mixer, no lumps at all w/a whisk. Will be making this often!

I followed the directions perfectly - then at the end added a generous squirt of honey.  Once the corn bread was out of the oven I spread honey over the top.  Everyone at Christmas loved it!

Made this tonight to go with our chili.  I added about 1/3 cup of honey to the sugar/butter mix.  We like our cornbread sweet.  Everything else I did the same and it came out great.  Will make again.

It's ridiculous how good this is.  I changed the proportions to half corn meal and half buckwheat flour, substituted the eggs for a mixture of ground flax and water and used almond milk.  Next time I'll probably cut the sugar to 3/4 of a cup.  I like the cornbread a tad sweet but this is still sooooooo amazing!!!!

The PERFECT corn bread recipe.  The Only thing I did was squeeze maybe a tablespoon of honey into the batter.  Once it was cooked I poked holes in the top and spread butter and honey across it!  Passed the recipe onto one of my guests  A true hit!

I've been making this cornbread recipe for years and it has always been a hit!  This time I chopped up one fresh jalapeno pepper and added about a cup of shredded cheddar cheese.  Yum! Goes great with soups and stews.

Mmmm mmmnn yummy.  I normally don't eat cornbread but this I really enjoy.  It is lighter than normal and sweeter but that is how I like it.

Made this today. It's really good. Sweet so you don't need to add anything to it. I wouldn't change a thing. I've been looking for a good cornbread recipe for years so thank you for this recipe.

Oh my. Heaven. This was so ridiculously good! I turned it into a vegan version by using non-dairy margarine, substituting plain soy milk for the milk, and using energ egg replacer for the eggs. But I'm telling you, I don't think anyone would have guessed that they were vegan. Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

This was my first time making corn bread and it turned out EXCELLENT!!! I did make a few minor changes:instead of milk I used water due to milk allergies, and I used a little less than 2 cups flour, about 1 1/2 cups cornmeal and about 1 1/3 cups sugar. It baked for only 20 min and turned out moist, soft, and just overall PERFECT!!! I will definately be making this again:)

This is a great corn bread recipe!!  I followed the instructions as given here. Everyone in my family loved it!  Even my VERY picky 16 year old.  I think it needs a little more corn taste. Next time I will use a little less flour and a little more corn meal.  Just to make it a little more corny.

I rarely give 5 stars...and was quite skeptical about this recipe.  First - it seemed like too much flour to cornmeal ratio...but I followed those directions anyway.  The only change was to reduce the sugar to 1/2 C.,however, added 1/2 C. apple jelly -wanted the sweetness AND the added moisture.  AWESOME! Also sliced some jalapenos on top - PERFECT!

This is a wonderful cornbread recipt that I make into muffins. For myself, they were on the sweeter side so I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and they were still really sweet. I would probably cut it further to 1/2 cup next time (I used organic cane sugar to make it more healthier). I also used whole wheat flour to get more fibre. Trying the original recipe, I used the amount of cornmeal suggested and I thought it needed more. I added a half cup extra the second time but I think doubling the cornmeal would be even better.  This recipe, I believe makes a wonderful base recipe for any kind of muffins or cakes. Just substitute the cornmeal for flour or bran or whatever. This recipes is very flexible. Don't cut out the sugar if you want to make sweet muffins though or cupcakes.   Also, if anybody is worried about their cornbread being dense or wanting to convert this recipe into a cupcake or other kind of muffin, just give the butter a good 5 minutes of whipping using the stand mixer. This makes it light and fluffy tasting. I really loved this recipe and look forward to testing it out in making other cake like recipes.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Umm... exactly the recipe i was looking for!  It is moist and melts in your mouth.   I followed the recipe exactly- but i put the batter in my 10 inch cast iron skillet to bake.  After 25 minutes i lowered the temperature to 360 and baked for another 10 minutes.  Maybe it would cook quicker in a 9x13... i don't know.  But i love cornbread in an iron skillet.

This recipe was terrific!!!!  The only thing I changed was I added 2 tablespoons of honey.  My family has tried every pre-packaged cornbread out there and I have just recently begun dabbling with homemade recipes.  My whole family voted unanimously...this one is a keeper!!!

This was my first time making cornbread, and it turned out great! My husband normally hates cornbread, but he went back for seconds with this recipe.  He said it was more moist than most cornbread, and I agree.  We had no leftovers! My only changes were to reduce the servings to 8 and bake in an 8 X 8 pan (note: the middle was kind of doughy after 27 minutes, probably need more time with this size pan) and to add a little honey to the batter.  So good served with the chili recipe from this site called My Chili.  Thanks-- will make it again and again! UPDATE: Made it again (less than a week later because it's that good!) and cooked it at 375 for 20 minutes, then bumped the temperature up to 400 and baked it for another 12 minutes.  It cooked all the way through the middle this time.

This was a really great recipe. It is very sweet and I do agree with the others it has a bit to much flour in it. I just added more corn meal instead of flour.

I made this twice, once as written, once following other reviews and once subbing 1/3 cup of flour with 1/3 cup more of cornmeal.  I definitely liked it better the second time.  The second time I also made mini muffins instead of the sheet, it made 48 mini muffins and I used the leftover batter after that to make 7 regular muffins.  I used goat milk both times because that's what we drink lately.  Great recipe- brought it to a barbecue where it was the only thing completely devoured because people kept coming for 2nds, 3rds, and 8ths.

Yummy!  I've made this recipe a few times now and each time it comes out wonderful.  The first time I made it, I doubled the recipe and took it to a dinner at my friend's house.  I got rave reviews!  I was told a few times that one of the things people liked about it was that it's not as gritty as the recipe from the back of the cornmeal box.  This is a really delicious recipe, thanks for sharing!

Excellent!  I made half a recipe (6 servings)  and filled greased muffin cups 3/4 or so full and it made 9 muffins.  I baked them for about 17 minutes.  They were light, tender, and had just the right amount of sweetness.  Thanks Nicole!

I made this last night and when it came out of the oven the slices wouldn't stay together.   Each piece would just crumble. Now, this morning is a whole different story. It's staying together and tastes delicious.  The crumbling may have something to do with they way I mixed the recipe.  I just put it all in together and didn't mix alternately... I don't really know. Anyway, it's declicious today and I'll make again w/ the proper directions and see how it goes.

My kids love this cornbread.  But next time, I will try only 1/2 cup for just 1 stick of butter, 3/4 cup of sugar, 2 cups of flour and 1 1/3 of cornmeal.  Also I had to bake longer, 35 minutes.

I have never made a successful cornbread until now.  This recipe made me look like an expert.  I baked it in a cast iron pan (preheated with the oven, pour the batter into the hot pan) and it turned out absolutely perfect.  It got rave reviews, and I will definitely make it again.

Good recipe.  I only used 2 cups flour and added 1/3 cup cornmeal.  The dough will seem like a pretty flat layer in the pan, but it rises a lot.

I have made this twice. Once for a group of Boy Scouts who gobbled up the 2 pans I made and once a few days ago when I made chili. This bread is really delicious and easy to make.  I like how I usually have all the ingrediants on hand.

The best cornbread recipe yet. After reading some of the reviews I changed it a little: 1c cornmeal, 1c white flour, 1c wheat flour. Crispy on the outside, moist on the inside.  Family loved it.

I made this last night and must say it is one of the few cornbread recipes that I actually enjoyed. It was moist and sweet. I served it with fried catfish.  I've already rated this recipe but I would like to add a footnote. I sliced some of the left over corn bread and used it to make french toast. It was great.

Finally a cornbread recipe we adored! I guess I was picking more cornmeal recipes before, and this time I purposely found one with more flour. I made it exactly as listed and my family loved it. Will become my staple recipe.

I never liked cornbread growing up.  Always dry, grainy and had no taste.  I absolutely loved this recipe!  It didn't have a big grainy taste as most do and it is very moist, which surprised me.  The sugar is a huge plus as it gave it a sweet taste.  Thanks for making me like cornbread!

I made this recipe many times over the long mountain winter.  It was a meal in itself.  I make it as corn muffins since that's easier to serve to kids.  Bake at 400 for 15-17 minutes and use baking cups.  Sometime I think I'll try adding creamed corn just for variety.

This is an awesome recipe.  It was the first one I got from this website, and it's totally popular among others.  I have exchanged the sugar for splenda in the past (for my friends with diabetes), and it still tastes great.  You will love this.

The best cornbread I've ever had! I've found that 1/2 cup butter is plenty. Also, I just mix the wet ingredients and then add the dry instead of doing all the alternate mixing. Turns out just great for me! My husband and I like this so much because it's not dry like so many other cornbread recipes. Everyone we have made this for has asked me for the recipe.

This corn bread is the best I have ever had.  The kids ask for it regularly and ask me to make extra so they can eat it for breakfast.  I like it with a little honey drizzled over it.

This is an amazing recipe. I normally don't even try cornbread, I don't like the gritty teextures of those I've tried, however...this is amazing!!! I made a whole 13 x 9 inch pan full, between 4 people we nearly ate the whole pan. had it with chicken chili. Thanks for sharing, I'll always use this recipe!!

This recipe results in the best corn bread/muffin 's I have ever tasted.  They were moist and delicious.  I followed the directions to a tee, and opted to make muffins as opposed to baking them in a 8x8 dish (or whatever the recipe called for.)  I haven't made the sauce as others mentioned, but butter sufficed for us.  Even great heated up in the microwave the next day for a quick snack.  I'm sure these freeze well.

I didn't really care for this one.  The funny thing is, I made it because I saw reviews about how people liked the fact that it was cakey and sweet.  I have a huge sweet tooth and love cakes, so I thought it would be perfect for me.  Unfortunately, it barely had any corn flavor at all, and the flour made it incredibly dense and heavy.  I was not a fan.  It didn't taste like cornbread at all, to be honest.  

If you want to make  a great cake-like cornbread, I recommend mixing 1/3 yellow cake mix with 2/3 cornbread mix.  The cake flour keeps it light, while the cornmeal helps retain that corn flavor.

This is the best cornbread I have EVER tasted. I made it for my company potluck and now people are asking for me to bring some more in. Thank you for sharing this with us. I have tried other recipes and none of them come even close to the taste of this one. My taste buds asked for an encore!!!

This cornbread was moist and delicious.  It had more of a cake texture than a "cornbread" texture.  I did not mix the wet and dry ingredients separately and that might have changed the texture somewhat.  I just threw all the ingredients into the bowl of my stand mixture, mixed up the batter, and then poured into a 12" cast iron skillet.  This will be my "go to" cornbread recipe from now on.

Delicious!  I used half brown and half white sugar, 1 1/3 c. cornbread and 2 cups flour.  Big ole' squirt of honey and it was the best.

Absolutely delicious!!  Usually corn bread is a little dry for me, but this was wonderfully moist and buttery.  Made it for Thanksgiving and it went so fast I'm making another pan today for leftovers.

I wanted to try this before Thanksgiving so I made a sample batch. This recipe is to die for...best cornbread I have ever tasted. Wouldn't change a thing. Thanks so much for sharing. By the way, the "sample" batch was devoured overnight by the two men in my family:)

This is the best cornbread ever.  I mixed it up by hand and it turned out just like cake, not crumbly at all.  I have replaced my old recipe with this one.

This is - hands down - an OMG! recipe.  I've been sampling recipes on this site for quite some time now, but have not found a recipe that I could truly rate five stars.  I have to make cornbread for my daughter's second grade class for TG and decided to try this one, given all the high marks.  To make sure it "passed the grade," I made a batch beforehand and let my daughter and 5 yr. old son decide.  The verdict:  I am now "'The Best' cornbread maker in all the land1"  This is perfect -- not dry at all and has the right amount of sweetness that you can't even tell it's sweet (if you don't like sweet cornbread).  The corn flavor came through so there's no need to sub more cornmeal instead of flour as some have suggested.  Thanks!

The flavor of this bread was fantastic.  However, mine was extremely crumbly.  I followed the recipe as written, but am not sure what I did.  I used a mixer, so maybe I mixed it too long or over cooked it.  If anyone has any suggestions I would appreciate them.  I would love to make this again without it falling apart.

This is a great corn bread recipe.  I made the recipe as written and it was wonderful.  If I changed anything I would add a little less sugar next time only because it practically tasted like cake (not that I'm complaining).

This was the best corn bread I have ever made.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I scaled it down to 6 servings though because there is only my husband and me but I think I will make the full recipe next time and put the extra pieces in the freezer to have with our soup at lunch time.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I just got this bread out of the oven and I had to try a piece, and this turned into 2 pieces before I even served dinner! What a recipe!  I did not change anything at all, and my hubby could not even talk when he had the first bite - he just closed his eyes and said "hummmmmm!" Thank you for the recipe! I checked for corn bread mixture at the market, and I realized that home made is so much better and so much cheaper. All I had to buy was some corn meal which cost me less than a dollar, and the rest of the ingredients are what anyone always has in the pantry. This will go great with the chili I made from the AR recipes. First time making this corn bread and this is a keeper!

I made this with Chili for a family gathering!  Everyone loved it.  I added a can of corn and a can of chili's to the DOUBLED recipe!  It was great.  I also used splenda rather than sugar (and no one knew except me and my diabetic mother)

Excellent!!  Moist and only slightly sweet.  Everyone loved it.  Put leftovers under the broiler for a few minutes the next morning, kind of toasted it, spread some butter on it and it was yummy.

My family loved the cornbread.  Its buttery taste and cake like texture was just what I was looking for.  I highly recommend it.

This was really good, however next time I will do as others suggested and use a little less flour and a little more corn meal.

Very good! Didn't change anything and it was really exceptional. Maybe next time I will add some cream corn or some minced peppers for a different flavor and see how that goes.

This is the best corn bread I have ever made!!! The whole family enjoyed it and it was a snap to make. I did as others had suggested and used 1 and a half cups of sugar because we like our corn bread on the sweet side. Thanks so much for the recipe.

My first time making corn bread from scratch and it was sooo good !
buttery and moist.
The only thing is I doubled the recipe for my family of 7. Next time, instead of baking in one 13x9 pan, I will seperate into two pans because the center was not done when the sides were.
It was delicious though !

For fans of Yankee-style sweet corn bread, this is a great recipe.  We enjoyed it with our chili with plenty left over for Johny cake (warmed with butter and syrup)for breakfast the next morning.  By the way, it tastes great with 1/2 whole wheat flour, too.

Excellent recipe - I used 3/4 cup of sugar, though, and that worked better for my tastebuds.  Will definitely make this cornbread again.  Was great as a leftover bowl of cornbread & milk, too!

This cornbread was very good. I made several batches for a red bean soup feed we were having. I changed the second batch by adding buttermilk instead of the milk and using 2 cups of regular flour and 1/3 cup of Masa Harna flour. I also added cranberries to part of the batch and used chopped thawed corn in the other. It made them have a better corn flavor.

This was just perfect!  I had been craving this particular type of corn bread and tried other recipes to try to make just the right combination and they were only okay, but not quite what I really wanted.  And tonight I made this recipe and it is sooo YUMMY!  This was just what I had been craving. Sweet, buttery and holds together nicely too (not too crumbly).  The whole family loved it too!  So this is a keeper. Thank you!

Been using this recipe for years. I like my cornbread sweet and cakey which is just how this turns out. Be sure to bring eggs, butter, and milk to room temperature as they mix better. I prefer buttermilk or whole milk for this recipe. The guilty mom in me reduces the sugar to 2/3 cup

Really delicious cornbread, used coconut oil in place of the butter and put in a cup of frozen corn kernels, yum! I'll maybe try cutting back the sugar to 3/4 cup only because I felt so guilty .... nah, lol.

I made this today (many times as per recipe before) by substituting 1 c. of the flour for almond flour. I also increased the baking powder to 2 T.
It tastes amazing! The texture is also really nice - nice rise, nice graininess, just nice. The top got a little more brown than i would choose for regular cornbread, but it's soooo good. Next time I'll try to swap over even more of the flour for almond flour.

I did make a few adjustments based on the comments, and it came out AMAZING. I hate using box mixes, except Jiffy corn bread because I have never found a from scratch recipe that tastes as good, well...this one was BETTER. The adjustments I made are below (I increased the butter, took out 1/2 cup sugar, added 1/2 cup honey, and swapped a little flour for more cornmeal):

13 Tablespoons Butter, softened
1/2 cup Granulated Sugar
1/2 cup Honey
3 eggs 
1 2/3 cups milk 
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/3 cups cornmeal 
4 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 
1 teaspoon salt

Followed same mixing instructions, came out exquisite. Went great over the Chili I made. High recommend!

Scrumptious! Just made this and had to comment. My partner, a Jiffy mix lover since birth, just proclaimed this superior. I think more people would make cornbread from scratch if they knew how easy it was. I've been making another sweet cornbread recipe from A|R and this one is neck and neck. I will make this one a few more times, before trying that one again, to see which I prefer. One thing I like to do is to put a 10 x 10 cast iron skillet in the oven while it is preheating, and when it's time to pour the batter in, the hot skillet gives the crust a little extra crunch from the head start. Yum! I used a scant 1 cup of sugar as I was afraid it would be too sweet. Personal preference. I was careful not to over-beat...a "mistake" some folks make when mixing batter for cornbread. Over-beating causes a heavy, dense cake. Mix just until ingredients are incorporated...lumps are okay. Mine did have a slight metallic taste, but won't dock the recipe for that as it has to be one of my ingredients. I used King Arthur AP flour, Bobs Red Mill Corn Meal, Plugra unsalted butter (since recipe had salt) and Calumet baking powder. I'm thinking the Calumet is the cause for the metallic taste as it has sodium aluminum sulfate. I believe Bob's Red Mill Baking Powder doesn't have it (most do), so I will seek that out. Trust me! This is a winner!

Had this tonight with the Beef Stew VI.  Both were delicious but particularly this corn bread.  As others have said, you don't need butter on it nor do you need honey.  When my husband cut the corn bread, he was amazed at how light it was.  Don't be deceived by that comment as the corn bread is substantial.  I cooked it in my large black iron skillet which I put in the oven while I was mixing  up the batter.  I put just enough oil in the bottom to cover it when wiped with a paper towel.  A little more would probably make it crisper on the bottom.  This is a keeper recipe.

I love the texture and the flavour of this corn bread. I like the recipe as it is written but I usually use masa now instead of AP flour or I'll mix the 2 50/50. Either way you make it you'll likely enjoy it as I do.

I don't think I'm going to try another corn bread recipe.  This comes out super moist and delicious every time.  I always use butter.  Sometimes I'll add a half cup or so of corn kernels and I always put half a cup less sugar because I don't like it too sweet.  It goes better with chili that way.

This was good but I would've liked a little more corn taste.  I saw a review where flour/cornmeal ratio was changed up.  Might try this again doing that and maybe substitute some buttermilk for some milk.

Followed the recipe exactly as written and we all loved it.  Actually, that's an understatement.  We ended up standing around the counter eating it straight from the pan. We did use forks... some of the time.  Don't judge me until you've tried this. It lives up to the hype.  Moist, sweet and oh-so-buttery!

I don't get it. I've tried this one in 3 different ovens, so I guess I'm the common thread. But I keep getting a ring around the oblong pan and it's so dry, no matter how much I cut the cooking time

Excellent cornbread!  Delicious and great texture. I used to make a different recipe on this site but found that leftovers got quite sticky, which is not a problem with this one.  This recipe can also be cut in half and made in a 9x9 pan.

Love it and so has everyone that I've made it for. I cut back on the sugar and added honey....great idea. I also found that using butter instead of margarine made it taste even better.

Leave it to me to buck the trend.  Let me first say, that this is a very good cornbread.  The reason I'm giving it three stars is that it is more like a corn-cake than a corn-bread.  Very sweet, light and fluffy--it's more like a dessert than a side dish for beans, if you get my meaning.  So based on your personal preferences, if you like a cakey, sweet, light cornbread, this is for you.  Myself, I like a denser, more corn-y, heavier "bread" type of cornbread.  I can't really fault it because it's very good (excellent, in fact) for what it is, just not what I prefer.

This corn bread is so simple to make and absolutely amazing. I halved the sugar since I prefer mine less sweet and added 1-2 teaspoons of cinnamon and grated nutmeg to give it a homey spice. The flavor is INCREDIBLE! Definitely recommend it.

This is delicious!!  I think next time I will try to switch the flour and cornmeal portions and maybe decrease the sugar a little.  I made it to go with "Debdoozie's Blue Ribbon Chili" from this site.  A husband-pleasing meal!

Loved this recipe! To save time, I just threw all of the ingredients together (rather than following the exact directions), and they tasted great. Next time I will try following the exact directions, and see if it makes a difference.

Some of the best cornbread I have had in a while! It had the perfect amount of sweetness!! I didn't actually make it myself but a friend brought it over for our chili dinner and I made him tell me where he found this recipe!! He added a perfect ingredient to the recipe....mexican corn....sooo good!! I will definitely be making this many times in the future!

Yuuuummy! I followed the recipe exactly except I added 1tbsp honey. I felt it was a tad sweet for my taste so next time I'll use 3/4 cup of sugar with the honey. Otherwise a very delicious and moist bread!

I was signed up to bring corn bread for a potluck at work. I am not much of a baker but my co-workers insisted I could make it from scratch. I decided to try this one based on the reviews. It was a huge hit. Super easy to make and tasted great. My co-workers loved it and I even caught one of them sneaking all of the left overs home! She said it was so good she couldn't resist :)

This is seriously the best corn bread recipe ever. You don't even need to butter it after it's baked. It is so light and fluffy and does not fall apart. It's really hard to find good recipes for corn bread, and this one is a keeper. I followed the directions exactly, I wouldn't change a thing!

This turned out more like corn flavored cake than cornbread.  I think next time I will reduce the flour and up the cornmeal...maybe reduce the baking powder as well.  I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed :(

This corn bread is fairly good, but I found it to be a bit grainy for my taste. I think I'd rather it had some cream corn in it to mix it up a bit.

I served chili tonight and what goes better with chili than corn bread? But, I was hesitant to try yet another corn bread recipe as my children aren't big fans. So with the five star review I thought I couldn't go wrong. I was right- this was excellent! Even my six-teen year old leaned over and commented on how good these were. They were moist and light. A little sweet for me but that didn't keep me from having seconds. Thanks Nicole for a great recipe.

Fabulous!  Easy, tasted awesome! First I've ever made corn bread, and it was so, so good, even my daughter (who never eats anything) was eating it!
I used 2 & 1/3 c of corn flour and 1 c of flour-- no cornmeal and it was perfect.

Hands down, best corn bread I have ever had! Easy enough to make too.  Unfortunately my oven seems to be kind of bad, so I had to cover it after I went the full 27 minutes.  It was a lovely brown on top but still unbaked in the middle.  So I covered it and baked for another 15 minutes. Turned out great! The whole family loves this corn bread :)

I just made this, and it was also my first time making corn bread, ever. I fed it to about 7 20-something boys who are all currently screaming at the Bears game on television -- and they all took time out to swoon about the bread. :o) Thank you AllRecipes!

I made this cornbread tonight along with chili beans from scratch.  WOW...what a treat!  This recipe is so easy to make and it does not stick to pan. So moist you can eat it right out of oven w/o butter. My hubby and son loved it. I will keep this as my corn bread recipe from now on.

It was very light and fluffy, and I love sweet cornbread.  I think I could add more cornmeal and it wouldn't harm the recipe.  Highly recommended!  This is a perfect size for my 14-inch cast iron frying pan.

This is AMAZING!  I added some vanilla extract to the egg and milk mixture and even though I used wheat and gluten free flour - it was delicious!  Really really lovely!!

This was exactly the recipe I was looking for.  I tried others on the site but this is sweet and cake-like.  Great for breakfast alone or give a nice sweetness to a savory meal.

I scaled down to 9 servings, and used a slightly smaller pan. Definately needed more towards 27-29 minutes. Also, added 2 Tblspns of diced jalepenos and 1/2 cup corn. Tasty good

Tried this today, and we are blown away with how good this tastes.  Family was tired of "old recipe" that was somewhat dry.  This recipe turned out perfect, and so moist and delicious no additional butter or syrup needed.  If there are any leftovers (I hope so) I will serve it for breakfast, YUM!

Very good!!! 
I made a lit'l change since I had 1 cup left over buttermilk & some flexeed milk.  So I mixed those 2 milk to 1 2/3 milk.  I didn't know if that change altered the timing.  Instead of 27 min., my total time was about 55 min.  W/ crusty exterior, moist & fluffy interior, it's more like cake than an ordinary corn bread.

GREAT recipe! not at all too grainy like others I've tried. I opted to substitute sugar for splenda, and exchanged 1 cup of regular flour for one cup of coconut flour, upping the fiber, and reducing the sugars and carbs a bit. The coconut also really complimented the buttery taste (your family probably wont be able to put their finger on what that rich unknown flavor is!) and gave the cornbread a nice weight.

First I cooked it following the directions and it was great.  The second time, I used two cups of cornmeal and one cup of all purpose flour and sprinkled lemon zest.  It was AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!...... The result was just like on the photo. Everyone loved it.  Thanks for posting it.

I tried this recipe to see how it varies from the other recipe I've obtained from here (Grandmother's Best Cornbread) and have been using for a long time. This actually uses more butter and flour. Its not as moist but the taste and texture is almost the same. I would have used buttermilk instead of plain milk but since I didn't have any handy, I added 1 tbsp. apple cider vinegar and let it sit for 10 mins. before adding the eggs. I also adjusted the oven temp. to 350 as I found that the sides quickly browned, leaving the middle quite soggy. All in all this is a keeper!

I thought I completely messed up with this bread, I have never made cornbread before but my mom did often and always made it quite shallow and cut into squares. Mine occupied a large casserole dish and puffed up to twice the height I'm used to. I had to wait until the top was quite brown before I could take it out, I thought it would be too dried out but, viola! Delicious cornbread! Will make it more shallow next time though. Great recipe! Thanks!

I'm not a big corn bread eater, but lately I've been craving it. For corn bread, this is pretty good. Not as corn-y as it usually is. I made them in muffin form (made 16) and they remind me of the corn bread muffins at Famous Dave's BBQ Restaurant.

I made this this past weekend for a dinner party as a side to the slow cooker jambalaya recipe also on this site, and got RAVE reviews from everyone.  It was super easy and was the best cornbread I have ever tasted.  This one is a keeper!

Took the advice of some other reviews and cut the sugar in half, reduced flour to 2 cups and increased corn meal to 1 1/3 cups.  Husband loved it.

All I heard was "Is this a mix?" The best compliment ever. Bravo on the recipe. I made 2 batches for 2 different dinners. I used 2%milk and topped with melted butter just before serving. Moist, buttery, Simply wonderful. The best I have ever made! Thanks for sharing.

This was so easy, and great! I baked mine in a cast iron skillet. It was perfect, and had a great crust. Also, I was generous with the honey-and that made it perfect.

This was amazing! The only thing is I think i needed a little more butter becuase it was staring to crumble, but still good. I also added some honey, which added to it. All together really good

i loved this corn bread... it came out so soft and moist and oh my gosh buttery... usually i like to put some butter on my corn bread, but with this recipe, there really was no need to!  my only problem with it is that the recipe made too much, so next year i will try to half the recipe and then it should be perfect!

It was very good.  I used self rising flour and 1 teaspoon of baking powder.  Next time I will use a tad less sugar.  I like my corn bread sweet, but this was just a little too sweet for me.

Cooked it in a cast iron pan and served it with a smoked brisket to a bunch of 20 year olds and it was the first thing we ran out of.  Everyone losed it.  Just make sure you use a fine corn flour it is not as nice with a course corn meal.

The flavor was excellent ! I added a dab of honey to the batter, it had a buttery sweet flavor ! The texture came out crumbly though, hard to put butter on and then eat..was GREAT in the chili though!

For anyone interested, I followed the recipe except used dairy free egg free substitutions (soy milk, soy margarine, egg replacer) and it was delicious. I'm always looking for recipes I can make with those modifications (kids with allergies) and this is definitely one of them. We all loved it as is but next time I might try more corn meal as others have suggested.

Excellent recipe!! It was light and fluffy yet held together really well. My husband is not a big fan of corn bread and he loved this! Thanks so much for sharing!

I really like this recipe.  I used brown sugar instead of white sugar.  Nice and crunchy on the outside, and moist on the inside.  It wasn't crumbly and held up well for a quick dip into soup.  Next time I might play with the amount of corn meal just to have a stronger corn meal flavour.

This recipe was amazing!! I have been making cornbread using the recipe on the package for years.  When I noticed my husband slowing stopped eating it I went searching for another one.  Something a little more sweet.  This recipe was a big hit! Not too sweet at all to me and I followed the exact recipe, didn't take away or add anything.  Thanks!

I have to agree with the others that say this is much more like cake than cornbread. It lacks a real corn flavor, due to the cornmeal/flour ratio, and it tastes more like a buttery cake that needs "something"... when I make it again, I will definitely increase the cornmeal and reduce the flour.

WAY too sweet and I agree that it should've had more cornmeal and less flour. Otherwise a good corn bread from scratch.

I made this essay last night and I found it to be the sweet and moist corn bread that I was looking for.  I made a few changes to the recipe.  I used 1/2 cup of regular flour and 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour, I used vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream, and I baked the mix as 12 muffins for about 20 minutes.

Love this cornbread recipe...My kids squeal when they see it come out of the oven...I added a 1/3 cup more cornmeal and 1/3 cup less flour...Also I added a bit of honey to the finished batter...I split my recipe in half and freeze half, since I have a small family, and bake it in a bread pan at 400 for 22 min...doesn't need any butter or honey just eat it...

Great recipe! The first time I made it, I never heard the end of  mmmm. I do however add more corn meal than flour. 2 cups corn meal and 1 1/3 flour and for my taste a little bit more sugar (but not much more). I have made this several times and it always comes out the same. Thanks for posting the recipe!

This is a very tasty recipe and lives up to the reviews describing it as fluffy, but we felt that it was so sweet and included so little corn meal that it was more like a cake or dessert, not your traditional corn bread. I would cut the sugar by half!

This is a good recipe for cakelike cornbread (please note that the ratio of flour:cornmeal differs in this recipe from other recipes) but there isn't much character other than sweet and buttery. We seem to prefer cornbreads with more cornmeal than flour, but that doesn't make this a bad recipe. It's quite tasty, thanks for sharing!

The corn bread was delicious! Very moist - although I did use the cornbread on a casserole (Allrecipes Barbeque Beef Casserole) so the liquids from the casserole may have caused it to be extra moist. Regardless, my husband wouldn't stop saying how good it was!

This cornbread was fabulous. It reminded me more of cake than corn bread. Loved it. It required more cooking time, like 30 -30 minutes.

This simple cornbread is excellent. I added a few teaspoons of maple sugar to sweeten it up. Also, the cooking time was closer to 35 minutes for me - it is very moist, thin batter, closer to cake batter than bread mix - but it cooks evenly and stayed moist inside and crisper outside.

I followed instructions and it came out just fine. Tasted pretty much like the recipe on my box of corn meal though, so nothing too exciting about this recipe.

This was amazing. I even cut the sugar by 1/3, used rice milk, and Smart Balance and it is STILL my favorite cornbread!

very good cornbread!!!! easy to make and had just the right amount of sweetness. The only reason i gave it four stars is because it took me a bit longer to bake then the 22-27 min the recipe called for. As a result, the bread was a little dry. Other than that, it was a great recipe:) will be making it again.

The taste was great, but after only 18 minutes this was pretty well done, and because of that it was a little crumbly. It probably only needed 15 minutes or less in my oven. Will definitely make this again, and next time I'll make sure to check it sooner.

I made this recipe for a tailgate. We were in the parking lot by 10am so corn bread was perfect to munch on. Also when I was prepping, I realized I didn't have cornmeal but I had a high quality polenta. Not sure how much of a difference it makes since they generally all the same thing. But it was delicious!!

Um, yeah, the best corn bread I've ever had.  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.  I made it exactly as directed and it was amazing.  So moist and flavorful.  Not the least bit dry like alot of corn breads.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Very moist, very tasty. I might try adding half a can of creamed corn the next time I make this. Husband enjoyed it, and he's picky about cornbread. Thanks for the recipe.

I wasn't expecting much from this cornbread, but chose it because I had all the ingredients on hand.  I was very pleasantly surprised, as it turned out to be perfectly sweet and had a nice moist texture.  I did add a little extra cornmeal and a little less flour.  One of the best quick and easy cornbreads I think I've had.  Will put it in the recipe box to make again.

This is the best corn bread my husband and I have ever had. I had been making the Trader Joe's mix, which is pretty good but a tad too sweet for me. I decided to try making it from scratch so I could adjust the sweetness level. Well, I didn't need to with this recipe - it' just the perfect. Delicious!

I made this recipe for the first time on Thanksgiving and it was delicious but I had to cook it longer than it said because the middle took much longer to get done.  Once it was done, it came out very moist.

Served it at Thanksgiving tonight.  Huge hit!  It was delicious and moist.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and added a squirt of honey.  I might add a little more next time to enhance the flavor.  Will make it again within days!

I've tried one other recipe on this site for cornbread and it didn't go too well. I made this for the first time for a Thanksgiving dinner part and I got amazing results and feedback!!! Everyone loved it!  I took some other feedback and put in a healthy dose of honey. Subbed in Splenda brown sugar mix and Smart Balance butter. No one could tell that it was lower calorie. I also baked it in a cast iron muffin pan for 15 minutes to add some crispiness. The secret is warming up the oil in the pan before adding the batter to achieve a nice crispy crust.  Thanks for a great recipe! This one will be my "Go To" for cornbread

I never made cornbread from scratch before.  I grew up on Jiffy Cornbread and didn't know any different.  Made this today and...OH MY GOSH!!  It was easy to make and tastes so good.  I will make this again..no more Jiffy boxes for me!!

In a word Delish!  I decreased the flour to 2 cups and increased cornmeal to 1-1/3 cups.  I used a wheat flour and sea salt.  The whole family LOVED it....usually we don't eat sweet cornbread...but this one is not too sweet...perfect with my Mom's Chili Recipe!!!!  I will make it again and again...no more Corn Kits for me!!!!

This was fantastic cornbread!  I followed the recipe exactly (except I added a squirt of honey to the batter) and it tasted great.  Sweet and light.  Looks impressive too.  The bread rises up tall in the pan, turns golden brown on top, and has a perfect crust to give it a crunch.  My one and only complaint is that I like my cornbread "corny-er".  Next time I try this, I'll reduce the flour and add more cornmeal.  The bread is a bit sweet, but we love sweet cornbread, and I served this with a really spicy chili, so it created a nice balance.  I'll be making this again, and with just a minor adjustment, I think I've found the PERFECT cornbread recipe.  Thanks!

FINALLY!  I have found my keeper cornbread recipe!!  Just a hint of sweetness and no need for buttermilk.  I was able to substitute Earth Balance for butter and Rice milk so that my milk allergic son could enjoy the bread as well.

Just made this today. My very first attempt at making cornbread. Texture is good and it's yummy but i think it needs to be a bit more sweet. I am planning on making them for Thanksgiving and had to give it a try first. Next time i will try adding a little honey like others suggested. I don't eat much cornbread and when i do, i don't tend to put any butter or spreads on it so i prefer it to be a lil more sweet :) Hope my family like it for Thanksgiving.

I've never made cornbread from scratch and this was so easy and turned out perfect and moist.  I followed the recipe exctly.   Even my husband, who claims to not like cornbread, loved it and went back for seconds.  It went great with crock pot chili and made for one of the quickest, easiest weekday dinners!

I made this recipe using margarine and substituting real eggs with egg beaters and mike with soy milk. The results were wonderful! Cornbread came light and moist. My husband and I did not wait for it to cool off, we just dug right in!

I made this last night. Absolutely delicious! I made this to go along with red beans and rice. The cornbread was better than the main dish. Definitely will be making this again!!

Oh my gosh, seriously, this is the most delicious thing I've ever tasted.  I didn't change the recipe at all, and it's the perfect texture, the perfect sweetness, the perfect amount of corn flavor.  This is about to become a new staple in my diet!

Excellent!!! I made this to go with chili. I also made honey butter to go on top of the bread. (1/2 c butter & 1/3 c honey, whipped and served at room temp). This is the absolute best corn bread. As suggested by other reviewers, I mixed in a squirt (@1-2 TBSP) of honey in the finished batter. Excellent flavor and moist!!

Easy and fantastic every time - I make this recipe during the fall and winter and it turns out great every time.  I usually make it for company since the recipe yields a lot.  It is the tastiest, most moist cornbread ever.

I was looking up a recipe last year for cornbread and cam across this and another one. I went with this one because it looked easier and took less time than the other. I added some honey to the recipe and it was delicious! I made it again this year and it has been a big hit both times!

I realized why this recipe is so popular, but only after I made it. It's loaded with butter! I needed something quick so I just grabbed this recipe and made it. Since I've never made corn bread from scratch before, I didn't know it isn't supposed to have this much butter. Most of the other ones I've looked at since have 2 Tbsps to 1/4 cup of fat in them. I'm going to try another one next time.

This corn bread is delicious!  I've never made corn bread with butter before (only oil) and I must admit when I saw the finished batter I thought it wasn't going to work out right.  But it baked up so nicely...VERY tall, very moist, so buttery and sweet at the same time.  My only problem was it was very crumbly.  Which usually means dry, but this was still extremely moist.  Not quite sure why that happened, but the flavor is amazing.  I usually make a cornbread combining Jiffy cornbread and Jiffy yellow cake mix and it's so sweet and cake-like.  But my hubby and I like this one even better.  Now if I can just figure out how to keep it from crumbling...

Woah, this is delicious.  This is the best cornbread I've ever made, or ever had period!  It's crunchy on the sides and top, and moist in the middle.  And the flavor is beautiful, I usually slather corn bread with butter and honey but this recipe doesn't need it!  Easy, flawless recipe, thanks so much!

Absolutely wonderful. I made it the first time exactly as written, perfect. Second time I reduced the milk by 1/2 cup and added a can of cream style corn, also great. Thank you.

This recipe is fail proof.  I halve it for just my husband and I, and make the entire batch when we have company.  It's so easy and always ends up being the star of the meal!  I use a little less flour and make up the difference with flax seed (it makes me feel better about all the butter, ha).

Absolutely by far the BEST cornbread ever! Perfectly crumbly, delicious and moist. I did add a generous squirt of honey to the batter before baking and even my European husband who had never tried cornbread and was rather skeptical LOVED it! A new family favorite!

This cornbread is probably the best cornbread I have ever had!!!  I made a pot of pinto beans and since the cornbread that I always made (whatever is on the bag of cornmeal or cornmeal mix) was always so-so, I decided to try a new recipe.  Oh! It's is yummy! It's not a very Southern cornbread due to all the AP flour. My guy has said that he's going to inhale the pan. Next time I make it, I will definitely cut back on the sugar by 1/3-1/2 cup.

This cornbread is excellent. The only alteration I made was I used 1/3 cup butter and 1/3 cup applesauce to make it a little healthier. Still came out very moist and delicious. I may add corn or creamed corn next time, but I was very pleased with this recipe. Went great with the Easy Delicious Ribs recipe.

I had never had cornbread before but my boyfriend loves it so I decided to make this recipe. I thought it was delicious and he said that it was the best cornbread he's ever had! He told me that he's eaten many different cornbreads but this was hands down his favourite. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was extremely easy to make, and it came out very well. I find it a little dry, but maybe I overcooked it. I would definitely recommend this.

I never like corn bread because it is alwayss so dry. And i have never written a review here. But i have tried many recipes from this site. I had to come and write this review because this was the best corn bread i have made and ate. I didn't not add anything new and i didn't change the ingredients. Only thing i did different was cut down the butter in half. i used salted butter and didn't put any extra salt. because i thought the butter had enough salt in it. IT WASSSSSS YUUUUMMMMIIIIIIIIIII and moistttttttt (shocked). Thanks for sharing.

Awesome recipe.  I followed it as written and it yielded 9 muffins and one 10" loaf in a cast iron skillet.  No extra butter required at all.  It had the perfect amount of sweetness.  Into the family recipe book this goes.

Awesome cornbread! I don't always love cornbread, but this is one recipe that is delicious. It's not gritty, it's lightly sweet and has a rich buttery flavour. Yum!

YUM! YUM! YUM!  I have made this recipe 4 times already (once I made it twice in one week) and it is a HUGE hit!  It is super moist and tender.  This is the BEST cornbread recipe I have ever made.  A co-worker suggested adding a can of Creamed Corn to the mix and that made it have a nice texture.  But, if you don't care for 'chunks' in your bread...leave it out.  I will keep making this recipe!  Thanks for sharing!!!

This was good, but didn't taste like cornbread.  Tasted like corn cake not cornbread.  I did use white cornmeal instead of yellow.  It was all I had.  I think I will try a different recipe next time.

I used this recipe because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand for the corn bread recipe I always use. I thought this had a good flavor but it was a little drier than I'm used to. It was definitely better than the box corn bread mixes though.

I've been searching for the perfect cornbread and this one is it!  Even my husband, who doesn't like cornbread, liked it.  His grandfather (who is in his 80's) told me it was the best cornbread he had ever had and he is a country boy raised on it. I did make a bunch of changes, though, in order to make it healthier.  I used freshly ground whole wheat pastry flour instead of conventional white and I used about 2/3 cup sucanat (ground in the blender) instead of sugar.  It took about fifteen minutes longer to cook than stated in the recipe, but that could have been due to the changes made. It was moist and flavorful.  Yummy.  Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely delicious recipe! I had a friend make it years ago and always wondered how she did it. My son/step-sons couldn't get enough, they barely touched the rest of their dinner and kept asking for more cornbread!!! It was my first time and I was very pleased, but I had to lower my oven temp as I have a 'hot' oven, so it would cook more evenly. Thank you for the great recipe.  V

I thought this tasted pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly, using white cornmeal (what I had on hand already). I was expecting a little more buttery flavor and fluffiness but I didn't notice any difference. Perhaps I'm not a big cornbread fan but the family members I made it for thought it was pretty darn good!  So thanks for an easy and crowd-pleasing recipe!

SOOOO good!!! fluffy and moist unlike some other corn breads.  Not too sweet and has the perfect corn flavor.  Great with ribs or chili.  the only change i made was to use buttermilk instead of regular milk.  Fantastic!!!

I followed this recipe exactly and it was delicious. BUT... As another reviewer mentioned...it IS more like cake than the dense corn bread I was looking for, but very moist & still very yummy.  I will try making this next time but subbing out some flour for more corn meal.

This is the BEST corn bread i have ever tried!!! Moist and sweet but not too sweet. Only change i made was to add 1/4 cup more corn meal(for more texture)and the honey (about 1/4 cup)  others sujested. Husband loved it. Great with pulled Pork.

This was the first time I mixed butter into the batter before baking. It was so moist. I did make some changes. I omited the flour and sugar. The cornmeal flavor really comes through. Also, I used self-rising cornmeal(you don't need baking powder&salt because it's already in the meal). You know something is a hit when thereare no leftovers.

Wonderful!  A real hit at our last winter cookout and a great compliment to the chili we served.  Even our friends from the deep South raved about it! I made two batches and when making the second realized I had messed up on the first one, cutting the butter almost by half.  (It was a rather frantic day!) Still, they were both great.  I also cut back the sugar to 3/4 cup to suit our personal preference.

I would rename this recipe "Cornbread Cake." If you're looking for a light, sweet bread then this is for you but I prefer a heartier cornbread.

This was my very first time making corn bread and I dont believe this is the recipe I was looking for. Im not sure what its missing being that I have no other recipes to compare it to at the moment but its missing something that I've tasted in other cornbreads. Like others have said, I believe its pretty dry, not the greatest texture, and neither sweet nor buttery enough. I guess I like more cake like corn breads myself. It is really easy to make, as I made this off a whim at 1 in the morning because I was bored. Nevertheless, I will continue looking for another cornbread recipe.

I made this recipe the "Weight Watchers" way, and it was moist and delicious. I substituted 1/2 the butter for applesauce, used skim milk and half splenda and half sugar. If I had egg substitute on hand, I would have subbed that for the eggs to make it even healthier. No need to sacrifice taste.

Made the cornbread two days ago and it is still moist and delicious.  Next time I will make only 1/2 because it was a bit much for my family of 4.  But it is sweet and not bland at all.  Very, very good!

It tastes just like the corn bread they use to serve at this (now closed) restaurant in St.Louis, MO called Tippins. So glad I found this recipe. Yummy! No more store brand corn mix for us.

great taste, just like grandma's.  Followed recipe exactly.  One reservation, as one looking for "quick and good" prep for this took some time so probably won't use it frequently.  For less lazy "comfort" cooks, this is wonderful recipe.

REALLY YUMMY!
Instead of just milk, I mixed 2/3 cup of milk with 1 cup buttermilk. I'm not sure if it made a difference, but it might have, since this was sooo good!
Good to re-heat and serve later I found aswell :)

This is the first cormbread recipe that I made. I chose it becasue I had all of the ingredients in my home. It was delicious and very easy to make.  I made a double recipe which I won't do in the future since the ingredients are very heavy to mix.

I have been trying to duplicate an amazing cornbread that I ate in a vegetarian restaurant. This one did the trick. I substituted all of the butter for apple sauce, and added 1 cup of mixed red/green peppers, as well as one cup cheddar cheese. I also cut the sugar by half and probably next time will only put 1/3 cup. Although I'm no expert on cornbread (living in Montreal, Canada), this one was delicious! I served with black bean chili. yum.

I just used this recipe as the cornbread topping for Corn Bread Hamburger Pie and let me tell you, it was great! I would give it 5 stars except I didn't try making it as bread, yet - so after I do that I'll write another review - however, it had a great fluffy texture and delicious taste, just sweet enough. Fantastic recipe, really easy to make!

UPDATE: I brought this (as bread) to Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit! It's so fluffy and delicious! I cut it into rectangles rather than squares because it rose so high, a whole square would have been too much for one person! 5 stars for sure!

This is a great recipe, my first time making corn bread from scratch and I did a smaller serving and it still came out fabulous, my boyfriend loved it, better than anything out of a box. Loved it. Will definitely make it one of the side things I bring to my parents house for Thanksgiving this year.

This is the ultimate cornbread!  I halfed the recipe (I used 3 tiny banty eggs from our chicken coop) and added about 1/4 cup of sugar.  WONDERFUL!  My family ate every crumb!  This puts all boxed cornbread mixes to shame!

This was the first time I made corn bread very good with the buttery taste but next time I make this I'm going to add a bit more sugar. This recipe is very easy way to make corn bread from scratch.

Made this for Canadian Thanksgiving last night and it was a hit.  Very easy to make.  Followed the recipe to a T.  The only slight complaint was that it was a touch crumbly so it didn't come out of the pan as nicely for presentation as I would have liked.  I would not suggest adding anymore sugar to the recipe.  It was nice and sweet, but not overly sweet.  A perfect side of any meal.
