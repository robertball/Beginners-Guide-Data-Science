I marinated the pork for only 2 1/2 hours and otherwise followed the directions as written. We thought this was good but when it came to the leftovers there were no takers. We use that as a hallmark of a recipe. I love all the ingredients but for some reason they seemed like they'd do better with chicken tenders rather than pork tenderloin--and maybe they were just a little dry. I appreciate the recipe and would try it again with a little sauce over the top made with lemon juice and butter.

This was absolutely horrible...the crust tasted doughy and the pork chops had no flavor despite marinating for 4 hrs and they were dry. Good thing my husband eats anything. His advice to me was just to fry the chops next time.

Loved this recipe! I don t have cast iron skillet so for the broiler I lined broiler pan with aluminum foil and let it preheat while I was pan frying. Then I transferred pork to broiler pan and poured juices in too before adding topping. Yum!!
