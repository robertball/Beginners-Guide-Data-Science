So yummy!  Used this as an appetizer on Thanksgiving.  Even though my parents have told me that they don't like brie, they really enjoyed this.  Made as is without almonds (I don't like them).  I do recommend baking this in a dish that you will serve it with.  It's impossible to transfer it when it's done cooking.

I've been making Brie en Croute for years now and it tastes better every time. My favorite combination is walnut, brown sugar and craisins.  The slight tart flavor of the craisins work great with the sweetness of the brown sugar.  Thanks for the idea of using apricot jam.  Went with another reader's idea and served with sliced apples.  Delicious!

Awesome recipe!  I was a little skeptical of letting it cool for 1 hour, but it was still warm!  It was very buttery tasting.  I used pan-roasted slivered almonds instead of the sliced almonds for a slightly different crunch  (and it was what I had).  Very good for taking to a party.  Serve with dried french bread slices you can make in the oven ahead of time.

I've made this too many times to count in many different ways and my favorite is using apricot jam or preserves, Craisins (you don't need to soak them...use them as they are!) lightly toasted sliced almonds and away you go! Excellent every time and travels well too.

This is my favorite way to eat brie (so far)!  The sweet and slightly tangy flavors of the raspberry and cranberry are a perfect fit for the pungent flavor of the brie.  I was in a hurry to eat it and didn't wait the recommended hour, and that was a mistake since the melted cheese then leaked out.

For Christmas Eve I made this using the apricot preserves.  Absolutely delicious. I did not change a thing.  I used the highest quality of preserve I could find at my store. The brie size wasn't exact so I just adjusted the preserves and almonds. Everyone loved it. Was my first time baking brie en croute. It was simple and easy and looked like it was bought from an expensive bakery. Very impressive appetizer in taste and appearance!

This was one of many items at a party held at my open house.  It was so incredibly impressive - it looks beautiful on display and the taste is divine.  The nice thing is that brie invites many flavors so you can experiment.  This time we used orange juice soaked dried cranberries (thanks Annika) and walnuts.  I imagine a Caribbean chutney, or a fig/nut combo would also be quite lovely.  With frozen pastry, this really doesn't take much time or effort but the bang for the buck is outstanding!

I made this for my annual cookie exchange, and used my homemade peach jam instead of the apricot preserves.  It was SO yummy!  I couldn't stop eating it!

This appetizer was the hit of my party today.  I didn't think I liked brie but in this recipe it was incredible.  Alot of my friends are cheese fans and that is why I chose to make it.  They loved it and it was totally gone!  I got requests for the recipe and I will definitely make this again!

Awesome! I used dried cherries, cherry preserves and sliced almonds. I used an 8oz. wheel of brie. Doing some research on Brie en Croute, I toasted the almonds in a pan with 2 TBLS salted butter and a TBLS of dijon mustard. I sliced the brie in half and put the preserves, cherries and toasted almonds between the two halves and left a little out to place on top of the brie as well. Since I was using a smaller wheel of brie, I trimmed the edges of the puff pastry a bit before I folded it over the top, sealed the edges with egg wash and flipped it over into a glass pie pan to bake (I used the puff pastry trimmings to make a bow on top). I baked it for the full time and let it sit for 45 minutes before serving - it was still gooey and warm. There was about 1/3 left and I place it in a tupperware container in the fridge and reheated it three days later in the microwave at 50% power - still tasted great!

You don't have to flip the seams over. I forgot and it actually turned out really pretty once baked. It's an easy alternative to decorating. 
Also make sure you flour the surface before spreading the dough. Otherwise it will NOT come off the surface.

Very good. I make it every year. Except I get my puff pastry at Trader Joes. It's an all butter pastry and already to go in the squares. Alot cheaper too. I don't bother to re hydrate the cranberries. I just toss them in. I use apricot jam instead of raspberry. Be sure to let it cool for about 45 minutes before cutting. Seems long but if you cut it to soon all the cheese and filling just flows out.

I've made this twice, the 1st time I left the rind on. The 2nd time I didn't, but put the chopped rind on the top and bottom of the brie. I liked it better like that. So much of the flavor is in the rind, but it melts so much better without it. Tastes fantastic though!

to die for! I used "flakey, butter" crescent roll dough (in the tube) instead of puff pastry. Turned out awesome. I split my brie in half, and also split the dough in half (so I had 2 squares of dough (which I rolled out thinner), and 2 crescent shaped brie pieces), put marionberry preserves and craisins (straight out of the package, no softening) in, and unfortunately, I didn't have any sliced almonds, and it still turned out WONDERFUL! Thank you!

This was fabulous!  I made it exactly as stated, but substituted raisins for the cranberries as my husband can't eat cranberries.  Took it to a Thanksgiving dinner and everyone raved.  Have made it a few times since and it's always delicious!

Excellent-this was by far the favorite at my party.  Softening the cranberries in orange juice was really tasty and the flavors were perfect.  I used a 2 lb wheel of brie, 1 1/2 pkg of puff pastry and a full jar( 10oz) of apricot preserves.  Next time I will remove the top rind of cheese because I found the taste of the rind bitter and did not like the texture of the rind.

My family didn't really care for this. However, this was the first time they had tried Brie so it may just be that they don't like Brie rather than the recipe.

This is the best! So easy to make and absolutely delicious. I made two for my Holiday dinner and they BOTH got finished by five people! The rest of the guests didn't even get to try this delicious treat.     If I could give it 10 stars I would!

Excellent. I do not bestow 5 star ratings recklessly, and this deserved it for both ease of preparation and taste.  I used an 8 oz package of Brie which was plenty for four people.  3 T of seedless raspberry jam, 1/4 cup cranberries, and 3 T of untoasted chopped almonds.  I tried both the 8 oz package of crescent rolls and the third time I used a 10 oz package and found that the larger package worked better, since the biggest problem with this recipe is making sure the roll seams don't split and leak jam everywhere.  I found that the 10 oz package yielded a lot of crust, but when I wrapped it, I could cut off excess and "patch" the croute where necessary.  I needed a lot of patching.  I baked at 350F for twenty minutes and then let stand for only 15 min.  Any longer and it becomes lukewarm.  I had previously let it stand for 40 minutes, and it was cold.

I had never baked brie until this year.  I wanted something different for xmas day and decided on this the recipe.  I purchased two 8 oz rounds and used dried cranberries with walnuts on one and apricot pineapple chutney on the other.  I made these up the night before and kept them in the fridge to save time and baked an extra 10 minutes.  They were still warm when we arrived at the party (45 min away), but it wasn't quite gooey enough so simply zapped in micro til result was achieved.  Served with apple slices and crackers-BIG HIT!  My daughter is going to serve it at her NYE's party.  Excellent flavors and would highly encourage everyone to give it a try.

I made this for the first time last Thanksgiving and now my grandsons request it whenever  I visit. I changed it just a little. I slice the Brie in half horizontally and spread Orange Marmalade and the dried cranberries in the middle and put the wheel back together and spread more Marmalade on top and cover with the puff pastry and bake.

It was the hit of the party I took it to! I didn't use nuts because the host is allergic- but I used apricot jam and cranberries.  Problem is the puff pastry was too thin in places and the jam leaked out. Good to know for next time!  Oh, and I made two of them and bought everything- the total was $30- not exactly an inexpensive appetizer but very good. Thanks for this recipe.

Hard to go wrong with this one.  I can actually see people's faces light up when they come in my house and see that I've made it.  I've made it a lot. I use the apricot pineapple jelly but I imagine most would be good.  I've thought of trying a pepper jelly but I'm scared to ruin a good thing.  People truly go nuts over this stuff.

Easy and tastes great.  Make sure to allow the brie to cool for an hour or it is too runny and just leaks out of the pastry shell.  Also, made the mistake of rollng the pastry dough too thin the first time I made this and it did not puff and flake nice.

This recipe is great. My aunt made it as an appetizer for Christmas. Before I could blink twice, my family had ate all of it. Great for that "Girls evening in".

I love this recipe.  The fruit adds a special tartness and freshness to the brie.  It is really critical that you allow the rest time, or it will be all over your serving tray.

I have made this on several occasions with subtle variations and it's always a hit. I prefer to use an 8 oz Brie. I find the 13.2 oz is too much cheese. My latest alteration included Peach Apricot preserves and Pecans instead of almonds. I think that was my favorite. It's definitely one of those recipes where you can add your own touches and it will always taste good...really, really good!

Excellent! Brought this to a family party and it was gone within minutes. I used apricot jam and cranraisins. No need to soften them in water. So easy and transported well. Be sure to bake it in the dish you will be serving it in as it is hard to transfer once baked.

I made this recipe exactly as stated, and everyone at the holiday party raved about it!  I'll definitely make it again Christmas Day.  (oh, I did soak my cranberries in Cointreau instead of water, but I doubt that makes much of a difference.)

It was absolutely fantastic!! With the family here, it didn't last long. I did make a couple of changes, I used dried cherries instead of cranberries and left out the almonds. Next time I will double both the preserves and dried fruit.

I have made this multiple times for various occasions during the Holidays and it's always been a huge hit. I highly recommend apricot preserves, and cutting the outside off of the brie before baking. The first couple of times I made it, the pastry didn't come out looking very pretty, but taking more time to be careful to ensure it was sealed and cooled properly, it turned out beautifully moving forward.

Deliciously Fancy and deceptively simple. I made two of these, one with walnuts and one with slivered almonds; and I substituted cherries for cranberries which I soaked in orange juice. Both were delicious! Make sure you let the brie sit for 1 hour, this is the key to it staying beautiful. Now sampling from another brie recipe I add a few snips of sage to one of the brie's I baked which adds a lovely aromatic.

I only used an 8 ounce wheel of brie.  It was very good.  And oh so pretty with the cutouts on top and the egg wash.  It was devoured at the party I was at.

Fab recipe!  It was the first of all the appys to be finished and all the guests hadn't even arrived yet.  I don't think it lasted even 20 mins.  I used the apricot preserves so next time I'll try the raspberry jam....and I'll make 2 of them :)

Very very good. I used too much cheese though and it overpowered the other ingredients. So in this case more cheese is not better. I also used orange flavored cranberries.

This makes a lovely presentation and is delicious as well. I didn't have puff pastry on hand but did have Pillsbury Crescents, so used that instead. I have made this several times and almost any kind of jam or jelly works well as the topping also. The sweet with the salty cheese flavor makes a nice blend of flavors.

Fabulous!!  This was really popular at a holiday party we hosted.  I left out the almonds as my husband is allergic.  The cranberries and apricot preserves make such a great combination with the cheese.  I had to use camembert as the store was out of brie wheels and it was great-I think any soft ripened cheese would be wonderful prepared this way.  Beautiful presentation, got tons of compliments on it-people thought it was store bought.  A great recipe that I will definitely use again!!

I'll be honest, I thought this was a strange combination but my friend swore up and down it was amazing - and she was right!  Didnt include cranberries, and used toasted walnuts instead of almonds. A delicious susprise that is a nice change from standard hors d'oeuvres.

DON'T make the mistake I made and cook this on the bottom rack of your oven. Had to move the rack down to make room for our oversized ham and forgot to move it back up. Needless to say, I overcooked the  Brie trying to brown it (oops!). The Ham turned out nice though ;-). Overcooked brie is spongy, by the way. It had a GREAT flavor...used the Apricot preserves and followed this recipe to a T other than the whole bottom rack/over-cooking issue. Yep, we're going to try it again for Christmas!

This tastes delicious and is very easy to make!   I recommend for anyone because the pastry part tastes great, and the brie and the other flavours mix together very well for a delightful appetizer.

This wasn't a big hit at my house.  I had a very hard time w/the Brie.  It looked REALLY pretty & I loved the idea but I probably won't make it again.

I used the smaller 8 oz wheel of Brie and just rolled the puff pastry out just a little bit.  Definitely let it sit for an hour before slicing!  Merry Christmas!!

i've been making a variation of this for years - its my favorite appetizer. rather than using preserves & cranberries, i drizzle the top (after its done baking) with 1/4 c melted butter, 3 T honey, and a clove of garlic, then sprinkle with chopped walnuts... serve with granny smith apple slices or slives baguettes - so delicious! i can't wait to try this variation and to let it sit for an hour after baking... i wish i could get mine to pour out of the shell like the one pictured, because instead mine is just slightly melty and warm but has to be sliced into wedges.

WOW!!  This is so great!  Every time I make this for parties, everyone goes on and on about how much they love it!  I use apricot preserves and don't bother soaking the cranberries.  I serve it with sliced homemade baguettes from allrecipes.  Wonderful!

I used phyllo pastry sheets, they were out, it was december 23rd and I had to finish my cooking. The result was amazing, I read a different recipe that used phyllo but used the rest of the ingredients in this recipe. I can't even start saying how much better it is if you use phyllo, only two or three sheets covered in melted butter, try it!

Excellent but needs more cranberries. I softened mine a bit. The best part about this was getting a cranberry in every bite. Make sure you lay out a small cheese knife and cut into it when serving. I think a lot of my guests were intimidated by it and didn't know what to do with it. I really liked this with celery sticks.

Very easy but very impressive looking and tasty.  If you don't have puff pastry, canned crescent rolls work well.  Delicious!

It was pretty, I felt the crackers were not needed. Tasted just as good with just the puff pastry and I cut into very small wedges.

this was ok, but was too sweet for my taste. i made the brie with apricot preserves and craisins, but i think next time i will try a more savory chutney to offset the sweetness of the cranberries.

Easy, fabulous recipe.  My market was out of the 13.2 oz brie wheels, so I subsituted a smaller one and still followed the same recipe. Worked great...used strawberry habanero preserves to give it a little kick.  Everyone loved it!

This recipe was very easy to make and it turned out to be very delicious. I added more apricot jam on top of the brie, and skipped the almonds and it was a great success at my Christmas party. It is an easy appetizer to make that will satisfy the palates of many.

Melt in your mouth delicious! Followed recipe to the letter but used Red Raspberry preserves and Craisins for a holiday appetizer. I was worried about baking for so long then letting it stand for an hour but that is the KEY to the success of the consistency of the dish was PERFECT!! Gone in SECONDS!

Some of our friends get together each month to do a progressive dinner.  We were in charge of the appetizer this month and made this along with another dish.  It was so good!  I elected to make use the apricot preserves which I loved and left out the almonds to save a few calories.  Anyway, it was heavenly and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!

I used to frequent a restaurant with a baked brie appetizer that was so good.  The restaurant closed last year, and this recipe sounded close to what they had.  I made this last night, and this is way better!  I used raspberry jam, and made the recipe exactly as written.  It turned out perfect.  I can't wait to make it for our extended family this weekend.

delicious!  I did it a little different, using fig preserves instead of apricot or raspberry and i left out the cranberries.  It was an amazing pairing with champagne for new years!  And very easy to make!

Delicious and fancy :)  I cut the brie in half and spread the preserves. I use apricot and then I chop up some dried apricots and layer with toasted sliced almonds.  An elegant appetizer!

Made this the first time yesterday for a party and it was a hit!  I used two wedges placed together to make a rectangle since I couldn't find the round brie, and dressed it like a present with ribbon and bow made from pastry scraps.   One thing, though, maybe others can help with -- I found the pastry very difficult to cut through with a straight knife without squishing everything.  Would a serrated knife work better next time?  Also the pastry stuck to the lightly floured counter top after I rolled it out.  Any tips?

Everyone loved this served at a French dinner party. I substituted salted pecans and raspberry preserves and nixed the cranberries. Perfect.

This is truly the greatest. Two tips: 1) wait until it cools before digging in otherwise the melty cheese will come pouring out. 2) I nix the cranberries, apricots and nuts and replace it with carmelized onions. What can I say...

Amazing! I made this as an appetizer/dessert for a double date. It was ALL gone by the end of the night. The apricot jam and cranberries really compliment each other and the pastry and almonds give it a nice crunch. Let's just say I will be making again!! Thanks a bunch!

I'm not used to eating these, so it was probably just me, but I found it to be too slimy. And the cheese took maybe 3 hours to become semi-solid enough for my taste. Until that point, it oozed out into a thin, flat goo. Guests enjoyed it's flavor though!

i made some adjustments to this recipe so here it goes. i only added slivered almonds on the top of the brie before covering it with crescent roll dough (but will try puff pastry next time), made my own raspberry jam and served it along side of the baked brie. very simple and delicious. can't wait to try other fruit/nuts/honey options, and adding them before baking next time

Amazing! What a huge hit as an appetizer before a big Christmas dinner. It was a huge appetizer that was very, very simple to make, but extremely impressive to all my guests (I was asked 4 times if I made it myself). I can't wait to make this again for our NYE party....but I will let it rest for about 30 minutes before cutting into it (did not do this the first time around).

A HIT at work, pot-luck! I had to print out recipes for everyone... My only change was I softened the cranberry's in orange juice and I did use pecans. Next time I will take the pasty out of the package before defrosting, mine was still frozen and did not roll out well. The shape was square not round... But no one knew this but me!  I would like to try it with mulit-berry jam next time... A must try!

I used the raspberry preserves and a double-sized brie wheel - the result was nice and tangy; only issue was that, even after sitting an hour, the cheese was still quite melted and oozed out onto the plate. This could be related to the large size...

Wonderful!  Took this to a party & all loved it.  The only changes I made were using pecans (instead of almonds) and orange (marmalade) preserves instead of apricot.  I'll make this again soon!

This turned out very yummy - I just wish I would have waited a little longer before cutting into it.  It ended up being a huge pool of cheese!

Made to take to a party, it went over pretty well, especially with people who like brie. Was very easy, and went together pretty fast. I used 6 sheets of phyllo ( I had this on hand) and spread each layer with melted butter. I folded them up together all at once, like a calzone, and folding the edges together at the sides. My brie was smaller the the one called for in the recipe. Think the larger one would be better. Soaked the cranberries first in triple sec. Very good.

This recipe was quite good.  I served it for Christmas Eve.  I wished I did not let it cool down though.  We had fun making it and everyone enjoyed it.  I will make it again.

Muchly enjoyed by all through out the holidays....  I did make a second one... with this I used marmalaide jam... Was not shy on the preserves.. instead of coating all of pastry , I put enough on to cover Brie (top & sides) I then put the preserves & the cranberries right on the brie with the nuts (used pecans).. I then folded in pastry, flipped & baked.... just gave it a little more flavour & consistancy with the jam, nuts & cheese...  yummmmmmy...

I have made baked brie using crescent rolls for number of years. I change up the toppings each year. This year I used raspberry jelly and chopped pecans. It was a hit as usual.

I make this every year for the holidays, with a few adjustments.  I cook the cranberries in a little OJ and amaretto with brown sugar to taste. (I have used peach brandy too) and what a difference.  I also toast chopped walnuts add to the cranberries for a warm topping. I use the rest of pastry to make leaf or Christmas designs on the top of the baked brie. Everyone asks for this recipe!

This is a great recipe and I've made it many times but I made a few variations along the way, and the biggest crowd pleaser is the following... I brush the rolled out pastry dough with egg whites but don't cut any off.  I place the brie in the center of the pastry.  On top of the brie I use a raspberry preserve or jam and on top of that, pecans toasted on the stove top in a little bit of butter.  Then I wrap the dough over the top and tie it off with baking string. It presents beautifully and tastes delicious!  I serve with crackers, sliced french bread, and apple slices. Everyone always wants the recipe!

I applied the egg white to the edges and couldn't stick the dough together then so all the jam leaked out. It was ugly and I didn't have the jam inside for the flavor. I may try again without applying the egg white to the edges.

This recipe was WONDERFUL as is.  I chose the raspberry jam, craisins, and toasted almonds.  It's incredibly easy to make, and was a HUGE HIT!  One of the best recipes I've made from this site.  I made two, using a 14 oz Brie for one, and an 8oz Brie for the other.  I didn't trim the pastry much, just folded it underneath so there was TONS of soft pastry to eat with the cheese.

Easy to make, even for a novice chef like me, and got rave reviews.  Kind of messy.

Disappointing recipe despite the glowing reviews. I have been making sweet baked Brie for at least 20 years for Christmas Eve. I followed this exactly. It was bland compared to my normal preparation. Also, allowing it to set for one hour before serving was a very bad thing. It took away from the crunchy flakiness of the puff pastry, which became somewhat tough, and the Brie was barely warm, let alone "flowy" like my family likes it.

A big hit Christmas Eve.  Easy enough to make--and actually kind of fun.  I followed the directions exactly and will certainly make again.

Made this for the first time as a Thanksgiving appetizer. My family loved it, and they even fought over who got the last bite. As a typical Southern family, they'd never tried this. However it looks like I'm making it again tonight for our Christmas Eve dinner, by request from many of my family members. I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great! Definitely let it cool for the recommended amount of time, and it's probably a good idea to bake it in the dish that you're going to serve it in. I had a hard time transferring it after baking.

Oh my this is excellent. Since I tried this recipe a few years ago, I have to refrain from making it TOO often. It is absolutly delicious.  I like to serve (along with crackers) fruit such as slice apples with it.

The best brie en croute I made was making it caramilized onions that is cooked in garlic, butter, salt and pepper. I've maded this for the past 4 years for appetizers during the holidays. I am skeptical using jams/perserves coz it sounds to sweet. I love the buttery flavors and the sweetness fromm the carmalized onions. Everyone loves my brie en croute with the caramilzed onions.

I loved this recipe...even though I messed it up.  I bought the thin sheets of Philo, insted of Philo dough.  So, I kind of had to piece it together.  Even though it did not look like the picture, it tasted just as good!  Will definitely make this recipe again using the right materials.

Mine turned out okay, but the puff pastry didn't rise very well and it was kinda greasy. Still, tasted delish!

This was VERY good.  I used a wedge of really good double cream brie instead of a wheel.  It turned out good, but did leak through the pastry.  I'm sure that was my fault.  Oh, I also used walnuts because that's what I had on hand.  I will definitely make this again.

This was wonderful!  I made this for a small New Year's gathering and it was a hit!  I used a triple berry fruit spread and very little almonds.  I felt the spread and cranberries made the dish!
