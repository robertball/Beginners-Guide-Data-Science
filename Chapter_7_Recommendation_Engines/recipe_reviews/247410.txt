5 stars for edibility, 3 for pointless ingredients. The mascarpone gave it a lovely texture, but all you can really taste is the peanut butter. Next time I wonâ€™t bother with honey, salt, or vanilla.

This was good, but we didn't love it. Something about the texture and the honey/peanut butter/chocolate combo was unappealing to my kids. If you're a fan of honey to sweeten you will probably like it.
