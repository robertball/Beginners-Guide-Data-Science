I used a Low-Sugar Marmalade because I thought it might be too sweet. It was fine using the low-sugar, but after tasting it I think the regular marmalade would have been fine,too.The overall flavor is very good. The only thing I would change is to not cook the vegetables so long. Once the sauce is added and you have to cook it to thicken, the vegetables become overcooked. I also made this with chicken instead of the shrimp and it was still fine.

I was a little apprhensive at first, but it actually turned out pretty good. Tasted almost like I had ordered in!  I would definitely make it again.  It took a while to make though ... mainly preparing all the ingredients ... but worth it.

My whole family enjoyed this recipe. I thought the sauce needed to be a little less sweet so I reduced the amount of marmalade and increased the soy sauce.

I thought this was a great recipe and rather quick to make.  My husband doesn't like broccoli, so I used snap peas which tasted really good.  I also added onions and mushrooms.  I'll make this again!

Easy to prepare and very tasty, altho 1 TBS of
hot pepper sauce made this dish too hot for our
family. Will adjust next time. Kids liked it too!

This is absolutely delicious! I love really hot dishes, so I used hot pepper jelly instead of orange marmalade. I won't do that next time, because I was the only one who could take the heat. That said, the other flavors were excellent and I know with the right preserve, this will be a huge hit.

It's a little too hot!  And could add a little more cornstarch in order to thicken sauce.  It was still a tasty meal though:)

This was great!  I agree with Theresa though - the broccoli became overcooked while the sauce was thickening.  Next time I'll just steam it for 1 - 2 min instead.  I mixed all the sauce ingredients ahead of time and refrigerated.  I love ginger, so I used 2 Tblsp instead of 1 - it still was not a pronounced ginger flavor!  It doesn't take long at all to prepare, except to peel and devein the shrimp.  The first time I made it I doubled the sauce so there would be plenty for the rice, but I really didn't need to. This makes a really wonderful meal!  I loved the inclusion of the onion, peppers and broccoli!  Be sure to use a top-brand orange marmalade in this!

As prepared, it was a little spicy.  We cut the hot pepper sauce down to 1/2 teaspoon.

This item was not worth the cooking/prep time. The orange flavor was ok at first but got overwhelming very quickly. My wife said it made her feel sick.

I really was not that impressed with this.  I don't think I'll make it again, but maybe with a few changes.  I would not steam the veggies, I would just simply stir fry them.  I prefer crisp veggies, and they were just too limp for my taste.  Also, even with the sugar free jam, it still had too much sweetness for me.  I would use half the amount of orange required. I was not a huge fan of the consistency, the sticky sweet combo is just not in my taste.  All in all, wasn't horrible, but not a keeper!

I was apprehensive of the marmalade. The food looks great but the taste is not that good. This is not the same mandarin stir fry vegetables I had tasted. I will not make it again.

This was great! Although I agree with others that the broccoli gets overcooked - even though I only cooked the veggies for a couple of minutes.  Next time I'll just toss the broccoli in when I add the shrimp and sauce to the pan. 

And while my husband and I like flavorful food, I only used 1 Tbl. of the hot sauce and we couldn't imagine the heat if I had used the full 2 Tbl.  This one's a keeper!

Awesome.  I didn't have quite enough marmalade, so I used about 1/4 C crabapple jelly to make up the difference.  It was amazing.  I also used all the veggies out of my fridge: cauliflower, mushrooms, celery, carrots, onions & broccoli.  My new found favourite stir fry sauce.

Excellent!!! My husband doesn't like too much heat so I reduced the amount of hot sauce to 1 tsp. and he kept saying, "this is really good, will you please make it again."  And I will.  It looked attractive also.

I made it just as written- everyone in the family liked it. It's not too "hot"- the other ingredients tone down the hot sauce quite a bit.

I have now made this recipe twice and it is delicious!!!  My husband and I both loved the flavors and the spiciness of this dish.  We served it over hot minute rice and dinner took no more than 20 minutes from start to finish.  And the leftovers tasted terrific the second night.

Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!!!

Super easy and tasty. I omitted ginger because I didn't have and it was still great. I might try a lower sugar marmalade because it was pretty sweet (hubby liked). I will definitely use this recipe again.

I was suspicious of the marmalade in this recipe, rightly as it turned out.  This is surprisingly ordinary, considering some of the ingredients, and not worth the time and effort.

Very good! I had to adjust the amounts for just my husband and I. Also I used fresh pineapple instead of marmalade because that's what I had on hand, used juice instead of water. I didn't have broccoli so I used red, yellow, and orange sweet peppers, green bell pepper, carrots, green onion, and yellow squash. My shrimp was precooked, so I added the vegetables in step 2, then the shrimp, and pineapple, and step 1 sauce at the end. I will definitely try this again and use the marmalade with broccoli, although I thought my combination worked well.

Loved it.  Will try it next time with chicken. I used less heat; didn't measure, but it was likely about 1 tsp. tabasco which was enough of a bite.  Very good favour overall.

Used pre cooked frozen shrimp and eliminated the water. Made the sauce a little thin, but still a delicious meal. Would have been better fresh, but the prep time was low. From getting home to the dinner table was 30 minutes.

I changed the serving amount to 4 and used 1 lb. of fresh shrimp. I used a bag of stir-fry vegetables to speed up the process.  Next time I'll make the rice first because the vegetables got soft quickly. I didn't have hot pepper sauce but added 1/8 tsp. red pepper flakes instead.  Also used powdered ginger and garlic.

I followed the recipe and it turned out great. Like others I wasn't sure at first and waited for my husband to taste it first. It was delicious and I would definitely make it again, maybe with chicken or pork next time to switch it up. I didn't have a problem with my veggies being overcooked, maybe others didn't have the temp high enough? Mine thickened right up....actually a little too quick!

This was a great easy recipe. I used ready to eat shrimp and merely heated them in the skillet with the oil and seasonings (which made it very quick) and added sugar snap peas and water chesnuts to the veggies. also used my homemade orange marmalade that has a very strong orange flavor. Reduced the amount of chili sauce for fear it would be too hot but I will crank it up just a bit next time.  My husband loved it.

I used the full amount of orange marmalade.  I think in the future I would try 3/4 cup.  I only had regular marmalade.  And I only used 1tsp of the pepper sauce because I was feeding it to children.  This was a nice base recipe.  I'm sure you can mix and match meats and vegetables depending on what is in the fridge/freezer.
