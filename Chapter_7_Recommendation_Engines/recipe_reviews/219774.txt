One of the best veggie soups I've ever had. Only needed about half of the milk that the recipe called for and I used shredded jack cheese instead of the processed cheese. My whole family loved it.

This was good however I quickly realized that I did not have a large enough stock pot for this recipe! As a result I could only add 2 cups of milk. I also used fresh green beans instead of canned and mushrooms instead of broccoli. It was still very tasty.
