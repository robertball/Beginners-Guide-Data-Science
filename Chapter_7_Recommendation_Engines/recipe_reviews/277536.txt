This recipe was surprisingly delicious. I usually make Swedish meatballs, which while delicious are very rich and something you can’t eat too much of. The meatballs in this, on the other hand, are extremely light. I actually went back for seconds. Cooking was easy as well. I reduced the liquids down for 25 minutes rather than 10 as I like it slightly thicker, and the meatballs weren’t anywhere near being overcooked. 

Highly recommended.

I love this recipe ! Thought it was very fun to make as the ingredients were different from ones I usually use. Love the water chestnuts to provide the crunch. Juice was incredible !!  I even bought a bottle of Sake to use in it. I'll make this again for sure.

Will make this again, delicious and comforting. Low Broil didn't get my meatballs browned enough, so next time I'll put it on high despite the smoke. A squeeze of siracha sauce on top brought it all together.

Easy, delicious and inexpensive.  Lazy Girl served it over ramen for a complete meal. We loved the Napa Cabbage. I used drained tofu and that was the way to go. Next time I'd dice it a bit more finely. 

I was cutting up a couple of  on-sale Boston butt roasts to get pork for braising and pulled pork. There were bits and pieces too small for braising, so I trimmed and  minced them up into my own ground pork.  Not without effort, but less time than it takes to drive to a butcher.  Also pretty much free. 

I had a package of wood ear mushrooms so added them to the other ingredients. I think they made a nice addition, but wouldn't make a special effort to include them in the future. 

I have to watch my calories during the day to be able to eat Chef John's dinners.  I will absolutely use the shitake/chicken broth to make super low cal chicken/shrimp  and vegetable soups for my lunches.  Very flavorful.

Excellent flavor!  I didn't squeeze water from the tofu, so meatballs were very wet.  otherwise, easy to prepare, easy to serve

I will definitely make this again. I didn't change anything.  Wonderful flavors that go so well together. I wasn't  too happy with the Nappa Cabbage though. I never had it before. It has a light subtle flavor compared to regular green cabbage but it wasn't as tender as I would have liked and it's rather expensive.  Strangely, to me, the stalky parts were tender and the leaves were tough. Cooking the leftovers longer didn't help.  It was a large head, after doing some reading, I might not have peeled enough of the outer leaves away. 

My first time trying Shiitake mushrooms too. They too have a nice subtle flavor but again, rather expensive compared to reasonable substitutes. Next time I'll try Green Cabbage and Baby Portabellas. The meatballs are so flavorful I think they can stand up to stronger flavors.

I added some Angel Hair Rice Noodles to the leftovers. Good stuff.

Had high of expectations for this dish.  Perhaps because of that it was bound to disappoint and it did.  Meatballs were good but not 'mouth-watering' or even close.  And it was a lot of work with some exotic ingredients that will unlikely be used again before having to be thrown away.  Dish was tasty enough (tho a bit salty..more brown sugar?) but won't make again for those reasons.
