My family and I love these cookies, when making them your self they are very sticky but if you rub butter or margarine on your hands before rolling them in a ball you will have much better luck.

Recipe makes much more than 4 doz unless you make huge cookies. You have to watch these carefully or they will burn. Try using one cakemix and half the eggs and cool whip. My 7yr daughter loved shaping the balls and rolling in powdered sugar. The dough was very sticky though and the powdered sugar helped.

Sounds like a great recipe.  Have been using cherry chip cake mix to make cookies for some time but we have a problem finding cherry chip cake mix.  Who makes it?  Will have to contact them to get it in our area.

Maybe I just don't like cherry chips, but something in these cookies tasted slightly off.  The tip to butter your hands before rolling the cookies was a lifesaver!  It really cut the stickiness down.

Very good cookies. Be sure to grease your hands when you roll them, these are a sticky mess
