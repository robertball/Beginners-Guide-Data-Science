I was looking for a drink that combined mint and spiced rum and I'm so glad I found this one.  My husband and I really enjoyed this drink.  Thanks!

I like to say "Mo-Jee-Toe", but I don't tend to like drinking them as much as I like saying their name.  This recipe intrigued me w/it's use of Captain (R).  It didn't disappoint!   The only slight modification I made was to use Diet 7-Up in lieu of soda water (though, in thinking about it, perhaps it's not a modification, after all...).  I can definately see making this again when we have fresh mint on hand.  CHEERS, byrnesette!
