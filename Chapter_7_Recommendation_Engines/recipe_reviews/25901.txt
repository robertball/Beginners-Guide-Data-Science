This was a HUGE hit at our Super Bowl get together last night.  It was compared to the dips found at restaurants.  I am having to make more today for my daughter, she was very upset when it all disappeared.

My Mom always made this dip for fried shrimp.  Differences were more catsup, no salt, paprika, no eregano, no pepper and tobasco sauce instead of cayenne.  It is excellent on fish too also onion dippers.  Oh forgot to say my Mom made this many many years ago since I am now 66 years old.  Enjoy it I sure do.

Left something to be desired, really.   I salvaged it by adding a little garlic powder and a little worcestershire sauce to my tastes.

This dip was awful, and after following the recipe, there was nothing I could do to salvage it.  Had to throw it out!

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out amazing! I've used it as a dip for onion rings, a spread on French bread, mixed with broccoli slaw, and whipped into double-stuffed potatoes! This dip has endless uses!!!

We enjoyed this dipping sauce today with Ore-Ida All Natural Cracked Black Pepper & Sea Salt French Fries.  The horseradish gives this some nice tang, and I would use this as a fresh veggie dip or with grilled burgers or shrimp, as well.  Nice, versatile dip with many applications.

This is similar to another recipe I have for this....Southwest Kicker Sauce.  I like the one I use now better, but this is still good.  Thanks for the post.
