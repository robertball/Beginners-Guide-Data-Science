I doubled the recipe and made a traditional loaf and the loaf shape described here. The bread has an unusual taste because of the anise seed and is kind of like eating soft pizzelles. I think I would add more raisins next time to better balance the anise taste. The crust is chewy without being crisp and is very nice. It's definitely an out of the ordinary bread. I served it with homemade butter.

I don't normally care for anise but I enoy it in this bread. In my home we make this bread for St. Joseph Day March 19!

This a great-tasting bread and very easy to make. I will be making it again this year on Mar.19 in honor of St. Joseph. It is a tradition in the small Western NY town I grew up in.

Giving 5 stars because I adapted the recipe for the bread machine and I rate my modified version 4 stars so giving benefit of the doubt to the original:) I use the dough setting so the machine does the work for me and then I bake in 2 cast iron loaf pans in the oven. My changes were to increase all ingredients: 4 cups flour (1 of which was my home-ground whole wheat flour) 2 tsp yeast 1 1/2 tbsp honey 1 c water 3/4 tsp salt 2 1/2 tbsp butter decreased anise seeds to 2 tbsp but added 1 tbsp anisette liqueur (my dough seemed a bit dry) and kept raisins the same. Bread was very good and I thank you for sharing the recipe!

First the review then notes! Bread has a great sweetness from the Golden raisins and a very subtle flavor from the anise. It s fairly moist and rises well in any traditional shape. Needs no topping or spread. The difference I had was this. 1 cup hot water (100 degrees f or so) Add yeast directly to the water with 1 tsp of sugar to activate and mix well. You should see foam rising to the top. Then add to the other dry ingredients. Follow all other directions as posted:)
