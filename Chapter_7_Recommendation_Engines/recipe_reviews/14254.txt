I thought this was too sweet and vinegary for my taste. There were no other seasonings and the color was bland. Very unappealing.

I think this is simple and has a nice twang to the flavor.  I give it a four.  If you like a sweet vinegar taste, this is a great potato dressing.

This household loves all types of potato salad, and this is a nice dressing.  It reminds me of an "egg dressing" my Father used to make when I was a kid.  I read the reviews, cut the sugar in half, and thought it had just the right amount of sweetness.  I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings, and it converted nicely.  The white wine vinegar was almost a little too mellow for us, so I will try something a bit bolder the next time, maybe white balsamic or just apple cider vinegar.

Made this yesterday for lunch was good but I would change a few things. I decreased sugar to 1/2 cup but would still decrease to 1/4 cup as it was still a little sweet. Also reduced butter by half and it did not hurt the recipe.
