A great recipe for the grilling chef in your household.  My husband and I made this together, what a tasty meal.  I served this meal with condiments:   guacamole, sour cream, shredded lettuce, and  cheese  and my spicy pinto beans for a great meal.

I used the dry ingredients as a rub on the steak, set it in the fridge for 6 hours, and then grilled it. Perfect balance for us.

I used lemon zest because I didn't have orange or lime.  I also only used a teaspoon of chili powder because we don't like things too hot

I didn't have  shichimi togarashi,  so I skipped that step. Other than that I made this as written. I have to disagree with others who said to reduce the spice. It is spicy but I love spicy food and really enjoyed this.

Super spicy but don't let that stop you.  The recipe base is amazing.  Just control the amount of heat by reducing the spicy ingredients.

Really good but very spicy. My dad has a sensitivity to spicy things because of a medication and I halved the cayenne pepper and pepper flakes. It was still a bit too much for him and almost for me so if you don't like spice I'd start with a quarter of it and go up from there if that was too little spice for you.
