I used homemade vanilla GREEK frozen yogurt and Truvia instead of white sugar in this recipe. I made no other changes. This was really good, I was quite surprized! For me, I would double the spices when I make this again or even use apple pie spice. This was a nice treat after a long, hot day. NOTE: This is quite liquid-y. If you don't want it as thin, cut back on the apple juice.

I first made this exactly how the recipe was written and found that it was too thin. I would suggest lowering the amount of apple juice or added triple the ice cream. I topped mine with fresh whip and a dollop of caramel apple topping I got at a local store. It is delicious, but it small amounts and would say this recipe serves two instead of one.
