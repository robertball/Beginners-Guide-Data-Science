I was looking for a recipe like this to use up 2 cups of buttermilk.  I wanted a simple recipe without too much butter and no need for a mixer.  This pie is delicious.  Hubby & son (both very picky) enjoyed it.  I used a 9" frozen deep dish pie crust, and had just a little extra filling left, so I baked it separately in a small ramekin, and it was delicious, too.  I also added an extra egg since I had only lowfat buttermilk, and it set up perfectly.  Next time I would take it out of the oven when there is a small center of custard that still "jiggles", as it will firm up while cooling.  I am also planning to try it with lemon peel and juice, and once with coconut.  The flavor of the custard is wonderful.  We preferred it after it had chilled it in the fridge.  My first buttermilk pie experience, and I will make it regularly.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I tried this recipe on a whim. My family does not like buttermilk. I told no one what kind of pie it was. All they knew was that mom had made pie. After the whole pie was eaten (which took about 10 minutes) I told them what kind it was no one believed me.We now have a new family favorite. Thank you

I made this pie for Thanksgiving, this being the first yr my Mother passed the spatula to me, lol.  It baked up so pretty that I took it to my parents, and after "sampling", the whole pie was gone!  I baked a second, to make sure it was not a fluke, and ended up hiding it in my bedroom so no one else could eat it!!!  This pie is fabulous!!!  I added the zest from one orange to the batter, and that just took it over the top!!  You gotta try this!!

I prefer my pie to set more firmly than this one but after adding 1 more egg it was fine for us.

I've tried several of the buttermilk pie recipes and this was the best!  I followed the ingredients exactly and extended the baking time (slightly).   This recipe is rich & sweet.  If that's not your type of pie, this isn't your recipe.  As is, it is not "eggy" as some of the other recipes I had made.  My household loves pie - & several mentioned that the flavor is slightly reminiscent of creme brulee'.  I served this the first night, slightly warm topped with a dollop of homemade whipped cream which was not too sweet. Lovely!  Thank you for an excellent recipe.

It's full-flavored but not too sweet! Better than *a certain famous chef's* recipe was! Very easy and quick to make, I can't say enough or eat enough!

A great pie. I told my husband he had to guess what was in it, and he couldn't figure it out. I have never tried buttermilk pie before, but I guarantee I'll be making it again.
  It did take almost an hour to bake. At 35 minutes it hadn't even begun to set. A small problem, considering the final result.

Out of curiousity, I tried this recipe -- it's pretty good, especially if you're a custard fan! The buttermilk gives it a different sort of tanginess.

Perfect the way it is!!  I love that it only calls for 3 eggs.  It's the best buttermilk pie I have had to date.   I can see adding the zest of an orange or a lemon, coconut, perhaps a liquer, but for now I LOVE it the way it is!!  PS  Super simple too.  I prefer to make my own pie crust.  Be sure and prebake your crust 8-10 minutes before you pour filling in...it makes for a flakier crust on bottom.  I hate a soggy crust.

Excellent!!! It is the smoothest custard pie I have ever made; no lumps, bumps nor air holes. I used powdered buttermilk and just rehydrated it with the amount of water called for on the box. I will definitely make this again.

I might have done something wrong I don't know but this pie tasted like sweet scrambled eggs. It needed some other kind of flavor also besides the vanilla, maybe somekind of citrus fruit rind or juice. I also had to bake it for like 1 hr 15 min.

Very Good, I followed the recipe with the only modification was that I had to cook it longer, about 50 minutes.

I didn't think it had much of a flavor. Not too crazy about the texture either. It needed to cook about 15 minutes longer than the recipe stated.

Not bad, just not what I expected.  A little too soft, but not smooth for my liking - I guess what others call eggy(?).  The reviews made me try it instead of my regular one.  It will be eaten - mostly by me - but I won't try to do anything with it.  It does have that funny separation mine didn't.  Unclearly defined layers, but they're there.  I made two & added a couple tablespoons cocoa to the second one.  Layers are more apparent in it.  Other recipe they were both good - chocolate & au naturale :)

I just made this pie, and OH MY GOSH, it was delicious!  I used a graham cracker crust, and added 4 eggs because my 4 year old cracked the eggs for me, and a fair amount of the whites ended up on the counter.  I made a blueberry sauce for the top, and I'm confident there will be no left-overs.

I used an extra egg as some other reviews suggested and it set wonderfully.  The pie had a wonderful texture.  But I did not like the way it tasted.

I was searching for a recipe to use the buttermilk I had left over from another recipe.  This turned out pretty good.  I took it to Thanksgiving Dinner and everyone questioned the name, but loved it after they tried it.  First bite is questionable, but it goes quick after that!

very easy, quick and good result: difficult to say what's really in it. also a good way to use up buttermilk or else: I tried also with a peach yogurth container, and it came out pretty well indeed.

I added an extra egg to firm it up a bit. It was very tasty not too sweet like some recipes I've tried. Next time I make this I'm going to use half the butter as I had to sop up about that much from the top of the pie when it was done.
I also had to cook it 55 minutes.

I have made several buttermilk pies over the years and I tried this recipe. It tastes great on the top layer but it was 90% liquid even after 40 minutes of baking. Of course, my husband didn't complain and ate 2 pieces even after I chilled it for 2 hours to try and get it to set. Buttermilk pies are so difficult to master for me (and I cook/bake a lot!)...maybe it's the difference in altitude?

I could not find my grandmothers buttermilk pie recipe, so I decided to use this one since it seemed to be very similar.  I was wrong.  Tasted nothing like buttermilk pie.

I made it and my husband & friends loved it!  Serve with strawberries or peaches & it makes an awesome dessert.  I be sensible & make them with Splenda Sugar Blend for my diabetic husband & friends - still awesome & feel less guilty!  I like mine warm. Mmmmmm!  Looks just like the photo!

This pie has a more "tart" flavor profile than other buttermilk pies I've tried.  The one thing I didn't like about it was the texture.  It seemed too porous or "airy".

I didn't like this but my husband did so I guess I will just make it for him.  Had a bitter taste to me.  I also realized u need a deep dish pie crust or u will have too much filling.
