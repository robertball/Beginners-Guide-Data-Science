Very good. I used 2/3 cup milk in place of the water after reading other reviews.  Turned out a little thick after it cooled so I stirred in couple TBSP milk to get my desired consistency. 10-18-08:  The consistency of the sauce is perfect when I use 1 cup milk in place of the 1 1/4 cups water with out adding extra milk at the end.

Wonderful !  With 5 kids and a husband who eat ice cream almost every night, the cost of chocolate syrup gets up there a bit.  I changed it a bit - 1/2 c white corn syrup (thickened it just enough), 1/2 c milk and 1/4 c water, instead of the 1 1/4 c water. It's perfect this way.  Just the consistency of Hersheys.  Kids say we should "never buy the store stuff again"

My boyfriend thought that this was great! I did what someone suggested and added the 1/2 cup white syrup, 1/2 cup milk and 1/4 cup water instead of the 1 1/4 cup water.

This recipe was so easy and it was exactly what I was looking for.  I have tried 3 others before this one, and when you put them in the fridge they are too thick (consistency of peanut butter).  This one is truly a sauce.  I did use milk instead of water and added 2 Tbsp corn syrup to thicken it a bit.  I can put this recipe in the fridge and without having to heat it up when I take it out, I can pour it on anything I want.
I put the sauce in little jars, and will hand them out at my chocolate tasting party this weekend.  It makes a great gift!

A rich chocolate flavor, definitely will come in handy for all sorts of things =) I used 1 cup water. It also thickens as it cools, so don't worry if it seems runny at first.

After reading the reviews, I cut the water down to a cup & simmered it (over low heat so as not to burn) for about 5 minutes. It was still pretty thin but OK. Poured it into a hershey's chocolate syrup bottle I had saved & used it in my grandson's  milk. He was happy so I am too. Thansk for the recipe...I don't think hershey's is going to get any more of my money. ;o)

This sauce is wonderful!  Add a pince of cinnamon for a little mexican touch.  It takes a few minutes of stirring to cook...it is well worth any efforts put forth in stirring.

This was really easy to put together and tasted good too.  I used milk instead of water and spread this over a shortbread crust.  I was out of vanilla so I substituted almond extract and had good results.  Will use this again.  Thanks

This was fantastic.  But I did make a few changes.  Use very high quality cocoa.  The darker the better.  Whisk the sugar and cocoa together until no lumps remain in the pot before adding other ingredients.  I used 1 cup of skim milk.  Stir, using a whisk, the chocolate mixture constantly over medium heat.  Once the mixture comes to a boil, stir constantly for 1 minute.  The timer on the stove comes in handy for that.  Immediately remove from the heat, and stir in 1 tsp of butter until it's melted.  Let the chocolate sauce cool completely for several hours, stirring occasionally.  It thickens as it cools.

Good taste.  Cook in a pot big enough to avoid boiling over.  The best part - low fat.

I thought this was great-and I made it as stated, did not use corn syrup or milk.  I made this in the 1st place to avoid corn syupr in the purchased variety, and I wanted it to last a while, so no milk.  It is fine as is!  It is a choc sauce/syrup, not hot fudge!  I use this in choc. milk and it's wonderful.  So much better than storebought choc. syrup.  I put it in a used, clean Hershey's syrup bottle.  :)

sooo good!
it did harden a bit at the bottom, but just keep stirring it, and the rest is grand :)
and i'm happy it makes good chocolate milk too! :)

i used condensed milk instead of water, mixed with a little bit of skim milk so it was creamier :)

Really easy to make and tastes great. I used soy milk  instead of water and it tastes better than any sauce we can get at the store.

The only reason I gave a star was because it looked like chocolate. I did what I was told, but it smelled bitter and tasted soooo bitter! I put on pastries and if I had used something else, they would have been perfect. I was very very very disappointed. It didn't even taste like chocolate. :'(

I will never by chocolate syrup again. This stuff is perfect as is. No need to add milk, as you are only going to put it with a  milk product anyway!

No weird preservatives or ingredients like the ones in the stores.  Made at home, from scratch, normal ingredients and in a matter of minutes!   (I used Dark Chocolate Cocoa...Yum!)

Why pay $3+ for chocolate sauce when you can make this for much, much less?  I did not tell Hubby that I made this (with no variation from the recipe) and he said, "Oooo, Honey!  This brand is the best!" (Okay, it's better than Hersheys!) :D  It's a keeper!  I may cut down on the vanilla next time, though!  Thanks, Sal!

This recipe is a good start but it is much better when made with milk.  I tried it with 1 cup of milk in place of the water like other reviews suggested and it worked well.

I needed a quick recipe for chocolate sauce with ingredients I already had on hand. This was it, and will be forever on! Great for chocolate milk, ice cream...This is FANTASTIC made with the suggestions of replacing the 1 1/4 cup water with 1/2 cup corn syrup, 1/2 cup milk, and 1/4 cup water.

Great recipe! I'm giving it five stars because of ease, cost and taste. I used half milk and water for a richer flavor. I won't be buying from the store again. There is no need to when this tastes much better and it's cheap.

So much better than the high fructose corn syrup you get in the store. I am never going back to store-bought again. Fast, cheap and easy.

I have made this recipe at least 10 times with the exact ingredients listed and it is delicious! My boys can't tell the difference (I saved an old Hershey's bottle and put it in there) The only change I make is that I let it boil on low for 5 minutes to thicken it, and it also thickens as it chills.   Try it- you'll like it!

absolutely excellent!  I used the sauce for sundae topping and for chocolate milk.  Both uses were excellent.  I was amazed at the rich chocolate taste from cocoa!

Excellent basic chocolate sauce! Tweaked mine a bit. Used 1 cup milk in place of water. Replaced the 1 teaspoon of vanilla with 1 tablespoon Hazelnut extract.   MMMM.. Banana Dip !!

This is a great sauce that is so easy to make. I made as is but added 1tbsp cornstarch to thicken. Delicious!

Delicious - i didn't follow the recipe exactly though... i used the advice of another reviewer and used 1/2 cup corn syrup, 1/2 cup milk and 1/4 cup water in place of all water. Love this stuff!

I am placing this rating on the exact recipe above. It was way too thin and bland. I wish that people would rate the actual recipe. This does not deserve 4stars. 
If you are planning to use this recipe I would do as the other comments suggest and add syrup and cut down the water and sub some milk. I'm sure that makes a world of difference. 
It was sub par okay and did the trick for tonight. I was out of heavy cream and real dark chocolate so I chose this recipe because I had all the ingredients. 
Don't get me wrong. It was edible and tasty just not up to my standards of deliciousness. My children on the other hand would have drank it but then again they also would eat pure sugar if it were allowed. 
Bottom line would I recommend and Will I make THIS recipe again. No

Very good! Put a bit too much vanilla in, but it's great, everybody loved it on ice cream and couldn't believe it was homemade, going to use the rest on an angel food cake...

Absolutely the best chocolate sauce!  Used the recipe as stated but added 1 tsp of butter and a pinch of salt.  Not totally fat free now but what a taste.

i really liked this recipe i thought it was great. i made a few changes though because i wanted mine a little thicker

1) Instead of water i did 1 1/4 c milk and then 1/4 cup of heavy cream
2)Then about a TBS and a half of unsalted butter.

i drizzled this on a plane cheesecake. one word delicious!

Recipes like this shouldn't be allowed on the site.  Its sinfully too easy and too delicious.  Why on earth would someone buy brand name syrup at the grocery store ($$$) when they can make this for much less, and it taste so much better!!  I made this with the unsweeted cocoa (Hershey's), white sugar, a quality vanilla extract, and skim milk.  I put a dash of salt in there.  Slowly brought to a low boil, waited one minutes, and then let it cool.  It did form a skin, but I poured it through a fine strainer and now its perfect.  I wonder how long it will last in the fridge?  Hmmmm

This recipe did not work for me.  It might be because I let it boil for too long (5 minutes) as I thought that would help with the consistency issue people described.  Mine got nice and thick but as it cooled, the sugar started to re-crystalize and the syrup got grainy, like there was sand in it.  That wasn't even the worse problem though - it tasted bad.  I woldn't ruin a good bowl of ice cream with this stuff even if it was smooth.  The flavor just tasted like the cooked sugar rather than chocolate.  I'm almost tempted to try it again since so many others had good results and said the taste was great.

I made the mistake of not reading the reviews first - and found this to be quite runny.  The taste is fantastic though, and it was super easy to make.  I'll do it again, but with milk and corn syrup as suggested by others instead.

As per another review I used the one cup milk option. And 1/2 regular sugar 1/2 powdered (because I ran out of regular) and the cocoa powder.  We had this over vanilla ice-cream and it was GREAT!!  My daughter can't wait for the colder weather so we can use this as a base for hot chocolate with some warm milk!! Thanks for the SUPER quick recipe!!

I love this! It is definitely more of a syrup rather than a sauce.  I probably won't be buying syrup from the grocery store anymore!  This is now a staple in my refrigerator.  My family uses it to make chocolate milk and loves the way it dissolves quickly.  It does thicken as it cools and using less water does make it thicker.  You will have to experiment to find the right consistency for you.  Very inexpensive to make.

This is a delicious chocolate sauce.  I altered the recipe to make it healthier by substituting sucanat with honey for the white sugar.  I also reduced the water to just 1 cup.  This makes a decadent dark chocolate milk!  My whole family rated this 5 stars!  It is far superior to the grocery store brand.

I made as directed and didn't follow reviewer suggestions and found it to be very blah. So, next time I'll try it by following reviewer suggestions of adding corn syrup and milk and maybe some butter. But then it wouldn't be the same recipe!

This is definitely a chocolate syrup,not a hot fudge sauce. It's runnier than I expected. I wanted a coffee flavor to mine, so considered making it with coffee instead of water, but because I wanted it a little thicker and richer I made it with whole milk and added some espresso powder. Used a mixture of Hershey's and Dutch processed cocoa powders. The flavor was more adult due to the espresso and I liked it. I made it to serve on cream puffs and wished it would have been just a bit thicker. If I decide to make this one again, I think I will reduce the amount of liquid, or replace some of it with coffee liqueur- or both. UPDATE: after a day in the refrigerator the consistency is much better, like Hershey's syrup. I stirred it into milk and heated in the microwave for some hot chocolate and it worked well.

This was homemade Hershey's chocolate syrup. This was a runny thin syrup exactly like Hershey's too. It was a bit chalky or powdery tasting to me but I think that is because of cocoa powder and lack of milkfat in this recipe. It was fast to make and good over ice cream, fresh fruit, and cake. It is of drizzling quality and too thin to really dip without making a drippy mess. It was super simple and uses ingredients I always have so it will be handy for future reference. Thanks, I can use this again and again.

Very good! Most of the bottled chocolate syrups contain high fructose corn syrup and other ingredients we don't bring home.
With this recipe I can use organic products.
This is my second time to use the recipe. My husband likes it in his coffee. 
This time, I started the water boiling while I measured the cocoa and sugar into a bowl. Stirring the sugar and cocoa smoothed the small lumps and it dissolved quickly in the hot water.  I added a 1/2 teaspoon of salt with the sugar. And added 1/4 cup coconut oil (butter would be good, also) with the vanilla.
Also, I boiled it for five minutes. 
Expect a thin consistency with a full, rich chocolaty flavor.
--It makes more than two cups of sauce.

Delicious and so simple, I always have a jar of this in the fridge. I find a heaping cup of sugar is plenty. I use some cream in with the milk and add a tsp or so of instant coffee to enrich the flavour. I've also tried adding chopped dark chocolate in after it's boiled and it makes it sinfully delicious :-) Thank you!

It was great! My siblings put it on every dessert we make. We keep it in a plastic sauce bottle, which works well for us.

Ha! Who would have thought you could make your own chocolate sauce? Was never something that ever really occurred to me until I stumbled across this recipe. I made this as written and it's purty darn amazing! Thank you Sal!

Quick, easy and wonderful tasting. Would make again as it is made with items I keep on hand and not as expensive as buying it.

Top rating because this is a keeper and had lots of compliments.  I adapted it a bit - used milk rather than water and added about 1 Tbsp. of butter.  Definitely make this in advance and let it sit.  Had some children over and had them make their own sundaes.  This sauce and a choice of sprinkles, whipped cream and cherries for toppers.  Kids had lots of fun.  Had them make the sundaes for the adults too.

Perfect & very quick!  I substituted milk for half of the water and added about 1T of butter and a generous pinch of salt.  Even my vanilla-all-the-way son loved it & asked to lick the pan.

This recipe is phenomenal. I read all the reviews about the consistency problems and went with on 1 cup of water. I panicked a little when it wasn't thickening but DON'T ALTER THE RECIPE!!! It thickens right up as it cools.just as another reviewer said. I let mine cool for a good 3 hours in the fridge and it was perfect. and I totally agree with the other reviewer that said Hershey gets no more of her money. this is a really easy recipe.

This sauce was amazing.  I only used cocoa powder, sugar, water and a pinch of salt.  I did use less water than the recipe called for and it was nice and thick.  My whole family raved!

Bitter.  It’s runny but does thicken up when it’s cooled.   It’s a frugal way to make the sauce  but still not worth it.

Quick and delicious!! I sent my hubby to the store to get ingredients for banana splits.  He came back with NO fudge or caramel sauce!!  I immediately went to ALLRECIPES and found this EASY recipe and it worked great.  I scaled down to 2 servings and followed the recipe as stated.  Since the sauce was very thin while hot, the amount of sauce would cover 4-6 desserts even though I scaled down.  If you let it cool for a short time it does thicken up.

Doubled the recipes, but only used 2 cups water. Used SPlenda instead  of sugar and not only is it low-fat,  now low cal too!!! I am constantly looking for healthier alternatives, which include as little processed food as I can. I try to make as much as I can and this was perfect for us with the Splenda and my kids never can tell it isnt sugar!

This is a great recipe!  We use it all the time now instead of buying our own.  The only thing I changed was cutting down the water by almost half.  The sauce was nice and thick -- like Hersheys -- and perfect for chocolate milk!  Update- I tried this adding the corn syrup like another reviewer suggested.  I'm going to play around with it a little more, but it's nearing perfection!!  Thanks for the tip!

Very yummy sauce & super quick to make.  I did reduce the water to 1 cup as suggested by others.  I agree that *when it cools* it is very much like hershy's syrup. (but better!)

I made this recipe as described...Let this cool to room temp before using on ice cream (duh), Also this recipe is FANTASTIC for Chocolate Milk!  The better cocoa you use, the better the taste.  So this was ok on the ice cream, but DEVINE for chocolate milk!  Always buy the best cooking & baking ingredients you can afford.  It really makes a diffrence!

This recipe is GREAT! I added about a teaspoon of dark corn syrup and about a tablespoon of vegan "butter" as well and it turned out great! It tastes just like real chocolate sauce....minus animal cruelty! I will definately be doing this one over and over!

Divine!  I had the most amazing chocolate sauce on top of ice-cream while in Mauritius and hoped that this recipe would taste the same.  To my surprise, it was even better!!

As per another comment, I substituted the water for 1 cup of milk and it came out great.  My only criticism is that it was a bit sweet for me, so next time I'll reduce the sugar.

I highly recommend this recipe!

Great recipe! Pour into milk to make an AMAZING tasting chocolate milk!I added about 1 1/2 tablespoons of butter to get it thicker and have a more fatty taste and only used 1 cup of water as suggested by many other commenters. Awesome for macaroon dipping!

This is so easy to make and tastes better than the bottled stuff. Based on previous reviews I decreased the liquid and used  a 1/2 cup of water and a 1/2 cup of milk. I like to use dark chocolate powder, add a tsp. of cinnamon and a pinch of salt. It's perfect every time!

This is just like Hershey's syrup!  I will be making this instead of buying bottles of it.  We used this to top dessert but have been making chocolate milk with it.  I think it tastes better than the store bought stuff. I did cook for a bitt longer than called for.

This was incredibly tasty! Like many others, I made some changes. I used just 1 1/3 C sugar, and 1 C milk instead of water. It turned out fabulous!

Super easy and delicious! I only used 1 cup of water as other comments suggested and it turned out great. Be sure to use a MEDIUM saucepan and not small, since the sauce doubles in size when boiling. Also, be mindful that cocoa powder hates water, so mix it with your sugar before adding the water.

I boiled for about 5-8 minutes for a thicker hot-fudgey sauce. Also, I chose to use water like the recipe calls for instead of using milk (as many people here have done) so that my sauce will keep indefinitely in the refrigerator. I poured the sauce in a glass bottle that used to be for maple syrup - easy to reheat and pour when desired!

This is a simple and great chocolate sauce.  For those of you who want something a little thicker and creamier but still low fat, add 4 marshmallows.  It gives it the perfect consistency with not much added fat. Also, you can add a coffee whitener if in a pinch, about 4 tablespoons.  I live in Japan and chocolate sauce is incredibly expensive.  This was a lifesaver.  

Add 3/4 tbsps of mint extract for a great chocolate mint sauce.

BUT I really tweaked it by not using any sugar.  I used the 2/3 c. cocoa then used 1/4 c. Stevia.  1/4c fat-free 1/2 & 1/2, 1/4c corn syrup, 1/2 c fat free milk.  Added 1 Tbs sweet butter and pinch of cinnamon.  Because there was no liquid from the melted sugar I then added water after it boiled and it was perfect.  Then vanilla.  It could use even less Stevia because it was very rich. I use Trader Joes Baking Cocoa for everything.

This is a simple, quick, easy-to-make chocolate sauce recipe. It's fine, in my opinion, for putting into another recipe, or for kids. If you wanted to use this as a star component of a dish - say with strawberries, etc, you might want to use one of the fancier versions suggested by other reviews.

** This recipes makes WAY more than 1 cup ** - And I'm not offended by the excess either.  It's a simple recipe.  I used half & half instead of water (because I had it and it needed to be used up).  I didn't actually boil it for the minute it stated either.  So far it looks like it will turn out well.

This tasted like store bought chocolate syrup.  It was okay, but if I'm going to spend the time making chocolate sauce I want it to be better than than the store bought stuff.  Probably wouldn't do again.

When making another chocolate sauce, I will be looking for another recipe. i just wasn't impressed at all w/ the flavor of this topping. I expected flavors to meld together well, but they just didn't compliment to my liking. Disappointing for me, but experiment and see if you can get it to your liking

When I first made this, after letting it cool I realized it was way too thin. So I put it back on the heat and boiled it again for 2 to 3 minutes to thicken it up some. After that it was the perfect texture and tasted pretty good, too. Next time I will probably use milk like many other reviewers.

A little bit of orange zest to this recipe adds an exotic twist.  I added a 1/4 tsp (most people may prefer less).  I drizzled this sauce over orange citrus french toast.  The rich dark chocolate with the orange is exquisite.

Found this July 11, 2009 when my husband informed me he was out of chocolate sauce for his ice cream. He loves it and said don't buy chocolate sauce again this is to so much better, I have made 3 batches in a month because we have used several different ways. Great mixed with maple syrup for pancakes.  I read all the reviews and prefer the thicker sauce using less water or canned milk and adding 2 tablespoons butter at the end with vanilla.

I know this is one of the "diet be damned" things to do, but I replaced the water with whipping cream. It was the best chocolate sauce I have ever tasted. I tried making it again a few days ago and added a splash of Bailey's with the vanilla. Heavenly! I'm only giving it four stars though because without the changes it's good, but not "the Best!"

Pretty delicious. I used milk instead of the water and added some corn syrup but those were the only changes I made. Makes for delicious hot chocolate, chocolate milk and I'm planning on dipping bananas in it later. Thanks for a yummy sauce!

Very good! I made a few changes based on the other reviews and also because I stink at following directions exactly. :) I used 1 cup of cocoa powder, 1 cup white sugar, 3 Tablespoons of dark Karo syrup, vanilla, 1/2 cup of heavy cream, and 1 cup skim milk. It took a long time for the mix to come to a boil, and I let it boil for longer than a minute but not more than three or so I would say. In any case it's a creamy sauce that turned out very well. Great flavor and texture! Was amazing on vanilla ice cream.

I will never buy Hershey's again!!! This is the perfect thickness and flavor. I did use 1c milk instead of water, simmered for 1 min. I added it to a tall, cold glass of milk while still hot, and its soooooooo yummy! Thanks for a great recipe!

Followed other reviewer's suggestion by replacing the "1 and 1/4 cup water" with 1/2 cup corn syrup, 1/2 cup 2% milk, and 1/4 cup water.  Served over a Rachael Ray dessert which consisted of vanilla ice cream rolled in crushed amaretti cookies that are soaked with amaretto liqueur.

The first time I made this, it turned out thinner than I would have liked.  I reduced the water to a cup and added about 1 cup of cocoa, and it made a big difference.  The great thing is, you can make it as sweet as you like it and adjust the cocoa too.  Great in chocolate milk for the kids.

As others had suggested I added 1/2 cup water, 1/2 cup milk and 1/4 cup corn syrup instead of the 1 1/4 cup water. And it turned out perfect! Albeit ALOT more than I expected

made enough for: sauce on 9 sevings of tiramisu, 4 chocolate milks, sauce on a whole tub of icecream (6-8 servings likely) and I still have about a 1/8 of a cup left. Will make half next time.

The taste was fabulous but it definitely needs to cook for a little bit longer.  I also added an extra spoonful of cocoa - I like my chocolate dark.

This recipe is awesome! I picked it because I had all the ingredients on hand. (no whipping cream or corn syrup) I reduced the water to 1C and simmered for 5 additional mins as previously mentioned. It was thin but did thicken up as it cooled. We ate some right away, and I put the leftovers in the fridge overnight. It was thickened up nicely the next day. This is a great make ahead chocolate sauce.

Easy, fast, delicious!!  Great for chocolate cravings.  I used 1 cup water and left everything else the same.  I dipped bananas in it and it was so tasty!  Was definitely runny until it cooled down, then was just right.

This is great! I too used just a little less water. We are using it in milk and we also drizzled it over Buckwheat pancakes for the kids!

Very Yummy!!  I used Dutch Process cocoa.  I would reccommend boiling for longer than a minute just so you dissolve all the sugar so it's not gritty.  I will make more of this!

I have two little kids who drink chocolate milk every day, and this meets with their approval.  It's quicker to make this than it is to run down to the store to buy a new bottle.  Definitely a winner, and makes my life easier to boot!  Thanks!

Not very good.  To thin even after allowing it to cool.  It tasted bitter.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Will not make again.

It seemed way too thin when it was still warm, but it thickened up nicely onced cooled. (Still, I might use a touch less water next time.) It's been perfect drizzled over brownies, and was a nice treat in my iced coffee this morning. This recipe will satiate my chocolate cravings for years to come. Thanks!

This is almost exactly the same recipe my mom always used, except she added a little flour for thickening, and a little butter.  This recipe is absolutely wonderful HOT, and served over slices or squares of yellow cake [instead of using icing].  I can't eat icing, as it is so rich. But with this recipe, I can cut the amount of sugar used, so it won't be so sweet and rich - it's just right.

A simple chocolate sauce.  Perfect for what it is.  if you expect a thick hot fudge, this is not the recipe for you.  This is more like a chocolate syrup.  Mmm!!!

I made it as per the recipe and it was really nice. It's got that dark chocolate taste which Hubby and I like a lot but the children liked it too. It was very quick to make, and also seems to have improved from being stored in the fridge for a couple of days, it almost seems as it thickened a bit (probably from being cold). It is a thin sauce, not the kind of stuff you buy in stores. I like it that way, a bit goes a long way. We'll be making it again. And like KRYSTENL said, it makes wicked chocolate milks!

Really very good--but....I did use 1/2 cup of cream and then the rest of the liquid as water.  I know, not the same recipe, but it was super good.  Served over fresh pineapple.  Super quick to make, too!

I amde this using Splenda instead of sugar and it was very dark and had a good flavor. My only complaint is that it dries out pretty quickly and turns a very dull color. Next time i will maybe add a little butter or cream.

This chocolate sauce was running and wouldn't thicken. And when we tasted it, it was very bitter. We ended up changing the recipe and adding cornstarch syrup. The recipe was not worth the trouble of making it. Thank you very much though!

Very easy to make and delicious deep-chocolate taste. It reminds me of the Hershey's syrup we used to buy when I was a kid - the consistency and flavor are similar. I gave 4 stars because I would like the consistency to be thicker. This is easy to double or triple if you need a lot.  As is, the recipe makes about 8 ounces.

Following others' advice, I used 1/2 c karo and 1/2 c milk + 1/4 c water.  I also cut waaay back on the sugar. I used about half the amount called for in the recipe and that was sufficient for me.

I also used milk instead of water. I used 2 1/2 cups of milk though. It was a little too thin, so I'm going to add less milk next time. I'm definitely going to make this again.

Good, basic chocolate sauce. As written, this is a 3 to 4 star. Make it a 5 to 6 star by listening to other reviewers. One cup milk replaces all water. A pinch of salt ups the flavor considerably. Stir in a dab of butter with the vanilla to get a velvety texture. 

NOTES: 1. Use a bigger pot than you think you need! It boils high! 2. This makes a lot! Well over two cups. 3. Stir all lumps out of cocoa prior to making. 4. You don't need syrup to thicken this. That stuff is so bad for you. This is a make ahead recipe that gradually thickens as it cools. 

I'll make this often. So rich! Wonderful over chocolate chip pancakes.

Excellent taste.  Very easy to make.  Would have given 5 stars if it was a little thicker.  May use some of the variations on other reviews next time.

As with other reviewers, I used 1 cup milk vs. water and added 2 Tbsp. of light corn syrup.  However, I also added 1 tsp. of instant coffee granules to deepen the flavor.  What a hit -- my family can't get enough of this syrup.

I followed this recipe verbatim, and we really liked it. It is saucier, although it does thicken up a bit after cooling and refrigeration. I would compare the consistency of it to a slightly thinner chocolate syrup like Hershey's. If you use that brand of cocoa powder like I did then it will definitely taste like Hershey's. Pic is 24 hours after refrigeration.

Tip: I recommend constant, gentle stirring so that it doesn't burn on the bottom.

So nice to have a quick easy recipe. I only had time to read the last review so I did replace the water with 1 c  milk. I added about 3 pats of butter. Tasted great. A few lumps but they were small& I didn't use a wisk. Next time I would.

I made the recipe using CANDL suggestions. It's a wonderful sauce for ice cream using ingredients that I always have on the shelf. No more Hershey's syrup for us. This is great.

This recipe is delicious and very simple to make. It is rich and has a deep chocolate flavor.  The only change was that I used 1- 1/4 cup of milk this time, and it was superb!!

My second time making this, with equal success. I did cut the water to  one cup, and added about a tablespoon of corn syrup both times (because I had it). I mostly wanted it to add to almond or soy milk and use in coffee, and it's perfect for that.
To anyone saying it was bitter or thin, first, try following the recipe. You do need to stir for a good 10 to 15 minutes at medium heat before it even comes to a boil, and continue for a timed minute after. Take the pot off the hot burner and continue to stir a while, or it will scorch . I didn't add the vanilla until it had cooled a bit, and yes, that does help.
It's just about as thick as the Hersheys sryup, and even though I used a cheap brand of cocoa, I think much better. The type of cocoa you use will make a difference, but mostly, keep stirring, and don't let it scorch.

Easy to make, but I also changed the liquid to 1/2 C corn syrup, 1/2 C milk & 1/4 C water.  It make a good amount of syrup so use a large pan for the boiling. I was concerned about how thin it was, but it thickens after cooling.  Allow enough time to cool before you use it.

Simple and does the trick. Very versatile recipe for add-ins. Per recommendation, used 1 cup of milk. Used dark cocoa powder which added more depth. Use a whisk to prevent burning and boil over.  I played with it by adding a teaspoon of chili powder, cinnamon, and a dash of almond extract in addition to the vanilla. Sure was tasty and perfect over ice cream...or to eat with your fingers...hahaha. Thickens more when it cools.

I made this out of my love of hot fudge and rich chocolate on top of a cookie a la mode and it was fantastic.  Used mine with Hershey's classic unsweetened cocoa and can't wait to make variations in the future.

Ive been using this recipe for years. Use good cocoa from Trader Joes or Aldis. Hersheys cocoa is bitter brown flavorless dust and has little cocoa butter in it.  I don't mess with this recipe except to add a tbs more cocoa and a pinch of salt. Salt makes the chocolate pop.  I don't add milk because it doesn't need it and it will go sour in the fridge if kept for any amount of time. One batch lasts for months made with water.

Tastes great! I think the trick to this is cooking it in a skillet and boiling it for at least 2 minutes. I also followed other reviewers and only used 1 cup of water and added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch. I stirred constantly while cooking and while allowing it to cool a bit.  This sauce was the perfect consistency and SOO delicious!

Love this chocolate sauce.  The only change I made was to reduce the sugar to 1 1/3 cups.  For variations I will sometimes add cayenne pepper or  substitute part of the water with strong brewed coffee.

Without changes, this recipe produces a good flavor, but the sauce is far too runny. With suggested changes, like corn syrup, milk, or just reducing the water, it'd probably be much better. The original recipe as written; however, is not a great product.

I used half milk with the water and let it boil for more than five minutes, but couldn't get it to thicken at all. I ended up using corn starch, but it was still much runnier than I would've hoped. I added peanut butter at the end, and left out the vanilla. If I were to consider making it again I would cut the sugar down to 1 cup.

Used 3/4 cup choc, 1 cup water, 1 cup sugar and 1/2 cup Agave syrup, dash of salt , tsp vanilla, tsp butter, and a tbs of cornstarch to thicken.   Really good.

This is such an easy and delicious chocolate sauce!   I used the 1/2 C milk, 1/2 Corn syrup, 1/4 C water and it is so amazing.   Will not be buying chocolate sauce ever again!

Very rich. Works good for making chocolate milk but a little too rich for using as a sauce.

This is thee best, quick, and wonderful chocolate sauce I have tasted.  Used it on sundaes and will use it on other desserts.  Will probably use less water next time (for a bit thicker consistency) but the flavor is pure and real and way better than store bought varieties…yay!  Thanks Allrecipes for another winner!!

This recipe was delicious. I did cook it a few minutes longer though. One minute was not long enough. I also added a TBSP of vanilla instead of a tsp. The reason for this was it was a cheaper vanilla and not as strong as the good stuff. My husband and kids think it tastes just like Hershey's syrup. And yes you can also make chocolate milk with it. We will never buy chocolate syrup again.

This reminds me of the chocolate sauce we used to use you know, way back. I do substitute milk and a bit of cream for the water. Oh and use good cocoa as well.

When you are craving chocolate and have none in the house, this is quick and easy with ingredients on hand, and it tastes good. Maybe not as great as thick hot fudge sauce in a jar that you heat in micro, but good enough to satisfy.

Easy sauce to make. Tastes delish!  If you are looking for a fudge sauce this IS NOT it, as this chocolate sauce is a thinner liquid.  Great for chocolate milk or over Cheerios in milk :). I have it stored in the fridge in an airtight glass jar. 
Other posts had complained it tasted too much like Hersey's, and it does, but the point of homemade goods is knowing the ingredients of what you're eating/making/drinking.

Great sauce, followed the method of the recipe as written, with exception to the liquids. I added the amount of liquids the recipe calls for, except I used 1/2 water and 1/2 cream.  Next time, I will make with half and half for all the liquid.  The flavor of the sauce is perfect. The thickness is what you would find from a bottled syrup.  Adding the milk would thicken it, and I do prefer the thicker sauce.

Great recipe for a simple chocolate sauce.  I love that it stays fluid when cold, so it's easy to use for all kinds of things.  We put this on pancakes, and in coffee.  It's not just for ice cream.:-)

I used one cup of whole milk instead of the water.  I just finished it and tasted a spoonful - definitely yum but far too sweet for my taste - I'll cut back the sugar next time.  Can't wait to drizzle this over my cheesecake!

This is easy to make and store!  Just cool and put in a mason jar or any type of jar, and store in the refrigerator! I use it for chocolate milk, ice cream topping, and it makes a wonderful addition to frozen coffee! The possibilities are endless!

Had unsweetened chocolate so decided to try this.  We had a sore throat in our family so this was a perfect change over plain vanilla ice cream.  The only thing you need to do is watch it carefully so it doesn't over boil.

After some changes substituted milk and added 1 square of bakers chocolate into the pot-cut back to a little less than 1 cup sugar and added 1 tbsp karo syrup- great sub for Hershey's syrup but still a little thin to call a sauce-tastes great!

I think the sauce burnt a little, which gave it a bit of a smoky taste. We still enjoyed it, but I'll be more careful next time!

Taste was wonderful, but fairly soupy as written.  I threw in about 1/3 cup dry skim milk and dissolved a rounded Tbsp of cornstarch in about 2 Tbsp. cold water, then whisked in till it boiled and thickened up a bit.  Corn syrup would work just as well.  Also added 2 tbsp. butter to good effect.

I got a good chocolate sauce out of this. I wanted to use it in the mini fondue pot I received for Christmas, and it worked alright. While I was cooking it, it seemed thin, so I added about a scant Tbls cornstarch. This turned out to be a bad idea because the sauce thickened as it cooled. Therefore, I recommend sticking with the original ingredients (except I used 1 C milk in place of the water as others did) and letting it cool to thicken. I was able to add a little milk in after it cooled to thin it out, so no harm done :) Overall, a great recipe that is easy to make with ingredients on hand

It is far too sweet for my tastes.  Someone likened it to Hersheys syrup, and I'd have to agree.  A chocolate sauce that uses cream and/or butter would be more satisfying and worth the effort.

Based on other comments, I reduced the water to a half cup (for half recipe) and boiled for 5 min. This is absolutely the best chocolate sauce I have ever had and I will never buy pre-made again. Nice consistency a few minutes after you take it off the heat, and really nice the next day from the fridge. Still thinner than store-bought, but we liked it. It has such a rich chocolate flavor! And question: I thought that you couldn't boil milk because it would curdle? So I don't understand how so many reviewers are using milk successfully. Maybe I've just screwed up heating milk in the past. I always use 1% percent milk.

Agree with other posters it is way too thin esp without the milk. The other thing to be mindful of is pick a good quality cocoa powder and make sure the taste compliments the dish. After using it for the desert we saved the syrup and used it to make hot chocolate that was a step above 90% of hot cocoa mixes.

I was drawn to this recipe because I needed a chocolate sauce and quick, but a few minutes into boiling it, I almost regretted my choice of this recipe.  It was waaaay to thin (plus, I wanted to serve it hot and couldn't), even after using only 3/4 cup of milk instead of 1 1/4 cup water.  I then proceeded to add 2 tablespoons of corn starch to try and save it.  As it cooled, it became really rich and perfect in consistency (which is why it gets 3 stars- it wasn't a complete disaster).  I would keep this in my fridge for a quick cold pour, but you cannot serve this one hot because it's just too thin.

Had a craving for chocolate syrup to go with my vanilla ice cream so of course went here to find a recipe to make my own. I followed the recipe except for using the other reviewers advice to use 1 cup milk instead of the water and it was perfect! I should have used a medium saucepan because it was hard to keep it from boiling over. I didn't realize it would bubble up so much!

This was a HUGE hit with my kids, who haven't really ever had anything other than berries on their vanilla ice cream. We are careful about having pure ingredients in our diet and this definitely works! I am anxious to try it in chocolate milk!

Worked good in a pinch but a little runny for my taste, even after it cooled.  I substituted milk for the water and only used 1 cup.

This gets the fifth star for creating "something out of nothing."  OK, not nothing - but close to it. We used it on ice cream & for a latte, two-thumbs up for both apps.

Perfect!  Tastes pretty much like Hershey's.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I did use 1 c. milk and 1/4 c. corn syrup instead of the water like the other reviewers.  I also cooked it at just below boiling for 5 minutes to get all the sugar well dissolved.  I adore this recipe.

I used part milk instead of water as others suggested.  I reduced the recipe as there was only two of us and still had a lot left over.  It thickened after it cooled to a nice consistency and kept well in the fridge.  There's definitely no need to buy conmercially made sauce when you have this recipe.

Love this recipe!  It is simple and delicious and all natural, unlike the store bought kind that has all the weird stuff in it like partially hydrogenated oils and high fructose corn syrup.  I will definitely make this one again!!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  :)

This is a very good recipe that is quick and can be made from ingredients that cooks commonly have on hand.  The only changes I made were to reduce the water to 1 cup, and to cook the mixture for about five minutes instead of one.  It thickens up after cooling and I thought the flavor changed for the better after it sat in the fridge for a few hours.  Very yummy!

Incredible! Easy, very deep chocolate flavor.  I did replace about a 1/4 cup of the water with light corn syrup and used a little less sugar.  I also simmered it for longer than the recipe suggested to make a thicker syrup.  Served it with vanilla ice cream on top of "Best Brownies" from this site.  Great dessert.

This is THE BEST. I made it for over 30 years and finally lost my recipe. Imagine my delight at finding it again. Originally it was on the side of Hershey boxes, I was so sad when they stopped printing it. Thank you for making my day! Helen

Good flavor but I also found it too runny. DO NOT add chocolate to thicken this. My husband and I tried to add semisweet baking chocolate and it wasn't the smooth sauce it's supposed to be, it keep small bits of the whole chocolate. Just use less water or try corn syrup. Next time I might make the syrup first (sugar and water) and when that thickens add the cocoa.

Perfect! I substituted 1 cup milk for the water and added a splash of orange extract in the end. The amount of sugar in it scares me but I'm guessing any less and it would be too bitter.

this is a great recipe as is, especially for kids. but my husband and i made it richer for us by using dark chocolate cocoa powder, using 1/2 cup less water, then stirring in 1/4 cup half and half (would have used cream if we had it!)with vanilla. yum!

Yum! It was very good but instead of of 1 1/4 cup water I used 1 cup of milk, 1/4 cup water and two tablespoons of corn syrup just to thicken it up a bit.  I also substituted raspberry liquor for the vanilla!

I was in the mood for a good bowl of ice cream with chocolate syrup and realized one problem--I didn't have any!!  So I came to Allrecipes and typed in chocolate sauce.  This was the first recipe I came to and with 4 1/2 stars looked like a good one to try!!  It was yummy and hit the spot.  I made half a recipe since I wasn't sure I'd like it and just wanted basically enough for one dessert.  I told it 4 servings and then rounded down the measurements (it called for some strange amounts like 1/3 cup plus 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon!!!).  Still yummy!!

This was quick and easy with onhand ingredients.  It thickens as it cools, but I will next time use a tad less water.  The consistency is similar to Hershey's syrup with a much more genuine chocolate taste.

It is wonderful to be able to make "Chocolate Syrup" with everyday pantry items. This is a perfect sauce and so easy, too. One hint -- prepare in a skillet, it comes to a boil faster.

I'm currently living in a country where chocolate syrup is not available, so this recipe has been a lifesaver.  My husband uses it to make chocolate milk, and we also use it for hot chocolate and to pour over ice cream.  I've even shared it with several Peace Corps volunteers in the country.  It's amazingly easy and tastes fabulous!
