This is wonderful! I guess some could say that it's more of a quick bread than an actual cake, but that doesn't change the fact that it tastes great! I did have to make a few changes (simply due to what ingredients I had on hand): I didn't have plain Greek yogurt, but vanilla flavored, so I used that mixed with a little bit of sour cream. I also didn't have agave nectar, so I used honey, and only a 1/3 of a cup of it due to the fact that the yogurt I used had added sugar in it. Other than that, I did everything as written. It's a dense, moist, tangy, and flavorful way to use up some blood oranges. The only little issue that I had is that when I added the "blood orange syrup" to the warm cake, it fell in. Not a huge deal, but it might be better to let it cool quite a bit before pouring it on.

This was quite the experiment for me! It was a very rich, dense cake, but my husband and I really enjoyed it! I subbed honey for agave and it gave a nice accent to the citrus.

This is a great recipe.  I subbed lemon for the flavors, sugar for the agave  and regular olive oil.  I mixed the dry ingredients, mixed the wet ingredients and then mixed them together.  So easy.  I will use this and try all sorts of flavors including vanilla, lime, orange, lemon, etc.  I used the toothpick method to test doneness.  It's not fancy shmancy, but a good and easy loaf cake.
