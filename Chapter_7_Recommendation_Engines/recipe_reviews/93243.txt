I was in search of a turkey gravy for Thanksgiving that I could make from scratch using the turkey drippings.  (This was my first attempt at that; I had a McCormick's Turkey Gravy packet ready and waiting for backup as gravy is not my forte).  Thanks to this recipe, it turned out I got to use the best of both worlds to make a great gravy!
.
I left out the giblets (nobody here is a fan of giblets) and lessened the water by 1/2 a cup for a nice thick absolutely delicious turkey gravy!  
.
Thanks for the incredible easy-to-make and extremely tasty recipe. :)  I'm definitely saving this one!

Excellent recipe.  Used turkey pan drippings instead of the broth and did not use the optional chopped turkey giblets.  I did use as other suggested (1 tsp. of each) poultry seasoning, ground black pepper, seasoned salt and garlic powder.  And added 1 tsp. of ground sage too.  So creamy and yummy!  Will use again!  Hate non-thick turkey gravy, this was a huge hit at my table this year!

Turned out great!  It was the first time I ever made gravy so using the mix as an ingredient made me less nervous.  It tasted great and was a big hit at our family Thanksgiving dinner.

This was great. I used the water from cooking the neck as my liquid along with 1C of the turkey drippings. Great flavor and nice consistancy.

Didn't like it. Some of my Thanksgiving guests said it was okay, but the rest of us thought it had a prominent "floury" taste.

Quick, easy, and delicious! My pan drippings made this even better. Wonderful reheated and non-lumpy gravy, this one will remain on the Turkey Day rotation.

I am so scared of homeade gravy! This tasted homeade, looked homeade, and was delicious. I threw in cooked, diced giblets. YUMMY!

My wife is death on package gravy and this makes a nice way to soup it up closer to what she would make from turkey drippings.

Last year I really wanted to try more of a homemade turkey gravy instead of using the same ol jar one I’ve always purchased. I tried this one and O-M-G!! It was soooo delicious!!! Everyone over it and now we will never go back to store bought. Even though you do use a store bought mix, it still tastes homemade. Definitely give it a try. You won’t be disappointed!

Too runny for me.  I had to add several tablespoons of cornstarch to get it to the consistency I wanted.  The flavor was good though.  The next batch  I just used the directions on the back of the package substituted turkey stock for the water.

Although tasty, it was a bit too thick for my taste. If I were to make again I would cut down in the flour a bit. I added chopped turkey to it was very good.
