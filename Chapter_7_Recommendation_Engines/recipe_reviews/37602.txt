I actually made this for a friend who doesn't cook much.  She and her husband loved it.  Of course I did try a few bites before I gave it away.  I agree that 8 oz of velvetta is enough, and make sure to season the meat mixture with garlic and onion.  Otherwise, you might find it a little bland.  The taste of the mushroom soup does come through in this recipe, so make sure you like mushrooms before you add the full can.  I wouldn't make this for myself because I like stroganoff the "old fashioned" way, but for those who are in a hurry..this is your recipe.

I would describe this dish as home made Hamburger Helper.  It is simple and easy to make.  My 18 month old loved it.  I doubled the amount of soup that I added (mostly because I only made 1/2 a recipe and didn't know what to do with 1/2 a can of soup).  I used the amount of Velveeta called for and found the cheese taste fine.  I suspect it is a taste issue since there was so much disagreement on how much cheese to add.  I also chopped some onion and garlic and browned that with the beef.  I will probably make again since I don't usually buy hamburger helper.  It was fast, easy and tasted good.

This recipe is so easy!! I liked the taste, and I am not a fan of velveeta. I added sliced mushrooms, and topped it off with sour cream.

Great recipe: very tasty sauce.  I took the suggestions of other reviewers and modified this recipe.  I cut the water in half and cut the cheese down to 1/2 lb.  I added 1 cup of sour cream and added worcestershire, garlic powder, and onion powder.  I also added two cans green beans.  I used rotini instead of egg noodles.  Easy and very tasty.  My kids (4 & 2) gobbled it up.

This was excellent!  Like some of the other reviewers, I also added some spices like onion powder and garlic, along with a little extra pepper.  One thing I will change for next time is that I will use less Velveeta.  It was a little too cheesy (though not watery at all), so I plan to cut the cheese by a third or even a full half.

I was really hoping that we would like this recipe better than we did.  Despite all of the reviews I didn't cut the cheese down because we all love cheese so much.  The only thing that we could taste was the cheese, and it was really thick.  I may try this again, but I will be sure to use less cheese.

I thought this was good and easy!!  I used cream of celery soup as that is all I had in the house.  I did use the 12 ozs of cheese and thought it was good but probably had more noodles than the recipe called for.  Will make again!

This was OK. I added some sour cream to make it more creamy. I probably should've added some milk to thin it out some. Will make again.

Huge family pleaser here. I used cream of onion soup because we aren't huge mushroom fans, but I've made it twice in five days now, and my family asked (while still eating) when I'll make it again!

I was so excited to make this, but the end result was not at all what I expected!  Way, way to much cheese.  I used the full 12oz called for...maybe try 6 to 8oz and see what you think before you add more!  I don't think I'll try it again.

This was good & simple.  I added onions, mushrooms, salt, pepper & minced garlic to the ground beef.  To the soup,  I added 1/4 cup sour cream and a tbls of creamy horseradish sauce.  Also reduced the cheese to 8 ozs.

I Will definately make this again.

4 stars only because I had to modify the recipe. I used about half beef stock and half water. I used 1/2 lb of velveeta, and didn't use the entire can of soup. It was getting a bit thick so I ended up watering it down a bit with some additional stock. (I think maybe I let the noodles cook too long and the water/stock I added cooked out so there wasn't much there to thin out the soup.) I didn't need to add any salt since I used the stock.

Very cheese, very creamy.  Not bad for a canned soup recipe.  We reduced the cheese to 1/2lb and used macaroni instead of noodles.

A quick, satisfying meal.  I cooked the ground beef with onions, sweet peppers and about 1 teaspoon of minced garlic.  I also used only about 4 ounces of Velveeta and a little shredded cheddar.  This dish cooks quickly and the leftovers reheat well.  I'll make it again!

This was really good. I used the 8 oz package of cheese and it worked great. I also seasoned the beef with some garlic powder, onion powder and pepper because I just can't imagine cooking any meat plain anymore. Added sour cream and would have added a little milk if I had any on hand. Very similar to hamburgar helper both in taste and ease, but it did taste better and was healthier. Plus it cooks up a whole lot more!

My family loved this easy version of Beef Stroganoff. It was a hit at the dinner table.The only things I did different was season my ground beef and cut the velveeta cheese down to 8oz.PERFECT!

This was easy, cheap, and good!!!  I am not really a cook at all and this turned out great!!!  I used cream of mushroom with roasted garlic soup and only 1/2 lb Velveeta.  I also added garlic salt and Lawry's salt.  Was even good the next day!!!  Thanks for a regular on this lazy chef's menu!!!

We really liked this recipe. It was like a "homemade" hamburger helper. Yum! Unfortunately, the amount of Velvetta cheese makes this impossible for me to make again due to the fat content of the dish. I have high cholesteral. I may experiment and see if I can't get the fat down on this one. Kids are gonna love it!

This was really great! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because after making the dish as the recipe stated, I found it to be a bit too bland for me. I doubled everything, then added 1/2 stick of margarine, and cut the velveeta in half and substitued sharp cheddar instead. I also added about 3/4 cup of Parm cheese and lots of garlic salt and additional black pepper and parsley. I didn't have egg noodles, so I broke up spaghetti and that worked great too! Thanks for this great addition to my recipe box.

Very tasty! Next time I would probably just use the entire 1lb of velveeta and maybe only half a can of the soup, so it was more cheesey than soupy tasting, but I will make it again. Super easy meal for a weeknight and very filling.

I agree with other reviewers - way too cheesy.  8 oz. should be plenty.  I think it would have been too bland had I not added tons of pepper a little garlic powder and some paprika.  I think with these tweaks I will definately make it again and rate it a four-star then.

I made this tonight for my family. It was really pretty good. I did follow what some other cooks did and seasoned my meat with chopped onion, s&p, garlic powder,a smidge of onion salt and a few drops of worstershire sauce. I also used a different noodle (elbow mac) because it was all I had. I actually had to add extra water than what was called for because I was cooking mine in a pot rather than a skillet. I added only 8 oz of light velveeta and believe me it was plenty (and I like cheesy).I also added a can of green beans but think corn or peas would be yummy too (I almost thought you might need to use a less salty veggie than the green beans but they were ok). I stirred in about a 1 1/2 of light sour cream at the end. It was alot healthier than hamburger helper and tasted much better because it had that homemade taste and mine made alot more than 6 servings!!

This is a good recipe if you want a hot meal with minimal effort.  I think I'll season the ground beef while browning next time I make this. I went by another reviewers suggestion of only using 8 oz. of cheese, but will use the full 12 next time.  Could have stood to be a little cheesier in my opinion.  Husband really liked this dish.

My husband and I really liked this. My daughter said it was just ok and my son hated it (but he's a extremely picky eater so I take his reviews with a grain of salt!). I followed the recipe as shown here except added an extra 1/2 cup of water because it didn't seem like 2 cups was enough. I used wider noodles. It worked out well and I was able to prepare the recipe quickly. I will make this again and probably add some seasoning to the ground beef. It does remind me of Hamburger Helper, which I despise and refuse to buy because it's so bad for you. However, because I have full control of the ingredients going into this recipe I don't mind serving it to my family.

I have to give this 5 stars because I had it cooked up within 20 minutes of getting home from work while the kids were playing with their toys.  My husband and my 3 yr. old loved it - so easy and tasty!

It's too creamy and chessey for my hips and waistline, however, my son and husband love it.  A hit at youth potluck dinners.

This is WAY better than any boxed hamburger helper!!!  I used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom and it was FANTASTIC!!  This will be one of my family's favorites from now on!!

I made this for dinner last night and my husband loved it. i used a few different spices that we like while browning the meat and used a bit more pepper. But it was good, one we'll use again. Although, next time I won't use the whole can of soup and a little less water...it was a little watery. But very good!

Comfort food at its best!  This recipe at the Velveeta website calls for 8 oz. of cheese, which is just right.  I don't know why the one posted here calls for 12 oz.  I seasoned my extra lean ground beef (90/10) well with garlic & onion powders, and added a drained, small can of mushrooms.  I used 2% Velveeta and Healthy Request Mushroom Soup, and along with the extra lean beef, these made the dish less lethal, but it still tasted decadently creamy and comforting.

Pretty good.  Very quick and very easy.  The only thing I did was add garlic and onion to the beef, other than that I left it alone.  I've already given the recipe away and it made great left overs!  Thanks for the idea!!

My husband and son loved this recipe. I prepared as directed adding only mushrooms.  Next time I would add a TBSP of worchestire and equal amount of ketsup.  My son hasn't eaten so much at dinner in a long time.

We referred to this recipe as "Cheese Soup".  It was merely hamburger helper with a bit more work.  Perhaps I prepared it wrong, but it was very runny and not so tasty.  Not a keeper for us.

Not bad - my young daughters didn't rave "yum" when I served it, but they ate it.  I also cut down on the amount of cheese and threw in some chopped onion when browning the hamburger.

I though this recipe was good and easy.  I sauted mushrooms and onions and added them with the mushroom soup and it added a little extra.  This reminds me alot of Hamburger Helper, but my husband and son really liked it.

This was a good recipe. I did find it to be a little to salty. I only put in 1/2 the velveeta and added a mixture of cream of mushroom and cream of chicken. When i cook it again, i would add no salt at all, the soup and velveeta adds enough of that. But overall great, my 2 year old couldnt get enough.

I thought this was quite yummy.  I used 12 oz of velveeta, and I thought it could've been just a little less "velveetaey", so 8 oz would have been good.  I also added parsley, extra pepper and garlic powder for added flavor.  Great recipe, quick, easy and delicious.  Will make again.

Pretty good.  I like that it was simple, hearty and creamy.  I used a little less Velveeta and it worked out well.  My husband just thought it was "okay", hence the 4 stars instead of 5.

Not a fan at all.  Thought it was really runny.  Didn't like the cheese based sauce.  However, I did use generic cheese product.  To begin with I don't really like ground beef and noodles.

I thought this was really delicious. My whole family loved it; but I do think next time, I will cut the cheese down a bit.
