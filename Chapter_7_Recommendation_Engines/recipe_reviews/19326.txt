Pretty good! I made several changes but followed the basic idea: I used around 3 cups of uncooked rotini, no oil, 1 pound of lean ground beef, the taco seasoning, 2 cloves of garlic, half a medium onion - diced, 1 15-ounce can of diced tomatoes, no salsa, more like 3/4 cup of water, the black beans, and around 1 cup of shredded cheddar. Oh, and I omitted the cilantro as my husband despises it. I followed step 1, then for step 2 I browned up the ground beef, then added the diced onion, the chopped garlic, the can of tomatoes, the taco seasoning, and the water. I let the meat mixture cook and thicken up for around five minutes, then mixed in the beans and let them warm for two minutes. I then added the drained rotini and the cheddar, turned the burner off, and let it all warm for a minute or two. We served it with salad, ranch dressing, light sour cream, and shredded cheddar and Mexican blend cheeses. Taco-y, beef-y, and pasta-y, yum! Even our four-year-old enjoyed it! Thanks for sharing, Kayce!

We liked it!  Best of all, I had all ingredients on hand, except for cilantro, which we skipped.  I used Laura's Lean Beef Top Round, about 1 lb.  I had a fajita seasoning mix, which I coated the beef in - it almost gave it a lime-fajita taste, the can of black beans, and I added a bag of steamfresh corn.  It was good!  And easy! And I didn't have to go to the store!

This was quick, easy, and tasty.  The kids thought that it was too spicy, but I would make it again for my husband and me.  We liked shredded cheddar cheese sprinkled on top, too.

This is so easy!  I, of course, made some changes, I didn't want to have to go to the store.  I used a lb of ground beef and added the taco seasoning to it.  I then added 2 cups salsa, 1 can of black beans, 1/2 cup of water and my cooked noodles.  I then sprinkled a little bit of cheese on top.  It was so easy and very good.

l have posted picture on this dish. 

l made few changes, l cut the amount of salsa and 2 big tomatoes diced to it. I only have kidney beans since l don't have black beans still taste good. l don;t have cilantro handy so l skipped it. 
And next time l will use ground beef instead of strip beef since l found the funny texture of it. 
My husband love it he said it's excellent!!!thank you!

I think this dish was very flavorful and everyone that tried it liked it...the one thing I will switch next time is instead of the top round steak, I will probably used ground beef just so it has more of the taco feel...

This was easy and delicious.  I used the chipotle taco mix and topped with a cilantro lime pesto from Whole Foods.  A very quick dish.

This was good, but a little spicy for my taste.  Instead of just salsa I would use some stewed tomatoes next time.

My husband and family loved this recipe, I did make a few changes, I used gound beef and browned it with garlic and about half of the taco packet.  Then Added pinto beans, 1.5 cups of 2 different salsas (I ran out) and 1/2 cup of water.  cooked for a bit, then added the pasta and cooked for a little more.  Topped with cheese, then cilantro, and added some sour cream too.  My husband kept making the yummy sound.  I thought it was really good too.  Thanks for sharing!

Very Good.  I am not a fan of round steak, so next time I make it, I will use hamburger/taco seasoning

This was SO good! My family loves tacos & burritos, so I wanted to try something new. I followed the recipe & it came out perfect! The only thing I changed was that I used a lower sodium taco seasoning. I also added low-fat sour cream & light shredded cheese to compliment the cilantro.

Great Dish, a little heavy on the salsa portion and the addition of mushrooms is in order.

My family loved it! I used mild taco seasoning, much more pasta than was called for in the recipe, and less salsa. I do not keep cilantro around so I skipped that. It was not too spicy with these changes.
