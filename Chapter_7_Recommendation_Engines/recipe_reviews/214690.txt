was very good however I went 1 step further...I turned it into a bbq sauce. I added 1/2 cup palm sugar (can use equal amount of honey or brown sugar) 1/4 cup cider vinegar 1 cup catchup and 1 tsp mustard. I hate wasting good whiskey. It was so flavorful on my pork loins I wish I had more meat to cook...

Absolutely wonderful! Used this with shrimp and chicken today -- super!! (and to the other reviewer -- so Jack Daniels is a Tennessee whiskey -- manufactured about 110 miles from the KY border and 225 miles from the home of Makers Mark my favorite KY whiskey -- big whoop. It was only a suggestion anyway. That's no reason to give a GREAT recipe a 1-star rating. Use whatever whiskey you want. It's all good.)

Used on venison round steaks. Marinaded 48 hours since dinner plans changed unexpectedly. Delicious! Will use again.

We really liked this marinade! The whiskey mixed with the fruit juices was almost a margarita marinade...greatly enjoyed. I added more garlic and an extra dash of cumin just because. Be careful and watch chicken closely...between the sugars in the juices and the alcohol your food will burn easily!

Quick prep time and very tasty. Because of the citrus juice marinade time should be limited to no more than 3 hous.
