I subbed a half-cup of peanut butter for the cashews. Then I ate half of it in one sitting. Considering that I generally only eat vegetables out of guilt, I’d have to say that this is delicious.

WE loved it as a vegetarian dinner dish!  It was my first time using Tahini, so the consistency was very thick.  I had to add a couple tablespoons of water to get the sauce to spread over the veggies.

Farm boxes can be challenging and I was looking for a cauldiflower recipe that might include some of the other produce gracing my crisper drawer. This worked perfectly since I had the ingredients for both hummus and tahini. My only change in ingredients was using green romanesco rather than broccoli. (Did I mention the challenge of farm boxes?) To  keep the garbanzo beans from getting too crunchy I put them in the oven 10 minutes later. When making the dressing I alternated adding a tablespoon of olive oil with a tablespoon of water until the blender could smoothly blend the mix. It was thick but coated the roasted veggies well. No one in my family eats cooked cauldiflower by choice but I served this as a main dish and had no left overs. Would I run out to buy the ingredients to make again? Probably not. Will I keep the recipe for future seasonal cauliflower delivery? Definitely!

The roasted broccoli and cauliflower was good, but I didn't care for the roasted chickpeas. They were too crunchy for my liking. Also, I couldn't get cashews dressing blend up, it was way too thick.

Delicious! Easy to make and quick to serve. I didn't rinse my chickpeas though. Thank you for the recipe.

I have made this several times, always differently. This time I didn’t have canned chick peas so I left them out, and added a teaspoon of chunky peanut butter to the sauce. I also used more tahini. Delicious!!
