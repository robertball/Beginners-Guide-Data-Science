DEEELISH! It tasted just like the bistro pizzas my husband and I like to get at higher end restaurants.  The only changes I made were the crust and meatballs. I hate making crust so I got a Boboli whole wheat crust, and I couldn't find the meatballs in the recipe so I made my own caramelized onion meatballs. I would have liked if the apples cooked down a little more so next time I think I will heat them a bit before adding to the pizza. Other than that, it's  a delicious healthyish za!
