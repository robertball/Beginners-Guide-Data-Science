This was very good.  Not exactly what I think of when I think fudge but it was really one of the best homemade brownies I have ever tasted.  Very good and it disappeared very quickly

I made these for a gathering at the lake with friends.  They are wonderful!  They didn't last long, and everyone wanted the recipe.

THESE BARS WERE GREAT, BUT VERY SWEET!!! THE SECOND TIME I MADE THEM I PUT IN 1 1/2 C SUGAR.  BE SURE NOT TO OVERCOOK, THEY GET DRIED OUT QUICKLY.  MY HUSBAND AND CHILDREN LOVED THEM.

Wow! Today I just felt like a brownie and since we were in the middle of a snowstorm and I didn't have any box mixes, I found this recipe. I haven't made homemade brownies in years, but now that I found this, no more box mixes. I only made two changes, one on purpose and one by accident.  I added one less egg and, by my mistake, added almond extract instead of vanilla (my bottles look exactly alike).  I knew immediately when I bit into it, had a subtle almond taste which I loved.  I will definitely be making these again... great, simple recipe!

Easy and delish. I had almonds on hand so I used them instead of pecans. I'm taking these to a super bowl party, and I know they won't last! Oh, so good....and easy!

A very simple and tasty brownie recipe.  I would cut the sugar a bit the next time as we found them overly sweet.  Enjoyed by all who tasted them.  Thanks.
