Simple, delicious and VERY kid friendly! I did add some chopped green pepper to the onions and because I didn't have quite enough tomato sauce, I added in a can of petite diced tomatoes (undrained). The whole family devoured this! This chili has a nice, mild flavor that is perfect for any pallet (though, I am sure you could easily up the heat factor). I will def be making this quick and easy recipe again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Made as written at the request of my husband who was remembering this from his childhood. He said it was perfect. New to me, but decent cold weather comfort food.
