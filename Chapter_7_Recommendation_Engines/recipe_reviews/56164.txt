Not a bad ham sauce.  Don't judge the sauce from a cooking taste test.  I almost didn't serve it because of 'in saucepan' taste test.  Thankfully I did try it with a piece of ham and was pleasantly surprised.

This was very quick and easy recipe to make. I did not have half and half so I used fat free sour cream and I thought it was very good (and fat free!).

Very interesting sauce, something different is the best way to describe it, It might just be an acquired taste

I was somewhat disappointed with this sauce. The vinegar was a bit overwhelming, despite the sweetness of the sugar. Though I tried a good bit of it with dinner tonight (and even had seconds), I probably won't make it again.

I'm giving this three stars because I like the fact that this is a unique recipe for ham sauce. I had my doubts about so much vinegar, so sub'd with white wine and sub'd the white sugar with brown. We like it with the substitutions.

Nice addition to ham.  My mom made this delicious sauce and she had a lot leftover.  After giving it to me, once our ham was gone, I made a small batch of macaroni salad and used this sauce as the dressing.

Absolutely delicious!  Tangy and sweet!  We do love vinegar, though, so if you're not a fan, you may not prefer this sauce. I, however, will not make ham without it anymore. It's a keeper!

Hubby really liked this a lot---which totally surprised me because I didn't think he'd like a sweet sauce like that.  I wasn't quite so enamored of it because of the sweetness.  I was thinking that maybe with less sugar and making it brown sugar would help it out.  I did have to strain it for lumps from the egg, even though I followed the recipe to the T.  I'll try the brown sugar next time.  In the meantime, hubby thanks you a lot for this recipe!  :)

Ham is something we cannot eat all the time. Although we find it delicious, it is a rich and salty meat. This sauce, with it's sweet and sassy with the vinegar/mustard undertones, provides a complimentary lifesaver to insure  that nothing from that portion of the pig remains.
