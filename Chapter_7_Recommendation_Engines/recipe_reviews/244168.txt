Thank you for the great recipe!  This made several bars and stocked my fridge with a healthy snack for my family.  I had to substitute apple butter as I didn't have the applesauce on hand last night.  This may have made it sweeter than typical.  They taste amazing!  I love the combination of salty, nutty and sweet.  The coconut and cinnamon also add to the deliciousness.  And they were easy and fun to make!

I made half a recipe, and used a 7" x 10" pan. They taste good, but they are kind of sticky. I ended up wrapping them in waxed paper, and putting some in the freezer, as even a half batch made quite a few. These will get eaten up, but I probably won't make them again.
