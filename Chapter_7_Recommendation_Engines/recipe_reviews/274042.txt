Very good recipe. I made it exactly like the recipe, except I didn't have any vodka. Was really good and easy. The second time I made it I added 3 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder and an additional tablespoon of monk fruit.  Really good and chocolatey .  Some may prefer an additional tablespoon of monk fruit.  The additional cocoa powder adds 3 more carbs, or 1 carb per serving. It may even stretch the servings from 3 to 4. I'm not sure that it will freeze up with the addition of the cocoa powder,  It's been in the freezer for 3 hours and is still not freezing.  It makes a great tasting mousse. Thanks for an easy and tasty treat.
(It took awhile, but it finally began to freeze, so just leave it overnight for a frozen dessert.)

Very, very good!!  Take no time at all.  Will make this again and try different flavors.  Would be great in the summer as a Popsicle.

This treat was a quick, easy fix for my sweet tooth.  I sprinkled a little cinnamon on top for one serving and fresh blueberries for another.  Delish.
