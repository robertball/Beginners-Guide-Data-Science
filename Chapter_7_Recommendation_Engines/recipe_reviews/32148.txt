I used shredded mozzarella instead of Gouda and I reduced the brown sugar to 1/8 c. and omitted the honey and molasses.  I only put on enough sauce to thinly cover the crust (there was lots left over).  The pizza was fabulous--my husband and I ate the whole thing in one sitting!!!

This was awesome.  My family loved it and since I am a super short-cutter, I just used Kraft Hickory dressing, onions, chicken and mozz. cheese.  I will definently make again.

Great recipe, turned out wonderful for me but I can see where using different BBQ sauces and even the pizza dough can make a huge difference. I used a Pillsbury refrigerator dough and prebaked it for 7 minutes then added topping and baked for only about ten more minutes. I also had to substitute the cheese using a mix of Monterey jack and mozzarella. The pizza dough turned out very crisp and seemed to make it less messy to eat but those who don't like crisp crust may not want to try this type of dough or just be sure that it's not spread too thin. My eight year old liked it okay. I loved it. Watch the cilantro it can be overpowering. I would use less than the recipe calls for.

Yum! Cook this, people! I bought the pillsbury refridgerated pizza dough, precooked it for 8 minutes at 400F. I sauted the chicken with some vegetable oil till cooked. For the sauce, I used 3/4 cup of kraft hickory bbq sauce, 2 tbsp brown sugar, 2 tsp mollasses and 2 tsp honey. I reserved some of the sauce to spread on the pizza crust, and put the rest of the sauce in with the chicken. Topped it with sliced red onions and mozzerella cheese, and cooked till the crust browned (about 15 minutes). Yum!

How delicious this was.  I used Jay's signature crust from this site and we couldn't stop eating it.
First as always I marinated my chicken in buttermilk all day(if no buttermilk 1cup milk, 1tbsp white vinegar or lemon juice) this makes for some extra moist chicken.. Then I sprinkled olive oil in a skillet and sauteed my chicken until brown on all sides.  Then I added all the ingredients and simmered for a half hour until the chicken was cooked.  This eliminated getting two pans dirty.  I just kept sampling right out of the skillet before it even made it to the pizza.  I used mozzarella cheese as my cheese because that's my taste preference.
SOOOO YUMMY!!!!

Very ironic that in the title it says not too sweet when its waaay too sweet. Really even if you like sweet things change the recipe to tone down the sweetness.
 Also unlike mozarella, gouda tends to not melt particularly well.
 Finished product didnt look very appealing because the sauce turned a dark reddy brown almost black and the chesse didnt melt well it just went crispy.
 Edible but recipe needs a lot of work.

Pizza was very good except for the cilantro. I couldnt find the cheese so I used an italian mix. Next time I will just use mozz. Also leave about an inch for the crust. I only left a little bit and the sauce spilled over the edge and burnd on the pan. Will make again!!!

I made this pizza last night for supper, but I changed a few minor details.  First, I grilled the chicken, but did not mix it with the sauce; I just spread the sauce over the pizza and put the sliced chicken on top.  I also caramelized about 5 onions and that on the pizza as well. I added some mushrooms and a little bit of goat cheese along with the sliced red onion and baked it until golden and delicious. This recipe is a really good/quick/easy weeknight supper.

Excellent change from normal pepperoni and cheese pizza! I think the sauce is too sweet as written, so add sugar to taste. Also, note that barbeque sauces are naturally sweet, so if you get a honey flavoured sauce, you definitely don't need much more sugar. Even if you do add too much sugar though, it'll still taste fantastic! I like to add a red pepper to the top as well as season the chicken with sweet Hungarian paprika. It gives the pizza more colour and even more flavour!

This is good but it is waaayyyy too sweet (and I like sweet). If I make this again I will definitely leave out the molasses, honey, and brown sugar. It was good but it also made me incredibly thirsty, so much so I could hardly eat it. Also, the sauce was incredibly runny, I recommend baking the pizza on a cookie sheet so it doesn't spill all over your oven. Not sure I'll do this again because I think California Pizza Kitchen frozen BBQ pizzas are better than this.

My family loved this!  But, I tinkered with this recipe-how can so many reviewers be wrong? With that in mind, I left out the molasses and sugar and just used plain old KC Masterpiece hickory BBQ sauce.  I like to see my cheese melt so I used grated mozerella.  Because my family'n not a fan of onions-they were out.  Made my own crust and pretty much left it as chicken, bbq sauce, cheese and I added a little crumbled bacon.  It was great this way!  A very good base recipe for anyone to dress up the way they like.

This was a pleasant surprise for my husband...when he saw me putting BBQ sauce on instead of pizza he was pretty skeptical. His first bite was a pleasant surprise....it was so good! The 2nd time I made it, I added onion, green pepper and a little bit of pineapple! YUMMY! My kids want to have it often!

Great recipe. I made it twice already and it's a big hit in our house. I did find it a bit too sweet but I didn't use 'hickory' flavored BBQ sauce. Next time I'll try the hickory flavored BBQ sauce. BTW, 1 cup of Gouda cheese is about 4 ounces, and 1 cup of red onion using only 1/3 of a medium red onion.

I really enjoyed this recipe. My husband loves BBQ Chicken Pizza. Ive made this several times and I did make a few adjustments to it and found one that really works for us. I use a premade dough for the crust, very convenient. In the sauce I omitted the molasses, and only used a Tbs of brown sugar (it was too sweet for us) and added 2 Tbs. of mustard for a zing. Since my husband doesnt like raw onion, I diced the onion up and tossed it to saute for a few minutes before adding the sauce and cooked chicken, then let it marinate while my crust was par-baking. I only used a small amount of cilantro, maybe a couple of sprigs chopped up, and would definitely say the Gouda makes it. Ive tried it with Mozzarella and Cheddar, and a mix of cheese, and found that the tastes do not compare to the Gouda. Just make sure you dont use too much sauce. If it looks like alot once slathered on, it probably is. Its not like marinara so go easy on it.  Love this! Thanks for the great recipe!

Way too sweet. With the barbecue sauce, you really don't need 1/3 of a cup of brown sugar, molasses, and honey! As written, this gets a 1. Without the added sugared ingredients, gets a 3. Way too much cilantro for a pizza that serves 8. We enjoy barbecued chicken pizza, but definitely this isn't the recipe for us. Thanks anyway.

YUM! My husband and I love this recipe.  We use fresh pizza dough from Trader Joes and cook the chicken in the sauce throughout the day in the slowcooker. By the time you use the sauce, the chicken pieces are infused with the taste of bbq sauce, onions, and cilantro!

Excellent pizza.  My super picky toddlers absolutely tore into this pizza.  I used Jack Daniels Smokehouse BBQ instead of hickory and grilled the chicken on my BBQ.

I hated my pizza.  It could be a good recipe but the BBQ sauce has to be quite mild in taste, possibly even mixed with a marinara. Next time I will definately leave out the liqiud smoke as it only strengthened the overwhelming BBQ taste.  Only enough sauce to barely coat the chicken would be sufficient.  A hard gouda must be used and next time I will also mix the gouda with havarti cheese.  Be prepared to play with this recipe before finding a taste you will like.

This was easy and very yummy. but waaaay to sweet for our taste. i will make BBQ chicken pizza again, but use only the BBQ sauce next time, without the other add-ins. i also added a little colour with some red and yellow peppers.

We enjoyed this!  To make this recipe more appealing to our children, we ommitted the red onion and added a small can of pineapple tidbits-juice removed.  We also substituted Monterey Jack cheese for the Gouda (since that is what we had on hand at the time).  Yummy! SS

This recipe is a little bit sweet and a little bit runny.  I don't think that you need to put all of the sauces on the pizza.  I would also use a different crust.  We used Boboli (? spelling) and I think it would be better with a plain crust.  I will make this again though as it is easy, tasty and the kids loved it.

Made this tonight and my husband said it's better than CPK's BBQ chicken pizza. I added Italian seasonings to my crust dough, sprinkled minced garlic over the top and a bit of parmesan cheese. Heated up a cut up rotiesserie chicken with some Trader Joe's BBQ sauce. I omitted the molasses, honey, etc. Chopped up extra cilantro. Topped with the smoked gouda and a sprinkling of red pepper flakes. Have to say it was the bomb pizza. I honestly do think it's better than CPK! Definitely a keeper and according to my husband, I will be making this often!

I thought this recipe was really good. I changed a couple things like i actually added a can of tomato sauce to the bbq sauce and i didn't use any honey. Overall i liked it and would make it again in a heartbeat.

This was about as good as any bbq pizza that I've ever had. It's better than frozen, at least. The first time I made it I used pillsbury frozen crust, which had a bad flavor/texture, so the next time I made it, I used a premade crust called...mama mary's i think? that made it much better. Oh, and I left out the cilantro the second time, too, because the taste was totally overpowering.

This pizza was delicious! I used a homemade pizza crust and bottled BBQ sauce. I did use smoked gouda and seasoned my chicken breasts with a little sea salt, pepper, garlic powder and oregano. I also used red bell pepper because I couldn't get the other kind. This pizza was terrific, my husband and teenged son loved it. Will definitely make again. Thanks for a great recipe!

Made the dough from scratch, switched out the gouda for a good quality mozzerella, and switched the cilantro for flat leave parsley. Didn't need the sugar, it was sweet enough without it. I also added a little bit of steak sauce to add more tang to the bbq sauce. Essentially I messed around alot with this recipe, but it was delicious that way.

Delicious!  I didn't use cilantro or onions, made my own crust and used mozzarella cheese.  The sauce made this awesome!

Yummy, Yummers!!!  Used pizza dough from Trader Joes and precooked it a bit on my pizza stone.  The shredded smoked gouda didn't really melt, but, still liked the flavor with the rest of ingredients so need to watch that the cheese dosen't get too over-done on pizza.  Next time may cut back on sugar depending on how sweet the b-b-q sauce is.  Still the best B-B-Q pizza I've made!

Really yummy! I used Kraft honey bbq sause and felt I didn't need the extra sweet ingredients (honey, molasses and brown sugar).  To make life easy I bought a rotisserie chicken and used one breast shredded. I lightly fried the onions before I put them on because I can't stand even a hint of raw onion.  I couldn't find smoked gouda so I used smoked gruyer and it was soooooo goooooood!!!!  I have to send about 4 people this recipe!!!!!

This recipe was ok I think mozzerella would've been better than gouda. Our recipe was accompanied by homemade pizza crust and mushrooms. I would definetly do some tweaking to the recipe next time.

The sauce was too sweet in my opinion. Brown sugar, molasses, and honey are in most BBQ sauces. I felt that it was just too much.    Instead of cooking raw chicken, I used meat from a rotisserie chicken and pizza dough rather than the pre-baked crust.

holy moley. this is DELICIOUS! i don't even like chicken bbq pizza, we were just using some leftover chicken and someone mentioned trying it. we did use fresh mozz instead of the gouda and a reg white onion since we had that on hand. GREAT GREAT GREAT! i feel like we could open a pizzeria. Also, we did this on the grill.

I've always steered clear from trying BBQ chicken pizza, I'm glad I finally did--this was amazing! Quite a few changes were made; instead of Gouda, used mozzarella and no molasses was used (according to other reviews). Will use less barbecue sauce next time, maybe 3/4 cup. I was very happy with the way this turned out, I'll definitely be making this again and again.

This was very good, however, I made several changes to it.  I used a store-bought crust and pre-baked it for 8 minutes first.  After reading other reviews, I used less barbeque sauce, less honey and molasses.  I omitted the sugar completely.  While it was simmering, I added 1/4cup of beer.  Very good addition.  Even with cutting down the amount of the sauce however, it was still too much sauce for the pie.  I scaled back the onions as well and used some thinly sliced red bell pepper as well.  Would make again, but would vary it some more and definately work on the sauce.

It was really good. I'm a lover of BBQ Chicken Pizza. Although I gave it only 3 stars because I thought the bbq sauce was way too rich. Next time I think I will tone it down and not use as much. Still a great recipes though.

Whoa... this is absolutely the greatest BBQ chicken pizza I've ever eaten.  My wife and I live in southern California and have eaten it in several pizza joints, including CA Pizza Kitchen... Sammy's Woodfired Pizza Grill... and Cero's... and this truthfully is better than them all, because I control the ingredients and the fat content.  I make pizzas from scratch--and have for 15+ years--and love the fact that this recipe is actually easier than the regular multi-ingredient pizzas I normally make.  I used 2 chicken breasts and cooked them on the George Foreman grill, careful to slightly undercook (knowing the pizza was going into a HOT oven).  I made fresh pizza dough in my bread machine (forget prepared crusts... making it fresh makes all the difference in the world... and is so easy!) I didn't have molasses or honey, so just used the brown sugar, but no more than 1/3 cup as called for.  I sprinkled fresh cilantro on TOP of the pizza when it was done, as cooked cilantro loses much of its flavor.  In addition, I used less gouda, and added some light mozzarella.  Wonderful... and now we have no reason to get ripped off ordering this in a restaurant anymore.  THREE CHEERS FOR NIVOLA FOR POSTING THIS AWESOME RECIPE!!  :-)

Great alternative to traditional pizza!  This recipe turned out perfectly and was super easy.  Started with a thin Boboli pizza crust, and I used some mozzarella and parmesean cheese along with smoked gouda.  Additionally, I sauteed the onions to caramelize them.  The key is to use a really good BBQ Sauce, I used a smoked honey flavor and omitted the honey, molasses, and brown sugar.

I made this and was quite satisfied!  Easy, tasty and looked better than the ones you get in restaurants.  My only problem with it was that it was too sweet.  I would recommend backing off on the sweet ingredients.  Will make again for sure with that modification.

Wowzers!  This BBQ chicken sauce is excellent!  I love BBQ and this is satistying to the tummy!  I made the crust with Jay's signature pizza crust (on this site) and added more brown sugar.  Yum.  The pizza turned out fine, although the BBQ sauce mixture was more runny than spaghetti sauce.  The gouda was tasty, but because of the way it melts, it slightly clumped together and made it harder to cut the pizza.  Maybe waiting a few minutes before eating is an idea, but I just couldn't wait that long!  :)

This pizza was soo good. I always loved ordering BBQ pizza, but this tastes just as good! It was a little messy because the BBQ sauce mix was thin and dripped off the pizza crust. I also used mozzerala instead of gouda cheese.

VERY good pizza.  Just a little too much sauce and sweetness, though.  I would put a little less honey, molasses, and brown sugar than the recipe called for to make it perfect.

My husband thought the high quantity of sauce overpowered the flavor of everything else, but I really liked its tangy flavor.  The pizza looked pretty--like something from a gourmet pizza parlor.  I'll probably make it again, just cut the amount of sauce.

I used Sweet Baby Rays Hickory Brown Sugar BBQ sauce instead of adding molasses and honey and br sugar. I sauted the onion with some garlic before I put it on the pizza. I didn't have frsh cilantro but I sprinkled the chicken with dried cilantro before I cooked it. SUPER Yummy!!! I have made this several times now, sometimes I add other toppings like bacon, tomatos, and mushrooms. Highly recommend!!!!

Pretty good. I used mozz cheese and omitted cilantro all together. Also cooked meat mixture on stove to sort of caramelize it. I'll make it again.

Excellent.  Used a Pillsbury pizza crust in a 12x15 pan, pre-baked for 8 min.  We used Sweet Baby Ray's honey sauce and it had the perfect taste with the other ingredients.

This recipe was very good, will probably make it again when in the mood for California Pizza Kitchen. 

I used a Boboli pizza shell for the crust which is 10 inches diameter, smaller than what is called for.  If you go this route, try cutting back on the chicken and barbeque sauce.  I didn't and the end result was rather soupy.  I halved the honey and brown sugar amounts, and left out the molasses completely.

Another reviewer mentioned the pizza being salty and I agree.  It wasn't noticed while eating the thing, I was just so thirsty the rest of the evening.  It maybe another reason to cut back on the sauce.  Cheese is salty but 1 cup sprinkled on top hardly seems like the culprit in this case.

I boiled a pound of chicken tenders for 15 mins - then shredded.  I used Valentino's Pizza Crust on allrecipes.  I oiled the crust then prebaked for 8 mins on a cornmeal coated pan.  I used 1/2 cup of blue cheese dressing.  I also added some red onion.  It cooked for 12 mins.  We felt it needed some ranch and added a drizzle of it to the cooked pizza.

Too much sauce and WAY too sweet.  I suggest using a hickory/smoked bbq sauce and no additional honey or molasses or sugar.  Good starting point, but just too sweet.

this is a great bbq chicken pizza recipe! We used the kraft hickory bbq sauce which gave a great flavor. Easy to put together and taste is excellent. Will definitely make again!!

I didn't have any Smoked Gouda or red onion, so I used Asiago and Mozzarella, and fresh green onion from my garden. It was YUMMY! I just bought the Smoked Gouda and onion, because it sounds even better that way, but it was terrific even without the right cheese and onion!

This was okay but could definitely be better.  Next time I will not use as much chicken, three pieces is just too much.  The cilantro ruined the whole meal for me.  Also, I would not recommend using Gouda cheese.  It was very hard to sprinkle onto the pizza and it never melted, just kind of burned.  I would only recommend this recipe if modified.

This was very good.  I'd made BBQ pizza before with just plain BBQ sauce but the extra ingredients in this recipe made it taste much closer to the BBQ pizzas we've had in restaurants and the Gouda is the perfect cheese for this pizza

Too sweet, and I even added tomato sauce to the mix and omitted the molasses. On half the pizza I added mushrooms, green pepper, and pepperoni, that was the best part. I will make this pizza again, but with mostly tomato sauce mixed with a bit of bbq, and add all the veggies I have in the fridge.

Use less sugar if you don't want a really sweet sauce.  DO keep the molasses and honey!  Use "Pizza dough I" from allrecipes too!

The sauce was excellent. I started with a brown sugar hickory BBQ sauce, so I only put in 1/4 cup brown sugar. Was very good. My only complaint is that it needed a little less sauce and a little more cheese. Next time I'd mix in about an additional cup of mozarella, as the gouda didn't melt very well.

Awesome recipe!  I used store bought pizza dough from Trader Joe's and pre-grilled the dough on my BBQ grill to get that grill flavor.  I also grilled my chicken.  I didn't use any sugar, honey or molasses as I felt my BBQ sauce was sweet enough.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's. Topped it and finished it in the oven.  It was incredible!  I've made BBQ chicken pizza tons of times but never with gouda which was really the secret to making this pizza the best BBQ chicken pizza. However, I do recommend grilling the chicken and crust.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've been on a pizza kick lately, and this ties the Gourmet Chicken Pizza as my favorite pizza ever. I used frozen bread dough instead of a prebaked crust. I baked the crust naked (the crust, not me) at 425 degrees for 8 minutes, then added the ingredients and baked until done. Husband raved about it too. I can't wait to make it again.

This is my husbands favorite recipe!!  I use bottled hickory smoked BBCue sauce and plan it so I have leftover chicken from another night's meal (usually from a roasted chickenI've made or store bought), chop it up,   and its so easy!  You'll be roasting chickens just so you can make pizza-I guarantee it!!

Very Tasty, but found it a bit too sweet. Used an "original" flavour BBQ sauce, and splurged and got the smoked gouda, but didn't really taste it? Also added some mushrooms and used my own dough recipe.

Delicious but, has too much salt.  Like you may notice in my other reviews, salt is a big issue with me.  I have been avoiding salt in my food ever since my grandfather died in '82 of heart disease.  Many people add salt before they even taste their food.  Go a month without added salt.  When you do add it, you will notice it tremendously.  Don't get me wrong.  Salt is good.  Just don't overdo it like 95% of people do.  I'm not sure where that came from.  Anyway, the recipe deserves to be tried again.

SO EASY! I was looking for a quick dinner recipe for my husband and this fit the bill.  The only thing that I might do differently would be to caramelize the onions since he doesn't like raw onions.  I also bought individual size pizza crusts instead of a large one.

I used a homemade (Valentino's Pizza Crust off this site) pizza crust for this recipe instead of store bought, and cooked it on a pizza stone. If you're using homemade pizza crust, cook for longer. This is excellent served with a crisp green salad and root beer. Also excellent heated up for lunch the next day with some fresh cilantro on the top. Definitely a keeper.

This was delicious!  I used Betty Crocker's pizza dough mix (much cheaper than prepared crust, and still pretty easy).  The cheese didn't melt properly but it didn't matter because it still tasted great.  My guests were very impressed!

This is such a yummy recipe!  Just thinking about it makes me want more!  :)  It's not too sweet (though depending on what kind of bbq sauce you use, it might be sweet than expected), and the cilantro made it wonderful!  I threw on mushrooms too.  Try this, you won't be disappointed!

I liked this recipe except it was just too sweet.  Next time I make it I think I will cut the brown sugar a little because it was too rich and sweet to really enjoy.  I also like this a with a bit of a kick and I thought adding a little hot sauce might do it.

Everything about this recipe is perfect ! 
I didn't end up adding the brown sugar. I used fresh pizza dough (not pre cooked) we love this so so much

I used the basics of this recipe: bbq sauce, chicken, onion & gouda. But we prefer deep dish. So we added a few things: mozzarella, mushrooms & olives. Turned out great, though perhaps a little sweeter than I prefer. When I make it again, I'll reduce the sweeteners.

This is my go to recipe when i need a quick and fabulous meal. i use a bit less sugar and rarely have honey in my kitchen but sometimes i throw in some in golden syrup if i have it. If i'm feeling super keen i'll caramelize the onions first and add a red pepper for colour.  Very Yummy. Oh and i never use the cilantro. Just never had any on hand.

Delicious.  I used jays signature crust, and signature miller and sons barbecue sauce (not hickory), I did not add honey and molasses, and used less brown sugar.  I scaled up the recipe a bit to make a 15" pizza, and probably used 1/4 a cup brown sugar.  I had to use regular onions instead of red because that's what I had.  I used mozzarella, a little Gouda that I had on hand, and sprinkled some barbecue seasoning on top to help the milder cheese pop a little more.

Yum! Didn't have cilantro and I baked six meaty drumsticks in bbq sauce at 350 for 1 hour, then I shredded them and used the dark meat on the pizza. Very flavorful! Used Dinosaur BBQ Sauce. :)

By far my favorite thing to make. I use honey BBQ sauce, cook the chicken in the bacon grease, leave out the vegetables and use cheddar cheese for the topping. I also make homemade crust and use mozzarella cheese sticks to make stuffed crust pizza. The downside is that with making the crust myself and cooking everything it takes about two hours to make but overall, every time I eat it it is completely worth the wait! I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I do!

We really enjoyed this, though I didn't add any sugars to the sauce.  I spread a thin layer of Sweet Baby Ray's sauce (didn't measure) then topped with leftover shredded BBQ chicken from bone-in split breasts (from the freezer).  Then I sprinkled VERY thinly sliced red and green peppers and red onion.  I added a couple splashes of tabasco and crushed red pepper and pepper rings on my part of the pizza-I like spicy!  Used smoked gouda and zesty cheddar cheese curds (I read that they melt well and happened to see them at the store when I was lookng for the Gouda)...it was wonderful!  Also I brushed olive oil onto the crust and topped with the canned romano cheese for added flavor.  Didn't do cilantro because I'm not a fan of the herb.  Served with corn on the cob and a cucumber/carrot salad.

Hey - this is a delicious recipe and unless you are a picky eater who is afraid of trying new things I really think you'll love it. I carmelized some red onions, roasted some garlic, and used mozz cheese (extra). After the chicken was cooked I mixed it with the sauce and let it simmer while I made the other ingredients. I added a can of crushed pineapple. You can tweak the toppings as much as you like - I used that pillsbury pizza dough (it wasn't my favorite but was still delicious. My fiancee took one bite and almost set down his fork as he said "the flavors were so amazing I almost couldn't take it!" He then proceeded to wipe out the pizza!I didn't add ANYTHING to the sauce and used Famous Daves sweet and zesty.

This is the closest recipe I've found to that Cali pizza place! Whatever u do, don't omit the cilantro, it's the touch most BBQ pizzas are missing. P.S. Made my own dough though mixed with a ton of italian seasoning. Yum!

I've made this a few times and have simplified it to the sauce, chicken, onions and cheese (I've used various kinds).  It's so simple and has become one of our favorite pizza recipes.

A perfect marriage of BBQ + Pizza! (probably would be even better grilled, maybe?) We LOVED this - TOTALLY cured our craving for BBQ and I got to use up leftover chicken. I used Pillsbury pizza dough;  Didn't have honey or molasses on hand, so I just used another 1/8c of brown sugar. I didn't have Gouda so I used regular mozzarella, though I am sure with this pizza Gouda would have been better! The cilantro and red onions are fabulous. The one recommendation I have is to heat and whisk the bbq sauce, brown sugar, molasses, and honey thoroughly together, and then add the chicken and onions. Heat through until steaming. Then place the mixture on the pizza dough, top with cilantro, then the cheese...and VOILA! Good stuff!

While slight changes to the sauce amount could really make this recipe great, I have to give it only 3 stars because the way it is was not fantastic.  Too much sauce - you couldn't taste the meat, cheese, or onions.  We used leftover smoked turkey - it would have been fantastic without so much sauce.  I believe I'll submit my own version of this.

We had alot more leftovers then we would have if we'd made traditional peperroni pizza. My family thought it was wayyyy too sweet. I would cut down the brown sugar ALOT. Will not be making again, it tasted like dessert.

I loved it and the only thing I changed is I used mozzerella. As for the crust, I did buy a pre made crust I just put it directly on the rack and it came out nice and crisp. Super yummy!

Great basic BBQ chicken recipe that works even without these specific ingredients. I like the grown-up types of pizzas and this one would definitely be good to serve adults. I used my back pocket homemade pizza crust (which is gluten free) and did not need to pre-bake it. I didn't have the molasses, cilantro or gouda cheese, so I left out the 2 former ingredients and substituted mozzarella and a touch of cheddar for the latter. Oh, I also used white onions instead of the red as I didn't have those either. A homemade BBQ sauce might be fun to try next time. I'll also pick up the gouda cheese for another go at this recipe. This keeps well in the fridge for lunches!

This was really yummy.  I did use a store bought crust which was horrible b/c it was hard as a brick.  next time, I will make my own crust.  I used Kraft Honey BBQ sauce and left out the honey and molasses.  And i just used a white onion b/c that is all i had.  Good recipe.

Very easy and definitely good enough to give California Pizza Oven a run for their money.  I used a homemade crust and thought it made all the difference, but your family's preference is entirely your business.  :)  Enjoy!

I made this pizza quite healthy using a whole wheat pita bread as the crust and no cheese. I just toasted it for 3 minutes before adding the topping. I also added garlic to the chicken, BBQ sauce mix and took out the molasses. I added pepper flakes and dipped in balsamic while eating. yum!

I modified this a bit based on previous reviews, but the results were excellent.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory and Brown Sugar sauce and mixed in one tbsp. of honey and one-and-a-half tablespoons of brown sugar.  I marinated the chicken breasts in milk and one tbsp. of vinegar, and I julienned one red bell pepper.  I heated olive oil over medium heat in a skillet and sauteed the pepper and some minced garlic for a couple of minutes.  After I removed the pepper from the skillet, I added the chicken and cooked it in the olive oil.  I then shredded it with my hands and returned it to the skillet with the sauce, allowing it to boil before reducing the heat to a simmer, and finally adding it onto the crust (I used a premade three cheese crust, Archer Farms brand from Target).  I used a blend of cheeses designed for pizza which included mozzarella, and I tossed it with the sliced peppers and some baby spinach leaves I tore with my hands before topping the chicken mixture with it.  It was an excellent pizza and I will certainly make it again.  Thank you for sharing your recipe, and thank you to all reviewers for your tips... it truly helps!

LOVE this.  Cooked chicken in olive oil with a tad of the bbq sauce, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper, until cooked.  (We need flavor everywhere!)  Also used the Pillsbury thin crust.  Did not used hickory/smoked anything, due to convenience, but still tasted awesome.  Would reduce sugar next time to suite husband's tastes.

This was fantastic!  I made Jay's Signature Pizza Crust for this.  Didn't use cilantro or Gouda.  I added diced bacon (like they do at Papa John's) and used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce and a pizza cheese blend.  I baked chicken tenders in foil sprinkled with Grill Mates Mesquite seasoning, then diced the chicken and simmered in the sauce while I waited for the pizza dough to rise.  This was seriously the best BBQ chicken pizza I have ever had!

VERY GOOD! The Gouda cheese does melt and is very good on the pizza as well. I follow everything on the recipe and for me it was delicous! I used pre-made Pilsbury pizza dough and cooked for 7 minutes first then added the toppings as suggested by another user and it turned out delicous! Thank you very much for sharing.

You should definitely use mozzarella and not Gouda, the Gouda did not melt down at all.

STOP! You must get 2 meals for one with this....Night #1 Make the "Tender Barbecued Chicken" from this site with chicken breasts and serve with Sun Dried Tomato wraps. Night #2 use the left over chicken to make this pizza.  (Cilantro and Jalapenos go well with both wrap and pizza)

I loved this! I did make a few changes based on reviews and what I had on hand, but I did try to keep as close to the original as possible. I used hickory BBQ sauce as the recipe suggested, added the molasses and honey and then added brown sugar to taste. I probably added 2 to 3 tablespoons. I wouldn't suggest leaving out the molasses or honey as I found they added a unique flavour that made the sauce taste so good. I used about a tablespoon of cilantro, and that was the perfect amount for us. You could taste it, but it wasn't overpowering. I used all the sauce and I didn't find it was too much like a lot of other reviewers did. Finally, topped with a combination of mozza and chedder because I forgot to buy the gouda. We really loved this pizza and plan to make it often.

Awesome- tastes exactly like CPK. I did actually use a honey barbeque sauce so I did not add the additional sweetness and it was plenty sweet. I mixed half of the cilantro into the sauce and sprinkled half of it on top. I used cheeses I had on hand, which ended up being some colby-jack and mozzarella. I would eat this every week if I could!

I spread my premade pizza dough over a cookie sheet.  I substituted the honey and molasses for agave nectar (what I had).  In mixing the chicken with the bbq sauce it was hard to spread evenly.  Next time I will do the chicken separate from the sauce for that size.  My crust didn't crisp in the middle but it was all good.  I used 2 cups of mozzy cheese and omitted the cilantro.  My BBQ chicken pizza hating husband LOVED it, as did everyone else.  Thanks!

I made this for my husband and he LOVED it!  He said it was as good as any BBQ chicken pizza he's ever ordered in a restaurant.  I used the bbq chicken from "Zesty Slow Cooker Chicken BBQ" on this site, Boboli crust, and mozzerella cheese and he said it was great.  Will definitely make again!

My husband and I liked this a lot. The kids weren't so crazy about it. I did half with mozzarella and half with gouda to compare the tastes. The gouda was definitely a better taste--the smokiness counteracted the sweetness of the sauce--but the mozzarella was good too, and definitely cheaper. I also forgot to add the cilantro to the sauce, so I threw it on top at the end. Will have to try it in the sauce next time.

For a change of pace, I made this in place of our weekly 'traditional' pizza. 
It sounded good, but after reading some of the reviews I decided to make only 3/4 of the sauce to make it less sloppy. It worked out really nicely. We really enjoyed this pizza and will certainly be making it again!
I didn't anticipate that the kids would love it though! My preschooler couldn't stop raving about how gooooood it was!!!

This came out really good, everyone loved it!  I was careful to get just Hickory BBQ sauce instead of Hickory Brown Sugar BBQ sauce, which I think was important in not making this too sweet.  Also, I think the smoked Gouda really is important to balance out flavor over another cheese.    I used about half the onion and only a small fraction of the cilantro that was called for and added a little red pepper.  I substituted maple syrup for the molasses because it was what I had.  I will definitely make this again.

I use this same recipe except instead of mixing in the cilantro, I put it fresh on the top.  Also, I use mozzarella cheese all over the pizza and then put small strips of smoked gouda on top of that.  Finally, I just use a barbeque sauce and put that directly as the sauce, I like using this hickory one at the grocery store.

It's been about a week since I made the pizza.  I was so disappointed that I didn't bother rating the recipe until now.  The cilantro ruined the pizza.  I don't really know what measurement a "half a bunch" is but I used the "half a bunch" I bought and it was WAY too much. You couldn't taste the BBQ, the chicken, or anything!  Just cilantro! (& I LOVE cilantro!) So, the next time I make this recipe, there will be little to no cilantro.

I have made this recipe over the years, and I prefer the Boboli crust that you find in the market.  Or, if you do make your own crust, make it thicker, so that it can hold the sauce.  I don't add extra sugar to the barbecue sauce; you can purchase honey-based brands which are plenty sweet.

This is a really great recipe. I've made it several times. I didn't give it 5 stars b/c I always end up eating it with a fork. Too messy to pick up and eat normal pizza style. But tastes good. Good the next day too.

I thought that it was excellent with a couple of changes. I used less BBQ sauce and a very mild brand. I would also use  more gouda cheese next time.

Excellent!  Tastes just like the local restaurants.  I omitted the onion,used mozerella instead of Gouda and used dried cilantro. I cooked the "sauce" in the slow cooker with the chicken.  Then I poured some of the sauce on the crust, topped with shredded chicken, added a little more sauce and the rest of the toppings.  Delicious!

Excellent! I used Jay's Signature Pizza Crust, and it was enough for 2 10-inch crusts. I pre-baked each crust for 5 min. The ingredients in this recipe were just enough for two pizzas- but if you do 1 pizza, I agree with other reviewers there would have been too much sauce. I used Rudy's BBQ sauce from Texas (the best BBQ sauce EVER). The cilantro was an excellent addition- don't leave it out! (Though I could be in a "Cilantro Addicts Anonymous" group). Excellent, excellent recipe- Thanks!

Not very good at all!  The sauce was way too sweet and runny.  It overpowered all of the other flavors.  I don't think you need to add molasses, brown sugar and honey to the BBQ sauce.  My husband and I also felt that this was way too much sauce for a 12" pizza.  Even though I used almost a whole block of smoked gouda,  we could not taste the cheese.  Maybe try a stronger tasting cheese?  I would also suggest cutting back on the amount of cilantro.

so I wasn't too excited about this recipe...but...I also made a few mistakes so I still gave 4 stars because it has potential. The sauce was too sweet for my likes. Also I like to have more a cilantro bang and would have preferred to add cilantro to the top before serving. I made the mistake of using reduced fat gouda, never thinking it would not at all melt so that's my issue. go for full fat, worth it.  I will try again but maybe not add the brown sugar.

Hubby and I both agreed this was a very tasty flavorful pizza, I Used Becki's oven barbecue chicken recipe to make my chicken and skipped the sauce in this but added a tsp of hickory smoke flavoring and still added the rest. I did use dried cilantro and only sprinkled a little on just before adding the cheese since i am not fond of cilantro. I added a little shredded mozzarella on this too. Great pizza and we loved this!

This was pretty good but I think my problem was the sauce was way too sweet. I think a different kind of BBQ sauce would be better for me on a pizza. To counter act the sweetness of the sauce (I didn't add molasses it was enough without) I used pepper jack cheese slices instead which were fantastic. I think I'm going to try a mexican piza next. Still looking for a dough that is easy to work with.

This pizza is an exercise in kick-you-in-the-teeth  flavors combating.  I would lessen the cilantro, lessen the BBQ sauce because it made the sauce too runny, and reduce both the sugar and the honey.  I won't make this again.

This was UNBELIEVEABLY delicious. Fairly quick and easy to prepare, and comes out absolutely amazing. Tastes just like BBQ pizza you get at restaurants.

I'm sorry to say, but the sauce was way too sweet eventhough I had cut back on the sugar & molasses. Too much sauce was left over. You can atleast cut the amount by half and still be okay with the amount needed. I love BBQ pizza, but, sorry to say, not this recipe.

Chalk this one up to another hit for my family!  This one was great although I agree with many of the reviewers to cut back on the honey and molasses.  I omitted the cilantro and used mozarella cheese and bacon.  Absolutely fantastic, will make this one again for sure!!!

Although I liked the flavor of the cilantro on this pizza, I thought the sauce was too sweet.  I would cut back on the sugar and honey quite a bit.  I like my BBQ sauce to be bold and tangy!

Way too sweet. I would cut back on BBQ sauce, molasses and sugar. Way too much sauce, it drowned out the flavor of all other ingredients.

We loved this.  We did not use the red onions, and substituted shredded italian cheese for the gouda...just because we young kids and thought it would go over better.  They still were just ok with it, but the adults loved it!  So easy...used leftover chicken from the weekend roast.  Awesome.  I want to try it now with the Gouda and the onions!

Very, very good! Cut back on the brown sugar, used only 2 tbsp...still plenty of sweetness! Left out the cilantro, (after all these years I am still not sure what to make of that stuff!).I also shredded the chicken instead of cubing. Enjoyed by all, thanks Nivola!

I really loved this recipe.  My kids however, did not care for the cilantro or the onions.  Next time I will leave out both and I am sure it will be a hit! I think I will try it with pineapple tidbits also. I give it three stars because I will have to change the recipe to make it a "WOW".

We used fresh dough, mozzerella cheese (because that was what I had on hand) and less brown sugar.  This was a big hit with my kids.  I really liked it also.  I made two one w/onions and one w/o.  The one with onions was much better, something about the combination really worked.   Thanks for the recipe.

This was great.  I didn't put very much sauce at all (and I used a good store-bought BBQ sauce), added some chili powder and pepper.  I used monterey/cheddar mix for cheese topping.  Yum.

This was interesting.  I used homemade bbq sauce and Jay's signature pizza crust(from this site) and it was surprisingly good!  Fiance was skeptical, but glad we tried this.  This will be made again for something unique and different.

Not for diabetics! OHHMYGOSH this is sweet.  I'll try it again maybe without the brown sugar, honey and molasses.  I also didn't like the gouda, I couldn't taste it.  Maybe because the sauce was so sweet.

This recipe was very unique which was nice, however, it really wasn't all that good.  The sauce was really runny which made it extremely hard to eat.  The cilantro was good in it but it all didn't seem to mesh too well.

This came out terrible.  I used too much cilantro because I didn't know what "half a bunch" was.  But even with the correct amount of cilantro, I still don't think it would have been very good.  We threw it in the garbage.

I made this for my husband's birthday along with several other types of pizza. This one was the most raved about. However, I did have more sauce than I needed, so I just saved it for the next one!

This was such a good pizza. My family really enjoyed it. I would only change one thing and that is using a little less brown sugar. It was just a bit too sweet. I will be making this pizza again really soon. Thanks for the great recipe!

This makes a great pizza! However, we find it a little too sweet, so we reduced the brown sugar to a couple spoonfuls. I think it also depends upon the brand of BBQ sauce used since some have more sugar than others. Great way to use up left over turkey!!

I loved this pizza.  My husband gets BBQ pizza all the time for lunch from a pizza shop and he liked this better.  The only thing I did different was make my own crust but I am sure it is good and quicker with a premade crust.

My dad makes this for me and he uses home made crust.  I didn't and I really didn't like this, but everyone else loved it.  Maybe it's the crust?

This is an excellent pizza.  My husband and I both enjoyed it and the leftovers were great the next day for lunch.  I will definitely make this again.  I may add the cheese a bit later in the baking process, as the Gouda seemed a bit dried out by the time the pizza was finished baking.  Other than that -- this is a keeper!

Used most of this recipe and couldn’t fine Gouda cheese so used Munster and added pineapple chunks to it. Also done a home made dough and cooked in a cast iron skillet. Came out great, all the guys at the fire house bragged about it later

The flavors where good but a little overpowering so I read the comments and made some adjustments and wow what a difference :) next time I want to make it with homemade pizza dough instead of the premade didn't care for it at all

First the two weeks: I used Jack Daniels barbecue sauce pre-cooked chicken strips, fresh Serano pepper's two of them, and an extra sharp white cheddar cheese. Oh, and also a half I had a finely chopped cilantro other than that I follow the instructions and it was epic I took a picture of it I don't know where it is :-) you should definitely make this

So I followed the advice of many of the other reviewers and bypassed the honey, molasses and brown sugar but  found a barbecue sauce (Hunt's honey hickory) that  was a worthy substitute.  Also, I did saute the onions in garlic for a bit just enough to soften  them up and cut back on the cilantro.  Lastly, I used a pre-made crust in the interest of time.  Personally, I don't like drowning my food in flavor or condiments.  This had just the right amount to appeal to everyone.  The crust was fine but I can see where dough made from scratch could really make this recipe pop.  This dish was just as pleasing visually as it was to the taste buds.

I've made this a few times, and the only change I make is to add a few more veggies, usually bell peppers, jalapeños, or banana peppers.  The sauce is great, and the gouda is a must (I've even used deli sliced gouda!). Also, we don't eat meat, so I just use the "chickenless" patties which work just fine!

Only reason I am giving this 4 stars is because I cut the brown sugar down to 2 tablespoons (and it was still a little too sweet).  Other than that, this recipe is great.  I used leftover Charcoal Grilled Chicken  and substituted molasses for another tablespoon of honey. This was a family favorite and will make again and again!

This was the best BBQ Chicken Pizza I have had.  I omitted the molasses and cilantro and it still came out great!  I used mozzarella cheese because that is what I had on hand.  It was so good we are having it again this weekend!!!

After making this, I had wished that I had read the other reviews.  I rated this as a 4 because of all the changes I will make the next time.  Use 1/4 cup store bought BBQ sauce (I used BullsEye).  Omit the sugar and molasses and use your favorite cheese.  Next time I might use a combination of mozzarella and gouda.  Thank you for a tasty meal that was quick and easy!

This was so good.  I bought a hickory sauce with brown sugar in it, so we only put a pinch of brown sugar.  We also left out the molasses.  We used mozzerella instead of Gouda and added yellow pepper as well.  This was awesome.

This was a wonderful recipe. I made my own dough and grilled the pizza, it tasted like it was from a restaurant. I think it was the grill that made all the difference in the world. I used the pizza dough from the grilled pizza recipe on this site. Don't change a thing, it is delicious; I think it would even be great on a pizza made in the oven....

My DH and I really liked this pizza and would give it more than 5 stars if we could.  We left out the molasses and cilantro and only used 1/4C brown sugar and 2 chicken breasts (we baked them).  We also used Fatboys Hogwash BBQ sauce.  What a great recipe - it is one we will make again!

I was afraid of it being too sweet, so I just added a smattering of brown sugar. This was still too much sweet (and I like sweet!) and didn't taste good at all.

I bought uncooked whole wheat dough from the deli, froze it, and thawed it and rolled it out for this pizza. I didn't cook it ahead of time, but it didn't matter. I do suggest to everyone to HEAT YOUR PIZZA STONE if you're using one. It helps everything move faster. And keeps the dough from sticking.

This really is a very good recipe. Quite easy and delicious. My DH liked it a lot. I added some salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning to balance the sweetness and cut back on the cilantro, which can be very strong, and I cheated on the cheese because I couldn't find Gouda. Mozzarella works just fine. Will totally make again, thanks Nivola for the great recipe!

This was INCREDIBLY sweet. I would leave out the sugar, molasses, and honey next time and simply find a really good bbq sauce. I doubled the sauce, made a homemade crust, and used lots of cilantro, and it was great other than the over powering sweetness.

Great Recipe.  I made miniature versions of this pizza for a cocktail party and they were delicious. I did sub Monterey Jack for the Gouda with great result.

Very rich. But if you like barbecue sauce, very good. I would probably follow a VERY similar recipe, but go with a bit less bbq sauce next time!

Made this tonight, and it was really good!  I didn't have molasses or cilantro, but it didn't matter.  I simmered the chicken in the BBQ sauce (with a little bit of broth) for a few hours on low... which made the chicken nice and tender.  Tasted a lot like the CPK version.

incredibly simple to make.  I used a boboli pizza shell.  I did not add the honey, molasses, or brown sugar to the bbq sauce.  I just used the bbq sauce straight from the bottle (sweet baby rays) on to the crust.  Next I added the cooked, diced chicken.  I also used mozarella cheese (because that is what we had on hand), then the purple onion and cilantro.  Highly recommended for it's simplicity.  Very tastey!

This was SO easy and so delicious. I used a Boboli pre-packaged pizza crust, and it turned out amazing. Next time, I'll definitely leave out the honey, as it was a little too sweet for me. Also, I used 1/2 mozz and 1/2 gouda as someone else suggested. Very nice!

I thought this was way too sweet - and I didn't even add the honey or molasses! I would use normal bbq sauce and just a pinch of brown sugar!

I have made this twice now and I've greatly enjoyed it both times. It's incredibly simple to make, even at last-minute. I cut back on the cilantro and a bit of the sweetness, but that's simply personal preference. Highly recommended for it's simplicity to tastiness ratio. Thank you very much!

Very good pizza! The hubs says this is a keeper. Did some changes as this is what I had on hand. Used leftover smoked chicken, budweiser smokehouse bbq sauce, sweet onion, and mexican cheese blend. Aslo used a refrigerated pizza dough that I prebaked.

I may have done something wrong, but I had WAY too much sauce.  I would either cut back or be sure to only put on only what you need, not the whole thing!  Also, I agree with some of the other reviewers that the gouda does not melt well at all.  I would definitely add some mozzarella to hold everything together.

This was GREAT!MY whole family kept saying how it was so good & we agree, it is just as good as the bbq pizza at the restaurant. I made the sauce basically according to the recipe, just omitted the molasses and cilantro. It makes the perfect amount of sauce for 2 pizzas so i'm sure it is too much sauce for 1 pizza as others keep saying in the reviews. Instead of Gouda, used 2 cups per pizza of mont jack/colby shredded & i put a handful of cooked/chopped bacon on each pizza. It was fabulous & will definitely make again as it was very tasty & easy!

It was okay.  The BBQ was way too sweet, and the "bunch" of cilantro a little vague.

This pizza was very good and my whole family liked it. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of the full 5 is because I wasn't too crazy about the amount of sauce it produced. It was a little much and too sweet for my taste but otherwise it was good!

I used a pre-made pizza crust.  I also used a mixture of half mozzerella cheese and half monteray jack cheese.  This was very good.

This recipe was delicious!  I also prebaked the Pillsbury crust for about 7 minutes.  While baking I fried 2 thin boneless skinless chicken breasts in olive oil.  Cut it into chunks, threw it into a food processor, pulsed a few times.  Tossed in BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Rays).  I put a little olive oil on the crust, spread mozzerella, monterey jack, and cheddar grated cheeses all over, added BBQ chicken, diced red onions, chopped cilantro (only about 3 leaves which is PLENTY), and chopped bacon!!  My boyfriend loved it and told me with each bite!  I will definitely make again!!!

My husband and I love this excellent recipe. Like most people, I did make a few changes. I omitted the honey and molasses. I also cooked and cubed the chicken, but I did not boil it with the other ingredients. I simply spread the sauce on the pizza crust, then added the rest. I  use the Italian 5 cheese instead of the Gouda. The best way to make any pizza is to use the "Jay's Signature Pizza Crust" from these recipes as well. Try and enjoy!

I didn't use any of the measurements from this recipe.  Instead, I just eyeballed the ingredients based on the size of my crust.  I halved the recipe for Jay's Signature Pizza Crust from this website to make one medium crust.  I used precooked chicken strips, chopped red onion, cilantro, and a blend of mozzarella, cheddar, and Monterey Jack cheese.  For the sauce, I used 1/2 cup of Tony Roma's BBQ sauce mixed with about 1 1/2 tablespoons of brown sugar.  Again, I just mixed some sugar in and tasted the sauce until it was just right.  The amount of brown sugar is going to vary depending on which sauce you use.  I found the Tony Roma's BBQ sauce to be a little too tangy and runny for the purposes of a pizza sauce.  I'm going to keep experimenting with different sauces.  But overall, this recipe is a good combination of ingredients for a BBQ chicken pizza.  My family enjoyed it immensely.  I'll definitely be using this recipe again.

Is this a dessert pizza? WAY TOO SWEET! I am upset because I have been wanting to make this for a very long time and I finally did and it was too sweet to eat. I was scared I was going to go into a comatose state from too much sugar. My teeth hurt thinking about it. I would recommend modifying the brown sugar for sure and maybe even a few other ingredients and then you would have a perfect pizza!

Even without the honey and molasses, this recipe was wayyyyyyyy too sweet. I also used a white onion and used mozzerella cheese.  For the crust I used a generic dry pizza crust that you add water to and cooked it for about 8 minutes.  If I ever make it again I will cut back on the brown sugar at least by half. If not for the sweetness, it would of been a great pizza.

Outstanding.  Next time, I would add extra red onions.  It had a GREAT flavor. Made several pizzas up and froze them--they too turned out great later.

This was very good. My little daughter who doesn't eat anything of course picked at it...but all my other children liked it. I think for less picky eaters..peppers and even maybe pineapple would taste good. I just sliced my chicken thin and browned it in olive oil with a lil garlic powder and onion powder. Also I brushed on a thin layer of BBQ sauce on the crust and also used some mozzerella cheese as well. I will make this again.

This is more like 4.5 stars. I enjoyed it. I just used some left over BBQ chicken we had and store bought BBQ sauce. Couldn't find the Gouda so we got pizza cheese, mozzarella, and asiago. I didn't use a half a bunch of cilantro, just enough to cover the pizza and have a little in every bit, but I'll probably cut back even more on it, because even though I liked it, I thought it was strong, and I burped it all night :( This pizza is a good change of pace from the normal. Will make again.

I really didn't think I was going to like this, but it was great!  I just used a bottle of thick and spicy flavored with brown sugar bbq sauce and it was perfect, not too sweet, not too spicy.  I do salt my pizzas  when I bake them from scratch, just to enhance the flavor.

I loved this recipe!  The combination of sweet bbq sauce with red onions and cilantro was very good.  Unfortunately my kids weren't crazy about it, but they may have to suffer through every now and then so I can have it again!!

Love this recipe. We like to use a pizza crust from the refrig dough section and make it on the grill. Just spray one side with olive oil Pam, put on grill for 3-5 minutes, turn and place toppings on crust. Grill for another 3-5 min or until cheese is melted.

The smoked gouda makes this recipe, IMO. Yum!

This isn't too bad.  I'm not a big bbq sauce fan, but bf likes it so occasionally I try to make things with it.  I also had leftover chicken, so I thought I'd try this.  Very simple, and I made my own dough with the Pizza Dough II from AR.  I eliminated the brown sugar and used dried minced onion in place of onions.  I'm glad I eliminated the brown sugar, bc it's plenty sweet enough without it.  Bf really liked it.  Thanks for sharing.

Along with a spiced up version of Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce (from this site), this pizza has made our house pizza crazy. To make this offensively decadent, double the chicken.

This is a Huge favorite in our house. I simplify it by using best yet honey bbq sauce instead of making my own. Plus I marinate the chicken in the same sauce. SO good.

This recipe is good! but next time I would cut down on the bbq sauce because it was too salty and I also thought it was fine when I left out the molasses. I also only put in one teaspoon of honey instead of a table spoon.

I made this for my B/f & I we loved it we used Kraft Honey Barbecue Sauce & I chose to use  mozarella & provalone shredded cheese. I ommitted the red onions due to family prefrence. Anyway overall was very filling. Definately going to be a favorite of our family.

I just finished eating this pizza, so I figured I'd better review before I forgot about it.  I didn't use molasses or brown sugar, and we found the sauce to be plenty sweet.  Actually I thought there was too much sauce.  But the taste was good, so next time we'll just use less of it.  Otherwise, this is a great recipe that we'll use over and over.

Great recipe.  I used a spicy chipotle sauce and I always make my pizza on mini whole wheat pitas.  Just toast them in the oven a few minutes before you put toppings on them.

Very easy to make and delicious. I did put a little cilantro in the sauce but the rest I put on top of the pizza after I took it out of the oven. I also marinated the chicken in BBQ sauce before cooking it in the oven.

this was a very tasty recipe. i followed it exactly except i left out the onions, it still tasted great.  i had a really terrible pre-baked crust that was too small and really thin, so the pizza was really messy and there was a lot of extra sauce. my advice would be to pick out a large, thick pre-baked crust!

I really enjoyed the flavour of this pizza.  I couldn't find molasses so used golden syrup and I think cilantro must be out of season.  I also did my dough in the bread maker. Very good, would definately do again.

This was the first time I've made homemade pizza and this was totally awesome! My family loved it! I didn't have cilantro, but used Italian herb seasoning instead and skipped the molasses and used a six cheese mixture that includes jalapeno's. Awwwwhhhh!

This tasted really good, but in my opinion, it calls for way too much barbeque sauce.  Our pizza was really messy and ended up dripping all over our plates.  I didn't have cilantro, so I omitted it, and it was still good that way.  I think it was good enough to try again, with much less sauce.

I liked this a lot but only gave it four stars because of the changes I made. I used the tube dough, prebaked, which was okay but next time I'll make my own. I sauteed red pepper, red onion, and mushrooms first. I only used 1/2 cup of bbq sauce and none of the brown sugar or molasses. I used colby jack cheese on top. Thanks for the recipe.

this BBQ chicken pizza was great! I used a whole wheat pizza dough and I think next time I will stick with a more traditional oizza dough. Other wise this recipe was great! I would add more cilantro next time! This is something I will continue to make again!

We love this recipe and make it often! I’ve experimented a little by adding a thin layer of goat cheese to the crust before I put on the BBQ chicken. We also use mozzarella cheese instead of smoked Gouda. Leftover BBQ chicken tastes GREAT on a French roll!

My husband and I love this pizza. The smoked gouda and cilantro make it excellent. For a healthier option, we made personal pizzas on whole wheat pita bread for a crispy crust and baked on a cookie sheet at 400 degrees for 15 minutes. Came out perfect!

This was really good but can only eat so much before it gets overwhelming.  I used some boiled chicken and Kraft's original barbeque sauce.  For the crust I used thawed frozen bread dough -- baked for half the time then added toppings to prevent cheese from burning.

This is one of the best BBQ chicken pizzas I have had. I omitted the molasses (because I did not have any) and added 1/2 tsp of dried cilantro instead of fresh. Also, I sprinkled some mozzarella cheese on top. I need to find a better pizza crust (I used a store brand one). Tasty! And picture perfect!

I'm a bbq chicken pizza fanatic, and this is now my go to recipe - by far the best on this site. We like it with colby jack & cheddar cheese. Try not to overload the crust with sauce.

Tastes exactly like the pizza I get from my favorite pizza place!  It looks gorgeous coming out of the oven.  I made it for my roommates and they were so impressed that they even cleaned up the dishes afterward.  This is a great starter recipe that can easily be adjusted to suit individual tastes.  The crust and the sauce are the most important parts--I used an easy homemade pizza crust recipe instead of storebought (worth the extra time), and used Stubbs BBQ sauce.  I would add the honey, molasses, and sugar to the sauce a little at a time and taste after each addition to avoid oversweetening it.  Also, next time I don't think I'll use quite as much cilantro as called for.  I used mozzarella instead of Gouda, and it tasted fabulous.  Will definitely make  again!

I thought this was pretty good, although I had to make more than the recipe called for because I used a pillsbury crust which made a cookie sheet sized pizza.  It ended up a little too saucy, but it wasn't too bad for pizza made at home!

FABULOUS. I used a honey roasted garlic sauce, so reduced the honey and brown sugar just a hair.  Gouda is the perfect flavor, but added about 1/4 cup (maybe little less) mozarella because I like lots of cheese.  The onions carmelized beautifully and the second time I cooked this I even added a few more than called for.

Absolutely loved this pizza! Hubby said it was the best he'd ever had!  We left out the molassas and honey, but did use the exact amount of brown sugar.  I also substituted Mozzerella for the gouda, not sure if he would like that.  Followed the directions and then sprinkled a little extra cilantro on top right before serving.  It was delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

This was really good! I did seem to use a little less of everything, though. I started with a Boboli crust (next time I will try to make my own because Boboli isn't great). I mixed equal parts Boboli pizza sauce with Tony Roma's barbeque sauce and spread it on the pizza. Then I halfway buried some sliced red onions in the sauce because the bf would freak out if there were visible onions on his pizza :) Then I partially defrosted some grilled chicken breast strips (Costco size bag I needed to use up!), sliced/shredded them, and cooked on medium with only enough barbeque sauce to coat all the pieces (put a lid on the pan) and some brown sugar. I put 3/4 of the chicken over the onions, added the cheese (2/3 mozzarella, 1/3 gouda), the rest of the chicken, then cilantro because I'm dumb and didn't read the part where it goes in the sauce. Next time I will put part in the sauce, and sprinkle with cilantro after baking. Thanks for an awesome recipe that I could adjust to my tastes without messing it up :)

I used pre-made refigerated pizza crust dough and followed the instructions on the can.  I also left out the cilantro and mollases and used less brown sugar.  It turned out good and was not too sweet.

We were disappointed with this recipe.  I left out the the molasses and we still felt it was too sweet.  Also,  the flavor of the cilantro and bbq sauce were a bit overpowering.  I am glad I tried it, but I don't think I would make this again.

This was quite good!  My kids liked it too, which is a big plus!  
I added sliced dill pickles to part of it for me.  I love pickles on pizza!

Delicious recipe... i used honey barbecue sauce so i left out the molasses and brown sugar to take down the sweet factor.

I really enjoyed this recipe, and it was soooo good.  I made it for a potluck, and all my friends enjoyed it too.  I listened to other peoples comments and I omitted the brown sugar and molasses, and the sauce came out just fine.  I didn't believe that it was too saucy either, but maybe because I had spread it on a 13 x 17 jelly roll pan pizza.  I made a Sicilian pizza crust, and it was awesome.  Do try this recipe.

Great taste.  I used less brown sugar and it was still sweet.  Next time I don't think I'll use any.  There was a bit too much sauce in general, but overall, a good recipe.

Very tastey.  Just a little too saucey to give it 5 stars.  Next time, I'll cut back on the amount of BBQ sauce.
