This was really good and easy, but I would reccemend beating the cream cheese first and seperately, then adding the sour cream.  I just plopped it all together and the cream cheese clumped up into small balls.  If you beat it first it will smooth it out.

I love this recipe and have been using it forever!!!  Everyone raves about it!!  I don't use lettuce and green pepper in mine though.  I always make sure the cream cheese is very soft and I mix the cream cheese with a beater first, then add the sour cream and a envelope of taco seasoning and some cayenne.  On top of the sour cream/cream cheese mixture I layer salsa, taco cheese, tomatoes, and black olives.  It's fantastic!

I have made this for my kids for years and even now that they're young adults it remains a favorite with them--you just can't get enough of this stuff. I vary this slightly, using only 8 ounces of full-fat sour cream.  I also use chopped green onion rather than green pepper.  This time I got smart and made a double recipe!

I was excited to see this ,because I tried to submit one similar to this about 7 mo. ago with no luck ,and it is outstanding. I have been making it for years.I never ever come home with any left, people crowd around this dip until it is gone! The only difference with my recipe is I use 8 oz. sour cream(reg)and taco mix. Blend my softened cream cheese mixture with a couple tablespoons of Old El Paso taco sauce. I spread in a pizza pan. Then put some more taco sauce on top of cream cheese layer. I don't measure anything. I do it by judgement but I use only 1 tomato. Top with shredded lettuce, tomato and cheese. I don't use pepper or olives. If you want to kick it up a couple notches, add pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar and add some fresh sliced jalapenos to the top. Whew we is it good!! Daughters friends had it here for the first time and said it was the best dip they ever tasted! I don't toast my nacho chips but I do make sure I have at least 2 bags of them. You can add whatever toppings you like. Note: If you use the taco sauce, the dip will get soggy if left overnight, so make fresh the day you need it. You won't be sorry with this one and so glad Rose got this on here so everyone can enjoy! Thanks!

I love this recipe and have made it a million times. I do not add the green peppers because I think it will take away from the taco spices.

Yummy! I use reduced fat cream cheese and on top of that I add a layer of refried beans. I buy taco seasoning in bulk instead of the packages so I use 4 TBS. I buy the shredded lettuce in a bag. The toppings vary according to what I have on hand and the group I am serving. I usually use sliced green onions on top and omit the bell pepper.

Good Recipe! For a little more flavor, I added 1 can of chili without beans to the sour cream, cream cheese mixture. Yum Yum!

The combination of cream cheese, sour cream and taco seasoning is absolutely the best and what makes this recipe so great.  The cream cheese is a little tangy.  I used the 1/3 less fat neutrifella cheese, I find it tends to get softer.  Honestly, the toppings over this are not even really needed this portion is so good.

My friend gave me this recipe years ago, and I love it! I suggest if you are making it ahead of time, just mix up the cream cheese, sour cream and taco seasoning and put it in the fridge... don't add any of the toppings until ready to serve, it can get mushy and watery.Also I always use whipped cream cheese instead of regular. It mixes easier.

This is always requested at my parties.  However, I use equal amounts of cream cheese and sour cream, and I have 1 packet of seasoning for ever every 8 oz. of cream cheese and sour cream.  I top with just the lettuce, tomatoes, and sharp cheddar, but you can add whatever you like.  This has been a hit for YEARS!

I've been making this recipe for 30+ years and always get raves and requests for a copy (came from an old Philly Brand Cream Cheese recipe book). I follow the original recipe: cream cheese, 1 c. cottage cheese, sour cream, taco seasoning pkg, lettuce (chopped up small so that it doesn't dangle from the chip), onion (yellow or green, whatevah ya like!), chopped tomatoes (I don't include the watery goop cuz it makes the topping get watery; and chop these small too), finely shredded cheese (do yourself a favor and just buy the shredded stuff); and black olives (too many people don't like black olives, so unfortunately I rarely include them). Serve with AUTHENTIC TACO CHIPS! Really, it's much better with them! HINTS: bring the cream cheese to room temp first; add the seasoning into the sour cream, THEN combine the cream cheese, sour cream, and cottage cheese...they mix together much easier. AND make this goop up at least 4 hours before or the DAY  before serving (that's what I do) as the seasoning tastes much better after marinating. As well, I do the chopping of everything the day before--except the lettuce (I'll chop the lettuce the day of so that it doesn't turn brown). It's a wonder I'm still single with this recipe!! :+D

I doubled this by putting in two packs of cream cheese and only 16 oz of sour cream and it turned out perfect.  This was so yummy!  Will make this again!

I followed this recipe step for step, word for word, and it was like liquid, so we had to add a ton more cream cheese.  I will never follow this recipe again.

this stuff is awesome. similiar to one i make, only i add a pound of ground beef, fully cooked and drained of fat, and put it on top of the cream cheese mixture, then i put the shredded cheese on top, then the lettuce, tomato, olives, and pepper. I like to layer into a 2 quart rubbermaid container, that way when your done, you can pop the lid on and put the rest in the fridge. Yum Yum!

This was very good and our guests loved it.  I followed the advise of one of the other reviews and whipped the cream cheese first.  It does make it easier to mix with the sour cream and taco seasoning. I didn't have an extra tomato, so I drained some salsa and added it instead and they loved it!!!!  Make sure you drain it though, otherwise way too much liquid!  Thanks Rose!

I made this recipe x10 to serve a crowd and it went over fantastically well! I used the Taco Seasoning recipe from this site, since it's much tastier than any prepackaged stuff I've purchased...more expensive since I used good quality spices to make it, but it does wonders! I used full-fat sour cream, as it's what they sell at CostCo, though I am OK with a light sour cream. I like the color of green peppers but prefer red/orange/yellow, so I used some of those instead. So everything wasn't orange and red, I added thinly sliced green onions. Beautiful and tasty!

Good, everyone enjoyed, but I thought the Taco seasoning was a little strong.  Next time I made it, I didn't use a whole package.

I make this without the cream cheese...i also used ortega taco seasoning which is less "grainy" than some of the others.  Instead of just cheddar cheese I used the mexican or taco blend shredded cheese.  I left out the bell peppers and added some chopped green onions.

Great recipe as is! Taco dip is a standard for all the parties I go to. When looking for the basic recipe, I came across ones dressed up with 'stuff' before finally finding this one and it is PERFECT! Now I can add any miscelllaneous extras I want to this one.  Thanks!!

I came on searching for different variations of my famous taco dip and found this one.  Guess what?  It's almost exactly what I've been making without a recipe for years!  Every event we have, I am told I have to bring my taco dip!  

I leave out the pepper and I always add ground turkey to the bottom layer.  HUGE, HUGE hit!!  We find it best to make 2 trays of a thin layer because it's easier to dip the chips in.  And if you use Manny's chips, they're the best because the extra salt from the chips just makes it that much better!  YUM!!

Made this dip exactly as directions stated and all 5 of us were really pleased with the taste. We used the Taco Seasoning recipe from this site also. Just the right texture and flavor for children and adults.

This was really easy and a great snack!  I didn't put the green pepper, just because they aren't my favorite.  I also used canned diced tomatoes of fresh.

I took this to a New Year's Eve party and it was a hit!  Make sure the cream cheese is room temp before mixing.  Thanks for sharing!

Very delicious and super easy.  Toppings I use are cheddar cheese, lettuce, and red onion - simple but tasty.

Very yummy, and easy to make.  For an easy shortcut, use a jar of salsa instead of the tomatoes and green peppers.

Just made this for a Graduation party.  And like the other reviewers said, "everyone loved it" they where standing around the table with chips in hands eating it out of the pan.  I used the suggestion of mixing the taco seasoning with the cream cheese first, and had no problems!

I bring this dish to parties and people rave about it!  They keep requesting it over and over.  It is soooo good!  To make the cream cheese and the sour cream mix easier I used a mixer on medium speed.  I tried to stir it the first time but the cream cheese came out a little chunky.  This is one of my favorite recipes!

A real crowd pleaser! I leave out the pepper and olive as no one is a big fan of them and the dip is still delicious. I've tried to make this in advance and store in the refrigerator to save time and it didn't work that well. It turned a bit watery. I just took a paper towel and soaked up some of the water that was sitting around the edge. I've learned my lesson and prepare this upon time of consumption now.

So easy and so delicious! Took no time to prepare...
and you can use any taco mix for flavoring depending on how hot or spicy you like.
It went too fast, wish I had made more!

Loved this recipe from the first time we made it! I've added guacamole at times and omitted the green pepper. I make it for my family all the time. We don't need a special occasion to make this.

I too have been making this taco dip for parties and potlucks. Mine is a little different, Thanks to a friend of mine. Instead of the cream cheese, I use a packet of Hidden Valley Fiesta Dip, mixed with a 16 oz carton of sour cream. Then top with shredded lettuce, shredded taco cheese, diced tomatoes and sliced black olives. I like to use Tostitos scoops for dipping. I have also made this with ground beef, browned and drained. No need to add taco seasoning to the meat as you will get the flavor from the fiesta dip. Love It!

This is the classic taco dip my family has been making forever:)  I have done some slight variations.  Use whipped cream cheese, makes so much easier to mix.  And now sometimes rather than blending taco seasoning, I mix finely diced onions and finely chopped black olives in whipped cream cheese, then spread taco sauce (you pick your spiciness, I use medium) as the next layer over the cream cheese then add lettuce, cheese, etc.  It is a nice variation sometimes though both ways are equally delish!!

Was very tasty and I would make it again. I omitted the lettuce and added orange peppers and green onions which made it visually very appealing. I took it to a potluck and all of it went.

Served on July 4th and was a hit!  It tastes better with chips then just sampling it alone.  I used chopped tomatoes on top instead of peppers.

I wanted to make something a bit different than the traditional 7 layer dip so chose this recipe.  It was a huge hit and gone in minutes.  I only used 1/2 the sour cream and did put refried beans on the bottom and thought it turned out great.  Next time, I'll need to double the recipe since many people didn't get to try it :)

So easy and sooo good!  I have made this a number of times and everyone seems to love it.  Have been asked for the recipe.  I don't like beans in my Taco Dip and many recipes call for it.  Keeper...will continue to make this and won't change a thing.

I make this all the time.  I spread the cream cheese mix and the I spread a jar of salsa on top of that.  Then I add the lettuce, tomatoes and cheese and sometimes peppers.

I made this dip to take to the teen center.  My mistake was I didn't make enough.  One young man said I should send it out to all the moms.  It's a fun recipe that lets you use your imagination for toppings.

This recipes was very simple! I added refried beans as an additional layer. Instead of green peppers used green onions and reduced the sour cream to 8oz.

I was so afraid to make Taco Dip (my husband's brother-n-law always makes it and it's awesome), but this was so easy to do, and it tastes just as good if I do say so myself!!

I made a few adjustments. I left out the lettuce, bell peppers and tomatoes and instead added vegetarian refried beans (bottom layer), fresh pico de gallo, with fresh avocados as a layer in its own. I did really enjoy the cream cheese mixture with the taco seasoning. I used reduced fat cream cheese and beat it smooth first before beating the sour cream with it. It was really, really yummy. Better the next day in my opinion. I will make it again the same exact way but probably refrigerate for longer before serving. I liked how easy it was. Thanks!

Very good & very easy!  Went very well at my party last night.  I omitted the green peppers, but that's just a personal preference!  I used a cake pan (which worked out nicely) instead of a 9 in. dish, I thought the 9 in. dish would've been too small.  I loved this dip though, thx Rose!

This is a great recipe. I did change one thing though.  I used 16oz of softened cream cheese.  It gives it a creamier texture.  Also, "Taco Bell" seasoning I thought had the better taste of taco seasonings.

Very good.  Don't be afraid to make this ahead of time and store in the fridge- it tastes best after sitting for awhile.  I prefer a version of this recipe with finely diced onion and black olive mixed in with the sour cream layer instead of on top, with lettuce, cheese, and tomato layered on top.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I agree with another that the cream cheese should be beaten first. I had lumps of cream cheese that didn't mix.  I also think it would be improved upon by adding refried beans to the bottom...just my personal preference. I will add them if I make this recipe again.
But if your looking for a quick and flavorful dip, this fits the bill.

Good Recipe! I used a hand blender to mix the cream cheese, sour cream and taco seasoning. I also omitted the  bell pepper. I think scallions and pickled jalapeño would also work on top.

I didnt actually make this recipe yet but i gave it 5 stars because this is how my family always makes the taco dip and i love it.  I just wanted to add a suggestion that we do a lot to save a lot of chopping.  Instead of chopping tomatoes, pepper, and onion we go to the store and buy the fresh made salsa (in the fresh veggie section) and put that on top of it.

I usually make something very similar, but use a 16oz jar of taco sauce in place of the taco seasoning. The taco sauce version is delicious.... this was very bland.

Love this. We found it really good, but needing "something" so now I use half the sour cream and substitute homemade salsa for the rest. I agree with the other reviewers that you must whip the cream cheese first for best consistency.  We also add some beans underneath sometimes for the bean lovers.  Everyone loves it.

Delicious! I used full fat sour cream and cream cheese mixed with the taco seasoning, and topped with seeded chopped tomatoes, lettuce and cheese. It is so good, and I don't even care for mexican flavors! If you unwrap the cream cheese and place in a bowl and microwave for a minute or two, it blends perfectly!

This recipe is great, and also flexible.  I've made it where I've lined the serving dish with refried beans and then continued as written.  I've also done it with adding some leftover taco beef on top of the sour cream/ cream cheese layer.  I'm not a guacamole person, but I'm sure that would work well in the recipe also.


Today I am going to try it using some greek yogurt in place of the sour cream/ cream cheese, as that's what I have in the house.

Awesome.  Brought this to a BBQ and it disappeared!  Will definitely make again & again!!  Followed recipe almost exactly....the only changes I made were:  I added a few shakes of cayenne pepper into the sour cream/cream cheese mixture for added heat, and instead of the green pepper, I used sliced scallions on top.

This is the basic recipe I've used for years. My version... I brown a pound of lean ground beef with 1/2 chopped onion and once cooled add about a half bottle of Western dressing.  I layer that over the cream cheese mixture and pile the lettuce, cheese etc. on top.  More of a meal than a dip and always a hit!

This recipe was so easy and very good! Looked really nice too, before everyone started digging in =] It went quickly and everyone complimented me on it. I used 8 oz. of the sour cream and it turned out fine I think. I don't know if I will ever try it with the 16 oz. since it came out so great this time. Definitely try this, it was too easy!

great! the cream cheese was great with the sour cream. i didnt have any taco seasoning mix so i quickly whipped up my own w/ lots of dried chili ancho, onion powder, garlic powder, salt, paprika, cumin, and a little cayenne. i also had to sub green onions (didnt have green pepper). i would probably just use the green onions again because they smelled yummy

As per other reviews, I used only 8oz of sour cream but kept everything else more or less the same.  This turned out great - everyone loved it & wanted the recipe.  Added bonus - it's quick to make and pretty cheap too.

Very tasty.  The only thing I didn't do was the lettuce.  Made it in the morning and let it sit in the fridge so the flavors could blend.

Made as is, there really isn't much taco flavor to the dip.  Next time I will add another packet of taco seasoning.  And, no, i didn't add the lettuce because it does get wilty and yucky, as other readers have stated.

Great dip! Skipped the lettuce layer and used chuncky style salsa instead of the tomatoes.  Also, added a layer of refried beans.  Not a drop left!

Topped it with cheddar, green onion and tomatoes, and excluded the toppings we don't care as much for.  We took it to two summer parties had lots of requests for the recipe.  Thanks a bunch!

This dip was good.  I felt that it needed a little more flavor.  I drizzled some taco sauce over the top before I topped it with the cheese, tomatoes, etc.  The sauce helped to add some more flavor.  Next time I may use more taco seasoning.

Everyone always loves this recipe! Try CHEESY taco seasoning instead of regular seasoning to add an even cheesier taste to the dip. I serve mine in a deep pie dish. I don't like it too deep so you can get all the ingredients on your tortilla chip!

This was a marvelous dish. I did use the pre-packaged shredded lettuce and omitted the green peppers and it was easy, quick, and in fact, I'm making it again this week for a work party. Most everyone scooped it up with tortilla chips, except for one of my guests was using it to top his burger! Yummy! Kudos to you for a good recipe.

Just like the store, but I didn't realize when writing down the ingredients, that is serves 25 people.  I had Taco dip in my fridge for a week after and was bringing it to work, the doctors office..everywhere. Anyway, next time I will make it for 8 servings, for a nice regular size taco dip platter.

This is an excellent recipe.  It's easy and tasty.  I used a 15x10" cookie sheet and used Tostitos scoops with it for dipping.  There wasn't a drop left after the party.  Thanks!

I have made this many times. Every time I do it's gone fast. When I take it to party's everyone raves about it and it's gone before you know it. I however only add topping that I like(lettuce, tomatoes and cheese). Also it has been stated before but you should always beat the cream cheese first to make sure it doesn't clump.

Don't rinse the head lettuce, the lettuce will get water-logged and this dip will not turn out.  Take the first 3-4 outer leaves off the lettuce and you're good to go.

I really like this dip. I made the recipe dip for my work potluck. Huge hit. Also added the cayenne pepper into the mix. I really like the jalapeños for a delicious spicy kick.

Love this recipe. I added refried beans as the bottom layer, then added the cream cheese mixture to upper layer, topped it with chopped lettuce, diced tomatoes, sliced black olives, chopped jalapenos, sliced green onions, and shredded cheese.  Taste good with the hint of lime tostito chips.

Made this for new years eve. It was delicious but seemed to lack a bit of zing. I did omit the green peppers as I didn't have any and don't enjoy them, but made it otherwise as listed. I will be making it again though!

Edit: We host many MMA get togethers at our place and this is requested every time now! Have topped with ground beef and is fantastic. I usually half it so it makes one pan, but still use all the taco seasoning. Fantastic!

Love it! I skip the peppers and olives. But super yummy with the scoops chips. I slowly add the sour cream to the softened cream cheese. The consistency turns out much better.

I love this recipe! The only thing I do different is that I chop a half of an onion instead of green pepper.  I also cook a 1/2 pound of ground meat an add once it cools off ( I have even added a 1/2 can of refried beans to this dip along with the 1/2 cooked ground meat) and it is even BETTER!!  I ALWAYS get request to make this dip and there is never any left : )

I love this recipe. Some taco dip recipes are complicated or require a lot of different ingredients, but this one was simple and easy! I even make this sometimes for a quick weeknight dinner. I just add some shredded chicken to the layers.

Awesome!  My mom had this recipe and has been making it for years.  However our recipe doesn't call for green peppers.  Plus, I dislike olives so if I'm making it for myself, I skip them altogether.  The cream cheese, sour cream, taco seasoning mix can be made beforehand (even the night before) and refrigerated.  Make sure to add the lettuce at the last possible minute, or else it just gets soggy.  Let the kids mix the sour cream, cream cheese, and taco seasoning for you with their bare, but clean hands.  The will complain about the mix being too cold but will love to lick their hands off afterwards :)

A little bland for my liking. I don't undertrstand the green pepper considering the taco seasoning but we added it and it wasn't bad, we also added onion. all in all its a good start but needs a little more spice.  We served with jalapeno's and taco sauce.

Very good, was a big hit! However, I got only one complaint from someone.. they said their moms was better and suggested using taco sauce instead of taco seasoning mix.. might give that a try next time :)

I make a version of this dip except I replace the taco seasoning with a small jar of salsa mixed with the cream cheese. Does not last long in a crowd.

I have been making this dip for years! My family always has me make it for events. The only thing you want to make sure and do is make sure that the cream cheese is softened otherwise you will end up with little lumps.

Me and my mom can't get enough of this dip. I only used this recipe to get the cream cheese to sour cream ratio, but I ended up using the exact same ingredients! It's a classic. Definitely a 5 star junk food. :)

This is one of our family favorites! Although, I leave the olives off, cause we are not big fans! This stuff goes really fast- my family has been known to polish one off in about 15-20 minutes!!

This is a great dip that my family has made since I was a little girl.  We do ours a little differently though - we use cottage cheese instead of sour cream, add 1/4 c. taco sauce to the cream cheese mixture, and pour the rest of the bottle of sauce on top of the mixture.  We don't use lettuce, green peppers or olives, but we add green onions, green chilies and jalapenos.  Delish!!

I followed Stacey508's advice by adding a little cayenne and then layering salsa, taco cheese, tomatoes, lettuce and black olives on top - no bell peppers. Since I didn't have the real taco cheese I used regular cheddar with a little more taco seasoning sprinkled on. Since I use the Taco Seasoning I recipe from this site, it's easy to make a little extra! Oh, and I used plain nonfat yogurt instead of sour cream and you can't tell the difference! This dip is yummy! This will definitely be a regular in my rotation.

Yum-o!  This is the easiest and most delicious taco dip ever.  It's always the first side item to go!  Plus I don't like beans and this is the best recipe out there that I can find that doesn't use beans!  I do cream (using a mixer) the cream cheese before adding any other ingredients.  It does help.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I was pleasantly surprised by this dip. I thought it would need to be warm, but it was delicious room temperature or even cold. Great flavor and very versatile, you can add or remove any of the toppings and it still tastes delicious. It is great with plain tortilla chips or nacho cheese chips as well.

I make this without the sour cream, although I'm sure it would be good with it, also.  We don't eat raw tomato or olives, so I just omit them.  Everyone chowed it down!

Very good.  I used low fat sour cream and cream cheese, and it turned out excellent!  I also added about 2 tbsp. taco sauce to the creamy mixture for extra kick.  I omitted the pepper based on personal preference, topped it with some green onion as well.  The guests loved it, and what a great presentation it made!

I substitute the sour cream with small curd cottage cheese (know it sounds wierd, and I hate cottage cheese, but it makes the base a little thicker and it works!).  I skip the lettuce and drizzle the top with taco sauce (not salsa).  It's ALWAYS a hit!!

A classic recipe that I'll be making frequently for years to come! I've made it for several get-togethers and it is always gone in no time. Everyone has preferred this hands-down over any store-bought taco dip they've tried. The only thing I changed was I didn't include the peppers, and I bought a bag of shredded lettuce to save time.

Great taco dip.  It's always one of the first things to go when I bring it to a pot luck.  Any variety of veggies thrown on top goes well.  I sometimes throw on some finely chopped cilantro too.  Yum.

I took this to a BBQ and everyone loved it.    I didn't use the tomato just because I don't like them.  I also added black olives on top.

No one in my family likes refried beans so finding a Mexican style Taco Dip that doesn't call for beans is quite a feat!  I have made this recipe for years and years.  Everyone LOVES it!  We especially like it with the Spicy Taco Seasoning mix for a little bite!  Also I seed the tomatoes that I dice before putting on top because if this sits for a while and you don't seed the tomatoes first it gets kinda soggy and runny and seperates which doesn't effect the flavor but it just doesn't look very appetizing when it is runny and seperating.  I never have any leftovers of this when I make it for a party!

Excellent!  I made this for a light lunch today for my kids and I and they LOVED it.  Having 2 semi-picky toddlers, this is a huge thing.  Very good, except like one other person commented, the cream cheese balls up (I even mixed it well first).  I'm thinking a blend in the food processor would take care of it, next time I will use that.  I didn't use olives or pepper, just cheese, lettuce and I drizzled taco sauce on top instead of tomatoes.  Still, very good!
Doesn't take away from the dish at all though.. very good, very quick, very easy and a nice cold taco dip for a warm day.

I have been using this recipe for the last few years and I must say, it's a HUGE hit.  More in demand than ever these days, everywhere I take it someone wants the recipe.  

Like the photo appears to show, I do not use the peppers or the olives.  

I also use a Mexican or Taco blend cheese.

HUGE HIT!

I made this for a work potluck and it went over very well! I added premade guacomole after putting in the cream cheese and sour cream mixture. I did beat that as others had suggested and it did not have any cream cheese lumps in it.

Great dip!

I love to make this dip and it is so quick and easy. Everyone loves it. You can make it even easier by buying pico de gallo at the grocery store and the bagged shredded lettuce that they sell by the bagged salad mix. Couldn't be much more simple than that! Thanks for a tasty recipe!

This recipe is great!  My co-worker made it but put it on individual paper plates so we could each take a plate.  It works great because the paper plate is bendable which makes scooping the dip easy.

This is a great recipe . I did not add olives and green peppers but spread a layer of taco sauce (spicy) on the creme chese base and everyone loved it. You might want to give that a try. Everybody said they had this before but something was different and they could'nt figure out what it was. Anyways it was gone in no time.

Very tasty and so easy to make. Everyone loved it! Just make sure not to make too soon in advance. The lettuce may get soggy. Changed it to 2 (8 oz.) packages cream cheese and 1 (16 oz.) container sour cream. 2 packages of taco seasoning. Much better texture/flavor this way.

This was such an easy recipe and it was eaten so quickly at Bunco.  I added cilantro and used red peppers instead of green.  When I made my own plate I used salsa on top also to add even more ump. Next time I may try using refried beans on top of the cream cheese mixture to make it a bigger appetizer.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Great recipe for any party or get together!  Quick and easy.  Used pico de gallo instead of tomatoes and green peppers.
***To avoid soupy dip make sure lettuce is dried very well!  Enjoy!!

I used my food processor to chop the vegetables and used garlic  and onion powder instead of garlic salt and fresh onion.  I seasoned the chopped vegetable with the onion and garlic powders instead of the cream cheese, sour cream, and taco seasoning mixture.
I was super easy and quick to make.  My guests raved about how good it was.

I have been making this for a many years! Always a hit!! I always leave the cream cheese out before I start to make it, so it's easier to mix with the sour cream and taco seasoning. 
On top of that, I just use, lettuce, tomatoes and cheese.  
I want some now, since I'm talking about it!! :) hahahaaaaa

It was soooo good!!!! Since I didn’t have any sour cream I used plain Greek yogurt and added refried beans.

I’d definitely make this recipe again.

I make this a lot and it is always a hit.
Usually I serve it on a pretty tray (seasonal decoration stuff).  
I use different types of lettuce (and abundantly) depending on the season (Spinach/romaine/spring mix).  I layer just about anything I have in the veggie drawer.  Tomatoes/Cucumber/colored peppers/onion/once I used carrots (For color) -- depending upon the lettuce I used.  Then I add shredded cheese (sometimes smoked guoda) and sometimes olives (black or green).  
My husband and I like to take a snack to a brewery/tap room.  This is healthy and tasty -- the spice is good with beer.

love this recipe since I was a kid. now I make it but add cooked venison burger to the mixture of cream cheese and sour cream so look at ten more minutes of prep. you can use lean ground beef or chicken too. I just never have. with just 4 people this thing is gone in 15 mins. love it. always make just before you wanna serve also.

I don’t know why others say it’s runny ...
This turned out great. Of course you can change up the toppings. I added a touch of refried beans on top of my cheese mixture before adding other indgredients. Mmmm!

This is your basic taco dip and exactly what it should taste like.  Made cream cheese mixture the night before.  It's best to remove the seedy part of the tomato to avoid it turning out too soggy.

Made this for the Patriots game & it was awesome!! (Just like the Pats!!!) I followed the directions exactly & everyone loved it! I used corn chips & Fritos for dipping. Next time I make it I will use medium fresh salsa instead of the tomatoes. I think it will give it a little kick. You should definitely try to make this. Yummy!!

I switched the bell pepper to 4 sliced green onions, as I don't care for bell peppers. Also added a cup of guacamole after the refried bean mixture. Then I covered it with the sour cream.  It is delicious!

Everyone at party I brought it to loved it! I recommend whipping cream cheese in mixer first then slowly adding sour cream to keep it from clumping. I drained salsa and put it on top of mixture right before serving, then cheese then lettuce and tomato. Omitted olives as I don’t like them. Very tasty and very easy. If one likes beans those would be great addition.

This was very good.  I added quite a bit of cayenne pepper to the sour cream mixture, omitted the bell peppers, added some salsa and put sliced jalapenos on top as our family loves the extra kick.

This is a very easy recipe.  Hard to mess it up.  Makes a light and refreshing  appy that easily serves 8.    I actually served this to 8 of my husband's hungry coworkers as a pre-BBQ appetizer and it disappeared FAST!   While  I was in the kitchen prepping the rest of our dinner I overheard several of the guys comment "man, this is sooooo good!"  :)  Made me super happy as I am a bit of a foodie, and I thought this might be too simple  or maybe too old school for this mixed group of mostly executives.  Glad I took a chance on it ! It was a total hit!  Yayyy!   AND Best of all, my cool little secret was I used  full fat, Greek style yogurt instead of sour cream (because I didn't have time to run out to buy sour cream) Nobody noticed!   Shows how versatile this recipe is.  Will make this again when I need a quick, light appy for a dinner party.

I love this recipe. I have changed it a little by adding  plain Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream and instead of a package of taco mix I make my own (recipe on All recipes) this way I can control the salt, I actually don't put any in).

It was very tasty.  The taco seasoning gave it a great kick.  Even though I love cream cheese, I found it a bit heavy.  I would try using half the cream cheese next time.

It disappeared in a flash! I added a little more chili powder to spice it up a bit but it was great even without the extra spice.

Used all vegetarian sour cream, cream cheese, and shredded cheddar.  No one could tell the difference.  Substituted black beans for the olives.  It was delish and a big hit on game day. Will definitely make this again!

I made it as shown except I subbed fresh salsa for the tomatoes. It was pretty good! My guests ate some but I did have quite a bit left over. Not sure if I'd make again.

I have been using this recipe for  a few years. It is such a hit. I use regular sour cream though, which is probably stupid because I could save calories and fat. Easy to make, except lots of cutting. Huge hit all the time!

I thought this was very good. It was a little bit bland but still good. I left out the green peppers. I did what others suggested and beat the cream cheese before adding the other ingredients. I used two cups of Mexican cheese blend. I also had leftover ground beef on hand and mixed that into the cream cheese mixture. I think this dip would be great heated as well! I wonder if letting this dip sit overnight would help the flavors blend?

I loved this! I made it for a small get together  (doubling the ingredients filled a 9x13 casserole dish). Using low fat ingredients didnt change the taste at all (when compared to other taco dips I've had). I had a LOT of left overs so I ate it on some bagels I had and warmed them in the oven at 350 for about 5 mins. My new favorite snack!

The only thing I do differently is add a can of refried beans on the bottom layer & leave out the lettuce, it just wilts too much & tastes too soggy for our taste buds.  I do sprinkle a tiny bit of cayenne pepper (about 1/8 tsp) over the bean dip.  Always gets eaten to the last speck w/plain nacho chips.!!!  Yum! ??

Left out the shredded lettuce, but then followed recipe exactly. Very easy to make & tastes good. I will spice it up more the next time I make it as I personally prefer a spicier flavor . Good, quick easy recipe.

I have made this a number of times for all types of gatherings.  Every time I have made this, there was never any left.  My son absolutely loves it and am making it again for our vacation in Wildwood.  Gotta have a good dip while sitting next to the bonfires. :)  Thanks for a easy and great recipe.

I made this for myself and 4 girlfriends, and we inhaled it!  This is my new go to taco dip recipe; it is so delicious and easy!  I did alter the ingredients slightly, which I think made it much better.  I used half the amount of sour cream and used green onion instead of green pepper.  I also spread some mild taco sauce on top of the cream cheese/sour cream layer (I would have preferred medium or hot) for extra flavor.  I didn't measure anything, just eyeballed it.  Be sure to beat the cream cheese well, or it will be clumpy.

Very easy to make, i omit the green pepper, but i do add a jar of mild salsa, helps with the flavor and makes it much easier to mix together, i also mix the cheese INTO it so that with every bite you get some cheese. If you add the salsa, you should let it chill for 30-60 min!

I love this recipe!  So easy and good.  I get requests from family to make this taco dip a lot.  One thing I like about this is there are no beans in this dip.  An alternative to the taco dips that have refried beans in it etc...

Used one bar and one tub cream cheese with the sour cream and taco seasoning.  Then, chunky salsa, shredded lettuce, Mexican cheese, diced tomatoes, green onions.  Delicious!

Made this for my annual Chrismukkah party and it was a big hit.  Followed the recipe exactly as written except I omitted the lettuce as I had none on hand.  Brought the cream cheese to room temperature and then using a wisk I mixed in the sour cream and taco seasoning.  Refrigerated it overnight then right before the party I added the toppings.  Will make again!  Note to self:  a 35 gram pack of taco seasoning is equal to 1.25 oz.

I made it without lettuce or green peppers because I was out of both. I added diced blanched jalapeño peppers and a small amount of diced red onion.  It was still great. My 13yo daughter loved it. It was our first attempt to make a dip similar to the one at Festival Foods in Wisconsin.

I make this for any get together I'm invited to. I always add a thin layer of taco sauce on top of the cream cheese mixture. Definitely makes a delicious difference.

It was to easy to make but I heated the cream cheese for 1 minute in the microwave and it made it easier to mix the other ingredients.

When we make this dip, we do not mix the cream cheese and sour cream, it's too runny that way. We spread the cream cheese on the platter and sprinkle the taco season on that. Then build the layers. If you're making it the night before, prep all your ingredients, but don't put the tomatoes and lettuce on until just before serving so the water doesn't escape the veggies. 

It's really good, and people eat a ton of it at parties!

I let the cream cheese soften at room temperature but when i combined all my ingredients it started to clump and that's when i busted out the food processor/blender. Now it's smooth and creamy.   The day is saved! Otherwise,  great and easy recipe, and wonderful taste!

I will not add cream cheese next time and would rather have it with just sour cream.  I added a can of refried beans as my first layer.

We love this recipe!  I beat the cream cheese before adding the sour cream, and it always turns out great!  Sometimes we put a layer of refried beans under the sour cream/cream cheese layer.  It is good either way!

Very yummy. I left out the pepper since we don't care for it. Also used 1 jar of Mild Salsa instead of tomatoes and added some (taco) seasoned ground beef. Will probably make this again.

I took this to my in-laws' for Christmas and it went so fast that I only got one chip-full!  So, I made it again and took it to their house for New Year's Eve.  Once again, it went fast.  
The only changes I made were leaving out the lettuce and green peppers...not a lot of fans of those around here...and instead of adding all the taco seasoning to the cream cheese sour cream mixture, I added half to it and half to the meat.

Whenever I have a party or am invited to a party, this is usually one of the most requested appetizers.  I usually omit the peppers, but that's personal preference.  It's also easier now that you can buy bags of shredded lettuce.

Definitely an awesome recipe that I will be using for years.

My friends loved this!  I really thought it needed some refried beans, but they said they loved it because it DIDN'T have the beans.  SO, if you are fixing for picky eaters, I recommend this!  I put chunky salsa on top of the cream cheese mixture instead of tomatoes, since they really aren't in season right now!  Didn't use the green peppers either (because of the picky eaters:)

A good, quick party appetizer that everyone enjoyed.  Personally, it had too much of a cream cheese flavor for me, so next time I'll just adjust the ratio of cream cheese to sour cream.  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely excellent! I've had this before, and wanted to make it for a party. This is so easy to make your own, by adding different toppings. Rave reviews all the way!

I made this for a party I was attending a few months ago and ever since this has been the one item that people request I bring to every party I attend now.  Great tasting and very easy to make!
