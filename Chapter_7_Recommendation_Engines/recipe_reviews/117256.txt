I used reduced fat crescent rolls and omitted the salt. We loved these. My kids ate three/two just between them.

Quite good, but would recommend that you don't use the salt.  The Italian seasoning is salty enough on its own. No need to mix the seasonings with the oil. I just brushed the rolls with EVOO (personal choice), and lightly sprinkled with the garlic powder and Italian seasoning.

Um...Guys.  Italian seasoning doesn't have salt in it.  Or at least it shouldn't.  I liked the recipe just fine, but used scratch biscuit dough.  The texture of "tube dough" is not very appetizing.

Whoa!  Hold the salt!  I loved the flavor I could taste through all the salt.  I will skip the salt next time I make these.  Part of the reason for to much saltiness may also be because I had to use the layered biscuits instead of buttermilk.  I will test these again with buttermilk biscuits.

I made these last night to go with my daughters lasagna.  I used a can of store brand cheap biscuits so I wasn't expecting much.  I also didn't follow directions, (was talking) and put oil on before I baked them, granddaughter read them and we put more on after.  They turned out great compared to my expectations.  After reading reviews tried them without salt.  I may try a little (1/4 tsp.) next time.  May also try twisting 2 ropes together to make a larger bread stick.  Very good with little effort or expense.   I will make them again.  Thank you for  sharing Mary.

I never would have discovered this recipe without abapplez's picture the other day.  And what a find it was.  These are easy and delicious.  They went perfectly with our dinner and would compliment many dishes.

Super...whole family loved them. My Italian seasoning doesn't have salt so I added it.

Excellent if you leave out the salt. I followed other reviews and omitted the salt and I can't imagine adding the 1/2 teaspoon called for. Everyone loved these. They have been requested several times. Thanks for sharing!

For some reason I could only taste salt, salt, and more salt on these when they were done.  I love salt, but even for me it was too much!  Will try again with less salt next time and I'm sure they will be great!

Made these for Thanksgiving and really enjoyed them.  I probably used less salt than called for and didn't have any prepared italian seasoning so I just mixed up my own with basil, oregano, and parsley.  Also, it was after I baked the biscuits that I realized I didn't have a brush, so I just dipped the tops into the oil/seasoning mixture.  Will make again for sure!

I made these with a 16 oz tube of biscuits and they produced a bigger knot - very yummy!  I also kept the oven at 350 and baked for about 10 minutes.  Perfect!

I had to let these bake a little longer than normal, but we really liked them. I use half butter and half oil. Perfect.

These were pretty good. I used the cheap bisquits (the ones that come 4 all bundled together) as that's what I had. A little dry for me but a wuick fix for dinner none the less. Thanks!

Delicious! I used crescent rolls, swapped butter for the olive oil, and cut the salt in half. Quick and easy!

Fun to make and yummy.  A great change from regular rolls.  I served them along side Stuffed Cabbage from this website.  I'll definitely make them again.
