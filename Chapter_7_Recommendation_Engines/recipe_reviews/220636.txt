I followed this recipe exactly. It came out good! I will add more seasoning next time as they were a little bland for me. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made some changes to this and it turned out amazing. I used cream of mushroom soup, added fresh garlic and chopped onions.  I seasoned with paprika, garlic salt, salt, pepper, parsley,  red pepper flakes and seasoned salt. Used shredded parmesan and cheddar. No provolone. It was soooo delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out really runny, but firmed up after sitting for 20 minutes or so.  I didn't like the cream of chicken soup - I would suggest cream of celery, mushroom or cheddar soup instead.  Needs spice too.  Not a favorite.

I chose this recipe because it was "quick" and I had most of the ingredients readily available. I used 4 medium red skinned potatoes and no provolone. Turned out delicious. Very tasty.
