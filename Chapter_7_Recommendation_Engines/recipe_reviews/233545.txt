Really delicious! They're a bit fluffier than a typical cookie, but still tasty. I actually doubled the spices and used my own blend of ginger, cloves, and allspice. On some of them, I drizzled chocolate over the top which was a nice touch but not necessary because they were already really good. Everyone at my coffee and treats get together loved them!

I do think that 400 was a bit high for my oven and on my second round I cooked them at 350 for 5 minutes longer. My final comment is that they don't spread or change very much while baking, so if you want flatter cookie-looking ones, you should shape them yourselves when you put them on the pan.

We really liked these! They aren't too sweet, but they do kill the sweet tooth. I would eat these for breakfast! 
I'll be making these again! Thank you for a great recipe.

Very good.  More of a drop biscuit than a cookie, but tasty either way!

Very good cake-like cookies.  Tastes similar to a typical applesauce cake.  I used raisins and chopped pecans. 

To Cut down on carbs - will use non-refined sugar and omit cranberries.

I could not find cake spice and used pumpkin pie spice instead. The cookies turned out ok, but I had to bake about 10 minutes longer to get them to set up. Due to the expense of the almond flour I will probably won't make it again.
