Wow!  This recipe elevates parsnips to a whole new level.  I couldn't serve sherry to all my eaters so I made individual servings some with and some without and I sampled both.  Without it it is rich and oh, so buttery, with the sherry it acquires a different taste.  I loved both ways.  I did omit the sugar, it just didn't seem necessary to me.  Thank you, Barbara!

I made a couple of changes. Firstly, I do not cook with Sherry so I omitted it.  Secondly, I had  two potatoes left in my pantry and decided to chuck them in.  Thank you for the recipe.  I love parsnips and this was a delicious way to eat them!
