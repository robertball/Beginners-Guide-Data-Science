Best cookie ever! I subtituted rolled oats for the flour and made them oatmeal cranberry cookies instead though. So yummy!

I made these exactly by the recipe and they were great. I am going to play around with different flavors now. I am going to try chocolate pudding and mint chocolate chips next.

These cookies are out of this world!  I did not substitute anything as i like to try a recipe "as is" the first time.  I made them for a Christmas cookie exchange party and they were a hit!  Delicious!

these were very good, my son doesn't like cranberries, but we have a rule, try it once, if you don't like it thats fine, but you have to try it. he tries, he liked. the only change i made was that i used a cup each of white and semi-sweet chips since that is what i had leftover that i wanted to use up. i think next time i will use more cranberries, but that is just a personal taste (i can never have enough of them!), it is not a reflection on the recipe itself.

Very good cookie recipe.  Like other reviewers, I added more cranberries.  I also added chopped pecans.  This recipe doubles well.

I just made these cookies, and think I've found an all-time new favorite to replace my old stand-by of White Chocolate Macadamia cookies.  They are absolutely delicious; the perfect balance of sweet from the chips and tartness from the cranberries.  An absolute keeper!  I didn't change a thing:-)

I flipflopped the white sugar/brown sugar amounts and used instant CHEESECAKE pudding. I also used four ounces dried cranberries, a little less than the amount of white chocolate chips I put in. The flavor of these cookies was amazing but they didn't want to spread much, I think maybe it was because I made the cookies too small. Next time, I'll make them bigger and see if they don't spread out a little better.

These cookies couldn't be any better, or any easier to make!  Everyone who tasted them raved about them ==== they're not your run of the mill cookies that turn up on every cookie platter.   The first time I made them, I accidentally put in twice the amount of cranberries, but they still turned out perfectly.  So now we sometimes double the cranberries, sometimes not ===== depending on our mood!!

YUM! Awesome texture and terrific flavor. I used French vanilla pudding because that's what I had on hand. I do think that I'll make these during the holidays for my cookie trays. Thanks! :)

Pretty good recipe. I've made a couple of times now and I'm looking forward to playing around with other flavors in the future. I doubled the cranberries after reading other reviews and also added 1/8 teaspoon of salt. I think they turned out great with those adjustments. Like I said, I've made them twice now and will prob make again in the future.

Delicious and very easy to make! I brought the cookies to the office and everyone loved them. I found the cookies don't actually grow/spread enough to take up the suggested two inches between each cookie. They actually inflate more than spread (due to the pudding mix) so depending on the shape you want your cookie to be it might be a good idea to flatten them a bit before putting them into the oven. I'm definitely going to try other combinations of pudding, chocolate chips and dried fruit. Macadamia nuts are also a great addition!

Oh-so-delicious!  I baked a batchful, gave half to my sister, and the rest were on my mother's kitchen counter.  Her friend popped by for a visit, tried one, and then proceeded to eat like four more.  We gave her the rest of the batch.  This is a woman who never eats sweets!

I just fell in love with these cookies!! So delicious, and easy. Nothing needs to be changed in this recipe. The store was out of white choc chips, so I just coarsely chopped a 6 oz block of white chocolate. Perfect! :)

A great recipe. I made it twice: first time with half the amount of butter (1/2 cup) and the cookies still turned out delicious; the second time I substituted oats for flour and discovered that you need about 3 parts oats and 1 part flour, not just oats, and maybe only 1/2 or 3/4 cup butter or they will be too oily.

These were delicious!  They had a wonderful taste.  If you want a big cranberry taste you will need to add more to the mix, but I loved it just the way it was.  My husband is not big on cookies, but he loved these.  My kids loved them too.  I can't wait to try it with other combinations.

Good cookies.  Very sweet from the white choc chips, so I'd almost rather have actual cranberries instead of the dried, which are sweetened.  At least, mine are!  Otherwise, nice flavor and pretty cookies.  They don't spread so I flattened mine with the back of a spatula.  thanks for the recipe!

Nice and easy to make. Yummy buttery cookie dough.  I followed the recipe and used white chips and dried cranberries.   Turned out perfectly.   Made 5 dozen. Maybe I made them a bit smaller.

Loved this cookie! It was nice and soft but a little too sweet to have too many :) . My brother helped make them and accidentally added almond extract instead of vanilla. It was, as Bob Ross would say, a happy accident and I think I'll stick with it in the future. For personal taste, I added quick oats (I'd say 1 cup or less) and around 1/4 cup milk to moisten it because of the extra oats. I also added about 1/4 cup more cranberries.

These are yummy cookies. Next time I make them I am going to cut out the white sugar as I think the box of pudding offers enough sweetness. Excellent flavor and I will also be using this as the base for all my chocolate chip cookies from now on.

These are really good and a nice alternative to chocolate chip cookies - I did bump up the almond extract a little.

Love love love......my little ones ate every bit......the changes I made were I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1 tablespoon of agave syrup, I did not use brown sugar because that tends to make everything extra sweet, it was perfect!!!!

So these cookies were sooo amazing, I decided to do the same cookie with chocolate fudge pudding. I doubled the recipe and added 2 bags of milk chocolate chips, 1 bag of white chocolate chips and 1 bag of skor bits.  Wow were they amazing.

OMG, best cookies ever.  Made them for Christmas to share with my family and I followed recipe to the letter except I mixed in 1 cup dried cranberries.  These were so good and my sister in law can’t stop raving about them now she  wants me to make them again.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

These were delicious!  After reading the other comments I did add about 1/4 teaspoon of salt and doubled (or maybe a little more) of the cranberries.  Next time I may even add more cranberries.

These are great. I have never seen a 6 oz package of chocolate chips! I used 6 oz of semi-sweet chocolate chips,  6 oz white chocolate chips, 1/4 cup chopped walnuts, and the cranberries. I also added 1/4 tsp salt.

I used a stand mixer for everything, including the folding, because the dough is so stiff that it was impossible for me to work with otherwise. I used the "stir" setting.

I used a 1 T cookie scoop, but I didn't like it. The cookies weren't cooked all the way, and looked too much like chocolate chip cookies. I then cut each scoop in half, rolled each one into a ball, then flattened each ball. They can be very close together, as they spread very little. I was able to easily fit 20 half-tablespoon balls (then flattened) onto a 14x16 inch cookie sheet. I saw another similar recipe where they dipped half of each cookie in semi-sweet chocolate.  They would definitely look fancier that way!

Good but too  sweet.  I didn't realize I didn't have a full bag of white chips until I got into it, and only had a half cup, so I threw in some pecans. I also used a little oatmeal.  Next time, I will  use just half the sugar. But good recipe and a soft cookie.

I absolutely love this receipe, my twist on it is I add macadamia nuts to it, I only make them for Christmas and everyone looks forward to having some. They are very mildly sweet, a little tart from the cranberries, chewy and crunchy around the edges....

Great cookie!  My husband loves these and so do the teachers I give them to.  They’re easy to make and great for using up dried cranberries left over from thanksgiving. I used more cranberries (reduced sugar) than recipe called for (same amount as white chocolate chips). Perfect as is!

These were delicious as is. The second time I made them with lemon chips instead of white chocolate. Both ways were delicious.

Excellent!  I made the first batch exactly as the recipe called (which I think is the only way to fairly review someone's recipe), and then made the second batch with oatmeal instead of flour.  The best thing is that these tasted just as good, if not better, the next day.

Made these as per the recipe. Absolutely delicious.  The second time, cut back a little on the sugar and added more cranberries as others stated.

I thought these were okay.  I needed to use up leftover cranberries and found this recipe but when I went to make them, I realized I had no vanilla pudding, so I ended up using the Nestle  recipe (on the package) and just substituting the cranberries and white chips for the semi-sweet chips, and they were delicious.  But I still wanted to try this recipe because everyone raved about it, so I bought the pudding and made them exactly as written, but I thought they weren't quite as good as the previous batch without pudding.  My husband liked them just as much, but if I need to use up cranberries again,  I'll just use the recipe on the semi-sweet package.

Followed recipe to a T. One change that I would make to the original recipe would be to double the amount of white chocolate chips. Another change I would make would be to add a textural element such as coconut flakes or macadamia nuts. Overall, great recipe.....Cookie Monster approved :)

I made these just to use up the bags of bulk dried cranberries we had, as we live in cranberry country. They were a huge hit with some EXTREMELY picky step Kids and had to make another batch the next afternoon.

I chopped cranberries a bit but then didn't change anything else. I made sure that I didn't over cook. They turned out yummy. I think these will be a nice addition to my Christmas cookie list.

These are our favorite cookies to make this time of year.  We do change things slightly...mainly, PUMPKIN (yeah we are big into the pumpkin craze).  Also, no one in my family likes white chocolate so we substitute dark chocolate chips!!  We make them oversized, so, today for instance, we could have had well over 120 cookies from the batches we made....we ended up with 60.  Ha!  Thank you, Linda, this is such an amazing and versatile recipe!

My husband said this is the best cookie he has ever tasted.  The only adjustment I made was I used butterscotch chips  rather than the chocolate chips.   This was sooooooo good!!!

This is one of my favorite cookie recipes. At times I haven't been able to buy white chocolate chips and have used white Lindt Lindor bars chopped up. Sometimes I've added a few pecans into the mix. I can't make these very often, because I'd end up way fatter than I am.

I have tried many cookie recipes from other on here, and this one has been my all time favorite! I have actually even substituted the white chocolate and cranberries now to make all my cookies with your base recipe. Thank you so much. This recipe has been my holiday rescue!!!

All I can say about these cookies is, "Yum!" and my Thanksgiving guests all asked for the recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except I added a little extra cranberries and white chocolate. Try them! You won't be sorry!

These cookies received rave reviews from everyone who tried them and were gone almost instantly!  I followed the recipe almost exactly (I added more chocolate chips and cranberries than the recipe called for and rolled the dough by hand into 1 - 1.5 inch balls rather than dropping them by spoonfuls).    The cookies were very easy to make.  Highly recommended!

Great recipe, I omitted the white chips
and added the zest of one orange.
I have made this cookie many times
and I get many compliments.

These are very yummy! They don't have a traditional cookie consistency in my opinion, but are more cake like. I will make them again.

This is a good cookie recipe. I added 8 ounces of both dried cranberries and white chocolate chips. I think next time I'll throw in 1 cup of nuts.

I just made these cookies for my christmas cookies exchange. I had to think of another cookie to make since i want to keep it for myself and my family! It was so good and delicious! The only thing i did was add chopped fresh cranberries in addition to the dried cranberries. My kids and hubby loved these cookies!

A little too sweet for my taste, and like others I feel it could use more cranberries.

Super easy and super delicious! Next time I'll add more cranberries, maybe double the amount. I'll be using butterscotch pudding next time as well. :)
