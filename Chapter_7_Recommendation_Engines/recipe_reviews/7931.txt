If you bake this cake for 25 minutes, it will fall, should be baked for around 40 minute.

I did bake the cake longer, too.  It was interesting that the cake seemed to change by the hour.  My family loved it!  I also froze some and it thawed beautifully.

it really has to cook at least 10/15 min. more than stated; it sure tastes good and it's very easy. Too sweet for my taste, and not chocholatey as I expected (that's why a basically quick and good enough cake gets 4 stars from me...)

This is the easiest and the best chocolate cake ever!!!! I found this recipe I guess about a month ago and I have already made it 3 times. The only problem I have with it is it barely last one whole day. Thank you for a great recipe, oh and yes it needs to bake 40 min at 350, nothing else needs to be done to it. its perfect.

I made this cake for my son-in-laws birthday and followed the tip to bake it for 40 minutes....thirty ninutes in it fell. I think it was because I baked it in a disposible pan so they could take the extra home. We still ate it and the flavor was awesome. So I tried it again tonight in a real pan. I added an extra egg and beat the eggs prior to adding them to the batter. It turned out great! I will try to post a picture in the next few days.

This cake can be very yummy, but IMHO, I think it needs a teaspoon of cinnamon in it to give the chocolate the zip it needs.  I have made this cake for years.  The one time I forgot the cinnamon, it just didn't taste right to me and was not popular with the people eating it.  Afterward I sprinkled a little cinnamon on the top and, yep, it was fixed!

We really, really didn't like this cake.  It was not nearly chocolaty enough and the frosting was sickeningly sweet despite the fact that I reduced the amount of sugar in the frosting (the only change I made to the recipe).  Secret Cake is a secret best kept -- I will not be making this again.

This is your basic "Texas" sheet cake and overall I think most people would really like.  It is usually a hit at office parties or church potlucks.  I think the sweetness of the cake is a nice balance to the icing since it is very sweet.  For my family we didn't like the texture of the icing.  Although the flavor was good, it has a really gritty texture.

We really liked this cake.  We took tips from the reviews and cooked it longer, plus added expresso & cardamom to the cake & frosting to balance the sweetness.
