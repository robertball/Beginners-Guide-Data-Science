Hey yo, what's up my fellow recipe experimenters??  To be perfectly honest, this dip tasted better than the ones I've eaten from restaurants.........seriously.  You should definitely make some changes to it, but once you find your perfect combination, you'll be extremely satisfied.  First alteration I made was halving the cream cheese.  Second, I halfed the mayo and added a little sour cream.  You will definitely want to do something with the artichokes if you don't purchase marinated ones, or even if you do.  I chopped mine up some more after they were drained and seasoned them with two kinds of seasoned salt, onion and garlic powder, a little black pepper, a small dash of italian seasoning and a couple of drops of hot sauce (I'm from Louisiana....We put that sh** on everything!  Lol).  I also mixed a little garlic powder with the spinach after it was drained.  Didn't use garlic cloves however next time, I will use only a couple and they'll be diced.  Make sure you grease your dish with a non-stick cooking spray as well as a little Country Crock and you'll have one of the best spinach dips you've ever tasted.

This recipe was outstanding! I took the advice of others and used only 1 block cr.cheese, 1 jar marinated artichokes(cut up),1 box spinach, 1/2 cup mayo, 1/3 cup sour cream and shredded parmesan cheese. Save a couple tsps of the artichoke marinade and add to dip, too. I serve it w/blue corn chips.  Everyone has loved this dip and wanted the recipe. I even make it the day before my party and refrigerate. Then I bake it for about 40 mins if it's coming from the frig. This recipe is a winner for sure!! No fail!!

This recipe got great reviews! The only changes I made (on the advice of other reviewers) was only using 1 tbsp lemon juice, marinated artichokes, 8 oz cream cheese, 8 oz sour cream. I chose to use the reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat sour cream. I also used the shredded parmesan, romano, & asiago cheese instead of just parmesan, added a small jar of diced pimentos and 1 extra garlic clove. Everyone loved it!, even if it was reduced fat. Thanks for the great recipe.

After reading the reviews I attempted to make this dish with the following modifications:  I used marinated artichokes and reduced the garlic content.  The dip was excellent but was VERY strong tasting.  Next time I will omit the garlic and lemon altogether since the marinated items are so flavorful.  NOTE:  You should chop your artichokes and spinach very well which makes it a very messy process but worth the effort!  If the dip becomes dry (which mine did), just blend in some sour cream.  A definite keeper!

Wow--This recipe is fabulous.  I followed the recipe mostly--but since I tend to like things with lots of garlic and a bit spicy-hot, I added an extra clove of garlic and some red pepper flakes.

I was also pleased with how easy this recipe was to make; I had never made a dip like this and was extremely pleased at how simple it was.

My only warnings are: (1) unless you are taking this to a large gathering, you may want to half it because it makes a ton of dip!  (2) even though you may purchase chopped spinach--chop it again to avoid large pieces.  The brand I bought said chopped on the package but there were many whole pieces included.

This was the best artichoke dip I have ever made. I did everything the same - except I used marinated artichoke hearts. I halved the recipe for four of us and we had it on baguettes. As soon as I saw that the main ingrediant wasn't mayonnaise, I was sure it would be great (I hate the really greasy types of artichoke dip). This was not greasy in the slightest.

I read alot of the reviews and in response to the folks who thought this was dip was thick...try chopping the artichokes and spinach well; mix all the ingredients well (i use an electric mixer) and serve while very warm.  Mine scoops up easily with a tortilla chip or cracker.  Personally; I don't like spinach OR artichokes; yet I love this dip!  I've made it twice and everyone devours it and asks for the recipe.  It is garlicky, but fortunately all my friends and family love garlic.  I'll definitely be making this dip often!

Funnily enough, I've been making this dip for ages before I even noticed the recipe here. My version uses marinated artichoke hearts however, and I add a little shredded Monterey jack for extra oomph. I serve mine with toasted baguette slices or extra thick tortilla chips and it disappears like magic. It's one of those recipes that everyone will ask for by the end of the evening.

Excellent! I liked this recipe better then the last one I tried on this site. Made a few changes...I only used 1 package of cream cheese and 1/3 c. sour cream with the mayo and used 1 jar of marinated artichoke hearts drained and chopped in addition to spinach, garlic and cheese. Yummy...creamy and fabulous when dipped with crusty french bread. A keeper!

Tthis recipe is too bland for my tastes, but provides an excellent base for what I've cultivated to be (IMHO) the best dip I've ever had:  1) I don't use frozen spinach. I buy an industrial-sized tub of fresh spinach (most grocery stores have it, if not, Wal-Mart does). I stuff as much fresh spinach as I can into quart-sized freezer bags and freeze for a day or two. I then crumble the spinach in the bag while it's still frozen. 2 1/2 bags are sufficient.  2) I use fat-free Miracle Whip instead of mayo. Adds additional zing.  3) I use 1/2c parmesan.  4) 4-4.5 tbsp lemon juice instead of the recommended 2  adds an additional kick.  5) I use about 6-8 LARGE cloves of fresh garlic.   The resulting dip has a nice kick and lovely zing, and is delicious re-heated and served with tortilla chips (blue corn) or crackers (Special K multi-grain go especially well).

As written I found this to be just an average dish with little taste.  It is too creamy for my taste as well.  I would reduce the cream cheese and mayo by 1/2 at least.  I added some cayenne pepper and hot sauce and still found it needed more so I dumped in 1/2 package ranch recipe secret mix and that helped a lot!

This dip was amazing!! I made it for Christmas and everyone loved it. Those reviews that said this was bland or lacked flavor, must have done something terribly wrong because it was packed with flavor. will definitely make this again. I did change a couple of things. I used frozen creamed spinich and only used 2 garlic cloves (still very garlicy). other than that I followed the recipe and it was a hit :)

I found this recipe a few years ago here and I've been making it ever since! It is the perfect appetizer! I make it a night or two before an event and then just bake it on the day I need to serve it.  I usually add more garlic because that is the way we like it. I get tons of compliments when I make this dish! Enjoy!!!

This is the BEST spinach dip recipe I've ever tried! And I've made at least a dozen spinach dips from this site. I'll experiment no further. 

I always carefully go through the reviews to see if I should make any alterations. Well, I started off halving the cream cheese like other reviews suggested. But when I mixed it together, it was NOT appealing with the 1/2 cup of mayo. So... I added the 2nd block. WAY better! Not too cheesy at all. I had planned on adding the recommended sour cream... but based on the taste so far, that just wouldn't have gone together all that well. So I skipped that. And then I proceeded to add cayenne pepper, like so many others. Well, that was my only mistake with the recipe! It added an unnecessary flavour that detracted from the taste. So what I'm trying to get across is that this recipe is perfect the way it's written!! 

The ONLY thing I did differently is add 1/4 cup Miracle Whip & 1/4 cup of Helmann's mayo instead of just mayo. I think this really added the "zip" others felt was missing. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Excellent! I followed a reviewer's suggestion and used 1 pkg of cream cheese and 1/3 c. sour cream to take away any "bland" taste some of the reviewers mentioned. Absolutely delicious. Used for New Year's get together and they took the recipe home!

Wow!  This is my favorite appetizer!! We like it cold better than warm so that is how I make it from now on.  I use the marinated artichoke hearts for extra flavor.  I also add only 1 8oz package of cream cheese, put in 1/3 cup sour cream, only 2 cloves of garlic, and skip the lemon juice.  I don't cook it since we like it better cold and serve it with baguette slices.  I sometimes make this lower in fat for just us and it is still excellent. What I do for that is use lowfat cream cheese, nonfat sour cream, only 1/4 cup mayo and add more spinach and artichoke hearts.

I'm only giving this recipe four stars because of all of the adjustments that were made. Now the recipe that I made, was certainly five! I, like suggested, bought marinated artichoke hearts. I chopped up both the spinach and the artichokes (I'm glad I did, it would have been way too stringy). I used only 1/4 cup of mayonnaise, one package of cream cheese, and 1/4 cup sour cream. I also cut back to two cloves of garlic. I used 1 cup of fresh Parmesan cheese in the dip, and I melted another 1/2 cup on top. It was delicious! We couldn't stop eating it. It makes a huge serving. Six of us ate off of it all night long, and there was still a ton left over.

I took this to a potluck and people were taking home the leftovers in styrofoam cups!  I doubled the spinach and added some sour cream to make the recipe go a little further (there were about 50 people there).  I also added some mozzarella cheese because I was instructed to make it "good and cheesy".  This went over very well and I'm terribly pleased with the result.  Great recipe!

Out of all the Artichoke/Spinach dip recipes out there this is probably the best. Although, I did find that it was a little too thick - so I added about 1/2 cup of half fat sour cream. Used fat reduced cream cheese as well and it turn out really well.

Oh, oh, WOW!!!  I made a half-recipe when some friends came over this weekend for an appetizer.  I'm glad I didn't make the whole thing because we would have eaten it all up and ruined our dinners!  This is by far one of the best recipes I have tried.  So, so, so easy and the results are wonderful!!  I cannot wait for another excuse to make this.  YUM!

10/18/02Everyone who trys this dip loves it, now I am requested to make it for every function I go to. It is a great recipe, easy and delicious! My fiance even loves it and he apparantly hates artichokes, cream cheese and mayo!

08/28/06 - I still love this dip! I just took it to a baby shower and everyone though it was amazing. It have been my "stand-by" for probably 5 years now. I ALWAYS use low-fat cream cheese and low-fat mayo and it still is the most awesome dip ever! Now I usually divide the dip into 3 corelle dishes (1- 24oz and 2- 16oz dishes) with lids. I take the larger one to whatever function we are going to and freeze the other 2 (before baking) so that my husband and I can have one to snack on when we watch movies at home or to pull out if we have a few guests one evening. Our kids love it too!

The first time I made this recipe I used non-marinated artichoke hearts and the dip was bland and went uneaten.  It took me a while, but I tried  this again using marinated artichokes and it was fabulous.  I am now required to make this for every gathering!

I made up this dip and said "holy cow, how am I going to use up this much dip?".  so after serving a small bowl of it to guests I decided to use the rest as the cheese filling in my regular lasagna recipe.  It was out of this world - everyone loved it!

This was my first time at making a hot dip and I could not believe my guests reaction...not only did they use up all the bread that I had cubed for the dip, they also used the crackers and the taco chips that were for another dip. There was not a drop left! I am planning on making this over the Christmas Season as my appetizer of choice...did not change a thing!

I made this for a family party and everyone loved it! I used less cream cheese and added a bit of sour cream as some other reviewers suggested. I also added some pepper.  Great recipe!

This dip is soooo good! I was feeling adventurous on mothers day weekend and actually stuffed mushrooms with it. My fiance's family ate the entire pan and it made a ton of them! I'll definitely make this again!

I made this dip a couple of weekends ago for a football party.  It was great, but I did make some changes as mentioned by other reviewers. I reduced the cream cheese by half (only 1-8 oz package) and reduced the mayo just slightly, and added a few dollops of sour cream.  I also reduced the amount of garlic slightly.  I did not marinate my artichokes, just chopped them up and used them plain, straight out of the can, and the recipe was still great and had plenty of flavor.  I used less parmesan cheese and instead I added a couple handfuls of shredded italian cheese blend (Mozzerella, provolone, asiago, etc).  Then I sprinkled more of the shredded cheese blend on top.  It made a bubbly, cheesy top layer that was yum!  You could use whatever kind of cheese you have on hand.  It was delicious!  I served it with little mini-french bread slices that I sprinkled with olive oil and garlic powder and lightly toasted in my toaster oven. Mmmmm!!!  I will be making it again this week to bring to a function at my school...I think all my fellow teachers will enjoy!

HOLY MOLY! This was amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly as described, everyone loved this.  I served it with some French bread sliced thin and lightly toasted in oven, kinda like you were going to make bruschetta - will definitely make this again and again!

This makes quite a bit of dip - which is a good thing if you have many people over, but we had way too much leftovers. Was a very tasty recipe though!

This was amazing.  I got a ton of compliments on it!  I love to make things that are gluten free due to family food allergies,  and this was wonderful to make!!  The only thing I did different was double the garlic, and I added half a medium onion.  I will def. be making this again!!!!

This is awesome.  I have tried many others with little success.  Now I have finally found a keeper.  A few changes I make are, I cook the garlic in a little olive oil, then I add one bag of fresh spinach chopped up, cook it until it's wilted and add it to the cream cheese mixture.  I serve it with the Pita Chips recipe from this site.  It is to die for, I get so many compliments from people and it is the first dip to disappear at parties.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very tasty!  I only changed the cheese, I added a bag of Italian cheese blend into the mixture and parm cheese on top and left out the mayo and doubled the cream cheese.  Will totally make again!  The alfredo sauce makes it super creamy.  Yummy!

Good, not great. Maybe because I didn't use marinated artichokes. I don't know, maybe I'm too in love with my other mayo-based artichoke dip. It was good & people liked it - it didn't fly off the party table as much as my other dishes...

This has become my signature dish for family gatherings and holidays. I use artichokes marinated in garlic olive oil (drained) for extra flavor. Unbelievably good.

This recipe was an absolute hit!  Everyone at the party wanted the recipe.  I cooked it as per the instructions to let it brown and cook throughout and then put it in a crockpot on low to keep it warm and allow guests to eat it at leisure.  A keeper recipe! Thanks!

Made this for a girls gathering and it was gone by the end of the night.  As others have stated, I used 1 pkg spinach, 1 chopped can of artichoke hearts (couldn't find the marinaded ones and I do think that that would give this dish just a bit more flavor), a few shakes of garlic powder, 1/3 c sour cream, 1/2c mayo, only 1 pkg crm cheese, I did use 2 TBSP lemon and didn't think it was tart at all.  Used 1c grated parmesean and about 1/4 tsp red pepper.  Served with corn chips.  Everyone really liked it, but I thought it could of used just a bit more of something extra.  Is quick and easy to make.  I made mine up the day before and baked for an hour at 375.  Would make again.

I followed this recipe exactly and it turned out very sour.  Five different people tasted it and no one was very impressed.  I think if I make it again I'll leave out the lemon juice.

So tasty and such a crowd-pleaser.  I use the marinated artichokes in a jar (12 oz) and add all the liquid from that.  I love the sharp cheese taste from the freshly grated parmesan.  I have also made this using light mayo, 1/3 Less Fat "Neufchâtel" cream cheese, and light sour cream in place of one of the bars of cream cheese.  It is just as delicious as the original!  Perfect crock pot dip for holiday parties.  I serve with tortilla chips and fresh cut veggies.

GREAT RECIPE>>> this recipe is fool proof.  I doubled the recipe for a x-mas party...there wasn't a drop left in the dish.  I served with tortilla chips and toasted bread.  Instead of all the cream cheese, I put half cream cheese and half sour cream.  Also try Romano and Mozz cheese in addition to the Parm cheese. YUMMMMY!!

Good recipie, everyone enjoyed it at my party.  However, I think I might try to experiment a little by using half cream cheese and half sour cream next time to cut down on the cream cheese flavor.  I also used artichokes marinated in oil and drizzled a little of the oil on top of the dip before baking.

I was eager to try this because the reviews were so great.  I did notice there was a descrepancy in the ingredient list and the introductory note from Stephanie -- In the introductory note she mentions that the MARINATED artichokes add a bite -- but in the ingredient list it just called for drained artichoke hearts.  I used Vito marinated artichoke hearts and basically followed the rest of the recipe.  I only added 1 teaspoon of lemon and 1/2 clove of minced garlic. I brought it to someone's house tonight and we all agreed it was much too tart.  I can't imagine what it would taste like with 2 tablespoons of lemon.  If I make this again, I will use the artichoke hearts in water and eliminate the lemon.  It was very, very tart.

I thought this had a good flavor to it, but it was a little thick for my taste.  I would thin it out with milk or perhaps 1/2 cream chees 1/2 sour cream?  I also would maybe add some mozerella cheese for more cheesier taste.  I would make this again with some modifications.

ALWAYS A HIT!  LOVE LOVE LOVE!  I've made this receipe at least a dozen times!  The only changes are marinated artichokes, drained well, and I also add in about 1/2 a cup of grated cheddar/mozza cheese and about 1/2 a cup sprinkled on top once the mixture is spread into the baking dish. 10 stars!!!

LOVED this. I have a super picky husband and he ate almost all of it. I followed the directions as stated but it was super thick so I added more may and some sour cream. I also added a few sprinkles of dry Ranch Dressing mix. It still came out a little thicker than I would have wanted, but it was super tasty. Alot better than what I have had in restaurants.

great dip! I actually prefer it made with a few shakes of garlic powder over fresh garlic. I've also added chopped roasted red peppers to change it up.

Excellent! My guests loved it and have asked for the recipe several times! The only thing I did differently was mix it up and put it in a crock pot, turned out great!! Will definitely be making this again, might take the advice of other reviews and cut the cream cheese.

I thought that this was good but not extraordinary.  I think that the thing I did not like about it was that it had too much cream cheese in it.  Next time I will make it as stated only reduce the amount of cheese to only 1 package, maybe 1 1/2 packages.  Overall flavor was great.  I prefer this recipe to many I have tried, minus the extra cream cheese!

This is an excellent dip! A little fresh basil (chopped fine - 1 or 2 Tablespoons - depending on how much you like basil) is an amazing addition if you like basil. Serve with pita chips or small toast rounds or veggies.

This is delicious as written, but I change it a tad to suit our personal preferences.  I use one block of cream cheese instead of two; add 1/2-3/4 c. sour cream; a handful each mozzarella and cheddar cheeses; plus a tsp of kosher salt.  I like a slightly less-thick dip, so I also add about 1/3 c. milk.  Bake for 15 mins @ 375 and then turn to Lo Broil til lightly browned (about 5 mins more).  Don't overcook the dip since that can result in the oils separating from the dish and causing greasiness.  It really needs only to be warmed through and browned a little.

i've been making this dish for years and i've rated it before, probably with 5 stars.  however, the last time i made it, i thought it was pretty bland.  so i went through and read some of the reviews.  i agress with so many of you that the dish is a little dry.  so, i substituted half of a bar of cream cheese with a little more than half a cup of mozzarella cheese.  i added a little more garlic and lemon juice, and i put in probably two tablespoons of the juice from the artichoke hearts.  i also seasoned it with salt, pepper, and nutmeg.  i could tell before baking it that it was creamier and more moist.  and i think it was the best it's ever been!  i will always make it this way now.....except i'll double the amomunt i make for next time!

This is a great starting recipe, but with other reviewers' advice, this is what I did:  I used the recommended amounts of spinach, artichoke hearts, garlic, parmesan and lemon juice.  I used one  8 ounce block of cream cheese, 1/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup sour cream.  I also stirred in a little cayenne pepper.  I also added in one packet of Lipton vegetable soup and dip mix and I think this is what did the trick for adding the extra flavor that it needed.  It came out perfect for our taste this way.  I really think that soup mix is the "missing link" in this recipe.  :o)

I made this for a Thanksgiving appetizer. I thought it was good, but I used fresh squeezed lemon juice, and the lemon flavor was a little too strong. Next time, I will use 1/2 the required lemon juice. I served with toasted garlic-cheese bread and the flavors went very well together.

Made this for a party this past weekend and got a ton of compliments.  Followed other recommendations and substituted 8 oz sour cream for one of the cream cheese bars.  I also used a combination of parmensan, mozzeralla and asiago cheese blends just because my husband doesn't love parmesan.  I didn't have fresh garlic, so I used garlic powder.  Still tasted great w/all the substitutions!

I could eat this recipe like a casserole.  :)  VERY, VERY good.  I buy the frozen bags of artichokes at Trader Joes (1.99) which you can't beat.  I only use 1 bar of cream cheese and 1 cup of sour cream.  Lastly, I put a good few drops of tabasco for a subtle hint of heat...I mean subtle.  Serve with tortilla chips.  Thanks again!

This is a wonderful dip - everyone loves it and now will request for all family get togethers (which is fine with me because it is easy).  I did use the marinated artichokes (not clear if the recipe called for plain or marinated) and I extended the cook time about 5 min then broiled it so the top browned - which makes a nicer presentation.  I made this again the other day - did not have enough parm. cheese so i subsituted 1/4 of the parm. cheese for the asiago cheese - the reviews came back even higher using the asiago cheese.

I've made this recipe several times and it is always and favorite.  I have served it with cut up pita, triscuits, or crackers.  I also baked the recipe for about 10 minutes then put it over boneless chicken cutlets for another 20 mins.  I served it as a main course.

This was fantastic.  Everyone claims it's the best spinach-artichoke dip they've tasted, and I pretty much agree.  Extremely fast and easy to make, this is definitely a keeper.

Very good dip. I took suggestions from others and substituted a bar of cream cheese with 1/3 to 1/2 cup sour cream, and added a few dashes of ground red pepper for some zing. I skipped the lemon. I made a whole batch so I have some leftover that I'll fiddle with and make a pasta sauce.

I made this for Christmas, served it hot out of the oven and it was gone in no time. I served it with Hawaiian Sweet Bread and torilla chips. It was nice to have it sweet or salty. It is more of a spead than a dip but it was sooo good.

I made this recipe for a get together with my girlfriends and they all loved it. One thing I will change the next time I make it is the amount of garlic I added. I followed the advice by other reviewers and added an extra clove of garlic. The taste came out a little too garlicky for me. Next time I will just put it the original 3 cloves of garlic. After taking it out of the oven I scooped it into a bread bowl and it was delicious. The host wouldn't let me take home the leftovers! A big hit, thank you :)

I made this dip for a party a couple months ago and 5 people have asked me for the recipe! This dip is so good that it is hard to stop eating it! I found that it is a bit messy to prepare, but well worth it. I added a few extra cloves of garlic and it was simply fabulous!

Recipe was easy and yummy. Only used 1 package of cream cheese (light) and added half a cup of sour cream. Used marinated artichoke hearts also. Recipe was slightly too tart and I would leave out the lemon juice next time.

This is the best spinach/artichoke dip recipe I have ever tried!  It is very creamy -- not at all oily like some artichoke recipes can be.  I will make it again and again.  Thanks for sharing, Stephanie!

Yes, the key is the marinated artichokes.  I've noticed other lower ratings used the plain ones.

I put all the ingredients into the food processoranad just made sure I didn't over do it and make it into a paste.  Everone I served it too asked me for the recipe.  It does make a lot though.  I wonder if it freezes well.

This recipe is wonderful! I also add about a 1/4 lb of shredded cheese, what ever you like, (I use Gouda) to make is cheesier. Also delicious with garlic bread! My husband and best friend LOVE it when I make this!

I chopped the spinach and artichoke well as others suggested. Added s, p, garlic p, and onion p. to artichokes.  Used 1 block cream cheese and 1/3 c sour cream. Everyone raved about the dip....the casserole dish was scraped clean!

This is the recipe I have been looking for.  Although I did take others' advice and omit the second package of cream cheese.  I replaced it with 1/3 cup sour cream.  All the other ingredients I kept the same.  I also added Tabasco to give it some kick.... just kept adding drops until I got it to my liking (about 20 drops).  I topped it with monterey jack cheese and baked until brown.  Yum!  By the way, go easy on the garlic.  Add a clove and taste before adding another.  I used 3 small cloves.

I have been making this recipe for years for various functions and it is always on of the first appetizers to go.  I usually use 2 7.5oz jars of marinated artichokes, 3 tsp of minced garlic from a jar, and only 1 1/2 Tbsp of lemon juice.  

In addition, if you plan on making this in advance and storing overnight in the fridge, you'll likely need to extend your baking time.  

One of my favorite recipes!

This is very good as long as you refrigerate it overnight and then reheat the next day.  I ate some right after it was cooked and felt it was bland.  The next day, the flavors popped!  It was excellent.

I received lots of compliments on this dip.  However, next time I make it, I will cut the parmesan in half as it was almost too rich.

I only used one bar of cream cheese and also added 1/3 cup sour cream in addition to the mayo and parmesan.. I used a can of plain artichoke hearts, extra garlic, one box of spinach and the juice of 1/2 a lemon. I also added a dash of salt and black pepper. For the last 5 minutes of baking, i put it under the broiler to get the top brown and the edges bubbly and crispy. It was amazing, better than anything I've ever got in a restaurant! I served it with a platter of yellow corn tortilla chips and sea salt bagel chips. Yummy!!

My first time making dip of this kind and it turned out excellent! Everyone went back for seconds at my wine party yesterday. I reduced the cream cheese to one 8-oz package, mayo to 1/3 cup and added 1/2 cup sour cream. Added a few dashes of salt & pepper too. Baked in an 8x8 pan. Really fabulous with tortilla chips!!

This recipe is absolutely fantastic.  I've made it twice now exactly as stated for various parties and I'm just getting around to reviewing it.  The lemon juice is essential.  I may try adding a few drops of hot sauce just to give it a little kick.

Very very good.  One of my spinach artichoke loving friends told me it was the best one she's ever had and better than any restaurant! I subbed one pack of cream cheese for a small container sour cream.  Thank you and I will make this again for sure!

This was an excellent recipe and even tasted well when it cooled off.  I did double up on the garlic as we like garlic and I cut down to less than half of the lemon juice.

This dip turned out better than the restaurant version. I used frozen spinich and canned artichokes. Had to cook 10 min longer than anticipated to get browned around the edges.  The double-batch I made for poker disappeared. Thanks for sharing this treasure!

This was very yummy and probably would have been even better if I had remembered to put the garlic in :(  However it was kind of too cream cheesey... I think I might cut it back to 1 and a 1/2 packs next time...

This was great. 
I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and light mayo-and it had a nice, rich consistency.
Someone at work said it was the best artichoke dip they'd ever had!

i made this dip for a superbowl party..It was quoted "the best artichoke dip EVER". 
 i added a little more garlic then the recipe called for as well as a little more lemon juice. After baking for 25 min in a dish i transferred it into a hollowed out bread bowl and baked for another 10 minutes or so!!

BIG HIT!! can't wait to make again!!!

I made this dish for my Bunco group last night-it went over really well. I did as others before me had suggested: 1 8oz cream cheese instead of 2 and 1 cup of sour cream. I also added some italian cheese blend on top-did take extra time to brown the cheese. Total baking time was @35 minutes. Easy to make and yummy to eat. I served it with tortilla chips and pita chips and it went fast. Thank you for sharing.

WOW! I made this for my daughter's birthday party and it was a HUGE hit! Everyone loved it! Even my husband who hates mayo and cream cheese. I read other reviews and altered the recipe a bit by using only 1 8oz package of cream cream, adding 8oz of sour cream and only using 2 cloves of garlic. Everyone asked for the recipe. I will definitely be making this again!!

This recipe rocks!  It's easy, quick, and very delicious.  The only concern is don't leave the dip in the oven any longer than 25 min. because the dip loses it's moisture quickly.

I played with this recipe as I like to tinker with everything. I've made the original and found it to be too bland for my taste. This recipe is very forgiving and allows for lots of experimenting.
I used frozen artichoke hearts, an entire 10 oz package, rather than marinated. I figured the oil (in marinated) would be overkill with the fattiness of the recipe. Works great. I also added diced water chestnuts. Makes for a nice bit of subtle crunch. For a kick try adding some crushed red pepper flakes or a few dashes of Tabasco.
 I too halved the amount of cream cheese and added sour cream to the mix. I tasted as I went along until it had the proper tang.
I added grated parm. cheese to the blend, and topped with a bit more. This helped to make everything firmer- as I don't care for runny spinach artichoke dip.
 I topped with a small bit of asiago cheese as well.
 I find that after cooking covered for 20 minutes this dip needs considerable more time to cook, brown and bubble- depending on the amount I wind up with it can take as long as an additional 20 minutes rather than the 5 specified. Especially with the cheeses on top.
Immediately before serving I topped with diced grape tomatoes and red onions for added color and flavor. Otherwise it looks a bit blah in my opinion. The fresh tomato and onion lend a nice contrasting texture as well.
 I serve it up with tortilla chips and my guests go mad and fistfight over it! Yum!Make this and you'll be everyone's hero.

Delicious!  I have been making this dip for years, and I am always asked to bring this to parties.  Make sure you use marinated artichoke hearts, it makes a big diference.

I was a bit disappointed when I first made this because it is way too thick and "white", cream-cheezy.  I expected Artichoke Dip to be "yellow".  But my opinion has changed.  I broght it work yesterday and everyone LOVED it!  I served it with tortilla chips and vegetables.  Great with veggie sticks!

This was an amazing dip, I added 1/2 red bell pepper which added flavor and extra color to the dip. I didnt have frozen spinach so I had to use canned, it turned out a little green but the flavor was still so so good. Overall this was a great recipe, a definate keeper. Thanks Stephanie!

This was pretty good.  We've never had this before, so it was a first.  I'm not sure how it's supposed to taste like.  Anyhow, I followed a past reviews suggestion of reducing the cream cheese and mayo and that's a definite no no.  Because I did that, the garlic was TOO strong.  I then added all the cheese and mayo created and it was prefect.  I served these with crackers, which were fine, but I found it tasted best with my own made chips (tortillas cut into triangles, coated with oil and sprinkled with parm. cheese and basil, baked until golden brown).

Ok, my family doesn't particularly love artichokes and they are not fond of mayo... but the combination of all these ingredients makes your taste buds explode.  I served this as a Thanksgiving appetizer.  My family ate the entire thing... I thought the turkey dinner was going to go to waste... but we managed to eat that too!  Great recipe!

This dip is FANTASTIC although it didn't taste as good as the first time I made it. I used 1/3 reduced fat cream cheese and reduced fat mayo. I think that didn't make a difference, but I forgot to add in a squeeze of lemon. I definitely recommend the lemon and I will put in a dash of salt next time too. Also I used 1/2 cup of sour cream, and I think that was a bit much. I would use 1/3 next time. Also, try this with reduced fat wheat thins! It's to die for!

Absolutely wonderful.  The only change I made was to use marinated artichokes.  Has a nice tangy flavor, and isn't too rich.  I will definitely make this again.

Although I really enjoyed the extra zip the garlic added I found this recipe to be somewhat lacking.  I think that the 2 TBSP of lemon juice is also somewhat excessive and would recommend cutting the amount in half.  All in all, I've had worse, I've had better.

I have made this twice.  The first time I made it as directed with marinated artichokes.  The second time I only had plain artichoke hearts on hand so I compensated by adding a couple extra cloves of garlic and about 1/4 cup more parmesan.  We liked it both ways...Very good and not greasy like most spinach and artichoke dips!

Everyone was eagerly awaiting for this to come out of the oven at my last party.It was just ok-very,very rich and not that flavorful-next time i will add more artichoke and less cream cheese.
However-it was delicious the next day when all the flavors had melded!!

Amazing recipe!  I took the advice of others and used 1cream cheese and marinated artichokes.  I also used 1/4 C miracle whip and 1/4 C mayo in place of 1/2 C mayo.  And definitely chop up the spinach and artichokes.  I took this to a party and everyone loved it.

I also cut the amount of mayo and and cream cheese back to half and marinated the artichokes over night in Olive oil, lemon peel, and provincial herbs. This could also be served with  baked potato.

My Go To recipe.   I add sour cream and I use marinated artichokes.  I also add some of the marinade juice for flavor.   I get asked to bring this dip all the time.

Solid recipe! The girls I had over for a gift wrapping party loved it and all asked for the recipe!  I too tweaked it as reviewers suggested, by reducing to 1 brick of cream cheese and adding in sour cream.  I think the next time I make it I will reduce the mayonnaise to compensate for the 1/3 cup of sour cream.  I used a can of artichokes and thought it tasted a little bland, so I happened to have a jar of artichoke hearts in the pantry so I opened it and added a couple of tbs of marinade and some crushed red pepper flakes, a splash of red devil hot sauce and salt and pepper.  I had to throw away the tiny bit I had left out of fear I would eat it for breakfast in the morning...I was thinking adding it to scrambled eggs would be delish but I decided I had enough and sadly dumped it.  I totally regretted it in the morning though.  Thanks for the recipe!

We loved it! Followed other reviewers suggestions and used 1/3 cup sour cream in place of the 2nd block of cream cheese. We used light cream cheese, light mayo, and light sour cream. Oh, and all we had was frozed creamed spinach, so we used that instead of chopped spinach.

This dip was AWESOME!!! I made it for a party and everyone loved it and wondered what the secret was!  I've made several different dips like this but this one was the best!  I used marinated artichokes and cut them up.  I only used one garlic clove and did not have lemon juice.   It was still perfect!!  Cant wait to make it again!

I liked the recipe a lot and will definitely make it again. I did find it a little bland, however, so will be making changes to kick it up a notch.

Served this cold.  Halved the cream cheese, and added 8oz of sour cream instead of mayo.  Freaking delicious!  Also only used 1/4 c. parmesan!  Yum!

Good place to start but needs soon tweaking. Its too rich.  Will try adding some sour cream and some additional spinach next time. Pretty good though.

Incredible! I didn't have mayo on hand so I subbed sour cream for the mayo and it still came out perfect. Guests thought it was brought in and demanded the recipe when I told them it was home made.

This is my go-to appetizer recipe for years.  The ingredients are perfect just as written.  I always get requests for the recipe. Hint: Let your food processor do all the work for you.  It makes the prep work a snap!

This recipe was awesome, good thing it made as much as it did because everyone kept going back for more.  I did tweak it a little, I followed it step by step but instead of 1/2 Cup of mayo I used 2/3 Cup, and I added a 5 oz. can of water chestnuts (coarsely chopped) and sauteed that with the spinach and artichokes along with only 2 cloves garlic with about a tablespoon of sun-dried tomato pesto and then added it to the cream cheese/mayo mixture.  and my special ingredient was to add a package of Knorr Leak soup mix to the cream cheese/mayo mixture. It was simply heaven on a lightly toasted french bread slice.

This was awesome!  Made it for a card party and everyone raved about it.  Followed some of the suggestions from others and only used one package of cream cheese, low fat, only one tablespoon of lemon juice, and 1/4 cup of low fat mayo. I also substituted italian cheese blend, mozzarella, asiago, white cheddar & provolone for the parmesan (it's what I had on hand) .  I also used a blender to chop up the spinach and most of the artichoke hearts and then hand chopped the rest of the artichokes so it wouldn't be too soupy.  I also sprinkled more of the cheese blend over the top and stuck it under the broiler for a couple minutes till it was bubbly on top.  Served with an assortment of crackers.  Even my friend's son snarfed it down!  I'll be making this one again!

I loved this dip.  I did change up the recipe according to other's suggestions:  1 pkg cream cheese, 1/3 cup light sour cream, 1/3 cup mayo.  I only had 1/2 a jar of artichoke hearts on hand, but the dip was still really flavorful!  My kids gobbled it up.  I served this dip with raw veggies.  I was so happy that my son was willingly consuming spinach!

This is terrific!  It aso makes a good pasta sauce.  If you put in a bit of the juice from the artichoke hearts, a little more mayo (I prefer Hellman`s) a bit of crushed red pepper flakes or use a little pepperjack cheese in it and it`s great over spaghetti or fettuccini-YUUMM!

I looove this recipe. It was my first attempt at making spinach and artichoke dip but it is definitely a keeper. I served it on Christmas day with my inlaws for an appetizer. I did change two things. First, instead of the mayonnaise, I used sour cream. I also used 2 tablespoons of water to the mix. So yummy!

I followed the recipe, plus the recommendations, which were half the cream cheese and replace it by sour cream. I also added some extra spice cause we are hot food addicts. Great recipe though.

This recipe was amazing!  I used both packages of cream cheese and added 1/3 cup of sour cream.  I left out the spinach but I didn't think it was too think after blending with an electric blender.  It was very smooth and delicious!  Everyone felt sick from trying to eat too much!  :)

People loved this at the party I made it for. I used "light" or "fat free" everything and it was still very creamy and delicious. I also put it into a bread bowl on presentation. : )

I make this dip ALL of the time! It is by far the absolute best version I have ever had. Kills the restaurant competition. I usually double the garlic because I love it, and I add at least an extra half cup of parmesan cheese. Like others, I use marinated artichoke hearts, but if you don't have them just squeeze a little extra lemon in if you want more zing. I never understood why tortilla chips are served with this type of dip, since it's not Mexican fare.  I cut pita bread into wedges, brush with olive oil, and toast in the oven for dipping. I have also used oiled/toasted baguettes. The recipe makes a large amount, so if you're not going to use it all it freezes very well. I never get that opportunity, because it is DEVOURED every time I make it! One of my all time fave recipes!

I went to make this dip and I forgot the cream cheese.   I did add some chopped garlic.   Brought it to a party and everybody loved it.  Even without the cream cheese.   I am going to make it again and add the cheese this time-probably just 8oz.

Thisdip was pretty good.  I just love artichoke and spinach dips, but this one had a bit too much cream cheese for me...although let it be known I'm not a huge fan of cream cheese.  If you love cream cheese I suggest this dip for you.  I have a similar recipe that uses only 1 8oz cream cheese and add a cup of mozarella.  The mozarella makes the dip stringy and gooey..I love it.  Thanks for sharing.

Great! Creamy, cheesy, and not overpowering; however, I do use a combination of Swiss and Parmesan. I always get asked for this recipe.

This was pretty amazing.  On a Sunday afternoon I decided to make this on a whim.  I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so the review I am giving is off kilter.  I only had one block of low fat cream cheese, used olive oil infused reduced fat mayonnaise, and a blend of parmesan, romano and mozzarella cheese.  I also used marinated artichokes and very well drained frozen spinach. I also added shrimp and an extra clove of garlic.  This was delicious! I love the lemon juice, it's tangy and goes well with the garlic.  The shrimp was a last minute idea and I was so glad I put them in there. YUM! This is a solid base with many possibilities! Enjoy!

I first made this recipe in 2003 and it's been my go-to hot dip ever since. I make it exactly as it's written, use a mixer to blend well and break up the artichoke hearts and usually serve with pannetini garlic crackers. Everyone always loves it.

I used 1 package of light cream cheese and yogurt in place of the mayo.   Perhaps it was the ingredients, but it tasted too much like the cream cheese.

This was quick and easy to throw together! Everyone loved it! Served it with tortilla chips. The only substitution I made was for the lemon juice. I didn't have that on hand so I added about a teaspoon of Lemon Pepper Mrs. Dash to the cream cheese. Gave it a great subtle zing!

Minutes-this is how long this dish lasted at a happy hour I attended with some co-workers. Serve it with cut veggies and any kind of cracker (I used mixed grain, butter (like Ritz), and cracked pepper crackers) or tortilla chips and the end result is the same - mui yummy! Don't change the ingredients and do serve it cold!

I love this! For the last couple of years I have used a different spinach/artichoke dip recipe, but this was MUCH MUCH MUCH better. Even my mother, who claims not to like artichokes, enjoyed it. This is a new tradition in our house.

This was good but just not favorite way of making spinach artichoke dip. Only about 1/2 got eaten at my dinner party and usually this is the first dip to go.

Delicious - definitely restaurant quality! Make sure you heat it enough so that the cheese melts all the way through. Doing this is essential for getting the right texture. Thanks for a great recipe!

I changed this recipe a little, and I'll probably continue to play with it until I get something I love, but this was very very good.  At a co-worker's suggestion, I cut th e cream cheese in half and added cheddar in its place.  I left the spinach out, and I'll try it in next time.  Very yummy overall.

This is a fabulous recipe with some modifications.  I use 16 oz. unthawed spinach (we like lots of spinach), un-marinated artichoke hearts, extra minced garlic, 1 c. mayo, 1 pkg cream cheese, and I leave out the lemon juice because it makes the recipe slightly sour.  This recipe is a keeper.

Excellent recipe that I have passed to many after they have tried it.  Because I am not a big fan of garlic, I replaced the fresh garlic with a few sprinkles of garlic powder and it tastes great.  This recipe also freezes very well.  I put it in baggies before cooking it.  To thaw, just place in the oven, around 350 degrees for about 20 minutes or until brown, stirring occasionally as it thaws.

Delicious!!!  I made a slightly different version of this dip and then made this one.  The marinated artichokes are the key!  This dip has so much flavor.  This is one of my stand by dishes for get-togethers, always popular.

I've made this recipe several times, and it is always a huge hit. However, being health conscious, I once substituted low fat cream cheese and mayo, and it wasn't anywhere near as good.

Completely awesome!!!  This dip is so amazing.  We eat it with a freshly sliced Baugette--heavenly!  The only thing I change is that I bake for about 5 minutes, and then broil to get a slightly "crispier" top.  Also, sometimes I use the pre-shredded parmesean/asiago cheese mix.  Adds little more zing.  :)

This tastes EXACTLY like the spin dip at the restaurant I worked at in Sandestin.  I used the minced garlic from a jar and just eyeballed it.  I think it was about 2 1/2 tablespoons.  I also used the juice on one lemon.  After the last 5 minutes, I turned the over to broil to get it more browned on the top.  Then, I took it out and topped it with freshly grated parm cheese (which I used for the whole recipe) and stuck it back in the over to melt it.  Everyone LOVED this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving.  Thank you for the recipe.

This is my favorite hot spinach-artichoke dip! I have so far made it at every party I've had in the past year and usually serve it with cocktail breads and blue corn tortilla chips. One little thing I do different is add about 1/4 cup more mayo. So good! You know it's a good dip when your guests are eating it with forks and bypassing the chips/bread altogether!

This worked out beautifully for a big party.  I served it w/ fresh baguette.  Next day I warmed some up on Italian toasts and it was even better. My Mom liked it so much she asked for a recipe, and that is high praise.

Well when I read this recipe and saw the reviews I couldn't wait to try it.  I made it last night for a get together.  I was a little disapointed.  I wish I would have made my good from the artichoke flavour.  Oh well, I don't think I will old stand by artichoke dip.  This recipe was good, I just like my recipe much better.  I find the spinach takes away make this again.

Very good.  I followed the suggestions of half sour cream (light) and half cream cheese (regular) and I added minced (and sauted) 1/2 white onion, a dash of crushed red pepper, the garlic and black pepper.  This really brought out the savory flavors more.

This was so good. I didn't take anything away from the recipe to change it, but did add 3 green onions, finely chopped, 1/2 tsp seasoned salt, and 1 tsp chopped fresh rosemary. I used Neufchatel, and it was perfect. Next time I think a little cayenne or Tabasco would give it a good kick, and maybe twice the rosemary. I'd made it to test on my husband, and was so happy with the results that I'll definetly be making this for the next party.

A friend of mine made this for a dinner party we both attended and OH MY GOSH what a hit!  I asked her where she got the recipe from and was not at all surprised when she said allrecipes.com.  I hoped on line as soon as I got home to print this out for my recipe collection.  The only she, and I, will do differently is to add more garlic.  You can never have too much garlic.  Thanks Stephanie.

I served this dip at our son's graduation party.  We kept it on low in a crockpot for 4 hours, and got rave reviews all night long.  I was asked to send this recipe to a couple of others who attended our party.  I would definitely make this dip again.

I've already made this more than once.  It tastes so much better than the store bought spinach artichoke dip.  I'll admit to adding quite a bit more garlic than the recipe states but I'm a garlic-o-holic.

This dip is certainly delicious but I found it a bit dry.  i served it with chopped tomatoes all over the top which looked beautiful and added a nice fresh taste.  I will make it again but maybe do half mozzarella and half parmesean so it is a little creamier.  But overall a fantastic dip!!!

I brought this to a party this weekend and received rave reviews! I sprinkled extra parmesan on top to melt during baking and served it with sesame melba toast crackers. I will be serving it at a party this weekend too. Yummm.

This is the best tasting artichoke-spinach recipe I have found.  Even much better than any I have had at any restaurant.  Very easy to make. Tried it out on my family this past weekend and they all loved it - told me to be sure to keep the recipe and make it again.  Will be making it for sure over the holidays this winter.  Great Recipe!!!

I made this recipe to take with me to a friend's house for a football game.  It was well recieved.  The recipe does make alot of dip - I have made it twice now for groups of around 6 and always have at least half left over.  I find it a bit too mayo-y on the first day, but it reheats very well (may need to add a splash of milk, and the spnach discolors though).  On the second day the mayo taste is blended in well though.

This is THE best spinach and artichoke dip around and I have many friends and family who would wholeheartedly agree.  I used drained artichoke hearts (NOT marinated) and I definitely advise using 2 tablespoons of lemon juice (give it a nice fresh flavor).  I have to think that anyone who gave this less than 5 stars, made it wrong.  I have made it countless times and it always comes out great.

This is a party favorite.  People beg me to bring this dish to outings.  I take that extra time and chop fresh garlic, and grate that fresh parmesean cheese.  Everybody seems to prefer Ritz crackers over the tortilla chips.  Also, after I pull this delite from the oven I sprinkle more parmesean cheese over the top.  Why go half way with this dish?  I used the regular cream cheese, and mayo.  I figure its a treat, why cut out the calories?  Like my mom always said, "The more calories, the better."
Thank you Stephanie.  Enjoy everybody!

*****WOW- this was SO good- i took it to a party and with loads of other salads and appetizers around this was the first thing to go-- as another reviewer mentioned i seen people eating it with forks instead of chips- i didn't make many changes: i did use marinted artichokes (two-6 ounce bottles) and 1/3 less fat cream cheese, also only 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. this was sooooo good and sooo easy. i made it hours before the party and then just heated it up there- mmmmm
i got so many compliments- my husband asked why i don't make things like that at home for just us 
(because we would eat the entire dish) i will start making this as a regular for future get-togethers THANKS FOR THE GREAT RECIPE!!!!!!!

This dip was a hit at our dinner party!  The only changes that I made was that I used low fat cream cheese & mayo and it still turned out awesome!  I served it with corn chips and everyone raved about it.  I'll definitely be making this one again!

This was a very good recipe, and I will use it again with some slight changes.  I added a 6.5 oz jar of marinated artichoke hearts and used 1/3 c of the juice from the canned artichokes to thin the mixture a little.  I also chopped my spinach again (very helpful suggestions from other reviewers).  I also added 1/4t crushed red pepper.  Next time I make this, I will DECREASE the amount of spinach by about 2 oz.  I found the spinach to have overpowered the artichokes.

As a dip I thought this was just okay. Seemed like it was missing something to punch it up. However, the next day, I used it as a sandwich spread (try turkey or salami on a sourdough roll) and it was fantastic.

another big pary hit.  If you have a large gathering you may want to split the mixture up and put into smaller dishes, that way you bake them at different times or put them out in differnt places at the part.  I noticed the first time I served just one large dish, everyone was mingling around that table,  at the superbowl party this year, I split it into 3 different dishes thoughout the house. Needless to say they left nothing for us to have the next day.

This recipe was a hit with my office co-workers.  However, I doubled the recipe and need to bake it for a longer period.  Marinated artichoke quarters work great!!

I followed the directions exactly, but when I took this to a New Year's Eve party with approximately 50 people, hardly anyone there liked the dip.

I won't make it again.

This dip was awesome!  I've made it at a few barbecues now and its always a hit.  One person was actually just spooning it directly into her mouth!  I've had to give the recipe to many people now because it was such a hit.

This was pretty good, but it was a bit thick for my family's taste.  I made it again but used 1 pkg of cream cheese and about a cup of leftover homeade alfredo sauce (you could use store bought too) and it was AWESOME. Much more smooth and creamy. I also topped it with  parmesan and mozzarella cheese for a nice cheezy top layer. I served this with warmed tortilla chips. It was a hit, everyone loved it and we will definitely make it again.

Not really all that great, but ok.. maybe it's something I did, or maybe the restaurant nearby makes it better.. I will be trying other variations.
Thanks

This was so delicious, great as a party item. A little heavy on the fat side, but
I don't think I am too worried about calories when it comes to snacking on chips
and dips. I've received compliments on this and people ask me where I got the
recipe.

Everyone ranted and raved about this dip. I used a little buttermilk to make it a little creamier and served it w/ crackers and chips. A huge hit!

EXCELLENT RECIPE !!  I USED MARINATED ARTICHOKES AND ONLY USED 1/2 OF THE SPINACH WHICH ALLOWED THE FLAVOR OF THE ARTICHOKES THROUGH.  MUCH BETTER HOT, BUT ADDED SOME ARTICHOKE JUICE WHICH I HAD SAVED TO THIN THE DIP DOWN SOME AND REHEATED.  EXCELLENT ON BREAD, SO SO ON CRACKERS.  THIN DOWN FURTHER WITH ARTICHOKE JUICE AND SERVE WITH VEGGIES.

This recipe won rave reviews at Easter dinner!  It took me more like 20-30 minutes to get it made, and poked in the oven, but... EVERYONE WENT WILD OVER IT!!!!! I'm sure it will be fixed for years to come!

This is very tasty.  A good replica of dips served in restaraunts.  My husband loves it, too.  You can try to jazz it up wit hadditions such as red bell pepper, red onion or jalepenos if you wanted to.  Thanks for the yummy recipe...better than others on this site:)

This dip was the best. There were two artichoke dips at the party and even the lady who brought the other one said that mine was by far better than hers! Thanks for the recipe! :-)

This dip was really tasty although I think it would be better with less cream cheese--it was a little too thick.
Would also be good with a few jalapenos to give it more kick. My family loved it though!

I've fixed numerous spinach artichoke dips looking for a really good one.  This is it!  I used one pkg. regular cream cheese and one pkg. light cream cheese.  Served with toasted crudites, it's wonderful.

This makes quite a bit, so it's best if you're serving to a bunch of people.  It's not that great with nacho chips; crackers or toasted pita pieces would be better.

It was amazing the recene  I did not put 5 starts is because I changed some things and it was a little heavy for my family's taste.
I used 3 types of cheese Parm,mozzarella and Monterey Jack 1/3 cup each. and I used 1 tsp of powdered garlic and I only used 1 cream cheese *which was perfect.* 
next time I make this I will use only 1/3 cup mayo and low fat cream cheese.

Great dish!  My family loves it any time.  I did use only one block of cream cheese along with 1/3 c of sour cream and 1/2 c of mayo.  I added some mozzarella cheese too.    I served it with French bread toasted.

I used the recommendation of others to use one bar of cream cheese and sour cream.  This was absolutely amazing!!  I have to agree that it's better then the restaurants!
I crave artichoke dip and now I have one I can make a big batch of all for ME...yummy!!

This dip is fantastic, I added the 1/2 cup mayo and 1/3 cup sour cream, then I added 1/2 cup parmesan cheese and 1/2 cup mexican cheese for gooey flavor.  This dip could be served cold or hot because its so flavorful and delicious.  I served it with bagel chips.

I’ve made this many, many times exactly as written and it’s always a hit! I’ve switched between mayonnaise, sour cream and miracle whip and honestly love them all. My personal preference is to double the spinach, use marinated artichokes and add a little of the artichoke marinade in place of the lemon juice.

This recipe was a hit at our last New Year's Eve/ Bowl watching parties!  I took some of the other reviewer's suggestions and cut the cream cheese in half and added 8 oz of sour cream.  WONDERFUL!  I even used low-fat everything and you could not tell at all - my husband would have been the first to point it out and he said not to change a thing even after I told him!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this yesterday and it was SO yummy!! I did cut the cream cheese down to one package and instead of 1/2 cup mayo I cut it down to 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup of sour cream. I also only used 1/2 cup parm cheese and for the other 1/2 cup I used a shredded italian blend.

it's a 5 star dish if you make these changes: - use just ONE package of cream cheese - ditch the mayonnaise for non-fat greek yogurt, but use 1.5 cups of non-fat greek yogurt in its place (MUST be greek yogurt because it's thicker than regular yogurt and has the consistency of sour cream)  my family gobbled this up straight out of the oven within 10 minutes!

This was not what I was looking for and the use of a jar of sauce is always a put off for me. I will keep looking.

I followed the advice of others - less mayo and a little sour cream.  I combined everything the night before and baked it the day of the party. Guests loved it!

Delicious! I Used the exact recipe, I loved the taste. The only thing different I used was a sprinkles with mozzarella cheese after baking, let sit in the oven to melt over... very tasty! I agree, It's better than most restaurants :)

This was pretty good. If I liked parmesan cheese more, I would have loved it. Others loved it, but I found the parm too strong. But that's just me. It was a big hit and not a scoop was left in the dish!

I make this one all the time-I always use fresh lemons and sqeeze 2 or 3 in it!  It gives it an interesting kick at the end!  I serve with Blue Corn tortilla chips for color and people love it!

I LOVE artichoke dip - and this one is great! I am not a fan of spinach, so I chose to omit it from the recipe - but I'm sure if anyone else likes spinach then you will enjoy it here. The dip was creamy and delicious and had a really great flavor to it. I dipped Parmesan pita chips and it was a perfect pair!

VERY delicious but VERY rich, I used regular cream cheese but if you don't want the dip as rich use light cream cheese i'm sure that will make a HUGE difference!

I've been making this recipe as submitted for at least 4 years now - ever since the first time I made, friends and family have been requesting it for each and every holiday and potluck. My only change is that I just use the juice of one lemon rather than measuring 2 tbsp. - so I might use a little more than that. I just wanted to comment that it is DELICIOUS as is, I have given out the recipe umpteen times, marinated artichokes are needlessly costly for this with all the other flavors, and yes this is much better than any restaurant version I've ever tasted!

Delicious!  Be careful not to over bake as the dip becomes too stiff and it does not adhere well to chips and/ or bread.

Good base recipe.  I used half the cream cheese and added 1/3c sour cream per all the suggestions.  It was delicious. The recipe doesn’t call for a lot of seasoning so I added Italian seasoning and crushed red pepper. It turned our great.  It makes a lot so it would be perfect to bring to a party or pot luck.

I made this recipe with only one exception because of other reviews I thought sour cream sounded yummy. BUT I didnt have sour cream so I added a 1/2 cup of sour cream ranch (light) dressing.   This was an amazing appetizer! Definitely a hit. I have to say I LOOOOVE garlic and this is definitely a strong garlic dish. I understand not everyone loves garlic like me so next time I make it I may tone it down, but no one complained about it. I got all raves and the dish was almost gone. As others mentioned it feeds A LOT!! so if its for just 4-6 people I would half it.   Thanks for sharing I loved it :)

This is the best! I didn't have the marinated artichokes. So I just added a little Italian dressing and use sour cream instead of mayo. Added salt, pepper and cayenne with an additional onion & garlic powder. Took to a party and everyone wanted the recipe.

This was the BEST spinach artichoke dip ever!!! I have made it twice now and everyone (I mean everyone) absolutely loves it.  My boyfriend couldn't stop eating it.  The only changes I made was using fresh spinach from our garden, and used marinated artichoke hearts, and shredded parmesan cheese instead of grated.

Did it just as written. Didn't like this dip at all, and I love artichoke and spinach, and dips that have both those things in it too!! So disappointed.

Very good dip! I also cut the cream cheese in half, and added a little sour cream, but if you want a more creamy and thinner dip the 2 pkgs of cream cheese is fine.

This was a great dip recipe.  I followed the recipe above, except I used hearts of palm instead of artichoke hearts.  After I baked the dip, I put it in a crockpot to take to a family gathering.  It dried out a bit, but I just kept adding a little bit of milk to loosen it up.

I really liked this dip.  I definetly altered though and would recommend it.  I used 1 brick of cream cheese.  I also only used 1/4 c. of mayo and used 1/4 c. of sour cream.  I wanted my dip extra spreadable and added about 1/4 c. of milk. It came out perfect.  I then sliced a french bread baguette loaf and brushed it with olive oil and sprinkled with garlic then baked them 10 min too.  I spread the dip on the bread and it was a hit.  I will definetly make this again.!

Fabulous dip! I omitted the mayo & added an 8 oz. container of sour cream instead. I also used marinated artichokes (& chopped the artichokes into small chunks) & added a little of the marinade into the dip to make it not as thick. I also added a dash of salt and pepper. not even sure if it needed it though.  Definitely made a large amount, which was great since I was taking it to a party.

Big Hit!  I needed a quick, easy spinach artichoke dip recipe since I knew I would have only limited time to prepare for a week-night gathering.  This recipe called for minimum ingredients and had great ratings.  Due to time constraints, I did not read review suggestions and simply followed the recipe to a tee.  My first attempt at spinach artichoke dip and several people ended up asking for the recipe!   I have read some of the suggestions and next time I will try a few of them including lowering the cream cheese content, adding sour cream, adding mozzarella or italian cheese blend, and maybe using marinated artichoke hearts for a little extra flavor...just to see how that turns out.  But once you go changing all of that, it's not really the same recipe, now is it?!?!   If you need a quick, easy recipe AS IS, this one does an A+ job!

This is perfectly heavenly. Don't believe any of the reviews that tell you otherwise! The only thing I did a little different was to save a little of the parmesan to sprinkle on top, then broil for the last few minutes to get a bubbly browned cheesy top.  Oh, I also used 1/3 less fat cream cheese and you would never know the difference. Several people asked for the recipe.  Note: if you are bringing this to a party you can also heat it up in a small crock pot instead of baking and that works great. If you are really in a pinch you can microwave it and then transfer it to the crock pot to keep warm.

Made changes recommended by others- used only one block of cream cheese and added a couple spoonfuls of sour cream.    Even better reheated the next day!

Perfect recipe, a real success last saturday night. My friends loved it and left with the recipe. As suggested, I used less mayo and a bit more cream. Also used Ricotta instead of cream cheese (healthier).

I love love love this dip. I finely chopped up one red and one green bell pepper into it to give it some nice color and crunch. I also sprinkled some cheese over the top so it would melt on to the top. It's gooey and fattening and fabulous.

This was excellent and exactly what i was looking for, I did make a couple changes I used 1 package of cream cheese instead of two, and sprinkled finely grated swiss cheese on the top before placing it in the oven. Tastes like it came from a restaurant!

YES, you've had it a thousand times. YES, it's sort of slopish. YES, it's bad for you. But it tastes --SO--DARN--GOOD!-- What's a girl to do, except to tuck it into her secret arsenal to use over and over and over again. (tips: only use 8 oz. cream cheese, and supers-queeze the water out of the thawed spinach)

Yummy bubbly dip. Spread on some good french bread. I added more garlic cause that's what I love. Add some jalapenos or red chili pepper flakes if you like it to have a great kick!

Wonderful dip with a great flavor. I love the fact that it's not hot too.

I added an 8 oz can of jumbo lump crabmeat to this, and omitted the lemon juice (left everything else the same).  AWESOME.  Did stir it after the first 25 minutes, then baked an additional 15 minutes to get the whole thing hot.  My new "go-to" crab dip recipe.  Thanks so much.

I make this for parties, and everyone loves it.  It is a great recipe.  I slice French bread very thin and bake it until it is slightly crispy to serve it with.

I love to make this dip.  It's fantastic comfort food.  I add some sour cream in place of one of the packages of cream cheese sometimes.

like other reviewers suggested...i cut the cream cheese down to one package and replaced the second with 8 oz. of sour cream. i also cut the mayo down to 1/4 cup and threw in some crushed red pepper flakes for a little extra kick. fantastic!! i think it tastes best when served with roasted garlic bread from the supermarket bakery.

I've been making this recipe for a few years now. It's the first thing to go at all my parties.  I add 3/4 cup of sour cream and only use a little bit less than 8 ounces of cream cheese.  I also double the spinach to two 10 oz packages.  It works great in the slow cooker on low for a few hours and keeps it wardm for the party as well.

This is the best dip if you are ever hosting a party. First, it tastes delicious, everybody loves it, and best of all it CAN be made the day before, unbaked, and kept in the fridge. Its AWESOME!

This is good but I am still looking for an unbelievable one. It does have the right amount to spinach and artichokes porpotion to the rest of it. Maybe some more garlic would do the trick.

I like to omit the garlic and use garlic swirl cream cheese as opposed to regular. I use half the lemon juice called for and use about 3/4 c. parmesan cheese and 1/4-1/2 c. cubed cheddar. 

Everyone always adores this dish and I hand out my modified recipe very often.

I used frozen "creamed" spinach, made this dip even more decadent. Served with plain tortillas and carrot sticks. A comfort food par excellence!

Very good. I've done it with neufchatel instead of cream cheese, to cut down on fat, and the taste is still good. I've also used it as a side dish instead of a dip. Guests love it.

Excellent!  I love restaurant artichoke dips but rarely like the ones I make at home.  Thanks to this recipe, I have discovered that it's the FAT (cream cheese) that makes the difference.  This is thick and creamy and delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly and the dip was the hit of my New Year's party.  Next time I may add more parmesan, or put an extra layer of swiss or monterey jack on top to make it extra cheesy and gooey.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe did not go over very well. It was okay, just not great. For one thing, it was a little too garlicky for us. I decreased the lemon juice in half, but the dip still had too lemony of a taste for us. I am not sure what this recipe needed, but it needed something. Even though many said this was better than restaurant versions, I do not agree. The restaurants I have gone to had much better spinach artichoke dips.

Excellent flavor! Everyone loved it! The only reason I'm only giving 4 stars is because I thought it was a little bit dry. I may add a little sour cream next time, or possibly more mayo to moisten it up. However, the way it was was excellent and it got rave reviews. A keeper!

EXCELLENT! Followed the recipe exactly and was outstanding. The lemon did not make it sour out all, don't leave it out. Marinated artichokes definietly made all the difference. And it wasn't too think at all. After cooking, I put it in a small crockpot on low to keep warm. One of the guests liked it so much he asked to eat it with a fork! Cannot wait to make again!

I can not say enough good things about this recipe!!  Even if you don't think you like spinach or artichokes, take a change with this recipe, you won't be let down! Much better than any spinach artichoke dip in restaurants.  I wouldn't change a thing.

This is MY go to recipe for spinach dip. I get rave reviews every time I make it, someone always asks for the recipe, and there are NEVER any leftovers. I tweak it sometimes, other times I make it exactly as written. When I do make changes, I add some finely diced red onions and in place of the mayo I use half unflavored greek yogurt and fat free sour cream. I like it best with the changes, but no matter what, it will always be a hit!

Awesome dip!  This is a winner for parties.  It always goes quickly. I've been asked for the recipe everytime I've served it.  I serve with "Gold" tortilla chips.

This was fantastic!!!  I made it for a baby shower and actually used my slow cooker since I needed my oven.  I put it in for an hour and a half and then browned it for a few minutes and everyone raved about how good it was!

This recipe is fantastic.  We brought it to a family gathering and everyone enjoyed it.
Everything was perfect except the prep time.  Both my husband and I put it together and it took us 30 minutes.  So maybe we're just slow or the prep time might be a little off.

Tasted good but the consistency was too thick - I tried adding some sour cream and it helped a little.  If I were to make again, I would omit a bar of the cream cheese and add sour cream and more mayo instead.

This is easy to make and is a huge hit at parties.  If you promise to bring this dish, you can get an invitation to anything.  Experiment with what you dip into it- vegetables, bagel chips, tortilla chips- it's all delicious.

I made this for a family gathering on Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  I didn't have any lemon juice, but it still turned out delicious.  I warmed it up the next day and wrapped a scoop in some wheat pita bread, it was excellent!

This is ABSOLUTELY the BEST spinach/artichoke dip I have ever tasted!!!  It's a thousand times better than any spinach/artichoke dip that I have tasted in a restaurant.  I cannot count the number of times I have made this dip over the years, have passed it on to friends/family and EVERY time it's a hit!!!  I often substitute the fresh minced garlic cloves with 3 teaspoons of garlic powder and it is STILL the hit of a party!  A DEFINITE keeper...

This is such a great dip!  I've made it several times and it the bowl is always scraped clean!  I did notice a big difference between using freshly shredded parmesan cheese versus the pre-grated kind.   It's so much richer when fresh ingredients are used.

Really good. I followed the recipe exactly (although I did extend the baking time a bit) and it was a hit at my cocktail party.  I served it with crispy baguette slices that I drizzled with olive oil and baked in the oven.

I really liked this. The only change I would make is that I would chop up some water chestnuts and put them in for a little crunch. It was a big hit at our superbowl party this year.

I made this dip for my Christmas Eve party this past year and it was INCREDIBLE!!  Since then, my family members request it at gatherings and have requested the recipe too.

No big reactions from this dip. Just your basic creamy dip. I think some sort of addition would be nice to make it "pop". Perhaps sundried tomatoes or water chestnuts or extra herbs and garlic.

This recipe was excellent! I served it at a candle party full of woman and it was GONE in about 15 minutes. I served it with homemade french bread and they just loved it. I handed out the recipe to a number of them and got phone calls that they just love it. Thanks Stephaine for sharing!

I made this dip for a birthday party, and followed some of the other reviewer's suggestions: I used 8 oz. of light cream cheese, and 8 oz. of light sour cream...and topped with extra parmesan cheese and about 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese during the last 5 minutes of baking.  It turned out good; everyone tried it, but it wasn't gobbled up.  This is perhaps because of the fact that there was so much food present, but in the end I had almost as much dip leftover as I had started with.  I enjoyed this with tortilla chips, mini pita breads and melba toast, but suspect that it would go over better with breadsticks and crackers, as Stephanie mentioned in her recipe description.  May make again; I'm not 100% sure. It is SO rich!!

Unbelievable on toasted galic bread. I add a Tablespoon or two of milk to make it a tiny bit creamier and I bake it in low dish so it can bake evenly.  Do not leave it too long in the oven or it will look a little curdled instead of creamy.

This was excellent and very easy to make.  I added more Parmesan cheese which made dip a little thick--but the flavor was very good.

I LOVE this recipe, I've been making it for the past six months and the only thing I don't do is add the lemon juice. Every time I make this for potlucks or get togethers everyone loves it and it's one of the first things to go!

SO GOOD!  I'm a huge fan of Spinach/Artichoke dip....this one was so easy to make!  I halved the recipe, used whipped cream cheese, and put a layer of shredded parmesean on the top to brown while baking.  Also, I served with tortilla chips and thinly sliced italian bread.  BIG HIT!!

I have tried all sorts of artichoke dips but this is the BEST that I've found (It tastes a bit like the spin-art Earls Restaurant serves).  I added a bit of salsa to it...because I like tomato.  Make sure to soften the cream cheese first!

This is sooo yummy! I'm a big fan of Olive Gardens dip like this and this one is sooo much better. I made this twice.. one exactly like it said and I found it a little too bitter and not creamy enough but dont get me wrong still very good. 

So I did 1 8oz thing of cream cheese and 1 8oz thing of sour cream, then I only put a little splash of lemon juice for taste. I also used crushed red pepper for seasoning. 

It was a HUGE hit at my party! :)

Excellent dip. I took the advise from others and replaced one of the cream cheeses with 8 oz of sour cream. You can also leave out the spinich if you are looking for a plain artichoke dip and it turns out very good.

Made this for the first time last night and my guests loved it!  I made it with two jars of marinated artichokes and one medium size garlic clove. Also, used two smaller containers for better presentation. Topped with a little more parmesan cheese and broiled a little to brown.  Wonderful!

Made this for my daughter's citizenship party and it was wonderful. I added 6 oz. of crab meat, a little crushed red pepper, a sprinkle (or 2) of cayenne pepper, and about 6 oz. of shredded Italian cheese (bag of mixed cheeses). I put half the mixture in the baking dish, then a layer of half the Italian cheese, then the rest of the mixture and topped with the rest of the Itailian cheese. I served it on homemade melba toast. It was the best spinach dip I have every tasted.

This was a hit at our last party.  It took longer than 20 min, maybe because the spinach was still a little frozen, but still it turn out perfect after a few more minutes.  Everybody loved it.  I'm making copies of the recipe for my co-workers today.

Not as good as the reviews would have you believe, in fact I didn't care for the overall flavor of this dip very much, but my husband thought it was OK so I gave it 3 stars instead of 2. Followed the recipe exactly...tastes nothing like restaurant quality spinach/artichoke dip.

I LOVE this dip!  I have altered it a bit over the 2 years that I have been making it.  I am asked to bring it to parties all the time.  It cooks well in a crockpot and then keeps well for parties.  I have begun making it with fat free cream cheese and fat free mayo.  It freezes wonderfully.  I make up a full batch and place half in a baking dish and half in a freezer baggie in the freezer.  I don''t even need to thaw it out, I just place it in a baking dish straight from the baggie and cover wiht foil.  I add up to 30 minutes to the baking time but this allows us to enjoy this dip more often.  Baking it in smaller amounts is the way to go!
Hope that this has helped you!

Very good. I only used one package of reduced fat cream cheese, and I left out the lemon juice. I used about 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and about the same of onion salt. Marinated artichoke hearts really gave it a nice flavor.

When you say that this is the first to go at a party you weren't kidding!  I took it to a party last night, in which there were many others dips there. As soon as it was uncovered at the hors d'ouevres table, it made the guests salivate.  In no time, the guests had devoured my dip, and left the others untouched.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  I didn't change a thing!

Absoutely delicious! I forgot to make the servings smaller so I made too much but it was gone in three days. It was so thick, you can eat only so much. But My best friend came over, a picky veggie lover, and ate a ton of it with crackers. I also used the leftovers to make veggie quesadillas. I just quickly grilled the tortillas and added reheated dip. You can also add Chicken and they are yummy. This recipe came out to be very versatile!

Recipe was nice, but I was looking for something with a bit more spice and the garlic just didn't do it so next time I think I will try adding some jalapenos.

This dip was awesome!  My guests were commenting that it was so good they could eat it as a meal.  I tried another reviewer's suggestion and used 8 oz. of cream cheese and 8 oz. of sour cream.  I had a block of Romano cheese, so I shredded some into it and also topped it with some grated parmesan cheese.  I broiled it uncovered for the last 5 minutes to brown the top.  It probably would be just as good as written also!  Highly recommended, very easy to make, and will become a regular in my household.

This dip in fantastic.  I've done alot of entertaining this holiday season and have made each time with rave reviews.  The last time I got a little creative and rather than 2 8 oz. containers of cream cheeze used 1 container and also 8 oz. of Monteray Jack cheese for a little extra "za zing".  Never any leftovers...

Once I make this for family or friends, people beg me to bring it again.  It is always a hit.
We like it with Tortilla chips - scoops are best.

**Edit**  I have been making this recipe for a number of years.  It is by far the most requested dish for, and from our house when we have a gathering.  I add a touch of cayenne pepper to add some zing.  
Very easy and oh so yummy.  The whole family loved it.

This recipe definitely deserves the five-star rating!  This is by far my favorite spinach and artichoke dip.  It is so easy to make - I sprinkle a few tablespoons of grated parmesan on top before baking.

I took this recipe to a wedding shower and it was a huge hit. People kept going back for more and telling me how much they liked it. Many of them said that they didn't even like spinach normally! I did use the marinated artichoke hearts and it did seem to add a good flavor. I also added about 1/2 cup of monterey jack cheese and decreased the parmesan cheese to about 3/4 cup. This is a great recipe!

It might have been the wheat thins I served this with, but the flavor wasn't fantastic, although I think if we use milder crackers the dip would be a lot better.  I used marinated artichokes and that was nice.

This is a great dip...  Add some juice from artichoke hearts or it will be dry. 
It is great in a bread bowl or with crackers, I even liked it with tortilla chips.  I made a double batch last time and refrigerated some of it to finish a few days later because I knew I would be craving it when it was gone.

Great recipe! We liked it both cooked and uncooked(after setting a while to blend ingredients and flavors).  It can become rather stiff and may benefit from a little olive oil or water when that happens.

Good.  It really is more of a spinach dip than an artichoke dip.  The flavor of the artichokes is overpowered by the spinach.  Still, it's good.

This was fantastic. Better than any "restaurant artichoke dip" I have ordered anywhere. And you can eat as much as you want. Added 05/16/06: I am STILL making this on a regular basis for party's and get togethers. It is always the best thing there and gone way too fast.

I doubled this recipe and took it into work fora potluck. And although I was asked for the recipe by several I honestly didn't think it was GREAT! It was good... but I did some serious doctoring as it seemed WAY too thick/heavy and actually rather bland to me. I added lots of seasoned salt, garlic powder, another clove or two of garlic, and an additional 1/4 cup mayo.

I was really excited to try this recipe after reading all the rave reviews of it. I am pleased to report that it has lived up to it's reputation. I pretty much followed the recipe, except for I halved it and I used a well-drained jar of marinated artichoke hearts instead of the canned ones indicated. I think the marinated chokes may have made the recipe even more delicious. I can't wait until Thanksgiving. I know my family will devour this one! I served it with toasted french bread slices and celery.

I made this for our New Year's Eve party - and it was a huge hit!  Everyone raved about
it, even people who admittedly don't typically like spinach or artichokes.  Several people
commented that it was the best they had ever eaten, even better than from restaurants.
As the recipe makes a large amount, I would recommend it for larger crowds.  Fortunately,
it reheated well the next day and became a wonderful bowl game snack.

I thought this was a rich and satisfying dip for munching and watching the Superbowl. Since I always read the reviews about this dip being bland and oily from the mayonnaise,( that is why I love Allrecipes!) and since it was just hubs and,I I reduced the ingredients by half,I added 1/3 cup of sour cream to cut down on the oily mayonnaise as well for extra creaminess. I added,and 1/2 teaspoon of Everything Bagel seasoning which, sounds like a odd combination,but it really kicked up the flavors for this dip. I served this with black sesame crackers,and carrot sticks and sliced jicama. I think next time,I make this dip I'll add a teaspoon of grated onion and 1 can of mild green chilies for an addition yet not spicy flaver combination. This dip can be forgiving with adding flavors without sacrificing taste.

This was a huge hit after Thanksgiving dinner for a large group of guests. I doubled the recipe and served this warm with a choice of torn artisan rolls or Wheat Thins. I had fresh spinach on hand so I substituted chopped fresh spinach (no need to blanch) for frozen spinach and used real lemon juice. I tried a bag of Italian cheeses which was a combination of mozzarella, provolone, asiago, parmesan, romano, and fontina. I was generous with the garlic and added a bit of chili powder to pump up the flavor- I actually didn't taste any spice so I'll try adding more next time. You can heat only what you need a little at a time, or reheat the leftovers, which we are looking forward to eating today!

I absolutely loved this recipe! Perfect amount of everything. I layered it on top of chicken breasts and baked them together. I made it into a meal lol. 
I baked the chicken for 10 mins initially, took it out, layered the “dip” on top of the chicken and topped it with more parmesan. Popped it in the oven for another 12 mins and then I turned on the broiler for maybe 6 mins (rotating the pan every 2 mins) to get the perfect brown top.

I didn’t have marinated artichokes so after I cooked  my frozen ones in the microwave and chopped them, I tossed them with some vinegar. 
Salt and black pepper’d the mix and I used onion and garlic powder on the chicken.
I also used  light mayo. This will be my go to spinach artichoke dip from now on..... 10/10

just got done making this and I am not to impressed. first off 3 cloves is way to much garlic. second the bake time is more like 40 minutes not 20 at least for me. I'd watch it if I were you mine was still cold after 20 minutes.  I am personally going to try some other recipes to find something more impressive.

I had fresh spinach from the local market but not enough mayo so I used ranch dressing.  I sautéed the spinach and added cheeses to melt. Yum.

This was delicious! I did make some changes based on all the reviews I read. I used marinated artichoke hearts and 1 block of cream cheese (not two)like so many others. I used 1/3 c mayo and 1/3 c sour cream. I liked it best on crackers while my husband preferred tortilla chips.

I have both made this recipe as written and I have also made it with alterations. First, as written, it has a wonderful flavor-- it's just really thick and hard to dip a chip in without breaking it off. Since then, I have subbed in sour cream for half of the cream cheese. This makes a much creamier dip. I've also made this with double the cheese or with a mixture of Parmesan, Romano, and mozzarella and have never regretted that move either. I love to play around with recipes and this one is very adaptable.

oh my, oh my but this is scrumptious!  I looked for a recipe that didn't contain alfredo sauce, as I don't like that.  I followed the recipe as written and don't find it bland at all!  I used shaved parm and probably added 1/2 cup more, and 3 large cloves of garlic.  I used my mini food processor to chop the chokes and garlic, and this was a quick and effective way to get them small dice. After mixing with a hand mixer, I  decided to taste it and was blown away!  I realized I had forgotten the lemon, didn't know if I would miss it but I have to say that after adding the juice of one lemon, it really brightened this and I think it brings out the flavor of the choke.  I wouldn't skip the lemon.  I can easily see where this could be served cold, or just nuked to warm it up.  I truly see myself bringing this to many functions, and have to stop myself from eating this whole thing!  thank you so much for this recipe.

This was a good recipe! I made a few changes: I used half the cream cheese, and instead of 1/2 cup mayo, I used 1/4 cup mayo and 1/4 cup sour cream. I seasoned the spinach with salt, pepper, and onion powder. Next time I may use an extra garlic clove (for a total of three).

Great recipe, though I like stuff a little spicier so my changes: halve the cream cheese and add 8oz sour cream instead, double the garlic, use marinated artichoke hearts, and some red pepper.

This is my most-requested dish every Thanksgiving for our "while the turkey is cooking" snacks.  We serve it with pita chips and crackers.  The picture here does not do the dish justice.  I put it under the broiler for just a bit, and it's really beautiful out of the oven, nicely browned on top.  Yummy!

Very tasty. My guests loved it.  I think my slow cooker runs hot.  It got a little of dried out after awhile. I am accustomed to serving my normal artichoke dip out of my slow cooker throughout the event.  I will have to tweak it a bit to make it work for me

This was delicious and I wouldn't change a thing about it.  The measurements were perfect and the consistency was great. This is my favorite recipe for a spinach artichoke dip. I served it to my guests and they raved over it and it was so easy.

Made it exactly as noted for New Years Eve. After everyone tasted it, we all agreed it needed more garlic. So when I reheated it, I added some garlic salt and stirred it up. Tasted soooo much better.

This dip was absolutely fantastic and so easy to make. I considered the many comments previously made and used marinated artichoke hearts instead of plain ones, as well as 8 oz of sour cream instead of mayonnaise and only one 8 oz package of cream cheese.  Instead of the Parmesan I substituted 2 cups of shredded 4 Cheese Italian Blend and added a splash of white wine. This is the best spinach artichoke dip I have ever had, even if we did make it ourselves. It was so delicious, my daughter and I made it twice between Christmas Eve and New Year's. Everyone loved it

The best artichoke dip I've made.  Always a hit and even my husband who is a big fan of artichokes loved this dip and asks for it all the time!

My first attempt at making a spinach artichoke dip, and my friend said it was the best he'd ever had.  I served it at a New Years Eve party and it disappeared fast.  The only changes I made, per other reviewers' suggestions were a) using marinated artichoke hearts, and b) adding a small amount of sour cream.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

Absolutely excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly, I used marinated artichoke hearts and it was completely polished off.  I actually liked it better than any restaurant dip I've ever had.

This was ok.  Not the best I've made or eaten.  I probably won't make it again, but it wasn't bad.  Other people liked it, but it wasn't creamy enough for me.

This was fantastic and a hit with all my friends!  I took some of the user suggestions, and agree.  I only used 1 8oz package of cream cheese, and added 1/2 cup of sour cream.  I used marinated artichokes also, but washed the excess oil off with hot water in a colander.  I added almost double the amount of artichokes, and a little less than the suggested amount of spinach.  I also re-chopped the spinach for easier dipping.  I mixed in some other Italian cheeses (romano, mozzarella, etc) and wasn't shy on the lemon juice for extra zing!  A very tasty treat!!!

SUCH an excellent dip! I took advice from other reviews and used a bar and a half of cream cheese and about 1/3 cup sour cream. I served this in a bread bowl...came out wonderful!

I have to be honest... I'm not a huge fan of any artichoke dip but I make it for other people whenever I go somewhere and almost every time someone will say that it's the best spin dip they've ever had.  I substitute sour cream for the mayo though.

Absolutely amazing! I prepared this and hollowed out two (1 pound) loaves of Sourdough bread and served it as a bread bowl dip. Everyone filled up on this so much that it was difficult to tear us away from it to enjoy the turkey for Thanksgiving..

This was my first attempt at artichoke dip and my only question is this....why didnt i start making this years ago? I have always ordered it in restaurants and this recipe is easy and at least equally as good. I did use suggestions from others to halve the cream cheese and mayo and add sour cream. I think the key is to use fresh grated parm. served with blue corn chips for a delicious appetizer. Was well recieved by my guests.

This recipe is excellent as is....not sure why everyone is changing it!  I let the cream cheese soften for a couple hours and then use an electric hand mixer to blend the cream cheese with the lemon juice and mayo - then just stir in the rest of the ingredients.  Using fresh lemon juice is key....i also throw in the zest from the lemon!  Excellent!

It is great! Sometimes I use artichokes and sometimes it's just spinach dip. I do use half the mayo and half sour cream.

Made this for a potluck and it was a hit. I skipped the lemon juice, because I didn't have any, added a 1/4 cup of sour cream and real shredded parmesan cheese. I used two cloves of garlic instead of the three and the dip had plenty of garlic "punch".  Maybe if my family is really nice, I'll make it for them.

This was great! I didnt have any lemon juice, so i skipped that part. It was great! I added a few table spoons of sour cream since i didnt have enough cream cheese and it was great. The cream cheese really makes this dish and there wasnt a lot of really heavy mayo like most other recipes. The garlic was great!

Made it last night for the first time - had guests over. We raved over it. Definitely a keeper. Did not alter anything - perfect as written. I did, however, let it bake 10 min. more to get the sides crispier. Next time, I might even put the broiler on for a couple of minutes.

This is awesome.  I don't put mine in the oven.  I put it in a small dip crockpot and let it heat up that way.  I've never met a person who didn't like it and my husband says it's way better than anything in restaurants!

This recipe was fabulous and much easier than the ones I've made in the past.  The first time I made it I didn't have any artichokes so I spiced it up with extra lemon juice, garlic and Monterey Jack cheese.  It gets a little thick as it sets so I put it in the crock pot on low and it was a huge hit at our last poker party.

Skipped the lemon juice as I did not have it and also added red pepper flakes. It was very very good! I could have eaten the whole pan by myself.

I made the following changes: used marinated artichokes, chopped them well, reduced garlic to 2 cloves and used one pkg cream cheese, 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup of miracle whip.
Got rave reviews. Have made it twice and will make it again.

Great recipe.....I tweaked it with chopped red onions and double the garlic...I love garlic and extra parmesan and mozarella....also added fresh lemon juice instead of the bottled stuff..

I really loved this recipe, i did cut the mayo down to 1/4 and added the sour cream and left everything else the same. I used this with the Pita chip recipe off this site and it tasted great. I also used some of the dip and wrapped up into the crossiants and baked as directed and that was yummy also a great finger food!

I followed this recipe exactly, and it was way too much like a spread instead of a thinner dip. I wanted something a bit more like the artichoke spinach dip at Applebee's. This was too thick, and basically just tasted like cream cheese with garlic. I'd cut back on the cream cheese next time.

This was delicious! I read a few reviews to decide what kind of revisions should be made, but most just said to leave as-is, so that's what I did. The only problem I had was that it was VERY thick. I might cut out 1/2 of a block of cream cheese next time and add some sour cream or mayo in its place. Other than that, it was great and everyone loved it!

Great recipe!  I didn't change a thing!  Very easy and quick to make.  I drained the spinach so that the dip doesn't turn out too runny. People often ask for the recipe when I bring it to potlucks.

This has been my "go-to" recipe for spinach artichoke dip for years now - ever since I found it on here 5 years ago.

Changes I make are to add more spinach and artichokes, use neufchatel (light) cream cheese, hot sauce, lots of freshly ground black pepper, and freshly ground nutmeg (nutmeg goes great with greens).

DO NOT OMIT THE LEMON JUICE as it is what helps cut down the richness of the cream cheese!  In fact, I sometimes add red wine vinegar instead of lemon juice as the acidity helps to balance the flavors.

I put everything in my crock pot and the dip stays hot throughout my parties.  I get in trouble if I don't make this for every party I attend!

If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would.  I substituted half of the cream cheese with sour cream and my family said this was restaurant quality!

This is such a perfect dip for parties. Everyone asks me to make it for any get together. It is thicker than the traditional restaurant Spinach dip but it is sooooo much better. It is even good when it sets for a bit! I will usually serve Ritz crackers with it to hold the dip, I found that corn chips will always break.

This is very good - just as tasty as any spinach dip I've ever had.  Made with reduced fat cream cheese to try to off-set some of the richness.

Pretty good spinach dip.  I did add Lawry's seasoning salt to give it some additional flavor.  I've made it several times for parties and I always get compliments.

This was sooooo good and gooey. I did rinse the artichokes before cutting them. Used only 1 cream cheese, added 1 cup shredded jack cheese, added 1/3 cup sour cream, and about 4 tsp hot sauce. It was gone minutes after I served it.

Just OK. Made this for Christmas Eve.  Make sure you don't puree the spinach or the artichoke hearts and that it remains chunky.  I omitted the mayo and used sour cream as others suggested.  The guests ate it but I've had better.

I made this dip according to the recipe, and it was very popular with my guests.  I prefer a little more flavor, but I love artichokes so it was still good enough for me.  I think a good romano cheese would punch it up a little, too.  
I served it with baguette slices and blue corn chips.  Only crumbs and the baking dish were left.

I love this recipe.  Just made a few revisions to suit my taste.  Omitted garlic since my stomach can't handle it.  I always use a box of frozen creamed spinach in place of chopped frozen spinach.  No draining. Used a jar of marinated artichokes and a 1/2 can of plain artichokes. Reserve the oil from marinated ones.  I use some at the end to flavor since I don't add the garlic.  It really needs this extra punch with no garlic.  I love cheese so I add about a cup of whatever cheese I have on hand.  Monteray jack, colby-jack, mozzarella, just nothing too strong.  Still top with parmesan.  Just got asked again today to bring it to a house warming.  Enjoy.

Awesome! One substitution: I used low fat yogurt rather mayonnaise.  I simply do not like the way it tastes and it is also a healthier option. It was delicious!!

Awesome! Added 1/3 cup sour cream to the mix and omitted the lemon juice as others suggested. I put the marinated artichoke hearts (drained), the garlic and the spinach in a food processor before adding it to the mix. It was AMAZING. As a heads up make sure you drain the artichoke hearts, if you add the liquid they are packed in the the dip it will be too salty. I served it with pita bread and raw veggies. What a hit! I will definitely make this again and again and again.

This dip is so good. Even my kids love it. I also used drained marinated artichoke hearts that added an extra kick. Fabulous!

This dip was delicious and very simple to make. Next time I would try the others suggestion of substituting sour cream for the 2nd package of cream cheese. It turned out a little thicker than I would have liked.

This recipe is awesome. The only change was I did not use lemon juice I added 2 tbsp of water. I also added a bit of red pepped flakes. Love it! It did take about 40 minutes to cook!

Tried to prepare the day before and bake for the superbowl the day of.  Too gunky and sticky.  I guess don't try to prep ahead?  It's very thick compared to some other restaurant recipes I've tried in Colorado.

Excellent recipe!!!  Everyone thought I bought it from a restaurant and put it in my own dish to take credit for.  I served it with homeade tortilla chips (lightly oiled tortillas, cut, baked in oven) from the tortilla chicken soup recipe (on this site).  Pita wedges would be good too.

This recipe is sooo good! Last year our daughter was in the hospital over Christmas and I made enough dip for the day and night shift of doctors and nurses in the unit. The night shift was lucky to get some! I serve this dish with fresh sliced foccacia bagettes, very yummy. This recipe is always a hit!

This is a really good recipe that you can change up very easily.  I have made it with marinated artichokes and plain artichokes and I have people who have asked me for the recipe for both kinds.  I prefer it with marinated artichokes, but I have friends who love this recipe with the plain.  Great recipe!!

FANtastic recipe!!  I'm always looking for ways to cut calories and fat, so I used other reviewers' suggestions: replaced one of the packages of (low fat) cream cheese with nonfat sour cream; used marinated artichokes for extra flavor.  I also divided between 2 8x8 pyrex dishes for a party, but it came out quite thin (in depth, not consistency).  Next time I'll pour all into one 8x8 dish.

I made this for my Christmas party and everyone loved it! Within the first 5 minutes I had requests for the recipe. The only thing I changed was I used 1/2 mayo and 1/2 sour creaminstead of the full amount of mayo so it is a little lighter

The perfect recipe!! We add two extra garlic cloves, and the cooking time is a little off.  It always takes us about 40-45 minutes to bake.

Good dip!  However, I did the advice of others and cut the cream cheese in half and added sour cream.  It turned out delicious, but still a little cheesy.  I'll have to play with it a little more next time I make it.

I used 1 head of fresh  artichoke. I boiled it then chopped it up. I used lime juice since that was all I had. And I forgot to add in the Parmesan cheese, so I added it after I finished baking it. It was still good. Since I already had something baking in the oven at 400F, I put the covered pan on the middle rack and baked 15 minutes covered and another 5 minutes uncovered. My friends loved it. One of my friends said that it was better than the artichoke spinach dip from California Pizza Kitchen, which was her favorite at the time. It disappeared pretty quickly. We ate these with tortilla chips.

Very popular at the potluck I went to.  Everyone raved and all of this dip was gone before anything else.  I served it on chips but my batch came out a bit thicker than I expected.  Crackers may have been a better choice than the chips. This is a keeper!

Careful with the lemon juice!  I started with two teaspoons but it seemed to still need something.  So I added the rest the recipe called for and it was way too lemony.  I'll try the cayenne someone mentioned and stick with only two tsp lemon juice.

Absolutely an awesome recipe!!  I had everyone asking for the recipe. I used the suggestion of another review to use 1 cream cheese and 1 cup of chedder.  I sprinkled some parmesan cheese on the top after I uncovered it.  Great recipe!!

I made this for my fourth of July get together.  This was a sure hit with everyone.  This recipe was the best spinach and artichoke dip I've ever had.  Can't wait to make it again.

OMG-- I have made this so many times now. I took it to a school party and all the ladies loved it. I even had to send a school wide e-mail with the link to this dish. It is so easy and even tastes great when you half the recipe. My boyfriend now thinks this is the only dip I know how to make because I take it to every party!  I love it! LOVE IT!

This dip is ABSOLUTELY DEEELISH! I don't even like spinach very much and I gobbled this up. I recently served it at my housewarming party and it was gone in about 30 minutes. The only thing I changed was I only added one 7oz. can of artichokes instead of a 14oz. jar (seemed like plenty if you chop them well enough). I ripped up and broiled a large roll of French bread to serve alongside the dip. This had so much texture and flavor! I was so pleased and I will be using this recipe in MANY parties to come. Thanks!

I made this for my son's graduation party and everyone loved it.  It makes a crowd size amount and there was quite a bit left over. I asked if anyone wanted to take anything home and that was what everyone chose.  It is great.  Much better warm from the oven.

Perfect! Haven't ever had a better one at a restaurant. I like to use one normal cream cheese block and then one neufatchel block in order to cut some (albeit just a little) fat and calories. I always eat it with tortilla chips. I've had several people ask me for the recipe.

This is really good. Brought it to a party as an appetizer and everyone seemed to love it.
I cooked it longer than recommended because I wanted the top to be golden brown vs. lightly browned.

This recipe is great!  I doubled it for the Super Bowl and everyone raved about it.  I did take in to account some of the other reviews and added 4oz of sour cream and instead of 2 10oz pkgs of spinach, I used one 16oz pkg.  With this modification, it didn't come out dry at all.

This dip was great the only thing I would do differently is add more garlic, because in my opinion you can never have enough garlic. I also used fresh spinach rather then the frozen stuff.

It was a hit for sure! It tasted very sinful even though I used the low fat stuff!

Excellent!  I took out one of the cream cheese and put in a cup of mozzerella instead.  So so good.  Definitely will have to make again.

Whenever I make this recipe it disappears within minutes! I always get requests for a copy of the recipe too. This appetizer is scrumptious enough to eat on its own as a main course. I like to serve either thinly sliced french bread or crackers with this. Excellent submission by Stephanie S.!!

This recipe is definitely the best.  I don't usually put in the mayo (maybe just 1 TBS) or sour cream as it really doesn't need it.  I prefer a thicker consistency.

Delicious!!  Easy to make and it was a nice change in flavor.  I served it with toasted baguette that was flavored with olive oil and a little garlic.  We had no leftovers at all!!

This dip is very good - if you are only making this as a snack for 2 or 3 people, definitely halve this recipe as it makes enough for a party (which I'm sure was the intention).  I used fresh grated parmesan cheese, which was quite strong - next time I will probably use only 1/2 cup.  I recommend adding a 1/2 cup first, tasting it, and adding more if necessary.  My strong parmesan was a bit overpowering, but the recipe is still good.

The only problem with this is that it makes a lot for just two people. However, it is so much better than the dip you can buy at the supermarket.

I absolutely loved it!! I followed the recipe to a T and it was a huge success. Everyone at the party loved it. I was trying to find the perfect spinach and artichoke dip so I made several different recipes and everyone concurred that this one was by far the best. The only alteration I will make next time is that I will use sour cream in place of the mayo--just a personal preference. However, the recipe 'as is' is delicious!

This ALWAYS goes very fast when I bring it to parties.  I do though add more cheese and throw some on top during the last uncovered 5 mins.

I changed the recipe by adding another clove of garlic, salt and pepper.  I substituted a 8 oz of mozzarella cheese for one of the bars of cream cheese.  This was too clumpy so I added a tablespoon or two more of mayo.  What made this so great was the extra garlic, salt and pepper.  The best artichoke dip I've ever had.  Others have been too bland.

This had mixed results. Some people really liked it. Other people wouldn't even taste it because there was spinach in it. Personally I liked it but probably won't make again.

I just started a new job and quickly learned that everyone here likes to eat a lot and everyone brings in things to share, so I wanted to make a dip to bring in and found this recipe.  It was devoured instantly!  I was asked for the recipe a number of times, and gladly shared it.  Thanks!

This was wonderful.  Better than any restaurant version I've had.  Took it to a party and it was a hit, mang.

This stuff is great.  I did follow someone's suggestion about using 1/2 marinated artichokes.

I am going to try to use this recipe for the 1st time.  I bought the ingredients and purchased "shredded" parmesan cheese. Will that be okay to use rather than "grated: or shall I buy the "grated.  Please help - I need to make the dip Tomorrow afternoon.

this recipe is delicious!!  I make it ahead of time and put it in the fridge until I'm ready to bake and serve.  Everyone always loves this dip.  I do cut the garlic down to 2 cloves instead of 3.

This is so wonderful!! I found myself eating it before the party. I used only 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and light cream cheese and it was amazing. I put mine in a small crockpot to bring to the party. It was a BIG hit!

So many people rave about this dish and ask me for the recipe.  It is so yummy!  The only change I make is to add extra parmesan cheese on top before baking.

This is an awesome dip, definately rating five stars! Taste like something you'd find in one of your finer restaurants, and easy to make. The only slight change I"d make is to decrease the garlic just a bit.

This was great.  Restaurant quality for sure.  My guests all loved it.  I served it with tortilla chips.  If you choose to serve it with crackers, don't use anything too delicate.  The cream cheese makes this a fairly dense dip and you'll break your crackers trying to scoop.  I will make this again.

I am asked to make this for every party or dinner I go to.  I do a lighter version, less greasy, a few tablespoons of mayo only and 1 light sour cream small container and 1 light cream cheese.  I use fresh grated romano and parmesan cheeses, very little.  I double the garlic and I also add 1 can of crabmeat for a different spin on it once and awhile. YUM!!

Excellent florentine artichoke dip!  I may use 1/2 canned artichoke hearts and 1/2 marinated artichoke hearts, but was very good as-is.
For a little extra pop, add a dash of worcestershire, a healthy dose of salt and black pepper, a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, onion powder, and a bit of dried parsley flakes.  I add these items and stir into the dip as I'm removing the cover for final heating/browning the top.

Very tasty but a little too much garlic.  A few guests at the party commented on it so next time I'm going to use 2 cloves.  I'm definitely making it again- and will probably top it with some fresh grated cheese.

I made this as an appetizer for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it!  The only thing I changed was instead of using all cream cheese, I substituted half with sour cream and it turned out very well.  I would make this again.

This sounded so good but it didn't really turn out for me. I actually found it to be very greasy, unlike some of the other reviewers. I may try it again and make sure I do everything exactly right.

I love this recipe! I made this for a party and not thinking, I doubled the recipe.  The doubled recipe filled a  9x13-inch baking dish. I knew I'd have tons of leftovers but had very little.  Everyone loved it, too.  More than one person told me how they loved how the different flavors blended together. Thanks for this great recipe.

I made this for work function and everyone raved about it.  I used onion and Garlic whipped cream cheese and sour cream and put in some shredded pepper jack cheese.  Next time I make it I will add more pepper jack cheese to give it more of a kick. I mixed everything together the night before then cooked it in the morning before going to work.  Every bit of the dip is gone and I made two batches, one for home and one for work.

Fantastic Flavor! My Husband and I are HUGE artichoke/spinach dip fans. We try it everywhere we go. This was by far some of the best! Very creamy and flavorful. Easy to prepare too! Thanks Stephanie

I went online the day of a party we were throwing, desperate for a florentine dip, and found this one.  Stephanie isn't lying- this dish really WAS the first thing to go!  Easily, the best dip of its kind I've *ever* tasted!

I used some sour cream in place of half the cream cheese along with extra spinach (4/5 oz more) because I really enjoy a thicker dip.  It was excellent!!!!!  Restaurant style.  Also, use marinated artichokes...the flavor really bakes through.  I used Pecorino Romano cheese instead because I wanted a sharper flavor.

I made it for a snack party and it turned out to be pretty good.  However, I felt guilty eating it (all that cream cheese).  This is not for fat and calorie conscience people.

This is a wonderful recipe. I served it with blue corn chips, which made for a colorful presentation. It was almost all gone at my son's birthday party and I made double the amount that I needed for the number of people. Yum! I did add mozzarella as others had suggested.

This dip was AWESOME!!!! I made it with 1- 8 oz package of cream cheese and 8 oz of sour cream. I added the parmesan cheese and also 1/2 cup of monterry jack. After the dip came out of the oven and I tasted it, I felt like it was still needing something. I added some crushed red pepper and a can of crabmeat and stuck it back into the oven for a few more minutes.That totally did the trick! The dinner guests devoured it in no time!!! Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this dip for a family gathering and it received many compliments.  I altered it a little by adding a jar of marinated artichokes with the canned artichokes (for extra flavor), added pepper and resereved some of the cheese to sprinkle on top before baking.  Excellent!  It makes a very generous amount too.

This was GREAT - I made it for a party, and it went over really well.  I followed some other suggestions and decreased the parmesan and added some shredded Monterey Jack, which made it a little richer and gooeier.  I even thought it was good before I baked it!  I would definitely make this again - I served it with Tostitos Scoops chips.

This was AWESOME!  Tastes as good if not better than any Artichoke Spinach dip I've ordered at restaurants.  I used Guacamole flavored Doritos for dipping.  YUM!  Thanks for the recipe!  It will be used frequently at our house!

I thought it was very good.  I made it ahead of time, then popped it in the microwave to heat when I was ready to serve it.  It makes a huge batch, so if you need just enough for 8-10 people, I would cut the recipe in half.

Recipe turned out excellent.  Took it to a party and everyone loved it. However, I did drop one pkg of cream cheese and replaced it with about 8 oz. mozzarella cheese.  Still turned out great!

WOW!!This was wonderful! Made it for a family get together at New Years and the whole dish went fast. Only thing I did different was add about 1 cup of grated Montery Jack cheese to the mixture. Every thing else I left the same. I did not think that it had too much garlic like others said and goes great with the Tostito's scoops.

This is the best dip ever.  I made it in a regular casserole dish and when it was done cooking I scooped it into a bread bowl and baked it for another 5 min.   Sprinkle some grated cheese over it at the end.  It was awesome!

I made this for a Christmas Eve party, and hardly anyone touched it.  I love garlic, but I thought 3 cloves of garlic was WAY too much.  However, I might try this recipe again with a couple adjustments.  Next time I will try roasting the garlic first, and using marinated artichoke hearts.  It also needs a pinch of salt.

I decided to add 1/2 cup of onions, 1/2 tsp. of crushed red pepper, and replaced 1 of the cream cheese, with sour cream instead. The sour cream thins it out, so that it is not so rich.

Made a double batch of this lastnight.  Great flavor and really easy to throw together.  Forgot to add garlic, so I threw in some garlic powder at the end, did the trick.

I never thought I liked spinach, or artichokes, until I tried this. Now I am addicted! Trying all kinds of recipes with both now. This is great served with Tostitos or if you are on Atkins, like me and the rest of the U.S, roll some up in a ham roll! I prefer this recipe over any I have tried in a restuarant.

Everyone always asks for the recipe when I bring it to gatherings.  I use two jars of the marinated artichokes, juice and all.  Also, it is very convenient to transfer the dip to a crockpot and keep it on low so it stays warm while we graze!

This was my first attempt at a spinich and artichoke dip.  Everyone really liked it.  I like chunkier avacados so next time I will probably use more and not chop them so fine.  It was also very thick so next time I will use less cream cheese and maybe take the suggestion of adding a touch of the artichoke juice to thin it out a bit.

This recipe never fails me.  I have made it for numerous functions and it always is the first thing to go.  I only put in 5 oz. of spinach and one tbsp of lemon juice.  I also add a little garlic and onion powder and some seasoning salt.  Great recipe!!!

I used reduced fat mayo and cream cheese for this recipe and grated asiago cheese for the parmesan.  I wasn't that impressed with the results.  Next time I think I'll do it full fat, use parmesan, and a bit of salt.  I rated it four stars because I think if I use the original ingredients it will be really good!

Excellent dip!  I also added only one pkg. of lite cream cheese.  Then I added another pkg. of frozen spinach since it becomes very creamy.

Great Dip! Very easy to make. Serve with sliced baguette. I have made this dip at least 20 times and I have given out this receipe at least 2x that. I always make this the day ahead and increase cooking time by about 8 minutes, then I broil the top for some browning.
The ONLY change is I increase the amount of garlic (4-5 cloves) and lemon (usually 1/2 to 1 lemon). I do it according to taste- I like it "lemony" and "garlicky."
It IS the best dip!

This was great! It was very easy to make and everyone who tried it asked for the recipe. I brought it in for an office snack and it was gone before the morning was over. One person in my office said it was "restaurant quality." I will definitely make this again.

This is definetly not a dip for kids!  I made this one along with another dip when I had company over.  This dip was barely touched...only 2 adults tried it and I didn't see them going back for seconds.  I was the only one that liked it.  I don't think I will make it again unless I know it will just be an all adult party.

Yummy!  I used fat-free sour cream in place of the mayonnaise, and for the cream cheese requirements, I used one 8 oz. package fat-free cream cheese and one 8 oz. package neufchatel (1/3 less fat) cream cheese.  I also found 1/2 cup (2 oz.) of finely grated parmesan-reggiano cheese to be plenty.  Everyone loved it.  My husband said that next time I make it, I should leave out the lemon juice, but I did not mind the slight tang.

This recipe is great! I've made other artichoke dips with mayo as the main ingredient, and while very good, it is too greasy.  This recipe is PERFECT! This was by far the most popular appetizer for the holidays.

Wow! This dip is so awesome! It's an easy appetizer to make and tastes like I spent hours on it!  My husband and I sometimes have this dip as a late night romantic dinner with a bottle of wine. So excellent!

This was a great appetizer!  I put it into a large bread bowl I made and broke the insides up to dip into it- yum!  I used miracle whip instead of mayo, but it was still absolutely delicious!

This is by far the best artichoke dip recipe i've tried....and i've tried many! It is now in high demand by my co-workers and friends. I used a combination of water packed and marinated artichokes to give it extra zip.  FABULOUS!

Yummy!  I made this for guests to snack on while I was finishing up dinner and everyone loved it!  They went home with the recipe and the little bit that was left-over.  Even my veggie-hating 2 year old loved it.  I'll make it again and again just to get some veggies in her!  Great recipe!

Very tasty! Next time I will try to substitute some low fat ingredients to avoid some of the guilt that goes along with eating this!  Taste better than some of the restaurant dip I've had.  Definately a keeper!

The BEST!! So yummy! Very strong garlic. I do reccomend reducing garlic by 1/2 at least. (and I love garlic) But it was very very good!
This tastes great serves hot or cold. I served them on sliced baguette, also very tasty on saltines. Heck, I think it would taste great on ANYTHING!

This was great! it's one of my favorites to order when we go out to eat. I added a little as I always do I never copy a recipe completly. I used marinated artichokes that were spicy and also a 1/4 cup of lump crab. It was fantastic.

This is a fabulous recipe, and I will make it over and over.  I made it for the first time as an appetizer for our Thanksgiving dinner, and served it with plain melba crackers (Old London brand). Even the children loved it.  I found that I was one 8 oz. package of cream cheese short, so I increased the parmesan cheese by an additional half cup, and increased the mayo (I used Miracle Whip) by a half cup, and it was still PERFECT!  Since we're such a bunch of garlic freaks, I also doubled the amount of garlic called for.  Mmmmmmm... awesome!

This dip was really good.  I used marinated arthichoke hearts and roasted garlic.  Next time I will try to add more mayonnaise to make the dip have a softer consistancy and a bit of cayenne to give it a kick.

This dip was good, however it was really really thick, so we had to use spoons to put it on the chip or carrot. It was kinda chunky, and didn't turn out to be like a dip, at least as I know it.

Wonderful!! This recipe is the best I have found. Took it to a house warming and as soon as the hostess set it down she tried it and insisted on the recipe immediately. I cut down a little on the garlic--took it on the 4 serving from 3 to 2 cloves because of the children. It was great!

I've made this several times already and I am always asked for the recipe.  It's the best!  It tastes great hot and also once it cools to room temperature.  I recently brought another dish to a potluck and everyone was disappointed because they thought I would bring my famous artichoke dip.

Great and easy.  I wasn't as big of a fan as everyone else that was at the party and ate
this dip.  All the guests at as much of it as they could.

I was very disappointed with this dip. It took a very long time to heat up, even at 375 degrees which a very high temp. There was nothing fabu about it, I can't see why there were so many rave reviews. I checked the recipe a few time thinking that I forgot an ingredient but did not.

This recipe turned out fantastic. I made it for Easter and it was a big hit with people who didn't like spinach or artichokes. Even someone who is very picky about her food loved it. I used sour cream instead of mayo and added 1 cup of monterey jack cheese. It had a great flavor. I think next time I will try pepper jack cheese. I served it with tortilla chips, salsa and sour cream.

I tried melting swiss cheese on top, which was pretty good until it started to cool off and the cheese got hard.  Very good dip overall.

Wonderful and delicious recipe that I will continue to bring to or serve at my own parties. I substituted low fat mayo and low fat cream cheese and it tasted great - lots of people went back for seconds. It may be too "garlicy" for kids. Highly recommend.

This recipe was easy to make in the food processor.  Before baking, I divided it into thirds, as it makes A LOT, and froze two containers.  We just pulled one out and microwaved it.  It was wonderful!  Excellent to keep on hand for a quick appetizer.

This recipe was quick, easy and fabulous!  We ate it with tortilla chips but bread would also be good.  I'm going to start keeping the ingredients on hand so I can whip it up whenever we have company.

It was wonderful.  I actually wrung out the spinach (like a rag) and then pressed it between paper towels.  I added shredded mozzarella on top when I removed the cover that way it would brown while cooking the last 10 minutes.  Yummy!  I froze half for my next party.

I have been dying to find the perfet spinach/artichoke dip.  I thought this one was really good.  My husband thought it was good.  It may have been just a tad cream cheesy, but I would definitely make it again.  I must say, it sure DOES make a lot.

My husband had "the guys" over to play cards and I whipped up this dip.  I thought they were going to fight over the last bit!  One guest swore that he hated spinach, but licked the bowl clean!  This is our new favorite dip!
