Excellent. I rolled mine out on my counter with extra confectioner sugar. I was able to take my donut hole cutter and cut out little circles. I coated in chocolate. Everyone loved them. I even split half the dough and mixed coconut flavoring in one half. I will be making this recipe again and again. Thank you for sharing.

We decided to make butter cream, peanut butter, and coconut cream eggs for Easter.  We liked this for our butter cream egg recipe, but were slightly disappointed with the somewhat cream cheese flavor in them, which you don't find with most butter cream eggs.  I personally like them, but will probably try a different recipe next time that doesn't call for cream cheese (or not as much of it) for butter cream.

Everyone loved these butter cream eggs. They are really good. Putting into fridge for two hours twice is the only time consuming part of this recipe. And I used my deviled egg plate to size up my eggs with. It was fun.

Really good!  The filling is not overly sweet and has good flavor.  Will definitely be making these for many occasions.
