I usually dont eat pork - it comes out SO DRY. But this was wonderful. I did change the soy sauce to half soy sauce and half worcesterchire. I also had less than half of a package dry onion soup mix that I tossed in the marinade. I did the marinade for 1 hour and I put my broiler on low and the pork on a lower rack, this way it cooked about 10 mins per side (i kept close watch) then put close to the heat for less than a min to get a little crisp on top. It was perfectly cooked. VERY moist, and I would do this again. (OH I also tossed in a pan for less than a min to brown on all sides)

Didn't change the marinade at all. But my pork chops were 2" thick. So I marinated for 5 hours, then browned them in pan 1 minute each side, put in a casserole dish with about 1/4 cup of beer to keep them moist. Baked at 375 for 45 minutes. Boyfriend doesn't want them any other way now. He raved about them 2 hours after dinner.....!

These were absolutely delicious... I only marinated for about 45 minutes, but my chops were very thin. Also, I used my Foreman grill, since I was using my oven for something else, and they were done quickly and oh, so tasty!!! Tender and juicy!!! The taste was not at all overpowering after 45 minutes, although they were very well seasoned... These will now be in permanent rotation on my weekly menus!

these were excellent.  Used this marinade to get rid of some pork chops in the fridge, and my boyfriend was still raving about them the next day.  I also added 1 t. ground ginger and 1 t. Hoisin sauce and a dash of lime juice to the marinade.  Definetly will make this again!!!

This was fantastic!  Being a super involved mom of 3, I didn't have a lot of time, and was looking for something that could be prepared quickly, easily, and with as few ingredients as possible.  THIS did the trick.  Everyone ate it, liked it, and said we'll have to have this again.  The only thing I did differently, was I didn't marinate the chops for more than about 15 minutes TOTAL, and this still turned out moist and fabulous!
Thanks!

This is the BEST marinade that I have ever tried for pork chops, and I am VERY picky!! I have made this numerous times now, and my family LOVES it when I make this. These are soooo good under the broiler, its the next best thing to grilling them outside. I added fresh chopped garlic, which I personally prefer over minced jarred garlic. If you are using thin chops, you may not want to marinate them quite as long as suggested in the recipe or they will be a little salty. Great recipe and so simple!

These pork chops came out AWESOME! I added a little bit of teriyaki sauce, used garlic powder instead of minced garlic, and added a little bit of maple syrup for sweetness. I ended up marinading in the fridge for nearly 2 days, but my hubby and sis-in-law said they were the best chops they'd ever tasted. Will definitely be making these again. Thank you.

This marinade is simple and really good. I had not broiled anything before and was surprised how quick these chops cooked and how yummy they were. I did take other comments into consideration and used lower sodium soy and added brown sugar to the marinade. I marinaded really big pork chops for 10 hours and they were delicious. My husband raved about them and wants to grill them next time.

Yummy! I added some olive oil, garlic powder and italian salad dressing. My son that hates pork chops went for seconds! We marinated this for about 10 hours or so and then grilled the chops, served with garlic mashed potatoes, salad and crescent rolls, very simple and delicious!

I know I have a winner on my hand when even my spoiled brat step children, like what I cook.  This was excellent.  It was moist and sooo flavorable.  This is the first time in my life that I ever made a pork chop worth eating.  LOL!  I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and added a little maple syrup, brown sugar and teriyaki sauce. I was also running a little short on time so instead of marinating for 12 hours I only did it for about 4.  This recipe is a definite keeper.

Doggone it, really wanted to like this one.  We only use low sodium soy sauce, so based on reviews, thought that would overcome the negativity.  Prepared as written, and it still was way too salty for us. Had to eat pizza instead.  I feel really bad because I have never given a 1 star review, but if we couldn't eat it, then that is the rating I had to give.  So sorry.

Taste was good, meat was still a little dry, but was far more moist than any other time I have made pork chops. This will be my go to for pork chops (EDIT: I found a better recipe that I will probably use more because it was SO juicy, but may experiment with adding these flavors to it since the flavor of this was good). I sauteed some onions with a little bit of brown sugar to top the pork chops, the sweet flavor really melded well with the savory flavor of the pork.

This has to be my all time favorite pork chop recipe now.  It was so easy.  I marinated the chops in Teryiaki sauce instead of the soy, also I only marinted for an hour and they were PERFECT!  Great recipe, this will be a staple in my household!!!

These pork chops are so juicy and tender. I only marinated for about an hour and used an electric grill as my broiler does not work. Thanks for posting!

My husband really liked this one.  I used the basic marinade, but changed the cooking method up.  First of all I used fresh garlic.  I used thin cut porkchops so I only marinaded them for 4 hours.  I lightly dipped them in flour and pan fried them until golden brown.  I will make this one again.

I've made this recipe twice, and my husband has LOVED it both times. He says he'd give it 10 stars - and that's coming from someone who's not a pork chop person. As far as he's concerned, it's the only way for me to make them! 

It seems to work well with both boneless and bone-in chops, and I've marinated it for anywhere from 3 to 5 hours with great results. I also use lite/reduced sodium soy sauce for it, fresh crushed garlic and freshly ground pepper. Per one of the other reviews, I threw in a dash of ground ginger as well.

I just don't get this recipe.  Obviously, very, very easy  to prepare but we felt the soy sauce just took away from tasting any flavor of the pork.  Just a tip to those of you that said that your chops always are too tough - it is because they are overcooked.  Pork should NOT be cooked to the point of being well done (a tinge of pink in them is fine).

This is definately the simplest, most juiciest way to serve meat!  My family as well always expects whatever I serve to be dry like heck (which is why I chose this recipe - for the title) and boy were they surprised when I made these chops!  I've also cooked steak this way and it was FANTASTIC.  My picky son who hates meat, eats everything when I use this marinade. I am in awe!

OHHHHHHHHH This is good.  My little 2 year old who doesn't usually eat her meat ate it tonight :)  I only marinated it for 2 hours as I only decided to cook it at 2.30, but it was good, I will definately be cooking this again.

This recipe was fantastic!!! My family hides when I say I am making pork chops for dinner. I openly admit that I am a horrible cook when it comes to pork chops. I came to this sight for some help and found this recipe that had simple ingredients found in almost any home. I gave it a try and my family raved about the flavor...and so did I. I urge everyone to try this recipe. Simple, easy perfection! Yummmm... Thanks for posting this one!!!

I really hate to give a low rating but I got to. 

I made recipe as written.  There was no way 1 inch chops would only take 5 mins each side so I already knew that, so that wasn't a problem. 

However, after 10 mins each side, the chops were awful.  I ended up baking in the oven in a covered casserole.  No issue with the flavor, just the cooking. 

So sorry.

Too salty!  My chops were 1/2" thick and I marinated them for at the most 2 hours.  While the chops were moist, my family and I thought they were too salty.  I would only use low salt soy sauce.  I don't think you actually need 1/2 C of soy sauce either.  Seemed a little wasteful.

These were wonderful! I only marinated them for about 4 hours because of time constraints but my family really liked them. I also added 1/4 tsp of chinese five spice to the marinade. This added a pleasant taste. I will make them again.

This is a really great recipe. The salt in the soy sauce brought out the flavor in the chops, and kept them from drying out in the cooking process. Plus, I love garlic. I threw them in the fridge, and two days later needed a quick dinner, and there they were. I do mean quick, too! The boxed rice took longer. My chops were a little thicker than I thought, because I had to add 3 minutes cooking time on each side. However, it was only the second time I broiled and I forgot to let the oven warm up. Thanks for the great recipe! I will be using it again, and I wonder how it would taste on other cuts of meat, including beef.

This recipe was awesome as a base marinade for pork chops. The 4 stars instead of 5 is because I made a few changes but as is it's a awesome recipe. Here is what I did: 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce, few dashes of smoke flavoring and pepper, some Teriyaki sauce (adds a little sweetness), and an onion chopped up, (also instead of jarred garlic I used fresh). I marinated the chops for 2 hours and flipped them over after 1 hour. They were extremely moist and flavorful. I tried to broil 1/2 of them to see how it would go and it didn't go so well. They were edible but the tops were a bit charred. The other batch I pan seared and they were good. I reduced the sauce in a pan and added chicken broth to it (awesome sauce but we never used it). The pork chops can hold their own! I'd say take this recipe as is and if you're new to cooking it will give you a great starting point. If you're a vet you can change it to suit your taste. Enjoy :)

Igave it two stars because they were very juicy. However they were too salty for everyone in my family, and I love salt. I marinated for 3 hours and I can't imagine if I had done it for 12. We could barely eat them.

I will definitely make these again.  I only did two things differently.  I used low-sodium soy sauce and I only marinated the chops a couple hours, and they weren't dry.  But I am definitely going to try marinating them the full 12 hours next time.  I can imagine how juicy they'll be then!  I made them with another recipe on this website called "Butternut Squash Fries."  I was trying both recipes for the first time, and both turned out wonderful.  I've found a new meal for my regular rotation.

These are great chops, I used fresh garlic instead of jarred, I also grilled instead of baked, added a little steak seasoning to the mix. Quick and easy meat dish. 5 plus stars!!!!!.

I was looking for a quick and easy chop recipe that wouldn't add a lot of fat and this was perfect! I only marinated them for about 20 minutes because I was in a hurry and it still worked out great.  We just kept an eye on them under the broiler and flipped them half way through. Perfect flavor with the soy and jarred garlic and very moist and delicious. So quick too! This is a keeper!

This recipe gets 5 stars because my husband raved about it. He didn't believe me when I explained how easy the marinade was. I'm not a huge pork chop fan normally, but I enjoyed these, too.
I grilled them rather than broiling them this time around because I don't own a grill pan and have to create my own with a baking pan and tin foil. So since the weather was good, firing up the grill on the patio was much easier. However, I'll try broiling next time because I'll bet they will be even juicier that way.

I marinaded the pork chops for 8 hours as per the recipe. They were dry & tough!
I cooked them in my George Forman grill for only about 5 minutes as they were about 1/2 inch thick. Flavor nothing to write home about.
I certainly will not use this recipe again!

My husband the carnivore loved it... even though we had to push back dinner and they weren't as "fresh" as they could have been.  Also, I freely acknowledge that my stove is on the fritz, but they took quite a bit longer than 4 minutes on each side.

I'm giving this four stars because as written I think it would have been way too salty. I used 1/8th cup low sodium soy and 1/8 cup worcestire sauce. then i used 1/4 cup white wine. Put in the garlic but added about 2-3 tbsp of fresh minced ginger. Allowed it to marinade for 5 hours and then grilled outside. It was perfect! I'm glad I cut down on the salt because the way I made it was just slaty enough without being overpowering.

There is only one thing I can say about this recipe - it is BANGIN' GOOD.  I might be slightly biased, since I love pork chops and I love garlic, but I want to make these all the time.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  I just found the recipe at lunch time, so I didn't marinate for 12 whole hours, but I did marinate for a good 6.  The only ways that I deviated from the recipe was I didn't broil (don't got one)so I used my frying pan and a little cooking spray, cooked on each side for about 10 mins.  The other way was that before I put it in the frying, I sprinkled garlic powder on each side of the chop - I love garlic!  This recipe was THE YUM and I will be making it reguarly, as is, without changes!

I marinated 1 hour on each side and they were juicy, but alittle salty. Next time I may only marinate half hour each side. My husband said he liked them alot. Broil for about 7 minutes each side, after 5 they were still pink inside.

I'm a vegetarian so I can't comment myself, but my husband would consider himself a meat connoisseur (they say opposites attract) and he said they live up to their name; The juiciest, most moist pork chops he's ever eaten. And they were sooooo easy to make!

I found this recipe and decided to make it the same day. My mom is famous for dry pork chops, so I made these for her one day. I only marinated them for about 4 hours, but they were fantastic! My mom was shocked at how well they turned out!

A bit salty for both of us.  I added minced ginger to the recipe as well and my husband and I talked about what we'd do next time.  Essentially - we would not use soy sauce....

Pork chops aren't my favorite, but these were pretty good. I used low sodium soy sauce and they marinated for 12 hours while I was at work. I didn't find them too salty, but I think regular soy sauce would be way too much salt.

I will absolutely make this one again! I loved the simplicity of this and my guests were impressed...another thing, I only marinated these for about 2 hours and that was plenty! I think if I had let them sit any longer, they would have had a little too much flavoring. Quick and easy, a definate keeper!

The taste was good for only marinating for 15 minutes.  I'd like to marinate overnight the next time to get a stronger flavor.  This worked great on the George Foreman grill rather than the broiler.  I used lite soy sauce and didn't think it tasted overly salty.

RICH!! wonderful! I cut the amount of pepper but the soy sauce is amazing. i had always put it in the pan when frying right at the end to add richness, but this is even better!!

Having had pork chop disasters, I was reluctant to even buy them anymore. But when our local grocery store had a great meat sale, I bought a family pack of thick, boneless pork chops and headed for this web site to find a recipe I could live with. This one got rave reviews from my husband who told me to not lose this recipe! Because I was still worried that the chops might turn out dry, I  poured a little bit of olive oil over them as they broiled. I didn't have time to marinate them as long as suggested (only about an hour) but they turned out heavenly. This is a keeper. Just be sure you are using the inch thick pork chops. This recipe is now my preferred way to make pork chops. Thank you motherofthreeboyz for sharing a winner!

Didn't change anything in the marinade and they came out great.  I was short on time so they only marinaded about 4 hours.  I grilled them on my Foreman and they were excellent.

All I can say is WOW!  I even put my own spin on the marinate, using Iron Chef's General Tso sauce.  I now realize I've been way over cooking my pork. Wifey and I truly enjoyed this dish with a side of rice pilaf.  Aside from the overnight marinating, the meal was together in the stated time. Here's a high five !!!!/ to Melissa Beau Powell for posting this.

I used low sodium soy sauce and thought the recipe was still way too salty!  It was moist and juicy, but the super saltiness (combined with the pepper) was just too much!  Disappointed!

These were the best pork chops I've eve made. They were quite thick (about 1inch) and I marinated them for 24 hours, then broiled for 6 minutes each side. I'm staying in a beach rental so didn't have lots of ingredient options.  Didn't have any garlic, used soy sauce and maple syrup (1/2 and 1/2) for marinade.

I like this recipe because it's easy and cheap.  A little too salty, but the chops turned out tender and flavorful.  Cooked on the portable indoor grill (you know the GF).

This was awesome.  I used 1/2 soy sauce & 1/2 worcestershire sauce, 1 t of ginger, 2 T of brown sugar and a splash of olive oil.  I also sauteed an onion with brown sugar as someone suggested.  This has turned into our favorite pork chop recipe!  I only marinated for a couple of hours and they were extremely moist and tender!!!

OMG -- this is a very tasty and easy recipe!  The only reason I don't give it 5-stars is all the sodium in the soy sauce.  Need to try it with low-sodium soy sauce.

I'm not big on pork chops, but this is sooo good. Since I normally use 1/2 inch or thinner chops, I used 1/4 cup of soy sauce, 1/2 tsp of pepper and 3 garlic cloves, chopped.  I only marianaded for no more than an hour, and turned over 1/2 way through the marianade time.  I broiled for 3 minutes on each side, and as promised the chops were juicy.  Yummm!

Added a TBS of brown sugar to the marinade, which made it taste a bit teriyaki. Used mostly regular soy sauce, but added a little bit of low sodium sauce. Marinated 1-8" - 1/4" chops for an hour and a half to two hours. Turned out wonderfully.

This was so delicious! I too used half soy and half Worcestershire. I found this last minute, so it was only able to marinate for 2 hours and it was still so juicy! I couldn't imagine this being marinaded for 12 hours! Will definitely be making this again soon!

Everyone in the house loved these pork chops.... From my 2 year old son to my dad :-) I had a nice package of pork chops from our local butcher shop and needed a way to cook them quickly. I only marinated them for about 20 minutes, and it seemed like enough, they were tender and juicy. I brushed a little bit of the marinade on before they went in and when I flipped them, and used a little bit more of the leftover marinade when I heated up the leftovers the next day! Thanks a bunch for this recipe, it's one of our new favorites for pork chops :-)

Really good...I added a little bit of seasoned salt to the chops before putting them in the bag.  I only did this because I had the reduced sodium soy sauce.

These are fantastic! I also used a little less soy and added Worcestershire sauce and a hint of terriyaki. These are incredibly moist and very tasty. Making them again tonight.

This is a good recipe and very quick and easy. I marinated my chops for about 6 hours, and I really think 12 hours would have been too much, but that might be because they were very thin to begin with and soaked up a LOT of the flavor. I hadn't broiled pork chops before, but was pleasantly surprised how quickly and well they cooked. Very moist and tasty. I also added about a TBSP of brown sugar to the marinade like some suggested. All in all it was very yummy and a hit with the family!

Awesome flavor! I tried baking them in just a cookie sheet (I don't have a broiling pan), they ended up being a little salty. Could be because they were cooking in their own juices. Still, awesome!!!

My family really loved this recipe.  Although we thought it was just a tad too salty with regular Soy Sauce, so next time I'm using low sodium soy sauce.  My 13-year old son, made the marinade, marinaded the chops and cooked them that evening.  The were very delicious.

These are so simple and yet so good!  My fiance LOVES them!  I gave the recipe to my mom who made these for my stepdad and he loves them too!  I generally use thin chops and the recipe turns out great. The pork chops come out juicy and bursting with flavor.

It was pretty good. It could have been less salty but if you like salty then your fine. Although I liked it, It didn't WOW! me. Good simple recipe. oh and I only soaked it for 1 hour and it still took the taste so you don't have to soak it any longer.

The only flavour that comes through is the saltiness from the soy sauce. Other than that these are bland and a little dry.

I followed the recipe, but also added a little red wine, it gave it great flavor.  I marinated them for 4 to 5 hrs.  They were delicious!

These were the juiciest pork chops ever. 5 stars. I can see how some people could say it's too salty but we like salty food. I added a little teriyaki sauce and used fresh garlic. I let them marinate for longer than the 12 hours, lots of flavor but not too salty for me!

I thought these were no better than the pork chops I already make. They had no flavor and certainly were not moist. This was a huge disappointment.

This was delicious... I followed the recipe  except that butterfly'd my chops and then pounded them down to make pork cutlets. Cooked about 3-4 min each side. This recipe gives lots of flavor and keeps the chops moist. I only marinated for about 45 min. but I can only imagine what 12 hrs would do because even 45 min made them great. I also used fresh minced garlic but I'm sure no different then the jarred. 

Thanks for a great recipe. It's a keeper in my house!

Any citrus juice you have on hand will cut the salt of the soy sauce without sweetening.  (Tried because this is how I marinate my steaks)  Delicious!!

I used this recipe to prepare Schwan's lean, boneless pork chops, and it makes for an extremely easy, fast dinner. It makes for more flavorful and moist chops than probably any other recipe I've tried -- the kids love it.

I honestly think this is a wonderful marinade for pork chops. I've marinated chops using this recipe both grilled and baked, and both turned out very delicious. I like big bold flavor, and this delivers. Thank you for this wonderful marinade!

These are a great base pork chop.  You can do anything with them.  I only marinated for about an hour and then accidently over-grilled them and they still came out juicy!  I love a recipe that is idiot-proof!

Per other reviewers, I shortened the marinating time (3-4 hours, max). Lessened the soy sauce amount and added some ginger and onion powder, but they were a bit too "soy" tasting... Still, hubby loved them, so thanks for the recipe!

I marinated these for about an hour and they came out delicious. My husband who usually does not like chops, absoluetly loved these!! I had boneless chops which were thicker, so I cooked them a bit longer than suggested.  Will def. make these again!!

These are good, we grilled them.  This is the same way we do London Broil, so I knew what to expect... can't believe I never thought to do it with pork chops, but I will from now on!

Wow, I will never cook pork chops any other way.  I love this method, quick and easy!  My husband wasn't too fond of the marinade though... We could have avoided the whole marinade process altogether and literally use soy sauce as a dip and it would taste the same.  Next time I will try a different marinade, maybe Korean BBQ or something.  But the broiling gives it perfect juice and crunch at same time though!

VERY GOOD! My chops weren't too salty or too peppery at all. I didn't marinate them for 12 hours, I only marinated for 8 so they wouln't be so salty. They were so good! Thanks!

I made this for my husbands birthday. I used regular garlic instead of the jarred kind. I ran out of soy sauce so I combined it with worchestershire sauce. Still very good. Next time I'll use  just the soy sauce. Thanks!

Overall a very good recipe! I marinated for 11 hours but was unable to turn them halfway through marinating. They came out juicy in the broiler and had great flavor. I think had I been able to turn them, the flavor would have been spread more evenly over all the chops. The ones that didn't have as much marinade on them were a little more bland. I definitely will be making this again.

These were SO good! I used butterflied chops that were quite thick, so I broiled for alittle longer than called for, but they were still so juicy and full of flavor. This is my new favorite way to do chops! Even my super picky 6 and 2 year old ate this up and even ask for more. Great recipe!

I bought some pork chops on sale yesterday and was looking for a good recipe. My husband and I aren't big pork fans, but this recipe is terrific! The chops were so tender and moist! It's nice that the marinade ingredients are things you normally have on hand. I thought it was a bit peppery for my taste, but I'll just decrease the amount next time. I still love the recipe! Who knew something so simple could be so delicious?

Only marinaded for an hour and it was GREAT! I used Bragg Liquid Aminos instead of soy sauce. Less sodium!

We didn't change a thing in the recipe itself (except marinated for 8 hours instead of 12), but since it was still warm enough to use the gas grill, hubby put the 1.5" marinated pork chops on the grill, and they tasted just as good as a steak -- moist, very tasty.

I have tried many 4 1/2-5 star recipes on this site and they were all amazing, but this one was so salty we could not eat them.  I should have know with this much soy sauce that they would turn out very salty.  Easy recipe, just very disappointing.

Very good!  Used the Teriyaki to lower sodium.  My husband and son who typically do not like pork chops both liked this recipe! Thanks

Every pork chop I cook is too dry, so I decided to marinate for a day with fresh minced garlic, half a can of beer and added some sesame oil to the soy sauce marinade. This was the most tender and juicy boneless pork chop that has ever come out of my oven. I set aside some marinade to pour over fresh asparagus with portobello mushroom and white onion while sauteing. A side of Asian noodles finished it all off.

I rarely have time to marinate these for more than an hour and they always turn out great.  My 6 year old hates to try anything new, but once she tasted these, she actually requests them!  Thank you for proving once again Simple and easy can make a great tasting recipe.  Wonderful for a busy weeknight dinner

This is by far the best pork chop recipe that I have made.  I have a large family, 13, and that means a lot of picky eaters.  They all loved this.  Not only was it delicicious and juicy it was also so easy.  I used fresh garlic instead of jarred and I used low sodium soy sauce.  They were wonderful

Delicious! My boyfriend raved about these pork chops. We usually don't eat that much pork but I am sure I will be using this again!  Cook time was so fast- loved that!!!!!! The fat caramelized really nicely. I didn't have soy so I put some red vinegar in it and fresh garlic. So good. I also served mine with mushrooms.  Thanks for the recipe!

These were amazing! I have never cared for pork chops any way but grilled, but these were fantastic. They were so juicy. The soy sauce was a bit salty for me, but the 8 others that had them couldn't get enough. Will definitely be making these again.

Delicious!  As the previous reviewer stated, there is a lot of soy sauce in this recipe as well as garlic.  I cut WAY back on the garlic and when I make this recipe again I will cut WAY back on the soy sauce. I added a half of cup of beer to the dish for moisture since my pork chops were very thick.  I made them for my birthday dinner and my boyfriend enjoyed them soooo much!  They are great with collard greens (or any other type of green veggie) and mashed potatoes!

If you LOVE LOVE Soy sauce and tons of Garlic then this is for you.  It was not absolutely terrible but I wouldnt eat it again.  Felt like I was at a chinese restaurant but without the rice and vegetables.

My family really enjoyed this.  My husband and mother-in-law said it was quite delicious.  The recipe is certainly a keeper.  I did not marinade for as long as recommended.  I added diced onions, rosemary, creole seasoning, garlic powder, salt and a pinch of powered ginger to mine.  Simply wonderful.  Please try this.  You will lick your fingers.  Mmm. Yummy.

Very nice pork chops, and I love the fact that they were so incredibly easy.  I used the low setting on my broiler, so it took 10 min on each side.  However, that's probably safer for me on the low setting bc otherwise I tend to burn things under the broiler.  They were juicy and tasted good, and weren't too soy sauce-y despite the fact that I marinated for about 36 hours (meant to make these for last night but didn't).  Thanks for the recipe!

These were stellar!  I added a little more garlic than called for as I love it.  My boyfriend is not a huge fan but ate every bit of the pork chops including the leftovers!  Served with rice and steamed veggies.  A great healthy and tasty dinner for a couple of dieters.  Thanks for sharing!

Tried the recipe exactly as written and overall, it is a good recipe,would just make the following alterations in the future.  It was definitely way too salty and too spicy to serve to my kids, so in the future, I think I would definitely reduce the soy sauce, or maybe try mixing it w/ worcestershire sauce, as well as reducing the black pepper.  Did not have time to marinade more than a half hour and even then, it worked out nicely.

I thought these were not only delicious, but easy make.  I cut the amount of pepper in 1/2 and that was still a tiny bit too much.  I grilled them instead of broiling them.  Unfortunately my broiler and smoke detector don't get along too well.  They still turn out juicy and full of flavor on the grill.  I will be making these again.

Very easy & quick recipe from preparation to plate.  However, it was a bit on the salty side with too much soy sauce flavor.  Might do better to lessen the soy sauce and substitute in a bit of teriyaki instead.

Easy, easy, easy!! Taste great too! I marinated all day (about 9 hours). I chopped fresh garlic instead of minced from a jar.  Also, instead of broiling them, I grilled them. Turned out juicy and fantastic!

I typically don't eat a lot of pork because it tends to come out on the drier side, but not with this recipe!!! This is my "go to" marinade when I'm in the mood for a juicy chop. If you enjoy a little heat, add a few shakes of red paper flakes to the marinade. Yum!!!

Extra nummie!  The boyfriend loved it.  We just moved into our new apartment, and didn't have the cooking-ware to broil it in the oven so I just threw it in a frying pan after about 4 hours of marinating.  I will make it again.

I took other reviewers advice and used half soy sauce and half worcestershire sauce. I marinaded for about 4 hours. The chops came out wonderfully. Very tender and juicy with great flavor. Super easy to make! This is definitly a keeper.

Very simple... very, very tasty! I added a couple of dashes of lemon juice just for some acidity. Yum!

We loved these!  I'm not crazy about soy sauce, so I altogether substituted with worcestershire.  I also added some Italian dressing to the marinade.  I love the broiling method, I had never had pork chops this way.  I will cook them like this from now on!

i am undecided about this recipe.  it is very very juicy but there is something about it i dont like.  i think its way too salty but i think its my fault as i marinaded them for 24 hours.  i am giving it 4 stars though bc they did come out very juicy...i will try this again but use a low sodium soy sauce next time and not marinade as long...although the marinade smelled wonderful!

Really good - I marinaded the chops for over 24hours and they weren't salty at all.  Would definitely make again.

This was YUMMY.  I only marinated for 4 hours and it wasn't overly salty, but it was moist and great flavor.  My family loved it, I will make it again.  I made this with fried rice and a veggie.

The flavor was great, but I had to bake my pork chops after broiling since they were not done in the middle.  I just have a bad broiler I guess, but I would make these again!

I only have one complaint.  I marinated my pork chops for about 18 hours and they turned out very salty.  I liked the flavor but next time I will use low sodium soy salt or maybe just not marinate them too long.  Could've been my fault... I also made them on the grill.  I will make this again.

This tasted alright, but I expected more flavor.  Used full-salt soy (we always use lite) and marinated 2 days... so I thought the chops would have soaked up more of the flavor.  Grilled 5 minutes/side.

These were very juicy.  I have determined that I am just not a fan of pork chops in general. The rest of the family INHALED them! I sliced the leftover chop very thinly and made a pork sandwich for lunches today.
