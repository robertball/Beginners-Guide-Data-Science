As always, Chef John did not disappoint. I have made this recipe three times now for my foodie friends and they all keep raving about it. The secret really is in grinding the ingredients together until they release those juices that put this guac over the top, so make sure you take the extra effort to follow the technique as closely as possible. I suggest watching the video. I have made plenty of these recipes over the years (as I'm sure many of you have as well) but never have I achieved results like this.

Yes! Chef John makes Guac even better. Great technique but I used my mortal/pestle for that. I made double cilantro/onion/Serrano mash to freeze 1/2 for next go round. I did add a clove a garlic, 1/2 tsp of cumin and 1 smallish roasted jalapeno as I like those added flavors. Used the optional fresh tomato as well.  Great stuff you can add more heat/spices for your liking.  Ole'!

Made exactly as written but omitted optional diced tomatoes. Did sneak in a smidgen of ground cayenne pepper but the guilt quickly faded after tasting this concoction. Makes an excellent guacamole that is bursting with flavor. Preferred this healthy version that doesn't use dairy products such as sour cream. First time, it's helpful to watch his video to master tips and techniques, and, as usual, get a few laughs. Another wining recipe by Chef John!!

As with everything "Chef John" I've made, this was great. 

 I added a couple tablespoons of chopped fresh mint.

Delicious!  Made a half recipe.  Used 1/2 roma tomato, seeded; seeded the serrano pepper,  and added a pinch of garlic powder.  Will use this "smashing"  technique for the vegetables from now on.

Delicious!  I love the technique of smashing the onions, cilantro and peppers with salt.  It makes the final product much smoother.

I have never liked guacamole. This stuff is night and day better than anything I've ever had before. Made it by directions with no changes. I'll be keeping this stuff around to snack on.

I made this for a family dinner, everyone loved it.  The only thing different I did was use a mortar and pestle for the chopped veggies.  Best guacamole I have ever made.

I made it as written except I used a jalapeño. As I had a bunch from my garden. It is the best guacamole I have ever had. Yum. I will be making this for a party next weekend.

The grinding is key - I used a mortar and pestle!  Came out awesome with almost no leftovers (there were only 4 of us:)

I forgot to get the peppers, so I used cayenne for heat -- my favorite, actually. Everything else I did according to the recipe, mushing and chopping and smushing. Best guacamole I ever made, and my husband agrees. I'm off to buy a molcajete and more avocados!

Only used about 1/3 cup of tomatoes, otherwise followed the directions...

Easy, and as good as our favorite Mexican restaurant's version!

Best recipe so far.  Tastes great and just the right balance of heat, tomato, and onion.  Only used half a lime.  Definitely a keeper.

Delicious, everyone loved it.  I used green onion instead of white onion and jalepeno pepper rather than serrano only because that is what I had on hand.  This will be my go to guacamole from now on.

Perfect!  Thank you for the chop and smear technique
in the video.  I used kosher salt and the texture of the final mix of cilantro, chili, and onion blended easily with the avocados and was delicioso! I had fresh jalapeños on hand; will be on the lookout for Serranos next time.

Thank you, Chef John, for the recipe and the training!

I've never made guacamole with serrano chilis before, but from now on I always will!  I used this recipe as a base, but made some changes:
- Added 1 minced garlic clove
- Used red onion instead of white
- Used 2 chili peppers instead of 3
- Added 1/4 tsp ground cumin
- Omitted the cilantro (I have the cilantro-soap curse).

I've never seen guacamole go so quickly before.  It's always a go-to party dip, but this, with the changes I made, was above and beyond.

I  made this for a Cinco de Mayo party with friends.  Everyone made something appropriate but this dish was the big winner.  I followed the instructions exactly (I did not add tomatoes) and it was perfect.  I have made guacamole often and always used more ingredients, but never again.  This is clean and the flavors burst out.  Chef John is the man.

I substituted the tomatoes for a can of Rotel, drained. Great recipe
