Definitely easy, and very mild.  I personally added a lot more seasoning but I was using a full lb of pasta, so that may be why it needed more flavoring.  I forgot the red bell pepper so I went without. I also added in more chili powder and some cumin.  A+ for ease!

Very good.I didn't have tomato juice do I subbed 3 oz of paste and a cup of water. Loved the flavor of this chili. Sweet with a subtle kick. I did add 1 tbs of garlic powder to the meat (turkey).

My family loves this one. I find it WAY too salty with all that bouillon so I just use 2. My kids don't like lots of spice so I cut the chili powder in half (though I think it would be good with both tablespoons). I also double the noodles (no change to the liquids). That way it's more like a beefaroni. We often serve it with cheese to sprinkle over the top.
It's a pretty flexible recipe. I've used other tomato-based items (such as spaghetti sauce or tomato paste) that was in my fridge in place of the juice (and just water it down if it isn't a runny kind). Or I vary the veggies (more peppers, adding mushrooms, that sort of thing) with what I have on hand.

I made this tonight. I love chili, but my children don't like beans or spicy food, so the mild flavor and the noodles were a good alternative. I would classify this more as home made beef-a-roni instead of chili, but it was still pretty tasty.

I've lived in Texas for over 40 years, so it is not what a Texan would call "chili".  However, I was born and raised in Wisconsin for 25 years, and by adding a can of kidney beans, it reminds me of the chili I still long for on occasion that Mama used to make.

I recently made this recipe. It is a very good,  quick and easy recipe.  It is a very mild chili which can be spiced up, for those of us that like chili with heat,  with a few splashes of hot sauce.  We topped it with shredded cheddar cheese.  Next time I may try pepperjack cheese.
