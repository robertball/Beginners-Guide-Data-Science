My kids loved it.  I followed it exactly except I didn't have any celery to add.  It was simple to make, lots of flavor and fed my family of 5 with a pound of pasta and a little leftover for lunch tomorrow.  We will be making this again.

This is a nice quick recipe but I would definitely recommend sautéing the bacon and onions first. Get the bacon a little crispy otherwise you have little pieces of fat throughout the sauce. I didn’t add the other vegetables but I did add garlic. With those changes it was really good. My husband added crushed red pepper to his own plate for a little extra spice.

Good flavor but as others have done, adding garlic would give it a little more flavor.

Very simple and delicious, but needs a bit more kick to it. Followed directions  with one exception and that was adding some marsala wine to deglaze the pan first before adding the beef broth.

I followed this recipe except for two changes: I omitted the bacon because I didn’t have any, and substituted 1% milk for the whole milk. Everyone liked this and felt it was tasty. I will try it with the bacon, but even without, this is going into my permanent recipes! #HealthyWinterDinner

There was (almost) not enough salt in my kitchen to bring this sauce to life. I added a clove of garlic at the beginning and as it simmered and tasted, I added dried oregano, basil and practically a handful of garlic powder to try to get some flavor to come through. Squeezed in tomato paste and more salt until it finally tasted like sauce!!

Wonderful sauce! Took me about 40 mins to prepare, did not add celery, but added 2 cloves of garlic, low fat milk instead of whole, and some parm cheese. Tastes like in a restaurant, made with Rigatoni pasta.
