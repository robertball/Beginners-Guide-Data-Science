This tastes really good but be sure to cook the potatoes before you add them to the parcels. Otherwise the potatoes don't cook through all the way and if you increase the cooking time as another reviewer suggested I found that the chicken got tough. I've made this twice and the second time I microwaved the potatoes until tender before mixing them with everything else and cooking. That seemed to work pretty well.

Good flavour but if you cook it in the oven make sure you double the cooking time.

Perfect for camping. You don't need to precook your potatoes.....just cut them a little smaller. Have been making similar recipes like this for years and when having trouble with potatoes I just add a few ice cubes to the foil pack and it helps steam the potatoes. Awesome!

I've never had a problem with the potatoes being raw and we like our vegetables to have a bit of bite. So with that being said the peppers will not be soggy and cooked all the way through. Some people like their veggies soft so if that is your preference then definitely saute them first if you can. If you are cooking over a fire and that is your only source of heat I recommend cooking the potatoes and vegetables in a separate parcel. Double wrap with foil and put the veggies on about 10-15 minutes before you put the chicken on. My mom made these for us when we were kids and it's something I've made a number of times since. Make sure you dice your potatoes also if you are cooking in one parcel. That should help with the evenness issue. The other tip is to ensure that you aren't sticking these things directly in the flame! If you do the protein will cook and the rest will be raw.

We do a similar recipe when we go camping. We use canned potatoes so they cook about the same time as the other veggies. We even add velvetta cubes (instead of BBQ) for a cheesy sauce. YUM!!

This is an easy to prepare recipe for camping but it can also be made at home either on the grill or in the oven. Just wrap in a packet and cook until chicken and potatoes are done.

Simple quick and quite good. As mentioned before I cooked the potatoes a bit before mixing everything together.

We thoroughly enjoyed this dish even though we cooked it in the oven. I too was skeptical about the amount of barbecue sauce it called for but it really wasn't all that much when separated into 4 foil packets....and yes we did eat right off the foil. Hint for cooking the potatoes through is cut them into small pieces. 1hr in the oven was perfect.

This was really good I seasoned my chicken with salt pepper garlic powder etc and cooked in the oven for an hour. It came out perfect!! This is a real simple informal and healthy meal.

These were fantastic!! I put the veggies in first and threw in some johnny's salad elegance. Then the potatoes with shome johnny's & garlic powder. Next the chicken & bbq sauce. Nuked the diced potatoes about 3 minutes before hand but we discovered as long as you don't over fill the pouches all will cook fine in about an hour to an hour 20 min.

Just made this dish and it was very good and easy! Instead of chicken breast I used boneless thighs. Didn't have a problem with the potatoes they were thoroughly cooked. Grilled for 30 minutes and it was perfect.

This is a great template for any mix of veggies / sauce and chicken. I didn't peel the potatoes we like the peels. I did pre-cook my potatoes in the microwave for 5 mins with a little water per another review. Then we foiled a cookie sheet and cooked it in the oven @ 350 for 1 hour. It came out perfect and was easier than making packets. I can see us adding in different veggies or trying different sauces but over all it was easy! We used Sweet Baby Rays and it was mmm mmm good:)

Not having a grill I adapted this for the oven and was pleasantly surprised. You MUST cook the potatoes first or they will be crunchy or you'll end up with very dry chicken waiting for the potatoes to become tender. The bbq sauce seemed to thin out a bit as it heated and was a little watery but was still good. You could really play with this add different veggies and customize it to your liking.

I made this recipe as suggested by others by cutting the potatoes smaller & even precooking them a bit & they were STILL undercooked. The chicken was dry. And the bbq sauce didn't taste good with any of the veggies except the celery. No one in my family liked this dinner including myself. I won't be making this one again! Sorry!

Very good. I made a half recipe because there are just two of us. I left the skins on my potatoes and cooked in the packets in the Crock-pot on high for about 5 hours to avoid the heat of the oven or grill. I baked the potatoes in an already warmed from lunch oven for about 15 minutes but I think the time in the crock-pot would have cooked them through anyway. I used large ( 7" long) potatoes and think one would have been enough in the recipe for us. Will definitely have this again. Thanks!!

This is an excellent entree. I followed the advice of others and microwaved the potatoes then added to the other ingredients. I also did not cut up the chicken. I have a chef service and put this on my menu. I received rave reviews. It is definitely a keeper.

This was a very simple and tasty meal. We certainly will have this again. It's really good the way it is but next time we may add some mushrooms or even some frozen vegtables.

Good flavor. We added zucchini and cooked it on the grill. Our chicken did end up a little overdone and the potatoes a little underdone. I tried to leave big chunks of chicken and little pieces of potato to avoid this problem but I guess if we try this again I'll have to use a larger size difference in my pieces. I think in the future though I'd omit the potato and cook it separately.

Can I even give this one star? The potatoes were still hard and the veggies raw but the meat was done. Yes I read the instructions to cook it for 25 minutes. Put back to cook more and then the chicken was overcooked and the veggies still really crunchy and the potatoes were really hard. And I even like my veggies crunchy in dishes but theses were next to raw. I still don't even understand how that is possible.

This was very good. A little soup though. Make sure you seal the aluminum foil well. I didn't and cooked it in the oven so it leaked all over. Took about an hour in the oven.

The whole family (mom dad 2 and 4 year old) enjoyed this one! I didn't have red pepper so I used green pepper but everything else was the same. I did leave it on the grill for about 40 moniutes though because even though we chopped our potato really small it wasn't quite done at 25-30 min.
