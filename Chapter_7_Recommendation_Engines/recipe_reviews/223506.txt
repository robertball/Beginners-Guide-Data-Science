Balsamic vinegar lovers, this is your recipe!  The chicken bathes in it, and I loved the combination of flavors.  Everyone became interested when the cooking aromas hit the air.  Every ingredient played a part, but the addition of the cheese mellowed all the flavors and brought them together into a really satisfying dish.  I served with brown rice and steamed broccoli.  Thanks for the recipe!

Man, what a dinner tonight! First, let me say I didn't measure anything, just kind of winged it according to the directions in the recipe. And I did finish the dish at the end with a couple of good swirls of butter to enrich the sauce, making it all luxurious and velvety. This has all the flavor you'd expect from a braised meat, yet it takes a fraction of the time.  The combination of the balsamic vinegar, Dijon and Herbs de Provence obviously work together to create something pretty extraordinary.  I served this tonight with Parmesan Garlic Orzo (tho' it was a toss up with just a pasta with garlic and olive oil) and fresh green beans sauteed with red bell peppers. It was a beautiful plate and a truly delicious meal.  (Note: Don't have provolone?  No worries!  Any good, semi-soft cheese will work just fine!)

Loved this recipe for our tour of the south of France last night. I enjoy doing themed dinners. I followed the recipe almost to a "T". I did not have a large shallot so I subbed with half of a medium sized red onion and grated it. I also marinaded the chicken for about 6 hours. This really intensified the Dijon mustard and balsamic vinegar flavors. I would not recommend the faint of heart cooks to do this as the flavors were bold. A nice change from the usual delicate French tastes.Thank you!

This is fantastic!  I was rooting around in my pantry and discovered a bottle of balsamic vinegar I didn't realize I had, and then later I happened to see this recipe in the newest reviews.  I don't need lightening to strike me- this was meant to be!  I am so glad I saw this recipe, as it is really something special.  The aroma in the house was amazing, and drew everyone in to inquire as to what I was making.  I followed this to the letter- it was surprisingly easy to put together and the results are dinner party worthy.  Very delicious- I will definitely make this one again!  Thanks for sharing :)

I made this recipe last night. The only changes I made was to use chicken tenderloins that I did not pound and added some white wine while cooking. I had this with roasted asparagus and potatoes. It was delicious. Thank you for sharing.

A simple, scrumptious recipe, worthy of your company.  And so simple to put together.  I used thin chicken cutlets.  I followed the recipe exactly, only exception was using shredded swiss for the top and finished with a drizzle of black truffle oil.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, a keeper and definite do-over, for sure.  Tres Bon!  Manifique!

I made this tonight for dinner. My husband loved it (we both love Balsamic vinegar). Since there are only 2 of us I only made 2 chicken breasts. I did not cut any of the other ingredients and it stilled turned out perfectly. Since we really like mushrooms I think I would increase that if I were making 4 chicken breasts. So easy too!

I really loved this recipe. I did make some changes because of whatI had on hand. I used 1/2 onion instead of the shallot, button mushrooms instead of the crimini, and the St. Louis favorite, provel cheese instead of the provolone. It was pretty quick and easy, too. It would be great for a weeknight.

I thought this dish was awesome.  Store did not have cremini mushrooms so just used regular ones.  Great at home date night dish.

We may have pounded the chicken a little too much.  Next time we'll keep it  fuller.  The combination of tastes was delicious though.   Broccoli would probably go well with it.   I had a malbec that paired wonderfully with it, as well.

For anyone that loves balsamic vinegar this is a winner.  I did have to simmer on low for about 15 minutes after putting the chicken back into the pan to make sure the chicken was cooked through but to be honest I think that added to the carmelization of the mushrooms. This is a keeper for sure.   So good.

Absolutely wonderful! We had to create our own herbes de Provence (online recipe) and I can't imagine store-bought could be any better.  Didn't change recipe at all and served with fresh sauteed asparagus with lemon.  Yummy!

My husband didn’t care for the balsamic twang.  But it was very tender and mushrooms were flavorful.  It went together quickly and was easy to make.

This was amazingly good. I didn't have the "herbes de Provence"... but used oregano, thyme and rosemary and it was fantastic. I used an 18y/o balsamic which added a rich sweetness, along with a red onion. The family loved it.

Love it! I didn't need the first 1/3 cup of chicken stock as there was enough liquid in the pan, probably because I didn't measure the butter and oil at the beginning! Will be making it again and again.

Great week night dish.  Made it in 1 pan.  3  and 1 year old loved it.  I served this over a basic polenta.    Husband said more mushrooms next time.

Excellent.  The flavors blend together to make a unique dish.  I marinated the chicken and smoked on the grill then grilled them. I added the cooked chicken to the pan with the mushrooms.

Wonderfully elegant and delicious.  I used Poulet Rouge Fermier chicken breasts for additional French flair. I followed this recipe exactly and it was superb. Since it was served over rice pilaf, I'll double the mushroom and shallot sauce next time, Yum!

Very good and easy. Next time I would slice the mushrooms thinner for quicker cooking (they took much longer than written) and only pound the breasts if they were very uneven in thickness but otherwise would make it just the way it is.  Oh and Havarti was a great provolone substitute

This was a huge hit in our house but you have to love Balsamic vinegar to enjoy this as much as we did. The flavors melded so well together and really brought some basic chicken up a few levels for a flavorful dinner.

Whoa. This was amazing! The only change I made was to use fines herbes instead of herbes de provence because that was what I had in the house (and I'm not really a lavender fan). This was elegant and simple. I served it with a baguette and some soft cheese, and some roasted vegetables. Add a glass of white wine and watch the smiles.

Good, but I probably won't make again just because not everyone else liked it as much.

This was very good! I had no mushrooms so I omitted it, but next time I'd like to try it with the mushrooms. I also used a whole slice of provolone one each piece of chicken instead of 1/2 piece. Everything else I followed exactly and I really enjoyed it.

Delicious. Might not require quite as much chicken stock as recommended but that's a matter of taste.

This is a fantastic 5 star recipe, as is.  My whole family loves it, even the kids (though I hold back the mushrooms for them).  It's a winner all the way, thank you so much!!
