Simple and delicous! Lemon and rosemary pair well together and this was no exception. Like just about everyone else, I used olive oil (about 1/4 cup) instead of butter. Not only because it's healthier, but because in terms of marinades it just tenderizes the chicken a lot better. I love fresh rosemary and fresh lemon along with the garlic and I also added just a bit of dijon mustard to the mix. I pounded the chicken down thin and poked it with a fork. I put everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate for about 6 hours turning it a few times during marinating. Wow - what tender, juicy chicken that was full of wonderful lemony herbed flavor! This is a definite keeper.

Instead of butter, I used extra virgin olive oil and threw everything in a plastic bag. I also pounded my chicken breasts very thin. I served platter style with some fresh rosemary and grilled lemon slices. Presentation was gorgeous.

Delicious marinade!!!  I used olive oil rather than the butter (much healthier), and then grilled this on my George Foreman and it turned out perfect, very moist and flavorful!

I changed it up a bit but it was still a hit!!
I doubled the lemon juice and substituted the butter with olive oil. I also didn't have fresh rosmary so I used a TBS of dried. Marinated it for 5 hours and baked it. It came out really tender and moist. Definately cooking this again.

I've made this twice--I was asked for the recipe.  It was SO good.  Definitely recommend--used olive oil instead of butter.

Flavors are good, but needs too much tweaking to give more stars.  Butter does not make a marinade, it makes a flavored butter.  I melted it to blend, but it hardens upon being placed on the cold chicken.  Next time, I will use olive oil and maybe just a little butter for that flavor.  Also, for the same reason, grilling doesn't work well with the butter.  However, it can be roasted in a very small pan so the chicken is packed tightly, so the butter can melt, but can't run very far from the chicken.  But flavor is good.

This was sensational!! Delicious chicken recipe that received rave reviews from my family! Although I did tweak it a bit. I found the marinade to be a bit bland and the lemon to be very overpowering so i added some salt and a little steak seasoning. I  also used half butter and half EVOO as suggested by other reviews.  I  wanted to cut down the  marination time so I sealed the chicken and all of the marinade into a vacuum-sealed bag for one hour. I didn't feel it needed the basting and it turned  out fantastically! This was a great recipe and will make it again in the future Thanks! P.S. If you add salt to the marinade only pepper the chicken breasts for it may be too salty. :)

I too used olive oil instead of butter.  Used fresh rosemary from my garden and 4 cloves of garlic.  This was really good!  Grilled in my grill pan on the stove.  Easy, simply, yummy flavors.  For the review before me, you always want to take your rosemary off the stem.  Maybe you just used too much.  It can be overpowering.  To ANGELLACHELLE, will be using again.  Thanks so much!

Wow this was good!  the only change I made was to use Olive Oil instead of butter.  I have fresh rosemary and used a suggestion to put some sprigs on the coals.  4 min each side and they were done, tender, juicy and so tasty!  Now I have a great recipe to use my fresh rosemary and meyer lemons!  I also had some red potatoes so sliced them about 1/4th inch and brushed with the marinade laid 'em on the grill and they took 4 min each side... YUM!  Thank you for this marinade for boneless skinless chicken breasts!!!

This is a great recipe!  I cut the butter down to a couple of tablespoons, to get the buttery flavor, and used a 1/4 cup of EVOO.  I marinated in a large zip-bag, and instead of grilling, baked the chicken in the oven.  Cooked it for my parents, and they raved about it! Can't wait to try it on the grill!

Very tasty and easy to make- I used extra-virgin olive oil for a slightly healthier version, so it wasn't thick enough to use for a topping- I used half to marinate and half to baste. My husband and I will both definately try this again.

The first time I made this recipe I rated it a 2* I followed the recipe exactly as written.  Firstly I think it needs to say to use melted butter, not just regular butter.  I just ended up with rosemary butter knobs. I think if anything this should be tried with olive oil. UPDATE... Decided to try this recipe again using 1/4 cup of olive oil in place of the butter, and it was so much better. This time he marinade when on the chicken well, and I just loved the final taste. You really do need to use oil and not the butter like the recipe states.

Easy and delicious recipe.  I halved the recipe and didn't bother to use the food processor.  Also, I grilled on a grill pan on the stovetop (but will try on the outdoor grill in summer).  The dish has a pronounced lemon flavor- not too much, just right.  I will make this again.

I used olive oil like a lot of reviews suggested.  I thought it really needed something though. I tried adding a dab of butter on the already cooked chicken and that really didn't do anything. I then added some honey to the rest of the sauce. It went from ok to yumm.  The sweet/savory mix made it tons better. I then wished I had more of the sauce made.  I will always add some honey to it from now on.

Made this using the olive oil as suggested by others and it was fantastic.  Very moist and tasty.  And easy.  I also used a resealable plastic freezer bag to marinate the chicken it.

Very good.  I used olive oil and a combo of fresh and dry rosemary.  I lost way too much of it on the sides and lid of my blender so next time I will make a triple batch of the sauce and freeze it.  I didn't have enough to marinate, baste, and use as sauce.  Marinated 4 large chik breasts and 3 large red potatoes sliced into rounds for the grill.  The potatoes were better than the chicken, in my opinion!

First of all, how does one "marinate" something in butter? I marinated my chicken in olive oil along with the other listed ingredients & made a compound butter to put on top of the grilled chicken. The lemon & zest is overpowering, both in the marinade & the butter & made the dish so acidic. I frequently use lemon/rosemary together with good results but this recipe didn't work for me.

I used olive oil instead of butter.  Next time I'll also make up some of the herb butter mixture with roasted garlic (instead of raw) and serve it with chicken as the original recipe does.   The roasted garlic will let more of the rosemary shine through.

Used the marinade on goat backstraps. Wasn't the best ever but it was pretty darn good. I did use olive oil to replace the butter as suggested by several other reviewers.

This was very good but cut the butter way down as you don't really need it. Marinated chicken for a few hours and came out great. Don't really need all the lemon juice as well. All in all a good one to keep.

Substituted 1/4 C Butter and 1/4 C Olive Oil for the Butter.  Substituted Dried Rosemary (by 1/2) for Fresh Rosemary.  We cooked this on our George Foreman Grill.  It was fantastic!

prefer using oil to marinade rather than butter - it tended to clump and not sure that it really saturated the poultry.

Very good.  I accidenently melted the butter when softening butter and it worked.  It ended up being up being easier.  I also flatten chicken to make it easier to evenly grill.  Nice recipe.  Thanks.  I may use ovoo in marinade next time and butter in topping next time.

I was looking for a recipe to use leftover rosemary and this one was great!  I cut the chicken into pieces and made stovetop.  It's like a rosemary pesto - very creative.

A quick and easy chicken dish with wonderful lemon flavor.  I noticed many reviewers used olive oil instead of butter  but I loved the butter flavor.  I’m not sure how much the “butter” can marinate the chicken, but the end result was delicious.   This butter would be excellent with other dishes.

1st time I made this and it was GREAT! I got so many compliments on it. Next time I think I will try the olive oil to make it a little healther.

Awesome!  I have grown tired of the bottled marinades (both the taste and the price) and have been experimenting with making my own.  This is really, really good and easy.  I did go with olive oil after reading other reviews and actually used it on 2 very large turkey breast tenderloins.  Thanks for a great post.

We thought this was pretty bland.  I like chicken seasonings to pack a punch (to prevent chicken from being boring) and this did not cut it.  Not sure I will try again.

Very delicious recipe, and easy to make! I'm always a big fan of rosemary dishes and this one was no exception! I substituted the butter with olive oil like everyone else here, and also used slightly less garlic, because 3 cloves just seemed to be a lot for the amount of marinade this recipe makes. It was a huge hit with the rest of my family and I'll definitely make it again!

I've made this twice, once with butter and once with olive oil. The olive oil version was actually better, turns into a nice thick marinade in the food processor. Really great!

My family loved this, the chicken was delicious. Not a single thing left on their plates. My only complaint was that the butter does not make a good "marinade". I think I'll use olive oil for the marinade next time and save the butter mixture for basting and garnishing. I will definitely be making this one again though.

It seems that I am building some great recipes on the grill lately. This one is no exception but can't imagine using butter (it usually burns too much when grilled) so agree with others that Olive Oil is best.   Have all this fresh rosemary growing and trying to find recipes to use it up.   Thanks and the only change is to use the oil. Sometimes I also use vegetable oil and that works fine.

Tried this last weekend and it was very good.  I used butter only, per the instructions, and really liked it that way.  I did not mix the marinade in a food processor but just threw it in there.  Instead of lemon zest, I cut up the rind and added.  For the leftover marinade, I heated to a boil and poored over the cooked chicken. Next time I'll make more marinade to add to the finished product.  Thanks for the recipe!

I used this marinade for chicken wings. I added a bit more olive oil, garlic and lemon juice and marinaded the wings overnight in plastic bags in the fridge. Great flavor!!

This was very good. Though, I thought it was a bit too much rosemary. It was never mentioned whether it to use the full sprigs or pluck the leaves and chop. I think my problem wound up being that I plucked the leaves and chopped them. The rosemary flavor was over powering. I didn't have any lemons to zest, but I did have Realemon lemon juice. Other than that, it was actually pretty tasty. Not something I'd make often though. Wish I could give a 3.5 stars.

This was delicious but I am giving it 4 stars because the original recipe is a little confusing.  I says to blend butter, but doesn't say to melt it.  I tried blending it for 20 mins because I thought it was supposed to be a rub (like for roast turkey) and finally "nuked" it for 45 secs.  The lemon juice wouldn't mix with the butter until it was melted.  Next time I will remember to look at the other reviewers comments first and just use olive oil.  But otherwise this was sooooo good, especially on the grill.

All in all, a great recipe, but I think the lemon waaay overpowered the rosemary. I did use real butter, and it DOES make a difference, people! I also think that melting the mixture and pouring over the chicken did better than rubbing in the gooey mess. I only marinated for about 20 min, and it was more than enough!

After you substitute olive oil for the butter called for in this recipe, this is a 5 star keeper!  Loved it!  This chicken is moist, flavorful, and beautiful!  I used an extra clove of garlic b/c we are garlic lovers, but everything else was perfect for us.  Instead of blending everything, I coarsely chopped the rosemary and garlic, then crushed them together in a mortar & pestle.  I wanted to still have the little bits of rosemary & garlic still visible in the basting & topping.  It presents nicely that way!  Added that to the olive oil, with lemon juice & zest, then mixed it all up!  The marinade was so pretty and fragrant!  Poured half of it into a ziploc with the chicken breasts & let them marinade for 6 hours in the fridge.  Grilled on the dbl burner stovetop grill pan until each side looked good, basted, then threw the whole grill pan into the oven to broil for a couple minutes each side to finish it off.  Topped with the remaining rosemary lemon mix to serve.  Perfect!  Thank you for this fantastic dish!  :)

Great recipe I've made more than a dozen times and my family loves this as the foundation of a Mediterranean meal. Our suggestions:  1. Double the marinade, using olive oil instead of butter and eliminating most or all of the lemon zest. Cut chicken breasts or tenders into bite-sized pieces, place in zip-lock bag and pour on 3/4 of the marinade to sit for at least 3 hours.  2. Pour chicken and marinade into skillet and cook for 12-15 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through. 3. While chicken is cooking, blend remaining 1/4 of marinade with a mixture of fresh veggies cut in bite-sized chunks (green, yellow and red peppers, zucchini, summer squash, red or sweet onion, mushrooms), spread them on a foil-covered pan and broil for 10 minutes, stirring often to keep from burning. Cook until veggies crisp-tender. 4. Serve the chicken/sauce and veggies with brown or wild rice (we love Traders Joe's Brown Rice Medley), pitas, hummus, and a Greek salad for a GREAT Mediterranean meal!!

This was excellent.  I modified it a little bit since I don't have a food processor and didn't want to get my blender dirty.  I just put the lemon juice, garlic powder, and rosemary in the ziploc bag that I had the chicken it (thawing out).  I skipped the butter, used garlic power instead of minced garlic, I also skipped out on the lemon zest.  I had planned on making it outside but it turned on rainy and cold I cooked it on the george foreman grill, it was great and I plan on making it again this week sometime.  Unfortunately not tonight since I won't have time to let it soak in the juice.

Actually tripled this recipe for dinner for guests...they like being my guinea pigs when I try new recipes.  They all loved this.  I also took the advise of others and used half olive oil, half butter.  I also marinated it for about 6 hours.  It was excellent.  I will certainly make this again.

Very good! We cooked ours over low heat (charcoal grill) for a longer period, though. They came out so delicious! We are definitely using this recipe again. The next time I make it, though, I'm going to substitute oil for the butter, and I'm going to marinate the chicken over night. We'd love to try this with fish, too!

Great recipe. I used half butter, and hald EVOO though. Makes it a tiny bit healthier I think *LoL* Very flavourful, and juicy :)

My family and I weren't very impressed with this marinade. I followed it exactly, except instead of 3 hours of marinating time, I let it go about 5 1/2. I worried that the lemon would become too strong but there wasn't much flavor at all to the chicken. It smelled amazing, but ended up quite bland.

Terrific and easy. We need dairy-free so substituted olive oil for the butter. Delicious and very light. Perfect for summer dinner.

I used a stick of butter and a couple splashes of olive oil, juice and zest of 2 lemons and several ounces of orange juice.  Like others, i used dried rosemary, a couple shakes of red pepper flakes, some dried garlic and onion.  I also added about 1.5 t. each of kosher salt and sugar.  It turned out tasty but I think I used too much zest as the reserved marinade was too bitter.  Next time I will add more sugar to help balance the sour and bitter.

Just marinated the chicken with all of the marinade, grilled and served. Easy recipe and had all ingredients on hand (rosemary from my herb garden) We all loved it and I will definitely make it again.

This was awesome! Added some red pepper flakes for spice and with the 1/3 of marinade and 1/3 of basting parts I added some mayo.....it helps from sticking on the grill and the chicken comes out so moist!  My daughter and her B/F loved it!  Will make it again and again!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was pretty good.  Hubby liked it, but I thought it had too much lemon.  I also had trouble blending the butter mixture.  I started out in the blender, then moved to the food processor, where it blended it a little more.  I would recommend chopping the rosemary first and seasoning the mixture with salt and pepper.  I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup olive oil, but I think it would work much better with all olive oil.

I followed this recipe (except the amounts)including the butter (not oil) for half a fryer. It marinated from 9-5 and in the oven at 350 for 45 minutes. It really was moist!

Excellent recipe - only 4 stars instead of 5 though because I made a change by using olive oil instead of butter.  It tasted great.  I served it for a Labor Day bbq and everyone raved about it (and the kids couldn't get enough of it).  Will definitely do this one again.

Who thought of using butter in a marinade? That was a disaster - it solidified the minute it touched the cold chicken, so it was very difficult to spread and only use a little at a time. Switch the butter to olive oil, and it would be fine.

Used EVO marinated overnight.  I will use less rosemary next time.  Alittle to over powering.  I did not bast or save any to pour on after cooking.  Just squirted a little fresh lemon juice after cooking.  Yummy. Kids loved it.

Terrific! I used olive oil instead of butter, only marinated my chicken for 2 hours and didn't even baste it while grilling and it was still fantastic! If I can be this lazy with grilling and it still turn out beautifully, it is definately a keeper.

I could not believe how tasty this was! My husband and son gobbled it up. Next time, I am going to double the recipe so I will have more sauce to baste with, and then pour overtop of the chicken when it's served. I do not have a food processor, so I used an immersion blender to mix up all the ingredients, and it took a while to get all the fresh rosemary chopped up finely enough to use in a sauce, but it was worth it!

My family really loved this chicken.  I used olive oil also instead of butter as other suggested and marinated it in a plastic bag for 3 hours.  The chicken was tender and had a great flavor.  I will make this again.

Following the others advice, I used 2 tablespoons of melted I Cannot Believe It's Not Butter and the remaining amount in olive oil.  Also marinated breasts, wings and boneless skinless thighs for 2 hours-maybe best chicken we ever had!!  Way better than same name dish from caterer in New York last week.

This gave the chicken a great flavor. Next time I will use olive oil instead of butter.  I put some on the grill and baked some and liked the baked chicken better, it held the flavor better.

Chicken looked like it had been in brine.  Used olive oil per reviews.  Won’t make again.  Too many other options kids like better.

First of all, I had to chuckle at everyone saying that they can't understand how butter would marinate the chicken and they used olive oil instead; both are oils, and it's not the oil that makes it marinate - it's the acid in the lemon juice!  I've tried the recipe with both butter and with olive oil, and they're both good.  The butter tastes much better when it's added after cooking, though!  I used my Braun stick blended to pulverize and blend everything, and it worked great.  This is an easy and yummy recipe for the grill.

I think this recipe would be fantastic on shrimp or fish. It was good with chicken, but the lemon was a little strong,-and i only had time to let  it marinade for 1hour. I reduced the butter to two Tablespoons and 
I had trouble with the butter solidifying, so next time I would just use oil or replace it with water. 
I ended up baking it covered at 375 until reached an enteral temperature of 175. The chicken was really moist and tender this way.

We thought this was a good recipe.  I followed other reviewers advice, and used 1/4 C olive oil instead of the butter called for.  I also added about 1/4 C plain yogurt to the marinade.  I marinated chicken tenders about 6 hours.  The only change I would make is to increase the garlic.  Again, following others suggestions, we also grilled thickly sliced potatoes, brushing them with the extra marinade, too.  They were an excellent addition to the meal.

I used 1/2 butter, 1/2 olive oil. I marinated overnight and then cooked on the foreman grill.  I tasted without extra sauce and then spread some over the chicken and tried it. Definitely delicious with extra. The lemon flavor cooks out so you definitely want to put more on at end so you can enjoy the hint of lemon. This sauce/marinade would be great on pork too.

I wasn't sure what to expect from this marinade as it didn't seem like a marinade, but it was awesome!! Nice and juicy. I didn't change a thing... made it as written.  What an awesome summer dish!

It was really good and easy to prepare.  I was concerned about the amount of Rosemary and cut it down to 1/3 cup but shouldn't have been worried.  Next time I will use the full 1/2 cup.  The one change I made after reading other reviews was I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup olive oil.  This is a keeper!!

I wish I had read the reviews before I attempted this recipe.  My experience was like others in that the butter did not "pour" like a marinade.  And I used a mixer instead of a food processor because I don't think we could ever get the processor cleaned!  Refrigerating the mixture after spreading over the chicken didn't allow for marinading either, so the chicken had no flavor to it after I grilled it.

Loved this tasty dinner. Followed the recipe as is except I did not have time to marinate for 3 hours and melted the butter. Still got rave reviews. Great combination of flavours.  Next time I will try to follow the marinating time and  I might even try the olive oil substitution.

I didn't have time to marinade and I was going after a really tender chicken, so instead I simmered it all in a large fry pan on the stove. I used olive oil instead of butter and I added a little water so the chicken was further covered and let it simmer for awhile with the lid off so the extra water would evaporate and then turned the heat down and let it simmer until the chicken came up to 165 degrees. I flipped the chicken several times and occasionally spooned the sauce over the chicken. Turned out super tender, rich and flavorful.  This will become one of my new go to's.

Does the author know how much Rosemary 1/2 cup is? It's huge!  You would need the entire plant to get 1/2 cup.
Also, do you know what you get when you combine 1-stick of butter (i.e. 1/2 cup), 1/4 cup of lemon juice, and 1oz of Rosemary in a food processor? Paste! After microwaving the paste to get a liquid, it won't cover 6 chicken breasts. And dividing it into thirds, makes it even worse.  This will cover 4 breasts, if they're not too big.
The chicken came out ok, but even using only 1oz of Rosemary, the Rosemary flavor was overwhelming. Just go eat the Rosemary plant if you like it that much.

Wonderful flavour. I let the marinade sit in a bowl for approx 5 hours before to adding it to the chicken. 
Will definitely make this again.

Delicious but using olive oil next time instead of butter.  The mixture made with butter is not a marinade, it was not pourable and very hard to get it to stick to the chicken.

Family loved it. Minor tweaks: melted the butter so it would blend more easily, and baked in the oven rather than barbecuing, for convenience. Basted a couple of times while baking. Will make again soon.

Very juicy and delicious. I used olive oil and added a bit of Dijon. The sauce accidentally got on the zucchini I grilled with the chicken and it was great on those as well.

Prepared this for extended family dinner on Sunday - it was a hit!  Delicious flavor and tender from the lemon juice in marinade.  Used real butter and found that I had to melt the half used to marinate the meat as it wan't sticking to when in semi-solid form.

I used it for drumsticks on the BBQ.  I didn't have a blender at the cottage so tried to mix it with a hand mixer which didn't go well so we heated it in the microwave and that wired better.   The flavor was amazing and this is definitely a keeper.  I think I will try the suggestion of olive oil instead of butter next time. N

Followed the directions &  enjoyed a new meal I will make again!  I had both skinless boneless chicken thighs and drumsticks. Both were delicious, but the drumsticks take a bit longer to cook.  I l'll be making this again.

Made as written.  It was pretty good.  I didn't have time to let it marinade long, so next time I will make it ahead so hopefully the flavors will be a little stronger.  Overall an easy dish to prepare and the flavors worked well together.

Pleasantly surprised at the savory flavors. I used garlic flavored olive oil instead of butter and grilled on my george foreman given the rainy weather. Juicy and succulent. Even my picky son enjoyed the flavors.

Used EVOO and it turned out good.  I expected more flavor from the  chicken with the rosemary and grilling.  But it was easy to make, looked great coming off the grill, versatile and the kids loved it. Can't beat that!

I doubled the recipe using Olive oil and then added 6 tbs of butter.  This gave it a great creamy texture that can marinate easily. I poured the cream sauce into 2 separate bowels one for brushing on the chicken while grilling , one for spooning onto the served chicken. The reminder i used as the marinate.  It had a great taste.

I made this exactly as set forth in the recipe; however, I had trouble spreading it on the chicken,  so I melted it in the microwave and brushed it on. The chicken was absolutely delicious! My husband loved it. The fresh lemon juice, lemon zest and fresh rosemary makes a mouth watering meal.

We subbed olive oil for the butter and baked instead of grilling. Only had time to marinate for 30 minutes, but still great flavor.

Fantastic. When panfrying, I even added chopped carrots and basted them as well. As suggested, used olive oil instead of butter and I marinated it overnight.

I am ashamed of myself for following this recipe, this is NOT a marinade, it's a compound butter that does nothing on the chicken.  The owner of this recipe needs to edit it!!

Taste is good, but I cooked in oven grill so it was a bit too dry. Next time I will try to cook in outside grill should be a better taste.

I made this Easter Sunday. I thought it was good. Changed the way I cooked it as I put it into the pressure cooker. Layed some large lemon slices on the bottom of cooker and put chicken and rest of ingredients on top. cooked in 20 minutes.

I have made this exactly as written and it was delicious, albeit more difficult to slather the chicken with the butter mixture than a typical marinade. I now substitute olive oil for the butter and it is much easier and tastes just as good. This is my 9 year old daughter's favorite recipe! Thank you for sharing!

I exchanged olive oil for the butter. 
Also I used a whole chicken - cut
In 1/2 with back bone removed. 
Charbroiling it was fantastic!

Ok, i didnt make this as directed, because my dinner plans morphed & I didnt have time to do the marinade for 3hrs. I subbed butter for olive oil, and marinated for 1 hour. Then I cooked on the stove in butter (that could have been olive oil too; next time). The flavor was great! It is a perfect pairing to mac n cheese!

Easy, tasty, and tender. Great lemon taste throughout the chicken. I used 4 chicken breasts and all of the sauce. They were  perfectly seasoned .I will certainly make this again.
Yummy.

Good recipe as written, but with some issues. When prepared as written,  the butter tended to congeal in the fridge. After half an hour, I was marinating in pure citrus with herbs. 


Still liking the rosemary and lemon flavors, however, I modified it, subbing olive oil for butter and that was good, albeit too acidic.]


The best mod I came up with, which I think I'll post after I get it nailed since it is a new recipe -- was to make the citrus, both juice and zest, half orange and  half lemon. The orange added a hint or sweetness that the original recipe lacked. This modified recipe, BTW, worked even better when marinading a  whole chicken before slow-cooking it at 250 on my grill and smoking the meat with apple wood...

I didn't use it as a marinade. Instead I made a pan sauce out of the lemon and rosemary. I pan fried the chicken, then added the garlic for about 2 min, added the lemon zest, juice, Rosemary, 1 tsp "better than bouillon" chicken and 1 cup of water. Heated until hot, about 3 min and then I poured the sauce over the chicken and used it as gravy for mashed potatoes. Excellent!

This was very good. Like others, the butter marinade seemed like it may not work really well, so I used olive oil for the marinade and made a compound butter to baste and finish the chicken with. I did add a squirt of Dijon to the marinade. Everyone like this one! I will be making it again  for sure.

This is darn good.  I followed advice and cut the butter with olive oil.  My guests loved it and used the remaining marinade as a topping for broccoli.

Will try it with olive oil instead of butter as the butter did not make a spreadable or liquid marinade...but delicious flavor!

Delicious!  Used half butter & olive oil (like many here) over thighs.  Best part was having some sauce on the side, too!  We really enjoy using our fresh herbs in sauces.  Thanks for an easy & delicious recipe!!

Absolutely perfect as directed. I understand not wanting to use butter as olive oil is more convenient, but that butter is amazing. Had to heat the original marinade which wasn't called for. Added the extra butter to a baked potatoes which was amazing. This will now be a house staple.

Very tasty. I personally love rosemary, so I might be a bit biased. I used olive oil instead of butter, but kept everything else the same. Great recipe!

I made this as written, using the butter called for.  I had to grill it inside on the George Foreman grill.  It was not overly special, but tasted good and was good on a green salad.

Great flavors.  Like other reviewers, I used half olive oil ad half butter.  I only marinated for an hour so I would guess that the flavors would be more intense if I marinated longer.  We already have plans to make it again.

Excellent. I used olive oil and didn't marinate, just coated the chicken with it then sauteed in a bit of olive oil. My husband and I both enjoyed the taste and he isn't even a huge fan of lemon.

Oh my goodness this was great!! I made it for Father's Day for my husband with grilled corn on the cob and salad. The only issue I had with it was at first there wasn't enough of the wonderful mixture to marinade, to baste, and to use as topping. So I just doubled the mixture and it worked out and tasted awesome. It got eaten up so quickly that I wasn't able to get photos, will think ahead next time.

This is a lovely recipe. I didnt use butter in the marinade coz quite frankly thats never gonna work!! I cooked it on a disopable bbq which probably isnt the best idea, but it still tasted good!! Next time I do it on the "george" I made a tomato risotto to go with it which worked prefectly!!!

this was just moderate for me.  tasted ok, and was simple enough, but I think  it was a little overkill on the rosemary for me.  if I try this again, I'll definitely use it sparingly.

I said 5 stars, my boyfriend said 4 with a potential for 5 if the chicken had been grilled.  As it was, I made the recipe with olive oil instead of butter and 1-1.5 tbs of dried rosemary instead of fresh.  I let it marinade all day while at work, and then baked it in the oven.  Very moist and flavorful!  We look forward to grilling it next time.

The marinade was both fragrant and tasty.  I grilled thighs and legs.  Wished the skin would have been crisper.  Don't know whether this type marinade keeps it soggy or if I didn't have enough patience to let it cook the extra amount of time necessary for crispy skin.  I think it was likely the latter.  Will definitely try again.  The family loved it.

This recipe is sensational! I doubled the lemon juice (for more of a tenderizer) but left out the zest, fearing it would be too lemony. It wasn't at all... infact, next time, I think I'll add the zest! The chicken is SO tender and flavorful... can't wait to make this again!

I gave this 4 stars for ease of preparation. I used my blender and it came together quickly; I substituted oil as others suggested and it was fine. I was afraid the rosemary would be too strong a flavor, so I cut back. Next time, I will put in more fresh rosemary, as we have it growing in our garden. The chicken was moist, but lacked the flavor "punch" I was hoping for.  But thanks - my husband LOVED it!!
