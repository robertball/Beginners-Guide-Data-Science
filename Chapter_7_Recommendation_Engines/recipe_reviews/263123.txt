I added 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper and probably 1/2 Tbsp of salt and this recipe was still very bland. I would recommend increasing the spices by 25% and adding a full tsp of cayenne. Also when you serve this over rice it really diluted the flavor.

It was pretty tasty.  I added extra garlic and next time I think I would add more green beans.  It seemed a little “soupy” to me  so I served it over rice.

I was eager to make and taste this, and followed all instructions. I couldn't believe how bland it was, no heat or spice at all. Then I realized the recipe has no curry (it's called Indian Curry in the title?) It needs it. I may make it again with my own take on all the spices, garam masala , curry, more cumin etc.  Add the spices!!

It was ok. I don’t think I will be making this again. It was very bland.

I agree with the other reviewers - increasing the spices by 25% would make this a 5 star recipe!

I made this but did not use the lentils. Instead I added potatoes, kale, sweet peppers and chickpeas. I also did not use vegetable stock, I used the starch water from

I agree, it needed more spice. And I added a couple tablespoons of tomato paste. But overall great taste! My 4.5 year old and 16 month old both gobbled it up!

I prepared exactly as written, plus I added one small summer squash that I had on hand. We enjoyed it quite a bit. I will definitely make this again, and can imagine adding or substituting other veggies.

The lovely part of making Indian cuisine is the flexibility.   I chose to use coconut oil, which is more traditional.  I also seasoned with curry powder as I was out of turmeric.  As with any dish,the seasonings can be adjusted for personal taste.  I’ll definitely make this again.

Really easy and very tasty, I did however add some cayenne pepper to add a bit of heat. It might also be nice with some potato in it.I served it with garlic naan bread. My husband loved it too. Thanks.
