The original recipe is amazing!  I tried making this recipe a little healthier by substituting applesauce for the oil, but the granola bars just got a funny chewy texture to them.  I also decreased the brown sugar to 1/4 c and I like the sweetness a little more.  I think next time I'll make 1/4 c oil & 1/4 c applesauce.  Otherwise, this is such a great recipe, don't change it if you don't want to! (I'm a nutrition major so I always try to make recipes healthier, but it may take away from the original results.) Thanks for the great recipe, Ilene!

There is so much to do with this recipe. I've made it 10 different ways and the best includes 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce. You can also omit the white or wheat flour by substituting OAT FLOUR instead - they still taste delicious. They are a little firmer this way, which I like, so be sure to add 2 eggs instead of 1. I also substituted flax meal for wheat germ. Best with lots of chocolate chips and dried berries! My husband asks for this every week. Thanks!

The first time around I used the full 3/4 cup brown sugar and I personally thought it was too sweet, but all the women at work loved them! 

Don't put too much weight on my mention of the brown sugar though ---- because I always lower the sugar content for my little who's only 2 yrs old. I try to make healthy snacks for her with just a touch of sweetness, not too much! So we use 1/4 cup brown sugar, but we still use ALL the honey! They are slightly moist and chewy and can be made with such a variety of nuts and dried fruits that it can always be a different batch than before!! Thanks for a terrific recipe.

My family absolutely loves this recipe.  My friend and I doubled the recipe and used a jelly-roll pan.  We made 2 batches of 6 different combinations and ended up with 540 granola bars which we individually wrapped and froze.  My family went through our half in a month and a half!!  They are great in lunches or after school snacks.  Here are the combinations we used: crushed oreo, recess pieces with peanuts, mixed dried fruit with sunflower seeds and coconut (sunshine bars), craisins and almonds, s'mores, toffee & mini chocolate chips.   Some were a litte chewier than others, but all of them were delicious!!  Todays new combination is nutter butter cookies with peanut butter chips on top. yummy!!!

Love this recipe.  I make variations on it constantly - never the same twice.  I often use up whatever open packages are left after other baking, our favorites are choc chips, raisins, slivered almonds, craisins, coconut & M&Ms.  I often use corn syrup instead of honey.  I sometimes substitute old fashioned oats for 1/2 the quick oats.  I have recently started adding 1/3 C dry milk powder and think I will always make them that way now.  I only cook them 20 minutes.

Wonderful recipe, thank you!             I decreased the amount of honey slightly and added 1/2 cup of peanut butter and 1/2 cup chopped peanuts for a crunchier peanut butter taste; they disappeared!

This is an awesome base recipe. I made them last night and they're already half gone! Here are the changes I made:
* reduced brown sugar to 1/4 cup
* substituted 1/2 of applesauce for the oil
* used 1 cup raisins
* used 1/2 cup walnuts, sunflower seeds, chopped almonds
It wasn't too sweet at all and the perfect chewiness and texture! A bit bland, though. I would suggest a darker honey or more cinnamon for more flavour next time.

This recipe should be in everyone's home. It is easy and quick to make.  And YOU KNOW what is in it. (Two eggs make these alittle softer.) These are a quick breakfast and, too,  a great snack, as well, for anyone "on the go". Thank-you, Ilene!! Pati

I've made this recipe several times.    The first was for my fourth graders as a snack, following the recipe exactly.  The next two times, I experimented with dates, cranberries, almonds, and pecans. (I also used Brown sugar Splenda in one mix.) EVERY one of the combinations was a winner. I made one batch for the PTA bake sale; I've even had to give the recipe to other teachers AND my students.  In  my book, this is a winner not only for flavor, but for nutrition as well.  My students want to know when I'll be baking them again!!

I have made these many times since finding this recipe & it is the best granola recipe I have tried! Each time it's perfect and fantastic!  I have made them for myself the first time with Old Fashioned Oats and they were scrumptious, my husband who hates walnuts ate these up with me then and wanted more.  (I did not tell them walnuts were in them!!)  I made them again with the Quick Oats and without Raisins and also other times and wow, these are so gorgeous and delicious! I do increase the Vanilla to 1 Tablespoon and the Cinnamon to 1 heaping teaspoon.  My husband says the house smells like Christmas when I make thse!  I love to make them, its so easy and they are indeed nutritious!!  These are wonderful.  Mine are done in exactly 22 minutes.  I pull them out of the oven and immediately slice them up into nice bars.  Then I wait for them to cool & the uneven ends I toss into a tupperware container so we can snack as we want on these smaller ends.  I also put about 8 bars in each sandwich freezer bags together for each of us.  I label the freezer bags with his or mine & when we are running out we simply pull out a bag of our own granola bars!  YUM! Simply wonderful. The last time I made mine I replaced molasses for the honey in the recipe and you know the taste is the same.  Maybe its just me.  These are delicious, not really sweet at all and just wonderful.  It is a full proof recipe!  The next time I make them I will add some peanut butter!  Thank you for posting!

I forgot to add the brown sugar and I used pistacio nuts instead of walnuts. Although it was a bit crumbly they were really tasty!

I will make them again!

This was really simple for me to make in the morning before my oldest went to school. I made a couple substitutions because I had to use what was on hand. I used whole wheat flour, I cut the brown sugar down to a quarter cup, I used homemade pumpkin pie spice and homemade low-sugar maple syrup instead of honey. I also used Craisins instead of raisins. These smelled off the charts yummy even before baking and my older boy was so pleased, he said "Wow, Mom....you made those for me?" I cut them into bars and wrapped them individually for each daily lunch. I don't know why I ever bought granola bars, since this is so much more healthy than the store bought, nevermind easier. Next time, I'd like to try another dried fruit and perhaps pecans. I'm glad I cut the sugar back, I think it would have been WAY too sweet if I hadn't.

WAY too sweet,but tasty anyway!To those who complained of blandness and/or texture problems : you probably OVERBEAT the mixture which will cause the gluten in the flour to "jump up". This is desirable in bread,but NOT desirable in tender-crumb baked goods such as cakes,cookies,and these granola bars.

Wow! I was encouraged by other reviewers to make this recipe to my tastes, so I did. I used applesauce for 1/2 the oil, used dried cranberries (for raisins) and pecans (for walnuts), substituted whole wheat pastry flour, used only 1/3 cup brown sugar, threw in some raw peanuts and replaced some of the wheat germ with milk powder and some of the honey with crunchy peanut butter. I had a feeling this recipe would work anyway, and it really did. Very yummy! Mine cooked about 27 minutes on parchment paper. Buttered hands helped to spread the batter and make sure it was pressed together well.

Incredible! I was looking for something that would rival chewy store-bought, and this recipe did it! My boyfriend is allergic to nuts, but I had no trouble substituting! Just used 1 1/4 cups of a variety of dried fruits, etc. in place of raisins and walnuts. Awesome!

Really didn't care for this recipe. Like other members said, too cookie like. And not a good oatmeal cookie to boot. Lacking in flavor. Added extra cinnamon (to 1 tsp), added a 1/4 tsp almond extract to go with the almonds I added and still found it bland.  If you like cakey bars you may like this but still go with the extra cinnamon or you won't find it flavorful enough.

I have made these "as is" and they've turned out great. I recently made them with the following changes and they turned out even better than 5 stars! Changes: used 2 eggs for a chewier granola, used 1/2 the honey and 1/2 the sugar called for, cooked at 330 degrees until slightly browned on the edges and score as soon as take them out of the oven. ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!

First time cooking granola bars. Perfect, great, love them. Doubled the batch and I don't think they'll last a week. Made one batch with the raisins and the second with mini chocolate chips. Thanks a ton!

My son has Type 1 diabetes so I try to use Stevia in place of sugar for making his snacks. Well, it came out great!  This is what I used: 2c. long cooking oats, 1c. freshly milled wheat flour, a little less than 2 Tbs. of Stevia powder, 1c.raisens, 1/2c. Wheat Germ, 1/2 tsp.sea salt, 1 tsp.cinnamon, 1/2c.pecans, 2/3c.Coconut Oil, 1/2c.Honey, 1 whole egg and 2tsp vanilla extract.  He loves them and so do we!  I will add some extras next time to try to give him a little variations. I did use a lot of suggestions from other reviewers and felt like I made a successful granola bar.  I baked mine in a 9x13 stone (bar pan), they came out thin and more like a nature valley granola bar-crunchy but not TOO crunchy. I used parchement paper for a liner. 

Awesome recipe and I will be making this a lot for sure!  Thanks for recipe and all of the suggestions!

I've tried many different versions since the original and each one's come out great... all of my friends love em... perfect snack before my work out... I've tried apple and cinnamon (use 2tsp cinnamon instead of 1/2 with minced canned apples), maple and walnut and chocolate versions.. have fun making em!

these were great!!! tasted so much like the natural valley ones, and oh so much cheaper. I didn't even use two bowls - I just mixed all the dry ingreds in one bowl and added the oil and honey and egg to that bowl (I am lazy!!) and mixed it all with a fork! easy to make, very flexible recipe, and delish. I didn't have wheat germ handy so I added an extra 1/2 cup of flour. I added some chopped bittersweet choc. and reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup. next time I will add other dried fruit. I scored them while hot and then broke them when they cooled- good thing because they were a bit firm. these will definately become a regular in our pantry.

Very good!  I used parchment paper in my baking pan and did not spray it.  After reading the previous reviews, I decreased the sugar to 1/4 cup (but next time I may increase to 1/2 cup) and used half oil and half applesauce (I'll do that again), and used 1/2 cup all purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour (will do that again).  I also used 1/2 cup raisins and 1/4 cup dried cherries, as well as 1/4 cup chocolate chips.  Next time I will use mini chips, so they will be more evenly distributed.  I think I will also add more raisins/cherries/blueberries or other dried fruit, up to 1 cup.  I may also increase the nuts to  3/4 cup.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It is, indeed, easy to make and delicious!

These are quite good.  I substitute 1/3 cup all-purpose flour, 1/3 cup whole wheat flour, and 1/3 cup almond meal for the 1 cup of flour.  My favorite combo is craisins, slivered almonds, and white chocolate chips.  Perfect to take to work for lunch.  My only problem is that sometimes I can't wait until lunch to eat them!

Very Good!  I replaced half of the oil with apple sauce as another suggested. I also cut the brown sugar to 1/2 c and that was plenty.  Used choc. chips, raisins and cranberries as I wanted them to be nut free for school.  Very easy to make.  Will  be making them all the time!

This is a really easy recipe. My kids eat this all up in a few days. I use applesauce instead of oil, chocolate chips instead of raisins and no nuts (the kids are picky) and they turn out soft and delicious. Make these!

Just made two batches, one with just choc chips and the other with walnuts and golden raisins. I felt like the amount of oats wasn't enough so I put in another cup. However, I used Agave Nectar instead of honey, and flax seed instead of wheat germ, so I'm thinking it seemed really wet because the density and texture of those ingredients isn't like what's in the original recipe. I needed to bulk it up a bit more. Agave has a much lower glycemic index and I cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup like many of the other reviewers suggested. I feel like these bars should be heartier and not such a sugar treat. But frankly, I think it was not the best decision. They could have been sweeter, chewier and less crumbly. Next time I will stick closer to the recipe provided. I'm giving 5 start regardless because it was my error. I'm sure they will be even better next time.

I've made many, many granola bar recipes searching for the perfect one... so far, this is the best recipe I've tried!!! I really like raisins, chocolate chips and pecans, but the combination possibilities are endless! I also use half applesauce/half oil instead of all oil. Adding an extra egg seems to help hold it all together if you have trouble with crumbling.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!!  My husband only eats granola bars for breakfast everyday.  It was getting really expensive to keep buying them, so I thougt I would try making them.  I have made them twice now and about to make them again.  They are super easy to make.  I love how you can take the basic recipe and add or subtract items.  I only had about 1/4 cup of honey so I filled the rest of the measuring cup with corn syrup and they came out just fine.  I also cut back the brown sugar to 1/2 cup.  After reading other reviews I cut the baking time to 15 minutes.  They don't look done but they come out perfectly.  My two year old son loves them too!!  Awesome Recipe!!

These came out with a perfect texture - chewy and delicious. Everyone loved them. I did find they were sweet (not that the kids or my husband minded), and next time will try reducing the sugar. I have found the trick for granola bars is to press them VERY firmly into the pan for those who have difficulty with them holding together. Also, I used a 7x11 pan as it didn't seem to be filling out a 9x13 pan well enough, and cooked for 25 minutes. Mine looked much like the first picture except I added chocolate chips.

These were wonderful and a hit at our house with everyone but my 8 year old daughter. I made one batch with dried cranberries and almonds (no raisens) and one with mini chocolate and peanut butter chips. Very handy to grab along with an apple on the way out the door for work, great travel food. TIP: roll these out in the pan using a small hand-held rolling pin, mine's a Pampered Chef one. It works like a dream.

I haven't tried as posted but tried the suggestions of SIXMITTS...most excellent.  No raisins because I don't like them.  Used pumpkin seeds instead of walnuts and subbed some ground flax seed for the wheat germ.  If you use dried fruit, you could cut back on the sugar even more.  Really versatile. Thanks for the recipe.

Very good and easy to make. I used whole wheat flour in place of all purpose. I think they taste better the next day.

I think what is missing from this recipe is baking or toasting the oats and coconut (and sunflower seeds if you so desire).  I also found the addition of the egg a little odd and was not very impressed with the way mine turned out.  To try and salvage them, I dunked them in melted bark chocolate.

My kids love Granola bars and I buy at least box a week at my local heath food store $4.49 for 10 bars.  I was able to make my own with items from the bulk bins and stuff in my cupboard for $3.29 for 27 bars.  The best part is I can pronounce everything in them and they taste great!

I really like this recipe. Very easy and a healthy alternative to store-bought granola bars! Instead of wheat germ I used Ground Flax Seed and Hemp Hearts and Craisins in place of raisins as well as almonds instead of walnuts. I also took the advice from another reviewer and added 1/2 the amount of oil replacing the other half with applesauce. Next time I will remove the oil all together and strictly use applesauce.

This recipe is a keeper... I baked them for only 20 min. and they were perfect.  It comes out as a chewy bar.  I used whole wheat flour and choc. chips in place of the walnuts.  Good stuff.

excellent!  I didn't have honey, so I substituted 3/4 cup applesauce (I also wanted them a little chewy).  I added about 1/3 cup flaxseed too.  Used pecans instead of walnuts.

Chewy, tasty, and good for you!

I'm really glad I tried these! I substituted the raisins and walnuts with dried cherries and chopped almonds(due to personal preference). I also used 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of the oil. These bars are very moist and I love the hint of honey. Next time I make these I think I will try using Almond Extract instead of vanilla. I may also try adding some choc. chips for variety. I truly believe the additions to this recipe are endless!! My 5 yr old son rated them "delicious".

So easy to make that my 2 y.o. helped me by mixing the dry ingredients for 2 batches.  I followed the recipe except for the type of nuts/fruits.  I used waxed paper not foil, which made clean-up a snap.  The bars just lift right out of the pan on the paper.  It did help to cut them while warm.  Once cool, I removed them and peeled them off the paper.  I did use the entire egg because I think it adds depth of flavor to have the yolk.  These really tasted good!  The proof?  I made them for a men's softball team - and they loved them!  (and these were no vegetarian guys either!)

These were AWESOME!!! I did a comparison with Nancy Burstein's Chewy Granola Bars and found these to be more like a store bought granola bar. While they weren't like a "Nutrigrain" bar, which was what I was looking for - they were excellent!Great taste, chewy, not too sweet. We're not big raisin fans, so I'm going to experiment with dried cranberries, cinnamon chips, white chocolate chips...Thanks for sharing.

Great bars!!!  Very good.  I had to use 1/4 c flax instead of wheat germ because I was out, and 1c oats 1 cup granola type mix including nuts, rice krispies, a little dried fruit from bars that didn't set up right.  I also used half honey half corn syrup because that was what I had left.  It worked out great even though I didn't have quite everything.  They were nice and chewy and you could sub other things well in this.   Thank you!!!

These were pretty good for not having peanut butter. I sub'd whole wheat flour for wheat germ and that worked out well. Made some with just crushed walnuts and some with just raisins which pleased the kids.

Excellent! Stayed together, too. Used ww pastry flour, 1/4 c. powdered milk, some coconut oil for the vegetable oil, regular organic sugar instead of brown (and only 1/2 c). Will try with chocolate chips and pb next time. Great!

Made this with my students before a field trip.  It did the trick and kept everyone full.  We made three variations- plain, raisin, and blueberry.

Love these! I also discovered lt corn syrup works as well as honey in a pinch, that chocolate chips, coconut, and pecans are also tasty, and it really doesn't need the vanilla. Easy recipe you can really do so much with!

These were really good! I added an extra egg because the mixture was really dry, it was the perfect texture! I subbed almonds, added goji berries, flax and a little coconut. I also cut the brown sugar down to 1/4 cup and used 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce. Delicious!!! Feel free to throw in whatever you want, it's a great base recipe!!

I will give this recipe 5 stars even though i tweaked it a bit because of my liking and forgetfulness because this recipe is really versatile so anyone can mold this into their favorite recipe. My first personal mistake was forgetting the oats. I have cinnamon raisin granola on hand so thats what i used. Instead of raisins i used blueberry craisins(a plus for this recipe!), my store didnt have wheat germ so i just skipped that all together, and lastely i used coctail peanuts with sea salt because we dont like walnuts. I baked it on a 11x13 baking sheet(with a edge to it) and to keep the thickness i wanted i had about 3 1/2 inches left on one side. That empty space spread that edge thinner and made that very edge crunchy(not a big deal, thats what i munched on while packing these up). Overall this is a very good recipe considering my substitutions. My 4 and 1 year old kept wanting more and more! Thanks for this recipe. Oh and i'll mention that i guesstimated on the brown sugar part which was ABOUT 2/3 cups and it wasn't too sweet at all, just right.

Finally I have found a great granola bar recipe!!  The others don't even come close to this one.  It's totally versatile, and you can make it as healthy or unhealthy as you like.  I reduced the sugar to 1/4c as others did, and they were perfect!  I also substituted applesauce for 1/2 of the oil, and even substituted flax seed meal for 1/2 of the remaining oil.  They rocked!  Can't wait to experiment with more ingredients!  Now, if you're looking for a recipe to make crunchy granola bars, this is not it.  But for the soft, moist ones, this is the perfect recipe!

I thought they were going to be too sweet with  all the sugar and honey, and raisins (and I added choc chips) but they were actually too bland. The texture was not that of a granola bar, for sure. We did not enjoy these.

Excellent recipe. I use whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and use 1/4c applesauce and 1/4c oil and they turn out great. I make 2 batches on the weekend and they are our breakfast and snack for the week. Original recipe with raisins is the best, our second favorite is with coconut and butterscotch morsels...YUM!! Thanks for sharing.

I read about all the granola bars on this site and chose to make these.  They turned out great!  I read lots of the reviews and ended up doing 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat flour, sub. flax meal for part of the wheat germ, adding an extra egg, putting in a little less sugar, doing part maple syrup and part honey, adding orange zest and juice to the wet ingredients, adding a little more cinnamon, subbing half applesauce for half of the oil, using a little almond extract because I didn't have vanilla, and most importantly (I think) changing one cup of oatmeal to old fashioned instead of quick.  I used raisins and craisins and baked for about 25 minutes.  The family loves them and are ready to take them on our car trip tomorrow!

Hi, this recipe is awesome! I did make some modifications though after reading some reviews. My updated recpe is below:

•	2 cups quick cooking oats 
•	1 cup whole wheat flour 
•	1/4 c. white sugar- didnt have any brown sugar left :(
•	3/4 cup cranberries
•	1/2 cup ground flaxseed 
•	1/2 teaspoon salt 
•	1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 
•	1/2 cup pumpkin and sunflower seeds 
•	¼ c. applesauce, ¼ c. vegetable oil (i used melted margarine to sub. for oil, i was out of that too!)
•	1/2 cup honey 
•	2 eggs 
•	2 teaspoons vanilla extract
•	 ¾ c. chocolate chips


They turned out delicious, every one in the house loved them! Next time I will try to make it more healthy.. no chocolate:( and try adding protein powder.

These were good, but a little cakey. I used dried cranberries in place of raisins and liked the flavor.

I've been searching for an oatmeal breakfast bar and finally found one that I like!  I made a few modifications.  I omitted the raisins and added approx 1/3 cup chocolate chips instead.  I used whole wheat flour and I also replaced the oil with 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  Yum!

Good recipe and super easy to make.  I baked this as written and will definitely make again but with some variations as suggested by other reviewers.  It was a bit bland otherwise so I definitely recommend adding more but since this recipe is loaded with possibilites, it will be easy to spice up to my family's specifications.   I also recommend baking for 20 minutes. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is fantastic! The variations truly are endless! As other posts mentioned the applesauce was a nice touch. I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. In one batch I used rice krispys for a different texture. We love cinnamon so I used extra in the mix. I tried dried pineapple and loved it. Play with the recipe and enjoy!!

These bars are great and very easy to make. My daughter's school is nut-free, so I replace the nuts with whatever combination of dried fruit and oats works. I also add skim milk powder, replace some of the fat with applesauce, and bake them for only 20 minutes. Kids love them, especially when I use dried cherries.

Loved this recipe! I made some substitutions and additions though. Used whole wheat flour instead of regular, trail mix instead of nuts, and added 1/2 c apple butter, 1/4 c peanut butter, and 1/4 c chocolate peanut butter chips. When putting it in the pan I spread half of it out, then put a thin layer of raspberry preserves, and put the rest of the mix on top. Super chewy and sweet- just what we needed for our 7 mile hike!

We love these.  They are soooooo much better than any store-bought granola bar and much better for you.  Thanks for a great recipe!  Oh - I've also used it as a springboard recipe, changing ingredients each time.  For instance, adding 1 overripe banana, or using chocolate chips and chopped peanuts with natural peanut butter (if you add peanut butter, reduce your oil by half).  Very good!

I really liked the flavor of this recipe. I used half the oil and subsituted the rest with applesauce.  If I make this again I am going to use regular oats insteaf of quick oats because the quick oats cook up and it's more of a cookie texture than a granola bar.  Also I may cook it a little longer and press it out thinner since I like a crunchier granola bar.  You could substitute the raisins for anything probably.

This is a super granola bar recipe.  They are perfect.  Not dry or too chewy.  I followed some reviews and used 1/4 c applesauce and 1/4 c oil.  I also used slivered almonds instead of walnuts and mini m&m in addition to the rasins.  Yummy will make these all the time!

I loved this recipe.  My daughter is allergic to nuts and we can't find commercial granola bars that don't have nuts.  I modified this recipe to omit the nuts and it turned out great.  They are nicely browned and crispy and yet still chewy!  I will definitely make it again.  Its also very easy to mix up and bake!

Very nice and tasty "energy bars".  They get better with age, and if you store them in the fridge, they taste better if you let them get to room temp before eating.

Great recipe as it is forgiving to tweaking which according to my husband I always do. I wanted a recipe that didn't have a lot of added sugar. I substituted dried cherry, apricots, coconut, and all kinds of nuts and different oils. I've even doubled the recipe and it turns out great every time! LOVE this.

These were awesome!  I used dried blueberries, mini chocolate chips, and dried cranberries instead of walnuts and raisins because thats what I had on hand.  Next time I will try using regular oats as opposed to quick quicking and whole wheat flour instead of white.  Thanks IHARVEY!

Okay, but simply too oily. Also, used canola oil,  whole wheat flour and Splenda granulated sugar in place of vegetable oil, AP flour and brown sugar.

Such a quick and delicious recipe.  Even with half the brown sugar it still satisfies my sweet tooth.  I love it with pecans, craisins, and white chocolate chips. YUM!  All four of my kids love these too.

Ok first off - don't change a thing if you think you can improve the taste!  These are AMAZING!!!  We made various ways, but mixed dried fruit is one of our favorities.  Just substitute the nuts and raisins for whatever you prefer.  I even made them once with flaxseed and whole wheat flour -- SOOO good.  Our 2 year old loves them, they're chewy and easy to wrap and take on the go.

Great Granola bars and easy to make.  I only put in 1/2 cup brown sugar.  I probably could have put even less in.  But very good!!

Very good recipe!  I have tried this a couple of different ways with different nuts/dried fruits and it is always good.  I added about 1/4 c. brown sugar the second time and they were still plenty sweet for us.

I pulled these out of my bag in the middle of a 40 mile mountain bike ride. They revived us and one rider even exclaimed, "These are the best granola bars I have ever eaten!"  I did make a few minor changes. I added flax instead of wheat germ. I added a bunch of different types of nuts, chopped well. Instead of raisins, I added a variety of dried fruits like cranberries and mango. I also added some chocolate chips.  I love how versatile this recipe is. I will definitely be making this again. Thanks!

Great granola bar!  Just the chewy-yet-holds-together snack we were looking for!  I cut the  brown sugar down to just a little over 1/4C, substituted sunflower kernels and some shredded coconut for the nuts (hubby's allergic), and didn't have honey so I used brown rice syrup instead.  Sugar could probably even be reduced further.  Baked 25 minutes and they were excellent!  I can see taking this recipe in MANY new directions playing with mix-ins!

Wonderful!  I used dried cranberries in this recipe instead of rasins.  I will be making this again for sure.

Delicious!  My healthnut friend told me to trade crushed bran flakes for flour and applesauce for oil.  Also added 1 tsp nutmeg and you can pretty much use any nuts & dried fruits so I did cherries & pecans.  This is a guilt free snack :)

These were tasty!  A bit gooey, but that was better than being dry.  I left off the nuts and raisins and went straight for mini-chocolate chips.  I also used less sugar.

I LOVE this as a base recipe!!  I have made these about a dozen times and have made a few changes to make them a higher protein bar.  I sub. the flour for half whole wheat flour and half vanilla soy protein powder.  I sub the oil for apple butter or unsweetened applesauce.  I use 1/4 cup b.sugar. I chop up walmart trail mix for nuts and dried fruit.  Its alot cheaper and I always have it on hand.  The tropical trail mix has alot more dried fruit in it.  And last, I double the recipe and put in a cookie sheet.  COmes out great.  Have fun with this recipe.  The possibilities are endless!!

Maybe its because I used old fashioned oats instead of the quick kind, or large eggs; but I did not enjoy these. Suprisingly, they weren't that sweet, and it was alot like eating a very bland oatmeal cookie.

These are great!  Did use 1/2 the oil called for and made up the difference with applesauce.  Wonderful! Add any mixture of dried fruit you like and any kind of nut you like. These are great!

I thought these were so good and easy to make.  I added 1/2 c. dried cranberries, 1/2 c. dried apricots, 1/2 c. walnuts and 1/2 c. sliced almonds. My 3 year old son loved mixing them with his hands and eating them too.

I love this recipe because it is so flexable, after making the base, you can put anything in it you want. I made one with dried fruit & nuts another with choclate chip & nuts & marshmallows. The chocolate chip ones turned out perfect but after cooling, the fruit & nut ones seemed too gooey...no problem, I just put them back in the oven and baked a bit more and they turned out just right. You can have them soft & chewy or a bit crispy, just depends on how long you leave them in the oven. Thank you for the recipe.

This was an awesome recipe! I did do some substitutes though. I didn't have any wheat germ. I added sesame seeds, flax seeds, and vanilla whey protein powder. I also used craisans and reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup due to the added sweetness of the protein powder.Loved it, this is the type of recipe that you can't mess-up.

I have just thrown these in the oven and thought I better right down the changes before I forget, because I think they will be good!
I used 1/2 cup spelt flour, 1/2 cup kamut flour, instead of 1 cup white. 1/2 cup brown, 1/3 cup coconut, 1/3 cup walnut, 1/2 60% cocoa chocolate chips and 1/4 cup hemp seed. 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/4 cup applesauce and the rest was kept the same.
Can't wait to get them cut up,yum.
Well they are cool enough!! The best granola bar recipe I have made..Thank you

Good flavor.  Easy to make.  Texture seems a bit cakey if made according to the directions. Upon making these a multiple times, I've used applesauce instead of oil, adding extra liquid.  If they seem to moist before baking, I add extra old-fashioned oats.  

Other substitutions: 
1 c. old-fashioned oats for 1 c. quick cooking oats; 
whole wheat flour for flour; 
craisins for the raisins

This recipe was pretty good.  (not sure where the picture came from though - mine didn't look like biscuits or cake - more like granola bars)  But anyway, I upped the cinnamon to 1 tsp, added coconut flakes & pumpkin pie spice, eliminated the egg (not sure it was necessary & I am allergic to egg protein).  Really nice bars, a little on the sweet side.  I think next time I will follow some of the other reviewers suggestions and add a little less brown sugar, and maybe a little less oil too - it seemed to come out just a little bit oily - but then again that could have been me going overboard on the non-stick spray too I suppose...  I didn't have parchment paper handy this go 'round.  Will probably use a little less oil next time anyway to try to balance out the coconut and make sure that wasn't the issue.  At any rate, a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe!

Love these!  Instead of walnuts and raisins I substituted 1 1/4 cup of trail mix.  I'll be making these as a healthy alternative to cookies for the holidays.

This recipe was great. I was looking for something tht was tasty but still heathy. This hit the spot. I add pecans insted of walnuts and not at much honey as the recipe called for. I thought that would be a bit to sweet. They still turned out great even with not as much liquid.
Thank for the recipe!

These are very versatile since you can put whatever you'd like into the bars, and they are SUPER healthy.  I needed something nut-free for my daughter's lunch and these were perfect.  I've made a few different versions of these with coconut, chocolate chips, and craisins.  I also cut the brown sugar down to 1/3 cup.

This recipe has become a family favorite!!  I needed to cut down the fat, so here is what I did.  In a 1 C. liquid measuring cup, I put olive oil in to the 1/4 cup line, prune juice (can you believe it?!?!?  and my kids don't even know! :o)) to the 2/3 cup line and then honey to the 1 C. line.  Since honey is expensive, I also tried - 1/4 c olive oil, 1/2 c prune juice, and 1/4 c honey.  It worked great too.  In addition, I tried parchment paper on one batch and foil on another. . .the parchment paper makes them cook faster for some reason, and they aren't as chewy as the foil.  Enjoy and thank you, Ilene, for the original!

Very good and healthy.  I omitted the brown sugar and added applesauce instead and they were still great and moist.  My kids love them and we add different seeds, chocolate chips, and nuts each time!

I served these at a baby shower and everyone asked for the recipe!  I even forgot to put the honey on until there was 5 min left in the oven. I just put the honey on top and let it cook some more.  I kept wanting to eat it afterwards as well!

ABSOLUTELY LOVED this recipe.  My husband hates chewy bars and I don't like crunchy ones. These are perfect for both of us - healthy too!  I just change the fill-ins with each batch and my niece(12) and nephew(9) who are complete junk food junkies even gobble them up.  A permanent addition to my recipe book.

Outstanding!  We added a few tablespoons of peanut butter.  We added coconut, carob chips, and almonds instead of walnuts.  We cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and could have cut it more.  We subbed whole wheat flour for AP flour and added flax meal.  Turned out wonderful!

Just an excellent recipe. I've made it exactly as written and its awesome. I've substituted 1/2 the oil with apple sauce and its great too :-) I've made it with the additions of  1/2 cup bran cereal, whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, 1 cup of flaxseed meal, and the list goes on. This recipe is a great starting point for making up your own granola bar :-) If it ever gets too dry I just add a bit of apple sauce or a little extra oil. Thanks for this recipe Ilene!

We loved these with a few changes.  First, 3/4 cup brown sugar made them a little too sweet, more like an oatmeal cookie, so we cut that to about 1/3 cup and kept all the honey.  If you use a dark honey, you had better like the flavor a lot because it will be strong.  I'd use a light-colored honey so the flavor of the fruit and nuts comes through.  Second, I subbed whole wheat flour for the white to make them healthier.  Third, I used two eggs because that made them both softer and chewier.  We vary the fruits and nuts willy nilly; your favorite combination will be the best of all.

These are so good!  I substituted the oil for applesauce as others have, I also used maple syrup in place of honey which leaves a delicious aftertaste.  Even though the servings are a bit smaller than similar commercial products, they are substantial - you really feel like you have eaten something.  I will make these again.

This was a great recipe, although I did tweak it a bit for my family's needs.  My daughter can't eat wheat, so I used 1 cup of finely ground oats to replace the flour, and 1/2 cup of almond meal (finely ground almonds) in place of the wheat germ.  I used applesauce instead of oil as others had suggested, and used chopped almonds and dried cherries in place of the raisins & walnuts.  And for the finishing touch, almond extract replaced the vanilla.  These had a great consistency, nice and chewy, but not crumbly.  I will definitely make these again!

This is a good recipe but I found them a little dry the first time. If you cover the raisins with water, bring them to a boil and simmer for 3 minutes, then drain them and add them to the wet ingrediants, not the dry, it makes the rsulting bars a little moister and I think absolutely perfect and I use a whol cup of raisins not 3/4.

Wonderful!  These came out as EXACTLY what I was expecting from a Granola Bar.  My young daughter loves these, and goes for them over commercial ones, which is always a sign of a good recipe in MY book.  Can't recommend this one enough.

Great granola bars. It was really versatile. I added mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and sweet dried cranberries to the mix. Also for a low fat version, I substituted apple sauce and egg whites in the recipe. They tasted the best after they cooled for about a day. Great morning bars, too.

I have tried many "granola bar" recipes from this site, and this is our favorite, bar none. ;)
I use a lemon honey and some lemon zest and substitute dried blueberries for the raisins and we love it!

These were great, but they weren't exactly granola bar texture, and mine crumbled much easier than I would have liked. They were good, though. I made mine with no cinnamon, coconut oil, and chocolate chips with almond slivers.

My son, who has dairy peanut and nut allergies, wanted so badly to be able to have a granola bar that my non-baker self broke down and made him these (sans walnuts, of course).  Very easy.  Very versatile.  Unrefined coconut sugar works very well instead of brown sugar.  You can also reduce the brown sugar to about 1/4 of a cup and they're still fine.  I can put anything I want in them, though raisins and chocolate chips are the reigning favorite.  I use light olive oil and add 1/4 cup flax seed and 1/4 cup oat bran, and they're even kind of healthy!  have to bake them in double batches every time I make them because everyone loves these, not just my son.  I must have given a dozen people this recipe already.  This household will never buy granola bars again.

Oh so good and oh so easy.  Tried the recipe as is for the first batch and it was so awesome.  My husband and I then started raiding our cabinets for different ingredients for another batch.  We are making our list for different variations we can use.  These won't last long.

Easy to prepare. I reduced the brown sugar, used wheat bran instead of germ and added nuts and a mixture of died fruit including my own dried blueberries. Also added peanut butter. This is a good basic recipe and can be added to easily. Thanks

Fantastic, but too sweet. Next time I'm going to make variations. Will replace egg with 3 egg whites, will decrease brown sugar by at least 1/4 cup maybe more. Hopefully it will be just as good. But as is, we love, love, love it. Forgot to add, used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and reduced the cinnamon by 1/4 teaspoon the first time we made it.

I tried  these-- they are easy to make... baked to 30 minutes ,then I cooled them well, but for me they were semi soft, ok I guess and very tasty..I changed the recipe,used cranraisins and from straight honey to a  blend of  honey and dark molasses, they are certainly sweet enough this way. Cutting is alittle tedious.

Easy, tasty and healthy.  What else could you ask for in a recipe?!  I am very happy with the way they turned out and I hope my 2 year old will like them!  
To spread the mixture in the pan, I put a sheet of waxed paper over the mixture and used my hands to smooth out the mix.

Good but not great. You have to push pretty hard in order for them to not fall apart. Taste more like a cookie as my 2 y.o. son calls them.

These are pretty good tasting but there are some issues with the recipe.  First, the foil or parchment lining of the 9x13 dish is not necessary at all if you spray the dish before baking.  Second, DO NOT USE HANDS TO PRESS INTO THE PAN OR TO MIX!  A greased spatula works perfectly and there is no mess left behind.  Third, I expected the bars to be crunchier, like the Oat N' Honey bars at the grocery store.  I even baked them 10 minutes longer than stated and they just don't have a lot of crunch.

We make these all the time and they are AWESOME! We have changed it up at times, adding chocolate chips or butterscotch chips in place of the raisins. We have also used 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 the oil and they still come out delicious. YUMMY!!!

This was delicious! Although I had to double the recipe to have the right amount of batter to fill the9x13 inch pan. I also used honey insteed of sugar so in total I used 1 cup of honey. I had previously used a different recipe for granola bars and they were so hard I could not even cut them, these are nice and soft.

Absolutely delicious.  I took note of other reviews and lessened the amount of sugar by half.  I also did half oil half applesauce.  The outcome was a fabulous granola bar that actually stayed together, looked great, and tasted heavenly!

I like my granola bars on the chewy side, and not like a crispy candy, and this came out just right.  It's really easy to modify and fool and with the flavors since the base bar is pretty adaptable.

Made this with what I had on hand - meusli instead of oats, crushed weetabix instead of wheatgerm, cashews instead of walnuts and omitted the cinnamon. This was excellent - nice and chewy rather than crunchy and not greasy at all. However, it was slightly on the sweet side for us - next time I'll cut back on the sweetness. I'm looking forward to playing with the combinations as hters have done. Looking forward to apricot and almond. Yum - perfect for late breakfasts on the run.

Used dried cranberries and a little less oil than the recipe called for.  Delish.  Family loves them.

Everyone that  has tried these has asked for the recipe. I cut the brown suger down to 1/2 cup and added 1/4 c milled flax seed to add omega 3 and fiber. They are very tasty and easy to make.

A maleable recipe that turns out great!  I have subsituted corn syrup for the honey until my little one was a year old, eliminated the nuts (for the kids) and used whole wheat flour and they turn out great every time. The alterations change the texture from the original recipe, but all are good!

This was a great recipe. Much better than the other ones on the site. I didn't have walnuts, so I used toasted pecans and they were great. I'll be making these again for sure.

I've had this recipe sitting around for YEARS and finally decided to pick up some wheat germ and try them.  OMG!!! What was I waiting for?  These are so delicious you could serve them as dessert bars.  It was the first 80 degree day in MN and the neighborhood kids were biking by and all got to try one.  They loved them even with walnuts and craisens.  I can't wait to make more different varieties.  Thanks for an excellent, super quick, easy, delicious recipe.  Made again and when I mixed up they seemed really dry.  I added a splash of milk and that seemed to work fine.  I thought they were a little sweet as well.  Next time may drop the brown sugar by 1/4 cup.

This is the 3rd granola bar recipe I have tried and it's a toss between this one and the Easy Granola Bars recipe. These tasted great when still slightly warm out of the oven, but a day later they are pretty crunchy. I added half the recommended sugar and also felt that there was too much "batter" (for lack of a better term) for the size of the pan the recipe calls for so I used a longer casserole dish, 9X20, and it almost filled the entire container.

Great recipe, huge hit, I make them regularly.  I always double the recipe and bake in 9x13 pan to make them extra thick.  I like to substitute pancake syrup for honey, I always have more of that on hand.

It was really good, quite tasty yet healthy. At first I thought they are a bit hard, but they become better next day. 
I used old-fashioned oats and substituted sunflower seeds for nuts. I was gonna use it as a 'post-workout' snack, so I didn't use the sugar, but added about a 1/2 cup of fructose and used only 1/2 cup of flour and 1/2 cup of vanilla protein powder (glad I did cause it actually added very nice strong vanilla ice-cream flavour to them:)) and omited vanilla extract at all. As I said, it was tasty, pleasantly chewy and sweet.

Very easy and flexible recipe, and very tasty! I used a mix of dried cranberries and raisins, added 3/4 cups of chocolate chips and a handful of sunflower seeds. Baked for a full 30 mins. Next time might try to bake at 20 to see if the bars are more chewy, but are still pretty chewy even at the 30 min mark.

These are delicious...bars. I would not call these granola bars. They are similar to a Quaker Breakfast Cookie, but better. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, but kept everything else. Also added 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips. Thanks!

Soccer tournament: coach says 'healthy' boys want tasty.  I took some guff for MAKING granola bars, but after our van full of boys and moms tasted these, I went from heel to hero.  I did switch raisins to mini chips, other than that I followed the recipe to the letter.  These are delicious and don't have the sticky-probably-chemical quality of store bought chewy granola bars.  I'll be making these for all my kids' sport teams.

Considering this was my first attempt at making granola bars, I was pleased with the results. However, I wasn't so pleased that I would never consider a different recipe. My main dislike had to do with the sweetness. With all that sugar and honey, these bars are very sweet. It's fine if you are looking for a cookie dessert type of thing, but maybe not so great for a healthy snack. If you can get past that, then make them. They are fast to whip up and make a good sweet treat.

These granola bars are delicious and easy to make. Instead of oats, raisins, and nuts I used a fruit & nut muesli. It worked really well and reduced the number of ingredients I had to buy, measure, and mix. It also added a variety of nuts, dried fruits, and even had coconut shavings and sunflower seeds in it. I reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup and they were still quite sweet. I plan to send these to work with my husband for quick and easy breakfasts or snacks.

These were VERY easy to make, and taste great! Much better than the store-bought bars. They are a *touch too sweet for my taste, so I may reduce the brown sugar to 1/2 cup next time. I left out the nuts (personal preference) and didn't have wheat germ, so I smashed up some Grape-Nuts cereal in its place. I cut them with a pizza cutter while they were still warm, made it very easy. Delicious!

This recipe has endless variations. I took the suggestions of several other of the reviewers and adjusted the honey, oil, etc. Overall it was okay. It is definitely worth a try. I always use my kids to guage the success of a recipe. They weren't too crazy about this one. I liked it though if that counts:-)

Taste pretty good, but crumbled almost completely when I tried to cut into bars ... I ended up making "granola bites" instead of bars ... so, next time, I will probably try a different recipe, as I am interested in finding and making a great granola *bar* ... but, still, they did taste okay.

These are great! I subbed whole wheat flour for the all-purpose and for the wheat germ. I also eliminated the nuts and added chocolate and butterscotch chips. I'd definately recommend trying that. I used slightly less oil. I also recommend cutting while warm; it is very difficult when they have cooled.

Good.  Chewy, but not too chewy, sweet, but not too sweet.  The raisens were good, but we love them w/ chocolate chips!  Next time I might try half a pan w/ dried cranberries.  My son loves these, and I feel WAY better about feeding him these than anything store bought and processed!

This recipe is a hit!!!  The guys at work absolutely LOVE them and always ask for a batch.  I only add 1/3 cup of brown sugar and have tried them with pecans and craisens.  

Another interesting addition:  protein powder.  Add 2 scoops of unsweetened, unflavored protein powder

This is a GREAT RECIPE.  No matter what I've done, it is excellent.  I usually add a lot more fiber, cut the sugar down...  I have never let it cool before cutting, I run a pizza cutter over it in the pan while hot.  Also I put waxed paper down in the pan....  Really good recipe, super easy.

My kids wouldn't even touch these. They had a strange flavor. I couldn't get them to hold together, either. I might try again with some modifications.

I added 1/2 cup peanut butter because I love it. These were more like an oatmeal cookie or the consistency of a Nutri-grain bar without the filling. I was expecting a chewy, sticky bar. I don't know if adding the peanut butter changed the chewy consistency of what they should have been like or not.

These bars are excellent. I make them regularly and have made some minor adjustments. I don't add the raisins but I add a full cup of nuts-usually
a mixture of almonds, sunflower seeds, peacans and walnuts- and sometimes I add chocolate chips.

A friend gave me this recipe! It was very good...I used ground flaxseed instead of wheat germ and almonds instead of walnuts. Will try again with walnuts. I thought they were very good. I am going to use craisins next time because they would be a little sweeter. I substituted applesauce for the oil too (never thought of using egg whites too...next time!) Thanks for a healthy alternative to boughten bars.

These are pretty good. They turn out kind of soft and chewy--not crispy. They are plenty sweet enough. I think you could make them healthier by decreasing the sugar and using whole wheat flour.

My husband loves this recipe! He requests them at least once a week. He takes them on his bike rides. He won't even eat the store-bought power bars anymore. I sometimes substitue the raisins for cut up apples, and I also add sunflower seeds and unsweetened shredded coconut! Excellent!

Superb! No need for me to buy Nature Valley anymore. These were so good and about 3 times cheaper than purchased bars. I love this recipe and will be using it for years to come. Thank you so much Ilene for sharing it.

I'm trying to do healthier holiday baking this year.  These granola bars achieved that goal.  I did make a few changes.  To make them gluten free, I used oat flour (just put oats in the blender until a fine powder) and flax seed meal instead of the wheat germ.  To make them fit a holiday theme, I used craisins and pepitas instead of raisins and walnuts.

I didn't have enough honey on hand, so I sub'd in half honey and half Agave Syrup and it worked well.  They turned out great, I would definitely make it again!  (I'm going to try next time with dried cherries instead of raisins just because my family enjoys them!)

I have made these more times than I can count!  I omit the wheat germ and add dried fruit, sunflower seeds and peanut butter chips in it's place.  They come out perfect every time!  Quick tip.... I use parchment paper on the pan for super easy removal!

This is a great recipe. I made it exactly as written, and it is delicious. I think in the future I will try reducing the amount of brown sugar, as it is very sweet as written. Texture and chewiness is great, though.

I have made this my regular granola bar recipe, keeping a constant stash in the freezer for quick snack or breakfast. 
The recipe is so versatile! I didn't have wheat germ so I used sunflower seeds instead. I have used maple syrup instead of honey for my baby who was too young for honey. I use whatever fillings I am in the mood of, including a nut-free version for my kids to take to school.
Thanks for a very useful recipe!

These bars are fantastic. As other reviewers mentioned, I used 1/4 cup oil + 1/4 cup applesauce and they turned out great. I didn't miss the extra oil at all. I used dried apricots and cranberries rather than the raisins since that's what I had on hand. I also used mixed nuts vs. the walnuts. Really, any combination of dried fruits and nuts would work well in this recipe. So much better than store-bought granola bars.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe !  I substitute flax seeds for the wheat germ.  I use coconut oil for the oil.   I always use 2 eggs. I make lots of variations.  I put it in cupcake liners, this makes a very easy "on the go" breakfast.

I reduced the brown sugar to 1/4 cup, and used raw almonds instead of the walnuts.  I also add about 1/4 cup of craisins, and  I used local honey and added about a quarter cup of flax seed and chia seeds instead of the wheat germ, because I didn't have any.  It turned out delicious!  I give this to my 3 year old grandson and he loves it!

Granola bars  III are such a quick and easy to make, out the door breakfast and snack.   I usually cut back on the brown sugar since I don't need any extra and I vary the fruit and nuts but it's definitely loved even by my grandkids

I substituted half the oil with applesauce and cut back a little on the brown sugar.  I also added a teaspoon or so of peanut butter.  Will definitely be making these again.

Simply amazing. So easy, not that this really matters! I make a batch on a Sunday to last the week for lunches/snacks and they're all gone by Tuesday. Even my picky 2yr old will devour them in minutes. I would love to avoid using the oil - but with applesauce they're just not as good.

I love this!  I have to eat dairy free and soy free and this is a great snack to have on the go.   I did not add wheat germ because I didn't have any around the house.  I added some cocoa powder as well.  This was extremely easy to make and bake.

Really easy and delicious. I added 1/4 cup peanut butter, 1/2 cup chocolate chips and it was fantastic. *to avoid over mixing, use the dough hook, not the beater. Added 1/2 cup each peanut butter chips and dehydrated bananas  (finely chopped ), and 1/2 cup each dried berries and chocolate chips   in another two batches. Great recipe.

These were great!  Super easy to make!  I did make a few tweaks though.  My family is not big on walnuts so I replaced the walnuts with sliced almonds and used almond extract instead of vanilla.  Turned out yummy!

These tasted like oatmeal cookies to me. They were very tasty, but not really the granola bar texture and crunch I was hoping for. Next time I would definitely reduce the sugar.

Great recipe!  I substituted 1 applesauce for 1/4 cup oil and used cran raisins.  I cut sugar in half and prefer that sweetness.

Really good texture.  I'm not a huger fruit fan, I used dried cherries instead of raisins. I think next time I'll try some chopped toffee and coconut, pecans would be good too!!

Made this today with a few changes.  I used ground flax, added 1/4 cup coconut and 1/4 cup of dried cranberries with the raisins.  I combined all dry ingredients in my stand mixer then added the liquid mixing on low until all was combined.  I also baked ten minutes longer and these granola bars got an all " thumbs up".  They turned out a soft crunchy texture and very delicious!!!!

The only thing is that they got kind of hard and would have liked them a little bit softer.

This recipe was OK. I used chopped pecans instead of chopped walnuts,and  I put in 1/4 cup of peanut butter and 1/4 cup of mashed banana instead of the oil. There was a really strong banana taste in the end, but I enjoyed them. I reduced the brown sugar just a tad, and used crushed Chex Mix instead of the wheat germ. It was oatmeal cookie like. You could definitely make these into oatmeal cookies.

This was very easy to make and very tasty! I made some modifications to the recipe.  I didn't have any wheat germ so i didn't use it.  Instead of vegetable oil, I used coconut oil to reduce fat. Since I'm allergic to walnuts, I added crushed natural almonds, unsalted pumpkin seeds and raisins.  I'm sure whatever nuts or seeds you use it will turn out delicious. Next time I will use less sugar.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband liked these very much. A nice sweet and nutty flavour. And super fast to make. I didn't have wheat germ so I substituted with toasted corn germ (I would have used ground flax seeds, but my blender broke). Nice recipe - will make again.

Amazingly delicious and easy to do. For a change substitute the raisins for dry mango (or other dry fruit) and pecans instead of walnuts.

Great Toddler Recipe. Most toddlers are picky, I think mine are exceptionally picky :) and they loved these. Not to mention you can add any type of dried fruit or nuts depending on they like and what is age appropriate. This recipe is full of good stuff... an extra egg like one reviewer stated not only makes them softer but adds extra protein along with the wheat germ which toddlers never seem to get enough of... :) Also an easy and fun recipe for your toddler to help dump ingredients and mix. My 3 year old is very proud of cooking her "bars".  They're a great recovery snack for my teenager after hockey, we add extra wheat germ in her batch. And last but not least they taste great! Thanks for the geat recipe! They're a hit around our house and the hockey rinks!

These bars are good, even right out of the oven:)I didn't give them 5 stars because I'd like them a little thicker so I can pack only 1 for my husband for bkfst.Also read reviews and played around for the first batch. I added 1/2C applesauce and 1/4C oil, also added 1/2C peanut butter, 1/2C flax seed, 1/2C wheat germ. 1/4C dark chocolate,Only 1/2/c brown sugar and 2 eggs...1/2C craisins. I also pressed a pan into them 20 mins into cooking and then again after they came out 7 minutes later. Let cooled for 10min and use a PIZZA CUTTER to cut them into bars(Worked Great) next time will make bigger batch and cook lower for longer so they're thicker. Plus throw in nuts or seeds (which I didn't have on hand) and maybe Kashi or organic brand of rice puffed cereal, probably 1C.....Hope the family gets a chance to try..I may eat them before they get home..ymmmmm

This recipe is amazing.  I tried other granola bars from this site this one is by far the best.  The flavor is outstanding!  I used craisins, walnuts and white chocolate chips.  Also subbed applesauce for half of the oil.  Very, very good.

Easy and delicious. The kids loved it! Here are a few changes I made.I didn't have honey, so I added 1/2 cup corn syrup instead. Also substituted orange flavoring instead of vanilla (YUM). And last but not least,instead of 1/2 c wheat germ, I sis 1/4/ c wheat germ and 1/4 c flax seed.

YUM!!!  I have tried these three times in the last week and based on other reviews I think the best combo is 1/2 all purpose flour, 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 oil, 1/2 apple sauce.  My second batch had Craisins and the zest of a medium orange (added to the wet ingredients) as well as a splash of OJ.  Those were AWESOME!
Thanks for the recipe!

I know I'm going to sound picky, but to me this recipe as written was just too bland. It has great possibilities to be creative, just wish I would have done so with my first batch instead of sticking to the recipe like I did. Next time I would definitely increase the cinnamon and raisins, or go with combinations suggested by other reviewers.

I made the recipe with only minor changes (didn't have wheat germ and I threw in some pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, and substituted dried cranberries for raisins). Even though I reduced the brown sugar a bit, I still found it too sweet for my tastes (which is often the case). Next time, I'll cut down to 1/4 cup and reduce the honey a bit too.

A good base recipe that I can now tweak.

Wow!  I used the basic recipe but left out the walnuts and instead added sunflower seeds and dried cranberries.  They didn't even last a week in the house.

Great! I subbed dried cranberries, coconut, and some finely chopped crystallized ginger, for the raisins & walnuts. The texture reminds me of a cliff bar, and it's not too sweet.

I love this recipe!  Only changes were substituting whole wheat flour, cutting brown sugar to 1/2 cup and using 1/2 cup crushed wheat chex in place of the wheat germ.  Great snack for lunchboxes too!  Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

Best bar recipe I've found on this site.
I used regular oats (vs quick oats) and they were fine.  Added coconut and choco chips to the mix and it turned out well.

Cook only 20 minutes.

Thank you :)

My bars turned out to be a little more than one-half inch thick.  I took others' suggestions and replaced AP flour with whole wheat, used 2 eggs, and replaced honey with maple syrup.  I don't know how much chewiness that extra egg really added.  Next time I'll follow the recipe exactly and see how different the taste might be.

We like these a lot.  They are soft and chewy.  I used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil.  Also used peanuts instead of walnuts and 1/4 cup of ground flaxseed instead of wheat germ.  Turned out very nicely baking for 20 minutes.

Wonderful Flavor!!! So easy and delicious, no more store bought for us. I did use a 11x7 pan to make it a little thicker. The variations are endless---next time I will try dried cherries!

Great!! Love love love this recipe.  I used 1/4 cup of brown sugar instead of 3/4 cup- it was plenty.  I also used raisins and just a few white chocolate chips.  Will make again and again.  Thank you!

We love this recipe! We will never purchase granola bars from a store again. I replaced the egg with Ener-G Egg Replacer, and it worked great. Ener-G is a great egg alternative in baking for vegans.

Very good!!!  I had no problem with these holding together and the texture is perfect.  I did reduce the brown sugar to 1/2 cup per one reviewer's suggestion and substituted pecans for the walnuts (I'm allergic to walnuts...).  Overall, a recipe I'll use again and again to avoid the high cost of prepackaged bars and the preservatives in them.  I do plan to experiment with chocolate chips, dried fruit, etc.

This granola bar recipe is good...but it is high in calories and fat. I have made other non-bake granola bars that I prefer over these. Still, these are pretty tasty.

They are good, just wish they were lower in calories.  I didn't add nuts and added less brown sugar and raisins.
They probably would be good with just chocolate chips.

Very easy and versatile. I did make some changes based on the other reviews. I used whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose, cut back on the sugar and added an egg. I also added chocolate chips. In the future when I am making them without chocolate chips I will use a little more sugar. I think they wouldn't be sweet enough if it weren't for the chocolate chips. I'm glad I came across this recipe and now I can make my son granola bars instead of buying the expensive store brands.

Holy Cow! These are wonderful! I have made this recipe 3 times now! My 17 month old and 4 year old love these! My husband doesn't like raisins so I just added some chocolate chips instead. Next time I will triple the recipe! This is my only granola bar recipe! Thank you so much!

I thought this recipe was awesome!!  The measurements were perfect for the ingredients.  I added sliced almonds and golden raisins instead of what the recipe called for because that's what I had in the pantry.  They turned out great!!  Watch out, they can be addictive!!  thanks for the great recipe.

Soft and chewy.  Very tasty.  I did not have raisins, so I used craisins, dates, and coconut.  I also added pecans, almonds, and cashews.

Very Good! This recipe can be made into several different varieties.  With my first batch, I used dried cherries, mini chocolate chips, and almonds. I was also impressed to find that it contains Wheat Germ, which is very high in Vitamin E and several other very good nutrients, not to mention it containing Oats - I wonder what would happen to the final product if I used some wheat flour?  I did forgot to substitute applesauce for the oil, like was mentioned in another post, but there will be other chances of getting that done, since I'll be making this recipe again.
Thanks.

Good, but definitely needs more sugar. 3/4 of the brown and maybe 1/3 turbinado sugar. Tasted like it had zero sweetness. I added chocolate chips. A little hard. Not nearly soft and chewy like the reviews. WIll try again, but w/ many changes.

This is a great recipe, I have made them so many times.  They are quick and very versatile, I always add white chocolate chips and cranberries, and my boyfriend likes chocolate chips and nuts.

Very Good!!!!  I did the applesauce, egg white, and soaked raisins as previous reviewers stated.  These were just great!  My husband eats a few with his coffee and is asking for more.  This is a definite keeper because to get him to eat anything healthy is a miracle!  Thank you

Kids Loved them!  They loved them even more when I substituted almond extract, chocolate chips and pecans.  They stay chewy.

I used half the amount of brown sugar and substituted 1 teaspoon of almond extract for the vanilla and they were very good.  Very filling, not too sweet, a great breakfast.

less chewy than some bars, more like Nature Valley's bars.  Very good though.
