great recipe. Had to alter a bit because I didn't have any Wacky Mac, so I substituted with penne and added 3 more cloves of garlic and more oregano. I used can tomatoes and extra lemon juice with a touch of my homemade cajun seasoning to give a little punch. Perfect and will enjoy again!

A delicious and fresh meal that can be made richer by adding more cheese.

SO easy and delicious!  Instead of fresh tomatoes, I drain and add a large tin of diced tomatoes. A little cayenne pepper adds a nice kick, and a little sliced avocado adds an excellent creamy texture.

Loved it, particularly after I increased the feta to 1 1/2 cups. I added a little cayenne, based on other reviews and overdid it a bit with the lemon. Next time, I'll use any tri-color spiral pasta rather than limiting to Wacky Mac. (It sure was colorful and interesting with the Wacky Mac.)
