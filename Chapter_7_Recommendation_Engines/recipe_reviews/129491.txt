Tried this as a wheat-free stuffing.  I just ate my second serving.  It has great flavor.  Though it isn't like normal stuffing it is a great side that is light and nutritious.  I made two changes- craisins instead of raisins and I added some butter b/c it is stuffing.  I am excited to try the batch that comes out of the bird.  One batch makes enough to fit in a smaller bird plus a 9 by 9 pan.

This recipe is delicious.  Like another reviewer, I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth. I combined all the ingredients, cooked it in the crock pot and served it as a side dish with some chicken.  I would definitely make this again.

As I wasn't roasting a turkey, I cooked the quinoa in chicken stock, then added the other ingredients (omitted the salt because of all the salt in the stock) and just microwaved it for an extra 5 minutes or so.  Tastes great! Can't believe how healthy it is, and would happily serve this to guests.

This was pretty good, but it had a flavor that I don't like, I think it was the apple; I used one small granny smith apple because I wasn't sure if I would like it, and I'm glad I didn't use more.

I cooked this entirely in the stove top.  First, I sauteed all of the veggies briefly (I also added a small stalk of celery).  I think I chopped the mushrooms too big, next time I would chop finely.  I used pumpkin seeds instead of pine nuts, and I did half raisin/half dried cranberry.  I used veggie broth instead of water.

With some modifications, I would serve this at Thanksgiving alongside a Tofurkey. :)

The recipe was large enough to stuff the Thanksgiving turkey and bake as a birdless casserole dish. I'm a big fan of quinoa and this recipe didn't disappoint. For the cordless variety, I would add turkey drippings to the casserole when I went in to baste the turkey.

Absolutely delicious!  I like a lot of flavor in my food so I will add more poultry seasoning and possibly some craisins, too.
