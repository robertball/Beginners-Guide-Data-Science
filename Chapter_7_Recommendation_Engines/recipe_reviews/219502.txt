Given that Hubs and I have been enjoying rice side dishes with a lot of vegetables in them lately, it was no surprise we enjoyed this one too.  I added some sautéed red bell pepper, onions, mushrooms and garlic.  I did not cook the spinach with the rice, preferring instead to simply barely wilt the spinach in the pan with the other vegetables and stir it all in at the end.   Rather than commercial "Italian seasoning" I chose to add some fresh thyme and parsley.

This recipe was very easy and delicious. I forgot to put the spinach in until the end, but the rice was hot enough to wilt the spinach and it came out great. We will definitely make this again.

This was very good!  I used bullion cûbes in place of the broth and chopped broccoli instead of spinach.  It was quite tasty.

We JUST finished eating this dish with another Allrecipe, Broiled Tilapia Parmesan.  We really enjoyed this rice!  The only adjustment I made was to leave out the Italian seasoning and used two full TBSP minced fresh garlic.  We will definitely make this again.

I was skeptical to try this but was running out of ways to serve rice and spinach sounded interesting. It is incredible. I didn't know spinach could pair with rice so well. It has a rich flavor, so don't expect a mild rice. Of course you or your family/guests should love spinach or it "may" disappoint. I personally cut the stems from the spinach and then chopped the pile of leaves horizontal, then vertical on my cutting board to end up with about 1" squares. When these stirred in and shriveled to the heat, they integrated with the rice smoothly without any stringy bites. I ended up making it again the same week, then a third time a couple weeks later! I followed the recipe exactly, even doing it on the stovetop to start getting away from depending on my rice cooker. If this is followed step by step, it does come out right so anyone can impress their friends with a fluffy, flavorful rice. Any spinach lovers on the fence about trying a "spinach rice" should take the plunge on this one.

Exceptional!  Aside from adding some diced tomatoes this recipe needed no editing.  This is an awesome bed for garlic baked chicken.

This rice was very easy to make and very flavorful.  Instead of spinach I diced 1/2 cup tomato and 1/2 cup brocolli, and added a bit of garlic powder.  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks

This turned out good. My kids (6 & 3) both really enjoyed it. I left out the spinach and used arborio rice in place of the long-grain. My only negative comment was that it turned out dry, but that can easily be fixed and may have been a result of the type of rice I used.

Beautiful rice.  Excellent side dish.  Added sautéed minced garlic cloves along with the spinach, fifteen minutes into the simmering. So delicious.

I waited to add the chopped spinach until the last 2 minutes, and that was plenty of time for it to soften. 
I realized with my first bite that I'd forgotten to toss in the cheese, but this recipe is so flavorful that it doesn't need the cheese.  If I made this for a holiday meal, I'd probably be sure to include the cheese. 
I think chopped mushrooms might be a nice addition, also.

Just made this and it was delish! Next time I think I'll use a bit less of the Italian seasoning, but my hubby & all 3 kids (including 2 picky tots) loved it!

This is really good.  I subbed 1 can of diced tomatoes and added water to make 2 cups of fluid (I used no chicken broth) then added some salt, the Italian herb blend, and 2 cloves of garlic. I chopped the spinach and added it to the tomato mixture with a splash of olive oil. I cooked 1 cup of whole grain rice  in the above mixture.  Added the Parmesan upon taking it off the stove.

I really liked this.  I was looking for a different rice dish and a way to use up some extra spinach that didn't make it into a salad.  I think I would add a little less parmesan next time.  It got a little gummy as it cooled down.  But VERY tasty.  I will definitely make this again.

We had this tonight and it was ok, nothing special.  The only change I made was to use brown rice instead of white.  The spinach didn't really pare with the rice for some reason for us.  We had it with spinach chicken parmesan (a light recipe on AR). Thanks for sharing, but we won't have this again.

A nice basic veggie and rice recipe that provides the basic needed info but leaves lots of room to be creative. I sauteed chopped asparagus, red bell pepper, one clove garlic and one half of a yellow onion, then added broth/herb mixture and rice. I doubled the recipe and simmered for 23 minutes. It was great! Tonight it was a side dish to ribs. Tomorrow I will add chicken and it will be a great main dish. A little crusty bread rounded out the meal. Definitely will make this again.

very yummy.. i increased the rice to one cup and used 2 cups prepared chicken bouillon for the broth.. added just a little more italian seasoning to accomodate.. used 1/4 cup of frozen spinach for the fresh but feel like i could have added more.. used half shredded and half grated parm.. b/c i couldn't make up my mind which would be better.. ty for the recipe.. ~~UPDATE: again, this was SO delicious.. i was happy to have fresh spinach this time.. i sauteed a minced garlic clove in about a tsp of olive oil and then i added a cup of basmati rice (my fave) to the pot.. sauteed until the rice puffed up and proceeded with the recipe.. i added fresh parsley, 1/4 cup of bottled lemon, and S&P to the finished product.. i used Kraft three cheese blend (parm, romano & asiago) for the grated parm.. ty again for the recipe
