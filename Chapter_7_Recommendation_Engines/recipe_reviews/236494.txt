Delicious! I made this exactly as written and only had to add additional salt before serving.  I found the steps to be a little out of order. I recommend adding in the carrot and zucchini at the tail end of step 3. No need to cook the beef for 90 mins until tender, then have to add in the veggies for additional cooking time. Also, I recommend cooking the pasta when the soup is almost fully cooked. If you cook it too early, it'll sit there and clump up. Another option would be to just toss the uncooked pasta into the soup in the last few mins of cooking.  I'm looking forward to having this for lunch again tomorrow! Yum!

We really enjoyed this, including picky husband!  I used a regular white onion and mini spaghetti instead and it turned out great.  I followed the suggestions from another reviewer...I simmered soup for 60 minutes then put the vegetables in the last 15 minutes.  Cooked the pasta right before I put it in the soup.  Will have again!

Not even remotely close to how the Peruvians make it.  Definitely not authentic. & much fattier.

I thought it was lacking in flavors or the depth of flavors
