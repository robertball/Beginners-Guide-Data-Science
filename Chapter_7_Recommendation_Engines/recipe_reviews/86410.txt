As written, pretty bland.  With some fixing-up, however, it was delicious!  I tripled the garlic, added 2 tsp. minced fresh ginger, 1 tsp. beef bouillon (to the sauce), extra 1/4 tsp. red pepper, and another tablespoon or so of soy sauce.  Also used round steak, which was much more tender and less fatty than sirloin.

I find I rely on stir fries like this a lot when I’m headed out of town (again) and I need something quick, nutritious, delicious and puts to good use the produce in the fridge I don’t want to go to waste.  (In this case the broccoli and mushrooms I used made their way from Florida to Wisconsin before it all finally ended up on our plates) This “Hot and Tangy Broccoli Beef” was just what I was after.   We can do the “tangy,” however, because of Hubs sensitive innards we can’t do the “hot,” so I had to leave out the red pepper flakes.   It didn’t make a difference – this was plenty good without it.  Mushrooms filled in for the onion because, again, I’m leaving town again in the morning and wanted to use them up.  But they couldn’t have been a better choice had they been written into the recipe.  Other than that substitution I followed the recipe fairly closely, only substituting peanut oil for the vegetable oil.   We try to monitor our carbs (especially after a couple weeks worth of pasta in Italy!) so I served this over “Miracle Rice,” described as “Shirataki rice, guilt free rice, zero calories, soy free, gluten free, made in the USA.”  It is expensive, smells foul, looks unnatural and tastes like nothing.  I’d highly recommend substituting a little bit of rice or nothing at all...

Good dish, though not the taste I was looking for.  Not as sweet as the usual order out I get, but still very very good, and something I'll remake. I used less broccoli and still had tons leftover, so modifyig the amount of broccoli used is a per person thing.

My Beef and Broccoli fanatic husband loved this! I only changed one thing, I added a little ginger with the garlic.  The only difference to me was that the broccoli tasted much fresher and was crunchier then from the restaurant, nothing wrong with that!  Love this, can't wait to make it again!

I loved this!  I didn't use any vinegar, mostly becasue I don't like it, and also, I just forgot:)  It turned out really tasty.  I would add more garlic and red pepper flakes next time.  I actually liked how it wasn't super sweet.  It's a keeper!

I've made this recipe several times.  It's a great recipe to play with.  I sometimes add carrots or snowpeas, or whatever is on hand.  I like things spicy, so I up the red pepper to 1 teaspoon, put  in lots of garlic and add chopped fresh ginger.  Delicious!

My husband and I tried this recipe and while it's good, it needs.......something.  Fresh ginger?  Orange peel?  More garlic?  More red pepper?  We don't know.  It's a keeper because it makes a reasonably good, quick meal, but not something I'd do up for company.  Thanks to the author for publishing it, though :)

while this recipe was good as is, it was hardly "hot and sour". I agree with the other reviewers that this was a little bland... It could have definitely used a little more red pepper. Next time I will also try adding a little bit more vinegar in the end to give it some "zing". and I will probably add a little bit more soy sauce.

This was great! I added a bit more red pepper and sugar and forgot the vinegar, but I think the vinegar would have made it better. Everyone at work wanted the recipe just from smelling the left overs!

Made this for lunch today, the hubby thought it was really good.  I on the other hand agreee with others, it was a bit bland, I really don't know what it was missing.  After tasting I added garlic powder and seasoned salt, but still was not enough seasoning

Made exactly as written except used beef broth instead of water for sauce. Next time will double the sauce as hubby said he'd like it a bit juicier. Otherwise this was really good and we thoroughly enjoyed this served over steamed fried noodles last night.  Thanks for posting!

I looked at several recipes before choosing this one - primarily because I had all the ingredients on hand.  It was a very good choice, and has been added to my recipe box.

Made it, and loved it. Marinated the beef for probably 4 hours and added more garlic and a good shot of fresh ginger. Will not order out again!

This was really good.  A lot of people complained that it was bland so I took the advice of other reviewers and added some fresh ginger to the meat marinade in addition to a little more garlic.  I had some low sodium beef broth that needed using so I used that in place of the water in the sauce.  I also added extra pepper flakes because we like things spicy.  In addition to the onion and broccoli, I added some carrots and mushrooms too.  Served it over jasmine rice.  Delish!

great recipe but be careful using the serving calculator.If you calculate for 8 servings it asks for 19 CUPS of vinegar!

Really "downsized" this recipe so it's more for me than anyone who wants a valid review ... I had some broccoli slaw to use ... Sauteed it (about 3c) in oil, added a couple miniportabellos.  Combined 1T soy & 2t cornstarch.  Added it to half cup less 2T water & 1/2t crushed red pepper.  Added that to the almost done veggies.  Didn't thicken a whole lot (blame the mushrrooms), but still pretty good.  I meant to add the sugar, but forgot.  Oops.  :)  It was so diluted, it really wasn't too soy/salty like that.  Also, surprisingly, not too spicy either.

This was really excellent as written. I've  made some other beef and broccoli recipes on this site but I like this one the best. Next time I may add some more vinegar; perhaps some mushrooms, carrots and baby corn. I don't think it's bland, but some may prefer more heat. I like it as is.

Big hit.  My husband grilled a small shoulder roast and sliced it thin. I used a bag of frozen broccoli and all I had to do was put it together with the rest of the ingredients. Heated and  served  over brown rice.  We're looking forward to the leftovers.

I had leftover pork chops to use up so followed the recipe except cut up and added the pork and peas. Since it was just for two of us, I made a little less. Turned out very well.

I like that this dish isn't as super sweet as the typical American Chinese dish, but I would recommend subbing stock for water. My family preferred to forego the pepper flakes.

Was a bit disappointed.  It had an odd after taste, which I think was the vinegar.  I may try it again with out the vinegar.

I had a big bag of brocoli I had to use. I saw this recipe and it turned out pretty good.  It had good flavor and I would make it again.  I would put in another tablespoon of soy sauce and did add sesame seed oil ot the meat and in the fry oil.

Pretty bland, even with a ton more fresh ginger and fresh garlic.  Next time I'll add a several tablespoons of each.  Plus a teaspoon of hot chili paste.  I also added Chinese cabbage and carrots for color and texture.  When I ate it, I pour on more soy sauce and it was decent.  Smelled great cooking & is a good base recipe to adjust to your taste.  Thanks for sharing.

This turned out to be a great dish, though I did use some lean pork instead of beef.  I also swapped out the sliced onion for some thinly sliced red pepper strips.  I served this with Sesame Noodles also from this site and it turned out to be a super yummy meal!  A really good mix of spice and tang...not too much of either :)

The only thing I changed was omitting the onions.
Also, I was a bit worried that the red pepper flakes might make it a bit too warm for the little kids but they didn't seem to think it was hot because they gobbled it right up.  My friend was over and she asked me to email the recipe to her so she could make it for her husband and he loved it too!  Thank you!

Excellent - even for a beginner!!  I messed up on the sugar and soy sauce portions when I tripled the receipe (added a little more than necessary)...but it didn't matter, it tasted delicious.  I was a little worried for the smell of the oyster sauce but it tasted great.  Definately a family favorite!

not bad. Although I reed the other reviews so I doubled the garlic and red pepper. A little bland still, but good. I will make again.

Made as written, this was extremely boring and lacking flavor. Like others, I added more red pepper and garlic, and some ground ginger too. It still wasn't that great. I won't be making this again. Thanks anyway.

We enjoyed this dish for dinner.  I added the extra garlic and liked it, although didn't find it spicy at all.  Doubling the pepper flakes to 1/4 tsp. might do the trick.  We will make this again.

Very good basic recipe. I also spiced it up quite a bit. I tripled (well, more really) the crushed red pepper, nudged the soy sauce up a bit, and added a tbsp of jarred minced ginger. To the vegetables I added snow peas, carrots, mushrooms, baby corn, and water chestnuts. Yum!

This was really good but I made a few changes. I used 3 to 4 garlic cloves,  2 to 3 tsp. Chopped fresh ginger, chicken broth instead of water, and cauliflower instead of broccoli. This was only because I had cauliflower to use up. Broccoli would be fine too. I also doubled the pepper flakes but only cause we like it hot. Great sauce, tasty with good consistency.

This is a decent gluten free broccoli beef recipe (if you use gluten free soy sauce).  The flavour was light but i liked the consistency of the sauce and the simple ingredients. 

I plan to add chilli garlic sauce, ginger and a bit more red pepper flakes next time to kick it up a little.

Not bad.  I did without the cornstarch because I didn’t have any.  Also, doubled up in the garlic and went with a Carolina Reaper instead of crushed red pepper for a more fiery dish.

I doubled up on the garlic and added ginger and beef bouillon.  I didn’t have enough broccoli, so I added bell pepper, carrot and mushroom, it was pretty tasty.  I didn’t give it 5 stars because of needing to add more garlic and ginger.

Tasted great!  Not as spicy as I'd hoped but perhaps if my pepper flakes were more recent than 2 years ago, might help.  I tripled garlic and used orange balsamic vinegar in place of rice vinegar.  Consider adding toasted sesame seeds and or peanuts.  Served with brown rice.  I doubled it and looking forward to left overs tomorrow.

I thought this recipe would be great but NO. As others said, it was bland so i followed the suggestions of others and added more garlic and ginger. Nope, still bland. After going over the reviews again I see a pattern. Lots of reviewers commented on this fact and many added or changed the recipe to their personal taste.  With that many changes noted, it is clear that the recipe as written is lacking and I'm sorry to say does not deserve more than 1 or 2 stars.

I used Sirloin for this recipe which was an excellent choice. I swapped out rice vinegar for apple cider vinegar that I had on hand and also doubled the garlic and red pepper flake recommendation per another user.  I served with white sticky rice. 

Overall, we really like this dish, it's like a fresher more healthy version of chinese food. I subtracted 1 star, as we felt the flavor was missing something, but couldn't put our finger on it.  Some flavor profile you typically find in takeout, I joked with my husband, it was MSG. Anyways, will make again.

This was so easy and delicious. I used Braggs liquid aminos, much healthier than soy and tastes the same. Added a little extra red pepper flakes and didn't have sushi vinegar so used white wine vinegar.

Tasted great! Added a little more garlic like other reviewers mentioned. I also added sliced orange, red, and yellow pepper slices! Colorful dish!

Simple, tasty dish; easy to follow recipe. Accompanied with a beansprout and vegetable stir-fry and noodles, this made a very enjoyable supper.

Wasn't a fan of this recipe, followed suggested comments of adding more garlic and soy to add flavour, but it just got too salty instead. will not try it again.

I loved this! The sauce was seriously awesome. Will use on lots of other things. I used thick bacon instead of beef (cause bacon), and added extra garlic as some reviews said it could be a little bland. Girlfriend and I give it a big thumbs up!

I pretty much followed the recipe as written and was pleased with the results.  My wife gave it a thumbs up.  I might have added a little more garlic and crushed red peppers cause I like a little more heat.  A nice use for a lower quality cut of steak.

I followed a lot of the suggestions.  I added BTB beef base to  the water. I used leftover roast for the meat. Instead of marinating I added the meat at the very end to heat thru and added the marinating ingredients(a lot more garlic) to the sauce and upped red pepper flakes to 1 T. I used 2 T reduced sodium Tamari and 1 T dark soy. Only had a little rice vinegar left so I filled in with cider vinegar. Added red peppers and carrots.

Fabulous flavor. Meat so tender and delicious. Just added various veggies I had along with broccoli. And ginger really is a must. Doubled water & cornstarch mixture amounts for enough sauce for rice. Used the single recipe amount of vinegar though and I thought that was just right. Everyone like it.

This recipe is simple enough. I used left over roast beef from a Christmas party and frozen broccoli. I doubled the crushed red pepper and omitted the vinegar (because I dont like it). I understood what other reviewers were talking about when they said that "something is missing" I added beef boullion, but still missing something. The answer to this problem-- Ramen Noodles Beef flavor packet! It made this recipe perfect! I will definitely be making this again. Thanks for the recipe.

Just had this for supper and OMG! No need to go out for Chinese again. 
I did add slivered baby carrots for color and also a bit more red pepper flakes, as we like spice. I had to cook my steak strips for an extra two minutes as it looked too raw.  I used Bragg's natural liquid soy seasoning for a healthier salt content.
This was great in the given proportions but does not make extra sauce. If you like to spoon sauce on rice, then double the wet ingredients.
We really enjoyed this and will make it often. I think chicken would be good too.

Yum.  Added some fresh ginger because I so love ginger.  I also added more soy sauce because that's what we like.  Used olive oil instead of vegetable.  We used thinly sliced top sirloin.  I skipped the first cornstarch step.  I just browned the beef strips in the oil and used my own cooking method with the rest of the ingredients.  I will make this again.  I love the crushed red pepper & vinegar addition, it adds a nice zing. Update:  I made it with chicken breast and it was so delicious!  Used sesame oil & topped with toasted sesame seeds as well.  Trippled the sauce and also threw in some green onions (scallions) at the end.  I also went a little heavy on the vinegar cause it is such a great addition to this recipe.  Don't forget the vinegar it is very important to this dish!

Not tooo spicy, but way too much sauce. I will probably halve the amount in the future. Good flavor. Be careful not to overcook the broccoli while thickening the sauce.

I also added more garlic, ginger and red pepper flakes. I used rice vinegar; since it is milder I might add a tsp or two more next time.   Served it with rice made Asian style--no salt, so next time instead of water I will use a cup of beef broth to give it a flavor boost.

I really liked this recipe, but I accidently used low-sodium soy sauce which I think may have made it not so yummy. Next time I'll use the regular one.

Hmm.  I don't know if it was the cut of meat I used or what, but this wasn't very flavorful.  Maybe I was just expecting something different.  It wasn't very hot, to me, and I doubled the red pepper and quadrupled the garlic.  The broccoli tastes fine, it's just the meat that isn't super. Next time, I'll use flank or skirt steak and I'll see if it turns out tasting better.

We added ½ tsp. garlic chili sauce & 1 tsp. fresh ginger & allowed the beef to marinate for most of the afternoon.  As other reviews have suggested, add any type of vegetable you like – the recipe only gets better.  We also added a little extra ginger & garlic chili sauce to the vegetables.  Several have said adding vinegar doesn’t seem to help but I disagree.  We used rice wine vinegar which is a terrific addition.  Served with steamed rice.  Very good!

This recipe results in a deep, rich, flavorful sauce.  Just the right amount of heat and sourness.  Hubby raves every time I fix it!

Hubby and I love this recipe! I don't find that the stated amount of vinegar adds a lot, though, I double it to get that little extra zing. It's great for when I come home after work and don't feel like spending any major time in the kitchen.

We loved it!  I did make a few changes after reading the other reviews.  I added 2 cloves of garlic, used 3/4 of a table spoon red pepper, chili oil instead of vegtable oil, used red, yellow & orange peppers instead of broc. and put over rice.  The original recipe creates enough sauce which is nice with the rice.  This definitely had flavored...

Mine was edible, but didn't have very much flavor.  I tried adding some carrots for the color, but it needed something else.
