I and everyone around me loves this pie-young and old alike. I used Oreo crust instead and the ingredients can be increased or decreased according to your preferences. This pie is a sure winner. Note: Be sure to add only as much condensed milk as the recipe calls for!

Very good and easy to make. I might try a non-chocolate pie crust next time.

Delicious and really easy to make, though I didn't really get it to set properly. I garnished it with strawberries and everyone loved it.
