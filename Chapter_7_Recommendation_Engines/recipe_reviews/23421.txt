You'll want to serve ice cream with this dessert to tone down its richness. I wouldn't eat this dish without 'Breyers Natural Vanilla' ice cream because it's very sweet and rich but in a good way. Unless you have quite a few people to feed, you shouldn't need to double the recipe either.

I've never seen anyone use melted butter to make crisp but I would recommend using hard butter from the fridge and mashing it with a fork into the dry ingredients. It should be a crumbly texture sprinkled onto the cherries. If the topping gets creamy and has the consistency of cake batter, it will stay that way when cooked and you won't get the desired 'crispy' consistency of the topping.

This is by far the quickest and easiest homemade style crisp I have ever made.  Yes, it kind of tastes like a "store bought" one, but hey - it takes 15 minutes to prep and you are using canned cherries (or other filling).  Per other suggestion, I doubled the crisp part of the recipe.  When I was making it, I thought double crisp looked wierd, but when we tasted it - awesome!  However, the can of cherry filling I had in the cupboard didn't have enough for what I like.  So, I ended up adding about a layer of mixed frozen berries on top of the cherry filling and patting them down into the filling goo.  Adding the frozen berries was a good idea; it cut down on the "canned" feeling of the crisp.  Omitted nutmeg, used real butter, sub'd walnuts for pecans.

Very tasty and EASY dessert.  My boyfriend and son absolutely loved it.  Next time, I will cut nutmeg down to 1/4 tsp...was a little too "nutmeggy", but very good, nonetheless.

This would be good with blueberries/apples/peaches too, I would bet.

This was really yummy! I made some changes though. 1st, I mixed 1/2 cup of light cream cheese, 1 tsp almond extract, and 1 tsp vanilla extract in to the cherry pie filling. And, I changed the pecans to almonds, and it was REALLY good! Fresh whipped cream went with it perfectly.

This was very easy.  I used splenda instead of sugar and sugar-free canned cherry pie filling for a low-cal dessert.

I couldn't bring myself to use canned cherries, so I subbed fresh blueberries (6 cups fresh blueberries, 2/3 cup orange juice, 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons sugar - pour in pan and mix) and doubled the recipe for a 9x13 inch baking pan. I also reduced both the cinnamon and sugar. This got several requests for the recipe when I took it in to work.

This was very good, though I thought the nutmeg flavor was a tad too strong....I'd use maybe 1/2 or 1/3 a tsp. nest time.  I made extra granola/flour/sugar mixture and pressed about half of it onto the bottom of the greased pan and then poured on the cherries and finished with the rest of the mixture and the pecans.  I took another reviewer's advice and ate it with some vanilla ice cream--I definitely second that recommendation!!

The first time I made this I went by the recipe.  This time I changed it up a bit.  I made my own cherry pie filling then just dumped all the crumble ingredients in my food processor, not melting the butter.  I used 1 cup of flour, 1 cup of oats, 3/4 cup of brown sugar, 3/4 cup of butter and a pinch of salt.  I added almonds to my cherry pie so didn't put any nuts in the crumble.  I also omitted the cinnamon and nutmeg because I really didn't care for the way they 'marry' with the cherries.

This is absolutely the BEST cherry crisp I have ever made! My family loved it, I made it following the exact recipe as posted, it is so easy to make and the topping is wonderful and moist, not dry like most crumb toppings, thanks Holly for an awesome dessert!

This recipe was not only very quick and easy to make, but it was delicious.  I made two pans for my son to take back to WSU with him today.  Cherry Crisp is one of his favorites and he loved this recipe.  Thank you to Holly for sharing it with us.

what i loved about this recipe was the ease to make with my 2 and 4 year old grandsons.  one is highly allergic to dairy and eggs, the other is too young for nuts ... so this recipe was a great activity to make with them (with the omission of the nuts).

i have never written a review for anything online before, but i really wanted to share the info on the ease of preparation and the non-allergic nature of this recipe. 

thank you.

I am eating this as I am writing a review.  This absolutely delicious.  My family has been waiting for it to come out of the oven and cool down.  The only complaint so far is too much ginger.  You might want to cut back a little on it.  Other than that...awesome!

The first time I made this recipe, it was not very good, but I altered a few things and made it for a party and not only was it gobbled up in ten minutes, but everyone raved about it all night! The alterations for the top included doubling the crisp part, using 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour, 1/2 cup regular all purpose flour. I chopped up the pecans and mixed them into the mixture instead of just sprinkling them on top. Added room temp. butter to mixture (this makes the crisp part actually crispy) instead of melting butter. Added a little sea salt and put more cinnamon, less nutmeg. For the cherries, I added orange zest (1 orange), which gave it a very fresh and flavorful kick. I also used a higher quality cherry pie filling with no high frucrose corn syrup. Would definitely make this again with all the alterations, easy and yummy recipe!

Very easy and very tasty. I normally don't alter a recipe until I've made it once first, but I liked the idea that another user suggested; I doubled the "crisp" part of the recipe and put it in the bottom of the dish, then cherries, then more "crisp". This toned the richness of the cherries down a bit and as a bonus it actually made it easier to serve as it kind of helped hold it all together. I only had almonds on hand, so I used those and they worked well with this dessert.

This was a really good, easy recipe.  I think next time I will decrease the amount of nutmeg or leave it out altogether- it was a bit too much for my liking - although it smelled wonderful!  I used cold butter (sliced) and "mashed" it into the dry ingredients rather than melt it - a way that I have always made a crisp topping.
***The second time I used 1 tsp cinnamon and left out the nutmeg and I liked it better.  I think the nutmeg was a bit too much in the original recipe***

This recipe is a very good basic recipe for Cherry crisp. To make it FIVE STARS for me I used two cans of cherries in a 9 x 13 baking dish, doubled the topping and added shredded coconut for more flavor.

Four stars for ease of preparation but far too sweet for us. The only change I made was butter in place of margarine. Serving it with vanilla ice cream does help tone down the sweetness. Probably won't make it again but may use the topping for an apple crisp. Thanks Holly.

I didn't have much margarine so I only used about 1tbs and used applesauce for the rest. Also, I thought I had a can of cherry pie filling but it was actually raspberry. And I substituted chopped almonds for the pecans. Overall it was quite easy and good. I did find the pie filling to be too sweet so next time I would cut down the sugar in the flour mixture to no more than 1/2 cup. And it was fine with the applesauce substitution for anyone who wants to cut down on the fat. It was pretty yummy.
Thanks for posting your recipe

Great simple recipe and even better with a few small tweaks. Use real butter, make a double batch of topping and make a super thin bottom crust, squeeze/strain and add the juice of 1 whole lemon to the filling and you have a quickie store made desert that tastes homemade! I made this once and gave a few pieces out to friends and since then they've been begging for the recipe or for me to make them a batch.

This was excellent.  I read through the reviews and added 1/2 tsp. Almond extract and doubled the topping.  I also didn't melt the butter.  We like a lot of topping but believe the original amount would have been fine.  A true hit with the family!

I read several of the reviews before I tried this.  I cut the nutmeg to 1 tsp., and it still seemed a bit "too" spicy.  I'd use 1/2 that next time.  I also used the "cold" butter, as suggested by one reviewer.  It was good... very sweet, but we liked it a lot.  I may try a little less brown sugar and a smidge more oats next time.  Additionally, it's best to let it sit a cool a bit.  This helps in "jelling" the dish rather than serving it right out of the oven.  Quick, easy, and yummy.  I'll make it again with a few "tweaks".

It was yummy!  If you are like me and you love the crisp, I would make 1 1/2 times the crisp.  It turned out great and tasted wonderful, but I will add more crisp next time to cover it better.

I was really disappointed with this recipe. The amount of nutmeg was very disproportionate for my families tastes.

Made this for a potluck type cookout and everyone seemed to love it.  Before it was dessert time it was half gone...nothing was left at the end.  I liked it but thought it was a bit too sweet and yes, for the amount I used (oh and I used fresh strawberries and fresh cherries) I definitely think the crisp part needs to be doubled.  Otherwise great!

I followed another reviewer's tips of adding a little vanilla and almond extracts and cream cheese to the cherries, as well as subbing almonds for the pecans. Super easy and yummy!!

Excellent recipe & super easy.  Not a big nutmeg fan, so I halved that and used butter not margarine (that's all I had).  Also used a 30 oz can of cherry pie filling and omitted some of the gelatinous stuff so cherries covered the bottom of the dish but it wasn't too soupy.  Just tried it by itself but I bet it would be awesome over vanilla ice cream.

Excellent!  I made this once with cherries, and now I'm trying it with apples.  I really love the crispy crust, and I think I'll make it with the crust on the top and bottom.  Great with vanilla ice cream.  Thanks!!!

My husband and I love this recipe and I didn't change a thing.  Perfect the way it is.  We even like it better than cherry pie, and easier to make.

OMG>>  We all loved this so so much.  I did add a bit more butter and brown sugar to the crunch.  It was a huge hit with EVERYONE!! Try a melted butter and brown sugar sauce drizzled over the top when cooled.  it is so decadent! I will be mking this for the holidays for years to come...

I prefer crisps to pies any day and this is simple, delicious and quick to prepare. It is rich and a scoop of ice cream is a nice way to top it off. I haven't tried it yet, but I am betting that chopped almonds would be an exquisite way to replace the pecans in the topping. There is a lot of nutmeg in this, but I really like nutmeg so I wouldn't adjust a thing.

Admittedly, my hudband and I devoured this in one day. It was SOOOO good! The pecans add a really nice touch that I would have never thought of. Really, I was just looking for a way to use cherry pie filling before it expired and this is an absolutely amazing way to use it!

Excellent. I didn't have the nuts so I had to leave them out but the topping was great. I also divided up the cherries in ramekins for single servings. We also enjoyed this with Lemon Sorbet.

I'm reviewing the topping on this recipe. I didn't have canned cherries so I used fresh (came out too juicy - but not the recipe's fault). The topping is excellent!  I acually needed to double it (I like a LOT of topping) and it "crisped" up just fine, even with the melted butter. It wasn't soggy a bit.  I will be using this topping recipe on all my fruit cobblers now! (a peach one is being made as we speak!)

I used softened butter to get the crispy crumb texture I prefer. I would not use melted butter/margarine for this recipe. I also added some almond extract to the cherries and some vanilla to the topping. YUM.

The consistency as stated was mushy and did not turn out well. Not "crumby" at all. The flavor of what did turn out was OK but nothing to write home about. I only wish I had not tried this for the 1st time as a dish we shared with friends.

Very good and easy! I did make a few changes. I made my own filling instead of using canned - I used one can of red tart cherries and one can of dark sweet cherries, and then doubled the recipe on the side of the cans. For the topping I changed the nutmeg to 1/4 teaspoon, and instead of nuts I added more oats, flour and brown sugar (we are not nut fans in my family). Instead of melted margarine I used 1/3 cup cold butter, cut into chunks, and used my hands to mix it into the topping. It was a lot messier, but the topping came out perfectly crisp and crumbly and I don't think that margarine would have worked as well. Served with vanilla ice cream, which it definitely needed. Overall it was very good!  I edited my rating to five stars - I had another serving the next day and it was even better!

I followed this recipe except for omitting the nuts and I found it to be just okay.I think that it may be the topping that I didn't care for.It was kind of like eating an oatmeal cookie with pie filling.I prefer a traditional crisp topping.On the plus side...this recipe is really simple and fast to prepare!Thank you for submitting it!

It was a big hit for my out of town company and easy to do while I was busy making dinner. I premixed and set aside. I used Raspberry instead of the Cherry, I had it on hand. I would have prefered to use a smaller pan than 2-qt because I would have liked it thicker. I even had my guests ask for seconds (although I though it was kinda sweet by the end of my first serving). Would have been great with Vanilla ice cream of whip topping.

This was good, and really easy.  I recommend putting more than 1/2 the oatmeal mixture on the bottom, so there is less on the top.  Great served with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream.

Very good. I thought there was a bit too much nutmeg flavor though. I will decrease that next time. Definetly serve with vanilla ice cream.

My family eats this once a week. Easiest dessert ever! I use all the canned fruits... It's delicious with peaches or blackberries, by the way! I use walnuts instead of pecans and usually omit the nutmeg except when I use cherries. I usually double the cinnamon too. This is an awesome homemade dessert for week night dinners and a busy family!

Great, quick, easy recipe. The only change I made was to add a 1/4 - 1/2 tsp almond extract, according to your taste. Our grandmothers always used a little almond flavor to their cherry anything. Wonderful, be adventurous...give it a try.

I made this today, and modified it as recommended by some other users: used one cup of flour, one cup of oatmeal, 3/4 cup of brown sugar, 3/4 cup of melted butter.  I didn't have any nuts so I added a tsp of almond extract to the dry mix after the butter was mixed in.  It gave it a very nice scent and a little extra flavour, and went well with the cherries. I didn't add the nutmeg or cinnamon, as I think these would be odd with the cherry flavour. Very easy and quick.

Love the recipe. I omitted the nutmeg because I am not a fan of it. I have also used this recipe and used blueberry pie filling and apple pie feeling. They all were yummy.

I was disappointed.  Maybe it needs more topping, not sure.  (?)  And I'd cut back a bit on the nutmeg.  My husband ate it with ice cream and said it was OK but I don't think I'll make it again.  I'd make a "dump cake" instead.

I tried this recipe tonight.  The nutmeg was overpowering.  The cheery pie mix wasn't sweetened by the topping, even when mixed together when served. I don't recommend this.

I liked this recipe but made some changes.  Concerned about sugar, I reduced 3/4 to 1/2 cup brown sugar and was still pretty sweet...could be less...although may depend on pie filling.  I used a jar of Door County Cherry pie filling.  Also, I omitted the nutmeg and ground fresh cardomom seed (just a twist)...company loved it with whipped cream.

I read the other reviews and made a very successful variation on this.  List of modifications: less nutmeg, a double batch of crisp, quick oats (that's all I had), almonds instead of pecans, and softened butter.  Instead of pie filling, I used frozen unsweetened cherries (thawed of course).  Delicious!

I made a cherry and an apple one and took into consideration the other reviews and made the following revisions-omitted the nutmeg completely and instead of using melted butter, I used pats of butter and cut them with a knife into pea size pieces.  My family prefers apple over cherry and the apple version was absolutely wonderful!  The cherry was good too..

If you love cherry anything, you'll love this. Although its such a simple recipe, it never gets old, and its so good! Sweet and tarte with the nutty topping.. spoon some of this stuff piping hot over french vanilla ice cream- its absolutely heavenly.

I used peach pie filling this time instead of cherry pie filling and actually liked it better. I used Splenda brown sugar(make sure you check the bag for the correct conversion measurement).  I also used reduced fat butter which made the topping a little harrder. I will reduce the bake time by about 5 minutes next time.  I served it warm and topped with vanilla ice-cream.  Yum :)!!

I made this for dessert. I skipped the nutmeg and only used about half of the cinnamon (the hubby isn't a big fan..). He loves anything cherry, and I had to keep him from eating the whole thing! It was wonderful. Definitely my new favorite crisp recipe. THANKS!

Too much nutmeg.  3/4 tsp is over-powering.  I plan to decrease to 1/4 tsp next time.  Otherwise very nice dessert-- yummy served warm over vanilla ice cream.

Super easy & my dad loved it. I had half a can of raspberry pie filling left over from a layer cake. I made the same amount of filling and put half on the top and half on the bottom. It seemed to be just enough. Thanks!

This was a decent cherry crisp, one of my best friends is vegan and I held a lunch for her. She loves cherries and enjoyed it. To avoid , The "canned" taste that everyone refers to, I used No Sugar Added Cherry pie filling and found it less sweet and as an extra treat, I served Sugar Free Cool Whip for us non-Vegan!

Wow!  This was terrific!  I had to find a quick recipe to bring to a Church event and lit on this one as I had all of the ingredients on hand already except for the pie filling.  I doubled the recipe and used a 13 x 9 pan.  Also, I cut hard butter into the crisp mixture instead of using melted butter.  Anyway, it disappeared, so I know it was well-liked.  By the way, I was skeptical about the nutmeg, but it really added a nice touch.  I'll make it again for sure!

I would use a 1 1/2 Quart baking dish instead of 2 because the amount of topping this recipe makes is just enough to cover it so 2 would be to big, also it fits nicely into the 1 1/2. I would also avoid using the nutmeg all together it is not needed when making cherry because cherry desserts are not meant to be nutty, just the cinnamon is fine

This was good.  I used Old Fashioned Oats--not instant, just b/c I like the extra texture.  I think you could use either.  Very sweet, obviously with the pie filling.  I think next time I will make my own cherries in syrup and use less sugar.  Good though.

Great recipe but cut back the cinnamon and nutmeg for a smoother taste.  Really does whip up in minutes.  An 8x8 pan was too big, would work with a double recipe.  Overall a quick and tasty dessert, once the cinnamon was reduced.

Sorry but nutmeg, especially 3/4 tsp. does not belong in this dessert.  The taste was overpowering and not in a good way!  Next time I will leave it out entirely and I'm sure it will taste great!

I loved this recipe.  the only thing i had problems with when i made it before was the nutmeg.  I probably added too much last time so i decided not to add any this time.  It was fantastic.  My grandparents and mom raved about it and now i am expected to make it more often!  Also, you don't have to add the nuts, although it might make it a bit better...you know, add a little crunch, but since grandpa can't have nuts, i didn't add them and it worked out wonderful as well!  I loved it Holly...thanks for the recipe!

I went ahead and read all the reviews prior to trying it myself.  I found that less nutmeg is one of the main issues, so I went ahead and cut it down to 1/3 teaspoon and followed the rest of the recipe.  It came out fabulous, and yes, tastes a whole lot better when it's served warm and with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Thanks for the recipe, but a bigger thanks to all the people who reviewed it and offered great suggestions to make it even better.  Can't wait to serve it on Father's Day!!

Took some suggestions from others... Did 1 1/2 times the crisp, sprinkled about a third on bottom of the pan, only softened butter part way, cut back on the sugar and added some toasted wheat germ. Only used half the cinnamon and of course chopped pecans.  So it doesn't get mushy for the crisp try using old fashioned oats not quick cooking Only used I can of cherry pie filling LITE and only 1/2 tsp orange zest (would probably pass on the zest next time) might also use extra 1/2 can of filling.  Made for 4 people.  BIG hit my grandson had three servings and asked that this dessert be on the list to make for  Christmas.  So I'll be making this again for sure.

I doubled this recipe and made it exactly as written, except I cut in cold butter in the topping instead of using melted margarine.  I thought it was very good.  I also prefer it cold, out of the refrigerator.  Yum!

This was so easy, only one complaint, way to much nutmeg. Next time I will decrease to 1/4 tsp or omit all together. I also used real butter melted, but next time will use cold and cut it in topping mixture so it will be crispier and less cake like. Was great with vanilla ice cream and I am looking forward to trying the recipe with other fruits. Husband loved it, but agreed about the nutmeg.

Very good and easy to make.  Next time I'd probably cut back just a little on the brown sugar, but that's just me.

This dessert is great, but a little too sweet. I added crushed pineapple (1/2 small can) and now it's fabulous! Add whipped cream or vanilla ice cream to make it spectacular!

I used a quarter more ingredients for the topping (1/2 cup flour became 3/4, etc.) and next time I'll use another 21 oz can of cherry filling, as one can isn't enough. I also skipped the nutmeg, as that wasn't a favorite in my house. It was delicious!

I took the advice of other reviewers and decreased the nutmeg to 1/4 teaspoon and increased the cinnamon to 1 teaspoon. I kept all the other ingredients exactly the same and it came out perfect! The topping was the best I have tried and I will be using it as my new 'go-to' recipe for crumb topping on muffins and such. It was very easy easy and quick to make. You could even skip the cooking and put this in the freezer for a later date.

This recipe was pretty darn good!  Because I'm a diabetic, I did make some changes: I used no sugar added pie filling, whole wheat flour, Splenda brown sugar blend, real butter, and only 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.   My friend, who is not a diabetic, ate the whole dish in one sitting minus the small portion I had! I'm definitely adding this to my repertoire.

I actually used fresh cherries (cooked to a canned consistency, cornstarch, sugar, water, etc..) and a pie crust and put this crisp on top - AWESOME!  Thanks so much!  I will use this crisp recipe again and again!

Excellent and easy to make!  Really good when warm.  I omitted the nutmeg b/c I don't like it but it was still fantastic.  I have been crazy cherry pie and this was better than the pie slices I have been getting at a local restaurant.

This was very good.  I had to have some not long after taken from oven.  I thought it was good then but the five star rating I gave it was definitely due to my sampling the next day.  Letting it sit over night made the crumb topping set up and give it the crunch that the name portrays.  Give it a try!  Another recipe made vegan for my daughter by using a margerine without milk ingredients.

Awesome! I made the recipe following some other suggestions and reducing the nutmeg to 1/4 teaspoon.  I made homemade cherry pie filling and instead of melting the butter I cut the butter into the oat/flour mixture. Next time I make this I'll reduce the sugar in the pie filling, but terrific otherwise.

It was really good. I think it would have been really good if I had added more frozen fruit. In my case, I used frozen blackberries and that tasted really good with the cherries.

I just wasn't overly impressed with this dessert, though it was very quick and easy to through together.  Would do in a pinch. Would cut back on the nutmeg.

My son has been bugging me to make a cherry crisp and so I picked this one because it looked easy and I had most of the ingredients on hand.  It turned out really, really well.   Delicious!  I might melt some more margarine for the top next time and I didn't use quite as much nutmeg as suggested.  I'm anxious to try this with other types of fruit.

Great recipe, Holly! This is wonderful. I doubled the crisp as recommended by others but I think it would have been fine without doubling. I added half a teaspoon of almond extract, which made it even yummier. I do think it needed a little salt and I will add some next time I make it.

This is a wonderful, wonderful recipe!!! Since I had fresh cherries to use, I used the recipe from the "Baked Cherry Pie" (also from this site) to make the filling (using half the amount of sugar called for) and then made this crisp (I also reduced the margarine to 1/4 cup). We adored it, and my husband loved it too!!! (Which is amazing, as he is a life-long enemy of all fruit desserts)

Terrific taste of tart cherries and brown sugar. I used cherries packed in water, drained, and whole wheat flour. This got rave reviews from my husband and myself and I will defenitely make this again. Probably good for any kind of berry or apple.

This recipe isnt what it seems.  I made it and it needed way more crumb topping than it makes. I had to make double the crumb amount for it to come out normal. Tastes fine with teh extra crumb, just wish the recipe had the right amounts!

I was in one of those "moods" and had just had to have apple crisp.  I couldn't find a recipe that I liked, but substituted apple filling into this one and it was perfect!

This is a great cherry crisp recipe.  My husband loves cherry anything and this has been his favorite cherry crisp recipe out of all the ones I have made.

This was ok,  a little vanilla ice cream improved it considerably. . 
I usually try to try a recipe exactly as the it is printed so I have a baseline. 
I will make this again, but I will definitely use less sugar and look for a pie filling with more cherries less sugary gel.  
If you like teeth hurting sweet stuff this is the recipe for you.   if you like more fruit flavor, cut the brown sugar by half.

Also good with black cherry filling. And if you add extra spices, its a nice balance with the sweetness.

So delicious! I used cold butter in place of margarine. Cut the cold butter into pieces and mix with dry ingredients mashing it until blended. Also, I used less Nutmeg and a little more cinnamon. Then top the cherries with it and bake. Turns out beautiful.

I've made this with cherry and blueberry pie filling. I left out the spices and both were delicious! I'm thinking you could mix different fillings and have a mixed berry crisp. Thank you!

Needed a recipe to use my canned cherry pie filling and found this one. Only thing I added was a pie crust in the bottom of it. Other than that I used butter for the topping and just softened it at room temp. No margarine EVER in baked goods!!!

Wow! This recipe is so good. I did double the topping as many suggested and was glad I did.  I also added some almond extract to the cherries, and left out the nutmeg. Will definitely be making this again.

Way too much shortening.  I had exactly enough sour cherries to bake one desert from my young cherry tree.   So sorry I picked this one.  It was a soggy mess of grease.  The topping just vanished into a soup.

I wouldn’t melt the butter next time, I felt like the crumble could have been crunchier. Overall this was pretty good. The nuts added a nice crunch

Loved embellishing this classic recipe! I only had half a can of cherry pie filling so I cut up and tossed in a handful of fresh strawberries, topped that with sprinkling of white chocolate chips and I only had almonds on hand instead of pecans. Oh yeah I reduced the nutmeg and cinnamon to 1/2 tsp each.

I added almond extract and some extra Stevia to the pie filling.  I thought it was still a bit tart. Great with vanilla ice cream though!

Fabulous! This will be an ongoing family favorite. I used frozen pie cherries from our harvest last summer. I added a bit of organic sugar & cooked them until the sauce was thickened.  I used all organic ingredients  & cut the sugar by 1/3. 
I used walnuts & added twice as many. I also increased the cinnamon & nutmeg. 
Fabulous!

I did make some changes as I was testing out ideas for a large party.    Put in a 9 x 13 pan..  I used 2 bags of frozen cherries and soaked them in a chocolate wine.  Mixed those with 2 cans of cherry pie filling.   Subbed almonds for pecans because I had them on hand.  Doubled the topping and used cold butter instead of melted.   Everyone who tried it in the tasting room gave it 2 thumbs up so will be making a lot of it in the future for a party!  Adding ice cream or whipped cream helps to balance it out in a good way!

I made this dessert for a "pre" Thanksgiving luncheon at work.  My colleagues really enjoyed it and several asked for the recipe. It is very easy to make with readily available ingredients. I will definitely be making it again soon!

I made this this per the recipe but with the addition of some fresh pineapple to the cherry pie filling since it sounded good and also subbing out the oats for an equal amount of granola since I didn’t have plain oats. I loved my addition and substitution! One thing I would change for future use would be to decrease the amount of margarine (I used butter) called for as it made it a bit too wet for the topping. It’s pretty heavily spiced tasting even though it didn’t seem to use much spice. That might have been due to my quality of cinammon I used.

It was really good. I did add some butter on top of the crumble and baked it about 5-10 minutes longer. Served with whipped cream.

Instead of pie filling, I warmed up some frozen mixed berries (blackberries, blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries) in a saucepan and made a compote with some brown sugar. I also used almonds instead of walnuts on top. Came out lovely!!

I had about half a can of cherry pie filling left over after making crepes, so I halved the recipe, only used a dash of nutmeg, and it was delicious! Served with ice cream the night I made it, it was the perfect size for me husband and me, with a little leftover for a midnight snack! Next time, I may toast the topping (similar to what I do with bread crumbs to give them a little extra crunch), but the recipe really is fantastic as-is!

Used freshly pitted and chopped cherries instead of canned. Mixed a little sugar and flour in the cherries. Added pinches of allspice, ginger, cardamom, & nutmeg to the crumble topping mixture. Served with a dolllop of sour cream. So delicious. I would definitely make this again.

This recipe is just too sweet for me.  My teeth hurt after trying 1 small dish of it; it was so sweet even with ice cream that I won't be eating any more of it.  Sorry - maybe 1/3 cup of brown sugar would be plenty --??

I made it but it was "runny". The directions wrote nothing about draining the cherries. As a consequence it was to wet. Delicious all the same. But next time I'm draining the can.

I did the butter oats, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg (reduced by 1/2), almonds and butter (cold) in food processor made the process really easy. I was surprised I am really a cherry crisp fan, think use this instead of making pies. Was great with ice cream and whipped cream.

I had a pie crust that I needed to use so I made this recipe using the crust for the bottom and followed the rest of the recipe as written.  It was a big mistake on my part using the crust, but the rest of the ingredients were tasty and I will probably make it again following directions.

So easy and oh so good! I had guys coming over to watch a game and thought a sweet snack would be a good idea...It was! I always read other reviews for ideas and I did go with more of the crunchy stuff, using half for a bottom, the other half on top. Perfect! I'm going to go with apple the next time.

This was exceptionally easy to make. Great for a quick, weeknight desert. With that being said, I do have to agree with everyone else that this recipe calls for a bit too much nutmeg. I will probably make this again, but with less.

Wow wow wow!!!  Totally delish.  The only thing I changed was I used fresh tart cherries because we received them in our CSA box this week.  After pitting them, I had 4 cups.  I added sugar and flour to the cherries and heated it up.  I didn't double the crumble.  I would make this again.

Delicious. Basic ingredients. Was craving a sweet at 8:00 pm.
Whipped this out and filled the urge. Excellent tasting and 
changed nothing.

I made this exactly as posted, and it was grand.   Definitely does not need any extra topping.   Actually made two of them.  One with just the cherries and one with the cherries and some frozen blueberries that I had mixed up with a bit of sugar.  I added a little of the blueberry mixture to the canned cherries just for a slight change of flavor (hubby loves bluberries).  Both were wonderful.  Took the original one to my card playing group and have members clamoring for the recipe.  Thanks for this one.  Will be making it again.

Full disclosure - I didn't make this exactly  as written. Instead I chose to put unsweetened applesauce as the base and it was DELICIOUS. I also added a pinch of cloves which worked nicely.

The topping needs sugar.  Not sweet enough.  Too much nutmeg and cinnamon.  The topping was mushy--not crunchy.

I made this on the spur of the moment. I had used part of a can of cherry pie filling, and I had to finish it, so I used this recipe and added one apple diced to fill in. Was having some friends in for dessert. It was easy to make and every one liked it

I have the same recipe I've been making for 30 years and love it.  Mine is double the ingredients and I make my own cherry sauce from fresh Foo County Cherries and it's fabulous!  I use 4 cups of cherries to double her recipe and it makes a 9 x 13 pan.

Delicious and very easy to put together. I halved this recipe. I also made my own filling using 2 cups pitted tart cherries, scant 1/2 cup sugar, and 3T of arrowroot (you can use cornstarch, too). Let it sit about 10 minutes and it's ready to go. Serve the crisp with whipped cream. Hello summer.

Easy and delicious! Serve with Vanilla Ice cream. My only suggestion would be to scale back a little on the nutmeg. And please......Do not use margarine, use BUTTER! Next time (yes it was delicious and there will be a next time!) I am only going to use a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, otherwise omitting it entirely.

I only used 1/2 tsp nutmeg. As another person mentioned, 3/4 tsp would have been too much for sure. I would also recommend 2 cans of the pie filling, but not all of the gelatin that it's in (or use fresh berries). I made for a potluck and needed quick and easy, so I used the pie filling. I also made an apple. Both turned out great. Just more fruit needed than what you get in one can of pie filling.

Easy and versatile fruit crisp recipe! Scaled down for two servings. I used a mixture of left-over cherry pie filling, fresh raspberries and frozen blueberries. Skipped the nutmeg and just used cinnamon. Used cold butter in the topping. Had a little topping left over, so I baked it directly on my silicone mat, alongside the 2 individual ramekins that I filled with the berry crisp. The lone topping baked up like a "cookie crisp" Very, VERY good! I may have to try baking a batch of the topping as cookies on purpose ... I think I would add vanilla and the nutmeg in that case. Super YUM! Thank you ??

LOVED this recipe! I used agave instead of the sugar, whole wheat flour instead of white, olive oil instead of margarine, and almonds instead of pecans. Next time I will certainly cut down on the nutmeg. Makes an excellent Shabbat dessert that is friendly toward my diet!

It was good, but not outstanding.  It was sweet, but not really multiple levels of flavor.  Ice cream would help.  It needs some particular flavor, and maybe almond flavoring would help.

I omitted the nutmeg and used real butter. Served with ice-cream and whipped cream.  It is a fast and wonderful desert if you are pressed for time.  If not, cherry pie is the way to go.

This is good, I didn't use the nutmeg and made enough of the topping to press in the pan as a crust before adding cherry filling and crumble topping.  This begs to be topped with ice cream!!

This recipe is very easy. And its a light dessert so you dont feel wicked full after eating it. I served mine warm with some ice cream and it hit the spot!! I will for sure make this again. Would be a great little dessert for guests.

Would be a very nice and easy dessert without the nutmug. The nutmeg was very overpowering. Might try just a little almond extract in the cherries next time.

I was really looking forward to trying this recipe, but I was disappointed. I followed the recipe exactly, but the topping didn't come together well - I don't think there is enough butter in the recipe to make the dry ingredients for the topping form correctly, and I don't think the butter should be melted first. I have a tried and true Apple Crisp recipe from my Grandmother, and the topping for that always turns out crunchy and delicious. From now on I'll be sticking with Grandma's topping for all my crisps.

This was very good. I followed some other reviews and omitted the nutmeg and doubled the crumble. Next time I think I will add the pecans and omitt a bit of the butter for my taste also may use some extra pie filling.

Easy and adequate, but not stellar.  Will probably not make again.

I doubled the recipe and put into a 9x13 pan. I added 1/3 c. butter to the 2/3c. butter stated. It wasn't very crispy, so I think I added too much butter. It still was good, and we added ice cream, (a must!), so all n all we liked it.

Awesome!  I usually use one cup each of the oats and flour and skip the nuts (although they would be a good addition).  You have to serve it warm with vanilla ice cream-it's a real treat.

I made this dish for a cookout and it was a hit. It was very easy to make. It was great served warm with vanilla ice cream. I will definately be making this again.

This was very good, although I thought the nutmeg was a little overpowering in this dish . I will be making it again, but just cut down the amount of nutmeg. I'd like to try it with a different fruit also. I served it with french vanilla ice cream. Yummy, and super easy to make! Thankyou!

I wasn't overly fond of the nuts on the top ~ next time I make it without them. Thanks for a great recipe Holly! I'll be making this again for sure.

No better than the cobbler in a box you get at the grocery store.

This was a great quick & easy dessert that I made with ingredients I already had on hand.  I omitted the nuts to suit my family's taste, and it was still really good.
