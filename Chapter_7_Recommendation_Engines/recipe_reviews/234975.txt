My grandmother was Ukranian and I can tell you that the "secret" to a flavorful stuffed cabbage,is salt pork.  Melt in the pan, and mix with small amount of garlic and butter and onion.  I add a can of tomato sauce.  Mix together and then pour over stuffed cabbage.  It is also a good idea to mix some of the melted salt pork into the meat. By the way, I only use ground pork, no ground beef. Its more tender and flavorful.

I have almost the same recipe, with one exception.  I got my recipe through my polish mother-in-law, who got hers from HER mother.  It’s hand written, AND, since tomato soup has only been marketed for 101 years, it has NO soup in the recipe.  Mine, & the dozen other “antique” recipes I have, show a variation of crushed whole tomatoes, sliced or stewed tomatoes (my grandmother has a fantastic antique recipe for stewed tomatoes!!!), and tomato sauce, plus spices such as marjoram, thyme, bay, & always in tomato dishes, two walnut shell haves of white sugar.  I’m trying this tonight, as shown, plus some more with a jar of crushed stewed tomatoes in with the soup, because I personally like the chunks & juice like sauce, over the top.  I’ll re-post my results tomorrow.

We liked them. I used homemade tomato soup another recipe I found on this site. We are Polish and make this dish differently and when my sister in law found out there was soup in the mix she wouldn't touch it. Her loss because the homemade soup was an added bonus to a dish we already like. Very nice flavor. I also added a little seasoning to my meat mix.All in all a very nice dish to serve for dinner.

This was the first time I tried making Galabkis. I added more garlic than recipe called for - about a tablespoon and a half, along with lots of ground pepper and some additional salt.. The recipe calls for it to cook for one hour at 350 - it was not done (maybe my oven?). I increased the temp. to 375 and cooked it for 1/2 more.  I would try this again - good flavor.

Excellent recipe... I love it! I wondered if it was really necessary to use Tomato Soup, Tomato Juice and Tomato Ketchup, but I'm glad I did... The combination cooked down nicely to not only be thick, but also had exactly the right amount of "bite," presumably from the vinegar in the Ketchup. The only changes I made were:
- added an egg to help bind it
- used approx 1/2 teaspoon Garlic Powder (instead of Garlic Cloves)
- added 1/2 teaspoon Paprika
- and I seasoned the water right before adding the rice (a little butter, salt and pepper, of course, but also some Paprika and Parsley).

I will definitely make this again. I absolutely loved it! :-)

Hubby said "was very good" then "was very very good".  I had never used tomato soup before, but I bit the bullet and followed the recipe.  The only difference was I added 2 TB of Worcheshire (sp) sauce because I have always put in my cabbage rolls.  We also used Jimmy Dean sausage instead of just ground pork and it gave it an extra little kick.  I'm sure it would be great without doing these two things so I gave it a 5 stars.  Great tasting.

The only change I made is I don't use ketchup.  Other than that, this recipe is delicious!  My Mom even loves them and I compare everything I make to my Mom's!

This is almost the same way I have made golambki. as did my mother. I do use a meatloaf mix which has some veal in it.  Also, you can put some left over cabbage leaves in the bottom of the pot to avoid burning the golambki on the bottom. Mashed potatoes goes well with the meal.

I absolutely love this recipe and so does my family. 
one time I overcooked the cabbage twice (I had 2 heads of cabbage that day) so what I did what shred up all the cabbage and mixed everything into a casserole dish and baked. taste just like the recipe just all cut up.

It was watery and bland. Will fiddle with it some and try again.
