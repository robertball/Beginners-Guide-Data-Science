Before you make this recipe, keep in mind the serving size is off. If you make this recipe as written without adjusting the servings, you should get about three dozen (36) cookies. I rolled my dough into sugar and then into perfect balls and didn't flatten the cookies at all and you can see from my photo how much they spread out. I don't recommend flattening them at all. Just add the Hershey Kisses firmly into the centers as they come out. They tasted great and I would be open to using this recipe again!

This recipe made 48 cookies. I know one person said it made much less, but I think she used a tablespoon for the dough and not a teaspoon. Big difference. Since I have invested in different sized cookie scoops, I have had 100% more success with every cookie I bake.
