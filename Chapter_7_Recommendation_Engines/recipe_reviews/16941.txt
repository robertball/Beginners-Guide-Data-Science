It doesn't work! After 6 hours of maranade, 8 hour refrigeration with the dry rub on it and 10 hours baking at 170, it was raw. 16 hours and it was barely warm. Some changes need to be made.

I slow cooked this recipe for 10 hours,and anticipated how delicious it would be. I was disappointed when I tasted it. The brisket was so salty! Unfortunately, all my time was wasted. I do not recommend this recipe.

Consider cold smoking on grill for 2 or 3 hours to get the nice smoke ring, then wrap in foil and put into a 275 degree oven for 3 hours. Once internal temp is 185 degrees, the tough tissue holding meat together will break down. Refrigate over night then slice, heat back up and serve. You will get a great cut and brisket will not rip like a roast.

I actually cooked three 7 lb briskets for my wedding reception.  However, I did not refrigerate the briskets after putting on the rub, I cooked them immediately.  They were fully cooked after 10 hours at 170 degrees. The brisket got rave reviews.  I would guess that the brand of rub would affect the outcome alot!

This  was delicious. My brisket was small, so I was forced to make some changes. The cooking directions for this recipe are very vague. I chose to use a small roaster. I wrapped the brisket loosely in foil and set it inside the roaster. This held in the juices and made the meat very tender. For "steak rub" I used "Spicy Flat Iron Steak Rub" from Allrecipes. (I left out the Ancho Chile powder - didn't have any.)
