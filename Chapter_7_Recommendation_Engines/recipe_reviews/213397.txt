What a delicious potato recipe that even got my guys to eat cabbage!  The potatoes were creamy and I loved the slight tang from the vinegar.  It is a great way to use up left over "coleslaw" in a bag.  It paired well with our meatloaf dinner and will definitely be a repeat in our house.   Thanks for sharing!

Made for RECIPE GROUP. We loved this! I made exactly as written. The only thing I would do differently is use fresh garlic. I sauteed the onion, carrot and cabbage until they were almost caramalized. Then added to the smashed potatoes. Oh, and I used Lactose Free Whole Milk. YUM!!! This is good comfort food!

Made for recipe group. Recipe was cooked as written, as best I could and ending product was very tasty and unique. All the flavors I was looking for in a different format. Two in one side, very well received.

I made this for Recipe Group.  I only changed one ingredient: used only 1/2c. milk (it would have been too wet with a whole cup).  I cooked it according to the instructions; however, I found the cabbage step to be cumbersome.  Next time I would add the cabbage to the skillet of cooked carrots and onions.  The Balsamic vinegar in the water did not do much for the flavor although I found I could taste a hint of it in leftovers the next day.  For a more prominent vinegar flavor I would add it to the skillet.  I did not salt the potato water and was concerned about flavor; however, the garlic salt added at the end provided plenty of flavor enhancement. For potatoes I used Yukon Gold and left the skin on which provided good texture and taste.  I left the mashed potatoes a bit lumpy because that is how i like them. I served the kolcannon with bacon bits which I may add in next time. This recipe requires several pans and cooking utensils so be prepared for cleanup afterwards.  Overall I like the flavors in the recipe-- how could anything with a stick of butter in it taste bad?  I would make it again.  Thank you Margaret for the interesting recipe.

Made this recipe for Recipe Group. If you like "Boiled Dinner" you'll like this. I do. Used red potatoes. This is a great side dish for corned beef brisket. I mixed the raw, shredded cabbage with a tsp of balsamic vinegar and a pinch of salt in a glass bowl and covered it with plastic wrap. Then I microwaved it on Fresh Veggie setting instead of steaming it over the potatoes. Stirred the cabbage into the onion/carrot mixture in the skillet and proceeded with the recipe as written.

I made this for recipe group. I used half the milk and was still wishing I had added a little less. I sauteed the cabbage with the veggies since I didn't have a way to do the colander method. The flavor was very good and I thought the balsamic did add to it but I also had to simmer my taters for about 45 min because I used to small of a pot. Definitely on the list to make again.

Made for Recipe Group. I like the addition of cabbage in the mashed potatoes, it gives it an almost sweet tangy flavor. I'm not sure what the step involving cooking the cabbage in the potato pot is for. Whether it is to save another pot to clean or to enhance the flavor of the cabbage. I started out with it that way but it stopped the boiling process, so I ended up just adding it into the carrots and onions I was cooking part way through the potato boiling process. Medium high is too high for cooking the onions and carrots, they would be burnt before 10 minutes is up. I halved the recipe and the 1/2 cup of milk I dumped into the potatoes was way too much. What was I thinking? I ended up having to cook them to get the liquid out so I could finish the recipe up. Good flavor, needed more salt on my end which is easy enough fix. Not sure if the balsamic actually did anything to the flavor, may add it directly into the carrot mixture the next time. A good recipe, thanks!

Great St.Paddy's day side dish to corned beef.  We used cream instead of milk for a richer taste.  Even our picky friend Michelle liked it!

Recipe Group selection of 1/21/12.  I followed most of the recipe, cutting back on the butter and milk as well as using fresh garlic instead of the garlic salt.  I liked the addition of the carrot, but I don't see what the balsamic vinegar did for the potatoes.  The taste was good, but I prefer to simply saute my cabbage with the onion and garlic and I usually do it in bacon drippings.  All in all, I think I will add carrot, but go back to my usual method of preparation.  Thanks Margaret!

I knew we would love this dish as I making it.  The taste of these ingredients together is so mouth pleasing, I don't think I'll ever make plain mashed potatoes again.  Thanks Margaret for sharing this recipe.  It will be made again and again!

Really yummy! We will make this again. I didn't cook the cabbage with the potatoes but rather saut√©ed it with the onion and carrot. I also followed some of the recommendations and used half the milk called for. It was perfect. It was our first time trying Kolcannon and my family loved it. Thanks for sharing Margaret.

I made this using instant mashed potatoes (I'd bought the box to try out a potato roll recipe and was looking for a way to use it up- It isn't a staple for us, we prefer the real deal) so my method was a little different. I prepared the instant potatoes according to the package instructions with the addition of 1 TBsp. of balsamic vinegar (the 2 TBsps. called for originally to steam the potatoes & cabbage so I assumed the full amount wasn't necessary). Set aside. I then cut up the cabbage and sauteed it in a little bacon grease & EVOO. Covered, and let it cook down some. Then added the onions, and let it cook down more. When nearly done, I added the garlic and seasonings. Omitted the carrot. Once the cabbage mixture was done I mixed it into the potatoes until well combined. Served this with maple Dijon bone-in pork chops.

Excellent!  The only revision made was to lessen the amount of oil and almond milk. Thanks so much!  Oh, and I veganized it. Thanks so much
