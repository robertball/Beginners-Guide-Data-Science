OK this is going to be my holiday appetizer for 2006.  I am having a Christmas party and going to several and these will be what I am taking.  I made up a batch to test it out using the excuse it was a "new recipe". I followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic. Make sure you do not leave out the chutney; it can usually be found in the steak sauces and marinades section. Major Grey brand is the easist to find and my favorite. Its sweetness really adds a contrast to the more salty spinach layer. After trial and error I figured out for the layers to end up exactly even after rolling, I could not start with the layers exactly on top of each other. Instead I offset the top crab layer around 2 inches towards the beginning of the roll and started with it picking and up the bottom layer. By the time I finished they were even. Defintely wrap in plastic and refrigerate at least an hour so that you can slice them in 1/2 inch slices.  That is the perfect width. Enjoy!

Good, next time might try using real crab meat.  Also, use red tortillas for color.  Needs to be made several hours before hand (like the night before).  No taste loss the next day.  One trick to use, is to spread all mixture around the edges to make it stick.  Roll center loosely, then roll tight around edges.

These taste just like the spinach dip you put in a bread bowl. They were just average, with the crab and the chutney I thought they would have a really unique flavor.

Yum! I made these for a beach get-together this past weekend. They were gone so quickly! Didn't change anything, except, I used  red and green tortillas for color and they were even eaten by the youngsters that were there. Thank you for the great recipe!
