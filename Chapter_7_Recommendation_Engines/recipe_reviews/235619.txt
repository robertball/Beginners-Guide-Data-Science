This went over pretty well at Thanksgiving. We made it a couple of days in advance.  My dad absolutely loved it and asked for more so he could freeze it. Itâ€™s a bit on the tart side but most people liked it. It was fantastic with leftovers, cheese sandwiches, and even used it on toast. Thank you for the recipe.

I have found that even people that don't care for cranberry sauce like this one.  My son took this to work & they were passing it around trying to figure out the mystery ingredient.... dried apricots.

I love the flavor of this sauce. I increased the tangerine juice to three tangerines and the flavor really comes through.
