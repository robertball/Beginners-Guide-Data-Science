The oats took longer to toast than 5 minutes; I kept toasting them until they were separated like a grain and not a lumpy mix. It was a bit unclear from the recipe what the oats were to look like. However, I figured it out and they turned out great! I have tried a number of oatmeal cookie recipies and this one is the best by far. I don't even time them, just watch them and about 30 seconds after they have fallen they're done. Chewyish with crispy edges. These are really easy too...I'm a novice at this. I brought them in to my department and they were gone in no time. Try this one!

Soooooo good!  I used Quaker old fashioned oatmeal and followed the recipe exactly.  My only complaint is that it didn't make enough!  I will be making these cookies again and doubling the recipe.  Delicious!

This recipe is great!  I used a different method to toast the oats though...even though that may take something from the recipe...I toasted my oats in a jellyroll pan at 350 for 20 minutes stirring once half way through, and then incorporated the butter into the recipe instead of using it to brown the oats.  I can't stop eating the dough before they even go into the oven!  Delicious!

I was looking for a cookie with very little flour since I'm wheat sensitive. I substituted oat flour and these turned out great! Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly, cooking them a minute or two longer. They came out crunchier and tasted like the BEST granola bar I'd ever eaten! Yay! Now I have something for breakfast that's wheat-free and yummy. Thanks!

awesome recipe! i added mini chocolate chips to half of the dough and they tasted great! Must make them again! Be careful baking these cookies though, they burn quite easily at the bottom, mine took about 8 minutes per batch.

I really liked these a lot, although my husband complained that they weren't "doughy" enough for him. He still managed to eat plenty. I would have given this 4.5 stars!

I thought this recipe was delicious! My boyfriend wanted something that was loaded with oats and this was the perfect recipe. Two modifications I made is that I reduced the butter to 1/2 c. and I added white chocolate chips. A great fall cookie recipe. Yum!

These cookies are very, very good.   I am not a huge oatmeal cookie fan, but I love these.  I made them for a church group and everybody raves about them.  Everyone says they are the best oatmeal cookies they have ever had.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was ok, but for two people we didnt need 4 dozen cookies so I halved it.  This may have been the problem, but they were at first too runny and then when they baked, turned a bit too-chewy.  The chewiness does help a bit though because your mouth gets so tired you can only really eat one.  Tasty, but I wouldnt recommend altering it.

I was out of butter and baking powder, so I substituted E.V. Olive Oil and tripled with baking soda.
Cooked in gas oven 350 10min,

I made these for my son who is under the weather, and he liked them.

Came out a little too oily for my tastes, but the flavor is great. Will try again with maybe a bit more flour to absorb the butter. Browned and toasted oats are terrific.

These cookies have an excellent flavor and texture. Not too sweet, but with a rich nutty flavor and a really great balance between chewy and crispy.  This recipe is great as is, but it would be excellent with raisins, nuts, coconut or chocolate chips. I cut this recipe in half, and like another reviewer, had trouble getting them to the right consistency. The trick is the egg: just the yolk makes these cookies far too thick, so add the yolk and a little of the white until the cookies hold together.

My fiancé and I made these together  - they were quick, easy and quite delicious :)   For the brown sugar I used 1/2 cup white sugar and a few globs of blackstrap molasses, mixing them together until a rich brown. We used whole wheat flour. He wanted to add chocolate which has its own sweetness anyway so he mixed chunks of dark Guittard as well as white Ghirardelli into the oat mixture, but it was still warm so all of the chocolate melted into the dough instead of staying as chunks, haha. It's okay they turned out delicious!  Few things to note - we placed balls of dough on the cookie sheet and baked for 10 minutes, then took out, flattened with a spatula and cooked for 10 more minutes. Seemed that they'd fall apart if we tried to flatten while still raw, and the cookies didn't fall on their own, maybe because of all of the sticky stuff that we added.

I followed this recipe exactly.  Cookies are pretty good but they sure didn't spread while baking. I don't know why the instructions say to place them 3" apart. And it was hard to get them to hold together long enough to even form a cookie - very crumbly dough.  For the second pan into the oven I pressed all the cookies with a floured glass so at least those presented better.  IF I make these again, I'll add some kind of liquid or another egg or something so they will hold together and spread a bit.  Mine look nothing like the picture.

This recipe was very easy and fast to do. I used granola instead of regular oats and they turned out great! In total, it took me 30 minutes no prepare them and 15 minutes to cool the cookies.

I'm not usually a huge fan of oatmeal cookies, but toasting the oats made all the difference!  I didn't have brown sugar on hand, so I substituted white, and added some chocolate chips.  These were great just out of the oven, but got a bit hard the next day.  It would probably help to flatten them slightly on the pan, although dipping them in hot chocolate is always an enjoyable alternative.

These cookies are a great variation of the traditional oatmeal cookie...the toastiness of the oats makes a big difference... next time I will add some flax, wheat germ, nuts, seeds and make these my boys breakfast cookie...thanks for a good recipe!

Every person has asked me for the recipe. Great cookies.
