Kids said that these are better than Reese's! Very tasty. Has anyone tried using just 1 stick of butter successfully? I'll let you know if it works! UPDATE: I made these with 1 1/2 sticks of butter with equally delicious results. I will update again trying 1 stick...UPDATE #2: Okay, I tried one stick of butter - the taste is still delicious! The only difference is that the peanut butter part is a little more crumbly...doesn't hold together quite as well...so you decide how much butter you want to use!

These have become an absolute staple in my house!  Also, it is my total standard recipe for 'gotta-bring-something-sweet' to 'fill-in-the-blank'.  SO easy, SO fast and terrific for satisfying those cravings.  I chill the peanut butter base for 15 or 20 minutes before topping with the chocolate so the warm chocolate doesn't melt into the peanut butter too much, making spots of too thick chocolate and leaving other areas spread too thin!

These were great!  I was a little worried because I used natural peanut butter and the bottom layer was really runny when I put it in the pan.  I am glad I kept them refrigerated because they do soften quickly at room temperature but all in all, they turned out great.  Everyone who tried them loved them and my friend wanted the recipe.  I had hoped to find a review saying they work even with natural peanut butter but couldn't find one, so now you know!  I'm sure they are firmer with regular peanut butter but I'll save myself the hydrogenated oil!

UPDATE:  This has become a staple in our house as well as many of our friends.  I still prefer natural peanut butter, and I've found Skippy Natural works the best, but you can do with other kinds like Laura Scudders, etc.  Just keep them in the fridge!

SO GOOD!!!!  If you are a peanut butter/chocolate fanatic like me, then you will love this.  I followed other reviewers suggestions to make the recipe easier by melting the peanut butter with butter, then mixing with graham crackers and powdered sugar.  Also, chill the peanut butter base for 15 minutes before topping with chocolate mixture.

Out of all the chocolate/peanut butter bar recipes on this site, this one to me is the best because it has a good ratio of chocolate layer to peanut butter layer and also is not too sweet to allow the chocolate and peanut butter flavors to shine through.  I made a few alterations for my own personal taste as well. I added an extra 1/2 cup peanut butter to the bottom layer mixture.  I  also used Hershey's Special Dark chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet chips and I used the whole 12 oz bag (for 2 cups  total).  Since I had more chips, I also added 1/4 cup of butter to the chocolate/peanut butter melting mixture.  This helps keep the chocolate layer smooth and spreadable and helps adhesion to the peanut butter layer.

I decreased the butter to 1 1/2 sticks, and used 14 graham crackers, and milk chocolate chips.  I used softened butter instead of melted.  You really need to pulverize the graham crackers to a fine powder to get the texture of this recipe right (a food processor works great).  I used a 7x11 pan so they'd be thicker.  Taste just like Reese's except the filling is a little coarser.  Keep these babies in the refrigerator or you'll have a soft, gooey mess on your hands!

A hit, a major hit.  Our guests loved this, we loved this, my children asked me to make it again this week.  Since we only have dessert once a week, that is a big compliment!  To make mixing easier, I put the pb in the pan with the butter and let it "melt" along with the butter.  Then I added both to the graham crackers and powdered sugar.  Otherwise, I followed it exactly.  Thanks!

I loved these Peanut Butter bars! I helped my Mom make them. They were easy enough that I could make them on my own! This tops any dessert I ever had! We froze half of the bars they were great too. For the peanut butter part, we only used a half of cup of butter instead of a whole cup.

These were really good.  I would like a bit more peanut butter flavor (personal preference).  Based on another recipe I cut the bars up after chilling for 10 minutes, then chilled until ready to serve.  I had no problem with the chocolate breaking up that way.

Mini muffin pan + mini muffin liners = MINI PEANUT BUTTER CUPS!!! Drizzle warm chocolate into a thin layer on the bottom, place a small ball of the peanut butter mixture(leaving space between it and the liner all around the sides) and drizzle more chocolate over the ball until it is fully encased! 

The chocolate set up quickly and beautifully. I'm bringing them to a Thanksgiving event so I will update with pictures and how well they went over. If they taste anything like they look and smell they'll be a hit!

These are very good and very sweet. I made them to send to a friend and they didn't turn out as sturdy as I was hoping for. I'm keeping this batch (poor me) and will make her another using less butter in the PB mixture and less PB in the chocolate. I think I'll also add a little salt. Thanks for the recipe!

These are so easy to make and taste amazing! The only changes I made that were suggested by other reviewers was using 1 1/2 sticks of butter and also chilling the peanut butter/graham cracker base layer for 25 minutes before adding the warm chocolate peanut butter layer. I used dark chocolate chips one time, and used the semisweet chips another time (I usually only eat dark chocolate!) and couldn't really notice a difference. My boyfriend loved them and took some to work--his coworkers loved them too. They actually ask for them! They are very addicting.

I made the recipe EXACTLY as instructed -- no substitutions, no reductions or increases in ingredients. You know, the way you're supposed to if you're going to review a recipe. :)  After doing so, I have three tips: 
1. I found the texture of the bottom peanut butter layer in the finished bars to be somewhat "grainy," for lack of a better term, and I processed my graham crackers VERY fine. I suggest mixing them with the melted butter and then letting them sit until they have gotten completely mushy before you add the peanut butter.
2. About prepping the pan and cutting them: I lined my pan with that nonstick liner that's parchment on one side and foil on the other side, with the foil side down. (No pan cleanup makes this a real bonus.) After refrigerating the bars overnight, I turned the full brick out CHOCOLATE SIDE DOWN -- very easy if you use the liner -- onto a piece of waxed paper and let them sit for 15 minutes so they got soft enough to cut. I used a pizza cutter, but whatever works for you.  Using this method I had very little cracking of the chocolate layer, and they're quite attractive.
3. Store them in the fridge unless you like this sort of thing gooey or unless you keep your house VERY cool. The butter in the PB layer  makes them good, but it doesn't hold up well at room temperature. I layered mine with waxed paper in a Tupperware container and they are holding together quite nicely. 
This is an easy and delicious treat. The instructions just need some tweaking.

These turned out great! I had read previous posts where people had used natural peanut butter and it had not set up. I also used natural peanut butter and it turned out perfect. This is what I did - I added the graham cracker crumbs, sugar and peanut butter to my kitchen aid and mixed. I melted the butter and then just poured it in until it looked like a good consistency…..there was still quite a bit of the butter left. I mixed it well, and it set up great, I did not need to keep it in the fridge like others had with the natural peanut butter. I hope that helps! YUMMY!!!

I found these didn't turn out as I had hoped! The semi-sweet chocolate gave it a funny flavor and the chocolate was super hard to cut unto while the peanut butter bottom was a bit soft. I bake out of my home and wanted to try some new recipes, this just isn't one I'd use. It had a some what good flavor, but next time I would definately use a diiferent flavor chocolate chip and try a different method on letting them set and harden.

I am a beginner baker and have to say that these peanut butter bars are completely fool proof! They taste great and completely satisfy my sweet tooth! I followed to recipe exactly in addition to these reviewer's tips: 1) allow the peanut butter base to harden in the refrigerator for 20mins before spreading the chocolate on top; 2) cut the squares after about 20mins in the refrigerator to prevent the chocolate topping to crack. I strongly recommend this recipe for anyone who loves peanut butter and sweet desserts!

Yum! Made these for Christmas- my grandma made her famous apple and pumpkin pies but everyone stood around waiting for me to cut these! Next time I make them, I'm going to use less sugar- maybe 1.5 cups because 2 cups is just too much, these are tooth-achingly sweet. Also, I can't recommend enough lining the pan with something- parchment would be best but anything would work since you're not baking them. With the amount of butter I didn't think twice about following the instructions and not greasing the pan, but I wish I had- getting them out was a pain. It's a little easier when they're a bit softer but they're harder to eat then... catch 22! All in all, very yum. Why eat reeses?!

So yummy and so easy!! I took the suggestion from other reviewers to melt the peanut butter WITH the butter for easier mixing. I had to use honey graham crackers because that's what was in my pantry. I used 1 stick of salted and 1 stick of unsalted butter and even added a big pinch of sea salt. This was perfect for my taste. The semi-sweet chocolate helped to tone down the sweetness of the p.b. mixture as well. If I would've used milk chocolate chips, as another reviewer suggested, it would've been WAY too sweet for me. After patting the peanut butter mixture into a parchment-covered 9x13 dish, I refrigerated for approx. 30 mins. before spreading the melted chocolate on top. I'm glad I used the entire 12oz. bag of chocolate chips rather than the 1 1/2 cups the recipe called for because I feel if I hadn't, my chocolate layer would've been pretty thin. I refrigerated again for approx. 45 mins. and then cut into small squares. I read a few reviews where folks had trouble with the chocolate layer separating from the p.b. mixture and I'm happy to say I didn't have this problem :) These are so good with a tall glass of ice-cold milk...mmmm!

I was the hit of the party with these bars!  Everyone loved them!  I followed the advice of one reviewer and melted the peanut butter with the butter.  This made it very easy to mix and to  spread in the pan.  I also lined the pan with wax paper, so when I was ready to cut, I just pulled it out of the pan and put it on a chopping block.  The peanut butter melted into the chocolate topping was perfect.. I used a double boiler for that.  I will definitely make these again for my next event.

I thought these were excellent. As others have said, it reminded me of the treats they used to make in my elementary school cafeteria (OK, that was about a million years ago!). Those who have said that the crust is "too wet," cannot be doing this right. My guess is that these people have not used the full  2 cups of crumbs (btw, 14 graham crackers is approximately 1 cup--a full box 14.4 oz box is needed for 2 cups). The butter--regardless of the amount--will be totally absorbed by the cracker crumbs. In other words, "wet" crust is NOT because the amount of butter is too much. You could cut it back a bit if you like, but it won't drastically change the texture. As a couple of other commenters have said, after melting the 1.5 cups of chocolate, I felt like it needed a bit more. So, I added another 1/2 cup before pouring/spreading the topping.

Thanks for the trip down memory lane.

I really wanted to rate this a 5, but the chocolate top layer kept separating from the bottom layer which made cutting and serving this for a party a little tricky.

I did use all natural pb. I wonder if that is the problem.

I did step one in a food processer, which allowed me to freshly crumb the graham crackers first, and then add the remaining ingredients. 

The flavor was very good. Just the texture issue with the 2 layers separating.

This is the best candy recipe I have ever tried.  It is absolutely delicious and so easy.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I did let the peanut butter base set in the frig for 30 minutes before making the chocolate topping.  Then I let the entire thing chill for two hours before I cut it.  It was perfect.  There is no reason to change anything about this recipe.  I would suggest you try it as written before you start making changes because I doubt you will want to change a thing.  It really does taste just like a Reese Peanut Butter Cup.

I have to agree with other reviewers: I would call these Reese's peanut butter bars if I could. These calorie-packed monsters taste just like Reese's peanut butter cups except they're in the form of bars. But for me, this recipe is four-star because it is TOO sweet. I even decreased confectioner's sugar to 1-1/2 cups, but they were still sweet. Even my American friends thought that they were plenty sweet. SCARY! If I ever make these again, I'd use only 1 cup confectioner's sugar. And with that adjustment, I'd increase the amount of graham cracker crumbs for a firmer base by 1/4 to 1/2 cup, which was what I did this time. I also used only 1-1/2 sticks margarine, which worked well. For both the base and choc layer, I used chunky peanut butter; I only stirred in 3 Tbsp peanut butter in the choc mixture though and the peanut-butter flavor was strong enough for me. I decreased choc chips to 1 cup as well. But, instead of all choc chips, I melted 1/2 cup hazelnut milk choc squares. That's why you can see bits of white-colored nuts in the choc layer. Overall, this is a calorie-loaded treat that we can enjoy once in a while--BUT, only with the amount of sugar decreased!

OMG!!!  I made this for friends and ended up eating the entire batch myself!  I'm such a PIG!  

FYI, I used natural peanut butter and think this will make a significant difference, as compared to processed PB.

I would not make these again, I did not taste enough peanut butter. Anyone that is going to try this recipe might want to try adding a little more peanut butter and taking some butter away.

Easy and tasty! My first attempt wasn't so good but I changed a few things and voila! success!  I did 2 packs of graham crackers processed in the food processor to a very fine consistency, and I melted the peanut butter and butter together.  I refrigerated these in the 9x13 pan for about 20 min. before I added the topping.  For the topping I used a bag (12 oz) of semi-sweet choc chips and a 1/4 c. peanut butter.  After putting on the topping I put them back in the fridge for another 20 min and then cut them.  They look great and taste even better!

The photo posted is misleading because they do not come out that thick in a 9x13 pan.  You may want to use a much smaller pan.  These are extremely sweet, be ware!

I made this recipe exactly as provided, and I found the peanut butter layer to be too crumbly and too sweet. I'm not sure how this ended up so differently than some of the really positive reviews. Overall, the flavor is pretty good, and I like the texture that the graham cracker crumbs adds. I would simply prefer the PB layer to be a bit more moist. Perhaps next time I could cut back on the sugar and crumbs and maybe add a bit more PB.

Oofta ... These are so rich!  The recipe says there are 12 servings, but I would say that this it is closer to 24.  As others have suggested, I added some extra peanut butter to the bottom -- About 1/4 cup.  I also added 1/2 tsp. of salt to cut the sweetness just a little bit.  After I mixed the peanut butter layer and put it in the pan, I used a piece of waxed paper to flatten it and get a nice even thickness.  I also refrigerated it for a while to get it nice and firm before putting the chocolate layer over the top.  My husband thought that these tasted like peanut butter cups, as the description says.  I thought that they also resembled Girl Scout Tagalongs or even a little like a Butterfinger.  Will make again, but make sure we have lots of people to share them with ... I don't even want to think about the calories and fat in these puppies!  :)

Ok, so as written. the recipe gets a 3 from me: here's why. 1 cup of butter, melted was WAY too much! My mixture was like a soup when it should have been more like a semi solid that I could press into a pan. The only way to offset this was to add more graham cracker crumbs which made the mixture too grainy. Next time I will only use 3/4 cup butter melted and see how that turns out.

I created my own crumbs from graham crackers in the food processor, then added the powder sugar, mixed; then added the peanut butter, and as this was mixing added the butter slowly.  It was much quicker than doing it by hand. My husband loves Reese's, and he loved these more...as he says "This is a do over".

The first time I made these, they were to die for. The second time, not so much. The second time I used cheaper ingredients so don't make that mistake. I portioned these out and wrapped individually before keeping them in the fridge (they get really soft at room temperature).

These are a favorite at our house.  If you don't like the gritty texture just grind the graham crackers for a long time in a food processor, add the butter and let the butter soak into the crackers  for a few minutes before continuing.  To keep the chocolate topping from cracking when cutting leave it out of the fridge for 15 minutes before cutting. You can line the pan with parchment paper, which makes it easy to remove out of the pan, lay it upside down on another piece of parchment paper, bring it to room temperature for about 15 minutes, cut it with a pizza cutter and return it to the fridge before eating.  They will come out perfect, but are better to eat while they are cold.

Great recipe!  My daughter has to eat gluten-free and casein-free because of autism, so I replaced the graham cracker crumbs with rice krispies (crushed) and the margarine with a milk-free version.  I'm sure it wasn't the same as the original version, but still really tasty!

this recipe is ok, i found that for a smoother and better peanut butter taste, use the recipe for buckeyes that was submitted on this site by Tammy Winters and instead of making them out into balls, just press into bottom of pan. i use half semi-sweet choc chips and half milk chocolate chips that is more to my families likes, and the 4 tbls. of peanut butter mixed into the melted chocolate is a wonderful idea.

Used chocolate graham crackers and a little bit of crushed oreos because that's what I already had but they came out amazing! My only suggestions are, you shouldn't need more than 3/4 cup of butter... maybe even a little less. And using a 9x13 they would come out really thin so I would make more of the graham cracker mixture or use a smaller dish. Otherwise this is a great recipe I will definitely use again!

All I can say is WOW!!! My work does a rotating snack schedule and on my week I brought these.  They were so good that they were gone in 15 min.  My only comment is to make sure your graham crackers are finely crushed, or they will be grainy.

I made these and it's way more than one household with 3 kids needs to be consuming. I ended up cutting them up and giving a baggie full to 2 separate next door neighbors. The first guy took one out of the baggie and ate it and wanted to steal the other baggie.  Guess that means they went over well. LOL

I highly recommend using milk chocolate and not semi-sweet. I honestly cannot rave enough about this fantastic recipe! It is way better than a Reese's. I will make a full batch to take to parties or events and I make half batches for myself to enjoy throughout the week and pour it into a glass pie pan. I usually add more chocolate to the top, mmmmmmmm......

8-18-2017  ~No kidding, this copycat recipe for Reese’s peanut butter cups really is convincing!  Hubs loves peanut butter cups and even he remarked how close to the real deal they are.  An added bonus is that they are super quick and easy to make and require no baking.  I did reduce the butter from one cup to 3/4 cup and the bars didn’t seem to suffer for it. In fact, I’m wondering if using the full amount called for might have made these a little on the greasy side for us. Recipes for these copy cat Reese’s peanut butter cups have been around for years and years and now that I’ve finally made them I’m wondering what took me so long.

I've been wanting a good peanut butter bar recipe for a while, and after seeing all the great reviews, thought this one looked good.  My family and I were pretty disappointed.  I made the recipe exactly as it said (even though I considered cutting the butter in half).  They were quite bland and I almost felt like I was biting into a cube of butter.  The recipe needs to be reworked to make it a 5.  If I were to even attempt these again, I would decrease the butter, increase the sugar, and add vanilla for starters.  As is, they were lacking.

Everyone loved it.  Instead of using graham cracker i used golden graham cereal and made the bars that way with the peanut butter.

Addictive! Update 9/4/10: Made this for the second time tonight. Got to be one of the easiest treat recipes I have ever made! Can throw a pan together in no time. Unfortunately, they will also disappear in no time!! Used the suggestion in another review and made it using 2 cups of chips and 1/4 cup peanut butter in the topping. Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly the first time, and I love these! I make them all the time now. One change I make sometimes is to lower the amount of icing sugar, and up the graham cracker crumbs, just because sometimes I find the base toooo sweet. But I don't do that all the time.

The only reason I am giving this 4 instead of 5 is I followed sunnybirds suggestion and used less butter in the PB mix. I used about 3/4 c. That said, these are absolutely wonderful. The kids loved them and said they were better than reese's cups! I love the fact that you can make these and never have to turn on the oven. Wonderful when it is very very very hot out. Thanks for sharing this wonderful quick and easy treat!

Just like peanut butter cups is right! If you refridgerate before putting chocolate one, be sure not to cool it too much cause then the chocolate layer won't stick and it will crack when you cut it...

For those of you who say the instructions are confusing.. Read the ingredient list.  It clearly states 1 cup of peanut butter and then another 4 tablespoons peanut butter.  The 4 tablespoons are what you mix with the chocolate for melting.  Also, due to variations in humidity and moisture content in different peanut butter brands, etc, those who are having problems with the filling being too runny need to adjust and add more powdered sugar or graham crackers to achieve the desired consistency.   

If you make changes based on how it sets up, you will be fine.  I've made this recipe probably a dozen times and I always have to make minute adjustments according to temperature or humidity and brands of peanut butter.  After a few times making it, you can easily see how to adjust it.

I have made this many times now, and EVERY TIME I use an entire box of Keebler Graham Cracker Crumbs to achieve the texture I am after.  I then line a jelly roll pan with parchment paper, put on plastic foodservice gloves (a lifesaver for many messy recipes and doughs), and just squoosh the PB mixture down onto the pan. After topping with chocolate I refrigerate until set, then lift the parchment out and cut with a pizza wheel.  So. Easy.  Tastes like Buckeyes with none of the hassle.   Now here is my original old review: This recipe literally saved me!  I needed to produce a sweet treat on a deadline.  I fell for a food blogger, and like every other time I have made a blog/Pinterest recipe....it was a miserable failure.  I know better than to stray from AllRecipes, because the reviews and suggestions make a good recipe great.  With two hours until my deadline I had two pans of multicolored blog-inspired garbage.  I decided to try these, and they were *awesome*!  I have never made chocolate chip/peanut butter frosting, but it was picture perfect. I make everything with parchment paper, so I easily lifted them out of the pan, cut them with a pizza wheel, and put them in candy papers for pretty presentation.  The taste-testing husband has already declared that I need to make more soon...for him.  I can't thank the poster and reviewers enough!

I will never go back to Reese's! I used baker's semisweet chocolate and grated it finely so it melted evenly - glad I got the warmer element on my stove for exactly this!

Made these for my boyfriend and he loved them! When he goes home to school, I always want to send him with something sweet to get him through the week. I was short on time and these were PERFECT. So easy to make, 4 ingredients, and they tasted good too. 

CHANGES I MADE: Instead of 1 cup of butter, I used a little more than 1/2 a cup. Seemed like way too much butter to me and my bars came out great. Still held together and they weren't overly-rich. I think the next time I make it though, I'm going to use natural peanut butter.

These were a hit at work! I made the following modifications: only 1.5 sticks of butter, 16 honey graham cracker sheets and almost 2 cups of semisweet chocolate chips. I also used Skippy natural chunky peanut butter. As others suggested, I chilled the crust for 15 minutes before pouring out the chocolate and I kept them in the fridge until it was time to eat them.

Amazing! I couldn't believe how easy these are to make and that they taste identical to the famous peanutbutter cup candies. I could tell when melting the chocolate that it was going to set up harder than I wanted so I added an extra tablespoon of peanutbutter, 1tbsp of butter and 2tbsp of half and half and the end result was perfect. As others have mentioned in their reviews, let the bottom layer chill at least 20min to prevent the chocolate from mixing into the peanutbutter. Next time I will be lining my pan with parchment paper so I can pull the whole thing out to cut. Cutting got a bit messy.

This was too sweet, and I LOVE anything peanut butter/chocolate.  Also, the base gets soft very quickly out of the refrigerator.  Probably will not make again.

I read a past review where natural peanut butter was used and unlike that review I would not recommend it. Something was lost flavour wise. I gave it an excellent rating as I'm sure with regular peanut butter it would be scrumptious. But with the natural peanut butter, it really took over and I'm sure changed the taste.

So just how do you type lip smacking noises anyway?  If I could it would be accurate for these bars!  I made them for my son to celebrate his first day of college.  They were a big hit with everyone!  I used candy melts in place of the chips because "someone" took to nibbling on my bag of chips I had planed for this!!! LOL  Worked just fine and was the only change made.  I chilled the bars prior to cutting but after attempting to slice the first row I let the pan sit for 30 minutes.  This prevented cracking beautifully and they sliced just as nicely as the recipe photo!  I also cut in to much smaller pieces as 12 servings is way to large a serving for us.  I got about 40, 1 inch or so, squares.  Just right for a grab and go bite!  Will definitely make again!

Very good. Definitely add more butter to ensure a solid crumb/peanut butter base. Chilling the base before pouring on the chocolate was an excellent suggestion, too.

I was very disappointed in these bars. It doesn't taste like Reese's, and believe me, I would know. The graham cracker crumbs ruin the texture, it was mealy and grainy. I'd much prefer the taste of buckeyes, you can probably make that recipe into a bar.

These are almost too rich!  I liked the appearance, but the texture was a little strange.  I think you have to not just crush your grahams, but make them into powder.  I'd try it again, but with changes.

These turned out great.  I agree they are better chilled, although mine didn't become mush at room temp.  I did not think it needed salt added to the peanut butter mixture.  I guess that depends on the pb you use.  Mine were not gritty either.  I turned th e graham crackers to near powder.  I also stuck the pb in with the butter I melted.  Mixing was easy.  I also used milk chocolate chips because I like them better.

The peanut butter layer never really did get hard enough to serve as "bars". I think maybe using margarine (the spreadable kind) was a bad idea. I think I will try this again using real butter, or stick margarine, because it does have a good flavor.

quick, easy, and delicious!

I would use a little less graham cracker crumb and a little more powdered sugar.

Regrigerate for about 30-45min, then cut into squares, then continue to refrigerate (if the chocolate hardens too much they are difficult to cut)

Oh my! My daughter's favorite candy is Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and she thought this dish was amazing. It is actually one of those dishes that get better the longer it sits, like the next day. My advice is to make sure you grind your graham crackers up into a very fine texture and make sure your pan is big enough, because these are better if they aren't super thick. They are very easy to make, inexpensive, look wonderful and are yummy. They would be a great recipe to make with the kids. Enjoy!

the cookie base is way too sweet. I halved the amount of powdered sugar, friends still find it too sweet. Next time I'd cut the sugar to 1/4-1/2 cup.

I halved the recipe and they still turned out great! A little rich, but the ratio of chocolate to peanut butter is perfect, and the consistency is creamy and delicious.

This is a great easy recipe for peanut butter bars. They aren't too rich or overly sweet. The crushed graham crackers give the peanut butter mixture a nice texture. I used creamy peanut butter. My husband loves peanut butter and he really liked these.

These turned out great. 
I'd recommend using "Milk Chocolate" chocolate chips rather than semi sweet. It gives it much more of a smoother taste and even balance. 
Keep this one for sure!

Only tweaks I made were to line the dish with wax paper to be able to have them come out cleanly and easily (made it much easier than the first batch when I did not) and I chilled the peanut butter layer for 30 minutes or so before putting on the chocolate layer.  Wife and son loved these!

Love this recipe!  Line your pan with wax or parchment paper before you begin allowing an inch or so to hang over the sides.  When you are ready to cut the bars, lift the entire dessert out of the pan by holding on to the paper liner.  It is SO much easier to cut if you take it out of the pan first.

This just tasted like eating a spoonful of peanut butter mixed with butter. Way too rich for me and that's surprising because I LOVE all things peanut butter and chocolate.

Something wrong with recipe!  I went to make it but got so confused because when you melt the chocolate for the top layer it says to melt it with the peanut butter, but you used the entire cup of peanut butter that was listed in the recipe in the first layer.  So was the bottom layer only supposed to use some, but not all, of the peanut butter?  Were you supposed to reserve some for the top layer?  There are so many good reviews but it doesn't make sense to me.

I read a lot of the Reviews & adjusted the recipe as followed: I only used 1 1/2 sticks of Butter & followed the rest of the bottom ingredients to make the crust. I DID put in the frig. for aprox 30 min. based on what others said.  I did also increase the chocolate to 2 cups of chips (you can also use "chunks") & 5 TBSP of PB melted together, I did this in a double boiler & then poured it over the "crust" mixture.  Then put back in the frig for another couple of hours. They ARE Fabulous! My entire family loved them, already getting requests to make them again! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Made these using half the butter. I filled 1 tbsp of filling per mini muffin cup and refrigerated for 20 minutes, then spooned 1/2 tbsp of chocolate layer on top of each. Just enough for 56 mini pb cups and they look great! I made these for xmas gift boxes.

I read tons of reviews and decided to test this out before I made it for a LARGE cookie exchange next week. The only small changes I made were 1. I melted the butter with the peanut butter in the bowl, 2. I put the butter/sugar/peanut mixture in the fridge for 30 min to set it up before I did the chocolate part. and finally 3. I added a smidge more peanut butter to the chocolate in the last part to increase the peanuty flavor. This recipe ROCKS! It set up beautifully...even though I doubled it! Easy. Quick. Perfect! Cookie Exchange, here I come!

I made these about a month ago and everyone loved them. I just made 2 batches of this recipe today to take to church this weekend. Only thing I do different is to use 1 1/2 cups of Splenda in place of 2 cups confectioners sugar, taste great and have received very high praise from my husband.

I'm not the kind of person to write a review when I've made a bunch of changes from the original recipe. I followed this recipe exactly, and it was very good, but it was a little soft. The bars couldn't be taken out of the fridge for more than five minutes or they'd melt. But they tasted delicious, everyone loved them.

Delicious, tasted very similar to a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.  Much more like a candy than a traditional cookie bar.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks!

These bars never last long in our household!  I use half the butter as well, and it comes out perfect.  My husband likes to say it's even better than a Reese's Cup; I love the crunch that goes along with it.  Good stuff!

Very yummy.  They are extreemly sweet so cut them small.  My picky hubby really liked them so it's a keeper.  Also, this makes a LOT of peanut butter squares.. next time I'll probably cut it in 1/2.

These are just wonderful!! Simple and quick to make and they sit in the fridge until temptation strikes.... we added some chopped peanuts to the base for extra crunch - a definite keeper! Thanks for sharing Nancy.

I brought these to a BBQ of mostly adults. As soon as they were served I was sought out, introduced to new people, and asked for my recipe. Very decadent. I think I'll try dark chocolate and cut the sugar a bit next time as they were very sweet -- but no one had any complaints. This recipe definitely serves more than 12 people.

ShielaRenee....I melt milk chocolate chips..without the peanut butter...you need to put them in the fridge for about half hour...when you see the shine start to go off the chocolate topping, take them out of fridge and cut them before they harden...hope this helps..been making these for years and they are a fave at our house...

This is a great recipe that takes alterations easily. I didnt have graham crackers so i used vanilla wafers (yummy!), real butter, creamy peanut butter, and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. i was worried about my chocolate not melting correctly but i tossed in a tbsp of butter and it was perfect:) will definitely make again:)

Seemed like they should be refrigerated but they taste much better at room temp, the peanut butter layer is creamier that way.

I have made these a few times. They have turned out best when I have ran the graham crackers through the blender and when I have used creamy peanut butter when mixing p.b. into the melted chocolate. I love using crunchy p.b. in the base of the dessert. I have also used real butter and margarine. Both have worked fine. The butter solidifies a little easier and quicker. A favorite in our family!

These were great!!! I used 2 8x8 pans. I started with organic PB that doesnt have sugar so I added a little more powdered sugar to the crust. I found the chocolate and organic PB mixture hard to spread, it was very thick! The other pan, I used Jiffy PB and I had no problem, the mixture spread nicely. Moral of the story, use the full fat, full sugar PB! They both tasted great but the Jiffy pan was easier to make.

These were really good, but mine were much thinner than pictured. I made everything as listed except I used 3/4 cup butter instead of 1 stick. I did make them in a 9x13 as listed. Not sure why mine were so thin. They are really rich though, so being thinner is not all that bad.

Using what I had in my pantry, I used reduced-fat peanut butter, 14 (~1 cup) reduced-fat graham crackers, margarine, and semi-sweet baking chocolate squares.  Per the recommendation of another reviewer, I used my food processor to finely grind up the graham crackers for a good consistency in the bars.  Overall, I love how easy these were to make, and they were a hit with the family.

OMG these are delicious! i was looking for something that was similar to Reeses as they are quite difficult to get hold of in the uk, and these were spot on! simple to make and tasted great, they are very sweet though but thats fine for me ;) have made these many times now and i am sure they will stay a firm favourite in our house.

Made with Skippy Natural Peanut Butter, that is what I had.  These came out great!  Wish I had this recipe around Christmas.  I would have made candy with these.  Better than a Reese Peanut Butter Cup!!!!  Will be a staple in our house too!

I liked it but it was a bit crumbly for me. I would use less graham cracker next time. Also, I added vanilla wafers. YUMMY

This was absolutely simple. Great for hands-on kids who want to help. I used name brand peanut butter as I've never had a cookie/bar recipe turn out with store brand/cheap peanut butter. These absolutely taste like Reese's. Or, so my husband tells me. He just likes it because it's bigger than those little cups. For him, bigger is always better.

Oh, this is bad. I hate peanut butter, but somehow, I flippin' LOVE these things. Made them for lunchbox treats around here, yet I just had to resist eating half the pan by myself. I used 10 tablespoons of butter (just over 1 stick) and used an extra few tablespoons of peanut butter. I also added 1 tsp. vanilla extract.. definitely recommend this. I wasn't crazy about the topping, so next time I think I'll just melt the chocolate with a few tablespoons of butter instead.

After reading other reveiws, I changed some things. I didn't want a super sweet,greasy candy,so I used 1/2 a stick of butter,and 1 cup of sugar. I left everything eles the same as written. I also microwaved the crust ing for 30 second to help melt the PB since I used such little butter,and that made everything mix very well! This recipe is great!! Its not overly sweet nor greasy due to my modifications,and I LOVE it!! Its just like a resess(sp) cup!! And I'm amazed at the clean cut!! I thought it would be like cutting a cheesecake! Nice recipe!

I made these for my husband for our anniversary and he loved them, thought they were better than a peanut butter cup!  Very rich, I halved the recipe to fit in an 8x8, and cut it in small pieces.

I used 3/4 C. Butter (Instead of 1 C) & 1 3/4 C. Hershey's Mini Kisses Baking Chips (Instead of 1 & 1/2 C. Semisweet Baking Chips).  I had a hard time smoothing out the peanut butter mixture, so I took a piece of parchment paper, placed it over the mixture & pushed down & smoothed it out.  As I was melthing the chocolate over the saucepan, I put the peanut butter mixture in the freezer for about 5 min.  After I poured the chocolate on top, I let it sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes until it set.  Then I cut it into squares & popped it back in the freezer for about 10 min.  Then I scooped the squares out & enjoyed!  It was a BIG hit.  My mom loves Reese's PB Cups, but doesn't like sweets, and she ate about 4-5 squares herself!!

We agree these are better than Reese's.  I doubled the recipe and these were very thick- delicious!  I also reduced the butter by 1/4 and still was great but figured could've just threw it all in since the calories are crazy-high no matter what.

Very easy recipe & tasty!!! Made these for hubby's lunch bucket. I worried that possibly they would "melt" but they didn't. Held shape & consistency very well. Will be making this again & often.

I made these yesterday morning. They were extremely easy to put together. I also put mine in the fridge to set up. No problems with the two layers sticking together. The taste is very good. My only issue with these was the texture of the bottom layer. I was thinking it would be smooth and melt in your mouth. Very good overall! Will make again.

Very rich, but delicious! I've made these many times already. The longer you process the graham crackers into dust, the more they taste like Reese's. I like a tiny bit of crunch, so the best combo for me has been to put crunchy peanut butter in the bottom part and only semi-pulverize the grahams, but I still use smooth peanut butter for the topping. Fabulous! Cut them small; it'll make the pan go farther before you're forced to make another batch, and it'll save you from a stomach ache (although that jumbo-size bar was worth it!).

These bars are probably the best no bake cookie/bar that I've ever eaten. They are so easy to make, and taste just like a peanut butter cup! My whole family loved them. I cut the butter down to 1 1/2 sticks, and they turned out beautifully. I will be making these often! Thanks for a perfectly delicious recipe!

Yum.  I cut the amount of butter in half (per Jennifer C-thank you) and used Smart Balance instead.  Maybe because the Smart Balance has more water than butter, mine weren't crumbly even with less.  These remind me of the Buckeyes (peanut butter balls) my mom makes every Christmas, but with SO much less work.  I really like dark chocolate and may use it next time, but it's so good as written.

Not sure if I did something wrong but we all found these to be awfully sweet and the peanut butter portion a bit on the gritty side from the graham cracker crumbs.  Not sure if I will make these again or not.

oh my goodness these are good.  i have been looking at this recipe for awhile, but finally got around to making it today.  i used 1/2c butter as some of the other reviewers suggusted and they turned out great.  my only complaints are that one side of the pan has more chocolate on top because of my slanted countertops, but that's not the recipes fault! and it makes the one side of pan that much better!

I thought these were pretty good, but I made them for my boyfriend and he barely touched them. My only complaint was that they didn't stay hard after they warmed up, which I expected they would. Good, but I probably won't bother making again. Thanks :)

Very yummy! Great for when you need a "peanut butter cup fix." My dad said they taste just like the store bought candy, except it's cheaper to make! The PB texture came out really smooth even though it looked "rough" when I poured it in the pan. I lined the pan with wax paper and stuck the pan with the PB mixture in the freezer while I melted the chocolate. After I put on the choc. mixture I stuck it back in the freezer for 30 mins. and then took it out and cut it with a pizza cutter and stuck it back in the freezer. It set-up nicely and was ready to eat in no time! I put the rest of bars in a container in the fridge.

WOW is all I can say!  These were so easy to make and taste just like peanut butter cups, which I love.  My 6 year old and 4 year old helped out.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the following changes: 1)I used Honey Made whole graham crackers chopped finely in my food processor.  2) I took the advice of another reviewer and "melted" the peanut butter with the butter.  The results were fantastic!  If you like chocolate and peanut butter, then you will love these.  Thanks for the post.

A quick, no-bake recipe that everyone loves - perfect!  They are very sweet, so I usually cut a 9x13 pan into 24 squares.

This recipe was very good - just not what I was expecting. I thought that the base would turn into more of a substantial crust with all the graham cracker crumbs; our bars got a bit melty served at room temperature. Someone even asked me if the base was straight peanut butter. Next time I'll make a graham cracker crust and then add the peanut butter and chocolate layers. Great flavor - they do taste just like Reese's peanut butter cups!

This tasted very good! Next time i make it I will make an extra 1 1/2 cups of graham cracker crust and pour it on the bottom of the dish before pouring the graham cracker/butter/ and peanut butter mixter because it needs something solid to hold while eating it. Maybe if I mix it w/ some butter, but not all the other stuff it will work. Also 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips is too much! I'll use 1 1/4 cup next time and I also mixed it with 1/4 cup milk and a dash of butter because simply melting chocolate does not make it poour and coat eell. It has to be mixed w/ a liquid and what I did worked perfectly!

One of my favourite dessert recipes!! It's super easy and tastes just like Reese's peanut butter cups! Just make sure you don't leave the bars in the fridge too long before cutting them. I've done that before and the chocolate separated from the peanut butter base!

I loved this recipe and am addicted to these! I'm allergic to dairy so I used Earth Balance butter substitute and it came out great. I also used about half the amount of chocolate because the chocolate was just too much the first time I made them. Overall loved them, thank you for sharing the recipe!

Loved the TASTE... but do not use store-bought graham crumbs. WAY too grainy. Blend your own graham cracker crumbs in a blender until it is a fine powder.

Mmmm! Almost too good. Note: peanut butter, especially natural, may differ in the oil content and need an adjustment in the butter/margarine ratio. As mentioned in other reviews, be sure to pulverize the graham crackers to a fine powder for the best texture. I find it easiest to melt the butter/margarine and peanut butter together to blend thoroughly and then add the mixed dry ingredients. My adjustments from the original recipe for personal preference include cutting the butter/margarine to 3/4 cup; cutting the confectioners sugar to 1 1/2 cups; increasing the peanut butter to 1 1/4 cup. I triple the base recipe and use 1 1/2 X of the top layer and make these in a 15-1/2” X 10-1/2” cookie pan, and then get them out of the house as soon as possible! I said they are good?. I also use parchment paper to line the cookie sheet and another piece on top of it and then roll it to get the base as smooth as possible, chill the base before spreading the top layer, chill again and then cut into squares. Keep these goodies refrigerated prior to serving.

Absolutely love this recipe!  We have made it many times and I have found that if i use sticks of real butter and use it soft (not melted), the bottom firms up much better.  When I used margarine, the bottom stayed mushy. Also, cool the peanut butter layer for a bit before you spread on the chocolate.

The recipe itself was absolutely delicious. The only problem I had was after I had put the pan in the fridge to set, I tried cutting them into bars but they wouldn't come out in one piece. I honestly don't care because they tasted so good, but the presentation wasn't as good as it could of been. Maybe next time I'll try greasing the pan first.

I make these with rice crispier ground up instead of graham crackers for a gluten free option.  Use earth balance butter substitute for an equally delicious vegan gluten free option:)

This is my go-to recipe when I need to bring a dish to a get together or work pot-luck. They are ALWAYS a HUGE hit and people ask me for the recipe every time. They are pretty addictive though so my only warning is that you will eat a LOT of these ;)

If you like peanut butter or buckeye balls, this is a great, easy recipe to make. I followed previous suggestions, cutting butter to 1 1/2 sticks, melting it with peanut butter before mixing with graham crackers and powdered sugar. I placed in freezer for 30 minutes to chill. I also recommend cutting the whole pan when removing from refrigerator/freezer. YUM!

I'm making these for the first time but I decided to go rougue and add 1/2 c of crushed rice crispies to the 1 1/2 c. of graham crumbs and add a bit of a crunch...the batter was good...  ;)... I'm sure they won't go to waste.... Wish me luck!

Very yummy. Only thing I would change is make these in a smaller pan for a thicker bar or double the recipe.

This is a family favorite for sure! I use milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet chips.  I have also substituted the graham crackers with shortbread cookies.

I liked the recipe and it tasted great but 1 1/2 cups of chocolate chips sadly weren't enough. I still loved them though.

Everyone loved it! I did as others suggested:1&1/2 sticks butter melted with peanut butter on the stove top, 1&1/2 cups confectioner sugar mixed with 2&1/2 cups crushed graham crackers in kitchen aid, then poured butter mix into kitchen aid; also placed bottom layer in refridge while melted choco chips for topping. I used microwave to melt 2 cups choc chips in glass bowl (30 second intervals on high -- took about 90 seconds total) then mixed in peanut butter. spread nicely and no issues with the layers not adhering to each other. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

My husband has severe nut allergies, so I made the recipe using WowButter instead of peanut butter.  WowButter is a roasted soy butter that is the closest thing to peanut butter that I've found.  Of course to me, the bars didn't taste exactly like a peanut butter bar should, but they were still very good.  My husband enjoyed them too!  So if you need an allergy friendly dessert for an event or your peanut-free schools, this recipe tastes great with WowButter.

These are much like my peanut butter eggs I make.  some times I just make peanut butter cups.  I do change the gram cracker out with butter crackers (Ritz) that are not so sweet.  Line your pan with plastic wrap it makes clean up a breeze.

Yes, made these last nite, and they are wonderful...taste just like a reese cup :) no kidding....but when I make them again, I would do a couple of things different...I would definitely line the pan with either wax paper or parchment paper, and then remove it all and put on counter to cut.....it was hard to cut in the pan, and get it out.....and I would pour in a thin layer of chocolate in the pan first, and put in fridge for about 15 mins. then pour the peanut butter mixture over that, then back in fridge for about 15 mins. then take out and add the rest of the chocolate and spread on top....as I found the top chocolate a bit too thick, so by putting a thin layer on the bottom first, then the top would be perfect and less of a mess eating it.....and you definitely have to leave it in the fridge once you cut it in squares.... but it is well worth making.....

Very good! I remember getting these in school For dessert with lunches so I decided to make them and I was very pleased because these are MUCH better. I substituted unsweetened bakers chocolate so the conversion was fun and was a great math lesson for my 9 year old as well. I recommend cooling for more than an hour for a nice firm set. Overnight is good.

I really like this recipe, its simple, quick and yummo. i refrigerated the crust part for about 30 min and used a whole bag of chips rather than the 1 1/2 cups which resulted in a thicker layer on top. also i used chunky peanut butter cuz it was what i had on hand, i think actually they turned out better than they would have if i had used smooth because there's now chunks of peanuts in the bars and in the chocolate.

I must confess I was tempted to give this recipe 2 stars...I hate it when this happens--everyone loves it but me.  I just don't get it---why not just buy a peanut butter cup?  Yes, it's a slightly different texture because of the graham...but still...If I'm going to cook, I want it to taste original.  That didn't happen here.

Me and my kids loved this. We devoured them. Next time though just for my own tastes I'd only put 2 tbsp peanut butter in when melting the chocolate, to give the chocolate more of a chocolate flavor instead of peanut butter overpowering it, since there's definitely enough peanut butter flavor in the rest of the bar. Also, you could definitely get away with using less butter. About 1 1/2 sticks. I froze the bottom peanut butter mixture in the pan for about 3 minutes while the chocolate was melting so by the time I put the chocolate on it didn't mix in with the bottom part.

This DOES taste like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups!  It's probably one of the best desserts I've made, and it's so easy.  The hardest part was cleaning up the dishes afterwards with melted chocolate and peanut butter all over them.  Everything else was a breeze!

I used 1 package of graham crackers and 1 1/2 sticks of butter, as suggested by another reviewer.  I believe this made the crust more 'crusty' and less creamy, which was the consistency I was looking for.  I wasn't too meticulous about crushing the graham.  I just put them into a zip baggie and went to town crushing it with a rolling pin.  Even though the chunks weren't all the same size, that really didn't bother me in the end.  Refrigerating the final dish is a must.  I was nervous about using semi-sweet chocolate instead of milk, but when served cold, it was the perfect pairing.  Milk chocolate would have been overkill.  This dessert is very rich, very delicious, and a definite keeper!

These are SHUT THE FRONT DOOR good! My BF loves peanut butter and I decided to surprise him with these little cuties for dessert yesterday. He said they were little bites of heaven. Based on the suggestions I: used 1.5 sticks of butter, melted the cup of PB with the butter, refridgerated the crust for about 20-30 minutes before pouring in chocolate mixture, let pan cool in fridge for 45 minutes before cutting into bite size pieces and then cooled another 30 minutes before serving. What I meant to do, and didn't, was use the parchment paper; some of my crust broke (minor pieces) and think using the parchment will help next time. When I cut into the chocolate, I did have a little breakage but once I used a firm smooth cut with a super sharp knife it went fine. Will be using this recipe at many gatherings to come. Thank you Nancy!

I make these for group gatherings (or I would eat the whole pan myself!!) I add chopped nuts to the bottom layer. Also, I line the pan with aluminum foil so they can be lifted from the pan, then they are easier to cut into bars.

When I made this I didn't have any graham crackers. I only had nilla wafers on hand so I used 2 cups crushed along with the rest of the original ingredients and it turned out FABULOUS I could have eaten the peanut butter mixture alone it was that good. Great recipe. For the future I think I will use a 9 x 11 pan because I would like to have just a little bit thicker peanut butter mixture but not an 8x8 because that's too thick. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

These were so easy to make and SO yummy!  I followed the recipe exactly.  However, I layered wax paper in my cookie sheet (first, sprinkle a little water or spray the pan with Pam so the wax paper doesn't move around when spreading the mixture) before spreading the yummy mixture to cool.  After they cooled, I lifted out the wax paper filled with yumminess and it was super easy to cut and transfer to a pretty serving platter! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I loved these and they work great for peanut butter cups as well.  If I make them in bar fashion I only use about 1 1/2 sticks of butter.  I always line the pan so I can lift them out for cutting.  I cool the peanut butter mixture about 20 min. then frost them with the chocolate and wait about another 20 min. and cut them so the choc. doesn't crack.

Very tasty, no bake bar! Go ahead and splurge for the already crumbled graham crumbs in the store...it's worth it. Also before putting in fridge, sprinkle tops lightly with graham cracker crumbs for a gourmet look.

These taste like chocolate covered butter. I cut the butter to a stick and a half!
The chocolate part turned out great. The next time I make these, I will increase the peanut butter amount and use a stick of butter or less.
(I used no-stir natural peanut butter and it worked great!)

My son told me about an invitation to go somewhere about an hour before he had to be there - with a dessert in hand. I whipped this up in no time, told the boys to set it in the fridge until they were ready to have dessert, and it was a hit with everyone. Simple, quick, delicious. Fabulous! The next time I made them, I didn't have graham crackers, so I used the buttery round crackers I did have. Still amazing.

Awesome recipe! I have to keep making them for a constant supply for my 71 year old mother! I did increase the PB to
1 1/2 cups for more flavor. I would recomend letting them sit for a day (like that's going to happen!) to let the graham cracker crumbs absorb some moisture, but this is like having a whole pan of Reese's peanut butter cups! Yummmmm!

I'm not very fond of this recipe. I think it was extremely sweet; the amount of sugar called for was too much. I also think the peanut butter-chocolate combination used here was dense and needed something to lighten the proportions.

These were a big hit at a party I hosted recently. Everyone raved about how they tasted like big Reeses PB cups and asked me for the recipe. The other desserts on the table got overlooked next to these. 
I only had unsalted butter on hand when I made these and next time I will be sure to use salted. I could tell something was missing.
Thanks for sharing a great recipe, Nancy!

I love these. There is not a thing to change about them. I could eat the whole pan myself but I have 3 boys so they got most of them. This is definately a keeper and I will make over and over. Quick, easy and delicious.

These are very easy to make. I had a little bit of a hard time getting them out of the pan since they were so thick and heavy. Cut them into small pieces as they are very heavy and you only need a couple bites.

The taste is good and very reminiscent of a Reese's, but these bars almost too rich to eat. Our family couldn't eat more than one small serving each. The graham crackers seem a bit gritty even when they are finely crushed. I've made other recipes where the PB is melted in with the butter, which makes the crumbs soften and become creamy.

These were a BIG hit! I wish I had taken a picture, they turned out perfect! I did add 1 1/3 cup of peanut butter vs 1 cup, to have more of a peanut butter taste. People asked for the recipe.
I was told the bars took them back to high school cafeteria days, and that their butt and thighs even thanked me!

These are just like the ones my mom used to make during Christmas when I was younger! Yum! If your base seems too wet you can always add more graham cracker crumbs to thicken it up.

It tastes great, however the peanut butter part of this recipe is too wet and did not set very well.  I would recommend using half the amount of butter that the recipe call for.

I took these to a fundraiser and got great reviews.  I did make a small change, I added a quarter of a cup of flour to the crust and baked at 375 for about 10 minutes, then cooled and completed the chocolate layer.   They set up well without refrigeration with this change.

My family went crazy for this!  I made them for my husbands birthday and within days he was begging for me to make it again.  I made it again with some tweaks and added semisweet chocolate chips to the peanut butter/graham cracker base and used white chocolate with 3 tbs. peanut butter for top.  Both my husband and step daughter were disappointed and wanted the "original" The next week I made it again...just like exactly like the recipe with no modifications and they went crazy again.  Even this weekend I pulled a few leftover pieces out of the freezer and my sleep over Thanksgiving guests went crazy again!  Everyone thinks they taste like Reese's cups.  I think they are OK...but everyone else goes nuts for these.

Delicious! I used only 1/2 Cup butter, I think 1 Cup would have made them too greasy. I also had graham crackers on hand that I wanted to get rid of, so I just crushed them. It gave the bars I nice crunchy texture. Super easy and great for potlucks or bake sale.

Like another reviewer said, make sure the graham crackers are pulverized otherwise they will give a chunky texture.  I used part natural peanut butter and part Jif and only 1.5 sticks of butter.  Still had good flavor.  I also pre-cut them 10 minutes into the refrigeration process.

This is SOOOOO good. We loved this. The peanut-buttery crust reminds me of a Butterfinger candy bar. The only thing I would do differently (although, hubby said it's grand as is!) is, I would take it out of the fridge 10 minute before serving so the chocolate softens just  a tad before cutting. SOOOO good (did I already say that??)!!!

Soooo good!  I made it with 1 1/2 cups unsalted butter as suggested by others.  Used milk chocolate chips (Callebaut - the best).   I will definitely make these again, so many compliments.  They are gooey but stay firm in the refrigerator.

Was very good! I made it as written and think I agree that it may have a bit too much butter and powdered sugar originally. Will cut back on them slightly, but overall very rich and tasty!

Yummo!  I used dark chocolate chips for the top and reduced the butter to only 1 1/2 sticks.  Fantastic recipe, thanks!

These were wonderful! It's become one of my favorite recipes. They are so quick and easy. The only problem I had was they were runny, so "pressing" them into the bottom of a pan wasn't going to happen, it's more like spreading. Next time I will try using less butter as suggested by another reviewer. I also noticed that for me butter works better than margarine and I used Milk Chocolate. Like others, I kept them in the refrigerator.

yum yum I made these today using 3/4 cup of butter because I didn't have enough butter and it still tasted delicious! I also used 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate and 1/2 cup of bittersweet because I ran out of semi sweet. It was so good. I made bars and a few in mini cups and it turned out so cute so I think next time I will make it in the mini cups for presentation and it's easier to eat.

a.ma.zing.  I got rave reviews.  People thought I was so talented.  But this recipe is so easy that a monkey could make these treats, which I've seen referred to as Buckeyes.  I followed the instructions pretty much verbatim, except that I melted the butter and peanut butter together so that they'd be easier to mix with the other ingredients.  Melt in your mouth goodness!

I made these for my niece's bridal shower this past sunday and they turned out great.  None left at the end of the party and a few asking for the recipe.  I had a little bit of trouble getting them out of the pan...especially those first few...if you have a springform pan..(which i do have, but didn't think of it until after), i think it would be a big help to use one.

I would give it 4 stars based on my  modifications but thought it unfair given that I didn' t follow the instructions exactly. I can see how they would be terrific with peanut butter and they were super easy to make!

I have a peanut-allergic child so I used sunbutter (sunflower seed butter, available at Trader Joe's and similar stores) instead. The flavor is a lot more subtle, so next time I'd increase the sunbutter and/or decrease the chocolate (scandalous!). Even with the proportions as written, mine did not firm up until I put it in the freezer for about 20 minutes. After that I kept it in the fridge and it was fine. I ate about half of it myself :(

Thanks for an easy and yummy recipe!

Hey guess what? No graham crackers?  I used plain - PLAIN, NOT Italian, breadcrumbs and it worked just as well.  Great recipe for summer! I also had some leftover chips from doing chocolate dipped strawberries, and used that as my chocolate and it worked great. I used an 8 x8 square pan, because I like the peanut butter part a lot.  Thanks for the recipe. It's a hit!

I admit I'm usually a recipe "tweaker",  but I followed this ALMOST to a "T".  I used a little less sugar (not sure how much, no more than 1/4 cup difference) and possibly slightly more graham.  And I used more chocolate chips b/c it looked too light to me (I used Ghiradelli Milk Chocolate chips instead of semisweet, so that could be why - used the full bag, which was 1/4-1/2 cup more than called for).  Used a smaller dish so it just meant it was thicker. 

This was DELICIOUS!!!  Everyone loved it and it was ridiculously fast.  I whipped it up while preparing the BBQ stuff, let it stiffen in the fridge while we ate, and even everyone who was "full" from dinner just "had" to have one... then one more.  The texture added by the graham crackers is genius!  Really does taste like Reese's.  My toddler who is over-skinny and we try to get peanut butter more often gobbled this up saying MMMM, MMMMM!!!!!!.

So, had to give it 5 stars b/c perfect as-is!  YUM.

OH, PS - I used a smidge less butter b/c I used natural PB that was a little runnier.  So, if you're using natural and you're worried it's too oily, just cut the butter back some and the extra peanut oil will basically take its place.

The taste was excellent but the graham crackers gives it a weird texture, even though I used a food processor to grind them up.  Not quite the recipe I was looking for but not bad either.

SO YUMMY! I made these last night, and they are fantastic! I followed a couple other reviewers suggestions of using only 1 1/2 sticks of butter, and chilling the bottom layer for 15 minutes before adding the top layer. Worked great. I'm keeping these in the fridge since its hot out. My 3 year old had fun making them with me and my husband LOVES them (he is a peanut butter cup fanatic). I even ate one for breakfast :) I am going to make these A LOT!

These are pretty yummy, but they didn't taste like a reese's peanut butter cup to me.  Still good thought.  Took them to a church potluck and there were none left.  An entire pan may be too much unless you plan to share.  Make sure your graham crackers are finely crushed unless you like chunks in your bars.  Keep refridgerated until ready to eat.

These are very good and the texture is like Reeses Cups.  But I thought the chocolate overpowered the peanut butter.  I would prefer more of a peanut butter taste.  I halved the recipe and put it in an 8x8 pan but followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I think I'll cut back on the chocolate topping.  As some reviewers noted, it is a thin layer but still overpowering, at least for me.

My husband and I were craving chocolate, but were out of several key ingredients for our old stand-by, including baking powder and brown sugar.  I did a quick search on All Recipes, and found this recipe.  It sounded like it would hit the spot, and I had everything on hand to make it, so we whipped up a batch.  Very easy to make, quick to throw together . . . the hardest part was waiting the full hour till it had set in the fridge!  Oh my!  They are fabulous!  As other reviewers stated, they really do taste like reese's cups!  Yum!  I made the recipe as stated.  I think the only minor change I would make would be to do a full two cups of chocolate chips.  The layer of chocolate on top of my peanut butter bars is pretty thin, and I made them in a 9 x 13 pan as the recipe calls for.  But that's really a matter of preference.  These peanut butter bars are delicious even if the layer of chocolate on top is a little thin!  These will definitely be made over and over again!

I made these for our Easter family gathering and used a metal egg-shaped cookie cutter to keep with the Easter theme. (Of course we just HAD to keep the left-over pieces from the cutouts at home!) They were a huge hit!

These are so delicious and VERY easy to make!!! I reduced the butter to 3/4 cups and they taste exactly the same (with slightly less fat). I let these bars chill for 15 minutes and then cut them into squares. The next morning, they were very easy to cut and remove from the baking pan. I will definitely make these again! Great recipe!

These are SO GOOD! I used 3/4 of the butter as another reviewer suggested. These are really addicting and delicious!

I LOVED this recipe, but gave 4 stars because of the modifications I made to make it allegedly more healthy.
1. Used 1 stick Promise spread, 1 stick unsalted butter.
2. Used 2c ground Fiber One cereal instead of graham cracker crumbs.
3. Used Splenda instead of confectioners' sugar (realize the texture/taste will be a bit off).
4. Used 2c NATURAL peanut butter, and hence, like other reviewers, the mixture was very runny, so chilled for ~1h before adding chocolate.  (Would have frozen prior but there is NO room in my freezer!)
5. Also, for topping, used a whole bag of chocolate chips, minus the several that I "tested", 1/4c natural PB.

It is DY-NO-MITE!

yummy! I halved the recipe and made it in a loaf pan, I halved the butter and replaced it with more peanut butter, for the frosting I used 1/4 cup butter melted with 1/4 cup cocoa, 2/3 cup icing sugar and a little milk until spreadable.

very tasty and easy to make.  Great way to use up broken or stale graham crackers.  I went ahead and greased the pan and they came out perfectly.  The peanut butter part was quite runny, but solidified when cooled.

Excellent recipe!  I tend to not have all of the specified ingredients (no graham crackers/some butter) on hand, so I work with what I have.  I find that almost any crushed up cookie (leftover trefoils, Anna's ginger thins, etc) work very well!  I've used as little as approx. 3 oz (3/4 stick) of butter and it still turns out tasting amazing.  Sometimes a little crumbly, but it works!  You will not be disappointed.  Oh yeah - and it is very quick and easy.

I followed this recipe exactly and the peanut butter bars came out great.  I don't think I got the graham crackers fine enough so there is a coarser texture to the bars than I would have thought.  There was also not a strong enough peanut butter flavor for me.  Lots of reviews stated these were like/better than reese's peanut butter cups, and I didn't think so.  I would make them again and see if I could get the filling texture to be smoother and richer in peanut butter flavor.
Overall a great, quick dessert.  I loved the flavor combination.

These are really good and so easy to make! My boyfriend couldn't get enough of them! He practically ate the entire thing and made me give him the recipe so he could make them for himself too. I've made these a couple of times, and everyone I have shared them with has loved them. These are definitely a hit!

Yum! These taste just like peanut butter balls I used to have when I was a kid. Substituted 2 cups crushed rice krispy cereal for the graham crackers to cut the sweetness a little.  Also used 3/4 cup butter as suggested by other reviewers.  My 3-yr old can't get enough of them!

Just like other reviewers mentioned, this was lacking in some serious peanut butter taste.  The "filling" was too sweet, but the consistency was great.  Next time, I will experiment a bit and try to decrease the powdered sugar and increase the peanut butter.  I love this idea, but it definitely needs tweaking. Oh and for easy cutting (per other's suggestions), I covered and let chill for 15 minutes, cut, then wrapped and let chill more.  If you let chill longer than that, the chocolate topping solidifies and as you cut, it will break and not have a clean line on top.

Really great cookie bar.  The pan was gone in one day in our 7 person household. I made the graham cracker mixture entirely in the food processor and melted the chocolate/peanut butter mixuture in the microwave so my prep time was less than 10 minutes.  I accidently bought milk chocolate chips.  It turned out to be a happy accident, since I'm sure it produced a more classic peanut butter cup flavor.  The only problem was getting the bars to come out of the pan.  Thinking about setting them on a heating pad for a few minutes to warm just the bottom long enough to allow them to release from the pan, the next time I make them... and there will be a next time!

I found these bland as written. I guess I expected a more intense peanut butter flavor.  I used jif creamy, and the one cup of butter. It was far too much butter, since it doesn't add much flavor. The graham crackers also diluted the peanut flavor.   Of course, the whole business being cold seemed to make it less intense.   Don't get me wrong, they weren't bad. They were just less intense than I thought they were going to be.  They were definitely easy to make and didn't require cooking, which was good. But after the peanut butter cup description I was hoping for better.

Super rich and sweet, tastes better than a peanut butter cup. I think I'll go less on the sugar next time, they were overly sweet. I'll probably halve the recipe too, it makes a lot.

Too much butter!  This was yummy and rich but the crust part was more like peanut butter mush than a 'bar'.  In future tries at this recipe, I'm going to halve the butter or at least cut out 1/2 cup of it.  Other than that, its an easy, party pleasing recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

My husband will never say that any PB bars are better than his mom's...but these came close. I used non-chunky peanut butter and topped the finished product with chopped Reese's PB Cups...he loved 'em and so did everyone at work. Its a keeper.

These are the most amazingly easy and drool-inducing little treats ever! I only used about a stick and a quarter of butter and it still came out fantastic, and way better for you than two sticks of butter. Do place the graham cracker crust in the fridge for a few minutes while you are melting the chocolate, it holds up better once you start spreading on the chocolate. Definitely do what one reviewer suggested and cut the bars about 10 minutes after you started to let them chill, its so much easier than doing it when the chocolate has hardened. (Besides, the knife makes pretty swirly patterns in the chocolate when you do this!) Is a favorite treat of friends and co-workers at the holidays or for pot lucks.

Better than a p-nut butter cup! I did make a couple changes. I added crushed pecans to my graham crackers. Also i prefer milk chocolate to semi-sweet so i used milk chocolate chips. Also made a batch in mini cupcake liners in my mini muffin pan.

These were very good! Very sweet, I will probably try a little less sugar next time. I just smashed grahams to make crumbs which made it more fun fo my helper! I used only 1 stick of butter (1/2 cup) and they turned out fine....except the first one out of the pan crumbled so I had to eat it :)  All the rest were perfect!

These are so good it's insane. They start to taste even yummier a day, 2 days, 3 days later. Great if you need to make a tasty dessert a few days before company or an event. Even after a few days they still look pretty and are easier to cut, and retain their shape. I made exactly how the recipe called, then the second time I added more chocolate, and cut back on the powdered sugar- still just as fantastic. Kids love them too. I have also made this using almond butter instead of peanut butter, they are good, but not as sinful and decadent tasting.

Very good. Very sweet. I followed other reviewers' suggestions and cut the butter to 3/4 cup. That seemed to be the perfect amount. I also chilled the peanut butter base before spreading the chocolate. The texture is a little bit different than a Reese's pb cup, but the taste is spot-on. Mmmmm....

I love this recipe!  I've made it a bazillion times, and it seems that once I make it everyone wants me to make it for their parties too...  I sometimes make the bars, cut them, and freeze them in a container separating the layers with wax paper.  They thaw perfectly!  The only issue I've ever had is that the layers separate when cutting or serving, and you end up having to hold the layers together when you're eating it (which is not a big deal).  Has anyone else had this happen, and did you find a way to fix it?

Everyone was right- this has too much butter as written. Very greasy and takes away from the peanut butter flavor. With less butter this would be 5 stars, and many people are giving it 5 stars after they modified it. Do yourself a favor and cut back on the butter.

Yummy!  As per other reviewers, I cut the margarine to 3/4 cup, and added 1/4 cup peanut butter, and the base held together well.  I think another time I will use a better quality chocolate - I agree with other posters that the semi-sweet chips just don't do it justice.  You want good quality ingredients in this!

Wonderful! I love what the graham cracker crumbs do for this. Gave the PB layer an interesting twist. So simple to make, an excellent recipe for the children to help with making. The only changes i made was to cut the recipe in half, just to keep myself and hubby from eating so much. Thank you for sharing. I don't think i've had a pb bar recipe like this before.

These were easy to make (although GREASE the pan, I didn't and they pb kept sticking to the pan and separating from the chocolate) although they weren't that amazing. Didn't taste as good as Reese's. Overall, not impressed, will not make again.

oh lord, these are so good! just like a reeses! the graham cracker crumbs give it just the right texture too. i think you could get away with a little less butter, because these are seriously rich, but they definitely deserve 5 stars. hubby couldn't stop eating them!

Excellent and easy recipe.  I used organic PB (and about 1/2 cup more than called for and added it to the butter to melt-really helped), and only 1 1/2 sticks of butter (didn't miss it).  I thought when mixing the crust I should have gone with the full amount of butter, but it came together and held up very nicely.  Great recipe-my hips thank you!

I make these every year for the holiday season. This recipe is much better than some out there because it uses less powdered sugar so it's less crumbly and sweet. I always line my pan with wax paper only to make it easier to pull out and cut up. Or using a silicone pan works really well too.

So easy, so elegant. The texture looks a bit odd when you just have the peanut butter in the pan, but don't worry. Cool the PB or else it may mix together. I marbled in some white chocolate, too, just to elevate it a little - it looked very pretty.

Very easy, very tasty.  The bottom layer crumbled too readily and was just a bit granular textured, but really a very good dessert for the negligible effort that goes into making it.

Made this for work and received rave reviews even from the pickiest eaters.  Truly fills a 9x13 generously.  Adding the PB to the chocolate chips works well.  Once I had the bottom layer in the pan I put it in the freezer to set while melting the chips and PB mixture.  Once cool, then added the melted topping and back in the freezer until set.  Such a glossy finish to the chocolate.  GREAT RECIPE

We made these 2x this weekend. The first time i only use 1.5 sticks of butter and didn't get the choc. top put on right away. We thought they were dry. The next batch we made exact as recipe said. They need something, maybe a litte layer of Peanut butter between the bottom & top layer ?  They were ok. Easy to make. The kids had fun making and eating them.

I made these last night, and my boys LOVED them. The hubby ate so many, and my one year old nibbled on one. My advice is to cut them small, they are seriously rich. Using 1.5 sticks of butter is fine...dont use the full amount, its too much, and will make them greasy. [I've made it both ways]. When melting the butter, go ahead and melt the peanut butter in with it for the crust, then melt the pb with the chocolate for the top as well. Other reviewrs stated to let the crust chill a while before pouring chocolate on top- this is a must!!! Also, cutting after a quick chill of 10minutes is reccomended, as the chocolate will crack if you chill the whole hour before trying to cut. Great bars! Thanks Nancy!

These are fantastic!  However I changed a lot to make them a little healthier...NO ONE KNEW THE DIFFERENCE!  You'll find that wheat bran and wheat germ have a similar texture to graham cracker crumbs, I only used 1/3 cup of graham crackers and topped the rest up with a mixture of wheat bran and wheat germ.  2 cups of sugar is wayy too much, I didn't even use a whole cup, as the peanut butter and chocolate are already sweet enough.

These are SO much better than even Reese's! One reviewer mentioned processing the graham crackers in a blender or food processor.  This made all the difference since doing this gave the peanut butter filling that smooth texture. This is such an easy recipe and was a hit with my family!

AMAZING! we used cheerios because we didn't have any graham crackers, and mashed them up into crumbs (and added a few tblsps of sugar.) wonderful!! the cheerios made the peanut butter part just the tiniest bit crunchy--great either way. will definitely, most definitely, make these again SOON!

Oh my...I cannot stop eating this peanut buttery goodness!!! I used milk chocolate with a few teaspoons of butter for the topping, natural crunchy salty peanut butter, and this is so sinfully delicious that my waistline is expanding just thinking about it! MUST TRY!!! LOVED this!! Also super tasty to either layer in pretzels between the pb and choc layers, or jus add some onto the chocolate layer before it hardens. AM-A-ZING!

These peanut butter bars are nice for something different.  I will follow Lisa H's suggestion and add about 1/4 cup more of graham crackers for a firmer crust.  Also, I melted the chocoloate chips in the microwave for 20 secs.  They don't look completely melted but when you them out and stir them, they are melted and smooth.  Will make these again!

These were REALLY good!  Used about 1/4 cup extra graham cracker crumbs to make a firmer texture.  I used crunchy peanut butter in the base, and creamy in the topping.  I noticed that when I tried them right of the frige, you could not notice the peanut butter as much.  Once they came to room temperature, the flavor was much more intense.  With the extra crackers, I had no problem with them being too soft.  Give them a try!

These are good, but I did make some modifications. I cut the butter down to 1/2 cup, and melted the PB and butter together. I used graham cracker crumbs that were already crushed (pie crust crumbs). Why anyone would crush their own graham crackers for this recipe, I do not know. =) This modification provided an actual crust, which was very good. I also used milk chocolate because that's what I like. Very tasty!

Made these Satursday for a treat, and teenagers seemed to pop out of the woodwork to gobble them up.
I microwaved the butter and pnut butter and melted together and then added the dry ingredients.  Popped that into the frig to firm up while I melted the chocolate-- made the chocolate easier to spread

One word: AMAZING. I never usually post a review but these bars are too good not to.  In my husbands words:  "the best dessert bar i've ever made".  I took the advice of some and melted the pb with the butter first.  I also let it cool for 15 mins in the fridge before adding the chocolate topping.  (And used the whole bag of choc morsels)  I will definitely make these again and again. Thanks:)

Replaced the butter with more peanut butter and decreased the sugar by half. These would have been way too sweet for us. Followed other reviewer's advice and chilled bottom before adding chocolate. Easy enough to make but they don't hold together very well at room temperature.

These were great! I used 1 stick of butter and only 1 cup of sugar. It would have been way too sweet for me and my husband if I would have used the 2 cups of sugar. I added a pinch of salt to the graham cracker mixture. I also only added a spoonful of peanut butter to the chocolate chips. Next time I think I am going to try melting some Hershey bars in place of the semi-sweet chocolate chips. The semi-sweet was good, but didn't seem quite right. It did sort of taste like a Reese's! Thanks for sharing!

These really are great.  I was skeptical of using graham craker crumbs but it gave them the texture of reese's. Very easy and rich.  High calorie though.

These were a flavor explosion! Everyone loved them and wanted more!! I used an all natural peanut butter and it gave it more flavor than the normal peanut butter. I will make these every chance I get! Update: Served these at a graduation party and everyone was following me around wanting more. Two people requested the recipe. I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars! ********** :)

This recipe was so easy to make.  I made it on the spur of the moment one weekend.  As I live in the UK, I had to make an adjustment.  I used crushed, plain digestives for the crust.  They worked really well and are really very similar to graham crackers.  Also, I had some Nutella on hand and added that to my chocolate mixture.  A helpful hint...icing sugar is the same as confectioners sugar here in the UK.

Tasty! Roommate loved them! Tasted a lot like a reese's peanut butter cup, very rich! Definitely need a glass of milk with these! I made them in the 9x13 pan as noted, but I think next time I will put them in an 8x8 and use less chocolate topping!

Instead of graham cracker crumbs, I used a wheat hors d'oeuvre cracker (what I had on hand).  This gave the bars a nice hint of salt, which balanced out the sweetness of the other ingredients.  My coworkers raved over these!

My family loved these bars!  They are a simple bar to make if you're in a hurry and everyone loves them however, if you do not store in the fridge they don't hold their form very well and start to melt a little.

Tastes just like a Reese's!  You might need to add a bit more graham cracker crumbs, as I did.  Just makes it a little more firm.

My family enjoyed these, I do think I'd might use less powdered sugar or more peanut butter because I prefer a stronger peanut butter flavor.  I think I would make more chocolate for the top also, or maybe a layer for the bottom, freeze and once hardened continue with the recipe as listed.  The peanut butter to chocolate ratio just didn’t do it for me.  Maybe use less of the peanut butter mixture?? Not sure, but this is a good recipe.

I liked them but did not find them amazing.  I also found the peanut butter filing to be grainy. If you like peanut butter cups though, you will like this recipe.

Super easy and super good!  I followed the advice of a past reviewer and melted the peanut butter with the butter, it made it a lot easier to mix.  I also used half semi-sweet chips and half milk chocolate chips for the chocolate layer.

My kids loved these and they were easy to make, I felt the butter taste was a bit much and they seemed gritty from the graham cracker crumbs. I might try again and tweak a little bit.

WOW!!!!These are so yummy.  I'm addicted to them. The crust will seem a little moist but it hardens very well.  I also used a whole bag of choc. chips and lots more peanut butter in the choc. chip mixture.  They are to die for!!!

These are great.  In order to avoid trans fats, I used organic graham crackers and pb.  I crushed the crackers in my food processor and then added the rest of ingredients for the "crust" and processed them all together.  This worked very well and probably helped to avoid the gritty problem some people are talking about.  I used one stick of salted butter, and one unsalted, in the crust, and this worked out really well too.    When I went to melt the chocolate, it was going fine until the very end, when it kind of seized up on me and made it very difficult to spread.  This may have been my fault though, because I used just butter instead of pb and milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet, just because I prefer it.  They don't look too good, but still taste great. Next time I'll try a mixture of pb and butter in the topping.

I followed the recipe exactly and had trouble with the PB mixture. It was more spreadable than pressable. It finally did harden a bit once refrigerated. I was disappointed when I took the bars out of the refrigerator about an hour later to cut them - the chocolate layer completely seperated from the PB layer. They were a mess to get out of the pan. Maybe I need to let the pan come to room temperature before cutting. Overall, an okay recipe.

Here in Belgium, we don't have no graham crackers, so I fix them either with McVitie's Digestive or plain cookies. They're great, and even my sister, who HATES peanut butter LOVED them. Watch out: they tend to be sickly if eaten in large amount (I'm hugely greedy)!!!

These were SO delicious! Mine never got very firm at all and had to be eaten with a fork and kept in the fridge but I didn't even care because the taste was so amazing. I'll just have to keep practicing!

Ugg.. I make buckeyes a lot. Like one of the reviews.. chocolate made it hard to cut into mush! I was making these for a bake sale and feels like an epic fail. I thought it needed more powdered sugar and or less butter. Don't use this recipe! Look for others.. something is off.. and most likely it is just too much butter!

I only give this 3 stars because I believe this is the basic foundation for something similar to a Reese's peanut butter cup. A major downfall of this recipe in my opinion is that it doesn't call for any salt in the peanut butter layer. If you want this to taste anything like a Reese's it needs salt in the peanut butter layer. Have a real Reese's on hand and compare the flavor of the peanut later and add sea salt or Himalayan salt to taste. I literally added more than ten rotations of my salt grinder and everyone at the party I went to said that this was better than the real thing(Reese's)!

The other qualm I have with this recipe is that it calls for too much sugar and so to balance that sweetness out they try to hide it by calling for semi-*sweet chocolate. Real Reese's uses milk chocolate. So I added 1& 1/2 sifted powdered sugar (spoon in method) instead of 2 cups like they call for. Organic Graham crackers which I think are also alot less sweet than the unhealthy brand. And I used 12 oz milk chocolate + 1/8 cup of semisweet chocolate chips. It seriously tasted just like REESES!!!!

I never want to do a review on a recipe unless I’ve done it just as the original recipe said. I’m giving this 4 stars for the original but with one small adjustment, it becomes 5 stars. If you use 1 cup of butter, it is was too runny and has to be kept in the fridge until served. If you cut the butter down to 1 stick, it holds its shape and has a great texture- very similar to a Reese’s cup. I have even made these in mini muffin cups- with or without paper liners. Reducing the butter makes these delicious and easy to serve. My only bit of advice to anyone who says the peanut butter layer is too crumbly is that you have to mix it really well. I recommend mixing it with your hands.

I used 1 cup coconut sugar and a 1/2 cup regular sugar (I don't have confectioners) and I still found it to be very sweet so start light and work your way up with the sugar before you toss in 2 cups! (Plus, it's bad 4 ur teeth)
Try to get the graham crackers as fine as possible it makes your life easier, and the end result won't have chunks. Unless you like that.

Turned out great! My only issue was that I seemed to end up with a peanut butter layer twice as thick as in the picture; noticeably disproportionate to the chocolate layer. Next time I'll cut that part of the recipe in half.

I read the reviews and noted that some people said it was too sweet even with 1 1/2 cups of sugar.  I noticed there was another  website with a similar recipe and they added no sugar at all! I decided to use only one cup sugar.  It was great! You can just add some sugar while you are mixing and taste it to see if the sugar content suits you or not.   It tastes like Reese's peanut butter cups!  Mine was just a little less sweet.  You can use dark chocolate for the topping.  I used half dark and half semi-sweet.  For the chocolate topping, mix 2 tablespoons of the peanut butter with the chocolate chips.  Then warm the other 2 tablespoons separately on the stove and drop it in patches all over the top.  Then take your knife and make swirls with the peanut butter..  Turned out great.  Really hard to resist.  Not sure I can make this that often since it is hard to stop eating it!  (Note:  I provided a photo of the bars with the swirled top:  see photos)

AWESOME! Made this for our women's bible study and not only did I not get to bring any leftovers home, but I was was flooded with recipe requests and compliments.I used 1 and a1/2 sticks of butter and it worked out fine. Tasted just like Reese's and everyone loved them. Will definitely make again.

Tastes great! The only thing I would change is the amount of butter. They were kind of greasy for my liking but it didn't affect the actual taste. They are like peanut butter cups that you buy at the store!

As written, I think its a very good recipe. Too sweet for my taste though. I reduced the butter by half and only added 1 1/2 cups of sugar. For my taste, my modifications make it a 5 star recipe. If you like Reese's cups, you'll love this recipe exactly as written.

Edit: Now when I make this, I use the same amount of butter because it makes the bars less crumbly. My husband has a sweet tooth the size of Texas and he can only eat one, MAYBE two bars before being saturated with sweetness. If you are making these for a person with a real sweet tooth, make it exactly as is. If you are like me and enjoy sweets but want a bit more balance, try using dark chocolate instead of milk chocolate or reducing the amount of powdered sugar. A touch of sea salt would likely be divine as well.

I made this after reviewing all of the wonderful reviews, but they were flavorless except sweet. Used really good ingredients as i was making them for a large event. Really disappointed.  I'll serve them, but I hope no one asks who made them.  I used a hot knife to cut them into small squares.   I love the Buckeye recipe (no number following the name) and have added a review with hints there.  I thought this recipe would be as good as the Buckeyes and faster to make, but I was very wrong.  These are such a disappointment compared to the other recipe which I will never cheat on again and look elsewhere.  If everyone had tried the Buckeye recipe, they would be giving it two stars too (one star because I didn't throw it away).

I made it for a bake sale, and people liked it, but I was expecting it to be a lot better. I think I didn't add enough graham crackers, and I suggest not using the Vitamix since it pulverized them. I also used some shortening with 1 stick of butter since I didn't have more butter. I really believe I didn't use enough graham crackers, because it just tasted like peanut butter and chocolate. It was very, very sweet, too. I LOVE sweet so when I find things too sweet, I know it's not right. I probably wouldn't make this again just because it doesn't WOW me even if I made it with more g.c.

This is an excellent recipe, and it is equally good with 1.5 sticks of butter, and with the sugar amount decreased by 1/4 cup and split 1:1 sugar:stevia for those with sugar concerns.  My family loves this recipe, so I make it for our family get togethers and vacations.  Easy to make and tastes great!

My husbands favorite chocolate peanut butter bars. Super easy. A pack and a half of graham crackers makes about 2 cups of crumbs. I just throw them in my food processor and they get done in no time. You can reduce the butter and it'll still come out good but the peanut butter part won't be as easily spreadable.

I reduced the cracker crumbs by about half just as a personal preference. Seemed a little more like the brand name cups that way :)

These are by far the easiest summer treat with no oven and little clean up with a perfect richness and consistency. I used Skippy Super chunk (which I keep on hand for baking), boxed graham cracker crumbs, with butter and semi sweet chips from Trader Joe's and had help both times I made this from my 13 yr old son. He did most of the work and noted that the only change I made was a bit more peanut butter in with the chocolate and a dash of vanilla once it was smooth. The peanut butter makes it easier to slice through the top and adds a little depth to the flavor. Perfect as written and can be modified with smooth or chunky, semi sweet or bittersweet and in all cases, will not last long in the fridge with how delicious they turn out.

People that don't even like Reece's have loved this recipe. Probably my favorite dessert that I have ever made. I don't make it very often because I will eat all them them in one night.

This dessert was so easy and it was so delicious! I didn't have gram crackers so I substituted them for crushed pretzels. It was more delicious than it would have been with the gram crackers. I also put some pretzels on top :)

Now, I already know these are delicious. So, I made my own, and OOPS! Being me, I misread the directions and added 1CUP of peanut butter to the bottom half. Needless to say, it's super oily. The chocolate half is delicious! Though the bottom is still soft, I'll gladly still eat it (little at a time). I'll make it again in the future. Next time, I'll use a little less peanut butter ;)

I made these for Christmas and they're DELICIOUS!!  I used Skippy PB and added a little extra (about 1/4-1/3 cup) powdered sugar, as I thought it was kind of runny still..  I followed the advice of others and I put the bars in the fridge for about 15 min before topping with the choc mixture, otherwise it'll melt all together.  I added 1/4 c butter to the choc/PB mix, to make it spread easier.  Sooooo yummy!!

My changes

- 1 1/2 sticks of butter
- Once you have the pb spread in the 9x13 refrigerate it for 15 minutes before adding the chocolate
- Used chocolate chips instead of the semi sweet. 
- Make sure to have the graham crackers crushed enough or else it will be gritty.
- 12 whole sheets of graham crackers.

It comes out perfect!!!

The top was too hard and the bottom too soft, so I took off the chocolate top added more powdered sugar to the bottom, rolled them in balls placed in a freezer about 15 minutes, then dipped them in a good dipping chocolate.. I love them and call them peanut butter crunch, mmmmm.

I read the reviews and did what others did… I should've stuck with the recipe.  The way others raved about their changes including adding chocolate chips (to 2 cups) and adding butter.  It was heavy and too sweet.  Next time I'll try one stick of butter, less chocolate chips and less powdered sugar.

Taking the advice of other reviewers, I reduced the butter to 1.5 sticks, with excellent results. I also chilled the bottom layer for an hour before spreading the chocolate mixture on top. But first, I lined the inside of my pan with foil to create a sling. When the bars were done chilling, I lifted the whole thing out of the pan using the foil sling. Made it SO EASY to cut nice, neat squares.

I'm not the biggest fan of peanut butter, but these were delightful! I followed the recipe as is and found nothing wrong with them, although I haven't taken more than two or three bites of a small square since I made them. They are so incredibly rich, but good for company. Originally it was my coworker who asked me to make these for her, and for me it was something new to try out in the kitchen. Not only did she thoroughly enjoy these (she says that her family finished all twelve of them in less than a 24-hour period), but when I made these again for my very own family, I nearly had to beat them off with a stick just to get a piece for myself. I wouldn't make any modifications to this recipe except for maybe that's only personal preference

Kids agree this is better than Reeses. Easy and delicious. Cut before refrigerated fully or they become too hard to easily cut.

My 12 year old daughter and I made these....wow!!! Soooooo good!!! The only change was half cup less of the sugar. Will definitely make again (but not too soon because it's easy to devour more than your fair share;)

Although the taste was ok - the peanut butter base was way too soft.   Think softened margarine would work better than melted.

Let me start by saying this recipe is a crowd-pleaser!Tasty and easy to make. I used a stick and a half of butter. Chilled the crust before the chocolate topping. The downside of this recipe is how to avoid the chocolate from breaking up when cutting into bars. HOwever, after nearly cutting all the bars. I did find cutting halfway into the bars first (a section at a time) helped alleviate the breaking.

These work great with Cashew Butter as well...I'm more of a Milk Chocolate fan so I substitute that too.  I use the gluten free graham cracker and life is good!

I used natural peanut butter for this recipe so I didn't expect it to be as sweet as it was (which is very sweet). I don't think it needed all the icing sugar in the base.

Still tasty and makes LOTS!

Just finished this for my friend's son's birthday party.  Hope its a hit. Used 1/2 a cup less sugar and added a tblspn of honey 1/2 a pinch of numeg and cinnamon and 1/2 tspn vanilla essence to the base.  Used crunchy for bit of bite and for the topping added abt a tblspn of nutella and vanilla and more spice.  Tasted soooo decadant. *throws away weighing scale*

Oh my gosh, these bars are SO good! They taste just like a peanut butter cup! Very easy to make. Cut into 2X2-inch squares, these bars go a long way. Definitely keep in the refrigerator, though. Adding to my personal family recipe box!

This was DELICIOUS!!! Only thing I changed was that I used Natural Peanut Butter (without the hydrogenated oils) and it didn't end up getting loose and mushy like other reviewers said when they used natural peanut butter. It was perfect!

I have a child who is allergic to peanuts so I also made a half batch with almond butter for her.  It wasn't nearly as good, although it might have been because in the almond butter one I also used coconut oil instead of butter... Won't make that mistake again! Use real butter!

This is the first recipe I have tried for my New Years resolution, which is to cook or bake one new recipe each week. I used to have these peanut butter chocolate bars as a kid, our school called them gold bars. They were so easy to make - even I didn't mess it up and I have nearly 0 kitchen experience. I cut the recipe in half and used a smaller pan because it's just me and my roommate eating them. They were as tasty as I remembered! A good start to 2015 :)

These are excellent. I made them after making the homemade peanut butter cups on this site and I think these are much tastier. The peanut butter mixture is the best I've had. I might prefer to make more of the chocolate layer next time, though. Made these for Christmas and they were a hit with everyone.

I took the bars to a family Christmas party and everyone was telling me how good they are.  As others suggested I puts the peanut butter in the fridge for 20 minutes before topping with the melted chocolate. I also put 1/4 tablespoons into the chocolate mixture. Came out perfectly and everyone was asking me where I got the recipe from.  This is a keeper.

With a peanut allergy in the family I decided to use sun nut butter instead. Turned out really good, but the base was rather soft and crumbly. Not sure if this is because of the sun nut butter, or if it would be better to cook the graham cracker base after it is mixed together.

Still, very tasty.

Ok, so these are CRAZY good!  Milk chocolate is a must for a true Resee like experience.  And I like to make my own peanut butter.  To do this, use 2 cups peanuts in a high speed blender (like Ninja) or a food processor.  that way you get no added sugar, or hydrogenated oils!!  Just pure peanut yumminess!!!
BEWARE!! These are extremely addicting!!!

The only complaint I get is that I don't make them enough. Taste better than any store bought and easy to make.

Too sweet for our family including the kids. Great taste, but painstakingly sweet.  If I try it again I'll reduce sugar and compensate with more graham crumbs

Amazing!  I was heavy handed with the chocolate on top, thinking that I love chocolate. However, I loved the peanut butter layer so much, I actually removed some chocolate to enjoy the peanut butter on its own!

These were really good but very sweet! I did not put the whole two cups of sugar in.  I'm not much of a sweet eater but even my daughter said they were really good but very sweet. I would for sure make again for a party..

I made a gluten free version of this for a dessert table at a party for 30+ people.  I used an 8 oz package of GF cinnamon cookies ground up in the food processor.  Everyone raved about these and my cupcakes, but didn't even care about the double chocolate brownies topped by a dollop of buttercream frosting.  That's how good they were!  I cut them into 48 small squares and only had a few left at the end of the party.  Be sure to follow the instructions of lining the pan with parchment or waxed paper, putting the chocolate topping on after 20 min in the refrigerator, and then cutting into bars after another 20 min in the refrigerator.

I thought the flavor of these was fantastic!  The consistency of the bottom crust fell to bits and pieces when I cut the bars.  I would recommend adding an egg to help the graham cracker crust form a crust easier.

Really easy and really yummy! I used the ingredients as listed. I chilled the bottom layer a little too long before topping with chocolate and the first piece I tried separated...maybe bringing it to room temp will make it stick together again.

Great taste but likes others have said, use less butter, graham crackers need to be a powder and fridge is a must. Will make again with changes.

To make it healthier, I reduce the butter to 2/3 cup.  I use only 1/2 cup powdered sugar and 1/2 cup honey. and then even add 1/4 cup oat bran for fiber.  This recipe is so forgiving that you can even throw a handful of peanut butter Puffin cereal for more texture.  Make them into balls and dip in chocolate.

These are so good. I changed one thing to make them perfect though. I added 2 1/2 Cups of graham crackers instead of the 2 C in the recipe. Some reviewers said they were too greasy or soft. Adding the extra 1/2 C made them perfect. Not too crumbly, not too soft. :)

Just like Reese's! However, I didn't have graham crackers (not to mention they aren't very healthy) so I subbed with club crackers, and the bars were even better than when i made them with graham crackers!

I really appreciated the reviews that pointed out natural peanut butter doesn't set up as well as "regular". Mine too are delicious but soft, so now I know why :) I think when I make these again (still using natural) I will make sure it's a generous 2 cups super finely crushed graham crumbs. I may try to reduce the butter but as written, this is really the perfect flavor. Thanks so much for sharing!

I'm crazy about Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, so when I found this recipe I had to try it. It's wonderful! It's so easy to make I had my four year old granddaughter help me. I made it just as the recipe instructed, didn't change a thing. (That's very unusual for me!)  if you like peanut butter cups, you're going to love these!

Wow!! Amazing, amazing, amazing!! So easy and so delicious! No need to buy the name brand peanut butter cups ever again. I did melt the butter and the peanut butter together and refrigerate the base for 30 minutes before topping with the chocolate as other reviewers suggested. The result was perfect.
Update: These make great peanut butter cups! I cut the peanut butter base recipe in half but did use the entire amount of the chocolate topping. I used regular size muffin cups. I used a very small melon scooper and used one scoop of peanut butter and one scoop of chocolate. Doing this makes about 23 peanut butter cups.

I only had 1.5 cups of graham cracker crumbs and only downsize the butter to 1 stick then added 1.5 cups of peanut butter to make the crust stick together more. I also added about 6 tablespoons of peanut butter to the chocolate. Refrigerator overnight. The cons on this recipes is that it was really hard to cut when it comes out the fridge. Next time, I'll cut them when it's semi-hard. Second, the some of the chocolate broke when I cut it. Third, some of the chocolate separated from the crust. Fourth, need to be kept cool or it'll get soft. The pros are that it does tastes like that peanut butter cup candy, it didn't matter if some broke since I ate them (should move this to the cons), and lastly, it was very easy to make. Everyone loved them. Thanks!

These things are so amazing! Every time I make them they disappear in an instant. They are crazy rich... so you can cut into tiny little nibblet pieces. I suppose the only down size is they melt if left out of the fridge too long so they aren't a god plan for a cookie platter. Oh, and... they take about 10 minutes to make, which is the coolest part...done and done

I made these a few days ago for Easter, and people absolutely raved about them! I put the graham crackers (2 sleeves) in the blender and pulsed them into a fine powder, then mixed in the powdered sugar in a large mixing bowl. I melted 1.25 cups of smartbalance with 1 cup of peanut butter on the stove top and added the mixture to the mixing bowl. After stirring everything together I pressed the crust into the bottom of a 7x11" pyrex pan and put it in the fridge for 25 mins as per other reviews. I melted the peanut butter and chocolate chips together in the microwave (Warning: the peanut butter will easily burn, be sure to mix every 25-30 secs or so) and spread the topping on the crust. After returning the pan to the fridge for 10 more minutes I cut them and returned them to the fridge for 15 more minutes. Thank you for the amazing recipe, this is definitely a keeper!

When I was making this, I found that I did not have any regular chocolate chips. I found some white chocolate chips so I used those. They turned out to be the best bars I have ever tasted and my family raved about them for days.

These were tasty, although if I were to make them again, I would use more peanut butter and less butter as I found the base tasted very strongly of butter. I also found the chocolate part did not adhere well to the base and they kept splitting apart when I was transferring them from the pan.

Like others, I had a problem with it not "setting-up" properly. I kept it in the fridge overnight, took it out a few hours before serving, and by the time we were ready to eat it, it was just mush. The reason I gave three stars is because they were good, just too mushy. I might try again with less butter, as it seems those that reduced the butter didn't have this problem.

In an effort to control our sugar intake, I split the batch and put half in the freezer to take out another time. Well, that didn't help a bit, we just went straight to the freezer for more. Turns out we like them even better that way!

This is seriously one of the best dessert recipes I ever came across

I made a half batch in a 9x9 pan. I didn't have the semi-sweet chocolate chips on hand so I used Hershey kisses instead. Everybody LOVED them. The recipe is super easy and the results taste almost like fudge but not as sweet.

These are heavenly! I used homemade peanut butter (we ran out of store bought) and they still turned out delicious. My only concern is how I'm going to be able to hold back from scarfing the whole pan before the rest of my family gets to them!

Delicious! I used organic peanut butter which was not as sweet as regular peanut butter. The quality of your peanut butter matters. I used 1/4 to 1/2 cup more graham cracker crumbs as well. I will make this again. My family enjoyed it.

Loved this!  Followed directions for the peanut butter part perfectly.  Made a change on the chocolate part though.  Instead of semi sweet chips I cut up approx. 2 cups of Hershey's plain chocolate bars and melted them with 1 tbsp. of butter over low heat then poured and gently spread over the top of pb filling and refrigerated.  Perfect for us and will definitely be making this one again!

Love this dessert!  Here are some slight changes I made to this recipee:  Used 1.5 sticks of butter.  Added 1.5 cups chow mein noodles to add the perfect crunch, and the chow mein noodles never went soggy. I did chill the peanut butter layer before adding the chocolate layer, so it would spread better.  I think it tastes best to eat the bars at room temperature even though they are softer that way.

These are awesome! I made them for a couple different occasions and made some last week. They do taste just like a peanut butter cup. The only thing I don't like is how much butter goes in them, being 4 1/2 months  pregnant in all, it cause some heartburn lol, but they were very good overall!

We tried this recipe yesterday and it is quite good. My one complaint is that these were thin and somewhat insubstantial. Next time I will make them meater by using crunchy peanut butter for the base - or salted peanut halves - and use a 9x9 so they are thicker.

Yum! I didn't have graham cracker so I used pretzels and a little bit of sugar.  I also added a little bit of whipped cream and it was delicious. Definitely a keeper, thanks!

These were a hit but I'm going to try and spray the pan with non-stick spray next time, so it was hard to get them out without breaking them.

Just made these tonight!!! If you love Reeses...youll love these...I used light peanut butter (like that really made it healthier! LOL!) and ran out of semi sweet chips so used 2oz of bakers semi sweet chocolate with 1c. of chips.  The whole family loved it and I will be bringing them home for Christmas!! Chocolate and Peanut butter hard to go wrong with that!!

These are super simple and always a big hit.  The only thing I will mention is that they need to be kept cool otherwise they start to melt.  They usually go so fast at the functions I make them for that it never really is a problem for me.  Definitely recommend!

These are awesome! They really DO taste like peanut butter cups! They best consistency is room temperature - then you can get the feel of your fingers "melting" into the peanut butter, just like the peanut butter cup!

I liked this. I would probably use sweeter chocolate chips next time. I took another person's advise in using less butter and kept the rest of the amounts the same.

I loved this recipe! It was very quick and easy, and it tastes great! I used natural peanut butter and because of the natural oils in it, I only used 1/2 cup of butter. Turned out fabulous! Thanks!

This is really good as written, but since it was purported to taste like Reeses, and we were hoping it did, we judged it accordingly.  It is close.  If we hadn't hoped it was like Reeses, I think we would simply love it and adopt it for those rare occasions when we would make candy.  The smell is JUST like Reeses.  I have a son who loves Reeses (so we tried this to see if it would be just right for his birthday).  I think this could be modified to be more Reeses-like, starting with using milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet.  I like the semi-sweet myself, but that doesn't make it Reeses-like, if you know what I mean.  There is also a particular flavor in Reeses that comes from corn syrup, so that is a must.  Lastly, there is the texture of the of the peanut butter.  I have a couple of 'fixes' in mind to try, but I'm not sure if either will work - I'll let you know if I find the 'just right' solution.

Unbelievable how good these are.  Experiment a bit with the peanut butter/ butter ratio and you will get what you're looking for be it Reese's or more of a bar consistency.  Absolutely delicious, and so simple.  You wouldn't believe how many more friends I have now that I make these regularly. Now where is my glass of milk.

I made these yesterday for a football party. I needed something quick so I just threw these together. I followed others advice and only used 1 stick plus 2 Tbs butter. I used a 13X9 and an 8X8 square pan because I wanted them to cover a platter and I didn't want them too thick,I also sprayed the pan with Pam. I also found out(too late) that I only had not quite a cup of confectioners sugar, so I added about a half of a can of Duncan Hines white frosting. I put these in the freezer for about 45 minutes to firm up before I left and they were perfect. They were gone in minutes and everyone raved about these, they almost couldn't believe that I made them and it only took me a few minutes! I used Jif creamy peanut butter, real butter and good quality milk chocolate chips, maybe the quality of ingredients that some people used made them turn out less than perfect. The texture and taste of these was amazing...Thanks so much for this recipe!

These were excellent!  I followed the recipe with NO VARIATIONS the first time I made it.  They definitely have to be completely chilled when cut into squares.  I cut the batch at all at one time, then used a pancake turner to carefully lift them out of the pan.  I am getting ready to make them again and will use a small amount of pan spray on the bottom of the pan this time. Enjoy!

I followed the recipe exactly but we found these to be way too rich and the bottom peanut butter part was very crumbly.  Not at all what I was expecting or hoping for.

This recipe has too much butter for my liking...  

I followed the recipe measurements exactly. I made the crumbs from a mixture of tea biscuits, oatmeal crackers, and traditional crackers, giving it a crunch texture which 

Be aware, When i tasted the warm mixture (prior to refridgerating) it tasted sickly...Too salty, sugary and buttery. I thought something went wrong and was going to throw it out. But thankfully with the chocolate on top and served chilled it tasted much better...

Overall however I would have like it tasting more peanut butter, and less buttery. Despite the above dislikes i couldn't stop eating them, which gave me a queasy stomach for the rest of the day after a few pieces. I read in a review below that you can use less butter which if i make again i will try 1 stick.  Maybe melt a few marshmallows into the mix to help it hold together. More peanut butter too.

I am a peanut butter fanatic.  I make PB cookies quite often, and also buckeyes.  I saw this recipe and was so excited.  It did not meet my expectations.  Not only that, but the bars have sat in the fridge uneaten for almost a week.  Will not make again, sorry.  Texture was off, and PB flavor was almost non-existent.  I don't understand all the high ratings.  I can only assume that these aren't big PB lovers!

This recipe is so good, it is better than peanut butter cups if that is possible! Very easy to make, I babysit my friends grandkids and I had her 12 year old granddaughter make them.

Excellent!  I did make 2 small changes just to suit my family.  We are not huge graham cracker fans, but we do love peanut butter, so I reduced the graham cracker crumbs to 6 oz., and increased the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups.

I LOVE this quick recipe. I used honey peanut butter the first time I made these because that's what I had at the time...I think that put it over the top!

Very enjoyable. I used milk chocolate chips because I didn't have semi-sweet chocolate chips and they worked out fine.

I melted the peanut butter and butter before mixing them together; it worked out MUCH more easily.

I've had similar recipes for years, but all the reviews encouraged me to finally make these bars.  Three teenaged boys devoured them quickly, though I thought they were very rich and could only eat a small square.  Very, very good.  I did reduce the butter a bit, and they turned out just fine.  I used half milk chocolate and half semi-sweet chocolate chips. Thanks for a great recipe.

I have made these for years! For holidays, gifts or whenever we have a sweet tooth. They are So easy and so tasty I would recommend this recipe to anyone and everyone that Loves Peanut Butter Cups. It also works well by lining the pan and putting another layer of chocolate. (Family Loves chocolate) You really cannot mess this up. I could go on forever how great this recipe really is. Good Luck and happy tasting!

I used extra peanut butter 1 1/2 cups for the bar and 5 tbs in the chocolate (for more peanut butter flavor)! HUGE hit ... will make over and over!

I have been making these for years. The only difference is using whatever chocolate chips I have on hand, and melting them in their bag in the microwave, clipping a corner and spreading on the base.  No peanut butter in the chocolate, no bowl to wash!!
Thanks for reminding me it was time to make again!!

Very good.  Only changes I made were to reduce butter by 1/2 stick and use milk chocolate chips, as that is what I had on hand.  Everyone loved them.

One word, DELISH! Chill the bottom for about 20 minutes before spreading the topping on it. Also do yourself a favor and use MILK chocolate chips instead. ENJOY:)

Very tasty, but my chocolate wouldn't stick to my peanut butter mixture and I couldn't easily get it out of the pan. I think this is due to me using a food processor and blending it too much; I will use a wooden spoon next time.

They tasted good, but I had very uneven layers of peanut butter and chocolate in the finished product.  Next time I plan to chill the peanut butter layer before topping with the chocolate ganache, and then chill the completed pan again.

These were beyond awesome, but we thought they could be improved with pretzel or with salt in the chocolate mixture for added crunch and contrast in flavor.

Edit:  I added 1 cup chopped pretzels on top - they were delicious.  May add a caramel drizzle on top of the pretzel next.

Absolutely delish.  I made two batches.  I ran out of peanut butter for one of the chocolate toppings, so I used peanut butter chips instead.  The flavor was not bad, but the texture is too hard.  Much tastier with the original recipe.

Love it! As a kid of age 8 I’m not too used to cooking but this came out perfect! I let the peanut butter bars cool for 2 hours instead of 1 so you wouldn’t get peanut butter all over your hand and that worked! One thing is that it is real hard to get them out of the oven but even then it’s too good. I will make this recipe again for sure! Thanks Nancy!

As other have said keep refrigerated as they go real soft. These were nice but have sat for near a week in our fridge, so not a recipe I would prob do again. Took them to my grand daughters today for them, just to get them out of the fridge. The taste is nice but very rich.

So good!  I used reduced fat graham cracker crumbs, 1 c confec sugar (plenty sweet for us) maybe because I used milk chocolate hershey kisses in place of semisweet chocolate (I had leftover chocolate because I used a smaller pan).  I also added a couple of Tbsps of hemp protein powder.  I don't  know the size of my pan but it's much smaller than a 9X13 and they are a nice thickness.  Next time I'll use only 3/4 c butter.  They cut beautifully with a dough cutter after a few hours of chilling.  Keep them in the fridge for a firm bar!

Fantastic! Took the advice of one of the reviews and reduced the butter by 1/2 stick. I chilled the PB bottom for about 20 minutes to make spreading the chocolate easier. HUGE hit at our Superbowl Party and could not be easier!

Very good flavor. I followed recipe though I halved it so I didn't eat the whole thing. I did spread some more peanut butter on the crust before spreading w/ chocolate as some had noted a lack of pb flavor. Did get crumbly when removing from pan however.

The chocolate layer was so yummy, but we didn't care for the peanut butter bottom.  It was very crumbly and way too sweet.  I think I may try tweaking it, or put the chocolate layer over another bottom recipe.

Crazy easy. Takes 10 minutes from start to finish. And yummy! I used homemade peanut butter and loved it.

OMG...these are SO good!  I took them to my family Christmas and everyone loved them.  I expanded the recipe (about 1 1/2 of the original) and used a mix of semi sweet & dark chocolate (Hershey's) brand chips.  It mad the topping a little richer.  I will definitely make this again!

These were a hit with my family! I made a few changes: I added a touch vanilla as well as evaporated milk to the melted chocolate. For the top, I swirled some white chocolate into the still warm chocolate. And, I actually FORGOT to melt peanut butter in with the chocolate, but it still tasted yummy! My family thought it tasted like fudge!

I thought these were ok. I'm a big fan of peanut butter and these just weren't peanut buttery enough! The bars also got quite soft if left out of the fridge, which isn't good for parties when people are grazing all day. So...in a nutshell: These are good, but could be better. :)

I cut mine into 72 pieces. That was about the portion of a mini Peanut butter cup. My husband is a die hard p.b. Cup fan and he loved these. Simple simple simple to do. No cooking. I liked that :). And for the weight watcher folks, if u cut it into 72 pieces, they are 3 pointsPlus values per piece.

My 2 Favorite ingredients. I have the worst sweet tooth and this was rich enough for me! I left one for my husband that said with love from heaven. I used 1 stick and 2 TB of butter and it turned out fine. I definitely have to watch myself with these!

Taste was great we loved them, but the texture og the crumbs and the peanutbutter bottom was a put off for me. Maybe I just didn't make the crumbs fine enough? Though not sure how much finer I could have made them than using a heavy marble rolling pin to crush them.

Awesome recipe! This will be replacing Reeses in my home for sure. I made them this morning and my boyfriend has already eaten half the batch! The recipe is easy, and tastes amazing. I followed what some of the other users said and melted the peanut butter with the butter and I used an extra 1/2 cup chocolate chips! Thanks for putting this up, it will definitely be used again and again!

These were very easy to make and tasted delicious!  My only complaint with them was that the bottom layer was very crumbly and the chocolate layer on top came off as soon as I cut them.  Not sure what I did wrong as I followed the recipe exactly.  I guess I will have to make them again to see if I can get it right :)

These taste - and smell! - great.  I found the bottom layer to be too mushy. They were fine straight out of the freezer, but that's not a realistic way to serve them if you're bringing them to a party where they're apt to sit on a tray. Maybe I'll try less butter next time...

Better than store bought! Imade a few big pans for Easter and they were a hit. I cut it into candy size pieces because it was very sweet, but overall, it was excellent.

Wonderful! I can't stop making these bars! I love to freeze them for when guests come over and I have had nothing but compliments. They absolutely "melt in your mouth" (comment from one of my guests). Thank you for the wonderful recipe, although my jeans are getting a bit tight these days!

Super easy and had ingredients on hand. WE ate in one sitting. Unhealthy, but stress relieving.

Yummy as written.  Does taste like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups.  The butter affects the creaminess of the peanut butter layer.  SO, yes, it does taste the same with less butter as other reviewers have mentioned.  I like the creaminess so I use the recommended amount of butter.  Next time, I will reduce the powdered sugar and sub crunchy peanut butter and semisweet or dark chips (or a mixture of both?) in the frosting layer.  Really great and easy recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

Just an FYI, of course these taste great. Little trouble, don't try to cut right from fridge, top chocolate layer wants to crack off. Also, husband took a pan to work, got comments of good, but rich. There were leftovers for the next shift. I'm going back to Monster cookies, they eat the whole batch! Makes me feel better!

Holy sweetness!!!! These are way too sweet for even my sweet tooth! They were good but only a small piece, more than that gave me & my husband such belly aches & sat like rocks in our belly!!
They did taste good though, if I do make them again (not sure after such a belly ache!) I would decrease the butter to 1 stick of butter & only 1 cup of confectioners sugar, maybe then they will be good & not overly sweet.

Tasted good, but the peanut butter/graham cracker mixture would not set up. I followed the instructions exactly, then tried adding more graham crackers, but nothing worked. Will not make again!

I made this for my cookie plates at Christmastime.  Everyone was raving about how great they were!  Good job on this recipe.  In order to make the chocolate re-solidify, I added some vegetable shortening.  It helps to make the chocolate harder.

I tried to use natural peanut butter with one batch I made.  I had to keep them in the freezer.  I gave a small tin of them frozen to a friend.  They told me they were awesome!  :D   (Beware, the frozen chocolate cracked randomly like crazy.  I only managed a few neat pieces.)

Good luck if you're making it with natural peanut butter!

YUM! such an easy and tasty recipe. I tried with 1-1/2 sticks of butter and had a slight crumbling problem but not so bad to not make it worth while to reduce the butter.  We'll have these again!

I cut the recipe in half and put it in an 8x8 pan and it turned out great!  I put them in the freezer to make the chocolate harden faster because I was impatient.  The next day cutting through the chocolate was difficult because it was just too cold.  This is a great recipe for when you want a sugar fix but don't want to make a whole batch of cookies.

These are so easy & delicious.I was able to whip up a batch of these with my 3 month old strapped to the front of me in her Bjorn.No "cooking" involved,so it was the perfect treat for us to make together.I am pretty sure these would be a huge hit at any party or gathering.

Very easy! I took the advice of others and let the bottom layer chill for 15 minutes before adding the chocolate. Great suggestion, as there were two distinct layers, and the chocolate did not run through the peanut butter layer.

This was a GREAT recipe! I would not recommend cutting any of the butter tho. The first time I made this I cut the butter to 1 1/2 sticks but it was not as smooth as my second batch with 2 sticks. I did however add a tsp of vanilla to give it a little extra something.

I would highly recommend not adding the full cup of butter. I used 2 sticks and the bottom layer was very wet and slimmy :( I will only be using one stick next time, they taste great though - exactly like my mom used to make!

I didn't care for the taste of the semisweet chocolate chips. Next time I will try using regular chocolate chips and I think it will be 5 stars.

These were good, but not as good as the more labor-intensive buckeyes I was trying to replicate without all the work.  The kids really liked them, including my younger daughter who's not a fan of peanut butter.  Mixing peanut butter into the chocolate topping was genius as it gave it a very creamy texture and allowed me to cut it without cracking.  One tip: line the pan with parchment or wax paper and just lift the whole block out on to a cutting board for cutting; let it come to room temperature before cutting as it will be softer.  Now, if anyone can tell me how to make a buckeye in bar form, I would greatly appreciate it!

This just did not seem sweet enough to us.  Next time I will use milk chocolate chips for the top layer, and add more powdered sugar to the bottom layer.  Not a bad recipe but it needs a little work.

my kids said they "better then loved" these although one did say they were a tad too sweet....I have 6 kids. I have to agree they were pretty sweet but cut into small squares makes a 9x9 pan go quite a ways and they are perfect for a PB/Chocolate fix though not quite like reeses IMO. This review is from my kids....I would say 4.5 stars myself

Brought these to work and to a school function-they went FAST!  I must add they were sweeter than expected, I cut them into small 1" squares so the sweetness wasn't overwhelming.  Problem solved-wouldn't change a thing!

These had a really good taste, but was very dry. I chopped the graham crackers in my Bullet chopper. Which could have made them too fine resulting in needing more graham crackers to make the amount needed. Next time if I use my Bullet chopper I will add in some more butter.

This was very decent as written - 4 stars.  But if you really want to take it to the next level, start with the peanut base as written, add a thick layer of melted caramel, chill and layer on double the chocolate topping.  Look out - it's a five star ticket to weight watcher's h*ll.

These taste awesome!  Mine came out crumbly but I did try to use a little less butter.  Don't try to cut while they are cold or the chocolate will break apart from the peanut butter.

These were so good and so easy! I used a 9x11 pan and they came out a bit too thin for my taste so next time I'll be using a 8" square dish to get the thickness of the bars in the main picture. :) So easy it should be made illegal, hehehe.

Best bars!!! Everyone in the office loved them. In fact three or four people came in for fourths!! My boyfriend thought the peanut butter part was grainy but personally I loved the flavor and texture!  I would not explain it as a peanut buttercup because the peanut butter mix is not smooth but it was awesome and SOOOOOO EASY!!

If I could use one word to describe these, it would be ADDICTIVE! They really are just amazing. The only change I made to this was I took 1/4 c butter out of the peanut butter mix and instead used it to help melt the chocolate chips, and because I didn't have graham cracker crumbs, I crushed up graham crackers, and ended up not crushing them entirely (there were still some chunks, but it only added to the flavor). These are so good, they taste more and more like reese's the longer you have them refrigerated. It's really difficult to leave them alone in the fridge, though, once you've had one, they start looking lonely in the fridge, and maybe if I just cut a little off here, just to even it out . . . before you know it half the pan and a gallon of milk is gone, and you have a tummy ache like your first Halloween that you went overboard on the sweets. (I have no regrets LOL) Thank you for this amazing recipe!!! :)

Yum! I substituted the semisweet chips for dark chocolate, and it offsets the sweetness of the peanut butter mixture very well.

Yummy! I didn't have graham crackers so I used crushed animal crackers with a tsp of cinnamon mixed in. I also used 2 cups of chocolate and added 4 TBS of butter to that. So easy to make and so good!

These are really good! Use LESS butter, and added more crumbs. I used a stick and a half of butter, but you could definitely use just one, because I still had to add more crumbs than was suggested.  Definitely buy the crumbs, and try not to do it yourself, unless you use a food processor to get them really fine.  Keep in the fridge, obviously, or they go soft and the chocolate melt.

These were very easy too make, however, they were way too sweet for my family.  I will probably make them again but I will try it with 1 1/2 cups of conf. sugar.

Wow and yum!  Those words came up often when I served these at a family bbq recently.  They are very rich and taste just like a Reese's candy.  Like others suggested, I decreased the amount of butter to 1 1/2 sticks, rather than 2.  I had to run to 2 different stores to locate graham cracker crumbs, but def. worth it.  Some of my family would have liked more of the peanut butter base, so I may try upping that next time.  VERY delicious!

OH MY GOSH!  YUM!  Made them exactly how it's written.  Had to give a little away cause me and my husband would have eaten all of these in a short period of time.  Next time I will probably freeze some and chop them up and use them in brownies or flurries cause they taste just like Reese Peanut Butter cups but WAY better!

This recipe was down right perfect. It actually was BETTER than reeces, for the simple fact that the chocolate/PB topping taste way better than RPC. You will love this recipe...but be careful. Every time you walk by your fridge you will want to steal another peice!

WOW - Super quick & easy & yes, they taste JUST like the Reese's peanut butter cups.  Will definitely become a common treat in our household!!!  Thanks so much for the recipe.  I did take the advice of another review & cut the butter down to 1 1/2 sticks, and microwave was quick & easy for the top.

I wasn't really impressed with the recipe and neither were my guests. It tasted like a brick of peanut butter and chocolate. It was sweet and I love chocolate with peanut butter but it was a little too rich. If you make this make sure to cut into small squares - like you would with fudge.

YUM!!  My new favorite dessert! The graham crackers make it gritty and delicious. I used half natural peanut butter/half regular and it worked great. They do best cold. Although still delicious at room temp, cold keeps them very firm.

Thank you to the reviewer who tried these with just one stick of butter, for my first try I decided to do the same and it turned out so well that I wouldn't make them with more butter than that. It was a bit dry (I used natural PB that didn't have any ingredients other than peanuts, so that + less butter is probably the cause) so I added a splash of milk and it came together well. Such a quick, easy recipe, I used the same bowl for everything so the cleanup with quick as well.

I wanted to try a no-bake recipe and decided to try this one because I had all the ingredients and my husband is a bit of a peanut butter fiend. Having read some of the reviews that stated these we better than Reese's peanut butter cups, I didn't think that was even possible (I love Reese's!). I followed the directions and ingredients exactly. To make the graham cracker crumbs I put two packages of graham crackers in the food processer (I think that was about 20 graham crackers) and measured out the 2 cups worth. Its important to have finely crushed graham crackers. I used Jif creamy peanut butter. For the chocolate, I did substitute Hershey kisses for 1/2 cup of the chocolate chips because I didn't have enough, but honestly I loved the taste the kisses gave to this recipe. I refrigerated the peanut butter "crust" for about 15 minutes before spreading the chocolate mixture on top. These really were better than peanut butter cups. They are soooo good. The only problem I had was the peanut butter crumbling when trying to remove from the pan. I think this could be fixed by pressing it down more with a spatula and lining the pan with parchment paper. I am thinking of making this recipe into peanut butter cups using mini muffin liners. I will be keeping the Kisses in this recipe though, they give it a really good flavor.

I made this recipe as-is and it came out wonderful.  They tasted just like peanut-butter cups and the crust stayed moist and did not fall apart because it was so dry.  My family loved it.  This is such an easy and quick recipe I will definitely be making this one again.

These are very good. If you decide to 1/2 the recipe, use a 8x8 pan not a 9x9 pan, as they get too thin with a larger pan. will definately make these again & again!!

This might be one of the easiest and quickest desserts I've ever made. To lighten it up, I used two sticks (1 cup) of light half the fat butter with 1 cup of light peanut butter. I also used 1 cup of confectioners' sugar and 1 cup of Splenda and I bet it would work just as fine with 2 cups of Splenda which I will try next time. For more chocolate flavour, I used chocolate graham crackers but I'm sure you could just add a tablespoon or two of cocoa to regular graham crackers for the same effect. I followed other review suggestions of cutting the squares in the pan after 10 minutes of refrigeration and then refrigerating the whole pan for the rest of the time. I cut the squares with a sharp knife which I dunked periodically into hot water. To get more height, I also used a 9 x 9 square pan. I didn't refrigerate the base before adding the chocolate layer. If you cut into 16 squares, with the modifications to lighten up, each square comes out to 225 calories. These squares are absolutely scrumptious and fool proof!

These are good, and I might make them for a kid's party, but they are too sweet for me. They are sugary and crumbly. I'd probably spend more time baking if I were making dessert for adults.

These were SPECTACULAR! The reason i took one star away is because when I cut them they were very crumbly and the chocolate popped off a lot. I will make these again. maybe tweaking the timing of putting the chocolate on. i dunno but the crumbs left on the plate were yummy!

omg! you would not believe the women that are hounding me for this recipe! It is too good. I make it for all the knit nights I go too or if I host a party. They're such a hit and it is easy. If you have a stand mixer it is nothing to make this recipe.

Growing up, our middle school had a Peanut butter bar on the a la carte menu... They were so wonderful.  These taste the same!  I am so excited to finally get it right!

I'm not sure what I'm missing.  Maybe I just had high hopes because of the previous reviews.  I made the recipe exactly as listed, and found it to be way to greasy.  One reviewer had success with just one stick of butter which might make it a little better.  It was edible, but nothing special for me.

I usually don't care for peanut-buttery stuff, but these are good and addictive. I melted the butter with the peanut butter and put approx 1 3/4 cups graham cracker crumbs instead of 2 cups. Popped the pan in the FREEZER for 10 minutes or so,  then added the chocolate. After that I let the chocolate harden and cut them in bite sized pieces. Holds together great.   For those of you who have trouble getting them out of the pan, dip the pan in warm water for 30-60 secs before cutting;works like a charm.

These were very easy and my husband, dad and friend all thought they tasted great.  The downside is that they are too soft when they weren't straight out of the fridge!  Followed the recipe exactly, need to hold together a little more.

And it was really hard o get them out , i had to re-cut them and shoe a kife underneath. Does anyone have a tip for that? Otherwise great recipe !

If u like Reeses peanut butter cups (I do!!!!) you'll love these! They turned out great but don't have as near as much chocolate topping as it has in the picture. Maybe add one more Tbl. of peanut butter and another half cup of chocolate chips...?

i have made these many times for dessert buffets.  they always are the first thing to go.  when people see them in the freezer (i keep them in the freezer until serving time) they even break into them before i get to put them out.  if i have some around, i add a handful of butterscotch chips to the peanutbutter to the melted butter.  and if your chocolate breaks (always happens to me), just add a little cream or half and half to it.

It was very messy. I put it in the freezer so it would have some shape to it. This did not work.It did not have the consistence of bars. It tasted great though.

These are amazing!  I made about 8 desserts for Thanksgiving and these were the first to go.  I put the peanut butter mixture in the dish and put it in the freezer while I melted the chocolate and it seemed to work perfectly.

Really great recipe! So delicious! I made these with natural peanut butter and reduced the amount of sugar slightly. My husband thought they were VERY sweet, and I agreed, I think I'd try going down to a cup and a half sugar, and one and half sticks butter too. overall - AWESOME!

These are pretty good.  Whatever you do though do NOT melt the peanut butter.  It breaks down the peanut butter and makes it "greasy" and add that to the already too much butter and the crust comes out too "gooey".  I can't stress this enough... DO NOT melt the pb with the butter.  In my opinion the recipe calls for  too much butter.  I would suggest dropping it down to 3/4 cup of butter.  They came out way too rich.   Tips and tricks: If you want you can add a couple tablespoons of milk while melting the chocolate  to thin it out a bit and it won't make it as rich. Adding peanut butter to the chocolate (while melting) is pointless I think.  I didn't add the pb to the chocolate and it came out just fine. Not bad, but if I make them again I will use a few tweeks for the recipe.

Really good follow the tips in  other review and let base chill for about 15 min. before  topping w/chocolate and then chill again for about 20 min.  and cut. Chill after that for the remainder. The  ratios are good and I would say if  you  add too much graham cracker or peanut buttter there  won't be enough moisture and they will be crumbly. So measure.

I've been looking for a peanut butter bar recipie from when I was a child, and still have not found it, BUT WOW, this one is good.  Very easy to make.  Only problem was I wanted to eat the whole pan. A very simple dessert that will please many.

This is so incredible, and made better only by the fact that they are completely fool proof.  I put the peanut butter portion in the fridge while I metled the topping... it was flawless.  We let it set and went to town!  I can see us making this at LEAST once a week.  I cant wait to do it again!

Yummy!!!  I tried these out for the first time by making them for my son's football team.  My family loved it, suddenly my son had 30 new best friends, and one of the coaches asked my husband if he could ask me out on a date.  Ok...so any recipe that would do all that has to rate as a 5 star recipe!  I made as is directed and they turned out great!  I did put in the fridge for about 10 min before adding the chocolate topping.  They cut better if cool but close to room temp. If too warm it gets messy.  I stored refrigerated.

When non-peanut butter lovers attack these like they are the last morsel of food on the planet, it's a good thing. ;-)  The recipe is easy, although pressing the graham/butter/sugar mixture into the pan and making sure it's smooth, took a little bit of time.  I took the advice of others and put the crust in the freezer for about 15 minutes prior to pouring the chocolate on, and it definitely made it not sink in to the crust.. yay.  In order to cut these so that they are neat, I put them in the fridge for an hour to "set up".  The only problem with that is that the chocolate topping separates from the crust, when you start cutting them!  Yikes!  So, the remedy is that after you bring it out of the fridge, leave it out for about 15-20 minutes and then cut.  That way, the chocolate begins to soften enough to adhere to the crust, yet isn't too soft to create a messy cut.  These are very yummy, but also very rich - so keep that in mind when cutting them into squares. :)  Mine were a little bit larger than bite-sized.  Picture, added!   Oh, and I used 1.5 sticks (3/4 cup) butter instead of 2 sticks (1 cup).

I have always loved Reeses Peanut butter cups - and these bars are like Reeses Peanut butter cups from heaven. Everyone in the family LOVED them; my Dad said he could eat a whole pan. I've made them twice and they disappear every time. Be sure to pound your graham crackers into very fine crumbs if you like a smoother texture. Awesome recipe!!

Super yummy!  The peanut butter part of the bars came out a little mushy...I would suggest using a little less butter like other people have suggested.  That is one reason I gave this recipe only 4 stars...the other reason is that when I was melting the butter in the microwave, I was careless and must have left it in there for too long.  As I was taking the bowl out of the microwave, I started to stir it with a spatula and it EXPLODED all over me and the kitchen.  My wrist and hand got burned pretty badly.  Apparently because of the high water content in butter, it has a tendency of superheating and possibly exploding; especially when using a glass bowl (which is what I used).  So please be careful when melting things in the microwave!  After the incident, I cleaned up, and kept going with the recipe...taking the bars to a BBQ tonight, hopefully everyone likes them!

These bars are the best! Everyone says they are better than Reese's PB Cups. I was skeptical because im not a Huge fan of graham crackers but they were amazing!  I didnt make any changes to the recipe. The Peanut butter this recipe calls for equaled one small jar of PB and the choc chips equal a little less than one bag. I will be making these again. possibly for my christmas cookie trays.

This was OK. I personally did not really like them. They were just not that PB tasting. That being said, I took them to a BBQ this weekend and they were all eaten.

These were delicious!  Flavor was good.  I would use a little less butter next time.  We had to keep them refrigerated because the bottom layer got really soft otherwise.

I only had enough peanut butter to make a half recipe.  I used 1/2 cup magarine and 3/4 cup of peanut butter. I'm pretty sure that I'll be making another full recipe when I get back from the store.  My husband is thrilled with what he called a giant peanut butter cup!  UPDATE: I haven't made a full recipe of these bars and I don't think I will.  I'm pretty sure my husband would make himself sick if I made a bigger batch.  I'll wait for company to make the full recipe.

This recipe couldn't be simpler. Followed it as written, but cut the bars into 24 bite-sized pieces, because they are very rich!   One note: if you refrigerate them overnight like I did, take them out of the fridge and let them come up to room temperature before cutting into squares. I didn't wait long enough the first try and ended up cracking the chocolate top. Had to eat those, dangit! These were a HUGE hit at 'girls night'. Thanks for posting the recipe!

These were very rich!  I definitely cut down on the amount of butter (and obviously still very rich).  I took the suggestions of previous users and made sure to refrigerate the mixture prior to adding the chocolate/peanut butter topping.  After pouring the chocolate/peanut butter topping, I placed back in the fridge again, but made sure to cut them in very small squares prior to hardening completely.  I made these for a cookout the day before; very simple to make but incredibly fattening.  Would definitely suggest only make for a large group of people, unless you are looking to gain 10 pounds!

Yum Yum Yum!!!   These are delicious.  I follow the recipe exactly and they turn out great!!  Heavenly.  They are so rich that you only need a small bite so I like to cut the squares very small.  Thanks for satisfying my peanut butter chocolate craving!

I modified the recipe a bit due to not having enough graham crackers (added flour til dough was firm) and used semi-sweet bakers chocolate.  They were a huge hit with family and can tell I will make this often.

When a recipe is this easy and tastes this good, it deserves a 5-star rating.  I think you could easily cut back on the butter by 4 tablespoons without altering the taste.  As recommended, let first layer chill and harden before adding chocolate layer and cut through topping shortly after hardening to prevent separation of peanut butter layer and chocolate layer. Think I'll try it with milk chocolate morsels next time.  Good recipe!

This is a good recipe but could be better. Unfortunately, I didn't have any grahm crackers so I supstituted it. It still turned out well but it was very rich. Overall a 4 star recipe that I will definately keep :)

Very good!!  I used 1 1/2 sticks of butter and had to use a smaller pan so they took a bit longer to set up. I also melted the peanut butter into the butter which made my life simpler. I wish I would have cut them before they totally set up though because the chocolate keeps breaking away from the peanut butter.  But the flavors were spot on, and VERY VERY easy to make!

Just made some of these and am sampling a piece as I write this...delicious! One hint I've always used in recipes like this is to bang the pan on a countertop a few times on order to make sure the peanut butter/graham mixture is evenly distributed.  All in all though, terrific recipe!

These were incredible!  They were so simple to make and were a hit with everyone who tried them.  I think they are better than peanut butter cups.  I put mine in the fridge over night and then drove six hours with them in the car.  They were perfect!

I have been using a similar recipe for years with the exception of adding the peanut butter to the chocolate chips.  ***WARNING*** It's best to make these if you are able to share with others, otherwise you will wind up eating most of the pan!!! They are that good!

I cut down the butter to 3/4 cup.  Next time, I'll cut down on the graham cracker crumbs a little bit, as I'd like to taste more PB.  They were still delicious and so easy!!

These are soooooo good! They do taste like peanut butter cups. I didn't have enough butter and ended up using about 2/3 cup and still came out fine. The second time I had marshmallows and I melted them and incorporated them in the graham cracker mixture, and still came out really good (still using less butter and in this case also 3/4 cup of peanut butter as well). I've used all types of chocolate with this. Good all the time.

I made these and sent them to work with my husband.  The office raved about them.  Per other reviews, I chilled the base 20 minutes before pouring on the topping, then sliced into squares after about 25 minutes in the fridge.  The only thing I will do different next time is let them sit at room temp at least 20 minutes before serving (the base layer is slightly grainy coming right from the fridge), and I will cut them in smaller bars, as they are RICH.

Off the Charts! These are sinfully delicious! They remind me alot of a a Girl Scout Peanut Butter Patty. I think I would double the recipe and put it in the 9x13 pan. Small servings are better because these are rich! Yummy!

Very good but, in my opinion, a little too sweet.  Next time I will definately decrease the amount of sugar AND will make a thinner layer of chocolate.  Otherwise it was great and the texture was yummy.  I took this to all my neighbors on Fat Tuesday and they all raved about them - PB and Chocolate is a winning combination.

Very easy to make and so good!  The only thing I did differently was added about 1/4 cup more peanut butter for a stronger peanut butter flavor.  Amazing!

DELICIOUS!   I used chunky peanut butter since that is what I had on hand. I liked the texture alot and could hardly notice the pieces in the chocolate topping. I did use a mixture of milk choc and semi-choc chips since it was what I had on hand, and I do think the addition of milk chocolate makes cutting into squares easier. Easy, rich, decadent! This is now my go-to peanut butter bar recipe, thanks for sharing!!

The bottom (peanut butter mix) part of this was really good and did taste a lot like a Reese's peanut butter cup, but the semi-sweet chocolate wasn't doing it for me (although I did forget to mix in the 4 T peanut butter with it).  I will definitely use milk chocolate chips if I make this again.  The texture of the peanut butter cup part is really good.

If you want your bars to look like the tantalizing featured photo, don't use a 13x9 pan.  Go smaller.  I used a full 12 oz. bag of chocolate chips (about a 1/2 cup more than the recipe called for) and it was just right.

5-star PLUS.  I scaled the recipe way back to make a sweet treat just for me!  I divided the pnut butter mixture up between 4 paper baking liners and froze for several hours before adding the chocolate layer.  Then back into the freezer...just peel off the paper and you're good to go...no sticking or cutting problems.

Wow, this recipe is fantastic.  I used this recipe for my Christmas candy platters that I hand out to special friends.  This is definitely a keeper.  Be sure to cut the bars in exactly one hour.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was easy to measure, mix, and chill. But when I took it out of the fridge after more than "at least one hour" to cut into squares, it crumbled under my knife.  The chocolate cracked and separated from the base, and the base itself just broke into tiny pieces.  Maybe the graham cracker crumbs were too dry (they had been in my pantry quite a while)?  If so, then be sure you use FRESH graham cracker crumbs-- don't let what happened to me happen to you!

I made these exactly as written, with the exception of using milk chocolate chips rather than semi-sweet & they turned out phenomenal!  Better than store-bought PB cups.  Better than my old, similar recipe.  The chocolate is so creamy with the addition of the peanut butter & using milk chocolate really enhanced this.  It's like very smooth fudge on top of a Reese cup center.  Definitely helped to melt or at least soften the peanut butter with the butter.  Very, Very, Very, VERY good!!!  Thank you for posting this.

Very good, but after cooling for 2 hours, they were still coming out of the pan kind of messy and I had to mash them together.  I followed the recipe exactly, so I don't know what caused it.  Still very delicious!

I made these for my boyfriend and didn't get a good review. I don't like sweet stuff so I only nibbled one and it seemed fine to me but he only ate one and then hid the rest in the back of the fridge (I think he was afraid to tell me he didn't like them.) He is a fussy eater though so perhaps it is much more his issue than the recipe.

Is there a more perfect combination?  Peanut butter and chocolate??  LOVE IT.  Brought these into work and got rave reviews and some new friends :o)  I melted 1 1/2 sticks of butter with the peanut butter to help the sitrring process.  I also used 3 cups of graham cracker crumbs and used a 7x11....it doesn't get any easier than this....thanks Nancy!

SO GOOD! Sinful almost :) I cut the butter by 1/4-1/2, which made the crust a little more crumbly, but I could not bring myself to use 2 sticks of butter! I did not have graham cracker crumbs on hand so used Nilla Wafers, which I put in a food processor. Will keep this recipe for sure

These tasted good, but were EXTREMELY crumbly.  I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan, but those were the only changes I made to the recipe, besides chilling the dough for a few minutes before adding the chocolate, like other reviewers suggested.  I chilled the bars for about two hours, and when I sliced them, the chocolate broke into pieces, which made it hard to have even bars.  The bars didn't have much flavor right after they were chilled, but I liked them a lot more once they had been in room temperature for several hours and the chocolate had softened a bit.

Perfection for the sweet tooth!!! I didn't have enough butter. I only used 1 stick melted but not hot. I upped the pb for the crust just a tad to make up for not enough butter. I heated the bp for about 20 secs in the micro just to make it easier to mix and added the 1 tsp. of vanilla others had talked about. Everything worked out just fine. While I was melting a full 12 oz. bag of semi-sweets and the remaining pb I put the pan of crust in the freezer then spread the topping on when it was done melting and refridgerated. Ate about 3 pieces a few hours later and YUM!!! Perfect.

A friend gave me this recipe in high school and it's one of my favorites to make.  I usually soften the peanut butter for a few seconds in the microwave to make it easier to mix in the graham crackers.  You can also try using chunky peanut butter.

Very Good! I didn't have problems with mixing the bottom layer like other reviews.  My peanut butter was room temp and that might help.  If you like peanut butter and chocolate anything -- you'll love these!  I followed recipe exactly!  I cut for the first time after 2 hours, easily came out of the pan.  I will keep in refrigerator...it's summertime!

These taste just like a Reese's but better!  This was very easy to make (no baking) and everyone went crazy over them

These were fabulous.  I only used 1 and 1/2 sticks of butter, as another reviewer recommended, and replaced the rest with more peanut butter.  I suggest food processing the cracker crumbs for the best texture.

Delicious recipe!! We are crazy for chocolate peanut butter in my house - so it was a big hit! Followed the recipe (maybe added a pinch more peanut butter due to personal taste preference) except that I used a slightly smaller pan then 13 x 9. The peanut butter mix was spreading so thin and I wanted it a little thicker. Worked out great. I took other reviewers advice and put the pb mix in the pan and refrigerated for a few minutes before putting the chocolate layer on. I will definitely make this again!!!

I had such high hopes for this recipe. Followed it to the letter. Something just did not work. It tasted like there was too much butter. I did use generic peanut butter, I don't know if that makes a difference. The chocolate topping was good. Threw out the whole pan. :(

This recipe takes me way back...when I saw the bars I remember eating them when I was a kid, but I couldn't remember where.  While I was mashing up the graham crackers I remembered that I use to get these with my school lunch...it was one of the things I really liked at lunch time.  These turned out just like I remembered.  Thanks for sharing.  Here's a tip, smash the graham crackers in a ziplock bag.  Two packs of graham crackers equals about 2 cups.  After using the bag to smash the graham crackers use it when pressing the peanut butter mixture in the pan by putting it over your hand so you don't get messy.

These were a delicious, but a little rich.  I think they needed more chocolate.  I agree with another user and next time I'll probably make into balls and dip in the chocolate.

Used Smart Balance brand peanut butter the first time, and they were just OK. Used Reese's brand peanut butter the second time and they were GREAT!!  Also added a little butter to the chocolate mixture so it would not be so soft.  Thanks for the great recipe!

As the previous ratings and reviews stated...this is a really great recipe.  My family loved these.  I was making both lunch and supper for a fairly large group, so I went the easy route and purchsed grahm cracker crumbs instead of crunching them up myself.  The recipe called for about a half cup less than the amount that came in the box, so I ended up just adding a little more of each of the crust ingrediants until it was the right consistancy.  I put them in the fridge overnight, but let them sit out for 10 mins or so before I tried to cut them. They did not crumble at all and I was able to slice them pretty small (because they are very rich).  Yummy!

Wonderfully easy to make and eat!  VERY rich, so be careful on portion sizes, but VERY addictive!  Definitely melt the peanut butter WITH the butter - you can then mix everything together with just a spatula.  Also, use a food processor or a "Magic Bullet" to make your crumbs, makes them so fine and then they don't add texture (lumps) to your bars.  ENJOY! UPDATED: Two sleeves finely crushed is too much ... the bar gets crumbly (but it still tastes great!)  I'll update again when I get the mixture right for two full sleeves. :)

These were delicious! They taste just like Reese peanut butter cups! I think next time I would cut the butter to a stick and a half instead of 2 full sticks and up the peanut butter to 1 1/2 cups. Everyone loved these but they need to stay refrigerated so they don't get mushy! Mine got left out at a party and got pretty mushy but everyone enjoyed them anyways!! Will definately be making again!

yummy. so quick and easy. I used 1/4 cup less sugar and didn't miss it. I went ahead and used 12 oz of chocolate and melted just a 1 T of peanut butter in it. 
I left the PB mixture in the frig for 15 mins, then topped with the chocolate and refrigerated for 10 more mins. I then cut into squares and returned the pan to the frig to continue getting hard. This kept them in pretty little squares and I will repeat this procedure when making this recipe again.

These were great for a fast fix (a forgotten co-workers birthday). Everyone loved them! Very easy - had all the ingredients on hand. I think next time though I will use less Graham cracker crumbs as it was a little too grainy and not creamy enough. After preparing, I put them in the freezer for 10 minutes, sliced and then refrigerated.

I tried a different recipe before this one and this one is much better!  I only had milk chocolate chips, so I melted them with 1 tbs of shortening and only 3 tbs of peanut butter.  Delicious!

Living in Korea we can't get Reese's very easy.  These were WONDERFUL!!!  I didn't have chocolate chips but had white chocolate chips...mmmmmm  sooooo good!  Thanks for helping us get our Reese's fix! :)  I ended up using 1 1/2 bags of chips and used mini muffin papers.  Put a little of the white chocolate on the bottom a flattened ball next then more white chocolate to make it more like an actually Reese.  I had a lot of peanut butter mixture left over so then I put it in a 8x8 pan and melted a couple Hershey candy bars for the top (added peanut butter to chocolate like recipe says).  I liked the white chocolate better.  The actually bars were a little too sweet much more peanut butter mixture than the "Reese" style.  Thank you so much!!

I made these in cupcake cups.  Melted chocolate chips and peanut butter chips together and put some in the bottom of the paper cupcake cups, then the graham cracker mixture and topped off with more melted chocolate.  They were so good and you didn't have to worry about the peanut butter mixture going soft.  Adding peanut butter to the chocolate chips is the reason the chocolate was too soft.  All those that tried these said they were great, none but the brave could eat a whole peanut butter cup!  They are very rick!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were very good and super easy.  I good snack when it is too warm to turn the oven on.  I was a little nervous after mixing up the base, as it said "pat" into pan, but my mix was too wet to "pat", so I smoothed it into the pan, put it in the refridgerator for a little bit & they set up fine.

Very good! Made these last Friday. Took some to my parents and saved the rest for me! My bf (who says Reeses are not his favorite) really liked these. I did too, but next time, I will be sure to crush my graham crackers into very fine  crumbs to better suit my taste. I was sure I crushed my crackers really well, but I found the bars to have a subtle crunch to them (I am the only one who noticed this, so I guess I am just too picky!). Only modification I made was to sub milk chocolate chips for the semi-sweet variety. Prepared recipe to a T with great results. Thanks for sharing!

They are so easy to make, and will definately satisfy your peanut butter chocolate craving, just make sure your crumbs are very fine, mine weren't and the bar wasn't as smooth as i would have liked, also i added another 1/2 cup of peanut butter

I made this for the first time today.  Brought it to a friends house.  Everyone there liked it, however I thought it was too sweet and the bottom mixture was mushy.  I followed the directions to a "T" but it just didn't seem right.  I put the pan in the freezer to firm it up.  Not sure I will try again inspite of the compliments, just didn't settle right with me.

I reduced the confectioner's sugar to 1 1/2 cups based on other reviews, and omitted the peanut butter from the chocolate topping. The only mistake I made was in using an 8x8 pan, which resulted in thicker bars. I wouldn't do this again, as I thought it made the bars a little intense. But everyone seemed to love them!

These are highly addictive and SO easy!!!  Most of these ingredients we have on hand too.

I would recommend popping the peanut butter mixture into the freezer for a few minutes while you melt the chocolate so that it gets firm and doesn't mix with the chocolate when you spread it on.

These are a huge hit at parties.

These were great!  I didn't have chocolate chips, so I used bakers chocolate instead.  I also used natural peanut butter and they turned out fine.  I followed the suggestions to chill the peanut butter mixture while I melted the chocolate and it was perfect!  Thanks!

Absolutely delicious, but very rich.  They definitely need to go in the fridge for a while to set, but they are well worth it.  I think I'm going to use the parchment paper next time to line the pan though.

I'd give it five stars for how easy this is, but I wasn't that impressed. Took it to a bbq, everyone loved it, but still had squares left on the plate. I cut them into pretty small squares since they are very sweet. My husband who is a peanut butter chocolate fanatic thought they were "ok". Will leave it in my recipe box, but not sure I'll make again.

Worked really well! Everyone thought this was absolutely delish, so for all the great reviews and how unbelievably easy it is, it gets five starts. I only had 1 cup of graham cracker crumbs, so I subbed 1 cup of corn flakes (processed to fine crumbs).  I also used milk chocolate chips.  People said it tasted like a peanut butter cup with a crispy texture.  Thanks so much!  I'll definitely make this in the future.  It is popular, yummy, and fast!

Very easy to make but we thought the peanut butter part had a weird texture--maybe I should have left the graham cracker crumbs bigger.  ALMOST tastes like peanut butter cups.

Made 1/2 recipe and used an 8x8 glass square pan. Melted butter in microwave in the glass pan. Then added sugar and graham crackers. Used cheap cinnamon graham crackers crumbed in food processor. I put the pan in the fridge while I measured and heated the peanut butter and chocolate chips in the microwave. Seemed it had more cracker base than chocolate topping. Next time I would use a bit less of bottom layer and 1 cup total of chocolate topping. If I was bringing it to company I would have made the 9x13 pan or served it in paper cupcake holders, otherwise the 8x8 size is the perfect dessert just for us -yummy and easy!

These were so delicious and so easy to make! I only made a half recipe, and was a tad short of graham crackers so I used 3/4 cup graham cracker and 1/4 cup saltine cracker. So delicious! Not too sweet this way, the saltines and the sweetness mixed perfectly!

These were definitley tasty- just got a bit gooey at room temperature.  The peanut butter layer was more runny than I had anticipated, we had to use silverware!  One suggestion, if not the grahm crackers, you could use rice crispies.. I make a similar a recipe in which I use rice crispies cereal and it also adds a nice crunch.

These are so good if you love peanut butter and chocolate!  I like to put the pan in the freezer for about 20 minutes or so.  Then once you get your chocolate/peanut butter melted when you add it to the base it sets much faster.  Plus I love my desserts cold!  Anyway you end up doing them... they are delicious and so fast and easy!

So fanfreakin'tastic! Taste just like Reeses. Rich, delicious and totally hit the spot. The only thing that I did different was that I did not add the extra peanut butter to the chocolate. I wanted just a plain chocolate layer on top. What a treat!

WOW...I can't say enough about this recipe, these are to die for!  I followed the recipe to the T, except I melted the peanut butter with the butter before adding it to the other mixture.  Stuck it in the freezer for a 30 minutes to set up and the bars were perfect!

UNBELIEVABLE!  These things are awesome.  Yummy and soooo easy.  Really, no bake?  I thought I was dreaming.  I told my friend to open her mouth and take a bite.  I gave her a little piece and she shrugged.  I told her it wasn't Reese's and she flipped.  They taste exactly like the pb cups in the bag but way cooler.  :)

These bars are so easy to make and really taste like Reese's cups. I crush the graham crackers in a blender or food processor to make the process even faster and easier. My friends all love it when I make these. Even my husband who doesn't really eat dessert likes these. I cut them into much smaller pieces than this recipe suggests. They are very rich!

I have made these twice recently and got the same result both times...they tend to come out with too much of a butter flavor.  It was sort of good, but the butter was just a bit too strong.  Not sure if reducing the butter a little will help or not!  I also agree that it needs to have more of a pb flavor so possibly adding more into the mixture will help with that.  Not sure I will make again as I ended up throwing both batches away and it is sort of costly to make.

I used to make a similar recipe , since the early 90's.
I moved after 17 years and couldn't find my old recipe, and used this one.
I was very disappointed in the outcome.
It was very grainy and i could hardly spread the topping. After it had cooled, the dessert was "crumbly" and the chocolate topping split when cutting,despite using a hot knife.
Addendum....I just found my old recipe ...I will stick to that one....   thanks anyway

I just left a recipe party where I took these bars. They were the first item gone and everybody raved about them. I found that putting the graham crackers in a food processor really helped to get them to the consistency needed for the bottom layer. Overall, they were a hit!

How tasty and how easy! I was out of butter, so I used Country Crock spread, worked out fine. Also, I used reduced-fat peanut butter and it worked out fine. I opted to microwave the chocolate chips/peanut butter - only had to microwave for 1 minute (stirring after 30 seconds, then again after another 30). I personally love the taste of semi-sweet chocolate, but if you really want these to taste like peanut butter cups, use milk chocolate chips instead. Oh, also I only had to refrigerate these for an hour, then I used a small square cookie cutter to cut out the bars, then cut them in half diagonally to make triangles. You could use any shape of cookie cutter with these: circles, diamonds... but I think too intricate of shapes would be hard (also, you may get a lot of left over scraps if you use circles, but those are for you to eat!).

WOW!!!  I've been searching for the perfect peanut butter bar recipe and this is most definately it!  The perfect blend of peanut butter and sweetness. As other reviewers stated, I also think this tasted like peanut butter cups, just not as rich, which is just the right flavor for a bar.  I used 1/2 cup butter instead of 1 cup and it turned out great.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!!!

My fiance and I loved this recipe. While the chocolate was still warm I sprinkled peanut butter chips over the top to add a different texture. Next time I will try dark chocolate. The semi-sweet was good but it seemed like it could be better. Also make sure that you sift the confectioners sugar. It will get lumpy on you and not mix in well.

I made these the other day, and they were fabulous!  They taste just like the real thing.  Both my husband and children loved them so much the pan was gone by the next day.  Great recipe.

These are to-die-for delicious!  I usually use milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet for personal taste reasons and they are a hit every single time.  Even my husband who almost never eats sweets will devour these.

Ridiculous! If you think you're just going to leave these around the house and somehow manage to control yourself, FORGET IT! The most amazing thing about these bars is how fast they disappear. I used crunchy PB but don't think it made a difference.

Absolutely Yummy! I followed the recipe exactly, only instead of using a 9x13 pan, I put them into 2 8 inch pans, to make two GIANT Peanut Butter Cups that can be sliced like a pie or cake. Fit perfectly this way. Was really easy to work with considering all that peanut butter!

Not as good as I was hoping, but I think I'll try it again with milk chocolate instead.

EDIT: I made them again with milk chocolate chips... perfect.  Just perfect!  Everyone LOVED them!

This is a great recipe for kids to help create.  The melting can all be done in the microwave.  We didn't have graham crackers the last time we made it and used animal crackers instead, it was even better! We may never make it with graham crackers again.

My chocoholic family loved these!  I used milk chocolate in place of semi-sweet but didn't change anything else.  I thought the graham cracker crumbs added texture and my family thought I used chunky peanut butter!  I definitely like the added texture.  These are very rich...almost like a chocolate-peanut butter fudge.  And yes, they do taste like peanut butter cups.  I'm sure I will be asked to make these often!

I made these as they sounded simple and had ingredients that most bakers have on hand.  I also used milk chocolate. They are delicious, even my husband who is not a chocolate fan enjoyed them.  My parents also thought they were great.  What combination is better then chocolate and peanut butter?

I feel like it's missing something--real Reeses's cups are saltier so may add a bit of salt next time.  I think I'd also like to try this with milk chocolate as others have stated.  I LOVE peanut butter so will probably try again.  Thanks!

These taste SO good and are very easy to make.  Mine didn't come out of the pan very neatly because I used both low fat peanut butter and margarine, but they still taste great.  I'll be making these again.  Thanks!

The only problem I had was cutting through the top layer of chocolate while cutting them into bars, after chilling them. So I set them at room temperature to soften, but then the bottom peanut butter layer was too soft to lift out of the pan, so back in the fridge they went to harden and cut again! Very tasty, though. These are perfect with a cold glass of milk! Yummy!

I wasn't terribly impressed with this, although my son liked them.  Luckily, I only halved the recipe because I wouldn't want to eat much of it. I love PB Cups, but these didn't taste much like them in my opinion.

So easy...and SOOOO rich!  If you are a big lover of peanut butter and chocolate, you'll love this recipe.  Make sure you have a big glass of ice cold milk!  Oh, and if you like PB a lot, you can up the PB and lower the butter by 1/2 cup with good results.  Also, if you are one of those who are having trouble with crumbling of the bar while cutting after refrigerating, make sure you bring the bar back up to or nearly room temp for easy cutting.  Update - today I made this recipe with 1.5 cups rolled oats that had been processed fine in a food processor and 1/2 cup wheat bran.  Also only 1/2 cup of butter and 1.5 cups PB.  And only 1 cup of choc. chips.  Very good results, mildly healthier.

Very easy and tasty. The only problem I had was that I didn't get my graham cracker crumbs fine enough, and so there were chunks in it, but it still tasted great. Does get a little soft unrefridgerated.

I'm dishing out 5 stars for this one!  Super easy and extremely good, especially if you're a fan of Reese's cups- they're just like them... in square form.  If you're not much of a baker, you can't go wrong here- they taste like way more work.  Yum!  (Oh, and I keep them refrigerated... they do get a bit melty at room temp.  Not that I still wouldn't eat them.)

These are very good !! Easy to make and they taste delicious when you are done !! Much easier to make than "buckeyes" at Christmas time. I will gladly make these instead !!!! I made a double recipe and had some leftover. I froze them in the freezer like I do the peanut butter cups !! I'm sure they will taste wonderful !!

These were awesome.  I made for a party and these were gone before everything else.  Everyone asked for the recipe.  I added additional graham cracker crumbs and made 1.5 of the chocolate topping.  My husband is begging for more.

WOW!!!! I ran across this recipe and had to try it right away to see if they really are like Reese Peanut Butter Cups (my favorite), and they didn't disappoint! Amazing likeness except with a little less chocolate. But great nevertheless! So easy to make and I had all the ingredients already on hand (except that I used milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet). Thanks so much -- this will be a definite favorite! I can't wait to make some for my mom, also a peanut butter-and-chocolate fanatic.

Incredibly easy to make and yummy too!  Depending on how goopy your peanut butter is, use between 2-3 cups of graham crackers, adding a little at a time after the first two cups until the mixture is easy to spread and not so sticky.

I had to add nearly one more cup of powdered sugar. Perhaps the recipe writer got confused, and meant to type one stick of butter rather than one cup? Or maybe when typing, the finger hit the 2 rather than the 3 for powdered sugar? As written the peanut butter/ cracker layer is soupy. I just added more sugar to make a dough that looked similar to the video. Many other reviewers said theirs was too thin as well, so there has to be a mistake somewhere. It tasted great, but just be warned of the extra needed powdered sugar.

Made exactly as instructed, using butter. I am a professional baker, and this is my Pro tip: if you use margarine, don’t use the stuff from the tub, use the hard stuff that comes wrapped like butter. The higher fat content is what will make it set properly. 
I lined my 9x13 with parchment paper so the bars would easily lift out of the pan. I also used plastic wrap over the peanut butter layer to press it down and smooth out. The plastic then peels right off and gives a nice even surface for coating with the chocolate layer. 
I thought they were great, my husband said they resembled fudge too much for his liking. 
These took about 10 minutes to make, I chilled them about 30 minutes, cut, and then chilled about an hour longer. 
I will definitely make them again, and will try reducing the butter a little bit and upping the peanut butter in the first layer. A sprinkle of coarse salt on top would be a nice addition too!

I don’t put the peanut butter in the chocolate. Also, I make these with Wowbutter. They taste just the same. I am allergic to peanut and tree nuts so I improvise.

This was easy to make.  Might be good to clarify amount of peanut butter in step two, for those of us that skip around while making a recipe.  I accidentally used a cup with the chocolate chips instead of 4 tablespoons, though don't think it will matter too much.  Will update if needed once we taste it.  Is for my husband's birthday treat, said he remembers them serving something like this in the lunchroom when he was a kid.  We'll see if it lives up!  Lol

This was trying to be candy. Not a cookie bar. Showed up top of the list when searching for peanut butter cookie bar. It was so sweet and mushy. I threw out the whole batch. Was going to bring to someone’s party but that would be embarrassing. I’ll have to stop at the bakery now. What a waste of time and money. I don’t know why this had high ratings unless your looking for a sugar high. May as well buy Reese’s cups. Disgusting

I love this recipe, My grandmother made peanut butter balls, which this recipe was as close as I could get to hers. I used  1 stick of butter or sometimes a stick and a half. And instead of using chocolate I use melted almond bark which taste great and melts nicely and when cooled coats very well. Will always use this recipe and we make this quite often.

2 cups of sugar is too sweet imho. Decreased to 1 1 1/2 cups for second batch and that was ok. Easy to make. Great recipe to make with kids since there’s no eggs/salmonella concerns when they lick their fingers lol.

These are great...even if you do forget to add the powdered sugar (didn't miss the sweetness though).  Only issue I had was they split apart pretty easy if you don't let them cool down enough.

We absolutely love these, and it's so easy the kids (11 & 14) can make them on their own!  They love to make them with their friends when they are over, because it's such a quick recipe that they always get to reap what they sow.  We use the coffee grinder to get the graham crackers super finely ground.  I also always cut the sugar nearly in half (peanut butter has sugar, graham crackers have sugar, chocolate chips have sugar, so I find 2 cups of added sugar to be way too sweet, and the kids devour them all the same).  We also learned to line the pan with wax paper so it doesn't stick.  We've made it with different kinds of peanut butter (standard creamy, standard crunchy, and natural creamy).  Both creamy blends worked out great, but the crunchy was a little weird to us.  

My 11-yo son and I just finished making a batch so we can bring some over to our college girl neighbors for Christmas - we know they're gonna love it!

Great recipe. The second time I used 1/2 cup plus two tablespoons of butter instead the 1cup and 2 cups chocolate chips instead of lesser amount.  Beat it with a hand mixer at least two minutes. Make sure you sift your powdered sugar before spooning it into your measuring cup. It's a keeper. Thank you.

These bars are amazing. I didn't feel like baking but needed something to take to a cookie exchange. Came to Allrecipes and found this no bake recipe. They were a star attraction.  All I heard were ooohs and aaahs...lol.  

I did follow a few suggestions from the reviews. 
I mixed the peanut butter in with the butter as I slowly melted it over low heat. 
I also used a full 12 oz bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips (2 cups) which made a perfect thickness topping for a 9X13 pan. 
I added 6 Tbs of butter to the chocolate and peanut butter topping. That suggestion was excellent as it really helped the chocolate topping adhere to the base perfectly so it wouldn't crack and separate. 
Before putting the graham cracker base in my 9x13 Pyrex glass dish, I cut a piece of parchment paper to line the bottom of the dish without extending into the corners. That made it very easy to just lift the bars out of the dish when I was ready to plate them. 
I cut the bars after being the in frig for about 25 minutes and then refrigerated them overnight.  
I had 4 bars left over. I was afraid I'd eat them too quickly if I left them in the frig to see every time I opened the door so I decided to try freezing them. OMG..they freeze beautifully AND they taste fantastic right out of the freezer. Yep, I ate them...one each evening until they were gone. 

I'll make these over and over again but not too often. The weight would pile on because they are so addictive so I'll try to remember each one is basical

I used Skippy Natural Peanut Butter, and then filling ended up being a bit dry and not sweet enough. My wife didn't think they tasted anything like a Reese's. I think if I make this again, I'll add more confectioners sugar and make a half batch.

These peanut butter bars were absolutely amazing! My entire family, even the ones who don’t love Reese’s peanut butter cups, devoured them. They were a huge hit!

Make these bars all the time.  Easy to make in the microwave.  I do add 3T peanut butter and 1/4 cup butterscotch chips to the frosting.  This is always a crowd favorite.

I made this recipe with 1 cup of melted butter but it was watery with only 2 cups of graham cracker crumbs so I added about 2 more graham crackers and it turned out less watery! :D Taste very good!

Everyone that has tried this when I have made it, LOVES this recipe!

I have been asked to share it with everyone who has tried it when I have made it.

It tastes exactly like Reeces Peanut Butter Cups, and is very easy to make!!!

Make sure to set aside some for yourself before serving, I can guarantee there will be none left if you leave them out for guests!

These were really yummy. I could probably just have used 3/4 cup of melted butter though. Or added some oatmeal. I may try that next time.

I've made this exact recipe for over 22 years , so I loved seeing here ! My entire family / friends begs me to make these several times a year - they are so easy to make & taste So close to the real Reese's cups . I make a big batch and just break them apart & place them in the freezer with parchment paper in between layers . My husband enjoys them cold like that , but they thaw in min .. for those who don't want to break their teeth on the hard chocolate ; )

Edited the recipe a little bit on the 3rd try: cut sugar in half, used chunky peanut butter instead of creamy (for more texture and peanut butteriness), and finally, used dark chocolate (67%) instead of semi-sweet. I am so far happy with the outcome. For easy clean up, I cut  parchment paper  to fit the pan.  
Tip: heat up the knife before you cut them into bars!

Very good. I prefer using milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet for desserts, but went by the recipe. Next time, will use milk chocolate chips-I just think they will taste better.

I used parchment to help cleanup and to remove it from the pan before cutting. Also used the freezer so it only took 5-10 minutes from ingredients to eating. People might be right about half the butter. It was so runny I added more Graham’s, sugar and PB. It could be ok but I didn’t want to chance it. Tastes just like Reese’s.

Really simple recipe that doesn’t take a lot of time. My peanut butter/crust mixture was very runny after mixing, had to let it set a bit on its own before adding the chocolate on top and setting again.

I made this for Super Bowl Sunday and my nephews and husband loved it.  I myself thought the graham cracker crust too thick.  It was much easier than making Buckeyes. Made this a second time and followed some peoples suggestions.  I ground my graham cracker crumbs in a food processor, melted the peanut butter into the butter and cooled the crumb, peanut butter , confectionery sugar before topping with chocolate.  Liked this second version better.

It was very good.  It was easy to make and it tastes like a peanut-butter cup.  I will make this again but maybe make 2x the chocolate so i can put it on the bottom also.

If you want bars that taste like you are eating dough, these are the bars for you. They are reminiscent of Reese's peanut butter cups with the creamy peanut butter bottom. However, just know before you make them, that that is what you are getting yourself into.

These are fantastic and simple.  The peanut butter is not overpowering, I added more chocolate.    Makes two 8x8 trays, lots to share.  To cut you have to set them on the counter for a bit to soften.

WOW! Tastes like the Real McCoy! Everyone loved it! I made a few minor changes. I put the crackers in a sandwich zip lock bag and used a rolling pin to pulverize them. I used just under 2 cups of crackers only because that's all I had. Thank goodness, it was enough. I also just used 1 1/2 sticks of butter as apposed to 2 sticks. I poured the peanut butter mixture over a parchment paper lined 9 X 13  pan. The pan was put in the fridge for 20 minutes to harden. As for the chocolate top, I used a whole bag (12 oz) of semi-sweet morsels instead of 1 1/2 cups.  Pan went back in the fridge for 20, then I took out the parchment paper and cut those bad boys into small pieces. Very rich and delicious! Amazing!! Thanks for the recipe!

Not only has the taste but the texture also. Easy to make. I threw the peanut butter into the melted butter and blended, then added to the dry ingredients.

Soooo good and easy! These are always a hit at my house and with others. Probably the best recipe I have gotten on here yet. I added about 2 more pieces of graham cracker to the bottom layer and a little less sugar to make it thicker and added 2 tablespoons butter to the chocolate topping and put it in the freezer or fridge. It holds together perfect.

Giving it 4 stars because I made it with modifications! I used 3/4 cup of butter and about 1.5 cups of sugar and they were perfect! As is, I think the recipe would be too sweet and rich for my tastes, but these changes were perfect for me. I also followed some other suggestions and melted the butter and the peanut butter together, and soaked the graham crumbs in the mixture for a few minutes to soften them. Also, I think next time instead of using chocolate chips I will use 70% or 80% dark chocolate to cut the sweetness a bit more. Overall SO GOOD!!

Super easy! I made these for a bakesale and used a mini muffin pan. To mix the peanut butter mixture I used my food processor...easier then hand mixing it.

Everyone who tried these thought they tasted like buckeyes.  I recommend using natural peanut butter and some of its oil for easy mixing and then store them in the freezer. I'll likely make these 'buckeye bars' again.

We love these!  I've been making them for years.  We call them Reese's Bars.  They do have a harder chocolate top, but you can make them a tad softer by adding a bit of shortening too.  Also, I cut down on the butter a bit as well - just a tablespoon or less as we like them a little on the dryer side.  One more thing - if you combine the butter and peanut butter and melt in the microwave first, and then combine the powdered sugar and crumbs in a separate bowl, it makes combining everything a lot easier.  Our kids devour these within a day.

I made these with my young grandchildren and they were a big hit.  I froze most of the batch and brought them to a family get together later on at which they were an even bigger hit.  They do taste a lot like Reese's' peanut butter cups.

These are amazing! I used about 1/2 cup more peanut butter and 1 stick less of butter for the bottom and used chocolate bark mixed with the chocolate chips and the PB for top. The chocolate top was very smooth and creamy! oh, I used crunchy PB only in the bottom layer too. Great addition. Will definitely make over and over!

it tasted really good. i used milk chocolate chips and two hershey’s chocolate bars and it turned out great. The bottom didn’t set very well out of the fridge even after refrigerating it for 6 hours. Right out of the fridge though it looks exactly like the picture and tastes really yummy.

I have made these a few times now, and I love them! I usually cut the butter down to about 3/4 C. because they are really greasy otherwise, and lessening the butter doesn't decrease the flavor.

Awesome, easy and we loved them! My husband even said they reminded him of a Reese's Peanut Butter cup.
Was leery about using a hand mixer on low speed vs hand mixing but it worked out really well!

Tasted great and is quick and easy!  I added butter with the chocolate chips when I melted them so that it could be smooth, runny, and the perfect texture for spreading over the peanut butter mixture.

Loved this! I am a peanut butter fanatic. However, I didn't have any graham cracker crumbs. So I used bread crumbs (from my own home made bread!), with a little cinnamon, and the rest of the ingredients. Nobody can tell the difference!

Tastes exactly as described. What I did was cut the amount of peanut butter by half and I can say it definitely has a balance of chocolate and peanut butter. Melt the butter in a coffee cup with a paper towel on the top so it can help dissolve the graham cracker pieces.

Made a half batch, but mistakenly made full recipe of the chocolate topping-  turned out great!  Only used about 2 tbls peanut butter with the chocolate, and used half semi-sweet and half milk chocolate chips.  Will make the same way again.  Everyone loves them!

So these are super tasty, but they did not stay together as I feel like they should have. We basically had to eat them with a spoon because the peanut butter was crumbling. I did reduce the butter to 1.5 sticks as recommended in some reviews, I would probably stick with the recipe suggestion next time. Other changes I made were to reduce sugar by half (very happy I did, that was right level of sweetness), melted the peanut butter with the butter, and used dark chocolate instead of semi-sweet chocolate. These were a hit at my dinner party.

I've been trying to cut back on sugar and tried this recipe subbing whole wheat flour for the powdered sugar and it still tastes sweet enough.   You have to use a little more flour than you would sugar, about 3 cups instead of 2.   My kids didn't have a clue that I changed the recipe.

I'll definitely make these again. It's a good recipe to make with kids. Next time I will ensure the graham crackers are crushed finely and press the first layer into the pan better, as our were a bit crunchy and fell apart some. Tasted wonderful though!

Have made these a number of times.  Here in Israel, graham crackers are hard to get so I use "petit beurre" (tea biscuits) cookies and these turn out just fine.  I don't love the taste of the butter-flavoured margarine, so to make these pareve, I used two-quarters coconut oil, one-quarter butter-flavoured margarine, and one-quarter unflavoured margarine.  Sounds fiddly but they came out just right, and the flavour wasn't overwhelming.  I like to heat the PB with the margarine/coconut oil so it goes together evenly and quickly.
Delicious!

This tastes exactly like a Reese’s bar! We LOVED it over here!!! I used a 9 inch round as we wanted thick pieces. I took the liberty to add some crushed Reese’s pieces... yum! The only thing I would change for next time is to use milk chocolate chips for the top as the semi sweet was a tad bitter for a Reese’s... but I can’t complain because it was still so good! Thanks!

These taste just like Peanut  Butter  Cups...  I follow the recipe exactly with the exception of the pan size... I use a 9 X 9 pan as I prefer a thicker bar... So easy to make and everyone loves them.  Thank you... Update.. just a tip: If you want the chocolate layer on top to be perfect and shiny.. heat the chips and peanut butter on the stove top in a small heavy pot on low, when the chips are almost completely melted take the pan off the burner, add a small handful of chips and stir until melted.. then spread.

I made these for my neighbors and family. They requested more they loved them so much. Super easy to make and yields a good portion.  I will say that the crust is softer than I expected, but it didn't bother me.  I'll be making this again!

These taste great but the peanut butter base is too soft. We have to keep them in the fridge. I ended up cutting them into small squares and dipping them in chocolate to keep them from being so messy. Will try again but with some changes.

These were a hit.  I have made a similar recipe for years but in a ball and dipped in chocolate.  I was running short of time and tried this recipe , as per other reviews I reduced butter(1 1/2) and they seemed a little to dry next time I will use the amount listed or 1 3/4 stick butter.

I have made this for many years.  Now my grown children ask for them at the holidays.  I spread this mix in a 11 X 13 cookie sheet as the kids like them thinner.

I had tried a recipe like this once before and they came out too greasy. I decided to try this one with a few tweaks per other reviewers suggestions. I only used 1 1/2 sticks of butter and used the boxed graham cracker crumbs you can buy. I didn't use the boxed crumbs on the previous try and really felt it made a difference.  I also put the base in the fridge for 15 minutes before putting the chocolate topping on. And last 15 minutes into the fridge I hour sitting I took it out to cut so the chocolate topping wouldn't break. It had broke on my previous try and this really helped.  I took these to a family function. It was the only dessert any one touched not even the pumpkin pie.  Already planning on making in for Christmas.

I have made these per directions a few times. Every time the chocolate doesn’t stick to the peanut butter bottom.  Can’t figure out why. Tried putting the chocolate on at different times of chilling. Still does.

Fantastic recipe.  I used Christmas themed, mini muffin liners instead of a flat pan.  The presentation was lovely and I didn't have to worry about anything cracking or breaking because I didn't have to cut into bars. I will make these over and over again. Thank you for sharing!

The first time I had these, I though they were way too rich, but I learned to cut them small and family LOVES them!   This has become a standard dish when we ski.  It's super easy to make, practically fool-proof so you can push it off to the kids or husband, and it keeps so well, or can be nicely frozen.  I'm taking these to the shelter tonight.  A favorite now!

So good and soooo easy. I made these for a cookie exchange and saved some for me...Tasty with 2 of my favorite things, peanut butter and chocolate. They take very little time to make. I put the peanut butter mix in the pan, then refrigerated it for 15 minutes before adding the chocolate. Then, I put the whole thing in the fridge for 15 minutes to harden the chocolate a bit, then cut them with a sharp knife. Again, back to the fridge for an hour, then could re-cut them easily for good. After the first cut the chocolate had a nice swirl to it from being just semi-cool. Next time- I would use less confectioners sugar; make more of the chocolate topping. The peanut butter part was a little crunchy with the store-bought graham cracker crumbs, next time I'd soak them in the melted butter a bit. But- didn't take anything from the flavor!

This was a super fast bar cookie that didn’t use up oven time during the busy Christmas cookie making season.  I made the crust entirely in the food processor, crushing the graham crackers very finely (as per other commenters hints).  Used parchment paper to line the pan for easy removal and fast cleanup. Added some of the extra oil from the peanut butter into the melting chocolate to soften the texture for cutting.  I think that some folks didn’t add the extra peanut butter to the chocolate (as called for in the recipe), making it  shatter when cut.  Let it sit in the fridge overnite to set.  Removed from pan.  Stand at room temp for an hour. Heated the knife under hot water to cut into serving pieces.  Looks good and disappeared from the cookie tray in record time.  This one’s a keeper!

Great recipe. Super easy! My fiancé loves peanut butter and he said this recipe reminds him of Reese cups! (Don’t recommend trying to melt caramel bits and drizzling it. They become super hard when refrigerated)

This was just alright. I found the base too thick and the chocolate separated from the base when cutting them up in about half of them. Unfortunately, this is the fourth or fifth recipe I have tried from this site that has left me wanting; everything has a four or five star rating but in reality is just ho-hum. Edible, but not the show stopper it is being billed as.

Chocolate had tendency to separate from the peanut butter base.  The chocolate cracked when cut into.  I don't know if it would have been better to grease pan - said "ungreased 9x13 pan."  Wouldn't waste my time.  Doesn't make a good presentation when serving for guests with bars broken and separated!

Hands down the best bars ever!   Instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips , I used Hershey's milk chocolate chips.  I also added an extra tablespoon or two of peanut butter to the sugar and graham cracker layer. This made them creamier and not crumbly. These bars are  better than Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, no joke! I made them once and I keep getting asked to make them again. They are very addicting so if you are on a diet, don't make them, LOL!

Made w/ 3/4 the called amount of butter & 60/40 natural PB & reg PB - cant imagine using more butter (just sticky enough as I made). Also used Gluten Free graham crumbs.  Good enough to pick at & not throw left overs away but not sure I'll make again.  Don't get me wrong - we all cleaned our dessert plates but only the 5y/o gave raving reviews (but he does that for anything with sugar). Would give 3.5 stars If i could.

Not long after I first made this (2012), I found out that I had an adult on-set peanut allergy. Reese's was (and still is) my favorite candy. Alas, no more Reese's, no more pb&j. Nut butters just don't taste the same in feaoux pb&j.

About a month ago I was inspired to try making feaoux Reese's with cashew butter (I don't like almond butter). It came out very good. Almost the same as a Reese's. It was very close. My mom, who does not like Reese's at all, said it was good, if a little too sweet.

Just use the same measurements of nut butter in place of the peanut butter. And for a gluten/wheat free variant, use gluten/wheat free graham crackers, like Pamela's.

Also, I used a jar of marianara sauce to crush the graham crackers. It makes it really fine.

I used milk chocolate the first and second times and 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 dark, and 1/2 cup semi-sweet the third time.

My sister-in-law and family were visiting us for the first time this weekend at our beach house and I went on a quest to find a tasty treat that both adults and kids would enjoy.  The competition was Nancy Fuller's recipe for Chocolate Peanut Butter Bars - however, All-Recipes won out.  With some 20000 some plus positive ratings - I thought the odds were pretty much in my favor.  After reading many of the reviews, I tried not to make too many alterations to the original recipe.   Because some reviews stated that the chocolate top was too hard to cut - I added 1/3 cup of half & half to the chocolate and the suggested 4 tablespoons of peanut butter.  I also used the whole bag of chocolate chips - Ghirardelli, semi-sweet.  My chocolate turned out perfect.  Where-in lies the problem - the other half of the bar.  First I will state that I am very discriminating on all recipes and only repeat -make/bake the finest.  Many consider me to be an excellent cook and absolutely love my cooking.   If you are not a fuss-budget like me - this recipe might be all right.  First major problem for me was the consistency of the bottom.  This bar was way too "gritty" for me which was noticeable from the first bite.   In addition, my bars did not come out of the baking dish with any ease whatsoever.  Many crumbled, lost parts of their bottoms, stuck to the bottom of the pan and so on.  It was not pretty.  I will say that there were some however, that did hold their shape.   So we have "gritty" and

Love It! I have made this twice now! Only changes I made was more peanut butter! I cut the recipe in half and used 2/3 cup of peanut butter! And i also used a blender to crush the Graham crackers! Very good! And also after I refrigerated for a few hours I took it out so it doesn't dry up and it's bomb! Quick and easy!

I didn't use graham crackers, and I only used 1/4 cup of margarine (1 cup seemed like way too much!) so my recipe was a little different. Because I didn't use graham crackers or as much margarine, the overall recipe came out with less calories!  The chocolate on top came out beautifully, and the bottom was still tasty and very soft even without all the margarine. I will definitely be making it again soon!

Oh my goodness! These were so delicious. The only thing I changed was instead of using graham crackers, I used malt biscuits. I'm in NZ and G crackers don't exist here. I pulverised the biscuits in my NutriBullet using the mill blades until very fine/flour like. I made the base accordingly to recipe and I chilled it for 15. I then poured the chocolate (1 cup of dark and 1 cup milk chocolate chips + 4 1/2 T of PB) on top. I placed it back in the fridge to set for about 25 mins and then cut it into slices to avoid the chocolate breaking into bits. My husband is a big Reese's fan and said they tasted just like the real thing but the only thing missing is the salt. That being said, the next time I make these, I will add 1/4 tsp of salt to the base to perfect them. Will definitely be making this again!

Update: 5/11/2017 I made these again using 1/4 tsp of salt and have perfected them! Tastes just like Reese's cups!

Delicious! Only change was i added 1/2 c. peanut butter to base and whole 12 oz package chocolate chips. i chilled the bottom for 10 min before adding melted chocolate. The last time i made these I refrigerated the bottom too long because when i added the melted chocolate it cooled the chocolate too quickly and made it difficult to spread

If you've got a hankering for Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, this will do it, tastes almost exactly like it without that chemical-y tinge. I ended up using the listed amount of butter, as its pretty tough to spread without it falling apart otherwise. Refrigerating it a bit before spreading the chocolate also worked like a charm.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I like to cut the butter into cubes instead of melting it. This adds some nice buttery surprises in the end results.

I quadrupled this recipe for an Easter event at our church, cut them into little squares and put them in mini cupcake papers. As suggested in other reviews, I left out 1/4 of the butter, melted the peanut butter with it, and used skippy natural. Oh, and a food processor does leave the crumbs too coarse- I used a Jamba Juice blender and packed the crumbs into the measuring cup and it worked perfectly- not runny or grainy at all! These are great- taste just like Reese's!

Very easy to make! And they're so good, especially if you love all things peanut butter. They are very sweet though. Next time that I make them again, I will put less sugar into the graham cracker crust, maybe just one cup instead of two. But great recipe for sure!

SOOOOO  Yummy!!!!!  To create the peanut butter layer, I ground the graham crackers in my food processor along with the powdered sugar.  And following the recommendations of other reviewers, I melted the PB in with the hot butter and poured that hot mixture into the crumbs while the processor was still running.  This made for a very smooth PB layer (no crumbs or gritty mouth feel) Letting that sit for a while assured everything soaked in the butter mixture.  Also cooling it for a while in the fridge set it up enough to pour the warm melted chocolate mixture over it without the two swirling into one another.  The two layers did not separate doing it this way.

Super easy but looks nice enough to bring  to company.  I just stuck to the recipe and it couldn't have been an easier dessert.  Really rich and great taste if you love peanut butter and chocolate.  A small piece is more than enough so cut smaller pieces.

Easy to put together and my kids raved! I had all the ingredients on hand, so it was the fastest dessert I've put together in a long time. :) I'll definitely make again. I used Light Cocoa Candy Melts for the chocolate and it was the perfect compliment to the peanut butter layer.

Followed recipe as stated except I used sweet chocolate chips because I don't like semi sweet. I have made this a number of times and give it an A plus.

Very basic and easy to make! Tastes delicious, just a little less chocolate in the recipe. There was a lot of extra.

These bars are the best thing ever!!! I always make these when going to a friend's house for dinner and they are always a hit. Instead of crumbling graham crackers myself I buy the pre- made crumbs from honey maid. They taste exactly the same when I make the bars with hand made crumbs ( smashed with a rolling pin) but I found adding a little extra of the re- made honey made crumbs makes the crust a little less runny.

Wanted to try a new version  but was sadly disappointed. Peanut butter didn't set up well even after hours in the fridge and chocolate mixture  wasn't enough to give a sufficient top layer. Will stick to my original recipe I've been using "Chocolate Peanut Butter Bars II".

I only used 1 cup of confectioner's sugar, and still found it plenty sweet. But as other reviewers said, the chocolate is hard, and the peanut butter is soft, so cut them when they're semi-set. I used powdered peanut butter with the chocolate, so that may be part of the issue. I'll try them again though, with less butter, less sugar, and real peanut butter in the chocolate. (I used real peanut butter in the crust.) Edit: Add a pinch of salt on top of the chocolate for more savory flavor.

I decreased the powder sugar to 1 1/2 c., Increased the graham crumbs to 2 1/2 c. and used half milk chocolate and half semi sweet chocolate for the topping. These are amazing!!!

So these are amazing! I did make a few adjustments: cut back the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and butter to 1 and 1/2 sticks. Made sure the butter was all the way melted and allow time for graham cracker crumbs to get really soaked in the butter to avoid grainyness. I also used Xtra CRUNCHY peanut butter which put these over the top delicious!! I put little scoops of the peanut butter mixture in mini cupcake pan with gold foil liners to resemble peanut butter cups and then poured the chocolate on top (I omitted the PB in the chocolate). Everyone raved about these!

Pretty solid recipe although it didn't seem to have enough peanut butter in the lower half to make it pop.  I might try sweeter chocolate or dark chocolate next time since the semi sweet tasted a bit off.

1 inner package of gram crackers from the box seemed pretty close to 2 cups, although it was a little less.  I stopped there to avoid opening another and it seemed close enough.  I used a pastry cutter to break up into the crumbs.

Tasted just like Reeses cups! My only complaint is that, after cutting them, when I try to scoop a square out the peanut butter doesn't stick to the chocolate. I think I'd actually use a smaller dish next time, too. The peanut butter bottom just barely spread along the bottom of the 9x13" pan.

This has got to be one of the best recipes of any dessert I've ever made. Easy, fast, kids love it! I make the recipe using the exact directions and ingredients posted except for the chocolate. I always seem to have a block of chocolate to melt rather than choc. Chips. Taste just as good. Its always gone in 1-2 days!!

I really really like this recipe! I added some butterscotch chocolate chips and it tasted amazing! I'm so happy it tasted a LOT like Reese's cuz Reese's is one of my favourite candies! My parents and sister all said it was incredible, and my dad said "Mmm... Why do we ever need to buy deserts again?" Sooo happy I made this!

I lost my recipe for homemade peanut butter cups and was very happy to find this.  I use super chunky peanut butter for added texture and I don't add peanut butter to the chocolate.  I also melt the butter and peanut butter together.  Now I can continue making more memories with this great tasting treat.

Reviewers mention the amount of butter but the recipe calls for one cup--which is two sticks, not one. They are delicious. It did help to chill the base before spreading the chocolate. Very good!

I've made this 5 or 6 times and it comes out wonderful. I only use 3 cups of confectioners sugar and 3 Tbs. butter with the chocolate chips. I freeze them after cutting in squares and they are wonderful and last longer than if they were sitting on the counter.

I have made these before with another recipe.  They turned out very good.  When I made these, I couldn't taste the peanut butter. The peanut better layer also had a different texture than the other recipe.  I won't use this recipe.  I did use margarine instead of butter.  Maybe that is what made the difference.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make! This must be kept in the refrigerator or it gets mushy. I may decrease the butter next time.  I have a request to make it again this week!

I have made these bars before but I made a few changes.  First I recommend using milk chocolate chips and not adding the peanut butter to them.  Also, after spreading the melted chocolate, I refrigerate only for 15 minutes.  Then they are easier to cut, although you just have to carefully cut the chocolate because it won't be completely set

I had to add about  generous extra 1/8 cup of graham cracker crumbs because the mixture seem to be too moist. Next time I'll try the suggestion of 11/2 sticks of butter. They were good even with the added crumbs. Will make again!

Very disappointed. Too much graham cracker crumbs which made it grainy, and too much butter. Doesn't set well so I have to leave it in the fridge which makes it near impossible to cut. Not even close to as good as similar bars I've had before

I made these bars with extra crunchy peanut butter in the base and the chocolate topping.   Since they are very rich,  I also cut the pieces smaller.   They were the hit of the dessert table at a fairly large pot luck dinner.  Both the adults and kids  liked them.

these couldn't be any easier and taste so good!  as close to the real thing as it gets.  I loved the chocolate topping; tasted so close to the chocolate used on the store bought brand.  I thought about using milk chocolate but kept with the recipe and glad I used the semi-sweet.  that mixed with the pb making the topping was the perfect balance of chocolately but really tasted like a milk chocolate d/t those few tbsp of pb.  I used the store bought pre-crushed cannister of graham crackers.  this worked out well because they are so finely ground.  I would either suggest buying the cannister of them in store or really pulverizing them in a food processor so they are a really find crumb.  I could see some issues with the consistency of the pb part of this otherwise.  thanks so much!

A healthier option?

1 cup butter, 2 cups sugar.  This is 3000 calories alone.  I'm not a chef but I wanted to experiment and thought this recipe would be perfect to try my first healthy ingredient substitution.

I replaced 1 cup of butter with 1 cup of avocado.  I replaced 2 cups of sugar with 2 cups of stevia.  I can't tell a difference.  The chocolate is already slightly bitter and hides the bitter of the stevia (for me at least).

Still a really heavy desert even after the substitutions.  At least I had fun experimenting.

Oh My Gosh. This is sooooo rich and decadent. My family and I loved it. My husband cut our desert servings. He THOUGHT we should have "good sized" servings. But, it was so rich, we could only eat a small portion of what he served. I have to agree the base/crust/bottom part remained too soft. This was true even after it was refrigerated for 3 or more hours. I added a bit more peanut butter to the top chocolate (1 & 1/2 tablespoons and the rest of the bag of chic chips. I also added a good dose of dark chocolate powder) That way the top was quite firm, but not hard and remained easy to cut.

I made these for my kids and they loved it!  Made them again and took them to work. everyone said they tasted just like Reese's cups. Now every time I say "peanut butter bars" my kids eyes light up. I think they are actually better cold but it all depends on your preference. It reminds me of the peanut butter bars I used to get when I was a kid. Make sure if you do keep them refrigerated you use a solid edged knife that is really hot (run under water for a few min.) so it won't break the chocolate when it's being cut.  Great recipe!!

I made these with  Hershey bars and not chocolate chips. It came out WAY better then Reesie's cups. I used cupcake paper cups to make them into peanut butter cups. These were made for a birthday present and let's just say those who didn't get any were very unhappy with me.

These were absolutely delicious.
I added 1/2  of the chocolate chips & 1/2 of 
Baker's semi sweet chocolate bar 56% Cacao (about 4 squares). Also,  I looked for non gmo chocolate chips... The bars made them incredibly delicious..  this was my first time making them. I took these to an event and so many people complimented  me on them and wanted the recipe....

These peanut butter bars are  are really great!  But i must warn you, they are very sweet.  And if your stomach can handle very sweet treats like these than go ahead and make them.  I followed the recipe exactly  and put them in the fridge overnight so the chocolate can harden on top.  They are very easy to make and are  truly a smash hit .  If you like Reese's  Peanut Butter Cups than you will love these.  Go ahead give them a shot.

I love the flavors in these peanut butter bars.  The peanut butter layer is a bit too soft so they definitely need to stay in the refrigerator.  Maybe less butter would firm up the peanut butter layer?

I substituted the crackers for rise crisps and the semi sweet chocolate mixed with peanut butter for Nutella. (I just heated up the Nutella a bit for easy spread) They were delicious! The only problem I had was that it took almost 24 hours to completely harden.

This was excellent.  I was in the mood for a peanut butter style dessert and this was a hit!  Loved how easy this recipe was to make--you just need a crowd to help indulge with you!  An 8x8 pan was the perfect amount.  I made the recipe without modification and used Giardelli Semi-Sweet morsels that easily melted in the double boiler and Jiff Smooth Peanut Butter.

Followed the recipe exactly, except I used food processor for crackers.  I thought they were too oily on the bottom and too hard on top, and by grinding up the cracker, it made it sandy.  I would use less butter, less sugar, and just break up crackers instead of pulverizing them.

These bars are delicious!  They are quite like Reese's although I think the chocolate needs to stand out more.  Next time I might increase the amount of chocolate by 25% or instead of melting it with peanut butter I may use cream instead, making a thick ganache for the top.  That's not to say these aren't great as written, they are!  My husband and kids asked if I would break out the candy molds and make PB cups with this recipe.  That's a real compliment coming from them, they are all big time Reese's lovers :)

I was craving a midnight snack and this was a life saver! Very easy, very delicious! I didn't have the ingredients for the chocolate covering, but the peanut butter portion was good enough for me. Next time hopefully I'll be able to make the full recipe!

These went so fast in my house!  Just terrific!  Only change I made was after I put on the chocolate topping, I put it in the freezer for maybe 20 minutes.  Everything firmed up and ate like a cookie.  So glad I found this recipe!!

I followed the exact recipe. I used natural PB with no salt or sugar. The only changes I would make next time are less powdered sugar (it was really sweet!) and a little less butter. The natural PB has a good amount of oil it in. But they were amazing.

Deliciously easy dessert. I used crunchy peanut butter and dark chocolate to change it up a bit. Kept it covered overnight in the fridge. My guests loved it as I received a "marriage proposal" and another asked me to be her sister!  =) It was a huge hit!

Made exactly as written. Didn't chill the pb mixture before topping and the results were excellent and got rave reviews. They really do need to stay refrigerated or the tops start falling off but so good!

Amazing! I only have a family of 4, so I cut the recipe in half and it worked out great! I melted the chocolate and peanut butter together using a pot on the stove, and that worked good as well! This is an absolute must try!!!

Really delicious.  I used vegan chocolate chips and organic everything else.  Very tasty but very sweet, next time I may cut down on the powdered sugar a little.

I loved these easy to make bars. I  used natural peanut butter and only half the amount of sugar as I felt they were sweet enough. Will definitely make again!

Similar to peanut butter bars IV.  Delish of course.  It was a warm kitchen so I had to refrig them to set them up.  After firming up, I left them at room temp.   Made only half the recipe for 2 people.

Made this last night for a birthday dessert. I halved the ingredients and put into a chocolate cookie pie shell. Also I used Costco's "Kirkland Brand" of peanut butter....it has only peanuts and salt, no sugar, hydrogenated oils or preservatives. This is delicious!

Yum!  Very easy to make and tastes delicious.  I followed the recipe as written  with no problems.  I recommend this if you love Reese's.  This is very sweet so you only need a small piece.

Simply delicious!!! My parents tasted it and they said it's a butterfinger & reese's mix of flavor. I used a natural & no sugar Peanut Butter so I decided to add 1 teaspoon of confectioner's sugar, and it's really good. Now I have another simple & delicious dessert for a family reunion.

These are our go to quick sweets.  I have always cut them before the chocolate gets hard.  And it is much easier.  I used to make peanut butter bars as well my family prefers this while my brothers family likes the balls.  So it is all to your taste.

Nailed It! Wow this has got to be one of the best things I ever tasted... Quotes from husband "I don't thing I've ever tasted anything better in my life" - "Why haven't you made this before" - "I think I could sell these door to door" - "If you put marshmallow on these too, they'd be kinda like s'mores" - (disagree with that, these need nothing else.. lol) SCORE!

I added 1.5 sticks of butter to the crust and 1/4 t sea salt. (use parchment paper in the pan and cool is freezer for 30min.)
  I used creamy cheap peanut butter for the crust and crunchy natural peanut butter to the topping.  Dark chocolate chips were a great modification for the top  and I sprinkled of sea salt over the bars before serving were a hit!

These were not what I expected. The ones I made need to stay in the fridge because they are too gooey to stay bars on the counter. The flavor is fine, but I was looking for a bar more like the ones I remember in school. I'm going to look for a different recipe, as this one just wasn't what I was looking for.

Very good recipe! The peanut butter part was a little chunky but still delicious. The chocolate harden up so much in the fridge that it was hard to cut but once we took it out it softened up just fine. I preferably like mine cold so I just used the chocolate topping as a scoop for the peanut butter. Very rich flavor!!

Absolutely wonderful! I used 1-1/2 cups of butter. Peanut butter was a little gooey. Will try 1 cup the next time. I prepared these in a brownie pan and cut into small bite size pieces. Kept them refrigerated  as the chocolate tends to melt fairly quickly. Took these to a party and EVERYONE loved them including all of my guys who are huge Reeses fans. Had absolutely no leftovers. I followed other reviewers advice and allowed pb to cool few minutes in fridge before adding chocolate. And as another said, the graham crackers do need to be ground very fine with food processor. Thank you for the excellent recipe! Will be making again very soon :)

Followed the recipe exactly. The taste is good....but the texture of the bottom layer is too soft - like eating a great unbaked cookie dough!
I also found these hard to cut without wrecking the chocolate topping and difficult to get out of the ungreased pan.

Great recipe! I made it with 1.5 sticks as another suggested. I love Reeses! When my hubby tried it he said, wish it tasted like Reeses. What??? It does!! I like the fact  I can use dark chocolate on top. Can hardly find reeses dark any more. Will make this again and again! Thank you!

I have tried twice in two days to make this. I watched the video to try and figure out what I did wrong after the first attempt. The first time I didn't melt the butter, it was room temp. And the bagged was like thick cake batter; not at all like the video and so I scrapped that and melted the butter and tried again. Exact same thing, but even softer batter!! So frustrating!!

Fantastic, better than the Reese cups! I found mine turned out way too liquid the first time with the melted butter, the second time I made this, instead I added room temperature butter. If it's too thick to spread (which mine was) just pop it in the micro wave for 10-20 seconds until it's just spreadable. It turned out great!

Super easy recipe that is DELISH!!  Be sure to use good quality ingredients, it makes the difference (I've seen lots of post about funny taste, that's why.)  I did cut the butter down to 1 1/2 sticks,  great results!

Very very delicious! They do indeed taste like peanut butter cups if you use the right peanut butter. Don't use store brand peanut butter; I suggest using Jif peanut butter. Out of the dozens of times I've made this, trying out different peanut butters, Jif worked the best! Made them taste exactly like peanut butter cups!

Oh my goodness these are delicious. The remind me of the peanut butter surprise bars from my elementary school cafeteria. I did reduce the butter to 1 1/2 sticks. And next time I make them I will try reducing he sugar as well, as they are very sweet.

I made it with crunchy peanut butter,  making the bottom layer stiff. The top layer however did have pieces of peanuts ruining its looks. I am defintely making it again,  using crunchy peanut butter for the bottom layer, but smooth/creamy peanut butter for the top layer.

This deserves 3 1/2 stars as it was better than OK  but not exactly what I thought it would be from the description.  These bars cut OK with a warm knife.

So delicious! I've made these several times. They're horrible for your waist line, but oh so tasty, that sometimes you just have to throw caution to the wind. I left my graham crackers chunkier after the finer version wasn't to my taste but you can customize this recipe and that makes it 6 stars in my opinion. I might try them with almond butter sometime.

These are fantastic! So fast, easy and delicious. After being on a PB & chocolate kick and buying obscene amount of PB Cups I started looking for a make at home alternative. These are perfect.

Depending on how fine your graham cracker crumbs are these are a bit grainier than store bought PB cups but I found if I took the store bought graham crumbs and ran them through the food processor before combining they're closer to the right texture. 

The tip about melting a bit of PB with the chocolate is fantastic :)

So good!  Would definitely use milk chocolate chips next time instead of semi-sweet. Also would make even more chocolate peanut butter frosting to spread on top of the bars.  Very good.

For UK.  I used 225g butter, 240grammes of biscuit (digestives will do, but I used the coffee biscuits - blend really fine!) 200g icing sugar, 300g smooth peanut butter. 300g chocolate.

Nice!

I doubled the recipe for a jelly roll pan. The only change was instead of using double the butter (2 cups), I used 1 1/2 cups. I think the extra butter may make the peanut butter layer a bit smoother so I would probably use the full amount if I made them again. They were good, but not fabulous. Really just a personal taste preference. I'm taking them to a church function tomorrow and have no doubt they will be a hit!

Very good.  I had always imagined that Reese's must have a secret peanut butter recipe, but it is the graham cracker crumbs that replicate the Reese's texture, which is what I feel really makes that candy unique.  Next time, I will use shortbread cookie crumbs and see how that goes.  I imagine that would be just as good as graham cracker crumbs, so long as the crumbs are really fine.  Super easy recipe.  It is not easy to find Reese's cups where I live, so this is a go to recipe to get my Reese's fix.  :)

I used a little more peanut butter in the base...actually about 3/4 of a 16 oz jar of peanut butter.
Lined a mini muffin pan with mini muffin papers,festive in color as I served them as part of a Christmas dessert, and used a mini ice cream/cookie scoop to fill each muffin paper 3/4 of the way up.
I have a chocolate melter and after chilling the peanut butter cups a short time in fridge, used the mini scoop to drop melted chocolate on top. Did not need to add peanut butter to melted chocolate.
Because of the peanut butter and butter the papers came off without any sticking. Perfect peanut butter cups!

Delicious! The only thing I did differently was the topping...I had two   (very high-quality, creamy) and large milk chocolate bars...melted in microwave, and spread on top. I am in danger of eating too much of this! gonna give some away today for Christmas :D

It was delicious after we made a few changes.  Instead of two cups of graham cracker crumbs, I used one and a half cups.  We also added a fourth of a cup of peanut butter to the crust.  I also put in a tablespoon of butter-flavored Crisco into the chocolate mixture.

This was a definite hit and I will surely make it again! The only reason why I did not give this dish 5 stars was because I found the chocolate/peanut butter topping to be a little thick, which caused it to be difficult to spread evenly.  I will go about melting and spreading the topping differently the next time.

I didn't have chocolate chips so i used m&ms and resse's candy and It still turned out good. Just expected it to be more peanut butter like than just a spoonful of peanut butter going into your mouth.

I made this exactly as stated. These were delicious!  But the bottom layer was soft and mushy. Had to freeze them to eat without a big mess. Will try less butter next time.

Love these! So easy and yummy. I also was easily able to transform this into a vegan dessert for my parents by simply replacing the butter with vegan butter and using dark chocolate chips, and it still turned out delicious!

A little dry and crumbly.  Difficult to cut also.   However, the taste was exactly like the famous peanut butter cups.  I've taken them to work and people go crazy for them.

I've made this gluten-free, using crushed Rice Chex (2 cups, measured after crushing) instead of Graham crackers. Friends have told me they like it better that way; I think I do, too. It makes it crunchier.

I made these many times and the first time I made them it was difficult getting them out of the pan and handling the peanut butter bars was quite messy on the fingers so I used the frosting recipe for a base. I let the base set up slightly,just enough to where it was tacky then I spread the filling  and then frost them right away I let them set up in the fridge,by doing it this way the filling didn't fall away from the frosting or base.
The changes I made with the filling was I used Ritz crackers and everyone liked that better then the graham crackers, I also used gluten free Chex cereal so a coworker could enjoy them.

These are awesome, and the recipe works perfectly, but you have to actually follow it... Some tips... I add the butter to the graham first, and let it sit for a  minute to absorb the butter, then I add the rest and press into a pan. I use an 8x8 pan because I find the layers are far too thin in a larger dish.  Also, after you add the chocolate layer, it's a good idea to score your cutting lines into the chocolate after it's been in the fridge for 20 minutes or so, otherwise it can crack and looks terrible. I guess a 'serving' is up to the eater, but I cut mine into 25 smaller pieces. Works best for those who just want a small treat, and if you need more you can just have another piece. 
My family goes nuts when I make these. When I bring them out at a large family event, I don't even make it to the table with the tray, I get mobbed and they get picked off the tray as soon as I enter the room. I have made these at least 12 times with identical perfect results every single time. Reese's ain't got nothin' on these!

I followed the recipe with 2 exceptions.  I used 1 & 1/2 sticks of butter instead of 2 sticks and I used crunchy peanut butter.  I also decided to layer with just a thin layer of chocolate.  It was easy to make and the perfect consistency.

These were very easy to make and they came out great! I don't like semi-sweet chocolate so I made them with milk chocolate. Be sure to use plain or honey style graham crackers and not the cinnamon, Yuck (don't ask me how I know that)! I think they would be interesting with a crunchy peanut butter, I may try that next time.

The base layer was extremely soft however.  I added an extra half cup of crumbs as I knew that it was too runny, and that still wasn't enough.  I will try this recipe again, but will try not melting the butter?  It is definitely worth another chance due to the similar taste to Reese peanut butter cups ....

Really good and easy.  I refrigerated the tray after adding the chocolate, and when the chocolate hardened I found I had to let it come back to room temp. before cutting it into squares or the chocolate would crack.  Everyone loved it though.  I will be adding this to my Christmas treats list.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Love these! Question though, does anyone have any tips to keep the bars more together? The peanut butter part seems to break apart and not stay in a firm bar.

One and a half sticks of butter was PLENTY! I also substituted ritz crackers for gram crackers and it turned out fine. 2 cups of sugar seemed slightly outrageous so I only used 1 which also worked well. Not sure what size pan you used but I used a 9in and they were kind of thin so I suggest an 8in pan. Great recipe!

I was not all that impressed with this recipe. It was a bit too sweet and not peanut buttery enough. Plus, the texture was not firm enough, so not long after it was out of the fridge it was turning very soft and the topping even melted. It was a very warm day, so may be better in the winter, but for a back yard summer time thing I would not make it again.

These were delicious!Easy and quick to make - and so very yummy. Here's what I did after reading reviews (one of my favorite things about allrecipes!!):
used coconut oil instead of butter, and I did use 1 full cup. I melted the coconut oil with the PB. I ground (very fine in the food processor) some toasted whole grain oats, probably about 1/4 to 1/2 cup, to bring the graham crackers to 2 cups. I also ground the graham crackers really fine as recommended by others. I added a pinch of salt, and used only 1 1/2 cups powdered sugar (and honestly they were still a bit sweet for my taste - I will try next time with less and get back to you!). I lined my 9x13 pan with parchment to overhang the edges, and after pouring in the first layer stuck it in the freezer (it was a very very hot day here). I did add a bit of butter (1 Tbsp) to the chocolate layer, and after adding this to the bottom layer I re-froze the whole thing for about 20 minutes before taking the whole thing from the pan (using the parchment overhang) to cut into small squares. Then it was back into the fridge. Unbelievably delicious!!!

I made this recipe exactly as stated..it is fantastic! Absolutely perfect…because I hate to use that much butter, and rarely do, so next time I'll try it with 1 stick. I have a feeling it will still come out delicious!

I rate this more like 4.5 stars.  Great flavor and easy to make.  My peanut butter/graham cracker portion was a bit too soft to easily hold and eat.  Maybe I will adjust my portions.  Will make again.  Thank you

I made these with just 1 stick of butter and they came out great! Not crumbly at all, I also only put about a tablespoon of peanut butter in with the chocolate chips and they spread just fine. Will make this again

I agree with other reviewers: the peanut butter base was too greasy, so I recommend another 1/2 cup of graham cracker crumbs next time.  I made other recommended adjustments: 1.5 sticks of butter in the base layer, and only 2 tablespoons of peanut butter in the chocolate layer.  I had trouble with the melting as well, so I recommend leaving it in the fridge.  I got good comments on the flavor, though.

Not crazy about it surprisingly ...has almost all great ingredients but even with extra peanut butter the grittiness of the graham cracker crumbs just didn't work for us.

Living in Greece where there aren't any graham crackers I used a package of a plain cookie call Pti Brer.  Also, even if you can find them, choc. chips would be too expensive so I use unsweetened dark chocolate squares (about 6 as they are in grams)  Also, because most American recipes are too sweet for my taste I cut the sugar to 1 & 1/2.  I might even cut it more.  But believe me, the dark chocolate really tastes good in this recipe.  Don't ask me about the peanut butter; all I know is it is 85% peanuts and it is salted.  At any rate, since I can't buy peanut butter cups here this is my treat a couple of times a year.  My Greek friends who receive them as host's 'gifts' also love them.

Make sure your graham crackers r crushed very finely. I feel that will have better results. Next time I'm thinking of sprinkling some Reese's pieces on top before allowing to cool.

I just made these for the first time.  I pretty much stuck with the recipes, but made two notable changes:  1.) I doubled it, but kept the 9x13 pan size, since some reviews said it was too thin  2.) I chilled the first layer for 20 min. before adding the chocolate layer on top.  

The bar was way too thick, especially the graham layer; also, the chocolate layer separated from the graham layer.  Next time, I will keep the graham layer the same, but double the chocolate, as well as NOT chilling the graham layer first and see what happens.  As well, make sure your crumbs are fine, otherwise the bar will be a bit grainy.

Delicious. Used a whole stick of butter with 1/4c extra peanut butter. 
If your mixture is too gooey or watery just add extra powdered sugar.

I saved time & $ by using whole graham crackers, crushing a little first in the package & then putting them in my food processor w/ the metal blade.  I used 1 sleeve of graham crackers plus 3 whole crackers to get 2 cups of graham cracker crumbs.  Then I pulsed in the food processor until all chunks were crushed into crumbs.  I then added the rest of the base ingredients to the food processor and mixed the whole base using the pulse setting.  Much easier & faster!  I then chilled the base as others suggested & melted the chocolate chips & 4 TBSP peanut butter in the microwave, using 7 power for a minute and stirring after every minute until melted.  Be careful not to over-melt or the chocolate will turn crumbly instead of smooth.

These really do taste like peanut butter cups and even have the same texture. Very rich so I don't make them often. They disappear very quickly.

I made this recipe for Easter.  I did change it up just a little bit.  I did put wax paper at the bottom of my pan so they would lift out easily.  Additionally, I melted a bag of milk chocolate chips and put on the bottom of the pan.  I let that chill, then proceeded with the recipe.  Chocolate top and bottom and peanut butter in the middle.  It doesn't get better than that!  EXCELLENT!  They taste a better when you let them sit for a day.  This recipe is a keeper.

The teen boy sleepover party had these gone in an hour. If you don't like semi-sweet chips, use milk chocolate. We like the semi-sweet.  Definitely melt butter and chill the peanut butter mix before adding the chocolate, as other reviewers have suggested.  Easy and tasty.

Delicious recipe that has a nice presentation. Only problem was that we used All-Natural Peanut Butter that never hardened enough, despite being in the fridge. They taste fabulous, but was unable to give as a gift as had hoped because they were soft. Kids loved them and didn't mind they were soft! Would make again and try different peanut butter.

They're a bit on the thin side, when you halve the recipe and make it in an 8*8 pan. Overall the dough needs something to give it a bit more of a creamy flavor, because it cannot stand alone without the chocolate, like it can when bullseyes are made. Also, even after setting for several hours, the bottom is still a bit more soft and greasy than it should be, making it harder to get out of the pan and rather messy to eat. 

These were good, very much like a reece's, but next time, I think I'll switch the recipe for the peanut butter part with my secret bullseye recipe. They're almost the same, but not quite.

As I live in the UK,we don't know what Graham Crackers are! I use a semi sweet rich tea biscuit,crushed.It works brilliantly and we love it.I make double and it is so popular that it doesn't last very long.

So we gave these out as gifts fr christmas. Since we dont have enough money to go out and buy a ton of presents for family and friends. We cut them into bars and boxed them up. People raved over these. ALSO Some people cannot eat nuts, but they can eat peanut butter, they loved how it had a crunch to satisfy there peanut craving. Alot of people want this recipe. So thank you soo much for sharing this. This will stick with our family. ;)

The only thing I did different was use milk chocolate chips instead. It turned out yummy and perfect.

I made these for a potluck and had to reserve a few little bars so my wife could try them. They went fast! After reading other reviews, I used 3/4 C butter and about 1 2/3 C confectioners' sugar. I also chilled the peanut butter layer for about 30 minutes, added the melted chocolate, chilled for another 30 minutes, cut the bars, and put back in the fridge. The chocolate was not fully hardened but retained its shape, so it did not crack and turned out very well. I thought the peanut butter layer turned out a little too crumbly, but that may be due to using less butter. I think I'll try again using even more PB since I love PB. Thanks for the recipe, Nancy!

My daughter's boyfriend's favourite Christmas treat! The only thing I do differently is I use crunchy peanut butter for a bit of texture. Always a huge hit at my house!

A little too good, and a little too easy! I only used 1/2 cup butter (margarine), and they turned out great.

I did everything the same except added a couple of extra tablespoonfuls of peanut butter to the base, as I thought it seemed a little too crumbly. Just right! I love how very quick and easy this is. And there's no cooking! My mom made these when I was growing up, so I was really happy to find this recipe again.

Delicious any way you make it!  Straight up, by the book as written, or with half the butter and sugar, etc.  Really how can you go wrong with these ingredients?

These were a big hit. I chose this recipe to use up some wow butter that I bought to send a "peanut butter" type sandwich to school for my son. He wasn't a huge fan so, I thought I would use half wow butter and half natural peanut butter and make these. I also cleaned out a combination of graham cracker crumbs and Oreo crumbs from my pantry. Combined I had enough to make the recipe.  They turned out fabulous.

Really tasted like Reese's.....I even used soy butter because my daughter is nut and peanut allergic.  I cut down the sugar by half, since there is the choc chip ingredient too.  I will make this again....kids and husband love it.

Good.  I think I made it wrong.  I maybe didn't get the butter to the right state before mixing it all together.  It felt like I was just eating butter.

These were awesome!  My grandsons and neighbors loved them!  I followed a couple of other suggestions (chilled the crust for at least 30 min before putting filling on)and melted the butter and peanut butter together (for crust).  Also used 1 1/2 C powered sugar and added a little extra peanut butter to both the crust and the filling.  Then put finished bars in fridge.  They were great!

I have been making these for a couple years now for the Holidays, I do cook all my ingredients together on the stove top except the chocolate, it makes it easier to spread in your pan and helps the chocolate stay melted to spread on top easier, then I freeze mine for 15 minutes and then pop it out and cut it, Done and ready to eat.
Thanks for the great recipe, everyone will keep coming back for more.. P.S. Cut them small they are rich, like quarter size small.

I can't believe how good these are! This is such an easy recipe too. I did only use one and a half sticks of butter and I took the advice to melt the peanut butter with the butter and I had no problems with mixing it. I also let the "crust" sit in the refrigerator while I melted the chocolate chip topping although it didn't look runny at all so it may not have been necessary. I used the entire bag of chocolate chips since the recipe calls for a cup and a half which is 12 ounces even though it measured 2 cups before melting. Melted it was the correct measurement. If you use less than that you won't have enough to spread all over the top. These are really thin bars but they are so sweet that I really don't mind it. Such a simple recipe that there's no reason not to try these!

I made the recipe as is and found the crust way too greasy and heavy. I am a huge peanut butter and chocolate fan, but this is missing the yummy peanut punch I love in a good chocolate peanut butter bar.

Flippin' ridiculous good- pardon my French! Like buckeyes, but so much easier than dipping each ball. I did lesson the butter slightly, and I used milk chocolate chips, because that's what I had on hand.

With over 1500 reviews, you don't need mine.  HOWEVER: these are sinfully delicious and remarkably like Reese's Peanutbutter Cups.  NO baking either.  Now, how good is that (on a hot summer day)?

Be careful, these can be addicting! We all love these and they are so easy to make, Great for a gluten free diet if you use GF grahams.

At first I was confused about making this recipe because I didn't know how long to microwave the chocolate chips and the peanut butter but the reviews for the recipe said to heat it 30 second intervals. Other than that the recipe was good and I would make it again.

Absolutely the easiest and most delicious peanut butter and chocolate recipe out there!  Made a batch for family and for a barbecue and there were gone within 10 minutes.  A few people fought over the crumbs.  Very rich, and very yummy!

This is a very rich dessert. I  I only used 1 cup, and it was still pretty sweet. I also cut the butter in half, and it seemed to come out fine. It does taste like a reeses peanut butter cup, so the flavor is good. I used a food processor like others mentioned to make the base layer smooth. It still had a slight grit texture to it from the graham crackers, but I liked it that way. I probably won't make this again, as it is really heavy, but it did taste good.

Wow! These are awesome bars. I don't crave peanut butter too often, but when I do, these will always fit the bill. Rich taste, super easy to make. Definitely a winner!
I followed the directions as given, had no problems whatsoever. I did use a mixer to blend the crust portion, making sure it was thoroughly blended. I also used a 10 inch square pan, making them nice and thick!

This  is exactly the same recipe that my mom started making in the 19790's.  I think that she found it on the  back of a graham cracker box. This recipes is a love it or leave it kind of candy. My youngest brother loves it, my kids not so much. I do make this quite often. It's on of those recipes that you can make with your eyes closed. It makes a great addition to cookie gift boxes just because it is so easy. The only that I add is 3/4 teaspoon if vanilla extract.

Everybody loves these! Very rich and delicious! Only comment is that I put the graham cracker crumbs in the food processor to make very fine, this makes texture much smoother. Without processing crumbs the finished product is too grainy. These are in my dessert making rotation....kids ask for them over and over!

Good, but I would add half the suggested amount of butter or maybe less than that, otherwise they end up mushy and greasy.

These are great!  I would agree that they are a little too sweet so I cut back on the icing sugar a bit.  I didn't measure but i'd day I left out 1/2 cup or so the 2nd time I made them.  Also, I personally like more peanut butter flavor so I added peanut butter chips to the topping after I spread out the chocolate.  I also added skor pieces b/c I had a few left in a package and that was awesome too!!!  Everybody loves these!!!!

The taste was OK, but I found the bottom portion to be dry.  Then,  the chocolate topping separated from the bottom when I tried to cut it into slices.  I probably won't make these again.

This recipe was great, everyone loves it at home. I like other users microwaved the PB & CC. Like someone else mentioned, only microwave it for 30 seconds at a time or you risk burning the PB & CC. Scooping out the burnt portions is no fun.

These squares were really easy to make, but they had a really grainy texture. I feel that the recipe sacrifices quality taste for convenience. Not for me! I'd rather bake squares that taste better.

I made this as a peace offering to my boyfriend since he is a peanut butter nut.  Of all the Peanut Butter bars I have made, I love the texture of this one most.  Instead of using the peanut butter and semi=sweet chocolates; I used melted Reese's Peanut Butter Cups (his favorite).  

Needless to say, we are still together!

Wasn't crazy about this recipe.  I didn't feel there was a good peanut butter to chocolate ratio.  If I make this again I will double the chocolate portion.  Only keeping it because the hubby liked it.

I have made this recipe several times this week. Everyone who tried them asked for the recipe. My grandaughter also made a batch for school and was so pleased that her class loved them.

Oh my goodness.................well these were a hit! Very quick and simple but not very healthy :/! Oh well, a great treat now and then. My boys loved them. I cut them up in to small squares so I had about 20 to serve. Thought my husband was going to cry when he realized they were all gone. Thanks all! X

first time trying to melt chocolate and it went well. everyone loved these and they were gone within a day .but i would change a few things as they were way too sweet if thats possible. i would use only 1 and two thirds cup of icing sugar,half a cup of butter,1 and a half cup of graham crumbs and one cup of peanut butter. also i first mixed the butter and peanut butter. then i added the icing sugar and crumbs slowly. put mixture in pan , melted chocolate and put on top.

Best ever treat I ever made!  Took some when I visited my daughter's family of five this past week & they all loved it! (Note to my other daughter & grandson: sorry, there's none left, but we'll make more for when you come to visit for the night.) EVERYONE (including myself), had a nibble every now & then. 
The only change I would make for my next batch would be to reduce the amount of confectioner's sugar to 1 or 1 1/4 cups. Otherwise, it was loved by all 3 generations.
Thank you Nancy, for your very generous and delicious contribution.

They were 'okay' I used 1/2 natural and 1/2 regular chunky peanut butter & butter. Base seemed too sweet and lacked punch. I put in about 1/2 tsp. salt, maybe slightly more. This definitely added to a better result. Maybe I'm not a fan of these, my son liked them, I told him to take the pan to work. I used an 8x8 pan and made them thicker- better this way too.

I used one reviewer's suggestion and melted the peanut butter with the butter, made it so easy to stir! I put the bottom layer in the fridge to cool while I melted the chips (I used 1/2 chocolate and 1/2 caramel chips). My whole family loved this! Thank you for the recipe!

wow! Delicious! My family of 5 and I are trying to eat healthier and so I decided to make a "diet" version of this recipe. It turned out perfect! My opinion is that all food can be enjoyed if one keeps in mind portion and quantity. My version: I made the recipe as stated except I quartered all ingredients (for the math faint of heart: just figure what is 1/2 of the amount and then take 1/2 of that amount). I spread it out on a dinner plate into a pretty circle and cut it into 10 small pieces. We each ate 2 small pieces and can honestly say we ate healthy today!

Fabulous!  I'm not much of a baker, but always looking for dessert ideas and this one will def be made again.  Kids and adults loved it!!!  One change I made for necessity, I live in the Netherlands so there are no graham crackers so I used regular sweet crackers (called "tea biscuits" here) and added about a tsp of honey when making the crust and still turned out great and had a graham cracker-y taste.

very simple and delicious-tasting bars.  I also melted the butter with the 1 cup of peanut butter.  I used an 8 x 8 pan to make them thicker.  Tasted just like peanut butter cups!!!!

These were good. Taste is similar to the peanut butter cups you find at the store.  I personally did not have any trouble with mine as other' have. They do need time to set and I did only use 1 1/2 sticks of butter. My kids liked it but unlike other sweets I make, these lasted a while(in the fridge) because they are sooo rich. They were good, just not as good as I hoped.

Oh! My! Gosh! I will never look at a box of graham crackers that same again! I am truly sorry I found this recipe!!! It is SO GOOD!

Made with a natural refrigerated peanut butter, half the recipe in an 8x8 pan. WONDERFUL~!

We make a recipe very similar to this where I work. They are delicious and addicting! Very rich, like a homemade Reese's cup.

I used some of the suggestions as well as added my own variations. Instead of 2 cups of confectioners' sugar I used 1 cup confectioners' sugar and 1 cup granulated sugar. When I bite into a Reece's I love the texture - it's almost granulated so that's why I added regular sugar. Also, For the crust I added 1 and 1/4 cup of peanut butter instead of just 1 cup. I then stole 1/4 cup of the melted butter from the crust mixture to set aside for the chocolate mixture. (I used 3/4 cup of melted butter for the crust and 1/4 cup melted butter for the chocolate) In the chocolate mixture, I added the 1/4 cup of butter which I took from the 1 cup of melted butter for the crust. I also used a whole package of milk chocolate chips (which was exactly 1 1/2 cups) and added 1/4 cup of semi-sweet chips. Again, for the chocolate mixture I used an additional 2 spoonfuls of peanut butter. I followed the suggestion to set the crust aside in the fridge for 30 minutes to harden before pouring the chocolate on top. The pan was set outside (it's cold and snowing here) for 20 minutes and another 30 minutes in the refrigerator at a Christmas party. We found that a silicone knife is the PERFECT tool to cut these with! We didn't try a regular knife but I'm sure that works just fine as well. All in all, I love this recipe so much... but I can't eat more than a few tiny pieces at a time or I would have had to roll myself home from the Christmas party. I still have lots left! Delicious.

Absolutely delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out perfect. I did let the graham cracker crust set in the fridge for about 30 minutes before I poured the chocolate on top. My whole family loved these bars and I have been craving them every day since I made these yummy treats. I will make again very soon.

Great recipe! I used 1 stick of butter and 1/4 of a cup of vegan margarine. I also, put 1/3 of a cup carmel and chocolate chips in the base for an extra something.

I just made these and they are delicious! I did as other reviewers have suggested and chilled the peanut butter base first. I also only waited about 20 minutes to cut them so the chocolate didn't harden too much and crack.

Super easy and super yummy.  I didn't have enough butter, so I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 butter Crisco and they taste the same.  I also only had crunchy peanut butter and that works too....

these are okay, although they don't have the creamy texture and rich peanut buttery-ness I was craving.  Give them good marks for something that's super easy, has great presentation possibilites and would hit the mark for most everybody but me.

Super sweet & super rich but oh so good!
I made these with minor modifications; my graham crackers were a bit stale so I toasted them before crushing then sifted them with the powdered sugar for a uniform consistency.  I also mixed 3/4 cup of both semi-sweet and milk chocolate chips with the peanut butter for the topping and it turned out well.  I did have a minor sticking issue when I pulled them out of the pyrex dish so a light mist of cooking spray may be in order next time.

The flavor is excellent and very rich. My only complaint is that they were a little gooey and that made it difficult to transport and still have them look attractive for the party I was brining them to. Very good, but I would make them again for eating around the house and not to take to an event.

These. Taste. Amazing. It's ridiculous how good they taste, my sister even told me she'd rather eat one of these than a Reeses. The reason I only gave this 4 stars was just because the bottom of the bar is very moist, and because of that they don't hold together as well as I would like them to. 5 stars for taste, though! They never last long :)

We had peanut butter bars served on our dessert bar at our wedding.  I knew I needed to find a recipe to replicate them - this recipe is EVEN better than the ones served at our wedding! Be careful, they're addicting.

These are SO good!!! They taste even better than Reese's Peanut Butter cups. I just made them today and couldn't believe how delicious they are for a "no bake" recipe. I had to alter the recipe so that it would fit in a 8x8 inch pan because I was using my 9x13 inch pan for something else. They turned out perfectly except for the peanut butter part being a little gooey (which also caused the peanut butter and chocolate to separate a little). I mean, no one minded, but as far as presentation goes, they could have looked better. I think this may have been due to me altering the recipe for a smaller pan though. Overall, this was an amazing recipe and I WILL be making them again...in a 9x13 inch pan ;)

Oh! Also, I put the peanut butter layer in the freezer for about 5-10 minutes before adding the chocolate. It seemed to keep the chocolate from running.

I love these, its a GREAT and easy recipe. I made a 9x13 pan of these last nite, I ate one and so did my hubby, I don't know how we ate JUST one. We woke this mornng to find there were only 3 or 4 of them left! My 15 year old son and his friend, the same age, DEMOLISHED the pan. He loves Reeses peanut butter cups more then anythng and this is what he said as I was about to yell at him " But mom these were SO MUCH better then RP cups, we couldn't help it!" That says it all. He didn't get yelled at, and we found a recipe that is quick, easy and yummy to keep! Thanks!

These sure sounded good, however, the bottom peanutbutter layer was crumbly that u could not even cut them into bars...so...I ended up just crumbling it up along with the chocolate layer on top ..and I keep it in my freezer and we sprinkle it on top of sundaes, cakes, and whatknot!!

these tasted so much like reese's peanut butter cups!  Per some other reviews I only used 1 stick of butter, I also added an extra 1/2 cup of peanut butter to the mixture (when I made them the 1st time I tasted more of hte graham cracker crumbs than I would have preferred) and I used milk chocolate choclate chips (the whole bag) rather than the semi-sweet ones (althought I don't think it will make difference which ones you use).

I cut into bite size squares and placed in mini cupcake wrappers. These are so rich a bite is all you need! I stored leftovers in the freezer and they are a tasty little frozen treat.

Thankfully I had the good sense to bring these to work or I would be laying on the floor in a sugar coma by now!  PB cups are my favorite thing on earth so I found these wonderfully delicious.  I (as some others did) used milk chocolate chips and a little less butter.

YUMMY! Family loved these. I pulsed up about a cup of stick pretzels in food processor sprinkled on top of peanut butter layer and covered with the chocolate. Perfect combination of sweet and salty.

This was sooooo good! Especially since i didn't have to cook it! WOW-my kids and I thought it tasted exactly like a Reese's cup-we tried to taste one after refrigerating an hour or so but it was a wierd texture-we had them the next day after they were frefrigerated overnight and they were killer! Thanks for sharing-

I make this dessert all the time!  Everyone loves it and I love that no baking is required!  When I'm in a pinch to get dessert ready in a hurry, I run to this recipe.  I pop it in the freezer once it's made for a quick cooling process and we always keep these refrigerated for best texture.

We called these Peanut Butter Squares in school and I literally survived off of them during high school.  I got the lunch ladies to give me the receipe for graduation.  They used Rice Krispie cereal instead of graham crakers and less powder sugar than this.  Then I lost the receipe!!!  Several years later I found this receipe in a cookbook.  HALELIULAH!!!  I now make these regularly.  But I have added at times, both graham crakers and rice krispes equally-1 cup each.  The cereal gives it more of a crunchier texture like we had at school.  But you still get the gooey, and yes they can be greasy, chocolately, party in your mouth!!  If you find yours is too dry, try adding more melted butter and peanut butter alternatively until it spreads well in the pan.  A tablespoon at a time.  More than that will make it too greasy and you don't want that.  Hope you all enjoy this as much as I and my family do!!

This was a family hit the first time I made it! Everyone is asking me to make it again! The only thing I would change is to use a smaller pan, to make it thicker. And we all preferred it when the graham crackers were more coarse; not completely beat to crumbs. It gives it more of a crunch.

This was AMAZING! I used 1/2 regular peanut butter and half natural and it turned out great! Tons of requests to make again!

Not a big fan, found that they tasted to much like butter then peanut butter & I even cut out 1/4 of the butter & used peanut butter instead but with saying that my Boyfriend LOVED them! So for that I have to give 4 stars, thanks for the recipe I'll be asked to make them again I'm sure lol

These were definitely yummy, and addicting, but they are super rich and greasy... I think maybe removing some of the butter from the peanut butter mixture would help? These bars did not hold up after being cut into squares -- they fell apart in my hands and made my hands extra oily... Definitely delicious though! Also, if you're hoping for a smoother chocolate topping, this one gets hard as a rock after cooling, which I guess would be expected. I think it would be better with less greasy peanut butter layer and softer chocolate layer.

Amazingly yummy, I accually added about 3/4 cup quick oats to give it a little more nutritional value and still very good and sweet,just like a reeces peanut butter cup.

Used Rice Krispies in place of graham crumbs, as a last minute emergency substitution, and it tasted great!  Also used milk chocolate chips which was good.

Awesome!  My family loved them and they are incredibly easy!  I used natural peanut butter, 1 1/2 sticks of butter and only 1 c of chocolate with 3 TBS peanut butter for the topping and they were still excellent.  Thank you so much for sharing this delicious recipe!

Easy to make and delicious. I cut the butter to 1 stick, but not intentionally, I just read recipe wrong. They turned out great. I used a small cookie scoop and pressed peanut butter mixture into mini-muffin pans lined with mini-muffin cups. I put one small cookie scoop of chocolate on each. This required a double batch of the chocolate topping. I refrigerated until chocolate set. After that, refrigeration was not required. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is I prefer a stonger peanut butter flavor. Next time I make them, I will use 1 1/2 cups peanut butter.

Just got done making some...they are soooo good...although I dont really think they taste like a peanut butter cup which is ok..if I want one of those I can just go to the corner store...They remind me of peanut butter and chocolate fudge I used to get from a bakery years ago.  I am definitely going to include 
these in with my Christmas goodie plates.

These are now famous at my work.  I found it does take slightly longer than 1 hour to set, and it's the longest hour and a half of my life.

Also, try swapping the graham crackers for coarse pretzel pieces and a pinch of sea salt.  That batch didn't even make it to the employee lounge.

I always make these with an oreo cookie crust and it makes them DIVINE. I used ghee (only 3/4 cup, tops), so they're a little runnier, but still firm enough, especially since I prefer to freeze them anyway. These would be great in individual cups like reeses. They're a little too dangerous as bars.

YUM YUM YUM!
This was exactly the recipe I was looking for!
It certainly does taste just like a peanut butter cup!
And it's the perfect dessert to make on a hot summer day when you don't want to turn on the oven!
I'm not a big chocolate person though, so I cut down the chocolate topping a bit... The bottom is so good you could almost go without the chocolate all together! :)
Yum!

Wow! Super-rich so a little piece is more than enough. I'll probably half the recipe next time. The only change I made was using crunchy p. butter.

Made this one with 1 1/2 sticks butter just in case and it is awesome! It really doesn't seem to matter how much/little butter you use because it combines really well. I did let the bottom layer chill in the fridge for about 15 minutes before added the top layer. Does taste just like a gosh-darn PB cup!!! Thank you!

These are so good and so easy!  I made a plate of them for a church function and they were gone in seconds.  My husband and kids keep asking when I am going to make them again and leave them at home this time!  They make great desserts for school lunch boxes.

These are awesome!  The only things I changed was instead of using semisweet chocolate chips I used a full bag of peanut butter milk chocolate chips because that's all I had and I used an extra half cup of peanut butter.  1 cup crunchy and 1/2 cup regular.  Still turned out very good!! Will keep this recipe close at hand for sure!

I decreased the butter to 3/4 cup, and used 14 graham crackers. It was very soft and gooey, and a bit greasy - required refrigeration. I wish it were a bit more solid. Maybe even less butter next time.

I like an easy to remember recipe like this, basically twice as much dry ingredients to wet, and as much melted chips as you desire, and you can easily make any size batch you want. People will be amazed when you make it without looking at a cookbook!

I'm not a fan of PB but my boyfriend loves it. The recipe is simple and quick so I don't mind making it for him. Everyone that has tried them loves the balance between the graham cracker bottom and the chocolate topping.

These are so yummy.  I changed it up a little (I never make a recipe exactly as it states, lol).  I used canned fudge frosting instead of the chocolate chips and peanut butter for the chocolate layer and it is YUMMY!.  We also used honey graham crackers this time and that gave them a little different flavor.  I like them best with just plain graham crackers.  Everyone loves them when we take them to a pitch-in.

I reduced the amount of sugar to about only 1/2 to 2/3 of what is stated in the recipe, and it worked really well. It was certainly sweet enough for my sweet tooth, but allowed the peanut butter taste to be stronger at the same time. I really loved this, as did all my coworkers, who begged for more!

I've made these several times, with some changes, they're a 5. As in, probably only a 4.
If you're planning to keep and serve the bars at room temp, I'd suggest using room temp butter so you can see what consistency they're going to be. I usually end up adding an extra 1/4-1/2 c powdered sugar. I also love the texture of the graham cracker crumbs, so I add an extra 1/3 c of them as well. 
If you put the bars in a 9x13 pan, they'll be pretty thin. I usually put them in a 9x9 instead to have slightly thicker bars

These are great! I made them for all of my European friends who love Reeces peanut butter cups. I used natural peanut butter and Belgian speculos cookies and they turned out to be really delicious.

These are great. I added a layer of marshmallow cream between the peanut butter and chocolate on half. It is really sweet,  but really great!!

I love these and so did everybody else that got to try them. I especially love how incredibly easy they are to make. They were my first peanut butter bars. I have one question though. I did use half a cup of butter and sugar less than the recipe asked for(i had read in the reviews somebody else ha done them this way too). Everything else i did excactly as in the directions. But i have i really hard time getting them out of the pan. Thy stick really bad to it. It cuts very easiy but when i want to take to take out a piece, half of sticks to the pan. Can anybody tell what i am doing wrong or what i can do to get them out easier? Is because i used less butter? I would be very thankful for any advice, as i plan on making them again. Theu are really so good!

These are so easy to make and taste wonderful! I melted the butter on the stove then added the peanut butter to melt before adding the powdered sugar and graham crackers. Everything combined easily in one pot. Refrigerated for about an hour before I added the chocolate to the top. Be sure to store in the fridge or they will melt just like a real Reese cup.

So delicious and quite easy!  Didn't have access to graham crackers so used some basic tea biscuits, and they were fine.  Very yummy and a big hit with those I made it for.

tastes just like a Reese's and is super easy to make!  Can be thrown together in a hot minute, but need to chill for longer than an hour if you want to cut into bars otherwise it is very messy and ugly.

These are very easy to make. Very easy to cut turns out just like the picture. I loved that it's an easy last minute dessert but I thought it lacked peanut butter flavor. The graham crackers over powered the dessert.  I may try using crunchy peanut butter next time to see if it helps.  I will make this again.

These were pretty good. Perhaps the taste would have been better if I used regular peanut butter instead of the natural peanut butter that I had on hand. I chilled them so they would not be too soft, however, this made them very difficult to cut. Might give them another try in the future.

YUM!  I halfed the butter, used low fat honey graham crackers and natural (JIF) peanut butter -- still great.  Plus, after I pressed the mixture into the 9x13, I used the same bowl to melt the chips & PB for 60 seconds in the microwave, voile la: one dish prep.

These were delicious however they were a little bit greasy. I'm wondering if 1/2 the amount of butter would do the job, without it crumbling apart.

Luscious!  I doubled the crumb (but not the butter or sugar) in the base mixture to make thicker bars and used white choc chips instead of semisweet, which, I can tell you, is WIN.   A pinch of salt in the base mix wouldn't go amiss.

I made this in 2 shallow 9x13 pans instead of one. Took one to work & the other on a retreat. I got RAVE reviews on them. They are for sure better the next day though. Chill them for a while. I also added a bit more graham crackers on the bottom layer, but overall a great recipe!

AWESOME!!  These taste better than Recess PB cups, ...with some modifications;  Reduced the butter & sugar by half, used natural peanut butter (natural oils helped make up for the reduced butter without all the perservatives, hydrogenated oils & added sugar in regular peanut butter), & used dark chocolate instead.  Can actually taste & enjoy the quality ingredients rather than all the sugar & extra calories, but still decadent!!  My boys love this receipe & the new mod's - ENJOY!

Quick and easy the only thing to heat up the house is the microwave or stovetop to melt choco chips. Excellent. I used 12 Tbs Butter to cut fat but still holds well together. 6 if you half recipe which was plenty for little o' me. I followed anothers advise and ground up graham crackers fine and was sure to leave in refrigerator so would not soften

I made this treat for my boyfriend's family Christmas party. Since it was my first time meeting his entire family I wanted to take something yummy to the party. It was a HUGE hit! Everyone raved about it and the entire platter was empty by the end of the evening. If you want something that everyone will love then this is a great treat selection! It was an especially big hit with the younger children.

Great bars!  I added some cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg to the peanut butter part; and made the chocolate coating with white chocolate chips and a splash of vanilla extract.  I also made the coating with 2 cups of chips (1 full bag) and 1/3 cups of peanut butter.  My coworkers loved them!  the didn't last the day.

these were the best peanut butter bars I've ever had and they were so easy! And the best part is, you don't have to heat your oven up to make them!  what can be better than that?  my two year old can't seem to get enough of these.  Will definitely make again.

WOW! I did it exactly as suggested on one side of my pan and made the other half with chocolate graham crackers, then topped it with crushed reeses pieces prior to putting on the chocolate. Then I put 3 different kinds of chocolate on top of that, for that side and it was so good. This recipe is PERFECT as is but chocolate graham crackers made it more chocolaty and also good.

Would love to give this five stars but the "crust" didnt' hold up well. It stuck to the pan. I think if I had decreased the butter it would have done much better. Very good otherwise.

I made this recipe only once before and gave it four stars because I had to chisel it out of my glass dish. It tasted good but the presentation was lacking due to me having to hack at it. ***However, this time I gave it five stars because I only made half the recipe and instead of using a glass dish, I used a cookie sheet lined with my Silpat mat! Once the pan chilled, I lifted the whole piece right out and placed it directly on my cutting board! Great presentation and excellent taste! Will make again and probably again and I'm sure again after that! ;-)

The only problems I had were that 1: the peanut butter burnt in the microwave. Probably my fault for not stirring enough! and, 2: I used a larger pan, I guess, so I had to double the amount of chocolate used, so that it covered all of the peanut butter mixture.  Also-- I recommend NOT crushing the graham cracker by hand - it took forever!   Even though the recipe isn't cooled yet, I tried the mixture and it was great! I think this recipe will taste really good!

Absolutely wonderful! My boyfriend and his son loved this recipe. However, I think next time I will try using only 1 1/2 sticks of butter instead of 2. I think it would make me feel less guilty about eating more than 1 in a day!

These were awesome! I made no changes to the recipe itself and it turned out tasting very similar to a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan. Worked just lovely!

Oh man, these are delicious! They taste just like peanut butter cups. I halved the recipe and made it in an 8x8 inch square pan. Next time I'll reduce the butter in the crust slightly. These are great straight from the freezer!

These are very good bars and everyone at the gathering I took them to was delighted to eat them!  I took the advice of others and melted the pb with the butter and I shouldn't have as it made it a runny mess and I had to freeze it before I could put the chocolate on top!  Not the fault of the recipe, mind you!

Absolutely delicious and very easy! My whole family loves these! My son is such a fan that he has bragged about them on Facebook and directed anyone who has asked for the recipe to allrecipes.com :^D I have to admit, most of my family's favorite recipes are those that I've found right here. Love this site!

I made these last night, and they are so simple and SO GOOD! I doubled the "frosting" ingredients to get rid of an old bag of chocolate chips, and per another reader's tip, refrigerated the peanut butter layer for 20 minutes before topping it with the chocolate. They turned out perfectly, and will be a staple in my recipe rotation. Thanks for sharing!

These are delicious and very easy to make. They are definitly hard to mess up because I didn't have fresh graham crackers and people still loved them. I noticed but hey, it's choclate and peanut butter...can't go much wrong! :)

Loved these!  Addictive! Had a REALLY hard time getting them out of the dish in one piece, though.  Finally put it in the freezer...I think there might be too much butter, as they were pretty mangled but still yummy!

These are good, but be prepared...very rich and very sweet!  I followed the recipe exactly.   The peanut butter didn't set up enough in the refrigerator after only an hour, but they were perfect the next morning.  One easy trick I did was to buy the graham cracker pie shells instead of having to chop up all of the crackers myself.  The shell just crumbled into a fine powder.  For 12 servings (2 cups), you would need ~1 and a half pie shells.

The bottom layer was quite tasty when you first spread it, but I did not like the chocolate topping or the entire thing once it set. They did not cut easily and the pan should be greased because I had to keep scraping them up. Make the bottom and just eat that or skip the whole thing.

One word....AMAZING!  Loved these bars. Such an easy, fast and delicous dessert. The only thig I changed was I used 1 1/2 cups of milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet. Great recipe!

i have made these twice so far and everyone has LOVED them. in fact, i brought them to work today and the whole batch only lasted an hour and everyone raved about them! the only thing i will say is this, the 1st time i made them, i made with name brand graham crackers and they turned out perfectly...and the 2nd time i made them, i used store brand graham crackers and they didnt turn out as strudy, in fact i had to add more graham crackers so they would hold shape and not be gooey. I dont know if its because of the name brand versus store brand, but who knows. So just a suggestion, use the name brand. :) but either way, they were delicious no matter the look or consistency :)

I made this recipe with carob chips instead of chocolate chips and reduced fat peanut butter instead of full fat. It turned out great and no one could tell that it was a "healthier" version.

So good! I made these when I couldn't fire up the oven and i didn't have any flour :) they were AMAZING! I probably only used about a cup and a half of powdered sugar cause we ran out and I'm not 100% sure but i think i followed the rest of the instructions correct. I loved the texture of the "crust." So sweet and if u like peanut butter/chocolate combos then you'll LOVE this :D

Update: Made this again. Such a hit!!! A bit tough to get out of the pan without leaving patches of crust on it. Do NOT forget to refridgerate the crust before you put the chocolate peanut butter on. Also, don't wait too long before spreading the chocPB mix or it'll harden in the bowl and make it really difficult to spread. I had to keep remicrowaving mine :P Great recipe Nancy!!!

The bottom part has the right texture and taste is not far off from Reeses but I would try this with milk chocolate next time.  Semi sweet was too bitter.. unlike most pb cups.~  just noticed I was to add 4T peanut butter to chocolate chips.  (I had misread and added regular butter to the chips) That might help.  I will try this next time or go milk chocolate.

Um.....YUM! These really did taste like a reeses cup. I think it has something to do with the peanut butter in the chocolate? These are super easy with the food processor. I used my food processor to get the graham cracker crumbs really tiny but next time i'll just pulverize the heck out of them to get them even more smooth (think graham cracker dust). I added about 1 1/2 tablespoons of shortening to the chocolate/peanut butter mixture to help it be really smooth and easy to pour. They came out looking beautiful. I've been to the Hershey factory in Hershey, PA and it smells like these bars there!!! Thank you so very much, I will be making these often.

So delicious! I brought these to a youth party and they were a definite hit (besides the fact that I dropped them...)! My friends agree that they taste just like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. I will definitely make these again (and again, and again, and again...).

I had high hopes for these, but was let down.  They were very simple to make, but didn't taste a thing like those candy bars they sell.  I used 1/4 less butter, and 1/4 more peanut butter, and they still tasted like butter.  I didn't care for the mixture of chocolate and pb on top either, i think just plain would have been fine.  My husband liked them, but they are definately not a replacement for a reeses.

Delicious! I used a smaller pan for a thicker bar. Presented beautifully! The only change I would make is to use better quality chocolate, chocolate chips didn't do the peanut butter layer justice.

Awesome!  Though I didn't grind the graham crackers up enough, so it came out a bit lumpy.  But now I know for next time, which there will definitely be! :D

Amazing! The only problem I had was the chocolate and crust separating when I cut it.

These are good but not sure what the 5 star ratings are all about.  Think I'll try some of the similar recipes on this site.  And I might think about tweaking this recipe - definitely more peanut butter to up the peanut buttery taste and make some modifications to make it smoother, less gritty (yes, Reese's cups are a bit "gritty" which I like, but this is a little less smooth than Reese's).  Very inventive though to use graham cracker crumbs to mimic the grittiness of Reese's cups.

I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out just like the picture.  They were very easy to cut and didn't crumble.  I think I might still like reeses better but my husband disagrees.  I might have prefered a higher quality chocolate or possibly a milk or dark chocolate but the chocolate chips were fine too.

Can't go wrong with this simple, no bake recipe! Really, whats not to love--peanut butter AND chocolate!  For a delicious alternative-try using reese's pb cereal in place of graham crackers, and then use only half of sugar in recipe--still plenty sweet--and even more peanut-buttery!

I was excited to try these, I am pregnant and can't get enough peanut butter these days. They were good, simple to make and rich! More for the kids I think, they were good but nothing special for me.

My Reese's loving 11 year old loved these as her 'birthday cake' this year, as did everyone else at the party - everyone had at least two! I scaled the recipe up to 16 servings because we had a larger pan and it came out perfectly.

These tasted better than a Reese's cup. Delicious. Everyone loved them and were debating over who should eat the last one. HAHA. Will make again! I made a half batch and put it in an 8X8 pan. I used a food processor to do the graham cracker crumbs. Was perfect.

Great recipe! The texture was a little granular, so I recommend making it a little smoother with some milk or cream if possible. I used chunky peanut butter and found that it gave it a great taste! My huband loved these and I will definitely make them again!

This was a very good recipe. I did not have any powdered sugar in the house, therefore I used white sugar. Regardless, the recipe was very good. Maybe next time I'll use powdered sugar and it will be smoother. I will make this again!

Deee-lish.  I made this with 1.5 sticks of butter, 1C semi sweet chocolate chips and 1C milk chocolate chips.  Incredible.  My only tip is to let them come back to room temp a bit before cutting or the chocolate comes right off.  I cut half at room temp and then half once they had been in the fridge for several hours and the chocolate came right off of latter ones.

Love this recipe.  So easy to make and rich and delicious!  I personally think the taste is more in line with Girl Scout Tagalong cookies than a Reese's Cup, but fantastic nonetheless!

Made these for my sons bake sale and they were a hit! The kids loved them as well as the adults. The best thing of all is they are a cinch to make. The only thing I did differently was use good chocolate instead of store bought chocolate chips.

Yumm... I made this with half the butter and it tasted obscenely good.  I don't why you'd ever want to add all the butter.  I did, however, add another big glopping tablespoon (probably several tablespoons if measured out) of peanut butter to the mixture to make up for one less stick of butter.  The mixture combined well in the mixer, set up well, and held up well when cut.  Definitely an instant favorite.  I was originally looking to replicate my grandma's old recipe and this did the trick.  I would have given it five stars but I can't fathom eating two sticks of butter.

OH WOW! These were amazing and easy to make. Both my husband and I thought the longer they were in the fridge the better they tasted... So any tips would be to make ahead of time so that the mixture really gets to mix together.

These are great. Don't leave out of fridge too long it gets a little soft. Only difference was I used 2 cups of chocolate chips as I didn't want to put 1/2c. back in the pantry.

These bars are OH SO rich!  They are also quick and easy.  Next time I make them I am going to try to shape the peanut butter mixture into balls and dip them in chocolate.  If it works, they'll make great gifts at Christmas time.

YUM!  I made a few alterations to this recipe - but, really... how can you go wrong with chocolate and peanut butter!  I crunched up graham crackers in a freezer bag - probably about 3 cups.  I also increased the amt of PB I used in both the crust and the chocolate topping.  I also increased the amt of melted chips and used a whole bag (2 cups) in the topping, and I added about 2 Tbsp of butter to the choc. topping as I melted it on the stovetop - helps make it a bit more glossy and smooth.  YUMMY!  Next time, I will use powdered sugar in the crust.

Incredible!!! This is one of those recipes that you see and just have to make right then, it looks so good! I didn't have graham crackers, but I did have Nutter Butters on hand. Substituted those, and followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Hardened in the fridge, cut and served - A BIG hit!! Will definitely be making these the next party we go to..

These are excellent. Mine were not crumbly at all and adding wax paper is a must before filling the pan. I followed this recipe fully - though I melted the margarine in a pan on the stove and then the graham crumbs, sugar and PB while the heat was still on - I think this may have made a difference helping to melt the mix a little better thus, less crumbling?  I also microwaved the chocolate chips and the peanut butter. It was yummy. The only thing I will do different next time is add a bit more chocolate.

Made these and everyone loved them!  I didn't have enough graham crackers so I threw in some corn flakes.  Turned out okay, but I'm sure it would've been even better with all graham cracker crumbs.  Also ran out of peanut butter so didn't have enough to mix in with the chocolate topping.  Turned out fine!  I even liked them, and I'm not a peanut butter fan (I purposefully made them so I wouldn't eat any- didn't work!)

Yum!  I made it with chunky peanut butter and only used semi-sweet chocolate chips (no PB) in the top layer.  I made it in a 10x15 jelly roll pan, but would go with the recommended size pan next time since the bars came out thinner than I'd like. I chilled the bars before frosting as suggested by other reviewers.

Oh.  My.  God.  Perfection!  I am in love with Reeses PB cups and to me, they taste so similar.  There are a lot of reviewers that complain about the graham cracker crust being too grainy, but I think it's great.  I used 1.5 sticks of butter instead of 2 and it did not have the over-butter taste that people complained about.  This will be a lot faster for you if you have a food processor for the graham crackers.  Also, I used a whole 12oz bag of choc chips along with the 4 tbs of PB.  Definitely freeze the crust for 15 mins and the chocolate smooths on easily.  This dessert will be a true crowd-pleaser and I can't wait to take it everywhere, this is a nice substitute for my pb cookies that family is always begging me to make.  You'll love it!!

This is very similiar to one I've made for years. We don't add peanut butter to the chocolate chips but I bet it would be good, I'm going to have to try it.  We also just use an entire bag of chocolate chips.  This recipe is made on a cookie sheet, so everything is spread thinner and goes farther :) I like making these because they aren't as salty like the Reese's, and are more sweet.  YUM!

So easy but so yummy. Followed recipe exactly except I used light jiffy and that worked fine. Also, set peanut butter bottom portion in fridge for 15min before spreading choc, refridge 1 hour to set then left out 10min before cutting.

Ok, so my bars didn't turn out so well. I added a little less sugar so that they wouldn't be as sweet. My main issue was the texture of the bottom half, the peanut butter layer. It was too soft and crumbly....and grainy. The graham cracker crumbs I used were finely ground, but i still found it too grainy. I probably won't be making these again...but all in all, the flavor was good, and the texture of the chocolate layer was awesome.

These are very easy! Good but yes a bit to much butter.I think next time i will cut the butter down to 1 1/2 cups and decrease the topping or maybe i will just use Nutella instead of the chips.Still very good and worked to help get rid of the sweet tooth i had today.Will make again thanks.

YUM!!!  I made them with natural peanut butter (still with sugar added though) and they were great.  We ate the entire pan right away.

These are really good!  They taste just like a peanut butter cup!  My only complaint is that they get mushy if not stored in the fridge.

Went to review these, and was surprised to see that I'd made these before. I had decided that next time I would soak the graham cracker crumbs in the melted butter for a bit first, because I don't care for the little bit of crunchiness they give the peanut butter layer (and I ground them finely in the food processor). Well, I guess I'll try that the third time I make them! Kids really like them, though.

Not quite like a peanut butter cup, but very tasty nonetheless.  Easy to make, except I had problems melting the chocolate chips.

I followed the directions exactly as written and it was so yummy!  I made it for my husband's birthday because his favorite candy is Reese's Peanut Butter Cups and he loves peanut butter.  He liked these bars more than his favorite candy!  I will be making this again, but only for special occasions cause they're so bad for you.

This was good but not great.  Definitely needs less butter.  My kids liked it though.  I think a mix of semi-sweet & milk chocolate chips would be a good compromise, at least at my house.  I think I would make these again, with those adjustments.

I loved these bars. Very chewy, but smooth and creamy when it starts to melt in your mouth. Unfortunately, my boyfriend didn't find them delicious so I'm going to freeze them. They do freeze well as I cut a piece out and froze it last night. Kept well and dethawed nicely. No funky taste or flavoring afterwards. I used an 8x8 pan and my bars were nice and thick with a heavy layer of chocolate. Any Reese cup lover's dream in that pan.

I didn't care for the grahm crackers in the bars.  I was looking for something more creamy.  They were also very hard to get out of the pan.  You would have to removem them right after taken out of the fridge or they would be to soft and come apart.

Taste just like reese's (if not better! :D) I jus have a problem with mine setting up. they've been in the fridge for about 1 1/2 hrs and the peanut butter part is still not fully set. Maybe I'll wait til tomorrow or later on to try again. They were still delicious though! I used crunchy pb in the chocolate part and sprinkled chocolate sprinkles and graham cracker crumbs over the top of mine

these are really yummy and super easy.  Although the peanut butter layer was still gooey after chilling them in the fridge for an hour, so I moved them to the freezer and that helped.  I took someone elses suggestion of chilling the peanut butter layer for a few minutes before adding the chocolate layer and had no problems with the chocolate melting through.  YUM!

Okay, something I don't say often....way too much butter. I should have read the other reviews, but instead I am left with these to serve at my Halloween party tomorrow night. Oh well, they are okay I guess but seriously, they do tasts like eating butter.

Followed recipie to begin with, after i had it all mixed up there was way to much butter in it, tasted more like peanut butter flavored butter so i added more of everything else.  Next time ill only use 1 stick of butter, but it came out good they were gone in about 20 min.

These were great. I managed to make the 12 servings last for 11 days' worth of desserts (doubled up once!), and I didn't get tired of it. I usually read all previous reviews before posting my own, but seeing as there are 715 before me, I'll skip it this time. These were quick and easy, and I made them exactly as written. I used creamy (smooth) peanut butter; it didn't say whether to use crunchy instead, but I don't like that as much anyway. These also keep very well in the fridge. The graham cracker crust did have a slightly grainy texture to it; it was good, mind you, just a little unusual. I will recommend this recipe when I get the chance.

Great taste, but following recipe exactly results in awful texture (and I'm not talking crunchy b/c of the graham crumbs).  Waaay too much butter!  Kept it in fridge overnight to harden and tried it the next day; feels like biting into a stick of peanut butter flavored butter!  Will definitely try again, but will reduce butter to 1/2 cup. Thanks for the recipe!

I used milk chocolate instead of semisweet chocolate chips. They tasted very good. My boyfriend went gaga over them! He is a big Reese's lover, and said these do come quite close. I give it 4 stars instead of 5 due to the fact that it doesn't seem to get creamy enough because of the the graham cracker crumbs in the mix.

Made as directed but made 1 1/2 batches & put in a spring roll pan. I don't think they taste like or have the consistency of the infamous pb cups tho. Still excellent!

Very good and everyone loved them,but the bottom stayed soft and stuck to the pan. Next time I think I will try using less butter like someone else suggested. Other then that they were good.Will try this recipe again.

Good, but rich.  The graham crumbs in the crust threw me off a little since I was expecting a creamier consistency (like a Reeces).  Would make again though.

I would suggest ot use name brand graham crackers. I didn't and it turned out kinda gritty but the longer it sat in the fridge the gritty went away. My friend loved them and took all of them home.

I didn't have a problem with the chocolate being "too hard" but I did have a problem with the crust. It seems like maybe there is too much butter. It is greasy and really unsturdy. I love the taste though. Very good. My husband thinks they are really sweet but I think they're just right. I will probably try out the recipe again but with less butter or a smaller size pan.

These were just okay to me. I used a 7" x 11" pan and cut them into 40 bite-sized pieces. They have to be kept refrigerated or they become too soft and I'm not a fan of cold chocolate. Preparation was super easy using Keebler graham cracker crumbs. I probably won't make them again though, they just didn't "wow" me.

These really do taste like Reese's peanut butter cups.  These are super rich, I cut them into 24 squares instead of 12 and I think they're still decent-sized.  I used 1 and 1/3 cups of butter, any less and it would have been too crumbly.  Very decadent but easy to make.  My only gripe is that the chocolate is too hard.  Next time I might use a milk chocolate ganache topping.

I made these bars for my husband's birthday because he loves Reese's PB cups. They are wonderful! The only change I made to the recipe is instead of adding the 4 TBSP of PB to the melted chocolate chips, I added a bag of the Reese's PB chips. I did that because I had a bag left over from baking last year and wanted to use it up before it expired. I put the PB base in the fridge for about 15 minutes before I put the chocolate topping on. Then after I put the topping on I let it set out for about a half hour then put it in the fridge for about an hour to set. They get too hard if kept in the fridge so I keep them on the counter and haven't had any problems with the layers separating or with cutting them. They're very rich butI will be making these again soon!

These are really good!  I made mine with milk chocolate chips.  I refridgerated the bottom for about 1/2 hour before adding the chocolate topping, but they didn't stick together very well.  Maybe I won't refridgerate it as long next time.  Delicious!

I whipped these up last night - super easy recipe and SO tasty! I made half the recipe and put it in a 7x11 pan and they were a little on the thin side, so I'd probably use a smaller casserole dish next time so they'll be a little thicker. My husband is a HUGE Reeses fan, so I know he's going to love these. I do think you can get away with less butter than the recipe calls for, and I'll probably cut it down by 1/3 next time and see how it comes out. Thanks for the great recipe! :)

Wow! These are so good! I also tried it with milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet because my husband wanted me to, but I think they'd be good either way. My sons love them. They do taste a lot like peanut butter cups. I will definitely make these for gatherings. I think I will buy some foil baking cups to pour them into before they set to make them look a little nicer and maybe a little swirl of chocolate on each. Thanks for the great recipe!

I've said it before and I will say it again these are the BEST peanut butter bars ever! I make these all of the time and people just rave over them. They are gone as soon as I set them on the counter at parties and people have taken some and hidden them so they do not miss out. People refer to these as Reese's on crack - SO GOOD!!! These are good as written but I usually use milk chocolate chips instead of semi sweet.

This recipe was very easy and quick to make. Great for unexpected company and kids! I think there is a bit to much butter in it for my taste, next time I will only use 1/2 cup instead. I used natural peanut butter and everything turned out fine. Definitely needs to stay in the fridge though! ;-)

This is very nice - sweet and really rich, but nice.  In order to really make it taste like a peanut butter cup, you need to add a little salt to the peanut butter layer.

Chocolate and peanut butter = the best combination ever!  Just like Reeses, but maybe a bit sweeter.  Very easy!  I made half the recipe and used an 8x8in pan, and was able to cut it into 16 bars.  Next time I will line the pan with foil or plastic wrap, so that I can remove them from the pan, then cut into squares (I had some trouble getting the first piece out and the corners).  I might double the chocolate layer next time too.

Absolutely delicious.  Definitely satisfies that PB/Chocolate craving.  As a child they would serve these to us at school and called them "peanut butter candy."  I have looked forever for this recipe.  Wonderful!

these are delicious! i pack my fiances lunch for work every morning, and i try to make sure there's a home made treat in there for him everydsy. I just made these and they are quick and simple an oh so tasty. the only thing i did differently was add 5 tbs peanut butter to the chocolate chips instead of just 4 because the mixture was still a tad too bitter, and i used 1 1/2 sticks of butter as opposed to 2.

What an unbelievable recipe!!!  This was SOOOO easy to make, and it was incredibly good.  I didn't have graham cracker crumbs (pre-done).  I used my amazing Vitamix and it used about two packages of graham crackers ground up.  Each package seemed to make one cup of crumbs.  Will make this again and again.  This is going in my cookbook, for sure!!!  The only thing that confused me on this recipe is the serving of 12…  This made WAY more than 12 bars.  To get 12 bars, you would have to cut these into enormous bars…  I made decent size squares and it came out to be about 42 squares.

I am so happy to have stumbled across this recipe!  I can eat peanut butter by the spoonfuls, and adding chocolate just puts me on cloud 9!  Using only 1.5 sticks of butter my base came out a little dry.  I would like the PB flavor to come out a little more than the graham cracker, so I may add bit more PB next time and see how that turns out.  Processing the graham crackers and melting the ingredients as suggested work great.  Many thanks for the recipe and all the suggestions!

WOW!!! These were delicious and very easy to make.   I took someone elses suggestion and cut down on the butter.  I only used 1 1/2 sticks and they still turned out great!!  I highly recommend this recipe.

I had to modify this recipe because of what I had at home, and it was still great. I put the graham crackers in the blender to get them really fine, and since I didn't have enough, I used Quaker Oatmeal Square cereal blended as well. I also used natural peanut butter (organic from Costco) and had to cut the amount down to 2/3 cup because of the strong peanut taste. I also took the advice of another reader and cut the bars after they had cooled for 10 min, and then let them cool the rest of the way- the chocolate doesn't break as much.

I tried reducing the butter by 1/2 stick as another reviewer suggested but the results were drier and more crumbly than I would have liked.  I will try this recipe again as written.  Good taste and easy.

I made these last night and was amazed had they turned out. Just like the picture you see. And I used a food chopper to ground up the graham cracker, this made it easier.  I'm not crazy about peanut butter, but I had others to try them out. Was told they were to die for, so I will be making them again. A keeper. Thanks

LOVE the ease and taste - only thing I was disappointed in was that I "lost" some of them to cracked tops or crumbly peanut butter bottoms that fell apart (which surprised me, b/c I used the whole 2 sticks of butter it called for, thinking that would help hold it together - seemed too dry without.) Maybe I should have pressed into the pan harder, and scored/cut the top before they fully chilled. Regardless, they were VERY well received and hubby (not a sweets guy) gave an "Oh my..." when he tried one (and went back for more...)

Chocolate and peanut butter go together like heaven. This recipe is quick and easy and always tastes amazing. The bars are also very rich so you can cut them small and it serves a lot of people. It's one of my go-to recipes.

I didn't have the chocolate chips but I did have some unsweetened chocolate. I used the equal amount of that (with a TON of added sugar to make it sweet) and ended up with it thick instead of runny but I put it over the mixture like frosting.. and despite that, this was still the best bars EVER!! I cannot wait to go to the store and get proper chips for this! I could have eaten the 'crust' all by itself!

Taste very much like a Reeses Peanut Butter Cup! Excellent and super easy. Next time I may add a 1/2 cup more grand cracker crumbs, came out a little too smooth. Not that smooth is to complain about! I don't put five stars on anything that doesn't deserve it. A very quick, no fuss dessert.

These were alright. They are very very very rich! Better the second day, but I probally won't make them again. They really did not get firm, so they were soft and mushy.

These taste awesome!!  I tried a couple substitutions, and it came out splendidly!!  Instead of graham cracker crumbs, I used Oreo Cookie crumbs, and instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips, I used 72% dark Swiss chocolate.  Those substitutions made them extra chocolatey, but you can still enjoy the PB taste under it!!

awesome...!  I am a huge fan of anything peanut butter and this is superb.  Definitely follwo recs to cool PB layer in fridge for 30 minutes or so.  I also used a cuisinart to pulverize the graham crackers.  Would suggest using 2 cups of choc chips instead of just 1.5 cups...Awesome!  I will be freezing half for another time so I don't pork out on the entire pan!

They were just okay. I could not get the graham crackers fine enough so the texture was not quite right. Probably will not try again.

Everytime I make these for anyone, I get asked for the recipe- no fail. They are so gooey and a little messy to eat, but trust me- no one will mind.  Just grab a spoon and dig in :) I use milk chocolate instead of semisweet. Yum!

These were yummy!  just like PB cups. I have tried another version of these and it is not as good as this recipe. My boyfriend says he doesn't like PB and he ate almost the entire pan.  Delish!!!

Used about 1 and a quarter stick of butter instead of 2 sticks and pressed it in an 8x8 pan. Really sweet,so i cant eat too much.  I also cut the chocolate topping to 2 tbsp of butter instead of 4 and it tasted good! Not sure ill make this again though bc i am trying to watch what i eat

OK I used Jif,Hersheys and Keebler Honey Grahams,YUM!It tastes like PB cups!Using it again!Also a Fathers Day success!!!!But,the PB kept sticking to the bottom of the pan,so I may use around half the chocolate on top and half on bottom to sandwich it...it may be worth it!I'll update it next time I make it,it may turn out like a PB cup,a goal for sure! :-)

So freakin good. I needed chocolate and peanut butter because I was PMSing and this was recommended to me by Coot226. It was exactly what I needed. I used I can't believe it's not butter sticks and used low fat graham crackers and the turned out awesome. It does taste like peanut butter cups. If you love peanut butter cups you have to try this.

I love making candies, and have tried numerous recipes for my peanut butter balls that I am famous (in my family, atleast) for. I liked my old recipe, but this sounded interesting, so I tried it. OMG! They taste closer to Reeses than anything I have ever tried. This is my new recipe. I make them into balls, freeze, and dip them in chocolate bark instead of the (easier) bar way. THis makes for greeat food gifts that (I promise) will highly impress folks!

Wow, they really are like peanut butter cups! I only used 3/4 cup butter (1 and 1/2 sticks), which worked fine and made them a touch healthier. I think the longer these sit, the better because the graham crackers get nice and soft. And by the way, I doubled the recipe, and one 14.4 oz package of graham crackers was the perfect amount (when crushed) to equal 4 cups.

These are good.  I took other's advice and cut the butter back to 1.5 sticks.  The bar is a little crumbly but not too much so.  I will definitely make these again!

These are so much like Reese's peanut butter cups! My kids and co-workers went nuts for these. I only had 1/2 cup semi sweet chocolate chips so I subbed the rest with milk chocolate and it turned out fine.

I hate peanut butter cups, but I like these. Most people raved about them. I did adjust the recipe to use more peanut butter and less butter, for better flavor.

I used 1-1/2 sticks butter and it turned out just fine.  I love chocolate and peanut butter.  This turned out too sugary though.  Think I'll try 1-1/2 cups sugar next time.  It was good.  I was just expecting better I guess.

Delicious bars, although they didn't have a lot of peanut butter taste.  I only used one cup of sugar and then next time I make them I think I'll skip the sugar completely and add more peanut butter.  I also used a 9X9 pan so that my bars were thicker.

I can't keep my husband away from these! He said they taste just like Reese's Peanut Butter Cups (his favorite). I only used 1 1/2 sticks of butter and they still turned out great.

These were very rich, and with only 2 in our house it was hard to eat it all. Probably wouldn't make it again unless I would take it to a party/potluck.

Fantastic recipe -- very easy and  absolutely delicious!  Like some of the other reviews, I found that these can be a little gooey, so I added an extra 1/2 cup of graham cracker crumbs and they came out perfect. And the longer you leave them in the fridge, the better they are! 

Love this recipe :)

Being that there are over 500 reviews there is no need to put up another one... however, I can't help it. These are OUT OF THIS WORLD - CRAZY GOOD.

I did not think I needed to use a whole cup of butter, so I just did a 1/4 cup like someone else suggested. I don't ever have graham crackers, so I just decided to use wheat flour. It worked great! I just added a little cinnamon for the graham flavor. I only had milk chocolate chips, but they were way too sweet, so I added a couple T of cocoa. Anyway, they were good even though I made tons of adjustments! Thanks!

Wonderful!!!  My roommates and I loved it and it's so rich that you're totally satisfied with a few bites (no gorging myself on the whole batch in one night!)  The only thing I might change is using one stick of butter instead of two, because the butter taste is really strong.

Wonderful recipe. My wife eye's lit up after the first bite. Very rich was her comment. I used a gourmet natural peanut butter. I took the advice of another reviewer and refrigerated the peanut butter mixture before adding the chocolate (about 15 - 20 min).

Pretty good in theory, but they are too buttery and not peanutbuttery enough. Next time I make it I'll use half the butter and twice the peanut butter.

Very fast and easy.  I used Smuckers natural peanut butter.  They turned out fine.  Natural peanut butter is thicker, so maybe it gave a good consistency.

These are great!  I love the recipe as is, but for a healthy twist I use coconut oil and added wheat germ for the crust and low fat graham crackers. I also use dark chocolate chips for the top and instead of spreading over the crust I dot the chocolate and use a fork to make a marble design.  These are GREAT!

Yum yum yum! As suggested by someone else, I used only 1.5 sticks butter. Too good. I won't be able to let myself make these very often. Kids, hubby, friends love them.

I took these to work and they were gone in no time.  Good thing I tried one before I put them out.  They were delicious, but a little too soft and were falling apart when I cut them - not sure how to fix that - maybe more graham cracker?

The best ever....I have replaced the semi-sweet chips with milk chocolate (11 oz) and also add Reeses peanut butter chips (11 oz).  It is very, very rich & decadent!

It was a little dry on the bottom, I'd recommend using a little less icing sugar than recommended. Also, smooth peanut butter is much better than chunky peanut butter.

I made these tonight due to craving something sweet. Wow! These are so easy to make and do really taste like a peanut butter cup. I used a mini chopper to make the graham cracker crumbs more smooth, but other than that followed the rest of the recipe completely.My family really liked them and my husband said "these are awesome!" and ate 3 of them. Next time I will try to make the mini peanut butter cups as another reviewer suggested.

Wow!  My husband loves Reese's peanut butter cups and he went crazy for these!  I made these for Christmas Eve and everyone loved them.  I did take another reviewer's suggestion to melt the peanut butter in a pan with the butter for the base...made mixing it all together much easier.  Will definitely be making these again!!

Very rich so cut them small. I used organic PB and kept them refrigerated. It worked out well and they were consumed quickly at a staff luncheon. Good amount of icing too. Very easy!

I love pretty much anything peanut butter and chocolate. This recipe filled that craving perfectly. I enjoy the tiny bit of texture you get from the graham crumbs. I decreased the butter by 1/4 cup and added 1/4 cup more peanut butter. I also made this recipe in a 8x8 pan. I only used 1 cup of chocolate chips and 2 tbsp. of peanut butter for the topping as well. I thought the chocolate would be to thick if I used the full amount.

I made a few adjustments to this recipe. First off I used Adams Natural peanut butter, yum. I only used one cup of butter and because I don't like things too sweet, I only used one cup of confectioners sugar. I also substituted semi-sweet chocolate chips with Ghirardelli 60% cacao chips. The bars came out delicious! So if you like things more savory than sweet, these adjustments work perfectly.

Awesome!!  I followed someone else advise and melted butter & peanut.  Then added Conf. sugar and graham cracker crumbs (make sure the crumbs are fine - I chopped mine up in a food processor).

These ARE just like Reese's cups!  Wow!  These are excellent, but the recipe makes a lot.  If you are a dieter, you may want to half the recipe or plan to give a few away.  Considering how good these taste, they cannot possibly be good for you!  I'll eat them anyway!

I love these bars and have had them a lot, but this is the first time I ever made them.  This recipe was perfect!  I actually only used 3/4c. butter and 1 1/2c. confectioners sugar and it was perfect for us.  The PB mixture had a bit of a crisp to it also, which we loved!  Almost like the texture of rice krispies.  I did find the PB mixture a bit challenging to spread, so I spread it as well as I could and placed the pan in the freezer for ten minutes and it was a lot easier to finish spreading it out.  For thicker bars use a dish a bit smaller than 9x13.  Great recipe!!

This was absolutely FABULOUS! Everyone loved them. The only change I made was to use milk chocolate instead of semi sweet! I also would suggest more refridgerator time..mine took several hours to firm up..but firmed up nicely!

these were okay, sorta stuck to the pan/crumbled when trying to cut them...also the grahams in them made them sorta gritty? overall i can see why people like them, it will curb your pb/choco craving =)

These are the absolute best peanut butter bars! Everyone loved them. I followed the advice of some of the other reviews: I melted the butter and peanut butter together at first, much easier to mix, I also put the crust in the fridge while I made the top so it would stiffen. These are definitely a keeper!

Woweeee!  After two trips to the grocery store (don't ask me why we didn't have powdered sugar!), I was amazed at how great these tasted.  I accidentally greased the pan, but it was still yumazing!  I was worried because when I poured the peanut butter mixture into the pan it looked goopy, liquidy, and didn't look like it would EVER solidify-but it did-beautifully!  Thanks!

These are my fav! Since I love pnut butter I added more pnut butter to the base and put it in the fridge before adding chocolate topping.  Also reduced pnutbutter in choc topping to 1 Tbs.

Followed recipe except I put one less tablespoon of PB into the chocolate mixture. I used Ghiradelli Semi Sweet chips (which are my fav) and it was delicious. I thought the taste was really similar to Reese's, but my only complaint is that the PB Base was not creamy enough for my liking. It stuck together well (even at room temperature) but it had a slightly grainy texture. I even made sure to put the graham crackers in my food processor so the crumbs were really fine. I think next time I will try what someone else recommended--add at least a half cup more peanut butter into the "base" mixture. That should help the creaminess a bit. I hope!

Really liked these bars. It was just the right amout of peanut butter and chocolate. MIne turned out a little crumbly. I tried to decrease the amount of butter not a good idea. They still tasted great.

Good Stuff!  If you like chocolate, I would increase the chocolate chips to 2 cups because the top layer was a little on the thin side.  Very tasty!

These are great.  Taste similar to peanut butter cups.  Very rich and decadent so you can only eat little pieces.  I processed whole graham crackers into crumbs.  Best if processed very finely.  I also used a whole bag of semi swet chips, and it only deposits a thin layer of chocolate, which is fine with me.

Brother and fiance loved them. They do taste very similar to Reeses. I took the rec. of a previous reviewer and let the peanut butter mixture refrigerate for about 15 minutes before adding the chocolate layer.

So easy and so good!
I took the advice from other reviews and used 1.5 cups of pb in the base and cooled the base before putting the chocolate on top.
I used all natural peanut butter when I made these.
The do taste very similar to a certain name brand peanut butter cup.
I love the no-bake factor of these.  Will be making them again.

This was a big hit!  I liked it better the day after I made it, so I would recommend making it a day ahead of time if possible.

These taste just like Reeses' cups, but better!  I chilled the peanut butter mixture in the freezer for a few minutes before pouring the chocolate on top, it helps keep the two layers separate.

This was a huge hit at work! I've made the recipe twice but changed a couple things because I found them a bit too sweet. First I used crunchy peanut butter, I cut the sugar to about 1-1/4 cup of confectioners' sugar and added 1/2 cup of peanut butter to the bottom layer and chilled them over night. We all loved them!

These are sooo good. I just had to send it to my bestfriend in Texas. We both have families that love Peanut Butter cups. It's a big hit.

LOVE these. I use one stick butter and only one cup of powdered sugar. I use one and a half cups Smuckers natural peanut butter and they are delicious. I also add a 1 tsp of butter to the chocolate mixture instead of more PB- it turns out fantastic, all chocolaty and prefect.

I have made this a million times and get rave reviews every time.

It never set.  Unlike the photo, I could not cut the bars, because it was a gooey mess.  I don't think I did anything wrong.  If I'd try making these again (which I doubt), I'd reduce the amount of peanut butter.

These were pretty good. I think I added too much graham cracker out of fear (from other reviews) that the peanut butter mixture wouldn't set. This made a bunch so I took them to work...my co-workers loved them!

Made these for an army family day potluck and they were a hit but unfortunately it was warm outside so the chocolate top didnt stand up to tyhe heat. Brought the rest home to stick in the fridge and they were ok again.

Taste like Reese's cups to us. My son even requested this for his birthday. We LOVE it! I use crunchy peanut butter for the crust and creamy with the chocolate chips.

Wow.  These should be classified as a controlled substance they are so good and so addictive.  I only changed the recipe slightly by adding some milk chocolate in with the semi sweet and I also used natural organic peanut butter with no ill effects.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Absolutely awesome! I cut the butter in half, I cut the sugar a little, just to cut calories some. I melted the butter and pb together, and mixed the sugar with the crumbs, then mixed the  melted butter and pb in. I froze the pb mixture for 10 minutes before frosting.

this tastes exactly like peanut butter cups! i also melted the butter and peanut butter together and used a 12 oz bag of milk chocolate chips instead of semi-sweet chips. chill the peanut butter filling first, then spread the chocolate...much easier to spread. i will make this frequently.

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe, but was out of chocolate chips.  I used 3 squares unsweetened chocolate plus 4 tbsp sweetened condensed milk with the chocolate mixture.  I also chilled the bottom crust before putting on the chocolate topping.

These were quick and easy to make, and definitely satisfy the sweet tooth. I did everything in the microwave.  Melted the butter first, which softened the peanut butter well enough to make it easy to mix.  Then used the same bowl to make the topping in the microwave.  Taste pretty darn close to a Reeses for me - I did use 1 cup semi-sweet and 1/2 c. milk chocolate chips.  I'm wondering for the people who mention the "butter" taste, if they are using real butter or margarine?  I used real butter.  They are crumbly and I will store them in the fridge, but I don't mind that.  Next time I will try putting the graham crackers in the food processor to get the crumbs super fine.  I had a couple extra Tbsp. of crumbs so just tossed them in rather than wasting them.

I melted the butter on the stove and just added the peanut butter in. After everything melted I added the other ingredients in. Firming the peanut butter in the fridge before adding the chocolate top is a must.

Perfect recipe for us! My daughter cannot have milk so she has never had a peanut butter cup, this recipe tasted almost exactly like it.  I used half the amount of margarine, and not as much semi sweet choc. for topping.

Not sure what happened here... but the peanut butter base was not firm. I poured it in to the pan thinking "this needs to be thicker I know it does" but thought maybe after it was in the fridge it would firm up. I should have gone with my insticts and added much more powdered sugar!!! AWESOME flavor, but needed tweaking

I made these bars last weekend and they didn't last very long.  I followed the directions exactly, except I used milk chocolate chips.  I also froze the PB mixture for about 15 minutes before I put the chocolate mixture on, and then I froze it for another 15 minutes.  I also put a layer of waxed paper in the pan first.  When they had froze slightly, I simply pulled the waxed paper out, and I cut the bars neatly on the counter.  Will make again this weekend for family campout!

Boy, these just don't last long at our house.  I've quit buying the peanut butter cups and just make these when we have a craving for them.

If you are on a diet...DO NOT make these! I had to freeze these before I ate half the pan.  Way too easy to make.

My husband loved these! They were OK to me but I didn't expect to like them because peanut butter cups aren't at the top of my favorite treats. If you have a peanut butter and chocolate lover in your family they will love you for making these. I had to store mine in the fridge though or they would be too messy.

Never tried it but...If I wanted WHITE Squares for a Black & White party...I would coat them with white chocolate or almond bark instead of milk chocolate or semi-sweet morsels.  

This recipe is quick, easy, and delicious.

I am definitely going to have to pass these out to the neighbors or else I will eat them all!!  They are so quick  to make with ingredients that I always have on hand.  This is now my official go-to desert when I need something last minute.  I did add everything in the sauce pan and melted it all together.  Then I let it cool in the fridge while I made the topping.  The graham crackers are definitely better than the rice crispies found in some bars--I may even add another 1/2 cup next time.  Oh, and the little bit of peanut butter in the chocolate topping tones down the semi-sweet chips... Good stuff!

These were exceptional.  I always took the advice of the previous reviewers and upped the PB to 1 1/2 cups and melted it with the butter.  I also increased the grahm cracker to 1 1/2 cups and I decreased the chocolate chips to 1 cup.  No major changes and everyone enjoyed the results!

I love this recipe and I have made it several times already. I made some changes to the recipe; I use 1/2 cup of butter instead, and 1 cup of confectioner's sugar instead. I also added a layer of homemade whipped cream on top of the chocolate layer and chilled all together to make a three layer cake instead of bars. Just whip a half pint of whipping cream until it is very thick and creamy, mix some confectioner's sugar into it (a few tablespoons depending on how sweet you want it), and then layer over the chocolate layer. Make sure the chocolate layer is at least semisolid so it doesn't mix.  Chill all of it for about an hour.  The homemade whipped cream chilled makes it so wonderful.

I have had much better peanut butter bars. I really didn't care too much for these ones. They needed more of a peanut butter taste. They were really lacking flavor.

I tweeked the recipe just a tad, which I shouldn't do the first time around.  It's hard to give it a correct review if you don't "go by the book" so to speak.  I used extra chunky peanut butter and added an add'l 2 tbl to the graham crackers.  I doubled the recipe for the chocolate topping.  It really tastes like a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.  Next time I'm going to try creamy peanut butter, roll up the graham/peanut butter mixture into balls, dip them into the chocolate.  Great recipe!  Thank you.

Made the recipe as stated...My husband and I are peanut butter lovers but this bar just didn't do it for us! If I could give it 3.5 stars, I would since many other people at the picnic LOVED it - the teenagers especially. I passed on the recipe, but I will not make it again. Thanks for sharing though!

YUM!  I did have to add some extra peanut butter to make it taste just right, but other than that, this was fantastic!  It is very rich and filling though, so don't make my mistake and serve it immediately after uber-rich chicken marsala - you won't be able to finish a square!  :)

GREAT! My kids (11 & 5) made these and had so much fun. EASY! I didn't have enough peanut butter for the 4 T in the frosting but we didn't notice. I want to try them with chunky peanut butter and extra chocolate on top next time. What an awesome treat for Christmas friend giving gifts.

WOW!!  These are fantastic!  I made them as the recipe said, except followed the advice to melt the pb with the butter.  I also put them in a smaller pan to make them thicker.  Perfect!  Love that you don't need to heat up the oven-perfect for Summer treats!!  This is a new favorite-I can't wait to bring it someplace!

Very good--they do taste like pnb cups! Make sure you serve them immediatly out of the fridge as they soften really quickly. (TIP: NOT good for cookouts!!!) Otherwise a really yummy treat--kids love 'em!

Great Recipe. Difficult to remove from pan. I will have to make with only 1/2 c butter and 1c sugar. Overall, will make again. My super picky son who loves Reece's loved these! Thanks

OMG these were fantastic! I made them for a party and they were a big hit. I brought some home with me and could not leave them alone until they were gone. I can't wait to make them again. Super easy to make and taste just like my favorite Reeses Peanut Butter cups.

Definitely hit the spot.  I used only 1 stick of butter and lessened the powdered sugar by about 1/2 c.  It worked well for me.  I also lined my pan with was paper and chilled the peanut butter mixture a few minutes before sticking the chocolate on top. I used milk chocolate chips and only 1 cup of them--which was plenty!  After I melted the chips, I poured it over the PB mixture and spread with a knife--fast and easy.  Love this recipe! I think it would also be great using rice krispies instead of graham crackers.  Yum...

Yum! Yum! I made these with natural peanut butter and only 1 1/2 sticks butter. They held up really well and were not crumbly. I only added a heaping teaspoon of p.b. to the chocolate. Also I cooled p.b. mixture while I melted the chocolate. I didn't have any problems with chocolate seeping into p.b. mixture.

Very good, very easy, but a little messy to prepare. I think the pb part is a bit sweet so I might cut down on the sugar by a little bit, also might cut down on  the butter, but only for the sake of the waistline!

OKey, so I made these the other day, and I was kinda dissapointed. For one... Way to much butter,maybe you need half that. I used 1 cup, and my "crust" was more like "mush". Maybe not so much sugar, too. 1 1/2 cups insead. So even after they were chilled, they were a bit hard to get out of the bowl in one piece.  However, the flavor was so good, just like a PB cup. If you alter the recipe a bit, and your a die hard PB and choc, fan like me... You'll love it. I will try this one again.

With my being more of a cook than a baker I was quite impressed with my results here!  I took the advice of previous reviewers and lined with some parchment paper... excellent advice!  My bars came out quick and were easy to cut after spending about 15-20 minutes in the fridge.  They taste great and already are almost gone.  Thanks for such a great... and definetly reuseable recipe!

This is excellent!  Me and my fiance ate a whole pan of it in a few days :) 

The only inconvenience was that it needed to be refridgerated all the time as it was kinda melty.  But it was good cold any way.

Also, next time I will not add peanut butter to the chocolate topping because we both agreed it made the whole thing TOO 'peanut buttery' ;)

These were a hit! I brought them to a gathering and they were begging me to give them the recipe! The peanut butter part was a little grainy, because of the graham cracker crumbs.  This recipe was SO EASY, too! Definitely a keeper!

Woo-Hoo! Not only was this super quick and easy to make, but these were oh-so-tasty, too! I made a half-batch, cut them into small squares (thinking they would last longer-ha!) and the entire pan was gone in a day and a half. The only downside to this yummy recipe is that I ate about 1/2 the pan myself! I also melted the peanut butter with the choc chips and used boxed graham crumbs, so this was not gritty at all--tasted just like my favorite candy. Thanks :-)

I was really disappointed in this recipe.  It didn't in any way, taste like a peanut butter cup.  The chocolate was SO over powering (usually not a bad thing).  The peanut butter was 'deadened' by the addition of the graham cracker crumbs. I did like the texture, but that was about it.  I won't be making these again.

These were great!  I didn't realize I had very little chocolate chips on hand so I melted a couple of leftover Hershey Crisp bars from the treat jar.  It came out great and the crispies were a nice addition.  People commented it tasted like peanut butter cups to them without me saying anything - I had a hard time getting them out of the pan with the chocolate still attached to the peanut butter, but I think that was because of the way I melted it.

I agree that these are very easy to make - and a real treat. While they do have the flavour of a popular peanut butter cup, you can detect the grittiness of the graham wafer crumbs. So, that's the reason for the 4 stars.

These are pretty good.  This recipe is easily halved.  The peanut layer flattens out nicely if you shimmy your pan and I think next time I'll chill that layer a little bit before adding the chocolate and I may try milk chocolate chips.

Awesome recipe and SO easy.  I made the dish and was worried it would not be good because it was so easy, but it was a HIT.  I brought it to work for a pot luck and have gotten many compliments.  This recipe is one I will make again and again!

I started to make this for a church event- when I realized I didn't have enough graham cracker crumbs. lol I need to get into the habit of measuring my ingredients BEFORE I start cooking. 

So I had to cut the recipe in half. I then let it set in a small spring foam pan which was the best thing I could have done. The peanut butter bar looked like a peanut butter cup & it was very easy to then cut the bar into pieces and distribute. I found the bars to be very rich- so I cut them into tiny pieces (made about 25). It was just the perfect amount of sweetness, anymore I think would have been too much to eat! I got rave reviews and had one person beg me for the recipe. 

Overall, a crowd pleaser!

These were really good, but I think some people would find them too rich.  The peanut butter portion had a fudge-like consistency, and I had expected a drier crust. I followed another reviewer's advice and cut the bars into squares after they had been in the refrigerator for about 15 minutes, which worked out great.

My husband is a peanut butter fan and let me tell you...he was in heaven when he had his first bar! These had great texture, a bit stiffer then a peanut butter cup, but I prefer it that way. They did crumble a bit, but it got better as they were refrigerated longer...we were too impatient and wanted to try almost immediatley!! sooooo good! Will defintely make again.

At the last minute, I realized I was out of graham crackers, but I had some Honey Butter Ritz crackers, so I thought what the heck.  Turned out great, DH ate 1/4 of the pan by himself last night.  Can't wait to try them with the graham crackers.

Pretty good!  Very quick and easy recipe!  At first I thought it was a little odd to mix the graham crackers in with the peanut butter.  It ended up being very good and I liked the crunch of the graham crackers mixed in with the peanut butter.

The recipe submitter is not kidding!  These do taste like peanut butter cups!  I made these in a 8x8 pan, but that might have been a mistake, as they are very rich!  But I do love them.  Next time I'll follow the recipe, just halve it to make less.

Not as good as Special K bars, but very good. Taste like a candy bar, but I think I prefer the special k cereal bars 
' chewy-ness ' better. :)

I can't believe how simple this was.  It was gone in 2 days in my house.  My boyfriend who isn't a big sweets eater ate most of it.  :)  This is a definite keeper! YUMMY!!!!

I thought these bars were scrumptious...very rich but a hit at a neighborhood party.  The graham cracker crumbs leave a bit of a grainy texture but they are really good!

If you're looking for something quick and easy to satisfy that sweet tooth, this is the recipe for you!  They do remind me of peanut butter cups.  I threw these together for a school luncheon, and they got great reiews!  Be sure to allow plenty of time for them to set up.  I was afraid that mine would be too runny, but they were firm enough after refrigerating overnight.  My husband and kids loved these bars, so I'm planning on adding them to my list of Christmas goodies!

The graham cracker crumbs areessential, but I really think this calls for WAY too much butter. The bar was okay, just too HEAVY of a snack for me. Super sweet and dense..

WOW!!  What an easy but amazing tasting dessert..I can't believe how GOOD this tastes.  I used 1/2 cup butter and thought it was perfect.  I also melted the peanut butter with the butter to make everything easier to mix.  Now that I've tried this recipe, I will be making all the time.

I made these bars for my crew and they all really seemed to enjoy them.  They went fast and got big compliments.  The only thing i didn't like about them was they were a little too rich and not all that healthy but on the up-side they were easy to make, perhaps using more peanut butter and less sugar will help do the trick. (they really did taste like peanut butter cups)

Unreal!  These are absolutely amazing!  I usually only make half a batch when I try a new recipe in case it's a real doozy, but I'm so glad I didn't!  These will be gone in no time.  I used milk chocolate chips since I'm not a fan of semi-sweet.  It's wasn't too sweet, just perfect, and just like Reeses.  YUM!

I made these bars to take to a meeting. I told my roommate that she could have the leftovers when I came home, but there weren't any! She was very disappointed so I made her another pan :) If you make these bars, expect them to disappear quickly.

Good, fast, kids loved it.  It is really sweet, but made a great dessert for a picnic in the park.  I used the food processer on the graham crackers, and though the texture is a bit 'grainy'...there isn't really any way around that...graham crackers are grainy.  It's good...try it!

Great!  These are a danger to any peanut butter loving choco-holic!!  I did not have enough graham crackers to make 2 cups.. I used a little of everything to make up the difference.. pretzels, crackers and a couple different kinds of cereal!  Turned out wonderful!

Tasty!  They do need to set up in the refrigerator before cutting, but they were hard to cut after I let them chill for about 5 hours.  The chocolate fell off the peanut butter...it was a mess.  I was able to cut them in perfect squares after they softened a bit.  They also taste better when soft, so I'd recommend only refrigerating if needed after they're cut.  I didn't find them grainy at all, but I did use a food processor for the graham crackers.  And I didn't substitute milk chocolate chips, I don't think it's necessary.  Great recipe!

These were good but a little too sweet for me. If I make them again I might try substituting half the sugar for powdered milk - also may help with the grainy texture - if you don't like that (I actually did.) Tasty but extremely unhealthy. Had to give 4 stars

I thought these were very good, but, like other reviewers, I found them to be a tad grainy. I'm not sure there is a way around that; I mixed all the ingredients together very well. I also used chunky peanut butter, which gave the bars a  nice crunch. I used more chocolate than the recipe called for, but I actually think that was too much chocolate for the topping; I won't use as much next time. This was quite easy and good for hot summer days when turning on the over seems like too much effort. The bars are very rich, so a small piece goes a long way.

These are very good.  I followed the recipe except I used chunky peanut butter because I like the crunch.  I will make these again but next time I will use 2 cups of peanut butter with the sugar and crackers.  I will also use more pb in the topping and use the pb & chocolate chip swirls.  I just really like more taste of peanut butter.  That 9x13 pan is just perfect for these bars.

Fantastic!  Melted the butter and peanut butter together as another reviewer suggested.  I also added 2 Tbs butter with the chocolate chips and peanut butter for the top layer. Halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan, but will double the recipe next time.  They didn't last long!

5 stars for easiness and 5 stars for tasting fabulous!  I brought them to work for potluck and everyone inhaled them!  Nobody thought they were too grainy as some people had said and I did the recipe to the letter - don't change a thing!

A little sweet for me and it made a huge batch. If cut in small squares they are pretty good, can't eat more then 2 though.

These were so easy to make, I nearly tried it with my eyes closed!  Seriously though... I used buttered foil and it came off like a dream.  I also used more chocolate chips for the top in order to make it a touch thicker.  Delicious!

Yummy!!  very easy. I half followed advise of another reviewer, halfway thru melting butter, I added in the peanut butter.  I also half chunky and half creamy peanut butter.  Will definitely make this again.

So simple to make!  I loved the texture the graham crackers (finely crushed) gave to the bar.  They are definetly a crowd pleaser, just don't tell your guests how much fat and calories are in a single bar.

I remember having these as a kid and they tasted much better. They tasted kind of "gritty" because of the graham cracker crumbs. I will use more peanut butter next time. There wasn't quite enough peanut butter flavor.

Awesome recipe!!  I was looking for something fast and that I didn't have to heat up my oven for because it's been 115 degrees where I live.  These were so easy to put together and everyone loves them.  3 people asked me for the recipe.  Delicious!!  Thanks so much!!

I don't think I've ever made bars this good, this fast.  This is truly an easy and delicious recipe.  I didn't have any problems cutting them, or removing the bars from the pan...they were perfect.

So yummy!! I was a little worried when I first made them that they would be too soft because the mixture was soft, but after an hour in the fridge, they were a perfect consistancy! 

The only change I made was to use milk chocolate chips. 

I will be making these again for sure!

These were pretty good! However, a few changes would improve them.  My sister in-law melts a "Symphony" bar over the top instead of using semi-sweet choc. chips.  She also uses less of the peanut butter filling to make them a little thinner.  Still yummy!

Fabulous! I made these for a family get-together, and they were a huge hit. My aunt said that she thinks they are better than Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. My husband had me make another pan to take into work tomorrow. This will definitely be a "go to" recipe.

This recipe should be better named "A Peanut Butter Lover's Heavan" I crushed up a GOOD brand of graham crackers in the food processor, melted everything in the microwave. Instead of a 9x13 pan I used a 9x9 pan to make extra thick bars. A very good recipe, not met anyone who did not like them, have lots of milk on hand. Very rich and tasty.

These bars are too easy and too good. They are rich, so cut them smaller than normal bars. By far the best Peanut Butter Cup Bar recipe out there--definately a keeper!

Yum!  They DO taste like Peanut Butter Cups, only as though they were made with crunchy peanut butter.  Also softer than the cups are.  To melt chips in a 1000 watt microwave, zap them on high temperature for 30 seconds at a time, stirring each stop, until melted.  Followed recipe exactly...no complaints except my sister thought they were too rich.  Keeps fine in the fridge but you can't leave them at room temperature for long before they get mushy.

I melted the chocolate on the stove and it was super easy. No cooking really. FAST treat if you are in the mood for something NOW (which at 9 months pregnant, I AM! But as they sat and tried them later, not so sweet to me. Kind of bland tasting. Dont think I will make them again. GOod fresh, I am mixed. Would maybe bring them to a get together, And would try to add REAL sugar, not powdered sugar. at least 1 cup of each i think that would make a big difference.

This was a pretty good recipe. I thought it could be a little better, but my husband approved and he's a die-hard peanut butter fan.

These are so easy and tasty!!!  I wouldn't change a thing.  I was a little worried about my peanut butter mixture though.  There was no pressing it into the pan, it was more of a spreading consistancy.  I just knew I blew it.  I popped them in the freezer, and now we're enjoying something that tastes sooo close to a peanut butter cup.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was all right.  Nothing great.  Certainly not five stars.  Probably will not make again.

Loved this recipe!  My kids especially enjoyed it since I don't bake too much.  This one was even easy for me, a complete novice in the kitchen!

Excellent, easy recipe; a "must" for any cookie plate, especially at Christmas. Very easy to make and they sure disappear in a hurry. Everyone asks for the recipe. Thanks, Nancy!

Made this recipe at least 4 times this summer.  I always used milk chocolate chips and one time I even used a mix of milk chocolate chips and peanut butter chips.  My friends and family all loved it both ways.  My nieces had a great time helping me make at a cabin we rented over the summer.  I premeasured the peanut butter, sugar, and # of graham crackers before I went to make it easier.  I always kept mine in the fridge or freezer, but I like my candy bars frozen anyway.  Enjoy!

this was real good, but needs more chocolate.  everyone thought that they tasted alot like peanut butter cups.  I halved the recipe because it was toooo sweet.
