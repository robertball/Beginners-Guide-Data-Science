Thank you Sandy for sharing this simple recipe.  I love Cucumbers, and usually fix them by adding salt, pepper, Johnny's Seasoning and a tablespoon or two of Rice Vinegar.  Your recipe is a very refreshing alternative for me.  The fresh squeezed lemon was just right, the Chili powder was unexpected and nobody guessed the seasoning that made it so perfect.  No adjustments necessary, the recipe is perfect just the way it's written.  I will use this a lot.  Already have plans to take it to a BBQ this week end.

I loved the fresh flavor of this salad. I had some cucumbers I wanted to make, but didn't want a salad with mayonnaise or sour cream. I was excited to find this, and hopeful due to the other hesitant reviewers who were pleasantly surprised.  Add me as a fan of this salad!  It was perfect for a warm summer evening.

Quick, easy, refreshing salad.  Would be good with a Mexican meal.  Hubby even loved it! Since I was using local, organic cukes (and not the grocery store cukes with the wax coating) I opted not to peel the cukes because there are nutrients and fiber in the peel. However, I must say that it would have been better if I had peeled the cukes as directed.

This took all of 5 minutes to make. I was hesitant, like other reviewers, about the chili powder, but it ended up being pretty good!

AWESOME!  My husband & I LOVED these!  I didn't include my kids because love isn't even a strong enough word for how much my kids liked these!  2 cucumbers wasn't enough for them, but if I'd made enough to make them happy, they'd have been sick!  FANTASTIC recipe!!!  THANKS SO MUCH for sharing!!!

This was just not for me.  I had hoped to be pleasently surprised by what I thought was an odd combination, but no...  I tried to eat them but threw they out after a few. The lemon juice made the cukes way to tart and I don't know what the chili powder added.  Sorry, but I didn't like them at all and neither did the people at work that tried it out.

Exactly what I was looking for!  I have an abundance of cucumbers and get tired of the sour cream/ yogurt/ vinegar recipes.  LOVE THIS!

This is simple and nice. But I generally mix salt and chill powder and sprinkle over the top just befor serving thats also taste better. Or simply cut the cumcumbers and serve the salt and chill powder mixture on side.

I didn't like the combination of flavors. The chili powder just didn't work in this recipe for me.

This was pretty good.  Liked the fact that it was so light (no fat).  Not sure I am crazy about the chili powder.  Might try cajun seasoning or cumin instead.

Just okay. Hard to beat a plain old oil and vinegar with chopped tomato and onion.

This recipie was great!  Refreshingly different from my old standby using mayo and vinegar.  I thought it was great but hubby said "It's different alright!"  I'll be making it again because it's quick, easy, tasty, and low calorie. Yummy...

Loved this recipe!
Used salad cucumbers.
Peeled, de-seeded & diced them.
Omitted the salt.
This may be my new favorite cucumber recipe.
Thank you!

I'm always searching for light sides for our meals and to take in my lunches.  I had 1 cucumber to use to I thought I'd give this one a try.  First of all it is very salty (too salty for my taste).  Second, there was no big WOW factor here.  Will not be making this one again.

My cucumbers were not as good, but this still was no winner. Pretty bland. I would try it again with a different spice and proportions.

I modified it a little because I prefer cumin to chili powder and I added a dash of cayenne pepper and tomatoes.....a hit with my family, will definately make again.

Interesting - simple, but the results were a bit surprising. I made it exactly as written, but my two cucumbers were one large and one small. I was pleasantly surprised that the lemon juice's tartness was tempered by the other flavors. I ate this by itself, but I think this would make a nice side dish for a Mexican or Southwestern meal. Worth having again.

What a waste of good cucumbers.  Would not recommend to anyone.
