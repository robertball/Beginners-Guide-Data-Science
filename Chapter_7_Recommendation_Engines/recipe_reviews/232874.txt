Excellent. The lack of spices had me thinking this recipe might be a little bland. It's perfect! My wife and I could not get enough. Do not change a thing. This one goes in my recipe box. Thank you.

this was very easy and very yummy! I added ¾ cup of frozen broccoli, 1/3 cup of sautéed onions and a few dashes of garlic powder to the soup mixture for which I used 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1 can of cream of broccoli soup. also, i used only 1/2 cup of melted butter for the stuffing layer. it was really good and the family agreed! I would suggest cooking the egg noodles for only about 2 minutes before adding to the mixture; as prepared, they came out a bit “mushy”. but I will definitely make this again. creamy, yummy comfort food all the way!

I made two of them.  One using Great Value brand (Walmart) cornbread stuffing and one using the same brand chicken stuffing.  When compared to each other, the cornbread one was the bomb!  The kids plowed through it.  The chicken one will be used for leftovers since it's still almost a full pan.  It was received with a "meh" after tasting.  Then everyone kept eating the cornbread one.  Definitely a keeper!

4/21/16..I really liked this recipe!! I did make a couple of changes after reading the reviews & some because of what I had on hand.  I boiled the chicken with seasoning salt made of salt, garlic & celery, so in place of the chicken broth, I used the broth from the chicken & added one bouillon cube.  I used cornbread stuffing, one can of cream of chicken & one can of cream of mushroom,  1/2 c of butter,  & 3/4 c sour cream (because that's all I had) & maybe a couple tablespoons of milk, because the mixture seemed a little dry.  Next time I will have enough sour cream because I think that would've made a difference.  I also sprinkled a little black pepper too.  I will definitely make this again.  I am a big stuffing lover!!...    
5/1/16.. I cut back on the chicken & added thinly sliced ham...delicious!

This is a quick and delicious meal. I work nights and I made this while getting ready for work. My family devoured it. 

I made a few changes to my liking. I seasoned my chicken with salt, pepper, poultry seasoning, sage, and garlic powder before cooking. I sauteed it with half a chopped onion and some minced garlic. 

I'm not sure if it would have been bland without the seasoning, but it tasted great. Definitely serve with some chilled cranberry sauce (jellied) and we had green beans. 

Yum! I will be making this again!

Okay, I am just going to comment on the sauce for this recipe, as I have not tried this dish with stuffing, just chicken and sauce over noodles. - Unless you have tried a sauce made of chicken(or mushroom) soup and sour cream, you really don't know how good it is! I actually usually 'shun' canned creamed soups, just because I prefer made from scratch sauces. But, I was quite surprised at the 'tastiness' of the mixture - cream soup and mayonnaise is also good, surprisingly. I only use one can of soup to each cup of sour cream (or mayonnaise) and it comes out great.

I made this dish vegetarian by using substituting cream of mushroom soup for the cream of chicken soup, substituting vegetable broth for the chicken broth, and substituting Quorn vegetarian chicken filets for the chicken. It was really good, and even my meat-eating in-laws liked it. The flavor was so uniform throughout that I thought it really use something else to change up the flavor and texture. Broccoli might be a good addition to this casserole.

This would be a good recipe for left over turkey and dressing after Thanksgiving. 
It was "just okay."
I don't think I'll make it again until next November when we have leftovers.

Easy and filling but not that fabulous. I did sauté onion and celery for dish and added about 1/2 cup sour cream with other ingredients. Probably won’t make again.

I did one small changes but all in all, it's a very good recipe.  I cut the recipe in half since there is only two of us and added some frozen peas to the mixture for some colour.  My husband said I could make it again.   Thanks.

Better than 4 stars but not really a 5 star.
It's a great last minute meal idea and it freezes really well which is great for us as empty nesters when we freeze half of all casseroles we make. I cut the butter back a bit and it does need some black pepper. Definitely a keeper. You can cook this out of the freezer at 350 covered for 35 minutes then uncover for 25-30 minutes until toasty and bubbly

I made this exactly as the recipe stated. It was delicious. My husband loved it so much that he requested it again the following week. He likes his poured over toasted and buttered English muffin bread.

I did add some onion and garlic sauteing the chicken, just threw everything in together.  Added a few peas but just enough for some color as some people in my family aren't crazy about them. Other than that kept everything the same.  Absolutely EXCELLENT.   I was also, along with some reviewers, thought it may be a little bland but not so.....VERY VERY GOOD.  It's going in my recipe rotation box absolutely!!

This was a hit with my family.  I've made it twice now. The first time I followed the instructions except I didn't have sour cream. I only had about 2 or 3 oz of cream cheese.  I ended up not spreading the stuffing evenly on top so had pockets of salty flavoring. The second time, I didn't use sour cream or cream cheese and it was definitely needed. I also made the stuffing according to the box (so you dont need the butter or chicken stock) and liked it much better. 

For the chicken I always season the chicken before adding it to a recipe or it turns out bland. Will definitely make this one again.

Great idea to put together with vegetables/salad on the side.  I covered it for 15 minutes and uncovered for the last 15 minutes.  But I would REALLY suggest all soups/stuffing mixture be low sodium as I could really taste the salt in all of this.   I will also suggest less butter (although I would love to sit around eating it all day) and a little more chicken broth for moisture.  ADDENDUM:  consumed a lot of water due to the salt/sodium content

LOVE this recipe. I do add more spices though, pepper, a pinch of cayenne, Mrs. Dash and garlic powder. It is my "go to" recipe to take to other people for funerals and potlucks.

Excellent! I loved it and so did my 3 yr old and 1 yr old, which is a miracle. Pickiest eaters EVER! I did however add a bunch of my favorite spices and also a can of green beans.

My family liked this recipe. I only added a little more milk, but no other change was needed.  I am making it again tonight. 
  Thank you for a delicious and easy to use recipe!

The recipe overall was good. Next time I will season the chicken for more flavor. This recipe could easily be made much healthier without changing the flavor. I made it with a homemade cream of chicken soup instead of from the can and it adds the butter flavor without having to put so much butter in the sauce on top. Good recipe, but could be a little better-great starting point for some changes.

Thought it was very good and my family agreed! For me the only criticism was that it was a bit salty. Next time I think I'll try it with low sodium soups and/or unsalted butter, but it was definitely a hit!
