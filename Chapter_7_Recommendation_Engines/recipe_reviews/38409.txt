Yes, rating my own recipe, but mostly to let people know they need to drain the canned corn well and squeeze the liquid from the tomatoes before they chop them. Otherwise, the mixture gets a little soupy as it sits.

Also, use the plain, unsweetened and unflavored rice vinegar. The combination of the rice vinegar with the lime juice creates a cleaner, crisper taste. And for fun, taste and to make it even prettier, don't be afraid to add a little of the lime zest.

I also have found that the "Niblets" type of canned corn seems to work best in this recipe. Either that or very lightly blanched fresh corn.

This is a great warm weather recipe!  I'd only suggest that you be careful with the vinegar; I was preparing it in the middle of the night and not paying close attention.  I added the full 1/3 cup, rather than adding it 'to taste' ... it was really too much (for my taste).  I will be serving this salad again in the next few weeks and will be more careful.

Light, colorful salad with a zippy dressing perfect for a summer barbeque!  I used tomatoes from my own garden and lightly grilled corn on the cob leftover from dinner the evening before.  I found the amount of onions to be somewhat overwhelming on the taste buds, but if you are an onion lover this is the recipe for you. Personally, I will reduce the amount next time I make this recipe as it was quite good.   Thank you for the submission Twila, my family enjoyed it.

Good tasting and very pretty/colorful salad.
I put some romaine lettuce in mine, along with some cucumber.  I subbed white vinegar for the rice, but to give it more zest next time, might try adding red wine vinegar too.

This turned out GREAT!  I used fresh corn off-the-cob, subbed parsley for cilantro, and white vinegar for the rice vinegar.  I made such a large quantity that I had leftovers for a few days, but it was the first thing everybody went for on kitchen raids!

Very good and very simple. Since I'm the only one in the house who likes cilantro, I just used the corn, tomatoes and sweet onions. I blended enough white vinegar with sugar and water, and it was delicious. Thank you for a recipe that takes less than 10 minutes and is so refreshing on a hot summer day!

This recipe was perfect for a summer bbq and everyone loved it.  Very easy and tasty.  I didn't have rice vinegar so i used apple cider vinegar and added some sugar to taste. I used purple onions and it was excellent.

This is a very fresh tasting salad, with no oil, which I enjoy.  The onion was a little overpowering, but that is definitely something I can just cut back on for my taste.

Excellent salad for summer, especially for BBQ's.  I used fresh corn, blanched lightly and Santa Sweets tomatoes, diced.  Red onion went especially well.

It's a really nice summer-salad recipe; if you are a cilantro fan like me.  My friends either love it or hate it.  The salad gets a little watery after it sits.  I think it's the canned corn.

The recipe as it is written is a bit too strong on the onion and cilantro. I made this again using half the onion, some chopped seedless cucumber and a quarter of the cilantro and it was wonderful! The cucumber adds a mild flavor to it that cuts the harshness of the onion and cilantro. Would make again with my modifications.

My family absolutely loves this salad.  I first had it at a friend's BBQ and asked for the recipe. I used frozen sweet corn from Costco (not cooked, just defrosted), and white onion and it needed no sugar at all. I see that some people used different vinegars, but I like the rice vinegar because it has a mellower taste.  As has been stated by others, it tastes better if it sits for several hours.

This was very pretty but bland. I made it for Thanksgiving, because I thought it would make a good side and it pretty much sat untouched.  If I make it again, I will skip the rice vinegar (too sweet) and use something else.

This is a favorite in my house. My girlfriend and children always come back for seconds. The only suggestion I make is that you go easy on the vinegar and onions.

This is very easy and very tasty. Make sure to cut the cilantro small. I tried to be lazy with it and left some pretty big chunks, and that didn't work out so well. Over all, though, the salad tasted excellent! UPDATE - the second, third, fourth, ad infinitum that I've made this, I've put the cilantro and the onion in the food processor. Much more evenly distributed. Delivious. We prefer to eat this as a salsa rather than as a salad.

Easy to make and very fresh tasting.  Made it almost exactly according to the recipe - probably a little less cilantro than it called for because I know not everyone likes it.  This is a keeper!

This is so tasty and refreshing! I used cherry tomatoes cut in half and white vinegar (because that's what I had). I also added a little chopped garlic. It was even better the next day when I ate the leftover for lunch.

Made this tonight as I had all the ingredients and some leftover grilled corn, instead of canned corn. 3 ears of corn for 2 people worked out fine. Used a tube of cilantro, just because I had it. Used red wine vinegar; should have only used 1 tbls as the vinegar taste was a little strong. Hubby loved it and so did I. Made this with an apricot pork chop dish, also from this site.

This salad is amazing...and super easy. I made it in less then 10 minutes. It also tastes even better after it has been chilled and the veggies have a chance to marinate a bit in the vinegar and cilantro.  Very refreshing and could be used as a base for salsa or quesadillas.

We gobbled this up. I didn't have sweet onion so I used a bit less of yellow onion and  diced it fairly small. I don't keep rice vinegar around, so I used a bit of red wine vinegar and put in a pinch of sugar. YUM YUM!

I liked this salad--it was the perfect accompaniment to my tortilla soup.  I don't think I used the full amount of vinegar though.

Quick, easy and tasty. I had it for lunch, but it would be great with chips, or with a Mexican meal. Thanks, Twila!

This wasn't loved by all - we liked all the ingreditents but it just wasn't a hit - I think if I made it again I would try a cidar vinegar rather than the rice vinegar.

The only thing I changed was I only used half the the amount of cilantro. The salad was a hit at our neighborhood block party.  ??????????

I made this and also added a can of rinsed black beans for protein (stirred them in last).  Refreshingly delicious.  I used frozen corn for less sodium. Yum.

Crunchy and fresh!  Loved the rice vinegar and lime with the sweet corn.  It was pretty heavy on the onions, though.  Next time I'll use half an onion instead.

I love this recipe! I bring it for all outdoor picnic/bbqs and always get raves (and requests for the recipe). I add diced cucumber and i actually add a little more of the rice vinegar. It doesn't seem to tart to me and i think the flavors mellow together in the fridge. I try to allow at least 3 hours in fridge to have it nice and cold. Thanks again!

It was pretty to look at, but I made a few mistakes with the recipe. I didn't pay attention to squeezing the tomatoes out to get rid of as much juice as possible, which made it too soupy. I also added all 1/3 cup of vinegar and it was too tangy. Only 1 out of my 5 family members liked this.

This is a terrific salad and looks beautiful!  I used fresh white corn that I cut off the cob after blanching. It was a huge hit and I'll make this often!  Thanks!

Excellent salad. Very flavorable, colorful and tasty. I omitted the rice vinegar since we had none and added about 1 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil. We didn't miss the vinegar at all. The lime juice makes the salad so fresh tasting and really complements the cilantro.

Very tasty!  Neat addition to a meal instead of a side salad.
