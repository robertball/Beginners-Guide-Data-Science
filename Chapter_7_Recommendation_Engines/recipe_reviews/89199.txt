Because I am vegetarian, I substituted vegetable broth for the chicken broth, and a dash of smoke flavoring for the bacon.  This was a delicious soup, and fairly quick to make, too.

Excellent!  Instead of bacon I used a leftover ham bone from Thanksgiving.  I threw it all in a crockpot, cooked it all day, and then  puréed it in the blender.  Be very careful how much salt you add as the ham should have most of what you need.  Save the salting for last.  If you do oversalt, simply mix in small amounts of heavy cream after you purée.

This recipe got rave reviews from a bunch of my friends who claim to not even like split pea soup.

My adjustments were: I dumped everything in a crockpot.  No pre-sauteeing, wanted to see how easy I could make it.  My other adjustments were similar to other peoples (bouillon instead of broth, no leeks, dried rosemary.) 

I saw multiple people mention needing to puree this; if you leave it all day in a crock pot this isn't necessary.  I also added some green beans, which was a nice touch.  All day in a crock pot was fine for the carrots and green beans.

I am not one to use any one recipe over and over again as I believe there may always be a better recipe out there somewhere.  This recipe is one of the few exceptions for me.  As I eat very little meat, I leave out the bacon, but I don't feel that it really detracts from the soup overall.

Good stuff.  Thanks.

This soup was easy to make and very tasty.  In the future I will go with the low sodium broth and probably sub in some water for some of the broth.  I used dried rosemary instead of fresh since I have quite a bit of it in my cupboards.  Also I used turkey bacon instead of regular bacon to cut down on some of the calories and fat.  The turkey bacon provided a very nice flavor.  I prepped the first part of the ingredients in my cast iron skillet, while heating the broth in my crockpot on high.  Once my veggies were softened I transferred the peas and the veggies into the crockpot on high for about an hour and then I turned it down on low to allow it to simmer.  This approach might work for someone who doesn't have a lot of free time or works all day and would like to have the soup ready for dinner.  Just do the prep work and soften the veggies on the stove top and allow the soup to cook all day on low (I kept it on high because I wanted to see how it would turn out).

I love this simple, satisfying soup.  I use pepper bacon for a nice kick, and add lots of fresh ground pepper to the broth.  I use two 32oz boxes of low sodium chicken broth for a nice balanced consistency.

Very tasty, but out of necessity I made a few changes. I didn't have bacon so I threw a pork chop in, substituted my green onions for the small onion, and used the vegetable broth that I already had. Even after making all these changes and measuring like a bachelor, the soup was fantabulous.

This is wonderful soup.  I'm a big soup person and this was exactly what I wanted.  I have only ever had pea & ham soup.  The bacon was very nice.

Will def. make this again.

What a nice soup!  It was easy to make and just right for a Sunday night supper.  I didn't want to buy a whole package of leeks to use just one, so I left that out.  Also, I used 2 cans of broth and 2 cans of water and then sprinkled in a little chicken bullion.  Thanks for the recipe!

WOW! This soup is de-li-cious! The rosemary makes it great and I liked using bacon instead of ham. Also, all the veggies made the soup so different from other split pea soups. I will make this one again, and again, and again!!!!

This was very, very good!  I wasn't sure about adding rosemary to pea soup but am glad I did! It gave the soup a subtle flavor that was different from all other pea soups I have had. I did not have bacon but had a leftover ham bone which I used instead.  Also used an onion instead of a leek. Though I subbed out 2 ingredients it was the rosemary that "made" this soup! Threw it all in the slow cooker for several hours - awesome on a chilly Wyoming evening (even if it WAS the middle of May! :)

This is SO GOOD!  I cooked the bacon and then reserved it, because I hate rubbery bacon.  Followed the directions with the exception that I didn't measure the rosermary, just eyeballed it (and was generous).  After the one hour of simmering, the consistency was soft but with texture-very nice.  I added the bacon back in and just gave a few bursts of my immersion blender to help chop the bacon and blend a tiny bit of peas.  This soup was a hit with my kids and boyfriend, and I will make it a regular in my soup rotation.  It's AMAZING!

I loved this soup. I made this last night for my sick boyfriend who was craving split pea soup.  He loved it, as did I! I added extra garlic. Rosemary and bay leaves give it that extra flavor.  YUM!  Even if you don't think you or your family like split pea soup, I'd try this anyway because it is GOOD!

LOVED this soup. I used already cooked bacon, dried rosemary (1/4 tsp) and omitted the leek. I dumped everything in the crock pot for about 6 hours - 5 on low and the last on high. And it's excellent. So great because I never have a ham bone but I always have bacon on hand.

This split pea soup was absolutely fantastic! The flavors compliment each other beautifully. I froze most of what was left in small portions to bring with me to work and now find myself craving it frequently. 

My only changes were to increase the bacon, putting in a full 12 oz. rather than just six slices. While the bacon was cooking, I also sprinkled in a small amount of liquid smoke, for extra flavor. I also ended up simmering the soup for approximately two hours, giving the peas a lot of time to really become mushy and start to fall apart, becoming a part of the broth. Yummy!

Love this recipe.  Tastes very fresh and I was happy to make it on my own rather than running out to buy it at some restaurant.  We are trying to eat home-made all the time now, so I can control the ingredients and be healthier.  One thing, I would suggest simmering two to three hours for the peas to break down but if you like them al dente it tastes good after just an hour.

Healthy version, no bacon, replace w/2T's olive oil, used 4 cubes of low-sodium organic vegetable broth (found at Whole Foods) in the 42 oz. of water. Love the Rosemary flavor in this soup, I double the carrots.  Also like to double recipe b/c it freezes well. My husband loves this soup! Thanks for great recipe.

Made this soup on a cloudy, cool, rainy day in Southwest Florida. Yes, Florida.  I added a smoked ham hock and some jalepeno hot sauce, as well as some cooking sherry, about a quarter cup, and about a half teaspoon of ground cloves. I let the soup simmer all day, which softened the carrots, onions, and the split peas. I used a potato masher to mash some of the peas in the pot at the end of the cooking time rather than pureeing them. The aroma of this soup cooking, wafting throughout the entire house, was wonderful. And so was the soup. I served the soup with warm, buttered rolls.  Yum.  I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.

I like split pea soup but sometimes I'm disappointed by how bland it is. The idea to add rosemary is fantastic to get a really nice flavor. I diced ham and browned it with rosemary and pepper before putting in into the soup. The house smelled divine afterward. One other thing - I used more carrots (3-4) and found that they made the soup rather sweet, so I had to salt a bit more at the end and add some more rosemary to balance it out. I also added a potato towards the end since the slow cooker kept all the moisture in and it was a little watery. Overall, it was delicious. Thanks for the rosemary tip!

Recipe should state that it calls for dried split peas.  Not knowing the difference, I made this recipe with canned peas because I couldn't find split peas at our local store.

I love this recipe and have made it several times.  I never add any leeks when I make it, I use dried rosemary instead of fresh, and dice lean ham instead of using bacon, and it still tastes great.  I make it in my crock pot on high for 4 hours, adding carrots and potatoes towards the end so they don't overcook.  This is a low-fat recipe with lots of fiber, so I feel good when I eat it.

Rosemary is my new favorite so I thought I would give this a try.  Glad I did.  I had never had pea soup before and I was plesantly surprised with how good it was.  I did not have bacon...didn't know I was out so I used a bit of turkey kielbasa.  The results were fantastic.  My husband couldn't wait to take the leftovers for lunch.  Even the kids liked it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Excellent, no-hassle soup.  I didn't have leeks or carrots and thus left them out, and it was still delicious.  I only added a leaf or two of fresh sage and a sprinkle of fresh thyme.  
My split peas took about 1.5 hours to cook, and I simmered a further hour or so on very low heat to let the flavors develop.  It was even better reheated on the following day.

I have made split pea soup before, but was looking for a less thick version with more vegetables. I used a ham bone for meat, vegetable stock for chicken and the herbs you recommend. Added a taste of bacon bits too. Suggestion for those who want tender peas in and hour to hour and a half - soak your split peas over night or for about 10 hours. They swell and soften and they cook faster that way. I too have problems with the 1 1/2 hours and hard peas (or beans). Soaking came from my grandmother and she was right.

My daughter and I made this tonight.  We both LOVED it.  And she was so proud of her creation.  This was excellent!  I did use another recipes suggestion on cutting down the soak time by simmering them for 2 minutes then letting them soak an hour.  Turned out excellent!

I have to say I was very skeptical of this recipe being that the cooking time was so much shorter than I'm used to in the crock pot!. 
i was craving split pea soup, and it was much too late to use the crock pot, so I tried this one!

I loved it! The peas turned out perfectly cooked, and the flavor was just as I hoped it would be. The consistency was perfect, not too watery or thick.

I didn't have leeks or bacon, and I was leery of using garlic, since I didn't want an overly garlic flavor. It was perfect for me!
Thanks!!

I've made this twice now and both times it turned out fantastic. It's a very forgiving recipe too-one time I didn't have leeks, rosemary, bacon or carrots so I just used extra onion, oregano and turkey sausage and it still turned out fantastic. The only problem I ran into was cook time-mine took over 2 and half hours to get to the consistency we like it at, but I also live at a high altitude which could be why it took so long to cook. Even if you don't think you like split pea soup you should give this a try.

Loved it.  Took some others advise.  Did add some frozen peas which was a good add.  Also no leeks so used potatoes.  Never made before & this was a keeper.  Added a few spices here & there for a little flavor but that's just what I do to make it personal.

My husband and I absolutely did not like this soup, even though we are big fans of peas. I could not get the split peas to soften even after increasing their cooking time quite a bit. I ended up throwing out the leftovers.

Fabulous soup as is, but I needed a kick.  Added red pepper flakes with the veggies, fresh green peas just before the soup finished cooking; sprinkled chopped cilantro, serrano peppers for garnish; salt & pepper to taste.

A very simple and delicious recipe. My only change was to omit the bacon as I wanted to use up some ham in this. Thank you for a great recipe.

This is excellent! I just slow cooked everything and it  turned out perfect. For presentation and taste I also added a swirl of creme fraische and a sprig of rosemary on the top. This was delish and perfect for a cold rainy winter day!

Mmm Mmm good. I subbed turkey sausage for the bacon, used two carrots instead of one, and nixed the leek. I also used half chicken broth and half water. This is one of the best split pea soups I have made.

This soup is fabulous. I made a bunch of changes out of necessity, since I wanted to try making it with what I had on hand. I used: a full 2 cups of split peas, and upped the liquid to 2 quarts. I omitted the leeks, celery and the bay leaves, because I didn't have any, so I added a large onion and about 2 cups of sliced carrots. I also increased the rosemary (dried) to a full tablespoon.

The soup was slightly too thin for my taste, so as suggested by another reviewer, I made a butter roux and added that to the finished soup. It was FANTASTIC, no need to blend, it was perfect! My boyfriend and I both love this recipe, it's a keeper!

This was outstanding split pea soup!  It was also easy! I did not add the leek.  I used ham istead of bacon, and I used dried rosemary instead of fresh.  I did not cook the veggies before.  I just threw everything in a big pot all at once and let it all simmer for an hour or more. I loved it.

Very nice flavours. I had to use a combination of green and red lentils because I couldn't find split peas in the shop so I guess what I got is a little different, but it works just fine. I love how uncomplicated this soup is with just a few basic ingredients. Easy on the wallet, and there is no need to spend ages chopping veggies. Good stuff.

This soup is wonderful. I made it last week, and I'm making it again right now.

Before this soup, I never tasted split pea soup before, so I was unsure if I would like it.

The flavors are wonderful, though it looks sort of yucky.

I added more bacon (about 10 slices) to use up what I had, a dash of liquid smoke, an extra onion and carrot, and celery.

This came out delicious!  I was looking for a great recipe for my aunt who has cancer and I am so happy I found this.  She can only eat pureed food and this was simply amazing.  The flavors taste soooo good together, it's addicting.  I did  go with some of the reviews and used a low sodium chicken broth.  The salt level was perfect, if anything it was seasoned just enough, and a little cracked pepper at the very end made even it more excellent, bringing out all the flavors.  Thank you.

This soup was delicious!  Mine came out salty because I used Better Than Boullion  instead of regular chicken broth  cause I was out - next time I will be sure to use the canned stuff.  I also thought it could have used a bit more rosemary flavor - next time I might put in a whole Tablespoon instead of a teaspoon.  It was fantastic and we will definitely be making this again!

Simmering pea soup "about one hour" is a laugh.  It's done when it's done, and that depends on many factors.  Mine is going on two and a half hours and the peas are not yet soft.  Just the way it works.

I had leftover ham from Easter in the freezer, so I used that instead of the bacon. I followed the recipe exactly after that, and it turned out beautifully. I have tried one other split pea soup recipe and this one tops it. I would make croutons to go with this next time. Yum!

This is the first time I've made split pea soup.
Another reviewer remarked that it took a lot longer than 1hr 15 min to soften the peas. I agree, more like three hours. It could have had more rosemary. Just OK.

Personally, I thought that the rosemary did not compliment the soup much, and the whole thing could use some more flavor. But, we ate it, and that's what counts.

This soup is fantastic! I use low sodium broth and substitute ham for the bacon and it still turns out great! This soup also does really well in the crock pot, just throw everything together and set on high for 6-7 hours.

Delicious, hearty soup that makes for great comfort food.  I followed the suggestions of others, omitting the leek and using low sodium broth due to the salt level of the bacon.  Dry rosemary works fine, though I would love to try it with fresh.

I have made this recipe several times.  It is easy and delicious.  You don't have to follow the recipe exactly to get a good result.  It is very forgiving!  I usually double it so I can freeze some.  I always put on the rosemary, but it does not seem to add much flavor that I can tell.  I like the bacon.  It sure beats a ham bone!

I have done a variation of this soup...Mostly the same way. I didn't have any chicken broth so I used water & "Knorr" chicken bouillon, but the rest was all the same. I adore this soup!!! Soup of any kind really IS my comfort food. Thanks so much for the recipe. This time I tried someone else's suggestion of using liquid smoke...Interesting... Probably won't do that again. Also, my husband is the ham nut & I am the bacon nut, so...I add both. It's great!!

This was so easy! Our first time trying to cook split pea and it was awesome. I changed the recipe a bit. I used 5 cups of water because we didn't have chicken broth, and I doubled the garlic. I also added some celery. Delicious!!!

This soup was delicious; the first time around I used sausage instead of bacon as I had it on hand, but I will make with bacon tonight. It is hearty and healthy and easily adjustable for how thick or thin you want it. Thanks for a delicious recipe!

I've tried other split pea recipes on this site, but this one is the keeper.  1) I didn't have a leek on hand. I added some fresh chives instead, and it still turned out well. 2) I didn't quite like how the texture of my bacon turned out (kindof rubbery).  Be sure to cook it until it is very crispy, and slightly smaller pieces might work out better. 3)Whatever you do, don't sub the rosemary...it's wonderful!!!

Great recipe, and quick for a weeknight meal, with some good bread and a salad.  I didn't have fresh rosemary so I used dried at a ratio of one to three with dried being the smaller part of the ratio.  It is quite salty, so low sodium chicken broth might be good, although no one in my family complained.

This was my first pea soup and I am about to make it for the second time.  It turned out so delicious.  I used ham instead of bacon and added extra carrots and extra broth to make up for the difference. It was so good!  I don't normally eat leftovers and even I thought this was too good to pass up!

I made this yesterday and it is fabulous! I've never made split pea soup before, but I love rosemary so I wanted to give it a try. **2011** I still make this frequently in winter time. It is a great recipe-- tastes wonderful and is very filling.

This soup is the best split pea soup ever.   It has a subtle sweetness and the rosemary is not too strong. I have substituted small ham cubes for the bacon at times.  When I do, I put about 2 Tbsp. olive oil in the pot and add the ham along with the onion.

This soup is as good as they say!  Only changes: my peas didn't soften until about 2 hours, and I added a butter roux to make it thicker.  I also added lots of black pepper.  But this is great with the rosemary and bacon flavors, definatly a repeat soup.

This soup was wonderful!!!! I loved it, instead of bacon I used country ham and it was really good. I also had to let it simmer for 2 hours for the peas to soften up, other than that I didn't  change anything. The rosemary added an excellent flavor, my husband loved it. I plan to make another batch tonight to freeze since I have some leeks and split peas left over.

This is really good. I love the idea of rosemary in my pea soup. However, this soup was VERY salty. Not sure if I did something wrong??? I would cut back on the bacon if you are not a fan of salty dishes.

I was living in the UK when I first made this so I had to use "cooking bacon". I'm so happy I stumbled upon as I think it really adds to the soup. The big chunky pieces of bacon compliment the hearty, rustic nature of the soup nicely. 
The chicken broth I use has basically no salt in it so I didn't have a problem with the sodium content. This was great as it allowed me to use more bacon than the recipe called for. Mmmm bacon.
I agree it takes a bit longer to cook than stated, but I find if you cut the veggies really small and also mash them up a bit as they start to soften it helps quicken the overall process. 
Overall I was not disappointed with this soup. I'm really happy I found this recipe. I have gone back to it numerous times and will continue to use it in the future. Thanks for sharing!

Incredibly delicious recipe!!!! Oh my goodness, the aroma will bring you to your knees, so be prepared for torture!!! I made seemingly minor changes, but significant in terms of final outcome. They are as follows:

4 slices of THICK SLICE bacon. I'm always a fan of thick slice anyway, but when you crisp it there's still a nice piece of meaty bacon left. As far as cooking the veggies in the bacon grease, I ladled out all but a 1-2 tbsp, which was more than adequate and cuts down on fat considerably.

I only had 1 can of low sodium chix broth in the pantry, so I used that and completed the liquid requirement with simply water and 1 chicken bouillon cube. Still plently salty (remember there is bacon in here!!!) and this gives you the option to salt to taste when served.

1 clove of garlic instead of two. Just a personal preference. There are a lot of delightful flavors in this soup. Didn't want any one thing to take over!!!

Served it with a rustic, whole grain bread and olive oil for dipping. Truly Heaven on Earth!!! The rosemary is amazing in it. DON'T USED DRIED OR OMIT!!! It's sooooooo worth spending a couple dolllars on. Bon apetit!!!

This was yummy. I used my left over ham and ham bone from my Easter ham instead of bacon, used low sodium chicken broth and it was delicious. After one hour of cooking, I removed the ham bone and bay leaves and put it in the blender on puree. I then added it back to the pan, added another 1 1/2 cups of broth, 1/2 teaspoon of liquid smoke and one cup of diced ham and heated through. 

Very tasty and I'll make it again.

This was delicious!  We are adding it to our family list of repeat recipes; we will make it again!  I didn't have bacon on hand, so I used vegetable oil to fry the onions, leeks, etc. and I also added 6T. of store-bought bacon bits to this step.  Delicious!

Wow. this recipe is just as good as everyone said, if not even better! I didn't even add salt and pepper, just didn't need it. I also skipped the bay leaf since i don't cook with bay very often and I didn't want to buy it at the store. One note, the green split peas work dried. I wasn't sure if I needed to precook them or what since it doesn't specify, but I put them in dry and they turned out great. I let the soup simmer an extra hour too since i was busy around the house and the consistency was perfect. Soooo good!

So my daughter gave me a bag of split peas and I was like....ugh! Split pea soup is one of the few things I'm really not fond of. But I thought I'd give allrecipes a try and I'm glad I did. This was a great soup that the whole family liked. Thanks!

I couldn't find fresh split peas at the market, so used frozen.  I think fresh might be even better.  I made it on the stovetop as the recipe called for, however, think the crockpot would be a great alternative.  Yummy!

Made this last night! So Good! YUMMMMM! Wish it had made more. Used low sodium bacon, no leeks on hand so I skipped them. Excellent flavor. I'm ready to make this again!!

This is a great way to jazz up split pea soup. I use turkey bacon and leave out the leeks. This recipe also freezes well!

Very tasty soup!!!  Loved the texture, smoky flavor, leeks are wonderful too!  My husband doesn't like texture in anything so I pureed his.  You loose something by blending it all up.  Loved everything but the soggy bacon in the finished soup.  Next time I will cook bacon and set it aside to crumble over top.

The only thing I added was chopped celery and red pepper and I didn't use the leek.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly and my husband and I thought it was delicious.  I will definitely make this again.

Wow, this was delicious.  I didn't change much of anything, except for using a little more fresh rosemary, and adding some leftover Christmas ham.  I also didn't have a leek, so I chopped up a bunch of scallions.  Simply delicious -- thanks to Cathy H.

Did not have leek or carrot on hand (college apartment), but was still delicious!  Used a ham-bone stock instead of the broth and bacon, and added bits of ham once the soup was done.  Rosemary really adds a nice touch!

i really love this recipe! i wouldn't change anything about it, except that i will double the recipe next time! there was not enough to go around!! i do have to say that depending on the bacon used, it can be pretty salty, so adjust according to taste. thank you for sharing!

This is an AWESOME recipe.  My husband and kids LOVE it!  The only thing I do differently is to add apx. 1/2 cup half and half or heavy cream to thicken and make a little richer!  AWESOME!  Thanks Cathy!

I doubled this recipe for leftovers and made it vegan.  To help with the cost of the ingredients I used veggie  boullion instead of broth-saves you a ton of money!  Just follow the directions for the brand of boullin you bought. I also added salt and pepper to taste since it needed some seasoning.  I left out the leek, because lets face it they're a pain to clean.  I cooked for a little over an hour just so the soup became smoother, you really don't want the peas to have any bite left in them. This could also be very easily done in a crock pot on low for 8 hours.   A tip when reheating: add a touch of water to  help smooth it out.  I always think its better the second day!

Just love the flavor of rosemary in this soup! Since I am currently avoiding pork and red meat,I prepared this without the bacon. I kept everything else as written, just sauteed the veggies in a little olive oil first. I have made this several times since I discovered this recipe, a new family favorite!

Good stuff! I used a ham based bullion instead of chicken stock and dried rosemary since I didn't have fresh.  I tried this in the slow cooker, to anyone as dumb as me dried peas are not like dried beans if you put them in the croc use low not high and still only like 4-5 hrs! I ended up with a paste, even after adding a can of evap milk, but still super awesome flavor.

My Husband and I enjoyed this soup very much.It's smooth with warm earthy flavors. The only thing we added to the recipe is some crushed re pepper for extra spice which topped it all off. I was perfect with a homemade eggplant or grilled chicken panini.

This is a great recipe.  I am the "soup chef" for my cafe and this sells out almost every time.  I omit the leeks, use a chicken stock base and dried rosemary.  My family enjoys it as well.  (I have never been a split pea soup fan but this stuff ROCKS)!  ENJOY!

I left out the leek, used sandwich ham, and got MEGA compliments!  I took some advice and used half broth and half water, and still needed to add salt.  If you like peas, this is SOOOO GOOD!

I made this in a crockpot with a few changes, I just used what I had on hand.  I omitted the bacon and the leeks, used sodium free chicken bouillon in 6 cups of water and added several dashes of liquid smoke. I also used dried rosemary.  Cooked for 8 hours and it was very tasty.  Freezes beautifully.

Was very good. I liked the idea of adding Rosemary. I didn't have leeks so I used celery. I also added about half a can of drained diced tomatoes (mashed with a fork to make smaller pieces).

just made this for lazy sunday afternoon.  it was great!  the bacon is much better than the ham hock kind, which was overpowering.  and the only changes i made was i used 1 potato instead of leeks, and added 2 extra slices of bacon cuz i was using up the end of a package.  will definitely make this one again!

I used a crockpot!  I had a huge hambone that I used instead of the bacon.  I put in a box+3 cans of chx broth, 2 bags of dried split peas and a small bag of baby carrots whole.  At about 5 hours the meat fell off the hambone with a little help.  At the 6hr mark the peas had softened up and made the pea-green color soup that was delicious!  Will become a winter staple in our home for sure! Thx!

This was fantastic. I'm not a fan of the overpowering flavor of bacon, so I rendered the fat of a little salt pork instead. I usually alter a recipe quite a bit while cooking. The salt pork was the sole modification of this recipe; it needs no tweeking. I may try adding a ham bone as others have suggested, but the soup is wonderful as is. Thanks for the recipe!

I've already made this soup twice because I liked it so much!  The only change was using stock cubes instead of liquid stock.  Its such a great thick soup for these cold days!  I don't even have any way I can think to improve it.

Very good! Very easy to make! I had to mix it up a bit...I used pre-cooked bacon chopped up w/ leftover ham lunchmeat finely chopped & cooked it up in the pot w/ some olive oil along w/ 1/2 yellow onion (no leeks) & 4 cloves minced garlic & diced up canned sliced carrots before adding the broth...even a tsp of curry powder.  I then used a blender to puree the soup a bit to give it the consistency I like. I never figured pea soup to be so simple to make!

This soup was pretty good.  I followed a reviewer's advice and added 1 tbs. dried rosemary, which was a little over-powering.  Instead of bacon, I added shredded lamb at the end.

Very balanced, even though I omitted the rosemary.  I reserved the bacon for garnish but used the rendered fat for sauteeing the veggies.  Just before serving, I pureed the soup.  Was great with a splash of half and half (although my husband preferred it plain), the crisp bacon as garnish, and a slice of bread.  The flavors were just perfect, and not at all too salty.

This is the best homemade split pea soup I've had--and it's so simple. It seems rosemary was made for this, because it blends in perfectly. It doesn't stand out the way it usually does in a dish, yet it adds a wonderful, distinctive flavor. I made it without the bacon, used veg broth, and pureed all but about a cup of the soup for a thicker, smoother texture. I can't wait to make this again.

Wow! I don't even like split pea soup, but since my love does I thought he would like some on this cold winter day. I had to stop myself from eatting the hole pot, the only thing i changed was using a pkg of diced ham instead of bacon. Yummers.

Yum!  Thanks for the recipe!  I had substituted bacon for turkey bacon and it came out great!  You can also add ham base for more flavor vs chicken broth.

This was tasty! I had to make a few adjustments since I used what was on hand. I shredded the carrots (I can sneak it past my kids) instead of chopping, I didn't have any leeks so I thinly sliced 2 ribs of celery, added 2 thinly sliced ribs of celery (with leaves)...my rosemary had seen better days so I had to use thyme instead. Even with my changes it was tasty! Next time I will try to make it as is, so I can review the recipe in it's 'pure' form.

I thought this was very easy and tasted great.  I did have changes due to ingredients I had on hand.  Had no leeks so left them out and I dont care for rosemary so i omitted that   too.   My only other change was in the method:  I cooked the bacon  till  it was about half way done then added all the chopped veggies and the peas as well because I was in a hurry.  Watched them carefully, stirred so no sticking  (8 minutes approx) added the broth and cooked less than an hour. I will def make this again.  Thanks for this great recipe.
p.s. I don't think you can expect much flavor using turkey bacon.

This was great! I omitted the leek and added an extra carrot. I also added some honey glazed ham I had from leftovers. The last 15 minutes I bumped the heat to medium heat and it boiled and cooked the split peas way faster and thickened the soup really nice! Will be keeping this recipe!

Great taste.  I don't usually use bacon or leeks (or rosemary!) in this type of soup, but they were on hand (and I had no ham).  Came out very nice.  Made plenty to enjoy later, too.

I made this for my roommate.... I personally have never like split peas, but then again I don't often eat any peas, but he 'Loved It" and he must have, I made enough for 4 servings and there was NO left overs, he wants me to make it again only with some ham, I said I would after Christmas dinner, since I am sure we will have some left over ham.... My roommate said to rate this with at least 5 stars.... I would have given it at least 4.9 stars because of how easy it was to make.

Delicious. Essentially the recipe I've been using for years and I sub out green peas for yellow or a mixture of the two. Thanks for sharing your recipe!  10-2018 No bacon? Can use a little bit of liquid smoke to taste, finely shred a small amount of ham and add. Also good.

Very hearty soup! Did sub half water for broth and used slow cooker until the peas were mostly broken down. Didn’t have any leeks and added a couple of potatoes (cubed). Serve with a bit of sherry in the center. Yum!!

This is a good recipe for split pea soup.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good recipe to use.  This was very tasty and very filling.  It's not hard to make and the cooking time is pretty reasonable.

This soup was delicious! I added quite a bit of salt to taste, and used my instant pot. I used the sautée function first for the bacon and veggies and then after adding the rest I let it cook for 10 minutes under high pressure, then 5minutes under natural release. It was quick, easy, and delicious!

I made this as an alternative to my usual recipe. Boy, am I glad I did. I made it  per recipe but added one thing that I always do with split pea soup . I put about 3/4 of the peas in  and the let the soup simmer 30 min. and then add the remaining peas.  This gives a varied texture with some being very soft and some  having a firmer texture. It also gives the less done peas a real "fresh pea" taste This is a great recipe which I will be making many times to come.

Delicious. Very hearty and filling. I modified a bit by omitting the leak, and adding 2 t. dried thyme, 1 t. dried rosemary, 1/2 t. cayenne pepper and a celery stalk. Added more bacon (8-9 strips,) 4-5 cloves of garlic, an extra carrot, an extra bay leaf and 6 c. chicken stock. Used frozen peas which made the soup a bit sweet, but still tasty. Will use split peas next time.

One of my favorite soup recipes to make. I boil a chicken carcass (I save the raw ones from when I quarter chickens) for the stock. For extra flavor, I add a dash of cumin and it pairs well with the rosemary.

Takes much longer than the cook time to get the split peas soft. Following the recipe as written I thought the flavor was good and so did the boyfriend. I prefer a little more zing or flavor.  I'll definitely steal the rosemary but use it with another recipe.

I really enjoyed this recipe, one thing I did change was that instead of using chicken stock I used vegetable stock as my wife and kids are vegetarian. Also instead of using ham or bacon I used a soy bacon product. It still gives it that nice smoky flavor but it can be a vegan type soup. My friends that are not vegetarian tried the soup and really enjoyed it.

Used some chopped thick cut deli ham in place of the bacon; was tasty , but needed to add broth twice during cooking to prevent it from boiling dry.

I followed the recipe with the addition of a leftover sweet potato half.  when the peas softened, i hand blended the soup and added leftover pieces of diced ham. Rosemary is nice but also added a pinch of mild curry to bring out the flavors and a pinch of crushed red pepper.

Loved this recipe. I used turkey bacon for less fat. Just before serving, I put through a blender (avoiding the bacon pieces) for smoother consistency. Will definitely make again!

This was very good. I didn't add bacon and just started sautéing the veggies.  I used 3 small leeks a full 16 oz bag of peas and about 42 oz of chicken broth. I added a tsp of salt and pepper. This is very satisfying soup. I froze my batch to pop in the microwave for lunches.

Maybe I was expecting it to be more flavorful. But it is split pea soup, so I know I shouldn't be disappointed. I added some curry to give it a kick but it still wasn't very interesting to eat. A positive is that the soup smelled AMAZING. 

Changes - I used low sodium chicken broth, turkey bacon, and shredded carrots.

Tried this recipe as written and it took 3 hours for the peas to cook.  No idea where the "1 hour" comes from.  Knowing that, however, I'll just plan better because this is definitely a soup I will make more often.

Delicious and easy to make soup! I removed the bacon from the pan after it was done cooking as I did not want it to burn while the veggies were cooking, then added the bacon back along with the broth. I added some chopped acorn squash since I had it on hand and it was a very tasty addition. Also added about a 1/2 teaspoon salt a little pepper when it was done cooking. Will definitely make this one again.

This soup is wonderful. I'm making it right now for probably the fifth time. The aroma is intoxicating! I normally add sliced rookworst (smoked sausage)to make it more Dutch.

Good.  I added potatoes.  Since I didn't have bay leaves I subbed thyme, however I wasn't in love with the flavors -- I was thinking it was the rosemary I didn't like, but it could have been the thyme or the combination.

Extremely Tasty Soup! The only thing different was that I forgot the Rosemary and it still came out real delicious! I will make again tomorrow (after a few weeks since I've first made it) and will keep it as a normal recipe in my collection.

the flavor was wonderful; however, there is just no way that the split peas will be done within the cooking time indicated.  I put everything in a crockpot - on high - as I had seen suggestions to do this; however, after almost 5 hours, the peas still weren't done.  I transferred all to my dutch oven and boiled everything for another 45 minutes or so.  Next time I will first cook my peas for about an hour and let them sit for another hour and then add all other ingredients.  Other than that, it was a wonderful soup.  I do miss my ham though and will probably use ham instead of bacon next time.  Just save your bacon grease and saute your onions and leaks for your next pot of yumminess!

I really enjoyed this soup! I used the ham bone in place of bacon as advised by RandyRandy. Instead of chopping my rosemary, I just grabbed a couple sprigs from the garden and threw them in the pot. I didn't have leeks and it still turned out delicious. If you like your pea soup on the thick side (as I do) I would recommend simmering closer to two hours.

OMG! Sooooo delicious. I used 2 cans of roasted garlic chicken broth and then added 2 cups of water (I did't want to use my last can of broth) as well a a packet of chicken bouillon. I also added other herbs (dried): dill, cilantro and parsley as well as the rosemary. Great! Does not even need salt or any other spice. This will be in heavy rotation.

Made this last night, it was delicious. Added more bay leaves and used the fresh rosemary.  Took out the bacon after it got crisp and re-added it after the soup was done simmering.  Will make again and again and will double the recipe.  Thanks Cathy, spot on.

Great recipe! I followed the recipe and it came out perfect! I do recommend blending it all together at the end if you like the traditional creamy consistency of pea soup. Used tried Rosemary and it worked fine. I didn't need to salt the soup at all. The bacon gives the soup the perfect saltiness already.

This is wounderful soup, espicially the next day!!! Didn't have any leeks so just used more onions.  I like bacon so I used an extra slice, the only other thing is that it could use salt and pepper while cooking.

This is the perfect split pea soup!  And - it is extremely easy to make!  I added some small chunks of ham toward the end of cooking - no need to cook with the shank bone for days...the flavor in this soup is amazing as is!

This soup is really good. However the recipe only calls for 10 oz of broth, and it takes WAY more. Start with that much, then just keep adding broth until the peas start to break down and it is the consistency you want.

Best pea soup. I use turkey bacon because I don't eat pork. Leeks are great, but if you can't find or afford them, the soup is still good without them.

What a wonderful recipe.  Taste and texture were right on.  This was the first time I worked with a leek and it won't be the last.  Don't skip the leek!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and I have to admit I did not care for the smell of the soup as it was cooking. BUT I was pleasantly suprised when I tasted the finished product. I loved it! So tasty! I will def make this again.

This was great! We don't eat meat so I left out the bacon and added extra onion and carrots. I added about a tablespoon of Chipotle Tabsco to add a little kick and used my immersion blender to puree most of it. I served it with grated parm on top. Definitely the best split pea soup I have made.

Great Soup. Added some pepper to give it a "kick", used turkey bacon, added a little more chicken stock, and pureed it. Served it with homemade whole wheat bread. So filling and healthy!

This soup was delicious!  As my partner and I are following a special diet right now, we omitted the bacon and the carrots - but I can only imagine how much better the recipe would be with some bacon! Mmmmm!  I also took some ideas from similar recipes on this website and gently blended the soup (after it had finished cooking) with a mixing wand to give it a bit of a creamier texture. I then stirred in a cup of milk (goat's milk in our case) to make it extra creamy.  The rosemary was a lovely touch!  Thanks for the recipe. We will definitely make this again.

I've made twice now. Once with dried rosemary & with the bacon + ham bone.  and once with fresh rosemary, no bacon & the ham bone.  I have to say both times were VERY good!  but i really need to stress the flavor the fresh rosemary added to this soup.  ESPECIALLY the next day!  phenomenal!  Plus, omitting the bacon didn't do anything to deter from the intended flavor of the soup.  Thank you for a fantastic recipie for my favorite soup!

Delicious! I used Turkey Bacon, and eyeballed water and vegetable boullion (about 6-7 cups of water). We will make this again.  My husband is not a fan of split pea soup and he thought it was great.   The kids (age 3 & 5) ate it up.

This was a very easy recipe to make. I followed exactly and found it to be very hearty and tasty. I have not made Pea Soup before with rosemary and that was a nice touch. I will definitely make this again once the cool days set in again!

It had a decent flavor but I am uncertain if I will make it again.  This was the first time that I had ever had split pea soup so I can't really speak as to how it compares with other recipes. So I am not sure if the uncertainty results from not liking split pea soup in general or if the recipe factors heavily into the uncertainty.

I also made this veggi style, minus the bacon and chicken broth.  Instead I added extra onion and garlic.  This was the perfect dish to make home while sick with the flu.  It needed very little ingredients and was DELICIOUS.  The rosemary added a great touch!

I'm so glad I tried this recipe.  After the soup was cooked I scooped up some of the carrots and onions and blended it in the blender to hide the fact that veggies were actually in this soup - my family is picky.  Loved the flavor, will definitely make again

What a great soup! I used diced ham and olive oil in place of bacon, turned out amazing! We will absolutely be making again. Healthy to boot :-)

Did not use bacon added Chicken Sausage flavored with feta and spinach. Lou and Giordi loved.

If not thick enough added instant potato flakes. If too thin added milk.

This was great even though I did not have rosemary. I used a mushroom base from Better Than Bouillon, added two ham shanks. and blended leaving some peas for texture. Even before blending it had a creamy texture. Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe! I used bacon, but also added diced ham to this recipe. If you're trying to make your soup a little healthier I recommend trimming all the fat off the bacon. I also doubled the recipe as this soup freezes well (stir well during reheat or it will separate). Will be making this again.

Used pre-cooked bacon because that is what I had on hand and added 2 potatoes and good thing because this soup would have not been thick enough for my family's taste...Garnished each bowl with large croutons and freshly grated parmesan cheese.

I made this pretty much as written except substituted veggie bacon and veggie broth and added a dash of liquid smoke. Very thick and hearty. The rosemary really makes it.

Not half bad.  My family prefers ham, so I defrosted some remainders from a holiday ham and added some Liquid Smoke to the soup (about 1/8 teaspoon).  Very good flavor and texture.  My family really enjoyed it, but I am still convinced I can find a better one.

We used ham in place of bacon and liked this soup a lot.  It is not creamy like most split-pea soups.  The recipee has a well-ballanced mix of flavors.

Used this recipe as a base for mine.  Instead of bacon, I used the leftover ham bone from Christmas dinner.  Browned it  in the pot w/garlic and onion.  Seasoned with lots of pepper.  Used chicken stock and and added the rosemary, bay leaves and peas.  Brought to boil and let simmer for a few hours to allow meat to fall off bone.  Pureed and served. WOW!  Family loved it.  So simple and the rosemary makes such a difference.  Thanks!

I've made this soup many times and it is THE best Split Pea Soup ever - it's even been endorsed by my 13 yr old son who is notoriously picky.  I like to add extra carrots and celery, otherwise no changes are needed.  Perfect just the way it is!

Really good...I added fresh parsley and cooked it with a little white wine.  The bacon made the soup seem more upscale

I used homemade vegetable stock instead of chicken stock and I omitted the leek.  It turned out so great, though it thickens up the next day.  Rosemary and peas pair very, very well!

Loved this one!  I found it because I just thought that bacon and split pea would be a good cobination.  Wonderful flavor.  Reconstituted my own chicken stock from Better Than Boulion and added a whole Tbsp of dried rosemary.  So yummy!  Next time I will cook up a couple extra strips of back to crumble and sprinkle in each bowl while eating.  Can't wait to make it again.
