TGIF!  The only thing I do different is garnish with a lemon instead of a lime. This is my all time favorite drink especially after a long week or if I have to endure family - raise your glass if you have family or in-laws from Hell. Whatever your reason for pouring yourself a tall one of these be careful because they go down easy and can give you a loose tongue (in other words don't drink one until AFTER the family is out of your sight or you just might just tell them what you think of them).  Enjoy and thank you Mrs. Baxton! Now where'd I put my glass......

This is the correct way to make a LIIT! At my bar we halve this recipe (half ounce of each liquor and cut the mixers way down) and serve it in a catalina glass. Just a splash of coke on top of the sour mix.

An excellent recipe exactly as is.  Obviously the better the spirits the better the drink, but don't use Tanguray gin...

Excellent recipe for a favourite drink of mine, first time I ever made it myself. I wanted to make a whole pitcher's worth, so I increased everything. I couldn't find the sour mix, so I followed the top reviewer's measurements for making my own, times 3 - 3 cups water, a little less than 1 cup sugar, 5-6T each of lemon and lime juice. Then added between 1/2 to 3/4 cup of all the liquors and a whole can of Coke. Because it was in a pitcher, I just stirred, didn't shake. This gave us about 5-6 tall glasses worth of drink. I was drunk part way through just one...

This was very good. I followed the top review and cut back on the mixers. 1 part each of the alcohols and coke, to 2.5 parts sweet and sour. I watered mine down because I'm a lightweight, but my hubby drank his right up. Thanks for the recipe!

Summertime and this drink just go together. MMM An alternate version, the Long Beach, use silver tequila instead of gold and sub cranberry juice for the cola.

This is the best Long Island recipe that I've ever had!  Make your own sweet and sour with equal parts sugar, water, and lemon.  We mix up a big batch ahead of time when we are going to have guests or are going camping.

I am not the Long Island lover in the house, but my boyfriend dubbed this one of the best ever. Even I liked it. We tried a recipe on here with no sweet and sour, and now feel that including it is a MUST. I made exactly as written and don't plan on making any changes, thanks so much for sharing.

Getting a decent Long Island at a bar or restaurant is very hit and miss.  THIS is how all Teas should be made.  Hands down the best i've ever had.  I don't change a thing...but I don't necessarily use the gold tequila and it's still great. Thanks Kevin for sharing.

This is very good. I usually omit 1 ounce of sweet and sour mix because I can't tell the difference. Last night I used Sprite in place of the Coke because I didn't have any, it was still good.

Pretty good one of the best I have had. If you want to make it with a twist try adding Cherry Coke.

A classic.  For my taste, use 4 fl oz. of sweet and sour, and top off with an ounce of club soda.

Mmmm. Changed it up just a bit: making my own sweet and sour mix (store bought ones have high fructose corn syrup, artificial colors and stuff we just don't need!). Fresh squeezed 1 lemon, 1 lime and added to 1/3 C sugar dissolved in 1/3 C water. Combined all in shaker with ice. Feeling pretty good thru the taste-tests!! Personally I prefer it without the cola, but a little splash wasn't bad.

I made it and the gold tequila is way too over-powering, use silver or omit it from the recipe completely as tequila offers nothing to a LIIT.  I made my own simple syrup with equal parts fresh squeezed lemon juice, lime juice, hot water, sugar (first disolved in the hot water and cooled) and only 3 ounces vs. 5.  It should taste almost like a tea, not too tart or sweet, just smooth and dangerous!

Delicious drink, one of my favorites and i've made just about every decent recipe I can find to try out new things.  They never make them right at most local bars.

Very refreshing! Next time we will prob. use a little less sweet & sour mix-maybe 4 oz rather than 5.  Other than that it was really good!

This is a great recipe. I took the sour mix down to three parts from five and it mellowed out a bit. Delicious. Five stars.

My husband loved this drink   Best LIIT ever. I don't  like them at all.  But these were the first one I liked , I did add extra Coke to mine. Ok, so I'm a wimp, but you cannot go wrong making these in a pitcher like a previous rated suggested.

Great recipe!! Sweet and sour gives me a belly ache so I use cranberry and ginger ale in place of coke- the ratios are perfect!

I've been using this recipe for a while and it's great. One thing I do is to use only 3 oz. of sweet and sour (Mrs. T's) and 2 oz. of good lemonade (Paul Newman's), and then just a splash of coke on the top. The bottled sweet and sour mixes are very strongly flavored (and usually taste a little artificial, even the good ones like Mrs. T's), plus I like the lighter flavor of the lemonade. Yum yum...and a little dangerous.

I'm not a drinker, so of course this packed a real PUNCH IN THE FACE for me. But surprisingly, my good friend who is a heavy drinker joked that one of these teas was enough to knock him out cold. We both could barely finish our 1 glass each. I do not advise driving after drinking this. We could barely walk straight afterwards and we'd just finished eating.

I have to agree with the other reviews - this is a great Long Island Iced Tea. Very strong, but does not taste like alcohol - that's what makes it so dangerous. And the serving size is a big one! I made it using a few low-end alcohols because I generally don't drink gin or tequila, so I just had the swill that someone left at my house and the drink was still really tasty. I'm inclined to say don't bother with using top shelf liquor for this one.

This was a very tasty recipe, though I think next time I will use a touch less sour mix.  On the whole though, it's dangerously delicious!

Perfect recipe adjust sweet and sour to taste I recommend one ounce less. The sweet and sour will help control all the alcohols it's a matter of taste this recipe is perfect. Thanx.

WOW! I asked the hubby to stop and get the liquors on his way home, forgetting that he chooses the cheapest $#!+ on the shelf! Well, the good news is that cheaper seems to be better from all that I've read and the even better news is that this  ROCKS YOUR SOCKS OFF!!! Now we already had Cuervo Gold and Bacardi Rum but the gin, vodka and triple sec were the cheapest you can buy. And also, I did have some limeade on hand (from the beer margarita test) so I just squeezed one lemon to add to that and made 5 oz. WOW!!! Do yourself a favor and try this!! It's soooooo good!!!

The first time I tried it I didn't have coke, so used bitters. Loved it! The second time I made it with coke. I liked the one with bitters the best.

I am one to serve my guests a cocktail if they so desire. I bought the "well" bottles to make this drink. I have noticed that all bars generally use the "well" bottles to make theirs. The drink was perfect ,  the only thing that I changed was the amount of sweet and sour. When I made the first batch the sweet and sour was overpowering. I have found just a splash of sweet and sour does the trick. I have served this to many friends and none of them have complained. Side note if you use a cheaper tequila don't use as much as they have a stronger flavor. Highly recommend this recipe.
