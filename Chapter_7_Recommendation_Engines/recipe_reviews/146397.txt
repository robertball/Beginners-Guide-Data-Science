One thing I forgot to mention (or that got lost during the editing by this site) is that the habanero pepper slices should be fried on very high heat.  This is achieved by getting the corn oil (or any cooking oil but olive oil) to almost smoking hot heat.  Throw in the habanero slices, and immediately the kitchen will fill up with, for lack of a better word, pepper spray.  What gets fried out into the atmosphere does not become heat in the final product.  If you prepare the peppers in this manner, they will slightly char and retain their citrus notes without the searing heat normally associated with this pepper.  However, it will make your kitchen/house unpleasant to the eyes, nose, and throat for a little while.  This is not to say that the tartar sauce will not be spicy.  This is just the proper cooking technique for achieving the goal of this recipe.  Suggestions to cut in half or by 3/4 the amount of habanero most likely result from cooks who do not treat these peppers in the proper manner.  Happy cooking!

Inedible as written: I used one habanero and even then I was the only one who could eat it. Halving the mayo and adding equal amt of yogurt helped tame the heat a bit more.

This is a wonderful, wonderful recipe! You can control over the heat by how much habanero you choose to add.  I can't eat very spicy food, so only used 1/2 of one habanero.  It added such a wonderful flavor to the tartar sauce.  BTW, this goes perfectly with steelhead trout.  Thanks, "Toasted Garlic"!

Heat is definatly a matter of personal taste.  I used 1/2 a red habanero, but followed the recipe exactly otherwise.  We loved this super flavorful sauce which I served with some simple swordfish steaks.  If you eat fish because you love tarter sauce this is a must try!

I only used one habanero, removed the seeds, and used a large habanero and sauteed as the previous reviewer suggested and it was still so crazy hot I couldn't eat it.  My husband is one of those super hero types that can down even the most daunting pepper with a grin and even he said it would be far better if I'd only used half of a habanero.  That being said, though I couldn't even come close to eating this stuff, he did enjoy it and I'm sure I'll be making it again- but with only a quarter of the habanero the recipe calls for :-)
