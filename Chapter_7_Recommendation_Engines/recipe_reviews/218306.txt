I think these came out super. The only difference is that I make my own "creme fraiche."

make your own creme fraiche easily...add 2 tbsp plain full fat yogurt to 1 C  whipping cream (35%) in a mason jar.  Cover loosly with a kitchen towel and let sit in a warm place (oven with pilot light is perfect or on top of the frige) for 24-48 hours or until nice and thick.  Keeps in the frige for 2 weeks or so

Very mediocre for all the work involved & dirty dishes to clean up. None of the grocery stores around here carry creme fraiche so I sub'd sour cream for it. Used whole wheat flour instead of white (I never cook with white flour). A few comments, mascarpone cheese is very thick like the consistency of cream cheese, you want to let it soften so it is easier to work with. A hand mixer would probably be best for the topping, I didn't use one & mine came out sort of grainy. My husband commented the topping wasn't sweet enough. Be careful with the food coloring if you have light countertops. As I squeezed it out, as it got to the end, it splattered a bit getting all over the counter. Luckily I had a Mr. Clean Magic Eraser, a regular sponge did not get it off. Lastly, Written as is this recipe is too much work for amount yielded, I recommend doubling it if you're making it. We got 9 medium size pancakes out of the batter, the griddle was very full.

The topping is delicious and a great idea.  With regard to anything red velvet...you DO NOT need to add any red food coloring!!  The combination of buttermilk with baking soda or baking powder WILL produce a red-ish tint naturally.  Just mix them together and wait a few minutes.  It will be a little lighter than food color (for goodness sake!) but it will be as the cake was intended.  If you really 'need' a blood red color, try beet juice.  It just takes a few drops.

Served this as a breakfast special at our restaurant with rave reviews!  I did add more cocoa powder for deeper chocolate flavor.  The "cream" topping was a huge hit too, will make this for other pancakes in the future!

I'm sorry, I don't get the whole "red velvet" thing. Red food colouring adds no flavour - in fact it tastes absolutely disgusting. It does nothing but add unnecessary chemicals and a bitter taste to anything you make. I'd rather leave it out and just make chocolate pancakes.

I've made these twice now and they've been great. I followed the recipe to the last detail, except I subbed the creme fraiche for heavy cream, whipping it before adding it to either of the mixtures. I also added white chocolate chips to the pancake mix and that added a nice kick.

I made these yesterday for breakfast for myself, my boyfriend, and my mom. We all loved them! I substituted two tablespoons of sour cream for the creme fraiche and they came out great.

Excellent recipe--and a nice 'new' breakfast food, for a change. Hats off to gracce5249 for your constructive comments to another poster. 

Indeed, how can anyone prepare a (yet, untried) recipe by altering the ingredients and expect it to meet their 'high-tone' criteria? One usually makes changes/substitutes out of necessity--not having all the required ingredients, at least when making the recipe for the first time. 

I was married to a certified European chef for nearly 18 yrs. and he always went with the 'original' on any recipe.  Changes, if any, came after he prepared it for the first time.

Made these as a test run before the holidays arrive!  This review is for the pancakes only as I used a different recipe for a cream cheese topping.  I subbed sour cream for the creme fraiche, and cut back a little on the sugar.  DH thought they tasted like regular pancakes but I could definitely taste the cocoa and sour cream.  A fun idea for a special occasion.

I'm with Gracecc and Tom.  When you substitute one ingredient for another you are now responsible for what you wind up with.  For those that knew how to make creme fraiche, and followed the recipe to the letter, we had delicious results.  No need to bash the person the submitted the recipe!!!!

I was reluctant to try this recipe for professional reasons, it makes no sense and one ingredient deviates from the other and there is far too much sodium. After all, a pancake is a pancake is a pancake. Unless of course grated orange rind is applied to a basic batter and then it is the start of a Crepe Suzette. However I did try it and now I wonder why. With the topping, a basic batter will suffice, and does. Creme Fraiche is a basic in our kitchen, being used from complimenting dessert to whipped potatoes, however it is double cream before pasturization (not permitted in this country) and can be made by mixing equal parts double cream (whipped to a floppy stage) and natural yogurt (Greek for a richer consistency) or skimmed milk yogurt for a lighter one. One more tip, when buying mascerpone cheese, make sure it is genuine from Italy and not mascerpone cream which is a poor substitute.

These are awesome and yes a lot of work and a bit messy bu isn't that a part of the fun? I am going to try the white chocolate chips etc next time too! I agree with the other reviewers, you cannot change a recipe  in it's entirety and expect it to turn out right...as for using wheat flour, that is a huge change as it is not the same as white some things just taste better with white flour lol! Also, yes you must use the right equipment as well. Now a change like adding white choc chips to it, that made sense. I honestly don't think these were intended as any type of health food so, find a different one if thats what your after!

These are delicious. I made them for family during Christmas and they were a big hit with everyone. I agree with Tom Z, if you change/add/substitute/omit the recipe the please do not rate the original based on your failure. If you create a new recipe worthy of publication then submit the delightful new recipe.

These pancakes are ridiculously delicious.  I didn't have creme fraiche, so I used sour cream in the batter.  I mixed equal portions of mascarpone and cream cheese w powdered sugar for the frosting.  So tasty.  Thanks for the recipe! Absolutely wonderful!

Made these for a pancake brunch that we were having at the store that I work at.  They were a huge hit!  I actually just left out the creme fraise because I was making it last minute and didn't have time to make my own and couldn't find it in the store.

I love love red velvet anything, so when I saw this amazing recipe I had to try it. And it did not let me down. I have made the recipe twice, second time i added more sugar and a little bit of milk instead of "more buttermilk" when the batter was a bit too thick. I also substitured cream cheese for mascarpone in the spread because I had ran out. Still the pancakes were amazing. Will make again and again. Well worth the mess!

Made a test batch.  Added a tablespoon of sugar to enhance the chocolate flavor and found that the batch with the additional sugar was a hit.  The topping is perfect.  I can eat a bowl of the topping by itself with no guilt!

These pancakes are AWESOME!!  I can't give 5 stars because I didn't have the ingredients to make the topping and I used yogurt instead of creme fraiche in the batter... it was a great alternative.  Five stars for my rendition anyway!!  These are going to be a tradition every year for Valentine's Day at our house. Give this recipe a try!!

The pancakes were really moist and fluffy. I skipped the topping to save on some unwanted calories. It was good with just maple syrup. I also didn't add the food colouring, so they came out looking chocolatey, which is fine by me. I would definitely make it again.

These turned out great! They are not too much work as some reviews have indicated. Made from scratch pancakes are far superior to the 'just add water' pancake mixes. Usually I make the recipes I find as stated without substitutions or alterations. Recipes are tweaked to personal tastes after preparing the original recipe first if necessary. Unfortunately, we could not find mascarpone cheese in our area or crème fraiche, so we were forced to substitute cream cheese and sour cream for these respectively. These are tasty and make a beautiful presentation for breakfast! A definite keeper – thanks!

On Father's Day, I ordered R.V pancakes at I.H.O.P. and loved it! I was happy to have found this here, and made this, this a.m. I don't have creme fraiche, so I used low fat cream cheese, and it worked out well, and I used a different icing. I loved these and will be making this again soon. YUM, YUM, YUM!!

Very good recipe - the "cream cheese glaze" is fantastic. Overall, I think the pancakes and glaze were pretty sweet for a breakfast food, so I only gave this 4 stars out of 5. If super-sweet, make-your-teeth-hurt kind of fare works for you, this will definitely be a favorite. The essence of red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting was definitely captured.

Cook on very low heat otherwise they'll burn. I made my own frosting with cream cheese and powdered sugar. The pancakes were very good, my husband said they tasted like cake.

Made them into heart shapes for my wife on Vday and we loved them. Followed exactly except didn't add all the food coloring. Will make again!

These are the most amazing pancakes! The glaze is delicious, and I like them topped with chopped pecans.

These were really good. But instead of the spread used. I used a cream cheese based spread to make it more red velvet.
