I submitted this recipe and would like to mention....The creole seasoning blend I use is home made. If you use Tony's or such, it will be salty.Would also like to say when I say simmer, I mean so slow the bubbles don't actually pop the top. A nice long slow simmer will make the beans creamy. If you use pickled pork in your beans, do not use the vinegar. And yes!!!! Tomato sauce!!! My Father-in-law, who is (very) Cajun, said "Girl, these beans are good, don't change a thing. They taste like they do down in New Orleans....them some good beans."

So as a newly retired from the military guy, I am learning some new talents (as in cooking dinners and such) I literally have to google how to cut up different veggies and what minced is.... That being said, this recipe is amazing! I follow the direction minus the onion (the wife doesn't care for em) and holy cow it all turned out great! made it about 2 weeks ago now and the left overs lasted about 12 hours. I am making it again today as my family is flying in tonight so needed some nice warm good stuff to eat when we get home from the airport so came right back to this! Thank you for sharing and teaching an old dog new tricks!

These are the best red beans. I was iffy about the tomato sauce and vinegar but did it anyway and wow I will never make them any other way again.

Excellent.  I was skeptical but curious to give it a try.  Followed the recipe exactly.  I did need to let it simmer a little bit longer to get it to the consistency I wanted.  A definite repeater!

I followed this recipe exactly as written and the entire family loved it.  There were no leftovers.  This is a recipe that will be in the family meal rotation in the upcoming future.

Follow the recipe exactly adding the tomato sauce and vinegar. I added some kielbasa with the ham and andouille because we had it in the fridge. Mash some of the beans at the end for a creamy consistently. Great recipe, my husband loved it! Thank you for sharing.

Excellent recipe!  I did have to add about 4 tsp of corn starch to get it to thicken but perhaps I didn’t cook it long enough.  My family loved it!

Super delicious, will definitely make again. For my personal tastes, might up the creole seasoning by about half or just add a bit of cayenne pepper to the pot. As is though, should be a crowd pleaser. Oh, and don't for one second believe ten minutes prep time.

Excellent recipe! I toned down the Cajun seasoning because of kids but otherwise made it exactly as written. Very good!

I made three other RB&R recipes from this site and this is by far the best and most authentic.

I made it today and also was skeptical about tomato sauce and vinegar the only thing I changed was I used low sodium chicken broth so the cajun seasoning wouldn't make it too salty and I didn't use a full 2 tablespoons. It turned out GREAT!! This will be my new go to. Thanks for sharing Kelly!

Made it exactly as the recipe called for, with one add on. You must use Louisiana own, Tabasco sauce. It engulfs the flavor of the Cajun heritage and gives it that little bit of UMPH!!!! Do not over use!! To much heat can spoil the best part of this excellent recipe. Thanks for sharing;

This was wonderful! I followed recipe almost exactly, I used 2 8oz cans of tomato sauce and pressure cooked the beans. Flavors are on point.

These beans are amazing! Mine were a little salty but that was probably due to my choices of sausage and creole seasoning. This recipe is going into my file of keepers.

I was skeptical of the vinegar as others but used the recipe. I used tomato basil, red wine vinegar, and thyme because that’s what I had on hand.This was excellent and My daughter and I don’t even eat beans often. She is seven and asked for seconds. Two thumbs up!! Will make again

The only changes I made was that instead of andouille sausage and ham, I used smoked sausage.  I also made my own Cajun seasoning using the Creole Seasoning Blend by Joslyn from this site.

Very good, next time I will allow extra time for the beans to reach the creamy consistency, but it was still delicious.

I know that a review should be based on the recipes as written, but I just wanted to say that I substituted a lot of the ingredients based on what I had (even used bacon bits instead of sausage and ham), and it still was great. I cut the Cajun seasoning by half, because kids,  and halved the recipe anyway entirely. Still fed 6. Next time I will make a full batch and freeze half. Thanks!

Made this for Christmas.  OMG, it was so good.  I received so many compliments. My friend from New Orleans even like them.....  and he is picky. This is a keeper. I did let it simmer longer than 3 hours as my beans took a while to soften.

I didn't have all ingredients  so improvised.  I only had a small can of chicken broth so added water and some bouillon cubes. Didn't have celery so left it out. Didn't have tomato sauce except for some spaghetti sauce so used it. My first try at a Louisiana dish. We will see if it passes my Cajun boyfriend's approval.

Great meal to warm you in a cold winter night — I used smoked ham hocks in lieu of the ham and I added trappey’s hot pepper in vinegar for a little extra kick — yummiest :-)
