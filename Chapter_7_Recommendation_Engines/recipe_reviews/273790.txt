Delicious! I did cut back on the cilantro because the boys aren't fans and only used one lemon, which I thought was plenty. Did need some salt and pepper too, IMO. Whizzed everything up in my mini chopper and allowed the shrimp to marinate about 5 hours. The family really enjoyed the flavor and the boys didn't even ask of there was cilantro in there, lol ??. A definite keeper-Yum! Thanks for sharing!

This had good flavor but I marinated it for several hours and it overpowered the shrimp flavor.
