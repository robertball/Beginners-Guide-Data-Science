I chose to drain 1 can of beans due to reading reviews that it was runny. Even doing so, it was srill runny. None the less, after removing some liquid, it was great. Even tastier with a dollop of sour cream and cheese.

This recipe was very good, however on the mild side.  I would at a couple of tablespoons of chili powder.

This was fine but I probably should have drained the second can of beans as it was too soupy.
