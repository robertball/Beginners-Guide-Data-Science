I used a teaspoon of dried dill weed and I did not have Lawry's garlic salt with parsley so I used four pinches of each. Delicious. My husband and I split this between us for lunch and ate the whole goshdarn bowl full!

Is this a recipe?  Really?  It's too basic, too simple!  I like that. Nothing weird, nothing unusual, nothing that doesn't seem to fit. I don't use commercial vinaigrette and I didn't see the need for it anyway - you've got the fat and acid you need from the sour cream and the lemon juice.  I used all other ingredients to taste and added some VERY finely sliced onion for a bit of zip. Like your basic cucumbers and sour cream with tomato added.  Nice.

This was great!  The balsamic dressing gave it a nice zing without pucker that you can get from vinegar.  I added a dash of sugar for sweetness.

I thought this was okay. I have had better and worse cucumber and tomato salads. I thought the portions were odd like only 2.5 tsp of salad dressing. It seemed like the dressing, for being a creamy one, had too light of a coating. Also, didn't think the dressing had tons of flavor. The recipe was easy to make, though, and worked well to use up some cucumber and tomatoes I needed to.

I give this one 5 stars!  My hubby and I scarfed this one up!  We added pita bread on the side and this was our meal.  We are going to keep this one on hand for quick GREAT dinners! We are also, finding ways of using this as a base for other salads.  Like adding bulgur wheat and sweet red peppers for other variations.  Thanks for sharing this - it's a keeper.

I wish I had left out the balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Or maybe the kind I have is just too tart. The combo of lemon/balsamic wasn't a big hit with me. I ended up adding more sour cream. I did love using up garden fresh produce. I used a mix of tomatoes - I have a Heirloom Orange that is delish! I also added some red onion.

I love this recipe! You don't even need the dressing, I just add some balsamic vinegar instead. I also love adding other veggies I have on hand, such as cabbage and radishes.

From the photos, but not the recipe, I learned that "1 large cucumber, quartered" apparently means "1 large cucumber, quartered lengthwise, then thinly sliced crosswise." By the way, since the cucumber skin is to be eaten, you probably want to make a point of using a cucumber fresh from the garden or farmer's market, not a waxed cucumber from a supermarket. (Kirby cucumbers always seem to be unwaxed, though, even in supermarkets.)

This is a good recipe. Years ago I got a recipe similar to this but that recipe also called for the addition of 2 chopped boiled eggs and shredded cheddar cheese. Either way the salad is good.

I really loved this! We are eating light and not eating anything labeled low fat or anything overly processed...So I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, I made my own balsamic vinaigrette and followed everything else the same except using garlic powder instead of salt. A huge hit for us! Thanks a bunch for sharing!!!

I used dill and basil from my garden.  Except for the basil, I followed the recipe.  It was delicious.  The salad disappeared quickly and everyone loved it.

This was pretty good and a side dish for the warmer months.  I did add in some finely sliced onion.  I would of liked a little more flavor in this.  But overall it was nice and refreshing!  Thank you for the recipe!

Just love this!  It's a simple, quick and tasty salad to assemble.  I remember eating a similar version of this on hot summer evenings in my childhood -  mixing just sour cream, salt and pepper to coat the salad veggies.  This goes a step farther, and tastes really great!

I altered this recipe to the dressings I had on hand - once with red wine vinaigrette, and once with berry balsamic vinaigrette. A quick, easy, and yummy salad!
