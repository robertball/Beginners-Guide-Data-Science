It was good. I personally don't like peppers. But it has nice flavor!

A tad bland. I added a peanut sauce at the end. 1/3 cup peanut butter dissolved in 1/3 cup boiling water with some chopped garlic and chopped ginger added for extra flavor. One can further dilute the peanut butter mixture if desired. Mmmmm was the result IMHO!

it was a little light on the salt and a little more watery than i would have liked.
