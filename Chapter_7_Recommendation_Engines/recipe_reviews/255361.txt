I have made this salad nicoise a number of times in a number of different ways. I boil the little potatoes, use fresh cherry tomatoes, canned green beans, marinated artichoke hearts, and whatever I have in the refrigerator. The one constant is the dressing which I really love. I do doctor it up a little bit as well by adding some minced garlic. I make the dressing at least two hours before making the rest of the salad so the garlic is infused into the dressing.
