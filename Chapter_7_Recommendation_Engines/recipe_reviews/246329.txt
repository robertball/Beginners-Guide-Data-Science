True simple ganache made with the standard 1:1 (ounces) ratio of cream to chocolate. The quality and flavor will depend on the quality and type of chocolate used. Wonderful versatile recipe. Whip cooled ganache if you re looking for a lighter color and texture.

I must have done something wrong! I made it exactly as the recipe read, but mine never got thick, let alone thick enough for a macaron filling.  Wish I knew what I did wrong.
