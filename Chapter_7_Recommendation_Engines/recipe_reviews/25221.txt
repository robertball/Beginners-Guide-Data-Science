In all the time this recipe has been posted, I have never noticed that it says INSTANT butterscotch pudding mix.  When I checked my recipe, it says not to use instant...so either I made this error when submitting the recipe or else allrecipes made the error.  I have always used the cook and serve butterscotch pudding mix (and always JELLO brand as well).  I hope that will maybe help some of you who have had trouble with the recipe turning out.  I apologize and hope that you enjoy it.
Thanks-
Heidi

I have to apologize that I did neglect to include inverting the pan onto a foil lined cookie sheet after baking.  This makes clean up much easier and the rolls more enjoyable. (you don't have to try to scrape the topping off the bottom of the pan that way! :)  Thank you to all who tried it and I hope you all enjoyed it!

My gramma made similar rolls to these when I was young.  I used my homemade white bread dough to make these.  I made a few changes:  I increased the butter to 3/4 cup, melted it with the brown sugar, and spread it in the bottom of the 9 x 13 pan.  Also, make sure you spray the sides of the pan very well, or else the rolls will stick.  I sprinkled the pudding mix right on top of the butter/brown sugar, then sprinkled pecan pieces on top.  Then I placed the rolls on top of all that, let them rise, then baked them.  They turned out so good!  Thanks!

I used a bundt pan sprayed with nonstick cooking spray and used 22 rolls instead of 18.  It turned out really pretty.  I also included 1 tsp. ground cinnamon with the brown sugar.  It's a great breakfast treat or snack ;)

My mom always made something very complicated called "Butterscotch Rolls" that involved a whole lotta work, but they were the best thing ever. We had them once a year on christmas morning. I was always intimidated to try making them myself. Then I saw this recipe, and it was CLOSE ENOUGH for me! They have that same taste and almost the same texture I remember. 
    I have made this recipe a few times now and my family has loved them every time. They are a little rich, so I would not make them more then two or three times a year. Whatever you do, DON'T double the butter/brown sugar. I tried it once and it made them harder to cook because the center stayed doughy so long that the rest of the rolls on the outside started burning, even after covering with foil. It just became a big headache.  
    I really appreciate how easy this recipe is. I use Rhodes frozen dinner rolls. They are perfect for Christmas mornings because they fill the whole house with a wonderful aroma, and they are really easy to just pop in the oven in the morning while presents are being opened. Thanks!

This is one of my best finds on this site!!!!  I couldnt find frozen dinner rolls at the store so I tried Pillsbury Country biscuits in the refrigerator can.  They worked perfectly, but you need two cans for the recipe.  These were tasty and moist and easy to make.  They smell up the house pretty good too!  Thanks for this great recipe!

I added the pudding mix to the butter/sugar mixture, along with 2 TBS milk, then poured it over the rolls.  Invert the pan onto a serving dish immediately after taking out of the oven to help coat each roll.  The flavor was great.

Good, but if you like this recipe, you have to try the Quick and Easy Monkey Bread, the added ingredient of cinnamon makes it taste much better and the recipe has you layer the ingredients with makes it more appealing to the eye.

My picky husband ate 5 of these this morning, and cowboys gave a thumbs up! I had no rolls, so I made white bread and rolled it up like cinnamon rolls and froze it. This is a definite keeper!(I also chopped up the pecans)

My first try was not that great.  There was too much of the pudding mix that never dissolved.  The next try, I doubled the butter and brown sugar and didn't use all of the pudding mix.  Turned out much better!  And gooier!!  The kids loved it.

Using vanilla cook and serve pudding instead of butterscotch and/or a Bundt pan instead of a 9 by 13 also works very nicely.  Also, you can just sprinkle on both the dry pudding and sugar and pour the melted butter over everything.  Put a baking sheet under this while it's rising if using a Bundt pan, as it sometimes overflows a little.

I tried this recipe and carried it to a shower and
only 4 were eaten.  It was dry and not very appealing.  Maybe I used the wrong kind of rolls.  I used frozen yeast dinner rolls.

I halved the recipe and used an 8x8 pan.  I was worried the pudding was going to stay dry but it worked perfectly.  I used instant pudding and chopped the nuts.  These were truly awesome.  Instead of leaving out the recipe for the baking directions in the morning I stuck a post-it note on the Saran Wrap with the time and temp.

This was incredibly easy!  The only draw back is that it isn't the prettiest thing to look at.  I took it to a potlock and it sat there until someone took a piece out and saw what was lying under it-yummy stuff!  Maybe dusting it with powdered sugar or something to make it look more appealing.

Very easy to prepare. I did double the butter/brown sugar mixture & glad I did. My family likes them ooey-gooey. I also added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the mixture. Two things I'll try differently next time....bake a little longer because the middle rolls were just a bit doughy and spray the plastic wrap with PAM so it doesn't stick when I remove it the next morning prior to baking. Otherwise, quick & easy recipe to prepare caramel rolls.

This was soo good and easy!.. My kids loved that they could help and saw how big it was in the morning.. It was soo good.. super sweet.. but GOOD! If at all possible it was better the next day.. just covered it with plastic wrap and they stayed soft and gooey... Family didn't like the nuts so much.. and me being a pecan fan I had to agree. I also doubled the butter and brown sugar and added a dash of Vanilla to it!
When I make this next I think I will flip the roles over and coat the whole roles first and then let them rise... WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN!!

YUMMY!!! These are tasty. I doubled the brown sugar/butter part and divided it in between two 8 inch round cake pans. I also put the pudding directly on top of the brown sugar/butter mixture, then the rolls. Also tossed the bread dough into some cinnamon sugar as well. I will be making these for a long time to come. Thanks for such a fantastic recipe.

This really is one of the easiest recipes you can make...and OH MY!!! IS IT GOOD!!!  I was going to half the recipe because there is only my husband and myself, but the yeast rolls I bought were already risen, so I managed to sqeeze 5 into my round baking pan (good thing because I would have eaten them until they were gone).  I sprinkled just about a teaspoon of the pudding on each roll and then poured the sugar/butter mixture over them by the tablespoon.  I made sure that all of the pudding was covered with the butter mix so I wouldn't have any dry/clumpy pudding on them.  They have a slight taste resemblence to donuts...just a little.  You definitely should try these.  Even small kids could do it if the sugar/butter were done in the microwave.  Just remember to invert them onto a platter when they first come out of the oven to prevent sticking.  HAPPY EATS!!!

These were amazing! I did cut the rolls into quaters, then dip them in the butter & brown sugar. In the morning the aroma filled the whole house as they baked! YUMMY!! My husband has requested this every weekend!! One of the best recipes I've tried on this site. I did turn it over after it came out of the oven, and it looked as good as it tasted!

I liked this quite a bit.  Couldn't be easier.  I followed directions and made no changes.  I liked it in a 9x13 because there was a single layer versus some who made in a bundt.  I think the dough wouldn't get done as easily in a bundt.  I did invert it onto a baking sheet to eat it.  I wonder about trying different flavors of pudding mix as to me the flavor of the butterscotch is prominent.  (but not bad).  Overall and easy recipe, and tasty.  Btw- leave out on the counter overnight, not the fridge, in case you were wondering.

These are our Christmas morning staple. Chewy, gooey, and so easy made the night before! I agree with others that they're so much better when the sauce ingredients are doubled. The other thing I've discovered is that a longer baking time is needed to ensure that the middle rolls aren't still raw -- about 30-40 minutes.

I LOVE this recipe. It is so quick and easy. I specifically used Rhodes frozen dinner rolls and make the recipe (except for baking) the night before and let it rise of the counter in an angel food cake pan. It will be a family tradition from here on out.

These are awesome!  I make them all of the time and have turned several of my friends on to them.  I was a little embarrassed to pass on the recipe because of how easy they are to make.  I add a ton more pecans and I also use 3/4 cup of butter and 3/4 cup of brown sugar heated and mixed together.  A friend of mine recently made the bubble bread with Rhodes Frozen Cinnamon Rolls and said they were better than ever so next time I will try it with the cinnamon rolls as well.  I have used Vanilla Cook and Serve pudding when I did not have Butterscotch available and it makes no difference.  Yeah!  Thank you for this quick and easy recipe!  What a hit!

Funny, I sent this recipe to allrecipes over 10 years ago with the proper ingredients ie: "cook type butterscotch pudding mix" and they never published it???? I make it in a bundt pan. Only one of the easiest and best sticky bun recipes out there

Fabulous easy recipe! I made this for a staff breakfast and they raved about it. Not a morsel was left on the plate! Everyone asked for the recipe! I only made one adjustment to this recipe. I mixed the Butterscotch dry pudding mix in with the butter and brown sugar after I removed the pan from heat and poured it on the rolls!! Delicious!!

This is the recipe I had recieved from my Great Aunt but she called the Overnight Breakfast Rolls.  I always love these.  I usually add extra pecans becuase i like mine with extra nuts. The only other difference in the recipe I have is she has us use a cloth towel over the rolls vs the paper or saran wrap.  If some of you were having trouble you may want to try that instead.

I made this using dinner rolls from the site (sweet dinner rolls).  I have made this a couple of times.  This is very good and easy.

Quick, Easy, Delicious! I doubled the nuts(on purpose) and doubled the sugar/butter (on accident.)  Anyways I will make this again.  I also used cook and serve pudding.  I cooked only nine in an 8x8 dish.  Right after preparing it looks like there will be dry pudding, but after sitting on the counter all night the pudding dissolves and the rolls rise. After cooking I inverted them onto a serving platter, they slid out of the dish easily (I sprayed it with pam before preparing)Very presentable.

Followed as directed but it really didn't turn out as I thought it would -the pudding didn't mix and stayed dry on top. My family didn't eat it and I threw away the majority of it. If you try it, halve the recipe and mix the pudding with the butter to pour on top so it won't be dry.

This was so incredibly easy to make on a school night and bake while getting dressed in the morning. Kids had something warm for breakfast before heading off to school.

I used a whole cup of pecans. My son wasn't crazy about the whole pecans (he's never seen them before) so next time, I'll crush them up a bit. Also, I turned this out of the baking dish onto a large cookie sheet covered with foil. This made clean-up a snap. (It doesn't look like much if you don't turn it out of the pan.)

This would be an excellent recipe at a bake sale. Cover a piece of cardboard with foil, turn out the rolls and wrap with plastic.

I absolutely love these.  What I like is that there is the sweet topping that is offset by the regular taste of the roll part.  When I have made these, people ate them and thought they were good, but not apparently good enough for seconds or to ask for the recipe.  I don't understand that because I really think they are fantastic.  For those of you that don't think they like butterscotch...I don't think you can really taste that in here.  The flavor gives it a carmel-like taste.  I have tried using a vanilla flavor once and it was still good, but not as good as the butterscotch.  Looks great when flipped out onto a platter (I place the platter over the pan and makes it easy to flip out without a mess).

I doubled the sauce  and quartered each dinner roll to make them extra gooey and I added a sprinkle of cinnamon over the pudding mix before I poured the caramel on and it was SOOOO good!  I made a 9x13 pan for Christmas at mom's house  (9 of us total) and there were absolutely no leftovers!  Will make for every brunch special occasion!

3/27/10  Just made this recipe again and accidentally bought INSTANT pudding - big mistake!  Comes out like caramel goo and is not at all appetizing... so don't do that :)  Still an awesome recipe - if you follow it and buy Cook and Serve pudding!!!!

I'm giving it a 5 because it was SO easy and very tasty.  I divided the rolls b/w 2 9 inch round cake pans.  Because of other reviews, I also added in an extra 1/4 cup of butter and brown sugar, but I don't think it was really necessary.

This is not the first recipe I've followed from this site, but it's the first I've reviewed.  

I managed to get 24 frozen yeast rolls in a 9 x 13" glass baking dish coated with cooking spray.  I did not boil the butter and brown sugar, just heated them together to a nice consistency.  I, too, was worried about all the pudding mix on top of the rolls, so I left a little out, but I think it would have turned out fine.  I turned the rolls over onto a foil-lined baking dish after baking, and they looked great!  This was an easy, delicious recipe, and I'll definitely make it when I have company over.

These were absolutely delicious!  I made ours in a 8X8 pan because there were only 3 of us.  I used the same amount of ingredients- just less of the rolls.  They turned out fantastic.  I will definitely be making these again.

I don't think I cooked the sauce long enough since it seemed a little too thick and didn't spread very well, but these rolls still turned out delicious!!  Seems like a recipe that's hard to mess up, which I always love :)  Thanks!

Outstanding! I made these on Thanksgiving and my husband loved them. One thing I did different was I only used half the box of pudding and I put the pudding in a tea strainer and sprinkled it over the rolls.That seemed to take care of the issue where all the pudding was not being dissolved. Very rich so I'll just make these on special ocassions or when I'm just trying to show off

This came out great, my Bible Study Class loved it.  However, next time, I will use just a little less pudding mix because it did not all dissolve.
Easy Recipe though, thanks!

I didn't quite follow the recipe.  For some reason, I put it in the refrigerator to rise.  I don't know what I was thinking, but needless to say, it didn't turn out right, but even as it was, it was delicious!  I was skeptical about the butterscotch pudding, since I'm not a butterscothch fan, but I loved it.  My husband and I argued over who was going to get the last piece.

This was quite yummy.  I added cinnamon and raisins to mine.  Next time will leave out the nuts and double the brown sugar/butter mixture.  Also will layer the rolls in a smaller, deeper pan.

This  is really good and easy.  All the kids and my husband loved it.  Not one morsel was left.

I even made it with white chocolate pudding and that was yummy!

Also cooked the sugar and butter in the micro for less fuss.

I remember my mom making something similar to this, and it was delicious

These are the best rolls ever and everyone loves them! The aroma filling the house when baking these is just amazing! They are great for overnight guests, church pot lucks and family reunions. Be careful though, if you have them once everyone will want them again! Just make sure your rolls are fresh, not freezer burned and never thawed and re-frozen. Sugar free pudding mix doesn't work either. I tried it to cut some calories for some diabetic people at church but they didn't taste good at all. Just make these for your next party and you'll be loved by all!

I followed the instructions but added 1/2 cup of milk before cooking it in the oven.  I liked the sauce better.

I made this last night & baked it this morning to bring to work.  WOW this is amazing! Everyone loved it. I followed some of the suggestions from others. I cut the dough in 4's & rolled on brown sugar & cinnamon before placing them on the chopped pecans. I also diced up 1 granny smith apple & sprinkled it on top. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe & ideas. I plan to make this my Christmas breakfast!

This is one of our favorites to have at our Sunday morning breakfasts in this house.  I love the fact that it is assembled the night before to save time and clean up in the morning.  I keep the ingredients on hand and make this one often.  It is loved by all.  I do omit the pecans due to the fact that my kids don't like nuts right now.  Great recipe that I will continue to use over and over.

Excellent recipe!  I made this for the first time for Christmas brunch and they were delicious!  I made one pan with pecans and one without.  Baked them early in the morning and then put them into the oven for a few minutes to warm up and everyone loved them!  Make sure to turn them out onto a pan as soon as they come out of the oven.

I got this recipe from someone at work a few years ago and make it every Christmas Eve so we have fresh rolls on Christmas morning while we open gifts!  My family LOVES these sticky buns and it wouldn't be Christmas without them! Yummmmmmy! Note: it is very important to use the cook and serve pudding mix.  I don't know what I'm going to do if they ever stop making it!

I'll have to agree with another reviewer that the Monkey Bread is the way to go. This was ok, but the Monkey Bread is way easier and to me tastier.

Thank you for sharing this yummy recipe! I use a bundt pan (sprayed, 24 of the Rhodes Dinner rolls that I cut in half and rolled in the dry pudding mix. I melt the brown sugar and butter in the microwave to form a syrup and pur over the rolls. Let double in size and bake 30-35 minutes. YUM!

Oh my,this is sooo good. I doubled up the sauce as other reviewers had mentioned,and it was just fantastic.I actually reversed the schedule of this bread...I did it in the morning to bake right before supper. But I figured overnight is considered about 8 hrs,so I let it sit covered for about 7-8 hrs,and those babies were sky high and ready to bake by suppertime. I can't wait until breakfast tomorrow when I can have some with my coffee :)
Thanks for a great,easy recipe!!!

I made this twice the first time there was not enough sauce, the second time I double the sauce and they truned out great. I used rhodes frozen rolls, I think they must be larger than what the original sauce for the recipe calls for, thats why I needed to double the sauce.

Good but I also had areas with dried pudding mix.  I also did an oops by not listening to directions and I put in a bundt pan.  Even greasing it did not help.  I had to dig out the bread but we still enjoyed.  Thanks

Well, I think this is potentially a good recipe but it didn't turn out quite right for me.  I must preface this by saying I tried to bake it in the oven of my travel trailer, so that could have factored into the outcome.  The flavor was good and the smell while baking was AMAZING!  But like some others mentioned, some of the pudding was still dry on top.  I will give this another shot, using more butter mixture on top and baking at home where I know my oven is more accurate.

My niece and nephews loved this!! I tweeked this (per ingredients that i had) I used vanilla pudding instead, and used cinnamon and sugar as well as brown sugar, melted butter and the pudding. Only I had to cook it alot longer that 25min. I think next time i make this I will use a dish with shallow sides and single layer the frozen bread rolls instead of layering them. I didn't use "exact" measurements when I put this togeather, I just eyeballed it, but basically stuck to the measuments called for. This one is a keeper. I love "simple" I am soooo all about "simple"!

I would probably give this recipe 3.5 stars.  I loved that it was SOOO easy to make.  However, my husband and I both agreed that they were just too sweet (even though I'm a sucker for junk food).  I think that I will try significantly reducing the amount of pudding mix next time.

HOLY COW those were good. I made them late last night and boy did they look gross. I had my inlaws here and was picturing in my mind my mother in law saying that they weren't very good but nonetheless, threw them in the oven and they were freaking fabulous! Used Rhodes white dinner rolls and they were great. They really did look nasty though. I almost didn't bake them but glad I did. Will definately make again...my mil even wanted the recipe!

i leave out the pecans and cut the dinner rolls in half. I would say I about double the butter and brown sugar. This makes them very gooey and sticky. YUM!

I made this for my in-laws when they came to visit.  It went over great!!  I took the advice of the reviews and dipped my rolls in butter before pouring the mixture over and they turned out great!  Will I make this again?  You bet!! :)

Wonderful recipe Heidi!  My mom is here visiting this week and I made them this morning and everyone loved them!  My husband loves pecan pie and caramel and this was a nice combination of both flavors (browned sugar and butter added the caramel).  Wouldn't change a thing!

I get better results using 4 cartons of the refrigerated canned biscuits (10 each).   Quarter them, then brush really well with melted butter.  Combine the pudding mix with 3/4 cup of white sugar, and cinnamon (and nuts if desired).  Roll the buttered biscuits in the mix and stack in a large, well greased tube pan.  Once the stacking is completed sprinkle remainder of pudding mix then add the rest of the melted butter.  Bake at 350 - 375 for 20 minutes.  Cool on rack in pan for 10 minutes, then remove bread from pan.

This was very easy and my husband couldn't stop eating it! Be sure to butter the SIDES of the baking dish, as well! Oops! The butterscotch pudding never really dissolved, and it was difficult to distribute it evenly over the whole batch of bread, but the taste was still delicious.  Great for kids who might not eat more sophisticated breakfast breads.  This recipe makes a lot, so make it for company.  Like when your kids have a slumber party...

My kids and husband loved this.  I thought it was ok, but wasn't as impressed as they were.  I think I should have served it upside down so the nuts would stay on better.  Just scooping them out with a spatula tended to leave all the pecans stuck on the spatula instead of the roll.

This is easy and delicious. Kids will need help with cooking the sauce. This also adapts well to homemade rolls. I'm adding this to my holiday breakfast list. It will take the place of a trip to the donut store!

I didn't have pecans so used walnuts; just added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to the brown sugar mix.  Definitely use foil or parchment lined cookie sheet to put the bundt pan on! I put in the oven with nothing over it and turned on oven the next morning  when we were ready to eat! Great!!!

Good and easy to make.  The  directions leave out that you should invert the finished product on a tray so that the pecans will be on top and the sugar melts down the sides.  Do not skip this step!

I've made this recipe plenty of times exactly as written (with the INSTANT pudding not cook and serve.) For a crowd, it's an instant hit and easy to do since you prep the night before. I've also started adapting it into smaller portions, using only 4-5 rolls in a small foil pan, for single/for two servings. That has worked well, too. SO EASY TO MAKE and has turned out well every time.

We had a very busy day scheduled at work, beginning at 6 a.m. so I made these to share with our team.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using 20 rolls (five rows of four) just to satisfy my sense of order.  I put the 9 x 13 dish on a foil-lined cookie sheet to catch any overflow and threw it in the oven while I showered and dressed for work then flipped them out onto the cookie sheet  when they were done and off to work I went.  They smelled amazing, everyone raved about them, and we all got  to have one or more as we could to keep us going on a very busy morning.  I didn't have a chance to grab one until about 9 a.m. and, even cold, they were moist and sweet and gave me a pick-me-up that was sorely needed.  I'll definitely make them again.  

No, these aren't healthy and yes, they are very sweet but they're perfect for an occasional morning treat.

Thank you for sharing the recipe!

A pretty good recipe, albeit a little dry.  I tossed the cubed biscuit dough in cinnamon sugar first, then layered it in the bundt pan and topped with butterscotch, brown sugar, and butter.  This is a nice change from the usual recipe but I prefer it a little more gooey.  Maybe next time I will drizzle melted butter on the dough before topping with the pudding/sugar/butter by itself.

I used frozen dinner rolls that are already baked and then you heat them and eat them. The recipes should be idiot proof for people like me.

This was fabulous, I made them for work and they were a BIT HIT!They were so easy, I tweeked it a bit, I sliced a 1/4 cup of butter thin and placed it in the bottom of the pan prior to putting the rolls and pecans down, made them more gooey, also added a pinch of salt, need salt to balance all the sugar and then just a splash of vanilla extract.    I inverted the pan when they were down to serve. They were GREAT!

This is very similar to a recipe I have made for years. I use 24 frozen rolls that have been thawed in the refrigerator. Cut into halves and roll into balls. I layered 1 to 2 cups of pecan pieces in a greased 13X9 pan. I then mix 1 c brown sugar, 1 stick of butter, 1 tbsp. of milk and 1 tbsp. of cinnamon and either 1 large or 2 small boxes of vanilla cook and serve pudding. Heat over medium heat until blended. Pour over bread pieces and refrigerate 4 to 8 hours. Bake at 350 for 30 to 40 minutes. Be sure to invert pan onto a foil covered cookie sheet so all topping will cover the rolls. Scrape out any that is left and put it on the rolls. Excellent. People go crazy for these. They are great and easy to make.

I've been making this recipe for 20 years.  I've always used a bunt pan and pecans with the instant pudding mix.  One time I was out of butterscotch and used vanilla and it worked as well.  We call this recipe "Walton's Mountain coffee cake".  My children and grandchildren look forward to this every Christmas.  It was given to me by a dear golfing buddy from Florida.    Debbie

We used the instant pudding mix instead.  Next time we will mix the pudding with the butter and brown sugar, so that we are not taking a mouthful of dry mix.  My mother-in-law often made these for us when we were visiting.  If it had turned out as good as hers, I would have given it a five star.  Also, we used 15 rolls which nicely filled the 9x13 pan.

This is our go-to recipe for Xmas morning.  I make in a bundt or angel food cake pan and sprinkle the pudding, nuts, and brown sugar over the frozen dough (in layers) and then pour the butter over the top.  YUM! Don’t use too much dough and usually cooks another 10-15 mins to be completely baked

These are ok.  I'm rating it a 3 because the flavor is good but I thought it was too much bread.  I think it would taste better if the sweet was more distributed throughout the biscuits.  The prep is super fast and simple but I think Monkey Bread is tastier for a little more work.  If I try these again I'll try refrigerated biscuits cut  in quarters, layered with the pudding and butter-sugar mixture in a bundt pan to see if I get better results.

OMG! I don't even know what to say.  These are wonderful. I used 1 cup of pecans(probably more) and doubled the butter and br. sugar. I have also used an 8x8 and used 9 rolls and half the pudding and the same amount of butter and br. sugar the recipe calls for. Not only did my family devour these, I took some to work and everyone who ate one had to have the recipe. Thanks so much for sharing!!! Amazing!!!

This is a tradition in our house!!  I do it a little differently, though.  I grease a bundt pan to cook them in.  I think they are prettier on the plate!!  I have also never boiled the butter and brown sugar.  I just use a whisk to combine them thoroughly, and then pour it right over the rolls and pudding mix.  I don't usually use nuts...but might try!!  They are everyone's favorite rolls!!  They are always on our Christmas breakfast table!!

I love recipes like this! You prepare it ahead and then just pop it into the oven when you get up. By the time you're ready for your second cup of coffee,it's done! And, by the way, it's delicious and easy. Try it!

I doubled the butter and sugar as others suggested, and it was nice and gooey, but we found it too sweet. Maybe it was the pudding mix.... I'll try it again with a little less sugar. I think I'll also roughly chop the nuts since the halves seemed too large.

I made this without the nuts because of the pickier crowd I was serving it to.  I felt the pudding mixture was too dry and when it was baked kind of just sat on top of the rolls rather than melted into a syrup like I thought it would.  I don't think I would make again although I did like the convenience of using the dinner rolls.

Very easy to make.  Made minor adjustments for personal taste & used a lot more pecans - a little over a cup.  Turned out great.  Thanks.

Excellant!  Always comes out perfect and always a hit.  I have used this for company for brunch or taken the pan to work.  The only different is sometimes I chop the pecans. They are so yummy and gooey!

Did not turn out well for me.  The bread was dry on the top and the bottoms were sparse with the butter/brown sugar mixture.  It had a nice flavor but did not turn out like I thought it would.

This is an excellent recipe - the carmamel sauce is very easy to make and the consistency turned out perfect.  The flavor of the caramel wasn't the best I've ever had, but definately the easiest to make.  This will be my new recipe for quick & easy caramel buns - thanks Heidi!

This is so simple, but is there anything better?  I do cut the rolls in half first.  Thanks for sharing!

This was REALLY good and easy to make.  I was really worried about the dry pudding mix on top but it dissolved when the rolls rose with the dampness of the frozen rolls.  I did as others said and rolled the rolls in butter and doubled the brownsugar and butter mixture.  My 4 yr old son helped me make them and it was really easy!  Will make again!

Mine didn't turn out quite right, but I know the changes to make for next time. My husband and I enjoyed it and will make again.

These were great.  The whole family could not get enough of them.  The best part, my five year old could help me make it the night before and we just popped them in the oven for a quick breakfast before church.  This is one that will surely be used again.

These were wonderful, even though I messed up and used refrig. rolls, they didn't rise, but they were sooo good!  Can't wait to try them with the frozen dinner rolls.  YUMMY!
