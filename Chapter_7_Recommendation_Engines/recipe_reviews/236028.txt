Great way to prepare a quick and healthy snack. I found a 4lb bag of frozen kale at my local Costco for 3.99 so these will become a staple in my house.  I used panko because that's what I had and used half fresh Parmesan and half grated Parmesan.  I also chopped the kale more because there were quite a few larger stems. I found my cook time to need an additional 7 to 10 minutes.  Good right out of the oven, cold out of the fridge or reheated as a side fir dinner.

I was totally overwhelmed by my farm share veggie share.  I didn't want to do kale chips (again!) so was trying to find something different.  I don't know how accurately I can review this because I used what I had on hand.... (scapes instead of garlic powder, scallions instead of onions, swiss chard instead of spinach.  Fresh everything, nothing was frozen.)  They turned out AMAZING.  My husband (big meat eater) even compared them to meatballs and he loved them too.  I dipped in sour cream (because I'm a big "sauce" person).  If I get more kale in this week's veggie share I would certainly make again!

Used these as an appetizer for Thanksgiving, this year. LOVED them! I had a tough time finding frozen Kale, and may make these with all spinach in the future. I sauteed the onion in a couple Tbsp of butter and olive oil, then did not add any more oil. I thawed and drained the spinach and kale together, then mixed them, the onion, and egg together. I mixed the dry ingredients together [minus the sage and oregano - because I was out], and mixed the dry into the wet ingredients. I rolled them into balls, refrigerated them overnight, and baked them Thanksgiving morning. I got 18 balls out of this recipe. Thank you, so much for sharing! *edit* I made another batch of these, and was having issues with them getting stuck in my teeth. I finally figured out that it's the kale stems. My next batch will be all spinach, no kale - which I think will solve this problem. If you are dead set on using kale, I would either run the thawed, drained kale through the food processor - or use fresh, cutting out the tough stems, first...

When I ate one it was way better than I expected them to be. I decided to make this recipe because I needed to get rid of some frozen kale and spinach I bought at costco. The things I changed was I added 2 slices of precooked crumbled bacon and sauteed the onion in the bacon grease with 2 cloves of minced garlic.  I think I will now be making these once a month. I also feel they will freeze and reheat well.

Funny, just like everybody else has said these are surprisingly good! I was a little skeptical but they're fantastic! Even my 15-month-old daughter likes them! I use almost all Kale (we tend to have great success growing Kale in our garden, too much success!!) and simplify the herb mix, usually just a few like oregano and basil for a more italian taste, this recipe is easily tweaked for your tastes. Delicious!

The herbs really make this tasty! I add 1 cup of cooked Quinoa and 1/2 cup of finely chopped red bell pepper with 2 cloves of garlic (slightly cooked). My 7 year old son eats them and so does my husband. I make these every month, but also use fresh spinach and kale.

I've made this 2x  and its been great!  Added a little extra cheese and used fresh spinach and kale, which i ran through the food processor.  Added that mixture to sauteed onion and a few cloves of garlic.  Combined remainder of ingredients and popped in the oven.  Really turned out nice!

I have to give this recipe 5 stars just because it make Kale and Spinach taste pretty good.  These are different from what you normally find but they are one heck of healthy snack even with the added ingredients. 
After reading one of the reviews that said they were good cold, I had to try. Yes they are good cold too.

These were good served with Portobello Mushroom Stroganoff. Maybe could have used a bit more seasoning. I used fresh kale sauteed with garlic instead of frozen kale. Also cut the oil a lot - used about 1 T instead of 5+ T.

This is a great way to get  kale and spinach in your diet.  I made it with a 14 ounce mixed bag of fresh spinach and kale.  I briefly sauteed the onions in some of the oil and then added the fresh garlic for a minute.  I turned the heat off and added all the fresh garlic and kale as I have a ceramic top stove which stays hot for several minutes after it's turned off.  After a few minutes the kale and spinach was slightly wilted and I then added the spices, bread crumbs and eggs.   I was not able to form the mixture into balls but made a "nest" and baked them for about 25 minutes.   They were very good.

I love these ... Good hot, room temperature and cold!  Made just as listed, and then made with spinach only and less olive oil ... Both were great!

Delicious!! Will definitely make again. I didn't have frozen but used a bag of fresh spinach and kale mix. I tossed everything together but it didn't form a ball, so I tossed it in my food processor and puréed it. I added closer to 1/2 cup of shredded Parmesan cheese in the mix after it had been puréed.  After baking, I topped with a good portion of mozzarella cheese to melt on.  Served with multiple dipping sauces: blue cheese, ranch and ketchup. Will definitely be making this again, no leftovers:)

I made these using all fresh spinach.  My friends LOVED them and could not believe these were so healthy and so good.  I did use all the spices but doubled the amounts  since we like a lot of the flavors. I also used the panko bread crumbs since it was recommended in another review.  I will definitely make these again.

These were good, easy, but bland. The next time I make them I will kick up the spices by a 1/2 teaspoon.

I've made them into bars a few times and they turned out well. However, they're a bit stringy so it's hard to cut them smoothly. I think I lined the pan with baking paper, too.

This was super delicious. I didn’t have bread crumbs, so instead I blended some oats into more of a powder and used that. I really enjoyed these and will make them again. A pretty healthy and delicious snack

These were good!  I had a bunch of fresh kale which I chopped up in the food processor. I also used crumbled fresh bread instead of dried bread crumbs.   Beyond that I followed the recipe.   My husband really liked them too.  I’ll make them again!

I gave it 5 stars  even though I made 1/2 a recipe with only kale (I got a free bag of fresh kale, but didn't have spinach). I did rip the kale in to dime-sized pieces and picked out all the stems. I steamed the kale first, then added the onions with the kale off the heat. Then I added the rest of the ingredients. Quick (once I prepped the kale), easy and tasty!

It's a struggle to get daughter to eat her veggies, so I came to the site to find a new recipe to try for all the fresh greens I had.  I followed the recipe pretty closely, though I used fresh greens.  I put about 2 cups each of beet greens, purple kale and spinach, chopped very finely.  I only had about 2/3 cup of bread crumbs, and so I added those plus a 1/2 cup of corn meal.                                                                What I want to know is where is my real daughter and what has this recipe done to her?  She gobbled three of these up in no time and asked for more.  I refrigerated some overnight and first thing this morning, she asked for more of them.                                                                                         Besides being so delicious, it also helped that you wrote that kids love them because she read that and it influenced her opinion.  But honestly, I think she would have loved them anyway.  They are seriously yummy!

I thought it was a nutritious way to use kale, although others in company did not enjoy the flavor as much.  I used fresh kale and spinach.

Is there a "question" section?...
....This looks great! I am looking for a homade version of k&s bites that my LO loves! 
Can I use fresh kale and spinach instead? Or is it particularly better with frozen?

One thing I would change - next time I will sauté the onions before mixing them in. They were still firm after baking. They would be lovely caramelized.

I made these for a New Year's Eve party. I think people were thankful to have a healthy option next to all that cheese, desserts and booze.

Simply wow! The definition of quick and easy. I forgot to add the Parmesan in the mix but I coated one side of each patty with shredded Parmesan cheese while baking and it was amazing! Great recipe

Liked the flavor; was a bit surprised by the soft interior, which made them seem not fully cooked (even though the outside was clearly done).

Three stars I thought I would love it but it was just OK not as flavorful as I hoped, made it per recipe.  Next time I will add more spinach and less kale and more spices also maybe garlic.

Excellent recipe!  I tried to follow exactly, but on hand I had to use half red onion/half white, half Italian seasoned bread crumbs half crumbled up white bread that I laid out for a bid.  I probably used one less tbsp olive oil as I didn’t measure.

I used all spinach as I didn't have Kale.  At first bite we were all overwhelmed by the spinach taste and didn't much care for the recipe, but we all seemed to keep going back and getting more and by the time it was all gone we agreed we really liked it.

Since I didn’t have Kale I used  chard instead, separating the leaves from the stems. I cooked the leaves in the microwave oven with just a little water on the botom, and cut the stems as I did with the onion. Great  recipe

Very savory! These were very good! I don't think it is necessary to turn them during the baking process.

I used all kale for this because I didn't have any spinach available. I used 3 eggs rather than 2 and increased the olive oil to 7 table spoons. I cooked this at 375F for about 15 minutes, flipped everything and continued cooking for another 10 minutes. This came out quite well and I will definitely make this again.

I don't write reviews often, but this is a good recipe--esp. if you have lots of fresh kale, spinach, and/or chard to feed your family. Since I had fresh, not frozen, greens on hand to use up (with a new recipe the family isn't sick of), I made the following changes and was pleasantly impressed:
Sub'd same weight of fresh chard leaves (minced) for frozen spinach, sub'd same weight fresh kale leaves (minced) for frozen kale, used 3/4 amt panko for bread crumbs and 1/4 amt finely ground saltines (what I had on hand), increased Parmesan (the cheap dried kind to help soak up extra moisture of fresh greens) by about 25%; after mixing the ingredients according to recipe, the mix wouldn't stick together in a ball so I put about 1/2-2/3 of total in a food processor till it resembled thick pesto. Made into balls and cooked as recipe indicates, served warm with marinara sauce = DELICIOUS! Everyone ate their portion and then some. This one's a keeper.

This was a great recipe! I don't really like Kale or Spinach but enjoyed these. Everyone in my family loved it. I substituted Gluten free Breadcrumbs.

Thought these were quite good and much tastier than expected. I served them with some buttered egg noodles and they were quite the hit.

These tasted much better than expected. I used ground oats as a binder because I didn't have any breadcrumbs. I used a 1:1 substitution ratio, and they came out a bit dry so I will use less next time.
