I almost took several shortcuts on this recipe (which would work), but I decided that it's not every day I have the chance at Donut Happiness and I should go for the real deal. Totally worth it. I took a cue from Wifeyluvs and also added chopped nuts, a little whipped cream, and a black cherry. Donut Bliss. Thanks for the recipe, Beth!

This was good, the reason im giving a four star is because i did it the lazy way. I didnt make icing or the chocolate sauce. Instead, i made the donuts(dont overcook) Tossed them in powdered sugar, topped with ice cream, and used hersheys syrup. Topped with whipped cream and a cherry. Yumm. Make sure the donuts are nice and fluffy and soft or else it wont taste right. Man what a sweet indulgence!
