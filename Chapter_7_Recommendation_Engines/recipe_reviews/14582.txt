This was a great recipe.  Everyone at the meal thought it was wonderful.  Instead of marinating it in a 30 gal twist-tie kitchen bag, I used a 40 gal Ziplock bag, then didn't worry about leakage during the marinating/turning process.  I then transferred the meat and marinade to a turkey cooking bag and didn't worry about basting it.

This recipe has been updated by the staff in response to a request by the submitter. We have changed the lemon juice to 4 lemons, juiced. We have changed the mustard to Dijon.

This is with out a doubt the best of the best.
I have a son, who with a lot of friends, do a lot of smoking of meats.
I recently acquired a smoker and used this recipe on a turkey.
My son said that the turkey was the best he had ever eaten and could not stop eating it.
He took home a lot of left overs and told me later that they made the best sandwiches ever.
DO NOT miss the opportunity to use this.

I originally submitted this recipe several years ago. I now use Dijon which gives a nicer flavor. Also, I use Mrs. Dash as teh herb seasoning.

We tried this on turkey and found this marinade to basically taste like straight lemon juice with a few herbs thrown in. I don't think the flavors  blend well together. (yes, we followed the recipe to the letter) It was not a keeper in my opinion.

I have used this recipe several times now with Turkey & Chicken both. Used it last year for Thanksgiving and everyone absolutely loved it. Makes the meat so moist & has such a great flavor. I inject it into my meats (when doing this be careful not to put too much in one spot - it tends to make that area soggy) ... It also helps to strain the herbs, use the marinade juice for injecting & then spread the herbs, etc ... on the outside of the Turkey or Chicken. This recipe is a keepsake in my opinion!

I love this recipe but I had to give it 4 stars because it's my opinion that 4 lemons is way too much lemon juice for a 13 lb turkey. Without using 4 lemons, I went with my instinct and used only 2 lemons, and  1 cup of orange juice along with 3-4 tablspoons of raw honey to take away some of the bitterness that the lemons gave. Although the lemons work as a great tenderizer for the turkey, it would've overpowered all of the fresh herbs that I diced, and that would've been a waste. I also added 1/4 cup of diced fresh rosemary which set it off to perfection. I used all of the drippings to make gravy, and everyone said it was the best gravy they ever had! The turkey was very tender and had a great flavor to it.

I made 1/2 a recipe and used to marinate 4 chicken breasts that I grilled. Modified slightly as I didn't have all the fresh herbs on hand, but it was still delicious. Will definitely try again according to the recipe on a whole bird.

I used this recipe to marinate two bone-in turkey breasts which I then smoked with hickory chips on low, indirect heat in my gas grill.  The breasts marinated for almost 24 hours before grilling, breast side up (never turned or rotated them).  The aroma before and after cooking was incredible and I've never received so many compliments...  Not one scrap of turkey was left.  I'll be doing my Thanksgiving and Christmas turkeys like this from now on.  What a winner!  Thanks Elaine!

Awesome and versatile marinade!  I have also used these exact ingredients with sauteed veggies and served over baby potatoes.  My husband, who really enjoyed the potatoe/veggie mixture, said "you have out done yourself!"

My husband made this rub for our Thanksgiving turkey.  We used the cooking bag to marinade the turkey, and then the next morning, I took the turkey from the fridge to the oven.  Very easy for me!  (We did not stuff the turkey.)  The bag was full of juice -- we let the turkey sit for 20 minutes before cutting.  It made the most flavorful gravy!  :)

I followed the recipe completely.   I marinated chicken and it turned out very tender.  The texture was wonderful, however, it had too much lemon in it for my taste.  I couldn't get my chicken loving family to eat it and we love lemon.  It was just too much lemon.

I doubled the recipe and marinated two whole chickens overnight.  I even forgot to turn the bag, and they turned out delicious after roasting.  My husband just raved about it.  I will definitely be using this again, maybe for Thanksgiving.

I used this as the marinade for my 14 lb thanksgiving turkey, and it turned out great. Rather than boil/ladel the marinade as instructed, I just put it all in the roasting pan with the turkey, then used a bulb baster to suck up the marinade and pour it over the bird. The turkey turned out tasty and juicy. Afterwards, I used the drippings to make gravy, which is where this recipe really shined.

The best fast and flavorful marinade for Turkey ever! I like to use crushed garlic instead of minced. I usually don't have fresh herbs around, but this dish marinade works with dried herbs just as well. In addition to turkey and chicken, it is also wonderful with duck.

I used this recipe for making my first family Thanksgiving turkey & it was wonderful!  I used the dried McCormick herbs (caution: you have to use a smaller amt of dried herbs than with fresh herbs).  I made this in an electric roaster & was so proud of the results!  The turkey was delicious, moist and juicy!!  Thanks for helping me shine!!  ;)

Great!  Easy and had a great flavor.  I scaled the recipe to one serving and used it on two turkey tenderloins, which we grilled.  (After marinating for 24 hours).  Unfortunately, I had to use dried herbs for almost everything, but I had fresh basil so I threw a bunch of that in.  I also threw in some lime juice.  This is one I would make again!

Absolutely wonderful!  I used this on my 15lb turkey for Thanksgiving 2011 and it was a huge hit. White meat so moist and tasty I can't wait to use it again for the Christmas bird.  I even added a small amount to the dressing (before putting on the bird, not after as the bird was raw).  This gave the Stove Top dressing an added homey flavor which everyone loved.  Thanks emmaxwell!

Great moist chicken and I have all those herbs in my garden! That doesn't happen often. Although I used honey mustard ( I made it with dijon and yellow) to cut the salt from the soy and acid from the lemons. It was delicious!!!!! I also slow roasted it on the grill.......nice and brown with crispy skin YUM.

Delicious! My first recipe using fresh herbs from my oak barrel herb garden - what a difference from dried. Only had 4 hours to marinade turkey thighs and can't wait to do a 24 hour soak. After cooking I used half the drippings for stove top cornbread stuffing (with sauted onions and celery) and the rest for gravy. My husband and I both loved it and this will become a regular dish for us. Also, I was pleased to find a recipe that wasn't loaded with salt. Thanks!

This recipe is absolutely great! I had the good luck of finding it two years ago when it was my responsibility to bring the "bird" to a friends Thanksgiving. It has since become a DEMANDED feature at holidays. The only difference is that I leave it in the bag to cook, and I place the remnants of the lemons in the cavity.  I had to use dry herbs one year, and it was NOT THE SAME! You really MUST use fresh. Just great.

This was such an awesome marinade!  I was running out of ideaa to make chicken!  This was very flavorful and my hubby who is not a bug chicken lover LOVED it!  It is one of the best chicken marinades I have ever had.  THanks.

This was sooooo good. I let the chicken marinade
for 24 hours and it was wonderful.  My dinner party loved it as well with many raves.

This marinade was great and tasty. The only problem was the color.

I made this for my Thanksgiving turkey using all dried herbs. It was awesome! It had a very Italian flavor and was totally the most moist whole turkey I've ever eaten! I poured the marinade out and just cooked the bird in an oven bag without basting. This was so much easier and it came out beautifully. The drippings made a delicious gravy too!

I thought this was horrible. To my husband and I the chicken tasted like it was marinated in lemon juice with some herbs mixed in it. It had FAR too many flavors going on. I will definitely not be making this again

OMG! I used my "foodsaver" to marinate the chicken thighs.  Got home after a 16 hr shift, threw the frozen pre-marinated thighs into some warm water to thaw while I fired up the gas grill and in a just a few minutes I had my tastebuds dancing! I will try it on porkchops next!  Thanks for sharing a fantastic recipe!

I used this for the first time this Thanksgiving and it was fabulous!  I did use the marinade to baste the turkey after I had boiled it.  I added about 3/4 c. of water to the bottom of the roasting pan to prevent burning. When the turkey was done, I strained the juices and made gravy with barley flour and 1/2 chicken broth and 1/2 vegetable broth.  The gravy was sooo delicious I didn't have to correct the seasining at all.  Thanks!  What a keeper.

I marinated my Thanksgiving turkey in this and it was a hit! It was very different from our "Southern Turkeys" that we usually make... almost an Italian flavor. Very good. :)

I had to substitute dried herbs instead of the fresh, so my marinade was a little different from the recipe as posted.  Still, it had kind of an odd flavor.  The flavors didn't really seem to harmonize.  It was Ok but not especially good.

I did 1/2 of a large whole turkey in the marinade this year for Christmas. My first year on a low sodium diet so no brine was possible. I was a bit concerned, but it turned out wonderful baked in a cooking bag, and then without to brown the last 45 minutes. It was also a delicious addition to the drippings used to make gravy. I highly recommend it, especially if you are on a low sodium diet.

This recipe is wonderful! It is full of flavor and the turkey is so moist and delicious. This is the second year I have used this recipe for thanksgiving. I do marinate it for 24 hours and save the marinade and boiled it and use it to baste as the recipe says. I don’t think I changed anything. I read some people feel it is too much lemon but I think they are using a much smaller turkey or a chicken. My turkey both years was a little over 21lbs. The family raves about this turkey. And it leaves the house aromatic throughout the evening and the next day.

I didn't have any fresh herbs, so I used dried. I also cut back a little on lemon juice. I also didn't get to marinate overnight. It was still good but next time I will be sure to allow it to marinate longer. I used this for a turkey breast, will try on chicken next time

Absolutely delicious! We have fresh rosemary & always add a little.  Idea: free up your oven by purchasing a $40 Roaster Oven to cook your Turkey.
