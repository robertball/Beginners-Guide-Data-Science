The family loved it. I remixed it a bit though. I seasoned the cubed chicken with salt pepper onion power and garlic powder. I also added turmeric and cayenne to the sauce mixture. I also added a layer of cheese on the top before baking and broiled the top for a few minutes to get it a little burnt on the top.
