This recipe interested me for its sheer simplicity and for its cooking method. My curiosity was enough that I was determined to make it as written-which meant resisting the urge, first of all, to add fresh garlic. I was not disappointed. While adding garlic here would seem obvious, I wanted something beyond the same ol' same ol'.  This is simply wonderful--just as written. And as for the cooking method--it worked out perfectly and the beans were bright green, fresh and with a just right taste of sesame from the oil and seeds.  I think adding garlic as so many others have done, would have totally negated the whole point of this dish, and would have masked that delicate sesame flavor.  Add it if you like, but then these beans are still the same old green beans with garlic.

This was a great easy way to make vary green beens.  As suggested by others, I added minced garlic to the oil and then a little soy sauce with the beens and it turned out great.

Wonderful and so easy!  I made this dish for a family get-together and doubled everything.  I used 2 lbs of frozen cut green beans (rather than fresh ones) and the cook time was still about the same.  Everyone loved these green beans.  Thanks for a great recipe! :-)

Yum. I've made these a few times now.  They're just so easy to make, and I love how I don't have to use any butter.  I use EVOO for browning the sesame seeds, and I also throw in a little bit of garlic before I add the green beans (I use frozen, btw.. it's so much easier!).  And something to try if popping sesame seeds is too much of a hassle:  toast them in a 350 deg oven for about 10-15 minutes instead of frying them.  Less mess, problem solved.

I used a splatter screen when I toasted the sesame seeds but not many popped on me. I did add sesame oil in w/ the olive oil to add flavor...was fearful of the sesame oil burning if I had only used it. The 1/4 cup of broth evaporated away as soon as it hit the hot pan so I added more chicken broth (probably close to another half cup). I cooked the beans exactly 10 minutes & they were perfect! Still a bit crisp but yet tender. These were a great companion dish to Mahogany Wings (from this site).

OUTSTANDING!  Easy and delicious.  I gave this 5 stars and like someone else said - if there was a higher rating, I would use it!  Even if you only "tolerate" green beans, you need to try this recipe.  You will be happily surprised.  I will cook this again and again!  Marty

I tried it with the broccoli.  If you are doing broccoli though, it doesn't need 10 minutes. Six minutes will be fine; 10 minutes makes them soggy.

Great recipe - even for those who 'don't like' green beans.  I've made this recipe for years and always received compliments.  I add 2 tsp. finely minced garlic when cooking the sesame to give it a kick and more flavor.

So simple and so yummy.  This is a keeper.  I had a mix of yellow and green beans from the farmer's market on hand, and they turned out beautifully.

WOW! I added two cloves of minced garlic and enjoyed the best green beans I have ever had.  My picky daughter even ate them; a miracle indeed.

Way, way way too much oil - and I have no qualms about adding oil to my food. The overwhelming amount of oil nearly wrecks the dish, and using extra virgin olive oil (which shouldn't be heated anyway) with sesame seeds makes no sense. The oil also makes the sesame seeds splatter messily out of the pan when you add the beans. I enjoyed the sesame flavor - though it was almost unnoticeable and would make it again with the following modifications to make it less greasy and add more sesame flavor: Simply toasting the sesame seeds briefly in a dry pan or with less than a teaspoon of canola. Then I'd remove the sesame seeds from the hot pan, put the green beans in, and return the seeds to the pan. Follow the rest of the directions as written, and at the end of cooking time add a teaspoon or so of sesame oil to bring out the sesame flavor.

Something different! Hubby really liked. While making these I realized I was out of chicken broth so I did the unthinkable... I strained a can of condensed chicken noodle soup, ugh! I am ashamed to admit that! Oh well, it worked!

I gave this five stars because it is such an AWESOME change to the regular 'green bean casserole' everyone makes for Thanksgiving/Christmas!!! VERY easy, VERY satisfying and the best part? VERY GOOD!!!!!!! The only variation I did was to add a couple teaspoons full of Teriyaki sauce. They were DEVOURED!!! Thanks for sharing!!! I'll try broccoli next!!!

My fiance is NOT a vegetable person.  He really only likes string beans and sugar snap peas.  I was looking for something new, interesting and quick as a side dish (trying to stay away from bad carbs).  This is an EXCELLENT dish!!  I made it for just two, omitted the salt (didn't even need it) and my fiance LOVED it.  He asked for it again the next night!  This is a keeper!

Great way to eat these beans. We usually just do 2T butter melted with sesame seeds and let them toast. Then add the beans.

DELICIOUS!!! Despite being simple and easy it was great.  Made exactly as written but I tripled the recipe to serve with a Christmas buffet.  Very well received-even by my picky teen and I had to eamil the link to my sister-in-law.  Warning, though, to be careful.  I wanted the sesame seeds well toasted and reached the exploding sesame seed stage.  I just threw in the green beans and no more exploding.  Also, I like crispier beans so I'd decrease the covered cooking time to about 5 minutes.  I am making a smaller batch today to go with prime rib!  Thanks for the recipe.

Absolutely delicious!  I discovered this recipe a few weeks ago & have made these beans 5 or 6 times already.  I agree with other reviews, try them as the recipe states without adding garlic for the first time...you will love them!  We are big garlic eaters at our house, but this recipe has such a delicate, nutty taste that it truly doesn't need anything else.  I did omit the salt, since there seems to be more than enough in the broth.

I just LOVE sesame seeds, and this is a pretty good way to use them.  I added a few extra chopped portabella mushrooms (which the kids picked out) and some real bacon bits & that brought it to life, thanks Rhonda!

I've made this recipe twice now and it has been a crowd pleaser both times! The chicken broth adds a great flavor to the beans.  Be careful if your oil is too hot the sesame seeds will jump all over the place when you add the beans.  I can't wait to have this again, and to try it with broccoli in place of beans!

Easy, fast and good.  I turned this into a man dish by adding chicken breast and 1/2 can of chick peas.  Pretty much followed recipe to a T.  Loved it and will make it again.

These were delicious.  I look forward to trying them with different kinds of sesame seeds.  The only regret I have is that I didn't read the comment from a chef who used a splash screen before I made mine.

This was good, for a side dish.  I admit, I felt it tasted a little bland, as written, and I ended up adding garlic powder and onion powder.  I felt the additions gave it more flavor.  I will use this one again, and rate it 5 for a fine base recipe.

I really liked the flavor that the chicken broth added to the green beans.  I would have never thought to make my green beans this way.  Will be making again.  Thanks for sharing:)

I used 1/2 tbsp of olive oil and 1/2 tbsp of sesame oil.  It had a great flavor.  Will make again.

Excellent new way to use fresh green beans!  I made them just as recipe stated, and the only things I might change are using less olive oil and adding a drop or two of sesame oil to enhance the delicate sesame flavor.  As another member suggested, a splatter screen would be useful as the sesame seeds really danced when I added the green beans! Simple enough for a fast meat, yet elegant enough for company, makes this a perfect side dish.

I loved this recipe, great way to jazz up green beans, and frozen work well too...but fresh is best.  I also add in a couple of dashes of low sodium soy sauce for extra flavor.

Really good dish!  I made it as written.  I like that the beans were cooked in oil first then simmered in the chicken broth.  It was a nice change of pace from steamed green beans.  The beans were bright and cooked just right with a great flavor.  Thanks for sharing!

These were sooo good.  I sauteed some mushrooms in garlic powder and a tablespoon of margarine and added them to the green beans also.  My whole family loved them.

These were good, a nice change from my usual go-to for green beans, but not so amazing it will be my new go-to. I didn't have sesame seeds, so I added some sesame oil to the olive oil. I needed a little more chicken broth, but other than that, no changes. Enjoyed it and will make again.

These are easy and very good. Sometimes I use sesame seed oil if I have it, but I love it with the olive oil as well.  And sometimes I saute a little garlic an add to the broth. Super easy and a family favorite.

I like to use a little sesame oil in combination with olive oil (since sesame oil has such a low smoke point but adds nice flavor) and serve this with Asian inspired meals.

Delicious way to serve green beans.  I like mine whole, so I did not cut them as the recipe stated, but then started to worry I'd have trouble getting them cooked well, but the recipe still worked perfectly.  Will never boil beans again for you lose so many nutrients that you retain cooking them this way.  I added Maggi seasoning which is a seasoning kind of similar to soy sauce.

I made this as a side for Christmas lunch and it was perfect.  It is really simple, but the beans turned out perfectly.  I have a bad habit of slightly overcooking greens by losing track of time at the end of preparing everything all together.  However I did these beans in a large electric skillet and they were ready 10 mins before everything else, but I put in the 'keep warm' mode and they were perfect for serving. I will definitely make these again.

My toddler daughter ate all of her green beans and mine. So tasty and tender. Upon advice of other reviwers I used 1/2 water and 1/2 chicken stock. This will be a new go to recipe for green beans for my house.

This was so good!  I loved the toasted sesame seeds!  Used over a pound of fresh green beans and low-sodium chicken broth.  Omitted the salt.  I made this as a last minute thing to go with some grilled halibut and Hawaiian bread I had been planning to make for a while, and they (the green beans) turned out to be the best part of the meal!

This was pretty tasty, the only thing was I really couldn't taste the sesame seeds.  Fortuately I had them on hand, so I hadn't made a special trip for them.  I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic to give them more flavor.

Luckly I have a Veggi loving family.  We all enjoyed this.  My three year old could not get enough, he even ate all the left overs the next day for lunch and dinner.  But he loves his green beans anyway I make them. I will make these again.

This is AWESOME!  I didn't have fresh green beans on hand, so I used frozen green beans, and also added a small bag of a green bean, wax bean, and carrot medley.  Unbelievable.  The aroma, the taste!  WOW!

All ten people at Thanksgiving 2002 dinner loved these, so I'm taking them to Christmas dinner too.  They are so simple, but have great taste.  I did them exactly as instructed, but maybe a touch of sesame oil would give a little different flavor for those who prefer that.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

I didn't much care for these but my boyfriend and daughter LOVED them. In fact, my daughter ate almost half of them...she couldn't get enough! I will make them again because my family enjoyed them so much and I MIGHT add a dash of soy sauce or perhaps minced garlic in with the broth/saute to see if I grow to like them too.  A thanks goes to Rhonda for posting this...my daughter thinks your great!

This recipe makes me want to cook green beans. Thanks for submitting! I will be using this recipe instead of the one I usually use that is simple but just so so. Also I have to credit James Beard with teaching me how to make chicken broth which is why I was all too willing to try this recipe. The earth is full of God's goodness!

This could be a good recipe, but I rally feel that olive oil is the wrong oil to use here, too strong a flavor. Next time I would use a more neutral tasting oil. I ended up putting in a splash of rice vinegar to counteract the taste of the olive oil.

Very tasty indeed!  To enhance the sesame flavor, I used sesame seed oil instead of the suggested olive oil.  Definitely will be used again!

Fast, easy and delicious! Can't go wrong with this one. I used vegetable broth because I was serving to vegetarians and I thought it was delicious this way also. No need to add saturated fat to this if you don't want it!

These were good, but I added a bunch of chopped garlic.  I think that is what made these really good.  Nothing super special, but a great way to do green beans.

I absolutely loved these!  What a great recipe for the average green bean.  I added a little more sesame seeds than called for and next time I think I will add some minced garlic.  Thank you!

Fantastic!!  I've already made it twice and I have no doubt I will make it again and again.  Both times I've made it, everyone loved it!  So tasty yet simple.  I followed the recipe exactly as written - no need to make any changes.  The flavors work very well together.  I was surprised when people would comment on how the green beans were 'perfectly' cooked, bright green and crisp.  This is a winner dish!

This as is is bland. I added a touch of dark soy sauce, and in the future I'd use toasted sesame oil over olive oil.

As is, the recipe is very bland, but the cooking method itself is great. There was relatively little sesame flavor, and I needed to add loads more salt than the recipe calls for to taste it at all. I ended up adding crushed chili pepper, a dash of apple cider vinegar, a dash of fish sauce, and a drizzle of honey.

If a sesame flavor is desired, I'd probably drizzle some sesame oil on at the end to boost the sesame flavor. I'd also use butter instead of oil for more flavor. Will try these next time.

I made this for our Thanksgiving meal instead of green bean casserole and it was wonderful.  I read all the reviews stating the popping seeds, so I bought the already toasted seeds.  It was delicious and SO easy!

Used Butter instead of olive oil... About 3-4oz  Brought my heat up so that the butter was just starting to bubble... Added 1 1/2 tbsp of "raw" white sesame seeds. Stir often... Don't let the butter brown. (A lot of the exploding seeds comments are because you're heating the seeds up too high and too fast) The seeds will gradually toast and turn a nice light brown colour. I added 1 1/2 lbs of fresh, clipped green beans in 2" pieces.
Toss the beans often... You need to cook the beans a bit without letting seeds settle and burn. (It happens quick!) After about 2 mins (the beans turned bright green, but were still crisp) Pour in 1 1/2 cups of unsalted chicken stock. The pan should be hot enough to sizzle and almost immediately boil, but not too hot that you have a nuclear explosion! (a lot of comments that the stock immediately disappeared= The pan was way too hot!) Cook the beans in stock about 3-4 minutes till al dente. Remove the beans to a dish. Reduce the liquid down by 2/3.. Re-add the beans, toss and serve! Beautiful taste, texture & aroma. S&P to taste

I was looking for a new way to prepare green beans and tried this last night- it was outstanding! The only change I made was to sub sesame seed oil for the olive oil- it really gave a nice deep flavor.

My food snob/picky husband said these were "perfect".  "Perfect" was the word he used.  The only thing I did differently was add a tablespoon of butter when they were all done cooking.  Delicious!

I agree with the review that said to resist the temptation to jazz this up.  This is a perfect, delicate and flavorful way to make ordinary green beens seem special.

After having sesame green beans in a sushi restaurant, I wanted to try and make this at home because my husband is a big fan of fresh green beans.
I was not disappointed. I added a splash of sesame oil and just a small bit of garlic. I didn't want the garlic to overpower the sesame taste. 
This could easily be served during the week or for a holiday meal.

These were very good and very easy to make in my wok.  I used my "homemade chicken broth" from this site and paired this with the "pork chops in spicy orange sesame glaze" also from this site.  Great and easy dinner.

This recipe is to die for.  I've made it 3 times since I discovered this recipe a week ago.  I even whip them up over my hour lunch break.  The only change I made was to use chopped almonds because I had no sesame seeds on hand.  The almonds were delicious.  I enjoy the flavor of olive oil so the entire recipe is just really good.

I liked the simplicity of the recipe.  Nothing complicated, just simple and tasty, but not ordinary.  Unfortunately I had to use frozen, whole beans,  but I cannot wait to try with fresh.  I'm sure it will be even better.

Very good!  I was following the directions exactly, until... I realized the left over BBQ pork loin I was planning on heating up and serving alongside the beans had been used in someone's sandwich.  I only had about a 2 oz piece left.  So I cut it in half sliced it thin, then added those small pieces to the beans just before adding the broth.  Delicious. We loved it!

This went over very well at a recent family gathering. Didn't have chicken broth so just used water and it still turned out great.

It was okay, but WAY too salty.  I don't know if my chicken broth had high sodium, but it would have been better without any added salt.

Great flavor. Definitely beats the restaurants! I used beef broth instead of chicken because it was all I had, it was really good that way. Sprinkled with extra seeds before serving.

I've been looking for good veggie recipes that weren't too complicated or fattening. This was exactly what I was looking for. Lots of flavor but not a ton of butter/fat. I agree with others, I was tempted to add garlic or other seasonings, but didn't. Glad I decided not to, it was delicious as is.

Tasty and easy.  I used sesame oil (probably a little too much) and veggie stock instead of olive oil and chicken stock, and it was tasty yummy.  I took the advice of some other reviewers and did not add any garlic.  I'm sure garlic would have been good in this recipe, but it would have turned out very differently.

simple yet delicious.  don't use sesame oil like some have suggested; it has a very high smoke point so it's not ideal for cooking. it's flavorful without it. in addition, i grinded my sesame seeds to release the flavors and they did NOT jump around when i added the beans.  i tried it a second time without grinding the seeds and it went nuts on me once i added the green beans. it  tastes great cold, too. however, it should be served immediately or in a shallow dish because when i put it in a glass bowl, the bottom beans tended to overcook a little from the residual heat and were a bit on the soggy side.

These were pretty good green beans. Nothing too exciting, but they compliment any classic meal quite well.
Make sure to toss the beans regularly for an even cook or some will be more stiff than others.

FABULOUS!! So easy and quick to make (ie, no special ingredients needed...had everything in the house already) and were the best green beans I have had (or made) in a while. I followed the recipe exactly and will do so again.  I look forward to making these again real soon, yummy! 
Side Note:  I picked this recipe out at the last minute (ie, with

I made this with broccoli and hy husband who doesn't love broccoli, loved it!!! So delicious. I made a few other tweaks, I added some garlic when I added the sesame seeds, then I added a splash of soy sauce and some red pepper flakes once the broccoli was simmering. I will absolutely make this again.

Very tasty.  I sauteed 2 cloves of fresh garlic and a package of sliced portobella mushrooms, then added a little sesame oil and sauteed the sesame seeds, then added the green beans, and finally, the chicken broth.   Delicious!

Awesome, awesome, awesome!  I pretty much stuck to the recipe on this one, only I did saute a little garlic before adding the beans.  Towards the end I threw in some crushed red pepper flakes as well - just because I like a little heat now and then.  Went perfect with the Tankatsu Pork Chops found on this site.  Thanks much for the recipe!

This was very easy and a nice change from plain steamed beans. The seeds do pop out of the pan but I keep a lid handy and try to block them..works pretty well! Even my kids (6 and 7) like these.

Very good and very simple.  Be sure to use a good quality chicken broth (preferably some you have left over from a previous menu).  The author suggests trying this with broccoli.  I will do that next time!

This is a nice flavorful alternative to 'just green beans'.  I used canned beans and they were (as expected) not REALLY great, but good.  I'll use fresh sometime and I think they'll be great.

This was good; my husband loved it.  I didn't have any chicken broth on hand so I used the juice from the green beans and added a little butter.  It was a nice change from plain green beans.

Good recipe. I could have used about 1/2 the amount of sesame seeds, though.

My husband is not a fan of green beans but really liked these!
Made them with fresh garden beans, looking forward to more this season. Yummy!

This worked really well as a simple side dish for Thanksgiving. 
I used toasted sesame seeds, so I added them after the beans.

I followed the recipe as written and I wouldn't change anything. The beans were very tender without being mushy, had a very nice, subtle flavor. Quick and easy and great for my low-calorie diet. I used these as a side for the maple and garlic- marinated pork tenderloin recipe from this site, which is also a big winner!

I thought these were great but my son thought they only rated a "3."  But he likes canned green beans straight of the can, so what does he know?  I actually ran out of sesame seeds yesterday and made these without.  Still excellent!

Good recipe.  I had to use canned green beans, since I just made this last minute and that was all I had on hand.  I added a bit of soy sauce at the end.  It was good, and my husband raved about it.  I can't wait to make it again with fresh green beans.

This recipe worked well for me. The sesames definitely pop, so expect that. I also added some thinly-sliced red bellpeppers and chopped tomatoes and used vegetable broth, rather than chicken broth. Very satisfying

This is simple, fast, and flavourful!  I make it often bcause I'm a not veggie-lover but still need to get my healthy dose of greens.  My partner loves this as well.  This is definitely gold!  Thanks for this addition!

This is absolutely amazing!!  My kids and husband who I have to force feed fruits and vegtables can't get enough of these.  I've made them with fresh beans from the garden...FABULOUS.  Canned beans...NOT so good.  And frozen beans....FABULOUS!  The only difference is I use about 1/2 cup water with one chicken boullion cube for the chicken broth.  A hit from my granddaughter who is one year old to my husband at 46 years old.  Thank you!!

Yum! I made these exactly as written except I had to use frozen green beans because my grocer was out of fresh. I did not add garlic as others suggested because I wanted to taste the toasted sesame flavor these beans have. Easy side dish that will go with almost any meal.

"What's the big deal?" I said to myself. Little did I know that chicken stock and seasame seeds could penetrate a green bean and make it lip smackin' good! Of course, using fresh, french green beans from my garden made it all the better. In my favorites file for sure!

I have made this recipe so many times and LOVE it! I've even made it for company and they've always enjoyed it. Sometimes when I add the broth it evaporates immediately and the beans start to burn so I have to add more broth. I made it once with vegetable broth instead and it was still pretty good although I prefer chicken broth.

These were very tasty - no leftovers!  I had some green beans from the Farmer's Market and this was the perfect recipe for them.  The only thing I added was a splash of soy sauce to the chicken stock.  I served them with bourbon chicken and rice.  Very, very good!

Really simple and great! I'm a veggie so I subbed veg stock. I also added a touch of soy sauce and some fresh grated ginger - yum! I left a little liquid at the end and tossed some noodles in it, which made a really great sauce. Next time I think I'll try adding tofu, garlic, and carrots to make a meal out of it :D

This recipe isn't awful, but it's nothing to write home about, or give 5 stars, for that matter.  I did like the idea of using sesame seeds (black AND white for color variation).  I would suggest putting the sesame seeds on about halfway through the cooking process, though.  The white ones lost color by the end.

I love green beans, but this is my favorite way to prepare them, although I always seem to add too much soy sauce.  Even my mom (who said she didn't like green beans) enjoyed these!  DELICIOUS!

This was a nice side dish, but I really couldn't taste the sesame seeds.  I always follow the recipe the first time, but next time I make this, I'll add a bit of garlic and a splash of fresh lemon or lime juice to enhance the flavor.

These turned out so flavorful and the texture was a perfect crisp tender.  I did use half olive oil and half sesame oil which gave it more of an Asian taste.  A perfect accompaniment with teriyaki chicken and fried rice.

These green beans are delightful!  I love this recipe.  Be sure to brown the sesame seeds so their flavor really comes out.  They were perfectly seasoned as written, no changes necessary for this recipe!  However, I did have to use canola oil because I ran out of olive oil, but it was a success anyways.  They were a wonderful side dish for "Super Grilled Salmon" from this site.

These beans turn out tender-crisp, green, and full of flavor without using butter.  I resisted the urge to change anything (especially the minced garlic urge) and made them as written.  I would make them again with no changes.  I did have to add a little more chicken broth probably because I cook at high altitude.

These were good. I followed the recipe as written in my wok, which was very convenient because of the cover. They were just a little oily for me. I would try these again with less olive oil. I served them with a barley and chicken casserole.

Just made this tonight, but my stupid roommate used almost all of my sesame seeds and didn't tell me. But I followed the recipe after cutting it in half, and used the remaining chicken broth in my can for couscous.  But I didn't measure out the broth, so I had to strain it afterwards.   The beans turned out wonderful, but not as crispy as I was hoping. This time I used 20 or so sesame seeds and they toasted nicely. Hopefully when I use a full Tbsp the toasty flavor will stand out better.  Remember use MEDIUM heat. Too high and the beans will crackle

My family enjoyed this recipe. I have little ones so they can be picky. But this was just the right amount of seasoning for them. I cooked for 10 minutes covered and they were done. I really like that the bean was not masked by so much added stuff. It is easy and quick to prepare this in-season veggie.

These are very good.  My girlfriend likes them even better than my garlic green beans I make.  I also didn't add any garlic to the recipe as it would hide the toasty flavor of the sesame seeds too much.

Very delicate sesame flavour with every bite. I felt it needed more taste so I added some soy sauce. I usually toast my sesame seeds in a dry pan untill light brown, not with any oil as written here in the recipe so I just did without any oil at all. Overall, this is an easy side dish to put together and gives the beans a fresh light taste.  THX.

So easy and so tasty.  I brought this as a side dish for Christmas and everyone liked it.  I agree that this dish doesn't need garlic and it would completely change the taste.  The only thing I would add is that it took a lot longer than stated for the green beans to soften.  But I can't wait to make them again.

I make this side dish all the time, as it is the only type of green beans my husband likes.  However, instead of salt and chicken broth I use a couple of dashes of soy sauce.  It gives it a nice flavor!

These were pretty good.  I did add a couple of teaspoons of garlic as other recommended.  The sesame seeds gave them a nice "nutty" flavor.  I think without the garlic they would have been pretty bland though.  I did cook them for a shorter amount of time than called for, since I don't like my beans mushy.  They also reheated pretty well, which suprised me!

These did have good flavor.  You have to really watch the sesame seeds b/c they go from toasted to burned pretty quickly.

Made serving for two, using low-sodium chicken broth, and adding 1/2 tspn. sesame oil, one clove finely-minced garlic. I also added a bit of sesame oil (maybe 1/4 teaspoon) hoping this would enhance the flavor--but it didn't.  These beans just didn't have enough flavor for me, and ten minutes was definitely not enough time for them.  Next time I will use all sesame oil to cook the seeds, and maybe cook the beans 15 minutes.  This is a good basic recipe with potential, but I'll have to play around with it a bit more.  Since I like all the ingredients I'm willing to experiment with it again.

These were really easy to fix and had a nice flavor. I used frozen green beans and sesame oil instead of vegetable oil.

In the past I had avoided 'plain' fresh green beans, always putting them in casseroles etc. so they would not taste so rubbery. This recipe, however created phenomenal perfectly al dente green beans with a subtle salty coating caused by simmering them in the chicken broth. This is my new staple recipe for green beans!

These were surprisingly tasty! My husband usually won't eat green beans, but he was raving about these. They take a little longer to make, and the sesame seeds DO end up all over the stovetop and the floor(!), but they are worth it.

I added 3 cloves of garlic. I made additional servings the 2nd time and STILL had no leftovers! Thank you. Also, this pairs very nicely with Maple salmon by starfish on this site (be sure to add ginger with the salmon)!

It was an enjoyable side dish, but as soon as you add the green beans the sesame seeds pop all over the place.  It's helpful if you add a bit more olive oil, that way the beans don't stick together as much.  For more flavor I added a little bit of sherry.

These were good, but next time I will try using sesame oil in place of olive oil so they have more sesame flavor. I also had a problem with popping seeds and did not have the burner turned up too high, so beware!

Very healthy dish, I think a little sesame oil would definitely add to the flavor.  I used sesame seeds that were already toasted, so I put them in after the stir fry part.  There was no problem with the seed flying out of the pan.  I also think that using fresh beans makes a difference.  Will make again!

I like this recipe because it's quick and easy.  Sometimes, I don't have sesame seeds, and it's great without.  Also, I've been using one or two cubes of chicken bouillon with a quarter cup of water in the microwave for a minute as my broth.  This recipe is an easy way to add flavor to beans.

This was quite good.  I took it to a potluck and there wasn't any to take home!  I did take the advice of other reviewers and slightly modified the recipe.  I used about 1 tsp of sesame oil in a non-stick pan, and added 2 cloves of minced garlic with the sesame seeds.  I also used frozen green beans instead of fresh (that's what I had on hand), and it worked fine (though I only cooked them for about 6 minutes).

This was a great way to serve fresh green beens.  I've always been partial to butter, but of course....it's butter!  The smell of the toasted sesame seeds was mouthwatering, and the blend of oil, and sesame, and chicken broth made the beans delectable.  Thanks!

Used 1 tsp olive oil and 1 tsp sesame oil and added a minced garlic clove.  I'm sure it's marvelous with green beans, but there were no green beans on hand, so I used asparagus.  We LOVED it.  I'll try it with green beans as soon as I find some decent ones, but if not - asparagus again!!  Thanks for a wonderful and very fast recipe.

I hate fresh green beens, so I used canned, which turned out all right, except I burnt them. I also thought there was a very strong sesame flavor which was both good and bad (how's that for wishy-washy).

This recipe was very good.  Not stupendous, but very good.  My sesame seeds popped all over the place - maybe my pan was too hot?  So make sure you do have a lid for your pot!  Will make this again.

I ran out of chicken broth so I just used water.  It came out very good.  These green beans were a good compliment to Asian Beef Skewers and Asian Coleslaw. Even my 7 year old daughter cleaned her plate.

Easy to prepare. Great method for cooking fresh beans. Needs a little more flavor (although others dining with me said they loved it!) I would add more pepper next time.

These were quite good, although I think I will add some garlic next time for a little more flavour.  I served them to company, and everyone seemed to enjoy them.

I used this recipe as a "starter" b/c I love sesame seeds and sesame oil, which I subbed for the EVOO.
Also, I NEVER try to brown seeds (or any nut for that matter) in oil.  A dry skillet and the self control not to walk away for even a couple of seconds is all it takes.  
I followed the remainder of the recipe exactly as written and the flavor was good.  However, the time it took to toast the sesame seeds was lost b/c they came out soggy after all the liquid was added.  It decreased the toasted flavor and the texture of the seeds, which is exactly why you'd add seeds. nuts to a recipe.
Simple fix:  only add toasted sesame seeds to the top of the green beans once they are cooked, or, put seeds in a little bowl and let folks add them as an option.
Thanks for the recipe!

The only reason I am not giving  5 stars is you must cook much longer than the recipe states.  I cooked beans about 30 min on low.  They still had a little crunch but not much.  The seasoning was perfect.  Super easy, will be my go to recipe for green beans.

Nothing special. Maybe my seeds were too old. I added two Tbsp, but did not notice any real flavor. The broth dried up before the time was done, and they started to burn, but caught in time. Added more broth, but flavor not any better than if had cooked in water. Could have been my broth too, as it was a no sodium powdered kind. As cannot use a lot of sodium, do not anticipate any future results being any better, so will not make again. However, have used this powdered broth before with fairly good results, so not sure why did not turn out better.

DELICIOUS!!!  However, I did step it up a notch... I added red pepper flakes and white wine with the chicken stock, and tossed in some cherry peppers.   I actually added this to Ian's crispy noodles it was great...

The crispy noodle recipe she(Ian) has here is great also and I made some changes by adding a sliced habanero(we love spice) and instead of the snap peas , I used bean sprouts and then added these green bean recipe with the changes stated above on top.... it was amazing....

grazie Ian

Worked out great, I doubled the recipe and used fresh green beans. I had a bit too much liquid left at the end but that was not a big issue. I will use some sesame oil as well next time. All my guests loved it.

These were tasty. I highly recommend not using the oil and dry roasting the seeds. I had seeds flying every which way because of a tiny amount of water on the beans, from washing them.

Very tasty simple green bean recipe.  The broth disappeared too quickly so I added another 1/4-1/2 cup of water.  I also used Sea Salt vs. regular table salt.

Great news!  There is hope for the good ole green bean!  I made them exactly as the recipe indicated and, wa-lah, that was some good eating!  I concur with others who were con adding garlic, I like the taste of the sesame seed and oil.

It is as good as is mentioned in the other reviews.  I will do this again.  It made a very nice side dish.  I added garlic flavored sesame oil instead of the regular olive oil.

I made dinner for a group of 11 at a retreat and tripled the recipe. Very easy and flavorful. I'll add this to my own dinner menu. Simple easy way to cook green beans.

Pretty good! I would recommend putting in the sesame seeds closer to the end, cooking in the stock caused them to become soggy.

i don't change anything about this recipe. for my pound of green beans i look for the ones in the steam fresh bags(fresh beans not frozen, usually in the produce section). i love this recipe! i have made it several times & will continue to make them just as the recipe says. it's perfect & doesn't need changing.

These green beans got RAVE reviews at a family birthday dinner.  Hard to believe something so simple could be SO GOOD!  I used sesame oil instead of olive oil.

These were okay.  I made them exactly like the recipe called for and I found them to be a little boring.  Could have been the beans were not as fresh as they should have been from the market.

Something simple to do to add lots of flavor to an ordinary side. Find the sesame seeds in the spice area.

This dish was wonderful! I've been looking for different ways to make green beans and this recipe delivers. I used frozen green beans and it still turned out great. Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow! This recipe for green beans was delicious! I especially liked that it did not call for garlic as I was unable to have it during my pregnancy. Have already put this one in my favs. recipes.

Everyone really liked this recipe.  What a nice fresh, simple vegetable dish to serve!  And it's fun to make to!  I really got a kick out of how the sesame seeds "jumped" onto the beans and the sizzle with the chicken broth is nice and dramatic.  The dish is asian, but with very subtle flavor that will compliment most anything.  Really tasty and simple~!  Highly recommended.

I may cut back on the amount of oil used next time.  I also think I may have let them cook too long because they were a bit soggy.  Will try again because they were delicious otherwise!

This was really good. I added garlic to the sesame seeds and soy sauce and sesame oil at the end to adjust the seasonings.  I will make again and add other vegetables like carrots.

I was looking for something different to do with fresh green beans and this was perfect. The only change that I made was to add a little garlic with the sesame seeds  (since I love garlic)  - It was light and fresh, and very easy.

My husband (a vegtable snob) raved about this dish. I started w/ 1/2 box of sliced plain old white mushrooms sauted in the oil until really wilted and slightly browned before adding the sesame seeds. I toasted them in the pan along w/ the mshrooms & oil and then followed the orig. receipe. I also used frozen green beans and they worked just great. Thanks for another good idea for "what vegtable to fix tonight?"

Not bad. Depends on how you like your beans. Recipe calls for way more sesame seeds than is needed.

Very good simple recipe. Fantastic crisp green beans. I didn't have sesame seeds, so in place of the olive oil I simply used sesame oil. (Obviously omitting the sesame seeds altogether)I used this as a side dish to go with a chicken satay. Everything was delicious!

Soooo yummy, and so simple! The only change I made was to add a little soy sauce to the broth. I'm pretty sure they would have been just as delicious without it. Will definitely be making these again!

Very Good!  One thing I would suggest is don't add salt.  The broth has plenty in it.  Give the broth a chance to evaporate.  Then taste it.  If you still need salt then add it.  I added too early and my beans where a bit too salty.  But still delicious!

Maybe I'm missing something here.  I followed the recipe and the green beans were fine but I didn't think they were anything special.  Maybe it's because I normally add salt and pepper to green beans anyway.  I really don't think the chicken broth or sesame seeds added anything significant to the flavor.  The seeds looked pretty on the beans though.  :)

Very nice recipe, and would go with many main courses. I found the cooking time too long for our tastes, though. Used vegetable broth rather than chicken. I am vegetarian (unlike the rest of my family) so I could eat this too.

Very good although I used a bag of frozen green beans.  I did not add garlic as others have done which would have been really good as well.  Very easy to make.  Will sure to make this dish again.

Made these exactly as stated, and thought they were great -- 4.5 stars. However, my boyfriend LOVED them... because of that, I'd give this recipe SIX stars if I could. Thanks for making me look good! =)

Solid recipe that lends itself well as a side dish to almost any meal. The cooking time is a little long (for those of us who prefer a little crunch left in our vegetables) but it is very good. Leftovers are fantastic thrown into a pasta salad.

This recipe was good however I found it a bit bland.  I ended up adding sesame oil, chopped garlic and more salt n pepper.  Even added soy sauce.  Good but too bland for my taste.

These were the first fresh green beans that I've ever liked.  Delicious.  I steamed mine about 12 minutes, 10 minutes seemed a little too crispy.

Great recipe for an easy side dish, but make sure you cook it for the full recommended time...  it takes that long for the beans to take on the flavor.  I rushed it the first time I made them and they were much better when I was patient...

I made these with the Chicken Breast Pierre recipe from this site and they were a nice complement. While not fancy, they are a step up from plainly steamed green beans.

Very, very good.... I added garlic when I added the broth. These are the best way to get perfectly cooked fresh green beans! Not to crisp, not to soft. Will make again and again.

I love this best with the fresh green beans from the Farmer's Market in the summer. Very tastey and healthy!

This was good, although I think we should have added a little more salt and pepper.  I read previous reviews where people added fresh chopped garlic, I wish I had.  I used frozen green beans which were just fine.  I was hoping for a little more taste to this, but it was still good.

This would be better without the chicken broth as it makes the beans a little bit more soggy and we like crisp green beans.

These are good, but the sesame seeds jump around a lot!  Keep your lid nearby.  I also used toasted sesame oil and it adds a delicious flavor to the beans.

These were pretty good. I'll eat them again, but they didn't really do a whole lot for me. I like to make food that is good enough to serve in a restaurant, and this didn't do it. Husband hasn't asked for them again.

This was good, but the sesame flavor didn't quite come through enough for me, even though I used sesame oil and extra sesame seeds.  I think next time I will try toasting the seeds in my toaster oven for a few minutes, and then sprinkle them over the beans just before serving.  That way, none of the seeds will be stuck in the pan and wasted.

I used the time guidelines recommended and the beans were a little overcooked.  I'd reduce cooking time a tad in the future.  I also added some mushrooms for contrast.  Very nice touch.

I had to use canned green beans because the fresh ones at the grocery store seemed a little wilted and limpy. Still was a good side dish though. Good, but not great or excellent.

I found this recipe absolutely fabulous. I did take the advice of other reviewers and added a couple cloves of garlic. This will be one of our family favorites. I can’t wait to make it for my friends.

This recipe was OK but really nothing special.  Beans seemed a little "oily" with not much sesame flavor.  Probably won't make again.

Very delicious and easy to make.  I added 2 cloves of garlic (minced) and will probably add more next time.

These come out perfect every time. Perfectly seasoned and perfect texture. I always have a hard time with fresh green beans (cooking too soft or too tough). These never give me problems. Love em!

I made this using a can of wax beans that were cluttering up the cupboard. Delicious! Like others, I used a little sesame oil (half sesame, half olive). I didn't bother with any salt as the Kroger-brand chicken bouillon granules I use are rather salty on their own. This is a really nice twist on boring old plain beans. Quick, easy and very tasty. Thank you!

I loved this recipe. I was wondering though how to keep the sesame seeds from flying out of the pan. Whenever, I add the beans the sesame seeds start popping out of the pan. I would love some tips on this. Thanks!

Excellent recipe!!  A lot less fattening than simmered with bacon fat.  I've made this a few times and found the key difference to be what kind of chicken broth you use.  A cheap broth won't really enhance the flavor.  Use something like Butterball's Chicken Broth or maybe Swansons.

I had relatives over last night and wished I had doubled the recipe because everyone enjoyed it.  I did take the advise of some and used sesame oil and also soy sauce in the second part of the cooking.  I don't like crisp green beans, so mine cooked a little longer than stated. Definitely will make this again, but double the recipe.

My boyfriend and I absolutely loved it!    I added a crushed/chopped clove of garlic and used water instead of chicken broth.  Also tried it with some cayenne powder which spiced things up nicely.

Nice "ta-da" factor, and good flavor.  A touch of sesame oil in place of some of the olive oil enhances the sesame seed flavor of this dish.

These were wonderful and everyone ate them, even my 3 year old who does not care for vegetables.  I also had a problem with the sesame seeds popping, but I just removed the pan from the heat and added the beans on top of them.  This helped control the seeds.  Next time I may take some others suggestion of substituting sesame oil.

Very good.  Everyone liked them.  They were a little time consuming just because I had to make a big quantity.  I used a touch of sesame oil as well as olive oil so it gave it a little extra flavor.  Will make again.

These were pretty good. My only change is adding a bit of soy sauce. Also, the beans were cooked a bit too long for my taste - I like crisp green beans and these came out very soft. I will make again and cook for a shorter amount of time.

This was good, but beware of popping seeds!  I may have had the burner a litte high, as I was using someone else's stove, but when I stirred the seeds they starting popping out like BBs.

This recipe has become a regular in our house since I first tried it.  I added a bit of soy sauce instead of salt, near the end when the broth is mostly cooked out, to give it a stir-fry flavor.  I never seem to want canned green beans now, because this is so easy and so much better.

One of the better veggie recipes I've found.  But, I didn't think it was all that flavorful as others have posted.  It was only mildly different from plain green beans.  It has a nice presentation, though. I will make it again.

This was a very tasty recipe with the addition of a bit of worchestershire sauce, minced garlic, and sliced red pepper and a can of sliced mushrooms. The sesame seeds added a nice crunch. A very easy recipe to tailor to individual tastes.

This side dish is fantastic...has lots of flavor!  The only thing I would suggest is adding a little bit of fresh garlic to the recipe.  I also tried making this recipe with broccoli (as suggested by Rhonda), but it didn't taste as good as the green beans.
