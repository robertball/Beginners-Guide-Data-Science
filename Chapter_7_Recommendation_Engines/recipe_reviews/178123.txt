This was great. I heated mine up, 350* for 20 minutes. It tasted excellent warm. I also added Rosemary, Thyme, Salt & Pepper.

Pretty good, but easy on the garlic...  three cloves was too overpowering for one cup of cheese.

I buy goat cheese in 11 oz packages from Costco so this was a hard recipe to convert. I omitted the parley and used 1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes (whole from a jar - marinated in olive oil). I used the food processor, but first finely chopped the garlic, then added the SD tomatoes until finely chopped, and finally added the goat cheese until blended. The garlic was a bit overwhelming when the spread was tasted alone, but when spread on thinly sliced baguettes (1/4 inch thick or so) it tasted great. I added a few tablespoons of the olive oil from the SD tomatoes because the spread seemed too think. This made a wonderful recipe for a holiday appetizer and it was very well received. I didn't have time to roast the garlic (as one reviewer suggested), but I think that might have been even better.

This is definitely better if you make it a day ahead so the flavors can meld.  Very nice taste and easy to spread and it looks nice too!

To the 8 oz of goat cheese, I added 4 oz of cream cheese.  Instead of adding garlic, I covered it with pesto. Then covered all with the sun-dried tomatoes.  Lastly, I sprinkled on some pine nuts.  Very yummy.

I served it warm for friends.  It was well received, but I'd prefer to use about 4oz of cream cheese with the goat cheese.  Love the tomato & parsley flavors with it!

Definitely very tangy, and delicious, but a little goes a very long way!  I made this for a party this week and couldn't resist a taste.  I put in the recommended amount of garlic and thought it was fine--but I LOVE garlic.  This went really well with pretzel sticks; I'll have to bring those along with the crackers I was planning.  If you aren't a huge fan of goat cheese, doing half goat cheese and half cream cheese might cut the tang a bit.  If you don't want to measure the goat cheese into a cup (I didn't want to), a cup of goat cheese is 8 oz.  Thanks for the recipe!

Powerful flavors in this and I used roast garlic puree not fresh cloves, probably would go well with that glass of red wine, but it's only 9am... Quick and easy to make and well worth trying but not a keeper for me

Very good - but a little on the strong side. I would cut back the fresh garlic by 1 or 2 cloves. Otherwise very nice - thanks!

I bought "herb" goat cheese, let it get soft, and spread it on the bottom of my dish. I then put chopped sun-dried tomatoes (the kind in oil) on top, and finally topped with sliced greek olives. Awesome with wine!

I added some cream cheese to this to make it a little smoother. It was awesome. I cut back on the garlic. I can't wait to make if for a party I'm going to in July!

Simple yet delicious.  I added a few grids of pepper just to spice it up a little.
