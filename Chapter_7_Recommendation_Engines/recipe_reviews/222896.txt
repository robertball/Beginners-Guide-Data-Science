I thoroughly enjoyed this.  It was light and refreshing; a perfect post work cocktail while I worked on dinner.  I chose to garnish with cherries instead of a lime and used Diet 7-up in place of club soda.  Cheers!

This is perfect as written. Make sure you use fresh limes and good rum - it matters! This is a perfect, refreshing cocktail!
