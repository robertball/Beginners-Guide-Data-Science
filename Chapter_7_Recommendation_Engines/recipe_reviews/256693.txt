YUM!! I've been using AllRecipes for over 15 years but this is the first review I've ever written. It seemed appropriate that it's also the first review for this recipe. I did make a few changes, based on what I had.  (1) used sour cream (no Greek Yogurt) (2) added 1 tbsp sugar to cocoa/water mix (4) used 1 tsp vanilla, since that seems typical in baking recipes, thought the 1 tbsp. might have been typo.  The flavors are more subtle/mild than most recipes. The banana and chocolate are not overpowering, which I prefer because this bread goes great with hot cocoa, hot tea, coffee or a glass of milk, without having strong competing flavors. As the poster mentions, it is not real sweet. So if you want a bold, sweet flavor, this may not be what you're looking for. But if you want a simple, wonderful complement to a relaxing cup of tea, this is perfect! I also really liked the texture; some recipes are too moist-they can be too dense, almost doughy; others can be dry; this is moist without being overly heavy.  Thank you Chef V for sharing!

Thank you for posting this recipe, Chef V !    I made the recipe without changing anything.  I used the Fage 5% Greek Yogurt.  With the layering, there was almost a jellyroll-type design on the inside of the bread when it was cut.  I was happy with the flavor and texture of the bread.  I will make this again.  :)

Chocolate Marbled Banana Bread gets 5 * * * * * stars in my book. I followed the recipe except used regular yogurt did not have any Greek yogurt. Also, as a experiment added chocolate chips to the top center of the loaf (which had a tiny indentation) as soon as I removed the loaf from the oven.

This was delicious!  I replaced 1/2 the butter for an applesauce container, to save on some fat, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  This is definitely not a sweet bread, but it is very moist and dense, with a great banana flavor.  My bread was done in about 45 min (I baked it in a stone loaf pan).

Sour cream is a good substitute for yogurt if you don't have it. Very moist and just chocolaty enough. Friends always want more.

Scrumptious! I didn't change the recipe at all, but I did add some chopped walnuts and dark chocolate chips to the batter. Yummy!

Great cake!  Made 1.5x the recipe and baked in a 9x13‚Äùpan for 40 min.  Added 1 tbsp white sugar to cocoa and water.  Used 2 tsp of vanilla and split it between the cocoa mix and the liquids.
Not a sweet cake which was wonderful!

Ugh... overall it felt greasy (buttery) and I hate to have my fingers and mouth coated with that slippery feeling.

Tasty, not too sweet. I was out of time, so I baked in an 8x8 pan for ~35 minutes. Delish.
