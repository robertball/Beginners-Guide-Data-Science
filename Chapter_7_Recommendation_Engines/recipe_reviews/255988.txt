If you like eggnog and amaretto, you will like this! It is very sweet, so I think next time I will thin out the eggnog with a bit of milk before warming to cut down on the sweetness a bit. Nice recipe!

I made it with 1.5 ounces called for in the recipie.  It was not as flavorful as I expected so I increased the amaretto to 2.5 ounces and the drink was very nice and smooth.
