I was a little worried at first when I made these bars that they would fall apart since the crust doesn't seem like it will hold together before you bake it. I was pleasantly suprised! These bars were yummy. The blueberry filling was tart (which I liked) and the crust and topping were perfect. I thought the recipe called for the perfect amount of sugar. Sweet enough, but not too sweet. I used regular oats (since I did not have any quick oats) and I used a 8x8 pan istead since this would have been really hard to spread across a 13x9 (especially the blueberry filling). I would suggest used more blueberries if you want to bake this in a 13x9 inch pan. The only downfall of using the smaller pan was that it took almost twice as long to bake (but I was also baking it in stoneware so that may have had something to do with it.) I would definately make these again. I took it to a fourth of july picnic and everyone seemed to like them!

Two ratings from our house: hubs LOVED 'em and even had a rare second helping of dessert after dinner! When I asked him why he thought they were so good he said he didn't know how to articulate it, he just knows what he likes, and he gives these five stars. I, on the other hand, rate them three stars - I thought they were okay, but not outstanding. I made half again as much filling, and am glad I did. I can't imagine these would be blueberry-y enough with a mere two cups for a 9x13 pan with all that crumb mixture! I loved the filling, and it was perfectly sweet and hinted with lemon, but the crumb mixture fell short in my view. Too oaty tasting, with little flavor - kind of flat. I think it definitely needed some vanilla and salt to enhance the flavor, if not a little cinnamon as well. It certainly is easy to put together, and I love the fact that it uses "real" blueberries rather than jam or pie filling. But I think the recipe needs to be tinkered with.

I made this recipe yesterday exactly as stated with the exception of adding 1 tsp. of Cinnamon to the oat/flour mixture.  There was just enough blueberries filling to spread a thin layer across the crust afterall, this is not a blueberry pie, so the amount was perfect and it had a great crunch the way bars should be.  Excellent - My Family Loved Them!!! :-)

These were a huge hit! I made them a few times and found that they came out best using frozen blueberries, about 2 extra tablespoons of butter, a smaller pan (8x8), and cooking them for an extra 10 minutes or so. All the ways I made them came out great, the above is just a preference! These are good fresh out of the oven with vanilla ice cream, room temperature, or refrigerated!

I followed the advice to bake these in an 8 by 8 pan, and I added about half a teaspoon of cinnamon to the oat mixture.  They turned out amazingly!  Thicker than most bars of course, but delicious.  I made them to serve to company and they were eaten up.  I'd like to try this with raspberries too.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Absolutely delicious. I only had frozen blueberries that had been sitting in the freezer a while, but they still turned out great! Like others, I added a little cinnamon to the blueberry mixture, which really pumped up the flavor. The only problem is that hubby and I didn't eat them quickly enough, and after a couple days, the crust started getting soggy. Guess I'll have an excuse to scarf them down next time. :)

A few adjustsments will have to be made on this one. First l would lessen the sugar to 1c. Second l definitely would up the blueberry content to 4c. (actually l used both blueberries and blackberries. Then up the lemon juice and corn starch. Otherwise these bars are pretty good.

I used 3 cups blueberries and used 50/50 flour. It was a big hit with my husband. He wants me to freeze enough blueberries so that he can have this 1x each month.

I made it with frozen raspberries instead then sprinkled some fresh ones on the top. It was incredible!! I didn't use all the remaining crumb mixture for the topping as I thought it was already a majority of the recipe. Serve on a plate with a dollop of whipped cream.

I have made these about 4 times now (with blueberries, fresh and frozen, and also with fresh raspberries) and they are perfect with a couple of changes:
1. Up the berries to 3 cups
2. Use 1 cup flour instead of 1 1/2 cups
3. Use 2 cups oats instead of 1 1/2 cups

If you do the recipe as written, there aren't enough berries and there is too much flour. Upping the oats and lessening the flour really helps the consistency. I get asked for this recipe every time I make these!

These are perfect! Just a few simple ingredients, of course, I had to tweak it a bit to make it healthier, whole wheat flour, agave instead of sugar, smart balance instead of butter.  But for the life of me I can't understand why "Men especially love them"...(kind of a sexist statement) my whole family loved them, guys AND gals!!!!!

These are decent.  They are not very sweet and the ratio of blueberry to crumb is not right.  Double the blueberries and add cinnamon to the crumb mixture.

Great recipe! Cheap and EASY!!! Sold out at the bake sale!!! I used about 1/4 c more flour, sugar, and butter, and two 12 oz bags of frozen blueberries, and I accidentally dumped way more cornstarch in the saucepan, but this recipe can take it! Delicious!  Next time I will try adding cinnamon and salt to the flour mixture. Thanks!

We liked this recipe. I followed it exactly, and I for sure need some practice at cutting in butter (I made a mess).  My husband them, I will make them again.  Perfect for blueberry season and soooo easy!

Only change was adding a 1/2 teaspoon or so of cinnamon to the base/topping mixture and a sprinkle of nutmeg to the topping.  I don't remember the last time I took a desert to a family gathering that flew off the plate like these did!  One person who didn't even get to taste them asked for the recipe because she heard they were so good.

Very yummy but tweaked recipe a bit...used a 8 by 12 glass pan instead so crust was easier to make then doubled the blueberry filling and added a bit of cinnamon then spread it on the crust and sprinkled extra blueberries all over before putting on the topping. It was excellent and was gone in a flash!

I made these for a coupon party at a friends house last night.  They were a big hit!  The top was a bit crumbly but the bottom held together just fine.  The blueberry sauce was very good, and not to sweet.  Just right.  Also i used frozen Maine blueberries.  I like to rate a recipe for how its written, not with a dozen changes I think might improve it.  So no changes were made to recipe.  Fast, easy and yummy.  You won't be disappointed.

made exactly as stated, and this was absolutely delightful. it wasn't even out of the over 15 minutes before we couldn't help but eat it right out of the pan. i like that it's nice and thin and crunchy. perfect sweetness. amazing when warmed and served with a bit of vanilla ice cream or whipping cream. would definitely make again.

These were very good, but next time I won't use as much of the crumble mixture in top-it was too much. I used 3 cups frozen blueberries and 1 cup fresh raspberries. My whole family loved them!

This tasted really good, and was even liked by the picky kids in my Sunday school class (and they are PICKY!) I did add cinnimon to the crust/topping mixture, and I added about a cup more berries to the mixture. I used the pan size given, and even with the extra cup of berries I would have liked more topping, so I would go with doubling the recipe. Even with the changes, this recipe is totally a keeper, and I can't wait to make it again!

Mmmm, so good!  I followed the recipe exactly the way it was written.  Wouldn't change a thing.  When making the bars I used fresh blueberries and cut the butter in thin slices so that it would blend easily.    Definitely will make these again!

I also added more blueberries (about 2 cups) and I lightened the recipe by substituting some margarine (about half butter/half margarine) for a total of about 1/2 cup instead of 3/4.  To add some more liquid to the crust to make up for the loss of the butter, I drizzled some honey to the crust mixture.  I also sprinkled a little cinnamon to give it a little something extra.  Overall, delicious blueberry bars!  Made them with blueberries that I picked just this morning at a nearby farm.  Yummmmm!

Pretty good! Made a ton of substitutions (made my own blueberry chia jam, half white/brown sugar, 2 cups oats, 1 cup flour, 1 cup butter, added 2 tsps cinnamon). Needed to be refrigerated to firm up a bit but excellent taste! Loved how this wasn't too sweet. Thanks!

Amazing! These bars are so easy to make and turn out great everytime. Also I did add cinnamon as was recomended from other reviews. Thanks for sharing your recipe! I have been looking for a home made replacement for the ones I usually get from Sbucks and these will definitley do the job.

had to cook for closer to 45 minutes instead of 25 for it to be "lightly browned", other than that I swapped out blueberries with apple butter (omit the cornstartch & lemon juice) worked really well!  will be on my list of easy and tasty recipes!

These are so yummy. I used old-fashioned oats and 2.5 cups of frozen blueberries, based on the other reviews.  They turned out great.  Can't wait for another special occaision to make them.

Yummy...Yummy....Yummy.
Packed with Blueberry flavor. I used Splenda brown sugar blend  ~ whole wheat flour ~ and a soft No Trans fat butter spread.  You truly dont miss the sugar, butter or white flour.  Super Good !

Pretty good but I've had much better. I would probably add a little more butter next time because I thought it was a little dry.

Terrific!! I add a little cinnamon to the oats/flour mixture and used turbinado sugar. So, so good! I had my first and second sample with vanilla ice cream. Wow!

Yummy bars.  Easy, basic recipe.  Had to sub instant oatmeal packets since I had the filling boiling by the time I realized I didn't have regular oatmeal.  Adjusted sugar lower in crumb mixture to account for the stuff already mixed into the packets.  I also used raspberries because I had them on hand, but I would think berries of any type or rhubarb would be fine for this recipe.

I thought this was a great recipe and my family liked it too. I used frozen strawberries since my family doesn't care for blueberries as much and I also used  "I Love Oat's" apple cinnamon version of instant oats which has a little flax seed in it for the health conscious ;o).....Because I used 5 packs of the instant oats with has cinnamon and sugar I decided the cut back a little on the recommended sugar amount and it worked out fine. I also used wheat flour and water in place of cornstarch since we didn't have any. I topped it off with little tabs of butter on top when it was almost time for the bars to finish baking since I love a buttery taste and since my mix looked a little dry when I checked it at the half way bake point.

Great tasty bars - but I increased the blueberries to 3 cups and next time I will try them with brown sugar to add some moisture because they were a little crumbly.  I would make them again.

While we liked that the bars were easy to pick up and eat, my husband and I found both the base and filling to be lacking in flavor. I suggest using brown sugar rather than white in the crust as well as some vanilla.  Since we pick our own wild blueberries, I was disappointed by the blandness of the filling and felt I had wasted them somewhat. I would use regular oats rather than quick oats, find them rather "dusty".

Yum!  I tried these because my husband wanted me to make the raspberry oatmeal bars again which I wasn't a big fan of so I looked for a similar recipe and found this one.  I am so glad I did.   Did I say yum?  I used a food processor for ease in preparation, adding the oatmeal at the last minute.  I also added just a little extra blueberries because I love blueberries.  This is a terrific recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

Would have given them 5 stars but were crumbly.  They just didn't stay together well.  I followed others advice and added some salt and vanilla to the crumb mixture to give it a bit more flavor.  Made them twice already once with blueberries and once with blackberries.  Very tasty!!!!

First time making a bar, and I say it's a success.  Next time I'm going to add a 1/2 cup more of blueberries for the real juice of it, of yeah you can also subsitute some of the butter for applesauce but if you want that real buttery flavour I advise not because it's almost worth it. Next time I'm also going to add more oats in place of flour because those float my boat more and I also added 1/2 cup of oat bran so good idea for all you health nuts like me.  It took exactly 25 minutes in the oven and it filled the house not just with it's aroma but it's feeling.

Really great recipe and I love that it doesn't use a cake mix.  Made pretty much as written, but I did a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, salt and vanilla to the oatmeal mixture.  Kept to the amount of butter called for and I was very glad I did (didn't want to add anymore calories and it held together well without the extra.)  Baked in a 9 inch springform pan~ the slices made a really pretty presentation.  Thanks!

These were good, but I think I will follow some of the suggestions next time.  They need something a little extra, I like the cinnamon idea.  I also thought they didn't need quite as much sugar as it called for.

I am making these all the time now but I use 3/4 cup applesauce instead of butter to lower the fat. I promise you, it works, makes the bars very chewy, and of course saves hundreds of calories. I use 3 cups of blueberries. These freeze well.

I had a difficult time with these.  I feel the bottom crust should been pre baked, it was very flimsy.  The blueberry sauce didn't spread at all, maybe cook just until thickened.  The amount could be increased as well.  It didn't brown up too well so I broiled it until it got a bit more golden.  They tasted pretty good.  My only change was to add a bit of salt.

These were really, really good!  My eldest son is a blueberry fiend, and must have had 3 helpings before dinner.  Needless to say there wasn't much left by the end of the night.  The only thing I did differently is to use 4 cups of berries, I had frozen and they worked fine.  Will definitely make again & again.  I already have requests for the recipe.

I didn't quite have 2 cups of blueberries, so I cut the recipe by 1/3rd.  The crust was really dry.  Not enough blueberries for the crust/crumbles.  But, like many others, my husband liked it.

These are excellent with no changes. I even froze them for a month as an experiment to see how much in advance of my daughter's wedding that they could be made. My expert taste tasters at work raved about them!

Great simple tasty fruit bar; received rave reviews when I brought some to work. I particularly like that you cook the fruit on the stovetop first, it makes it easy to use frozen berries without changing the bake time.

This was a good base recipe, as many have stated before. I made the oat mixture with a little vanilla extract, half brown sugar, half white sugar, and cinnamon. As for the blueberry mixture, I actually added half brown and half white sugar as well and threw in a generous splash of vanilla, squeezed half a lemon, and a little cinnamon and boiled it until it was almost jam-like. Everyone who tried it was amazed. They said it was a cross between blueberry coffee cake and a nutrigrain bar. I LOVED it. I also ate it with vanilla icecream warm. MMMMM!

Excellent!  Made a few minor changes (including adding a few drops of vanilla to the crumb mixture and adding cinnamon to the blueberries) and this turned out perfectly.  Probably would have been good without my minor changes- but this kicked it up a tiny bit.  Loved them- these will go FAST!  Used a few more blueberries than it called for, and it fit in a 9X13 pan just fine!

I thought they were extremely thin & dry.  Almost could have used brown sugar in the crumbs or something to make them stick together & not fall apart.  Canned pie filling might make these better.

These came out fantastic! I made them yesterday and they are almost all completely gone! I love how these are not overly sweet, but absolutely delicious.  In the crumb mixture I added 1/2 cup granulated sugar and 1/2 brown sugar for a richer taste. I will make these again!

these were really good, I enjoyed making and eatting them, I'm not sure what they need but they could you a little more something to jazz the flavor up as I found it could be a bit more flavorful.

These tasted ok. I didn't think they were anything special. The blueberry filling was hard to spread because there wasn't really enough of it. I won't make this again.

Really easy and very good.  I served them in a bowl with ice cream on top and it was a bit heavy.  Just a stand alone bar cookie is very yummy.

I just made these for the first time.  They are totally delectable!  My kids and I even had seconds, they're THAT divine!  They are remarkably similar to a huckleberry bar we bought while vacationing in Glacier National Park, in Montana - there is a renowned bakery at Pole Bridge.  These taste as good as, if not better!  My kids requested that I send a pan with my husband to share with is coworkers, and my son wants to take a pan with him to our neighbors' birthday party.  High praise, indeed!  Next time I make them, I MIGHT mix up a batch of icing to drizzle over the top, but why mess with perfection?

A little blueberry flavor.  A lot of buttery crumb flavor.  Next time I will try 3 - 4 cups blueberries with almond extract.  Also will add a little salt to the crumb mixture.  It didn't brown after 29 minutes.  The broiler helped to toast the top.

The only change I made was to use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar in the crumb part.  These are okay, but the crust is a little bland - I think that a pinch of salt and a little cinnamon would really help.  The blueberry filling turned out great and was not runny and oozing out like I have had some recipes in the past do.  Overall, this turned out well and I am sure that they will be well received at my meeting tonight.

These have become a staple in my house. They are so SO easy to make and really really yummy! I can whip up a batch in just a few minutes and voila! we have a treat to snack on casually, or a simple but always well received dessert for guests. I've made them with blackberries and raspberries too. Both were successful, but the blueberries are the best.

I added 1/2 tsp. of salt and 1 tsp. cinnamon to the oat mixture. I used 3 cups of frozen blueberries.  I added 1/4 cup water, little bits at a time as needed to the boiling mixture as it seemed super thick.  Could be because berries were frozen.  I used 2 sticks of butter in the oat mixture to get what I thought was the perfect crumb consistency.  I used an 11x7 pan as that was a good in between size.  Not too thin not too thick.  Turned out delish!

Wonderful! Yummy! Loved them! I threw in an extra handful of blueberries and made them in a slightly smaller pan (11 x 7). They turned out perfect and did not stick around long at all.

These came out really good, I used a bit more butter than called for cause I couldn't get the crumb the way I wanted it. Also used 1.5 teaspoons of vanilla to the crumb mixture, cooked till golden brown and it came out great. Make sure wait till they have cooled to try them. Thanks for the recipe.

These were delicious - I did make a few changes. I added some salt and cinnamon to the crust mixture. I also cut back on the sugar by about a 1/4 c. I also used an entire bag of frozen blueberries for the filling but didn't change other measurements for the filling. I baked in an 8 x 11 pan, which worked out perfectly.

I really love this recipe.  I added cinnamon because I prefer it.  I also doubled the filling, but didn't use it all, I think as directed it would make enough, and I baked in a 9x13 pan.  It came out great- the bars didn't crumble when cut, they help their shape nicely, and they tasted natural and delicious!  A great snack.

Wow.  These oat bars are addictive.  Here's what I found that may be helpful:  Other reviewers were right.  An addition of salt (probably what equates to a little over 1/4 tsp) to the crumb topping mixture and a splash of vanilla extract (1/4 tsp) to the blueberries sends it out of this world.  I thought the vanilla helped in my case because I didn't have any lemons.  Also, if you don't have any quick oats like me, normal oats will work just fine.  Slightly chewy but honestly I find that works well with the overall texture.  Yum!

Made Raspberry Oat Bars. Sooooooooooo  yummy if you prefer it more tart than blueberries.2 + 1/2 cups would not hurt (but 2 generous cups worked fine.  I used 2 Tbsp. lemon juice + 1 tsp. My coworkers all loved it.  A bit of whipped cream?? Yummo!!

I made this last week and have been asked several times already when I'm making another batch.  I absolutely love them!  I did use some of the suggestions from others and added a pinch of salt and cinnamon to the oat mixture and modified the blueberry mix to 3 cups blueberries, 3 tbsp corn starch, and 3 tbsp lemon juice.

I took the advice of previous readers (and my own experience w/crumble toppings), and added a little salt and cinnamon to the crumble mix.  I also added about 1/2 tsp vanilla to the blueberry mix and mashed the blueberries so they would spread easier.  I would definitely add at least a cup more blueberries/fruit next time as my fruit to crust ratio is a little higher, I'd also add more oats and reduce the flour.  The top didn't brown as much as I would have liked in the 25 mins. so I put under the broiler for a couple of minutes. Great starter recipe to adjust to your own tastes!  Thanks for posting!

These bars are SUPER quick and easy! :-) The preparation was very quick. I did add some cinnamon to the batter to give it a little bit of a KICK! They were kinda messy. I would add maybe some water or vanilla to get it a little more thick. But all in all these bars were SUPER scrumptious! VERY GOOD RECIPE! Keep 'em common Deena!

YUM!! With a family of 7 and a home daycare to feed, I decided to double the recipe and added an extra cup of blueberries, half a cup of sugar and 1/2 tbsp of cornstarch to the filling. I also added a tsp of cinnamon to the oatmeal mixture for extra flavor.  Once ready to bake, I sprinkled fresh grated nutmeg and cinnamon to the top of it and it was a huge success!!! Very easy to make and the daycare children had a blast helping out!

Delicious! These were pretty easy to put together, and taste great. I and my 3 kids under 6 devoured them. I accidentally used 2/3 cup of sugar in the blueberry mixture instead of 1/2 cup and it came out just fine. I'm looking forward to trying this with other fruits. It would be great with a little added cinnamon, too!

These squares are great!! Everyone loved them, i added a little bit of cinnimon to the batter as well as to the blueberry sauce as well as vanilla extract for a little bit of different flavour.

I followed what others suggested ( adding cinnamon and using an 8x8) And i found this dessert good, and satisfying. Although it was way to crumbly, and didn't hold shape at all. But that makes me think i did something wrong.. Oh well. Thanks for sharing! (=

I was dissapointed by these bars.  I was expecting great results but they were only so-so even though I added some vanilla and cinnamon to the crumble to give it more flavor.

I read some reviews, and it sounded like it needed some tweaking. Once I made it, the four guys who were over at our place ate it up. They loved it! I stuck with the 13"x9" pan instead of the 8x8" pan that some suggested, because I didn't want them too thick. I used unsalted butter, and I added 1/2 tsp of salt to the crumb mixture. The salt gives it a bit of a savory-sweet taste to the crust. I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and a dash of cloves to the crumb mixture for an extra kick. After I cut in the butter, I sprinkled 1 tsp of vanilla on top of the crumbs and tossed it. I added a few drops of vanilla to the blueberry mixture also. The key to the blueberry mixture is to keep mixing and boil it enough so that it starts to expand and get thicker. I thought it made just enough to spread around, but maybe I'll try using 3 cups of blueberries next time. Came out great. The guys said I could sell it in a bakery!

Following some of the other suggestions posted, I added about 1 tsp. of cinnamon to the crust/topping. I used half quick oats and half long cooking - the texture is very nice. I also made it in a smaller pan (8 x 11). I increased the blueberries to 3 cups, but did not change the sugar. Used lime juice instead of lemon b/c that is what I had. The filling got a little too thick, so I added a splash of water and was able to pour this all over the crust. I lightly patted the topping on. I had a similar problem with browning. But it was quite tasty. I think it was even better the next day. Kids rated it as "medium goodness". Hubby and I liked it alot.

These were great. I also used an 8x8 pan and added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the oat mixture which was a great addition.  I had expected these to be 'finger food' and instead we needed spoons since it was very crumbly on top.  I DID use the food processor to cut the butter into the oat mixture, so this most likely affected the extra fine crumbliness.....  BUT I think it doing that actually made these SUPER awesome... it make a super yummy sugary crunchy fine topping to it.

That was so true that men like these! I gave them to 3 men and  they asked me the next day for more of them! These are a great way to use your frozen blueberries in a health snack with oats and blueberries. Very yummy and easy!

This is delicious. I used W.W. Pastry flour in place of white flour. I used Splenda instead of sugar. I used a vegan non-hydrogenated margarine for the butter since I'm vegan. I added 1t. of almond extract to the filling mixture. I added some cinnamon in the crumble mixture and sprinkled some cinnamon/splenda mixture on top before baking. Thank you SO much for this recipie.

These were absolutely wonderful.  I was dubious about the crumb crust/topping, especially in light of all that bubbly berry juice, but it holds together magically.  I used a mix of three berries and added more than the recipe called for (never too many berries, right?).  I'll likely make it this way again since I fear the crust would be overwhelming without.  Great recipe!

These are awesome. I was feeling kind of guitly about all the calories. The second time, I used "Can't believe it's not butter, half brown sugar and half whole wheat flour. They were still wonderful. Great way to use fresh blueberries.

These were awesome !! I added a Tbsp. of butter and a 1/2 tsp. of vanilla to the blueberry filling. It seemed to need to be kicked up a tad. I'll definitely make these again , but I'm eager to try different fruit fillings also. Thanks for the yummy recipe ! 5 stars and two thumbs up !!

This was amazing! I made it and brought it to work and it DISAPPEARED so fast! People loved it so much they complained coz they wanted to eat so much of it! I didn't use the remaining dry mixture for the topping, just enough to cover the blueberries.  Other than that, the recipe is perfect and I'll definitely make this again.

I had no trouble at all fitting this into a 13 x 9 pan as the previous reviewer mentioned.  The only reason I'm only giving 4 stars is that the topping was a bit dry.  The taste was wonderful but would be better served on a plate and eaten with a fork since it was a bit crumbly.  I think this could be remedied by using a full cup of butter.  I used frozen blueberries and it worked great.  I think it would also be really good with a mixed berry filling.
