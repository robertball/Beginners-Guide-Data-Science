Excellent receipe.  I failed miserably with the thicker glass pan, even with non-stick spray.  I tried again with a 10x15 jelly roll pan, and the results were fantastic.  Rolled so much easier!  I submitted the photo for this recipe, so you can see how nice it rolled up.  

I'd highly recommend adding whatever typical omelette ingredients you prefer (ham, green peppers, etc).  The taste may be a little plain without any -- just like a normal omelette would.  I also used sharp cheddar to bring out the cheese taste as well.  

Makes for a very nice presentation, especially compared to how simple it is to arrange.  After rolling, sprinkle a little extra cheese and parsley flakes on the top, and it will look very nice.

Wow!  I did a test run of this recipe this morning and I thought it was great. Tomorrow for company I will add extra goodies like sauteed mushroom and onions or diced tomato and avocado, but today I made the recipe as written but used colby jack cheese instead of cheddar.  I lowered the oven to 425 and cooked it for 10 minutes.  It probably could have cooked for only 8 and been done.  I sprayed a glass 9x13 baking dish generously with Pam and it rolled beautifully, cut like a dream, and had an overall unique and neat presentation.  My only complaint is that my three year old who eats ANYTHING wasn't so thrilled with this.  That said, I really just want to make it for company.  It is an interesting crossover between a crepe and eggs.  For those who reduce the flour, I think it will lose some of the "crepeness" of it and I could see where it would just taste like eggs and cheese at that point.  It is mildly flavored so add spices and fillings to your liking.

This is delicious.  Twenty minutes is  too long to cook however.  I replaced the milk with half water, half milk. (fluffier and lighter)  I added mushrooms, onions, greenpepper and broccoli.  I think I used about 1/2 the flour too.  I cooked it for 10 minutes and took it out and put on the cheese and veggies and rolled quickly.  It's hot, but it comes up easier if it's still very warm.  I took it work for a parent appreciation breakfast and I had to give the recipe out to several ladies. **Oh, and I used a bisquit pan and poured the eggs in it when the pan was already in the oven.**  Didn't spill a drop!  I used crisco to grease pan and it came loose very easily.

This was very good, but after reading through ALL the reviews, I did change it up some. I decided to still review this because I feel that this is a great method and it really has a lot of potential with a few changes. I used 9 eggs, reduced the flour to 1/4 cup, about 3/4 cup milk and the salt and pepper. After blending, I mixed in a little chives, dill and parsley. I poured it into a 10x15 sheet pan that was well sprayed with cooking spray and put it in the oven @ 350 degrees, until just set (it took about 8 mins. in mine, but my oven is very hot). I removed it, loosened the edges w/ a spatula and sprinkled it with some finely chopped onions and green peppers that I sauteed in a little olive oil, salt, pepper and garlic powder and then topped it w/ the cheese. I popped it back in the oven for about 2-3 minutes, just until the cheese melted, took it out and let it sit for maybe 4-5 mins. and then rolled. It rolled beautifully, cut perfectly and tasted delicious. Again, I just wanna say that this IS a great method of cooking an omelet, it just needs tweaked a little, IMO. I will definately be making this again and I can't wait to try it with different veggies and meats added! Thanks for sharing. :)

Been making this for 15 years and finally learned a few tricks to making this work.  No more scraping my glass pans & ending up w/ an ugly roll that is half stuck to the pan. Now I Use large cookie sheet lined with parchment paper. It rolls up beautifully w/ no mess to clean. I also only bake at 400 or 425 for less time.  Lastly I use 1/2 water, 1/2 half n half instead of the milk & add a few shakes of dry mustard to the mixture. Now I end up w/ a beautiful & tasty roll I am proud to present.

Easy and quite a pretty addition to our Christmas Brunch table.  Reading the previous reviews, I used additional fillings - - among them, raw sliced mushrooms that baked into the omelette wonderfully.  HINT: Lining the pan with a large piece of parchment paper makes rolling a cinch. Thanks Lori!

Of course this is not really an omelete. This recipe should really be called Rolled Baked Eggs. Omelet's are made in pans and take about 1 minute to cook (if that) and are not that easy to get right. Baked eggs do not taste like omelet's nor do they have the same texture. Nevertheless, this recipe is fair and the simplicity is there. Taste is ok if you go with the original recipe but I second the motion to add whatever your fave fillings are and don't try to serve it "rolled up." Just serve it from the dish you baked it in. It's baked eggs, which are are wonderful, but it's not an omelet.

I don't remember where I originally got this recipe but my recipe says to line the baking sheet with greased parchment paper.  It makes it MUCH easier to roll.  Also I roll from the long edge, the other roll makes for too much omelet, plus you can feed more people rolling from the long side.  I sometimes add salsa before I roll and then serve with sour cream and avocado.

Don't use butter to grease the pan for this recipe.  It burns and makes it hard to roll the omelet when its done.

Excellent and so easy! I cut the recipe in half and baked in an 11" x 7" pyrex baking dish for 10 minutes, then topped it with cheese, ham, and broiled just a minute, until the cheese started to melt. No problems rolling it up, because I sprayed the dish with PAM before I poured in the egg mixture. The texture is great, but you MUST do this in a blender to get it right. Whisking the ingredients in a bowl will not work, so don't even try it! Thanks Lori - this is a keeper!

Added some cubed ham and chopped green onions. Loved the fact that this was baking while I was concentrating on making our pancakes and hashbrowns. Like the reviewer before me - the combinations and additions are endless! Thanks Lori!

I must say, I think Baked Omelet Roll is an excellent name for this recipe. If cooking for say, 4 or fewer, I'd make custom omelets. But I made it for my church choir as a thank you breakfast after they worked super hard for a series of successful Christmas concerts.  It was perfect for this.  I made 3 pans, and set out an eight compartment lazy susan with various toppings (crublbled bacon, smoked salmon, salsa, etc.) Made a super nice presentation, and I could actually sit down with them and enjoy, rather than standing there and cooking 20 separate omelets.  Great concept!!  I'll use it again and again.

I made this recipe this morning and it was a hit! I changed a few things to my taste. 1. I used heavy cream instead of milk. 2. I used about 1/4 cup of flour with a little water to make sure it mixed in properly. 3. Added dried herbs and spices (any will do). Blend away! Heated oven to 400 degrees instead so I could be sure not to over bake my magic eggs;). While waiting for oven, I grilled up a little onion, crisped some bacon and mixed those bad boys up on the side. Followed recipe at this point and made sure to PAM the heck out of my Pyrex(this was key). Ok, back to my style, at about the 10 minute mark, I added a thin layer of blue cheese, bacon,onion, and sharp cheddar cheese. Don't over do it! You have to roll this thing remember. I finished in oven (about 12 more minutes). I checked for the jiggle in da middle, if you know what I mean to make sure it was done(no jiggle=done). Last but not least, I cut up some avocado and added it at the end. Pull edges away from sides and slide out onto a cutting board. Gently roll and  sprinkle with more cheese on top. Now go wow the mouthes waiting for you! Good luck!;)

This was rather cool to make!  I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews so I lessened the flour a little and I set my time for 12 minutes instead of 20 mins. Good thing, it was done is 12 minutes!  Perfectly cooked. I poked it so the air would go out of it and then I added some precooked chopped red, green & yellow peppers, cilantro, and the cheese.  Rolled it up after carefully loosening the sides as recipe states. Looked lovely sprinkled with some cilantro.  It was quite a delicious addition to my Mother's Day brunch.  Thank you Lori!

I used this recipe to make the sheet of baked eggs then used a cup to cut out circles of egg for English muffin breakfast sandwiches that I assembled in bulk and froze. The eggs tasted GREAT and after cooking I could tell that they would have rolled into an easy roll. Great recipe, multi use.

I've made this dish twice now. The first attempt I followed the recipe exactly, the end result was a complete failure & waste of ingredients and my time. However with the second go around I decided before hand that I would read reviews by other's and take in consideration their suggestions. I ended up with this:1st instead of using the mentioned 1/2 cup of flour I only used 1/4 & replaced 1 cup of milk w/ 1/2 cup of water, 1/2 cup of milk, just like someone had suggested. (Also suggested) I reduced the oven temp. to 425 deg. & cut the cooking time in half ( 10 min ). I also skipped the  rolling it part at the end, i found it easier just to divide it into squares.

Instead of the shredded cheese, I softened an 8 oz. block of cream cheese, added fresh herbs from my garden and a clove of garlic finely minced.  I also added fresh cracked pepper.  I spread it on top of the eggs as it came from the oven and rolled according to directions.  It was absolutley delicious and my 5 year old wants it again!

I made this omelet this morning. Wow!!! It was awesome. I made it for 1 person and it came out perfect. I used 1 egg, 1/8 tsp of both salt and pepper, 2 tbsp & 2 tsp fat free milk, 1/4 tsp onion powder & garlic powder, 1/4 tsp pasley flakes, 1/4 tsp Mrs.Dash seasoning, 1/2 tsp flour, cut up 1/2 piece of small ham steak, a few chopped onions, and put in a blender then shredded 1/4 cup fresh chedder cheese and put aside the cheese. I lined an 8x8 glass pan with parchment paper, put it in a 425 degree preheated oven and baked for 15 minutes. At 10 mins in the oven, I added the cheese on top and finish baking for 5 more mins. It came out perfect and rolled with unbelievable ease onto a plate. I then proceeded to consume it. Wow, it was delicious and so easy to make. I will definitely be making this one again. Even though I downsized to 1 person, it came out perfect. It is a versatile recipe that you can use anything you have on hand. I have to give this one 5 stars.

Not sure what happened to my original review.  Looks like all but the first sentence was deleted.  In regards to the recipe, some of the ingredients and instructions are wrong.  I'm sure others caught the same thing but I will share what I did instead.  Use a non-stick pan (9x13 is fine) and spray with a non-stick or butter spray.  Preheat the oven to 400 (450 is WAY too hot).  Use 6 eggs, less than a 1/4 cup of either milk or heavy cream (low carb), 1 tablespoon of flour (or almond flour for low carb), salt and pepper (seasoned salt is good) and whatever other seasonings/additions you want (I used diced green onion, basil, seasoned salt, and diced ham).  Beat the egg mixture with a fork (do NOT use a blender) then pour into the prepared pan.  Bake in the oven 10 minutes, pull out and layer some kind of cheese (pepper jack or sharp cheddar is awesome) then put back in the oven about 5 minutes to melt the cheese.  The eggs will fluff up and slightly pull away from the pan.  Use a rubber spatula to loosen the omelet from the pan then gently roll the egg.  It won't really roll per se, but kind of folds over itself.  The end result is a beautiful restaurant quality omelet that looks just as good as it tastes.  Sprinkle with parsley or pour some salsa on top with a dollop of sour cream and you have a perfect breakfast.  I make this on weekends for a low carb breakfast.  After the omelet is rolled/folded, I cut it up into individual serving sizes and wrap each piece.

As written this recipe didn't come out great. It is a good start though! Next time, I will reduce the flour to 1/4 cup, line the pan with parchment paper, add toppings/spices of choice, and finally reduce cooking time to 10 minutes at 425. I think with these changes this will make breakfast faster and awesome!

This is definitely a keeper in our house. Thanks to the comments of others I was able to have a successful experience the first time out. Cut the flour in half; used half water and half milk; put the egg mixture in a parchment-lined jelly roll pan; cut the oven temperature and cooking time back; and added a layer of sauteed ingredients after it came out of the oven and before rolling (green onions, celery, green peppers, fresh mushrooms and diced ham) along with the cheese. Next time I plan to add some spinach, too. Love this recipe!

This recipe was easy, elegant and delicious.  I used only 2 T flour and added some chopped tomatoes after cooking and before rolling.  Sprinkled with a little parsley it was a hit at brunch.  I'll make this again and again!

I checked mine after 10 minutes and I'm glad I did. It was completely cooked and the edges were browned. Any longer and it would have burned! I filled mine with cheese and cooked vegis. I liked how easy and adaptable this recipe was. Most likely won't make again though. I couldn't get past the flour taste. That taste really ruined it for me.

I used a 9 x 13 metal cake pan, so I didn't have to worry about it spilling.  Worked well, next time I will definitely line the pan with parchment to aid in the rolling process.  I rolled the long side, which I recommend, it ends up longer and you get more slices that way.  It would have been easier to roll with the parchment paper lining the pan.  My guests loved it, it is very impressive.  Also, it's a great way to use up what you have.  I used corn, roasted red potatoes and pork tenderloin.  (Leftovers from the night before). Chop your add-ins small and don't use too many, you need enough egg surface or it will break when you roll it. Loved it!

I followed the recipe but used liquid eggs in place of fresh. First batch was too fluffy to roll and served right out of the pan and got raves. Second batch 1 hr later I cut back on the milk and the flour and was able to roll and got raves and request to show how to do it the next time. Lined the bottom of the pan with foil and it helped with rolling. Will be making again because of ease in serving (I got 8)many at once and those served loved it and when they tell mutual friends I will need to do it again.

My tips: parchment paper is a must. Cut the flour in half, add 1 Tbsp of Vanilla, 1/2 a package of low fat cream cheese, to the ingredients in the blender. You can add any combination of your favorite ingredients, Ham, onions etc, Bake for 15 minutes. Then sprinkle heavily with cheese. Key Tip -- use rubber gloves to roll the Omelet. Sprinkle with more cheese. I have also cut the pieces and put them in single serving containers and frozen them.

This didn't turn out at all like I had hoped, it puffed WAY up, and stuck to the pan. I thought, ok, we'll just put the cheese on top & scoop it out anyway, even though it won't roll...WRONG...what I was able to scoop was about a half inch thick, and I didn't think it tasted all that good. Darn, the recipe sounded so good, too...:(

an easier method is to lay parchment paper on a cookie sheet and the eggs roll right off. I add precooked  bacon and red pepper. Cook and add cheese at the end few minutes of cooking.

This isn't anything to write home about, although, it is a good basic recipe.  In order to truly enjoy this dish, you'd have to add other ingredients to spice it up a bit, and make it more flavorful.  It is easy to prepare, and requires nothing to have to run to the store to make, which is a plus.  Therefore, I'm not giving this recipe too low of a rating, but again, I can't give it 5 stars 'as is', as it leaves a bit to be desired.

So much easier than making individual omelets! I used 8 eggs & 1/4c flour.  I am making this for our Xmas breakfast buffet this year.

Dry and thick.  I wonder if omitting the flour would be better and maybe adding a little milk.  I just like my eggs more moist.  I will try this next time.

I've been making a very similar recipe for years.  One big difference is that I line the pan with parchment paper before I add the eggs.  Ensure you leave enough parchment paper hanging over all sides and I always line the pan with butter first so that the parchment paper sticks to nicely the pan edges and corners.  When cooked, simply use the parchment paper to roll the omelette. The omelette is hot so I use oven mitts and I ensure to shape the omelette into a nice round log at the end.  Works like a charm every time.  I would never not use parchment paper!  Seems like a no brainer to me!  Also, I add the cheese for two minutes at the end of the cooking.  Love this recipe.

I liked this omelette because it was different.  Even my picky 9 year old liked it.  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly.  My family liked it, but I thought it was a little plain.  This time I added some green onions, diced ham and a little bit of broccoli.  The flavor combination was perfect for me.  This is a great basic recipe that can be tweaked to suit just about everybody's taste!  Thanks.

The flavor is seriously lacking.  I think the flour makes this too heavy. I didn't use for rolling but left it flat and cut into squares for egg breakfast panini. it worked slick, but had no egg flavor. 425 for 20 minutes.

What a clever idea, this makes a nice change to the usual egg dishes. I used 8 eggs and 1/4 cup of flour. I used spring onions and diced ham with fresh parsley chopped up as well as the cheese, it was very tasty and easy to put together, thanks again.

I made our Omelet Roll with cheese only, as my 3 year old was going to be eating it.  I did add some paprika, garlic powder and chili powder.  The taste was wonderful.  For my husband and me only, we would add some peppers, onions, meat, etc. I used a glass 9 x 13 pan, that was generously coated with cooking spray.  I had no problems getting it out and rolled up, at all. I think next time, I would put it in a jelly roll pan so it had more room.  It did fold over on itself on the ends/corners.  I was able to straighten it out and roll it, but it was puffier on one end.  The only complaint I had, was the texture was odd to me.  Kind of chewey and sticky. Takes some getting used to, but like I said the flavor was great, and very similar to that of an omelet. I, too, loved that you could put it in the oven and work on other things while it cooked.  Yum.  Thanks for the recipe.

I added Zucchini and left over Tri Tip and green onions to mine sooo good. I did sauté my Zucchini,Tri Tip  & Onions.Also Line pan with foil, spray foil with oil. Then just take out the omelet and use foil to help you roll it. Works Perfect and less mess.

I give it three stars on taste, but 2 additional stars for coolness, ingenuity and versatility.  I adjusted the recipe to half the flour (1/4 cup) and half the time (10-12 minutes).  I sprayed a dark 9 X 13 baking pan with Pam (bottom and sides).  The mixture appeared "poofed" initially upon exiting the oven, but I poked it gently with a fork to deflate it.  I added shredded cheese only because I didn't have anything else on hand; next time I'll add other traditional omellete-related items.  It rolled perfectly and presented beautifully.  I placed it seam side down on a serving dish, draped thin strips of American cheese (cut into 1/4 inch diagonal strips) diagonally over the top to look like cheesy grill marks.  I surround it with a moat of freshly made hashbrowns and sprinkled a handful of a diced tomato over it all for color.  My "mealers" ranged in age from 3 years to 35 years.  They eat had some and there was nothing left.  My kids helped make it, which made the end result more fun and fulfilling for everyone involved.  Thanks for submittng this interesting and innovative twist to the traditional egg breakfast!

This is a great brunch recipe. I added sauted bell peppers when I added the cheese. I also used cake flour instead which made it a little fluffier. I would definately recommend this recipe.

Made this for brunch today! Used 1/4 cup flour and added a little salsa to the raw eggs. Baked at 375 used Butter Pam on parchment paper and baked 14 mins., then diced ham, two cups cheese (Taco flavor and Pepper Jack) put back in oven for 3 mins. It rolled so easy (long end) and sliced perfect. This is a dish I want to make over and over and I will for sure!!!! Thank you for this endless ingredients recipe!!

Very good.  I halved the recipe and used a scant 1/4 cup flour.  Can't wait to try with some additional ingredients or  phnz21ft's suggestion of cream cheese.

Green eggs and mushrooms? I cut the flour to 1/4 C and blended in about a cup of cut up broccoli/onion, which gave the egg its green color. Baked at 400 for about 10 minutes. Used buttered parchment in a glass pan in my rather hotter than standard oven.
Melted cheddar in a little bacon grease and spread it and a half cup of sliced mushrooms cooked in 1 tsp butter lengthwise on the baked egg mixture.
Rolled up lengthwise using the parchment for assistance. Could have used more seasoning/spices; less broccoli and more onion. Next time - and there will be a next time - I'll skip the bacon and butter and maybe even some of the cheese.

I have used this technique for over 25 + years (minus the flour) and in many restaurants during my career. Variations such as spinach, sausage, roasted red peppers are to name a few. pleasing to the eye and the tummy as well. Try lining the pan w/ either foil or parchment to solve sticking problems.

Excellent recipe, very easy to make.  This comes out of the oven very fluffy and soft and its very edible.

The taste with the original ingredients might end up being a little bland, so you can add what you like to the recipe to give it your own taste ! 

I had to bake it in my oven for about 14 minutes at 200 degrees. Used a glass bowl for baking and greased it well with olive oil on a tissue paper so there was no problem with stickiness at all.

I have made a lot of omelettes. I think it sounds fool proof and fantastic! A simple suggestion: maybe top with some salsa, or I like to make omelettes the next day after making homemade spaghetti sauce. Consider putting it on before AND after you roll the omelette up. Ummmmm Good! I am going to try this tomorrow, as I have spaghetti sauce simmering on the stove as i write. What a nice coincidence!

So good! I have made this twice now. My husband loves it, my 3 year old loves it and my neighbors loved it. The first time I added about 1/2 Tbs of garlic powder to the mixture, the second time I made it exactly like the recipe here. Both turned out great but everyone agreed the one with a little garlic was better.

This recipe was VERY easy to make and the ingredients were so basic that you don't have to make a special trip to try it.  It was good.  I added sausage and used velvetta cheese instead of cheddar.  Very simple just mix everything together and throw in the oven. I would definately make again.

I had a little trouble with this.  I used parchment paper as recommended from previous reviewer and it did not want to roll at all.  I added fresh mushrooms and just scooped out the pan.  It tasted very good but the presentation was lacking.  I will try again.

Cut cooking time in half by microwaving for 10 minutes. I also had to omit the rolling because I had to use a smaller sized pan.

Delicious! After 15 minutes in the oven I added lean and thin slices of Virginia ham, mozzarella cheese, and diced scallions. Rolling the omelet and cutting it into rolls gave it a beautiful presentation. My whole family loved it. Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this several times now and it comes out great every time.  I have made all veggie as well as meat and cheese.  I reduce the flour and oven temp as suggested in previous posts.  I have
 Even cut it in half to make a smaller roll.

I made this and there is only one thing, every oven bakes differently. The recipe says bake 20 minutes, I checked mine after about 13 minutes and it was already done. In fact, a little overdone. I wish I had checked it after 9 minutes. Other than that it was perfect! I put sausage, green onion, tomatoes and cheese in it. It was very easy to roll up too.  I'll definitely make it again and cut back on the bake time.

I just made this tonight for dinner-wow amazing! and its healthy too. we will add spinach and mushrooms to ours next time. My 8 year old son loved it. I also made Cinnamon Rolls II with this dinner, they turned out great, I just left them in the oven for a few minutes longer and they were a little hard ontop, but other than that tasted great-I used the bread machine to make the dough. Was very easy and cheap to follow! I am trying a new recipe twice a week-The boy wants this again-definatley a hit in my house!!! Thank you for dinner tonight Allrecipes.com:)

Just made this for dinner tonite. I followed the advice of the others on here, did 1/2 c milk and 1/2 c water, baked it at 400 for only TEN minutes(in a parchment paper lined cookie sheet), topped it with cheddar cheese and sauteed white onions(what I had on hand) and served it with a green salad.  My son LOVED it....and so did I.  Very tasty, much easier than a pan fried omlette, and the different toppings you could add to this are amazing. Great quick and easy meal, whether you have it for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Oh yeah, I cut the flour in half too, just used the 1/4c instead of the 1/2c it calls for. PERFECT. I WILL be making this again. And again. Thanks!!

The omelet roll was just ok.  I didn't care for the flour in it. I thought it made it heavy instead of fluffy. I'll try it again with less flour or no flour.

Yeah, this was a little disappointing.  450 degrees baked them in half the time, they set up nicely but they didn't roll up for me, even following others' suggestions.  With a half cup of flour, they were a cross b/t pancakes and eggs, and the taste wasn't there.  I suppose if you'd add onions, green pepper, ham, bacon, etc. to the cheese it would be better, but I wouldn't put so much flour in if I made it again, which I probably won't be doing.

Very good but I may use less flour next time.  I added bacon to mine and I'm anxious to try it again using more veggies.  Also, I love not having to stand at the stove. Thank you for the recipe.

I sauteed onions, garlic, yellow bell pepper and grape tomatoes--all organic. Then, using organic eggs, salt, pepper and oregano, I baked the mixture at 450 for 5 minutes since I was only making a 4-serving recipe.  I baked it on a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper sprayed with olive oil cooking spray. I then rolled from the long end after stuffing with the sauteed vegetables and cheese.

I had a lot of eggs on hand and was searching for an egg recipe. This was excellent. I read a good number of reviews first and went with cutting flour to 1/4 cup and used 1/2 cup water and 1/2 cup 2% milk. I added onion powder and about 1/2 teaspoon adobo spice mix. I cooked for 10 min in a 9 x 13 aluminum foil lined pan which I sprayed with cooking spray. Next time I will experiment with different cheeses and veggies.This was very easy to roll and I started with the longer side.This dish presents well too on a platter.

We loved it!  We like our omelette full and spicy, so I added some dry mustard and hot sauce to the egg mixture.  For the filling, I sautéed some onions and broccoli.   Before rolling I spread the veggies, then the cheese.  It was beautiful and delicious.  My husband doused his with salsa.  Great recipe!

I made this for breakfast this morning and it was fantastic.  It's nice for a Sunday morning when you have more time available for cooking.   After reading the reviews I decreased the flour to 1/4 c and used my jelly roll pan with parchment paper on it for easier rolling.   I baked it for 10 minutes and added softened onions, green peppers and the cheese.  I baked it 1 minute more to melt the cheese took out and immediately rolled it.   I used the potholder and parchment paper to roll it so I didn't burn my hands.

Very nice and easy way to prepare eggs.   I followed the recipe pretty closely and it came out well.   I used the full 1/2 cup of flour, but used half regular all purpose and half wheat flour.   I also added onion and some diced ham, but  I mixed them into the egg mixture.   It turned out well and was pretty easy to roll.

I just tried this recipe about an hour ago.  I was looking for something quick to make for breakfast and came across this recipe.    This really is a nice recipe!  I made minor adjustments.  After pouring the mixture into the baking pan, I sprinkled the top with diced onions and bell peppers to suit my taste.  Also, instead of about 20 minutes, I baked for only about 9; it cooks rather quickly.  I admit I didn't roll it, just simply sliced it into small pieces and served.  I gave this recipe 5 stars as I think it presents a wealth of options in that so much can be done with it. Even though this was my first attempt at this recipe, I was pleased and will return to it again!   Thanks for uploading this recipe!

I made this for a Saturday morning breakfast.  I added sauteed onions and red and yellow peppers to it when I added the cheese but only to one side because our granddaughter was spending the weekend with us.  So the end result was a little lopsided, but it pleased everyone.  I used my Ove-Gloves to roll it up :):)

I am arguably the WORST omelet maker....seriously, no matter how hard I try or careful I am, I never get that nice fluffy folder over omelet with the cheese and toppings all tucked inside...mine always ends up to be a scrambled egg mess.  This recipe is ingenious!  You don't get much easier and you can add whatever toppings you like, I just made a Spanish omelet roll this past weekend...Thank you Eric!

I have made this every Easter for the past 4 years. Every year I make different ones with different ingredients. I make it for 25 people. It works best if you use a jelly roll pan and line it with parchment paper(depending on the amout you are making). It rolls great!!!!!!!!

I was actually looking for a basic omelette recipe when I found this, so I didn't follow it exactly.

What I did was use the eggs, milk, and flour to make a toaster oven omelet. It turned out great, but I didn't think it quite needed all of that flour. I think about 3/4 of a tablespoon of flour per egg is a good amount, rather than the approximately 1.3 tablespoons that the recipe recommends.

Anyway, instead of making a roll, I just made a flat 2-egg omelet with Canadian  (I didn't need to add salt since the bacon had plenty) and garlic jack cheese. It was very easy to make, I just poured in the egg mix, put in the meat and cheese, shoved it into the toaster oven, and then figured out when it was done by poking it with a fork. 

Instead of using a greased pan, I used no-stick foil, so I ended up with a really healthy omelet.

Very good and simple to make.  I didn't have cheddar cheese - only mozzarella.  I mixed it in rather than putting the cheese on top.  Still delicious!

I did not have any problems getting this to roll.  It didn't stick to the pan, but I did heavily grease it after reading others' comments.  I only baked it for ten minutes, however, and it came out burnt.  I think 450 is too high.

Wonderful recipe! I used a bit less flour as others suggested. I also added crushed red pepper and sausages. I would suggest baking it for 10-12 minutes. I left it in for 15 min and one edge was a bit burnt. Would definitely make this again!

this recipe was great. I only cook it for about 12 minutes and it was done. I think 20 minutes is way too long. I also think I am going to use a bigger baking dish cause it seemed a little too thick to roll up.

This is just a great recipe!! My family loved it!! I did make a few minor modifications based on other reviews and it turned out just as I had hoped.  I decreased the flour to 1/3 cup and left it in the pan to serve. I also added about a 1/2 lb of crumbled sausage before baking and spread a little salsa on top after baking. I can see the endless possibilities of using what's on hand when making this recipe.

My first attempt at this recipe didn't work out so well.  I love the simplicity of blending the ingredients together and baking but will try adjusting a few things next time.  I used a glass baking dish, and I think the oven temp. was too high, as my eggs stuck to the bottom, even after using cooking spray. I think I'll try baking at 375 for about 15 minutes next time.   Also, I think I will try reducing the flour down to 2-3 T. since the 1/4 c. I used still seemed to taste to "floury".  I also plan to increase the amount of seasoning I use, as it was still a little bland for my taste.  I'm looking forward to trying this again, as it will be a quick and easy weekend breakfast idea, as well as very versatile.

I followed this recipe exactly and then added fresh garlic, onion, tomatoe, and fresh parmesan cheese. I baked it according to the directions and then added Monterey Jack Cheese to the top. It was wonderful. I think this recipe is a great base for a lot of different tasting dishes.

Super quick and easy. A breeze to prepare and easily customized to your tastes. I descreased the flour by about a tablespoon and placed deli sliced ham on one end before rolling. Kids and husband approved.

This recipe came out perfect.  I think the SECRET to this one is NON-STICK COOKING SPRAY.  Add your favorite ingredients and POW! Very easy to make.  I would make this again.

Very great idea! I actually made this without rolling it, and it still turned out very nicely. I also threw in a handful of crumbled easy-serve sausage, and I'm looking forward to trying it with diced ham, and other mix-ins. Very easy and tasty!

I liked this recipe, but did a few tweaks, I didn't have any all purpose flour so I uses a little less than a cup of bread flour, and made it kinda like a ham and cheese sandwich scramble, (as I forgot to grease the parchment paper) added ham, onion, tomatoes and a little bit of lettuce, seasoning each layer with a dash of salt and pepper, then baked for 15 minutes, then adding mixed cheese, put back in convection oven for about 1 minute, then turning the oven off for 4 minutes. It came out basically tasting like the omelet I usually make on the stove top but with o whole lot less clean up! I will definitely make this again, as it makes plenty of left overs for quick breakfast in the week! I served it with a couple of hash brown patties and a non-alcoholic mimosa, very tasty! Thank you for sharing this idea!

I am not sure if this is too just too much flour or what the it was just unsettling. If I do another time will use half the flour and add peppers. If the 2nd time does not work this will be a fail for me for sure.

Great recipe, but I would seriously consider adjusting your cooking time. Took me about 7 min at 450 and it was very done, firm. We tweaked it a bit, filling it with sausage, bacon and hash browns. Delish!

Just made this for lunch and it turned out amazing!  Super simple.  I halved the recipe and then added orange pepper and spinach.  The veggies were raw, so after I wrapped it all up I let it sit for about 5 minutes.  Perfect!

As written it was 4 stars but after reading other reviews it easily turned this into a 5 star recipe. Very versatile to add any toppings you like or switch up the cheese. Made for a quick and filling supper. The 450 oven was too hot though so I will turn it down next time. A well greased pan with Pam made this very easy to roll up.

It is a great recipe. However, it puffs up too much in my oven after 20 minutes. Keep an eye on it and take it out as soon as you see any sign of it rising.

I tried this recipe this morning for the wife and I.  Halved the recipe and added 2 tbs. of canned corn before blending and some basil and bacon during the rollup.  Next time I will use less flour and experiment with the fillings.  Great basic recipe that you can adjust to your taste.  Thanks!

I completely scrapped the baking directions; use cookie sheet lined with parchment paper (where parchment paper comes over the sides) - lightly spray with Pam, bake as per recipe. This is a great base recipe, you can add sautéed onions and mushrooms, diced peppers, or whatever you have handy. Also, if you sprinkle some green onions when you spread the cheese, it gives it a wonderful flavor. When you take it out of the oven, just grab ends of the parchment and roll.

Looks good. Wouldn't it be great with a sauce over it...maybe bearnaise or hollindaise...or just a cheese sauce?

this recipe was great!! as reviews suggested i  turned heat down to 425°used 1/2 milk 1/2 water and added garlic powder and stirred in green onion poured and baked for 5 min then i added sauteed bell pepper yellow onion and baby portebella mushroom and baked for 5 more min  added cheese turned off oven and let stay in oven 1 min or so till cheese melted. the great thing is i used a sillicone pan i still sprayed cus it was my first time using such a pan. Egg was to thick to roll so i folded like a reg omelet. i ate with bacon and texas toast on side . my sister made hers into a sandwich that looked super yummy! will be making again for sure. thanks for great recipe.

Tried it today for Lunch worked together with my partner who added many different sweated vegies and loads of chilie (Indonesian) made enough for 2 rolls and feel this is something you would make for lunchtime guests and also to use up any scraps you have in the fridge. We know it is not strictly an Omelet but what else would you call it and the fillings are to your taste. Excellent idea for a tasty snack midday.

It may not taste or look like a "real" omelette, but it was good. My picky family enjoyed it and I plan on making it again. I will experiment a bit with spices and toppings.

Sorry to say that our family of seven did not enjoy this recipe.  I made two versions.  One strictly according to the recipe using parchment.  I added spinach, sauteed onions and mushrooms to the second after spraying the pan with a thick layer of Pam.  The Pam coated omelet stuck to the pan a bit so I did not roll this one.  The eggs had the texture of plastic. Fortunately I served muffins with this as the omelet was not filling.  It's back to scrambled eggs for us.

Light & fluffy, but only a starter recipe. Next time we make this we'll still use the 9x13 pan. We'd used a 9x9 since we reduced the number of servings. It needs the "normal" toppings for an omelet like mushroom, pepper etc. The toppings would need to be fried first & put on after egg mixture has set some. Will make again.

This was really good! I did use a 13x9 glass baking dish and lined it with wax paper that I sprayed with cooking spray. It did stick some, but not too bad. I also precooked spinach and mushrooms and added that along with the cheese. It is a perfect cross between a crepe and an omelet. It was also cooked at around 13 minutes. I will make this again! We had it for dinner with potatoes and a few turkey sausage links. Thanks for this winner!

My husband enjoyed this recipe more than I did because I'm still not sure that I like the texture of the egg (a little too dense for me).  I followed other people's suggestions...Baked for 8 minutes until set, then added some bacon, onions, peppers, olives and mushrooms (which I had fried up earlier).  I used Feta cheese instead of Chedder.  I then baked for an additional 8 mins or so.  It was easy to roll up because I had lined my 9 x 13" pan with parchment paper. Good served with sour cream and salsa.  *(Next time I will try using less flour.)

I tried this recipe yesterday.  I loved it.  I ended up adding a bunch of chopped up veggies to go into the batter.  It worked out perfect.  When adding veggies to the recipe, the omelet was very moist.  Bake the full 20 minutes.

Wish I had read the reviews before I tried this.  I would have cut the flour in half and used a jelly roll pan instead of 9x13.  End result was thick, difficult to roll, and felt like a belly bomb.  I think I'll stick to my frittatas.

This recipe is very similar to the one that I bake.  I use parchment paper so that you don't have to scrap the sides and just spray the paper.  I also use cream cheese and ham in mine, however this is very similar.  My family loves it!!!

I wasn't crazy about the texture of this...so next time I'll reduce the amount of flour.  My husband liked it, but he'll eat anything! ;-)
It was incredibly easy.  I added chopped bell pepper and mushrooms before I rolled it up...next time I'll use ham and onions also.
My jelly roll pan was too large, so I used some of the no-stick aluminum foil to line it with, making it a little smaller than the pan, and it worked beautifully.

I definitely agree with the other reviews when saying it is too much flour. It rose very high when baking. It settled just enough for me to fold it over into half like an omelet. I cut the recipe down by half so that I wouldn't make as much and I cooked it in a glass pie pan. It took 15 mins to cook and I added sausage while cooking and chopped tomatoes when done. After folding the omelet I topped it with salsa. It actually ended up being great to eat but the recipe needed rewriting a little.

super easy recipe I've used for sometime now.  I add chopped ham, peppers and onions. Great for company brunch. I serve mine with a side of hash browned potatoes and a bid dish of salsa.  Some toast and fruit salad....Voila!  Brunch is served :-)

For those of you who complained about the flour taste, leave it out. I have been making this for 20 years and never use flour. But be sure to use the parchment paper or well greased foil.For kids I slice two thin pieces of the roll and place on a plate to form a butterfly with small strips of sweet red pepper for antennae.They think it is awesome and gobble it up.

I made this according to recipe directions except I added mushrooms, onion and chopped, cooked bacon.  It was delicious, but I think the next time I will reduce the flour to 1/4 cup and reduce the cooking time to 10 minutes.  I am also going to try it with chopped tomatoes, ham and onion.

Maybe it was because I only made half a recipe, but I just didn't like the texture, and the taste was not as good as a regular omelet or frittata.  I won't bother with this again.

This recipe was easy and quick and my whole family loved it! Even my picky 3 year old. I did cook it for less than 20 minutes, it said or until set. I used mozzarella cheese and pepperoni and called it a pizza roll. I had no trouble rolling it. I loved it.

The omelet looked awful and tasted as bad as it looked.  I started over and made traditional omelets.

This is great!  Whether one thinks it is "baked eggs" or wants to call it an omelet...it is still an easy breakfast meal....adding different things like bacon, sausage, ham, etc. just makes it better.  Thanks!

This is an absolutely awesome recipe.  I always add in mushrooms, green pepper, and ham if I have it.  It is filling and is an easy way to make an omelet.  I have used a similar recipe for years from a Taste of Home submission.  Make sure you do not over cook it, and that you use non-stick spray to coat the pan.

This recipe is 5 stars if you add sauteed veggies along with the cheese.  I sauteed 1/2 cup red bell pepper and 1/4 cup onion in butter.  I sprinkled this over egg mixture with the cheese.  My omelet roll only took 12 minutes to cook.  Sprinkle roll with parsley before serving.  Great with salsa.

I really liked this, we made ours with just ham and cheese filling b/c that is what we had on hand, but the possibilities are endless on fillings.  My husband thought it was too dry and prefers regular omelets, but I thought this was a great recipe, especially to have a nice presentation to serve at a brunch and also very easy to prepare.  The four star rating is b/c of my husband's opinion and also the trouble I had getting it out of the pan.  I think it should say that you should grease the pan very well (I used a glass pan) because it wanted to stick to the bottom after only lightly greasing it.  Great recipe, thanks!

Worked like a charm! Next time I will be sure to omit the flour. I took the advice of other reviewers and used a cookie sheet. I had to use a wide spatula to get it rolled up, but once I got the first roll it was pretty smooth sailing. I will DEFINITELY make this again! Much better than plain ol' scrambled eggs in a skillet!

We really loved this...made as stated (only used a 10x15 jelly roll pan for baking) and lowered the temp to 400.  Was perfectly cooked at 15 min.  I found it tasted more like a crepe than eggs, so maybe next time I'll reduce the flour.

This has been one of my favorite new recipes this summer.  We enjoy adding crumbled bacon or other good fillings with the cheese!  I also cut the cooking time down a bit for my oven.  Our 3-year-old loves this.  Leftovers heat up in the microwave well, too.

This is easy & an impressive breakfast treat.  I saw no reason to add the flour, omitted it, and had no problem.  I also add onions, mushrooms and peppers, sauteed before adding & rolling.

Even though I did not make this recipe with the exact proportions given in it, it turned out promising enough for me to rate it 4 stars. I used 4 eggs and reduced the amount of flour to less than 1/4 c. Tho' I used plenty of oil in my 8 X 8 pan, I still had trouble getting the omelet out of the pan. Nevertheless, the end result was good and was given a 'thumbs-up' by my egg-loving 10-yr old. After removing it from the oven, I topped it with chopped tomatoes,cilantro and cheese. Good results! This is definitely a versatile basic recipe lending itself to many enhancements. Next time I will try it exactly as mentioned and see if that makes a difference to how easily the omelet can be removed from the pan. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent.  I had difficulty rolling it, it broke in a few places but I just covered the holes with cheese and it looked fine.  I added bacon, green onions, green and red peppers and cheddar cheese to the inside of the omelet.  It was a big hit at my Mother's Day brunch.

Very good recipe.  I used 1/3 C flour. I added 4 slices of thinly sliced deli ham and 2 sliced fresh mushrooms before I put it in the oven.  It baked perfectly at 12 minutes.  I sprinkled shredded colby jack cheese when it came out.  I had to loosen the edges a bit and had to use two flipping utensils to roll it.  I had sprayed the glass pan with non stick spray so it wasn't too much trouble.  I also cut two squares of American cheese on a diagnal to make triangles and put those on top of the roll for a bit more cheese and a little decoration.  Easy and quick to make and cook.

Awesome!!!Thanks!!! I dumped about 1/4 c minced dried onion, and about 1 c of dehydrated mushrooms and about 1 tsp pepper.Otherwise I followed exactly, but I mixed it with an electric hand mixer not in a blender. I used a glass 9 x 13 pan heavily sprayed with Pam cooking spray. I do not have a hot oven but this cooked up alot quicker than 20 minutes. I think it was done in 10 -12 minutes so keep an eye till you know. It rolled up well I thought it was going to break but I was able to roll it and put on a platter it looked great!! This is now my new Christmas brunch egg dish. Next time I will try some chopped meats along with the cheese. Such a good recipe I would give it 10 stars if I could!!!Suz :>)

These were great.  I scaled down the serving to four (only needs about 15 mins) and baked the cheese into the roll itself (by accident).  I added extra cheese at the end and substituted egg beaters.  These were great and I highly recommend them.

This recipe was ok. I used 1/2 the  flour than what was asked.  I also added more salt.  My kids did not eat it, my husband thought it was ok.  I will not make this recipe again.

It's unusual to run across a new technique, but as previous reviews mention, this is a great basic recipe that lends itself to modification. Easy, fun an taste great. Can't wait to try variations, and teach my kids to make it.

I was going to give this a three because it is very bland but the idea is so cool that I will try it again and doctor it up to my liking. It was easy to roll which is good and my picky son liked it.

i'm a big fan of tamagoyaki (a sweet japanese rolled omelet) this recipe was similar, so i gave it a try.  i used all the same ingredients (i think the flour is fine, kinda crepeish & fun texture) but didn't use cheese or pepper.  instead, i added green onion, which added color and light, fresh flavor, without adding bulk.  i used an old, well buttered cookie sheet (about 11" x 13" x 1/2") and the recipe fit right in PERFECTLY.
in cooking...  i used the tamagoyaki style, of rolling as the omelet cooks, so that it doesn't unroll (too much) when you slice it.  this defeats the purpose of simplicity... but i didn't mind.  took it out, put it in, etc.  all in 20 min, without stopping the timer when the omelete was out of the oven.  i think i will try this with my tamagoyaki recipe next time...

It was my day to bring breakfast to work, so I made this & everyone loved it.  I did add sausage & bacon before rolling up. Since I needed to triple the recipe, I used different pans & found that it is definitely better to use a glass 9 x 13 pan  - the eggs turned out more fluffy & golden than those in the dark pan. Also, 20 minutes was too long to cook for my oven so I did 425 for 15min & that worked better.   I prepared the night before & arranged all the rolled omelets into a larger pan, sprinked that with a little cheese & then reheated before going to work.  It looked really nice & reheated well.  Thanks for an easy recipe!

I was afraid I wouldnt be able to roll this and make it look nice, but it was EASY AND BEAUTIFUL!  Very fluffy and tasty - I will try crumbled bacon with the cheese next time for some color and more flavor!

I'm a teenager that is very unexperienced at cooking.  I found this recipe to be very easy to make.  I used egg substitute, 1/8 cup of flour, and I added ham to it.  My family loved it!  They want me to make it every weekend for them.  They have dubbed me the new chef of the family.  Thanks!

My DH said this was one of the best breakfasts he's had in a long time.  I took the advice of a previous reviewer and placed salsa over top.  I cut serving size pieces first and then rolled each one up.  Easy to do.

What a delicious easy breakfast item! I served this on Christmas morning as written with sausage and hashbrowns on the side to my family of four and we had absolutely NO leftovers. Husband topped his with chunky salsa and loved it. This is a great basic recipe, and I am looking forward to "doctoring it up", adding crumbled bacon, onion, or green pepper, etc. Also, make sure to grease the pan well...I used the spray oil with flour added and it came out of my pan perfectly. Thanks Lori!

This is a great breakfast recipe! I made it for my wife and we both stated, "This is a winner!" We had leftovers the following morning and discovered it is even BETTER than it was originally!

Try it as leftovers -- you will NOT be disappointed.

Very easy and relatively quick.  I'm not a big egg fan, but my husband is.  He's also doing the low-carb thing, so I'm desperate for any new ways to do eggs.  I added some chopped onion and black pepper to the mix.  I also scale it down and do it in an 8 x 8 pan, so it's not proportioned well to roll.  We just sprinkle the cheese on top and cut it into squares.

This was soooo good.  I made two servings by using an 8 by 12 pan,4 eggs, 2/3 c milk, 1/8 tsp pepper, and 1/8 c flour.  Also followed another's suggestion by adding 1/8 tsp nutmeg and some spinach.  Yummy and easy! Thank you

I made this for a Mother's Day brunch...along with 3 other Allrecipes recipes.  I had never made any of them before--and they all turned out in the end.  I doubled the recipe (used 2 pans) and added diced ham and chopped bacon to this recipe and it tasted great.  But I had a strange thing happen.  When it was baking, I started to smell something burning...I opened the oven and the egg was "raised" so high in the corners of the pan that it was really close the top of the oven and a small corner of the dish burned.  I just removed that portion, covered it with cheese and rolled the omelet.  Tasted just fine...I thought I would have a problem rolling them, but both pans came out just fine.  Great recipe!

This was a fun and creative way to serve an egg dish for a brunch.  I made it with lox and chopped parsley and red onions.  I sliced it when it was cold and reheat it on the serving platter.  When I was ready to place it on the table I drizzled sour cream on top which melted into the omlette.  It was great!

I hesitate to rate it because I did change it bit. I used 8 eggs, no flour and added onions and red peppers. Got a thumbs up here. I don't believe it is as puffy as perhaps would be with the flour (from reviews), but it was flavourful. I sprayed with Pam and it did not stick at all.

Lori thank you for this recipe.  I currently have a jaw problem.  I have to eat soft and liquid foods.  I added onion, green pepper and mushrooms to the mix. I used lite salt. I used part skim mozzarella cheese instead of the cheddar.  I used 1/4 cup of flour too like another reviewer instead of 1/2 cup.  I cut it in 6 squares after I baked it then rolled it.  Very delicious.  Thank you again.

THis one was fun to do, and I made as a surprise for my boyfriend.  Was easy (except I had a little trouble with the rolling, but hey, I'm uncoordinated!)  We will definitely add peppers and meat to it next time, but this was an excellent recipe to give me ideas with!  Thanks!  Will serve again with veggies and meat.

This was very easy simple good dish.  If you have picky eaters this is the one.  You can add a lot to it if you want.  It rolled nicely and the key was to make sure to spray the pan well.

Very good. I only put in 1/4 cup flour. I added green and red pepper,ham and onion to it.  I put parchment paper in the pan and it came out nice and rolled right up.

I wish I had read the reviews before I made this.  It would have been okay except for the flour.  I think I will make it again without it.  All I could taste in every bite was flour.  Also, could have used better instructions on how to roll it up.  I gave up trying to roll it because it kept falling apart.  Next time, I will just leave it in the dish flat and slice it there.

I made this in a glass dish so it cooked in no time.  I placed slices of swiss cheese and cooked spinach with nutmeg instead of cheddar and it was really good, very filling and tasty.

A quick and easy brunch recipe.  I added thin ham slices on top of the cheese layer before rolling.  I may try crumbling cooked bacon next time.

This is great.  I use 4 eggs in a smaller pan since there are 2 of us.  Makes a great sunday breakfast.

FANTASTIC!   extremely easy too!!  I added a little crumbled bacon when I added the cheese, (or add whatever you like in an omelete), and it made it one of the tastiest, easiest omelettes I've ever had!

Add 2 egg whites ( 1/4 cp.), reduce milk to 1/2 cup, and reduce flour to 1/4 cup.
This increases protein and decreases fat and carbs. ; also adds extra volume.

This is my “GO TO” recipe when I have a house full of people. I do not roll it up though. I leave it flat and call it breakfast pizza. Kids and adults always request that I make it for  breakfast at holiday get togethers. And it’s SO EASY and delicious.

I added two more eggs and couldn’t roll the mixture after baking.  It was more like a casserole, which was fine for us. 
I also added ham cubes before baking.  Yum! I am definitely doing this again, it’s so easy and delicious!

Used a 9x9 pan and 4 eggs (2 eggs + 2 egg whites), adjusted other ingredients accordingly. Might use a little less flour next time. Used some water with the milk instead of all milk, as someone else suggested. Added some minced onion.  Cooked for a few minutes then spread some chopped Canadian bacon, green pepper, chives, and shredded cheese and finished cooking. Cooked at 440, about 15 mins.

I thought I already reviewed but can’t find. Love this with a few small tweaks. I added lots of spices like dill, Italian, garlic, per our preferences. I also left my HEAVILY pan-sprayed foil large around the edges of my cookie sheet. After cooking for about 10 minutes, I rolled the edges of foil over the fluffed up edges of egg to keep them from burning and cooked another 3-5 minutes to finish the center. Came out amazing. Also, rolled from long side to make more manageable rolls. Let it cool just a bit, then used foil to help me roll smoothly and slice. I only had a tiny bit of first one because my boys ate it all!!! You can throw anything in, like most egg dishes, just watch for higher moisture content =longer cook time. We’ve done this several times now, so quick and easy and versatile, different than just “eggs”. Can do a double batch and just halve into pans to save some time, or even do different add-ins on each half of one sheet! Sprinkle some cheese as you are rolling for extra decadence, or spread with sour cream.....,

I made this and loved how it turned out! 
Made a second one and added salsa and sprinkled cheese before I rolled it up. Added more cheese over the roll  and baked another 10 min. Or so. Was a great hit, and looked real cool when sliced!

I love this recipe! I usually throw it in the fridge after I make it for future breakfasts. I've found after you pour the mixture in the pan you can sprinkle whatever else you like in omelets; sausage, chicken, ham, tomatoes, peppers, etc. It tastes super yummy!! One of my favorite breakfast egg dishes.

Delicious & easy recipe! Made it with my niece a few times. We change our toppings according to our mood :-). Bacon and spring onions is a good topping option.  Also love feta cheese and pepperdews.

It didn't puff up for me . I followed recommended changes, half the flour and parchment paper were the only changes.  Still gets 4 stars because it still tasted great and was a big hit. Just looked like a gigantic crepe.

My kids said this tastes MUCH better than an omelette with similar ingredients. Mine came out of the oven wavy and bumpy, but once I rolled it up, you couldn't tell.

I've always had trouble rolling out omelets so when I saw this knew I had to try it out.  So much fun, looked great and so easy, I used a 1/4 jelly pan and lined with none stick foil and it was easy to roll up and looked great, love how versatile it is with adding in of your favorites.  Would be great for a company meal as you could make as large as you needed.

Good recipe,  I used a different size pan, which didn't work out very well Lol but it still taste great. Next time I'll use the recommended size pan. I also like to add sour cream to the egg mix. Not only do they come out fluffy it also adds to the flavor.

It was pretty good.  Since I was not making them to eat right out of the oven, but rather as a grab and go breakfast option in the mornings, they dried out a bit on reheat.  Next time I will cut the cook time back to accommodate this.  Also the addition of the flour just added carbs in my opinion so on my second go around I will leave out.  Nice recipe though, thanks for posting.  Endless options with different ingredients:)

I added spam tidbits instead of bacon or ham. 
Perfect for any meal...I will definitely baked this recipe again.

Very good and everybody loved it. It was easy to do and turned out just as described. I only went for about 10 minutes in the oven. I just threw whatever I had in the fridge in it that made sense.

I made it with changes suggested (cut flour in half; used half water and half 1/2 & 1/2). I had 7 eggs left in the carton, so used all 7.  I lowered the oven temp to 400 and baked for 10 minutes, then added bacon, green chilies (squeezed out the excess liquid to avoid sogginess) and shredded cheese and returned to the oven (turned it off) until the cheese melted.  I used parchment paper in a jelly roll pan (sprayed the pan and the paper with canola oil spray), which worked very well, and rolled it up on a cutting board to cut it. Served with salsa. I will use more spices next time, and possibly add black olive slices :)

Baking time should be reduce to 15 minutes and add the cheese on the last 5 minutes. I add slice cheddar cheese and the cheese puff up, over melt the cheese make a little hard to roo up at the end. But overall it was good. Also, a little extra salt.

This recipe was easy to make. I did turn the temp down after few minutes so it didn't burn. I added Mexican cheese, onions and frozen chopped spinach(thawed and dried), and crumbled bacon. I think rolling from long edge would be better for smaller servings, but I  definitely will make this again!

The photo shows all sorts of ingredients in the omelet, but the recipe only mentions the eggs, milk, flour  and cheese . It's like they forgot part of the recipe.

I have saved this recipe a while ago and decided to try it today. I really loved it and I'm so glad I made it. Since this was the fist time I followed the recipe and used only the ingredients in the video, but I will make it my own by adding different ones next time. It was delicious and you can feed a lot of people without spending a lot of time in the kitchen. I agree with another reviewer it cooked in less than 20 minutes, it was actually closer to 10 minutes. It was delicious and I'm planning to make it again for my guests. Thanks for this amazing recipe.

So easy! Who doesn't like breakfast for dinner?  Used parchment paper, 10x13 sheet, 400 degrees for 16 minutes.  Dinner and dishes done in 1 hour.

These aren't quite omelettes, but they are super tasty. They're also a million times easier than omelettes. I recommend lining your pan with parchment paper, as that will make them a cinch to roll up!

Was ok, but not great. Have made it twice now and both times I modified with some herbs and different cheeses. My last try I made it with dill, green onion and feta cheese. Will continue to change the recipe a little until it is to my liking. The pan size suggested makes a very thick egg base, which is difficult to roll and just gives you too much egg in each serving. 
Overall, was a good base recipe that I will make again with changes.

I replaced the all purpose flour with oat flour (for more nutrition), used almond milk (to cut calories), added two cloves of fresh garlic in the blender (for more flavor), after pouring into a parchment-lined pan, sprinkled finely chopped onion, spinach, mushrooms, and fresh tarragon. Added the cheese after baking. The parchment paper is the ticket for rolling. Perfect. Five stars with the changes.

Only needed half the bake time, and came out perfect. Only change I made was to use Jiffy Baking Mix because I was out of flour.

This is really tasty and you can customize it to your own tastes too. I added cooked minced onion to the raw egg mixture and baked, then rolled in shredded cheese and chopped ham to the finished egg. I too experienced the puffed up egg problem while baking the egg in the oven (someone else posted a picture of this problem). I solved this problem by placing a sheet of aluminum foil over the baked egg and gently pressing down the puffed up areas of the egg. Be sure to wear oven mitts for that task!! This is a very formal looking and impressive dish and would be perfect for a brunch gathering. I would suggest some sort of sauce or something drizzled on top of the finished roll (Hollandaise maybe) to give it more pizzazz. I just placed american cheese slices on top and put it back in the shut off (but still warm) oven.

Love this recipe! I altered mine slightly... I baked the omelet for 15 minutes ( instead of 20) @ 400 degrees.  I used a dark 13x9 inch pan and had no trouble with sticking like others did. I also added 3/4 bag of frozen veggies along with the cheddar cheese after 15 minutes of baking. Then I rolled the omelet in the same pan and put back in the oven for the remaining 5 minutes. I do agree with a few comments here in regard to the high oven temp. I watched it the whole time in the oven so it didn't burn.  I'm extremely happy how the omelet turned out...delish! :)

Definitely pour the egg mixture onto greased parchment paper to easily roll the baked omelet around the filling!! I have a recipe for an "egg roulade" that looks similar to this one, but it is much lighter, fluffier, and richer. The recipe I use calls for 2 cups of heavy cream and 8 eggs, mixed using a blender. This recipe is a good substitute if you don't have heavy cream on hand, but it has a bit of a rubbery texture. Next time I make it, I'll reduce the amount of flour and see if that helps.

Taste was great, however mine stuck to the pan so I did not have a pretty roll, even though I greased liberally with olive oil, thus the less than perfect rating.

This was just okay.  I couldn't get it to roll so we ended up scooping out the baked eggs from the pan in squares.  I reduced the flour by half and I probably should've reduced it farther - the eggs just had a weird texture that half my family didn't care for.  We won't be making this one again.  (I did try to line the baking sheet with parchment paper, but I could see all that was going to accomplish was to for the egg mixture to seep underneath the paper, meaning I'd end up with Parchment paper in the middle of my eggs.)

i tried it, followed it to the letter, but the taste of uncooked flour was too much.  
when i try it again, i'll make a rue of the flour, starting with margarine, then after cooking the flour long enough, add the milk, then add it to the blender with the eggs, salt and pepper.

This is a great basic recipe and turned out very nice. Everyone loved it. I used finely chopped yellow and orange peppers and green onion. I used shredded mozzarella and Colby Cheese and a salt free dilly mix spice just a tad!(that's what I had on hand) I served mini ciabatta rolls and mini sausage patties. Some of my guests made mini sandwiches and some ate theirs separately. I took reviewers advice and used a parchment lined jelly roll pan and sprayed the paper with pam. Next I'm making it with spinach, rumbled bacon, green onion different cheeses. THANK YOU FOR THE RECIPE!!! Oh and again due to reviews I baked at 400 for only 10 minutes it was perfect!

LOVED IT!!! Thank you for sharing it. I just added some veggies (spinich, onion, tomatoes & bell. I sautéd them first in a skillet) to eat & 2 cups of cheese. I like it cheesy :) Also made with just what was in the recipe for my kids & girlfriend & they loved it. Although it didn't look too pretty (I'll have to practice making it look prettier haha). I will be making this again. Deffinetly a keeper! Thanks for the recipe! ... Just noticed someone said its not an omlet because it's not made a certain way. Who cares, it tasted great!.... Tim & family

Thanks for sharing this recipe. It was easy to make.  I did add ham , mushrooms, onions, & zucchini.
Rolled easy but not like picture. Think it had too much in it. Baked in 9 x 13 cake pan but will try cookie sheet next time.   Excellent recipe!  It's a keeper.

Besides the bland taste, I really enjoyed it. I did cut the amount of flour in half.

Easy recipe but definitely needs more than just cheese.  Found it a little bland so next time I'm thinking I'll add in some extras.

We love this recipe. I do heat the pan in the oven first. I also process all the ingredients in the blender to make sure it's smooth and fluffy. I tried it with less flour, but we like it just as written. My 7 year old requests rolled egg nearly every weekend.

I thought this would be a great quick dinner since my kids love omelets.  Disappointed.  The flour made the omelet too dense and tasteless.  I was going to delete the recipe from my box, but have decided to use advice from other reviewers and try it again.

I have made this a number of times. Use parchment paper that is buttered to spread the eggs mixture onto. Today it had fresh mushrooms, ham, peppers and onion that was sauted for a bit. Grated some really good Pineland Farm cheddar. Leftovers for my husbands lunch tomorrow.

I have made this a few times now and I change things up with it, it is easy and a great way to feed a lot of people with a little amount, 6 eggs goes a long way.  Really enjoy this recipe.

Sorry I didn't like the dense texture the base became after the flour/milk settled. I added ham and spinach.  I needed the full 20 minutes this way, also.

I made the Omelet Roll according to the directions but added some cut up and sauteed deli ham. My husband said it didn't taste like an omelet because of the flour so he was disappointed. My daughter said the flavor reminded her a bit of a dutch baby.  She suggested sprinkling powdered sugar on it. Ha...we did and it was amazing!!! Tasted like a breadless Monte Cristo! 60 minutes was too long for it to cook so I am glad I checked on it early. I will make it again for company...with the powdered sugar and I know it will be a huge hit!  Try it if you like Monte Cristos!

This was good, just not spectacular.  Mine came out perfectly from the pan ..turned to the oven for 3 minutes.  Once I ran my spatula around the edges, the bottom pulled up super easily and was simple to roll up.  We liked the texture the flour gave the eggs.

Super yummy!  And if you have kids....this is perfect.  20 minutes is too long to bake it....bake for 15 minutes instead, and make sure to use plenty of cooking spray.  I added chopped up, cooked bacon when I added the cheese, but of course you can add anything you want! ;)

I don't normally rate a recipe before I make it. However, this one; can't believe I hadn't thought of this before! I love to make omelets for breakfast, however I always wind up eating last and by then everyone else is done and most times I eat alone :(
Not anymore, this is going to be great. Next weekend, oven omelet it will be....and as others have said, the combo's are endless. 
Great week night quick dinner using up leftovers too.
thanks for sharing

Tried this today.  Guys liked it.  I used Baby Swiss cheese.  Liked like a giraffe coat when I took it out of oven.  Thought it had too much flour in it?  I need to read other reviews.  Best thing?  It's EASY to do!  Will try it again .

Halved the recipe for my husband and I.   Decided to put some sprinkles of onion powder, dry mustard, garlic powder.  Also misread recipe and added the cheese to the liquid ingredients.  It turned out great!   I also sprinkled cheese when I pulled it out of oven.   And the cookie sheet/parchment paper that another reviewer mentioned worked wonderfully.  Very easy to roll up.  Next time might add some chopped broccoli.

Mmmm.  I doubled the recipe and baked it in two pans.  I thought I had done something wrong when it puffed up in the oven, but when the cheese was added, it fell and rolled up perfectly.  The family enjoyed it for a weeknight supper, served with some ham and whole wheat carrot-raisin muffins (from this site).

This was really good, but I can only give it a 4 because it was a little bland. I tasted a small bit before rolling it & decided it needed a little something more, so chopped up some onion & green pepper and added it on top with the cheese then put it back in the oven for a few minutes. Took it out, rolled it up and it tasted great! With the added veggies it was definitely a 5 star and I will definitely be making this again with all kinds of substitutions...just like an omelet the possibilities are endless and you can make it to suit your personal tastes.

It is okay, I added mushrooms, onions, and used monteray jack cheese as I was out of cheddar.  It needs some zip.  Will probably not try this again.

This did not work for me! I could not roll it up, and I buttered the pan as instructed. We ended up eating it in squares, and it tasted to me just like regular eggs... won't try again!

I'm sorry to say, this did not work well for me at all.  The taste was ok, but on the bland side.  My egg-guy didn't quite like the texture, so he didn't finish his.  I also had trouble rolling the omelet as it was sticking to the pan even though I sprayed it quite liberally.  I will not be trying this again.

I wasn't very happy with this.  I'm not talented enough to do the "roll" part, and the cheese separated from the rest of the ingredients.

This was not at all tasty.  I think too much flour.  It was very dry and stuck to my pan.  I also wonder if the cooking time is a bit too long.  I may try again with less flour and add bacon or sausage to give some added flavor
