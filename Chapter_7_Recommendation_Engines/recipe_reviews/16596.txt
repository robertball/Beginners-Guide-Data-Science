I am not welcome at my husband's family functions UNLESS I bring this salad. Tried it for a Thanksgiving dinner a few years ago and it was a HUGE hit. There is significant prep involved but I now use a mini-chopper which helps cut donwn on the chopping time. I do use a little less cornbread than what it calls for to make the cornbread layers a little thinner. I think this is an adaptable recipe -- I've used red peppers if I don't have enough green green onions if I don't have enough regular onions. The only non-negotiables are the sweet pickles and the bacon. This is a standard in my repetoire now!

This is a great recipe for church and family dinners.  It is very pretty when prepared in a clear glass bowl.

My family and I did not care for this recipe. Other recipes I have tried like this also had some pinto beans and lots of other ingredients. This recipe needs alot of help so you can taste more than corn bread and onions. Its a lot of work for not much taste.

When I first read this recipe I thought it sounded a little strange but we love corn bread and this salad was so good.  My family just loved it.  You just have to try it.

I have made this recipe 4 times now and every time it has been a huge success.  I make my own cornbread recipe and just put it in a 9x13 pan as I find this just as fast and probably wouldn't always have the mix in the house.  Even the kids loved it.  It is so different from the usual salad.

After fixing this for a Ladies' Luncheon everyone asked me for this recipe! I think that the sweet pickles and juice are the secret to this dish. I use real bacon pieces instead of cooking bacon and just mix all ingredients together in a bowl. It is just as good and cuts the prep time!

The ruler I use for the success of a recipe is "how many copies of this recipe do people want?" This recipe was a total success. At least four people at the dinner asked for it. I used green/orange bell pepper (for added color)and made the corn bread in a cast iron skillet in the oven (added crispness). AWSOME. Thanks Amy!

This was ok. I brought it to a family reunion and people liked it but I personally didn't care for it all that much. Just a little too dry and bland. Maybe as one reviewer did I should have used less cornbread. It's different though and pretty.

Not a bad variation if you really like onions. It is simpler than the Cornbread Salad 1 recipe (which I still prefer) for more colorful presentation consider layters of chopped lettuce celery black olive chopped cooked egg whites. Roasted peppers (yellow or orange make a nice addition) as do a few roasted chipotle or jalapeno peppers.

This recipe sounded so different that I just had to try it and can honestly say that I am glad that I did! Very unique and tastey salad. Will make again for sure.

This was edible but why not just eat the cornbread without the extra calories? Such a weird mixture of flavors. It must be a regional thing. My husband and I are from the Mid-Atlantic and neither one of us liked this.

I liked this recipe-should have taken a photo of the layered bowl that I had it in before digging in though. I liked the crunchiness of the veggies.

I make this but my aunt made it with ranch dressing mayo and mustard so that's how I make it too. Instead of it all being mayo it's more of a ranch and mayo blend with around 1/3 to 1/2 a cup of mustard. Also put radishes in ours. Good stuff no matter what!

Sounds strange but soo yummy!! I first discovered this in a woman's magazine & then came here so I don't have 1 003 pages ripped from a magazine in various folders. When I first read the recipe I thought how bizarre but the reviews were good & I like all the ingredients so I gave it a whirl. I've made this numerous times & it's always a big hit. It's just a wonderful blend of so many fabulous flavors at once. To cut down on the mess I bake the bacon for 20 min. at 350. Bake the cornbread leave it cool. I Chop everything the night before & throw together the morning of.
