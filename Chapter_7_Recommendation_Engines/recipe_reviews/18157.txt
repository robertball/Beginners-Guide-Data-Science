These are very simple. I scooped these with a small ice cream scoop but after scooping it's important to roll with hands to get that "crinkle" look.

I made these with Splenda instead of sugar...FABULOUS! They were a little more cakey than ginger snaps this way but a big hit nonetheless.

Crisp on the outside chewy on the inside! I sprinkled a bit of sugar over my cookies prior to baking. Very tender and delicious cookie!

These came out great, I used lard for the shortening and they are came out with a crispy exterior and slightly chewy interior, plenty of rise and a beautiful color following their time. A light sprinkle of sugar on top wouldn't be bad, but they're adequately sweet without.

Best cookies ever! Was hesitant to use 4 egg yolks but it was totally worth it. Didn't have butter so used Imperial instead and dipped the tops in sugar sprinkles before baking. Crunchy on the edges chewy in the middle. Perfect!

Very interesting cookie! Light. Crunchy. I used all butter and they came out great. Rolled some in cinnamon sugar. Nice!
