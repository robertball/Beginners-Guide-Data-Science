I made these super fun pancakes for my three littles this morning they tasted great and the kids kept saying " are we eating cake for breakfast mama" everyone loved them! The only complaint I have is the icing turned blue because of the sprinkles and didn't look as appatizing as I would have liked but still delish.... I would suggest making the icing and then sprinkling sprinkles on top- although I did run  out of my regular colored sprinkles that I used inside the pancake batter and used dot sprinkles in the icing so that could have been the problem. So I wouldn't use the little round sprinkles inside or in the icing

I only made the pancakes, not the sauce, so can only review pancakes-but they were great! Made them exactly as recipe calls for. Sweet but not overly sweet. Kids loved them obviously. I used 1/4 cup for pouring batter and got 8 pancakes out of that. Great birthday breakfast treat.

My daughter is all about rainbows, unicorns, puffy hearts and all the sparkly things so I thought this would be the perfect recipe for her. Initially, I doubled the recipe and made the recipe as written subbing gluten free flour for all purpose. After letting the batter stand it was quite runny, I tried to make 2 pancakes that were too thin so I added an additional half cup of flour (1/4 cup for a single batch). This made the pancake batter perfect. After reading the reviews I decided to whip the heavy cream and make whip cream, knowing it would melt all over the pancakes.  I folded in the sprinkles before serving to help keeping the color from running that sometimes happens. Even my kids said that the whipped cream was too sweet. These are ok for every now and then but the pancake was just ok, nothing special and as mentioned the whipped cream was too sweet and the sugar needs cut way back.

Okay the pancakes where good.. basic recipe and almost identical to the one i use.
The sauce wasn't good..my 4 year old dipped her finger in it and said no to it..so we just used syrup.
Added chocolate chips as per my girls request. I do sprinkle pancakes for birthdays at home here.. so this ended up being just that pretty much. Pancakes are good I would suggest though tasting sauce before drizzling over...if I do some thing like this again I'll try a cream cheese type drizzle.
None the less they are fun,  and kids will like the colours.
