This was my very FIRST pie!  It was easy to make (even for a newbie) and it is delicious!  This is a VERY sweet apple pie!

I loved that the filling was made from scratch.

Like the previous reviewer, I didn't have any almond extract, so I used vanilla extract.  The next time I make this recipe (and you better believe there will be a next time) I will sprinkle the almonds over the filling instead of mixing them in - cutting down on some of the crunch.  

HAPPY PI DAY!  Thanks for the recipe, this one is a keeper!

Tasted great and easy to make. I used red delicious apples and had a flood of liquid at the bottom of my pie even with a lattice top for venting.

Really quick and easy to throw together with pantry ingredients! :) I had to substitute vanilla for the almond extract as I was out, but was still delicious!
