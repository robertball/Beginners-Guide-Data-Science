These turned out yummy! I followed the advice of a previous reviewers who suggested you leave the nuts in the syrup a minute or two longer and not bother with the slotted spoon; just dump the whole batch of nuts onto the parchment paper lined baking sheet. Cool slightly, separate the nuts a bit and put them into a plastic ziploc bag containing the 1 cup of turbinado sugar, 1 tsp sea salt, 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp cayenne. Of course you can adjust the amounts to taste depending on the sweet-salty-spicy ratio you prefer. Shake them up well to coat and pour them onto a fresh piece of parchment on the baking sheet. Separate any clumps and let cool. Quick, easy and tasty!

Loved these almonds.  I decreased the temperature to 325 and roasted the almonds a few minutes longer.  I also used twice as much almonds (4 cups) to the same amount of honey because I noticed there was a lot of honey left over.  It worked great.  I also added cinnamon and 1/4 teas clove.  kicked it up a notch!

After buying honey cinnamon almonds at a street faire, I decided I wanted to try & make my own. I found this recipe to be the closest to the ones I bought & they turned out great. My husband says he even liked these better! The only changes I made was to use 3 C almonds rather than 2 & I added about 1 T cinnamon to the sugar. Perfect for snacking!

I bought some premium nut mix at a large wholesale club.  It was unsalted.  So I used this to spruce it up.  Easy to make, however I would caution that instead of using a slotted spoon to fish out the nuts, dump the whole thing on the parchment, then while after cooling slightly but still warm dump it in the plastic bag with the sugar, then back to the cookie sheet lines with fresh parchment.  That way you can break up any big clumps and sprinkle it lightly with sea salt while it cools.  That makes it 5 stars and easier to make as you are not fishing around for the nuts that way.

I used pecans for this and they came out absolutely FANTASTIC! I measured out 2 cups and the amount of honey mixture was almost perfect. I only had a little  bit left over since pecans are bigger than almonds. I didn't roast the nuts, though, but I will next time. My pecans ended up slightly soggy. Maybe I just didn't give them enough time to cool down before I tossed them in the sugar. Oh well. They were still addicting and I will definitely make them again!!!!

Used a vegan shortening for the butter and splenda mixed with 3 packets of truvia sweetener & sea salt for coating. I left half the batch of almonds in the honey mixture for an additional 3-4 minutes, and they turned out so much better than the first half. Following the review, I dumped the mixture onto parchment, slightly cooled, and then tossed with the sugar mixture. Excellent!

These are amazing. They are easy to make, and I added some cinnamon to the sugar to make them more delicious! I gave them to all my co-workers at our annual Christmas party, packaged in small holiday gift bags, and one person said they tasted like the ones from the mall. I've already made 2 batches in one week and two more tonight for Christmas. Thanks!!

These taste great! I did use almost 4 cups of almonds because there was a lot of honey.  You really need to work fast with this recipe. When I first did it, the honey dried on the nuts before I had a chance to coat them because I had so much to do.  Now I just cut the recipe in half so the honey doesn't dry before I have a chance to coat them all with sugar.  The Parchment paper and ziploc bag idea work GREAT!

My son is wheat, dairy, and soy-free, so finding delicious recipes that provide him nutrients can be challenging.  He won't eat almonds plain, so I thought I would give this a try...  and he LOVED them!!!  I substituted Spectrum vegetable shortening to replace the butter.  I also added a touch of course salt to the sugar and spice mix.  Other than that I followed the recipe to the tee, and it was amazing!  My whole family devoured them.  I will definitely be making these often in the future.

I think what really made these was putting a bit of sea salt in with the turbinado sugar before shaking them in.  That bit of saltiness really brings out the flavours.  Delicious!

It's a pretty good recipe. Easily able to modify. I would cut the honey mixture down by 30% though.

OMG! Loved this recipe for raw almonds. I too used 3 Cups of nuts, and simmered them closer to 4 minutes in the honey mixture. I tossed with 1/2 c. white sugar, and 1/2 cup Turbinado, and added a heaping tsp of Cinnamon with 1/2 tsp. salt. YUM! Great gift idea for xmas with fancy little bag!

Good, easy to follow directions. They are similiar to what I've seen sold at various markets. The sugar adds a significant crunchiness... next time may try a super-fine sugar & cinnamon mixture.

Definitely a believer in the slotted spoon method - otherwise, the nuts turn out too wet. Let the almonds cool until they are a little hard to scrape off the parchment before adding to sugar mix. I used 3 cups almonds. Added 1/4 cup regular granulated sugar, 1/2-1/4 tsp cayenne, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp salt - as others have suggested. In my best batch, I used orange blossom honey - excellent spin! Enjoy!

I had an almost-full container of roasted almonds left over from another recipe and didn't want them to go to waste. This recipe was perfect! I took the advice of other reviewers and after letting the almonds cool a bit on a foil lined cookie sheet, I spooned them into a gallon Ziploc bag and shook them up with the sugar, a bit of salt, and some cinnamon. After, I poured it all back out onto a freshly lined cookie sheet and separated them, then let them cool completely. These were so delicious, my father and brothers ate them all before they could make it to the Thanksgiving table! They said they tasted gourmet! :)

Bought some whole almonds the other day and found this recipe.  Made them today, they were pretty good.  I added a dash of cayenne pepper.  They still need something, but were delicious.

Didn't like the texture of the coarse sugar.  It stuck together once stored (after it was totally cool.)  Wouldn't make this again.

I wish the almonds would have gone in the oven, it didn't state that and they would have been crisper. I will decide more after they sit awhile. Oh now I see the foot note.

I have made this recipe for years but I use 1/4 cup honey and 1 Tablespoon butter.  The almonds are great and everyone loves them. I follow the rest of the recipe except maybe cook the almonds in the honey butter mixture a little more than 2 minutes.  Don't bother with the slotted spoon, just pour on parchment paper, cool slightly and sprinkle the sugar and stir to coat.

Just made a batch of these thinking I would serve them at Christmas, but I think we'll have to make another because these will be long gone by then. Very good! I added a tsp of cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp cayenne like some suggested and really liked the slight kick in the aftertaste.

I've made these during the Holiday for a few years now. The honey mixture coats 2 cups almonds *and* 2 cups pecans.  
I put  Chinese Five Spice into the turbinado sugar. 1-2 teaspoons of spice in 1 cup sugar covers 2  cups nuts.

for people who think the recipe is sticky or gummy, the key is to spread out the nuts on the pan. This is an important step!. If they clump together, they won't dry, and will be sticky
