My favorite recipe for baked oatmeal. This recipe is all over the internet and I'm happy that someone submitted it here. It reminds me of a healthy oatmeal cookie. You can use your judgment for adding additional ingredients such as nuts, shredded coconut, raisins, or chocolate chips and usually 1 cup of any or a combination is what is called for. If I add additional ingredients that are sweet I cut back the sugar, just my preference and what I like. I find that patting the ingredients down in the pan with a fork helps it stay to together. It's delicate but you will be able to pick up a slice once cooled. It's great crumbled into a bowl of milk too.

I made this in a muffin tin and they turned out great! I reduced the cook time to 15 minutes and that was perfect.

This dish did not come out crispy as the title of the recipe states.  When I cut it to try it, everything but the shell fell apart.  I was really hoping I had found a crispy oatmeal recipe but it doesn't seem to have happened.  Any suggestions.

Make another baked oatmeal recipe from this site, but was cooking for a child with a milk allergy one time, so I searched for an alternate- this fit the bill nicely. Have since combined the recipes a bit to sub applesauce for some of the oil and like it even better. Usually add raisins- kids really like it & it's become a go-to breakfast for us at camp.

Only change I made was using applesauce instead of oil. I wasn't a fan of the texture at all. Very dry but yet never got crispy even though I cooked it 26 minutes. I actually added almond milk to it to be able to eat it. Maybe if I cooked it longer it would turn into a granola of sorts; not sure. I won't make this again.
I would definitely suggest adding fruit to give it some kind of flavor.

This recipe is pretty plain on its own, but a great base to start with once you start adding your own extras. I had some strawberries and blueberries on hand that I threw in,  but I didn't want to use so much oil so I subbed about 1/3 c greek yogurt instead. The taste was good and with yogurt or milk (almond or soy would be great) this could be a breakfast staple. I think next time I try this I will use mashed bananas instead of the oil to make these sweet enough to stand alone.

This is our favorite baked oatmeal recipe.  We use coconut oil and add all kinds of things.  For a treat I add coconut and chocolate chips (think almond joy) with slivered almonds.  But dried fruit works wonderfully as  nuts nuts or other healthy add ins .  I figure the more the better, and the kids don't need to know.  :)  A double batch makes a healthy 9x13.  Don't expect this to be granola  style crunchy.

I followed directions precisely but they never got hard in the oven.  When I went to take them out of the pan, they fell into pieces.  Any suggestions welcomed b/c Iike the flavor of them.

This recipe had quite a bit of oil and it could strongly be tasted. It wasnt very sweet and almost bland. I added fresh walnuts and milk to some I warmed up. That sort of helped. I suppose this is an alternative to high sugar recipes. The calories are also quite high though.
