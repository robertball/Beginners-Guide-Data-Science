I read all 100 plus reviews and the main thing I came up with was that chilling the dough for an hour helps. I also used a food processor to cut in the butter which I used instead of shortening. I didnt have to use as much liquid as stated. I added a little bit at a time. After chilling the dough still seemed quite soft and I thought it was goin to be hard to work with but it wasn't. My aunt (walking cookbook and great pastry maker) has tried for years to bring my pastry up from just passable and failed. After eating a quiche made with this my dad said I'll tell Aunty Ellen you've finally made it. Thanks

The most delicious, light, flaky pastry I have ever made for my pies - and that's saying something!  I made it with butter, as usual, and YUM!  For the flakiest pastry, stop cutting in the shortening when it is about the size of a pea, no finer.  People who say the recipe didn't work for them, please remember that there are many variables when adding liquid to flour:  eggs aren't all the same size, and the humidity of the day will affect how much of the liquid mixture the flour will need.  Cut in the liquid a bit at a time, be patient, and when the dough comes together, just stop.

This is the REAL thing-I should know I've been making pies for almost 40 years.  I use a food processor for 'cutting' the shortening in-then mix in the liquid by hand-you have better control that way-and you won't overmix and make the crust tough.....  The results are spectacular-flaky, tender and easy to roll-even for the beginner.  Do agree with other reviewers-refrigerating the dough an hour or more always makes it easier to roll.

I confess... For years I have bought the frozed pie crusts at the stores because of a few fail attempts. If it had a top crust, I didn't make it. And I love to bake and love a challenge, so why I did this for so long I cannot say. 
So I used this wonderful site and all of your tips, and with this recipe I made an amazing crust. Could not have turned out better. Here are the tips I followed: 
1. Chill the bowl and the fat. 2. Do not "over-cut" the fat into the flour mix. You want some lumps-they make it flakey. 3.Chill the dough again while you make your filling. 4. MOST HELPFUL FOR ME: Roll the dough out ONCE and do so in between two sheets of wax paper. Remove one sheet and line up on pie plate, push into place and remove second sheet. 
Do not be afraid of pie crust like I was for way too long. These tips really ease the process and give wonderful results. No more tough dough stuck to the counters!

If you have ever had trouble with pie crust this recipe is for you! I used butter flavored Crisco and had no trouble at all.  I chilled the dough and rolled it between two pieced of wax paper and it came out beautifully.  I would definitely use this recipe again and again!

While I do love lard or butter in pie crusts, I used none of either. After all, I chose a shortening pie crust recipe and thought it only fair to the recipe and its submitter to prepare it as written. And it was perfect. This crust is SO tender and flaky!  Heck, it flakes as you CUT it it's so flaky! Simply a beautiful crust and if  basic pie crust techniques are followed you will have no problems. This will be one of those rare pie crusts where none is left behind on the plate!

This is THE recipe for pie crust!!!! I have made this dozens of times since finding it and each time I get PERFECT pie crust!!! For those who are having trouble with this recipe: Measure carefully, Add liquids SLOWLY and only enough to form a ball at the most. For those who are throwing the leftover pie crust away: Lay out flat on cookie sheet, spray with cooking spray, and sprinkle with cinnamon sugar, cut into bars or squares and bake at same temp as recipe till golden. My dad calls these "pie-crust cookies" and accuses me of trying to make him fat!!!

I have had wonderful results with this recipe.  Over the last few months I have made a couple of additions though. Add about 2 tablespoons of sugar and 1 tsp of cinnamon to the flour along with the salt.  Increase the water to 5 1/2 tbsp.  Then, after baking, just sprinle some granulated white sugar on top after brushing with an egg white.  Awesome results!!!  Even for the recreational baker!

I use lard (1 cup only) and make sure it is well chilled before using....I use my food processor and it comes together in a perfect ball which I can use right away....the trick to this crust is you want it chilled (not cold) but room temp. dough will give you fits. I get 3 crusts out of this recipe and it freezes beautifully for later use.  This one is truly a "no brainer"...thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

I am not sure what I did wrong with this recipe, but it didn't come out very good at all! I followed it exactly as written, except that I substituted half of the shortening with butter. I also needed to add one extra tablespoon of water to get the dough to come together. I was making it for a chicken pot pie, so I stuck the dough in the fridge while I cooked up the rest of the ingredients. There was no problem rolling out the dough. It looked really pretty and for a moment I had high hopes for it. But when it came out of the oven, the bottom crust was all soggy and doughy. The top crust was nice and crisp, though I have to say that the flavor was completely unremarkable. I was hoping for something buttery and flaky. Instead it tasted like baked homemade play dough. I was so disappointed after all that work to make a chicken pot pie from scratch! At dinner time everyone ended up picking around the crust and only eating the chicken and vegetables. Even my dog wouldn't eat the crust, so it all ended up in the trash bin. I'm sorry but I definitely will not be making this again!

Very good recipe. I used it to make a double crust pie and it came together very nicely and tasted great too. I rolled it out between two sheets of waxed paper so that it wouldn't stick to anything and I didn't have to throw flour all over my counter. I found the cutting in process to be much easier using two forks. And for anyone who, like me, may not be very experienced with shortening, I found out that your shortening should be chilled to be cut in, but doesn't need to be solid.

I made this yesterday for an apple pie contest and won 1st place.  The judges commented on how light and flaky the crust was.  I followed the directions, and also took the advice to chill the dough.  It worked out perfectly and I will never try another dough recipe.  Yum!

I've been using this recipe for over 25 years, yields a flaky light crust.  To sweeten just a bit I add 2 tsps sugar except if I'm making a meat pie, then I use it as is.  Absolutely the best recipe!

I can make this in my sleep!  I worked selling homemade pies at a market for 4 summers and this was my secret weapon.  864 pies in a span of 6 months sold can't be wrong!  It has been a little kitchen temperature sensitive so if it doesn't turn out right the first time, give it another go in a warmer kitchen.

This is the best pie crust, and really easy to make. I also added some cinnamon & sugar to the flour mix, to add a bit of sweetness! Yum! I always make this with Grandma's Apple Pie you can also find on this site.

My mom first used this as a bride in 1940. I have used it since 1968. Now my kids and grands use it also. Fool proof and if you mess up just roll it over again.  It comes out light and flakey every time.

This recipe produced the best, flakiest pie crust I have ever made, and I've made a lot of pie crusts!  I did use butter instead of shortening because I don't like shortening.  The butter was hard cold (nearly frozen) and I only cut it in until the size of peas.

This has been my favorite pie crust recipe for years but I now make it with egg substitute - 1/4 cup - instead of the egg.  It cuts about 75 calories and over 200mg cholesterol from the crust.  It works perfectly.

Our family has used this recipe for years and with good reason!  Dependable, easy to work with and TASTY!!  We always used cider vinegar though, but it doesn't seem to matter.  I always add a scoche more water (1/2 tbs.) and always refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using.

OK. I was really nervous before Thanksgiving because I had to bring a pie to my boyfriends family get together...His 82 year old grandmother, acording to him makes the world's best pie crust.  Not to be outdone(or embaressed)...I began hunting for the ultimate pie crust recipe and began making and taking pies to work two weeks before the event so my co-workers could help me find the best recipe/techniques so that I could measure up to the pressure.  At work everyone agreed that this recipes was a winner.  So when the big came I asked Nan to tell me what she thought of this recipe and she said "Tami I think you better hold on to this recipe."  Hooray!!!  I did however make several minor changes.  First, I added 1 T. sugar, I mixed the flour and shortening with a hand mixer, I used ice water and I refrigerated the dough for 30 minutes before rolling it out between two sheets of wax lightly floured wax paper.  I also got three single crusts instead of two.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!

Perfect! I used all butter instead of shortening, chilled, and cut into the flour mixture. I also added 2 tsp. of sugar to the dough mixture for a little sweetness. I slowly added ice cold water, a little at a time, mixed into the dough until it came together nicely. The chilling of the dough really helped! After I chilled the dough, about an hour, I rolled it between two pieces of wax paper with no problems.  The dough was soft and real easy to roll out-even for a beginner like myself.  The results were a wonderfully-flaky and tender crust. The crust baked up nicely and formed a pretty light golden color. The crust tastes light and just absolutely delicious!  It was simply a beautiful crust and I was impressed with myself. This will be one of those pie crust recipes I don’t want to lose! I used this crust for, “Perfect Pumpkin Pie,” also from this website. A perfect pie crust that I plan on using again and again!

What an awesome pie crust. I always use pie crust to make the shell because I have to - I never eat the crust. I tried this one and now I know when I make this recipe I won't have to appear finicky every again. It was easy to make, easy to roll out and easy to eat! Thank you for sharing!

I was a little irritated when I realized I had to make my pie crust by hand, as it's usually so quick to do in a food processor, but I'm in the middle of moving and it was packed. HOWEVER, this was so simple! And the results were amazing! I ran a little short on the shortening, so I subbed in lard for 1/3 of it. I've had this thing of lard in my pantry for far too long--my mom swore it made the best pie crust, but I don't make many pies... and now I was able to use it. Blabbering but Wow this was so easy, so flaky, so tender... I think I may have a new go-to recipe! Used as the pastry for Mrs. Siggs Pumpkin Pie. I am so proud of this pie!!--Update 1/30: Used crust recipe to make savory pop tarts (egg, bacon, cheese). Worked like a charm!

This is the first crust I ever made, and I must say it turned out delicious!  I was very intimidated about making my own crust - but this wasn't hard to make at all.  The only change I made was to use butter instead of shortening.  It came out wonderful.

For the first time in my life I actually had a pie crust turn out without being a soggy mess. I removed one star because it's rather tasteless. I'm not really sure how to fix that.

Wow!  This recipe is excellent.  The texture was great to work with and although I wasn't really sure what to make of the vinegar I'm glad that I didn't chicken out because otherwise I would have missed out on this great discovery.  It was flaky and delicious.  Thank you Felicia.

Really good texture.  For dessert pie try less salt and a little sugar.  Perfect as is for a pot pie crust or quiche.

I would give this a five out of five, but the crust was incredibly crumbly and hard to work with. However, I just added some more water and flour until it got to the right consistency. The crust turned out beautifully after that.

I tried this crust for the first time, and made one HUGE mistake. After a 1/2 hour conversation with my grandmother on how to "cut in" shortening, I didn't knead the dough before I used it. Instead, it sat in my fridge overnight to set as loose granules. The end result: too crumbly. What a mess! Four tries to get it into the dish. This wasn't the fault of the recipe. Make sure you add water until you get a ball that has the consitency of playdough. Great tasting crust! A word of advice: get someone to show you how to roll dough, don't try it alone on your first go.

I finally got a pie crust that "worked" and also tasted good. After chilling for 30 min this rolled out nicely and didn't stick to the counter (light flour dusting). I made half the recipe and ended up with a 9" crust and a 5" tart shell. It wasn't as flaky as I would have liked but I used butter so that may be why and it was humid so I think that lent to it being a little softer when served.

This was my first pie crust, and hallelujah, I'm so glad I did some researching.  This recipe rocked and turned out perfectly.  (Well, the first time didnt, because I didnt have the wisdom to know how much water was enough... and added too little, making a sand crust, LOL)  

I tried it in the food processor and couldnt get it to work right, so I actually had better luck with the pastry blender... had no trouble at all rolling it out, and made a beautiful lattice with it.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was my first pie crust ever, so some of this is probably my fault.  I had a few issues with rolling it out/sticking, and then it broke apart on me a bit.  I managed to tack on some dough-bandages.  The taste was a bit too much like shortening, so next time I may use 1/2 butter and shortening, or all butter.
Over all, I would recommend this for us poor novice bakers.

Good, but I'll save five stars for another attempt.  It is just a little bit flavorless - I used regular shortening this time and will try with butter or butter flavored shortening next time.  I rolled mine out, cut circles and placed them on the outside/upside down side of muffin tins to make shallow tart shells - I was able to make 24 shells plus have the pie scraps for cinnamon/sugar treats! (Note to those of you who say you used butter flavored shortening and it was too wet - that shortening has a higher moisture content than no-flavor, so you need to use less water.)

In the past I always had trouble with my pie crust coming out tough and dense. This recipe is great. My pie crust came out light and flakey the first time. This is the only pie crust recipe I will use in the future. Thanks for a great recipe!

I found a keeper!!  Still can't believe how good this recipe is.  I substituted the shortening with 1/2 margarine and 1/2 shortening.  The crust was flakey and tender and "picture perfect".  I chilled the shortening before use and chilled the dough for one hour before rolling it out.  I even froze 2 rolled out crusts and they came out perfect!  If you can't make a decent pie crust, try this one!!

That's a keeper! I tried the recipe yesterday and I was very pleased. I didn't have shortening on hand and used 1 cup frozen butter instead of 1 1/4 C. shortening, but that was the only change I made. I has a nice buttery flavor and flaky consistency. I cut the frozen butter into chunks and used the food processor. Then I split the dough and chilled it for 3 hours. It was easy and velvety smooth to roll out. I did not prebake it and I will definetly use it again. Thank you very much.

I'm sorry but this crust was really bad. I have been making pies for a long time and my own crust always comes out great. I thought I would try someone elses, this one. It came out tough and hard it waisted my hole pie.  I did not overwork it at all. I'm sorry.

This was the easiest pie crust I have ever made, and tasted fantastic.  I've tried many 'cookbook' pie crusts and they've always been too salty and hard to work with.  I found I needed only a little flour to roll this out, which is unusual for pie crusts!  It was easy to work with and shape. I also liked the nice amt. of dough, as there were scraps for the family to snack on.  The crust was flaky and perfect!  I will only use this recipe from now on.  Thanks!

I had leftover sweet potatoes that I had to make pies out of because my hubby was nagging me to death.  I made the pie crust and I didn't have a rolling pin or a pie pan.  Instead I had to shape the dough by hand and put it in a round cake pan.  It was very flaky and tasty.  It didn't look very pretty but I will buy my rolling pin and pie pans before I use the crust again on my upcoming peach cobbler.  I have never made pie crust before and now it will be something that I will add in my "from scratch" cooking.  Thanks a lot.

I have used this recipe for everything from pot pie to peach cobbler and the crust is always perfect! Just to change things up I sometimes add a tsp of cinn to the crust, any leftovers get treated with a splash of egg wash and some cinn/sugar, the kids just love it!

This recipe is simple and does make a flakey crust but it tastes awful!! All you taste is flour. I thought with Cherry filling it would be all right but it wasn't.. I will not be making it again.

This recipe was complete fail for me.  I followed it to the "T".  As soon as I started to roll it, it fell apart, cracked.  Definitely will not use this recipe again.  I'll go back to my NO FAIL recipe that I got from my husband's grandmother.

I substitued slightly softened butter for the shortening to reduce trans fats.  Use this recipe for every crust you need--savory fillings or sweet.  I had enough for two shells.  I used one for a key lime pie, and one for a meat caserole the next week (it froze well in the pie plate, and I put it right from the freezer to the oven, then filled).

I have made this recipe several times and it usually  comes out.  I will be the first to say that pie crust is an art.  Still don't feel confident about my skills with it but this recipe is pretty good at helping that.  Used to make a berry pie and shepards pie before-all good.  Would not call this the perfect crust recipe-but it is the one I have used several times-still keeping my eye out.

I have many recipes in my folder, but this is the only pie crust I use.  For me a pie crust is just something to keep the pie together but to my wife the pie crust is essential.   I use this pie crust with every pie I make, Lemon Meringue, Sweet Potato, Pumpkin, and Grandma Ople's Apple Pie recipe.  I change nothing in the recipe, except that I may adjust the flour or liquid to get it to where it's workable.

This was a very good recipe.  I used it for several quiche's I was making, and liked the recipe because it wasn't too sweet and complemented the quiche very well.  I substituted butter for the shortening, and chilled the dough for about 30 minutes before using it.  As suggested in a previous review, I added about 1/2 a tsp of baking powder (although I'm not sure it really did much) and I also added about 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. Instead of rolling it out, I pressed it directly into my pie pans (I had enough for about 2 and a half) and baked it for 12 minutes, added my quiche ingredients, and baked for 30 minutes longer.  It turned out wonderfully.

OK, I just must admit this is a better pie crust recipe than the one I have been using for 40 years.  It is also very easy to handle.  Made an ample amount for 3 single crusts.

This pie crust recipe did not work out for me as I hoped. It was very soft. I used plenty of flour on the counter & on my roller, but it kept sticking to my rolling pin & the counter when I was ready to lift it off. The dough cracked along the edges when I rolled it out, and fell apart when I went to lift it / scrape it off the counter. It tasted ok though & did bake to a nice golden brown. Sorry, I will look for another recipe for that perfect pie crust.

I had this recipe a while ago and my dad just loved it with apple pie. It's a hardy crust. Flaky, but not as tender as other crusts. Still, it's a nice crust for heartier fillings like chicken pot pie. Who says you can't have more than one crust recipe? I have one for sweet fillings, another for traditional pies, another for tarts, and yes, this one is for my chicken pot pies! It is a little wet if you add all the liquid. I refrigerated it before rolling to stiffen it and let it rest for a more flakiness.

Great pie crust.  I doubled it for a two crust deep dish pie, you don't need to double the water/egg/vinegar mixture since you don't need it all.  

I used regular all purpose flour and it was still great.  I was concerned when I rolled it out because I could see some chunks of butter in the dough (thought I did not mix it enough), but it baked perfectly.

I cut this recipe in half and only made one pie crust. It was easy to make and the crust turned out nice and flakey. It also tasted good! I rolled it out between two pieces of wax paper and it transfered into the pie plate nicely. This recipe is definately going into my recipe box.

This crust came out beautiful.  I modified it a little bit by using butter instead of shortening, adding 1 tablespoon of suger, and adding quite a bit more iced water (probably like 6 tablespoons or more).  I cut the butter in with a pastry cutter and then used a spoon just sort of go around the bowl lifting the lose dough until it came together.  I divided it into two balls, wrapped them in plastic wrap, pressed them down into two discs, and then refrigerated them for about two hours.  I rolled them out between two sheets of waxed paper and they didn't stick much at all -- much less than other recipes I've tried.  I made pumpkin pies and they came out great.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

This was a very easy recipe to follow!  I used the 'Blueberry Pie' recipe from Beth and the results were outstanding!  I had a lot of crust dough left over, so I rolled it out, spread it with cinnamon and sugar, cut it into strips, and baked it until golden.....nice little snack for my daughter!  Thank you for the great recipe!

This recipe gets two stars only because it was very flaky, although almost to the point of falling apart.  I don't know what went wrong, but it was ABSOLUTELY bland!  It was so tasteless. I will never make it again.  I am still in search of a pie crust recipe.

I've worked with many different types of pie crusts and for me they've all been pretty unmanageable.  I mean, I've been able to make all of the recipes that I've tried, but they've been pretty big pains.  To their credit, most of them turned out tasting good and were nice and flaky, but I ended up dreading making the crust so much that I didn't want to make pies very often (and I LOVE to bake so that's kind of rare for me).  Anyway, long story short, this crust rocks!  It was so simple to make, it was very easy to roll out and get in the pie pan, and it is so crumbly and perfect!!!!!  I am veryyyyyy happy with this recipe!  I never bother to rate anything or do reviews, but I couldn't even keep myself from reviewing this one because I have to gush to someone about how great it is!!!!!  Thank you Grandma for being such a great cook and thank you Felicia for Sharing!!!!!!

Very good crust! My husband made it for a pecan pie and froze the remainder for me to make a pie. I was able to roll out two crusts and make a lattice apple pie. Oo-lah-lah, what a success! I can't wait to make the crust myself as hubby says it was very easily done.  One hint: After rolling dough between wax paper, I placed in pie tin and refrigerated it so paper will come off without tearing the dough.

Best, flakiest, most awesome, and easiest pie crust I have ever made. I got a lot of compliments on my pies, especially the crust. Great for a dessert pie or pot pie.

This is the recipe I have used for over 30 years, although with a couple of minor changes.  Apple cider vinegar instead of white (but i do not mind trying something different), and putting the shortening in the freezer before adding it to the flour.  (I now keep my shortening in the freezer all the time!).  This turns out perfect every time! Plus, the leftovers make wonderful cinnamon/sugar “cookies”.

I give this 5 stars for taste, and 3 stars for texture.  Yes, it was flaky...in fact, it was too flaky.  I've never had a crust crumble so severely!  If you even touched the crust lightly, it falls apart.  Even the plastic wrap (I put over the quiche I made) caused the crust to fall off!  I was embarrassed by the mess it made at the hostess' home when I went to a Christmas potluck today.  It has too much shortening...maybe substituting some butter would help?

This recipe is fantastic.  I'm not a baker - we rarely eat sweets - but I needed to make a pie (two pies, actually) and the raves about this one were very convincing so I tried it.  It is truly excellent.  I practically beat it to death and I was so scared I'd ruined it, but it came out lovely.  It does only make roughly enough for just over 3 single crusts, but that's all I needed.  I used unsalted butter with no ill effect (the thought of "vegetable shortening" is not one I can personally deal with).  I made sure to use ice water and I refrigerated the dough for a couple of hours before I needed to use it.  It was quite stiff when I rolled it out.  Lovely flavor, tender, crispy, flaky.  If I have any complaint it is that it seemed to take a bit long to brown up. Thank you, thank you!

This is a delicious pie crust! I rarely use all the liquids. I think the size of egg you use makes the difference in the amount of liquid added and has to be adjusted accordingly.  I use 1/2 cup butter and 3/4 cup shortening. When I am making a fruit pie, I add 2 tablespoons of sugar. You can brush the top of the crust with the leftover egg before baking in the oven. I bake the pie in a 425 oven for 10 minutes then turn the temperature down to 350 for the remaining baking time to avoid overcooking the edges. Thank you.

I went into this with such high hopes. It didn't work though I followed directions to the letter. I chilled bowls and dough. It wasn't too humid. It was floury tasting and fell apart even with the addition of more liquids. Oh well, the grocery store version isn't horrible.

Fool-proof!  Every time I make this crust it turns out light and flaky.  Even when I'm too lazy to roll it out and just pat into the pan instead!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I only gave this 3 stars because it's a little bland as is. I made a few changes and now it's a 5 star recipe. I used a stick of softened butter and a 3/4 cup of shortening instead of the 1-1/4 cups of shortening. I also increased the salt to 1-1/2 tsp. This is perfect for meat pies or dessert pies.

This was my first attempt at making homemade pie crust by myself, so maybe that has something to do with the difficulty I had working with it.  It was difficult to roll out and almost impossible to maneuver into the pie plate.  I did a lattice top and it was pretty brittle and I had to be very careful with it.  I was skeptical of how it was going to turn out, but boy was I surprised.  It was delicious and very flaky!  Everyone loved it.  I will definitely make it again, but read the reviews of this recipe again to see if anyone has some tips on making it easier to handle.  This crust was awesome with Grandma Ople's Apple Pie recipe from this site.

I tossed out all my other basic pie crust recipes! This one is perfect everytime!  I put only small portions of the liquid mix into the pastry mix at a time, stopping when it is the perfect consistency.

This is a great pie crust recipe.  I ended up using butter flavored Crisco, which definitely added a nice buttery flavor to it.  I also reduced the vinegar to 2 tsps and then added 1 tsp. of vanilla.  The most important thing, when you make this crust, is to try and sift the flour first to avoid having to add more liquid (water) later on.  Otherwise, the flour will get too dense and the dough will be hard to work with.

I usually find that "easier" pie crusts end up with the taste and texture of store bought crusts.  This recipe does the trick though!  It is so easy to put together, stays together when you roll it out super thin and flakes beautifully once baked.  Thank you for sharing!

I wanted to make my own crust and saw that this one had lots of ratings. I was actually dissapointed. It was very hard to work with. I really did not come together very well when rolling it out.But surprisingly the finished crust was not that bad, after much manipulation.

My opinion may be premature, but I was disappointed with the final results. I must admit I needed 6 pie shells and tripled the recipe without adjusting any ingredients. I guess the lesson learned from this is, if you need more than 2 pie shells, consider using another recipe.  My curiosty was peaked after reading the high reviews posted with this recipe. My Mother was a pastry chef and I learned my crust making abilities from her. I will continue to use the process learned from my Mother's hands, love and knowledge.

I have always had problems in the past with my pie crusts being too tough so consequently I have bought many Pillsbury pie crusts.  There is no need for that anymore.  My crust turned out flaky and light.  I even had a little extra to roll out and sprinkle sugar and cinnamon on it and bake as usual.  My children loved this.  I made the crust with the Blueberry pie recipe from Beth from this site.  Very good.

This is the first time that I have ever made a pie crust and it turned out like I have been making pies for years and am an expert at it. The only thing I did differently was to chill it for 20 minutes before I rolled it out. Other then that I followed the recipe to the tee. Thank you, my husband was so excited that I was actually able to make him a pie that tasted as good as his mothers.

I have never been a pie baker until now!  Thank you so much for such a great recipe!  My kids eat the whole pie now because of the crust!

This is the easiest and most wonderfully flaky crust recipe! If you don't have tome to refrigerate it, put it in the freezer for a small amount of time. It works fine that way too!

Good recipe. It was a tad sticky for me...not that bad though. I thought the vinegar would make it taste strange but unless you knew it was in there, you couldn't taste it at all.

This is a great recipe.  My crust was very gooey!  But I simply rolled it out between two peices of wax paper and easily tranferred it to my pie pan.  When the crust was cooked, it was buttery...flaky...and very very good.  Note:  I added about two tablespoons of sugar to mine to give the crust an extra sweet taste.

My grandmother gave me this recipe when I first got married 17 years ago.  After countless pies, it truly has "never failed" me.  People rave about this crust as much as they do the actual pie!  I've even doubled and tripled the recipe for bake sales and it comes out beautifully every time.

I just tried this pie crust since it got such great reviews. I am very disappointed in it. It didn't roll out easily, it was falling apart as I tried to put it in the pie pan. I followed the directions closely and measured my ingredients carefully. I've put the other half in the refrigerator to see if that helps. But I'm moving onto another recipe for tonight's pie.

PERFECT! I used to hate making pie crusts because they were so unmanageable or brittle. This recipe is wonderful. For the first time in my baking experience I have been able to make a beautiful pie crust with fluted edges without any hassles. This one is a keeper!

WOW!  I actually made a GREAT pie crust!  And it's not a chintzy crust, either.  There's more than enough for a two-crust pie with tons of scraps.  No more fear of not having enough crust.  FABULOUS recipe!

While it didn't work well for my needs this time it was still a nice, not too flaky crust. I'd recommend blind baking before filling as well as egg-washing the whole thing, including lattice. I put down a few loose design pieces in my lattice work, which kept their shape well, but I forgot to egg wash them and they stayed ghostly pale. I will say that though they kept their shape while baking, this dough was exceptionally difficult to make designs with though a simple lattice would've been just fine. 

Overall a good basic crust that really needs blind baking . I won't be using it again, but if  you're looking for simple this is a good bet.

Used butter, chilled for and hour. I’ve used this recipe a few times now and everyone loves the flaky pastry. I’ve used it for pies and empanadas. I divide it and keep it in the freezer for last minute baking. Love it, love it!

The best pie crust-- hands down.   I've been using this recipe for years. The dough is harder to work with than most crusts.. but truthfully, what it lacks for in ease in rolling out.. it more than makes up in taste, so flaky,  and tender.  A note- to prevent sogginess, I use an egg white wash on the bottom crust.

This crust melts in your mouth.  I followed suggestions made by reviewers and chilled ingredients prior to use and after making the dough.  It was a bit difficult to put the dough in the pie plate (even using wax paper) because it's so flaky; however, it was well worth the effort.

I followed directions. Chilled the water and the shortening. It turn out great, even though I did not chill dough before rolling it out. I will next time. I have never made pie dough before! I actually got compliments on it! Foreign to me, as far as pie crusts are concerned! Saving this recipe for sure.

I used soft margarine and chilled it. It was more on the difficult side (for obvious reasons) but turned out well. I tried it again with a little butter for flavor, but I guess I like simpler pie dough.
No one complained and it does not distract from the filling so I'm keeping this one around!

I needed a pie crust recipe in a hurry for a deep dish pie (a quiche) and tried this one because it made a lot. My grandma's pie crust recipe that I always use barely makes enough for 1 regular pie shell, and I wasn't sure about doubling it.  This was perfect! I was nervous about egg and vinegar in pie crust, but it was fine - you don't know they're in there! Came together quickly and turned out flaky and delicious. I used butter flavored Crisco. It could use a pinch of salt, but that is all I would change. Thanks for a great recipe!

I used the food processor instead and it came out well.  When I add the liquid I did put the base in a bowl and didn't use all the liquid.  Very flaky.  I rolled it out between 2 sheets of wax paper and it was easy to put in the pie pan.  I used half and will use the other half very soon.

I  added a little more water to the recipe as it wasn't staying together as well. I also chilled the dough for about an hour in the fridge before I shaped it.

I think this might now be my go to pie crust recipe. It came out flaky and soft, the last recipe I had gave me a fifty percent chance that it would be good and the other fifty percent was that it would be hard as a rock. I would definitely make this again. A few changes that I added to this recipe is that I added two extra tablespoons of water, rolled it out immediately after I made it, and I baked it for ten minuets before I put my filling in. I have to say it was one of the best pumpkin pies I have ever made.

I used  1 cup of lard and 1/4 cup butter for the shortening.  Best  pie crust ever.  Put the crust in the fridge while I prepared my apples.

I made it as written, and it was not easy to roll out at all.  I had to really work with it in order to salvage the crust.  It did taste very good, though.  I might try refrigerating next time since I see other reviews suggest that.

Beautiful! Used 2 and a half sticks of butter instead of shortening - just for my cobbler. I know it'll be fantastic with shortening.

I agree with the first review.  I used all butter, and 3 tbsp. water as I did not need all the liquid.  Used this for French Canadian pork pie and my family said it was the best pie crust I ever made.  I also used a food processor to cut in the butter and it worked great.  5 double pie crusts made in no time!

I have made this exact pie crust for 50 years .  It is the best.  The secret is to not over mix. When I started using this recipe I always used good quality shortening,  Like a lot of recipes I have revised, I now use 1 stick cubed un-salted butter & 3/4 cup crisco. Now that I'm older I sometimes use the food processor, but you have to be careful not to over mix. When you remove it, shape it, but gently, remember make it with love! Put in fridge for 1 hour. You have to keep the butter cold. Good luck & Thanks

I loved the flakiness/tenderness and taste of this pie crust.  My only issue was that I had trouble with cracking when I rolled it out and also after it baked.  It could be operator error, though, as I'm not an expert at homemade pie crusts.  I will definitely try it again to see if I can perfect it.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This baked up into a SUPER flaky and almost delicate crust.  Handling it prior to baking was a chore though, with the dough not wanting to stick together, but sticking like crazy to the pin and the mat (yes, I refrigerated it for over an hour).  I made it work, but SHEESH; so that lowered my rating of this recipe.  If you can get it into your pie pan, you'll probably like the end result.

I made this crust for a sweet potato pie. I usually just eat the filling out of the pie and leave the crust. But I took a bite of this crust and thought it was just to yummy to leave. Best crust ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Very flaky, delicious, but hard to work with. I ended up just pressing it into my pie pan. Since I was making a quiche, I thankfully didn't need to roll a top coat! All that flakiness is grest with quiche.

The only reason I gave this one star is that was as low as I could rate. I followed the recipe exactly and mixed it by hand while adding the wet ingredients but it turned out tough and fell apart. Luckily I had a back up plan.

Just made my very first pie ever using this pie crust and it turned out perfect! This recipe was super easy to follow and tasted amazing. It has a buttery flavor and is very flaky and just melts in your mouth. I was having trouble cutting in my shortening so i gave up and just used my hands to mix it in together and did the same thing at the end of the recipe as well for I found it easier and quicker. I also decided to chill my dough for 30 mins in the fridge before rolling out. My end result was perfection!! I'll be making pies more often and will be using this recipe!

This is the best crust ever! Thank you so much for sharing. I didn't have any white vinegar so I replaced it with water. I also used real butter instead of shortening because I didn't have any shorten. The taste is unbelievable. It almost taste like a shortbread cookie. Everyone talked about how good my pie was. I'm excited that I finally found something easy and perfect to make for the holidays or a party. I made an apple pie and peach cobbler....delicious!

This is my go to Pie Recipe.  It comes out beautifully. Even on fruit pies, it flakes and comes out perfect.  I'm not sure why this doesn't have thousands of reviews.:)  This recipe with the apple pie by Grandma Ople is absolutely the best combination ever.

This is the first time I made my own pie crust.  I wanted to make a chocolate cream pie.  When I cooked the crust for 12min. the dough shrunk so much, how do I correct that? I added a rating but I don't feel it is fair
I want to try it again after I get some advise.

The BEST pie crust I've ever made. It is the same recipe that my grandmother used.  I do use butter Crisco and I do refrigerate my dough for about an hour.  People who don't usually eat the edge of pie crust will eat this.  I've used other recipes but keep coming back to this one.  It's easy to mix and easy to roll out.  I'm sticking with this recipe.

This made a wonderful crust, even though I used wholemeal flour. I had a bit more than I needed so froze the extra dough. After three weeks I defrosted it to top a chicken pot pie and it was, again. perfect. A great recipe that will be used many times.

I just used this recipe to make a chicken pot pie, and it was absolutely amazing!  It was flaky and very flavorful.  It met with universal acclaim amongst my family, which is a rare accomplishment.  I made the recipe precisely as written.  I chilled the dough for only about twenty minutes, but I had no trouble working with it.  I am usually intimidated by pie crust, but no more.  I highly recommend this recipe to everyone from pie making veterans to first-time novices.

I have used this crust for awhile now. My Mom got me the Allrecipes cookbook a few years back for Christmas and I swear this recipe has never failed me. The past few years I have entered pies in a local fair and won ribbons on those pies EVERY TIME and I swear this crust had something to do with it. The only change I made to it was I add 1/4 cup sugar and depending on the pie I might add a pinch of cinnamon (or other spice that goes with the filling.).

This has become my go-to pie crust recipe. Easy, flakey, and a generous portion to make a little something extra. I hate recipes that leave you needing more crust. Love this!

Made it my ninja! Love that it isn't so sweet , really allowed the filling to carry the flavor with this crust acting as a smooth bonus.

Turned out nice. Needs a little salt for my taste. Added an egg wash to the top with some kosher salt. Made with Chicken Pot Pie. Oh, Yeah!

Amazing!  The best crust I have ever made, or tasted for that matter.  Read all the reviews and followed the tips.  I only swapped out 1/4 c. of shortening for butter for extra taste.  In my case even after taking it out of the frig to roll out it was very crumbly but it came together once I dusted with more flour.  I used it for the bottom and top of my home made chicken pot pie.  The crust definitely made the recipe. Save this one to my recipe box.

I've used this recipe for over 40 years with only a few minor changes. #1 I only use lard for pie crusts and Vodka for the ice water.  Always flakey and perfect. The vodka cooks out with baking and leaves the best crust.

Best recipe ever! Chilling the dough definitely helps. It makes an easy-to-work with pie crust that is firm enough to cut yet delightfully flaky. I chilled my dough about 20-30 minutes, and it did the trick. Love it!!

I used coconut shortening and rice vinegar since that is what I had, and you will not believe how great those ingredients work in this crust!  I was in a pinch and needed a crust in a hurry, and this recipe did it, thanks!  Try the ingredients I mentioned too!

I doubled the recipe, used 1c chilled shortening, 1 1/2 c chilled butter. Also used apple cider vinegar because I don't have white. I needed an extra 4 T ice water, but my climate is very dry right now. Chilled the dough in the refrigerator before rolling it out, let it rest in my tins in the refrigerator after draping it in them. I made 2, double crust pies and had enough leftover for a single crust pie as well. Cut into strips for a lattice on one of the pies, the dough handled very well, didn't tear or break apart. The crust was flaky, flavorful and tender, everything I hoped for! The butter let it brown nicely, I did need to foil the rims halfway through.

LOVED IT!!!! I have ALWAYS been awful at making pie crust. I'm a excellent bread maker though. THIS PIE CRUST IS PHENOMINAL! I followed the recipe exactly except substituting 1/8 cup of the shortening for real butter. Also, put your butter AND shortening in the freezer for an hour or so until hardened. DO NOT OVER MIX your flour/shortening mixture. You need to have small chunks of shortening and butter for flaky pie crust!!! Separate your dough into two balls. Freeze for 15 minutes prior to rolling out. Roll out each ball in between wax paper. I made a Chicken Pot Pie from my own filling recipe. I will be posting it on AllRecipes.com as well.

We almost gave up on this recipe, even after chilling in the refrigerator because it didn't come out as "pretty" as expected. We rolled between 2 pieces of wax paper (which was a great tip!) and added more water. It turned out nice, surprisingly. We used it with the Beef Pot Pie III on allrecipes. It is the PERFECT pie crust for pot pie! Daddy had to have some right away! :)

I made this without reading the reviews first. My pie crust came out nice and flaky. Then I decided to read some reviews. I agree that this will make for an awesome pot pie. If you plan on using this for dessert pies, I suggest reducing or omitting the salt, and rather, sprinkle sugar on it before baking. 

Also, I used Crisco butter flavored shortening at room temperature. It's very hot and humid here, so after I cut the ingredients together and rolled it, I had to put it in the freezer for a few minutes so that it would not break when I put it the pan. 

For those who are having trouble with the dough, just remember that temp/humidity affects the dough. Slowly add the liquid portion to the mix...if your dough is too sticky, try adding a bit more flour, slowly.

This crust is delicious! It is super flaky, though. If you're going for flaky, this is your crust! It doesn't hold together so well when serving because of the flakiness, so if you're going for that picture-perfect slice, this might not be the recipe for you. Excellent texture when eating, though.

The pastry came out nice and flaky.  I prefer to add the liquid a little at a time so I mixed in the egg and vinegar before adding the water.  I thought it had enough liquid and didn't add any water, I should have as it didn't roll out very well.  I will make it again because I liked the texture and flavor.  This is also the same recipe as No Fail pie crust I.

No one commented on the crust when I made this recently.  I did change things a little.  I used salted butter instead of shorting, added 1tsp of sugar for sweetness and  dash of cinnamon.  However, it was fairly unremarkable.  It was better than store bought crusts but not a highlight for us.

This pie crust did taste good, however I think it takes some tweaking to get the dough right.  I did chill it and I still had problems with it sticking and or breaking. Thanks for the recipe though my company enjoyed the flavor.

HELP!  This recipe sounds great.  I want to use it for a pecan pie and the recipe for that says to use an unbaked pie crust.  Can I use this recipe and just not bake it first as directed?  Can I use it unbaked?  I don't want to mess it up.  Thanks!

I found the dough was dry and needed 2 tbsps.extra cold water. I chilled the dough for an hour and it rolled easily.  However, the crust was a little tough. It is a good recipe, however I am still looking for the perfect recipe.

This pie crust is the most difficult that I have ever worked with.  The dough needs to be chilled, and lots more water is needed.  In my opinion, the crust is too thin for two pie crust...try just one.  I will never try this recipe again!

This is the best pie crust ever! I've been experimenting with several pie crust recipes lately, and this is absolutely the best. SUPER flaky, very tasty. The egg adds a richness that is fantastic.

I had to add about 2T extra water, maybe because my egg was a medium, not a large.  It rolled out easily and was VERY FLAKEY!  I've never been good at pie crusts, but I did great with this one.  I had some leftover, so I rolled it outbaked it, and we used it for strawberry shortcake.  Excellent!

This recipe turned out perfect, I've never made pie crust before and I am very impressed by how wonderful and flaky it turned out.  My crust was NOT too thin at all as the prior reviewer wrote.  Maybe it's all in the size pie plate you use...

Working at a fire station, I can't afford to make a mistake with anything that I cook.  I used this crust with a peach cobbler.  I turned out fantastic.  It browned evenly and had some good rise to it.  It tasted even better.  Incredibly easy to make.

This is a great pie crust!  I've been using it for about 20 years!  I do use 5 Tablespoons of ICE water though, but that's the only difference.  I typically get 3+ crusts from it.  Flakey and delicious!  My dh says it IS as good or better than his mothers!  Can't have a better compliment than that!

Very flaky. You really need to use a chain inside the shell to keep it from puffing up so much.

Thankyou so very much for this recipe. I now have a pie crust to use for the rest of my life. THE DOUGH ROLLED OUT SO EASILY WITH NOTHING STICKING TO THE ROLLING PIN!!!!The crust turned out so flaky and delicious too. I also made Beth's Blueberry Pie and the whole thing was a success!!!

Excellent pie crust. It was easy to work with and it turned out fabulous. I made "Blueberry Pie" from this site and used a lattice top. It was beautiful. I still can't believe I'm able to make a homemade pie turn out so well. :-) Since I had quite a bit of dough left over, I rolled it out, cut it into strips and baked them with cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on top. My kids ate them up in no time.

Don't do what I did and forget the water!  I did, however go back and add the water after trying to roll it out and failing.  This is a wonderfully forgiving crust.  I use Smart Balance to help overcome the guilt of so much shortening!

This got to be the most easy pie crust recipe I've used. The best thing is it came out great.
I did not have pastry blender nor flour/butter cutter, I just used the very old tool of mine - hand. I subsitute vineger with lemon juice (thats what I have in the fridge), I did not have full 1 1/4 cup of butter, I put in 1/2 cup of canola oil instead to make up that amount of fat. I dump in 2 tbsp of sugar and 1/2 tsp of baking powder along with the flour. great stuff!

There simply isn't a yummier pie crust recipe out there.  I used this for the delicious Honey Pecan Pie (also outstanding recipe on this site) which made the show stopper of the Thanksgiving holiday.
Thanks for sharing.

This was the first time I'd ever made a homemade pie shell. This recipe made it so easy. It was very easy to work with and came out flaky and very tasty. I don't think I can ever use a store-bought pie shell again. I will most definitely use this recipe again!

This crust was amazing.  I've always been terrified of pie crust, but this recipe came together so easily!  I used it to make "Sweet Potato Pie I" from allrecipes for my Thanksgiving dinner and everyone wanted the recipe.  It was definitely a big hit!

OH MY GOD! This was the best homemeade crust I have ever tasted! Using a pastry blender made cutting in the butter super easy and all ingredients combined perfectly.  Usually I am a spaz at rolling out dough, but this recipe rolled out so wonderfully!  I used it for lattice work and it was a great touch for my infamous apple pie!

The first time I made this I only had 1/2 of the regular Crisco so I had to use Butter flavored Crisco for the remaining amount the recipe called for.  So, I had problems with the crust but the flavor was AWESOME!!!  My family and inlaws loved it.  The second time I made it I used regular Crisco and the dough was so easy to work with and the flavor was still good.  My family wants me to make it like I did the first time.

This came out really good for my lemon meringue pie. Was easy to make and easy to roll out. And tasted good too.

This crust was very flaky.  I absolutely HATE to stray from the recipe on my first time making it, but we didn't have any white vinegar so I had to use apple cider vinegar.  It turned out fine, needless to say.  I think I will probably try this crust again.

I have new confidence with Pie Crust. This was easy to handle (I did referigerate for a couple hours) and it produced the flakiest crust I have ever seen. I will never stray from this recipe.

This recipe was great!  I've been trying to find a recipe that wouldn't crumble when cut, this is it!  It was just the right texture.  The only thing I have to add to it is that the dough should probably be refrigerated for at least 4 hours or even over night before rolling it out.  This always works best for me!

Very Good--I made this in my bread maker using the setting called for in the bread makers book and it turned out great.  The only change I made was to reduce the salt.  I have been trying to make good pie crust for 36 Years finally sucess!!!!!!  Fire Mom

I am fairly new at pie-making, and this is the best pie crust. I have tried several recipes, and this one is definitely a keeper. It came out nice and flaky.

I was looking for a flaky yummy good pie crust and this is it!  I'm a 40 yr old "non-cooking" male and I made our Thanksgiving day pies using this recipe.  Everyone raved about it!  Wonderfully easy and very tasty. Highly recommend.
