I made this for dinner tonight and it was killer! The key is to use real butter and cream. We served it over a bed of rice. If you're not a fan of zucchini, sub in your own veggie or just leave it out. We'll definitely be making this again. Highly recommend.

I made this for dinner and it was... good.  I added garlic and red pepper strips, like some of the reviews suggested. It was still bland so I added paprika, more garlic and some seasoned salt. I had all the bits to be a great dish, but I tasted mostly cream when I sampled it, so I just went with my gut and added more seasoning.  Once we sat to eat, everyone added even more salt. I think I will make this healthier next time, skip the cream and make an Italian dressing type sauce.  I'm giving it 3 stars as it was a good thought, but needed a lot of improvising.

I’m a beginner when it comes to cooking but I found this recipe and made it with some easy. Though I did overcook the zucchini and undercooked the mushrooms yet the recipe still turned out fantastic! I served this with rice and even with my mistakes it was one of the tastiest meals I’ve had in a long time! Great stuff!

Yummy recipe. My husband went back for more! We served it over bow tie pasta. I didn’t have zucchini, but I had green bell peppers. That, combined with Tony Chachare’s in the sauce was a nice Cajun-ish twist on the recipe. Also used halfened chicken breasts rather than cubed chicken pieces. I will definitely be adding this to my recipe repertoire!

Delicious! Simple and easy, but very tasty. I followed the recipe, but forgot to as the parsley at the end (I was in too much of a hurry 'cause it looked and smelled so good!) and it was still scrumptious! will definitely make it again! Thanks for the recipe.

Added 3-4 cloves of garlic.  Could probably do with a little less butter and olive oil but it was excellent!

I loved this recipe as a base. I added red bell peppers and some white wine. Also,  instead of green onions, I used shallots.

Great recipe! My son is a picky eater and he went back for seconds.  I did brown the chicken with season salt, black pepper, onions and red bell peppers .   I served it over rice.  One of the best recipes I have found on allrecipes.com so far.  Will definitely be making it again.

Tasted superb!Left out the addition of flour which didn't add,or take away from the flavor. We ate this with roasted califlower rice,also found the Allrecipes website. Made for a easy-peasy week night meal!

It wasn’t a bad dish. My family did not complain about it and the Youngest devoured his plate but the original recipe to me tasted bland so I gave our 12 yr old a taste test and then gave him another taste test where I added cumin and curry powder. He much preferred the latter of the two.

This is a great recipe for the change of season from summer to winter. Like with most recipes, I did add my own flair and flavor, and it turned out delicious. I added roasted red pepper slices, crushed red pepper, and Italian seasoning to the mix for a little extra flavor. Also, Instead of adding straight cream, I ended up making a roux with the flour and butter, added chicken stock, and then added a splash of cream for that added creaminess. Also, this dish is fantastic served over linguine. This will definitely be a weeknight staple this fall/winter.

I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be tasty but bland. Perhaps I didn’t add enough salt and pepper. However, I added a couple of dollops of sour cream to the mix and WOW it turned out phenomenal! Next time I’ll add red & green peppers too.

So good but I did make a bunch of changes based on what I had as well as personal preference. I at least doubled the recipe, using 8  boneless thighs. I also used an entire head of steamed broccoli in place of zucchini, 1/2 a white onion instead of green, arrowroot powder in place of flour (mixed into some  heavy cream before adding) and added 6 cloves of minced garlic. Shortly before serving, I  stirred in 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese, which makes it taste alfredo-y. This was great too because I served it over a choice of fresh greens or rice, so everybody's happy.

Quick easy meal. I season the chicken with Yep seasoning, (a mixture of salt pepper and seasonings, super delicious!). It is very forgiving on the amount of ingredients one uses: In the past I have doubled the amount of chicken or reduced the amount of zucchini. I have also used yellow squash and three different kinds of mushrooms. Certainly one of the tastiest and easiest dishes one can find on allrecipes. Experiment and have fun! I serve it over rice. I also like to cook the rice in a mixture of water and chicken broth for extra flavor. This has become a family favorite and I make it at least once every 2 weeks.

This is one of mine and my daughters favorite recipes. I've made it a ton. last time I used cut up pork chop instead of chicken and I think we liked it even better. it would be good with no meat too. I do double the cream and add a bunch more seasoning (mostly garlic and ground pepper) then this recipe though.

I cooked the mushrooms with red onion for about ten minutes and then added the zucchini to cook for at least ten minutes. I then used light herb and garlic cream cheese with a little chicken broth instead of flour and cream, which made the sauce excellent.

I boiled my chicken instead, didn't add salt. Due to my sodium intake. It's  very good

This dish was absolutely amazing! I had leftover turkey From Thanksgiving that I decided to take out of the freezer and find a recipe to use with it. I hit the jackpot with this one! Since my turkey was already cooked, I started out by frying up mushrooms in some leftover bacon grease With a little salt and onion powder, putting them aside I sautéed the green onions and zucchini and a little salt and olive oil just like the direction said. After that I mixed it all up together per the directions and finding no red peppers like other people had used I threw in a can of diced tomatoes! I served this wonderful dish with rice and have never been happier with any recipe! The only trick now is to not eat too much! This will definitely be a regular in our home.

It was excellent, easy and quick. There are just two of us so it was easy to cut the recipe in half. Will definitely fix this again.

I didn't have any zucchini, so I used asparagus instead.  Also, to keep the calories down, I used milk instead of the heavy cream (since it's basically the flour that thickens this - and I did use 2T flour).  Good recipe that's easy to "tweak" with whatever you have in your fridge!  A keeper for sure!

I cooked this in a wok, and the broccoli needed more time - was hardly cooked.  The broccoli should be cooked first.  The chicken should be cut in strips, as is normally done in Chinese style dishes.  Red peppers would also be a nice addition.  A good recipe with modifications.

I made it and it was delicious. The recipe is very easy to follow and the results are fantastic. I served it over large baked potatoes. I have 3 late teen boys

Fixed it by recipe and all three grandchildren loved it. (15, 12, and 3) I  doubled the sauce and did add red pepper. Those vegetables hid in the delicious sauce. Next time I will add more vegetables- anything would be great. We ate over broad noodles for kids. Kind of fattening but well wotrth the calories with kids loving it !!!!

This was sooo incredibly delicious! Love, love, loved it!
I did add a little bit of garlic powder to mine. Served it on a bed of rice. Quick, easy and will make this often.

Will make again. But I’ll add some to sauce. It needed a little extra. But just cooking for me it was pretty good.

It was perfect! If you're not a fan of zucchini like myself though, you can replace them with bell peppers. It will still be just as good!

Do not know where the 5 stars came from.  Was bland and the chicken breast was tough and stringy. Disappointed.
