Delicious! I used the ingredients exactly as written, but after I browned the ribs  and made the sauce, I put everything in my crock pot. Cooked on high for about an hour and then low for another 2-3. Came out great. Served over rice.

DELICIOUS! Made everything exactly as written (doubled it), but put it all in a slow cooker and cooked on low. My ribs were smallish, so I checked them after 5 hours and they were done to perfection! The family loved these...great flavor and came out very moist and tender. I will def be making these again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Very tasty.. but I don't think I'll put that much water that is called for because the sauce was so very runny.  I only used 1 tablespoon of the dry mustard but otherwise followed the recipe.  I'll try it again.

I made this tonight and my family loved it!  I did change a few things.  I was in a hurry for dinner so instead of baking it I let it simmer on the stovetop in the sauce for about 40 minutes.  The ribs were tasty and tender!  I also discovered I didn't have any dry mustard so I used Dijon instead.  I also made a butter and flour rue before adding the sauce to the pan.  After tasting it I decided it could use a little heat and I added some red cayenne pepper.  It was a easy week night dinner to pull off in a hurry.

I followed the directions as written but considering the comments of an overly watery sauce, I added 1T of flour to the partially cooked onions and reduced water to 3/4 cup.  The sauce turned out perfectly.  The entire dish had a mellow flavor.

I seared the meat without dredging in flour.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe, with the exception of using the slow cooker as my oven was on the fritz.  This is really an interesting flavor, certainly not barbeque but slightly reminiscent of it.  I did thicken with a cornstarch slurry to give a little more body to the sauce.  The meat was tender and flavorful.  We  ate it on pasta and also on rice.  We also used it in a sandwich with cole slaw.  It's a much more subtle flavor than barbeque and is definitely a nice change of pace.

These come out very tender and tasty.  It is a must to baste these often when cooking in the oven.

Followed Krianni's suggestion (thanks!) to make this in the slow cooker. It was a tasty, easy mid-week dinner. I thought it could have used a bit more kick, (next time I'll add some garlic or maybe chili powder) but the kids and husband were happy with it as written. I couldn't find country style ribs at the store, so used a rack (about 2-1/2 lbs) of "St. Louis-style" ribs and cut them into individual ribs. Cooked them on high for about 3 hours after browning them in a skillet and they were very tender. I used 1.5 times the sauce ingredients, but only added 3/4 cup water, as others have suggested. We ended up with too much sauce left over, but it was a nice consistency. Served it with steamed spaghetti squash to soak up the sauce (low carb).

I was skeptical, but this turned out excellent! I halved the recipe since I only had 3/4 lb ribs, but forgot to halve the water. The ribs were almost covered with sauce. After I turned them I removed the foil to let some of the moisture cook off. They turned out amazingly tender and delicious! I left out the onion since I didn't have one and didn't want to run to the store, and used red wine vinegar since that's all I had on hand too. Oh, and I used brown mustard since I didn't have dry mustard.

This was really good. I made the sauce without the worcestershire sauce as I didn't have any. I added some chili garlic sauce to add some kick. It came out terrific! I will make this again. Thanks for sharing!

We liked this.  I agree I would cut the water to half but it helps if you want extra gravy later.  I added  extra sugar later and put the meat under the broiler to get  the "burnt"  we like. (just didn't want to grill tonight).  Great base and you could add heat, sugar, or asian spice to customize this.   I served with rice (almonds, broccoli and seasons) pilaf . Good Find!

I added leftover crushed pineapple and used onion powder rather than fresh onion then thickened the gravy.  I also added thick sliced sweet potato then baked as directed.

I made this using country style boneless ribs. Both hubby and I really enjoyed this. The pack of ribs I had was only a little over a pound, so they finished cooking in about an hour. The only change I made was to season the flour with salt and pepper before using on the ribs. I think that the sauteed onions give the sauce a wonderful flavor.

Very good recipe!  I followed other posters' advice and lowered the water to 3/4 but that was still a bit watery upon serving.  I also added chopped garlic when sauteing.  I think I'll try this next time in the crock pot.  Was really yummy the next day and the sauce had thickened..co-workers tried it and ended up asking for the recipe.

This recipe was fantastic! The pork was so tender I could cut it with a spoon, and served over white rice it made a great main dish for my family.

I took other reviewers' advice and reduced the water, made a flour/water mix to thicken, and added chopped green bell peppers to the onions. Hands-down the best substitutions I made were exchanging bootstrap molasses for brown sugar and spicy brown mustard for dry mustard. I also added 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper and 2 tsp of Crystal Louisiana hot sauce for added kick.

The last 30 minutes of cooking time I cut the falling-apart ribs into chunks which made them even more tender. Delicious! I will definitely make this again.

This was really tasty... I did add about 1/2 c. chopped carrots and an equal amount of chopped green peppers with the onion.   This method makes a much better-tasting dish than cooking it in a slow-cooker, if you have the time!

My husband said that this was the best pork recipe I ever made.  Usually boneless pork ribs always  turned out very dry for me, but not this time. They fell apart  and were really moist and the sauce was delicious. I served it over mashed potatoes-yum.

I made this tonight and it was very good!! I made some changes after reading the other comments I only used 1/2 the water and had a nice sauce with plenty for our leftovers, I also added a red pepper I had on hand, some diced garlic and chipotle southwest seasoning. Also after browning the meat I put it in the crockpot, it was cut with your fork good served over white rice!!

I liked it a lot. Was hoping for more of a glaze than a sauce. Still, hubby loved it, and we both enjoyed them. Taking the extra time to brown them prior to adding the sauce and baking gave the ribs a great flavor!

This was very good. It was subject to what I had on hand so I used some of a squeeze jalapeño mustard which added a nice tang& I cut water down to 3/4c  as suggested by other reviewers. It was very easy& delicious so very worth the time to make. This will be repeated at our home frequently.

This recipe has become a staple in our household. I’ve made it so many times now I’ve lost count. Occasionally I have to substitute prepared yellow mustard for dry or I don’t have the full hour and a half to slow cook it but every time it turns out amazing. I usually throw in some chopped up carrots and serve over rice for a full meal.

Easy to prepare and family loved it. My daughter asks for this on a regular basis.  Rated 4 instead of a 5 because even though my family raved about it, it is somewhat reminiscent of barbeque and I personally, don't like barbeque.

I made the sauce exactly as the recipe stated. The ribs came out so tender they were falling off the bone but the taste could have been better. The sauce was too watery too so next time, I'm upping the amount of vinegar, brown sugar and Worcestershire sauce and lowering the amount of water a bit. I think it's a very good starter recipe for ribs and just needs a little tweaking.

This was so yummy that I was craving it again as soon as the meal was over!  I had a 4 lb. package of country style ribs, so I doubled the ingredients for the sauce, and that was just right.  I also browned the ribs and put them in the crockpot with the sauce for about 3-4 hours on low. The sauce was really good over rice!  I think this will be my go-to recipe next time ribs are on sale!
