My husband and I really enjoyed these french toast waffles.  I followed the recipe exactly using cinnamon swirl bread.  So easy and so good!  I'll be making these again for sure.

If it was only the idea of making french toast in a waffle iron I would have given this 5 stars, but the actual recipe is on point too! I made this  today, and it was definitely a success. I topped it with a basic whipped cream, strawberries, and real maple syrum... mmmm so good.  I made it as recommended with 2 exceptions. 1. I feel that french toast isn't french toast without cinnamon, so I added that to the mix. 2. I didn't have the recommended breads, or thick cut bread at all, but it still turned out great. Next time I'll definitely try and get my hands on thick cut bread.
