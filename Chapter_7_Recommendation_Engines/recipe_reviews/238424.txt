We liked the dressing, and it has a good balance of sweet and sour.  Followed the recipe to the letter, and we were happy with the taste, but there are just a couple things I will do differently in the future.  I will cook the potatoes whole, leaving the skins on, and then cube.  That’s just the way I cook potatoes for potato salad, and I like the texture a little better, just a personal preference.  There’s absolutely no color in the finished potato salad, and I think visually it ends up looking kind of bland...which it isn’t.  I garnished with chopped parsley which I think helped, maybe adding a little chopped celery would be good, but leaving the skins on will add some color, as will some crumbled cooked bacon which is the next thing I definitely will add.  This is a really easy potato salad to make, and it comes together quickly.  While the potatoes are cooking, go ahead and make your dressing, so you’re good to go when the potatoes are cooked.  One other thing to mention, this is good served warm or chilled.  Thanks KFREESE for sharing your family’s long-time recipe.

Pretty good recipe, though we felt it needed a lot more salt.  I also followed the masses and added fresh chopped Parsley to the finished product.

We loved it. I did use green onions which gave colour to the salad. The taste is great! Just like my mother-laws. Thanks for posting.

I loved this potato salad, as did my 7-year old and husband.  My 4-year old gives it 1 star.  The only addition was fresh garlic.  We used cubed red potatoes (skins on) and will definitely make this recipe again.  Thanks.

Just like my grandmother and Mom made, except they didn't use the ground mustard and would use green onions in season. Grandma and Grandpa were German Russian immigrants in 1908, this is the only kind of potato salad they made. I don't know if the recipe changed when their ancestors left Germany from the hot German potato salad you often see, or if it was just a regional difference. Love it, and my family, who are all potato salad averse, love it too!

Thought it was a little "runny", so added a little flour to the dressing.

Quick and easy. I will make this again. I made it even easier by leaving the skin on for the added nutritional benefits. My family loved it!

I loved this potato salad. I did change regular white potatoes for (white) sweet potatoes.  Otherwise no changes. I'll sprinkle with chives next time.  Spectacular recipe! Thanks!! I never need potato salad with mayo again!
