I have had corn fritters before, but never thought to add curry (I doubled it because I like the flavor).  They are simple and tasty with salt on top, but I do wish I had used the suggestion to make some kind of sauce.  Also, I drained the can of corn although it isn't specified whether or not to do so and used regular milk rather than soy.

I was hoping to find a recipe similar to my mom's fritters, however I liked the idea of adding curry for something different.  After mixing in the egg, soy milk, and salt, I had a thick goopy mess, similar to biscuit mix. I have no idea how you could get a "thin consistency" unless you add at least twice as much liquid.  I added an extra half cup of milk. When I added the corn, I also added the corn liquid.  I still could not get a good consistancy. The fritters were flavorless and I couldn't taste any curry --- just salt and flour. Sorry  but I'll never be making these again.

When I started making this, I had a huge gluey glob; I had to add twice the amount of milk, and then some more after adding the corn.  I tasted the batter and it was really lacking flavor so I added some Madras Curry Mustard I have on hand.  This helped a lot, but it still needed something.  After cooking them,  I ate it with Mango Chutney- they were pretty tasty, but it really needs something else; haven't put my finger on what yet.

It sounded better than it tasted...I added some jalepenos to give it a little kick which made it better. I think it does need some sort of sauce

The taste of this was very good....but as for holding together forget it!!! And I didn't even add the milk!!!!  The mixture was so soggy even after I squeezed and let the zucchini sit in a strainer!! I won't be making this again

The flour to liquid ratio is way off on this recipe.  There is no way I could even get the flour incorporated with just 1 egg and 1/2 liquid.  It was also missing some sort of leavening.  Second time I added a tsp of baking powder to the batter, but it was still missing something. A good basic concept, but the proportions need work and there is a missing flavor component (like a little heat or citrus or something to brighten the flavor).
