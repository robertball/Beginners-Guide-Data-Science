I wanted to try something new and made this as a side dish for christmas dinner.  It was really good! More like a dessert tho. Tasted alot like a pumpkin pie but with a fluffier texture and without the hassle of a crust.  I really liked this and probably could have ate the whole dish myself!

My family loved this!  I modified it to meet my dietary needs.  I used I Can't believe It's Butter, Coconut Palm Sugar, and Coconut flour, and to give it more flavor I added 1/3 cup pure maple syrup.  I also whipped the egg whites and butter and folded it in at the end.  I baked fluff and had a great texture.

The oven temperature on this recipe needs to be reduced. At 18 minutes it was almost burnt on top and the edges yet, still raw in the middle. I made this using gluten free flour and four medium eggs (as mentioned in the notes). It is very, very good. I will definitely make it again. It was an excellent complement to baked chicken. Thank you for the recipe.

I cut down on the sugar and added salt/pepper/ & sage for a more savory version. Next time will try cutting down on the butter too. 450 burned top and sides before it set, so I also turned down the heat to 400 the 2nd time I made it. It's enough like pumpkin pie that my 9 year olds liked it and my husband said "you can make this again" which is high praise from him!

After greasing my pan I lightly dusted with a 2:1 ratio of sugar and cinnamon. Additionally, I separated the eggs and folded in the beaten egg whites as a last step. Great recipe.

Tasty and not too sweet, which is how I like it. Also, added spices like cinnamon and nutmeg. Used gluten-flour instead, and it turned out great.

The dish was absolutely perfect and delectable. The only change I made was because I didn't have any cake flour  -so I substituted it with 1 tbsp of cornstarch and the rest of the 1/2 cup with all purpose flour.

Nice flavor and texture! I used a Japanese Kabocha pumpkin for this.  I dusted top with cinnamon but it turned burnt brown by 40min. I should have covered w foil. Scraped burnt looking top off though and taste was wonderful.

Been struggling to fall back in love with pumpkin, but this restores my faith. Used a few tbsp less sugar and improvised my own cake flour (with some white starch that may be corn or may be tapioca) but otherwise followed this precisely. Outside developed a bruleed-tasting crust--pretty burnt, though I liked it. Shocking. I've never had a souffle before but it's safe to say this rookie version has me obsessed due both to the texture and the flavor, which is pretty much pure pumpkin, with a little buttery caramel in the background. I didn't think that was possible. Pumpkin spice desserts don't hold a candle to this.

This is definitely going in my "Get Me A Husband" file.  I used cinnamon, brown sugar, maple syrup, plus maple extract, and coconut milk.  It was creamy with a beautiful maple finish and just the right amount of sweet which was balance perfectly with saltiness of the salted butter.   Next time, I will use coconut flour and more spices.

My husband is on a gluten and sugar free food plan. I used coconut flour and splenda. I separated the eggs and put the whites in a metal pan with the beaters and put them in the freezer while i made the rest of pie. Added 1 teaspoon (tsp)vanilla, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/8 tsp ginger and 1/8 tsp cloves. Sprayed the pan with Pam and sprinkled the pan with a combo of 1 Tablespoon splenda and 1/4 tsp cinnamon.  Then added leftover cinnamon/splenda combo to egg whites and beat until stiff, folded them in and baked in a 8" cake pan (that's all I had).  My husband was very upset with me for having some.  "I can't believe you took some of MY pie"  needless to say he LOVED it. Making it again today and making my own dessert.

I made it the first time for Thanksgiving and used 2% Milk and coconut sugar. I also added 3 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. It was good but I could have cooked it a little longer. Anyone thinking it may be bland should add pumpkin pie spice, I use this for sweet potatoes all the time. I'm making it today using heavy cream instead of milk, still using the lower glycemic coconut sugar. I will cook for 50 minutes this time. We will see.
