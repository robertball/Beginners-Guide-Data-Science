We are a group of grade 10 students in a foods class, from Sault Ste. Marie, Ont, Canada. Our class tried out many different brownie recipes and our group was assigned this one. They tasted really good and didn't take long to make. Instead of baking a double batch, we just baked a single batch. We agree that it should be two batches because it's really small. Chocolate chips would be a good additional ingredient just to sweeten the brownies a little more. We chose not to add peanut butter to the recipe because we thought it would ruin the taste. The recipe was very delicious but we have made a few minor suggestions for next time. Thanks!
From, the Muffin Girls

These were the best brownies I have ever made.    I gave them four stars due to some changes.... 1 cup sugar because some said they needed to be sweeter.  1 egg rather than 2 because that made them fudgier, and 1/4 cup p-butter to compensate for the lack of one of the eggs. Also, I used dark choc cocoa because that is what I had.   They turned out very fudgy and dark and tasty.  By the way, the batter was very thick like cookie dough.

A okay recipe, but not nearly as good as other brownies.  Too bland, and there was not enough chocolate.  I think that adding a cup of chocolate chips and doubling or tripling the peanut butter would help make this recipe shine.

These are excellent. We were laying around last night I decided that I wanted to make something with my 2 yr old.  Well I came on to ALLRECIPES.COM and looked for brownies.  I found these luckily. (We were out of butter and milk)  And decided to make them.  I made a double batch.  These are really great because they are not over sweet!!! I made the double batch less than 12 hours ago and they are gone.  There are only three of us living in the household!!!! Try these and you will love them.  This recipe has broken me from ever buying store bought again!!!!  Congrats!!!!

Man, these were DEFINATELY not what I was craving.  If you like cake-type brownies, then these may be up your alley.  I thought they were WAAAAY to thick.  I doubled the batch as suggested by others, I even added a little extra oil, just in case and removed them from the oven earlier than suggested.   The batter was extremely thick, which should have warned me, but I thought I would give the recipe the benefit of the doubt.

I made a double batch of peanut butter frosting, which was the best part.  

I was very disappointed and wasted a lot of ingredients.

My husband took one bite, made a face and put it back on his plate.  He loves "cake style" brownies, but these ruined it for him.  

My reccomendation, try another recipe, don't bother trying to tweak this one.

I followed the original recipe and instead of peanut butter I added Nutella.  It was really good!  The is a great simple recipe for brownies that is easily adjustable to tastes.

Not bad but not the best brownies. I find it odd that they are made in such a large pan, I made mine in an 8x8 pan and they came out fine not super thin but thin. Not sure if I will make them again. I did like how easy they were.

I used 1 cup sugar and substituted the peanut butter for chocolate chips and they were great! The top was a little crunchy and they were super gooey inside. I also used a 8x8 dish. My kids loved them!

Great basic recipe. Use this as a foundation to create wonderful mixtures. I added chunks of bittersweet chocolate to heighten the chocolate flavor. The hint of peanut butter was good.

These brownies are good.  The peanut butter does distract from the chocolate a little, so they are not as chocolatly as your regular brownie.  Great when you don't have a brownie mix on hand.  Ingrediants are common kitchen staples, so this is a great dessert to make on a whim.  Overall, I liked them!

These definitely did not come out the way I was expecting them to, based upon other reviews. I made a few changes: I used only 1 egg, a little more sugar, and a little more peanut butter. The 'brownies' ended up very crumbly and not at all chocolaty. In fact, they tasted more like a giant sheet of brown peanut butter cookies.

I loved this recipe most because I had all the ingredients on-hand. It took a little long to spread the batter in the pan, but it was well worth it! Yummy!

These were terrific! Although they looked really heavy they were actually very light! Recipe was very easy to make, my two boys helped me bake them, and enjoyed that they could do most of the work!

Will definitely try this again.

I would give this zero stars if I could. Made it exactly as is in recipe and it wasnt even a pourable batter, so added more oil, still pasty, baked them anyway and the taste was aweful. I don't know what the deal was. Just aweful! So dissappointed.

A little too sponge-like for our taste.  We prefer a more dense brownie.  Saying that, though, we did enjoy the flavour (we are big PB fans in our house!).

It tasted good. I listened to the advice of the previous reviews and added about 1 1/2 cup choc. chips but i shouldnt have. I t would have been better w/o the chocolate chips because they all sunk to the bottom when i stuck it in the oven. It was small too even though i did it for 16 people. I would make it again with 25 servings but it was pretty good.It had a very lite airy dough but great caramel/chocolate flavors I would have liked it better w/o the chocolate chips (darn those stupid things! LOL). I would definatly make it again  though w/o the chocolate chips. So the moral of the story is to not try to tweak a recipe the first time , wait til the 2nd!

Tip: PRESS the batter out into the pan to spread it evenly. This is an easy basic recipe from ingredients that are already on hand. I liked that it's easy to modify using what you have and did not require a trip to the store! Used another reviewer's tip and used one egg and 1/4 c. Peanut butter to keep them chewy and moist instead of cake-like. Used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar bc I was low on the white. Tossed in a handful of tossed pecans and scraped 1/2 of a Bakers unsweetened chocolate square over the batter after it was spread in pan, then drizzled a small amount of Hershey's syrup across all before baking. They were done in no time, and turned out perfect. Took a pic of the few that were left, lol. Thanks for sharing.

Everyone that tasted these absolutely loved them. More sugar as some suggested may be desired (these are less sweet but very good.) I liked the addition of peanut butter. I changed to 30 servings and baked in a glass pan for about 27 minutes (depends on your oven.)

I absolutely loved these. I only had about 1 tablespoon of peanut butter so the peanut butter flavoring wasn't strong. Next time I'll try the full 3 tablespoons. A very easy, no mess recipe. Great for serving with ice cream!

These brownies turned out amazing!  I added a few hand fulls of milk chocolate chips just for fun...and they turned out really chocolatey!  Be careful not to overcook the brownie, as it will dry out quickly.  This recipe will go into our family favourites!  Thanks for sharing!

I added 3/4 cup of chocolate chips to bring out the chocolaty and peanut butter flavors. I also added a few exta spoons of coco powder to give it some more of the chocolate. If you love chocolate this will make the recipe even better.

Wonderful recipe, I doubled the recipe, for the most part (used 2 eggs). Used butter instead of oil. Very fudgy very GOOD. I will be making thie recipe again. Nothing cake like, very brownie like.

I just had to try these brownies out of curiosity I guess.  The brownie recipe I have been using forever takes 1/2 cup of butter and these took 1/4 cup of oil.  I did add an extra tablespoon of cocoa and baked them for 20 minutes.  I thought they were very good, with fewer calories, and next time I will only bake for 18 minutes.

I am particularly picky about my brownie recipes as some of them have come out like cake or a biscuit, others are too runny..but these were delicious! I added butterscotch chips to them and they were even better. Very rich I think I will add nuts next time instead. Otherwise I would suggest this recipe to everybody.

I don't know what the other reveiwers are talking about...these are awesome.  Dry?  Not my (double) batch- and brownies aren't my favorite because they typically ARE dry.  These are awesome and were very easy...THANKS!!!  My daughter says peanut butter frosting on top would be really good!

I was looking for a simple recipe and tried this one. They are different from the box brownie mix I'm used to but still good and more cake like. I sprinkled with powdered sugar when done baking and served with a glass of milk.

As soon as I mixed these up, I was concerned about the pan size for the very small amount of batter.  I decided to follow the directions though and spread it out thin.  The "brownies" only took 15 minutes to be cooked through, but they definitely aren't brownies.  They are cake-like for sure, but they are also super thin, like half inch thick maybe.  Also, they didn't come out of the pan in one piece, so we each ended up just scooping our portion out into a bowl in pieces.  They tasted yummy, but definitely not what we were going for.

I have made these brownies twice. The first time I was confused by the instructions because at the top it says prep for 10 minutes and bake for 15 minutes or something similar but then at the end of the method it says to bake for 25-30 minutes. So I followed the method and ended up with brownies slightly burned around the edges and relatively dry. The second time I made them I baked them for only 15 minutes and they were a bit better but were still not the gooey kind of brownie you expect. If you like cake-like brownie's (I saw this term in another review :)) then try it, but otherwise I wouldn't recommend this recipe.

Great brownies! I followed the recipe except I increased peanut butter to 1 cup and  added chocolate chips, walnuts and used 8x8 pan.  They were delicious!! This will be my go to recipe for quick brownies.

Good brownies with rich flavor and nice texture.  Not overly chewy, more cake-like.  I agree with Muffin Girls, this recipe needs to be at least doubled.  I doubles all ingredients and still only fit in a 8x8 pan.  I like thick brownies, when I put the batter in a 9x13 pan, I knew they would be very thin and maybe even burn.  My opinion is if wanting to use 9x13 pan the recipe needs to be 4x as much as the original recipe calls for.

In the last year and a half this has become my go to brownie recipe.  The best way to make it is to double it, make it with dark chocolate cocoa powder, and add half a bag of chocolate chips (I use dark of course because we are dark chocolate crazy here).  This recipe is the one thing that gets requested at family get togethers over and over again.
6/17/14 Post: The ease and taste of this recipe is awesome.  However, when I did a single batch in a 7x11 in pan it was terrible.  It was about 1 inch tall and dry.  My second time, I double the recipe and put it in a 10 x 6 inch pan and they were marvelous!  If I were to make a single recipe again I would put it in a 8x8 in square pan.

Extremely dry with a grainy texture. I tried these because the picture made them look like more of a fudge. I would try something else.

These were really easy to make and I was looking for something simple because I wanted something to eat, but didn't feel like baking something difficult. I used 1/4 cup of pb and 2 tablespoons of chocolate syrup because of some of the reviews I read that said it wasn't sweet enough. The batter is more like dough than a batter and was kind of hard to spread in the pan, but over all I would recommend this recipe!

These had good flavor, but I was hoping for a chewy, fudgey brownie.  These had more of a cakey texture, I did use a 10 x 10 pan, so maybe that made a difference.  Maybe doubling the recipe would make a difference.

I made them in a browine pan(10x7) and they only took 13 minutes to bake, very fast total time was 18 minutes! I iced them with 'chocolate frosting I' recipe, very yummy icing!  I will double the recipe next time and I am sure that will make this recipe a 5 star!

Peanut butter?  What peanut butter?  These weren't very fudgy or brownie like, and I think the peanutbutter needs to be doubled-- you can't taste it.
