I substituted what I had, which was 1/2 each butterscotch and chocolate chips and mascarpone cheese instead of cream cheese, and they were delicious! I'll definitely make these again.

I made this recipe as written in a Springform pan. OMG! Delicious! It's like a butterscotch cookie with cheesecake filling. Yummy! Thank you!
