I just returned from a family reunion, and wanted to say thank you for this recipe. It received more rave reviews and recipe requests than any other dish there. I did take the advice of several earlier postings, and substituted frozen shrimp and cajun seasoning rather than the canned shrimp and regular salt. I also made one other substitution - I used pasta rather than rice. I realize that this is a rather large change, but the 8 ounces of penne pasta made for a wonderful pasta salad. I can assure you that I will be making this again in the future. Thanks again.

I really liked this salad. My hubby wants more meat next time. I did use frozen shrimp as others recommended. I used more spices than in the recipe such as red pepper,Old Bay seasoning, and more minced garlic. I like the flavor of this salad at room temp. better than cold. Next time I make it I am going to add more cooked bacon right before serving. I don't like soggy bacon.

In the time it took the bacon and rice to cook I had all of the veggies chopped and the dressing put together.  And most of the ingredients are things most of us keep on had so it added less than $5 (for the shrimp) to my grocery bill.  And best of all it was a big hit at out Mardi Gras pot luck.  Thanks for sharing.  I will make this one again and again.

This was really good and nice and spicy, but be warned! If you go the store and buy everything you need for this recipe, you'll spend like forty dollars! Also, it was pretty exhausting chopping everything. This recipe would be a good group project.

Great recipe, followed the advice of other reviewers and used kielbasa instead of ham, and instead of plain old salt used Zatarans creole seasoning.  Make sure you use long grain rice, I forgot to get it and used short grain, the rice turned out a little mushy, still tasted good.  I think washing the rice would have helped too.  Oh well, next time this won't be a problem for me.

We are from the south and my husbands family is from the low country. This salad was unique but everyone loved it even my picky 13 year old.
Will be putting this in my book for future use.

This salad is awesome!  As others suggested, I used fresh shrimp, kielbasa, and substituted 1/2 t. Zatarans Cajun Seasoning for the salt.  I also used red pepper instead of green, and added green onion and chopped baby carrot for color.  We'll be having this a lot more!

Outstanding salad, Louis! Why didn't I think of it? We love jambalaya and serve it often to our guests. I never knew it could be so tasty as a salad.I used Kielbasa rather than ham, omitted the salt and used zesty Italian dressing. Yummy!

Thank you Louis! This is an easy, extremely tasty recipe. I was looking for a new summer salad for my customers and now I can't keep enough of this on hand!  My family loves this too. I use frozen salad shrimp. Thanks sooooo much.

A little disappointed after reading the reviews. I expected a bit more "Creole" taste. It basically tasted like rice, shrimp, and italian dressing. Overall not a bad recipe, but I might add some New Orleans flavoring next time to spice it up.

No canned shrimp used in my dinner!  I used fresh small shrimp and went with all the suggestions and used kielbasa instead of ham.  You must add some creole spice to make it a true "jambalaya."  Fabulous the next day, as everyone else mentioned!  It's so helpful to have all the reviewers' suggestions, isn't it?

"You can make that for me every night" was my husband's comment to this meal. I did make some changes to the recipe, as I couldn't bring myself to make *cold* Jambalaya, but the base recipe seemed healthier than other Jambalayas. I also wanted to add more spice to it, so here's what I did. 1. Cook rice to taste (we used instant brown rice).  2. Chop up ham, bell pepper, celery, and tomatoes, and put them in a saucepan over medium heat.  Add the bacon, shrimp, 1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder, 1/4 teaspoon hot pepper sauce and 1/4 teaspoon ground cayenne pepper. Stir well.  Simmer for 3-5 minutes. 3. Add cooked rice to saucepan and stir everything together. Cover and simmer for a few more minutes. Very tasty! Thanks for the recipe!!!

I made this for a workplace potluck and
two people requested the recipe.  Good dish,
however, after chopping up everything it was
not quick.  Suggest robust italian dressing.
Will probably make again.

This was great!  The flavor greatly improves with age - salad was made the night before serving it. I don't really care for canned shrimp so substituted frozen/thawed salad shrimp and to save some time used already cooked and crumbled bacon. I doubled the recipe for a potluck at work and only had a couple of spoonfuls left.  I will most definitely make this again.

I'll have to admit I didn't think this would be very good.  Jambalya cold?  I made this for our Memorial Day cook out and it was a big it.  In fact it was the first thing to go.  Everyone loved it.  It is so quick and easy to make.

This recipe is great as is(except for canned shrimp) but with a few changes it's fantastic. I use 1 family size or 2 reg. size Zatarain's Jambalaya Mix prepared with out adding the shrimp or ham. I use 1/2-1 lb of fresh or frozen shrimp, green onions,and Cajun spice in place of salt. Dependimg on who I am serving I also add cayenne to the dressing. Sometime I add some sliced pickled okra for an authentic Jambalaya.

I used a half-pound of small shrimp and chorizo sausage...my husband loved this, and the rest of us thought it was good.  I'm new to rice salads, but this was a good one to start with.

Love this recipe!!! The only thing I would do different is put salad shrimp in instead of the tiny canned shrimp. Get more shrimp taste but other than that - great.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I agree with others, that it definitely is better the next day.  I had to modify my recipe since I do not eat pork..i saw that someone used kielbasa instead of ham, so i used tureky kielbalsa and turkey bacon.  I aslo used the frozen instead of canned shrimp and Zataran's Creole Seasoning instead of rice as others have done.  I also used brown rice.  It was still excellent!  A keeper.

When I first read this recipe I thought it sounded terrible.  I made it for a family cookout and they all thought the idea of rice being cold was terrible.  I convinced them to try it, and they LOVED IT.  My husband asks me to make it all the time.  I put a little extra chopped tomato in mine.

Great recipe, but use the advice from the reviewers.

1. Do not use canned shrimp (ever).
2. Use Zatarains jambalaya mix for the rice.
3. Replace ham with kielbasa.
4. Replace salt with cajun seasoning.
5. Mix the night before.

I really liked this recipe, it was delicious even though I omitted the bacon and used Cajun seasoning instead of salt. I also added a few large 'langostino' shrimp, to add more seafood flavour. Thanks for this, I will be making it again during the summer.

I used Zatarain's "Dirty Rice" which gives this recipe a ton of flavor.  I also grilled jumbo shrimp with Old Bay and topped the salad with them.  I ommitted the dressing all together.  No need the dirty rice with a ton of Old Bay gave this a real "Jambalaya" flavor.

For our oldest daughters 13th birthday party we had a Luao theme. I was having difficulty finding recipes that could be made indoors and saw this and decided to try it and am glad that I did. Everyone really enjoyed it and it still tastes great after a few days in the refrigerator.

I served this at a women's luncheon.  They loved it! Thanks Louis. I used small fresh shrimp.  I also added 1/4 tsp of cayenne.  Made it a day ahead. The flavors blended nicely.

I don't know, I just couldn't get past the cold jambalaya concept. Being a huge fan of the stuff, I figured I could easily gobble it down. I omitted the bacon, salt, canned shrimp, and ham, but I cooked up two Andouille sausage links and sliced and then quartered them. I also added some Langostino I got from Trader Joe's. To give it a more jambalaya taste, I added Cajun seasoning, and about 1 cup of sliced okra. Something about the dressing didn't quite please my taste buds, and I'm not sure what. It's a shame, because I doubled the recipe so I could take it to work as my lunch all week, but now I don't think I could eat it. Sorry for the poor review Louis; I guess this recipe isn't for me.

I haven't tried this yet, just saw it for the first time,  The picture shows okra, but there is no mention of it in the directions.  Did anyone actually use it? I had to put a rating to post this so it stands for picture not matching recipe not for the taste.

You don't need to chop onion, bell pepper and celery. That is sold in many grocery stores as "trinity mix".  They also usually sell the tomato already chopped as well.  Kielbasa is better than diced ham in my opinion.  I als use VeeTee brand pre-cooked rice; a real time saver and the rice is perfect every time.  I put this salad together in 5 minutes.  It appears there is okra in the picture of this recipe or am I interpreting the picture wrong?

Wonderful, I also used Kielbasa and Zatarans.  However, the picture shows Okra and it is not listed in the ingredients.  I added some that I had frozen, I cooked briefly in the microwave along with the green pepper.  Great dish

Loved it! Shared with our best friends who are from new Orleans and they loved it!!  I did however, substitute the bacon and ham for hot link sausage and it was fantastic!!   The only thing I might change next time is to make it hotter!! But as a Californian was proud to introduce it to them

I expected this to be a bit better than ordinary. I was wrong. It was delicious! I cut the dressing to 1/2 cup; next time I'll use less, because it was oilier than necessary. I used cooked salad shrimp and served it with Tabasco, of course. I'm looking forward to leftovers tomorrow night.

This Salad is absolutely fabulous! I took some of the suggestions such as using Penne pasta instead of rice and I skipped the spices and used a packet of Cajun' Choice Louisiana Foods Cajun Shrimp seasoning Mix, and using Kielbasa instead of ham. It turned out perfectly and will definitely be an addition to my lunch/dinner menu. Thank you!

I haven't tried the recipe yet, but one reason that the picture caught my eye was that it looked like it had okra in the dish.  Reading the ingredients, I see no okra, but I will be adding that for sure when I try this recipe. I'm giving this a 5 without even having made it, my taste buds are already anticipating this salad (with the addition of okra, of course!) This is my very first posting here, please don't rip me apart for giving it a score before trying it, I KNOW that I will like it!

Could I use a pasta instead of rice? in this recipe? Or would that take away 
from it? Hubby doesn't care for rice so I was wondering if I could substitute?
Thanks).
