Very tasty and creamy frosting.  I'd probably use half the sugar next time, or twice the cream cheese.  As written I only got about a cup so double the recipe for a 9" round 2-layer cake.

This Cream Cheese Frosting is verry yummy! I have been making various cream cheese desserts for years now and this is the first one I have found that can be used on any type of dessert, like carrot cake, cheese cake, desserts withc cheese cake fillings, etc. Do yourself a huge favour and try it, its fail proof!! It's number 1 in my kitchen, and as Chef John said add the confectioner's sugar in increments and you will get just the amount of  sweetness/cream cheese balance you  want. Thanks Chef John!!!

Very good frosting that can be used on different cakes because its so basic & simple. I doubled the recipe and adjusted the sugar to taste for my Lemon Cupcakes, therefore I did not add the optional lemon extract. The cream cheese is definitely more pronounced then the sugar and butter, which is exactly what I wanted. 

Kudos to the trusty Chef John who wisely points out that the amount of sugar would vary. Other recipes I looked at list a specific amount of sugar which is a no-no for frosting (IMO). It all depends on your preferred taste palette. Of course, the trick is to add a little at a time, taste and repeat.  Thanks Chef John!

excellent! I did use Madagascar Bourbon vanilla paste which measures the same as vanilla extract and the lemon juice. Very nice consistency but you must beat on high for three minutes to get that fluffiness.

This comes out great and exactly like the video ones. I did everything accordingly. But personally i feel that it is a little too sweet for me. Can lesser the icing sugar to a cup.

This is so delicious I can't say enough. I made this recipe with the lemon juice the first time and the second time I used fresh juice from an orange. It is so good.

I doubled the recipe, because it wasn't very much at all. I also added a little bit of food coloring, and made it pink marble.

This is hands down the BEST cream cheese frosting!  I have always struggled with my cream cheese frostings being a bit too "greasy" but this one is perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly and added the confectioners sugar slowly to get the exact flavor and consistency I wanted.  I piped it on carrot cupcakes and they turned out wonderfully.

I like how this recipe emphasizes to keep adding the icing sugar until you reach your own taste preference.   It's so true about cream cheese icing! Some like the cheese to come out more while others like it sweet.

I changed the cream cheese to 8 ounces and the confectioners sugar to 1 cup.  I just like a more tangy cream cheese frosting rather than so sweet.  Otherwise great recipe.  I would double the recipe for a full two layer cake.

This was a really simple recipe, and it turned out perfect. I doubled it to use a standard 250g package of cream cheese. That was enough to generously cover a 9”x13” carrot cake, with some left over for cinnamon buns tomorrow!

I made a double recipe for a 9 inch 2 layer carrot cake.  With 4 cups sugar used,  I had just a quarter cup icing left over.  Great recipe!

This was the simplest and the best frosting recipe I’ve ever made. It tasted wonderful and it was very creamy. I doubled it to use on 24 cupcakes and there was still some to spare. I confess that I did end up eating a bunch of it plain! I won’t use any other frosting recipes after this one

I'd like to give 4.5 stars if possible, knocking 1/2 star off because I had to double the recipe to put a decent amount on my 13x9" cake. But it is delicious, naturally, can't complain about any of the ingredients! Not too rich and tangy but just enough.

Super good frosting. I slathered it on a red velvet cake. I tripled the recipe but only put 2 cups of powdered sugar plus a tablespoon. Thank you Chef John!

This was a big hit for my carrot cake. Everyone liked that it wasn't too sweet and you could really taste the cream cheese. I doubled the recipe except kept the original amount for the sugar. I filled my pastry tube and then put that in the refrigerator while the cake cooled. It yielded enough for a 6-inch, four-layer "naked" cake with a generous amount for the top and layers plus 6 cupcakes. It pipes beautifully. I posted a reference photo (small cake with chocolate bunny and Cadbury eggs on the top with "naked" sides).

This  is very tasty.

If you plan to double it, use the same amount of sugar that you would use for just 1 batch. It makes it sooo much better!

The flavor is great, but you don't need 1 3/4 cups of powdered sugar.  I used 1 cup and it's still kind of too sweet. I usually cut the sugar by half when I follow an American dessert recipe.

I used the same amount of butter, increased the cream cheese to 2 pks and used 3 cups of powdered sugar.  I did not use the vanilla, but used the same amount of lemon juice. I love it!  It is perfect for my pumpkin bread I am making!

Simply the best cream cheese icing I've ever had. Only change I made was adding a lil more lemon juice than the recipe called for. Originally, there was only a hint of lemon flavor.

It was ok but I felt it was too sweet and didn't have the thick cream cheese flavor I wanted.

This was delicious icing for a pumpkin cake!  The amount of powdered sugar must depend on taste, as he suggests.  I had to add a little more sugar than suggested, as my pumpkin cake wasn't very sweet.  A perfect combination!  Thank you!

I followed the recipe exactly, including adding the optional lemon juice. It was a big hit with all the sweet lovers and even got positive comments from those who usually enjoy savory. The frosting was used on a red velvet cake.

This recipe is a perfect pair with Sam's Carrot Cake. I doubled the recipe, which made it the right amount on two layer carrot cake. Not too sweet, perfect! 
I haven't made a recipe from Chef John I did not like.

This was so easy to make and so incredibly delicious! I didn’t use the lemon juice. Next time, I might add some more cream cheese to give it even more of a cream cheese flavor. It was so good the way the recipe was written, though.

This is perfect cream cheese frosting, but if you're going to seriously frost a cake, you want to at least double it.  Depending on what you're frosting, consider triple.  For me, the best part about carrot cake is the decadent amount of cream cheese frosting and after doubling the recipe for a simple 8" sq. cake, I still needed more.  Other than that, it's definitely 5 star!

Delicious! At least double this. Thick enough to pipe and top 19 cupcakes when doubled. Need to at least triple this for a double layer cake, especially if piping any of the frosting. I quadrupled and had some left over.

I doubled the recipe since I was making a 9" layer cake and I only added 2-1/2 cups total powder sugar rather than doubling to 3-1/2.  It was perfect consistency and sweetness level.

Loved this recipe!!!  I have never made powdered sugar frosting without using milk so this was a pleasant surprise.  It was pretty thick at first but as  I mixed it it became a little more workable.  I plan on using this recipe over and over again.

Beautiful frosting.  It wasn't overly sweet and yet very creamy.  I doubled the recipe to cover a 9x13 carrot cake.  I did not double the optional lemon juice and only put in 2 cups of  powdered sugar.  I am looking forward to trying this again but using orange zest.  Thank you again Chef John for another great recipe.  Yes, we did ENJOY!

Excellent! Followed the advice of other reviewers by adding sugar in increments. 
1 1/4c strikes the perfect balance for me!
Will definitely recommend! Thanks Chef John 
and all!

The lemon in this REALLY makes it perfect. I used this frosting on some blue velvet cupcakes for a baby shower. Several other people,brought cupcakes, their cupcakes went untouched and mine were devoured! The only change I made was I used 8 ounces of cream cheese and only about a cup, cup and a half of sugar. Make sure and taste it as you go along! I wanted sweet frosting to compliment the velvet cake, and that's exactly what it did!!!!

I needed a frosting for an orange cake, doubled recipe for a full sized cake, one teaspoon orange extract instead of vanilla, orange zest, and orange juice instead of lemon. Exactly what I was looking for.

This cream cheese frosting was really good! I doubled the cream cheese and only used 1 cup of powdered sugar, it was the perfect balance between sweet and tangy.

YUM! I would recommend doubling the recipe, though. The recipe as written doesn't make very much. I thought I could taste a little too much vanilla as the recipe is written, so while it was mixing in the stand mixer, I threw in two tablespoons of organic peanut butter, and then it tasted like heaven. I am definitely keeping this recipe.

This cream cheese frosting is wonderful. I think adding the lemon juice gives it a unique flavor. I made a plain box chocolate cake and added the cream cheese frosting. My ten year old granddaughter wanted me to make it for her birthday party and I'm quite sure it was the because of the frosting.

This frosting is light, creamy and delicious.  My only reason to not give it 5 stars is because I personally like more of a cream cheese taste in my cream cheese frosting.  If you prefer a more subtle cream cheese taste, this ones for you.

Thank you so much Chef John!! I have several of your recipes in heavy rotation in my kitchen!  :o)

This was pretty tasty. I doubled the cream cheese and ended up using about 2 cups of powdered sugar. I loved the touch of lemon juice to cut the sweet a bit. Good base recipe.
