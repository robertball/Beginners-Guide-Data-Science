I was going to make my "regular" broccoli sidedish with lunch today but saw this recipe discussed on the exchange and just had to try it.  YUM!  I didn't have the bacon ranch dressing so I added crumbled bacon that I had leftover from breakfast. My mother-in-law wants me to make another pan of this so she can take it home with her today.   If you don't have cream of chicken soup  cream of mushroom would work or cream of broccoli. I am anxious to make this with one of those so my son who is vegetarian can enjoy this as well!

This was great!  Instead of adding stuffing to the top, I added two cups of al dente rice to the casserole instead.  Added the cheese to the top with additional bacon bits because I didn't have the exact salad dressing as the recipie called for.  I also added one cup of chicken.

This would be a great recipe for Healthy Cooking to do a makeover on.  I bet they could make it a lot healthier and still taste as good.

I made this tonight and got hubby's ok to make it again.  I probably will use all broccoli florets next time and chop them to smaller size for a more consistent taste.  I also ended up with a lot of goo/sauce compared to broccoli and even after it baked, it was a little bit too much.  Might try it next time by reducing mayo/sour cream or cut down from 8 oz to 3 oz cream cheese.  But a very creative change of pace!

Made exactly like the recipes states.  I didn't like it at all - way too much "sauce" for such 20 oz. chopped brocolli.  Giving 2* because hubby thought it was pretty good.  I heated it back up the next night and used it as a topper for my baked potato.  That wasn't too bad that way.  I guess I prefer less sauce and more substance.

I am giving it 4 stars because my family loved it, but I didn't care much for it. I thought it was too greasy and not as light as a broccoli dish should be. Maybe it was something I did, because I did make some substitutions but nothing major and actually skipped the cream of chicken and butter.

Good recipe. I did not use the Bacon Ranch dressing. I used cheese on top instead of stuffing.

OMG...Made this last night. Did a little tweaking to cut out some calories..GREAT....Didn't use 1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup (I used a little Knorr's bouillion Powder), or the 1 cup herb-seasoned stuffing mix, (I sprinkled panko bread crumbs on top with the cheese)...It was very pretty and good... hubby liked it, he DOVED back for seconds....we will finish it off tonight...Thank you Peggy..

It was greet I used broccoli florets instead of the chopped broccoli. Made it for Christmas dinner and everyone loved it. Will try to use low fat products next time to make it a bit healthier.Debbie

So I bought a box of broccoli instead of spinach ... only one box.  I thawed it (remember to drain before you use), 1c sour cream,1 egg, 2T ranch dressing, 3/4c cheese, 1/2c plain breadcrumbs mixed w 2T melted butter, s&p.  Left the other ingredients out.  Not bad, but kinda typical broccoli casserole - tasting.  May finish, but doubt I'll make it again.

My family loved this recipe. I left out the ranch dressing and eggs. It was still fabulous. I also used broccoli florets. The next time, I may add corn to it.

Very yummy. Made for thanksgiving one year and had many compliments. This is also a great recipe to tweak according to what ingredients might be on hand.
