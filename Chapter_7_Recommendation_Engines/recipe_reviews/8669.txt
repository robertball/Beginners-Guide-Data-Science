This is very good -- but I'd recommend a few changes.  First, pound the breasts to half-inch thickness at least (this will let you reduce the 30 min cook time to about 15, max).  Then, reduce fat a little by using half butter and half olive oil when you brown (3 tbsp. of each).  Oil will keep the butter from burning, too.  Third, if you want to eliminate wine, just use 1/2 cup chicken broth (from a can, if needed) -- or just use salted water.  No big deal.  Last, when I blend the cream at the last stage, I like to add about 1/4 cup fresh chopped basil to the mix -- serve with chopped fresh basil on top, too - or substitute whatever herb you like (fresh is best, but only add it last).

I made a few changes to this recipe. First, I brushed the chicken with egg and rolled in breadcrumbs instead of flour. Second, I fried the chicken in butter for about 10 minutes until it was nicely browned, then I put it in the oven at 350 for another 20 minutes. Instead of simmering the chicken in the sauce, I whisked the cream,wine, bouillon and cornstarch in a bowl, then simmered it for about 10 min. alone, and spooned it over the chicken.
It turned out fantastic. My fiancee` said this was the best dish I ever made, and he's more of a beef man. Thank you!

I have to add my 5 stars to this one.  I scaled this recipe to 24 for a holiday dinner.  All ages LOVED this meal served with rice pilaf and roasted asparagus and quartered bella mushroomsi. I recommend an oven roasted, no water added ham, and a good quality wine.  After making this again recently, I learned that even a small chicken breast, after pounded and filled, is too large a portion.  My 6 adult guests could only eat half of theirs.  Going forward, I will slice this into 1 inch rounds (much prettier, too) as pictured in photo number 26.  Thanks, Behr.

Not to beat a dead horse, but this dish was fantastic.  4 kids ranging in age from 13 to 7,  my wife and I ate the whole thing.  

I decided to prepare the chicken with an egg wash and bread crumb mixture added the paprika to the bread crumbs and a pinch of garlic powder.  Pan fried in 3 tbs. of butter on all sides and stuck the pan in a 350 degree oven for 20 mins.  Prepared the wine, butter and bullion in a saucepan. Mixed the cornstarch and heavy cream in a separate bowl and added to the wine mixture, stirred with a wisk until it came to a boil and thickened. Sliced the cooked chicken into 1 inch rounds and topped with sauce and fresh parsley.

Served with steamed veggies and noodles and a side salad.  This will be on the table the next time my in-laws and other dignitaries come to town.

Followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect! It was wonderful !!! I did however use deli sliced ham and wrapped the cheese up in it so it would not melt out during cooking. See my photo's - Yummy !!! I will definately be making this again and again. Note: Do NOT sub half and half for heavy whipping cream. You will also want to double the sauce - because it is soooo good - Thank you for sharing your recipe

This is an excellent recipe, but I still prefer the look and texture of finishing it in a 350' oven. 
I use the "smokiest" ham I can buy and spread a little dijon inside the breasts before rolling (the 
"classical" recipe). I also tie the breasts both ways with orange kite string in small bows. They hold
together well and look nice. (And the string never gets lost.)

This chicken is awesome. I exspecially like the white wine sauce. I've tried it with many different wines, and i liked it best with Sauvignon Blanc. Serving it over rice and asparagus makes for a deliciously unified and well-rounded meal. I just tripled the wine and boullion after i took the chicken out and let it cook off a little, then added triple the whipping cream and triple the cornstarch, plus a little paprika for color. Some people point out that the swiss melts out of the chicken, which can be solved by wrapping the swiss in a few thinnly-sliced pieces of ham. This is one of my favorite meals, and it's amazingly easy!

Tastes like the fancy restaurant version. This is wonderful, Behr! The only thing I changed was to substitute 3T garlic flavored olive oil for the butter. Used cooking string rather than toothpicks. Doubled the sauce so we could have some with our steamed aparagus. This wine sauce is out of this world! Next time I'll try rolling the chicken in Panko crumbs.Thanks for sharing.

FANTASTIC chicken recipe!!!!! I've made it several times and the only thing that I do differently is doubling up on the sauce. Which by the way, is out of this world! Try it, I think you'll be very happy you did! Bon Appetite!

Awesome!  I have made this for my boyfriend and friends several times; they say it is restaurant quality.  I bake this in the oven at 350 degrees for approx. 45 minutes, then pour the wine and chicken bouillon mixture on top of the chicken, cover with foil, and continue to bake for another 10 minutes.  The wine just makes this recipe.  Try it, you will not be disappointed!

This recipe is definitely worthy of 5 stars as is and have made it numerous times to validate the rating. However, I couldn't resist experimenting.....  For a little variation, I added fresh spinach, laying it down against the chicken, then the ham, and lastly the cheese to lock it in so it doesn't ooze out as many reviewers have notedl!  Also, instead of adding the paprika to the bread crumbs, I added it to the gravy along with a 1/2 tsp of garlic salt.   NOTE:  To cut down on the fat, I put the chicken straight into the oven, skipping the browning and made the "sauce" on the side.  Absolujtely wonderful!!!!  HELPFUL HINT:  For those of you that live in the state of Texas or the South, try the "Four Sisters and a Brother"  roasted garlic bread crumbs! www.4sistersandabrother.com.    It absolutely made this dish and, no, I have NO affiliation with this site, they just make an amazing product that I can order on-line that enhances the flavor of this recipe....

Okay, the question is to review this recipe, not to change to your ingredients.  If you want to post your recipe, do so, but leave this one alone!

Excellent chicken recipe!  I baked mine in the oven at 350 degrees for 35 minutes.  I also pounded the chicken down first and rolled it in flour then dipped it in egg and then bread crumbs. Everything seems to stick better that way. For the sauce I whisked together 1 cup of cream, 1/2 cup of dry white wine, 2 tsp. chicken bouillon, 1 1/2 tbsp. of cornstarch and 2 tbsp. of butter.

This is a great recipe. My Changes: -I did the suggested 1/2 butter 1/2 olive oil with a small amount of garlic. -When browning I browned one side then removed toothpicks and turned them over (they were done enough to do this) -when stuffing I rolled some of the cheese in the ham to keep from seeping out. -I added a little oregeno to the inside of the breast before adding cheese and ham -I used provolone cheese -I recommend adding parsley to them sprinkled over top for a good look. -Also, when folding I created lips around the ends and then folded in half to keep some cheese in. -I also butterfly the breasts and pound those that are uneven. My girlfriend loves this recipe. Goes great with most anything. Especially roasted rosemary potatoes or a simple white Chedder shells from pasta roni if you want an easy side. Update: I make this all the time now. Instead of using Toothpicks I use Dried Spaghetti! That way it'll cook and you do not have to worry about taking them out or losing them!

This recipe does not deserve 5 stars, it deserves 10!! This was absolutely delicious!! I followed some of the suggestions from others. Found it easiest to cut a slit in the middle of my thick chicken breasts to stuff them, wrapped the ham around the swiss cheese to keep it from oozing out the sides, tied the chicken breasts with string, dipped in egg wash and rolled in bread crumbs, fried on both sides in butter/olive oil mix, removed from pan and put in baking dish and baked at 350 for 30 minutes. At the same time, added chicken boullion and wine to same pan I cooked chicken in and let it simmer while the chicken baked, then added the cornstarch/whipping cream and turned up heat to thicken. This was by far one of the best dishes I have ever made and very easy! 10 STARS!!!

This is a huge hit whenever I make it. I did use some of the suggestions by others: After rolling the chicken up I rolled them in a panko/bread crumb mixture with the paprika instead of using flour and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil when browning the chicken, but after they were browned I took them out of the pan and put them in a casserole dish to finish cooking. I then made the cream sauce using the drippings and ladled it over the finished chicken. You have to make extra sauce... everyone wants more. OH! Also, I tied the rolls with kitchen string I got from my butcher...much easier to manage. I cooked this for my folks on Mothers Day and even my very picky father asked for the leftovers! FANTASTIC! Update: my parents and boyfriend want me to make this for Christmas Dinner for all the relatives... all 30 or so of us!! :-)

I have made this recipe many times and love it each time I made it. The last time I tried it, however, I used proscuitto instead of ham. I didn't like trying to keep the ham rolled up in the chicken and thought the proscuitto would be easier. It was! And the flavor was way better than when I used ham. I also substituted boneless, skinless thighs for the breasts. The boning process makes a perfect place to put the cheese and ham, plus the flavor of the thigh is better in my opinion. Great recipe!!

This was great.  I loved it. My guests loved it. I took other reviewers' tips and used Panko breadcrumbs in place of the flour to coat the chicken, after dipping in an egg wash. I also tied mine up with cotton string (you can cook with 100% cotton string!) This was a lot easier than I expected. I took a lot of pressure off of myself by pounding the breasts out thin and rolling them the night before. I'm glad I did, that took some practice! Definitely fold the cheese into the slice of ham first, make a little pocket.  It kept it from running out of the chicken!

Wow! This recipe is AWESOME!!!  I have never stuffed chicken breasts before, but found the directions to be very easy to follow. The sauce is absolutely fantastic!  I served the remaining sauce (it made a LOT so no need to double) with steamed asparagus and some Uncle Ben's long grain and wild rice on the side. My bf doesn't care for cream sauces and he LOVED this dish also!  Our tummies were full after dinner :) I'll be making this again and again. Thanks for sharing such a wonderful, simple recipe!

Excellent recipe Behr! I cooked this just a bit differently. I cut the butter by less than half and replaced it with evoo. Once the chicken was browned, I added a bit more flour to make a roux. I then added the wine and chicken broth in lieu of the bouillon and some fat free half and half. From there I placed the chicken into a casserole dish and poured the sauce over. I like more sauce than most recipes call for, so I doubled the liquid. The chicken then went into the oven for about forty five minutes. I enjoy the flavors that a low oven produces rather than a simmer on top of the stove. Great flavor, loved by all and thank you!

This is absolutely delicious! As with all recipes, I made a few changes: 1- I decreased the butter to 4 Tbsp. 2- Left it in the skillet only long enough to brown the outside of the rolled chicken. Then, I baked it the remaining time on 350 degrees just until the chicken was cooked through. 3- I only used 3/4 cup of whipping cream and thickened the sauce. We loved it, definitely a make-again recipe!

Oh my!  Scrumptious and savory--you will SWOON over this dish!  I followed the ingredient amounts exactly.  I did change the format:  the chicken breasts I had from the butcher were quite thick, so I did not pound and roll and secure with toothpicks.  I shook the breasts halves in a Ziploc bag in the flour & paprika mixure.  I browned them in the butter, then adding the wine and bouillon.  After simmering them covered for 15 minutes, I placed the ham and cheese slices on top, re-covered, then simmered 15 minutes more.  I followed the recipe directions (I used half & half, and the sauce was perfect) to finish.  Jasmine rice and cooked carrots rounded out this stellar meal.  I truly have to exclaim over the fabulous flavor of the chicken and sauce!  I will definitely make this recipe again, and I will definitely make it when I entertain.

This is truly the best Chicken Cordon Bleu recipe that I (and everyone I've made it for since) have EVER tasted.
The minor efforts involved are rewarded tenfold at the table. This recipe is one-of-a-kind.....Thanks so much for posting, Behr Kleine!

This is a great recipe.  The sauce is excellent.  I didn't fry the chicken in the butter, instead I baked the chicken with breadcrumbs as a coating instead of the flour-paprika mixture.  Came out perfect.  You can also substitute half and half for fewer calories.  A big hit.

Love this recipe, instead of pounding the chicken I actually sliced a hole in the side and put the ham and cheese inside.  This helped with cooking and the cheese didn't melt all over the pan.

I made the recipe just as written and it was great!  But it's even good without the sauce.

I really enjoyed this dish.  It was so yummy and the sauce really added to it.  My finicky eater (my husband) ate most of it (leaving me the rest) so I know he liked it.  I will definitely make this again.

This was amazing, however, like many people, I made a few changes.  First, I pounded the chicken breasts out to about 1/2 in thickness.  Next, I patted each with kosher salt and fresh ground pepper and returned to the refigerator for about 3hrs.  Later, I put a little dijon mustard on the chicken before adding the swiss & ham (I put two pieces of ham on each breast) and then added some fresh basil into each roll as well.  I took the advice of others and added panko breading in place of the flour and fried the chicken in a pan for 10 mins before popping it in the oven for 25 mins at 350.  I also made some changes to the sauce in that I doubled the amount and also added a bit of dijon mustard to the mixture to enhance the dijon flavor from the inner mixture of the chicken.  I served it with baked asparagus with Balsamic and a green salad and my boyfriend said that it was the best thing that he had ever eaten outside of a restaurant!  Will definitely be making again!

I tried this recipe the other night and it was WONDERFUL.  I must admit that I subsituted American cheese for the Swiss (none of the people I was cooking for like Swiss cheese), but it got rave reviews from everyone.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This recipe is great, but classic cordon bleu is breaded with a bread crumb, not flour.  A little hint: if you partially freeze the rolled breast before breading you don't need to use the tooth picks and the whole thing looks much nicer.  I also prefer half and half or even whole milk to the heavy cream - it is just too heavy.  Like others, I prefer to finish it in the oven after browning.

Best thing I ever tasted from my own kitchen...absolutely amazing. I stuffed my "thin sliced" chicken breasts with kraft's extra thin aged swiss cheese slice and prosciutto from the deli. I used progresso garlic herb bread crumbs, panko, and saltine crackers for the breading. Dipped chicken breasts in the flour/paprika mixture, then in egg, then in the breading. Put in pan with 3 TBS each olive oil and butter. Let brown on all sides (~8 min) then put entire pan into preheated 350F oven for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, using a small pan, I dissolved 1 chicken bouillon cube in 1/2 cup chicken broth and 2 TBS butter and added a splash of white wine (sauvignon blanc). Mixed heavy cream and cornstarch together, then added to broth mixture along with ~2 TBS chopped fresh basil. Brought to a boil and whisked until thickened. Served in rounds over "pioneer woman's risotto", topped off with sauce. Next time I will add a side of fresh asparagus. But oh my...absolutely to-die for!

This is a huge hit with my family. I make just a few small changes that have probably been mentioned before. Definitely pound out the breasts to a half inch. It will make your life easier and your presentation better. Second I use a really good smoked paprika. It gives it just a hint of smokey flavor. Last I use a very good aged swiss cheese. Again just adds a richer flavor. Fantastic dish. This is a must for every recipe book!

I liked this recipe a lot. I really used it as a base and changed it as did lots of others. I was afraid the cheese would come out during cooking in the skillet, so I rolled the chicken in home made shake and bake coating mix and baked it in the oven at 400 for 30 minutes. I made the sauce separately, I used 1cup white wine, 1 cup chicken broth, and 1/2 t thyme and reduced it down, then added a can of cream of mushroom soup to thicken it since I didn't have any cream. It was amazing.

Def deserves more than 5 stars.  Restaurant quality with a sauce that's to die for.  I marinated my chicken in buttermilk for a few hours as I do with all my chicken before a meal(1cup milk 1 TBS vinegar or lemon juice if no buttermilk) for that extra moistness.
Then I dipped in flour/paprika which I doubled because the wetness from the buttermilk let the flour stick very well so more was needed.  I let that sit for awhile.  Followed the rest of the recipe as is but used chicken stock(didn't have bouillon on hand)and doubled the heavy cream/cornstarch for more of a sauce and
YYYUUUMMMYYY!!!!  I've made a few different recipes for chicken cordon bleu and this one is def a keeper.
Good Share!

We love this recipe, and I don't really even like chicken. Couple of suggestions - Do not use cooking wine, it tends to make the sauce too salty, where even with a very cheap wine it is excellent. Same thing with boullion, with the cheap stuff, it tends to be more salty, as compared to the good stuff. I always have a hard time getting the toothpicks out, so I tie it with string instead. Usually if the chicken is thin enough you can get away with only cooking for about 20 minutes(less dry). Make sure you constantly stir the sauce while cooking or it will separate. I usually serve this with a salad and either plain egg noodles or rice (wonderful with the sauce). This is one of my husband's favorites.

We really loved this dish.  The sauce was amazing but I made some adjustments.  I tied the rolled chicken with kitchen twine instead of toothpicks.  I replaced 3 tablespoons of butter with olive oil and the chicken browned beautifully.  After adding the wine (Chardonnay) and the bouillon, I covered the skillet and placed it in a preheated oven of 350 degrees for 25 min.  I then removed the chicken from the skillet and placed it on a warm plate and covered it with foil while I prepared the sauce in the skillet on top of the stove.  I substituted half & half for heavy whipping cream.  After the sauce had cooked for several minutes and thickened, I added some lightly sauteed sliced mushrooms.  The sauce was heavenly.  Seriously!  Love this recipe!  (See picture 123)

I love this recipe it's a great starter to use as a base for a great dish. Instead of just flour for mine though I use a mix of flour, seasoned bread crumbs if I have them and some Panko (Japanese bread crumbs). Panko makes the coating MUCH crispier!! I usually season my meat first before coating and for that I use basic salt, pepper and paprika. Also one thing to remember, a dry ham always tastes best! Just ask your deli person for a dry or cured ham.

Awesome!  Doubled ingredients for the sauce and was so glad I did - my guests just loved it.  Made sauce with half and half because it's what I had and only used half the butter and added 2 tablespoons of canola oil because my husbands gallbladder is sensitive to animal fats.  It still tasted wonderful.  I know NOTHING about cooking with wine so I just picked up a $10. 00 bottle of pino grigio.  It worked great - once I figured out how to get the cork out of the bottle :) Ha!Thanks for the terriffic recipe.

Delicious! I spread honey dijon mustard over the chicken after rolling it & covered it in bread crumbs. I Then quickly browned it in 3 tbsp butter & 3tbsp olive oil, then transferred onto baking sheet & baked for 30 mins at 350 degrees. I made the sauce in the pan with the drippings from browning the chicken. 

IT'S AMAZING!!!

Definitely deserving of its reputation. I have tried many hall of famers here and not all of them are worthy but this is.  I pounded the chicken very thin, and since I am not a fan of swiss I used provolone and proscuitto in place of ham. Worked great. Then I rolled and secured with dried spaghetti noodles. Thank you thank you thank you to the submitter who suggested that, it's just about the best kitchen tip I've ever received! I pan fried the chicken in half butter/half olive oil until brown, and preheated (at 350 degrees) a baking dish lined with foil while doing so. Then I baked the chicken for 15 minutes while I simmered the wine (used a $5.00 Pinot Grigio)and bouillon. After about 10 minutes I added the chicken back to the pan, added the cream and then baked for about 5 minutes more. Finally, I removed the chicken, whisked the sauce, and served it. I let my dinner guests top their chicken with as much or as little sauce as they like. Everyone loved it, it was devoured, and my husband told me twice it's the best dish I've ever made. Coming from him, that's a big compliment!And I agree that the wine is not optional. Only leave it out if you really have to.

This dish is AMAZING!  Instead of pounding the chicken, I cut a 'pocket' in from the thick edge of the breast, wrap the ham around the swiss and push it into the pocket so the ham faces the outside...cheese doesn't melt out quite as much :-)

great recipe! i made a few changes, to the flour mix i added a little garlic powder and a dash of cayenne. i used half butter, half evoo to brown chix in. i also used thin sliced prosciutto instead of ham. i also only made 2 chix breasts and not sure how the sauce would've been sufficient for 6. i think i only had enough for 1 more, so i recommend to anyone making more than 3 to double the wine (but not the boullion because it was a little on the salty side) and the starch/cream. while chix was cooking, i did keep taking the lid off and spooning the liquid over the chicken to keep them moist. the sauce is what really made this dish outstanding

This Cordon Bleu is amazing!!  I took the advise of others and baked it in the oven at 350 for 25 mins instead of sauteing.  I simply poured the remaining butter from the skillet into the baking dish along with the bouillion, and wine.  DELISH!

Simply the best Cordon Bleu.  I have an easy trick to eliminate the toothpicks.  After rolling the chicken around the cheese and ham I then roll the chicken in plastic wrap and twist it up really tight like a sausage, forming it with my hands, then twisting the ends of the wrap very tightly and tucking the ends under.  After wrapping I put all the chicken rolls in a large bowl.  I then refrigerate the rolls, in the plastic wrap packages for at least an hour before breading and cooking.  It keeps them all a pretty shape and very uniform in size!  It makes for a very pretty presentation.

i made this last night for company, and all raved!  i only used 4 chicken breasts (4 of us) and kept to the 6 servings for the rest of the recipe (sauce).  took others reviews and did 3Tbl. olive oil & 3 butter - glad i did good flavor, less fat, and kept the butter from burning.  i also tossed in a handfull of slice mushrooms during the simmering..mmm (will add more next time).  next time i will season the chicken a bit more with garlic salt, onion powder maybe a tad red pepper for a bit of a kick..etc.  i will also double the sauce!!  the sauce is what makes this recipe!!!! i tied the chicken with string (much easier than toothpics).  served with steamed broccoli and roasted new potatoes from this site!!!  mmmmm....

This recipe is AMAZING.  I read the reviews and took some of the others suggestions. I did put a little seasoning salt and pepper on my my chicken before rolling. I also doubled the sauce, which is AWESOME.  I used chicken broth instead of wine. I almost used bread crumbs like others suggested, but then I decided to stick to the flour. I am so glad I did because I think the bread crumbs would have been to much and made it a little mushy.  With the flour, you actually get to taste the chicken and not just a bunch of breading. My whole family loved this recipe. I will definitely be making this again.

This was a great recipe! I made the following changes: Spread a thin layer of dijon mustard on chicken before placing the ham and cheese in it. I also dipped in egg wash and bread crumbs and baked. The sauce was absolutely amazing. I included a photo, of the breaded version with cream sauce! I will definately make this again!

I did the eggwash and  then covered the chicken in panko breadcrums. I then pan fried them in 3tbsp of butter and 3tbsps on evoo (extra virgin olive oil) till browned on both sides. I then transfered chicken to a 350 oven for 20 minutes. Chicken came out crisp tender and juicy. I mixed all ingredients for the daydream in a bowl and simmered in a pan till thickened. I cooked mushrooms in a separate pan in don evoo and seasoned them cooking till tender then added to the sauce and simmered another 10. Server with baked parmesan asparagus. My husband said it was the best meal I have ever cooked. Will make again!

I absolutely loved this recipe and my husband did too.  I did alter it just a little.  I marinated the chicken breast in 1/2 C. Worschester Sauce for about 1 hour.  I flattened the chicken pieces I placed a little salt and pepper on each breast I then placed 2 slices of swiss cheese, 3 slices of Virginia Baked Ham (thinly sliced), and 2 slices of mozzarella cheese.  I rolled it all together (I had to hold together with toothpicks) then I beat together 3 eggs and just a couple of tablespoons of milk.  I got yet another bowl and put in the Italian bread crumbs I mixed the paprika with bread crumbs instead of with the flour (I don't think it makes a difference).  I rolled the chicken roll in the flour, then egg mixture and then the breadcrumbs.  I made the rest exactly as is.  It is the best flavor in the world.  As with other reviewers suggested, I did double the sauce and I'm glad I did.  Absolute heaven.

OMG can you say yummie, this is awesome, I did some changes, I didn't use wine, as my husband doesn't like things cooked in wine, read other reviews and used chicken broth and heavy cream, the sauce was awesome, served over rice. Hubby said "this is a keeper" I will be making this again. thank you.

Been making this recipe for 20 + years.  It is excellent.  To cut calories you can use skim evaporated milk instead of the cream.  Als,o I use dry spaghetti to secure the chicken instead of toothpicks.

Absolutely, positively DELICIOUS! I added everything in on here except I substituted the flour for panko bread crumbs and chicken broth for the wine (because I am underage.) I also gave the chicken an egg wash with a squirt of lemon juice and added dried thyme, basil, oregano, parsley, and tarragon. The result was ASTOUNDING. The best chicken I've ever had and the sauce just catapulted it into another echelon of flavor! I'll be passing this recipe on to friends and family!

I have tried this recipe a couple of times with the ingredients listed and it just wasn't what I was looking for. After reading how others have tweaked it, I came up with what works for us. Instead of the flour, I used egg and breadcrumbs. I let the chicken brown for 5 minutes on each side in olive oil and butter then covered and backed it in the oven for 20 minutes. I mixed the cream, cornstarch, wine and bouillon in with the leftover oil. It came out great! I think I'm going to try it with just olive oil next time to make it healthier. Great recipe overall!

Excellent dish! Followed the recipe exactly, except cooked the chicken in the over at 350 for 35 min. Melted the swiss cheese over finished chicken and served over rice pilaf.

The chicken breasts were thick so I would recommend tenderizing/flattening them to about 1/2" of thickness so they roll up nicely.

The finished product was absolutely delicious and restaurant quality!

We've made a similar version of this recipe for years except for instead of rolling the chicken in flour substitue corn starch. You'll be amazed at how much crunchier it gets. Also doesn't get "gummy" like it does with flour. We also cook our fish with corn starch instead of flour.

This was fabulous!  It was so moist and tasty and everyone in the family loved it.  I did make a couple changes but I'm sure that didn't make a difference to how I liked it.  I used rosé wine instead of white as that's what I had on hand and I didn't use cream because we aren't big cream sauce lovers.  Thanks for a great recipe that will become a family favourite.

Absolutely delicious!  I dipped the chicken into egg before coating with the flour/paprika mixture (which I doubled).  I also added about 1 teasp. chicken boullion granuals to the cream sauce.  Cut the chicken before serving like picture #26 and drizzled sauce on top.  Not a morsel was left - My family LOVED it!

I have made this several times now and it is amazing.  I had two meat and cheese only eaters eat all of this with the garlic asparagus from this site and love it.

I have cooked this recipe using the exact instructions several times and it is fantastic. To remove some of the calories, I now use only 1 tbs of butter and I use skim milk instead of heavy whipping cream. It is still excellent. This is really a very quick recipe, if you take a shortcut. Since chicken breasts are usually very thick, I just use a sharp knife to cut them in half horizontally until they resemble a butterfly (don't cut all the way through). Then I place a slice of cheese and a slice of ham on each and fold the chicken back together. It's very easy and no need for toothpicks since you didn't pound the chicken and roll it up. My husband love it and it is a family favorite.

What a fantastic recipe! This one's worthy of even more than 5 stars! I have tried several different Cordon Bleu dishes and this one is the best by far. My husband instructed me to throw away all those other recipes and just keep this one. He said it was not only the best Chicken Cordon Bleu that I've ever made, but the best he's ever had. That's quite a compliment coming from him since he's somewhat of a world traveler and has eaten at some of the finer restaurants. I liked the suggestions of some other reviewers who said to wrap and fold the swiss cheese inside the slice of ham; it worked very well to keep the cheese from oozing out of the chicken. Although this was amazingly delicious, it was however, extremely rich and decadent. Certainly not good for the waistline or the arteries! Next time I will try it with half & half rather than heavy whipping cream. That should make a slight difference! Either way, this is a GREAT dish... Serve it to company and sit back and enjoy the compliments you receive!

YUM. I thought this was a great recipe! I have been trying to watch carbs so this was a great treat for a dish. I pretty much followed the recipe to a t but used pam and a bit of olive oil to brown the chicken instead of butter and just added a couple of tablespoons of a light butter spread towards the end for less fat. I also substituted fat-free half & half instead of the heavy whipping cream to make it a less fattening dish and it turned out beautifully. Ironically for my brother's birthday his wife picked up chicken cordon bleu from a high-end restaurant and my boyfriend thought mine was far better! I had to agree. Thanks for a great recipe, will definitely make again.

This recipe was over the top! I wish I could give it more than 5 stars! This is one of the best recipes I have gotten off this site. The only thing I added was a little minced garlic and fresh ground black pepper and some of the paprika to the sauce - southerners like a kick to their food. The sauce in the recipe could actually go with alot of different things. I made some diced herb potatoes to go with and also dribbled a little sauce over them. Someone mentioned presentation- I thought it was beautiful. 
Bravo! This will be served at my next dinner party.

Great flavor, now if I could only master the presentation. It wasn't the most attractive meal I've ever made.  I used kitchen string because I didn't have toothpicks. I also used half the butter and replace that with EVOO. The sauce was gobbled up by my husband.  I followed another posters suggestion and smeared a bit of dijon mustard on each-I enjoyed that, but my children did not enjoy that factor.

Delicious and easy. I used cooking string instead of toothpicks.  It holds better and you just snip it off before serving!  I also used provolone cheese instead of swiss...worked out fine.

Awesome recipe!  I've made it several times.  I sprinkle the chicken breast with
a few seasoned bread crumbs and parmesean cheese before putting on the ham 
and cheese.  I also use fat-free half and half with a tablespoon or so of sugar
instead of the whipping cream.  It is still fabulous!

Can we just talk about this sauce for a second?  Smooth, creamy and full of a sophisticated depth of flavor.  I could have drank it.  Though I was hesitant to make this recipe without baking it, it was perfect.  Don't change a thing about this one folks.  Yes it's an indulgence in the fat/calorie department, but it's worth it.  I loved every bit of it.  You have to try this one!

Thumbs up on the recipe! I agree with those who fried the chicken in butter and then let it cook nicely and uniform in the oven 30 min 225 degrees centigrade. Now i believe it's important to specify what kind of Swiss Cheese we're talking about! For a thick rich finish i suggest emmentaler or appenzeler cheese, being the first more creamier and softer in text. For a more slender, stronger, saltier and more experimental i tried LeGruyere cheese and it was awesome! For the ultra special ocassion i tweaked it with Sbrinz or Fribourg cheese!

Followed the directions as given, and it was fabulous!  Using the kitchen twine made it much easier to keep them together, and allowed me to cut them into medallions and serve with the sauce drizzled along them for a nice presentation.  Will make this again in the future, maybe when we have friends over!

I have to admit I was worried that I wouldn't like the sauce for this, but it turned out to be the perfect complement to the cordon bleu! I've never made cordon bleu before so I had a bit of a time with it, but it's not as difficult at it seems. String really helps keep everything together. I followed other reviewers suggestions and pan fried it until browned, then threw it in the oven at 350 F for 20 mins. Simmered the sauce on the stove until slightly thickened, then poured it over the chicken and the rice served with it. Pounding the chicken well is really important too!!

This was delicious. I added a half-cup of chicken broth (since I didn't have granules) and used the leftover coating flour in a bit of water rather than the cornstarch to thicken, and baked them in the oven after browning since my skillet is only big enough for 3 breasts. 20 minutes at 350 and they were just lovely.

I brushed the chicken with a butter and salt mixture, then sprinkled with paprika before layering the ham and Swiss cheese.  After rolling and securing with toothpicks, I brushed each piece with egg and rolled them in seasoned bread crumbs.  Instead of frying in a pan, I baked the chicken in a 350 degree oven for 40 minutes and made the sauce separately on the stove top.  It turned out great!

I agree with the reviewer who said this tastes like a fancy restaurant dish.  It is excellent, and is one of my family's favorites.  I make Fettuccine Alfredo to go with it.  The only thing I do different is wait until the chicken is almost done cooking, and I put the Swiss cheese on top to melt.  Otherwise, I have a problem with the cheese leaking out into the pan.

I followed the recipe pretty closely, but took others advice and rolled the cheese up inside the ham, then rolled that up inside the chicken breast. That way I had pretty much no leakage at all. I also pounded the heck out of the breasts to make them nice and thin. I browned the chicken in 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil, as the butter might have burned otherwise. I then transferred the rolls to the oven to finish cooking while I made the sauce. The other thing I did different was I used 1/2 panko bread crumbs and 1/2 flour for the breading, as I like a bit of crispiness. The final thing I did differently is I put sauce on the individual servings as I plated them. This way,the breading was not soggy (or as soggy as it would be if the directions were followed), and it still had a nice little crunch. When I stored the leftovers, the sauce and chicken were stored separately and plated the same way when served. Thank you for this recipe, as everyone loved it!

The best we've ever had ANYWHERE!  Some tips: I hate pounding chicken breasts, so I filet them instead by firmly holding the breast flat on the counter with the palm of my hand then sliding my very sharp knife through horizontally to get 2 equally thin "filets" that wrap and roll perfectly.  Also, I cut my swiss cheese right off the block into a little rectangle, fold thinly sliced deli ham around it, then wrap the chicken breast around the nice tidy package of ham and cheese.  It works like a charm. I think the spiral created by layering slices is prettier, but for my family, I go for ease of preparation!  I like to roll and dip in flour earlier in the day, so the coating has time to "set" before frying in butter.  It's delightful.  SO good.

I made this recipe recently and it was a hit. I served it with rice, green beans, and bisquits. I did a few things different... I after rolling and putting tooth picks in chicken i dipped it in egg with milk mix, then i coated with a mix of bread crumbs, paprika, and flour. i cooked it in half butter half olive oil. although i think next time im just going to use olive oil butter browns chicken too fast. After browning the chicken i put the chicken in a separate pan and put it in the oven on 350. i combined wine, chicken bouillon, cornstarch, and whipping cream in same frying pan used for chicken whisking until thickens on a medium heat. I dbl the recipe for the sauce. After cream thickens take out chicken from oven and pour half the sauce on the chicken. put left over sauce in gravey boat to serve seperately. some people like more sauce than others. i put the sauce on my rice too. the sauce was sooo good. Great recipe!!

I just made this dish tonight. It was a huge success with the entire family. I doubled the sauce and added fresh chopped parsley but other than that I followed the recipe and steps exactly. Everything turned out perfectly and I will most definitely be making this again soon. It was the first time I made Chicken Cordon Bleu and was not as hard as I thought it would be. Picture 121 :)

Ignore the people who say "only make this with heavy whipping cream", excellent results can be had with 1/2 and 1/2 as well.

I made this recipe but modified the sauce a little because I didnt have the ingredients.  And breaded and baked the breasts as other reviewers suggested instead of simmering in sauce.  It was very simple and fast to make.  20mins in the oven.  I used cream of chicken soup....I would rather have not but its what I had on hand.  I thinned it with 1/2 wine 1/2 water to a saucey consitency.  It was not amazing but good for such and easy, inexpensive, fast meal.

MIND BLOWING. My husband proclaimed this as the best dish I have made to date, and he insisted on seconds! Definitely worth a try. I didn't have white wine, so I used the same amount of chicken broth instead. I also sprinkled fresh chopped parsley over the chicken and cream right before serving.

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  The only changes I made were to use boneless pounded thighs ( a personal preference) and after rolling the chicken bundle in flour, I dredge it in a beaten egg and then re-roll in the flour mix before browning.   I would recommend doubling the sauce, it is absolutely delicious over rice, pasta or potato.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

AMAZING!  I cut a pocket in regular boneless chicken breasts and stuffed the ham and cheese inside.  I also didn't have any cream, so I used 1% milk, a little more corn starch and some chicken broth.  The chicken melted in your mouth!  Can't wait to make it again!

My family loves this recipe! It does take some time to put together, but it is well worth the effort. I do as others suggested. I began by butterflying the chicken breast (that means to cut the chicken horizontally in half but not going all the way through the meat), lay it out flat, then pound it out to make the thickness uniform. I spread the inside of the chicken with dijon mustard, rolled the cheese inside the ham and placed on the chicken breast, then tucked the sides of the chicken in and rolled it up (like you're rolling a burrito). I secured each piece of chicken with toothpicks until I could tie each individual chicken breast with kitchen twine and then took the toothpicks out (it's much easier to remove twine than toothpicks after the chicken is cooked). I tossed the chicken in flour with paprika, and some garlic and onion powder. Browned all sides on the stove in a stainless steel pan in equal parts of oil and butter, then placed the whole pan in the oven at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes. When the chicken was done, I put them on a platter and lightly covered with foil. Drained a little of the oil/butter from the pan, then proceeded to make the sauce with white wine, 1 Tbs of butter,  and 1.5 tsp of chicken base. Whisk and let reduce for a few minutes. Then added half and half with cornstarch and let  thicken. Really .. you gotta try this!

I've made this time and time again.  It's one of our favorites.  We usually make it for birthdays or special occasions.  Absolutely delicious.  The only thing I vary is substituting a chicken bouillion cube for the granules, as I usually only have the bouillion on hand.  We serve it over steamed white rice.  Delicious!

Great tasting.  I used unsalted butter since ham and cheese are already salty.  I also used half and half instead of cream but it wasn't as thick as I'd have liked.

Wonderful!! I added extra cream sauce with sliced mushrooms and a pinch of salt. Tip!! Don't use extra Sherry unless you want it to really taste like wine. Only double the cream, not the sherry and you'll be fine if you like extra sauce.

I am not really rating this recipe, as I haven't tried it, but I plan to and will honestly rate it then. It looks delicious! I am, however, a bit disturbed about the video, which depicts using tongs to place the raw chicken into the skillet, and what appears to be the same tongs to turn the chicken and then take the cooked chicken out of the skillet and place it on the platter, thus allowing for the possibility of contamination. Personally, I never use the same utensils to handle raw chicken and cooked chicken without a thorough cleaning/sanitizing step in between. I'm not trying to be a pain...just trying to protect the health of my fellow allrecipes members. I'll leave 5 stars here now just so I can post this, as I do not want to ruin Behr's ratings, as Behr is not responsible for the video. I would normally have a glass filled with a water/bleach solution handy in order to sanitize the tongs between contacts with the food.

Literally just finished eating this and it was phenomenal. I followed a few suggestions i found in the comments (coating the chicken with breadcrumbs, pan frying it for 10 minutes, baking it for 45 minutes, and  spooning the sauce (white wine, cream, and bouillon) over it after cooking) and it turned out great. I also put paprika into the sauce which gave it quite a nice flavor. I would also suggest using twine to keep it all together I will definitely make this again! Five Stars!

Absolutely Delicious!! My fiance wasn't too excited when i told him i was making Chicken Cordon Bleu. As soon as he tasted this he couldn't believe how great it was. I followed the recipe exactly as stated except for the wine, I used chicken stock as another reviewer stated and it was perfect!!! I will definitely be making this again very soon...

Yum Yum!!  I looked at the sauce  ingredients and thought it was going to be bland but it wasn't at all!  I used Sauvangion Blanc and am able to get the mini bottles.  A mini bottle was about 2/3 of a cup so I added the whole thing.  Both myself and my husband enjoyed this alot, cooked it just as is execpt only 4 pieces of chicken.  Will make again but with the heavy cream only once in a while!

This was fabulous and my husband loved it.  I did bake the chicken in a 350 degree oven for about 25 minutes after browning as other reviewers had suggested.  The sauce with this dish was very good!

I started by reading the low ratings and the key complaits about the recipe were that the chicken was bland and the cheese poured out of the chicken and ruined people's pots :). So, with this info, i first marinated the chicken pieces for about 5 hours (doesn't need to be as long). I marinated both sides of the breast with some seasoning salt, black pepper, red pepper and some curry powder. To deal with the melting cheese, I folded the cheese slice in half and sandwiched it between 2 ham slices (folded in half facing each other) and folded the ends of the ham - that way the cheese was completely well contained within the ham - to act as barrier to melting cheese. I also used a non-stick pan - so no mess to clean up afterwards. For the sauce i eliminated the cornstarch (coz i didn't have it) but i used 35% cream so it was thick enough. 

The end result? Absolutely AMAZING!! So flavourful! I'll definitely make this dish again - with the little modifications i made. One thing i found quite frustrating was dealing with the toothpicks. I guess my breasts weren't as big - even after pounding. So i had to use lots of toothpicks which i then had to then trim so the chicken can make contact with the pan surface. I will try the string instead next time.

Maybe it was all the rave reviews about the sauce but I had really high expectations for it and I feel it fell short.  It just seemed like a good gravy with a bit of wine flavor.  Hubby loved it, I just found it ok.  Will do it again because of hubby.  I did like how the chicken itself turned out and would do it again but maybe make a different sauce.  I also found I had to add more cream then required because it thickend up so fast but still had a starchy flavor to it.  Not bad but was expecting more because of all the reviews.

This was excellent!  I have always loved this dish.  Rick prepared it having never seen or eaten it before.  The only change was grinding up 2 bullion cubes (didn't have granules) and used semi-sweet wine in place of dry wine.  It was a little difficult to secure it and some of the swiss cheese oozed out which made the sauce outstanding!  Will make it many times.

I made this for my parents, who are somewhat picky eaters. It turned out great! The hardest part is getting the toothpicks out after you've already cooked the chicken.

Just made this tonight...soooo good! I also did an egg/bread crumb wash (with paprika) before cooking. Threw in the cast iron skillet with 3tbs butter and 3 tbs olive oil. Cooked each side. I think the heat was on too high because it definitely started to brown too quickly. Put pan into 350 oven for 20 minutes. Meanwhile mixed together the wine, bouillon, heavy cream and cornstarch and cooked in a separate pan for about 10 minutes. Again, not sure if I did something wrong here cus the sauce was kinda separating. Still tasted amazing though! 

All in all, despite my issues with the browning of the chicken and the consistency of the sauce, it was cooked perfectly and tasted like perfection. Big raves from the husband.

Served with "Pan Fried Asparagus" - another yummy staple for the kitchen!

This is our favorite ever! I use just regular whipping cream instead of the heavy and I use cooking white wine just from the grocery store. Still tastes absolutely amazing!

Very Good. We did not have any left overs. In place of white wine I used chicken broth and did not add the chicken bouillion granules. I started by using a little more then half the can to cook the chicken in, and ended up putting more in as it cooked. This was nice because it made the sauce go farther, which we put over mashed potatoes. Also I did not have whipping cream, so I just used regular milk. Still tasted great. I did add spinach to the sauce also. very Good.

Easy and delicious!  The only changes I made were to add 1/4 t of salt to the flour mixture and use chicken broth instead of granules.  Thank you Behr!

Wonderful!!! Changes I made: used double ham and cheese (alternating), dipped in egg, sprinkled with smoked paprika and then in corn flake crumbs. I fried in 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil and then after browned put in 350 oven for about 20min to finish. crispy and perfect!!!! also added the smoked paprika with salt and pepper to the sauce. It's a keeper.

This was a big hit, and not too difficult to pull off.  I did double the sauce and I baked the chicken after browning it on all sides as suggested.

Changed it a bit, didn't pound out chicken and cooked longer and just placed ham and cheese on top and meted the cheese.  SO GOOD!

Really liked this recipe. The sauce is fantastic! The prep is a little time consuming, with the pounding and assembly, but not difficult. Chicken rolls could be assembled ahead of time and then proceed with cooking when needed. I sprinkled lots of chopped fresh parsley over the finished dish to give it some color; otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing. Delish!

I made this tonight for my husbands birthday dinner....it was a big hit...I am just beginning to cook more for the family and they all loved it...even my 3 year old at it...which is saying a lot...I was a little scared of using wine in my cooking but it was very yummy...I did however, brown the chicken and then bake it in the oven for 25 mins at 350 degrees...I added some onions and garlic with the chicken when baking and then drained out the onions at the end (my kids don't like onions if they see them)..then I used all of those juices in with the sauce...very very yummy...will make again!

Very good! The sauce is the clincher. It is simple to make and tastes wonderful. It even stands up to substitutions such as dilute white wine vinegar in place of wine and olive oil in place of butter.

Not sure if I missed the mark on this one but this recipe was so bland.  I make every recipe on this site exactly as stated so that I can give a proper review versus reviewing it based on all these "alterations." This would've tasted way better had i put the sauce on. Easy to make though! I'm almost too turned off by the result that I don't even want to try the "alterations" others have suggested...

This is awesome... I took advice on other reviews and doubled my sauce, brushed my chicken with egg and I baked mine in the oven....I added mushrooms to the sauce and used Kendall Jackson Sauvignon Blanc........ I made Bacon Wrapped Asparagus as a side... my husband said this is a 5 star, I agree..... will definitely make again......

OMG, this was so delicious!!  The wine sauce is amazing...don't leave out the wine as some people suggest.  I followed the recipe with the exception of these few small tips that I think helped make it better:

1. After I pounded the chicken thin and rolled up the ham and cheese, I put the chicken rolls into the refrigerator for about 15-20 minutes to firm them up.  This way I didn't need toothpicks and the chicken stayed together
2. I also added salt, pepper and garlic powder to the flour.
3. I used only 1 tbsp of butter plus a couple tablespoons of olive oil to brown the chicken to lighten it up.
3. I finished the chicken in a 350 degree oven after it was browned rather than in the saute pan.  The chicken stayed really moist!
4. I poured off all but a tablespoon of the butter/oil to start the sauce so it wouldn't be greasy.
5. For the sauce, I doubled the wine, cooked the sauce so that it reduced after I added the cream and I added some fresh parsley at the end.

This dish was a major hit!  It wasn't difficult and I plan on making this for my next dinner party.

I love this dish. I've made it several times per the recipe, and with the occasional tweak. This last time I made it with smoked Gouda and prosciutto instead of the ham and Swiss and panko instead of bread crumbs (seasoned flour, egg, then seasoned panko, drizzle with butter then bake 350 for 45 min) I also added some of the smoked Gouda to the wine sauce....delicious!

This is a great recipe.  I have made it for years and always get requests.  I used white cooking wine instead and use half and half.  You don't get the strong alcohol taste but you don't miss any of the flavor as well..   I also finish mine off in the oven.

So easy I made it twice in the same night! One pan for my family for dinner and a second to take to my parents. Decadently yummy! I had really thick breasts, so I sliced them in half and then pounded down. I used a mixture of butter and olive oil to sear. Added the wine and chicken granules and let it simmer for about 10 minutes and then put the meat in a 350 oven to finish them off for 20 minutes. Finished up the sauce on the stovetop. Magnificent! Would definitely serve this to company.

Superb flavor!  The sauce could use a bit sprucing up, but everything else is delicious.  Be sure to use thin-sliced ham and thin-sliced chicken breasts.

This is an excellent recipe.  It looks fantastic and it really isn't that hard to make!  One thing I like to make with it is a nice white wine reduction to offset the savoury/saltiness of the chicken and ham. Yum

Instead of flour, I coated the chicken breasts in whisked egg and then breadcrumbs, otherwise followed the recipe as stated. Came out quite yummy! Chicken was tender, sauce was very tasty. I must say our sauce turned out somewhat brown after we added it to the saucepan after cooking the chicken (I hope this was what we were supposed to do!) and I note on the picture the sauce appears white? Or are we meant to cook the sauce in a separate pan?

This is a delicious recipe that I tweak just a little bit. Instead of ham, we use prosciutto. Also, you can make a little extra sauce to put over noodles or rice. Delicious!

This was outstanding!!  I have never cooked with wine (I usually just substitute chicken broth) and was a little unsure about the taste, but decided to trust the reviews the dish has gotten.  I wasn't even sure where to find the cooking wine (I started by the regular wine, but it was actually by the vinegar).  
I secured the chicken with cooking string and it worked well.  I made 7 breasts and the only thing I adjusted was the flour and paprika mixture, I doubled it and only had a little bit that didn't get used.  I was making this for guests and I don't like to have a mess in the kitchen when guests arrive or be slaving over the food, so I decided to make this up and transfer to a casserole dish and keep in the oven.  (I removed the string before putting it in the dish.)  It ended up being in the oven for about 30 minutes at 300.  It was perfect!!  I served it with wild rice and roasted asparagus.  Everyone cleaned their plates and raved about how good it was.

The wine gets absorbed into the chicken while cooking, and the flavor is fantastic! The sauce is so creamy and had a nice tart, yet mellow, sweetness that almost made it taste like cheese sauce. I did have a lot of trouble removing the toothpicks at the end, and my picky husband complained that he did not like that the chicken could have been crispier in texture if I had not simmered it in the wine. The sauce was also not completely white and perfect-looking because of the chicken drippings in the pan, which really enhances the flavor, but did not make as good a presentation. I have since made this again with the following changes; I butterflied the breast halves because I do not have a pounder, and the meat stayed together and cheese stayed in and I could get the toothpicks out just fine; dredged chicken in a mix of egg and milk and used half flour and half bread crumbs to coat, added 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp onion powder and 1/8 tsp garlic powder to flour mixture as well as paprika to try and replace the lovely wine flavor, saute'd the meat seperately from the sauce in butter and olive oil, mixed all sauce ingredients and simmered in a seperate pot untill mellow in flavor, I used jarlsberg cheese because I couldn't find swiss. Though the chicken wasn't quite as flavorful, it still turned out a five star recipe only husband had no complaints! We both loved it, what a keeper! This will also make a fancy dinner for company. Thank you!

Delicious! I tried both the stovetop and oven methods (10min on stovetop, 20min in 350 oven) and they were both great!

This chicken was absolutely delicious!!!! I followed some of the top rated advice and tied the rolled breasts tightly with cooking twine instead of pinning them with toothpicks. I browned the chicken in skillet on all sides with butter AND OIL.  The butter started to burn on it's own, but a little olive did the trick. Then I baked them at 350 for 20 minutes.  I made the sauce in a separate pan with about a tsp of the flour/paprika.  I think using wine is important, otherwise the sauce would just taste like chicken gravy (and I'm not a wine drinker). I used a Sauvignon Blanc per suggestion. My DH said it could easily pass for a 5 star restaurant meal. This dish was a lot of work, but definite worth it!

So yummy I had to go for a second walk today to make up for this decadent dinner!  Followed directions for chicken as written, but took a major shortcut for the sauce because I lack patience :).  After browning chicken in pan poured in some chicken stock, covered and let it cook for 20 minutes.  Removed chicken and stirred in two big spoonfuls of the new Philly garlic flavored cooking cream.  Amazing flavor.  Feel like I need another walk just writing about this excellent dish.

This was a FABULOUS recipe!  My boyfriend loves chicken cordon bleu sandwiches, so I thought I would make the real thing for him.  He and I both loved it!  It was a little hard to roll the chicken, ham and cheese up.  I think next time I will have to flatten the chicken out more.  Otherwise it was delicious!!!!

This is the most amazing recipe!  Yum!  I even converted to gluten free by just breading the chicken in my gluten free flour blend!  Couldn't have tasted any better!

This chicken was great. Made for family of 5 (kids ages 6-8) and everyone enjoyed! I made my own bread crumb mixture: bread crumbs, garlic powder, paprika, ground mustard, pepper, and curry powder. I also fried the chicken in butter/Canola oil mix.  The sauce was great, I probably used a little more than 1/2 cup of wine, too. Enjoy!

I pounded, rolled, and tied the chicken. I dipped the rolls into melted butter and rolled them in panko crumbs. I also opted to brown the rolls in the pan and finish in the oven. I made the sauce in the pan. 

Awesome meal!

This was fabulous! I did have to make some changes simply because I did not have everything. Since I did not have wine or bouillon I used 1/2 c. of low sodium chicken broth - otherwise I followed. This was absolutely delicious!

This is SOOOO good! I made this for the first time on Valentine's Day for our family dinner. I bought huge chicken breasts. I found a little trick to keep the cheese from melting out,,,wrap the ham around the swiss then the chicken around the ham. Keeps it from leaking.They were so juicy and creamy. Also you can use chicken stock and not the wine if you dont keep it on hand or like wine. I like this recipe cuz your dont have to heat up the oven and use the cook top both. I live in the deep south and dont like using the oven in the hot months!!.Thanks to who ever posted this recipe. It was a huge hit with my family of picky eaters.

I must admit that I used this recipe as a base for what I did!  I started to roll my chicken and it kept unraveling so I decided to change it up!  I pounded my chicken, flour and fried my cutlets in 1/2 olive oil 1/2 butter.  I added the wine and chicken boullion to the pan.  Then I added grated Guyere cheese and topped with with ham slices on each cutlet.  I took the entire pan and put it in the oven at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes to finish the cooking.  When the juices ran clear, I took out the chicken, plated it and took my used pan to make the sauce following the recipe with the exception of using 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream (only because I didn't have any cream!).  The sauce, the flavors, everything was wonderful!  I will definitely be making this again!  Thanks!!

I made this for my husband and he loved it.  Im not really a good cook but I can follow directions and I will say I added a little cayenne pepper & fresh garlic when I wrapped the chicken just to give it a little kick and it was perfect.  Thank you to who ever came up w/ this recipe.  It was a big hit in my house tonight. :-)

My family including my wee picky eater gobbled this down.  Yummy! I used a little bit of advice from each of the reviews. This is what a added to the original recipe. First I slathered dijon mustard on each of the pounded breasts.  I also used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil and then after browning finished in oven at 350. I also made my sauce seperately and drizzled over sliced halfs.  But I added my own little variation....A squirt of dijon to the sauce also. I always read all the reviews and take all the best ideas from each and then expand on that if possible.

This is a great recipe, as is!  There is plenty of extra wine cream sauce in the pan after you pour it over the chicken.  I put it in a gravy boat and let my guests pour more over their chicken as they desire.  Don't over cook the chicken.  30 minutes of simmering is plenty!

To. Die. For. So delicious that everyone in this picky family LOVED it. This is a first at our house. I did double the sauce and add some season salt, garlic powder and fresh cracked pepper to the flour. But other than that followed it to a "T". This is going into the rotation.

So delicious. Meat was tender and juicy. I was concerned, as I used "lunch meat" ham, but i just used two pieces to make sure it was thick enough. Wrapping the cheese up in the ham helped keep it from leaking everywhere. Will definitely make again!

I have made these several times, and I always get rave reviews! Any leftover rolls get sliced carefully, rolled in a bit of egg/herbs/breadcrumbs mix and baked again quickly on high heat. Best chicken nuggets ever!

My husband and I have been making this recipe for years now.  We follow the recipe for the most part.  It is a little time consuming but worth it.  It is a favorite in our house! Update 1/1/2016 - we are still making this wonderful recipe five years later.  It is a definite favorite in this house by all!  We follow the recipe almost to the letter, maybe add a little extra of an ingredient here and there. We use cooking twine instead of toothpicks.  I recommend this recipe quite often.

My husband was requesting chicken cordon bleu and to our delight I settled on this recipe. First I pounded the breasts thin. Based on another reviewer's suggestion, I added mustard between the cheese and ham, but it wasn't necessary. There is already plenty of bite from the swiss cheese and wine. I dipped the rolled chicken in the egg and then coated it with seasoned Panko before frying in olive oil. I baked in a 350 oven until it reached 160 degrees - about 30 minutes.  I was out of whipping cream so I used evaporated milk.

This recipe was definitely a hit. Chicken Cordon Bleu is one of my all time favorites, but it always seemed daunting to try to make it. I found this recipe, and altered it to make it a hybrid of the original and some tips from other users (ie, giving it an egg wash before coating it in flour and spice as well as browning the chicken for 10 minutes before baking it for 20)  The end result was a delicious, cheap meal. I served it with rice pilaf and broccoli. Love this recipe, I would recommend trying it to anyone.

This was pretty good! I did what others did and dipped in egg then in bread crumbs. This sauce is what makes this! I did not have any heavy whipping cream so I just replaced that with some sour cream and milk. sounds gross but worked out great as a substitute.Thanks Behr! Wonderful!

Very good recipe.  I did make a few easy adjustments. I coated the chicken in the flour mixture, egg, and panko bread crumbs-- Fried until golden brown in the butter.  Then I transferred the chicken breasts to a baking dish and baked until reaching 160 degrees- about 35 minutes.  I doubled the sauce and poured it over the chicken during the last 10-15 minutes of baking.  Chicken was very moist and delicious.

Outstanding!!!  I know a recipe is a hit when my six year old tells me it's awesome.  I used 3 large chicken breasts rather than 6 and left all other ingredients the same.  (These are so filling I had one each for my husband and I and split one for the kids.)  We had the perfect amount of sauce to put over the chicken and rice that I served it with, so if you're making 6 chicken breasts I'd double the sauce.  My only other deviations were to use Provolone cheese (didn't think the kids would like Swiss) and to take the chicken from the pan after it was browned on all sides and bake it in the oven for 30 minutes while I prepared the sauce and my other sides.  Also, I'm not a wine drinker so I used white cooking wine rather than drinking wine and the sauce was delicious.

Rave reviews from all who ate it...will definitely be an "in-law" meal!  I only had three eating, so used three chicken but kept the sauce the same...double the sauce was perfect...although, I probably could have used even more!  It is sooooo tasty!  I browned the chicken in butter and then placed the chicken in a baking pan and baked at 350 for 25 min while I made the sauce.  After chicken was done, I added any juices that came from the baking to the sauce, and added the chicken to the sauce, scooping it on top.  I then served with rice and seasoned potatoes.  Looking forward to trying again with a bit more sauce and asparagus!  Num!!!

This turned out so good! I read some of the reviews and wound up coating the chicken in bread crumbs and pan frying for 5 min each side and then baking the chicken until it was done.  The sauce I cooked separately and poured on the chicken after it was done. This was one of my fav dishes so far.

For a simple recipe, this is really tops in terms of taste. My family loved it. I made a few modifications though: I subbed some olive oil for some of the butter, I added two cloves of minced garlic when I added the bouillon, and I used about a cup of white wine because I knew this sauce would be delicious and that we would want more of it. The leftover sauce is really fabulous over pasta the next day for a quick and easy lunch. This is definitely a keeper!

Very good! The sauce is incredible.  I did find that my butter looked burned and gross and browning the chicken.  I started over with fresh butter in a fresh skillet before adding the wine and bouillon.  I also felt that the flour mixture was not enough to coat 6 breasts.  I made 2 breasts with the flour/paprika... They turned out okay.  I dipped the other 4 breasts in an egg wash and then into a flour/paprika/breadcrumb mixture... They turned out deliciously and looked much better than the breasts without the egg wash and breadcrumbs.  I finished off in the oven on 350degrees for 15-20 minutes.  Yum!

If I could give this more stars I definitely would!  This dish is absolutely fabulous.  The sauce is to die for.  One recommendation I would give to anyone thinking of making this is DOUBLE THE SAUCE! It is great to have extra to serve over rice, noodles, potatos or whatever.  I will be adding this into my normal rotation of recipes. Definitely something we would eat often.

I've been making this recipe for years.  It's sensational.  I find cooking for 20 minutes instead of 30 keeps the chicken from drying out.  The next best tip I can offer:  you don't need to use toothpicks, twine or anything else to hold the chicken together, just make sure when you brown the chicken that you first place the chicken seam-side down.  Later on, when simmering, also make sure chicken is seam-side down.  A small amount of the cheese will ooze out, but that's what makes the sauce extra delicious!  Adding a half slice of the cheese to the sauce is a terrific addition, also.

I just have to add in my 5 stars to the list of stellar reviews… this recipe is delicious with the cream sauce! I used cooking twine to tie the chicken breasts, browned in a skillet and transferred to a baking dish.  I covered with the sauce and baked at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes.  I used half and half rather than heavy cream and added fresh basil and fresh parsley to the sauce- absolutely fabulous!  I will definitely add this recipe to my list of “keepers”- very easy yet impressive!

The sauce is amazing! The chicken turns out much more moist and is less likely to blacken if you brown it in a frying pan for 10 minutes and then bake it for 20, as other members have suggested.

I had given up on Chicken Cordon Bleu a few years ago.  I hated the nightmare of the rolling and browning, and I found the results less than impressive.  But, I was in a school-night dinner pinch and needed to use up some sliced ham, so I decided to give it a go.  This turned out great!!  I did change up the cooking method a bit - like I said, I hate the rolling.  So instead, I coated the chicken with the flour and paprika and browned it in the skillet, then transfered to a baking dish, layered the ham and cheese on top, and baked at 375 for about 20 mins.  Meanwhile, I made the sauce separately.  Dinner was made - start to finish - in about 30 mins!  This was so easy, fast (with my cooking method), and delicious!  The sauce was out of this world!  I'm making Cordon Bleu again!

This is my first review as a member on Allrecipes and I actually created a membership just so I could rave about this recipe! I have made this a countless number of times and it is absolutely wonderful! Everyone of all ages in my family loves this recipe. I normally make as the recipe calls for. However, there have been a few instances when I didn't have the wine and just used chicken broth instead. It is best with the wine, in my opinion. The only thing I want to add is that it is easier to use skewers broken in half than it is the toothpicks. The toothpicks are hard to get out. Everyone should try this! It is wonderful!

We really liked this dish!  I used shredded Swiss (what I already had) on the chicken breast,then some shaved ham and then a little shredded mozzarella. Rolled it up and secured with toothpicks. Like another reviewer suggested, I browned the chicken in butter after dredging in flour and paprika, until nice and golden, about 10 minutes.  Then I baked in a 350 oven for 20 minutes. I whisked the wine and cream, bouillon and cornstarch separately, and simmered in a small saucepan for 15 minutes. After thickened a bit, I ladled a little over the chicken for the last 10 minutes. I served the rest of the cream sauce in a gravy boat. Wonderful!  Really not labor intensive, but looks so gourmet!  Thanks for a great recipe. One more thought... Chicken came out very moist and tender, not dry as some have suggested. Very nice!

This was delish! I did cook it in the oven (covered with foil) after I browned the chicken. I added the wine and some chicken broth with the cream into the pan I browned the chicken in. Then I poured the sauce over the chicken and baked it for about 45 minutes. Yum!

This was my 1st try making chicken cordon bleu & I was a little intimidated but this recipe with very easy & turned out great. Me and my boyfriend loved the sauce. I also cut the chicken in half instead of pounding it out. I may add a little more ham & cheese next time. Its great though.

Let's face it: the sauce is getting all these 5 star reviews, not the chicken. The chicken is fine, if a bit bland, but the sauce is outstanding. I made a few minor changes with the sauce, adding about a 1/2 cup more wine halfway through cooking the chicken because it seemed like it was simmering off, and I added 3 cloves of garlic, pressed, to the cream and cornstarch mixture. As I was heating the sauce I dipped a finger in and had my boyfriend taste it. His whole face just lit up, and as I was  ladling the sauce over his plate of chicken and oven-roasted potatoes he kept chanting "More, more!" The chicken mas a mere conduit for the sauce, and now I'm working on a modification to make just the sauce as an alfredo. The reason I'm giving a 4 star and not 5 star review is that the chicken alone would probably earn just 3 stars, but that sauce is so incredibly good. I had no idea that I could cook something like it. Yum!

This recipe is pure heaven. The only alternations I made were substituting 1 cup of chicken broth for wine, since I didn't have that on hand. I also took the advice of a few other reviews and spread some Dijon mustard on the chicken breast before stuffing. My husband ate 3 breasts and raved about it all night! I thought it was the best chicken I've ever made, and I cook A LOT! Don't be afraid to try this one, you wont be disappointed!

I was amazed at how awesome this was. The sauce was so good but I think next time I might use half and half or whole milk. It was very rich with the heavy cream.

it had a great taste but i had some problems with the crums coming off. it would stick to the pan and it just wouldn't have that brown cruncy texture to it anymore. i replaced swiss with mozzerella and it still came out good. loved it nonetheless!

I recently made this for my boyfriend and it was great. It was easy and took no time at all. I used dental floss to tie the chicken together and it held up better than tooth picks. I highly recomend this recipe for others. I will be keeping this recipe for future meals!

This is the second time I made a cordon bleu recipe. The first time I did, I used the cream of mushroom-based sauce, and although it is good in itself, I still want to try something that is made from scratch. This recipe is a definite keeper and although I did some variations from the original recipe, Behr's version is still the basis of my cordon bleu success. Instead of folding, I opted to roll the chicken breast, seasoned with salt, garlic powder, paprika, and italian seasoning. After so, I wrapped it in foil and steamed for 20 minutes, then refrigerate overnight. (this is so much worth the try as it will give your rolls a perfect finish and prevent the filling from oozing out when you fry it). Then, i dredge the rolls in flour, then in slightly beaten egg, and lastly in Japanese breadcrumbs. I also used a combination of butter, olive oil, and virgin coconut oil in frying. I doubled the sauce recipe by combining 1c cream with 1c milk to lighten it up a bit. I also substituted the wine with alcohol-free sparkling grape juice bec. it's what I have at hand (also inspired by another review who used apple juice). Adding a chopped parsley in the sauce does wonders. Lastly, I baked the sliced chicken cordon bleu, topped with the sauce in the oven for 15-20 minutes (350F) and garnish it with parsley for presentation. Ultimate ultimate!!!

My husband and I love the sauce that goes with the chicken.  I usually make a lot of extra sauce for the chicken.  Then the next day I add a little milk to the sauce, heat it up, add some steamed broccoli, some Perdue Italian Style chicken cut-ups, then pour it over some pasta.  MMM!  MMM!  It's to die for.

It was a fabulous dish! I did everything exactly the recipe said and it turned out wonderfully.  I loved the wine cream sauce but I thought it was bit too rich for me.  Next time, I should try to put in half and half instead of heavy whipping cream.  Oh, I didn't use the toothpick.  I used two cooking ropes, one tied up on each edge of rolled chicken with ham/swiss.

Wonderful recipe!  I followed it to a T...but as others have written, not so much butter is needed.  I made this for friends last night, with spinach mashed potatoes, and everyone thought it was excellent!  Thanks for sharing~~!

We really enjoyed this with a few changes as suggested by other reviewers:  1. Pounded the chicken; 2. Use 1/2 cup of chicken broth instead of wine; 3. Added chopped basil to the cream; 4. Brushed the rolled chicken w/ egg and rolled in breadcrumbs instead of flour; 5. Finished the chicken in the oven (350 deg.); 6.  Simmered the cream, broth, bouillon, and corn starch together for 10 minutes before pouring over the chicken.  All of the flavors worked well, but the creamy sauce w/ the basil really made it extra special!

There's really no need to actually "stuff" the chicken with Ham and cheese.  Just fry the pounded & breaded chicken breasts in pan on both sides.  At the last few minutes lay a slice of ham followed by a slice of Swiss on top of the chicken breast.  Remove from pan when cheese is melted, add white sauce on top. Viola!

This was ABSOLUTELY delicious!  The only addition I made was that I also used some parmesan bread crumbs along with the flour and paprika as breading.  I'm not even a fan of Cordon Bleu ordinarily, but this recipe has tons of flavor!  We used proscuitto in some and honey baked ham in others, and both were equally as good.

Whole family liked this recipe, even a picky eater. I followed advice of others and pounded breast to about 1/2" to 3/4" thick, doubled the sauce and will triple next time. I ended using cooking twine/string...don't think the toothpicks would have held up since my chicken breasts were very large. Did not have to worry about everything falling apart while cooking with twine...I ended up cooking the breast late at night when I got off work so chicken prepared with the cheese and ham as per directions and browned in a skillet  and finished cooking in the oven on 350*(preview reviewer suggestion). The next eve, put the ingredients for the sauce (again, doubled sauce) in large skillet, and cut breast rolls in half crosswise removing string and stuck in pan until heated through and sauce hot. Then cut in 1.5" wide medallions. Next time, will get smokier ham and slightly thicker pieces of ham so it will not tear when I wrap cheese in it. May consider trying to add small amount spinach to add color/more nutrition to chicken medallions to see how it tastes. Will consider preparing chicken at night again when entertaining or to decrease workday meal prep time. Will experiment to decrease fat content. This is just so good. Love this recipe. Want to make it a often.

Greatly appreciated by my husband and myself. I served it with a little less of the sauce as it is very fat-rich, and it is still enough to accompany this very tasty chicken! I kept the rest for next time (in the freezer). I will serve this next time we have a dinner party or family over. Wonderful!

This is such an amazing sauce! I am not a very experienced cooker, but everything was easy to make. I did however change the recipe a little bit. Instead of rolling the chicken, I cut them in half and stacked the cheese and ham between the two pieces. I also dipped the chicken in egg and breadcrumbs and cooked it on the stovetop with Olive oil. Then I just cooked the sauce in it's own pan and poured it over the top! Even my Dad said it was restaurant quality, and he's super picky!

This is the first time I've ever made this. I followed the recipe exactly. It is amazing! The sauce is so good! Definitely watch the cooking time depending on the thickness of your chicken. So so good!

Amazing recipe! My boyfriend's favorite! The only difference we make is that we use thin sliced chicken breasts instead of having to pound down the halves.

Great recipe!  I doubled the sauce and put it over pasta.  I also use uncooked fettuccine to hold the chicken together and then you don't have to worry about biting into toothpicks - the pasta holds up long enough to have the chicken cook and then it's cooked as well.

Like this recipe its easy tastes great as it is. Was hungry to have some one day but did not have any ham and have been eating rubens all week and didn’t really feel like going to the store and I thought well lets try corn beef instead ham. Believe it or not I have made this many times since and only with corn beef it's really a surprising taste combination.

I skipped browning and instead baked after coating with the egg wash and breadcrumb/ paprika/ garlic powder mixture.  It took about 40 min at 350 to cook thru.  I made the sauce on the stovetop but we only used a little.  It was delicious and healthier without all the butter!

I couldn't get my chicken breasts thin enough to stuff them so after browning the chicken I just put the ham and cheese on top and finished in the oven.  It was delicious and everyone liked it so I will make again.

OUTSTANDING!!!  I didn't change a thing on this recipe and it was absolutely delicious.  Company worthy, for sure.  The sauce was wonderful over steamed broccoli, too.  My husband couldn't stop talking about the sauce.  I'll be making this one again.  Thanks for a superb recipe, Behr!!

I made as is and came out FANTASTIC, thank you! I may try bread crumbs instead of flower next time for a thicker crust and try putting sauteed baby bellas and fresh mozz in the center. There is so much you can do with this recipe and stuff the chicken with whatever you choose, I will be making this very often, the sauce is outstanding! My husband is a bit of a culinary snob and has a complaint for about every recipe I have made from Allrecipes and he said this one was outstanding, no complaints! The impossible! :)

Yummy.  Be sure to use small chicken breast.  Mine were too big so they were hard to get thin enough and  the chicken was too much.  Browned and finished in the oven for 40 min. @ 350.  Also used kitchen twine instead of toothpicks (great idea).

Very good but felt it needed something, will try adding some garlic and fresh herbs to the sauce next time.  I spread Dijon mustard on the chicken before adding the ham and cheese and rolling up.  Used kitchen twine in place of toothpicks.  It really is best cooked in wine for depth of flavor, highly recommend not to substitute. May try subbing out half & half for the heavy cream next time.

FAB-U-LOUS!!!  my only changes were to add some fresh diced tomatoes to the cream sauce, and sub fresh mozzarella for the swiss (for personal preference).  you can NOT go wrong with this recipe.  best part is it's kid friendly, but still fancy enough to serve at a dinner party.  i much prefer this version of the recipe with the flour coating than the bread crumbs version.
thank you!!

WOW!!! Wow... just finished this and had to drag myself out of the kitchen so I didn't spoon every last bit of the remaining sauce into my mouth! This was outstanding and definitely deserves as many stars as are available. 
I modified half the recipe so that it was Atkins-friendly for me, leaving out the flour and cornstarch parts and made it a dipping sauce, while making it as directed for my bf. Trying some others' suggestions I spread a little dijon on the chicken and rolled the swiss up in the ham before wrapping the chicken around it. The breast halves I bought were so thin that all I did was brown all sides for 10 minutes total in the skillet and followed with 10 minutes at 350 and they were perfect! I figured finishing them in the sauce in the skillet would lead to the "poached" look that others have complained about. I just couldn't be happier with how they turned out. I will definitely be making these for company at every opportunity. Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!!!

OMG, this was the best.  I have never responded before, but this deserves it.  I sliced my chicken breasts in half, filet style, to make them thinner, then pounded them to 1/2 inch thickness.  After rolling them up, I coated them in seasoned flour, egg, then panko bread crumbs before frying them.  In the sauce, I substituted 1/2 cup of fat free half-n-half plus 1/2 cup of GREEK yogurt.  It was just wonderful!  My husband said it was five star restaurant quality!  Oh, one big fat chicken breast fed the two of us.  I only made the two, but should have made more and saved them for later!

The sauce was amazing I used proscuitto instead of ham and regretted it. I think it made it a bit too salty for my taste. Otherwise this was a great hit!

Whole family LOVED it.  Even my picky 5 year old (he asked for more!!)  I made this with basmati rice and asparagus and covered everything with the sauce.  When I was finished I ate the remaining sauce by the spoonfuls!!! mmmm...mmmmm..good!

This was delicious! Instead of flour, I dipped the chicken in egg then into a mixture of seasoned breadcrumbs, paprika, salt and pepper. I laid a piece of ham and the the Swiss, rolled it up and used kitchen twine to tie. I browned it in butter and olive oil, then baked at 350 for 30 minutes. The sauce is amazing...thank you!

I think I need more practice with this one...all my cheese leaked out during cooking.  Maybe need to pound chicken breast more to have a larger flat piece to work with.  What saved it was the yummy cream sauce.

Lip Smacking Good.
Yummy. The only thing I changed was substituiting Herb-Ox Sodium Free chicken bouillion granules for regular bouillion to lower the sodium level. Good basic recipe.

Absolutely fabulous!!!! It is so easy, a beginner cook could razzle dazzle her new in-laws or boyfriend with this recipe.  :) I took Harriet Green's advice and used Gruyere and proscuitto.   Also, I prefer "Better than Bouillon" chicken base to the granules -flavor is richer.  I made it for just my daughter and me so I halved the meat.  The result was I had extra sauce to put on the mashed potatoes- yum.  As a result when I make the full recipe, I will double the sauce.

I also use twine instead of toothpicks, just works easier for me.  This is my usual pick when I am having special company that I want to impress.  Note to donnd, you can find wine in health food stores that has had the alcohol removed and it works just fine.

In a pinch, the one cup of heavy whipping cream can be substituted with 1/3 cup of melted butter
stirred into 3/4 cup of milk. Please note that this substitute will not whip so it's only for recipes such as this one.

This is the standard Cordon Bleu and it is always a hit. I make mine by stacking Prossciutto ham and slices of Gruyere cheese then breading and baking. A sauce is an option. I recognized the preamble to the recipe, defining Cordon Bleu, coming word for word from Barrons Food Lover's Companion, a food dictionary I recommend to my students, and anyone else intrested in culinary arts.

To reduce cooking time I brown ONE side of the chicken filets (the one that is rolled inside) and also the bacon a bit (I had bacon instead of ham)
Cooking time is halved!

Total winner!!  This has such a wonderful flavor.  I started browning in pan with the butter then put in oven @ 325 degrees for 25 min. and finished in the pan with the white wine and boulon for about 10 min.  The chicken was cooked perfect and moist.  Thanks for the awesome recipe.

This is the ultimate chicken cordon bleu.  The entire family loved it.  No changes needed at all.
Only thing I do differently is use kitchen string to tie them instead of wooden skewers.
Fantastic, thanks for sharing.

This recipe was amazing! The only thing I did differently was that I added skim milk instead of heavy cream for the sauce. Still came out perfectly! I will be using this recipe again!

I made this for my 17 y/o granson's birthday. We loved it. I added garlic & onion to the sauce which gave it more flavor. Also doubled, plus more to serve over jasmine rice. Yummy! Even the 6 & 7 yr. olds loved it. Hint: the sauce was not tasty by itself, but over the chicken: "to die for"!

Very good, I used prosciutto instead of ham, and didn't coat in the flour mixture. I used a cast iron skillet, so my chicken got a really nice crust on it. I didn't use wine in the sauce, instead used chicken stock, and added a heaping tablespoon of Dijon mustard to the cream sauce - perfect zip! Finished in the oven on 350 for 15 minutes.

We have this at least once a month and it's a big win with the family everytime.  I also use half butter half olive oil and it makes a delicious sauce after everything is done cooking.  I also use smoked paprika instead of regular.  Sometimes I cheat by using mozzeralla cheese sticks instead of the swiss.  Either way, still delicious!

loved, loved, loved this recipe. Made a few modifications: cut chix breasts in 1/2 lengthwise so had to dble cheese and ham. Also, dredged chix ensemble in egg, then bread crumbs w paprika. slightly browned in oil & butter, transferred to dish and baked 35 minutes w a little chicken broth base. Near end of cooking time, scraped bits from browning pan with remaining chix broth. threw in some fresh sliced mushrooms, light boiled down til rooms were tender, mixed 1 tbl floor (since i didnt have cornstarch) and 1 C heavy cream and added to broth. yum yum yum. a little time consuming, but well worth it.

My family and I really liked this recipe- I did make some changes- I used dijon mustard in between the ham and swiss on the inside- I used bread crumbs for the outside and fried the chicken in butter until the outside was brown- then I baked it at 350 for about 25 minutes....I made a hollandaise sauce to drizzle over the top---It is my new favorite chicken dish!

This is a very yummy recipe! The winner is definitely the white wine sauce. Unfortunately I forgot to buy sliced ham for this recipe, so I had to make do with just the cheese. Luckily it did not compromise the taste! I also changed a few small things to suit my preference. I used the old handy breading technique of flour, eggs, and bread crumbs. I secured the chicken and cheese bundles with a toothpick, coated them, and then fried them in oil. I made the sauce in a separate saucepan on the stove. I also added a few dashes of parsley in the sauce and then spooned it over the chicken and rice (which was my side dish). It was heavenly! My children did not care for the white wine sauce, but it is more of a "grown up" taste anyway. My husband on the other hand could not stop complimenting on how delicious it was! It is a permanent keeper in our recipe box. Next time, I will just spoon the sauce on our portions and leave it out for the kids. Thanks Behr for the great recipe!

This was a great recipe!   The sauce was to die for.  I used one piece of ham and one piece of cheese for each piece of chicken.   Next time I will double up on the cheese and ham per chicken breast.   Thanks!

Delicious and easy. I followed the other viewer's advice and finished the chicken in the oven but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. The sauce was absolutely delicious. I have made similar sauces with fancy shallots and wine mixed in but this sauce was by far the best I've made. I used chicken broth instead of wine and cut the recipe in half because there is just two of us but I should have made more so there would be leftovers!

I thought this was good but somethings i did not like about this recipe. The cream sauce that you make at the end was very bland since it was just cream so we didnt like it. We ended up adding shredded cheese to it to make it taste better. Also, the white wine in the pan with the chicken gave the bottoms of the chicken a slimy texture. i would make this again but cook the chicken without the wine in the pan and serve the wine sauce on the side. Good flavour but needs alterations.

This was absolutely outstanding!  My only problem was that the cheese leaked out and not much was left inside.  Used a lot of toothpicks, but guess it wasn't enough.  The chicken was very tender and cooking time right @ 45 min.  The sauce was also perfect!! Thickened a bit more out of personal preference.

Delicious! I only had provolone slices in the fridge, so I used that instead of swiss and it was heavenly! This is definitely going on my "menu"!

I cooked this for my family including my mother who is a culinary genius...They were all very pleased with how this turned out.  I used a ham steak and it was fantastic.  I doubled the sauce for my fiancee' who loves extra creamy sauce....this will be in the rotation for dinner partys or when we have a guest in town!

Perfect recipe. (Though we call it Heart Attack CHicken because it's so ridiculously rich and high-cholesterol.) We made it three nights in a row, because we loved it so much. I like using proscuto or some other thin-sliced cured ham, like Spanish cured ham.

Was really good.  Just seemed a bit unhealthy with all the butter and cream.  I would imagine there are ways to lighten this up.

I didn't have chicken boullion cubes so I used some Adobo seasoning instead.  It turned out great!  I highly recommend pounding out the chicken breasts to be thin enough to roll up--better texture and distribution of ham/swiss to chicken.

This was great and simple to make.  I love mushrooms in sauce so I added mushrooms. And I did marinate my chicken, only because I was going to make something else.  Try this, I had no leftovers five thumbs up thanks for the nice change for chicken.

I am reviewing this recipe mainly for the sauce- I used a different recipe for the actual chicken.  I only made 4 servings of Chicken Cordon Bleu (baked), and made this sauce on the stovetop.  Used about 2 Tbsp butter and all I had was some Chardonnay, 1 cube of bullion and followed the rest to a T.  I simmered the wine & butter while my chicken baked in the oven, then towards the end I added the cream/cornstarch and a dash of paprika. This sauce turned out wonderful and was a first for me with Chicken Cordon Bleu. I will probably make this a staple for the future! Thank You!

This time I breaded them, like other reviews recommended.  I coated it with egg and breading, rolled the Swiss and ham up and secured with a toothpick, and browned on. Both sides before baking.  I made 3 breasts but left the amt for the sauce for 6, and used it for sauce over fettuccini with my chicken. Sided with honey walnut green beans, everyone raved about it!  The sauce seemed really bland, I used chicken stock instead of wine... and added adobo seasoning, added plenty of shredded cheddar, some basil, salt, onion and garlic powder.  I needed to add more cornstarch because Iwanted it thicker faster.  Will edit and save this recipe as a go to dinner menu item

We LOVED this recipe!! I wasn't sure about the sauce but that was really good too.  I tweaked it a bit.  I dredged the rolled chicken in flour, then egg and then  seasoned homemade bread crumsbs and browned it in a drizzle of olive oil before putting them into the oven.  I didn't used the drippings for the sauce but used a butter roux, the boullion, wine and cream.  The sauce was a little tangy (probably the type of wine) so I put the tiniest pinch of sugar in it.  It was super easy.  I also wrapped the edges of the ham around the cheese and hardly had any cheese ooze out.

Good, not great.  I was so excited about this recipe but as it turned out, I thought it was good but not spectacular like I was expecting.  My family felt the same.  I'm obviously in the minority - maybe I did something wrong!

Simple yet very tasty! Like other users I browned before baking. Because I didn't have traditional ham I used proscuitto. While the sauce was fine, I guess I didn't find it necessary for the dish. I will make this dish again.

Very good, intermediate cooking level.  I would recommend buying chicken breasts carefully.  I bought mine in a bulk thawed package and found it difficult to pound/flatten them into a desired shape/size.  I wish the meal had more of a bite to it.  If I did it again I would coat the chicken in egg before covering in the flour mixture.  I would also add more spices to the flour mixture.  Very good meal, serve it with steamed asparagus and a mushroom/onion sautee and watch your dinner guests eyes light up in amazement.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE, My father is a amazing chef and his chicken cordon blue has always been my favorite.... UNTIL now this recipe blew his out the water and that is saying alot. Alittle time consuming but well worth it. Also I made double the sauce so I also doubled my wine. If you make this DOUBLE the sauce because it MAKES this recipe and I also suggest if you are using large chicken breast cut them in half because this is very filling. Hope everyone enjoys it as much as my family did there wasnt a peice left even my 3 year old wiped his plate clean!

Yum!!!!This was my first attempt at chicken cordon bleu and it won't be my last. I baked the chicken at 350 for 20 mins after dipping in egg wash then the flour/paprika mixture and browning on all sides, like other reviewers suggested. I then whisked all ingredients for the sauce into a pan and simmered it for 10 mins. i tripled the sauce and do have a bit left over which I will add to my alfredo sauce for dinner tomorrow.  next time around I'll add more seasonings to the  flour. But all in all this is an amazing recipe!!!

This was outstanding! My boyfriend said it was restaurant quality. I followed suggestions made by MEGEBY, but used low sodium chicken stock instead of white wine. It was delicious!

This is one of my favorite recipes!  I cut each chicken breast in half before pounding and filling with the ham and cheese.  Then I dip the chicken in egg and then in seasoned panko crumbs.  I brown the chicken in butter and olive oil and then finish off in the oven until done.  I like the chicken crispy, so I make the sauce while the chicken is in the oven and pour on top just before serving.  The sauce is so good that I always double it.  Phenomenal recipe!

Very tasty but very heavy. My family makes this maybe once a month but I eat it without the sauce as I'm trying to be careful about my diet. Without the sauce it is still good, but the sauce makes the dish

This was a fairly simple recipe to make and it turned out perfectly! The chicken was moist and the wine sauce was the perfect pairing. This is definitely a recipe that I'll make again.

We've made this 5 or 6 times and we LOVE it.  I wish I knew a way to keep the cheese inside the chicken (it always melts out!!)...but regardless...it's a great dish that we will make over and over again!

I made this tonight and my whole family enjoyed it!  I wasn't crazy about the cream sauce (I didn't taste much wine flavor)  It's not like it was terrible though at all ~ just not my favorite.  I think I prefer breading them and baking them vs covering them in sauce.  But anything that my whole family enjoys definitely will be made again!  Overall a very good recipe.

This recipe was perfect! Exactly what I was looking for! I ended up not cooking the chicken enough though, so we had to microwave it :( I didn't let it cook the full 30, now I know that was a mistake haha  I am going to retry it tonight!

This was a huge hit in my house.  I doubled the sauce as recommended by several reviewers -- now I have leftover sauce.  I think it would have been fine in the given amount.  I also browned the chicken in a frying pan, then transferred it to a baking pan to finish in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes.  I will definitely make this again.

This was a wonderful dish! I made for company and they loved it and wanted the recipe!. I always follow the recipes and hardly ever change but I did do something a little different and the only thing was I baked the chicken at 350 until done the only reason I did is because I don't do good cooking meats on the stove top. I fixed the sauce exactly how the recipe said and it came out delicious! make extra you won't regret it!!. I made my sauce with Sauvignon Blanc but I'm sure any dry white would do. I made the roasted asparagus and mushroom recipe on allrecipes (which by the way is delicious also) as a side dish and poured it over the veggies! Soo good!!

This was very good except we coated it with a beaten egg and flour. We also cooked the breaded meat in a skillet by itself, and than as suggested by another reviewer, put it in the oven on 350 for another 20 minutes. It was so yummy!

I was expecting something magnificent due to the extremely high rating.  However, I found this recipe to be rather bland.    I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but they way my food came out was disappointing.  It looked very appetizing, and the chicken had a wonderful color, but the taste wasn't there.

While this recipe isn't like the store-bought breaded Chicken Cordon Bleu, it is sure delicious! The sauce was especially good-we loved the tangy flavor. Next time, I may want to add some breadcrumbs to the flour/paprika mixture to give it a little more crunch. Other than that, we sure enjoyed this dish!

Based on other's reviews, I made a few changes. I breaded the chicken according the directions on the back of the Panko box and baked it in the oven.  I also made the sauce on the stove and spooned it over the chicken just before serving. It was delicious!

Wonderful and easy! 6 tablespoons of butter seemed a bit much, so I only used 3 and probably could have gotten away with less than that. The sauce has a silky but slightly thin consistancy that didn't stick to the chicken very well; I will likely use a little more corn starch in the future. Also, I used smoked paprika which made the sauce look orange but with great flavor. I saved the left over sauce (this recipe makes plenty!) and served it over poached eggs in the morning. I'll definitely be making this one again!

Really, seriously good!  Sauce was amazing.  Recipe is simple.  I browned chicken and then stuck in oven while I finished everything else.  DH & DS both said I can make this anytime.  The highest compliment in my house.

Thanks for this recipe! my husband couldn't stop saying "mmmm...yum...mmm...", it was delightful to watch. I browned the chicken in butter-olive oil, put it in 350F oven for 10minutes and finished it in the wine sauce. I am definitely making this again!

This is a great recipe. I add extra spices to the flour: season all salt, pepper, oregano, basil, and parsley and then instead of cornstarch I just dump in the excess seasoned flour. It's the best. Very good!

This is a wonderful recipe and relatively easy to make.  The only modifications I made were to use 3 large chicken breasts, slice them lengthwise and stuff them with the folded ham and cheese slices.  (I also omitted a small amount of the butter, and used Pinot Grigio for the wine.) The chicken cooked very well although some of the cheese did leak into the pan while they simmered, however it just made the cream sauce thicker and cheesier.  Steamed broccoli is a perfect side dish topped with a little of the extra sauce :)

I really loved this recipe, although I did do some changes based on other's reviews.  I breaded with egg wash and breadcrumbs instead of flour.  I browned for 10 minutes in an olive oil/butter mixture, then cooked at 350 for 20 minutes.  As for the sauce I made seperate and added fresh basil and a splash of red wine vinegar.  I added all the sauce ingredients together and whisked together on medium heat stiring constantly until it came to a boil, the turned it on low until it thickened, and then spooned over the baked chicken.  I will be making this again soon, very soon!

The sauce was incredible.  Make sure to wrap the ham around the cheese so you don't loose half of it before you're ready to serve.

This was great!!  My (picky) husband and even my toddler loved this recipe!  Definitely a keeper.  I swapped the butter and wine for olive oil and chicken stock because that's what I had on hand and it still had tons of flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic! I made a few changes to this recipe. First, I brushed the chicken with egg and rolled in breadcrumbs instead of flour. Second, I fried the chicken in butter for about 10 minutes until it was nicely browned, then I put it in the oven at 350 for another 20 minutes. Instead of simmering the chicken in the sauce, I whisked the cream,wine, bouillon and cornstarch in a bowl, then simmered it for about 10 min. alone, and spooned it over the chicken. As per MEGEBY stated on her post on 11/03/2003. A definated keeper for my RECIPE BOX. The wife loved it!

Very flavorful, and very rich. I de-boned chicken thighs and, as others have said, this is a more flavorful cut of meat that leaves a nice little spot for the ham/swiss. I also breaded the chicken in panko (Japanese bread crumbs) and crushed almonds for more crunch and flavor. Don't worry if your chicken doesn't "wrap up" perfectly - just put toothpicks where needed to hold it all together. Once its done cooking, it will hold its shape. The gravy was a great addition and I did not think the wine was overpowering. I served this with garlic red potatoes and fresh green beans. I will make this again!

I made this last night and it was my very first time ever doing the chicken cordon bleu recipe. My boyfriend said it was very good and enjoyed it . he was my guinea pig so to speak and really liked it ,said the sauce was a little to rich for his taste.

Very very good!  The flavor was perfect.  Chicken was very moist and not dried out at all.  The only thing I changed was I didn't have any white wine so I substituted apple juice.  It was just as good.  I also doubled the sauce so I had extra to cover the rice.  I do agree that it is a bit time consuming but this is the first time I have ever done a stuffed chicken of any sort, so that could be why it took me a bit longer.  Well worth the effort.

The sauce was superb! Absolutely a pleasure to taste. My fiance loved this dish a lot. He was very impressed with the way it turned out. I followed the recipe to a tee. The only problem I had was that most of the cheese melted out of the chicken and I had to put another slice in each one after they were finished cooking. Other than that, a must for my recipe box! Thank you!

Okay, so I have made this twice now and felt it was worth repeating how much I love this recipe!  Instead of wine I used chicken broth (only because I didn't have any wine on hand) and it was just a good.  I also used Mozzerella instead of swiss (for the same reason) and just as good!  You have to try this recipe

My husband nearly keeled over he thought it was so good, and I agree. I too, browned the chicken in butter & olive oil then baked it at 350 for an additional 25 minutes and made the gravy separate, otherwise I followed the recipe. An extremely tasty dish we will enjoy again and again, thank you!

This was the best chicken cordon bleu I have EVER had!!  I have made it a couple of times for my family and friends.  I can't get enough of it!  I was really worried with the white wine in it that it would taste really "winey" and it wasn't at all - the sauce is so mouthwatering!  Also - when pounding the chicken thinner, I put the chicken in between saran wrap and pounded it with a rolling pin.  That made the chicken not squirm around everywhere!  Thank you SO much for this recipe!!!!

The sauce was excellent!  My only complaint was the chicken came out dry.  My fault, I scaled for two, but didn't adjust cooking time.  15 minutes would have been enough.  I will try again.

Excellent recipe !!! The only changes I made as someone suggested I added half a cup of fresh basil when starting the sauce near the end. I also for presentation purposes and ease to work with. Cut the chicken breasts in half instead of a meat pounder before placing the ham and cheese. It was much easier to work with this way. Very good and easy recipe, I made it for family and the cooks their asked for the recipe, thank you!

Delicious! I made this for company tonight along with the "Suzy's Mashed Red Potatoes" recipe from this site and corn. The chicken was super moist and the sauce was really rich and full of flavor! The only thing I did differently was bread the chicken after I coated it with flour (using bread crumbs, crunched corn flakes, paprika, garlic powder, and parmesan cheese. It was great because the chicken can be filled and breaded ahead of time, making the cooking time super easy. Thanks for a great recipe! Everybody loved it, even the 2 year old guest!

I was very pleased with this recipe.  I doubled the sauce even though I only used 4 breasts.  This turned out to be the right amount for the chicken and 1 lb of egg noodles served as a side.

OH MY GOSH!!! This was wonderful.  I followed the directions with only a little change.  I doubled the sauce and when the sauce was done, I was still waiting on the side dishes.  To keep the chicken warm, I put it in the sauce and spooned the sauce over it and left it sit in the pan with the lid on for about 10 minutes.  Also I did not have cream so I used half & half.  I will not be ordering Chicken Cordon Blue out ever again.  No other will be able to compare.

Wow, I have to say, I am impressed!  I followed this recipe to the "T", except I salt and peppered the chicken breast before adding the ham and cheese, and I added kosher salt to the sauce at the end to season it a little more.  What a great, easy recipe.  I served it with mashed potatoes and broccolli.

I am a beginner cook and this, without doubt, is the best meal I have ever attempted and very easy to make.. The chicken turned out perfect and the sauce was to die for (I doubled the amount). I will definatley make this dish again. I used whole chicken breast and slit them throught the middle to stuff them with the ham and cheese.

Made this tonight and it was excellent!  Made chicken rolls and rolled in flour/paprika mixture (added garlic powder) and refridgerated about 2 1/2 hours before frying.  No need to dip in egg and breadcrumbs, they browned up great. Used 3 tablespoons butter and the same of olive oil.   Browned for 10 minutes, put in 350 oven for 20 minutees more.  Mixed wine, boullion, and 3 tablespoons butter in saucepan.  After removing chicken from the oven, removed chicken from pan and heated pan - added wine mixture, THEN added one cup whole milk and one cup whole milk with one tablespoon cornstarch.  It was great!  Will make again - served with rice and tossed salad!  Wonderful!

This is so easy and so good!!! I make it up that morning (have the butcher flatten  the chicken for you} after the flour and paprika i dip it in melted butter then roll in dried bread crumbs and put back in the refigerator to let it sit, this helps keep it together later when you cook it. I double the wine sauce also, it is outstanding Thank you for sharing a gourmet meal with all of us!! Another tid bit is to put some creme cheese in the center before rolling up its yummy!

This particular chicken cordon blue recipe is very basic.  I ussually do a lot more with the breading mixture and then bake the chicken after searing in olive oil.  No.. what really got my attention in this recipe was the sauce.  It is delicious!  I ussually shy away from wine sauces but this is one  that I will be making again and again.  I used a Merlot white wine which is what I had in the fridge at the time.  I'm going to try the sauce with pork chops next.  I'd bet it would be great on fish and pasta as well.

This was a huge hit!  I found that the thinner you get the chicken, the easier it is to work with.  I agree with previous reviewers that you could use less butter.  The sauce also tasted great with the steamed asparagus I served on the side.

This is an excellent recipe!  I made it and subsituted prosciutto for the ham and it came out excellent! I also sliced the chicken breast in half lengthwise to have a thinner cut. It was quite easy to roll it this way.

Delicious, and easy but impressive!  I omitted the chicken bouillon because I didn't have any, and I also removed the chicken from the skillet to a 350-degree oven before making the sauce.  After making the sauce on the rangetop, poured over the uncovered chicken and basted a couple of times while it baked.  A keeper that will win you rave reviews!

I made this recipe for a dinner party and people were begging for seconds. This is pretty easy to make. I would tie the chicken together with cooking string before putting into simmer. This worked great. YUMMY!

This was delicious!  Chicken Cordon Bleu always sounded so complicated to me, but it was actually really easy.  And, as other viewers also proclaimed, the sauce really made the recipe.  I'll be making it again soon.

This recipe is easy to fix, and tastes awesome!  I made "pockets" in the chicken instead of folding and pounding them, then tucked in rolls of ham and swiss and pinned with toothpicks.  I also added finely crushed corn chex to the flour and paprika to add a little crust to the chicken... Superb recipe!

Tasty recipe. Way too much butter though, which made the sauce oily. Butter can be cut down to 1 T. Cream sauce is very rich - next time I'll sub whole milk for the cream, b/c I think chicken can stand alone w/o the sauce (although the sauce is a classy bonus). Lastly, the simmer time can be cut if you saute more. Thumbs up - I will make again definitely.

I personal did not eat this due to the fact that I prepared this recipe for a cleint. As his personal chef I look for ease of preparation, of  course over all taste and will it freeze and taste just like I made it that day. He loved it, said it was moist and loved the sauce. Maybe some day I'll treat myself to it!

This is absolutely awesome!  I have made it numerous times now, and I think I might know why one of the other reviewers had a problem with the saltiness.  It's all in the ham - they are salted to death.  I went to the deli and explained what I was making and they gave me a low sodium very plain tasting ham - not so great in a sandwich, perfect for this dish, because it will pick up the other flavours anyway.  As for gluey sauce, I don't let the sauce boil after the cream goes in - just warm it through and it should thicken on its own, without getting too goopy.

My husband absolutely loved this dish; however, my stepson and I thought it was just very good.  It was worth the effort to make this dish.  The sauce is very, very rich and complements the chicken. I didn't use white wine in the sauce and it still tasted very delicious.

My family devoured this chicken,  even my picky tween asked for seconds. I used flour and water and more cream than the recipe called for- with the cornstarch and the recommended cream- because we are all about the sauce. I served this dish with garlicky jasmine rice and broccoli sautéed with olive oil and garlic. I was told I need to make it fairly often now.  Thanks allrecipes!

The recipe was easy to make and very tasty, but I made a few small changes to fit our taste.
Browned in butter and EVOO, and instead of heavy cream used reduced fat milk, also added some sliced mushrooms to the sauce. It came out perfectly anyway and tasted delicious. My wife was extremely pleased

This was fantastic!  I'd give it 10 stars if I could.  I used lower sodium bouillon cubes and pinot grigio for the sauce, as I know nothing about wine and another reviewer said it was great.  I had 8 chicken breasts and doubled the sauce.  Doubling the sauce was not necessary and we used a lot of it.  Will be making again for sure!

This recipe was awesome. I made a few changes. I didn't fold the breast over and I'm so glad I didn't. It wouldn't have contained the ham and cheese well at all. Instead, I laid both breasts flat in the skillet and browned both sides. I then simmered as instructed, but in the last 15 minutes of cooking, I laid the ham and then the cheese on top of the chicken. When the sauce was finished, I poured it directly on top of the cheese. I found that this way each bite was more balanced with chicken, ham and cheese rather than getting a forkful of mostly chicken when folded over. I also added salt and pepper to the flour/paprika mix. I had no bouillon powder, so I used 1 cube. It turned out amazing! I'll definitely be making this again.

My boyfriend and I LOVED IT! I only changed it a little bit, added more ham and used provolone because I don't like swiss. I also used half wine and half chicken broth because I didn't have any bullion. Using all butter always makes it taste better, but I think next time I'll try half butter and half oil, as some have suggested. This will be a repeat recipe!

I cannot say enough good things about this recipe! This is the best chicken cordon bleu I have ever eaten! The only thing I did different was use Italian Style breadcrumbs with the paprika, and added a little garlic powder, and black pepper to the coating instead of flour! My mother in law kept saying "This is sooo good!" Thank you for this recipe! It is a keeper!

This recipe is definitely going in the 'keep' file! I actually printed it for a friend who was planning to make Cordon Bleu but didn't know what kind of sauce to make with it - this had such good reviews I suggested she try it. When unsure what to make for Sunday dinner last weekend, I decided to give the whole recipe a try. Hubby and I both LOVED it. I've made Cordon bleu a time or two before, but NEVER this good. Followed the recipe for the most part: Pounded my chicken pretty thin, used Krakus low-salt deli ham, and used kitchen twine instead of toothpicks which I think helped keep it together and kept the cheese from melting out. Browned in pan, then put in oven for about 30 minutes. Made the sauce in pan I browned chicken in, then added chicken to the sauce and simmered in pan for a few minutes when I took it out of the oven. Doubled the sauce recipe, and served with rice pilaf. We ate all the chicken, but I had leftover rice and sauce and I enjoyed that without the meat the next day...... I added a little extra wine and some black pepper and garlic powder to the sauce 'cause I like highly seasoned food - just kept adding and tasting till it was just right. Will DEFINITELY be making this one again- Yum Yum Yum!

This was my first time making Cordon Bleu.  I was a little nervous but wow, this came out fantastic!  I made a few changes based on some reviews:  1)  I pounded the chicken breasts to about 1/2" thin.  2)  Rather than flour up the breasts, I used plain breadcrumbs which was great, except it kinda messed up my plans to deglaze the pan with the wine sauce.  Next time I'll use flour as this time I had to make the sauce in a separate pan as all those fried crumbs would not a good wine sauce make!  3)  I only baked this for 20 minutes - if you pound your chicken down to 1/2" which I HIGHLY suggest, you'll want to follow suit.  This was EXCELLENT and I'm making it again tonight with flour this time.

Loved it!  Very easy and tasty. The sauce was  good, though not as creamy as the photo.  I am going to take other reviewers advice and trade out half the butter for olive oil.  Definitively will be making this again.

Love it! I wrap the cheese in the ham, pound the chicken and close with toothpicks. I pan fry in a skillet until brown then pop in the oven for 20 mins until cooked through. So yummy!

This was a good recipe, but we were disappointed with how bland it turned out.  The sauce was delicious, and the chicken was tender, but there was so little flavor that I doubt I'd make it again.

*Made again a year later--much better! I did two things differently. First, I seasoned the chicken. Second, I added some fresh basil to the sauce when I added the cream. It was so good, my family wanted seconds. With those small changes, I'll definitely be making again.

Terrible mess to roll but oh so tasty when you're done that you don't care!  I did fry mine in butter in my cast iron skillet for about 10 min (or until brown) and then popped it into the oven at 350* for another 20 min or so.  Made the sauce in a separate pan, and it was food-gasmic!

It was great. Good restuarant quality. I would use regular size chicken breasts (not the thin sliced size which are always not uniform), butterfly them and then pound.

Ok everyone already knows that this recipe ROCKS but I have to add my own 2 cents.... I was going to make this Sunday night.  I pounded out the chicken in the morning after Church.  The hubby and I did some yard work, while in the yard a 30 lb metal pipe fell on my head.  I was rushed to the ER and spent the rest of the night.  So no Cordon Bleu that night.  I've been sleeping all day today and hubby decides to make the Cordon Bleu.. i thought, "o my!"  Well I was one of the best meals I've ever eaten and my boys were fighting over the last piece!  My hubby NEVER cooks anything and this was THE BOMB!!!  (as for my head... I think I'll live, the hubby says I'm a tough old bird!!!)

Loved it! used only 4 thin cut chicken breasts, used cooking sherry instead of white wine, and added sliced mushrooms to sauté about 20 minutes into the simmering. I did not change the amounts on the rest of the recipe and I had plenty of sauce. My very picky 4 y/o loved the chicken without the cream sauce of course.  Will be making this again and again! My husband asked me to cook this every week...

I Loved the Sauce, I would recommend folding the chicken breast in half for frying, but I also tried rolling a few, it wasn't as easy to evenly cook them, but once I covered the skillet, the steam did the rest. AMAZING

This dinner came out great! It was my first time making it and the whole family loved it! The sauce came out very rich, so I think next time I would maybe not use so much butter and sub out half the heavy whipping cream for 1% or even skim milk. Instead of using whole chicken breasts, I had smaller (almost like chicken finger size) pieces, which made it easy:) I think I'll make this for my next party!

Family loved this. I used Italian bread crumbs to coat which added more flavor. I also used thinly sliced chicken breast, which folded nicely. I added a little bit of butter to the sauce to add a little more flavor. It turned out so yummy. Then served with green beans with feta cheese and mushrooms.

5 star recipe.  This was so good.  My only problem was it was a little salty but not the recipe fault as I was a little heavy handed with it.  I'd never eaten Chicken Cordon Bleu with a sauce before but this really makes the dish. I did even out the cream with half skim but I don't think it made a difference.  I can't believe how easy this recipe was to make and I will make it again.  Delicious!

so heavenly!!! my boyfriend loves it.. he wouldnt stop raving about it while we were eating.. he even told me i was a keeper.. thank you chicken cordon blue!! I did use prosciutto and gruyere, and used an egg bath before dipping the chicken in a flour/panko seasoning mixture. for seasoning i used a little white pepper, salt, and rosemary to tie it in with the roasted veggies and red potatoes that i served alongside. and the sauce!!! oh my goodness, i will use this sauce recipe for other dishes as well.  i also browned the chicken and then finished cooking it in the oven.. so delicious..

AMAZING! 10 stars! I added fresh basil and mushrooms, and it was one of the best dinners I have ever made or eaten! Like others, I rolled the chicken in breadcrumbs, parmesan cheese, paprika, and garlic salt.

Made this with chicken thighs, boneless, with skin on.
Sautéed the chicken, put light layer of Dijon mustard on skin, baked, covered, in 350 oven for 30 minutes.  saved the pan juices.  
(note: I used prosciutto and gruyere cheese)

Meanwhile, made the sauce, BUT Used Dry Sherry, added 1 Tablespoon beef Demi-glace, and the juice 
from the pan.   I had to add a bit more wine, and water as the sauce cooked, maybe next time, less cornstarch.   Placed sauce on a warmed plate, then the chicken, sprinkled with fresh grated parmesan and parsley.  Delicious, and like everyone reviews, the sauce was the best part.
       The small amount of beef Demi-glace added a nice color, depth and flavor.  Worth trying.  My husband loved this dish, and chicken is not is first choice.  Have leftovers for tonight, can't wait.

This was a great recipe! Loved it! After rolling the chicken and securing it with toothpicks, I dipped it in egg and then a breadcrumb mixture. Cooked it in a pan with 3 tbls butter and 3 tbls olive oil for 10 min. Placed chicken on a wire rack over a cookie sheet and transferred to a 350 oven for 25 min. 
While the chicken was in the oven, made the sauce in a saucepot on the stove, combining wine, bouillon, cornstarch, basil and heavy cream, letting it simmer and then poured over chicken before serving. Amazing! Loved it!!!

Wow. This was awesome! I browned the chicken in butter and then baked it at 375 for about 45 minutes (it was pretty thick). Then I took the white wine sauce, added it to the pan with the cream, and made the thick sauce... WHICH WAS AMAZING! My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this!

Easily one of THE BEST meals I've -ever- cooked! I have told everyone I know about this recipe and have made it repeatedly for friends and family. Definitely easier to make with two people in the kitchen, particularly if you're not a very experienced cook, but well worth the effort. My only suggestion to those looking to make this recipe is to make sure the chicken breasts are not too thick/large, as they become harder to roll. I have made this recipe about a half dozen times with varied sizes of breast - From Chicken breast strips to full sized organic Chicken breasts. Finding a breast that is flat and not too large is key!

This is a keeper.  I didn't cook in butter, however; we rolled in bag of seasoned flour, egg wash, then Panko bread crumbs (dry-wet-dry).  Baked at 350 for 30 mins, then 325 for 30 mins for a nice brown color.  We used our Christmas ham so the slices were a little thicker but fabulous. We doubled the white wine sauce and added white pepper and thyme.  knock your socks off!  This was very filling and I agree, they can be sliced then plated.

This is an excellent recipe.  You have to use the wine, so much more flavour.

I made this last night and it was excellent!! I used cooking string to keep everything together, as I had made this in the past and the toothpicks didn't hold well.  I didn't change a thing and it came out perfect!  Thank you for the recipe!

My family loved it!!!  The only thing I didn't different was to dip chicken in egg/milk wash (after I folding it), then roll it in seasoned bread crumbs, brown it using olive oil, then finally baking it for 30 mins.  This receipe is definitely a keeper.

Awesome!!!!! Only thing I do differently is once I fill the chicken with ham and cheese, I dip it in egg, and cover with italian bread crumbs for a crusty shake n' back coating.

Absolutely AMAZING! My 10 year old wasn't thrilled at the prospect of having cordon bleu for dinner- but immediately after the first bite, she was in love! We swapped out the wine for broth as suggested and in addition to adding basil at the end, also used the butter and olive oil mix to brown. Make this recipe, you are going to love it!

Nothing wrong with the recipe and I'm sure I'll be crucified at dawn for admitting it, BUT, I didn't have any heavy cream or corn starch while making this recipe at the beach house soooo, I substituted cream of chicken soup at the end for that and used canned carnation milk.  I guess the wine won out because it was wonderful!

Amazing Recipe! I used kitchen twine instead of toothpicks (holds together much better), dipped the stuffed chicken into garlic powder & paprika seasoned flour, then egg, then Panko (be careful browning- Panko browns much quicker than regular bread crumbs!), browned all sides until golden and simmered on the stovetop like the recipe says. For a beautiful presentation- Slice into medallions and serve with the sauce poured down the middle. The recipe as it is makes enough sauce for 2-3 chicken breasts, and half a breast is really enough for 1 person when served with a veggie and a baked potato! Do add fresh basil to the sauce, as suggested by another reviewer. Enjoy!!

It rocked! This is the first dinner I've cooked for my fiancee and we both loved it! Normally she does the cooking but I agreed to start helping out on the weekends. Thanks to allrecipes.com and this dish, I apparently am going to be cooking more often... haha. This was simple and tasted amazing! I will upload pictures too! I would not have been "chopped" for this dish :-)

Followed the recipe exactly, except that I doubled the sauce ingredients to make extra.  Truly amazing, will definitely be making this recipe again.  Even my picky 12-yr. old daughter enjoyed it (I just left the Swiss out of hers). Yummmmmmmmm :)

I have never written a review before. I signed up just so I could rate this recipe. It is AMAZING! I did take some of the others advice and coat the chicken in panko bread crumbs. This recipe is a crowd pleaser and definitely something I will be making often!

I took other reviewers advice and also coated with Panko and browned in butter/olive oil first then finished off in oven.  I couldn't imagine it without the chicken being coated.  The sauce is amazing!! I didn't double but wish I would have.  DH loved it!! He actually couldnt wait to pack up leftovers for work the next day.   Thanks for posting this one!

Delicious!  My whole family loved it!  I made a few adjustments by dredging the chicken in the flour, eggs and then regular bread crumbs.  I used Muenster cheese instead of Swiss and I only browned the chicken and then baked it another 15 mins in the oven at 400.  I made my sauce separately and then added the cooked chicken at the end.  Simply scrumptious!  I'll definitely be making it again :)

The cheese melted out easily but that's not why it got 2 stars. This dish didn't have much flavor at all and I probably wouldn't make it again.

I made this last eve. We liked it but the cheese all melted out from inside so I ended up putting anoher slice of swiss cheese on top of the rolled chicken.  Also I think I will try string & tie them next time, I made the mistake of using colored toothpicks:)

Few small changes to make it more low-carb friendly: omitted the flour, just sprinkled with the paprika and a little garlic salt, and omitted the cornstarch from the sauce (the sauce got plenty thick without it). I also quick-browned each side in butter on the stove and finished them off @ 350 for about 30 minutes--juicy and just a little crispy on the outside. Will make this again and again. Love finding low-carb recipes that are actually delicious!

I love this recipe.  Great presentation for company, and the sauce is to die for.  I did follow a few suggestions,......Egg bath, and bread crumbs & papricka......brown, then put into 350 oven for 20 minutes......make sauce from pan drippings.   Just perfect.

This was so good that my son paused to take a look, ran back to the room where he was playing PS2 with his dad, informed his dad that he will eat first and play later.  To be able to pull a child from his favorite game >> that is how powerful this dish is!    I ran out of wine, I used chicken stock and also accidentally pour cream into the skillet, didn't hurt the dish at all, in fact the the sauce was all thick and creamy, no need cornstarch after all!

So Good!  Like everyone, I made a few changes.  But this was such a good and basic recipe, you could make a dozen changes to suit your taste and it would still be great.  I butterflied boneless, skinless chicken breasts because 1. They’re expensive and 2. A whole chicken breast is too much for me to eat anyway.  That cut the cost, calories and I think it cooked a bit faster and stayed juicier.  I ate one and my husband ate two-- perfect!  I also used chicken stock instead of wine (because we're red wine drinkers and I didn't want to buy a bottle just for this) and used breadcrumbs and an egg wash instead of flour.  I also fried the chicken for about 10 minutes then finished cooking it in the oven rather than in the sauce.  Next time I’ll try it that way to see how it tastes soaking up all that yummy sauce.  Another change: I used bacon instead of ham, because I forgot to buy ham and I don’t really like it anyway, and I added a few sautéed mushrooms inside along with the bacon and cheese.  Then the sauce and the chicken cooked in the bacon "leavin's" in the pan (although I poured off most of the bacon grease).  Will definitely make again.

I have never been compelled to review a recipe until now. Behr, this was culinary ecstasy. I made this recipe for our anniversary along with the Roasted Red Potatoes and Greens recipe from the site (and the left over wine from cooking :) ). I followed the recipe exactly along with the same cooking times, and found it to be perfect. I did however tweak the coating. Instead of coating in flour, I dipped each rolled chicken piece into a simple egg wash and then into a Parmesan and paprika bread crumb mixture. The sauce definitely makes the dish. So creamy and decadent! I saved the left over sauce to mix into store bought tomato sauce for an extra creamy version.

I'll start by saying maybe it's just me... But 99% of the time I agree with reviews on this site after making the dish. This time, I was left disappointed. The sauce is DELICIOUS! I totally agree there. But the chicken turned out rather bland minus the sauce. I followed others' recommendations to wrap the cheese inside the ham, but most of it melted out anyway. I also followed the recommendations to use seasoned breadcrumbs, which should have helped. For me, this was a lot of time and effort for minimal pay out. I'll keep searching for a new cordon bleu recipe. I will, however, make this sauce in the future to top steamed veggies and even steak.

This WAS awesome!!! I thought,"ehh swiss cheese? Thats kinda gross!" But I tried it anyways and I used turkey lunchmeat instead of ham.....they were delicious!! You cant taste the swiss really,it just gives it a little creamy sharper taste. This recipe dresses up chicken breasts a lot but it was easy to make,which is a plus. I used up leftovers the next day by making a little more sauce and serving it over rice(which btw is really good). Excellent!!!!

I was tired after work, and in a hurry, and accidently grabbed the Rumford baking powder instead of the Rumford cornstarch when I made the sauce.  Yuck!  Even so, it was wonderful, and next time I will do it right for sure!

It was good but was expecting it to be great. I'll fault myself, I do not like wine cooked into my food so I subbed chicken broth in the sauce.  Sauce was good but pretty bland, it really needed salt. Next time I'll add the salt, some garlic and pepper. Took quite a bit longer for me than 15 min on the prep, that should improve w/practice. Definitely use cooking string! The chicken wants to pull away from the toothpicks. My cheese stayed put but they could have been much prettier.

This was very tasty.  I topped the ham with swiss then put a mixture of cream cheese, parmesan cheese and thyme onto that.  I dredged it in flour, dipped in egg and coated with crushed corn flakes seasoned with with garlic salt, pepper and paprika.  I made the sauce (to serve on the side; I browned the chicken in butter then baked in the oven on a wire rack on a baking sheet) but the chicken honestly didn't need it.  Also, I thought it lacked flavor.  Next time I'll either try to tweak it or skip it all together.

Delicious!! I made this for dinner last night and got rave reviews. The sauce is amazingly good.  In fact, I doubled the sauce ingredients and served over buttered noodles.  Not the lowest calorie dish, but so worth the splurge.  Will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for such a wonderful recipe.

I made this the other night and my husband said it's one of the best things I've made! I did use bread crumbs with a sprinkle of garlic powder (and the paprika) instead of flour and I popped it in the oven for 20 mins and it turned out great! A new family favorite!

This is awesome dish. The only changes I made were using proscuitto instead of ham, panko bread crumbs and I doubled the sauce recipe. This is one of the better cordon bleu recipes.  The sauce makes the difference.

This was awesome, especially the sauce. I am giving it 4 stars because I did make a few changes. I spread Dijon mustard on each breast before adding the cheese. I also used an egg wash with garlic salt and the paprika added, and then coated each breast in Italian breadcrumbs. Finally, I seared the breasts in oil/butter for two minutes/side then finished them in a 350 degree oven for 30 minutes. I made the sauce in the skillet I used to sear the breasts. Turned out great. The sauce is especially amazing!

This was wonderful. First time making it, but it won't be the last.For the breading I used crackers,paprika, and black pepper, also  I added dijon mustard to the cream and cornstarch, and used provolone cheese instead of swiss cheese.

Easy recipe and tasted great!  I modified this by using the new Philadephia brand Cooking Creme (Savory Garlic) in the place of the corn starch and heavy whipping cream.  Used more wine and also used more flour than called for in the recipe.  It was a real hit with my family.

This chicken was AMAZING.
I decided to fry them up in a mixture of oil and butter instead of all butter, and then cook them in the oven. At first when I rolled them up I was worried they wouldn't stay together because I didn't put toothpicks in them, but as they cooked they stayed together and didn't unroll. After that I made the wine sauce. When I tried to thicken it I got lumps, but put it through a sieve to get them out. Then once it was thickened added the chicken back in and let it simmer until I got the sides ready. They were delicious. The wine flavor really came through and the sauce was so light. The ham and Swiss cheese flavor really came through without over-powering the perfectly moist chicken. Will definitely be making this again.

Amazing! I found this recipe about 6 months ago and can't get enough of it. There isn't a week that goes by that I don't prepare this meal. I am on a low carb diet and often get tired of the protein redundancy but I never get sick of this meal. I always make extra sauce and use it on whatever vegetable I'm serving. It is so easy to prepare and if you try it once, you'll be hooked too!

This recipe is awesome and easy to make.  The chicken turns out very tender, and the sauce is very creamy and flavorful.  My only complaint is that the cheese seemed to melt out quite a bit, and I even doubled that ingredient.  But the cheese that melts out just adds more flavor to the sauce.  Definitely intend to make this again!

This was a great recipe.  I was a little overwhelmed by all the other suggestions in the review so I made it just as the recipe called for(other than the fact I doubled the sauce and added fresh parcley).  Anyhow. it was wonderful!

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I adjusted the servings to two and used chicken broth instead of dry wine.  I added more broth than what was called for to have more for gravy.  It was a huge hit, and my hubby said to add this to a list of his favorites!!

It is being made today for my daughter's arrival in Daytona Beach. It already smells wonderful...might be in a rush to the airport so will make a simple sauce...perhaps with cream of chicken soup.

Okay, I never have exactly what I need for any recipe that I try to follow.  This one was no different.  I didn't have ham, so I used bacon.  I didn't have cornstarch or heavy whipping cream (I could have used alternative ingredients, but I was short on time), so I couldn't make the sauce.  Even with a little improv, this recipe was great! My family licked their plates!!!

This is my go to recipe for whenever I want something simple yet impressive. Make adjustments if you'd like, but I cook this exactly to the recipe and it is absolutely perfect, every time. Wow, just wow.

Taste was fine, although I didn't want to open a bottle of wine, so it probably would have been better.  I couldn't get the chicken to stay rolled, one of the breasts was undercooked, even though I checked the other.  It was a little hard to tell if the center was done, since it was rolled up.  It was a little bit of a disaster and I will not make again soon

I made this with 3 breasts.  If you make it using the 6 breasts then I would double the sauce. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing!

My fiancée and I just finished eating this Chicken Cordon Bleu it was just AAMAAZING! I just didn't use swiss cheese, I just don't like it, instead I used muenster cheese it has more flavor for me, anyways it was so great. My fiancée loved it and he is not a cheese person, but he said it was great. Thank you very much for this recipe

This is the BEST chicken cordon bleu. We love it, we've made it for many people as well and not one person has not liked it. We did have one person who does not like ham so we substituted bacon for her and it was excellent. Usually serve with Twice Baked Potatoes with the sauce over them...perfect meal.

Not that this recipe needs any more five star reviews however I simply had to give my two sense. It's delicious!!! My family was expecting my Yummy Yummy meatloaf so when they walked in the door I received a few 'sighs' when thy saw me cooking cordon blue.  Then they started questioning why it was not being baked. I thought about throwing it in the oven as other reciewers suggested however I like to follow the exact recipe the first time around. Needless to say no questions were asked when my family took their first bite! Def a big hit and will certainly be made (exactly the same) again!!!

I have to agree with everyone - this is the best chicken cordon blue.  The sauce was out of this world.  I read the others review and took that into consideration.  I doubled the sauce, and at the end we needed a little more! :)   I also used eggs and seared it and then put it in the oven.  Everyone loved and have asked me to make it again!!!

This was a lot easier to put together than I had always thought it would be.  Initially I was disappointed that so much of the cheese leaked out of the ends.  Once I tasted the delicious, cheese thickend and flavored sauce, I was very pleased that it did leak!  It's important to use the most flavorful ham and swiss that you can get for the best outcome.  I used grueyre and black forest ham and it was wonderfully flavored.  Thanks for this!

I have been using this recipe for years because it's one of the rare chicken dishes my husband will eat.  I substitute chicken stock when I don't have any wine on hand and sometimes I will play around with different kinds of cheese like mascarpone.  It's always a big hit with the whole family!

Just made this and it came out beautifully! Incorporated a few changes based on previous suggestions: 1) dipped the chicken in egg before coating in the flour, 2) after sauteing the chicken for 10 minutes, I threw it in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes, 3) cooked the sauce separately on the stove and poured it over the chicken upon serving.  This dish came out so moist with a great flavor. Will definitely make it again. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow...pretty incredible.  I did, however, use thicker sliced chicken scallopine breasts (which saved on the pounding), and were just as juicy if you follow the recipe as instructed.  I also used regular heavy cream, as opposed to the whipping cream and the sauce was absolutely delicious - maybe it was the pinot grigio I used, too - who knows!  I'm soo surprised that this recipe was sooo delicious and pleased a room full of very harsh critics!

EXCELLENT!  I made no variations to this recipe.  I basically folded a slice of deli ham and swiss into the chicken, making kind of like a taco shape, then pinning with a toothpick.  This meant that some of the ham and swiss were exposed during the cooking process, which seemed to really flavor the sauce.  The sauce was perfectly seasoned without adding any extra salt, again, likely due to the ham and swiss cooking somewhat in the sauce.  My only mistake was using colored toothpicks (that's all I had!) in the chicken, which did dye the chicken a bit, but no harm, no foul!  This recipe was simple and fantastic.  I can't wait to make this for my large, picky family!

So easy and so good.  Lots of cheese escaped, but it makes it back into the sauce, so no complaints on that.  I could not believe how easy this really was.  If you can buy thin-sliced chicken breast, it saves a lot of time and effort.  I think you can double the ham and swiss.

First time I have ever made this. Seemed complicated, but really wasn't once I figured out how to pound the breasts without getting it all over the kitchen... lol...  It was so good, my dad brought it for his lunch at work, and told everyone else... "hands off"... and no you can't taste it cause I'm gonna eat the whole thing!"

very good!  I might cook it a bit less next time so the chicken doesn't dry out.

The best way I found to make Chicken Cordon Bleu is use a filletting knife and cut a pocket in the chicken breast. Be careful not to cut through to the other side. Roll the ham around a piece of cheese the size of your little finger and stuff it in the chicken. Way easier, cleaner and faster!

I followed this recipe almost exactly, I was only cooking for 2 so I did 3 chicken breasts instead of 6 (and obviously 3 slices of ham and cheese) but i left all the other ingredient quantities the same in order to make extra sauce after reading the reviews. It is true the sauce is absolutely what makes this dish! Perfect recipe, but doesn't have that breaded finish like most other recipes i have tried. Perfect as is, but I may roll it in egg and coat with Italian bread crumbs next time just for a little more breading.

WOW!  Probably the best meal I've made - thanks!!  I followed advice posted to beat out the breasts more, wrap the cheese inside the ham so it wouldn't leak, add dijon mustard (I also added honey!) & used Sauvignon Blank for the wine.    Word of advice - don't use colored toothpicks unless you want festive lines in the meat:)

I have made this twice now and everyone always raves! The first time I used ham and swiss, the second time I used Canadian bacon (it was all I had) and 2 strips of cooked bacon. Both times ways got great reviews from all who tasted. Only thing I will do in the future is instead of rolling up the thin chicken breast, I will slice the breast almost in half and then add the ham and cheese. The rolling process is very messy and a little dangerous with the toothpicks!

This was soooo good.  Five stars as written.  I baked it at the end a bit to get it a little more crispy after essentially boiling in the wine.  Also, instead of cornstarch, I used the leftover flour / seasoning mixture to thicken the sauce.  That sauce makes the dish.  Thanks so much for sharing!

This is one of the best tasting Chicken Cordon Bleus I have ever tasted.  The sauce that is with it adds so much to the taste.  I was surprised by just how much flavor gets into the chicken.

Great Sauce.  I breaded the chicken rolls in a mixture of seasoned bread crumbs and flour.  After browning, I transferred to baking dish and cooked at 350 for about 35 mins. At 30 minutes I spooned some sauce over and baked the last 5 minutes.  I also brined the chicken breasts for a day because brined chicken is more flavorful and moist.  I used Prociutto and swiss cheese.  This sauce is heaven.  Make extra because its that good.  You have to use wine because it is what makes this sauce. No substitutions , i suggest chardonnay.  Spoon the sauce over the chicken and over rice.  10 stars.

I followed this recipe word for word and its was incredible. Make it... you won't regret it! I had never thought of doing Cordon Bleu on the stovetop but it worked perfectly. I used a meat thermometer and took out the chicken at about 160 degrees and allowed it to finish cooking while resting. It gave me time to work on the sauce and the chicken stayed moist and wasnt overcooked.

This is the best chicken cordon bleu I have ever had...This is definitely a recipe I will save and make again and again.  The only change I made was that I put my chicken in an egg wash and I used Panko bread crumbs, then after I did that I rolled the swiss cheese in the ham and then i followed all of the same steps the recipes says.  I also tied my chicken instead of using toothpicks.

Wow! I followed the directions with only two changes. First, I doubled the sauce. Second, I didn't have any Swiss cheese on hand, so I substituted raclette. I ended up with one of my favorite chicken dishes of all time. It was amazing. The raclette cheese did add a very special flavor. Superb. Thank you so much. I'm going to make it again tomorrow night. I have to put this on the menu once a month.

I have made something similar many times, but this recipe is the best! It is very forgiving - I used milk, some flour and corn flour for the sauce instead of the cream, with the wine and butter and it was still delish.  Found out that I had no bread crumbs so ground up some croutons to add to the flour/paprika. After browning I baked in the oven as per other reviews for 25mins at 375.Put a little wine in the bottom of the pan and covered it - not dry at all!! Added the sauce on serving....mmm sooooo good!

The chicken itself is great, but the sauce makes it INCREDIBLE!!!  I used an unoaked chardonnay in the recipe and served the rest with dinner ~ to die for.  My 12 year old asked if I would make it again the next night!  I too transfered the chicken to the oven to bake at 350 for about 30 min once it was browned, mainly so I wouldn't have to keep turning it while I made the sauce and the rest of dinner.   THANK YOU BEHR!!!

I accidentally screwed this up, and it still turned out WONDERFULLY!  First, I didn't pay enough attention when I pulled the chicken out of the freezer and accidentally grabbed tenderloins.  I chopped the ham and added it to the pan.  I also added dijon mustard and some lemon juice before I topped it with the swiss cheese and put it in the oven.  It was honestly some of the most tender, succulent chicken I've ever made!  GREAT recipe!!!

This recipe is WONDERFUL! The white wine sauce makes the entire dish, and the chicken always comes out tender whether you cook it in a skillet or bake it. I've made it both ways. It is a new favorite of mine and my family's and I've even modified this dish, and used the white wine sauce, the ham, and chunks of chicken over rice and also tried it as a pasta casserole. This is definitely one of the top recipes I've found on this site!

I made this recipe for my family of four.  My husband is a big eater and I'm no slouch.  I could only get halfway through one breast and he barely cleaned his plate.  Not because the chicken wasn't good (it was *sinfully* good) but very filling.  Pan frying was essential; it's the drippings that make the sauce, and the sauce that makes the meal.  I went the whole route, with heavy whipped cream and butter.  Of course, we added noodles to the meal and they helped fill us up :)  The richness of the sauce was beyond belief; I couldn't stop nibbling the chicken even after I was so full I couldn't have eaten another bite of anything else.  I did take a number of suggestions; the Panko crumbs and garlic, and bits of swiss cheese added to sauce.  I used knitting yarn to wrap them up - remember to remove yarn *before* pouring on the sauce :)  My husband wants me to make it again - first time that ever happened!

This was quick and easy! I changed the sauce a little b/c I didn't have enough cream or half/half.  I added a can of cream of chicken to the pan of drippings after removing the chicken.  I added a little milk and heated through.  This was great and the chicken was extremely tender.

Just got done making this for dinner and it was fantastic!!!!  I did use Panko instead of flour and added garlic powder, paprika, pepper flakes, and little poultry seasoning.  Made it was only 3 chicken breasts but same amount of sauce.  There was more then enough.  My husband LOVED it and will definitely be making this again.

I made this following the directions exactly as the recipe states. I only cooked 3 chicken breasts but kept the sauce the same as specified thinking most recipes usually don't have enough sauce.  I had at least 1/2 left over.  The chicken was very tender and juicy and the sauce was SO good.

First time making this dish an wow! I always read most helpful reviews an then go from there. this is how I prepared it:  used thick chx breast an cut slits in side. took ham slices an wrapped it around cheeze(so it wouldnt leak out) an stuffed in chx. I used cooking string instead of toothpicks to seal. I used an egg wash instead of butter then rolled chx in a mixture of Panko, Paprika, Italian bread crumbs, & just a dash of garlic powder. Baked at 350 for 45mins. My mother-in-law can only have a gluten free diet so this dish was perfect! i made her chx in a seperate dish (had to use gluten free bread crumbs) put a small thin cube of butter on top of each chx when placed in oven. Right before the chx was ready I prepared the sauce, (I used a sauvignon blanc) then spooned it on ready chicken. It was out of this world! my sides were simple, broccoli an mashed potatoes with the sauce on top. YUM! DEFinitly puttin this one in rotation!!!!

These were good, the chicken was nice and juicy, easyy to make, but a mild flavor. Kids thought it was just ok. I browned in pan, then put in oven at 350 for 15 minutes, put sauce on top and returned to oven for 5 more minutes.

Followed the recipe just as instructed. It was difficult to flatten the chicken, so I filleted it in half and rolled it that way. Turned out great! DELICIOUS! Also, for the sauce, do NOT skimp. Get the heavy cream. It's flippin' glorious.

Super yummy!! I've made this twice once exactly as written and it turned out good. Next time I used smoked gouda instead of swiss because it's what I had on hand. Gouda tends to be less runny so it doesn't leak out while cooking and tastes amazing!! I also brushed each breast with egg and rolled in bread crumbs instead of flour. Definately tie the ends instead of using toothpicks, much easier. My family agrees that the Gouda makes an awesome dish even BETTER!!!

This recipe was great! Instead of ham and regular cheese I used provolone and prosciutto. Also, instead of using 6 breasts I used 4 and the sauce was the perfect amount. Thanks for the delicious recipe!

The reviews were defintely spot-on for this recipe!  I used precut thin, scallopini-stlye chicken breasts so we had 8 servings instead of 6, so I just increased all of the other ingredients.  I added grated parmesan, garlic powder, and onion powder to the flour.  I had Chardonnay on hand, so I used that for the sauce, which we thought was excellent.  Probably not good for you, but it made the dish!!  This is the best chicken cordon bleu recipe I've found to date!

I made this last night for some friends, it was wonderful.  I followed the other suggestions, and brushed with egg and used bread crumbs instead of flour.  Rolled cheese in the ham before putting in chicken and it did help to keep the cheese from oozing out while baking.  Baked for about 30 min in a 350 oven; came out perfect!  For the sauce, I didn't have whipping cream, so I used a can of cream of chicken soup added one can of water and 1 Cup of Pinot Grigio; salt and pepper and then let it simmer on the stove while the chicken was in the oven and it was delicious and very easy.   Served with angel hair pasta and asparagus wrapped in prosciutto (recipe from this website).  Great dinner, thanks!  Will definitely serve again.

AWESOME. Made it for my boyfriend's birthday last night, and now I can do no wrong! As other reviewers have written, I made these modifications to the base recipe: added a thin layer of baby spinach leaves when stuffing, coated in breadcrumbs instead of flour, sauteed in a mixture of butter AND olive oil, and when beautifully browned, I transferred them and placed in a 350 degree oven (covered with aluminum foil) while I prepared the sauce. This keeps the crispness on the breasts. To serve, I sliced the breasts (they looked sooo pretty) and drizzled the sauce on top. Also topped with a little chopped parsley (which gave it that "finished look" we all seek). I used high-end ingredients (cheese, ham, and wine), and feel they may have contributed to the overall success of this dish. OUTSTANDING.

I read a review for this recipe where the woman stated that her husband loved this and "he's more of a beef man." That instantly got my attention! I have been pleasantly surprised at how easy and delicious this is, not to mention how much my hubby likes it. The only change I make is after browning the floured chicken, I transfer it to a casserole dish and then add the wine/boullion cubes and baked covered for ~30min. Less work if you ask me! The cream sauce is awesome! This dish now has a permanent spot in my recipe book :)

This was super good and the sauce was delicious. I substituted chicken stock for the wine, but wasn't sure if I should still put in the chicken granules. Still put them in. I didn't at first and it was quite bland. As soon as I added in the granules, it was perfectly seasoned! I also used 1% milk to save on fat and it was still creamy enough for us... So don't not make because of the fat content. Substitute!

Made this almost exactly as recipe stated, except substituted half-n-half for heavy cream.  To die for!!  The sauce was heavenly.  I actually kept the chicken on Low in saute pan (used just chicken stock to simmer) after browning while I waited for hubby to get home with the wine, so some of the cheese melted into the sauce.  I think this helped add a nice flavor to the sauce.  Removed chickens, added wine, brought to a boil for a few minutes to reduce sauce, then added cream mixture.  UNBELIEVABLE sauce!!  This is one of the best recipes I've ever made from allrecipes, and I've made a lot!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was excellent!  I rolled the chicken with the ham and cheese inside and used toothpicks to hold together instead of folding in half.  It came out perfect following the cooking times in the recipe.  Highly recommend!

Wow, 5 stars is not enough for this simple recipe. It is just wonderful! I pounded the chicken breasts out to about 1/2 inch then put ham and swiss inside and rolled it up. Then I dipped in egg and then crushed Town House crackers with some bread crumbs and parmesan cheese mixed in. This was sublime!!

Amazing results!  I couldn't resist the temptation of panko from previous reviews so I did change the recipe quite a bit. I brushed inside of chicken with dijon mustard before layering ham/cheese.  I brushed chicken with beaten egg, then rolled in panko.  I browned in butter/oil combo in saute pan then transferred to oven to finish cooking. I cooked sauce seperately by warming 1 cup wine and 3 Tbls butter.  In seperate bowl, combined 2 cups half and half with 2 Tbls cornstarch, then whisked into wine sauce, brought to a simmer until thickened. Drizzled sauce over chicken and used extra on roasted potatoes.

After reading the "most helpful" reviews, I decided to prepare the chicken with an egg wash and bread crumb mixture.  I added paprika, Garlic Powder and a little Garlic salt to the bread crumbs. I tied my chicken up using cooking ties (rope) rather then the tooth picks.  I Pan fried in 3 tbs. of butter on all sides and then stuck the pan in a 350 degree oven for 25 mins. When the chicken was done baking, I transferred it to a plate and used the same pan that I browned and baked the chicken in to prepare the wine sauce.  I doubled the sauce I warmed 1 cup wine, 3 tbls. butter and 2 tsp. bullion in the pan. Mixed 2 tbls. Cornstarch and 1 cup heavy cream ¾ cup 2% milk in a separate bowl and added to the wine mixture, stirred with a whisk until it came to a boil and thickened. Sliced the cooked chicken into 1 inch rounds and placed it atop a bed of wide egg noodles.  I then topped with the creamy wine sauce and dried parsley. Served with steamed veggies w/ garlic butter. I swear this site never ceases to amaze me.  My husband thanks you.

The sauce made this extraordinary!!  I made several modifications though.  I halved the chicken and pounded 1/2inch thick (sprinkled both sides with salt, pepper, and oregano), placed the ham and swiss on top and then rolled it up, dipped the roll into a mixture of: 1 clove minced garlic, 1 egg, and chicken broth; then covered the dipped roll in 1 cup panko bread crumbs mixed with `1 tsp paprika, then FINALLY, baked at 350 for 30 minutes.  I made the sauce seperate, and drizzled it over chopped and baked poatoes seasoned with paprika, cayenne, salt, and garlic.  The chicken was moist and fork tender, and the sauce made it amazing.  My whole family went nuts for it.  My husband told me I can make it anytime :-)

Very easy to make. I followed the recipe exactly. Pounding the chicken is the key to east rolling and cooking time. Don't skimp on the wine, it gives it all the flavor. I served it with rice. Very impressive dish for company, but easy enough to make a serve for a simple weeknight dinner.

ABSOLUTELY TO DIE FOR!!  I loved this recipe.  I didn't have any paprika, so I left that out but I added some freshly ground black pepper to the flour before coating the chicken with it. I used a pinot grigio to simmer the chickeen in and i didn't have any bouillon granules so I used one bouillon cube, however it turned out a tad salty so i will reduce it to half a cube the next time I make this recipe.  I served it over rice with some butter and lemon drizzled steamed broccoli and red peppers on the side.  Everyone loved this and I will DEFINITLY be keeping this recipe around.

Yummy!!  The sauce that goes on top is to die for.  One thing I was confused about while making the recipe was whether I should empty out the juices from the chicken in the pan before I added the cream and cornstarch.  The answer is you shouldn't!  I didn't, and it was delicious!  Also, I had trouble getting my chickens rolled up perfectly with the cheese and ham inside (the ham and cheese were kind of bursting out the sides) but this is OK!  They definitely kept their shape after they were cooked and the toothpicks were removed.  This meal took a bit too long for me for a weeknight after work, but I will DEFINITELY make it again on a weekend!

EXCELLENT! My hubby and father in-law loved this chicken. They kept thanking me for dinner all night and even the next morning! =) I made mine with proscuitto instead of ham and I seasoned the chicken breast with garlic. I also used half & half instead of heavy cream. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. Next time I will probably use regular milk since the sauce thickened a little too much. Regardless, this recipe is so yummy no matter how you do it. I will definitely make this again and again!!!

OHHHH YES!!  This was GREAT!  I cooked it for my future inlaws and everyone loved it!  A few things.. per others recommendations, I rolled the cheese and ham together first, then rolled chicken around them.  The trick to keeping everything in the chicken is refrigerating the breasts after you roll them (no toothpicks or twine needed) for an hour or so and THEN rolling in flour and cooking.  Also, I put a little garlic powder in the flour mix.  I browned on the stovetop for about 5-7 minutes on each side, then baked in the oven at 350 for about 35 minutes.  I cooked the sauce seperately in a saucepan and served on the side.  The sauce was AMAZING.  I was worried that it would taste too "wine-ey," but it was perfect.  Great all-around, and will definitely be making again!

Great easy recipe.  My husband loved it and I've even made the sauce and chicken without the ham and cheese and served with rice.  The sauce is the best part and VERY easy.

Very good. I wrapped my Swiss cheese with the ham "Burrito" style before putting it inside the pounded chicken breast. I think this helped to keep more of the cheese inside the chicken apposed to leaking out into the sauce. I also tied the chicken with roast-string once around the middle. This made handling the chicken very easy and I didn't have to worry about the toothpicks getting in the way during the browning stage. Served with white rice and steamed broccoli. Great dinner. Thanks for the recipe.

Love this dish.  It's not as complicated as it sounds, it's just chicken roll ups!  I do not normally care for wine-based sauces but I think the wine MAKES this.  Really, really yummy.

Update:  I love the sauce but honestly, there's no need to double it, the recipe as written is perfect.

This turned out soooooooooo good....I cook but i tend to get nervous with new recipes...but this one was a GREAT one....I did take some suggestions...I soaked the chicken in Italian Dressing for about 5 hours. As far as how i folded up the ham and cheese. I did 2 slices of ham sandwiched between i slice of cheese then i rolled it up in the chickedn. I followed the directions exactly as posted in directions #1. I followed the directions listed in #2 but i let the chicken sit on the stove for about 15 mins then i put it in the oven for the remainder of the cooking. After the chicken was done i removed the toothpick then added the sauce and i let it sit. It tasted sooooooooo good.....

Like everyone else I think this was just fabulous! I used sherry and I halved the cream and used chicken stock for the rest and put lots more in so we'd have lots 'o sauce. Terrific and tasty.

Oh my gosh, this was fantastic!  I found my chicken was very easy to roll since I pounded them well.  Even if you mistakenly make a hole in the breast the ham seals it so your cheese doesn't leak out.  What I did find difficult was to remove the toothpicks after the rolls were cooked.  I coated my rolls with a combo of flour, breadcrumbs & seasoning.  After browninging in butter/olive oil I removed the rolls and added wine, bullion and 2% milk to the skillet.  I returned the rolls to the pan and simmered for 30 minutes covered, turning frequently.  I also doubled the liquid ingredients.    After simmering, I removed the rolls and thickened the sauce with a cornstarch slurry; served the sauce on the side.  I will certainly make this again.  Note: Careful of how much salt you add, the ham may be salty enough.  I didnt need any between the ham and bullion granules.

obviously this recipe is awesome as most of these reviews are a testiment... and is definitely a winner in my house but i have one tip as a few people have said there is an "oozing" effect (even tho the cheese adds a nice flavor to the sauce) you can tie the chicken and everything up with some simple thread and snip and unwind it at the end of cooking and end up with a nice happy bundle!

I served this wonderful recipe last night for a small dinner party. Everybody loved it!!! I read some of the reviews before I made this and took some advice.  I breaded my chicken instead of floured and I used 1/2 butter & 1/2 olive oil for browning.  I then baked the chicken for 30 minutes. Ask for thin sliced ham & cheese at the deli counter and pound chicken breasts a little thinner for a roll that won't require picks or string. YUMMY!  I will serve this again & again.

Great recipe!  I baked mine and heres what I did.
I did wrap my cheese with the ham.  I made a slit in the fattest part of the chicken and made a pocket for the cheese/ham to fit the length of the chicken.  I then toothpicked the end, salt and peppered the chicken breast. Took a casserole dish, Pam sprayed it and added the chicken breast. Added about 1/4 cup of water. Baked covered at 350' for 50 mins. I did not use the flour and paprika step being I did not fry mine.   I then made the sauce using the butter, wine, bouillon, half & half and cornstrach all as stated in the recipe. Brought to a boil and then simmered low until chicken was ready. I served mine with buttered noodles but also mixed in some sauce to the noodles. All came out heavenly!

This is really, really good.  I made this after work one night and it was fast and easy and oh so good.  The only thing I did different was to use half/half Instead of the heavy cream and I topped it with fresh chives from my garden.  I Served it with rice, steamed broccoli and cranberries for an amazing beautiful meal.  The sauce is very good and next time I might add some mushrooms to it.  Oh, yes there will be many more times for this one.  Thank you for this one.

I made this for dinner last night, and it turned out very well. I don't even like chicken in the first place, but this dish certainly turned me on to it. I couldn't find halved chicken breasts, so I used boneless, skinless, trimmed chicken breast tenders, and they were a breeze to fill & cook! Rolling the tenders around the filling was a cinch, and I did not experience any cheese leakage during cooking. Also, instead of simmering them in the skillet for 30 minutes, I was able to reduce cooking time by half (since the tenders were so thin). The wine seemed to cook off quickly, even on low heat, so I added about 1/2 a cup more than the recipe called for. My only problem was the sauce. I think it would have been better with half & half (or even whole milk), because when I combined the heavy whipping cream and the cornstarch to the wine mixture, it quickly formed a gelatinous lump. It still tasted alright, but it wasn't a pretty sight. I will definitely be making this recipe again (with all my aforementioned tweaks, of course!)

Oh. My. Goodness. This was delicious! I've heard of Chicken Cordon Bleu before but have never made/got to taste it, until last night. Time-consuming wrapping everything up, but well worth it! I added some basil in my sauce, and added a couple drops of sherry. Sooo good, thanks for sharing Behr. :D

When I've had Chicken Cordon Bleu in the past, I never remember especially liking it. I thought I'd give it another chance with this recipe and I was so glad I did. My boyfriend and I both agree that this is one of the tastiest meals I've made. The only thing I did differently than the recipe is add a lot more wine (Pinot Grigio). I served it with green beans, which was nice. Next time I'll also make a some mashed potatoes too, because the sauce would go well with it! Next time I might also add mushrooms to the sauce, just to change it up.

I stuck to the recipe except I made only 2 breasts because its just the 2 of us. I like sauce so there was plenty of it. It was pretty good, next time I will add a bit of garlic and maybe some mushrooms. Steamed broccoli and wild rice as the sides went well. I agree its not too "cordon bluish" but it was good. I will make it again.

Excellent.  Did what other suggested. 1/2 butter, 1/2 oil.  Used chicken thighs instead of breast - they are so much more jucier! Steamed broccoli with the chicken after and added basil to the cream as suggested.  Great recipe!

I've never made chicken cordon bleu before, but I have eaten it many times. This was a treat for me to do. Easy & very yummy. I give it 4 stars because the sauce was too thin. I ended up having to use more cornstarch to make it thicker. But other than that... a winner!

This is really good.  I switched the heat to medium low instead of low after 30 minutes since there was still some pink in the middle.  After about 15 minutes on medium low it cooked through well.  Everybody I made it for liked it a lot, as did I.  Oh and I used half and half instead of heavy cream.

Absolutely amazing. I breaded the chicken with egg and paprika seasoned breadcrumbs before browning it, and I doubled the cream sauce to use with steamed broccoli. Everyone LOVED it!

Great recipe. My husband liked it alot! I used proscuitto for the ham and muenster cheese in place of the swiss cheese...only because we didn't feel like going back to the store. Only thing I will do differently is coat the chicken breasts alot more with the flour paprika mixture. Will make it again, even for guests!

I was a little disappointed in the sauce. Based on the reviews, I thought it would be outstanding. However, my husband took one bit, apologized, and told me he couldn't eat this. The chicken itself was better than the sauce. Next time I won't make it, as it's not worth the extra fat and calories from the cream. I'll also cut the butter in half (was swimming in it.) My cheese also melted out, but I expected that. Probably a 4 star recipe in my  book without the sauce. Thanks for a good start!

very good!  I actually found some chicken that was thin sliced at the grocery store so less time preparing.  I loved the sauce, too.  I used chicken broth instead of wine, though.  Excellent!  I will put this on my meal rotation. Thanks.

i was making the dish for a group and tried out making just one to see how it went...i also had a hard time keeping the breading on while pan frying it.  when i made it the next day i used shake & bake to bread the flattened chicken before filling and rolling...i baked it in a deeper pan and added the "sauce" to the pan after a few min of letting the crust brown
the wine sauce was excellent, i added just a little swiss cheese to it..recommend pouring sauce thru strainer to filter out any lumps for nicer presentation

This recipe was delicious.  The only change was the fact I used light cream instead of heavy whipping cream.  It did not hinder the taste whatsoever by doing so.

One word.... WOW!!!  I made this last night for my husband for Valentine's Day and he could not stop raving about them.  They were so delicious and the best cordon bleu I we have ever eaten, even at restaurants.  I used cooking sherry instead of white wine and the sauce was to die for!  I also double battered the chicken (egg, flour, egg, bread crumbs), and finished them off in the oven.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THIS RECIPE!!!!!!!!!!

For the amount of work it took to roll these up, seal with toothpicks and make the sauce, it wasn't THAT great. It was good but maybe a simpler recipe would be better for me.

It was good and had good flavor, a little too salty.  The cooking time could be shortened if you make the breasts thinner.

Great flavor and moist!  I'll try to butterfly the chicken next time as suggested.  Also I couldn't get the toothpicks out.  Makes for bad presentation.  I am a known below average cook and this tasted good even from my kitchen.  Thanks!

This tasted fantastic! I'd never made Chicken Cordon Bleu before and it was so simple to make and the sauce complimented the chicken very well, with the sweet flavor of the ham *I used honey ham* and the melted swiss cheese...mmmmmm. The whole family enjoyed this recipe and I hope to make it again very soon! :) Thanks for posting it!

Loved it. Make sure to  pound chicken breasts to about 1/4" thickness. The sauce was fantastic. My only complaint is that my guests thought the chicken was a little dry and that I could have cooked it for less time, so next time I will try simmering for 20 minutes instead of 30.

This has to be one of the best discoveries yet on this site!  Dinner's been over for a while now but my boyfriend is still emoting about how much he liked this!  My presentation needs improvement, but the taste was absolutely divine.  I used a pinoir grigio for the white wine, used a whole stick of butter, followed another review's lead in spreading a little dijon mustard on the chicken before adding the cheese and ham, and added a little pepper to the flour mixture.  This recipe is company worthy, but it's so good I'm going to make up special occasions just so we may have it often at home!  Thanks for the submission!

Soooo good. With little experience with cooking, I was still able to pull off a great dinner thanks to this recipe! One possible idea for next time is to use sherry instead or in addition to white wine. Either way its an excellent recipe.

This was very very good but i too  made some changes. First i pounded the chicken then added some garlic powder to the chicken before placing the ham in cheese in the middle then dipped in a beaten egg and bread crumbs cooked it in a little olive oil and butter till lightly browed on each side then place it in oven for 20 minutes 10 on each side sprinkled the chicken a bit of white wine while cooking. Mixed the rest if the ingredients in a bowl and added it to chicken and let it simmer for another 10 minutes.  DELICIOUS!!!! and well worth the effort!!

I have been making this recipe for several years.  It is one of my husband's favorites.  Also a really easy way to impress dinner guests, tastes divine, takes next-to-no time.  Everyone loves the white wine sauce, I recommend doubling it and serving over garlic mashed potatoes.  Also, steamed carrots with butter and parsley. Definately not your low-cal low-fat meal, but very very very yummy!

Where do I start? I am my own worst food critic. I have never tried to make Chicken Cordon Bleu and picked this recipe because of the rave reviews. As, I sat and ate this the only thing I could say was yum, yum, yum. The only thing I could criticize was I didn't make enough sauce!!! The second time I made it I doubled the sauce and I used half and half instead of heavy cream.PERFECT!! This is an AWESOME recipe. Picky hubby thinks this is the best meal I make!! Thank You!

I noticed someone had said they needed help removing the toothpicks.  I use the metal turkey stays that come in the little trussing packages at the store - they look like giant needles w/big eyes.  They are SO easy to remove and are longer than toothpicks so they secure the meat better too.

Its true.  This really is as good as everyone says and not that difficult to make.  Ours were so fat there was no way toothpicks were going to hold so we tied them up with string and that worked perfectly.  Next time I'll use a really good dry white wine instead of the cheap stuff.  Its worth it.  Also, on one of them I inadvertently rolled it up with the inner, rough side of the chicken on the outside.  That one was the best one because it held the most coating.

This was unreal!  We cook almost every night and this one will be added to our rotation.  Great sauce!  I used rosemary and sundried tomato ham by Boars Head.  It was delicious. Awesome Recipe!  My husband said it is in the top 5 of best dinners I have ever made.

This dish is excellent!  It's the sauce that really makes it special.  I have tried this with half-and-half instead of the whipping cream, and it came out just as well.  The substitution might be a good way to lighten up the recipe a little bit.

So much grease!  It didn't dawn on me until the very end of experience that a "gravy" not grease sauce was the intent.  Loads of red grease. I will try this recipe again, but will compensate by skimming out grease before doing the heavy cream/cornstarch deal.  The red grease probably came from too much butter & cheese fat, red came from paprika.  This recipe would probably come out much better if baked (and separate sauce prepared with some of the drippings (not a pan full of greasy muck). But my grocery stores on strike ...

this recipie had good taste and it looked good, however mine took alot longer than expected. I put it in the skillet for about 20, with broth and boullion and then into the oven with the mix. This gave it a crispy outside and a nice look, it took about 1 hour my chicken to cook all the way. It was worth the time and effort. Like others I used chicken broth and I added a extra slice of cheese at the end...yummy!

this was very good, I changed some of the prep. instead of using toothpicks I just fried the chicken halves and put the ham and cheese on top after. I made the sauce and poured over the chiken and baked. It turned out great and alot easier to prepare.

This is my first time making this dish and ever trying it and I didn't really care for it.  Just wasn't for me.  My sister's thought it was good, but not fantastic.  Maybe we just aren't chicken cordon bleu fans.  I am giving it a 4 because they liked it.

This recipe was great!  I've never really cooked with wine before, but it helped to make the sauce very scrumptious.  I also cheated and bought the cordon bleu already prepared from the local meat market, so this meal was very fast to prepare.

This turned out great.  I had a hard time keeping the cheese in the chicken though.  I think I need to beat it a little thinner next time.  It was delicious.  The sauce was great, I will try half and half next time though just to cut down on fat.  Not as difficult as I thought it would be either.  Will definately make again.

This was a lot easier than I thought.  My guests loved it, with the exception of their 7 year old child,  who normally loves chicken cordon bleu.  She hated the sauce.  The rest of us however, thoroughly enjoyed it.

I liked this recipe.  It tasted good and was easy.  The only reason that I gave it a 3 for quickness, is that it took a little longer then I expected to get it together.  My husbands only critique was that he likes a crustier breading on his chicken cordon blue, and this one was very light, I liked it that way.  The sauce definitely makes the recipe.  Don't be shy w/ the sauce.  I will make this again, only try to modify the breading a little next time.

easy to make but would have been bland if i hadn't added garlic and herbs to the flour prior to coating. i think simmering covered in the pan made for a moist chicken. the sauce was rich and creamy because the melted swiss created a bechamel sauce effect. really good but had to kick it up a notch.

I read a lot of both the negative and the positive reviews of this recipe prior to making this and I find that most of the complaints are due to poor execution and not due to any fault in this recipe, that being said this is not a recipe for beginners and requires a bit of finesse to get right.
    Everything turned out lovely. The chicken MUST be pounded out (Recommend approx 1/2 inch thickness) Useful trick... sandwich the chicken breasts one at a time between 2 layers of saran wrap on top of a cutting board (you can reuse the saran wrap for about 2-3 breasts)before you tenderize the meat as this will keep the mess/clean up to a minimum. For the ham and Swiss cheese inside I chose smoked varieties of both and had them sliced on the medium/thick side. In addition to the base recipe I used 2 chicken bouillon cubes instead of the granules (it was what I had on hand), about 1 cup pinot grigio, 1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream and 1 1/2 tablespoons of corn starch. Sauce thickened up nicely and had plenty of flavor. We like a lot of sauce.
    To quote my brother "I could eat this every day!" 

P.s. Fresh steamed broccoli goes great on the side and the sauce tastes amazing on it!!!

This is a new family favorite! The only thing I do differently is that after rolling the ham and cheese into the chicken, I try to make sure the cheese is the last layer touching chicken-to-chicken when I'm done rolling.  Then I wrap it in aluminum foil and bake at 400 for about 30-40 minutes depending on the size of the breast. The cheese acting as a glue, together with the baking process, virtually removes the need to toothpick the chicken and work around the toothpicks in the dredging & frying process. After baking, unwrap, carefully "towel off" the chicken, dredge and fry until golden -  for about 10-15 minutes.  The chicken comes out moist and super delicious. Thanks for the great recipe!

I follow the ingredients EXACTLY. I pound the chicken flat but instead of rolling them, I stack a flat piece of chicken with the cheese and ham and just pile another flat piece of chicken on top. Toothpick them together and fry it like a sandwhich. Much easier than rolling them. After frying them, bake it for 30 minutes, make the sauce separately and pour on right at the end. Cut the chicken in half and each person gets the equivalent of one whole piece.

My 13 year old daughter wanted to make dinner. She found this recipe and completely made it by herself!! The only part she did differently was to make the sauce in a separate pan, due to misunderstanding "in the skillet" This dish is nothing short of EXCELLENT thanks for sharing.

My husband is not easy to please, but he loved this recipe.  I paired it with roasted red potatoes and glazed carrots.

Instead of the bouillon & 1/2 cup of wine, I added 1/4 cup of vegetable broth and 1/4 cup cooking sherry.  This recipe made about four times as much sauce as was necessary.  It was so delicious, I hated to pour it down the drain.

Wow. This was excellent. My boyfriend and his son couldn't get enough of the sauce. Really yummy. Made exactly to recipe except I did an egg wash on chicken and used breadcrumbs not flour. Next time I will look for thinner ham as it was thick and hard to roll the chicken.

Oh, this was tasty! I made this on the spur of the moment, and had neither ham nor Swiss cheese....but I did have some prosciutto and fontina, and the results were wonderful. Next time I will make it exactly as written, and I am sure it will be just as good. Thank you, Behr!

Made it like the recipe the first time, came out really good. The second time, however, I cut the chicken breasts in half lengthwise. Put the ham slices down on the chicken breasts after cutting, topped with swiss cheese, and folded the ham slices on the sides and ends inward to help keep the cheese from melting out. Then folded the chicken sides and ends inward over the ham, then rolled up and secured. Keeps the cheese in much better. I did double the wine and whipping cream, the sauce was too good not to! The second time around was a little more work but came out much better. This is now one of my "go to" or "fall back" recipes when invaded by my kids teenage friends, or cooking for horse show meetings/after show parties.

Today I cooked the cordon bleu and it was just delicious. Instead of just flour I also dipped it in an egg-milk mix and afterwards in bread crumbs. 
As a side I made veggies (mini potatoes, zucchini and carrots) and rice.
Totally recommendable. Fry it in the pan until gold brown and afterwards you can put it in the 350' oven for about 15 min. And then it is ready to be served. 
Just to let you know: if you wrap the cheese into the ham, then it won't melt away and it will stay inside the cordon bleu. :)

With over 3500 reviews, this recipe doesn't need one more, but here it is anyways.   I made this recipe as written with the exception that I substituted chicken broth for the white wine.    With the ham and the chicken bouillon and the chicken broth, it does come out little on the salty side but it is sooooooooo worth it.   The sauce is wonderful with no other seasonings or spices needed.   I wondered how a recipe with almost no seasonings could be tasty, but it is.   It's very simple to make.   I will make again, and again, and again.

Awesome easy to make dish....I had two leftover so I froze and will pull out next week and have for dinner. I pounded the breasts out to a semi flat state and then laid my ham and swiss down. I did a "foldover" in half and tooth picked....got great results. Let it simmer for an extra 5 minutes though, from 30 min simmer to 35 minutes simmer. Everyone loved it and made a perfect Valentines Day dinner with brocolli and new potatoes.

Husband and guests loved this recipe.  Next time I would use smaller chicken breasts and pound them a little thinner.  I would also definitely go with tying them closed rather than trying to use toothpicks (which were not very effective after pounding the meat).  Other than that just follow the recipe exactly and you will be sure to hear plenty of compliments thereafter!

I'd never made Chicken Cordon Bleu in my life!  But I was drawn to this recipe by the amount of people who gave it a five-star rating.  It was not difficult to make and it came out absolutely awesome.  (I didn't make any changes at all.)  I have made it for my last three dinner parties and it was a hit every time.  Definitely a keeper!

So good! The second time around we made a few changes... We filled the chicken with swiss cheese and bacon, coated the chicken in panko bread crumbs and sprinkled cracked pepper on it and baked it. Made the sauce and spooned it over the chicken, so so good! New family favorite.

This was a very good recipe, but the basil at the end really made the sauce. I doubled the sauce and had about 2 cups left over. I added another batch to it, doctored it up a bit (peppers, sun dried tomatoes, one of the left over chicken cordon blue breasts), and used it as the sauce for chicken tortellini the next evening. It was very good.

Great! I didn't have swiss cheese though (I know how much some people hate it when you review recipes with like 8 substitutions so that you've basically made up your own food), but cheddar is freaking delicious on these (and I also followed the rest of the directions like a boss)! The first time the chicken seemed a little dry, so I stuck a bit of butter on the bottom of it, and where the chicken ends overlapped. The (very picky) boyfriend loved it.

This is my boyfriend's absolute favortie meal...I think he'd eat it every night if he could. I took the suggestion of other reviewers and browned the chicken/ham/swiss first (egg coating and rolled in italian style bread crumbs) and then baked in the oven.  I keep the wine sauce separate and it turns out perfect every time. Thank you so much for the recipe! Its definitely in my list of keepers :)

Best Recipe EVER! I have been making this recipe over and over for about a year now and I still love it. I have made it for every person I know and they all love it. My husband loves when I use bacon instead of ham. I love the sauce. Sometimes I will make the sauce to put over noodles as a side dish. Make sure to put plastic wrap over chicken before pounding it thiner or else it will fall apart. Love this and you will to.

This recipe is so good and super easy!  My local grocery store sells thinly sliced chicken breasts, as opposed to the thick ones that you usually see so that's what I got for this dish.  I took one users advice and cut the breasts into 1" strips and I'm quite sure it worked out better, since it makes the dish a lot less bulky.  Also, I'm always afraid of chicken (thinking that I will under cook it) but because this was so thin, there was no question about whether or not it was done.  It's so picturesque too!  It looks like a real chef's plate.

This was just a trial run for me - I wanted to cook my mom something nice for Mother's Day and decided I would test this out.  I didn't have any chicken bouillon so I used beef...usually not a good idea but the recipe didn't suffer at all.  I didn't make any other changes and it turned out really well.  I made it with an herb rice (my own recipe) and broccoli.  It was great!

Absolutely delicious!  I follow the recipe exactly, and it comes out perfect!  The only thing  I change is making double the sauce because it's that good!  One of my family's favorites by far!

Chicken was excellent.  What type of wine did you folks that loved the sauce use? We thought the sauce was yuck!

Very good.  I used left over spiral sliced ham from Easter, and the ham was way too thick in my opinion.  The flavors were great, but don't use too much ham it overpower the chicken and sauce.

This was very good.  My picky teenaged son loved it, and so did my husband, both picky eaters (okay, so the son picked out the ham and cheese).  I forgot to add the cornstarch, but it was fine.  I used leftover ham and the slices were a bit on the thick side, which affected rolling it up. I browned each breast and then stuck them in the oven to finish cooking, while I made the sauce on the stove.  Yummy!

The sauce is excellent and totally deserves 5 stars. I love the way some of the cheese leaks out from the breasts and gets mixed in with the sauce. I just seem to prefer baking my stuffed chicken breasts, it's easier and less messy. I have found another recipe for the breasts and use elements of this sauce to top them.

I wanted to do something fancy for dinner one night. I ran across this recipe and it was a HIT. This has become a regular dish in our house. My only problem has been keeping the chicken closed without toothpicks. Any sugguestion?

Perfetto! Insanely incredible recipe for all 4* palates. I made it with "Mushroom Risotto." I highly recommend mellow side dishes to counter the bold and powerful tastes of such creamy, buttery, and rich dishes. Simple broccoli, asparagus, or peas are brilliant counters to such salivating recipes! 

This was incredible!

What a simple meal to make.  Instead of frying the chicken, I put it in the oven at 350 for about 1 hr.  My  chicken was thick.  I also rolled the chicken in plain bread crumbs with a little garlic pepper salt before I put it in the oven.  Everyone loved it.  I definitely will make this again and again and again.

Excellent, and kid-approved! I took others' suggestions and used an egg wash and herb & garlic bread crumbs to coat the chicken, then browned it in oil and butter before finishing it off in the oven. I made the sauce per the directions but it wasn't to our taste, so I added more cream to dilute it a bit, then added garlic and pepper. The chicken was even better with the modified sauce!

Amazing!! Worth more than five stars for sure. Everyone in my family loves it. My dad teases company that we invited them over just because he wanted my mom to make this dish:) Company always raves about how tender the chicken is. The two changes we make are to use water or chicken broth in place of the wine, and bread crumbs in place of flour. Turns out excellent every time!! Thanks so much for sharing!!

Very good recipe!  I added a tad of garlic to the flour mixture, not sure if it made a difference but still very good!  I also had no heavy whipping cream so I just used milk and added a little extra butter and cornstarch.

This was fantastic! I made it for Christmas, along with a tenderloin, and it was a huge it and there was nothing left. My first time making chicken cordon blue and it was much easier than I thought it would be. Can't wait to make it again.

I used this recipe as is in a cook off practice run for my 4-H Club.  They had 1hour and 20 minutes to complete an entire meal and serve their parents.  It was easy for them to make, the directions were complete and the dinner was fantastic!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

Oh my!  If I could give this recipe 6 or 7 stars I would!  I made it exactly as it is here and it was AMAZING!!!!  My family LOVED it!  Even my super, incredibly over the top picky eater devoured it!  This was a definite hit and my family thinks I'm super mom now because of it!  This is definitely one we will make again!  Absolutely DIVINE!!!!!

We all loved this recipe: parents, teens, and elementary-aged kids!   We didn't change a thing and were completely impressed!  We'll make this again soon.  We served it with garlic/cheesy mashed potatos and green beans.  YUM!

i will be making this again for sure! i used some left over canadian bacon instead of ham b/c that's all we had, and used chicken broth instead of wine b/c i'm pregnant and didn't want to open a bottle (and waste the rest) just for this meal. i used raw whole milk instead of whipping cream because we didn't have any- it still came out delicious! thanks for posting!

I made this tonight for dinner.  It was so good. My family loved it.  I did as other suggested and browned the chicken, then put in the oven at 350 for 25 min. I closed up the chicken as much as I could by using dry fettuccine noodles(instead of toothpicks) so that the cheese would not melt out on the ends. doing this I only had a little bit of cheese melt out of the chicken.

Very Savory.  No real changes other than simmering the chicken, being I had the time, for an hour and half on low in the already prepared wine sauce which was made in pan after chicken seared.  All simmering together which made the dish easier as far as pan and prep. Used more white wine, less butter, no cornstarch but added some of the flour mixture that the chicken was coated in.  Cant really go wrong with this because any way you decide to change it it will be just fine.

Delicious!  As some suggested, I browned the rolled up chicken and then baked them at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  I simmered the sauce and placed over the finished chicken.  I also added garlic when browning them and to make this gluten free, used a mixture of peanut flour and cornmeal instead of the flour.  It was great!

We had this today for Christmas dinner, and it did not disappoint!  After reading other reviews, I decided to brown the chicken in the pan, then I finished it in a 400F oven for 20 minutes--the same time and temp needed for my roasted asparagus.  I doubled the amount of sauce because I'd rather have too much sauce, rather than not enough.  Again... Delicious!  The sauce was looking pretty thick with the heavy cream, so I used half-and-half to substitute for half of the cream.  I will definitely make this again.

very easy and delicious. I scaled it down to 2, but made sauce for 4 to serve as gravy over mashed potatoes. It didn't take long to make at all. I followed what another reviewer suggested and after I browned it I put the chicken in the oven. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written and it was a big hit!

This is fabulous, especially the sauce! I prefer the traditional method of an egg wash and flour so you can't really use the same pan for the sauce but the extra step makes a big difference. I also added a bit ground rosemary and paprika to the flour, but overall a great recipe!! Bon appetit!

I made this last night and it was terrific. I ended up folding my chicken in half because I was out of toothpicks, and I liked it better than rolling.  (more surface area for browning) This is a simple, tasteful recipe that I would highly recommend to anyone interested in adding Chicken Cordon Bleu to their dinner rotation.  I think this would also work well for a dinner party or special evening.

Normally I agree with the reviews on this site after making the dish but I would not make this again.  I followed the recipe exact and found it a lot of time an effort for minimal pay out.  I suspect I cooked it too long (the recommended 30 minutes), as all my cheese melted out.  There's no hint on how to keep all the cheese from melting out of the roll.  I did not like the sauce in particular.  This did not taste like what I remember as Chicken Cordon Bleu.

I liked this.... I always have trouble with rolling the chicken so I used chicken tenders and just layered the ham and then the Swiss cheese and put under the broiler to brown the top... I used my leftover ham from Easter and just cubed the ham and put on top of chicken.. The sauce is so good and my kids both had seconds... It turned out so good.. I will always layer this dish and forget the fuss of trying to roll and toothpick the chicken. I will for sure make this again

This dish turned out wonderful and was well worth the work. As with other reviewers, I strongly recommend doubling the sauce (I did). I also used chicken boullion in place of the wine. The dish turned out wonderful paired with the Mushroom Rice Pilaf (also on this site). Thank you for a tasty and relatively easy chicken dish!

I enjoyed this recipe, but would omit rolling in flour when I make it again. I doubled the sauce thanks to everyone else's suggestion. I served the sauce on the side as my husband doesn't care for cream sauces, the rest of us finished every drop!

This is amazing.  I made it for my husband for our anniversary and he loved it too!  I didn't change a thing!!!  It is very rich, so not an every-day meal, but it's great for special occasions.  The left-overs heated up nicely as well!

Better than any chicken cordon bleu at any restaurant I've ever had it at! My boyfriend and I both loved it! Pounded out the chicken to half an inch as recommended and used a little more than a half cup of white wine for extra sauce. Served over linguine and the sauce was enough for both the chicken and pasta. Awesome dish! A must try for anyone who loves creamy chicken

Excellent. I did not change a thing. I only added 1tsp of minced garlic the last 10 min of cooking. I DID NOT modify as others using bread crumbs or the oven. I used the flour and the skillet as the recipe suggested.

What a great recipe!  I followed other reviews and doubled the sauce...fantastic!  Even my picky 13yr old asked for seconds.  It was easy to make w/my daughter...she used provolone in hers instead of swiss...and we'll be adding this one to our regular rotation.  The whole family was coming up w/other ideas for this sauce too, it was delicious!

In one word...amazing!  The only complaint I have ( and this is just because I'm picky) is the fat content.  But I suppose if you're making cordon bleu you shouldn't care.  Simple, relativley quick, and delicous.

I give it 4 stars only for the fact that there is no hint on how to keep all the cheese from melting out of the roll. as for taste and ease to make It would get a 5. I added the suggestion of using the sauce from "Aussie Chicken"before the ham and cheese. I also topped each piece with a dab of butter before going into the oven. I forgot to make the sauce (DUH) but the sauce inside from the Aussie Chicken made up for it. i look forward to making this again with the sauce.

Flavorful and enjoyed recipe.  There seemed to be way too much butter and sauce, we could have done with half of it, so that is the reason for 4 stars.

I only made a couple of changes.  I coat the chicken in Italian Bread Crumbs in lieu of the flour/paprika mixture.  I brown that in the butter, add a dash of cooking sherry, cover and cook in the oven.  I use the cooking sherry, bouillon, cream and either tarragon or basil (depending on the mood) in the sauce.  I don't mess with the cornstarch. It ends up thick enough after cooking slowly.  So delicious!

This was by no means a light dinner, nor quick for a weeknight. But it was absolutely delicious. Didn't change a thing, served with rice pilaf. Terrfic.

Wow!  I've been wanting to make a Chicken Cordon Bleu dish for a while, not knowing how my family would like it.  I found this recipe and they LOVED it!!  My son, and husband can be extremely picky with anything that has a white sauce, and my son was begging for more!  My husband is still raving about this.  I follwed the recipe exactly as it is; however I used Low Sodium Deli Ham.  The portions were a tad small given to a growing boy and my husband, so next time I will "stuff" the chicken instead of rolling it up and see if that helps. Using the recipe as it was given and it turned out perfect!  Thanks so much!!  I will be using this as another weeknight meal again for sure!

Yum! My only issue was the sauce getting very greasy after only a couple minutes in the pan. But...we like all the calories we can get so we ate it with no complaints.

Kid and parent friendly (3 of 4 picky kids liked it, and 1 ate it despite complaints - that's a big win around here).  Made exactly as directed except that I subbed half and half for the whipping cream and didn't need to cook it 30 minutes (more like 20-22, I think, because I pounded it to just a little over 1/2 inch).  Served with steamed broccoli and with linguine noodles.  Not all the kids wanted the sauce, but they liked it fine without.  I subtracted one star because the pounding of the chicken took me forever, probably only because the pieces I started with were enormous and still slightly frozen...hopefully that will work out easier and less messy next time)!

Excellent! I doubled the sauce, pouring it over the chicken and finishing in the oven. I recommend using paper thin slices of ham so the saltiness of the ham doesn't overpower the chicken.

Fabulous! I made this for a dinner party I was having. Everyone loved it & was asking for recipe. I made it with some sauteed garlic aspargus, rice pilaf & choc cake! I agree with most, double your sauce! People were pouring it all over the rice too! Left overs good too! This one is going in my recipe box for sure:)

Very good recipe - I baked mine as well after browning in a pan with butter. I made the gravy afterwards with wine, chicken stock, cornstarch and a small amount of half and half. Goes well with a green veggie and a salad.

Wow, close to the recipe I have, but with 1/2 the calories.  Already printed it off to make.  But I think I will still add my fresh mushrooms to the sauce and fresh asparagus rolled up in it. Ham, cheese, 2 steamed fresh asparagus's, I will have to compair the 2 recipes.

My current recipe at over 1,000 calories, I (sorry) only make once in a bleu moon.

Great, great, great recipe! I never made fresh cordon bleu before and it was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! I hammered the chicken breasts to thin them out and then  salted them with sea salt and parsley flakes/fresh-ground pepper. I also added a dash or two of Maggi and some whole peppercorns to the sauce! One of my favorite recipes from the site!

Great recipe, the only change I made was that I doubled the sauce and used half whipping cream, half 1% milk.  It was still delicious and plenty thick.  I browned the chicken on the stovetop and finished them off in the oven, as others suggested.  Made my sauce in the pan I browned the chicken in.  Used the wine to deglaze the browned bits from the chicken and added cream, etc.  I also recommend using string to tie up the chicken.  My family loved this recipe!

Amazing! I didn't fully brown in the pan though. I did about 10 minutes each side in the butter before I transferred to a pan in the oven, then drenched it in the wine right at the end. I made the cream sauce seperate on the stove and poured over top after. This will be something I plan on making again!

EZ & Delicious! I used 4 Tbsp butter, not 6, and Half & Half not cream. Next time I'll use cooking sherry instead of wine. And I'd throw in 1lb of mushrooms. Keeper. Note to self: Lowest flame.

I scaled this recipe down for 2 people and it turned out great!! Very delicious, the chicken was so tender. There was a bit to much of the sauce left over at the end but other then that mmm wonderful! Will be making again soon.

This was AMAZING! I didnt have white wine, so I used 1 cup of water and about a teaspoon of vinager. I also used 8 peices of chicken, but cut into smaller peices. The sauce was awesome! My 4 year old is so picky, and just loved it! She ate two whole peices! It was just so good. Definately will make it again! :)

So So So So Very Delicious!!  Everyone in my family loved it.  Leftovers were few but yummy as well. The chicken was great on its own but add the cream sauce and this dish is absolute nirvana.

Loved this and so did my family and my husband doesn't love chicken!  I did use several of the ideas in other reviews. I didn't have wine so I used chicken broth, I used egg and bread crumbs.  I have the waterless cooking pans and used the pan to bake the chicken on the stove top (by oven is caput).  They were crispy and brown on the outside and juicy on the inside!  Very yummy!

We made this for guests and it was absolutely incredible.  However, I do use Shake N Bake parmesean to coat the chicken prior to baking.  The sauce in this recipe was amazing.

I've never made chicken cordon bleu but this recipe was easy and soo good! I can't wait to make it again. I followed closely followed the directions, except i browned the chicken on each side in the pan, then put it in the oven for about 20 mins at 350. The only this i might do differently next time, like others have done, is combine the wine sauce with the cream topping.

Looked like the picture but tasted average.  I even made sure I got the right wine that had been recommended by a reviewer, sauvignon blanc.  My thoughts are this brand to brand everything varies tremendously in order to ensure consistent taste you almost have to know what brand was used for the ham, cheese and wine at least.

Wow! Great dish. Not too hard to make and delicious. My boyfriend even bragged to his friends about it. I did the egg batter and finished in the oven. It was perfect!

Very good.  I was a little worried when it said to put the lid and let simmer.  I figured it would get soggy, and ruin it.  But if you just follow the directions to the end, it is very good.  Every time I have done it, though, the chicken is done in about 15 minutes.  (Make sure you pound the chicken. ) So far, this is our favorite Chicken Cordon Bleu recipe.

Was a very good recipe!! Although since I'm not legally old enough to purchase wine I used white grape juice and it was spectacular! My boyfriend and his brother want me to make it again and its only been 2 days!!

This was a wounderful dish.  I made a few changes to the recipe, starting with I baked the chicken at 375* F for 40 min covered.  I also cut the butter to 4 tbls.  Melt the butter in a small pan, add chicken bullion and wine, mix so everything is incorrperated.  Pour over the floured chicken rolls and cover put in oven and bake.  When the chicken is done move to a plate and cover.  Take the dripings in the baking pan and add to the pot heat on low.  Add the premixed cream and cornstartch to the pan with the drippings stirring until thickened about 7min.  Poor sauce over chicken and serve.  We had this with asparagus, rice, and salad a great meal!

Great recipe, I made a few alterations to a make it kid friendly. Substituted bacon for the ham, and cheddar for the swiss and used cornflake crumbs kids loved it. Thanks for sharing.

Well, there's nothing worse than over cooked meat.  I cooked the chicken too long and it was DRY.  I couldn't taste the ham or the cheese and didn't finish the chicken.  However, I made linguine pasta for the sauce and YUMMY.  Not too diet friendly, but so what. LOL  I will try this recipe again, but add more cheese and not cook it so long.

Very very good! I followed the recipe to a T. Make sure you secure the chicken well so the cheese doesn't get a chance to sneak out. This is an easy not-just-for-company recipe. Thanks!

Wow, turned out DELICIOUS! I've never made cordon bleu out of fear that it was too hard of a dish to make, so it was the first time. Super easy dish. I made it for myself. I used half and half because I didn't have heavy whipping cream. I used chicken broth too. I didn't realize I had grabbed turkey instead of ham until I was adding it to the chicken. But it didn't matter. It turned out to be SO YUMMY. I didn't need to use toothpicks either, it didn't fall apart.

Absolutely Fabulous! Made it as written the first time, second time dredged in flour and bread crumbs, browned in a skillet and then transferred to a 350degree oven to finish cooking. Made the sauce in the same pan it was browned in. Turned out fantastic and is added to my house's go-to list

This was very yummy!!! I did make a few simple changes! I brushed the chicken w/ egg, then rolled it in bread crumbs instead of the flour, I cooked the chicken in frying pan as directed.  In a separate sauce pan, (I used chicken stock instead of white wine.) I whisked the Chicken stock, cornstarch, bouillon granules and whipping cream together and simmered for about 10-15 min.! I served the sauce on the side, not knowing if my kids (5 & 3) would like it, but they both loved it!!!

This dish was wonderful!!! I did change the sauce a little bit. I didn't have any dry white wine, so I substituted with chicken broth, I also didn't have any heavy cream, so I used regular 2% milk. I also added some salt/pepper and garlic powder to taste. It tasted great!!!

Sooo good! I had a big hunk of turkey ham here, so I sliced a couple pieces as thin as I could and it worked great! I'm not so partial to swiss and I had fresh mozzarella on hand, so I sliced that thin as well. For just me and my husband, I took one large chicken breast and cut it in half (butterfly style) and then pounded the pieces thin. Before I rolled it all up I put a little salt and pepper inside. I assembled the chicken a few hours in advance and let them set in the fridge after securing them with toothpicks. Instead of flour, I rolled the chicken in egg and then Italian bread crumbs. I then sprinkled a little paprika on top and browned them up with butter and olive oil. When I was ready to make the sauce, I put the chicken in the oven for 10 minutes at 350 and despite making much less chicken, I made almost the full amount of sauce (just a little less heavy cream, and added a bit of chicken broth) and it was perfect! It's kind of freaky gelatinous, but super good. I needed a little flavor boost, so I added a second bouillon cube. I will definitely make this again.

A keeper for sure.  I also went with the oven method and used chicken stock in place of the wine for the sauce which was very good - gotta try with the vino next time.  Just happened to have heavy cream otherwise would have used 5%. Rice and asparagus accompany this perfectly.

Excellent dish! The only chqange I made was in cutting the chicken. My husband cut the chicken and made a little pocket to put the cheese and ham inside it was easier then rolling it. Will be making this dish again, TYTYTY

All I can say is WOW.... You make this for company and they will think your a true chef! I also breaded with breadcrumbs, panfried then baked. I doubled the sauce and left the sauce on the side to drizzle or dip. I also put slices of Swiss on top while in the oven so they are even more cheesy! The BEST recipe I have ever made.

This was a nice change to the normal chicken recipes.  I used thinky sliced deli ham which worked well - not super over powering.  The only changes I made was to sprinkle the chicken with bread crunb and baked it for 30 min. at 350.  Next time I will season the chicken with some salt, and garlic powder as it was slightly bland.  The sauce was very good.  I didn't double as others suggested and we had plenty.

I tried this recipe tonight for my husband and I. We both loved it but I think it was a little greasy (maybe because you cook it in a frying pan with 6 tablespoons of butter. Even after setting the chicken on a double layered papertowel I could only eat half of it because of the grease. Not sure what I could do next time instead as I am still learning to cook.

I have been cooking for my girlfriend, a (now) 5 year old, and myself for about 3 years. I love to cook, and with no prior experience have basically used recipes off of this site, usually making it more than once to tweak it and attempt to make something better. I constantly read reviews to get an idea for the recipes, and I have never written one. I have to write one for this. I may cook for the two most pickiest girls in the world who never want to try anything that they have never had, until this.  They asked for it again the next night and have many more times.  It's easy to make, and absolutely delicious.  I was nervous using Riesling wine because I thought it may be too sweet, but I usually have it on hand... And it was terrific.  Thank you for the recipe.

I did this recipe, and it was amazing! Easy to do and tasty. I did some changes to the recipe because I have different ingredients, I used Gouda Cheese or “Queso Holandés”, Sauvignon Blanc wine, Low Fat Jam, Low fat whipping cream and butter, I also mix the butter with Olive oil. In addition, I made some changes to the cooking process, I passed the chicken rolls thru egg first then thru the paprika and flour, I cooked the chicken until browned in the butter/Oil and passed to the oven for 20 minutes, also, to the cream or dressing I added basil too… Really Good

Fantastic! The cream sauce is out of this world. Better than what we've had in restaurants. After reading other reviews; I did brush the chicken with egg and roll in bread crumbs, with the paprika added. Also doubled the cream. New favorite meal!

This is amazing.  I didn't have white wine and added chicken broth instead and it turned out stellar.  I browned them and baked them in the oven, added the sauce at the end to keep the breading in tact.  Such a beautiful dish!  We loved it so much we at it 2 nights in a row!  Thanks!

Made this for the first time six days ago and my husband has requested it TWICE since.  I used chicken broth instead of wine and half and half instead of heavy cream. Its been a hit in our house.

Excellent recipe.  The only thing that would ruin it is if you burn the butter....if you do, dump it out and try again...don't try to cook the chicken in burnt butter!

Easy and delicious! I butterflied the chicken to make it easier to wrap around the ham & cheese. I think next time I'm going to freeze the swiss and wrap the ham around it so it doesn't melt out as much. I lightened it up a little with a combination of half & half and skim milk (cause I didn't have any heavy cream) and it turned out great. Definitely double the sauce because it would be great on potatoes, rice, or veggies.

This recipe was amazing!!!  This was my very first attempt at chicken cordon bleu and this recipe couldn't have been easier or tasted better!  I followed the recipe to a "T", the only thing i did different was tied the chicken instead of using toothpicks, which worked great and I would reccomend.  I used Boars head Bavarian smoked ham and it was a GREAT choice!  Thank you so much for this recipe, its a keeper!

I really liked this recipe.  I used half butter, half olive oil and then added fresh basil to the sauce at the end.  I made steamed asparagus to go with it.  It very good, although the sauce was a little rich.  It was very filling, too.

This is absolutely delicious! I made this for my husband and he said it was the best Cordon Bleu he ever had. The sauce was fantastic. I added a little extra cheese, just because my husband likes things cheesey! I am definitely going to make this again and again!

Simple easy recipe. Would've liked more flavors added then just swiss/paprika combo.

This has been a favorite in my family. Will definately make this recipe over and over again. The only thing I did different was sliced the chicken breast in half so that it made a pocket to put the ham & cheese. Other then that no changes needed.

Loved it! Thanks for the recipe. I followed it exactly and used Kenwood's Sauvignon Blanc for the wine sauce. The sauce was so very yummy! It wasn't an overpowering winey taste-it was just right! Even my daughter used it for dipping her bread in! We have so much sauce leftover we were trying to figure out how to use it for our next meal! I did actually have one variation to the recipe. I went to get my cornstarch out and I didn't have any, so I used flour instead and it was fine. I have to add I have never made Chicken Cordon Bleu in a skillet before, but after this it is the only way I will be making it from now on! It was very easy and everyone loved it! A Keeper!

The sauce makes this recipe. I did not bread my chicken. cooked it in EVLO for about 3 min on each side then placed the ham onto. Cooked it for about 15 mins at 350 or until juice run clear. Place the cheese ontop and then covered with sauce.

This chicken was fantastic! I made a few slight changes such as replacing the flour with panko bread crumbs and doubling the sauce.  I also seasoned the bread crumbs with italian seasoning, basil, garlic powder, black pepper and crushed red pepper flakes (in addition to the paprika).  My boyfriend asked me to make it every night!  And he's the cook out of the two of us!  I also found (in a pinch) that using uncooked linguine will work to hold the chicken together while cooking. Just break the ends off and they cook with the chicken.  The bf and I didn't even notice they were there!

I LOVED this recipe! I, however, did do a few things differently, not because I didn't like the recipe as it was, but because of my own personal taste and likes. First, instead of beating the meat, I simply cut it in half the long way. I also seasoned my chicken breast lightly with complete seasoning and black pepper before I placed the ham and cheese ontop and folding edges. Also I added the heavy cream along with the wine and boullion and let it simmer like that for 30 minutes, then used that sauce to pour over the chicken. I like the consistency of my sauce once it was finished so I felt no need to add cornstarch. Thanks for a terrific recipe. Hubby, and 6 year old twins loved it!!!

Wow! One of the best dishes I've ever made hands down. Against many other reviewers advice, I used 10% cream for the sauce and cut the butter in half (I just had to cut some of that fat) and it still turned out really rich. I'll makes these changes again next time I make this.

Well we halved the chicken, cheese, and ham, but used the regular amount of sauce, and let me just say, I wish I was still eating it! The chicken was perfectly flavored and surprisingly juicy!

Absolutely delicious!!! I will be making this on a regular basis. The chicken was juicy and perfectly cooked. The sauce was over the top. I might try baking next time to change it up a bit and try to lighten up the sauce where possible so I can enjoy eating it more often.

It can be tough to find a recipe that Everyone in the house likes...but this did it! :) I made a couple changes in my efforts to assure this...after pounding the breasts thin and rolling them with the ham and cheese, I coated them in Panko bread crumbs that I'd seasoned as directed. Browned them on all sides, then put them in a 350 oven for 20 minutes. I made the sauce separate, as directed, except that I added some garlic and Parmesan cheese. The breading of the chicken and keeping the sauce separate was done to keep the kids happy. They did put a little sauce on the side. Served with with rice pilaf and steamed broccoli. Was a big hit and I'll definitely make it again! :)

I am a very novice chef so I should probably give this 5 stars as it has been reviewed by so many people.  I cooked it a little too long and the sauce seemed a little oily..but the taste was GREAT! I will definately keep practicing this one.

I think it needed more cheese and ham in it. I served over pasta and I added spinach and mushrooms into the cream sauce.

This was amazing!  I followed the directions exactly and my husband has officially declared this his all time favorite meal I make.  It was actually surprisingly easy and fun to make.  My only piece of advice is to have your oven on the lowest setting to keep the chicken warm while you're making the sauce.  It took about 20 minutes for the sauce to thicken up.

Amazingly delicious!! Turns out perfectly every time. I skip the toothpicks, brown the chicken in the skillet and then finish it off in the oven. The sauce is a bit bland so I generally add a bit more pepper and some pan drippings.

Great recipe, but next time I will eliminate the chicken bouillon (makes sauce too salty for our taste) and no need to add corn starch to the whipping cream, as whipping cream will thicken quite quickly on its own.

Ditto with all of the other reviewers.  I did saute the chicken, then bake it at 350 for 20 minutes as others suggested and it was great!  Even the non-chicken lovers said they would eat it again.

I'm probably the only one who didn't like this, but I thought the paprika added an odd taste to the whole thing that I didn't enjoy. The sauce did not make the chicken better and this method of cooking caused all the cheese to melt out into the pan, instead of staying in the roll. This is not a recipe I want to try again.

Soooo good!  I put twice the cheese in mine & it came oozing out into the pan which made the sauce extra good.  I'm not a big fan of cordon blue but the sauce made these sooooo so tasty!  Wll make regularly.

I've been looking for a really good Chicken Cordon Bleu recipe for a while now and this is it!  It was so good, and easy to make as well!  My 11 month old daughter ate an entire chicken breast by herself with this recipe, so I know it was a big hit.  Everyone else raved about it as well.

The first time I made this we thought the chicken was better than the sauce. I doubled the sauce and froze it and I wasn't sure when I would use it or what I would use it for. This morning before work, I browned pork chops and put them in the crock pot with some potatoes and onions and poured the thawed sauce over all. (I normally add cream of mushroom soup.) I had about 2 cups of the leftover sauce and then I added about 1/2 to 1 cup of milk and cooked on low for about 9 hours. It turned out AMAZING! The sauce was WAY better the second time around! Now I am so excited to make the sauce again! Definitely double the sauce and try this! Next time it will be made for company!

I love this dish! Inexpensive but looks like you went all out! I followed the recipe to exactly the first time around but the second time I made it I did decrease the amount of butter used since it made the sauce look a little greasy at the end. As for the chicken, I dipped it in several layers of egg and the flour mixture. I omitted the whipping cream since it gave the sauce a funky look and used plain ole whole milk. The cornstarch is what really thickens the sauce anyhow. Also, when I set the chicken aside, I put it in a pyrex dish and poured the sauce over it and then topped with more swiss cheese before popping it in the oven for about ten minutes or until the cheese was nice and bubbly. One of my favorite dishes to make now!

Thanks for the great recipe! I changed a few things: browned the chicken in the pan, then transferred to the oven to finish off for 25minutes while I made the sauce in the same pan that the chicken was browned in (by adding 4tbs butter and 2tbs flour to make a paste, then 2 cups chicken broth and 1/2 cup wine, allowing to reduce and thicken for 20minutes, then adding the cream and seasoning with garlic powder, salt, and pepper) Will make again! :)

reviews are already in on this one-very good. I prepared the breast and coated them in the morning.Then I let them sit in the fridge until supper-this sealed them to keep the cheese from oozing out. Also subbed apple juice for the wine b/c I was out of wine-too much company this time of year, hard to keep wine in the house

Very good and surprisingly easy!   Read comments. One comment I followed was to use 3T butter & 3T olive oil, instead of ALL butter.  Another helpful comment was to use Half & half instead of heavy cream. Both  great suggestions!  It was a big hit with my family:)

So good.  I made this for my family, and they all loved it.  I would definitely make this for company.  I used pre-pounded checken breast and cooked it a little less time.  Also, I used a little less cream and butter.  Even though this is a rich recipe, it is low carb, which is a plus.

This was excellent! It was the first time I've ever made Cordon Bleu and I was very impressed with how it turned out.  The chicken was very tender and moist. The sauce had a wonderful flavor and was a great compliment to the chicken. The only change that I made (as someone suggested) was that I used a mixture of 3 TBSP of Extra Virgin Olive Oil along with 3 TBSP of butter rather than just 6 TBSP of butter to brown the chicken. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly as stated. Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband loved this recipe.  I forgot to coat the chicken with the flour/paprika, but it still turned out great.  I also didn't have any chicken boullion, so I used beef (I'm sure that's a major faux pas).  I added sliced mushrooms to the sauce and used a lot more of the white wine than it called for.  We'll definitely make this again.

This was one of the best recipes that I have ever made!  My only critisicm is that the sauce overpowers the ham and cheese filling.  Next time I make it I will try a more flavorful cheese...possibly goat cheese.  Overall, it was still delicious!

This recipe was great. The sauce was terrific. I made some modifications due to a wine allergy and to use what I had on hand. I used shake-n-bake garlic flavored for the coating on the chicken and I also cooked it as most other people on this page by browning both sides then baking @ 350 for 20 minutes. I made the sauce seperate. I used chicken stock in place of the wine and still used the boullion cube and added fresh parsley. My fiancee said it was his favorite sauce and even put it on his mashed potatoes. It was soooo good. I will be using the recipe often and passing it aong to friends. FYI----- dont use colored tooth picks to secure the chicken. It colored the surounding chicken when I removed them. I thought it would help me find them easier but ended up being just as hard.

Hubby loves this very much and he talked about this all night. It is indeed a very fancy meal and not hard to prepare and cook.   I dipped the chicken in the egg wash and roll them in seasoned breadcrumbs. After that, I browned the chicken in the pan.   Then I put the chicken in the pre heat oven for 20 mins.   I can see my hubby asking me to cook this very soon!

Everyone at dinner loved this chicken.  I made the recipe exactly as stated, with the exception of 2 things. Didn't have whipping cream, so used 2% milk.  Also, I did add probably closer to a cup of white white so that there was more sauce.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!  :)

I made this last night.  My youngest normally does not eat chicken cordon bleu, but said it was awesome and my husband and oldest son had second helpings.    I used capicoli ham and I omitted the chicken granules.  It was perfect and not too salty.

My french boyfriend saw me coating the chicken with flour, and asked me why I wasnt using bread crumbs. He explained to me that here in France, cordon bleu is considered a meal for children, frozen and pre-prepared that they serve for school lunches. I realized I have never seen this dish offered in a restaurant here! but how can that be, because it turned out so good... my boyfriend said his friends would never believe a cordon bleu could be served as a great homecooked meal. I also baked in the oven after browning in butter and olive oil for 20 minutes at 180°celcius, its much cleaner and better appearing that way, and you can be sure it turns out cooked through. The toothpicks held in pretty good after all. I made the sauce separately.

Wow, this was fantastic. The only change I made was that I omitted the bouillon and used chicken broth instead of the white wine. The toothpicks were a little hard to see and quite difficult to get out while the chicken was hot. I think I'll try string instead next time. If you use toothpicks, be sure to count how many are in each piece.

Love this recipe!!!  I brown my chicken in half butter, half olive oil so it doesn't burn.  I took the advice of somebody else and used sauvignon blanc for the wine and that was great also.

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out excellent!! (Actually, I take that back, I cut a pocket in the chicken breast, stuffed it with the ham and swiss and secured with a tootpick.) LOVE LOVE LOVE the sauce!!!

Fantastic! The chicken was moist and the sauce was out of this world. One of the best dinners I have ever made. My only changes were pounding the chicken thinner and using half butter/half olive oil to cook it in. Next time I am going to try using "silicone tressing loops" that are supposed to be a lot easier than securing the chicken with toothpicks.

This a really good recipe.  I took one reviewer's advice by browning the chicken, then baking @ 350º until no longer pink.  I think doing that kept the chicken nice and moist.  Because I baked the chicken, I made the sauce separately.  I melted about a tsp of butter then whisked in the remaining ingredients & simmered.  I bought a package of 4 chicken breasts, so my husband and I each had leftovers for lunch.  The sauce tasted even better the next day!! Delicious!

Absolutely perfect and delicious.  The only thing I changed was cooking the chicken separate from the sauce.  Everyone loved it!

This a fabulous - my family raved! I added 2 asparagus spears to each roll adding nice color and flavor. Served it with au gratin potatoes on a stormy, snowy night!

Made this Saturday, March 14, 2009 and really loved it.  We used a black forest ham which had a very nice flavor to it.  The sauce over top really makes this dish.

Absolutely amazing!  The sauce really finished this off nicely.  I substituted whole milk in place of the cream, but kept everything else the same.  I browned the chicken on the stove top and transferred the skillet to the oven where I baked it for 30 minutes @ 350.  My daughter requested that we make it every night!

Unbelievable!  I did find that it was much easier to put the stuffed chicken in the oven and make the sauce separately!  I have sent this to all my friends.  I make it ever other week!

Both of my extremely picky eaters (husband and 4 yr. old son) loved this recipe!  The only thing I did different was to add some pepper to the sauce.  I will definitely make this again!

This was fantastic.  I changed nothing at all and it was one of the best recipes for Chicken Cordon Bleu I've ever had.  My whole family (both kids included) LOVED it!  Will absolutely make this again.

This recipe was incredible and I don't think it was too rich as some have said.  OMG ---the sauce!  I did as another reviewer said and added saute'd mushrooms (I add them to everything).  I fried the chicken until brown on all sides and then baked for 20 minutes.  Made the sauce separate and spooned over.  It was awesome.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe is awesome. It will now become a regular. I did use mozzerella instead of swiss because our family prefers mozzerella. I also pan fried the chicken breast to brown and then baked it while I cooked the sauce separately.

This dish was awesome. I have made other Cordon Bleu's before that were okay but this is by far the best. I did make a few changes though. I spread dijon mustard on the chicken with the swiss cheese and I used prosciutto instead of regular ham. I also sprinkled parsley and black pepper in with the flour and paprika. I sauteed it on the stove top in olive oil and baked it for the last 20 minutes. When the chicken was done baking, I put the chicken on a plate and made the gravy in the pan on the stove top. Absolutely delicious!

All I can say is wow.. i mean wow.. this was fantastic.. I did make minor changes .. I used provolone cheese instead of swiss.. I also added sliced mushrooms after I sauteed the chicken.. plus i doubled the wine sauce.. because I make rice pilaf.. and I like extra gravy.. it soaks into the rice.. and tastes fantastic..

I have been using this recipe for years. It originally came from a Better Homes & Gardens cookbook. The sauce is super-be sure & use real whipping cream. I always use butter to cook this, not any combo with olive oil, the flavor is much better.

I made this for the first time for a dinner party for 30. It was fantastic!! I prepped all the chicken the day before and used the butcher twine as suggested. On the day of the party, I dipped the chicken in bread crumbs and browned it in a skillet and then placed in a 9x13 to finish in the oven for about 20 minutes. I used what was left in the skillet and added the other stuff for the sauce. I used Root Cabernet Sauvignon wine. It was delicious!! I highly suggest using a meat thermometer because when I cut my first chicken open I was really worried that it was pink but everyone else said it was from the ham. Delicious. I can't wait to make this again!

I have never had Chicken Cordon Bleu before and WOW! I am glad that I finally decided to try it.  I did however change it up a bit because of other reviews. I rolled the chicken up as directed, then rolled in flour, egg and then bread crumbs. I browned them on all sides in butter (in a pan that I could transfer to oven.) Topped with 1 more slice each of ham and Swiss cheese, poured in about 1/8 cup of chicken broth and baked in 375 degree oven for 20 minutes.   While they were finishing in the oven I took 4 tablespoons of butter and 3 tablespoons of flour and cooked the flour for 1 minute. Added 3/4 can of low sodium chicken broth, 1/4 cup of milk, a pinch of nutmeg and made gravy.  I didn’t serve the chicken with the gravy on top, I let everyone do that themselves. The chicken was juicy, tender and done to perfection! Thanks SO MUCH for a great base recipe that I will use for many  years to come!!!

Instead of toothpicks to hold the chicken together use un-cooked spaghetti noodles. you dont have to worry about finding the toothpicks and the cook with the meat

OMG - this is sooooooooo good.  I followed this recipe exactly and it was awesome.  So tasty, and so easy.  I purchased thin chicken filets instead of pounding the chicken - and I'm sure that made it a lot easier - so I encourage people to do that to save time and mess.  Try this - you will love it!  It reheats well too for leftovers.  I searved it with scalloped potatoes the first time, and with alfredo noodles for leftovers.

This recipe is one I might find in a fancy resturant. I didn't have the heavy whipping cream, and it still turned out great. I used thin slices of ham, provolone cheese and milk thicken with flour. It was thick enough, and had less fat. I'm definatly make this again. Thank you for the recipe.

These were awesome!!!  I love CCB and these were great.  The sauce was wonderful; I added fresh mushrooms halfway through cooking the chicken.  I fixed brown rice and used the sauce w/ mushrooms for it. Also - I did pound the chx breasts down to about 1/4-1/2 inch.  I rolled them instead of simply folding in half.  Also I didn't use wine because I was out - so I used chx broth.  I'm making this again tonight and using white wine - I think the sauce will be even better! (If that's even possible)  Make this recipe - you won't regret it.

This was a great recipe! My husband loved it. The 2 things I did change was the ham for turkey bacon (since my husband doesn't eat pork) and I didn't have the boullion granules so I just used Lawry's season salt. It still came out great.

This was fantastic. My only change was I used 3 tablespoons butter and 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil.  I agree with an earlier review that this kept the butter from burning.  I found it difficult to remove the picks after cooking, maybe I'll try to tie them next time. Everything else was perfect.  I will definitely make this again.  Update - I used kitchen string to tie the rolls, and it is definately easier than trying to remove the pick. Just a little snip with the kitchen shears, and the string is easily removed.

AWESOME recipe!  I ended up doubling the sauce (which went really well on rice), and it was excellent.  Rave reviews all around!  This is a keeper, and I will definitely make for company. Thanks!

I liked this recipe quite a bit.  The key is to definitely double the sauce or there won't be enough and without the sauce, it really isn't much.  I wish I would have used a thinner slice of ham as it turned out rather chewy and at first, I thought the chicken wasn't done.  I ended up tying the chicken AND using toothpicks;  dipped in egg and breaded in Panko as others had suggested.  Fried a bit in the skillet until brown and popped into the oven (made the sauce on the stove)  The problem was finding the darned strings under the Panko and when I tried to pull them off, the breading came off with it.  Really a good recipe for something a bit different.  Thanks!

Very tasty!  I followed the recipe except for two slight changes - I used prosciutto instead of ham, and I used a little bit of chicken broth instead of the granules.  Tasted great, and the sauce is really amazing.

I didn't change a thing on this recipe, it is outstanding!  I only made this recipe because my husband loves Cordon Bleu, I on the other hand have never had a good one, until now!

I prepared this pretty much as the recipe said, but added some seasoned bread crumbs, about a tablespoon to the flour and paprika. I dredged the rolled chicken breasts in egg and then in the flour mixture.  I cooked it for the 30 minutes, perfect timing!  I then prepared the sauce as you said but just before pouring it over the chicken I added a tablespoon or so of prepared Pesto!!  Delicious!!  Oh yes, one more thing, as I took the meat out of the pan onto a warming dish, I scooped up the melted swiss cheese and drizzled it over each breast....waste not, want not!!!

I shredded the ham in food processor, used provolone. Dipped in egg wash, then floured and fried in equal parts olive oil and butter. Placed chicken in baking dish, made sauce in pan fr. half&half, 2 chicken bouillon and wht. wine, poured over chicken and finished baking for 15 minutes & garnished w/fresh basil. Thank-you!!

If you haven't figured it out by now this is a recipe that is terrific and you must give it a try!  I made it at Christmas and this past week I received a call from my daughter who is coming home for college for the weekend and has specifically asked for this recipe!  When I went to pull the recipe to see what I needed at the grocery store, I couldn't find my printout.  YIKES -  Fortunately most of the "good" recipes I have found have come from the website allreceipes.com (I must get better organized). Thankfully I found it again quite easily and I won't be disappointing my daughter who is ready for a home cooked meal!  Thank you for sharing this fantasic recipe!

This was very good and not too hard to prepare.  Made it first time and everyone liked.  2nd time I put 2x more ham and swiss on inside and got twice the complaments.  I used chicken broth instead of wine sence I didn't have any and was still good.  Sause was exellant.  This is a new favorite for sure

This was soooo gooooooood. My fiance and I thought it had a lobster like taste to it! Prepared it the night before with the flour and paprika and put them in saran wrap (no toothpicks) and the shape held perfectly when I when to brown them. Can't wait to make again!!

This is my husbands favorite dish & he loved this version the best of all.  It was easy to make in comparison to other recipes for the same thing & I didn't change a thing.  Even my picky kids ate it up like it was candy! The leftovers were gone by the next morning and no one has confessed to being the midnight muncher.

All I can say is "YUMMY!!!!!!"  I haven't had a meal this good in a long time - It's a little time consuming - but well worth it in the end....the only thing I did differently was adding a little more flour and paprika than the recipe had called for and I used "light" cream instead of "heavy" - I don't know how many calories I saved -but it was sooooooo good!!!!!!!!!!!This is a keeper -Husband who doesn't like cream sauces, loved it -  I will make it again - I highly recommend this recipe!!

This was fantastic! I followed the recipe exactly and it was easy and delicious. I am surprised at how easy it was to make. I made this for my mom, my husband and some friends and they all loved it. My mom even asked for the recipe, so I know it was a hit. I'll be making this again soon per my husband's request. :-)

My whole family loved this, even my son that doesn't like chicken dishes. I used half & half the whole 16 ounces when making the sauce and it was perfect, also used olive oil in lieu of butter, seasoned bread crumbs for rolling instead of flour. This was really easy and I will make it again. Oh the wine I used was Fetzer's Gewurztraminer. The sauce went well with asparagus and rice.

Woo hoo! Works for me! All I did differently was add about 1/4 c. Gorgonzola cheese to make it a Gorgonzola cream sauce - my husband wouldn't stop "oohing" and "aahing" while he was eating it. Great recipe - will make again!

Excellent! Delicious!! Definitely a must to double the sauce (but instead of using more wine...use 1/2 cup wine and 1/2 cup chicken broth). My husband, mother-in-law, mother and even the kids (4 and 7 years old) just loved it! Nothing but great compliments all around during dinner. Had mash potatoes and steamed vegetables with it. The gravy was perfect on top of everything! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Delicious!  Very easy to make.  I prepped the meat earlier in the day and just before we sat for the first course I dredged it in egg, then the flour, browned it in butter and added the liquid.  It was perfectly cooked by the time we got to the main course.  I made the sauce separately and served with asparagus (both of which I prepared in less than 3 mintues in-between courses).  It got rave reviews and I will definitely make again!

I have been making this recipe for years and my family loves it!!!  My only problem is that about 2 minutes after I add the cream and cornstarch, my sauce separates into this greasy, clumpy mess - not the beautiful sauce it was.  I have 4 kids (lots of disruptions) so I can never time it so the sauce goes straight on the chicken.  Does this happen to anyone else?

This meal came out great.  The wife and kids liked it a lot.  I was a bit worried about the sauce but it had a lot of flavor.  The family says this is one I can count on making again.  Thanks

This is excellent!  My whole family loved it and that includes a 2 year old and a 7 year old which can be hard to impress!!  The gravy is awesome, my son kept saying it tasted like it had cheese in it although it doesn't.  Thanks so much!!

The first time I made this, it turned out way too salty... maybe the bouillon, but I used as much as it said to. But the sauce was sooooo good, so it was alright. Next time I used more paprika and chives. Was really good, everyone liked it a lot. Highly recommend chardonnay like the recipe says for the sauce!

I've made a few chicken cordon bleu recipes before, but this is my first try with a sauce.  I used a filet to butterfly my chicken breasts.  After reading reviews, I folded my swiss slices into quarters before completely encasing them in ham slices - slightly labor intensive, but not time consuming.  My hope was not to have "cheese leakage," and it worked pretty well.  I only lost a few blobs of cheese during the cooking process.  Instead of flour and paprika, I used Wondra, which I prefer the texture of.  I didn't have dry white wine on hand, but I used white cooking wine, which seemed to work okay.  I also used lite cream instead of heavy, and perhaps that is the reason I needed to add an extra tablespoon of cornstarch for it to be thickened to my liking.  My father and I loved it - my mom just thought it was "okay."  She said it was "too *something*" (I think she meant salty) but could not put her finger on it.  I will make this again (when mom isn't home :)

Delicious but a couple of points. The sauce came out too thin and the cheese when melted, dissolved in the sauce. The appearance of the dish wasn't as appealing. Also the chicken came out a bit dry and needed lots of sauce.

WOW ~ this was SOOOOO amazing!  Simmering it in white wine really brought it to another level.  I'm on a low carb diet, so I crusted the chicken in a mixture of mostly almonds and pistachio's - it was devine.  My brother was speechless while he ate.  My husband gave me the biggest hug after dinner.  If that's not a winner, I don't know what is.  Thanks again...

This was excellent! Based on other reviews I also added garlic to the wine and boullion mix and basil to the cream sauce. I also used bread crumbs instead of flour and added some parmesan cheese to the crumb mixture before coating the chicken. It was delicious! We will definitely make this one again.

I didn't have heavy whipping cream, so threw in a can of cream of mushroom soup instead (and skipped the cornstarch).  It still came out delicious!!  Will definitely make this again.

I expected this dish to be really fantastic with all the 5 star reviews. My husband and I thought it was good but I won't be making it again. I will keep looking for the ultimate Chicken Cordon Bleu Recipe.

When I made the meal I totally forgot the sauce - what was I thinking?  Anyway, the chicken was great without it but the next day we had the leftovers and I made the sauce by itself and poured it over the chicken - wow it was good.  Next time I won't forget the sauce when cooking the chicken, I'm sure it will be more flavorful.

Super duper yummy!  I opted to use chicken broth instead of the wine.  I also used 1.5 tbsp bread crumbs and 1.5 tbsp flour with a dash of season salt for the coating (did not have paprika on hand).  Other than that followed the recipe to a "T".  My entire family loved it!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Love this recipe.  I always pound the chicken breasts as much as I can.  It can be hard sometimes to wrap it up.  Always at hit at dinner parties.

The chicken was outstanding, but as one other reviewer did - I cooked the chicken in a skillet for 10 minutes to brown on each side.  Once browned, I put in the oven for 20 minutes.  EXCELLENT!  The chicken was very tender and juicy.  I made the sauce in a seperate pan to go with it, but didn't even use it.  Not my thing.  It didn't taste good to me at all.

The recipe itself was great.  Very tasty.  I knocked off a star due to presentation - it did not look appealing.  Of course, that may be my fault but I've tried this recipe twice now and it still comes out in the same unappealing manner.  But I will still make this again since it was great tasting.  Maybe next time I'll just try slicing the chicken breast open and stuffing the cheese and ham inside instead of folding it in half?  All in all, good recipe, thanks.

This was really, really good.  My DH said it had a very unexpected,unique flavor.  He loved it.  My only complaint was trying to roll or fold the ham and cheese inside the chicken.  It was difficult for me but well worth the trouble.  I'll make this again because it was so good.

Made this last night... the best!  I never had chicken cordon bleu before so I didn't know what it was suppose to taste like; however, I've seen the stuff in the frozen food section.  
This does not have the thick starchy coating so it's perfect for the low carb/Atkins folks.  I didn't have ham so I used canadian bacon - fantastic! I used the Atkins baking mix instead of flour (higher fiber I guess).  Even with all the alterations - it was perfect!

I made this chicken cordon bleu for my family for Valentine this year and it was a great hit!  All of our five kids and my husband loved it.  I personally like my chicken to be crispy so I cooked it in the 350 degree oven for about 35 minutes after browning both side on frying pan.  I did cut down on butter by half.  As other reviews said, I thought the sauce was a little salty, too.  So I added a little extra milk and cream at the end.  You will end up with a lot of sauce, but you can use it over pasta or something.  I will make this recipe again!

The first time I made this I missed the part about adding the cream and cornstartch mixture into the pan(filled with what the chicken was cooked in) 

I added it right to the chicken and it didn't taste right I went back and realized my mistake. The second time I made this it was soooo tasty. My picky son told me he would give it "a million stars" I am adding this to my permanant collection.

I normally change every recipe to make it healthier, but I left this one alone and made it exactly like it said. 
It was absolutely delcious!!! And the extra sauce would be great on mashed potatos. I say definetly use the wine!

I'm giving this four stars because the recipe turned out really well.  I browned the chicken bundles in an electric skillet and then put them in a 9x13 to bake for about 25 minutes.  I made the sauce w/ the drippings in the skillet and it turned out really well instead of simmering the chicken.  But I have to whine a little about having to handle and pound the chicken to get it thin enough to wrap the cheese and ham. Ewww slime-y!  The weekend after I made these I noticed that there were pre-packaged chicken breasts already sliced super thin right in the local grocery--that might be just perfect for this recipe...maybe next time.

My husband LOVED this dish. I mean, he regularly likes what I cook, but with this dish, he really pulled out all stops to tell me how good it tasted! He also brought some to work the following day and had the same experience. :) Thank you very much :)

This is amazing!  The best chicken I have ever cooked, hands down!  We used bacon instead of ham, since that is what we had on hand.  There were no leftovers! Thank you!

This was very good!!! I only gave it 4 stars b/c the "breading" part was all mushy...probably something I did wrong...and my chicken was a little tough...probably also me, but still...it was yummy, yummy...and the sauce was amazing!!!

Great Recipe.  My roommates and I really enjoyed it.  Note: if chicken breasts are too thick, butterflying them works very well.

This recapie was a HIT. my husband loves Chicken Cordon Bleu. It's all he orders from Arbys, So I decided to make it for last sunday's dinner. Everyone loved it. I over cooked it just a tad for my taste but everyone else was so pleased. I had compliments all night long. I did use the standard recapie but I eye-balled it because I used double the chicken breasts. so I try'd to double it without doing that math. it's better when you eyeball it becuase you get a diferant tase or thicker scause. depends on how it's cooked. Oh what a great recipe!

This was SOOOO good!  I eliminated the flour & cornstarch to make it low-carb, used proscuitto instead of ham, and added more wine than called for (pinot grigio).  This was a HUGE hit at my dinner party with the girls.  When the chicken breasts were fully cooked, I removed them from the pan, added some "Thicken/Thin Not Starch" stuff to thicken before adding half and half.  I will definitely be making this one again and again.

I made this recipe for my mother-in-law's birthday (the pressurew was on!), and it was a HUGE HIT!!! The only thing I changed was I left out the flour as my mother-in-law has gluten allergies.  But it honestly doesn't need the flour anyway.  And the sauce was to die for! Just the perfect flavor. Anyway, this recipe will definitely be a family favourite from now on!

I had only had the breaded kind but I find this much better! The sauce was great and the chicken was super tender. I didn't use paprika but I added a fresh rosemary sprig to the sauce. Rosemary seemed more traditional French than paprika to me...

Just made this for dinner and couldn't wait until I could get up here and give my opinion.  FABULOUS...Restaurant quality.  I added portabella mushrooms in the sauce as I had some that needed to be used but everything else the same..Thanks.

I just tried this recipe this afternoon and wow I can't believe that I cooked an amazing dish, though i added a little bit of garlic powder, pepper and accent to chicken breast and it turned out so good! so yeah, I would definitely give this a 5 star or  10 star if I could only do that:)
This recipe is so sooo  good that even my 2 yr old daughter said yummy  after a bite and my hubby loves it so much! I would definitely do this again.

This is one of my new favorite recipes!  This was so good I'd rate it 6 stars if I could.  Although, I didn't have paprika, so I just used Lawry's Seasoned salt and that worked fine.  Also, I found out that I ran out of toothpicks, so I had to snap the heads off wooden matches and use those! :-)

Definitely a keeper! I cut the butter amount in half and used half & half instead of cream to reduce the calories and used more paprika because I love the color. I'm not adept at securing chicken with toothpicks so I pounded the breasts flat, put the ham and cheese on one side then folded the chicken over the top and secured with just 1 toothpick. I doubled the wine and cream to make extra sauce because we served this over rice. Boyfriend and I both loved this dish and made for great leftovers.

This was pretty good! But I did have to make a few changes, since I am living with one of the pickest men alive. change 1..I used provolone cheeese instead of swiss. change 2..we don't drink so I used chick broth insted of wine. change 3..to caot the chicken breats I used half bread crumbs, half flour paprika, garlic powder and pepper. All in all they turned out really good, but they were definitely missing one thing: SALT!!! But I am still giving these a 5 star since I know that if I just add salt the next time they will be deliciuos!!!

This was delicious!  I made just a few changes, I ended up using a whole cup of wine, and I added 1 tsp of garlic powder.  I didn't have swiss cheese, so I used fresh mozzarella and it still came out wonderful!  Will make again.

This is a definite 5 star recipe!!! It was so quick and easy to make and extremely flavorful!!  I used provolone cheese since I didn't have swiss on hand and only cooked the chicken for 20 minutes.  It was delicious!!

My husband and I enjoyed this recipe immensely.  It's very easy to make and tastes better than those at a restaurant.
I scaled the recipe for two people and then doubled the sauce.  At the same time you add the white wine I added a teaspoon of minced garlic.  Next time I'll add a little less as it seemed a little too garlicy.  I did not have heavy whipping cream so I used half and half instead.  Was just as good!  Next time I won't make it with so much butter either, just to try and get it a little less fattening.  All in all, a great recipe!

I tried it recently and it was very nice.  But I would use chicken thigh instead of chicken breasts next time, for a more tender texture.

Made for supper last night.  It was good but did not "wow" us.  Thanks

10/9/2006 - I ended up having to change my review because we enjoyed much better as leftovers.  Thanks

This was delicious but it was difficult to stop the cheese from flowing out.  Next time I think I'll put it over the chicken when it's warm right before serving and pouring over the sauce.  Flavor was great though

Loved it! Much easier to prepare than it looks...the hardest part is getting the edges of breasts toothpicked together..I recommend pinning along the edge sideways like a running stitch (use round toothpicks, which have a smoother surface)this will keep the toothpicks from getting in the way too much when you are browning them . Great dish!

Fablous company fare.  I pounded the chicken breats to an even 1/2" to make them easier to stuff and reduce the cooking time down to 20 minutes.  I used a Black Forest no-water added ham.  After breading the chicken, I let it rest in the fridge for 1 hour.  This really helps the coating stick on.  I served the sauce on the side for those watching their fat intake and even without the sauce everyone thought it was fantastic.

this was great, made it for the first time for company, and they have requested the recipe-instead of simmering in frying pan, I put the chicken in a covered dish @325 for 45 min. I can't wait to make again!

This was an excellent dish and I was surprised at how easy it was to make.  I am definitely not an experienced chef in any sense of the term but thought I would try to make it for my boyfriend on Valentine's Day.  I prepared much of it before hand and doubled the sauce recipe as suggested (slathered it on asparagus - yummy!).  I loved it.  Can't wait to make it again.

I'm a college student and it's the end of the term, and I'm trying to use up the stuff I have in the fridge. I made tons of small changes and it was still very good. I substituted chicken breast with leg, swiss cheese with pulled-apart ficello cheddar cheese, ham with small turkey+chicken+ham slices, flour with cornstarch, paprika with bbq chicken seasoning, wine with mirin (sweetened wine) and cream with low-calorie soy milk. These changes didn't affect the taste much, except for the soy milk. It had a weird nutty flavour, so if you have to substitute the cream, go with milk, NOT soy milk.

I made this recipe tonight for my family and they couldn't get enough!!!
I modified the recipe by omitting the white wine and whipping cream, but substituting homemade chicken stock and adding 1/2 and 1/2.  After browning, I followed the advice and put it in the oven for 20 mins. at 350 degrees.  The chicken was so tender, it just melted in your mouth.  I will definitely make this dish again...

The sauce was excellent.  I sprinkled paprika on the chicken and then coated it with flour and fried it in oil in a cast iron skillet until nicely browned on both sides.  I then transfered them into a pan with 1/2 the recommended butter and proceded with the recipe.  Strictly a personal preference but I think frying it in the oil allowed a crisper crust.

Made this for a party of 15 and it was an absolute hit.  We will make this over and over again.  The sauce is spectacular, although not for anyone on a diet.  This is just simply the best recipe out there!  You will not be sorry.  One small tip...let the sauce simmer for a few minutes, it gets better with time. Oh, and make sure you have lots of french bread for your guests because after they devour the chicken, the sauce is next!

This was easy and delicious.  I ended up putting in a covered casserole dish after browning and baking in the oven @350 for 1/2 hour.  Pounding the  really makes for a tender meat.  Leftovers were gobbled up by my kids the next day.

This is the first time I've tried to make chicken cordon bleu and it turned out perfect. My wife was really impressed when she came home from work. I didn't have white wine, so I used cooking sherry and WOW... what a treat! The chicken and the gravy came out perfect. Next time I might try the white wine to see if it's as good as the sherry.

The blend of flavors in this recipe is amazing. I got nothing but "Mmmmmm"s at the table. Like many reviewers, I browned the chicken rolls in the pan and then baked them in the oven while I made the sauce. I also used breadcrumbs instead of flour and added a pinch of cayenne pepper to the sauce (I like pepper on just about everything, though). Fantastic!

I have tried one other recipe for chicken cordon bleu and it was aweful. So I never bothered to make it again but my husband loves this dish so I got online to allrecipes.com and found this one. It was out of this world!!! It was such an awesome dish that I plan on making it for my company next time they are over for dinner. Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe.

The best cordon bleu i have ever made!  I bought thin-sliced breast filets, so they were very easy to handle and roll.  My husband absolutely loved it, my 3 year old even ate it..and he currently doesn't eat anything but toast and yogurt!!  I will make this again and again...thanks Behr!!

My husband loved this, loved the sauce. I thought it was a bit salty, and when you cook it try not to burn the wine. and try using cooking rope istead of toothpicks it might be easier

This recipe was great: easy to prepare, tasty and it was very pretty. We opted not to use the cream sauce though. The chicken was so tender and yummy it didn't need it. I served it for our Mother's Day brunch and it was a big hit.

This is a great recipe; I can't wait to make it for company. I didn't have the wine,
so I used chicken broth, which worked really well. I also used half & half instead
of the cream for the sauce and it was delicious.

Tried it twice, first time with wine as recipe calls for, and second time with chicken broth substituted for the wine and the second version was better by far.

I made this recipe for guests...I am a vegetarian so I have very little experience making meat...this was very easy.  The only recommendation I would make is that the sauce needs a little "doctoring".  It is slightly bland.  It needs some seasonings...like Italian Seasonings or Rosemary or Garlic and Red Pepper or maybe mushrooms.  The sauce just needed jazzing up a bit.  Overall it was very good.

I've never made Chicken Cordon Bleu before so this was a first attempt.  It turned out much better than I thought it would.  The only recommendation I would make would be to add a slice of swiss cheese to the top of it after taking it out of the skillet.  To keep it warm and melt the cheese just a bit while preparing the cream, place it in a warm oven until the cream is done.

Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.  I've made it several times now substituting
turkey cutlets for the chicken.  The sauce is to die for.

This has got to be the very best Chicken Cordon Bleu recipe I've ever had. The sauce is an excellent compliment to the chicken. I'll never look at another Chicken Cordon Bleu recipe the same way again. This is a real keeper.

This was a great wonderful dish. I added a little extra wine to the sauce because it seemed a little thick and it was great! My husband said he wouldn't change a thing!

This is THE BEST chicken cordon bleu recipe! The sauce really makes the dish! It was just as excellent for leftovers and heated up well in the microwave. The only change I made was to season the chicken breasts with salt, pepper and garlic powder before adding the cheese and ham. My inlaws and husband just loved this dish. I may try to "lighten up" the next version by using half and half instead of heavy cream next time.

Absolutely an amazing recipe! Even my boys loved it and said over and over how good it was!!! 
Only changes i made was after browning the chicken I placed them in a 350 oven and cooked them for 15-20 minutes then added them to the sauce and simmered for 10 mins.
I doubled the sauce recipe except the butter and added fresh basil!! Basil added a nice touch

Had to modify the recipe as my husband and daughter don't like swiss cheese, so I used Colby jack and we all loved it.  I want to try it with mozzarella cheese next.  We also love onion and mushroom so I added them to the sauce--wonderful

I made this not varying from the recipe at all. I usually do that first and make changes after trying contributors version.  It was absolutely mouth watering!May split butter with olive oil next time but really found nothing I would want to change unless I was out of wine and used broth as I read in others reviews. I live in a rural area and if doing a meal kind of spur of the moment running to the grocery is not always convenient.

I made this recipe; I followed it to a "T" and it turned out amazing! We loved it and I will definitely make this again. I did omit the butter for olive oil, and I used light whipping cream... So may be not to a "T" but almost!

The sauce is amazing! In fact I'm still eating dinner. Thought it's so good decided to comment immediately! Prefer to try recipe 1st time in its original recipe.   I wish comments weren't available sometimes.  Everyone changes it and it can confuse me or doubt things. The only thing I did take from someone else's thoughts was to double the sauce.  Glad I did it does make the dish!  It's a keeper and hope to use it for special occasions.

A lot of work, but worth it. Absolutely one of the best chicken dishes I have made. The sauce was delicious beyond words. I recommend using high quality cold cuts. I used Boars Head Black Forrest ham. For the coating I did the flour, egg, and bread crumbs that other people recommended. One thing I would do differently the next time: I would not pound the chicken breasts so much. It made them too thin to hold the toothpicks.

This was a crowd pleaser!  I tripled the recipe, as we had 11 folks to feed, ranging in age from 6-69.  Several requests were made for the recipe and I sent the link on earlier today.

I followed the recipe and the suggestion of others to bake the chicken rather than cook it in the wine/boullion sauce.  I also used string rather than toothpicks to hold the chicken rolls together.  Created two versions, as we had one member of the group with gluten issues.  Used breadcrumbs on one set and gluten free flour & paprika on the others.  

I will definitely make this again and will try to freeze some too!  For a quick weeknight meal.

It tasted just ok considering i don't care much for swiss cheese. But it's different strokes for different folks. My Husband said it was the best dish i have ever made. My Teen age Son was out with friends so i left him a plate in the fridge when I went to visit some family. I got a text message from him saying ( his exact words) the chicken was AMAZING, Thank You. There was a bone in it though but that's ok lol. ( the bone was a tooth pick he didn't remove ) I usually get a ok, good or really good if I ASK him about something I have made. Never have I heard amazing from him over food. A little time consuming to make, but considering how much my husband and son loved it, i will be making it for them again soon.

Great recipe I am not a cook and made this for my wife's birthday and it was great. I did put it in the oven at 350 for 40 min instead of simmering but the chicken I used was very thick even after thinning. I would make this again very tasty and loved the cream sauce. I served over egg noodles.

So, after telling me how everything I was doing was wrong, my darling husband couldn't rave about this dish enough! Followed as written and according to family couldn't be any better. Hubby said the best dish I've made since we've met. Made the chicken, garlic mashed potatoes, and brussel sprouts. He started with the chicken and couldn't say enough good about it . Kudos to the one who posted the recipe, and a huge thanks from a so-so cook.

New favorite recipe. My daughter was coming home from college for the weekend after not being home for almost 3 months so wanted to make one of her favorites Chicken Cordon Bleu found this recipe on this site and thought it seemed simple and high reviews and everyone was RIGHT! My family loved it.  I followed it exactly as instructed, the only thing I would do different is make more because my 15 year old so and husband wanted two pieces:) This is a keeper for sure!

This was my first time making this and it was Awesome.. Delicious.. I did make some adjustments. I used sandwich sliced ham ( black forest ham),  I used chicken broth instead of wine and I baked the chicken after browning it for about 10 minutes and adding the chicken broth. I added 2tsp of the broth to the cornstarch and cream dressing.  My family couldn't stop talking about it. Ate it with plain cooked rice and sauteed garlic asparagus. Yum yum

When my boyfriend requested I make chicken cordon bleu for him, I very reluctantly agreed as I've never cared for the dish.  Oh boy am I glad I gave it a shot!  I've now made this dish over a dozen times now and IT.IS.AMAZING!  

As others have said, you'll want to double the sauce.  I use chardonnay for the wine and chicken broth in place of the bouillon granules as I think bouillon makes it a bit too salty.  I increased the Swiss to 1.5 slices and blue cheese to the center.  Try it, you won't regret it!

It was good. The White wine sauce was the best part. I added some salt, pepper, and garlic powder to the flour to season the chicken a little more.

My daughter raved about the sauce that came with this dish.  We made it exactly as stated in the recipe.  The only difference is I used thin-cut chicken breasts so I wouldn't have to pound out whole ones as much.  My husband loved it even though he doesn't eat any kind of sauce but spaghetti.  So if you'd like, he says its great even without the sauce!  Will definitely make this again!!

Tried this recipe several weeks back for our small group dinner, what a hit, the crowd just fell in love with the taste,  I should mention the sauce is so good I would double the amounts as my guest were using their spoons to get every last drop of the cream,  Have made this 3 times since..

This was a great recipe and gave the basics of this dish very clearly. However, I had the same trouble others had with the sauce being very runny. After spending 10 minutes continually stirring with the sauce not thickening, and then running to read others' reviews to see if anyone else had the same problem, I had to add about double the cornstarch and cream. But, all in all, it was delicious!

I only made 2 chicken breasts worth and the full amount of sauce since it's just me and my husband and I love saucy stuff.  I'm glad there was extra sauce-YUM!  I don't know much about "dry white wine" so thankfully I saw in another review that said to use Sauvignon Blanc which tasted really good.  1/2 cup is barely any out of the bottle so I would suggest looking for those little individual bottles if you don't plan of drinking the rest.  I added 1 tbsp of bread crumbs and a little garlic powder to the coating and ended up using most of the coating on just the 2 so I don't think it would cover 6 very easily.  overall VERY good and I plan on making again.

Excellent.... The sauce was amazing. I had the deli slice my Ham and Swiss a bit thicker for this and I used Hot Hungarian Paprika.  Have you tried this? I'm also a big fan of Smoked Paprika when it comes to my BBQ sauce. This one is going into the rotation.

I just finished cooking this recipe and OMG it is so good! I had to replace dry white wine with chicken broth since its the only thing i have in my kitchen. The marriage between the meat and the sauce was excellent! I will definitely make this again. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I definitely had to do 5 stars for this one. Sauce was amazing and the flavor of the chicken was amazing. One thing i did change myself was the amount of ham and cheese inside the chicken.  Instead of 1 slice i used 3 slices of each.  I don't even need to look up any other recipe for chicken cordon bleu in the future because this one is going to be a staple!

The crust of the chicken did not have much flavor and after turning my heat to low and letting the chicken simmer, my butter burned. I had to scrape my skillet and add MORE butter. I took the advice of another reviewer and added a little olive oil, which helped, but then made my sauce oily/greasy. Don't think I'll make this again.

This is the best sauce! If you think that its good with the chicken try this. Take raw shrimp sauté with garlic and onion, then remove shrimp. (so not to over cook) follow the rest as is. Then at the end put shrimp back in with shredded Swiss cheese to thicken sauce. serve over noodles. It well have a seafood spin.

My husband lives this, but I don't like it as much. It's still good, don't get me wrong. It's just not my thing. I make it close to what the directions say; the only change I make is cutting the chicken open and putting two slices Swiss cheese and one slice ham inside the chicken instead of on top. Also, because we're celiacs, we use gf all-purpose flour. Still tastes amazing.

Made this last night and I have to say the sauce was "to die for."  I almost left the chicken in the wine broth, but since I had whipping cream on hand I went for it.  It was fabulous.  It made a lot of creamy sauce, so I have enough left over for some mushroom ravioli that I bought!  Looking forward to enjoying this sauce again!  This recipe is a keeper.

Best Chicken Cordon Bleu ever!  This is what I would consider a little more of an advanced dish.  But, if you follow the directions--including the note to pound the chicken into thin pieces (about 1/2 inch thick)--you can't go wrong.  This is a special occasion-worthy meal.  Overall, with the chicken pounding, it took me about 2 hours to get the whole meal done.  I will be making it again, this time for guests!

I made this recipe as written. I used about 3 tbsp butter and a little olive oil when I noticed the butter was starting to brown. This was soooo good. Next time, I might wrap the cheese in the ham and freeze for a half hour before I roll it into the chicken. I didn't really get a sense of the cheese because it melted too much. My husband was totally impressed. I used 2 chicken breasts which I sliced in half and then pounded to about 1/2 inch thick. I used thin sliced Black Forest Ham and some sort of baby swiss because I was afraid husband wouldn't care for Swiss. Next time I will just use Swiss. I have a feeling I will be making this often. Served with simple mashed potato and roasted string beans.

This was really good. I did as another reviewer suggested and used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil to sautee' the chicken. I also pounded the chicken to flatten. I used the recommended amount of flour and also added panko bread crumbs for the texture. Delish!! My family loved it!

I made miniatures using chicken tenders and slices of Canadian Bacon instead of deli ham. Wow...what a treat! Next time I might make the sauce, but it was tasty enough without it! And EASY!!!

No complaints! This recipe is the BOMB.com I used thin chicken breast because it's what we buy (way easier to pound out and roll) This will be the next meal I cook when I have company over gah so yummy!

This was very good.  Followed the recipe except for the sauce part.  I love Hollandaise sauce so I made one for this. Family loved it.

Will definitely make again and try the wine sauce.  This is good enough for company!

This was delicious! I put Dijon mustard on the inside of chicken breast then again on the top of the ham. I didn't have the wine so I used champagne. I also sautéed mushrooms and added it to the chicken along with a 1 TBLS of rinsed capers. The sauce was delicious and I served it with Israel couscous. Yum

Amazing flavor.   I used chicken broth instead of wine and panko breadcrumbs instead of flour.   Browned all sides in butter and then baked @350 for 25 mins.   The white sauce was awesome.

Just a tip for everyone who want to save time with butterflying & pounding the chicken breast..

Make sure you are using large enough breats, 7 or 8 oz each.  Put the chicken in the freezer for about 20 - 25 minutes, so they firm up.  Cut a pretty deep slit in the fatter side of the breast - do not go from end to end, leave about 1/2" on each end uncut.

To prevent the cheese from melting out, roll the cheese inside the ham slices and stuff this into the slit in the breast.  You may want to insert 2 of these rolls into each breast.

Hope this helps & happy cooking!

This was great! My husband is a diabetic, and we are all supporting his new low carb diet. I am constantly on the look out for recipes to please everyone. This was great. I used two large breasts, cut in half lengthwise to give four portions (two adults and three kids under 10). I pounded them as thin as possible, which wasnt that much. I put 2.5T flour and 1t seasoning salt in a ziplock. I put the breasts in that to coat them lightly. I seared one side in equal parts butter and EVOO. Then I placed 1t cream cheese down the middle of the breast, chopped up ham pieces, and 1T shredded cheddar. I didnt have any toothpicks so I placed them in the small pan seam side down. I sautéed some sliced portabella mushrooms, added 0.5c chicken stock, and 1/3c heavy cream. I added some S&P, garlic powder, and 1t dijon mustard. Cooked it for about a minute before pouring that over the chicken. I covered w foil and baked at 350F for 20 min. I let it rest for 10 mins. It was divine. Thanks, definitely a keeper!

The sauce is just divine and the chicken is so tender.  I would definitely go with a flavorful/salty ham-nice thick cut.  I was very clumsy with the toothpicks and had difficulty removing them so I just gave up--as I was only cooking for my little family.  The breading was a little strange--didn't really crisp up--also, when I read the recipe I couldn't believe that 3 TBS of flour and 1 TBS paprika could cover all six chicken rolls so I just made a larger batch of the mixture.  Great job Behr!

Made it just for my wife and I.  Didn't have toothpicks, so it didn't look the greatest, but it was really delicious.  I substituted half milk/half sour cream for the heavy cream and used a little chicken broth instead of the bullion.  I will definitely do this again with better equipment so it looks as good as it tastes.

Used this as inspiration with a few changes: dredged in the paprika seasoned flour, then egg wash, lastly seasoned breadcrumbs before browning. Added a minced shallot to the skillet, deglazed with wine, added cream and reduced to a rich sauce, no need for cornstarch. Finished the rolls in a 350 oven. Delicious and brought back wonderful food memories. Served with rice and baby spinach leaves lightly dressed. Thanks for this!

This is Heaven on a plate. I've made it a few a times now. The first time I followed the recipe to a T and it was wonderful but since then I've tweaked it to my personal preferences. The best advice I can give is to double up on the sauce, it's incredible! I've used wine and chicken broth and it's great both ways but the wine is definitely my favorite. I like to prepare the sauce separate from the chicken and finish the chicken off in the oven but yet again it's great both ways. I also use an egg wash on the chicken before rolling the chicken in flour which I add a bit of garlic and onion powder to as well as the paprika. I've tried bread crumbs but prefer it with the flour. Lastly, a bit of Dijon mustard on the chicken before adding the ham and cheese is really good! This is a great recipe and fun to make your own and it's a huge crowd pleaser!

This recipe is always popular with my family and friends.  I replace the ham with prosciutto, and I often replace the swiss with Gouda.  Everyone always says it's the best chicken cordon bleu they've ever had.  It's very easy to do as well.

As another review suggested I sautéed the chicken to brown it and baked at 350 for 20 minutes.  I made the sauce in the same pan while the chicken was baking.  I substituted olive oil for butter to cut down on the fat.  My husband is watching his calorie intake and at chicken without the sauce and found it was delicious.  The sauce is just a caloric overkill; a very delicious overkill.
Very easy and I will make this again.

Wow, this recipe is amazing!  We loved it!!  And how easy to create!  The only change I made was I also coated it with Panko and then baked it instead of frying it until done.  Just wonderful!

I tried this recipe and it's delicious. but i find that cutting the chicken breast in half, but let the edges attached, and put the ham and the cheese between the two layers is more efficient than folding it and in that way the chicken will take less time to be well cooked

Well, not that this needs another glowing review, but it truly is scrumptious! And for how elegant it presents, I think it's a pretty simple and fairly quick recipe to prepare. To lighten it up a bit I do reduce the butter to 2 Tablespoons and add a bit of olive oil when browning the chicken rolls. I also use bread crumbs in place of the flour when coating, chicken broth in place of the wine and I use skim milk in place of the cream. It comes out super moist and delicious but much lighter calorie-wise.

Like many others, I'm not a fan of those who rate recipes based on their OWN creations so I'm rating this as a 5-star as is BUT...as an RD, I'm adding healthful changes I made the 2nd time I made this awesome recipe that my family agrees doesn't take away from the wonderful flavors but will safe you calories, fat that aren't necessary.  (1) use shaved deli ham - no flavor change but less sodium, calories & fat and much easier to roll. (2) used 2Tbsp. whipped butter and 2 Tbsp olive oil for a blend that allows for higher heat, and less saturated fat and added the heart healthy mono fat.  (3) substituted lite coconut milk for the whipping cream saving calories, fat but with same great richness with all the same sinful goodness this dish has to offer.  thanks for sharing.

Amazing. I think this has been my husband's favorite--I'm a new cook and he's a tough critic. 
I followed the directions with these modifications:
-sauteed the breasts (which i didn't hammer out but cut in halves since they were so big) in butter first--for about 15 minutes
-then stuffed breasts with cheese and ham, brushed with 2 raw eggs and bread crumbs, added sauce to dish and baked for 25 minutes
-used cream vs. whipping cream--was still great
-used almond meal instead of flour for the sauce
-*used Pinot Grigio, pretty good flavor
Will definitely put this on my cooking STAPLES list!

This recipe is amazing with a few adjustments. 

I lined a baking dish with tin foil for easy clean up and then combined about 1C Italian bread crumbs with 1 tbsp grapeseed oil and 1 tbsp white cooking wine. I stirred until breadcrumbs were lightly moistened and then covered bottom of baking dish. I then followed the directions for pounding chicken, laid a couple slices of ham (I used my own leftovers rather than deli meat), and used shredded swiss rather than slices (just what I had on hand). I didn't seal with toothpick as it wasn't necessary, just laid on the dish, open end down. I then lightly patted the top of chicken with more grapeseed oil and poured about 1/2C breadcrumbs over the top. I closed up the tinfoil and baked at 350 for 20 minutes. After that time, I opened the tin foil, drizzled a little more oil over the top & baked for another 10 minutes (sprinkled shredded swiss over the top for last 3 minutes).

As for the sauce, BEFORE putting chicken in oven, in a saucepan I combined 1C white cooking wine with about 2 tsp seasoned boullion granules over medium heat. I let that heat up, meanwhile combining 1 1/2 C heavy cream with 1 tbsp corn starch in a bowl. I then slowly added the cream mixture to the pot, stirring constantly with a fork. After thickened, I set aside. When meal was just about done,  I heat up again over medium and added two large dollops of sour cream, stirring until combined. It was DELICIOUS!

I halved the recipe, used thighs instead of breasts, and provolone instead of swiss (what I had on-hand!). I wouldn't use provolone again but the rest of the recipe turned out great, especially the sauce! I used chardonnay as the wine.

Minority opinion: my husband and I both found this to be a little below average, especially when compared with other recipes on this site. Our main complaint was that the chicken was bland and the sauce, while okay, was not as good as other similar sauces.  In fairness, we did follow the suggestions of other reviewers as follows:  1.  we pounded the breasts to less than 1/2 inch.  2.  we wrapped the cheese inside 2 slices of ham such that the cheese did not leak out.  3.  we purposely did not use a salty ham so that was not an issue.  4.  we spread a very thin layer of Dijon inside the breast.  5.  we did flour, then egg wash, then panko which we think did improve the coating.  6.  we browned then finished baking in the oven so the chicken was tender.  7.  we added a fair amount of sauce to the taste as it was so bland as well as a pinch of garlic 8.  we doubled the sauce as we like sauce and also planned to use some of the sauce on fresh roasted asparagus.  So, while not following the original recipe exactly, we feel we gave it as fair a shot as we could for our tastes.  Perhaps we've become a little spoiled by other recipes on this site or perhaps our expectations were too high.  Still, we were quite disappointed.  We won't be making this again.

I love this meal, it is now my favorite, used to be rib eye steaks but now I prefer this dish.  I can make it so fast only 40 min start to finish.  I don't get carried away flattening and rolling the chicken, I simply butterfly the chicken breasts, bread them on one side, fry them in the butter for about 3 minutes, then take them out and place plenty of good smoked ham, and Swiss cheese inside, the open uncooked side, fold the breast back together and throw it in a 350 degree oven for 25 minutes, then add the cream sauce.  So simple, and the presentation is just fine.  I see other photos where I think other people do the same thing.  I also see many people saying the cheese is all melted out.  If you do not over cook the chicken, which I think many people do, you will only lose just a small amount onto the bottom of the pan.  Basically when you see the cheese oozing out, you know it's ready.  Enjoy!

This was delicious! I beat the chicken before stuffing and rolling so that took my cook time down to 18-20 minutes instead of 30. I will definitely cook this again. The husband loved it. Might try bread crumbs next time though.

Very good recipe.  My only advice is to buy the thin sliced chicken breasts so you don't have to pound anything out.

Easy to follow recipe.  I am not a fan of Chicken Cordon Bleu.  I asked my husband 1 to 5 stars for my review, he said an easy 5.  Will keep, and make it again for him.

Wow, this is spectacular!Just a couple of minor changes: We prefer baking to frying, so coated the chicken with bread crumbs and italian seasoning, added the ham and swiss and baked for 25 min. at 350. Cooked the sauce separately on the stovetop. Served these up with Oven-Roasted Asparagus (also a 5 star recipe from this site). The sauce was just fantastic on both! This will be a regular in our home. So easy to make and yet, my wife hasn't stopped talking about how great it was! Thanks Behr!

The best part of this recipe is the sauce but the whole thing is yummy. Will definitely keep making this in our normal rotation.

This was my first attempt to make Chicken Cordon Bleu and it turned out well. Next time though, I'll be sure to use string instead of toothpicks, as a lot of the swiss cheese oozed out and left the chicken a little drier than need be. I also think I'll add some fresh chopped basil to the sauce at the end as suggested by one of the earlier reviews.

Even my kids love this dish.  I put the chicken on top of a bed of steamed green beans, then pour the creamy sauce all over it, it makes the vegi tastes super yummy as well.  It goes well with steamed rice or mashed potato.  I also used whole milk in lieu of cream to make it less fat, and it tastes just as good (I made it both ways to compare).

This is amazing!  I did pound my chicken breast because they were very thick. From other reviewer suggestions, I used a baked ham that didn't have water added and I paired it with mushroom pilaf and asparagus. My family LOVED it. Thanks so much for a great recipe.

maybe im not a fan of chicken cordon bleu but honestly i didn't' think it was that great. for a 5 star recipe, i usually have stellar results but this one just wasn't that great for all the effort. will probably not make again anytime in the near future.

This was wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly except, as others have suggested, I doubled the sauce. Everyone loved it! I thought I had made way too much but there were no leftovers. I definitely will be making this one again and again.

The best ever but I did make a few changes, Instead of the flour mix I brushed the outside of chicken with egg and sprinkled on Progressive Italian bread crumb then fried them with the butter, bouillon, and wine until I saw no pink, after I removed them from the juices and baked them at 350 for 15 minutes to insure theres no pink. I added fresh mushrooms to the wine mixture and drippings. Once cooked I proceeded with the whipping creme and cornstarch. I made this with pesto pasta, grilled asparagus and bread with butter. Picture 146. =)

The flavors were all there, but I actually did not enjoy this recipe as much as other baked chicken cordon bleu recipes.  The chicken wouldn't cook evenly and by the time it was cooked, the swiss managed to escape and burn in the pan, so I wasn't able to make a sauce.  If I try this recipe again, I will definitely choose to oven bake it and skip stovetop.

Gorgeous. I cooked this for my husband and parents one Saturday evening. I'd never done it before and once I'd mastered the art of folding the cheese and ham in the chicken, everything was plain sailing. I wouldn't change anything. very nomi nomi !

one of my husband's favorites.  i browned the chicken per the recipe then put it in the oven for 20 mins.  I combinded the cream, wine, boullion, and cornstarch and simmered for a few mins to drizzle on top of the chicken.  When I asked my husband how he would review the recipe the only thing he could say was "awesome."

This was fabulous and fairly easy. After reading some of the other reviews, after rolling up the chicken with ham & swiss, I dipped in flour with paprika, then egg, then bread crumbs. Then I browned in a pan with butter for about 6 minutes turning it to get all sides and baked at 350 for 15 minutes. I think it was slightly overdone, but not too bad. Next time I will bake for less. I served with red potatoes and green beans and my husband loved it! Will def make again! Sauce was yummy! Didn't have cream so used milk and butter with wine and cornstarch as another reviewer suggested.

I made this for our romantic Valentine's Day celebration dinner.  It is truely worth 5 stars!  The sauce is so tasty with just a hint of wine.  I made this exactly as written, except I scaled it down for 3 chicken breasts.  We enjoyed this so much...this one will be made again and again.  Thanks Behr!

Excellent recipe! I did make a few modifications; therefore I only rated it a 4. I floured but then drudged in egg and coated with Panko. I also used 1/2 butter and 1/2 oil to brown in skillet (about 10 minutes), then placed in over for 20 minutes. I served sauce on side. Definitely a keeper!

This dish is awesome. First time making it, I followed the recipe to the T. It turned out perfect. The chicken was moist and sauce was amazing. I will defiantly cook this again in the near future!

I scaled down the recipe to 3 servings. I used a little more flour than called for, added in garlic salt and black pepper. I used chicken broth instead of the wine which I doubled and didn't use the bouillon cube. The amount of butter was unnecessary and scaled that down a tad. To get a good role on the chicken the breasts must be pounded very thin. I gave it four stars because I thought the measurements and seasonings were a little off. This recipe is very easy and oh so good. Yummm....

OMG! This is sooooo delicious! I prefer to bake my chicken in the oven, just what I am comfortable with. The sauce is to DIE for!

Awesome RECIPE!!! I'd give this recipe 10 stars if I could. When my husband started eating it, he told me it was outstanding, the best I ever made and ate almost every piece. I was so worried there wasn't going to be enough for me and the kids. This recipe will be in my personal cookbook forever. Thank YOU for sharing it.

Excellent !,,my family loved this recipe. Was very easy. The only thing i changed was that i butterflied the chicken breast and just folded the beast. Cooked quicker and delicious. I  also used honey ham and a sharper swiss. This gave a better flavor

yummy.   I tried doing it in the oven after I browned it but the chicken stayed raw.  I will follow the directions next time!  I used Fat Free 1/2 and 1/2 and browned chicken in butter and oil.  my hubby loved it.  Anyone know how to keep the cheese inside the chicken though?
Edit- I made Tyler Florence's version in the oven with ham and swiss and it was great.  I used this sauce and it was not so great.  I need a sauce!  Anyone?

So good! I didn't roll the meat as traditionally made (no toothpicks!) So I made it as directed and at the end, added ham, topped with swiss and broiled it till the cheese was bubbly. 
Then I topped it with the cream sauce goodness...SO DELISH!

This was absolutely delicious.  We just had leftovers tonight and hubby is still raving about it.  Only thing that I did differently was to cook the chicken on the stove for 20 minutes and then put it on a cookie sheet that I covered with foil (easier clean-up), then into the oven at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes, while preparing the sauce and sides.  I also used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil when preparing the chicken on the stove.  This is definitely 'company worthy' chicken!

This was the first chicken cordon bleu recipe I ever tried and everyone really enjoyed it. It was a bit salty for my taste, but I try hard to avoid salt so I am a little biased. Everyone that I cooked it for has requested that I make it again!

This recipe blew me away! My husband and I both enjoyed it immensely, and it has become our default "company" dish. Apparently my father-in-law couldn't stop talking about it for days, and several other friends have asked for the recipe! After reading a few other reviews, I decided to bake the chicken at 350 for 20 minutes after browning it in the skillet, adding the butter from the pan straight into the baking dish with the chicken. I make the sauce separately by combining white Zinfandel and chicken bouillon and bringing it to a simmer before adding the cornstarch/cream mixture. The chicken and sauce come out perfectly each time!

This was a great recipe, but l put my chicken in the oven after l browned it on the stove.  I made the cream sauce in a sauce pan while the chicken was in the oven.  I used UNSALTED butter and it made a huge difference in the taste of the sauce!! (bad - tasted like clam water) This sauce should Always be made with SALTED butter!!  (After adding salt & a few other seasonings it was good)

Wonderful, rich and savory. My presentation was a little bit homely but the flavor overcame the aesthetics. With practise, I think the recipe will be better looking.

DELICIOUS! My only complaint is that the recipe as it is doesn't make enough of the incredible sauce. I'm lucky I made extra, because I ended up putting it on everything else on the plate.

My 3, 5, and 11 year old sons all love this, husband too! One of the best recipes I have found on allrecipes:)

Only change I made was using a cube instead of granules because I didn't have any. I'm making it for a second time right now and am going to try half and half to see if it is usable to bring the cost of this down.

All I can say is Wow. Chicken Cordon Bleu is my favorite meal and also a favorite of my husband's. I saw this recipe and thought it would be nice to try something just a tad different. I am so glad that I did. The only changes I made was that I used Panko Breadcrumbs instead of flour to make it a little more crispy and replace 1/2 cup of wine with 1/2 cup of chicken broth since my husband can't take a chance of having any alcohol in his system for work. I was told that I was not able to make this any other way than this way any more.

Cooked this tonight for my Girlfriend and her daughter. Totally awesome, I did follow the ideas in MEGEBY's review and as some of the others pointed out, use the WINE. Served with asparagus and creamy mashed potatoes. Will definately make this one again soon.

This dish was amazing! My husband had a goofy smile on his face the entire time he was eating it. I didn't add or change much to the recipe. Added a touch more wine but that's about it. Delish!!

Tried this tonight.  My husband doesn't like cream sauces so I had no choice but to cook the chicken separate from the sauce.  I breaded the chicken in and panko and used chicken broth instead of wine only because I didn't have any wine on hand. 
I used a combination of heavy cream and milk for the sauce.  It would be fine with only milk too.  
Great recipe!

This recipe is perfect for the chicken.  I changed the sauce and made a quick roux with butter, flour, and chicken broth.  
Served with steamed asparagus and cornbread stuffing.

I doubled this recipe and was so glad that I did because everyone loved it.  The older folks liked the "gravy" and the younger ones liked the "sauce". ;)  I used thin slices of Black Forest Ham and precut slices of Swiss cheese.  The chicken was tender but maintained its shape even after the toothpicks were removed.  Please try this, it will be a keeper for sure.

This deserves every bit of five stars. It's a fantastic recipe and very quick and easy to make. One suggestion: do not use toothpicks to secure the meat; they are impossible to remove after cooking. I will use string instead next time. This is a perfect casual dinner party main course.
Update: I've made this a lot since my last review. I now use kitchen string to secure the meat, and criss cross it like  you would a boxed gift. It works perfectly and keeps all of the filling in really well. This is one of my favorites. I serve it with mashed potatoes and a green vegetable.

I am a beginner cook, and this was easy and delicious!  The only negative thing about it is the high fat content due to the butter and heavy cream.  The wine really adds flavor.  Yum!

This was delicious! Made as directed, turned out wonderful! Next time I make I will use half butter and half olive oil as suggested. I used all butter and the sauce was a little too rich for my taste.

Delicious, have made a few times, no changes to recipe, one caution: this recipe is on the saltier tasting likely due to the ham and cheese, it may be better with low sodium ham but I have not tried that yet

I made this for my family last week. I took the advise of many that reviewed this already and floured, egg washed and coated in panko. My husband who is a very picky eater especially about trying new things LOVED it. This will definately be a part  of our menu rotation. Also this dish wasvery easy to pepare

This was a very good and easy recipe.  Next time I will use cooking string instead of toothpicks.  I added  a seasoned buttermilk and egg mixture dip and dusted with flour and Panko.
Since the chicken had a crust, when I covered it for 20 minutes, the crust became moist.  But is was still good with the sauce.  And as some others suggested, I used chicken broth instead of wine.
All in all, it was a nice dish.  My daughter cut into hers and said..."Wowwww, mine has a surprise in it!!!"

WOW! this turned out to be the best dinner I have ever made... I had some dirty rice and sauted veggies on the side and it was a hit.  Only problem was my cheese melted out but I just scooped it up and placed on top.  Sadly these do not tase the same when reheated as leftovers :(

Oh myyyy this was goooood!!!!  I made this pretty much exactly as stated.  I pounded the breasts flat, so only needed to cook about 20 min,  and used Sauvignon Blanc.  AMAZING.  Definitely a keeper!!

5 S. Restaurant grade quality recipe ! The only change I did was to use smoked ham instead of normal ham, it added a great taste.

this was pretty great! i used chicken broth instead of wine but other than that i followed exactly! this was my first time having chicken cordon bleu so i don't have anything to compare this to but my husband has had chicken cordon bleu a few times and said this was awesome! it is a little time consuming so i won't make often but i will make again!

Very easy and tasty!  Since it is just two of us I used 2 chicken breasts pounded, dipped in egg and then coated in plain bread crumbs.  I did brown in butter/olive oil and baked for 20 minutes.  I made the sauce for six servings.  I sliced the breasts into rounds and poured the sauce over before serving.  Definitely company worthy!  Thank you for the recipe!

This has become a go-to recipe for an easy way to truly impress guests.  It is a pretty uncomplicated recipe, as gourmet-looking recipes go, and it is delicious.  I serve with Microwave Risotto (on this site).

I had never made homemade chicken cordon bleu before, and I think this recipe turned out pretty well.  The sauce is absolutely fantastic (could've just eaten that with a spoon).  I also used American cheese instead of Swiss because that's what I had on hand.  My chicken turned out a little tough, but that's likely my own fault as I am always afraid that I will undercook it.  Overall, will definitely be making again in the future.

Very good and that wine/cream sauce is amazing. Though this is definitely a recipe I can't make too often on account of its *ahem* richness, but definitely nice for a special meal.

I unfortunately used an altered version of the original recipe and spread honey mustard inside with the ham and cheese. This addition did not fare well with our 6 teens. Next time I will Stick with the basic recipe.

best cordon bleu recipe-ever! a few modifications were made - used half slice of swiss and a half slice of provolone, used virginia baked ham, didn't have paprika-just salt & pepper, i wanted extra sauce to use with side rice side dish, so i used 1 c of wine and 1 knorr chicken boul. cube in 1 c of h20, used half and half for cream and increased amount as well. served roasted asparagus as the other side. 2 adults & 3 kids loved it!

Very, very tasty. Agree that they need to be pounded out to 1/2 in ch thick or thinner in order to be manageable.

This came out delicious.

I pounded the chicken out quite a bit, and sprinkled some chopped basil on top of the ham & cheese.  As well as a sprinkling of salt and pepper.

In the flour mixture I added 2 teaspoons of garlic powder.  At the very end I also added julienned basil. 
my boyfriend loved it, I'll make it again.

I first made this recipe for my mothers birthday back in November. I wound up making it again about a week later for my best friend. Then for Christmas. Valentines, and Mothers Day. The sauce is unbelievable, and I double it every time (at least). I'm planning on having a dinner party at my house next month, and there's absolutely no doubt that this is what I'll be making. It's become my recipe trump card .

I took one reviewer's advice and used half butter, half olive oil, and added some chopped fresh basil at the end.  Easy, and very good!

I was expecting so much from this recipe when it comes to taste but it lacked a lot. Not impressed and I'll keep searching for that perfect recipe!

Great recipe...this is one of my growing arsenal of favorites to serve to guests. I use prosciutto to give a little different twist to it. Delicious, easy recipe.

I followed directions except I doubled the sauce.  Was pretty good.  Wonder how it would have been if I cooked it in the oven instead of on the stove top in the wine.  I think I actually prefer my own recipe for cordon bleu, but glad I tried.

I loved this recipe and so did my boyfriend. Now I get upset when people change the recipe and then review it so I am sorry to say that I had to because I was missing the wine. (After becoming pregnant it just wasn't needed in the house). So I used Sparkling Cider instead and the sauce was great. I have never made Chicken Cordon Bleu in a frying pan before, I usually bake it in the oven. I was a little disappointed that the cheese melted out of the middle. Other than that it was a fantastic recipe.

Incredible! I only simmered for 15 minutes, though, because I pounded the breasts flat. My husband especially liked the sauce. Very flavorful.

Thsi recipe is great. Husband loved it. I always use thin sliced cutlets in my chicken recipes. As good as it was as written, I also do a variation of it: saute chix, no ham & cheese, & no heavy cream. Still a delicious sauce on top of flavorful chix

Wow! Great recipe! I prepped the chicken to the recipe, except I browned in a pan, then put in oven for 30 minutes covered with foil in a greased casserole tray. I made the sauce right after, and then poured over the chicken and waited the remaining time. The wine made the sauce. I hate to repeat what everyone else is saying, but the sauce is just 100% delicious. I paired this recipe with a Garlic, Basil, Parmesan Angel Hair Pasta. I even put just a bit of the sauce when making the pasta. My girlfriend said this was the best, and her favorite meal, I've made for her. So this recipe will for sure go in the rotation (and the sauce, I will use for other dishes in the future also). The only thing I wished I would have done differently was to reduce the sauce a bit more, no biggie. Good eats!

This recipe was pretty good but it was a pain in the (bleep) for me.  Messy!  LOL.  Husband enjoys watching while I cook and thought it was a lot of work too.  He enjoyed it though.  I bought chicken breasts from the butcher.  They were TOO thick so I had to literally filet the breasts which made them easier to manage in rolling them up.  Other than the work involved, not too bad.  Next time, I would not use butter.  Felt like you could smell and taste the calories cooking.

This was my first time attempting Chicken Cordon Blue with my husband’s help.  We used Chicken stock instead of White Wine thanks to another reviewer. My tip would be to make sure you have a good brand of tooth picks on hand. We used a no name brand and they kept breaking, I'm sure that's a no brainer but we wanted to use what we had on hand and found out the hard way. Loved this, I will use it again.

Lots of people offer their suggestions on tweaking the recipe.  While their suggestions may add some flare, I must say... this recipe is a go-to for me.  It is delicious... the sauce is outstanding... I drizzle some on the egg noodles I serve with the chicken.  Once you make this... it will definitely be one that will be in your recipe box for a long time to be used over and over.

Absolutely amazing!!!! The gravy/sauce came out perfect and put this recipe over the top! I actually made this while cooking on a fishing boat in Alaska over the summer and everyone LOVED it! It was by far their favorite thing I cooked all summer! Everyone kept saying that it was better than something you could get in a restaurant!

This was so great, I put it in the oven for about 15 minutes at 400 once I had poured some of the sauce over it. It was great and created some caramelization on the top which is always pleasant. FIVE stars...will make again.

Great recipe! I followed others suggestion to brown in pan but back at 350 for about 30-35 minutes for the remainder cook time. I also mixed the wine sauce and poured it over the chicken for the last 10 minutes of baking. It turned out perfect!

This is delicious, especially the sauce!  I added garlic powder with the paprika and used pinot grigio for the white wine.  I also used an egg wash to coat the chicken pieces.  Aside from that, the recipe is deeelish!

Everyone in my house loves this recipe.  The sauce is amazing.  You will definitely want to double it.  I serve this with rice & peas. Pour the sauce over everything!  My husband used the leftover sauce over eggs for an Eggs Benedict-type dish.  I've used Apple juice instead of wine, and it's fine.  Get the biggest chicken breasts you can find to make the rolling easier.

The best chicken cordon bleu I have made. The sauce makes it taste incredible! I always add extra wine for the chicken to cook in and so that I can have even more sauce. Everyone who I make it for is a fan.

This recipe was very good. I choose to use half and half instead of heavy cream. It was just as good. I will probably use string the next time. The tooth picks got stuck in the meat. I also decide to finish it off in the oven for 30 mintues. I served with brocolli.  Yummy!!!!!!!!

I made this last week for my boyfriend and it turned out perfectly! I served it with a baby green salad and the meal was one of the best we've had in awhile. He told me and has kept telling people in conversation that it is no lie the best Chicken he has ever had, and that's not his "boyfriend biased opinion"-it's genuinely good! And I agree! The sauce made  at the end was perfect because the heavy whipping cream and the corn starch was mixed in the pan with all the leftover juices from cooking the chicken. It was a good combination  of flavor, and a simple way to make the sauce. Also, this recipe is healthier than some (although the heavy whipping cream ads fat) and I didn't finish the meal feeling guilty for eating it. I felt very satisfied!

Husband approved *****  Tried it on him one night, he's not a fan of chicken and said he didn't like cordon bleu.  Ha...told him it was a cheese/ham chicken wrap and he devoured it, asking for the leftovers for his lunch.  I did tell him its chicken cordon bleu and he said he loves it : )  Thanks for sharing the recipe

I loved this recipe but, I found with the wine simmering the floured pieces, it took with it the flower from the chicken so the corn starch really wasn't needed - just my opinion. I also used European style butter as it doesn't have as much water at the rest.

The best chicken cordon bleu recipe I have ever made.  In fact the first time I made it for my mom, she asked me to make it again the next night.  That was definately a first!

This was excellent! I followed the recipe exactly how it was written except for cooking. I only let it simmer in the wine for 15 min then put in a 200 degree oven while I made the sauce. Everything was ready at the same time and was a huge success for my sister's request for her birthday dinner. My husband had seconds and my dad, sister and  brother-in-law raved at how perfect it was. Clean plates all around! Thanks!

I thought it was too salty and just now figured out that I used 5 times the amount of bouillon than the I should have.  That being said, it was still awesome!  I will be making this again but with the proper amount of bouillon. I wasn't too sure about making it in the skillet, but it was moist and delicious.

There is only one word for this dish: DECADENT!  I made a romantic dinner including this, some string zucchini, and white wine... This was so amazing we didn't even touch our veggies!! I have a tiny counter space and no mallet, so I just butterflied the chicken (or attempted to, anyways), and I added a little bit of Greek Seasoning to the flour. Delicious! In the future I would definitely use more cheese & ham, or else try to get the chicken much much thinner. This meal should come with a warning label: Do not operate heavy machinery!

Fantastic. I crumbed the chicken with flour & paprika mix, egg & then breadcrumbs before browning in butter & finishing in the oven while I made the sauce. Rave reviews all round.

This recipe is so good. I've never made chicken Cordon Blue and now this is the only recipe I will use. My only alterations where, I don't like swiss cheese so I used Mozzarella, and I used smoked ham lunch meat because thats what was in the fridge. Turned out great. Loved the sauce!

I thought this recipe was mediocre.  Perhaps, I don't like Chicken Cordon Bleu as much as I thought.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  I guess I was expecting something with oozing cheesy goodness.  This was much drier than expected.

Delicious! The directions were a smidge confusing for me....warmed the wine and then dissolved the bouillion in it...then I wasn't sure if I was supposed to use the same skillet or a new one when cooking the whipping cream/cornstarch mix...used the same skillet and it worked out well. Bf said it was my best meal yet! Thank you!

This isn't the easiest thing to make, but now that I've made it more than once, things go by quicker and easier.  I put the chicken breasts into a zip-lock baggie that has the air pushed out and pound them that way to avoid showering my kitchen with chicken juices.  The sauce for this is AMAZING.  I usually serve it with steamed asparagus drizzled with the sauce. Everyone who's eaten this at my house has been truly amazed at how good it is.  In fact, a very rich relative of mine who is always eating at fancy-smancy resturants swore it was the best he's ever had.

This was an amazing Cordon Bleu recipe! The wine sauce completely complements the meal. I pounded my chicken uber thin and placed grated swiss cheese long the full breast. I then placed sandwich slice thickness ham slices and cut them to the shape of the chicken. I was able to roll these fairly thick, but I loved the ratio of chicken/cheese/ham. Another suggestion -- make extra and wrap them in syran wrap tightly as is! Then all you have to do is defrost, brown and make the sauce for another meal. It freezes really well!

Very good!  I followed the recipe to a "T" and it came out beautiful!  Nothing difficult, but tastes like you slaved away in the kitchen for hours!  A new favorite for sure.

I think Julia Child would cringe at my version of this dish but technically it is what it is called.  I gave up pounding after the first breast!  Flatten the breast w/ your hand evenly on a cutting board and slice the breast (horizontally) in half.  (You might need more cheese and ham doing it this way.)  Place a slice of cheese and then ham on top (it will probably be 1/2 a slice since it's not pounded) and roll up, putting a toothpick through the middle.  Place them in a baking dish and bake at 350 for 30 min.  (Skipping the flouring and browning step.) While baking, mix the wine, bouillon, and whipping cream w/ cornstarch in a saucepan until slightly thickened.  (After reading the reviews, I automatically doubled the sauce!)  Poured some of the sauce over the chicken after baking and return to oven for another 5-10 min.  This was another yummylicious dish!    Fewer carbs, calories, and gluten free, provided that you use a gluten free bouillon, when made this way without sacrificing taste!  Bon Appetit!

best chicken cordon bleu ive ever had.  most of the time it takes forever to prepare and the end result has always been just mediocre.  this is definitely worth the tedious pounding, stuffing, rolling, and tying.  i only used 3 chicken breast but still left the amount of sauce the same... very good.

This is delicious. I was doing a couple of things at once and completely forgot the flour and paprika step but it didn't matter because it was still awesome. The chicken was so tender and the sauce was so good. My family loved it. Can't wait to make it again.

I recommend cutting a pocket into the chicken and inserting the ham and cheese, it cooks much more neatly then- no seeping cheese oozing out of the sides.

The whole family loved it.  The sauce is what makes it a 5 star recipe in my opinion.  I used canned chicke broth instead of the wine, and left out the chicken bullion.

This recipe is fantastic!  The sauce is to die for!  I recommend using a nice pinot grigio for the sauce.  My husband has made this three times in the past few months and it never dissappoints.  We serve it with rice pilaf and steamed broccoli.

Perfect! I, like others suggested, saved the sauce (instead of cooking the chicken in the wine) for the end and just drizzled it on at the end. This will absolutely be something I'll make again.

This was wounderful. I pounded my chicken breast, and used the eggwash half flour and half panko bread crumbs. I forgot to buy swiss cheese [woops], but I used a slice of american with some parmessan cheese. It tasted wounderful, can't wait to make it with the swiss. Doubled the sauce, yum. I didn't have any tooth picks, so I broke my wooded skewers in half to thread the chicken. Worked like a charm, and big enough to see. :)

LOVED the recipe.  I rated it 4 stars because like other reviewers, I changed the way it was prepared.  I tied with butcher twine instead of toothpicks.  After I browned the chicken, I baked it in 350 oven for 30 min.  Before it was done cooking in a saucepan I melted butter and added wine and bouillon, then whisked in the cornstarch/cream mixture-cooked til bubbly.  I sliced the chicken,put on serving platter  and poured the sauce over and garnished with parsley.  Cooking as recommended would have indeed increased the amount of fat.

I think this is my families favorite meal!  Pounded to even thickness.  Used panko breadcrumbs vs. flour.  It browns up so nice in the butter.  I used a large cast iron skillet for both browning and simmering.  They turn out nice tender and juicy.  Delish!!

Just made last night.  Absolutely delicious.  Pounded the breast to even thickness, about 1/2 inch. Filled as directed, drenched in flour, browned on both sides for 7 minutes in cast iron skillet and finished cooking the chicken in 350 degree oven in 15-20 minutes.  Removed chicken to a plate, kept warm.  Added wine and bouillon to pan. Simmered for 3 minutes, then finished with the cream and let that thicken.  Wow!  I can not encourage you enough to try this recipe.  I would feel so proud to serve this to family and company.  Thank you so much for posting!!

Super yummy! My husband and my son loved this recipe. I pounded the chicken breasts flat and placed the ham and cheese slices on the flatten breast. Then I rolled each breast up and secured with a couple of toothpicks. I dipped the chicken in a beaten egg before rolling in flour. I used margarine instead of butter to brown the chicken just because I didn't have any butter. I was a little worried the cheese would melt and all run out of the chicken roll-up, but only a tiny bit did. I used a meat thermometer to check for doneness and they were done a few minutes sooner than the recipe states. Fantastic recipe!

My favorite recipe from this site.  My family and friends love it.  I took others advice and always put the chicken in the oven while I make the sauce.  I also spread some dijon mustard on the chicken before adding the ham and cheese.  Yummy!

I fried the chicken in butter for about 10 minutes until it was nicely browned, then I put it in the oven at 350 for another hour. Instead of simmering the chicken in the sauce, I whisked the cream,wine, bouillon and cornstarch in a bowl, then simmered it with the butter I used to cook chicken for about 10 min.  and spooned it over the chicken. It turned out fantastic!

One word: AWESOME!  I doubled the cream, as suggested, as it was a great success.

This is a keeper!  My first time ever making chicken cordon bleu, and it actually tasted like I knew what I was doing!  I followed the recipe exactly (doubled the sauce - that was good advice) and it was terrific.  I sliced the chicken into medallions for presentation and served it over egg noodles: turned out to be a good match.  Looking forward to leftovers!

Fabulous! I rolled bundles first in flour, then egg wash, and then dried bread crumbs flavored with garlic powder, oregano, and parmesan cheese. Make sure you double the sauce. It is wonderful and we are very particular!!

Awesome! The sauce is so good over vegetables as well. I pound out the chicken, to make it easier and to shorten cook time. The last time I didn't have swiss cheese so I used smoked provolone, and I   preferred it!

I have been making an excellent Chicken Cordon Bleu for years but the cream sauce and color addition of paprika in this recipe added a whole new dimension and flavor kick that were both divine! So yummy. I too browned the chicken and let it finish cooking in the oven. Wowie! This made me popular tonight!

Yummy.  At the time I didn't have a meat pounder, but I got one now.  I will make the chicken flatter next time.

I never makes any comments, but HAD to make one here- this recipe is sooo good!!! I followed some of the other reviews and used egg/bread crumbs instead of flour and browned the chicken then baked in oven at 350 for 30 mins. Also, I doubled the sauce, next time I might even triple it! Yum!

A very similar version of this recipe has been passed down from my Grandfather.  A critical modification is Cappocollo (spicy Italian ham)...and I tend to use a few slices.  I also add sliced, fresh mushrooms on top of the chicken before topping it with the sauce.

This was very good but it was a lot of work. The family thought the sauce was amazing so I think next time I will just throw it over regular breaded chicken instead of stuffing it. Either way it was delish just time consuming.

Came out very very good.  I made it exactly as shown, and found that I had to add more salt and white wine to suit our tastes.  Other than that, it was great!

WOW!!!  This was truly wonderful!! A definite keeper but do double the sauce. Followed the directions as written (except for the sauce doubling) and it was unbelievable!! The most surprising part was how incredibly easy it is! I served it on chicken flavored rice. Will impress all you make this for and they will think you spent hours on it. I wish there were more than 5 stars available to rate this!

Love this recipe!!! The sauce was wonderful and the chicken tastes amazing with the ham and swiss cheese. My stepson wasn't too big on the wine taste in the sauce so next time I make this I might use chicken broth instead as suggested in another review. I will definitly be making this again.

Love this recipe. I do double the sauce ingredients because all my friends want extra sauce..in fact they can almost drink it :) I also use turkey ham, so that the ham is not as sweet..some people want no sweetness. Might be a alittle healthier..hehe. Thanks for sharing this!

This really is delicious, however, I did find it to be rather salty. That doesn't bother me, but might some. Perhaps the boullion and ham combined added a lot of sodium?

this was absolutely fabulous!  stuffing the breasts is a bit of work, but we double (or triple) that part of the recipe (which is only a little bit extra work) and freeze the extra.  then next few times we make it, just thaw the chicken overnight, cook as directed, and whip up that amazing sauce!

Everyone liked it but it tasted more like chicken paprikas than cordon bleu.  I followed the directions exactly and my sauce was more red so watch how much paprika you add.

This is FANTASTIC!! My boyfriend thinks im a gourmet cook after this meal! Followed directions exactly and it came out perfect.  When you sautee the chicken, use low heat.  This will ensure an even browning and the meat will not burn.  I served this with saffron rice and fresh green beans...delicious!

Very delicious and the whole family loved it, including husband, a 3 year old and  5 year old and a 1 year old.  Pretty simple, i followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect for us. I did use thinly sliced breasts so i didnt have to pound them, thats the way to go.  Will make often. Its hard to find something for dinner that everyone likes.

This was very good. Not "the best" though. I followed others advice and browned them and then baked them and then returned to the fry pan to add the cream. This method made me feel better than the chicken was fully cooked. It was hard to brown them evenly with the toothpicks sticking out all over. I had a hard time getting my chicken breast pounded out thin enough to wrap all around the ham and cheese so I did the best I could. Sauce was very rich and yummy! I used Chardonney.

The addition of the wine sauce really made this an excellent recipe! Fairly easy, though it took longer than 1/2 an hour to cook. The chicken may have been too thick, I suggest taking the advice to pound it very thin. I used long metal picks to hold together while cooking, it seems small wooden ones would have gotten lost in there. Also subbed half&half for the heavy cream, the sauce was still perfect. I served it with broccoli and pasta on the side, everyone loved it!

Wonderful cordon bleu. I have tried a variation on this once with veal, and this is equally as good. The only thing I did differently was remove the chicken after frying and bake it for 20 minutes at 350F as suggested by others, instead of braising it in the wine (my family isn't too fond of "wine-piquant" dishes). It was excellent. :)

This is probably the best chicken cordon bleu I've ever had... I highly recommend it.. it's wonderful! ~ November 19 '09' Ok I just made it again.. and I can't believe I waited so long!! This truly is fantastic! IT IS THE BEST!! It's way better than your average Cordon Bleu!! next time I'm going maybe make more sauce, which i'm not sure i'll need,but the creamier the better!.. and serve it over angel hair with garlic bread... this is gourmet delight!! MMMM We are having left overs tonight and can't wait!! ;)

This recipe is easy to make and really yummy. I found it easier to slice the chicken almost completely in half and stuffing it instead of pounding it out and it worked just as well! This is a keeper in our house!

Really good.  Only changed from heavy cream to half & half.  Served over white rice.
UPDATE:  Sauce is better with heavy cream definitely!

so, I thought that it sounded a little easy, and was a little weary of trying it because it didn't have the mushroom/wine sauce. Boy was I wrong. This recipe is awesome, I didn't change a thing, and it was phenomenal. My husband is the one who turned me on to cordon bleu, and he raved about it. I will continue to make this every time he askes for chicken cordon bleu. Just a little advice: Dont over cook the sauce, it starts to separate. And dont worry about the cheese melting out of the chicken, it adds a wonderful flavor to the amazing sauce!!!

This was an exceptional recipe!  I doubled the sauce, this way there was extra to serve over angel hair.  I don't know how people could say it's okay to omit the white wine!  That would be like leaving out sugar in a cake.  The white wine is what makes this recipe!  I also added freshly chopped parsley to the sauce at the end.  Instead of bouillon granules I just added some chicken broth.  And the final change is that after I browned the chicken roll ups, I baked them at 350 for about 15 minutes. Meanwhile I made the sauce and then added the roll ups back to the pan and simmered them in the sauce for 5 or so minutes.

Great recipe! I made two pans full for a large croud, the first pan I made as written. The second pan my chicken breast was in smaller pieces so I breaded them and fried them then layered the rest of the ingredients in a casserole. Some liked the rolled-up version better, some liked the layered better. (The layered was a lot easier). Either way it was a big hit!

Spectacular recipe!  The trick to this one is using extra large chicken breasts and pounding them to an even 1/2" thickness.  This does take a little time but worth it!  If you do this and roll them tightly no toothpics are necessary to fasten and should not unroll when pan frying them.  This also allows just enough cheese to seap into the sauce and when sliced through gives a perfect spiral of cheese and ham.  Garnish with fresh basil or parsley.  Perfection!  My husband even ate this for breakfast the next day...

I've made this twice so far.  Once as directed and once without the breading, ham and sauce just to see how it would taste.  It was great both ways.  I don't care for chicken breast because it is always just too dry.  This is not!  I will be serving it again at a large dinner reception I have coming up very soon.

I love this recipe! I have changed a couple things. Instead of ham, I use prosciutto. Instead of regular chicken bouillion, I use chicken Herb-ox. My family practically licks the gravy of the plate! Our favorite!

My husband and I really liked this.  This is a wonderful dish to serve to company; it's great and looks like it takes great effort!  The only thing I did differently is to use flour instead of cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  This is a fantastic meal!

Delicious!  Next time I'll try some of the suggestions to lighten it up - definitely too rich to have too often.  I pounded the chicken extra thin- be sure to watch it as it almost got too dry.

Really yummy. After I browned the chicken on the outside I cooked it in the oven for 45 minutes at 350. I would recommend to cut one open or use a meat thermometer to make sure it's cooked all the way through.

I followed the recipe exactly and was very happy with the outcome.  I always like to try every recipe out exactly so I can rate it based on how it is written.  It's funny how some people can change it up and then rate it on that outcome.  Anyway... it was good.  I think next time I'll roll my chicken the best I can after pounding it to about 1/2" thick.  Everyone loved it... it's not easy in my house to find a recipe that every single person loves!!  Dinner came and it was quiet!!  Thanks for sharing!

We loved this dish.  I followed the advise of others - wrapped chicken bundles with silicone bands, used panko crumbs, sauteed the chicken first, then baked in oven.  Made the sauce in the same pan using 1/2 and 1/2.  Yummy!

This recipe was fabulous!  My entire family raved about it and it was extremely delicious.  I cooked it almost exactly as in the recipe.  The only change I made was to fry the chicken in the pan for a few minutes on each side to brown them and then transferred them to the oven to bake.  I then made the sauce in the pan I seared the chicken in.  That way the Atkins folks in the family could just have the chicken.  The chicken came out very tender and the taste was amazing!  The sauce was also to die for.  I was very very pleased by this recipe.

Very good! I only simmered for 20min. since I flattened the chicken some. I rolled the chicken ahead of time and put in the refrigerator, so I was able to take the toothpicks out before cooking. I, like some others used half and half to make it a little healthier. It is a keeper in my house!

These turn out great, my husband requests them at least once a week now.  This is one of his favorite meals and states they are the best he has had. I did follow others suggestions and bake the chicken after browning them in a frying pan, I think it helped to keep some of the cheese inside the chicken.

Amazing recipe! The sauce was divine, and I am planning on using it for other recipes also, with chicken breasts cut into pieces, pork, etc. I used bacon instead of ham. I had it with Spinach infused mashed potatoes from this site as well.

Made trial run on family, huge sucess.  Then had two dinner parties one for 18 and one for 27.  I wrapped cheese in ham slice and then rolled and tied breast.  If the breast was too small to roll, I just added a piece of chicken on top of ham.  Doubled and tripled the sauce recipe. followed recipe instructions.  Everyone raved

I have 3 little critics and they absolutly loved it.  They couldn't get enough.  I made 6 large chicken breasts and it wasn't enough for them.  There wasn't a morsel left.  The only thing I did different was cut a slit in the chicken breast and stuffed it.  Will make again and again and again, Thanks!!

Phenomenal!! This dish made me feel like a rockstar cook!  It's very heavy, so not an everyday dish, but very suitable for entertaining or special occassions. THANK YOU!!

Awesome!  This will be a family favorite.  Additionally, I flattended the chicken breasts with a mallet, which makes the chicken a bit sticky and works to your advantage.  I also prepared the chicken rolls 2 hrs prior to cooking and refigerated.  This method allowed me to remove the toothpicks prior to coating with flour mixture.  I added one toothpick back to the middle and removed it during cooking.  The chicken browns beautifully and the accompanying sauce is just devine.

Incredible! I'd give it six stars if I could! We used prosciutto instead of ham and used half olive oil and half butter instead of butter alone.

This recipe is awesome!  I suggest as others have to fry it for about 10 mins then put it in the oven at 350 degrees and bake for about 25 minutes until cook all the way through.  

Also when selecting chicken breasts I suggest getting it from the deli and choose the biggest ones possible it'll be easier to stuff more and to put toothpicks in it.  Defiantly will be making this again!

This recipe turned out good, and was pretty easy.  I did modify it somewhat.  I cut a slit in the the chicken breasts to stuff them.  I used Prosciutto for the ham because it was super flaverful even in a thin slice.  I made the sauce seperate simmering for aprox. 10 min.  The chicken breasts were seasoned with salt and pepper, floured, egged, and breaded.  Fried till out side was crispy and then baked at 350 to finish them off.  I refregerated the chicken breasts after I fried them for a couple of hours before baking, so I got them messy process of breading/frying them done before my guests arrived and that seemed to work fine, and let me have a clean more orderly kitchen to cook it with people over.

WOW.... This is delicious my only complaint is that I love the sauce so much that there was not enough for my rice :) Now when I fix this recipe I flatten & butterfly the chicken breast (the toothpick method did not work out to well for me & I like for some cheese to seep out which helps create the sauce) to remedy my craving for the sauce I use 1 cup of broth & 2 tsp of chicken granules & 2 cups of creame cook time is anywhere from 50 to 60 min give or take a few. 

***Also note that if you do not have an white wine on hand chicken broth works just as well

So quick and so easy!  I will be adding this to the rotation a lot!  I breaced the rolled chicken as well instead of just sprinkling on the bread crumbs.  I also used others' suggestions and added a little butter on top before cooking.  It came out perfect and tasted like I fussed!

Awesome recipe.  The only thing I changed was I used Italian seasoned breadcrumbs instead of flour, and I also used a little more corn starch to thicken up the sauce.  It turned out looking and tasting great.  I served it over a bed of rice.

I made this for dinner and we really enjoyed it!.  It was easy to make.  I followed some suggestions of others and doubled the sauce.  I also used the half butter/half olive oil to fry the chicken.  It was perfect!  I did take the chicken out of the pan and added all the ingredients for the sauce and simmer. Once the chicken was in the oven (350) I pour the sauce over it. I added some mozzarella cheese I had on hand and added some plain bread crumbs on top and broiled after it cooked for 10-15 mins.  I served with white rice and salad.  the white wine sauce was awesome!!!  Thanks for this recipe.  I will make again.

Wow.  This was incredible!  I didn't have toothpicks so used a  little yarn to tie up the breasts before frying.  I also used half and half and flour to get a thick sauce (I didn't have cream or corn starch) and put it in the frying pan that the chicken had just come out of so it melded really nice with the leftover juice and cheese in the pan.  OMG, it was so freakin' good!  I heated the sauce for about a total of 15 minutes, stirring every 5 minutes or so.  I've never been a big fan of chicken cordon bleu, but this has changed my mind forever!

Surprisingly, my teen and guest rated this a 3 and a half. DH and I thought it was moist, had a great creamy flavor, and was deserving of a 5 star. I added some spices to the chicken before rolling up (McCormack's chicken seasoning)and I finished cooking,(after browning) in the oven. Could easily be a dish for company... except I think you need to cut into thick slices for better presentation. I served with Jamie's Cranberry Spinach Salad & cheese Peirogis. Great dinner! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I found this recipe after my cousin requested chicken cordon bleu for his birthday dinner.  It was delicious!  My husband who isn't a fan of "ham and chicken together" loved it.  After it simmered for 15 minutes, the chicken was done.  I didn't see the need to cook it longer.  The sauce put this into the five stars catagory.  It made a good recipe great.  If you're intimidated by difficult recipes, this is a good place to start and would be impressive for company.

Not that anyone needs another review; this receipe already has 1,000 or so. Anyway, this receipe is awesome. I took a reviewers idea and added dijon mustard to the inside of the chicken roll...awesome!  I also doubled the sauce (we're saucy people). Serve over mashed potatoes....yum!!

Wow!  What a great recipe!  I used chicken broth instead of the white wine.  We loved this dish and can't wait to make it again!

Excellent! The only change I made was to increase the wine, cream & cornstarch to make extra sauce in which I melted shredded swiss cheese & tossed with linguine. Easy to make & very tasty!

FANTABULOUS!  ='D This was ABSOLUTELY delicious. I added fresh spinach to the filling!!and then when it came to the heavy cream finish.. I added 4 slices of swiss to the cream and it melted right in and gave the sauce a creamy swiss flavor... Do NOT pass this recipe up! * Highly reccommend this one!

Fabulous recipe.  My family loved it.  The only thing I did differently, was add sliced portobella mushrooms to the sauce.  Easy, fast, delicious.

Do not make this recipe unless you want the people you make it for to hound you to make it again and again.  That aside, it is really easy and very delish.

By far the best Chicken Cordon Bleu that I have ever made or tasted!  I paired it with asparagus with a nice cheese sauce and a baked potato and it made for a great "Romantic" dinner that made me look like a gourmet chef!  LOL  Thanks!!!

I followed this recipe exactly and it came out great.  My husband's only request was that it have more swiss cheese next time.  Eventhough I tried to close up the rolls with toothpicks, a lot cheese melted out during cooking.

This is great! It is fairly easy to make. The finished product presented well and tasted superb. The sauce is fabulous!  I used deli provolone cheese and smoked ham, butcher's string to bind the stuffed breasts, plain bread crumbs instead of flour, pinot grigio wine and finished in the oven at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes. The day after I am still getting raves. Definitely will make this again!

I browned the chicken in the skillet on each side.  The I put the chicken in the oven at 350 for 35 min.  In the same skillet I added cream of chicken soup, salt, pepper, wine and made the gravy.

phenomenal recipe!! A word of advice to everyone: don't make the mistake of using colored toothpicks because they leave a little color in every spot where they  touch the chicken. 

Aside from my minor glitch it was a wonderful recipe to the T !

This is excellent! My husband and kids loved it and they can be picky if dinner's not meat and potatos. I wasn't sure about the sauce - but it just made the dish!   We'll definately make this again.

Very, very good!!!!!  Next time though I will not bake chicken in the oven as some others suggested.  Made mine a little too dry.  No doubt, the sauce is awesome!  Will keep this one in the file for future use.

First let me say this is absolutely delicious!  The only change I made was to use bread crumbs in place of the flour. I also have these cooking rubber band thingies that I'd picked up last Thanksgiving that I used in place of the toothpicks.  That kept the breasts together, but not so tight it was restricting in any way.  Now, this sounds like a pretty intimidating meal that I kept wanting to try but was nervous I'd mess it up but it was actually VERY simple to follow and it came out great.  I'm so proud, it was like a gourmet supper!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe that I'm sure I'll use over and over.

I "butterflied" the breasts before I pounded them - more uniform and takes less time.  I also made a basic parmesan cheese sauce to serve with it just to be a bit different - similar to an alfredo sauce - just drizzled it around the base of the chicken which I had carefully sliced on the diagonal before serving.  Pretty presentation and really yummy!

The best I have ever had anywhere!  I only used 4 pieces of chicken but left the liquids the same so I had plenty of sauce.  It was outstanding and I would not change anything!

This was so, so, so yummy!  My husband is a very picky eater and I usually get the "it's okay" when I make a new recipe.  But, for this one he actually said he liked it A LOT.  Thank you for the awesome recipe...it's going in the old recipe book :)

I followed another user's advice and patted some garlic powder and pepper to the chicken breast before frying.  Definitely needs an extra punch of spice if you enjoy a lot of flavor.  I will make this again...very good!

I'd give it a 4 because this is a really easy, fairly tasty meal, but I'm also going to subtract a star because...I found everything to my liking EXCEPT the chicken.   The chicken itself seemed so bland compared to the sauce...not the best way to prep chicken IMHO.  Still pretty good though.

Very yummy. A little bit of a pain to manipulate the toothpicks so everything holds together, but worth the trouble.  The sauce is awesome.  Big hit with my entire family.

Fabulous recipe! I took one reviewer's advice and added olive oil to the butter to fry the chicken in- glad I did otherwise I think that the butter would've burnt a little and the chicken would have stuck to the pan. The final sauce with heavy whipping cream and cornstarch (added to the original sauce) never thickened (even with increased cornstarch) but I suspect that was due to the increased butter and olive oil I originally used. Regardless, the recipe made for a delicious meal. Thanks for sharing and bon apetit!

This is so delicious!  I make it with pasta because the sauce is so amazing.  I also double the sauce so that there is enough to cover the pasta.

What a delicious recipe! I browned the chicken in the olive oil/butter combination and since I didn't have any white wine, I used chicken broth. It was wonderful. I served it with mashed potatoes and my husband and son loved it. I will add more ham next time (at my husband's suggestion) because this one is a keeper!

Awesome recipe!!! My whole family ate until I thought everyone was going to explode  :)  I served this with green peas, wild rice mix and a green salad, and it rivaled any restaurant meal we've ever had.  I did pound out the chicken breasts first and added a little extra ham, cheese, and wine. Thanks for a super recipe!!

This was fun to make! I made a meal this for my mother on Mother's Day and she said it was the best meal she's ever had! I was hestitant to fry the chicken and thought about baking instead, but I didn't and it turned out perfectly, the directions are easy to follow and the results are excellent.  My sauce was "cheesy" because I think most of the Swiss cheese melted away, and I used color toothpicks which was a big mistake since the color bled into the chicken, so be sure to use plain toothpicks.

The key is to pound the chicken breasts very thin.  This makes them easier to work with.  Definitely one of my top meals to make for company!

Excellent!  However, I made the mistake of getting flavored ham from the deli, and it was a little too strong of a taste.  Next time I will get plain ham slices.  This is perfect with mashed potatoes.

Absolutely delish! I used provolone cheese instead and used dried spaghetti to secure the sides as another person suggested...it worked beautifully and I didn't have to worry about digging around trying to take tooth picks out.  What a great idea, thanks for that!  And thank you for the great recipe!

This was wonderful. I made them in the oven instead.  (375 degrees for 3 min.) Just wrap the chicken, hold them together with one long screwer place them in a non-stick pan and pour melted butter over them plus white wine with one chicken boullion cube mixed into the wine. It was great! Thanks

"Perfect" The sauce was wonderful. My wife added a little red wine vinegar against my will but added the perfect touch to an already scrumptious meal. Thanks.

Uh-maz-ing.  Now if only I could eat it without thinking about how fattening it is!  Save this one for when you have to impress someone with your cooking skills.  It's worth the calorie splurge every now and then.

DELICIOUS...this will definitely be added to my repertoire the only thing i substituted was mozzarella for swiss. This is actually a very quick and easy recipe.  Oh and yes, definitely make twice as much sauce then whats in the recipe its good to drizzle over rice/pasta and great for next day leftovers.

Yum Yum Yum!  This was fabulous.  Only changes I made were: 1. added a couple minced cloves of garlic to the butter that I browned the breasts in and 2. sprinkled the paprika directly onto the chicken instead of adding it to the flour.  The flavors were delightful.  Served with asparagus and it was a rich and tasty meal. My husband was talking about how good it was the rest of the evening.  Would definitely serve to company.

I used a combination of other peoples additions for my try at making this.. I used 1/2 the butter and olive oil for the other half. I also breaded the chicken with egg and bread crumbs instead of flour. I followed the suggestion of browning it first, then baking for 20 minutes at 350, and making the sauce separate.. I added the chicken back to the sauce along with its juice from baking it for the last 3 minutes or so.. I also doubled the sauce recipe as most have said to do. Came out perfect!

This is absolutely wonderful!  I have never had Chicken Cordon Bleu before so I wanted to make sure I picked a recipe with high ratings, and this did not let down!  The chicken tasted wonderful and that sauce was incredible...I couldn't get enough!  I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a delicious recipe!

This is a very good recipe. I used Black Forest Ham and Swiss, but didn't stuff the chicken breasts as instructed in the recipe. Instead, I simply added the ham and cheese on top and melted it during the last few minutes of cooking. It's a lot easier, saves time, and still tastes delicious. Then I added the sauce on top when the cheese was melted. Thanks for this recipe!

Perhaps I should have read the reviews prior to making this. The sauce tasted great. The chicken itself tasted a little bland. I would season it with salt, garlic powder and black pepper next time and maybe use higher quality Swiss cheese, and the bread crumbs as other suggested. It was good but it could be even better.

Delicious and easy to make. Will definitely make again. I used the reviewers suggestion of chicken stock in place of wine and it tasted delicious. LOL, just don't use "colored" toothpicks or you'll end up with blue and red and yellow dyed chicken cordon bleu (although it'll still taste good!)  :)

This was great!  I made a simplified version by using chicken leg quarters in place of the traditional cordon bleu rolls, and adding the swiss cheese directly to the sauce.  Super easy!  No ham, but I didn't even miss it.  I also tried another variation using pork chops in place of chicken and adding 1/2 tsp. garlic powder in place of 1/2 the paprika.  It was just as fabulous!  My husband could not decide which one he liked best!  This one is DEFINITELY a keeper!

WOW this was sooooooo good! Instead of the flour, I used bread crumbs, then browned the chicken in the butter...then i put the chicken in a separate pan into the oven (cause i thought if it cooked in the sauce it would get too soggy) meanwhile in the pan i browned the chicken in, I made the sauce and added a little bit of grated Parmesan cheese (which made it even better)....then when the chicken was done I took it out and poured the sauce over it. It was still a little crispy from the bread crumbs and the sauce was just DELICIOUS!!!! This is one of my favorites I've tried on this website. Definitely give this recipe a try you WILL NOT be disappointed. Thanks!!

I loved this recipe! A little more work required, but really good and worth it!  I omitted the whine and substituted with chicken broth. I loved the sauce, but hubby did not. So next time I will serve the sauce separately. He also would like me to put a piece of cheese on top of the chicken as well; and would like to try bacon wrapped in with the ham and cheese for the center filling. Great recipe!

OMGOODNESS!!! This was even better the second time. I used Conundrum 2006 California Table Wine from Krogers to make this dish. Not sure if its a dry white wine but it came out delicious.

I made this for dinner last night and i loved it! so did my partner. I found this only made enough sauce for about 3 chicken breasts so if you like lots of sauce i would suggest making more. My partner put this on the fish he was eating and said it tasted great with that too. The only change i made to this sauce was to add some cooked chopped bacon when i was adding the cream. It tasted great!

This was so yummy! I was telling everyone about it the next day. The only reason why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that I thought the flour/paparika was boring with this recipe. Next time I will use others suggestions by using italian breadcrumbs instead to coat it!  I did use the suggestion by someone else to put the Swiss cheese between two slices of ham then rolling it up and then putting it in the chicken and folding the chicken over and no cheese melted outside of the chicken. I will be making this all the time now!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

This was very good recipe. As some people suggested, I also used a bread crumb coating as opposed to the flour. I pounded out the chicken to about a 1/2 inch thickness. Browned the chicken in a skillet and then put it into the oven. I did not care much for the sauce (I don't like the wine taste), but my husband enjoyed it.  Also my 2 yr old daughter ate some of the chicken, and she is a very picky eater! Next time I will leave out the wine and try chicken broth.

This recipe is excellent!  It deserves closer to 5 stars than 4, but I did make some tweaks along with other reviewers' suggestions.  I only used 3 chicken breasts because they were large (pounded thin) but didn't change the amounts of anything else.  Used no water added Black Forest ham found in the deli and used premium baby Swiss cheese. Ask the deli to taste the ham and cheese to find what you prefer. Rather than use all butter, I used half extra virgin olive oil and half real butter. Followed the cooking directions exactly, and the chicken was so moist and tender, it melted in our mouths!  I added a little garlic salt to mine once plated; just my preference. Served with fresh steamed asparagus and orzo.  he sauce was great over the orzo! Yum!  Thanks for sharing this excellent recipe!

Absolutely fantastic! I recommend using half butter and half olive oil, as well as Pinot Grigio for the dry white wine. Also, I wrapped the cheese inside the ham and then rolling the breasts versus folding them and the cheese did not leak out. I used Kitchen Twine to tie the breasts, and it was very easy to cut the string before I served them.  I made this for my relatives and everyone practically licked their plate clean! This recipe is a must!

I've always been intimidated by the idea of making chicken cordon bleu. But by hammering the meat so it is thinner, it makes it very easy to fill and fold. The sauce in this recipe is delicious. I am currently watching my carbs so I omitted the flour and the cornstarch and it was still spectacular. If you have never tried chicken cordon bleu, or have been too intimidated to make it, try this one.

WOW... this dish is amazing!!!  One of the best chicken dinners I have ever cooked!  The sauce is extremely RICH, so next time I'd serve this with plain sides like rice and steamed broccoli.  The sauce is so amazing!  The only difference I made was using half butter and half olive oil for frying the chicken.  This dish does take a while to make.  Preparing the chicken (pounding, rolling, toothpick-ing and coating) took me about 45 minutes, but they do cook fast in the pan if you've pounded them thin.  You have to try this!!!

Very yummy!  I took the advice from another reviewer and pounded out the chicken a bit thinner and then rolled it up with the ham and cheese inside.  I tied it with cooking string instead of securing it with toothpicks because I am always breaking the toothpicks when I try to use them.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Nice turnout for me.  My family loved the sauce and so did I.  I pounded the chicken down to around 1/2 inch thickness to make it more manageable.  I used a dry California wine which permeated the entire house with the smell of fruits while it was cooking.  I replaced the butter with EVOO, I don't like to cook with butter ever.  With the wine I used a 1/2 cup of chicken broth instead of the granules.  I also did not roll in flour, instead I covered the  breast with egg and then rolled them in bread crumbs. I will definately be using this recipe again.

Okay I only tried this dish because I didn't believe that it was as good as that many people said it was and am I ever glad I did! THe chicken was really tasty but it was the sauce that made this dish. I was dipping every thing in it. I made this recipe EXACTLY as it was written and that is the excat way I will do it again next time (and there will be a next time!!!)

Same as everyone else, excellent.  I followed the recipe for the most part.  The only thing was I didn't realize I didn't have flour for the sauce ...so in go Ritz crackers to thicken it up....delicious.

The perfect, easy recipe. You can't mess this up.  Just make sure you tenderize your chicken and pound it out as flatly as you can so that it fully wraps around the filling and the cheese doesn't drip out and burn.  I never made chicken cordon bleu before this but my boyfriend has requested it several times since we tried this one...and he's hard to please :)

What a great recipe!  Everything goes together very fast and the recipe was perfect!  I tucked my cheese inside the ham and folded the ham over.  My cheese did not melt out like some others mentioned! I also pounded the chicken breast to an even thickness. I made this for a dinner party and my guests just loved it! FANTASTC!!

This was really good.  I also dipped chicken in egg then coated w/ breadcrumbs before frying in pan with a little butter until brown.  I then transferred to oven for 20 min at 350.  I also cooked sauce separately and added 1tsp of Dijon mustard to sauce, I know that is probably not traditional but it gave the sauce a great taste and was an excellent compliment to the dish.  Also, I didn't roll the chicken I just cut the breast to create a "pocket" and stuffed w/ ham and cheese.

This recipe is amazing. I didn't cook the chicken in the sauce as the recipes calls for. Instead, I rolled the chicken, dipped in eggs, and coated with bread crumbs. Threw them in the oven at 350 for about 15-20 minutes. I then made the sauce in a separate pan and drizzled it over the chicken. They go great with rosemary grilled new potatoes and green beens!

Very tasty, but a bit salty...bread or a vegetable (I like broccoli) to mop up the extra sauce is essential.  I skip the toothpicks, which makes it an extremely easy recipe.

Absolutely the best recipe I've made in months!!  My husband took out boneless, skinless thighs instead of the breasts and they were sooo good.  I used deli sliced black forest ham, shredded swiss cheese and white zin for the wine.  I followed the exact directions and it turned out fantastic!  My husband perfers rice & I like mashed taters better so I fixed both.  He loved the sauce on his rice, and I loved it on my mashed taters.  Thank you for a great recipe, easy and elegant! *** Update 11/15/12 - Made this again and it was so delicious with a baked sweet potato.  I used the chicken breasts pounded thin to make it this time with slices of ham and slices of cheese.  Excellent recipe.  I need to make it more often :)  Oh, I did use 1/2 & 1/2 this time and it worked perfect.

Incredibly good!  One warning--don't over-stir the cream sauce, as it will start to clump and separate from the oil (will still taste good, though!).

This recipe is the best I have ever used from allrecipes!  I have made it a few times now and when I don't have white wine handing...I used cooking sherry.  The taste is outrageous!

It is simply delicious and as others have said...it is so easy to make. My husband thought it was store bought! If you are trying this out, you have to make more sauce..it really makes a big difference and you won't regret making more of it!

This is one of my all time favorite recipes.  I usually cut chicken breasts in half and then pound them to get them nice and thin.  I don't make any changes to the recipe and I leave the toothpicks in when I serve them so that the cheese and ham stay within the chicken.  This is a really great recipe.  Not too difficult and great for company!

I could swear I had some ham in the fridge when I started to make this. I was wrong, so I replaced the ham with fresh spinach. It was soooo delish! Very simple to make, so long as you don't mind toothpicking it together. I baked mine, rather than frying it. It was great!

WoW. Cordon Bleu is so much better with a creamy sauce. I reduce the amount of heavy cream a little bit though or use light cream or half and half and thicken up the sauce with cornstarch if necessary.

Delicious. Though I thought the directions were a little unclear that you must put the ham and cheese inside the chicken, it was great nonetheless. I made four with the cheese and ham on top and two with it inside and its good either way. It was GREAT though.

This recipe is amazing! my moms best friends husband made it for all of us for dinner and i fell in love with it... i completely recommed it to anyone... just cook the chicken slowly and slowly turn it to brown each side... dont turn the heat up to high to rush the process it will become gross.

I thought this was just okay. I don't know if I messed up somewhere along the way, or what, but I felt it was lacking a little in flavor. I'll probably make this again, but tweek it a little, adding in some more seasonings-especially to the sauce.

The recipe sat very heavy on our stomach because the sauce is very rich.  I think there are better recipes that require less cooking and preparation time and are healthier.

Oh my!!! This is a wonderful delicious recipe. 6yo DS won't touch it but DH and myself love it. I didn't tusk the chicken, so the cheese melted into the sauce. As a working mom, I like that I can prepare most of the recipe a night before and the next day after work, I can set the chicken to simmer while supervising the kid's bath and when the kids are finished, dinner is ready!

This was a fantastic meal as written. I enjoyed it thoroughly and then made changes like most cooks will do. My changes made this recipe a bit more expensive, but wow. I added a slice of prosciutto inside the chicken with the cheese and ham. I made a slit into the side of the chicken and butterflied it open, then pounded it thin with a meat pounder. To the flour/paprika mixture I added some grated Parmigiano Reggiano.  After filling the chicken and toothpicking it shut, I dipped it in egg whites and then the flour/paprika/Parm. Reg. I would not recommend changing the method of making the sauce as others have. Using wine was perfect and if you don't slowly cook the chicken in the pan that the sauce will be in, all of those wonderful chicken drippings (not to mention any melted cheese that might slip out) will be missing from the sauce. Thank you so much for this amazing recipe.

I love this recipe, it’s a regular on our menu.  Looks so fancy & tastes so delicious, while relatively simple to make.  I always serve with a side of asparagus topped with some of the extra sauce from the chicken.

Overall I found this recipe too rich, but tasty.  One piece of advice though, I bought an expensive smoky ham.  On its own, the ham is delicious - but I found in this recipe the smoky flavour overpowered the chicken.  Also, found this better the next day heated up as leftovers - the flavours blended a little better.

My family loved it!  I made it while my dad was out of town, but my mom insisted I make for him once he gets back-she said this after taking one bite!  The only thing I altered was the bullion and the coating - I omitted the bullion as my family does not make anything with bullion. To the coating, I added some grated Parmesan cheese.  Be aware, if you choose to try this that the cheese does brown almost right away.

The dish was perfect! We loved it!  And, it really did only take 30 minutes to cook!  amazing!

Mixed reviews.  

Didn't really wow anyone, which was a big disappointment since it took a while to make.

I am not going to give up on it though...I think I just need to tweak it a bit!

Like several others have said, the chicken was OK, but the sauce was DELICIOUS.  I felt as though the sauce over-powered the flavor of the chicken.  I couldn't even really tell that I had gone through the trouble of putting cheese and ham inside the chicken because all I could taste was the sauce.  Most of the cheese melted out of the chicken anyway.

This recipe is EXCELLENT!  I've made it several times--it's so easy and it comes out great every time, even with minute variations.  This last time I ran out of white wine so I used 1/2 sherry cooking wine and 1/2 white wine and it still tasted great.  I made it for a dinner party and it was a huge hit- especially the sauce.  I actually like when the cheese melts out into the sauce which didn't happen last time, but it was still great.  I topped with freshly grated romano cheese and served with roasted asparagus and wild rice.  mmmmmmm.

This was quite an excellent meal the first time that I cooked it, and it only continues to get better every time that I make it. The cheese melts into the wine sauce, but enough of it remains on the chicken so that the flavor remains. The only change that I made was I put in 150% of the wine that the recipe called for. I used a pinot grigio. I reccomend very highly.

Loved it! I have become a fan of butterflying chicken breasts and using the increased surface area to infuse whatever flavors I'm attempting into all of the meat. I applied this theory to this recipe. I butterflied the breasts and slipped a rolled up ham slice into the breast, flixed in place with the toothpick. I browned them in half butter/ half olive oil with a tbl of minced garlic. I made sure that everything got good and brown so that my sauce had great color and flavor. The ham inside the chicken really made a great recipe greater. Thanks for this. Fine cuisine is less intimidating!

I followed other suggestions, brushed chicken with egg,coated in lots of breadcrumbs with paprika, browned it in olive oil and crushed garlic, then popped it in the oven. It was perfect!! I did the sauce separately in the pan, I added basil and plenty of parsley, it was good but too salty as I used a cooking wine...these have salt added. The kids loved it.

The taste is well worth 5 stars, but very time consuming to assemble. I had a problem with cheese running out- make sure they are assembled well. I don't think I'll bother again.

I concur with the over six hundred reviewers to say that this recipe goes in my recipe box!  The only substitution I made was to use fat-free half and half instead of the cream. My husband and I repeatedly commented on how great it was during dinner!

I've never made Chicken Cordon Bleu but this recipe was simple to follow. I didn't have wine on hand so like others I just used Chicken broth. Wasn't sure how to put toothpicks in, but what I did worked out. The sauce was really good and flavorful. I made my chicken pretty thin and only had to cook it for about 20 minutes. Delicious!

We are having problems getting my 2yr old to eat, he is picky like my  husband and 5yr old daughter. He eats absolutely nothing but pizza and chicken nuggets. He devoured this, as did the rest of the family. A definite winner. I didn't have to alter or add anything.

Really excellent! I made this for 2 different groups of people and had nothing but compliments! Also, I don't eat pork, so I left it out of a few and added extra cheese instead... Mmmm Mmmmmmm!

This recipe is a keeper. It came out perfect the very first time I made it. My husband and I loved it. I will make this again and again. There was a very generous amount of gravy to ladle over the meat. Thanks for a really good recipe.

Delicious!  I always have difficulty keeping the cheese inside the chicken and this time was no different.  The cheese melted out into the sauce but it turned out just divine!  I will definitely make this one again.

This was a great recipe.  I used boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts, and that worked well.  I also substituted chicken broth for the wine, since I didn't have any.  The only thing that I would change next time is to add a bit of salt and pepper to the sauce and maybe some garlic.  This is a very nice recipe to make for guests, although it took me a while to prepare.  The sauce was also great on our rice and asparagus, instead of plain butter.

I'm not a huge fan of swiss in the first place, so I think that is why I wasn't overly impressed with this meal.  I thought it was good - however I think my swiss was too sharp or something becuase the sauce only tasted like swiss cheese, no other flavors came out of it and it kind of overpowered.  Other than that - easy to make with the thin cut breasts from the grocery store, and nice presentation.

Absolutely Excellent.  I made this for Thanksgiving dinner at my in-laws, it got rave reviews!  I never realized Chicken Cordon Bleu could be so easy.  Believe it or not, the store was out of regular chicken breasts!  So I bought the tenderloins, laid one out and put the filling on, then laid another on top.    Then added the toothpicks.  Excellent.

I tried this because of such good reviews and they were definately right!  I loved how this turned out!  I only changed from swiss to muenster cheese only because I don't like swiss, other than that, I followed the same recipe and added salt, pepper, and some spices.  The sauce turned out so flavorful and it rivaled a gourmet restaurant dish!  Thanks!!

This recipe is absolutely delicious!  I always thought Chicken Cordon Bleu was hard & time consuming.  Not this one - it doesn't get much easier!  The cream sauce is key to the final flavor & I serve w/white rice and pour the sauce over it as well.

I made the following changes per ingredients that I had on hand.  I used 2% milk (not cream) and I used an ale beer (not wine). Also, I used jack cheese (not swiss).  The sauce reminded me of fondue.  I will make again per these changes.  We loved it.

My family didn't want this but after I made it they LOVED it.  It's one of their favorites now!  I substituted Mozzarela for swiss and it was still fantastic.  Sauce is to die for and the meat was very tender.

Scaled this recipe to 4 and cooked it exactly as the recipe stated.  Both my husband and I loved it!  We made it with rice pilaf and Italian Green Beans (from this website.)  Great 5-star dinner.

My husband and 6 year old son both gave this a two thumbs up--a definite keeper! I added salt & Pepper as I do with everything, used shredded swiss cheese and Hillshire farm deli Select ultra thin honey ham, which my husband said gave it a nice smokey flavor.  I also did as others suggested and used some olive oil with the butter. Used double the wine called for and double the cream, then added more butter (talk about rich!) at the end.  Next time,I might try adding some garlic and or whisking some dijon mustard to the sauce at the end to give it a little more punch.  Personally, I like more flavor in sauces, but I was outvoted.  really yummy, thanks for the recipe!

I made this before Thanksgiving and we didn't really care much for the sauce.  Made this again last night with 2 slices each of prosciutto instead of ham, I seasoned my Chicken with a Chicken spice mixture, assembled, placed in a sprayed baking dish along with butter and wine.  The butter and wine with the drippings made a great juice to drizzle over the chicken and we didn't even miss not having a sauce.  I baked at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes but of course cooking time would depend on the size and thickness you pound the breast.

This recipe is FABULOUS!  I served this for New Year's Eve (a formal dinner) and all 6 of us just LOVED it.  The cream sauce really made the meal.  My husband rarely goes back for second helpings but this time he did without reservation.  And, the meal was impressive to serve as well.  I accompanied the chicken with homemade garlic mashed potatoes and some fresh, seasoned green beans.  I pulled out my formal china, served the green beans in a separate dish and served the chicken on a platter surrounded by the garlic mashed potatoes.  This was a great trick because the potatoes kept the sauce on the platter, while at the same time, the potatoes absorbed some of the sauce - hhmmmmmm...YUMMY!!!  This was a hearty, yet SCRUMPTIOUS meal!  Thank you for the recipe!  This is now a family favorite!

This was sooo good and not to much trouble.  When I make it again, I will pound the chicken breasts really thin since it's hard to keep together if you don't.  Also, i used jack cheese because i was out of provolone.  This is not too hard to make and the presentation is wonderful.  It looks like more effort than it really is.

Absolutely delicious!  The chicken was so tender and juicy.  And, that sauce!  Absolutely amazing.  Not for the health conscious though.  You don't even miss the breading of traditional cordon bleu.  It seems like a lot of butter at first, but the chicken really absorbes it all, and makes it extra delicious!  I will make this again, and again and again!

This recipe was fantastic.  I sized the portion down for just the two of us and it got nothing short of a rave review.  Tastes better than some restaurant recipes I've had out.  The next time I entertain for dinner, I'm making this.

This was AMAZING!!! Only thing I would suggest, mainly to newer cooks, make sure to turn down the heat before adding the wine or it will dry up and you won't have the juice! Just a forewarning! I didnt change a thing and it was great!

UNBELIEVABLE! 10 Stars!!!I haven't even cleaned the kitchen yet because I had to rate this recipe! My 5 yr old son ate it up and my husband loved it! A TRUE KEEPER!!! The only change I made was added a little feta cheese in the rolls and a few Tablespoons of olive oil while cooking... I can't wait to make it again!!!

I make this one all the time at the firehouse and it gets devoured.  The only difference is I layer the ham and cheese instead of rolling it in the chicken breast.  I can't ever seem to get it to stay together rolled and I lose track of the toothpicks trying to keep it rolled.

This recipe is superb! I made this for the first time and we loved it! I made a couple of changes to make it a little more diet friendly. I used just 3 tbls of butter instead of 6 and I use lowfat milk instead of the whipping cream. The sauce was awesome and very flavorful and thick. I will make again!!

I've never made Chicken Cordon Bleu before, so I was a little intimidated by the whole idea.  This recipe, however, is easy, and DELICIOUS!!  I recommend it to anyone!  I didn't have any chicken bouillion granules, so I used canned chicken stock.  Still a wonderful dish!

My husband and I love, love, love this recipe and would eat it all the time if it were just a bit healthier.  So we have it on occation but it is always something to look forward to. The gravy over the chicken is super.  I usually double it to pour over noodles. Absolutely grand!!!

This was excellent. The chicken was moist and flavorful. I added 1 cup of chicken broth for the bouillon and used the sauce as a gravy to pour over the chicken and pototo filling. UMMMM Good!

This is truly a great recipe.  We made it a while ago when we had company over for dinner, we served it with the roasted vegetables also found on this site as well as white rice.  It is a show stopper!

Hard to go wrong with cordon bleu...the ingredients are just too good.  This one adds a sauce that is very good.  We doubled the cheese and ham and served it with rice.  We also only had 4 breasts which meant we had plenty of extra sauce for the rice.  I am not good at folding chicken too keep everything in (set a record for tooth picks) but it all turned out very good and was fun to make.

This recipe is awesome! I made this last night for my family and it was a BIG hit! The sauce is to die for and I would recommend doubling the recipe if you are like my family and like to add sauce over your sides and veggies. For sides I made garlic smashed potatoes and steamed asparagus. A definite will make again recipe!

Absolutely wonderful. Best chicken cordon bleu I've ever had. I think the sauce would work in many ways. Next time I might try it on pork tenderloin. Also, I might add some shallots and baby bella mushrooms.

You could halve the sauce and it would be enough.  Absolutely fabulous-tasting, and sooo easy!  I used to make this for hubby when we were first married, as we couldn't afford to eat out, and this is an "eat out" recipe.  Now we have four kids and still can't afford to eat out.  Hadn't made it since before children, and I must say, even the kids LOVED this!

Simple, elegant, and delicious!  I made this for a Sunday dinner for my husband and I, but it's good enough to entertain with.  I used salt, white pepper, and paprika in the flour mix, and added a little chicken broth to the wine for saute.  More white pepper and salt in the finished white sauce, which was to die for!  Plated over jazmine rice with peas and carrots and a sprinkle of paprika for color.  Sincere thanks for sharing, it's a keeper!

This was very good - I just wish someone could tell me the trick to getting the toothpicks out!  I served the meal with a disclaimer, that my guests needed to take small bites in case I missed one!
Here is what I altered - I browned the rolls in 1/2 butter 1/2 olive oil - to prevent the butter from burning. I used a combo of breadcrumbs and crushed butter crackers - I would have used all breadcrumbs but I had some crushed crackers leftover from something else I was doing. When rolling the breast I put the ham down first then the cheese in an effort to contain the cheese so it wouldn't ooze out (some still did, but it added to the flavor of the sauce)  I will for sure make this again, might try something other then those blasted toothpicks though!

The chicken was great.  The sauce was a little too heavy for my liking.  Next time, I may find a way to lighten it up maybe with milk and some cream.  Not a difficult dish to prepare, quick too.

This recipe is fantastic and simple to make.  I've tried the other recipes with the soup in them and they don't hold a candle to good old fashion heavy cream.  This is a fabulous showpiece as is.  Thank you for sharing.

Everyone really liked this. It was really easy to make. The sauce was what really made this so good. I did not double the sauce and it was just the right amount. My family ate this over white rice. If you like chicken cordon bleu you really need to try this.

Wow!  I have tried making chicken cordon bleu for my husband every so often for a few years and he has never completely liked any of the recipes.  He LOVED this one.  I really think the prosciutto made a big difference (I usually use regular baked ham).  I did double the sauce.  The sauce was wonderful although I did doctor it as it was simmering.  I added a little more wine as well as some garlic salt and pepper to taste.  The chicken came out very tender and the sauce was delicious.  I will definately make this again!

The flavour is wonderful - kinda nutty tasting. Double the sauce recipe - you'll need it. One thing I didn't do and should have is pour off the excess butter after browning the chicken and before I made the sauce. I did like someone else suggested and brushed the stuffed chicken with butter then rolled in flour mixture and let sit for about an hour - then fried. Makes a nice coating. This is by far the best cordon bleu I have ever had - even in fancy restaurants. Thank you for the recipe.

Okay, Chef I am not.  This recipe gave me respect in my house!  lol.  AMAZING!  I followed some suggestions.  I coated the chicken in the morning with the butter, dredged it in flour and paprika.  I had no string so I had to use toothpicks.  The chicken set all day and when I fried it first, I removed the toothpicks.  I didnt even need them when I put it in the oven.  As everyone else says, DOUBLE the sauce recipe!  You will NOT be sorry!  The sauce is what made the meal.  I didnt have any cornstarch and just used flour to thicken it.  I used provolone cheese and tavern ham from the deli.  It was an amazing meal!  I served with plain white rice and what a hit it was!  Don't pass this recipe by....

A perfect dish to serve up for company--it's beautiful and elegant too--looks like a lot more work than it is.  I rolled up the chicken in the morning and stuck it in the fridge until later (I used about a dozen toothpicks in each roll which had to be extracted with pliers after cooking--but at least none of the cheese leaked out!) I followed the recipe exactly and just have one minor change I will make next time: the sauce was just a tad rich and I'm not big on wine flavor so I think I'll cut back on the wine and use 1/2 and 1/2 as some of the other reviewers have suggested. Other than that this was just great--thanks Behr!

I was a little worried about how the wine would mesh with the dairy, but this recipe was wonderful.  My husband was so impressed.  If you sprinkle a little paprika on top, it makes a nice presentation!

OMG - this is the BEST chicken cordon bleu recipe I have ever tasted - super simple to make - only made one adjustment, I used proscuito instead of the ham - yummy - the wine sauce is to die for.  I wish I could rate this recipe more stars - this recipe is definatley a keeper!

This was amazing, but I modified it just a bit. I added a diced red bell pepper to the simmering chicken, used marsala wine, and served it over bow tie pasta. Also, I cut the butter down by a tablespoon and I think it helped to make it less oily after whisking in the cream/cornstarch. This recipe is easy to put together and yields great results.

Awesome!  I served this dish tonight to company and everyone raved! I loved the idea of folding over the pounded chicken breasts rather than rolling them...it was easier to secure with toothpicks (than rolls), and the chicken cooked more evenly.  I used lite swiss cheese, and proscuitto ham.  In the sauce, I substituted 1/2 & 1/2 (instead of whipping cream) b/c that's what I had on hand, and chose Marsala for the wine, and it was excellent.  I served this with this site's Roasted Vegetables, and Warm Spinach Salad and french bread.  Thanks to Allrecipes.com, I even impress myself lately!  This site rocks!

My family loves this.  It is quite fattening so I don't make it often.  I use to buy the ones in the deli counter at the  supermarket but this is so much better.  When I make it the cheese always runs out a little but that is ok.  It adds a great flavor to the sauce.  I serve it with rice pilaf which tastes great with the sauce.

This recipe will make you look like a genius in the kitchen. I make extra sauce because otherwise we're fighting over who gets more than the other. This dish goes very well with garlic roasted potatoes and asparagus tips.

*****Excellent! My kids ask me to make this all the time. The sauce is delicious however I just used whole milk instead of whipping cream. Preparing this is a bit time consuming but certainly worth it!*****

I am not a big fan of swiss cheese, so this rating is from the husband.  The cheese did melt rather quickly while the chicken was still raw...leaving lots of cheese in the pan.  He also wasn't a big fan of the sauce.  I will make again, but no sauce next time.  Thanks for the post.

Fantastic!!!..My hubby raved about this recipe for 2 days!!!...It was hard for me to cook all the chicken in pan so After browning the chicken rolls I placed them in an oven dish. Then finished making the sauce. I poured the sauce over the chicken and baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 mins...came out wonderfully tender.

Unbelievable how easy this was to prepare and how pretty it looked when finished!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I didnt have regular white wine, so I used plain ole cooking wine, I also doubled the recipe, which is also easy to do, because I always have to with three teenage boys, but they were full after one, which I served with brussel sprouts and noodles alfredo from this site.  And yes, the sauce is out of this world!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This is a great dish even my husband liked it and he doesn't like anything "fancy".  I took the advise of others and used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter to brown the chicken and it worked great.  I also made extra sauce.  The only slight change I might make is next time think I will use regular milk instead of heavy whipping cream.  The sauce was a bit too rich for me but it didn't stop anyone from finshing every last drop.  I will make this one over and over!

Incredible! I was skeptical of all those good things said about the sauce and had to make this recipe; believe ME, all of them were true. It was delicious! I had tried a lot the chicken with ham and cheese, so I followed someone’s advice and filled them with pesto and mozzarella cheese. The pesto gave the sauce and extra kick!  Just to impress my family, I spread the sauce over the serving dish, cut the breast rolls with an electric knife ( ½ inch each) and placed them over the sauce, then sprinkled some fresh chopped basil over the chicken. Everyone loved the meal. Thank you!

I made this for my Recipe Club and it was a huge hit. I had never tasted Chicken Cordon Bleu before,what a first taste to have!!! EXCELLANT!  My friends said "Great for Company"  The ONLY thing I did differently is I used a Reisling Wine which is sweet, instead of the dry wine (I had this on hand)I will make this TIME AND TIME AGAIN!!!

Pretty yummy, quick & easy! I used chicken broth instead of granules & let the wine & broth simmer together in an uncovered pan to reduce the sauce for a good flavor. Takes about 15 or 20 minutes, but worth the effort in flavor. I doubled the amount of wine & 1 can (14oz.) chicken broth.  This makes plenty of sauce. Even though I made adjustments, all in all a good recipe.

This was delicious!  My husband, kids (15 & 12 yrs. old)loved it.  I'm usually leary when a recipe is easy that it will taste bland but this was great.  Very flavorful and the sauce goes well over rice.  We all agree it's a keeper!  Thank you Behr.

I thought this was pretty good, my family really loved it.  I thought the sauce needed something but I couldn't figure out exactly what.

My sister and her husband came up for the weekend and this is what I made, she took the recipe home with her after many rave reviews.  This chicken cordon bleu was absolutely the best that I have ever tasted, I would not change one thing.   The only thing that I wish is that there had been left overs!

I have made this recipe several times..each time it is delicious! The only thing I wanted to change was the prep time...so I cut up the chicken and ham into bit size pieces and added the Swiss to the cream sauce...mixed chicken and ham into the sauce and poured over egg noodles...the same great taste but less work!

This was really good.  I have never cooked a full chicken breast over a skillet before but it definitely turned out well.  We will definitely make this recipe again.

WOW!  This was much easier than I thought, and definitely delicious!  The sauce is spectacular!  I added sliced mushrooms to the sauce and about a half a teaspoon salt.  The salt definitely brought out the taste.  And the mushrooms I do to anything that they won't clash with!  I love mushrooms!  I licked my plate clean!

This one really took me by surprise.  It's so simple!  The sauce was delicious.  I did make one change by substituting Canadian bacon for ham.  It was wonderful.

Made this tonight and it was great!  I breaded it with half flour and half panko with an egg wash because I know that's what my family likes. I recommend salting the chicken before you bread it.   I think the only change I'll make next time is to use a thicker piece of cheese.  The slices are just too thin and lose their taste.  The recipe calls for dry white wine.  Mine wasn't dry enough and the cream sauce turned out very sweet.  Next time I'll use dry or just substitute with chicken bouillon.  I took the advice of another reviewer and finished them in the oven.  My family loved it and I'll be making it again.

Sooooo great! Only had Riesling on hand and did what another reviewer said- browned the chicken in the pan for about 10 min then finished it off in the oven at 325 convect. The sauce was used on our rice and asparagus as well- couldn’t get enough of it. Perfect!!!

Absolutely restaurant quality. Mixed panko Italian crumbs and regular Italian crumbs after an egg wash. Pounded one large breast thin enough for two portions. Used leftover spiral sliced ham and thick sliced baby Swiss with Dijon mustard.
Tied with string before dipping and coating. Once finished I liberally sprinkled with cayenne and dried parsley.
Straight into a 350 oven for 45 minutes. No need for stovetop browning.
Sauce: melted 3 tblsp butter, bullion, 1 tblsp bacon grease with wine. Added cream and cornstarch slurry with more parsley for color.
Sliced one portion into pinwheels. Perfect for two. Had enough sauce left for another meal with the remaining portion.
Gorgeous, delicious and only 30 minutes total prep. What a winning recipe!

Great recipe, simple, easy and delicious.

***HOT TIP*** I accidentally bought buttermilk at the store instead of whipping cream, so I used that and omg it was delicious. It added a slightly tangy yet creamy quality to the sauce. Highly recommend making the same "mistake" that I made!

My boys LOVED it! Even my picky eater! The sauce was so delicious, I even drizzled it over the broccoli and that was readily eaten too!  Next time I make this, I'll double up on the sauce and use the leftover as an aioli. 

Word of note: when the sauce appears to be broken you need to keep stirring/whipping it up until it is a smooth consistency. This includes reheating! It seems like it is nothing but butter, but keep whisking it and it becomes a beautiful cream sauce again!

Left the paprika out cuz I forgot it, but this recipe is delicious.   Also used whole milk in place of the heavy cream.  I made this and the broccoli with sage and the combo was amazing!  We stuffed ourselves at my little dinner party.

This is a very good recipe, owing to the wine sauce. I used chicken tenderloins--one for the top and one for the bottom. Instead of Swiss, I used Gouda cheese. For the ham, I simply used lunch meat (though actual ham would have been better). In the wine sauce, I used a sweet white wine (Moscato). The wine was tasty and left a sweet flavor at the end of a bite. Just really good.

This was my first attempt at Chicken cordon blu and I must say it was delicious. My wife gave it 4 stars. (meaning make it again)
I flattened the breasts but not enough, some of the cheese escaped and burned on the bottom of the pan which made the sauce a little um, dark.
Next time I will flatten the chicken more and fold the ham over the cheese with the open side of the ham inside of the folded breast.

This was a really great recipe, but I made some changes.

First, I flattened the chicken to approx 1/2". I then seasoned both sides of the flattened chicken with salt, garlic, pepper, onion powder, and parsley. 

Secondly, I used some honey Dijon mustard on the inside with the ham and cheese. I lightly spread it around. I then rolled the chicken with the ham and cheese and used butchers twine to hold it closed. I used egg wash and coated the rolled chicken in bread crumbs.

I then heated 3 tablespoons of butter and 3 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet and fried each side until brown. I then transferred the chicken to the oven at 350 for 25 minutes.

At this time I used 3 tablespoons of butter, 1/2 cup of wine(sauvignon blanc), 1 teaspoon of chicken boullion and put them in a sauce pan. I mixed the heavy cream and cornstarch until smooth and added to the sauce pan. Cooked until boiling whisking constantly until desired thickness was reached. Remove from heat and let rest while waiting on chicken to finish. 

Sauce can be poured on top of chicken or served on the side.

Served with steamed broccoli and a poppyseed dressing spinach salad with tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, and feta cheese. 

A new favorite and excellent presentation!

I love this recipe. Relatively quick to prepare, not too tricky, and really tasty. I added some salt, pepper and garlic to the flour and paprika as suggested by previous reviewers. I had a little trouble rolling the chicken, ham and cheese but did okay with the help of lots of toothpicks. I browned the rolled chicken lightly as directed, using butter and olive oil, and had almost no cheese leaks. I kept the temp really low after I added the wine and again, no cheese leaks. Cooked for about 30 minutes. I made a little extra sauce because, well, sauce. Right?  I used cheap cooking wine and spiked it with a splash  of lemon juice and a dash of cayenne pepper. My company was late so I kept the meat in the oven and the sauce on the stove until we were ready to eat. Good call. It was fresh and hot when I put it on the table. Served with bread, salad and vegetables this made a really nice meal and took about an hour to prepare. Definitely a win!

I've made this recipe several times and we love it.   This week I accidentally came across a secret to keeping them together without using string or toothpicks.   Due to time constraints on the day of my dinner, I put them together the night before and rolled them tightly and tightly put saran wrap on each piece.  When I browned them in the pan they kept their shape and  I didn't need to remove toothpicks or string after.   Will do this from now on if I have time the night before.

Awesome!  Didn't change a thing except only made four breasts.   You will want to put this sauce on everything!  I do think you need to use wine like the recipe says and not substitute with chicken stock as some reviews suggested. The wine definitely makes the sauce.  Enjoy!

FABULOUS. I read many reviews and tweaked to my tastes. I  sliced 3 large breasts down the middle. Folded Swiss into a square, folded ham around it, rolled up chicken & secured with toothpicks. Dipped in egg and rolled in panko & paprika. In a cast iron I browed for 5 minutes each side in 3 tbsp. butter & 3 olive oil. I transferred to glass dish and baked at 350 for 25 minutes. While it baked, I simmered 1 cup of chicken broth in the cast iron. I whisked in 1 cup heavy cream and 1 tbsp. cornstarch until thick. AMAZING!

I am low carb diet and made this for breakfast, lol. But it was absolutely wonderf,  I had no paprika so i just just used extra pepper,poultry seasoning and garlic salt in flour. This was 1st time I used Grier chz, dusted breast in tiny bit of salt and lemon pepper.i did not hv any white wine, but had  red wine I mixed some 1/2 chkn buillion and 3 tsp of  wine, since it was so strong. The chk cooked and made its own gravy.  I used a combo of olive oil and 3 tblsp of butter to sauté,  I did the best with what I had. I sliced cucumbers Omg Thank u , I could eat this every day!!

I made this for 20 on Christmas Day and it was fabulous. 

My tweaks: Due to the large group, I made everything up to the final cooking stage the day before. I browned the breasts/breading and then stuck everything in the fridge overnight. I cooked the prepared breasts at 350 for 30 minutes and they were perfect. 
I made the wine sauce separately;  just started with the butter, then added wine, bullion, paprika, cream w/ cornstarch and it was yummy. 
Also - added some Panko and spices to the flour breading for a much more exciting crust.

Hubby and I both loved it.  I didn't have the heavy whipping cream in the house so substituted it with 3/4 cup milk with 1/3 cup butter and it worked perfectly.

This was a simple, but very elegant recipe.  The only thing I did differently, was I added a little Ms Dash with the blue cap to the side of the chicken, that you brown before dusting it with flour. My family loved it! In the words of my 5 year old grandson, "Mmmm, good nannie!"

The sauce is great. We ate it on the rice and broccoli as well as the chicken. The best thing I did was buy thin chicken breasts saved a lot of time and made it easier. Got them on sale. My family loved this!

Cooking time isn't long enough.  Always  cook chicken in a lot of water or moisture on a low heat - takes longer but comes out perfectly. Also you can use bread crumbles and Aloit soft cheese without the ham, and add apple cider vinegar and lemon to bring out flavor.

Wow, this was totally delicious, easy and elegant. The best part, though, was the gravy!! OMG this gravy is fantastic. If there were ever a chicken gravy competition, this would win hands down. I added a little chopped fresh basil at the end, though it wasn't needed.

I used thick pieces of chicken and cut them in half, not fully cut off into two. Then used mozzarella cheese and Virginia ham.  Rolled other half of chicken over and tooth picked the edges.  Came out good.  Enjoyed the sauce that we out over the chicken.

This was great.  I followed a lot of the reviews, making sure I pounded the chicken breasts thinner than stated in the recipe, and it does cut cooking time down significantly.  I also added a teaspoon of poultry seasoning to the flour coating of the chicken.  The sauce turned out fantastic.  I made this just the other night and my wife is already asking me to make it again.  Also, depending on how thick cut your ham and swiss cheese is, I would also if they are both thinner add a second slice of each to each chicken breast.  Just my preference.

Amazing recipe! It was delicious and I just have problem with the chicken breast size, because they were too small to close completely, but I used two toothpicks. The other thing I did, instead of wine and chicken bouillon, I used a can of chicken broth.

Super amazing! I would recomend to anyone. This one is a little bit of work but if done right is really good. Would be really good to pair w/ some rice pilaf and broccoli.

Made this for Valentines Day, we love it! Simple and delicious! The only difference I used whole milk instead of heavy cream and it still turned out perfect! Awesome meal that my husband and I loved! It was especially good with my extra smoky ham. Went great with my  yummy asparagus too.

My cheese leaked out of the chicken and burnt in the pan and the sauce was a red, greasy mess. The chicken itself was tough.

I really loved it! We had my Mom over for dinner & will make this dish again. I didn't have swiss, so I used mozzarella instead. Also I browned in the pan, then like one reviewer, put the whole pan in the oven.  I made the sauce on the stove top.  I then ended up with a more mild sauce (from the chicken, butter, ham flavors) and the wine sauce.  The kids preferred the mild sauce from the chicken pan.  The adults loved both.

This is just the best recipe.  It's one of my go-to dishes to serve when I have company.  I'm a sucker for cream sauces and this once is very tasty.  The chicken is just so moist and juicy and it comes out perfect every time I make it!

I made this tonight.  It was great!  The only thing I did different, not as much chicken and when the chicken was simmering in the pan after frying, I added a small amount of chicken brother, just to ensure that it would not all cook away.  My family loved it...definitely a keeper!

We really enjoyed this decadent dish. We made it for a dinner party of ten. It got rave reviews. I used imported ham and Gruyere cheese and added a little extra paprika into the flour mixture. Otherwise, we followed the recipe exactly.

Very good. Make sure chicken breasts are pounded thin. Add corn starch mixture for sauce to left over liquid from chicken skillet. Very tasty. I baked chicken in oven for additional ten minutes to serve crispy instead of soggy.

Pretty much made this as directed, but used a flour/egg/panko coating and finished up in the oven. The sauce was tasty, but I didn't care for the color of it, It was darker than I am use to, so will make changes next time. Good basic recipe, will probably make again with a few minor changes.. again. Thanks for sharing.

It was very good. I used large breasts (about 8 Lbs total). My family ate almost all of it and took the rest for lunch. They packed their own lunch to make sure they got some LOL.  I added a honey mustard rub and spiced the outside with a mild rub. The sauce was excellent.

The chicken was moist and had great flavor but the sauce was a little too thick !  Next time I would make it with more of a broth sauce over it .

Followed recipe almost exactly.  Did not have ham, so we used bacon instead.  Hands down this was one of the best dinners we have had!  The kids want it for Christmas Day.

Easy and tasty. Nice to play with other ingredients.   We like to add spinach and use pepper jack cheese for variety.

My husband absolutely loves when I make this! Don't change a thing! It's been very popular for guests or just a meal for the two of us with leftovers! The sauce that results is divine! The tricky bit is rolling the chicken with the ham and cheese, but you'll get the hang of it!

Wonderful recipe and very easy to make (though does require a bit of prep).  It's a great meal to make when you're looking for something different to do and is a wonderful main dish for company.

The cheese totally melted out of the chicken.  Therefore my sauce tasted like cheese fondue. Just a bit powerful.

This is AMAZING. I've made this for years (from the Good House Keeping Illustrated Cookbook). My parents always made it and it was always my choice for my birthday meal growing up. The only change I would make, would be that I pound the chicken to make it spread out and thinner, it's easier to roll the ham and cheese in. Also, in addition to the toothpicks to close it, I tie some cooking twine/string around it to keep the cheese in a little more. But other than that, this is perfect the way it is!!!

I made this and it was really awesome! Absolutely 5 stars! I even licked the pan! This recipe rocks! Look for smaller chicken breasts though. Because by the time you pound them into a quarter inch mine were way too big but still so good! Way to go! Enjoy!

This recipe is definitely a winner BUT it is also the same directions as in my own Good Housekeeping Illustrated Cookbook which I've had for over 30 years! The only alterations I made is to omit the toothpicks - they make it more difficult to handle while browning. I also pound the meat thinner than directed and have the ham and cheese in between two pieces of chicken rather than folding. A little extra wine won't hurt either - makes the flavor boosted a bit!

I wished I seasoned the chicken before cooking - and I baked it at 350 for 45 min. It was still a great recipe.

This recipe is always a hit with my family.  I make extra sauce because it is so delicious over the rice. I have read all the reviews and i love the tips and tricks everyone shares. I end up using my whole bottle of wine and i also use my smoked paprika and flour to give the sauce body instead of the cornstarch.

This was a tasty dish but it was pretty complicated and time consuming. The instructions were also not super clear which I disliked. I ended up electing to use two different saucepans despite the instructions seemingly indicating you only need one.

So good and easy to make. I had to substitute crisp bacon for ham. It's so much better with bacon. I've made it both ways. The sauce was the best part.

Absolutely delicious! I don't have something to flatten the chicken enough so I just sloppily cut into each breast enough to stuff them. I also sauteed mushrooms before making the sauce, then had the mushrooms in the sauce! It was delicious. Really great on the chicken and potatoes I served. I'll definitely be making this again!

- I used chicken stock instead of white wine, also.

Two for dinner and the ratings were 4.5 and 5.5 so this recipe gets a 5 star rating. The sauce was amazing. There was enough for the rice too. Only change was the addition of 1 tablespoon of basil. Not sure I would add it next time as it really wasn't needed.

Perfect directions, especially with the video. It tastes great and was a huge hit with my family. My biggest concern was the chicken being too thick and either unrolling on me or not being rollable. I had zero problems with it (obviously I used tooth picks). My only downside was that I didn't roll it in the flour and paprika well enough, but that's of the fun parts about cooking, learning how to do it better the next time.

These were great! I made this recipe for my family and everyone agreed that its a KEEPER! I did modify the recipe based on other reviews. I used an egg wash and Italian bread crumbs with Parmesan cheese, doubled the sauce, and baked in the oven after browning. I substituted prosciutto and provolone in place of ham and swiss. Loved it!!

I could dinner every Sunday night for a friend.  This is one of our favorites.  It was easy and delicious.  I always make enough for leftovers and it was good the next day too.

This was my first time making Chicken Cordon Bleu. It was fairly easy to follow. I made extra sauce because I like a lot of it. The toothpicks were hard to get out of the chicken so I'll use twine next time to close it. I would definitely make it again.

I used 1/2 olive oil, 1/2 butter but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  The sauce is to die for.  Seriously incredible. Next time I will use a bit more cheese or add some at the end, because most of it melted out of the chicken and into the pan. I also need to tinker with the cooking time as my chicken came out a little dry but I think that was user error relating to the size of the chicken breast I used.  The flavor was very good. Thanks for the recipe!

Everyone liked this recipe except me. Maybe it was the swiss cheese of maybe it was the fact that the chicken wouldn't cooperate with me, but I don't see myself making this again.

This was fantastic! Best Chick Cordon Bleu ever. The sauce is just amazing and I would like to try it for other recipes as well. I added some crumbs to the flour mixture. My cutlets were very thin and did not need to be cooked nearly as long. I followed other reviewers' suggestions of wrapping the cheese in the ham to prevent it from all spilling out. Was perfect. Delicious!

Looking for a low carb option? When anything calls for breading the meat I give it a quick egg wash and then dredge through ground up/smashed pork rinds instead of flour or bread crumbs. Similar texture and great taste. Love this recipe!

This is the second time I've made this and absolutely loved it.  This time I cooked it all on the grill except for the sauce which I made stove top.  I followed the recipe and then dipped in eggs and coated in panko breadcrumbs.  We then cooked on the grill at about 375 degrees for approx. 30 mins and served with grilled green beans.  Absolutely delicious!!!

This was excellent recipe.  I tryed it on my husband which chicken is his least favorited meat.  He is a beef eater.  He loved it.  I will make it again for future family gatherings.  It was easy, quick and tasty.  I served it with angel hair pasta sprinkled with parsley and butter.

1st time I've ever actually taken the time to rate a dish on this website and I've been using it for over a year! Awesome! I took some other's advice and browned chicken on all sides in pan then transferred to oven at 350 for 20 minutes, turned out perfect! I used halved chicken breasts and didn't have to thin first, also once I removed the browned chicken breast I used the same pan to make the sauce. I used 1/4 cup of water and 1/4 cup of Apple juice instead of 1/2 of white wine. I also threw in the left over flour/paprika mixture then the cream/cornstarch mixture whisked well and 1 slice of Swiss cheese at the end. The sauce was so very good, might double it next time as I only made 3 chicken breast halves instead of 6 and there still just wasn't enough of the good stuff, everyone wanted more!

Very tasty! I made 13 for a party of 11 adults and 6 kids and it was all eaten up! 
I ended up doing a quick pan fry and baking them in the 350 oven for 25 minutes. And then making the sauce separately using the same pan I did the quick browning in. Delicious!

This is amazing! I followed some of the other advice and used half extra virgin olive oil and half butter. I used the amount of flour it calls for, but added about a cup of breadcrumbs with it. Delicious!

This recipe is terrific as is. I found that pounding the chicken breasts thinner is a necessity to rolling them neatly as in the pictures.  I didn't have heavy whipping cream and I preferred to reduce the fat and calories, so I substituted 7/8 cup 1% milk and 1/8 cup additional butter.  This substitution is less rich than heavy whipping cream, with less than 300 calories vs nearly 900 calories  in a cup of whipping cream, and it suited our family's taste better than the heavier sauce in the recipe.

I did this and OMG!!! It was the BOMB!!! First time I have ever done this. Even the kids, 6, 10 and 13 loved it!!! I browned the chicken in 3 tbsp. of butter then threw it in the oven about 30 minutes (thicker chicken) I made the sauce in the pan I browned it in, doing the butter, wine and bouillon first then adding the cream and cornstarch(already mixed up) slowly then when it was done and off the heat I add another sliver of butter to make it velvety!

This is one of my favorite recipes. My boyfriend really enjoyed it as well. If you were wanting to save some for left overs, put the sauce on it later. If the sauce is refrigerated it will thicken.

I did this today for mothers day. My wife was extremely happy!! Added to the best dinner dishes I've done so far. I cook on Sundays only. Anyway. As much as I pounded the chicken breast, they were still huge when I rolled them. All in all... awesome. Served with a rice pilaf(from scratch) and a glass of Moscato rose wine. Sorry. Did not take a photo.

This recipe is delicious as is! I have also made it as others have suggested breaded (in panko) and fried. I ALWAYS double the sauce portion as everyone at my table always puts it on everything on their plate (horrible, I know!)

Recipe itself is very delicious (even if you can feel your heart clog a bit). However, it is quite a pain to manage keeping the rolls together nicely.

I tried this recipe with a few changes for my ultra picky husband and he loved it! I substituted the chicken bouillon granules and white wine with chicken broth. Since i am not a fan of Swiss, i used havarti cheese instead (sliced in deli at local grocer)... I served this with wild rice and it was a perfect combo!

The nirvana of dinner preparation.  Easy to make, easy cleanup (only one pan) and SO SO DELICIOUS.  This is my boyfriend's favorite.  I follow it with no changes.  Make sure you flip the chicken in the pan every 5 minutes or so for even cooking.  Nothing more to say...you are missing out if you have not yet tried this masterpiece.

This recipe is fantastic! My husband is usually pretty picky, this is his favorite.  The only change I made was I added  a little bit of sherry because my husband likes the flavor.  It really is a great recipe! Thank you!  Family and friends all rave about it.

I made this for 4 kids and 4 adults (increasing the chicken breasts to 8), and everyone cleaned their plates, even the picky eaters! I actually forgot the step of coating the chicken in flour, but it turned out fine. They still got brown. Some of the cheese melted out as the chicken cooked, but I just strained the liquid before adding the cream to get the chunks of cheese out. I don't know much about wine, but after doing a little research on what a dry white wine was, I settled on Pinot Grigio. The sauce it produced was delicious! I doubled the sauce as some previous reviewers recommended, and I'm glad I did. I served this with Chef John's rice pilaf (recipe is on this site) and grilled asparagus. I saw people also putting the sauce on their rice--it really was tasty.

I personally thought the chicken was a little bit dry, but the two men I made it for loved it. I made the recipe exactly as is, making sure to wrap the ham around the Swiss cheese to ensure that the cheese didn't melt out. The execution was very easy. The sauce was absolutely amazing.

If I could have given this more that 5 stars I would have. It was amazing. I made it for the first time for my family about 2 years ago. I now have to make it at least once a month but it's usually more than that. The sauce is what makes this so delicious. I wish I could make it on its own but it's not the same without the chicken. You definitely have to try this recipe. You won't regret it.

Tastes good, but kind of a pain to make and don't use cheap toothpicks or you end up with them stuck in your chicken

This recipe is excellent.  All ages loved this meal.  Even my 8 year old that said she does not want chicken anymore loved it.  Preparation was not complicated. Great meal.  Tom

This is a great dish full of flavor very rich. My hubby and I enjoyed it so much. Can't eat it every day will blow the diet, but once in a while splurge is well worth it, in my book. I used chicken thighs and honey ham in it. I put the cheese into the ham and rolled it up like a burrito then rolled my chicken thigh around that. my cheese stayed inside the ham. Happy Cooking

Amazing! I followed the directions exactly, it takes time to make it so don't try it on a night that you're running late but so worth the time. Would give it 10 stars if I could.

Wow!  This was excellent.  The chicken will brown quickly.  I was so worried the chicken was going to fall apart, but it did very well.  I was also very worried about using that much butter, but oh well.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out like a fancy restaurant had made it!  Thanks for the recipe!  The chicken was super tender..didn't even need a knife.

This has become one of our favourite dinners.  Using a good Swiss cheese from the deli is key.  Instead of toothpicks, I use a piece a raw spaghetti so I don't have to pick them out.  The spaghetti just softens and disappears.

My one suggestion is to use dry spaghetti instead of toothpicks. They cook right along with the roll and you don't have to go looking for toothpicks to remove.

Delicious! Now if only the person who rolled them for the picture would come over and roll them for me. The sauce really helps this recipe stand out. If you're like me and don't drink wine, just invite a wine drinking friend over for supper who can help finish it off. I tried the pan method but have since started baking these in the oven for ease. When I do that I just put the wine, bouillion, cream etc. in a pan and drizzle over the chicken.

I made this today to use up some leftover ham and it was delicious! I didn't change a thing, but I did use Cabernet Sauvignon since that was all I had and it was wonderful. Definately easy and worth repeating.

Used this recipe as a guideline mostly for the sauce which is amazing!  I wanted a breadcrumb outside to the chicken. Just pounded out breasts, laid slice of ham and small finger sized portion of Swiss, rolled and toothpicked closed. Dipped in egg then homemade seasoned bread crumbs. Baked 400, covered with foil for 20 min then uncovered for 20. Melted butter in cast iron skillet, added 1 teaspoon-ish each  minced garlic and bouillon paste. Added 1/2cup white wine, 1c heavy cream with the cornstarch. Cooked until thickened and added a little dried parsley. Restaurant quality. Yum!

We've made this multiple times and it's been just AWESOME.  Protip: be sure to keep the chicken simmering for the last 30 minutes on very low heat to avoid it drying out.  This sort of thing may be common sense to a very experienced cook, but to less experienced cooks like myself, it's a valid tip.  My girlfriend loved it.

WOW!!! Glad I tried this recipe! It was the best thing I have ever made and so easy!!! Like other reviewers, I used egg and panko breadcrumbs instead of the flour. I substituted the paprika with smoked paprika. And I cut the butter in half and substituted with olive oil to make it a little healthier. The sauce was to die for!!! OMG!!!! I doubled the sauce, but next time I wont do that. Way too much sauce and I drown everything in sauce. Incredible recipe!!! Thank you!!! Even my boyfriend absolutely loved it. Truly restaurant quality!!

I made a few changes and I'm glad that I did. I used an egg/milk wash and double-coated with panko bread crumbs and browned on all sides followed by placing in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Also, I used a sauvignon blanc for the sauce although I removed the burned bits of panko breading from the drippings. I happened to have a lot of leftovers so, I reheated in the oven the next day. I found that the chicken was much more flavorful then and because I had double-coated, the chicken crust was so crunchy still. The sauce is amazing so doubling that was a no-brainer. Definitely a must try!!! Thanks for sharing your recipe xoxox

I made these the other day and they turned out so very awesome. My mother's longtime friends came over and had dinner with us. She had never had Chicken Cordon Bleu before, and she is a super picky eater... She loved it.

One thing I did was slice the chicken breasts in half and than pound them out from there and so the portion size was a little smaller. My husband's reaction to this recipe will have me making it again in no time. We both loved it!!!

Really good!  I just rolled the chicken as directed, sprinkled with seasoned breadcrumbs, and tossed the sauce ingredients in a baking dish @ 350.  Stirred it around 30 min and cooked for 10 more min and broiled for a couple of min to brown.  Try with Curried Cumin Potatoes - the sauce really compliments them!

Excellent!! But I made a few changes. I pounded my chicken breast halves so they were thin added a slice of ham and a slice of cheese and rolled the chicken breasts. I then dipped in egg and coated with panko bread crumbs and then browned. I then put the pan in the oven at 350 for abt 15-20 min. I made the sauce over the stove and used white cooking wine because that is what I had. A keeper for sure

This was very good-- I did alter it a smidge, I added 1/4 ts onion powder and white pepper to the sauce to give it some flavor- also added a can of mushrooms. really gave the chicken a nice contrast. I will make this again

I followed the directions almost exactly. I added breadcrumbs and baked instead of flour and sautee. It was a better crunch that way. I also added a drizzle of honey mustard on the ham/cheese filling. I didn't like but my boyfriend said it was the best dish I've made for him.

Sauce was really yummy, but this was a lot of work. Use left over ham next time.

Absolutely the best chicken I have ever had! The cheese and ham stayed in the chicken, and the cream sauce mixed in with the juices from the chicken in the end made it sooo yummy, pretty easy recipes and will definitely be eager to do it again!

I made this the way it said but instead of rolling it I just fold it over so the chicken cooks more evenly.  We loved it! Like fine dining.

Just made this for dinner tonight and it was amazing!! Even my 2.5 year old loved it, which is saying a lot. I think the only thing I did differently was to cook the chicken completely and then remove it from the pan before I added the wine and cream. Anytime I try to add wine while meat is still in the pan it becomes a disaster, but doing it that way was absolutely perfect. I will definitely be making this again!!!

Loved this, most of all so did my hubby and he isn't thrilled when I make chicken of any kind.
The only changes I made was I used prosciutto, and pounded the chicken thinner.
The sauce was awesome! I made roasted potatoes and scooped the sauce on those too.
I will make this again, but extra sauce!

I have made this several times for my family. My parents adore it and put the sauce over everything on their plates. As for my four year old son I was surprised that he not only loved it but asked for seconds. I have learned to double the sauce recipe and to keep the cheese from melting out I fold it like a burrito meaning I tuck the ends as I roll it. Thank you so much for this recipe it is a monthly staple now.

I love this recipe, we double the sauce amount of wine, chicken  bouillon seasoning and heavy whipping cream and make enough sauce to put over angel hair pasta with the chicken. Makes for a great whole meal!

I changed the recipe a little bit based on the vegetables and spices I had. I filled the chicken breasts with barberry and cheese and dipped the breasts in a mix of saffron, lime, black pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder. After Frying the Cordon Bleu in corn oil I transferred them in a tomato sauce with mushroom, bell pepper, and paprika. We really enjoyed the look and taste and we recommend to try cordon bleu this way also.

This was the best dish I have ever made.   I fried the chicken until brown and then put it in the over for about 40 min and put a small amount of the sauce in the bottom of the baking dish for the chicken to simmer in.

This is the best! I didn't have meat hammer (hahah what I call it) and I was lucky that pollo milanesa was on sale at my down the street latino market. This is thin sliced chicken breast. So all I had to do was roll it up with some lunch meat ham and cheese and it was GOOD TO GO! The sauce is incredibly flavorful and I would recommend making extra. It tastes so good on mashed potatoes! I really couldn't believe how easy and tasty this recipe is. I can even make just one serving for myself quickly. A real winner this one!

Yumalicious! I followed the recipe exactly. Me and my bf really liked the sauce with it. The only difficult part was pounding the chicken! It was my first attempt at flattening meat, I even watched a video. But it all turned out well :)

The sauce will go on anything!  I butterflied the chicken breasts and baked at 350 for 30 min instead of leaving them in the sauce.  SO good!

I was SO excited to try this recipe.  Sounded like the perfect change of pace for Easter - ham, chicken, sauce, upscale presentation if cut into slices. Used the following recommendations: pounded chicken between 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick, used panko with the paprika (also made half of my recipe using seasoned breadcrumbs - did not like this b/c it overpowered the other flavors and made the recipe taste "generic"), used 3 T of butter for browning in the skillet, used a no water added thick sliced D&W ham, thick sliced good deli swiss, a decent (12 dollar)chardonnay for the sauce, finished the chicken by baking, and then made the sauce in a saucepan on the stovetop (without drippings).  We said it was 'pretty good, I guess.'  Zero wow factor, really sort of bland (chicken tasted like butter from pan frying & the sauce like creamy, buttery, wine - no dimension/depth) with the swiss & wine tasting sauce not a hit with my 4 & 12 year old (they did eat it, though they aren't really picky) & although not so difficult to make it did have quite a few steps - left me feeling like it was nowhere near worth the effort.  Still REALLY wanted this to be the perfect Easter recipe.  So, if I don't find something different to try I might give it one more shot - this time adding garlic to panko, using olive oil and a little butter for frying, replacing all or half of the ham with procuitto, & saving drippings for sauce.  I WANT to love this recipe, but so far it is a weeknight meal at best.

Very, very good. My picky husband told me it was delicious multiple times while he ate dinner! I went the oven baking route but otherwise stuck to the recipe. I baked the chicken/ham/cheese in the wine/chicken broth mix until done then removed the chicken and added the wine/broth/chicken dripping mix to the cream and cornstarch and heated on the stove till thick. I then sliced the Chicken Cordon Bleu into cutlets and drizzled the amazing sauce over the top. Delicious!

I baked at 350 for 35 minutes instead of keeping them in the skillet. I added the wine before I put them in the oven, and then didn't need the bullion. This way there was a lot of sauce. I added a bit of fresh grated nutmeg and corriander as well. Yum! It takes a bit of time, though, to get the chicken flat and in the right shape, and to roll them. Also, if you use flour, then egg, then the breadcrumbs, it has a thicker crust.

I made this tonight, paired it with roasted red potatoes and maple dill carrots from this site. I made it exactly as written, which is unusual for me.  I usually tweek recipes as I go, lol. It tasted really good, but Im not exactly a pro cook, so I had a couple problems.  I had a little trouble rolling the breasts around the ham and cheese, but I evenyually got 3 that looked pretty good.  The sauce was yummy, but I had to make a second batch.  The first one looked like it separated, was lumpy.  Maybe I cooked it too long?  The second batch was perfect.  I did as others suggested and finished the cooking in the oven, adding the sauce at the end. I also cut the breast into 1" rounds, then drizzled the sauce over the top, then garnished the whole thing with fresh parsley.  Ive always felt that if food looks good, it will taste good, and I think my presentation was outstanding!  I will definately make this again.  Maybe next time I will have an easier time rolling them, lol...

This was soooo good and soooo easy- suprisingly even my picky 14 year old enjoyed this dish. I will definately be making it again. I prepared it as indicated for the most part, except I seasoned the flour mixture a little (garlic and onion powder). I used 7 chicken breasts, so I doubled the sauce and served it over pasta.

This was excellant! my whole family loved it. I did buy the thin chicken cutlets so I did not have to pound out chicken breasts, they worked great! Combined some olive oil with the butter and used chicken base instead of chicken bullion cube. Will make again for sure, delicious !

I made this for a combination Valentine's Day/birthday dinner with friends.  It was delicious! I need to practice the rolling & pinning technique--the cheese did leak out but that's not the recipe's fault. I followed the recipe's cooking method and it was fine; I did use gluten-free rice flour to dredge the chicken as well as subbing proscuito for ham.  The sauce was delicious; I doubled it which made a TON.  (So I used the leftover sauce & chicken to make "chicken cordon bleu pizza" the next day. Yum again!)
I did have to laugh at myself--I used colored toothpicks in the chicken...um, not a good idea.  The color bled into the chicken!  Thankfully it's food-safe, but still--I jokingly claimed that I'd done it on purpose to make Rainbow Chicken Cordon Bleu.  Ha! Oh, well... :-)
I look forward to making this again and doing a better job--the flavor is worth it!!

Great recipe!  Very rich!  Doubled the sauce to serve over pasta.  Added mushrooms (sauted prior to browning chicken, then removed.  Re-added before adding wine.)  Served with asparagus.  Also added a small amount of salt and pepper to flour.

I made this twice in one week! Once for my family who loved it and once for friends who thought I was an amazing cook! The hardest part was pounding out the chicken flat! A one pot dish and no oven heating up the house! I did put more flour and paprika in the bowl than it called for and the egg brush would be a good idea!

Loved this simple recipe for such an elegant dish. In my usual fashion of not being able to leave a good thing alone (and because I love mushrooms) I added sauteed button mushrooms to the sauce.  Served it up with homegrown asparagus, and there was none left even though I had fixed extra servings.

This was an absolute success! The chicken was juicy and the sauce was amazing. I substitued the Swiss Cheese for Provolone and ham for Proscuitto.

To make it easier without using tooth picks...after rolling. Chicken... wrap in saran wrap...put in fridge for an hour then coat with flour. It will stay together. This recipe was simply amazing.  I stuffed my chicken with ham, swiss cheese and spinach.  I used a boxed flour mix to coat the chicken. I aslo added about 1 tablespoon red wine vinegar to the white wine.  Delish... My family loved it.

It is a good base for a recipe.  I had to finish them in the oven so that they would be cooked all the way through.  I didn't have any wine but I added 2 Tbsp of cream cheese when making the sauce and it was great.

I made this for New Year's Day and my family loved it. I did make some minor changes and kinda made it my own. Instead of ham & swiss I used bacon & white american cheese. I also sprinkled the chicken with Lawry's seasoned salt and cooked my bacon in the oven before wrapping chicken around it. Then I added a garlic & onion spice blend along with the paprika into the flour. My daughter is 8 and she went back for seconds. Thank you!

I loved this recipe as is, it was very delicious. But the second time around I made a couple mods...First I used panko bread crumbs and omitted the flour and paprika for the breading, it made the dish have a little extra crunch. Next, after breading, I browned the chicken on each side in a sautee pan using a little oil or butter whichever you choose rather than adding the bullion and the wine to the pan. (I thought if I did so it would turn out soggy and mushy) After browning the chicken, I then baked it in the oven, the time is dependent upon how thick you pound your breasts out and how long you they have been browned in the pan but 20-30 is a good starting point. (mine took a while but well worth the wait) Lastly, I used the bullion, wine, butter, cream and cornstarch for a sauce that I made entirely separately. It was fab:) One of my new favorites.

New family favorite. Made it with the addition of portobello mushrooms. Made it for family, who asked me to make it for visiting friends who loved it so much that I even made it for co-workers.  Everyone loved it!! Thanks for making me look amazing. Oh. And one bad dog thinks it is fantastic too... :-)

Awesome recipe! Very easy and I had gourmet results! I did double dip my chickr with in egg and a flour bread crumb mixture. You want to double the sauce recipe for sure! I didn't use paprika at all just my usual spices. And roll your ham and cheese up then place in the chicken to roll up, holds better!

Yum!  This was amazing, although I did make a few changes.  Like some previous reviewers, I pounded the breasts flat, but not flat enough.  I also added a little stone ground mustard to the pan when I added the wine, and sliced up a little extra swiss to mix in with the sauce at the end for a little extra cheesy goodness.  I didn't add a single spice, not even salt or pepper and it was super delicious.  We will definitely be making this again.

I made this recipe with 2 very minor changes, and it was absolutely delicious. I took another reviewer's suggestion and browned the chicken in 3 tablespoons of butter and 3 tablespoons of olive oil, rather than 6 tablespoons of butter. I also used a little more than 1/4 cup of a nice Madeira wine and finished the half cup of wine with a white wine.  The Madeira wine gave the sauce a wonderful flavor, similar to a Marsalla sauce, but a little sweeter. I used Perduce thin-sliced chicken breasts so no pounding-out was necessary. It also cut down on the cooking time. The thin-sliced breasts were perfect for this recipe. My son said this is now his favorite dish.  My husband loved it, too.  Thank you for such a simple, yet yummy, recipe!

We loved it!  Only thing I did differently is is use Swanson Flavor Boost instead of the chicken bullion granules.

It is a delicious dish. I made it for my family. It was a success. I plan on making it for a dinner party. I used olive oil no butter. I used half paprika and half chipotle powder with flour coating. With all the juices, white wine, etc..it doesn't need all that cream but only a touch. The cream diluted too much of the flavor of the sauce. chopped parsley or cilantro would add to the flavor too. But overall a great dish!!

Great recipe - my husband does not like white cheeses - so I used cheddar. Also the ham I had on hand was 'smoked ham' the smokeyness really flavored the chicken a lot. One reviewer mentioned pounding the chicken thin then cooking faster - another reviewer mentioned 'butterfly' cutting the breasts. I butterflyed after not being able to pound a large breast thin. The side that was pounded cooked up best.  Next time I will butterfly AND pound any very thick breasts. Of the 'chicken' I have cooked - my husband likes this recipe the best.

Came out very well.

I didn't have swiss, so I used a combination of shredded mozzarella and cheddar.  Started it in a cast iron pan, browned both sides.  When I added the wine, I scraped the bottom of the pan under the chicken with a spatula to loosen the good bits a little, and I added most of the dredging flour along with the bits of shredded cheese that had fallen out.  Then finished in the oven.  The extra flour and cheese thickened the sauce for me, which was good since I had to sub 2% milk for the cream.

This recipe was super yummy!  The only changes I made were to brown the chicken breasts in butter and olive oil then finish cooking them in the oven.  I made my sauce in the same pan I browned my chicken it.  At first I was hesitant to add the sauce to the finished chicken because it had this odd corn-starchy taste to it, but once on the chicken it was amazing.  Will definitely be doing this one again.

Fantastic recipe!! we all loved it! The first time i made it I opted to make some of the changes others had suggested, such as browning the chicken in half butter half olive oil, and then finishing it in the oven for 20 min. and using chicken broth for the sauce instead of the white wine, and it was really good. BUT when i made it the second time I followed the recipe exactly and it was  absolutely GREAT! I will be making this recipe again and again ..just the way it is. I have already passed this recipe on to friends! Thank you for this yummy recipe.

I made this recipie last noght for company. The first time I ever made cordon bleu! It was delicious! I didn't quite follow the recipie; I didn;t fry them first to save time. It worked great, they were a tiny bit dry but that was my fault because I baked them a little bit too long. A little more of the cheese melted out than I hoped would but  they were definitly a hit and very good!! This recipie is definitly a keeper! Thanks for an amazing recipie!

Very yummy!  Not too difficult to make, and the sauce is a real crowd pleaser! I paired this dish with roasted asparagus and cherry tomatoes, and rice pilaf, and every last bit was devoured!  The sauce mixes great with the rice! A meal I will be making for years to come!

Took a bit of time to make, but really tasty. Love the sauce, doubled it up. Was worried when the stuffing started coming a bit unstuffed but that was my fault, not the recipe. Served with rice and asapargus at a ladies dinner, everyone loved it!

I made this for my husband and I, I'd only had chicken cordon bleu once at a restaurant and it was delicious and the 2 times he'd tried it he said the chicken was very dry and tasted awful (not at a restaurant). but I knew I could change his mind about it! and I did! He said "You can make this anytime!" 

I followed the recipe with an exception for the butter, I used olive oil! pounding the chicken to a 1/4 thickness first really helped to wrap it up arounds itself and cuts down on the cook time! after browning it I only cooked it for 15 mins and it came out perfect!

WOW!!! This one was definately amazing! My family raved! It was necessary to double all the sauces though. when cooking, the pan kept getting dry so I added more of the white wine and it came out amazing!

I wanted a little more flavor in my sauce so I added a pinch of ground mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and some maple syrup to taste- It was incredible!

This is the most delicious thing I've ever eaten. Make this and double the sauce to serve over steamed broccoli and cream biscuits (the recipe for cream biscuits is on Allrecipes also).
**I made this again and was going to review it and see I already did. I just wanna reiterate that this recipe is so good, it kinda make me freak out. It's that good.

I have never had a sauce that was this delicious with so little effort.  This is definitely a keeper.  I can't imagine ever having chicken cordon bleu any other way after this.  The only change I made was I used a chicken bouillon cube crushed as I don't ever have the granules on hand.  I served it with bowtie pasta and roasted vegetables.

Did not change the recipe at all. Very very good. However, I did simmer asperagus in the juices before I added the heavy cream. It all turned out great.

This is a beautiful recipe just the way it is. I did not leave enough chicken to cover the ham and swiss and it burned a bit in the pan. I had the make the sauce again. I saw a tip here where the chicken was brushed with egg, browned and then baked to finish and the sauce made separately. I am going to try that next time.

This was great. I Browned rolls in 3T butter and 3T Olive oil. Then put in the oven for 20-30 min at 350. Made sauce on stove top. Used leftover Honeybaked ham from Christmas, diced small. For cheese, I used a slice of swiss and a slice of provolone on each. All swiss may be too strong for our taste. Doubled the sauce and added a little paprika for color.  Both good ideas. Family all loved it!

wow...this was DELICIOUS, and got rave reviews from my family!  Not even a drop of sauce left at the bottom of the pan by the end of dinner, they wiped every morsel clean.  This is the kind of dish you would expect to get at a fine gourmet restaurant.  I will be making this again and again, for sure....thanks!

Excellent and easy.  I've made this a couple of times and have only tweaked it a bit.  I browned the chicken in 1/2 butter 1/2 olive oil and lightly salted the meat before adding the cheese, ham and flour mixture.

My family all said 5 star... I myself didn't seem to care for it very much because i didn't get the chicken as thin as I should have(first time ever doing anything like this). I used a sweet wine because I don't like dry wine and the sauce was amazing!

Super amazing recipe!  It's true - the sauce is so delicious that you'll want to double up, or use it in other recipes.  We like to make a white sauce pasta, parmesan and any leftover chicken and throw it in!  I wish I could give more stars!  ??

Good but not as amazing as I had hoped. I've never had this dish though so maybe it was perfect and I'm just not blown away by chicken cordon bleu.

Notes: Got cold fast so watch that, could use more salt next time (or bouillon added to the sauce).

I made a few changes.  I dipped the chicken in egg then breadcrumbs with the paprika and some garlic powder and baked it for 30 min. at 350.  I made the sauce separately with the wine, bouillon, cornstarch and cream until it thickened.

Excellent recipe.  The sauce really makes the dish - my boys were licking their plates.  I did finish cooking the chicken in the oven @ 350 for 10 mins.  Then followed the recipe from there.  I would definitely make this again.

I added a bit of italian seasoning to the wine sauce.  Very delicious, very good.  To avoid too much cooking on one side in the wine, I flipped the breasts 15 minutes in.

Make sure your chicken isn't too thick!  I had a hard time keeping the cheese inside the chicken, but I think its because they were too thick and didn't fold over very well.  And count your toothpicks. ;)  White wine sauce really puts this recipe over the top.  Delicious!

This is really good.  I am not sure if it is the best I have ever tasted but it was definitely really good and I will be making again.  Don't skip the wine sauce!  I put it on the side and dipped the chicken in instead of pouring over since I was not sure if we would like it and it was really good.

this dish was amazing!! I brushed on some Dijon Mustard before adding ham/cheese.. Also, added 2 tsp minced garlic to butter before browning chicken.  Everyone thought this dish was a hit!

Really nice!  We like spice,  so used Montreal chicken seasoning.    Also I used 1/2 & 1/2 and that worked out fine .  Served with rice and stir fry veggies! Very elegant dish ! Thank you Behr!  I am a huge fan!
This time I stacked and layered and floured,  and did the rest in a tall pot so I could turn it to brown and cook.  Was easy  to turn all sides and looked great.  :)  (Left it in during the cream step too)

I absolutely loved this recipe. 
I did use "cooking wine" because that is what I had on hand. I dipped the chicken in butter after I had rolled the cheese, ham and dijon mustard and then coated it with flour. I fried it until golden brown and then baked it at 350 for 45 minutes. I then added a couple of tablespoons of the sauce and cooked it an extra 5 minutes or so. It was delicious, I would definitely make it again... The only think I would do differently is added 2 slices of cheese instead of 1. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Great recipe and not very hard or expensive. The sauce does make this dish heavy and though it's very good, the dish can stand on it's own for a healthier option.

Easy on the wine....I doubled the sauce as suggested by another review, but I shouldn't have doubled the wine....1/2 cup is plenty.  Otherwise, very EASY recipe and delicious, tender chicken.

I made this as directed and wouldn't change a thing.  My hubby raved about these, expecially the sauce.  Next time I would pound the chicken breasts a little thinner than I did and get thinner sliced ham, but that is only my notes.  Great recipe! :)

This is my husbands absolute favorite recipe that I have ever pulled from this site. Nothing needs changing. But last week when I made it I had forgotten swiss cheese so I used mozzarella instead and I have to say I think I prefer the mozzarella to the swiss!

This was a great recipe!  Even my son who never likes anything said it was awesome.  I browned the chicken in some bacon drippings I had left from breakfast instead of the butter and it added a good smokey bacon flavor.  I will be adding this to my rotation.  Thank you!

So ridiculously easy for a great meal!  I did do a few things differently, following the advice of another reviewer, by browning the chicken then finished by baking, as well as simmering the sauce on the stovetop.

The flavor was there but appearance was a little less desired. I used fresh chicken breasts and followed Chef Ramsey's instruction by using a fillet knife to make an instersion into the chicken to make a cavern.  Stuff the ham and swiss cheese into the cavern, coat with the bread crumbs and bake in the oven. Turned out like the ones I had in the restaraunts.

Beyond amazing. I didnt use wine, but rather chicken broth like someone had suggested. I will try it with the wine next time though, but if you dont like to cook with wine for any reason, its still incredibly good!

Delicious! I prepared a bit differently while keeping the sauce and general idea of this recipe. For a breading, I used homemade breadcrumbs with a number of different spices on hand, but first rolled the rolled-breasts in an egg batter. Instead of cooking in the pan I baked them, keeping the sauce to the side since it's so incredibly rich. Lastly, instead of corn starch I used flour but doubled the amount. It was a great hit at a dinner party!

Have made this dish many times and it's always a hit. I usually sub chicken stock for the white wine because I drink red so never have white wine in the kitchen, but it's great both ways!

Hey! This was a great recipe!! I tested it out on my two very picky eaters: my farmer boyfriend and my 13 year old brother and... It was love! Thank you so much! I mad two small changes: I happened to have provolone in the fridge instead of Swiss and Canadian Bacon instead of ham. Potato... Potato. It was WONDERFUL! Thank you!

As always, I read through the most helpful reviews before starting.  I made several changes based on some of those reviews as well as my own personal taste (I didn't use toothpicks or string -- I just made sort of a casserole).  I pounded my chicken breasts, lightly seasoned both sides with seasoning salt and garlic powder, pan fried them without flour (I don't care for breading or coating) in about three tbsp. each of butter and olive oil until they were brown.  I put the chicken breasts in a casserole dish, laid a slice of deli ham, shredded parmesan cheese, a slice of swiss cheese, and shredded mixed cheese (mexican blend) on top and baked at 350 for about 30 minutes.  For the sauce I took another reviewer's suggestion and added the wine (I used cooking sherry because that is what I had on hand) and a crumbled low sodium chicken bouillon cube to the butter/olive oil mixture that was left in the pan.  I let that simmer while I mixed the cornstarch and heavy whipping cream in a separate bowl.  I poured it into the pan with the butter/olive oil, wine and bouillon mixture, and whisked it until it came to a boil and thickened.  I added paprika to the sauce, poured the sauce on top of the chicken, and put it back in the oven so the sauce would soak into the chicken.  The oven was off and I left it in there for a few minutes.  Overall, this was a good recipe and the flavors seemed to go well together.  The sauce was very good.  The chicken was extremely tender and juicy.

Love this recipe.  I usually skip the cheese and ham and just cook the chicken this way.  I usually make 2 times the sauce since it is so good.

Really good the way it is but try crushed corn flakes and rolling the chicken in it instead of the flour adds a nice crunch also I like to stuff it with garlic. Then I just brown and cook in the oven for 30 minutes. Sooo YUMMY!!

I want to like this but just don't get it. The chicken did not stay together and had a funny flavor I despised. Not to mention the mess it made in my pan.

AMAZING!!!!  I've tried a lot of allrecipes.com recipes and this is definitely my new top favorite!!!  I followed the recipe exactly.  The wine/bouillon flavored sauce is just about the best thing I've ever tasted.  In fact, I want to make just the sauce and try it on other things too!

This recipes hit home with its mix of flavors to complement the tried-and-true meal. The wine and bouillon really added character to the sauce, and my DH who is super picky said this recipe was a 'keeper'. Easy to make, and easy to customize, this is a great family meal for even the pickiest people! I didn't change a thing.

This was extremely juicy, wonderful chicken. I actually did not put the ham and cheese inside the chicken. I floured the chicken and fried it in the butter, then added the wine and bouillon. While the chicken was simmering, I added the ham and cheese on top. Worked out great and couldn't tell a difference in the taste. YUM!!

I am new to cooking, but this was a great, easy, delicious recipe! The chicken turned out so super moist and the sauce, although quite rich, was soooo good. I made it with mashed potatoes and used the remaining sauce as gravy for the potatoes!

Very good flavor!!  Mine did not come out nearly as pretty as the picture - I don't think I pounded the chicken breast halves enough and my ham and cheese ended up leaking out.  But, they tasted fantastic.  I will definitely make again, but try flattening the chicken breast more and maybe use string instead of toothpicks.  I also followed the advice of others and used 3 TBS of butter and 3 TBS of olive oil.

I've made this three times, and each time it's been ridiculously good. I couldn't understand how to fix the chicken with a toothpick, so I simply took some thread from the sewing draw and tied em up. I also wrapped the cheese in the ham slices and the cheese didn't run. I needed some more cornstarch for the sauce too. Brilliant stuff!

The chicken was outstanding even without the sauce!  I used a little of the sauce over the pasta I served it with; it didn't need much since it is so rich.  It was all delicious.

Delicious!! Even though I over-cooked my chicken the flavor was wonderful! I used our stick blender to mix up the whipping cream and cornstarch (and actually over did that too - I wasn't really paying attention) and I think that made the sauce thicken up very easily.   Great recipe, I think we decided that we'd double the ham and cheese the next time, but we had very thinly sliced deli meat/cheese.   Thank you for a wonderful dinner!

This was a delicious way to make chicken cordon bleu. The sauce really added to the chicken. Will make again!

Made this tonight, I did use chicken broth instead of wine as we don't cook with wine and it was still great!  My cheese all melted out but it was still moist and the cheese ended up in the gravy so it was a cheesy sauce to go on top, it was great.  We had company over and they loved it too!!  Def will make again

WOW!! this is absolutely out of this world! the sauce is probably the most delicious sauce i've ever had! However, i did only one thing different. I found that the best way coat your fried chicken is with just the flour salt and pepper. a lot of pepper and a little salt. Other than that amazing!!!!

Not to beat a dead horse, but I figured I would throw my 5 stars in as well.  Very tasty, easy to prepare, family LOVED it.  Gravy was delicious, even with subbing chicken broth for the wine, will probably use the gravy for other chicken recipes as well.  Will go into the dinner rotation for sure.

Very first time using this recipe and it was AMAZING. Every one raved and I just followed the directions! I did use the bread crumbs instead of the flour as some of the reviews stated.

As everyone said, the sauce is soooo yummy - we saved the leftover sauce and used it with other dinners.  I can only give this 4 stars, however, b/c when cooked as directed, the chicken came out quite dry.....I could have possibly pounded the chicken *too* thin, so I'd suggest sticking to the 1/2" thickness as written.

I've never made this before and it turned out excellent.  A bit too rich for my husband, but he still really, really enjoyed it.  I only made 2 chicken breasts, but made the sauce as originally designated by the recipe and used it over the mashed herb potatoes I made to go along with it.  This will be a standard in our house.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  I made a slight change, instead of coating the chicken with flour, I dipped the chicken in beaten egg and breadcrumbs and quickly browned them in the pan.  I poured some sauce on the chicken and baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for 1/2 an hour. It stayed so moist and tender.  I also doubled the sauce.

I used Pinot for the wine and use the olive oil/butter combo instead of just butter. This was very easy and very good. Will add to recipe book.

SO EASY & YUMMY! The sauce is to die for! I did like others have, and prepare the sauce separate, then pour it over my chicken. Its def. a favorite in this house! THANKS!
**To make assembling the chicken easier, I make a slit in the chicken breast and wrap the ham around the cheese**

I have made this twice now and both times received compliments. The sauce is AMAZING. The first time I used the flour coating and the second I did breadcrumbs. The breadcrumbs didn't hold well after simmering in the liquid but most of them did stay on. It just didn't look very uniform. To keep the cheese from melting out I got a block of swiss cheese and cut nice thick chunks and wrapped that well thicker slices of ham to secure it. When cutting into the chicken (even though I could not roll the chicken completly closed) the cheese was just softened perfectly and not melted away!

Outstanding!  This was one of my first recipes I printed, and it's so fun that it's now in the top 20!  I've made it with and without breadcrumbs, and it's all good.  When I'm short on time, I sautee the chicken breasts, then make the sauce, and just layer ham and cheese on chicken with sauce.  Not as good, but still super-yummy.  GREAT recipe!

I have recently taken up cooking and this is the 2nd recipe that I have completed.  It was absolutly amazing.  I followed the recipe but when reading the reviews I really liked the review Megeby put and I went with the way she did it instead.  My boyfriend was amazed.  I was amazed.  I did use ties to hold the chicken rolls together verses the suggested toothpicks.  I had no problems trying to keep it together.  The bread crumbs gave it the flavor I was looking for.  It turned out perfect.

This was absolutely delicious! The sauce was the perfect touch. I did end up rolling the chicken breast in flour then an egg/milk mixture then breadcrumbs, just because I like to have a little breading. I ended up having an extra slice of Swiss cheese which i just threw into the sauce. You definitely HAVE to try this!! It's my husbands new favorite dish!

After reading many reviews for this recipe I was dying to cook it and see what it tasted like. Since first adding this recipe to my recipe box, I have made it 3 times and each time it seems to taste better! My boyfriend loves it more than I do :) Definitely a keeper.

I cooked this meal for last night's dinner, following the recipe exactly (except for the fact that I made 3 chicken breasts instead of 6) and it came out FANTASTIC.  Simmering made the chicken juicy and delicious, and the sauce was incredible.  I'd recommend making a side dish that can also utilize this fantastic sauce, such as rice or potatoes.  My only recommended change would be to fold the cheese within the ham (as suggested by other posters) in order to prevent the cheese from melting out.  Loved this dish.

I did mine w/ made Broccoli & Cheese instead of ham and cheese. I'd also added garlic powder, salt, and pepper to the white wine sauce. It turned out GREAT!!! :-D I am DEFINITELY making this again. :-)

All I can say is WOW!  This was sooo good.  My husband especially liked the sauce and he doesn't usually care for it.  After reading the reviews, I did the following:  I used 3T butter amd 3T olive oil.  Put the ham and swiss on the chicken and rolled up, coated in egg wash and rolled in Panko bread crumbs.  Fried lightly for 3 mins. each side and placed in a baking dish.  With the oven at 350, I placed the chicken in the oven to bake for 25 mins. While the chicken was baking, I mixed the wine, chicken bouillon, heavy cream/cornstarch in the pan with some dried basil (that's all I had on hand), and sauteed until thick, appx. 10 mins.  Will definitely make this again many times.

Wow, this was really yummy! 3 and 5 year old loved it not to mention my husband who is not crazy about chicken.  Will make this again and again.  I took some tips and used half oil and half butter to cook it in, instead of flour I used the egg wash with bread crumbs and added fresh basil in the sauce at the end.  This may alter the flavor a little but the sauce itself is amazing and great with steamed veggies on the side!! My favorite recipe so far!

This was AMAZING! I used Chicken bouillon and water in place of the white wine and it worked great. Next time I will double the sauce because my whole family loved it!

Before I cooked this, my hubby warned me several times that he is not a fan of cordon bleu. But guess what he chanted while eating this? "KEEPER!" :-) Scaled the recipe to yield 2 and did the ff: (1) pounded 2 pcs whole (vs halved) chicken breasts (2) spreaded Dijon mustard over the chicken  (3) placed 2 slices of Swiss cheese between 2 thin slices of ham for each chicken breast (4) added 1/4 tsp garlic powder & 1/8 tsp each of iodized salt & ground black pepper for the flour mixture (5) secured the rolled chicken with thread (cross- & length-wise) & toothpicks (at the ends and middle part) (6) Fried the dregded chicken for about 4mins per side and placed in the oven at 350F for 30mins (7) For the sauce, simmered wine, bouillon granules, cornstarch, and cream until thickened. Good that I doubled the sauce! I served this with steamed broccoli on the side, jasmine rice, and "Delicious Ham & Potato Soup". Definitely a keeper! :-) Thanks for this recipe and thanks for the great/helpful reviews!

This recipe was so easy I was shocked!  I will no longer pay big bucks for store prepared Chicken cordon Blue when I can make it for a fraction of the price.  The great thing about this recipe is that you can wrap the chicken and refrigerate it the day before if you are serving it for company.

So, I made chicken cordon bleu based on this recipe, but because I did not follow the recipe as stated, I gave it a lower rating. I knew that a chicken breast with a flour coating and no bread crumbs was not the kind of cordon bleu I was looking for, so I coated my chicken breast in beaten eggs and seasoned bread crumbs after butterflying it and stuffing it. Rather than cook it in the sauce, I pan seared the breasts, and finished them in the oven at 350 degrees. I also added the juice of one lemon and double the amount of wine in the sauce because I thought it would compliment the chicken breast better. Thanks for the great jumping off point!

this was fantastic. i followed the recipe exactly and it turned out fine. i might try the breadcrumbs next time, but the flour/paprika was excellent. a small amount of the cheese did melt out during the cooking process (per other reviewers) despite my wrapping the cheese in the ham slices (per other reviewers), but not so much that there wasn't any left inside, and it really just added to the sauce! i am definitely making this again!  PS one thing i particularly liked about this recipe is the 30 minutes where you leave the chicken covered and cooking/steaming on the stove. this gave me time to organize my salad and sides (rice, asparagus)!

I never have made a comment about a dish on here yet... but I absolutely HAD to on this one!!! It was amazing! I followed some suggestions and stuck it in the oven after pan frying it for a little bit.  I also only made 4 chicken breasts but I used the same amount of sauce and it was a perfect amount.  If I was to make 6, I would probably double the wine sauce (which was fantastic!). Made it for my husband and in-laws and they raved about it all night and requested it for next time they came over.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This dish turned out to be much easier than I expected.  I tied the rolls fast with kitchen twine rather than using toothpicks.  The twine is much more secure, doesn't get in the way when turning the chicken for browing, and is also helpful when you're trying to move them around the pan.  I added some fresh chopped rosemary to the sause which we felt really rounded out the flavor just right.

Fillet chicken if necessary, because 1/2 inch is the correct width to ensure that the chicken is tender and juicy.

Made these for guests, they were fantastic.  The sauce is amazing.  I did lose the toothpicks in a couple of the pieces of chicken, so it required some chicken disection, but even that activity was overshadowed by the fabulousness of the meal.

I finally made this evening after putting it off since Monday. It was much easier than I expected and the taste was simply wonderful! I only made 4 chicken breasts, used  egg wash with added paprika and garlic powder then dredged them in flour which I also added garlic powder and paprika to. I then browned them on the stovetop before baking for 20 mins at 350 degrees. For the wine sauce, a I combined the wine, bullion and butter. Once that started to simmer, I added an extra slice of swiss cheese. I had read many reviews from folks who made the sauce along with the chicken and I really wanted that "melted cheese" flavor and this worked. One last note, I did cut back on fat content by using low fat ham slices, reduced fat swiss cheese, fat free half and half and part real butter/part "I can't believe it's not butter". My husband couldn't tell the difference and it tastes delicious. I will make it the same way again (likely soon!!)

Very tasty, easy to make.  My only gripe is that I used a rather harsh chardonnay as my wine, whereas maybe a pino gris may have been better served.

This recipe got rave reviews from my husband and our guests. After dipping the chicken in the flour mixture, I dipped it into an egg wash, then bread crumbs. This gave it the perfect crunchy coating.

This was the BEST chicken cordon bleu I've ever had!  I've never really been a big fan of it, but this recipe is definitely a keeper!  I plan to make it again this week.

This was delicious!  The sauce made it over the top.  My chicken dried out a little bit. (my fault)  I would use a meat thermometer next time.  I didn't have ham or swiss on hand, so I used proscuitto and Dublin cheddar (best cheese ever).  This added even more flavor.  Will make again!  I slit my breast crosswise instead of pounding it out.

Just made this recipe and it "rocked" as my husband exclaimed when he finally pushed himself away from the table.  I actually used leftover spiral honey ham from Christmas dinner and a lower fat swiss cheese (melted just the same).  One thing that I did that I may do different next time is that I didn't use heavy cream.  To save fat I used fat free half and half.  It looked gross (curdled) but tasted awesome.  It just kind of screwed up the presentation a bit.  If that is not an issue for you and you want to save on calories then I would try this lower fat version.  I also used the Uncle Ben's 90 second rice to save on time.  I'll use two packages next time as it barely fed both my husband and I.  Also, you can buy the Purdue thin cuts (which I used) instead of having to pound the cutlets.  I will use two packages of those next time instead of one because the cutlets are somewhat small.  Overall, it rocked!

This is a REALLY delicious and simple dish to make. I made it for dinner a few nights ago and the boyfriend LOVED it. Instead of simmering it on the stove, I baked it in the oven and it came out tender and juicy.

This is an excellent dish and quite easy to make.  Make sure to pound out the chicken to at least 1/2 inch as other users point out.  And make sure to double up on the sauce, you will want more!  Amazing!  Thanks for sharing!

very tasty dish, however we added about 1/2 cup of bread crumbs to the flour with some additional spices. Definite make again, just like a top restaurant dish.

Wonderful!  Got rave reviews.  Only made one change.  After 30 minutes in skillet the chicken was not done.  I transferred it to the oven and baked it while I made the sauce.  I think it gave the chicken a little more crisp too.  It ended up perfect.

I thought this was very good (especially the sauce..yummers). I didn't know the trick about wrapping the cheese up in the ham...it worked! I sauteed the chicken bundles just enough to brown the sides, then baked @ 350 for about 20 minutes. I made the sauce seperately while the chicken cooked. Yum...and easy....I like easy

I've made a lot of the highest rated recipes on here and am usually a bit dissapointed.  Not here.  My chicken did come apart a little but still turned out well.  I will use string next time and also REALLY thin chicken.  I pounded it but still would've been better held thinner.  The sauce rocks!  If I can make this dish than anyone can!

This was simply OUTSTANDING.  I actually used white grape juice instead of wine and I used 1 cup instead of 1/2 cup.  Because I used more of the "wine", I doubled the bouillon.  I changed nothing else.  I used colored toothpicks and the color bled onto the chicken.  Oops!  Next time I think I'll try tying it like someone else recommended!  HUGE hit with our guests!

I have been looking for a recipe similar to this for a long time.  We had a little mom & pop restaurant down the road that had the best Chicken Cordon Bleu, they closed down and boy did I miss the chicken.  I could never find the right recipe to make the "sauce" that was pored over the chicken, and this sauce is extremely close if not a little better.  I did the chicken, ham & cheese like they used to do at the restaurant.  Deep fried Chicken with a piece of cheese & ham (i used smoked) on top covered with the sauce.  I made the sauce separate and used chicken broth instead of the wine and it turned out great.  Thanks for this recipe!

By FAR the best thing that I have ever cooked! Change nothing, this is a fantastic recipe. I've been spooning the sauce out of the pan just to have by itself, so you might want to make extra of that. It is DELICIOUS!

This is really good but VERY VERY rich. I could barely finish one breast and sauce. Next time I'd serve it with a fresh salad to offset some of the heaviness of this dish.

I was really surprised I couldn't give this more stars after making it. The sauce was really plain. It smelled great with the wine, thought it would be fabulous but it just wasn't. Also with the super long cook time, all the cheese ran out of the chicken making it very plain. More toothpicks might have saved it, but I will not be making this again.

Made this for a large party, my first time cooking for a group. Got rave reviews - followed others suggestions to pan fry the chicken then finish in the oven. Gravy turns out great with a sweet white wine. Best ever.

Wow!  One of the best cordon bleu dishes we have had...and I even had to improvise on the filling!  I bought the recipe items the other day but my family ate all the ham.  So, I used turkey slices!  it was awesome!  Thanks!

Due to dietary restrictions I had to modify the fat content.  Instead of the butter, I 'fried' the chicken until lightly browned using butter flavored spray, then baked the chiken for 20 minutes.  I used a 50/50 mix of fat free cheddar & mozarella cheeses.  For the sauce, I used fat free half & half and a TBS of parsely.  Then poured the sauce on the chicken and baked 5 minutes.  It was fabulous!  Even my chicken hater loved it.  Agree with other ratings....MAKE MORE SAUCE.

This was fantastic. I pounded the chicken, rolled swiss and ham in them, floured them, egged them, and dipped them in breadcrumbs. I then pan fried them in veg. oil before baking them at 350 for 30 min.  I made the sauce on the stove separately and drizzled it over the chicken before serving. I used half and half instead of whipping cream and it still turned out great!

Excellent. I made it as described except for doubling the sauce (it all still disappeared).  I also like smaller pieces of chicken so I split the breasts in half lenghtwise before flattening and rolling them up. After browing them, they spent only 20 mins cooking that way.

This was easy - however all of my swiss cheese escaped during the "simmer" time. I used fat free half/half to reduce calories, was still great!!!

This was very good.  Lots of compliments.  I used thin sliced chicken breasts, and wrapped the cheese in the ham which kept the cheese from leaking all over.  I followed the recipe exactly except I seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  If I use thin sliced chicken again I'll cut down on the cooking time.  A few people mentioned how the cream separated.  After taking the chicken out of the pan, I poured about half of the liquid out before adding the cream & corn starch and had no problem with the cream separating.

Thjis recipe was so yummy and I did double the sauce batch which was a great idea. i also added fresh mushrooms. I cooked them a little by themselves first with a dab of buuter to get the liquid out of them so the sauce wouldnt get watery. it was really good.

I did not make this chicken, but used my own version of cordon bleu much like this one.  I am rating this on the sauce.  Normally I use a bearnaise for this but decided to give this a try based upon the high ratings.  I was not disappointed!!  This was OUTSTANDING and I made it exactly as written but did it on the stove top.  Added too much wine (oops!) but it really didn't matter....rave reviews from all 15 dinner party guests!! Even picky DH said to use this sauce instead from now on...This is a sure fire WINNER!!!  Thanks for the wonderful post!

as quoted by my picky eater boyfriend "This could be served at a wedding!" only rated it a four because it was a bit difficult to keep together while in the pan. worked much better baking it at 350 for 35 minutes.Delicious!

Best. Recipe. Ever. I can't even handle how delicious this is. I've done it a few different ways; once with thick breasts that I pounded down (so much work), once with thin cut breasts that I placed one on top of the other with the filling between the two (works just as well) and once with boneless breast steaks that were huge and thin and easily folded over. I added a little honey mustard on the inside last time which was awesome, and tonight I'm going to try using havarti instead of swiss. Love that rich flavor. I also added some cooking wine to the sauce, which adds more of that wine flavor and salts it just enough. I've also used flour, egg, then panko crumbs a couple of times for a more crispy and flavorful crust. Really no matter how you tweak this recipe, if you follow the basic ingredients it's going to be fantastic. I have chicken soaking in buttermilk right now, just waiting to be cooked!
EDIT: I did these again last night, and this time I had breasts that were so huge I didn't even want to think about pounding them down. Instead, I cut along one side of the breast as deep as i could without cutting straight through it, forming a pocket. I took the ham and swiss and tucked it into the pocket, pinned it shut with a toothpick for the browning process, then stuck them in the oven for 45 minutes (they were huge). So tender and so good, worked just as well as before and actually easier than any of my other methods. Also, serve the sauce on steamed broccoli! Nomnomnom.

This is an easy and excellent recipe. I've made it three times for large groups and everyone loves it. The cream sauce has a robust flavor and the chicken does not dry out. Excellent with egg noodles and green beans.

Absolutely fabulous! The only thing I did differently was use an egg wash & rolled the chickin in plain bread crumbs mixed with paprika before frying. I fried them early in the a.m. then put in fridge until finishing the recipe at dinner. I also added parsley to the delicious cream sauce!   Don't be worried about the wine, it just adds a great depth of flavor! I sliced the rolls for serving and put the sauce on top..beautiful presentation! Kids, adults..everyone loved this recipe!!

I don't cook with wine so I substituted for chicken broth, otherwise followed recipe exactly and turned out perfect! This recipe is to time consuming and expensive for me to make as a normal weeknight meal but will make often without the ham and swiss. Ill save that for a weekend meal :) did not double sauce and had more than enough. I think its really important that you use real butter.

Very very good flavor. A little hard to get the ham and cheese in the breast, not the recipes falt however. I would double the sauce because it did not make much. My sauce did seperate for some reason, which did make the sauce unusable. Very yummy, will read other reviews to see if I can find a reason/solution for the seperation of the sauce.

I've made the recipe according to how it was written and from the suggestion of another reviewer. Gotta say that changing the recipe was much better. I did, however, cut the chicken breasts and place the ham and swiss in. Then rub the breasts with egg and cover with bread crumbs. Fry them in a pan with butter until golden on both sides. Place them in the oven for 25 minutes. While it's in the oven, mix together the cream, cornstarch, bouillon, and wine. If you like the strong taste of wine, use the measurements provided. Otherwise, reduce the wine 1/3 cup. Simmer for 10 minutes. Pour over chicken and serve!

i wonder if i made it wrong because honestly i was not impressed. maybe cause im not that big of a fan of swiss and i should have used provolne instead but something about the sauce was off. actually made me sick. again could have used a different white wine but i like all the things in this and was very disapionted and i dont know how since everyone seems to love this. only good thing about it was that it tasted like chicken and ham. it wasn't even worth tring to see what i did wrong.

Delicious!  And not that hard to make, either.  I reccoment really pounding that chicken down or buying it tenderized.  The sauce is delicious!  And I didn't use all whipping cream, but instead 2/3 of it whipping cream and 1/3 lowfat milk.  you could probably sub more.

This was FANTASTIC!! I used 2 slices of thin ham on each piece of chicken though. I also seasoned the chicken and sauce with Slap Ya Mama. My husband and son went back for seconds and had each 2 chicken breasts! He said it was a KEEPER for sure.

Amazing recipe!! I have made this a couple of times now.  The sauce is a perfect compliment to the chicken without being too rich.  I suggest a high quality smoked ham for the best flavor.  I made this for a dinner party and changed a few things up because I couldn't fit the amount of breast I need into one stove top pan.  After browning the breast I placed them in a glass pan and poured the wine/bouillon mixture on the chicken.  I baked it at 350 degrees for 20 minutes and it came out great.  I have made it with both ways of cooking it and they both taste great.

I registered with allrecipes.com just to review this recipe! This was the best dish I have ever ate let alone made. I customized it by putting all reviewer suggestions together. I only did 3 servings. I pounded the chicken probally 1/4" thick and put about 1tbs of dijon mustard in each. I used 1 slice of thick ham wrapped around 2 pieces of provolone. I tied it with cooking string and fried it in 3tbs of butter and 3tbs of extra vigin olive oil on med high 5 mins each side. Baked at 350 for 20 mins. I poured 1/4 of the butter/oil in a saucepan on med along w/ 1c chicken broth and 2ts of bouillon for about 9 mins with a lid then added a slice of provolone for 1 min. Then i added 2c of whipping cream(regular) and 2tbs of cornstarch and simmer for 5 mins and boil for 5mins until thick and poured it all in the pan with the chicken. It was AMAZING!!!

This was delish! Only change I made was using half and half instead of cream because all that butter made me feel guilty.  I only used 3 chicken breasts but kept the sauce at 6 servings.  I took what was left over, threw in some garlic and pepper and it made a fantastic cream sauce for my noodles the next day.  Amazing!

I love creamy dishes and especially cooking with wine. This was good except the chicken was not cooked inside. I would recommend baking the chicken after the browning. I also found the cornstarch to lump in the whipping cream. I'd dilute the cornstarch with a bit of water before mixing it in with the whipping cream. The sauce needs a dash of salt.

This is EXCELLENT! Really!  I made just a few minor changes based on suggestions of other reviewers. (Thanks!) I used chicken broth instead of white wine; I dipped the rolled chicken into an egg wash (with a little salt/pepper), then in flour, and back into the egg wash again before placing it into the skillet; and sprinkled a bit of basil in the sauce just before serving.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Delicious!  Thanks for sharing, Behr!

My husband said this is in his "top ten". Modifications I used include: flour mixture for dusting: reduce paprika to 3/4 tsp and added dash of rosemary leaves (fresh would be best). Liquid for simmering chicken: Used cooking Sherry and increased it to 3/4 cup, added 1/2 cup water and increased granular boullion to 2 tsp. After chicken simmered, removed to baking dish and placed in 375 oven for 10-15 min to improve appearance. Added sauted mushrooms to gravy (used can, would prefer fresh). Served with quartered sm. red potatoes with snow peas and red peppers in rosemary butter sauce and crescent rolls.

WoWoWoW!  Definitely the best chicken cordon bleu I've ever had. And that sauce ... omg! I used smoked paprika because that's what I had and I let it really brown in the skillet before adding the wine so I ended up with a delicious crusty brown-red exterior and melted swiss I whisked into the sauce. Thank you so much, this goes in the repertoir

I saw all these 5 stars and thought Id give it a try...and now I can see why its 5 stars!  I have tried other recipes like this, and this one by far is the best! Love the sauce that goes over it! I did use more white wine than the recipe called for, and it was delicious. Thank you for this recipe!

My friend and her family were in town visiting us and I wanted to make something special for her. She LOVES chicken cordon bleu so I said why not give it a try?! Thank goodness I did!!! She helped me prep while I did all the cooking and it was well worth the experience! This dish was awesome all around the table. Everyone cleaned their plates and when she got back home, she made the dish again for her husband who is in the Army!

I thought I would have trouble keeping the chicken together and the cheese inside, but it was really very easy! I used toothpicks because I couldn't find cooking string. Flavor was very good!

Unbelievable! This is definitely one of my  fave dishes. I used chicken cutlets (3 to equal one chicken breast), then cut up slices of deli ham and cheese into 3's. This way, you can use as appetizer or main dish. For heavy cream, I used 2/3 c. milk and 1/3 c. melted butter. I use smart balance spread instead of butter for health benefits. Otherwise, followed exactly. Dish was absolutely fabulous, unbelievable flavor and super moist chicken. I doubled the sauce to have extra, and microwaved some peas to throw in there. Great! Will make again.

I used provolone instead of swiss and it turned out even better. If you dont want to cook the chicken in the sauce, be sure to cut the amount of wine down if you dont want a strong wine taste.

I made a few mistakes when making this (I'm a beginner, ok?!), such as purchasing chicken tenders instead of breasts and somehow totally screwing up the sauce (it was thin and I was stirring it over low heat, then suddenly it became a big gloppy mess!), but it still ended up tasting delicious, if somewhat not as visually appealing!  I served it to my parents, who cleaned their plates--even my dad, who is rather picky.  My mom said that it tasted very gourmet.  I did add a bit of dijon mustard to the chicken before putting on the ham and cheese, as well as adding a slice of cheese to the sauce as others had recommended.  Will definitely attempt this again, hopefully with fewer errors!

Five stars isn't enough...this is beautiful and delicious. Personally, I like to use multi-grain bread crumbs for that extra crunch and finish them in the oven (last 1/2 of cooking). Use the smokiest ham (I used triple-smoked) and layer plenty of Swiss in there. A masterpiece.

This dish is simple, yet elegant. The taste was fantastic, and worthy of its name! I did make a few modfications though. I substituted chicken soup base (powder) and 35% cooking cream for the chicken bouillon granules and heavy whipping cream. I also used thick slices of salami instead of ham. I used processed Swiss cheese slices (though the real thing would have made it way better, next time!) and bacon slices to hold the breasts together. I used a moderately priced white wine (about $15 CAD). I used margarine instead of butter, about three heaping tablespoons. Next time I'll do the butter/olive oil combination for more flavour. I also melted an extra slice of the cheese while the sauce was cooking. I served this with some boiled veggies... blah. The sauce would greatly compliment some asparagus or spinach quite nicely, next time I'll use those instead. A definite keeper!

This just might be the best dish I've ever made!  Next time I will for sure pair it with asparagus & drizzle the white wine sauce over that as well.  I followed the recipe word for word except I used italian breadcrumbs to bread it and I added paprika to the crumbs before coating the chicken.

My husband LOVED this. I thought it was really good as well. The sauce is pretty rich and Icreamy, and I might look into a substitute for the wine next time. The smell of it cooking made me a little nauseous but that's probably just because I'm pregnant. Overall, this was a great meal and not that hard to prepare. It has been requested several times since I first made it.

I did not use wine or chicken broth as others suggested. I was to lazy to run to the store for either, so I used a can of beef broth and it still turned out amazing! Easy to make and great taste!!

I thought this recipe was awesome, I didn't change a thing, next time I would just increase the ingredients to make MORE sauce, because that was everyones favorite part,  It was great on potatoes too.

Loved this!  Had it at a friend's dinner, and had to try it at home!  Used turkey ham instead (don't eat pork), but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  My girlfriend made it for a date and she called it her "go get him" dinner!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe for Cordon Bleu is delicious! I made it last night and served it over "Dreamfields" low-carb linguine and steamed broccoli. It came out great. I used the half butter half olive oil recommendation from "chefsingledad" and added a buit more dry wine then called for. I think it made a big difference in flavor. Also I found that toothpicks nor string were necessary if you make sure to pound the meat to at least a 1/2" in thickness.  Enjoy!

The sauce was pretty bland.  Too much cream, not enough wine flavor.  Added a lot of salt to make it decent.  The sauce broke after I took it off the heat. I wouldn't make it again for myself.  I wanted something more flavorful but it tasted really plain.

great quality recipe like dining out but at home.  I made a few changes:  3 tbsp butter, not 6; for cream:  1/2 c. heavy whipping cream and 1/2 cup fat free half and half; instead of flour/paprika:  part italian bread crumbs and fry magic

We haven't had a meal this sumptuous in a long time. We've been looking for new recipes and I couldn't resist this one. It was easier to make than I thought. I also added breadcrumbs to the flour mixture and made twice the sauce. I substituted chicken stock instead of the granules (approx. 1/2 cup). My fiancé went crazy over this meal. It was excellent and we will be serving it at our next dinner party.

Really good.  My husband loved it and he is a VERY picky eater.  The only change I made was I used chicken broth instead of wine because I didn't have any.  Great recipe!

I wasn't sure how to rate this because of the change I made do to what we had on hand, but decided that it deserved 5 stars no matter how you make it :o)  YUM YUM YUM.  Always get compliments on it and my husband is always requesting it.  I omit wine and bullion and just use chicken broth instead.  It doesn't take the 30 minutes to cook as stated, more like 10 to 15 I'd say.  My mouth is watering just thinking about this gravy... yum.  It's a keeper!!!

My picky family really enjoyed this meal.  I made a few modifications however.  After dipping the chicken in the flour mixture, I dipped it in melted butter and then in seasoned bread crumbs and baked it in the oven.  This made it neccesary to change the sauce recipe, using only a shot of red wine, since I had no white, and using milk and sour cream instead of heavy cream. The sauce was not a great success so sticking to the recipe in that area would be safer.  I do think extra seasoning on the chicken and thicker ham and cheese slices would have made this a 5 star recipe for me.

Nice Dish. Changed up just a bit. No wine, instead used a can of chicken broth. also didn't have any corn starch, but flour worked just fine.also just used 2% milk instead of cream. The sauce was still every bit as rich & the entire can of broth allowed there to be plenty of sauce which was great over top of the mashed potatoes. all the kids ate their entire meal! Going in the rotation.

Fantastic.  My husband is so fussy and he said it is one of the best dinners I ever made.  I followed another user's review and floured (with paprika and garlic powder), brushed with egg and then breaded with seasoned breadcrumbs.  I cooked it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes and then made the sauce separate and spooned over before serving.

Turned out good! I doubled the sauce, as many recommended. Great sauce! I also browned the chicken first then baked it while I cooked my sauce separately. I used provalone cheese instead of swiss and used smoked ham from the deli. First I covered in flour, then egg and then Italian bread crumbs. My boyfriend would have preferred my bread crumbs.  I've never had Chicken Cordon Bleu. I'd probably make it again.

Edit: I'm about to make this meal for the 5th time but for my parents this time! I now only cook this meal as the original person created it and I double the sauce and serve with mashed potatoes. This is and excellent recipe!

WOW that was fun!  Just served this to a dinner party and everyone raved about it. And if you're wondering if you can make this ahead of time, it works out fine.  Just stop at the point where you've cooked the chicken in the wine. Cool then refrigerate.  About 15 minutes before you serve: reheat chicken/wine sauce, then remove chicken and make the sauce.

I loved this chicken cordon bleu but found the white wine sauce was a bit too wine tasting...I would prefer more of a white gravy taste....maybe I'd use half chicken broth half wine...

I prepared this dish for my husband and friends and they and I were very impressed :) I made a few changes:  I used twine (no toothpicks), 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter versus (vs. all butter), breadcrumbs (no flour), 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 half & half (vs. all HC), after browning in skillet, I baked chicken in oven at 350 for 20 mins, and I added fresh chopped basil right before serving and it really was just icing on the cake! I served chicken over white rice and broccolli (next time I will do asparagus instead).

Excellent and really easy. We don't use the cream in the sauce as we have milk allergies. We substitute with Almond milk and it is still very tasty!

I also made an account just to review this fantastic dish. I am a horrible cook and was able to make this dish very easily. It looks a lot tougher than it is. Ive made it three times already and the main thing I need to remember is the importance of pounding the chicken thinner. It always looks done before it is. The sauce is also amazing and i wouldnt change a thing! Thank you very very much!

Very tasty...Made a little changes.. I added half a chicken buillon and a tablespoon of lemon juice to the heavy cream and cornstarch to give it flavor. I felt it was to bland.  I double everything so I can have extra sauce.  I added mushrooms once the sauce was done and added to the chicken.  LEt it stand for 5 mins and serve.

I literally signed up for an account just so I could add my rating to this recipe. It's delicious! And so easy! I'm comfortable enough in the kitchen, but was nervous to make this dinner for a date, since I'd never made it. Added roasted potatoes and broiled asparagus as sides, we ended up dipping everything in the sauce because it was so good. I made as directed, with no changes to the recipe, except to scale down the number of servings.

Delicious chicken!  This recipe's a keeper.  I followed the directions and I fried the chicken, but the insides were still pink so I popped it in the oven till the insides were cooked.

If I could give this recipe 10 stars I would.  I have made chicken cordon bleu many times before but the sauce absolutely makes the difference...so easy but so flavourful.  A great easy recipe to impress friends, clients or even bosses. Yum Yum!!!

Wow it was decadent and we loved it.  I was asked when we were having it again for dinner and how hard was it to make because this one was a repeat.  It was easy to make and although it was not in the least bit "light fare" it was an enjoyable indulgence.  I did not change anything except I just used regular table white wine, not dry white wine.  Everything else was perfection.

Very good, my husband loved it.  I was a little skeptical about using the wine.  I didn't know what to use so I just bought the cheapest bottle at Walmart (It wasn't cooking wine, just regular) and I really loved the flavor it gave the sauce.  I added extra ham and cheese, but thats just preference.  I will make this again.

Oh Yes! This was packed with flavor and very easy to make. My husband and four young kids devoured it and said it's a "keeper"! The only changes I made were using half butter and half olive oil, (instead of all butter), and using chicken broth instead of white wine. Just fantastic!  Be sure to steam fresh broccoli with this. It's Oh So Good with the cream sauce!

Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful! I give this recipe 5 stars.  I followed it exactly as the  directions said.  Only thing I did was double the sauce.  Made pan fried asparagus in butter with salt and pepper and white rice.  Slice chicken laid on top of rice and put sauce on top. It was so good we had it two nights this week.

I cooked my boyfriend a 3-course meal  last weekend and this recipe is one of the dishes I made. I wanted to try this myself since chicken cordon bleu is one of my favorites! I made it exactly as directed and it turned out great! My boyfriend loved this the most among the other dishes I prepared for him. Being a cheese lover, I wasnt contented with the Swiss cheese alone. I also added mozzarella on the cream sauce. Perfect for our tastebuds! I'll definitely make this again.

I love this recipe, and it is so easy to make!  I have made it twice now, and both times it has been delicious...the second time I added more milk(instead of cream)and cornstartch because I wanted a bit more sauce to cover my chicken...it was an easy fix and still so yummy!

This was so delicious - I made it for my husband for Valentine's Day and we loved it.  I did add extra breading to my chicken rolls (flour, egg wash, then bread crumbs), then I browned the rolls in a pan with the butter and removed them from the pan to a baking stone and baked them for 20 minutes at 350 degrees.  I then made the sauce in the pan I added the chicken bouillon granules and the cooking wine I had in my pantry and let that simmer for about 5-10 minutes then I added the cream mixture and stirred in until it thickened and let it simmer until the chicken was cooked.  I couldn't believe that I had cooked this dish, it tasted better than the chicken cordon bleu I have had in a restaurant.  I served it with fresh bread, mushroom rice pilaf from this site, and steamed asparagus.  I can't wait for another opportunity to make this again.

Made this for 75 people at a church function.  Nothing but rave reviews.  I followed other reviews and made the sauce on top of the stove and finished baking in the oven, also used half olive oil and butter for sauteeing and a 1 to 1 ratio of heavy cream and half and half in the sauce.

My husband and I had this for dinner this evening.  Very easy, and very nice. The wine sauce was great, but there was something missing, and I just could not put my finger on it. Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

Fantastic. The white wine cream sauce was easy and everyone was very impressed! Family loved it. Hubby doesn't like chicken and he said I could make this anytime.

My family was so impressed with me, made me look like a real chef, lol!! I did follow suggestions of others, like 3tbl spoons butter and 3tbl spoons evoo, doubled the sauce, which was amazing!!I did use a three part breading for the chicken, first flour,paprika, second egg, third bread crumbs, then I browned the chicken and baked it like the others suggested. I made the sauce in the same pan I browned the chicken and when the chicken was done I poured the sauce over it!! Yummmmm...sooooo good!!!

Excellent!!  Hubby made it for dinner tonight and everyone in my family is in agreement that it was great!  We used deli sliced ham and 2% milk instead of cream and it is still  a 5 star recipe. This will be a regular at in our household now.  :D

The best Cordon Bleu I have ever made! I served it with mashed potatoes and topped it all with the yummy sauce. We live in Germany right now and this is just as good as what we get in the restaurants. Our picky 6 and 4 year old daughters even liked it and that itself says a lot. I now have a new meal to add to our rotation.

This was great.  Very different than I had done Cordon Bleu's in the past, but I will definitely be trying this again.  I had a little trouble with the floor mixture, so I'll probably be coating the chicken in egg first next time.  The wine sauce is excellent!

Made it today for my picky husband and he loved it. I loved it too but it is rich for me considering my diet is usually bland. The sauce was excellent and couldn't be easier to make  The only thing I changed was I used paprika with Italian flavored bread crumbs.  I am sick of making the same thing all the time so thanks for this great recipe.

This was fantastic. Super easy to make, and turned out wonderful. * I didn't have any white wine so I used vegetable broth with about a tablespoon of cooking sherry.

FANTASTIC!  Definitely double the sauce.  I pound the chicken flat & roll with ham & swiss BUT forget the toothpicks.  Use the metal poultry skewers for whole turkeys or chickens.  They're easy to see & slide right out.  I'll never use toothpicks again. Thanks for a fabulous recipe.

I thought this was very good. My husband devoured it and said it was one of the best meals I've made in a long time. I only cooked the chicken for about 25 mins b/c we had somewhere to go and were in a hurry. But I still thought it was a little dry...will definitely make this again as my husband can't stop talking about it!

Absolutely delicious.  I took others advice and used 3 tbsp butter & 3 tbsp olive oil.  Also used Half & Half instead of full cream.  Used low fat regular ham.  Came out wonderful.  Even the kids liked it!!!  Will use again.

This recipe is absolutely awesome.  I made a couple changes.  I added bread crumbs and a little dried thyme to the flour/paprika mixture.  I melted butter in a baking pan in the oven.  Then, I just coated the chicken rolls with the melted butter, and rolled them in the bread crumb/flour mixture.  Then, I baked them in the pan I used to melt the butter.  I baked them at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes.  When they were done, I made the sauce in a saucepan on the stove, using a Pinot Grigio because that's what I happened to have on hand.  I mixed together the wine, heavy cream, a little cornstarch, and the chicken boullion.  I cooked it over a medium low heat until it thickened. After I poured the sauce over the chicken, I thought it looked a little pale, so I sprinkled on just a little more paprika and some dried parsley for color.  I had never made cordon bleu before, but I will be making this often from now on.  It's a great company dish.  The sauce was just delicious, however, next time I think I'll only use about half of the cornstarch called for. Mine turned out just a bit thicker than I would have liked.  Great recipe!!

WOW this was great!!! I was skeptical about making Chx Cordon Blue on the stove top but it was fab! One suggestion is to cut down the cooking time after you add the wine. Chicken is safe to eat at 170 degrees - I would take the chicken off then to save some of the cheese in the middle (overcooking it will melt all of the cheese out of the roll) and to ensure it doesn't get to dry.

I only made the chicken and not the sauce because my husband and I are on a diet.  It still came out very tasty.  I took the advice of others and used both butter and oil in the pan and bread crumbs instead of flour.  I butterflied the breasts, and placed a ham wrapped piece of chees in the middle and then sealed with a toothpick.  Worked well.

I have made this several times, it is has ALWAYS gotten rave reviews.  It is so amazingly good.  The one thing I change is that in addition to the swiss cheese, I also add a slice of meunster.   What stays inside of the chicken adds richness (yes, even more) and what doesn't melts into the sauce making it even creamier.  If it weren't for the calories and fat, I would make this weekly!

This is one of the best recipes I've tried with my family. I have a few picky eaters and was surprised when everyone enjoyed it. The sauce is a great addition and I used it with the asparagus I cooked on the side.

Delicious!! I had actually never had cordon bleu before I made this recipe for my boyfriend, who was a big cordon bleu fan. So without even knowing how it was supposed to turn out it turned out wonderful and was so so tasty and won the approval of Jacob.

This is very good.  My husband swooned over it--cordon bleu is one of his favorites.  As for me it was very good, but not to-die-for.  I didn't add the cornstarch--didn't need it, and I try to avoid thickeners whenever possible.  I will be making this again.

This is a delicious recipe.  The only change I made was using a little olive oil mixed with the butter to keep it from becoming too dark.  My family loved this and I will be making it again for company.

This is my fav chicken recipe.  I sliced a hole in the chicken from the top to the bottom, and stuffed it with the cheese rolled inside the ham.  I love the flavor the white wine adds.  Thanks for posting this delicious recipe!

This was superb! Easy to do with all of the ingredients on hand, but I think would be expensive otherwise.  My husband wants me to cook this for any company we have in the future. I served it with wheat buns, salad, peas and asparagus (we have picky eaters when it comes to green food).

As for modifications:
I used my leftover spiral ham from New Years for the middle. I pounded my chicken down to 1/2" thickness. I folded the chicken over in half over the ham and cheese, and it worked fine.   I baked it in the oven in a 13x9 glass pan @ 350' for 30 min. I then added the wine mixture and covered it with foil for 20 min. I then transferred the chicken to a plate, added the cream mixture and thickened on the stove top. BIG HIT!

It didn't turn out good for me.  I was really disappointed because I have made Chicken Cordon Bleu in the past that was amazing, and this one just didn't work for me... I'll go back to my old recipe for now.

this was so good. The sauce really made the dish. I would suggest making extra sauce just because it is so wonderful. As one reviewer did, I baked the chicken after browning it, and then poured the sauce over the chicken to serve.

This is very flavorful and delicious. However, I followed the recipe and left the chicken in the pan to simmer. During that process most of the cheese melted out of the chicken and into the sauce. This would have been fine except that it added a whole bunch of fat to the sauce you make at the end. The fat separated out and ruined the look of the sauce. Next time I'll try another reviewer's suggestion and make the sauce completely separate from the chicken. I also cooked the chicken for 30 minutes, which was much too long. Bottom line, good flavor and pretty presentation once you learn proper preparation.

great recipe, I made some changes to make it healthier. first I only fried for a few minutes then I baked for about 30 min. used egg and bread crumbs instead of flour. I skipped the cheese and instead of cream I used soy milk. I also added mushrooms to cream and wine mixture and puoured it over after chicken was done. thanks for recipe

This was absolutely fantastic.  I used Provel cheese (if you life in St. Louis) or provolone is close and pastrami in half because my husband hates ham.  Both the ham and pastrami were great.  I followed the recipe almost exactly adding a bit extra salt and pepper to chicken so not too bland.  Awesome recipe.  I rarely give a recipe 5 stars, but this is well worth it.

Good recipe, but I would tweak a couple of things for a healthier meal.  Leave out the flour bit and simply season the chicken with salt, pepper, and paprika and brown in pan.  Leave out the bouillon cube, add a little bit more wine, then substitute the heavy cream with chicken stock and you have yourself a simple, lean, yummy dish!

When you make something and your husbands first words are "OH MY GOD"!  It is a tremendous compliment to me since I am usually over the top on all my meals.  I've made cordon bleu many times, not with THIS SAUCE!! I only altered adding mushrooms and onions shortly before covering and removing the chicken.  I also added a touch of extra seasoning to the flour mixture.  Did use Chardonnay. HE JUST LOVED IT AND I JUST LOVE COOKING AN AWESOME MEAL FOR HIM, SO THANK YOU FOR THE NEW SAUCE RECIPE!! The chicken is the same to what I've been doing for years. ANOTHER HINT : WHEN YOUR HUSBAND TELLS YOU TO MAKE SURE YOU KEEP THAT RECIPE, YOU KNOW IT'S GOOD!

I used the changes made by another reviewer and used 3 TBSP olive oil to replace some of the butter.  Pounded the chicken to 1/2 inch, and put chopped basil in the sauce.  Also topped the dish with basil for color and flavor.  VERY nice recipe!  I served it with Broccoli and Ramen Noodle Salad, also on this site.

Great Recipe. I took the suggestions from other reviews and dipped the stuffed breast in egg and bread crumbs then pan fried before placing on a oven sheet to bake for 15 minutes at 350. Before placing chicken in the oven I prepared the sauce adding fresh rosemary and thyme then poured over the chicken. Very tasty and the presentation is impressive! I will serve this dish over and over again!

This sounds like the recipe I use. I haven't tried this recipe yet but have a suggestion. Instead of using toothpicks, I find that cotton or cooking thread works better. Just roll or fold over the chicken and tie it like you would a package. This way your guests aren't digging around in the chicken for the toothpicks but can rather untie and the string will come right off.

I like the twist of this recipe from the traditional as well as the ease. Make sure your chicken breasts aren't too thick as it makes it difficult to toothpick together and takes a lot longer to cook. Expect it to take a bit more time that noted. Still very easy and yummy.

This recipe has turned into one of my Classics...it is so easy.  I do leave out the sauce.  I found a "Blender Hollandaise" that is awesome on this site. Also, when I get my breast from the grocer, the butcher dept. tenderizes/pounds them out for me thru their machine, which makes it even easier. I have made it several times for friends, everyone LOVES it!  Thanks

Amazing. Even my 2 boys ages 10 & 12 ate this up. Loved it. I followed some of the reviews and put mine in the oven after browning and simmered the sauce and spooned on after we plated the chicken. Great recipe we loved it will make it again.

This was an excellent recipe.  We have a ceramic (glass) cooktop stove and I'm not much of a cook but this recipe turned out great.  I already had Holland brand white cooking wine (the kind that they sell in the grocery stores) so I used that.  The cream sauce at the end was so good and there was enough left over that I poured it on the rice that I made with this meal.  It was delicious!  Thanks for a great recipe.

I gave this recipe 5 stars even though I made a couple of minor changes, because the changes didn't affect the flavor at all. I was just trying to lower the fat a little bit! I browned the chicken bundles in olive oil instead of butter, and I used milk instead of heavy whipping cream. Excellent flavor, terrific recipe, and nobody (myself included) could tell it was a lower fat version! A keeper for sure.

I made it with 2 changes, I didn't have any white wine in the house, imagine that, so I used Chicken stock instead. And I used a combination of butter and olive oil. DELICIOUS! Thanks.

This recipe is awesome! I have made it many times and always with great success. I chop my ham and use shredded swiss cheese.  When making fold sides towards center and then roll and this will eliminate the oozing of the cheese.
I paired this with cream of asparagus soup, a nice green salad and a baked potato.

This was messy to make but not difficult.  The chicken itself was very bland. Next time I will definitely have to salt and pepper it. All the cheese came out and into the sauce. The sauce is the only thing that makes this chicken good.

This was incredible.  It actually freezes well too, but my suggestion is use a good chardonnay.  I used Kendall Jackson which made it great.  I also used half and half, not heavy whipping cream.  Perfect recipe...

This is a great recipe! I was out of bread crumbs AND flour, so I used crushed up croutons to coat the chicken and it was still delicious! Definitely try this if you are sick of your same old, same old chicken recipes. Amazing!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! The sauce was the best I have ever had in my life. It was like a gormet super-rich chicken gravy. I plan to try to make the sauce with ANY chicken recipe. I may even see if beef boullion can be used in order to make it for beef dishes. This was very easy as well. I'll be making this on a regular basis!

Absolutely perfect!!!  Only thing I did different was use mozz. string cheese instead of swiss cheese so it didn't melt into the sauce.

This recipe is awesome, and easy. I use a large cast iron skillet to smash the breast down into thinner pieces, and use Ken's Honey Mustard Dressing as the sauce.

It will probably take me some more practice to get them to seal up a little better so that the ham and swiss are better contained, but overall it had a very nice flavor.  I will likely make this again!

This was delicious..I recommend doubling sauce & also cooking separately if you like a crispy breast..definitely wrap the cheese in the ham as another suggested, as this keeps it from leaking out.

I made this for a few friends tonight and they loved it. I did look at the comments, took some of the advice and put it to good use. I doubled the amount of sauce made and added a little Chili Powder (about 1-1.5 tbs) to add some more flavor. I also baked the chicken after sautéing it in the butter for a few minutes (~33 minutes). I must say this is a great recipe and I'll definitely make it more often in the future. I served it on top of rice and with asparagus. :-)

This is the best Chicken Cordon Bleu I have ever made.  The only change I made was adding a pinch of nutmeg and salt and pepper to the flour mixture.  Absolutely perfec!!  The sauce was the perfect addition.  Thanks!

This was good, but everyone around me thought it was great. My dad especially raved about it. I put the cheese in between two slices of ham so that it wouldn't melt into the sauce. But I didn’t want to use thinly sliced deli ham because it’s too salty and doesn’t have the same great taste, so I used good quality thickly sliced ham. But instead of using two thickly sliced pieces of ham in between cheese which would be too "hammy", I used one good quality piece of ham and added a thin sliced piece of deli ham on top of it and that was enough to hold the cheese in. It came out great and it didn’t affect the taste at all. And since most of the cheese is held in the chicken, I melted one more slice of cheese into the sauce mixture. Also, I didn’t have white wine so I highly suggest using half white wine vinegar and half water. Can’t taste the difference. Delicious.

OMG! I wish I could rate this higher than a 5! I have made this about 30+ times over the last 2 years and I freaking love this recipe. It is fantastic! My idea of heaven on a plate. I usually pair with mashed potatoes or rice but honestly it's so good, you don't even need anything else with it. The sauce is what makes the recipe. THANK YOU!!!!!

Delicious..even without the wine. Used chicken broth instead. It came out great. Next time will use the wine.

This was just SUPER DUPER. I used italian seasoned panko crumbs in addition to the flour/paprika mix, and I coated the entire chicken breast before rolling them up. I used half olive oil, half butter, and added a little chopped garlic. I didn't have problems with the toothpicks, but I couldn't get them to roll up, so it was more like "folding" them and sticking in the t-picks to close up the ends. I accidentally started cooking the chicken in a pan that didn't have a lid to fit over everything, so after browning, I transferred the chicken to my little Oster oven and baked for about 15 min at 250 F to make sure it cooked all the way through. The last few minutes while baking, I cooked some asparagus in the wine/butter/olive oil and removed them before adding the cream/corn starch to the pan to finish the sauce. I had doubts about the sauce, but wow... it was so good.

This recipe is Excellent!  It was definitely restaurant quality.  I did decide to use an egg wash and bread crumbs, but followed the rest of the recipe.  I love the sauce!  Will definitely make again.  My 8 yr old tore it up!!

This recipe is fabulous!!!!  My children loved it!  The only thing I changed was I used 3 tbsp of butter and 3 tbsp of olive oil and I used panko breadcrumbs.  My family eats chicken but I try not to eat too much meat, so I also made this with extra firm tofu .... delicious!!! Of course I didn't stuff it, I breaded it and cooked it accordingly.

Very Good! I did have a problem with a couple of the chicken rolls unrolling. I didn't have my pan hot enough, and when I tried to turn the chicken, it stuck to the pan and unrolled. Will definitely make this again!

Made it for my roomates a little while back. It was proclaimed "really good" by all. Assembling the chicken is a little tricky, so its not a recipe I would enjoy making often. But it sure is tasty (and dare I say, elegant?)

I followed the recipe and it turned out delicious.  The wife ate it up and she is usually picky about food.  I would suggest getting fairly big chicken breast that way after you pound them out you can easily fold them over the ham and cheese.  Make this recipe at least once!!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this chicken!  Make it exactly as is, and you will be in heaven. The sauce is amazing, so make sure you take advantage of that and serve egg noodles or other pasta along with the chicken.  I haven't tried it, but it would probably also be fantastic with mashed potatoes.

Awesome!  I made for the first time for company (usually not a good idea) but it worked perfectly.  Rave reviews.  I had a lot left over so I chopped it up and put it in the crockpot the next day to make chicken corn chowder.  I used the gravy as the base and added corn, sauteed onions, chicken stock, and chopped chicken.  It was soooo yummy!  This is a great recipe.  Thanks so much!

This recipe is quickly becoming a favorite of mine. Everyone whom I have cooked it for absolutely loves it. I've had to scale the portion size down on occasion as it tends to be a very rich dish. This is a wonderful recipe.

Really, really good, but a little too rich.  I think next time I'll reduce the butter and use olive oil (thanks to a reviewer for the idea)
But, the sauce was delicious!

Awesome.  Used breadcrumbs, a little more wine and seasoned the chicken breasts first.  Started in Pan and then put in the oven. Used a little extra ham and cheese and held together with dry pasta. Sooooo good!

Delicious!! My husband and I loved this meal, it was relatively easy to put together (I think I'll tie the chicken next time, toothpicks are kind of a pain). Didn't change a thing other than making a little extra sauce. We'll definitely have this again!

So, I made this again today for the second time.................................... ..........................................This time I used pancetta(Italian bacon) in place of Ham. I think it is much better with pancetta. I used 2 thinly sliced pieces of pancetta and 1 piece of swiss cheese(DO NOT use the American singles swiss cheese....use the REAL swiss cheese) for each half piece of chicken breast.....................................................................................................................I  used 1/2 cup WATER instead of wine, and I added 2 teaspoons of the chicken bullion granules..........................................................................To increase the volume of suace,I added 2 cups(16 oz) of heavy whipping cream with 1 1/2 tablespoons corn starch and I added 1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic.....................................................................................................................Two minutes before remove the sauce from the heat I added 1/4 teaspoon ground NUTMEG and 1 added the chicken pieces to the sauce.............................................................................The garlic and NUTMEG adds amazing flavour to this great dish
..........................................................................................REMOVING THE TOOTHPICKS..use the Kitchen Scissors to pull them out. They come out much more easily.

Yum!!!  I added salt and pepper to the chicken before the flour.  I wanted to double the sauce so I made the following changes.  I browned the chicken using 3 tablespoons of butter and 3 olive oil.  I used 1/2 cup of white wine and 1/2 cup chicken broth.  I slowly whisked in 1 and 1/2 cups of heavy cream with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch.  The sauce was delicious.  My family loved this meal.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was really good.  I didn't even have ham, just used reduced fat swiss cheese.  I made a little more sauce, as recommended, and ended up using 2 chicken bouillon cubes.  My husband loved it and kept commenting.  Thank you!

We loved this recipe, we didn't have swiss so we used Provolone cheese, it was sooo yummy. For the wine we used Pinot Grigio and it was fabulous! Even my 3 year old liked this one. We served this meal with white Jasmine rice that I cooked with 1 cup water and 1/2 cup of wine (pinot grigio) and 1 tsp of chicken boullion seasoning, and served with Green beans. This was fabulous! Don't pound the chicken too hard or too thin, it will fall apart. Also, big WARNING HERE -- DO NOT USE COLORED TOOTHPICKS OR THE CHICKEN WILL ABSORB THE COLOR FROM THE TOOTHPICKS. OUR CHICKEN TURNED GREEN FROM THE GREEN TOOTHPICKS.

Thanks for this recipe, it will be a regular weekly meal in our home from now on.

If there would be a 100 star rating, this one gets all stars!!!! I made this exactly as is (other than changing out the swiss cheese for provolone). It was easy to make, the chicken was tender and the taste of it all together with the sauce was so flavorful and rich. This is a keeper for sure! This is one of the best recipes I have made from this site.

The family loved this recipe and it was so easy. The only substitution I made was not use the wine and used chicken broth. The boys have their own favorite recipe books that will be theirs when they go out on their own. This will definitely find it's way into the boys recipe books. It will also stay in the family rotation.Thanks for an easy & delicious recipe.

Never made anything like this before, was little worried. Came out great!  Not for the picky eater but if you like this kind of thing, you'll love this and be supprised how easy it really is.  Special note: don't use colored toothpicks if you don't have to...the dye comes off even though the sauce covers it nicely.  Will practice this some more, next-time I'll make more sauce for on the side.

Followed the recipe exactly, except substituted some veg oil for 1/2 of butter.  VERY VERY Bland!  I couldn't believe how much flavor this dish lacked!  If I make this dish again I will definitely roll the chicken in a bread crumb and chicken seasoning mix.  I know that will add more flavor--but I don't recommend making it exactly how the recipe says.

This recipe was great! I used chicken cutlets and simmered for about 15 minutes instead of 30. Instead of using all butter, I chose to substitute half olive oil to cut back on the fat. The leftovers were even better the next day- I will definately make it again.

This was awesome, my family loved it and requested it again the following weekend. I made double the sauce so there was extra for mashed potatoes. This has earned a five star rating.

I didn't coat the chicken in flour, and i doubled the sauce.  To the sauce I added some more swiss cheese, and that really punched up the flavor.  Overall, really good!!

I did not have any toothpicks either but just rolled it tightly and baked the open side of the chicken down on the skillet first. For 2 of the chickens, I had some silver needle looking things (have no idea what they are called) that came with my turkey basting set and used those like toothpicks. I noticed my sauce looked different than the posted pics. I added the cornstarch and the whole milk (sub for cream) into the skillet with the remaining paprika/flour mix to make the gravy that is poured on top of the chicken. I would make this again, although it is more rich than I am use to  with Chicken Cordon Bleu recipes.

I know you have enough reviews of this recipe but have to say it is absolutely wonderful.  It was easy and not a bit time consuming.  Next time I will use kitchen twine to hold this together, I could not get the toothpicks out when ready to serve.

I followed this recipe to the letter -- usually we psuedo-chefs like to mix it up a lot, more than we realize!  But this was fantastic as is! The cream sauce tasted just like the chicken, literally - ham and cheese and chicken flavor!  Such a comfort food.  I was relived to not have to change the recipe! My few FAV!!

Awesome!! I am passing this one one to my family. I would recommend that if you are only making this recipe for two people that you cut down the recipe and not make the whole thing. I made the whole thing thinking that the left overs would be good, but the sauce wasn't very good the next day.

i did everything according to the recipe and it turned out Fantastic!! My husband and brother absolutely loved the sauce!! I agree with other reviewers if you flatten the chicken enough they take only 15-20 minutes to cook. i served them with garlic mashed potatoes and corn!

Wow, this is a must try recipe. The only things that I changed were instead of using white wine I used chicken broth (it's what I had on hand) and instead of rolling the chicken up I cut the chicken in half an layed the cheese& ham  in the middle(I find it be less of a hassle thsi way) and served with rice & broc. Try this recipe and you will not be sorry. Thank You

This was the bomb. It seems that we always make the heavy-duty rib sticking stuff and this was one indeed. Prep was pretty easy but I would make sure and pound the breast thin so they are easier to roll up. My only issue was the breading came off too easy and made moving the chicken while it was cooking or transferring to the plate tricky because it had a tendency to fall off.

My husband asked what the special occasion was!  I was just looking for something different for chicken breasts.  I used 3 chicken breasts, but didn't scale down the sauce.  The outside of the chicken has a nice brown color and was tender.

I made this recipe as is and loved it! I didn't tie rolls with string, but did insert two toothpicks per roll until browned on bottom side. Removed toothpicks, used tongs to turn rolls and they stayed together without the toothpicks. I rolled the ham and cheese up (cheese on the inside) and then placed on one end of the chicken breast and rolled chicken breast up. I will definitely make this again...and again...

This is amazing - and super easy!  I didn't have a couple ingredients called for and made substitutions (white zin for the white wine; fat free half and half for the heavy cream) and it was still yummy.

We would give this recipe more then five stars if we could!  The only chage we made was adding mushrooms on top.  Yummy.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

Oh. My. God. This was AMAZING. I scaled the recipe to 3 and made exactly as is except for the *tiniest* splash of sherry into the sauce at the end. I served it over a mushroom rice pilaf blend and -wow- my husband and my mom RAVED. RAVED! I am a novice cook and it was relatively painless. Will definitely add to my repertoire.

This was magnificent!  The only issue we had was the cheese melting out of the chicken.  If I could find a way to keep that from happening, this recipe would be perfect! :)  Everyone loved the sauce, too.

This was very, very good.  I made it as written.  Almost doubled the sauce, which is delicious!, but against better judgement, I didn't.  I have so much sauce left over.  Will surely make this again!

We enjoyed this recipe. I used spices breadcrumbs instead of the flour and it added some extra taste which was good. Cooking it in the wine also adds flavor. Will probably use it again

I liked this meal but it was a lot of prep since we had to pound our chicken thinner, good stress relief though!  I used one of the reviewer's tips and dips in egg and bread crumbs, fried in skillet with olive oil for 10 minutes then baked in oven for 20 min and made sauce separate and topped over chicken after baking, very good!

This was great... only change I made was that I breaded the chicken and then baked it instead.  The sauce was fantastic (I poured it over baked breasts just before serving).

Made this with left over ham from Easter.  Turned out wonderfully, doubled the sauce as other's suggested and rolled chicken in half Italian crumbs and half flour.  It was easy to make as I had everything on hand.  Will be adding to our dinner rotation!

Loved this! I made a few changes of my own. I coated the chicken in egg and then rolled in italian flavored bread crumbs with paprike sprinkled in. I used Swiss cheese and I double the sauce ingredients. I also used half and half instead of whipping cream! Turned out beautiful! Will definitely make again.

My husband thought this was the best chicken, I thought it was pretty good. I used lunch meat ham and next time I will use leftovers from a  spiral slice dinner ham. Very easy to make and a quick but elegant dinner. The sauce on top really adds a lot to this chicken.

The sauce is really what makes this recipe stand out from average chicken cordon bleu. Sometimes I use the sauce over asparagus instead of the chicken - vegetables have never gone so fast before.

For all the work I was expecting something excellent and this just wasn't. It was tasty but it had a lot of grease and took a lot of work to make. If it came out really good I wouldn't have minded it but I won't be making this again and still don't understand why it got 5 stars from so many people.

Very delicious! My husband and I loved it. It was really easy to make once I realized it would be easier to roll up if I wrapped the cheese in the meat first.

Fantastic.  Only things I changed were to scale down the whipping cream for the sauce, add garlic and oregano inside the wraps and salt and pepper the rolls before sauting.  Will definitely make again.

Amazing!  I made this on Thursday and I plan to make it again on Sunday!  I seasoned the flour a bit with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.  I also butterflied the chicken, layed the ham and cheese on the chicken, and then just rolled it.  Stuck 2 toothpics in and was done. Yes, some cheese came out, but it mixes in with the sauce.  Instead of pouring the sauce over the chicken, I dumped pasta into it and did it that way.  Next time, I won't use whipping cream, I will use table cream or milk.  I am sure I can find a recipe for a wine sauce that isn't SOOOO bad for me.  I can't wait to eat this again!  THANK YOU!!

Amazing recipe!!! I'm always looking for recipes for my super picky husband.  This was an absolute winner with him!!  He doesn't like ham, so I substituted salami.  I also doubled the sauce.

Although this recipe is not at all figure friendly, it is super good. The sauce that it makes is so good. My friend told me to double it and I was so glad that I did. It made all the more gravy to have with the left overs. When I do it again, I will cut the chicken breast even thinner and still pound it out. I think they would have cooked faster and more even. Excellent.

Excellent recipe!!!  It's a great company dish...elegant, but without the fuss.  I simmered the chicken in the wine as the recipe called for, but I made the cream sauce in a seperate pan with the cream and additional wine.

The recipe was fantastic, but I needed to make some procedural changes.  First I pounded the chicken breasts and breaded them, without the ham or cheese.  I then browned just the pounded, breaded breasts.  I didn't have a skillet large enough to cook all of them at the same time, so I put the browned chicken breasts into a large glass pan.  I poured  the liquid (I used chicken broth) into the pan with the chicken, then placed the  ham and cheese on top of the chicken and covered it with foil.  It then went into a 350* oven for 30 minutes.  When cooked through, I just poured the remaining liquid and bits back into the sauce pan to make the sauce.  All of the goodness without messing with toothpicks, slippery chicken and problems with small frying pans.

Made this last night with leftover ham and my husband and I loved it. I had the most difficulty rolling the breast tight, so used both toothpicks and string to hold it together. I wasn't confident that it would look good at the end, but after browning and serving with the sauce, it looked great. My pan was large, so I doubled the wine and bouillon. The gravy makes this recipe wonderful.

This was very good, but next time I would add extra cheese inside the chicken. Most of the cheese melted out while I was browning the breasts. Otherwise, awesome! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is excellent.  I have made it twice now and it is clearly one of my husband and I's favorites. One tip that I found was helpful was instead of using toothpicks I used the picks that come with a functional nutcracker set.  This really helps keep the chicken stay wrapped around the ham much more efficiently while maneuvering it.  I also substituted American cheese, instead of Swiss, and found it to come as even better.  I know I will be making this recipe for many years to come.

This was an exremely easy and elegant meal to put together. My adice though is to put together an assembly line before hand so you can avoid cross contamination. Very good recipe!!!!

Oh my gosh!  This stuff is awesome. This is the first time I've ever had chicken cordon bleu. This recipe is so easy to follow and the sauce is amazing. I did use only 3 tablespoons of butter and 3 tablespoons of olive oil. Very delicious! I will definitely make this again very soon.

OMG!!! Can I say amazing??? I let the chicken simmer in the wine/chicken mix for 20 minutes or so after I browned them and it was perfect. The sauce was extraordinary!  Thanks for a great recipe.  It will be in regular circulation at our house!

Wow, this recipe definitely lives up to the hype. I made it for my Mom, Dad, and sister and they all loved it. I did use less butter and a bit of wok oil(didnt have olive oil, would have used it if i had it) and flattened the breasts to 1/2 inch when preparing. You could put the sauce on an old shoe and still come back for more.

This was great, I took the advice of others and added Pinot instead and think I over did it because it was to "winey" tasting! Either way, it was great but I will do it exact the next time around.

This is a wonderful version of Cordon Bleu!  Very easy, tasty, and the chicken doesn't dry out.  Loved the fact that you needed only one pan for the entire dish.  I didn't have heavy cream and substituted half n half and the sauce was delicious.  The sauce makes the recipe!

De-licious! We made this for dinner despite my skepticism about how much a pain in the butt I expected it to be. Turns out, this was really very easy to make. The flavors in the sauce complement the chicken, ham, and cheese very well, and the sauce isn't too "winey," as I tend to find some wine sauces. It turned out very well and is a pretty goof-proof recipe.

very good and really pretty easy. I also did half and half butter/olive oil. I also pounded the chicken breasts to 1/2 inch thickness. Don't skimp on the cream - really makes it so good and of course rich.

The sauce for this dish is so rich and creamy.  Mmmmm!  I made this last night for my husband and daughter and just fell in love with it. My daughter, who is 3 years old, just gobbled it up. I had a little extra sauce left over, so I put it on some noodles because I just couldn't let it go to waste. I had a little trouble with the cheese melting out of the chicken, but the taste of the sauce made up for it!

I'll make extra servings next time! My husband said he wants this on our dinner menu every week! Thank you for bringing this recipe to our home!

Excellent recipe!!! Simple enough for a non-talented cook like me but tasted like it was a dish that was complicated to make. The ingredients used were also not unlikely to be in any normal kitchen which is an incentive to make it again and again.

I was looking for a chicken recipe and found this one.  I did not want the sauce and did not want to fry, so I pounded chicken, lightly breaded in egg and bread crumb, then stuffed with cheese and ham, baked until juices ran clear.  Wow, everyone loved it!

Excellent recipe. I cooked for New Years Eve dinner. Set them on a bed of Mashed Potatoes and a side of steamed butter garlic broccoli.  I did make some changes. I marinated my chicken breasts in Italian dressing over night. I also sandwiched a piece of swiss cheese between two slices of ham instead of one. I browned them on the stove and then placed them in the oven with skillet juices to bake when they were almost done I layered each chicken roll with one slice of ham and a strip of cheese. The chicken was amazingly tender and I loved the sauce so I doubled up on the cream. Will make again!!!!

There's really not much to be said for the recipe, except  that it's absolutely great! I found the cream sauce a bit heavy and will use light cream or half-n-half, but that's a minor thing.

FANTASTIC. A recipe I keep coming back to.  Easy to scale down for a weeknight meal, but I make it frequently when we have guests over for the first time. Wouldn't change a single thing.  DELICIOUS!

I've had your recipe since 2002.  I'm very sorry that I didn't give my opinion on it before.  It has a happy face on it, so that would have to stand for 5 stars.  I know I will always keep this recipe.  I thank you very much for it.

I saw this recipe when I had some whipping cream, but I used last minute substitutes.  I used monterey jack cheese for the swiss and chicken stock instead of the white wine and boullion cube.  It still was fantastic.  Will make again soon.

LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!!  Served this at a Birthday party for a VERY picky crowd (Dad and boyfriend who hate almost everything) and am still getting thank you emails and requests for the future.  I did subsitute bread crumbs for the flour, but other then that followed exactly.  I had a Pinot Grigot on hand, so that's the wine I used.  Also, I suggest to tie the chicken instead of securing with toothpicks.  It's much easier, and like another user said, it is very easy to lose the toothpicks.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

I was brave enough to try this recipe for Christmas dinner because so MANY people raved about it. It was true, it was terrific. Every plate was clean! I had to make at least 20 cutlets, so I had the butcher trim the fat and cut them very thin. This helped me out a lot, timewise. I made them in my electric fry pan which kept the heat even, and then I had more so I used frying pans for those. They all came out great and the rich sauce was the best! Thanks for the greatest recipe. 900 people can't be wrong! I can add the 11 people at my house who gave it 5 stars!

YUM - this was very tasty.  I liked the combination of the Swiss cheese and the wine sauce.  My 2 1/2 year old kept going "yum yum yum" as he ate it and my hubby said it was comfort food with a gourmet touch.  I used homo milk with extra cornstarch as I did not have whipping cream and it was still delish.  The only suggestions I have would be to strain the sauce before serving as there were bits of cheese and fried breading that made it lumpy and to use tongs or tweezers to help get the toothpicks out.  It was easier to prepare than I had thought...the instructions were very detailed which helped in the ease.

The only problem I had was not getting the chicken breast pounded out thin enough. I almost prefer to butterfly the chicken breast instead. Otherwise, this was pretty good.

This is seriously one of the best things I've ever eaten. Double the sauce, though, because it's GOOD!  I also add sliced baby portobello mushrooms into the sauce about 15 minutes after the wine, and everyone has loved this much more.  This is my most requested dish, and both my boyfriend and my daughter ask for it every time when I say "I'll make whatever you want".  I've also found you don't even really NEED the toothpicks to hold everything together.  They can be kind of a pain.  The middle will still stay inside, and no need to go searching for the dang things afterward.  Served with pasta, and the sauce is amazing over the noodles.  Just an incredible recipe...

WOW! This was soooo yummy! The wine sauce is so creamy and amazing! I was dipping my bread in it afterward. I know people suggest changes but I really think this recipe was perfect. I have to disagree with anyone who substituted out the wine because I think it makes the recipe.

Made recipe as is, although I improvised a little with toothpicks (as I had none), and so a few of the chicken got messy. This is (obviously) a very heavy meal, not one I'd make often. I ate one piece, though my roommates happily finished the rest up. Somewhat bachelor friendly.

It was fairly easy to follow although with the toothpicks holding it together it started browning a LOT quicker than I wanted. If I could start over again I'd minus the toothpicks and just slice basically a pocket into the chicken, then I would insert the Swiss wrapped with the ham first, makes it a lot easier to cook, I discovered it on the last breast to do that and that one was perfect. I used too much butter and so it was very greasy but that was my fault because I didn't want the chicken to burn but it was hard to cook them with the toothpicks. Took longer than I thought but all in all it was fairly easy to work with the recipe. I did the recipe exactly as it is except for the extra butter while cooking the chicken. Also my friend asked if I added "salt" and I said no and I'm guessing its from the Ham so maybe try a salt free ham or light or something to omit the salt taste.

My husband raved about this dish. It was a winner!  He asked me to be sure to make it again. I didn't bother with toothpicks, instead i just folded over the breasts.  This worked fine for me. I also added a tablespoon of evoo to the butter in the pan. Also, per the other review, I made my chicken breasts about 1/2" or thinner so I could get them done in about 15 minutes cook time rather than 30.

I used to make cordon bleu with just white wine and the cheese melting made it a bit thicker.  Since I found this recipe and started adding the cream and cornstarch, my husband and I have it every week or so.  What a difference the creamy sauce makes.

This was the best chicken I have ever made. My husband was very impressed and has now asked me to make it as a weekly meal.

I took a chance and made this for family one evening for a get together. Boy, was I glad! I was hoping there were enough seconds for myself, let alone everyone else. Great recipe and a good change for chicken.

Succulent and sooo easy to make. Making the chicken thinner does help alot with assembly. Saving this one to my recipe box!

Awesome recipe! This is the first time I've ever made chicken cordon bleu and I was so impressed with the ease of this recipe! I used Italian breadcrumbs instead of flour, Pinot Grigio and because I didn't have any cornstarch, I just used a little bit of flour to thicken the sauce--it was incredible!  Very tasty! My husband loved it!  Next time I'll use a bit more Swiss cheese just b/c I love the flavor it adds, but otherwise-5 stars all the way!

This was a big hit!! I followed the recipe as is, but used cooking wine instead of regular white wine. It was wonderful. I will be adding this into our regular family meals!! Thanks for the recipe!

This was beyond 5 stars.  I didn't and I wouldn't change a thing. Well maybe one thing.  I am used to rolling my chicken up instead of folding over so I did that.  I used Yellow Tail Chardonnay.  If some of the cheese melts out, that's even better.  It adds to the sauce.  This will be served at our next dinner party.

The only reason i even gave it 4 stars was because my husband gave it 5, while i only think its about a 3.  The chicken its self was good, but the sauce in my opinion was not good.  Maybe it was my selection of wine, but i did not change a thing.  I probally would not make this again, but who knows.

Holy moly, I have never tasted anything so wonderful in all my life!
This is a VERY easy recipe and it is gormet all the way.  The only change I made was to use Holland House White cooking wine and used Half and Half instead of heavy cream.  My 7 year old (and very picky) daughter would eat this every night if she could!

I think cooking the chicken in the sauce makes the chicken soooo tender & moist. I would think cooking in the oven, even partially, would make the chicken dry. What do I know. I followed the recipe to a tee and it came out delicious.

if there were six stars to give, this recipe would have earned them.  easy, aromatic, complex, and tasty!  I would serve these to company.  they can keep warm, covered, while the sauce reduces and thickens, and then the hot sauce gets the chicken back up to serving temp.  incredibly good and surprisingly turnkey!

Excellent. Made double the sauce and added some leftover Swiss to the sauce. My biggest problem was folding/rolling the chicken breasts. Next time I will definitely pound them.

My friend and I made this and we took the advice of using half of the heavy cream and we didnt have white wine so we used chicken broth instead. It was really good just next time we will season the chicken with salt and pepper before browning them.

I've never had Chicken Cordon Bleu before making it tonight for dinner and I LOVED it!! My husband loved it too, so this is definitely a keeper in our home!  I didn't change anything in the recipe, however next time I think I'll try a different cheese like another viewer mentioned. Also, instead of pounding the chicken I bought Perdue Thin Sliced Chicken.  They are very thin, easy to roll, and cook quicker too!  Thanks for the recipe!

Yum,Yum!! This is a excellent recipe!! The sauce is what makes this recipe different from others. I did add a little pepper and parsley to the sauce once it was completed, and before pouring over the chicken. My sauce didn't seperate as others had mentioned. I used 4" bamboo skewers to hold my chicken together. I also cut the chicken in half,(width wise),instead of pounding. This way made it easier to wrap the chicken. This is going in my recipe box!! My husband loved it! Thanks for a great, easy, quick recipe!

This was very good. I had plenty of sauce, since I only made three. The sauce was very good, but I do not care much for wine, so I will try it with chicken broth the next time. Also, I would tie the chicken next time instead of putting the toothpicks in it.

The flavor was excellent! Will make again...made extra sauce and it was great...  Had trouble securing the chicken though, and then couldn't get the toothpicks out...so the family had to cut around them..I think i used 4-5 on each to close... does anyone have any hints on how to better secure the breasts?  Thanks...

Incredibly good and felt like a "fancy' meal but was very easy. I made it one evening for my family (including a 4 year old) and everyone loved it.   I used half/half instead of whipping cream and worked well.

Finally getting around to reviewing this recipe!  Excellent.  Made this for Thanksgiving last year for my husband's family, it was gone instantly.  Since then, I've used various other fillings, Prociutto (sp?) ham, asiago cheese, Cooked bacon, and many more.  The key is making sure the cheese is a strong one.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for my neighbors and they said it was good.  I did not try it because I don't eat meat, but it smelled delicious. I substituted half & half. I have to say that 6 tablespoons of butter was too much, the chicken seemed to be poaching in butter and the sauce was extremely oily looking when it was prepared. I should have poured off most of the grease, but I didn't, so I ended up trying to blot the big greasy areas with paper towels.  Smelled wonderful, tasted "good" to my neighbors and looked very greasy that's why I gave it 4 stars.

This recipe is awesome! I was very surprised! I made it thinking I would hate it. Then I saw all the reviews and thought wow this many people liked it. I probably will too. 
 Key to sauce is blending in the cornstarch with the whipping cream before pouring it in to the pan so you have no lumps. You may consider adding a little pepper to the sauce maybe a dash of salt. Try before adding as everyones tastes are different.
In fact it was so good I had the left over for breakfast.

YUMMY! I made this recipe a few nights ago, the whole family loved it and I am craving it again today! Thank you for the recipe! The only changes I made was to dip in egg before the flour and I added more seasonings to the flour than just the paprika. Thank you again!

Big hit with the whole family!  I only had light cream on hand for the sauce, but it came out perfect anyway.  Definitely a keeper.

This recipe was fantastic!  I added some garlic powder, salt, and pepper to the flour mixture and I ended up having to double my wine.  I used half and half instead of cream (didn't have it on hand) and I did not need to use the cornstarch.  The flour from the chicken thickened it up perfectly.  This one is definitely a keeper!

I thought this was really good-a lot of work-but good. This sauce is what really makes this, but my husband didn't care too much for it, so thus the four star rating.

Fabulous!!!  I followed the directions exactly except for using white cooking wine. It was perfect. I made it for my sisters birthday dinner, and everyone loved it including the kids. It was the sause that made it. Incredible, but even though it was simple to make, definately a meal I'd only make for special occations due to the calories.  Five stars, EXCELLENT!!!

This recipe was recommended by a friend to me.  My dad always tells me I am such an awful cook (not that he has eaten anything I have made) so I decided to visit my parents and make this for dinner.  It was a hit!  The whole family loved it including my picky children.  Now my dad has no room to talk =)  Thanks!

I made this tonight out of desperation - our freezer died and I needed to use thawed chicken, thawed diced ham (which I ended up chopping fairly fine) and happened to also have shredded Swiss in there.  Kind of heavy for a hot summer day (not the recipe's fault) but nonetheless, delicious.  My 8, 6,and 4 year olds kept asking when dinner was ready because it smelled so good.  I made it just as written (short of the diced ham and shredded swiss instead of whole slices).  Very, very good.

This was fantastic!!!!

I listened to some of the other posters. I cut the butter in half and added olive oil.

Also with the sauce I added fresh minced garlic.

My family loved it!!!

I did everything but the cream sauce for I did not have whipping cream and the chicken broth. So I did a little something with white wine, bread crumbs, olive oil, fresh garlic and it was heaven. The swiss Cheese makes it. My husband and I loved it. Five stars in our family!

I have to vote with the majority on this one.  Superb!  I only made three chicken breasts but made the same amount of sauce. Made exactly as stated and ate every bite.  The gravy was great over the chicken and to dip my homemade bread into.  I will make this again.

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband and I both enjoyed it very much. I didn't make any changes to the recipe, although I only cooked 3 chicken breasts. The sauce really made the meal. It wasn't too heavy or too light, just perfect.

The sauce was absolutely delicious, and went amazingly well with steamed asparagus and green beans sauteed in butter and garlic. I baked the chicken instead of frying it, only because my boyfriend insisted, and it turned out a little dry - but that was definitely my mistake; I won't make it next time. I also substituted chick broth for white wine, as I had none on hand and we're not drinkers. 

The sauce I just threw together in a saucepan while the chicken was baking - the butter, chicken broth, chicken bouillon, cream, and corn starch - and some flour to help with the thickening.

All in all, this was the first fancy meal I ever prepared by myself; usually, my boyfriend cooks! I made it for my family, and there were compliments all around - especially, as I said, the sauce. This recipe is definitely a keeper. :)

This recipe is a keeper. I made this last night and received rave reviews from everyone. I made it based on other reviews. The only thing I changed was to change the heavy cream to fat free half and half for husband's health issues. I am also going to double the suace next time and use it over pasta. Thanks for such a great recipe!!!

Great recipie. I overcooked the chicken, but if I hadn't it would have been restaurant quality. Made exactly like the recipie said, and it was great!

This dish tastes great, but it took so long to prepare that I probably won't make it again soon. The sauce is definitely the best part of the meal! I agree with others and say that it is definitely better to pound out the meat to one half or one quarter thickness

My two guests and I nearly licked the dish clean!  It was delicious.  The wine sauce was very different and added a lot to the recipe.  It is recommended to have very thin slices of meat in order to roll it.

I'm going with 4 stars, this was pretty good but not 5 star worthy.  I followed the recipe with the exception of using 1/2 milk, 1/2 cream.  I would probably add a little more kick to the sauce, or maybe I just prefer the traditional crispy coated recipe:)

This was a good recipe. Not as much flavor as I would have wanted but definitely a good dinner. Sauce was good but I couldn't help but think of the excessive butter as I watched it separate at the end.

This was so yummy! I had to add butter in throughout the cooking period due to the chicken sticking, but it turned out wonderful. I made a side of mashed potatoes and added a couple spoonfuls of the sauce (before adding the corn starch) to the potatoes and they turned out super too. This is something you invite friends over for dinner to impress.

Yummy! That's all my kids said as they were eating and they are very picky. I used half butter and half olive oil to saute these and I think I could have used less than what the recipe stated. I also used fat free half-and-half and milk to make the cream sauce and it turned out very good.

Easy, delicious, a hit with everyone. Followed the ingredients exactly with much success. Pounded out the breasts between two sheets of wax paper until very thin to make room for the all ham and cheese.

Very good, but not what I expected. My husband thought the sauce was a stroganoff sauce... it wasn't all that good at all. But the chicken was excellent, and easy! I should have made more :)

I made this for company, and they LOVED it!  I did not use toothpicks at all. I used extra thin chicken instead. I just folded ham around a piece of swiss cheese, and placed it on one of the pieces of chicken.  Then I put the another piece on top of that.  As long as you aren't throwing the pan around, it stays on fine!  It is a keeper!

Excellent! I used a mix of 1/2 bread crumbs and 1/2 flour for the coating and used champaign (had an open bottle, & it's just wine with bubbles anyway, right?). This cooks very fast (5 - 10 minutes, not 30 as listed in step 2), something to keep in mind if you're serving with other dishes that might take longer.

Delicious! My whole family loved this recipe! I cut back on the butter to 4 T. and doubled the sauce, as suggested. I did not increase the wine amount though. Instead of cream, I used 1 c. half & half and used 3/4 c. of 1% milk. I just couldn't bring myself to use all cream. It was delicious & would even try using more milk/less cream next time.

We followed the receipe to a "t" and the sauce seemed WAY too creamy, so we added extra milk and a little bit of wine again to make it a little more creamy.  it wasn't as good as everyone said, but it was an easy recipe for chicken cordon blue.  Will make again.

I did something very wrong, and it's still a 5 star recipe.  I had troubles pulling the chicken over the ham and cheese.  It was the biggest mess and looked not so pretty.  The flavor was wonderful though.  It was exactly how I wanted it to taste.  The sauce was wonderful too.  I got rave reviews.  I can't wait to make it again and see if I can make it look more presentable.  I served it with long grain rice and steamed vegetables.  The sauce was perfect over them too.

I did not love this recipe, I found it to be lacking the traditional cordon bleu taste. The taste of the wine came across too strong for my liking.

This is one of my favorite recipes!! My kids and husband just LOVE it! This is requested each week and there are never any leftovers (even though there should be)! The only thing I changed in this recipe is adding more cheese to 1 1/2 slices per breast since I like mine cheesy! Served with rice, steamed veggies and rolls! DELICIOUS!!!!

Didn't have enough toothpicks to really seal the chicken, so the presentation was a little off, but the taste was great.  Wasn't nearly as difficult as I always thought!  Will make again!

Great recipe.  I made it the first time for dinner guests and everyone enjoyed it.  I used cooking wine and as others suggested I substituted half and half for the heavy cream.  I forgot to add the butter to the pan but it didnt seem to make a difference.  I also added chicken broth for extra flavor and extra sauce.  As others have stated, the sauce is amazing.  I also doubled the amount of the sauce as was suggested.  Closing the chicken with toothpicks was time consuming.  Other than that, recipe is very easy to follow.

This was a very good recipe.  The cream sauce was to die for.  Even my picky husband enjoyed it.  The recipe was easy to make, the hardest part is bundling the chicken, but it looks so nice when done that guests will think you slaved over it.

Very good flavor.  The sauce is very good but a little heavy for my taste.  Cut back on the cream a little the second time I made this and it was perfect.

Great recipe!!!  Absolutly mouth watering!!  The combo of the white wine and the ham & swiss is decadent.  I am a low-carber, so I left out the flour and changed the cornstarch to xantham gum.  It turned out wonderful!  A new staple in my recipe box.  Thanks!

Instead of pounding the breasts, I take a sharp fillet knife and make a pocket in the breasts from the top. I then insert a thick slice of ham & a good aged swiss. Seal pocket with a toothpick. Bread,brown, 45minutes @ 350

This was a welcome change from regular old chicken cordon bleu (which mine always seems to turn out dry).  I was eager to try the sauce and that's what made this recip!  I did have to change a few things to fit what I had on hand in my kitchen.  I substituted milk for the whipping cream (and I probably wouldn't have used the cream if I'd had it, to cut the fat, milk worked fine) and I didn't have any chicken bouillon, so I added a bit a seasoned salt, pepper and garlic/herb seasoning to taste.  Also did not use all of the milk/cornstarch mixture, it dulled the taste down adding too much and I had to add more wine and seasonings.  So, I'd reccommend adding that just to taste.  Very good!

Wonderful!! I am giving this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 because my chicken was a little bit dry..but in the recipes defense, i think i may have slightly overcooked it! The sauce was amazing and really made the dish worthwhile!! Very EASY to make too! Instead of using the toothpicks, I cut pockets into the chicken and also stuffed them with minced garlic!! Will certainly be making again!

This was my first attempt at a Chicken Cordon Bleu recipe and my fiance declared it the best meal I've ever made (and that's saying a lot as he generally loves my cooking!). I followed other reviewer's suggestions and prepared the chicken ahead of time so that it could chill.  Once I was ready to begin cooking, I breaded the chicken a second time as it came out with a really great crispy crust.  One alteration--instead of transferring the chicken onto a warm platter, I put it in a non-stick skillet with some butter-flavored Pam to crisp the chicken back up as it gets a little
soggy cooking with the wine sauce.  Also, I only made 2 chicken breast and we had just enough sauce for the 2 breast and little to go with our steamed asparagus.  I would suggest doubling or tripling the sauce recipe if making the full 6 chicken breasts as indicated in the recipe.  Thanks Behr for a great recipe!  Due to the high fat content, we'll probably only make this for special occassions but it was great! Thanks again!

this recipe is awesome, my entire family absolutely loved it. the sauce is also great over stemed asparagus. i followed the other suggestions about dipping in flour, melted butter, then bread crumbs and letting it sit in the fridge to set the breading. this one is definitely a keeper.

This is very good but it's the sauce that's the star of the show and there is not enough of it for six servings.  I will definitely double the sauce next time.  You certainly don't have to make these into rolls (mine never turn out good and I lose a lot of cheese).  Instead, cook pounded chicken breasts  and when the sauce is done, return the chicken to the pan, top it with ham and swiss and put the cover on until melted.

I made this last night and my boyfriend and I loved it!  The sauce was delicious, although I recommend a good, strong white wine (I used the box kind *cringe* and it turned out a little bland - it may have been better had I reduced it before adding the cream or I could have added a little thyme *shrug*).  I also recommend half butter, half olive oil so the butter doesn't burn.  Great dish, thanks for sharing!

I have used so many recipes from this site, but this is the first one I have ever reviewed.  This dish was fabulous.  My friends loved it, my picky husband loved it, my even pickier brother in law loved it. I don't eat a lot of meat but after smelling this while it cooked i had to try it and even I loved it!  Everyone has been talking about it!!!  So easy, so good...what more could you ask?

I served this recipe to a about 12 people this evening and everyone loved it.  I didn't think it required too much time either.  I recommend tenderizing the chicken breasts with a mallet of sorts before inserting the ham and cheese, it made them flatter and easier to work with.  The wine sauce was great and the flour/paprika coating was just right.  Definitely a keeper.

This is absolutely the best!  I've been making cordon bleu for years as my boys love it, but this is the only recipe I use now.  I don't usually like wine sauce, but this is amazing!  Can't taste the wine really, which is what I like about it.  Creamy and savory and delicious!

Great recipe. I used cornmeal instead of flour and simmer in chicken broth instead of wine, it turned out fine. I will make it again. Thanks.

The only reason I didn't give this recipe a 5 star (I would have given 4 1/2!) was because it was a little more involved than I expected.  That said, I followed the recommendations of others and started on the stovetop browing for about 10 minutes and put in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes, unvocered.  I doubled the sauce,  blended the wine, about 3 tblsp butter and chicken bullion on the stove, then added the cream and cornstarch mixture.  When I took the chicken out of the oven, I put the pan back on the stove, brought the drippings to a simmer and added the cream mixture.  I let that simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly.  I served with rice.  Very good -- just a little time consuming for a week-night meal!!  Thanks!

Fantastic!  I have made this recipe many times. It is a big hit with my fiance and he requests it often.  I cut calories and fat by substituting 2% or whole milk for the heavy whipping cream.  Taste and consistency of the gravy are same as using cream.  The wine and bouillon give it rich flavor.  Definitely a keeper!!

This recipe was fantastic!  It is definitely a keeper!  I realized the next day that I forgot to put the sauce on the chicken but regardless, it was still a really, really great dish.  We had it with cream cheese ranch potatoes from this site and it was a wonderful dinner.  Wouldn't change a thing.

I made this for my Christmas Eve dinner.  We had 12 quests coming so I did a trial run a few days before the 24th.  Thank Goodness for the trial run.  We thought the chicken was excellent, but the sauce very poor. It was more like a very thick gravy that didn't have the right taste to compliment the chicken.  I  doubled (because we were having a homemade pasta as well) and substituted the following for the sauce: 1/2 cup real butter,1 1/2 cups very dry white wine, 4 chicken bouillon cubes, 2 large pks of cream cheese, 2 1/2 cups of whole cream, 1 tsp. paprika, and 1/2 tsp white pepper.  It was a very good sauce...my guests were raving about it.

I give this recipe 4 stars only because I modified it with another recipe from this site.  I changed the sauce slightly and then baked in the oven.  After the chicken was browned in the pan, I transferred it to a 9x13 pan and mixed the wine, bouillan and heavy cream with a can of cream of mushroom soup, warmed it and poured it over the top of the chicken and baked for 30 minutes.  It turned out really well!!!!  Will make this again soon!!!

Great Recipe!  I double the wine, bouillon, whipping cream and cornstarch (actually I even add a little extra bouillon for more taste) and use it on bow tie pasta.  I slice the chicken and pour the sauce on top and the rest goes in with the pasta.  Such a pretty presentation and delicious!  Everyone loves it (even my  picky daughter!).  Just be careful to get all the toothpicks out of the chicken before you serve :-)

I thought this was very good.The gravy turned out great and there was plenty to go with leftovers for lunch the next day. This might be only me, but I would look for smaller chicken breasts or pound them out more, most of the cheese had melted out by the time they were done.

I had to try this recipe after reading such great reviews....and thats exactly what I got after making it for a small dinner party.  I let the chicken simmer for less than 25 minutes (from past experience,) sauce came out great...I'll probably make extra next time to pour over mashed potatos...Great Recipe!  I'm making it again this weekend for an engagement party.

AWESOME!  I made this for my family and they absolutely loved it.  I doubled the sauce after reading all of the wonderful reviews.  I was glad I did because it was nice to have the extra sauce when reheating the leftover chicken the next day.  This recipe also looks very nice when you serve it.  I will be making this again.

Excellent! I made this for a small gathering of family and friends. It was easy to make and tasted fantastic! The compliments continued long after dinner was over! I followed the recipe for the most part exactly, except forgot to roll the chicken in the flour, so to catch myself up, I sprinkled the chicken while it was browning with paprika and it was fine. I didn't have any plain toothpicks and had to use colored ones, and some of the dye came out on the meat! I will definitely NOT do that again! I also added about triple the amount of cornstarch (3T) to thicken the sauce a little more. But overall, this was wonderful!!! 5++++ stars!

I loved this recipe, I didn't have white wine on hand so I used red wine. It still turned out great...the only difficult part was pounding the chicken so it was flat enough.

This recipe was amazing.  I made this for my friends and they loved it.  I usually don't like chicken and I cleaned my plate with this.  The sauce was incredible.  Very easy to follow and extremely easy to make.  Will definately be keeping this recipe.  Thanks

This was so simple and so amazing. I made it for my husband for Valentine's Day and it was a huge hit. The best part was the sauce. I think that next time, I'll make more of it so I can pour it over the rest of my dinner.

This dish was good, but the chicken rolled up with pesto and proscuitto that I make has more flavor and was a bigger hit. Just layer a slice of proscuitto and 2 tablespoons of pesto onto a flattened chicken breast and bake. Yum!!

I make dinner every night for 4 adults and one child.  This is a hugh hit in my house especially for my brother who doesn't like ham.  Be sure to pound your chicken or you'll never get the tooth picks out,(don't use colored ones or you'll get the color on your chicken) I bought a bottle of Livingston Cellars Chablis Blanc California dry white wine and thought I would have it forever but this recipe is such a hit it's time to buy a new one!

Oh wow was this good!  Very easy actually. I served it with rice and fresh broccoli and it went over very well with my family.  I added more ham to each chicken roll than directed,(I used honey ham from our store's deli) but other than that I didn't change a thing.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I've made it twice now, It's easy and very elegant.  I will be making this one a lot.  I love the sauce!!  I recommend pounding the chicken breasts pretty thin so that they wrap all the way around and don't let any of the cheese leak out, it's too good to waste!  Thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely yummy and needs no changes! If you're a big sauce fan, you might want to make half again as much sauce, but doubling it would be too much, I think.  

I happened to have some extra ham after filling the chicken, so I chopped that up and added it to the sauce just before I served it, and it was really good. (But the sauce would have been marvelous without the extra ham, too.)

I can't say enough great things about this recipe. I had my students make it for our French Dinner where we served 100 people. I only heard wonderful things about it. We had to adjust it a bit by just frying the chicken up first. I had the students save the drippings and when we made the sauce we added the drippings to the sauce along with the boullion and wine. Thanks a million. I will be serving this recipe every year!

Delicious!  My husband and two teenaged boys loved it.  I think 30 minutes was a little long to cook the chicken though.  It was a little dry.  20 minutes should be sufficient. I can't wait to make this again.

I had never had Chicken Cordon Bleu before, but it was one of my new wife's favorite dishes.  So I tried it.  This recipe is INCREDIBLE!  It's worth it just for the sauce you make.  I now make it anytime company comes over.

Very good, but I might try it with mozzarella instead of swiss next time.  This would have gotten 5 stars if I liked swiss cheese.

This was good, but I had problems covering the ham and cheese in the inside of the cordon blue. When it was all cooked.. there was no cheese left in the cordon blue. The sauce was nice and cheesy though because the cheese melted out. Clean up was a bit messy too. Over all, this was good. I think I will try it again.

Oh My Gosh!  This is a truly wonderful recipe.  I had it Friday night and it was a "winner".  Everyone loved it and it was so simple.  I followed the recipe exactly remembering to drain the chicken rolls before pouring the creamy sauce over it.  I used dry vermouth for the wine.  Simply delicious!!!!!!

Very, very good!  This works well as a low carb recipe too.  Whole chicken breast would make it easier to wrap cheese and ham.  The sauce was so simple and had an amazing taste, unbelievable richness.

We didn't really go for this.  I have one daughter who liked it but my husband, my other three daughters and I didn't.  The flavor was just sort of salty and bland.  The sauce was somewhat gluey and everyone scraped it off.  Maybe I did something wrong?

I'm on a low-carb diet, so I tried this one out with minor modifications. I'm also not a very good cook, so the low rating may be my own fault. First, I cooked only 2 breasts, cutting the recipe to 1/3. I did not use flour, instead sprinkling the chicken lightly with paprika and sauteed it in a frying pan before baking at 350 for 20 minutes. I stirred all sauce ingredients together and cooked that separately (very easy and quick) in the same pan as I browned the chicken so some paprika mixed in. I added the cheese and ham on the top of the chicken the last 2 minutes of baking which worked out fine and was much simpler (for those of us not skilled in the wrapping, tying, etc.). In any case, I found the sauce to be much too rich -- way too much greasy. I think if I tried it again, I'd use almost no butter, and maybe milk or half-and-half for the base instead of heavy whipping cream. My boyfriend passed on the sauce entirely, saying that it was "too buttery." It's only fair to say that I grew up on very bland, low-fat foods, so my taste buds may not be evolved enough for such decadence. Thanks for the recipe anyway.

This is the best chicken cordon bleu recipe! It is so good and my company loved it as well. I did as one reviewer recommended and sauteed the chicken in 3 T olive oil and 3 T butter instead of 6 T butter. Also, the sauce really gave this cordon bleu an extra good taste. Very rich but worth the calories!

This was phenomenal. I made it exactly as written and wouldn’t even think to make any changes to this with how good it is. Best recipe from this website hands down.

I like the flavor, but the execution is off. First, the wine is too much and had to be drained afterwards. Secondly, I would swap half the butter with olive oil to keep it from burning like someone else suggested. It wasn't crispy enough, so I'd suggest upping the flour amount until you can actually coat and dredge and pan fry it. You really do need a very very long chicken breast as it's somewhat hard to fold over and complete. Thank god for the toothpicks. It'll do, but the recipe needs some work.

I made this as is and the hubby loved it. For the people who said it needed salt, if you buy good ham and good cheese it's plenty salty.  I served it with wide egg noodles and fresh asparagus.

I made this as directed other than I scaled it down to 3 portions. I was excited by the reviews to make a tasty Cordon Bleu without all the fuss and dishes that I usually have but was disappointed. It was great having a sauce to put over them and the presentation was beautiful but the sauce was bland and missing something.

Wonderful Dish!! I did make some tweakes.  I used less whipping cream and added some chicken broth. Just floured lightly, still chicken browned nicely. I also use wondra instead of cornstarch to make a sauce. All worked out beautifully!!! Really a great dish, served with salad. Will make again!!!

I made this for my wife and I for the first time last night, and could not have been happier. Chicken came out wonderful and still tender, and the sauce that this makes is phenomenal. My wife and I agreed that this was the best new recipe we have made in a long time.

I followed the recipe very closely. The only additions I made was a bit of salt and pepper both on the chicken prior to assembling them, and a bit more in the flour/paprika mixture. I also only had light cream (recipe calls for heavy), but the sauce was still wonderfully rich. Will absolutely make this again.

Made this for my gf and I.  loved every bit we could hold.  portions were big with whole breast and all the filling.  overall awesome take on the classic.  loved the idea of the cream sauce, it really made to dish stand out.  I had to xfer it to a casserole dish when done and added a bit of shredded Colby Jack to kick it up.  thanks

Super easy recipe! I would only change the sour cream out for Ricotta cheese. The sour cream was a little bland for us. That being said, everyone’s plates were still empty at the end of the meal, so it’s a hit in my book.

It was delicious and the simplicity vs. how awesome it was has boosted my cooking confidence, which I felt comfortable with already but this dish has it all, just use extra wine for a garlic wine asparagus side dish and enjoy the remainder :-)

I substitute Gruyere for the Swiss cheese and Prosciutto for the Ham. I used free-range chicken. The wife and kid loved it ! I’m a true novice cook so I was a little sloppy folding the chicken over the filling but, I’m going to try again tonight.

Delicious.  Made a few changes...nothing big.  Fried the chicken in the butter as directed but only for 10 minutes and then added the wine and a teaspoon of Better then Bouillon and cooked 5 minutes more.  Then transferred them to a 9x13 and cooked in the oven at 300 for 30 minutes.  When you make the sauce, try 2 tablespoons of Wondra instead of  cornstarch.  It works the same but will never be lumpy.  Super tasty recipe!

Was wonderful & sauce was very delicious! I would add a little salt, pepper & garlic powder on top of cheese/ham before rolling it up. We used Canadian bacon instead of ham. This is definitely a keeper!

This is an amazing restaurant quality dish. Everyone loved it and requested to have it again asap. Made with mushroom risotto recipe from this site, also a hit. Dredged chicken through flour, egg, then breadcrumbs.

Soooo good! I double the wine and bouillon because the sauce is to die for. Make this with rice or potato for more sauce.

this was my first time making any chicken Cordon Bleu and it was FABULOUS! This recipe has so much flavor.  I used thick chicken breasts - I didn't pound them, I cut a pocket in them and doubled the ham and cheese in each one.

I followed the directions just as written. But I made this keto-friendly by swapping coconut flour for the all-purpose flour. 1/2 cup of chicken bone broth instead of white wine, I skipped the chicken bouillon granules, and I swapped a teaspoon of unflavored gelatin for the cornstarch. YUM!

This is the second time I’ve made this Chicken Cordon Bleu recipe. I had no white wine on hand (drank it all the previous night) and substituted water in the same amount instead. I added poultry seasoning and seasoning salt to add some flavor that the wine would’ve otherwise added. This substitution was a good option too for my young children. All other ingredients were added as listed and turned out great.

This is an amazing recipe, but I did change it after reading several reviews. First off, it took forever to pound 6 thick chicken breasts, so next time I will use chicken cutlets. After laying the ham and a slice of swiss (cut in half)on the breast and securing with a toothpick, I rolled chicken breasts in 1 whisked egg and then bread crumbs. I fried the breasts in 3 tbl of butter and 3 tbl of olive oil. After they were browned on all sides, I put the pan in a 350 degree oven for 40 minutes. While the chicken was in the oven, I made the sauce. In a sauce pan,  I mixed 1 c. of white wine, about 2 tsp of chicken bullion, a dash of black pepper and paprika and 2 tbl of butter. In a separate bowl,  I then mixed 2 cups of cream with 3 tbl of cornstarch. I whisked it into the sauce pan until thickened. I poured the sauce over the chicken when it was time for dinner. Next time, I will follow the recipe exactly and see which one tastes better.

So good! Didn't have wine so I used chicken broth and yellow mustard for the simmer. Added half and half with the starch, thickened up perfectly. No leftovers here! Will definitely make it again.

Followed the recipe to the letter but added a pinch of S&B curry powder to the sauce before I poured it over the Chicken and garnish with fresh chopped cilantro! Chicken Cordon Bleu. Awesomeo!

This is SO GOOD! I like my chicken to have a crunchy breaded texture, so I make a seasoned flour and bread crumbs mixture, roll the chicken in egg and then the mixture, then brown it.   I then transfer to a pan and bake.  Then I make the sauce seperately (in the pan I used to fry the chicken) and spoon over the crunchy chicken.  Delicious! My husband loves this and we always want seconds!

I’m trying to eat low carb so the only thing I changed was using almond flour instead of regular flour. 
This recipe is delicious!! My kids loved it - and they can be tough customers. 
The video was very helpful. I can’t wait to make it again.

Great recipe for Chicken Cordon Bleu! The sauce is delicious with the chicken. It's a 5 star recipe, but Chicken Cordon Bleu always has breadcrumbs, hence the 4 star rating from me. This recipe was easy to substitute for my dietary restrictions (lactose intolerant, gluten free, and egg free). My substitutes if anyone with the same issues needs it and have been avoiding this recipe were GF AP flour, earth balance butter, GF vegetable bouillon (I was out of chicken), unsweetened coconut creamer (next time I’d just use coconut or almond milk). I did use GF and egg free breadcrumbs and to apply the breadcrumbs, I dredged in flour as directed and brushed on a little coconut creamer. As I can tolerate some hard cheeses, I tried using an imported gruyere that contained 0gm sugar and was actually labeled lactose free. It worked perfectly and was delicious. Despite these changes for my needs, I followed all measurements exactly and have no doubt this recipe works very well as written and tastes even better if you can handle the ingredients. Served with grilled asparagus and really enjoyed this chicken cordon bleu! Thanks for the recipe!

I think I'd add a little salt to the breading next time. Also, turn up the heat on the pan after removing the chicken so the sauce will gel faster. Otherwise, we liked it a lot and will do it again. Thanks!

My family loved this and I was especially pleasantly surprised that my 19 month old tore this up. I followed the recipe for the most part, but my coating on the chicken was a bit mushy at the end and I had to sauté them in a little oil to crisp them a little. No big deal, I probably messed something up in a previous steps. We were very happy with how this turned out. I served it with long grain and wild rice and roasted broccoli.

I made the recipe as written, except with the addition of a little garlic salt to the flour. Hubby said he would give it six stars if he could! Will definitely make again!

It was ok. My husband missed the cream cheese in the cordon blue. The breading was soggy from cooking  in the broth. The sauce was tasty, but I had to strain it because of it having part of the breading in it.

Love the recipe and took the recommendation of another review by using egg wash and breadcrumbs, cooking in pan the. Into oven. I also used leftover ham from Easter and sliced it thin. I did use the pan to make sauce by deglazing with the wine and the. Adding the remaining ingredients. It came out so good!!!  A nice side of scalloped potatoes

This was absolutely amazing.  While I have been making cordon bleu for years, I hadn’t come across a recipe for the white wine sauce yet.  It makes the entire dish.  It ties the ham cheese and chicken together in a beautifully elegant bow.  My 9 year old daughter makes a face of shear delight when I tell her I’m making this for dinner.

Amazing flavor! I did swap out a little of the butter for olive oil only because I didn’t have enough butter. The first time I made it, I made the mistake of not cooking it quite long enough(still done, just not the right texture), but the second... oh man was this good. I made this for a small party and everyone LOVED it!

I thought this was simple to make but the outcome was a bit on the dry side.  I wouldn't cook it for 30 minutes next time.  But it was definitely tasty enough to make again.  The cheese did cook out on me and I will use the string  going forward and I would make a little more sauce the next time as suggested by others.

1st attempt and tasted great. A little too buttery so next time gonna try olive oil instead.
2nd time I substituted 1/2 the butter with olive oil. Much better.

Followed the recipe except adding some more wine into the white sauce too.  Amazing, no leftovers.  Cooked in cast iron over charcoal/hickory blend for a little added smokiness.  Perfection!!!!!

Being pretty new to cooking I decided to challenge myself with this dish. After researching several recipes and sauces, I decided to tweak a few things while cooking. The sauce could have used twice the amount of cornstarch in order to really thicken it—this could be due to the amount of wine/butter mixture left over from the pan. I also added in a few other ingredients to the sauce to kick the flavor up a notch: pepper, minced garlic, Dijon mustard, and bit of shaved onion! I also could have saved myself 20+ minutes of slicing by simply buying chicken cutlets instead of the breasts itself hahaha :) Was slightly disappointed I didn’t think to add bread crumbs to the outside—next time I’ll give that a try. Overall received raving reviews on this one, I just wish I had breaded it!!

Very good but  either I browned too long  or cooked too long, I think it was cooked thoroughly in 15 minutes after browning on all sides.  The last time I made CCB it was dry so I cut the cooking  time back to 20 minutes. It was still dry.

Delish!  I made changes like others by finishing it in the oven after browning it in the pot. I watched it closely as to not over cook it, making it dry. I also made the sauce on the side.

Everyone in the house loved it (even the 8 year old)! It's pretty filling, about half a breast is perfect for the adults.

OMG!!! So delicious!!! I do agree with one rater that the directions should stay the same, but at the same time, it's a matter of taste! I coated the chicken (5 pieces) with 1 egg and some seasoning. I added honey turkey to 3 and honey ham to 2 of them along with the swiss cheese, making sure to put the cheese in the middle and not on top. Then I rolled it in bread crumbs. Then I simmered it in half butter half olive oil, but I DID NOT add the wine or boullion at that point. After cooking it for about 15 min browning it on all sides, I removed it from skillet, placed in a pan lined with foil, poured the sauce from the pan on top of it and baked it for 20 min. I just prefer baking as opposed to all skillet cooking. While it was baking, I made the sauce. I tripled the sauce because of other reviews, and I'm glad I did. I poured 3 cups of Heavy Cream, 1 1/2 cups of white wine, 3 tbsp of cornstarch and 2 bullion cubes with a sprinkle of paprika for color. After whisking it for about 3 min, I added it to a pot and cooked it on med high for about 5 min. I let it sit for about 5 min until it thickened. Then I added some sauce to the chicken and kept the remaining sauce for the white Basmati rice and asparagus! It was a sensation!!! The family said it was the best  they ever had. Thank you so much for your recipe. It is a dish that will hit home every single month from now on.

Delicious and easy! My chicken breasts were kind of thick, so I just split them open and pounded them inserted the ham and cheese and several toothpicks held them together.

Overall this was a hit at my dinner party. I made this exactly as the recipe said. It was very good and the chicken stayed moist but it was bland. Either salting the chicken or putting salt in the flour/ paprika mix with other spices such as pepper, oregano, thyme, etc  might help. I thought the bouillon and wine would give it enough salt and flavor but I didn’t think it did.  Also I bought chicken breasts from Costco which were very thick. It was hard to pound them to a 1/4 inch and roll. I would suggest getting thin cutlets to start and pound them even thinner. Finally the sauce was easy to make. I worry about it thickening enough and not being runny but with heavy cream it thickens just by heating and stirring. Again I didn’t think it had enough flavor except richness. I would try again to add a shredded cheese like a sharp white cheddar to give it some more flavor.

This is very good! I'll make it again tonight. I didn't have the granuals so I just used chicken broth. I will also use 2 slices of swiss cheese per chicken breast. Could be that the slices I have are thin.

I made this and almost followed the recipe exactly. Instead of keeping the chicken in the pan for the 30 minutes to cook, I transferred it into the oven for 18 minutes at 350 after I browned the sides . I pounded the chicken very flat and also split each breast into two pieces versus one. I really loved the rich and creamy sauce and was amazed at how great the chicken tasted. I paired this recipe with broccoli and rice. I double the sauce so I could use it to drizzle over the rice as well. Delicious recipe, would definitely make it again. My son and husband absolutely adored it!

stuck to the recipe. Rolling pounded out chicken with cheese and ham was a bit more challenging than it appeared on the video. Kept to the pan no oven baking. But the sauce was really good. Probably heavy handed the wine a smidgen. Served with sauteed mushrooms in garlic butter, steamed broccoli florets and jasmine rice. As Guy Fieri likes to say, "I'd put that sauce on a flip flop and eat it". 
I'll pound the chicken thinner and keep the pieces smaller next time.

I used whole milk instead of cream and thickened the sauce with a very fine flour. Also pounded the chicken breast out and then folded in half for a smaller portion.  Didn't have Swiss on hand so I used Tex Mex mix shredded cheese. It was perfect! I could only eat half of mine and my husband ate it the next day. Mmmmmm.

I have made this a couple times.  Just ran across the recipe again which reminded me I need to do it again!  
This is FABULOUS!!!!  The flavor is to die for.  The husband loves it too.  I've served to other family as well and everyone has said it's excellent.
When I love something I have a habit of saying  "I could mainline this stuff!"  Sounds crazy but when it's this good, I feel like the food addict comes out in me.  
You won't be dissapointed!!

this was pretty simple, the only thing we ended up being disappointed with was not enough ham and cheese filling for our liking. if you like thicker, and a bit more ham then I suggest adding additional slices to your liking. overall though simple solid recipe and will probably make it again

Instead of wine I substituted with beer!! I stuffed with extra ham and cheese and some of the cheese melted into the "broth" and with the beer made an AMAZING gravy. I also seasoned with extra salt, pepper, paprika, parsley, and garlic after I placed the stuffed chicken breasts in the pan.I didn't have to use cream or milk at all because the cheese turned the sauce very thick.

Family loved it and my daughter literally licked her plate clean.  I know, that's horrible and tacky but at home it was pretty funny.

I have never made chicken cordon bleu before or have ever had it. I think that this was the best chicken that I've ever made. I did make one substitution though and used coconut flour.  My only problem was that the cheese didn't stay inside... any of it, not sure how that's supposed to work. Also, might add some paprika to the sauce next time for a little kick.

Made this tonight and even my picky husband loved it.   Easy-one pan meal.  I thought making it on top of the stove would make the chicken tough....I was wrong.    I will be making this again.

First of all, my husband doesn’t care to eat chicken but he loves this recipe!! I cut the breasts in half because the ones I bought were huge. Then I pounded them down to a half inch. I seasoned each with only salt and pepper. Also I used apple juice instead of the wine since I don’t care for wine. It’s really easy to make. I thought it would be more work than it is. Definitely will make it again!

I used almond flour to make it keto friendly. It was delicious, but next time I will try slicing each breast along the side forming a pocket in which to insert the ham and cheese. Putting the ham and cheese on top was difficult and loses too much cheese during the cooking process.

my first time and it was restaurant quality. I ommited the wine substituting with water, served on a bed of spaghetti and grated parmesan.
I could have made the fillets thinner maybe but other than that perfect. My wife is very fussy with my cooking and less adventurous but she licked the plate clean. Will definitely make again.
Thank you

I never write reviews but this dish is the exception!  I cooked it exactly as the recipe calls for except I used thin sliced chicken breast and still needed to pound it down and substituted prosciutto instead of ham (out of need not choice). It was amazing!  I can see how baking could keep the outside a little less soggy but honestly once you drizzle the sauce on it, it does not change the dish much.  The sauce is awesome!  Will definitely be making this again!

That SAUCE!  I don’t know that it’s a “traditional” cordon bleu topping, but I don’t care - the sauce is amazing and elevated this dish.  Tip:  watch the chicken, it’s quick to overcook and mine was done after only a 15 minute simmer (recipe calls for 30m).

In spite of the fact I had trouble flattening the chicken breasts, this turned out quite well.  I took another reviewer's advice and placed these in the oven after browning.  My skillet wasn't deep enough to cook with the lid on.  I thickened the sauce on the stove.  My grocery store has thin sliced breasts.  I'll make this again using these.  I varied procedure but not ingredients.

Perfect!  Easy to make and turned out amazing. I didn’t have deli ham so I used uncured smoked ham slices.  It was harder to roll but once it was seared in the butter they stayed together.  All my ingredients were organic/non-gmo with natural-pasture raised smoked pork.

I made this for 8 and adjusted the recipe accordingly. I did double the white wine and cream to make sure there was enough sauce. It was a huge hit. Really delicious. The only thing I did in addition was to use a little olive oil with the butter when cooking the chicken. It was a good tip. Easy and satisfying

I have made this multiple times. The first time, I followed the recipe but quickly noticed that the chicken bouillon made the chicken overly salty. So I removed the bouillon all together and substituted it with other seasonings.

This was so easy and relatively quick to make, certainly quick to prepare.  We did make a few mostly minor changes. We pounded the chicken to about a 1/2 inch thick. I used 2 slices of honey ham (all we had) and 3 slices of Swiss per breast, then tied up with butcher string and dipped in paparika+flour as directed. I seared in an oven safe skillet with butter and oil, then stuck in the oven til temp read 165*. 
For the sauce, I was lazy and also didn't have any wine on hand. I did cream, about a half teaspoon of chicken bullion and dijon to taste. Let the sauce simmer a bit and it thickens just fine.  I didn't even need to add any additional salt to this dish. I will use black forest or something besides honey ham next time as well, but will make again!

Such a good dish!! The measurements are spot on, and the video helps a ton. Just have one tip, however: when making the sauce, make sure there’s no burnt pieces of chicken or melted cheese leftover. If there is, not a big deal. The sauce is meant to be the mixture of white wine, butter, corn starch and whipping cream so the burnt pieces and cheese won’t make it as rich and creamy. Other than that, this is a great dish for so many occasions. Love it.

The reviews are spot on. This is delicious & so simple. I added a little extra bouillon to the cream & it was perfection. I also stick a wooden skewer through the chicken breast so as not to bother with several little toothpicks. Those of you, like me, who aren’t very good with raw meat & toothpicks know what I mean. I will be making this again & again...

Fantastic as written. I’ll probably use broth instead of wine next time, but there will absolutely be a next time. Great recipe!

love this recipe!! I've made this several times now and I make it as stated every time. Tips for storing leftovers- STORE SAUCE SEPARATELY from chicken and warm sauce on the stovetop prior to serving.  Do not use the microwave.  I can't explain it, it's just not as good. 
I recommend ensuring you use thicker slices of ham rather than a thin slice.  Can hardly taste the ham when using thinner slices.  I go straight to the deli and ask them for medium to thick cuts of ham (worth it!)

This tasted great, using some suggestions by other reviewers. (Spread some spicey brown mustard on the chicken before laying down the ham and cheese,  adding smoked paprika to flour coating, also then dipped in beaten egg wash, rolling in Panko crumbs  with chopped parsley,  lightly browning the “rolls”...mine were like blobs...in canola oil, and making the sauce separately while the rest baked in the oven 30 minutes. All the guests loved it.
It was not easy to assemble, handling slippery wet raw chicken and wrestling with the rolling up and tying string process was messy and difficult.  The Swiss cheese slices I had were too thick to roll easily.  Still, it was a very satisfying main dish for a family gathering together.  (Also had to tell everyone to be aware of string pieces as I couldn’t remove the  completely.)

I made this Chicken Cordon Bleu recipe for my wife and I. It was amazing. I followed the recipe as outlined. I have made Cordon Bleu numerous times, but this is by far much better then my recipe or others I have tried.

You can't go wrong serving this dish to family and friends.
 I brushed egg on the chicken breasts and coated half in flour and paprika, and the other  breasts  in bread crumbs. Both ways were delicious!

This recipe was over-the-top awesome! I did make a few changes though. I used 4 chicken breasts since there were only four people and I used 2 tablespoons of butter and two tablespoons of olive oil. I slit the chicken in half and salted them to absorb the moisture and patted them dry. Then placed the cheese and ham on them and rolled them up and dipped them in egg wash and breadcrumbs with salt and pepper. I finished them in the oven and made the sauce without the chicken bouillon and added salt and pepper and they turned out awesome. My family loved it sooo much that they wanted me to make it again. This will definitely be one of my go-to recipes for sure. Thank you for the recipe.

Used margarine instead of butter, and a fairly neutral white wine instead of a dry (it was what we had oops). Great recipe, went well with mashed potatoes and would definitely make again! It was a fun date night meal to prepare with my partner.

What a fabulous recipe. The changes I made were: I used proscuitto and fontina cheese, dipped the rolled chicken an egg wash, I substituted panic bread crumbs for the flour and after browning the  chicken on the stove top I finished it in the oven for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. This is a wonderfully impressive dish when having company, it looks fancy without a huge amount of stress. Thanks so much for sharing!

I can not describe how thrilled I was with this recipe!  While it sounds and tastes like an incredible complex meal, it was surprisingly quick and easy.  My red meat loving husband rolled his eyes when I said I was making chicken for dinner...then proceeded to eat 3 servings and request 2 more for lunch the next day!  The only changes I made were using an egg dredge with ground pork rinds instead of flour or breadcrumbs since my husband eats a primarily keto diet.  I also did the stovetop browning for 10 mins + oven baking (350 at 25-30 mins) method and it came out perfect.  We served with a side of riced cauliflower and broccoli topped with that incredible sauce.  This will absolutely be finding it’s way to our table again soon!!!

Simple, easy, and wonderful, especially if youbtweak it a bit.  

Be sure to pound the breasts to a consistent 1/4 inch. Go easy on the boullion or it will be very salty - peobably best to substitute real chicken broth. And, if youre like me, add a tablespoon of vermouth or white cooking wine to the sauce AFTER you take it off the stove and it will be amazing.

The fiancé and I both loved this dish!  It was awesome.  I browned the chicken in the pan first and finished in the oven.  I added prosciutto, and that added an extra level of flavor.  I may have messed up the sauce, I added the wine to the pan I used to brown chicken with butter and then it deglazed, I then added the cream and cornstarch, it came out more like a gravy.  After we had gotten done and I was cleaning up, I realized I left out the bouillon granules, but it was still an excellent dish.  Will definitely make again!

This is my favorite recipe. I make it for guests all the time and they always ask for the recipe. It is perfect as written. I recommend making the amount of sauce. It’s delicious on everything, especiallly green beans.

I am not a very experienced cook, and this was my first time cooking chicken. I ended up burning the skin a little bit (this was my own fault as I was afraid of undercooking it), but otherwise, it was delicious. Excellent recipe, will make again!

*I used Mozzarella instead of Swiss cheese and a different seasoning.

I have tried other recipes for this and never as tasty. I did brown the chicken like someone else, for about 10 minutes before adding them back into the sauce.

I used Greek yogurt and whipped cream cheese to make the sauce instead of the heavy cream. Delicious. Made this recipe for lunch while watching France win the quarter finals of the World Cup. I will make it again for the finals!

I made this for dinner tonight because I had the ingredients handy. I didn’t change the recipe at all. It was absolutely delicious. My husband loved it. Next time I make it, I will try half and half instead of cream as the sauce was a bit rich, (but still delicious). Thanks for the recipe and helping me out with “what should I make for dinner”.  And it was super easy!

Excellent dish!! Did as others suggested by pounding the chicken down and roasted 20 minutes after frying.  Found it difficult to remove toothpicks and slice. Next time  I'll let sit for a while first.  I used water instead of wine and added fresh chopped parsley & basil to the sauce.  Quite rich, but definitely company worthy.

Excellent recipe for special occasions. Who's counting calories then? First I tested recipe on family. I did as some suggested and roasted after browning in fry pan. Found it difficult to get toothpicks out and slice. But after it sat for a bit, wasn't hard to do. Next time I will make 20 minutes ahead of rest, let sit 10 minutes and slice, then spoon sauce over and put in oven for 10 minutes. I also used just water instead of wine and added fresh parsley and basil. Was really yummy!!!

I did the flour coating and them dipped in egg and rolled in Panko.  I browned all sides in the butter but  finished cooking in the oven while  I deglazed the pan with the wine/broth and then strained it to get the (blackened/over cooked)  panko flakes out before adding the cream.  It was delicious.

I have had this recipe for a couple of years and have never made it. I thought for sure this was going to be one of those recipes where I spent half  my day in the kitchen! 
Well I wish I would have made it a LONG time ago!! It was very easy and VERY delicious!!! The only problem I had was my cheese melted out quite a bit but next time I will do what other reviewers said and wrap the cheese in the ham.  I also added a bit more chicken bouillon at the end to the sauce just for a bit more flavor. Since this recipe is so easy I will be adding it to my dinner rotation!!

Went by the directions but it was terrible. The chicken was so very dry and over burned had to throw it away  maybe I’ll try it again in a different way . Was very  embarrassed seriously

Excellent recipe! We loved it! I took advice from 2 other cooks but the changes would not change the outcome or taste of the recipe. I pounded the chicken breast to about 1/4 inch thick This helped aid in rolling the ham & cheese up in the chicken which I secured with a toothpick or two. I browned the chicken in a skillet on all sides except for the ends. Once browned I placed in covered baking pan and finished them off in a 350 oven for 15 - 20 minutes. In the mean time I made sauce using wine and rest of sauce ingredients combining with drippings in the skillet. I made 1/2 again as much sauce, as I always like extra. Only change was I used fat free half n half in place of the heavy whipping cream. I served it with wild rice and we poured sauce over all. Even the leftovers heated up nicely and did not dry out. The chicken was very juicy and the flavor was wonderful! While definitely be making this many times in the future.

So, the reason I’m giving this recipe 5 stars is, I didnt have any ham so I substituted turkey lunchmeat. I had no heavy cream so I used organic skim milk. Instead of chicken bullion I had beef. Also, I had no dry white wine and used cooking sherry instead. Just for kicks I threw in some capers. 
Although I tried really hard to screw up this recipe it turned out really well!! Therefore 5 stars!

This dish is excellent. I didn't change anything with the chicken preparation, only the sauce to make it healthier. I replaced the wine with chicken broth and the heavy whipping cream with half/half. Instead of 6 tablespoons of butter, I used 3 tablespoons butter and 3 tablespoons olive oil.

Made the recipe as is and it was delicious!!!  A whole chicken breast ends up being quite a lot for one person, especially if you are going to be serving it with a side or two.  Can't wait to make it for family and friends!

We loved this, and I didn't even make the sauce!  I did roll the stuffed breasts in beaten egg and then Panko bread crumbs before baking. Really easy and yummy!

I made this for about 100 people at a church dinner...exactly as the recipe states except for substituting chicken broth for the wine.  I got great reviews from so many people.  It's definitely my go-to cordon bleu recipe!  Yum!

Wow this was something else. Was a little bit of a pain getting the chicken breasts beaten down, but worth it! The sauce is sinful; we doubled that part of the recipe. Next time I think I’ll make a little more if a roux and try a lighter cream.

I use chicken strips/tenders or smaller slices of breast to make a messier version with a ratio of swiss & ham to chicken that I like better. Plus, the cheese that escapes add to the sauce later!

Be patient when making the sauce! It's amazing if you hang in there and don't overdo it on the corn starch.

OMG tonight I had unexpected guests (the boss of my husband and few co-workers), and I got so stressed because of too many people for dinner and I did not know earlier, but it turned out to be a great dinner. I had more chicken and I made this recipe OMG everybody loved it! I will definitely make it again! I cooked it on the stove for 10 min and then 20 minutes in the oven on temperature 350. Delicious!

This was very tasty!  Loved hitting the chicken to release aggressions:). Only thing I did differently was to dip in egg/wine wash before dipping in flour mixture.  Served with steamed broccoli and couscous cooked in chicken broth. I had Cure 81 Classic

this recipe was wonderful, ideas on the gravy when getting the cornstarch don't be afraid to get a little extra and pour that in your hot pan with your chicken pieces after browning the chicken pour in your  cup heavy crème should get thick. I make this all the time.

It's not fair to make changes  and then make a review. As usual, I didn't have all ingredients on hand.  No wine, used cooking sherry that I like. no cornstarch, used flour, no bouillon cube, seasoned chicken with poultry seasoning No swiss used Cabot sharp. No breast just tenderlions. Followed directions... very very tender...Sauce was very good. Because I used tenderlions they were on the small side but filling. Will make this again

Definitely double the sauce as it was SO good! Maybe quadruple it!! I used Smoked Swiss and deli sliced Ham off the Bone from the Safeway deli. I served this with rice and mixed veggies, the leftovers with rice and sautéed asparagus, mushrooms and onions, nom nom nom! Thank you!
PS. I didn't hammer my chicken thin enough, next time I will hammer it VERY thin, it makes a difference.

This was absolutely perfect just how it was. I was worried that it wasn't going to be salty enough, but I used salted butter. That plus the cube of bouillon seasoned it perfectly.

Made this last night for our crew of 5 adults / 2 kids 9 & 4.  Only change I made was placing chicken breasts in a baking dish after searing/browning off in the skillet.  Put them in the oven with the wine/bouillon mixture and covered tightly with foil.  350 @ 20-25 mins ( these were huge breasts)  Made wine/mushroom risotto and added a side of steamed green beans.  E V E R Y O N E loved it  The kids wanted more - everyone wanted more.  Will most definitely make again but next time I will use butchers twine instead of toothpicks.

Followed the recipe exactly, and this comes out fantastic!The browned butter and the wine make the very rich flavor of this dish, so I would not omit. All loved it, even my pickiest eater! The little bit of left over sauce went well over steamed broccoli too.

This was delicious! It turned out perfectly, and I didn’t change anything except to add mushrooms to the sauce.

Great recipe. Family loved it. Rich on dairy products but really delicious. Make sure the ham and cheese is sliced thinly in order to roll the chicken. The video tutorial was brilliant. Love it!

This was just ok, but I won't give up on it. Next time I'll pound the breast more for a prettier outcome and play around with a few more spices on the breast.

The taste of the sauce was incredible.  I used 5% cream instead of whipping cream. I do need to practice rolling the chicken.   I will use less ham and cheese next time

Super tasty! I've made this 2 or 3 times now. I cut the breasts in half to make the chicken go a little longer, but everyone gets enough. The sauce really adds a lot to this dish.

Pairs exceptionally well with butter dill bowtie pasta and roasted broccoli.

Have made this recipe quite a few times now. Always comes out very delicious and my family loves it. This will remain my go to Cordon Bleu recipe! :)

This last time I didn't have any heavy whipping cream, so I mixed half a cup of Greek yogurt (Fage) and half a cup of whole milk, strained it after a good mixing, and used that instead. Came out just as good! 

I also have used both the regular Paprika (smokey) and Hungarian Paprika (sweet) in this recipe. I prefer the Hungarian Paprika, as it gives it a very nice balance of flavor and gets rid of some of the tartness of the wine and cream (you can find it in European markets, if not at your regular grocers, if you'd like to try). 

For those saying that their sauce curdled, the general rule of thumb is to temper the cream and cornstarch mixture before adding it to the hot liquids. You can do this by adding one teaspoon at a time, hot to cold, to bring the temperature up before adding to the pan.

I absolutely love the sauce for this. I pound chicken breasts but use mozzarella slices instead of Swiss .  I add some paprika to flour and after rolling cheese and ham and securing the chicken breasts, dip in flour mixture then beaten eggs and then coat in bread crumbs. I lightly cook in a frying pan with butter until all sides of the chicken are browned. I remove the breasts and put them in a casserole dish and put them uncovered in the oven on 350 for about 30 to 40 minutes. Last 10 minutes I use the same pan with drippings and make the sauce. I pour the sauce over the cooked breast to serve. Amazing on mashed potatoes as well!

I have been making this for years and it’s a family favorite! The only thing I do different is not rolling the chicken, fry it and then stick it in oven with ham and cheese, broiled. Sauce over the top! The sauce is what makes the recipe. Not a fan of bouillon cubes,  half chicken broth and half wine, so yummy!

I have made this several times it is very good and is one of my daughters favorite meal. I also have always put it in egg wash  and rolled in bread crumbs and baked in oven. I saw another  recipe for this too on face book my daughter replied not as good as yours Mom.  The video for the showed making the chicken and rolling it up in cellophane and put it in fridge for 30 minutes mine was over night. I did not need to use tooth picks or string to hold it together so that is a good tip.

I love it as is. My husband prefers it without the sauce but it’s one of his favorite meals.

Family favorite! I like to use Black Tower wine - I feel that it add a perfect sweetness. I have been making this for years now!

very good.  I assembled early in day and tightly wrapped in plastic wrap. No need for toothpicks  - it holds together after a few hours in fridge.  Followed others reviews and used egg, flour and breadcrumbs.  Browned in skillet the finished in oven about 45 min.

I didn't have swiss cheese, used buffalo mozzarella it was good. Had some sliced mushrooms on hand & used those too in the sauce. This was weeknight easy & is a keeper.

I made it with a slight Kiev variation. Instead of just the flour, I add an egg wash and light bread crumbs. I then browned them in the pan and moved to a 9x11 baking dish where I added the white wine mixture and baked for 25 minutes at 400. I used the pan that I browned them in to make the heavy cream mixture with another splash of Sauvignon Blanc!  Tasty

Normally, I don't give many recipes 5 stars.  However, when I tasted this sauce I knew I was going to absolutely love this dish and make it a part of my own collection.  My family came together tonight (a hard thing to achieve with everyone on different schedules) and everyone ate seconds!  I paired it with mashed potatoes (sauce is great on potatoes) and asparagus as a finishing touch.

I thought I jacked up the sauce by using champagne vinegar and some Mexican flavor packet. I must have left my chicken bullion in the cart.  however, I just added some milk and garlic salt to the pan.. and it came out really delicious.

First attempt, surely 5 stars.  A bit of work.  Used Panko breadcrumbs instead of flower.  Double sauce.  Started in skillet, when brown switch to baking dish and cook in oven 350 until done (20-30min).   Used skillet to make sauce, did add S&P and a little nutmeg.  It will be repeated.  Note:  if you do six (I did 3) you might want to triple the sauce.   Also I did all prep, including rolling,  well in advance.  Pan to table less than an hour.

I adapted this recipe quite a bit. I did do the flour but added salt and pepper. After the flour I put it in egg then in panko. I browned it in the pan, then removed and dis the butter, wine and dissolved the bullion. I put the chicken in a baking dish and poured the butter wine sauce over. Cooked for about 40 minutes. When I pulled it out I put the chicken on a platter to rest and put the drippings in a skillet. I added some extra wine, cream, Parmesan, and corn starch and let it reduce down. Then served it over the chicken, and had enough extra to do a drizzle over the roasted asparagus and potatoes. It was great! I give the recipe 3 stars because I adapted it but the results were 5!

Fantastic!  OK, I tried to stay true to the original recipe, but I did make some changes based on personal preferences.  The flavors in this are SO good.  

Took a few tips from other reviewers and baked the chicken after I pounded the chicken breasts and browned the rolled up breasts.  I cooked the sauce separately.  I did use red rind Gouda cheese as I don't like Swiss.  For the sauce, I made a roux with 2 tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoons flour, 2 chicken bouillon cubes, 1/2 C white wine and 2 C heavy cream.  I never have much luck with cornstarch.  The sauce was extremely tasty!  This got RAVE reviews from the family and I am positive I will make this again and again.  Thank you,  Behr!!

I made this for the first time last night. I've only had chicken cordon Bleu once when I was in high school and remembered it was good.  I figured I'd try my hand at making this fancy dish. Pounding the chicken took a while, I used a wooden rolling pin. I just used some deli baked ham and some generic swiss,  and it did come out really well. My husband (who is very picky) and his friend both really liked it. In fact,  my husband's plate was quite clean when he finished which is unusual,  he usually leaves bits on his plate. I used a sweet reisling wine instead of dry sherry  but I think that was the only major difference to the recipe that I did.  I paired it with garlic mashed red potatoes and corn/green beans in butter and salt/pepper.  

Very glad I tried this recipe. Even amateur home cooks can make delicious "fancy" meals like this.

Beyond AWESOME !!!  ... That Sauce... MIND BLOWN !!
Did a Google image search for Chicken Cordon Bleu..  Hadn't made it for awhile, and I like to check out new recipes.... liked the picture...  clicked, then was intrigued by the Sauce...  Original plan was to scale down to  2 servings, but breasts were so thick i butterflied them into 4 servings.. after the flour dredge, I did an egg dip, then Panko... Have had too many problems with toothpicks .  So now I use a Singer heavy duty canvas/leather sewing needle  and cotton cord/cooking twine..  and sew em closed.. ..   Works amazing..  just be sure it's all cotton, no synthetics/coating.. after the 30 minutes, pulled out chicken..  and any black bits of panko..  added the whipping cream, stirred, scraping up as much of the fond  off the bottom of my stainless pan as i could with my silicone coated whisk......  ground some salt and black pepper into it.....   Gotta say..  That sauce Blew my Freakin Mind...  so much so, I could care less that it's 40% FAT..  I WILL BE making this again..  and again... and again.. It is now a Permanent Printed Recipe in my kitchen..  to make every couple months..

I had no ham, so I put bacon and it was delicious. I also had no wine, so I put a little bit of white vinegar and water. I served with white rice and sauteed potatoes. It was so good that I will do it again.

"C'est magnifique !", just the way it is. (Incidentally, Smithsonian has a nice piece on the origins of "the cordon bleu for cooking' and it did not "....originally {refer} to an award for culinary excellence given to women cooks! " Sorry Ladies. Seems it was a Gentlemen's award. But perhaps in America wishing makes it so?) It turns out very well without breading, if you're a no-carb family.  'Bon appétit' !'

The sauce is fantastic!  I've made this ''as is'' and it's great!  The next time I made it, I breaded the chicken roll up (see chicken cordon bleu I) and fried it...  I finished it off in the oven and dressed it with that velvety sauce mentioned in this recipe...  (use excess chicken grease from skillet to flavor sauce)

Delicious.  We did cut the breast in half and pounded them.  Also, after just frying the outside of the rolled chicken using a cast iron pan, we put in the over at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  Picked up from there with rest of recipe as stated.  My 17-year old son thought it was great.  The sauce with the cheese and ham made the chicken taste amazing.

Made this fabulous recipe as written EXCEPT....I made a pocket in the chicken breasts (thickest part) and angled it down so that once "stuffed" and cooked the cheese wouldn't run out.  Braised them on the cooktop until browned then finished in the oven with another splash of wine.  Just terrific.  Oh and I also wrapped the ham around the cheese to give me the best chance to keep the cheese inside the breasts and just placed it into the pouch. Easy.

This came out really delicious. Followed the recipe and used olive oil instead of butter. I made this for the wife and she loved it. We won't be making her recipe again.

This dish is very tasty but I made a couple modifications- 
I used 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil and 1 tablespoon of butter instead of the recommended 6 tablespoons of butter. 
I did an egg wash with almond milk prior to tossing the chicken breasts in the flour and paprika.
I added garlic and onion powder to the flour and paprika mix.
I added a bit of pepper to the stuffing (ham and swiss).
I added some smoked sea salt and ground pepper to the whipping cream. 
Lastly, I added a bit more ham and cheese then recommended.  Cheese usually flows out as it's being cooked so by adding a bit more cheese, it really made a difference.
It turned out great and I will for sure make this dish again!

I cook a recipe roughly as directed (unless I happen to spot a concern).  With the exception of adding a few glugs of olive oil with the butter, I left this recipe unchanged.   If you don't use the oil, you won't realize a proper medium high to high heat sear on the chicken which adds flavor and appearance.

WOW! Make this for company as it will definitely impress!   I had every intention of seasoning the chicken breasts with salt, pepper and garlic powder because I thought they would turn out bland, but I ended up forgetting and you know what? They surprisingly came out bursting with flavor! The sauce is absolutely delicious. I followed the recipe to a T and wouldn't change a thing except maybe the cook time.   I seared mine about 4 mins each side, then simmered for about 20 mins total. They came out super juicy.  I had pounded the breasts down to about 1/2".   This is going in my regular rotation!

Very good.  I pounded the chicken thin to shorten cooking time. 
 Then I used sherry wine and chicken broth instead of the bouillon.   I also just added a little flour to the sauce instead of cornstarch and cream to make it less fattening.   Everyone enjoyed it.

My boyfriend loved it! It was a PAIN to make, though. I will definitely be tying these little guys up next time instead of trying to hold them together with toothpicks! They really wanted to unravel while frying. I also added about one ounce of cream cheese wrapped in prosciutto to the middle of each of these along with everything else. You might try that if you want a little bit of an "American" flare.

So easy and yet so yummy. I had to adjust recipe according to what I had on hand and what my kids would eat.  So after banging up two chicken breasts, I folded up ham slices with cheese and salami (as I didn't have smoked ham on hand).  I drenched all sides and inside the chicken with chicken broth mixed with a little bit of onion powder before heating on stove top for 10 minutes.  Next time I'm going to put the chicken in the oven for 30-35 minutes.  And next time I'm going to cut a slit in the chicken breast before pounding it :)

Cooked as written (made sure to pound the chicken thin though), and it was delicous! I hadn't had this dish before, but my husband has, and he said, "This is the best Chicken Cordon Bleu I've ever tasted!"

Fantastic recipe! I will make this again. Everyone loved it. I followed the ingredients exactly as the recipe states. The sauce is to die for! The one minor thing I did differently was I made the sauce in a small pot and let simmer for about 5 minutes first. I cooked the chicken for about 10 min in the pan, placed them in a casserole dish, put the sauce on top and finished them off in the oven @ 375 for 20 min. They were cooked perfectly. Not overdone. Mine were quite thick. About 4" high so I was afraid they would be undercooked in the frying pan. This was turned out perfect.

Tasted very good, and it took me a good hour to complete.  It would be more worth it if I was making it for more than two. Maybe next time  I'll make extra for taking to work.

I make white sauces a lot so to mine I added about a cup of parmesan cheese and I also added a cube of chicken stock instead of a bullion cube, other than that I did every thing the same as the recipe- and my family loved it! Perfect for not quite the experienced cook too!

I used tenderloins rolled in breadcrumbs with paprika and garlic powder.  I put some dijon mustard inside the tenderloins.  I baked at 350 for about 25 min and cooked the sauce separate.  I doubled the sauce to serve over egg noodles and it was very well received.  I did put some butter in the sauce, but it was totally unneeded.

It was delicious, and low carb, but too much fat.  I will make it again, but instead of using all heavy cream I will use whole milk and/or reduced fat milk.

This dish has become a staple in our home.  The sauce is delicious and it is easy to make.  Barefoot Moscato is cheap and makes a great table wine for dinner.

Used Gouda Cheese instead of Swiss Cheese because I didn't have any Swiss.  The Gouda added a sweeter flavor than Swiss that has a slight bitter flavor.  
This recipe is easy to make.

Loved this!  So easy to make!  After reading a few reviews I changed the process a bit. I pounded my breast halves thinner, use prosciutto instead of ham (made rolling a breeze), and tied it with kite string (so much easier than using toothpicks), and used breadcrumbs.  I also started this on the stove halving oil to butter, transferred to a casserole dish and finished in the oven at 350 for 30 min. PERFECT!  I then finished the sauce in the pan so it could pick up the flavor from browning the chicken. Oh and I added the paprika to the sauce not the bread crumbs. Kids were skeptical but raved over it.  It would have been delicious as it's written this process just felt easier for me. Served with asparagus and spaghetti squash. Outstanding!

Amazing recipe. I like to eat it with a lot of rice, which goes great with the sauce and multiplies the number of meals you can get out of this recipe.

Seriously amazing. Better than any I've had at a restaurant! Use a quality ham that's not too thin, a quality cheese and you're SET. Also, to save some hammering time I butterflied the chicken breasts first and hammered it out the rest of the way.

I'll be making it again. It wasn't difficult to make. It just took a little time. Next time I'll use thinner ham slices and pound the chicken thinner. I never make gravy and even that turned out well. Plus it's super filling so we have lots of left overs.

definitely recommend an egg wash for the chicken.  I would also recommend a dry, sweet, cheap Riesling wine for the sauce!

Used Bread crumbs, instead of flour.  Sauteed in a little butter and then put in oven at 375 for 35 minutes.  Made sauce on stove with a little butter, wine, paprika, garlic powder and pepper before adding in heavy whipping cream with cornstarch.  Husband loved it!

Easy, delicious and perfect. No need for the cream or corn starch. Just boil chicken stock and white wine down for an au jus sauce.

My son picked this recipe out. Since he is such a picky eater I made it.  It was awesome!  I made no changes accept for the white wine.  I didn't have dry so I used a semi dry/sweet wine. Perfect!  I'll be making it again.

I made enough for 15 adults who RAVED about my cordon bleu. Some were kosher, so, following other sites, I opted for smoked turkey. I used the one-minute Hollandaise Sauce (amazing - and quick!!) for a little drizzle on this and the asparagus. Perfect for my "French Cuisine" Night of Romance!! With the left overs, I chopped all up and put in a deep casserole dish, added a bunch of spinach and added stuffing to the leftover broth mixture, put ontop and added the leftover hollandaise to that. Sooooo good!!

I suck. I followed the recipe and I probably didn't beat the breaths enough. It still tasted good but the chicken was dry in its thickest points and the sauce was too greasy. Still good but definitely user error. I'm also a fairly new "cook". I will try again

Made it! Yummy. Added the dijon mustard before rolling the chicken. Finished it in a 350 oven for 30minutes. Served with a side of penne and white pasta sauce and steamed broccoli. Quick dinner solution

Absolutely loved it.  My kids even helped make it.  When trying a new recipe, I try to follow to the "T" first time then play around with ingredients second time around.  This was so good, might not change anything.  Gravy was fantastic..... needs a touch of salt upon serving, that's it!

I will most definitely be making this again. I read where some people were concerned about the cheese melting out.  What does melt out incorporated nicely into the sauce.  For the sauce, I used white cooking wine.  The only thing I did which varied from the instructions was that I butterflied 2 large chicken breasts and cut them in half, making 4 pieces.  They were easy to pound out that way and manageable in size. Both my husband and I were thrilled with the taste, and we're appreciative of good quality, tasty and easy recipes!

Wow~a fabulous way to impress anyone--even if you're not a big chicken fan! My changes were these...I used leftover bacon grease and olive oil for frying. I coated chicken rolls in egg before rolling them in Italian bread crumbs. Everything else was done to spec. The wine sauce was equally amazing~So much deliciousness! Served with an herbal rice blend and steamed Asparagus with butter. Happy husband--happy wife! Can't wait for leftovers at lunch today!

My Family Loved this so much they made extra trips to my room that night to knock on the door just to tell me how amazing this was! One thing  I did that maybe others might want to watch out for as well. Make sure you slice the ham VERY thin if you choose to slice it yourself. I used turkey ham and made it far too thick and had trouble closing them. Took several tooth pics and a lot of ingenuity! I also added some extra wine and butter when it seemed a little too dry while browning.

This meal was awesome! I used kitchen twine instead of toothpicks to make it hold better. I also doubled the sauce recipe and used pepperjack cheese instead. It was a big hit with my family. I will add this to my collection.

My family loves this dish! I make a small change to it by adding a slice of two of Swiss cheese into the wine while it is heating up. I think this gives the sauce a little more texture and flavor.

Very tasty. My son said it was dank. Which is delicious in teenager language. Going to make the sauce a thicker next time.

Pretty easy to make, and tastes amazing! The sauce is fantastic and tastes good over veggies and rice as well. This is a frequent meal for us now!

I fell in love with cordon bleu when I was in the Army stationed in Europe.  I wanted to introduce this tasty dish to my kids and used this recipe to do so.  It is now one of their favorite dishes!  Thanks for sharing!

So Good!  This is one of my "I don't care if it's not healthy" choice dishes that gets made periodically.  It helps that it's a little time consuming, so I'm not tempted to make it often! But worth it.

This is a family favorite around our house. The only changes I made were using Canadian bacon, using fat free half and half, and making more of the sauce. We love the sauce so I added 3/4 cup wine and 2 cups half and half. Served with white rice and broccoli. Wonderful recipe!!! Thanks for sharing!

This was delicious! I love the sauce. I have never had much luck rolling up chicken breasts, and I was pressed for time, so I just cooked the chicken then put the ham and cheese on top part way through so it would melt. It wasn't beautiful my way, but it was yummy!

Very easy weeknight meal. Always nice to have a new  chicken recipe. I had larger breasts so I slit them instead of rolling the meat which shortened the cooking time. Sauce was great and absolutely necessary to pull the whole dish together. Will make again.

I bought the thin sliced chicken breast from the grocery store. Only simmered for 10 minutes and chicken was more than done.

Oh my God........ Soooo good. I could drink the sauce. Made it as written, with a few tweaks. Didn't have tooth picks so used twine to tie them together. Only had a sweet white wine so used that  and garlic infused chicken broth.  Amazing!

I have made this twice. We love it! It's actually not that hard. Even made it on a work night. The first time I made it as is and it was so good. The flavors all meld together. The 2nd time I made it I added a sprinkle of garlic and dried onions along with a couple dashes of pepper.  Towards the end I melted in a piece of Swiss cheese. Both time I omitted the butter and used coconut oil.  I might try the sauce without the whipping cream next time in an effort to cut down the calories.

This is a great recipe! You HAVE to cook to your own tastes though. For me, the amount of cream was too much. I liked a much stronger wine flavor, more better than bouillion, and i like to saute a bit of garlic before i deglaze the pan with a chardonnay. Also, instead of rolling, i cut a slit in the side of the chicken and tuck a big ole hunk of swiss wrapped in ham. With a few toothpicks to seal it up, the leaky cheese problem is fixed. I brown at med/high heat and then transfer to the oven- 350 for about 20 minutes.

I have made this recipe for years. I double the recipe for the six chicken breasts as the sauce is very flavorful.  I also use colored toothpicks as they are easier to find when it's time to remove them. This is a favorite in my family.

Really good! Was a little nervous as I have always seen CCB with thicker crust and baked. However this was quite nice. We did end up using more Heavy cream than suggested. It was a hit in my home! :)

Made this last night and it was delicious! My only change was to bake it at 350 for about 30 minutes instead of stovetop (that way I didn't have to stay in the kitchen and keep an eye on it!). The sauce was super, used Sauvignon Blanc as was mentioned in another review. It's a keeper!

I made only very minor changes to the recipe. I gave it a test run about a week ahead and had some trouble rolling the chicken after I pounded it. I use a gallon ziplock bag cut down the side, as it holds up well to pounding. I would like to say a huge 'Thank you!' to the reviewer who suggested rolling the chicken rolls into plastic wrap and twisting the ends shut, like Tootsie Rolls, then refrigerating them. (sorry, I couldn't find the review again) When I removed the roll from the wrapping it was easy to handle as I rolled it in flour, paprika, salt and pepper. I used butter and olive oil to brown the chicken, then transferred to a casserole to finish cooking through while I made the sauce.  Delicious! My guests agree.

Made as written, except I finished the chicken in the oven at 350, while I made the sauce. The family loved it, including three picky grand and great granddaughters. It's a keeper.

So delishy!!!....but I made a few changes. First I subbed out the cream with skim milk. Then I went with home made bread crumbs from corn flakes. I followed that up with replacing the game with turkey and chicken with bacon. I also deep fried it. Sooooo good! Great recipe!!!!!!

Followed the recipe exactly and the chicken came out way overdone after only 23 minutes of low simmering when I decided to check temperature in a few spots (185-195 deg.)

The sauce was just OK, we will try some of the other recipes for this dish.

First time making this dish, I thought it turned out great.  I did other reviewers suggestions of egg wash, panko and baking in oven.  The sauce is really good, it is what puts it over the top.  I had a hard time rolling my chicken, but I think it was lack of experience, taste was really good!

Okay I have made this recipe at the very least twice a month for the past 2 years. This is my kids (7 and 8) favorite meal. They beg me to make it every week. As with most people I do tweak it to suit our tastes. The changes I make are as follows. 1. I like to use smoked provolone instead of swiss it is amazing!  2. Instead of just flouring the outside of the chicken I do a more traditional breading of flour, egg, panko bread crumbs. 3. After I have browned all sides of the chicken I move it to a 350 degree oven to finish cooking . It normally times out perfectly to be cooked just right by the time I have made the sauce. The 4th and final change I make is I ALWAYS double the sauce. There has never been a time when we didn't eat every bit of the sauce. We always eat this with white rice, it's a hit every time!

I made it but I changed a few things out of necessity. I only had red wine and I only had hickory smoked roast beef- no ham. My husband and I LOVED it!!  Red wine gave it a really rich flavor. Next time I make it I will try the ham but gonna leave the red wine. So good!!

I used seasoned bread crumbs instead of flour.  Loved the sauce.  Easy for week night meal.

Delicious - very easy.  I used a package of 3 large skinless, boneless breasts.  Sliced breasts in half, put between plastic wrap and pounded each until about a half inch thickness give or take.  Did not have to use toothpicks.  Rolled swiss and ham with chicken, rolled in seasoned flour, then egg with a little chicken broth added, then rolled in panko holding bundle together throughout.  Placed individually in plastic wrap and put into fridge until ready to cook.  Did not use wine, all chicken broth instead, no granules.  Used half and half, and browned chicken in half butter half olive oil.  Ended up with 6 bundles, plenty of sauce.  Four of us, had two bundles left over.  Will definitely be making again!

This was delicious! I did make some changes though. My biggest complaint with any cheese stuffed chicken dish is seepage so, first I butterflied the chicken and continued to slice completely in half. I gently pounded my pieces of chicken until they were as thin as I could get them without tearing... about 1/4" or even less. Then I sprinkled with fresh ground salt and pepper. When adding the cheese and ham, I left a good 1 1/2" on both sides allowing me to fold in the sides before rolling, making sure that everything was tucked in.  After they were all rolled up, I tightly rolled them up in saran wrap twisting the ends like a tootsie roll and I placed them in the freezer for 30 min. After removing the saran wrap, I had a nice tight roll with no exposed cheese or ham. I then rolled them in flour, egg and breadcrumbs. To cut down on the fat, I browned them in a mixture of butter and olive oil. After browning them on all sides, I baked them for 25 min. There was no cheese seepage and they turned out perfect! The sauce was amazing as well! I added torn basil at the end. I'll be making this again!

Excellent! Made minor changes, coated chicken in egg and rolled in bread crumbs. Browned up on stove top first and finished off in the over. The sauce was made separate, added a lil white wine and even threw in some Swiss cheese and ham pieces to the mix.

Pound the chicken thin.  Makes for easier movement in the pan with tighter rolls.  Recommend string over toothpicks

I made it for my son and daughter in law when they came for dinner.....
Excellent!!!  My son thought I bought it and had to show the pan... Lol!!!
However, I made a change, I used chicken bacon, as I do not eat pork.
Tried both II and the first one..
I will surely cook when friends come around.

I make this as written using 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter (you don't need 6 T)  Also, I brown my chicken, make the sauce and simmer the chicken in the sauce until ready to serve.  I serve over low sodium chicken rice a roni and broccoli w/ cheese sauce.  This is wonderful and excellent for company.

This recipe is amazing. I've made it several times and it comes out great.  The only difference is that I use chicken stock in place of the white wine  since I dont always have it. It's even better the next day.

I made it with a few changes that I read in the comments. I made the sauce separate and baked the chicken at 350 for 20 minutes after browning in a pan with butter. My husband and kids enjoyed it. I discovered that I'm just not a fan of chicken cordon blue but I will make it again for my family.

The only thing I can say is, OH MY GOSH! This is delicious! I surprised my husband with a nice dinner at home last night and he was extremely happy! He just kept going on and on about it. I used Sauvignon Blanc as well. Also, I didn't have whipping cream and used half and half. The only other change I made was to mix about 1/4 cup panko crumbs and 1/2 t garlic salt in with the flour mixture. Then instead of finishing it on the stove, I just covered the iron skillet I started cooking them in and baked it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes. I will make this again and again!

I decided to make this based on what I had on hand using the Ingredient Search.  I followed the recipe with the exception that I used slices of pepper jack cheese, and we both loved this.  The video helps.  I think next time I will try the oven baked version that some have mentioned and keep everything else the same.  I'm thinking that this would be a great dish for my next dinner party.  Thanks!

Not having white wine or heavy cream, I used water and whole milk and it was still wonderful.  Husband and kids asked to have it again the next night - not happening!  But, will definitely become a "regular" in our rotation.  Maybe one of these days we'll invest in wine and heavy cream,  just for a treat.  Actually, pretty easy to do.

This was an excellent dish, I will make it again, soon!!  The only thing I did differently was cut the heavy whipping cream in half and still used the same amount of cornstarch.  Perfect creamy texture and not runny at all.

This was great. The only thing I changed was the bouillon granules and used one cup of chicken broth because thats all I had. Make sure you mix water to the corn starch before you add it to the pan.. Will make again but maybe will add a little more wine.

I followed the recipe as written with the exception that I used gluten free bread crumbs instead of flower, a cup of  chicken broth instead of bouillion and doubled the white wine. I wish I had mixed the cornstarch in some water before I added to the wine, it was hard to get it smooth. The chicken was very juicy and the sauce was delicious.

I made this for my 2 picky eaters and they both loved it.  Instead of bread crumbs for the coating, I crushed up some rice crispies.  Both the boys (husband and son) thought it was lighter, but didn't know why.

"Blue Ribbon" chicken is no joke- this was absolutely delicious. I made this recipe with no changes. I forgot to get toothpicks so it wasn't very pretty, but that didn't matter. The taste and texture were excellent. HUGE hit at our house.

This is a great base recipe.  So simple.  I used 1/2c chicken broth with a splash of white wine.  I also used skim milk instead of cream and it was healthier and delicious.   I added 1 tsp of salt to the sauce at the end with some dried basil.  I simmered the chicken in the broth for 15 minutes and then placed the chicken in a dish of steamed broccoli, poured the sauce over the top and baked for 20 minutes.  Served over rice.  My family loved it!

One of the best sauces I have ever made! This was an awesome dish, but it was the sauce that made this dish hands down. It takes quite a bit of work as expected but worth it. Loved it! My only complaint was my breading fell off my chicken but because of the sauce it didn't matter. You gotta try it. Seriously.

Made it as instructed. The only substitution was flour in place of  cornstarch, only because I didn't have any on hand.  Sauce thickened just fine.  Turned out amazing!

Very good! My boyfriend loved it. I made minor changes, coated the chicken in breadcrumbs and finished cooking in the oven. (About 10 minutes stove top and 15-20 minutes in a 350 degree oven.) I only made 2 servings, but 4 servings of the sauce. Simple, clean flavor and delicious. Paired it with steamed broccoli. Thanks for sharing this classic dish.

This is delicious! I used much less paprika in the flour coating (like, 1/4 a teaspoon) because I didn't want it to be too spicy. Also, I ran out of toothpicks so I used cooking twine; it worked well. Mine only took about 20 minutes to cook but maybe that's because all I could find in the store was chicken cutlets. The sauce is amazing! I served it with roasted potatoes and radishes. Will definitely be making this again! Thanks for the great recipe!! :)

Perfect dinner for our anniversary dinner!! Was so tasty and I had to stop myself eating it so I wouldn't gorge myself! I use a propane stove so cooking at the recommended temp browned my butter quicker so my sauce wasn't the correct color but it still tasted amazing!

Have to say - this was SUPER easy and inexpensive to make. Didn't change anything in the recipe and it came out delicious! Even my 6-year old daughter who doesn't normally eat Swiss cheese or "stuffed" anything enjoyed it. She devoured it! This will be a staple on the menu. And OMG - the sauce!

This was amazing. I did bake the chicken in the over for about 10 minutes at 350 because it was getting too brown in the pan, but that was my fault. The sauce was so delicious.

Perfect! This meal is amazing. I've made it several times. I too made a few changes. I browned it in the skillet then put it in the oven on 350 until cooked. I made the gravy in the skillet but doubled the recipe. The gravy is awesome! I poured it over white rice and made asparagus as the side. This is one of my favorite recipes on this website!

This is awesome! I buy already made Chicken Cordon Bleu from the deli at my grocery store. They told me to bake them in the oven. Ugh, they usually turned out dry. I wanted to try again with some different instructions. I followed this recipe exactly with the premade Chicken Cordon Bleu and it was so awesome! That sauce is amazing! Made for a fast week night dinner! I served it over roasted potatoes. Thank You!

This is a great dish to make! I mixed it up and used sliced pastrami instead of ham and sliced Munster instead of Swiss. I found that this gave a richer flavor to the sauce.

I've made this many times and everyone loves it. The sauce is amazing. Sometimes, I'll leave out the ham if I don't have any and it's just as good. I serve with wild rice and asparagus (or another green vegetable).

My husband asked for Chicken Cordon Bleu for Father's Day. I made it exactly as written. I doubled the entire recipe. It was absolutely delicious!!!  Amazing flavor.  The sauce was yummy and there was extra so my son is saving it to use on his eggs. I also made asparagus and we used the sauce on that as well.  This recipe is a keeper and I will definitely make this over and over again.

I changed some things because my chicken breast pieces were organic free-range and very small.  Instead of stuffing the chicken, I flattened it, breaded it and cooked it with the butter, wine and bouillon, then transferred the pieces to a casserole dish, covered them with crumbled bacon and layered baby Swiss on top.  I put the aluminum foil covered dish in the oven at 350 for about ten minutes while I prepared the cream sauce.  (I added a few extras to the cream as well for flavor.). After the cheese was fully melted I removed the chicken and poured the cream sauce over it and served it.  It was delicious and I think I'd rather do it this way only because I'm not great at stuffing things.

I added fresh mushrooms, three cloves of chopped garlic and used chicken base instead of granuals because that's what I had. Fantastic! Thank you for sharing!

I have been making it for years and years.  It is absolutely delicious.  I have a problem, though, pounding the chicken to a uniform shape, and find it hard to "wrap " the ham and cheese in the chicken breast.  Any suggestions?

This was easier than I thought it would be. I used chicken broth with the wine instead of bouillon. And skewers, trimmed, instead of tooth picks. I don't know how tooth picks would have done it, the wraps were too thick. I even had to have some and I rarely eat meat.

Very tasty.  The wine sauce was a little too rich, I think next time I'll use milk instead of cream.

OMG so delicious! I've made this multiple times and each time is better than the last.  I always double the gravy so I have extra to serve with the manditory mashed potatoes and peas.  Sometimes I bread the chicken and sometimes I just flour it - either way it's a wonderful dish!

Not bad at all! The sauce is very tasty. My kids don't like Swiss cheese so I used American from the deli instead. I overcooked the chicken a bit so it was dry. But still very good.

Was very nervous in the beginning because of the critics received on this recipe. OMG...this came so well and wine sauce was very delicious!  What people must understand when you cook, you cook with your heart and you can always add or change ingredients to your liking. That's exactly what  I did because I like well seasoned food. My family really liked this and I will serve it again!

I was easy to make. the hardest part was getting the chicken breasts flattened enough for the job. the next time I may try chicken tenderloins or something close and thin slices of ham.

I like it Chicken Cordon Bleu II .. ! In the first time, I follow everything on this recipe. Then I tried it again. But for the 2nd time I did not put white wine in sauce pan (personally, I don't like white wine in meal. I think that it makes sour taste and I don't like it) but I used chicken broth.

Turned out great.  Guests loved it too.  Used half and half instead of cream.  Definitely needed to pound chicken breasts.  I also cut them in half after pounding make smaller "rolls".  Only used 4 chicken breasts and it made plenty of food for 6 ppl.

Will make again, but maybe on a weekend next time, it is a little labor intensive for a weeknight.

Good base recipe. I cut 3 rather thick breasts in 1/2 length wise and flattened them some. They were all right at a 1/2" precooked thickness. I used a Pinot Grigio and added a splash more than what was called for and let them go the whole 30 minutes covered on low ... they came out just a touch dry. The sauce came out great.

Just to switch it up some, I'll use an egg dip and maybe some Panko bread crumbs the next time.

I've made this a couple times before.  However I too,  baked it instead of pan cooking.  350 for 30 mins.  Still moist,  but the next time I'll do 25 mins. Made 6 by halving 3 breasts and used bread crumbs with the paprika.  I used a smoky hot paprika.  Like I said,  I've made this a couple times  prior,  and I just can't get sold on the sauce like most.....I just find it meh and a little too salty.  This time I added some dijon and thyme....still just meh :( maybe next time I give it a little tarragon.  I'm always looking forward to this yummy sauce and I've yet to love it.  I like it,  but love is a bit strong emotion,  at least for me.  But the dish itself is great!  Also,  I make a little "burrito" with the cheese using the ham as my wrapper, then roll it up in the chicken.  Definitely  keeps the cheese from oozing out.

This recipe tastes fantastic but it costs too much to make. Next time, I'm going to use chewy bacon instead of ham to make it a little cheaper. I used chicken broth instead of wine because I dislike the wine flavor. Also, I plan on using frozen chicken breasts because they are cut more thinly. I used fresh breasts today and they were too thick and they fell apart when I tried to pound them flat. Also, I felt like 30 minutes  on low was too long to cook them even though they were still tasty and tender. Maybe 20 to 25 minutes.

I made it for the whole fam and had it for lunch the next day at school (in which all my friends wanted it..) everyone loved how moist and flavorful it was. I did add a few things tho. I dipped the chicken breasts in egg then flour which I have always done with my breading in general. The sauce didn't have much flavor thus no one used it so I added some herbs in which brought it as more appealing and worth dressing the chicken with it.

I use a moscato wine and it turns out perfect! I usually always at least triple the sauce and add it to my mashed potatoes. This is a family favorite in a house full of picky eaters!!

Incredible.  My mom and I lost all sense of propriety and almost licked our plates.  The sauce is outstanding.  I wanted to shove my face into it.  My chicken breasts were very thick and I couldn't pound them down so I butterflied them to be stuffed.  I was concerned about them fully cooking on the skillet without burning before they were done.  I browned the chicken on all sides as instructed, but then I put it all into the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  I finished it off with the cream sauce as instructed.  Awesome.

Great recipe. Moist chicken. Used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil. Sub in almond milk and use 1/2 corn starch and still turned out great! Even my 1yo ate it. :)

I kept all of the ingredients the same, however I cooked my chicken and sauce separately. With the chicken I cooked it in the butter for 10 minutes, rotating around and then 20 min in the oven at 350f. Amazing! both 10 and 12 yr old boys loved the chicken (not a fan of the sauce) and my partner loved everything.

Length of cooking was perfect for super moist chicken. I doubled the ham & ratio was perfect for us on super protein diet.

Loved it! I did make a few changes. I coated the chicken with egg and milk mixture, rolled it in flour mixed with seasoned salt and dry mustard, coated with egg mixture again and rolled in a mix of seasoned bread crumbs and flour. I used "I can't believe it's not Butter" as it doesn't burn as easy and a good Pinot.  I simmered it for 45 minutes then threw it in the oven at 300 while I made the sauce. I doubled the sauce recipe. Served it with rice and brussel sprouts. So good!

My family loved this recipe.  My son who is not a huge chicken fan has asked me a number of times now to make this dish.  The only thing I can recommend is to double the sauce.  The way it is written does not give you enough.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thank you for submitting this recipe.

I made this tonight for 2 adults, 13 and 11 year olds.  Everyone had seconds.  The only change that I made was using half butter/half oil and substituting wine with chicken broth (didn't have wine).  The sauce was out of this world.  My husband said that it was the second best chicken dish that I've  ever made.  We've been married 18 years so I take that as very high praise.  It was my chicken pot pie that pinned him down 18 years ago. ;)

I didn't change a thing about the recipe. It was delicious- especially the sauce. All of my guests loved it as well. Organize yourself before hand - it makes all of those "add at the end" ingredients easier to handle.

My husband and I loved this dish! My very picky son said it was "alright."  That's a complement coming from him. Only thing I did different is that I halved the recipe and I added Chia Seeds to the sauce just for extra fiber! It was very good and quick and easy to fix!

I made no changes to the recipe other than only using 3 chicken breasts because I only cook for myself and my boyfriend.  I love this recipe dearly and I have made it 3 times now, each time being just as fantastic. Its stays very juicy and the wine cream sauce is mind blowing. The trick to keep it from curdling I find is to not have the wine screaming hot and adding the cream mixture slowly, whisky constantly. I will make this now for the rest of my cooking days

Loved it, as did my son Eric. I had eight chicken breasts, so I spread them out into two separate frying pans, then when reserving the chicken, I consolidated both pans into one to make the sauce. With more chicken than in the recipe, I doubled the sauce.  When the directions say, "Pound the chicken breasts if they are too thick," that's too vague.  "Pound the chicken breasts to 1/4 (or 1/2) inch would have been more instructive. It would have also been helpful to know the recommended thickness of the ham. Mine was a bit too thick, which made it hard to fold into the chicken. I may use string next time. Using tooth picks can be dangerous if one is missed and they really don't hold the chicken together as well as cooking twine would. My son was on a tight schedule, so I sped up the cooking time by increasing the burner temperature slightly. My 1/2 inch chicken breasts were done in 15 to 20 minutes. Despite these minor complaints, the recipe is top shelf, one of the best I've found at allrecipes and to date, I've prepared nearly 600 different ones since becoming a member many years ago.

This was very good with changes per other reviewers. I brown the stuffed breast in the butter on the stove top and then finished them off in the oven at 350 degrees for approx. 20 minutes. I did need to use a little extra flour and paprika mixture for coating.  I also doubled the sauce and made it in the pan with the drippings using the 4 sauce ingredients & extra butter.  I served this with rice pilaf and steamed broccoli so the extra sauce went mixed in well with those side dishes. I have to mention that it was a pain trying to close the stuffed breasts with the toothpicks in the past so i used twine to close the chicken breasts instead.

My whole family LOVED this!! I had to sub milk and flour for the heavy cream (I didn't have it on hand) but it was STILL awesome! I served it with asparagus and new potatoes. I'll definitely make this at least once a month now. The flavor of the sauce is excellent!!

This was amazing! I doubled the sauce and followed one of the other reviews tips-pounded chicken, browned in pan with oil and butter, then finished baking in oven for 20 mins. I also added fresh parsley. This has ruined restaurant chicken cordon blue for me :)

Excellent! So easy! I had made a cottage roll ham the night before, so I used some leftover, sliced very thin.  I added fresh ground pepper and thyme to the flour mixture. Instead of using cornstarch, I used some of the flour mixture I had left. WIll be making this again real soon!

I took one skinless, boneless chicken breast and cut it evenly as filleting fish. With my left hand pressing on the chicken breast and right hand with a sharp knife cut each chicken breast horizonally in half. Then placed ham, then swiss cheese on top. Then carefully starting at one end, roll like you would a cresent roll. Secure with two toothpicks. Then follow the rest of instructions.

I have made this recipe many times, but I swapped out ham and Swiss for bacon and provolone. This has become the go-to meal for special occasions for me and my wife. We did this for Valentines Day this year, and always make enough to have leftovers for days. I serve this recipe over white rice with the sauce mixed in, cranberry sauce, and asparagus to add another color.

Loved this with a few minor changes. We don't use alcohol in our cooking, so I substituted chicken broth for the wine and it worked out great (1 chicken bouillon cube with 1/2 cup water). The broth was salty and added nice flavor to the chicken and then to the cream sauce. I also fried the chicken in olive oil mixed with a couple tablespoons of melted butter which lets the chicken brown nicely without the extra fat. Since I love bread crumbs, I also sprinkled 2 teaspoons of that on top of the finished product before serving. These were fantastic and I'll definitely be making them again!

By not being breaded as other recipes are this is low carb for those Atkins diet folks. Being a nondrinker I used chicken broth in stead of wine but it made a delicious cream of chicken sauce! Overall this turned out nice and got great reviews from the hungry animals I fed it to {my family}. Will make again

I followed the recipe exactly and found this cordon bleu to be the best I have ever made.  The sauce has a very delicate flavor and complements the chicken very well.  I served mashed potatoes and french style green beans.  The sauce was exceptional over the potatoes.  My husband and grandchildren were very complimentary and want me to make this again.

The sauce tasted nasty, chicken was annoying to cook, and I had to throw it in the oven to finish it off which caused the cheese to run off.

This......was.......GREAT! I too made a few changes.... I used some canola oil to substitute for some of the butter and added italian breadcrumbs and parmesan cheese (the powdered one) to the flour mix. Also I used a sweet white wine. I saw one person used chicken broth.....will be sure to try that as well!

This a wonderful recipe! The sauce is to die for!!! I've made Chicken  Cordon Bleu several times and this is by far the best...the sauce really put it over the top.  Make sure you pound the chicken.  Pounding to a half inch or a little less helps with rolling the ham and cheese and it tenderizes. Yummy!

Being that I cooked it in my cast iron dutch oven, the sauce came out looking VERY different than the photo, but it was phenomenal! I will make this as often as my wife will let me and might apply this sauce to other recipes. Amazing dish!

This is very good. I have used the sauce with pork chop pounded thin, stuffing in the middle. I put the sauce on top and bake in the oven. Yummy! Thanks for sharing.

I'm always trying to increase my level of cooking and so I tried this tonight.  It was beautiful but it tasted just so so.  The sauce was so plain that I added more chicken bullion and some pepper.  It was till very bland.  My husband thought it was ok for a change but I'm not sure I will make this recipe again.

Excellent! The best I've had. I browned first with butter, olive oil, and salt-free bouillon in the frying pan then baked @350 for 25 minutes. I also used Jarlsberg cheese. I made six pieces for three of us and it was gone in just a few minutes. Thanks so much to all of those who shared this recipe and it's variations. I'll be making it this way from now on.

Yummy! I'm not sure if I wrapped the cheese and ham properly but most the cheese stayed in the chicken, and the cheese that melted out actually made the sauce taste even better. I flattened out the chicken and used 2 pieces of cheese and ham per breast. Since there is only 2 of us I halved the recipe but because of other reviewers raving about the sauce kept that the same and glad I did! It was great to pour over the chicken and the stuffing I made as a side. 

Next time may try getting smaller breasts and having more cheese than ham.

Tasted fabulous.  I made it as stated in the recipe.  As others have noted, I would increase the amount of sauce as it's so good.  Only problem I had was folding the chicken and holding it together.  Next time I will try using cooking string and thinner pieces of chicken.

I have a roommate that spent the first 10 years of his life in France. I let him have a roll because he said this is his favorite meal. He ate it and said "this tastes just like home". I don't think there are any changes needed to this recipe; I would only consider breading the chicken before I roll it.

This is a lovely, easy dish, that I've made dozens of times, with my own tweaks.  I do season the breading with a bit of garlic powder, and after browning the chicken, I put the pan in the oven to finish, making the sauce in the pan after removing the chicken to a warm platter.  I double the sauce.  My other trick is to use uncooked spaghetti noodles as my toothpick.   The pasta cooks into the meat and there is no string or toothpick to remove.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used Pinot grigio I didn't care for it. Simmering it in the sauce made it mushy and breadcrumbs ruined the sauce.I may try this again and bake the chicken as well as use a different kind of wine.

OMG----delicious, decadent and easy.  The sauce was amazing.  I did use an egg wash and bread crumbs per our personal preferences but would think that it would be simply fabulous as written.  I certainly will make this again and share with friends--it is really that good.  Thanks for sharing!

This was absolutely delicious! I didn't make the sauce because well, I forgot. So I can't honestly review it. I do recommend pounding the chicken breasts after butterflying them and I rolled them in egg and Italian bread crumbs before baking. Hmmmmmm....so good.

Being from the Pittsburgh area, I used chip-chop stacked about as thick as the cheese slice instead of a ham slice.  The sauce was excellent made with a Pinot Grigio.  My wife raved about his dish.  Will definitely make it for guests.

If you are looking for a chicken dish with a rich sauce, this is your recipe. Excellent dish just not a typical Chicken Cordon Bleu.  If you are looking for a standard Chicken Cordon Bleu recipe you may want to keep looking.

This recipe is the "Chicken A La Suisse" recipe in the Good Housekeeping Cookbook from 1972 - with a few minor word changes but no changes to ingredients or amounts.  I have been making it for  over 40 years for Christmas Eve dinner and it's a family favorite and absolutely delicious!  Just be sure not to cook the sauce too long because it will break.  Enjoy!!

Very tasty! Definitely want to make chicken as thin as possible so it's easy to roll. I pasted chicken with dijon mustard, and rolled chicken breast in panko bread crumbs as well. Served with garlic rice and green beans.

I made this true to the recipe the first time around. Next time I make the sauce I will use about 1/3 of the wine and substitute the rest with chicken stock or broth. The flavor of the sauce was too strong for my kids' liking. I loved it, though!

Out of this world!  This is so good - just amazing.  I followed the recipe except for adding some Panko breadcrumbs along with the flour and it was fantastic.  Everyone loves it!

I made this tonight with my 7 year old daughter. It was delicious. The prep was a lot of work, but well worth it. My family loved it and we will definitely make it again.  I followed the instructions with the exception of using chicken broth in place of the wine. So good.

Awesome recipe. I doubled the wine, as we like the sauce. Also, I didn't use chicken bouillon. I didn't think it was needed. Excellent!! Thanks for sharing.

The chicken itself was perfect - the sauce was nice tasting but came out a little gluey.  I took another reviewer's advice to freeze the rolled up chicken breasts a little to avoid having to secure with a toothpick or anything else, and that worked quite well.

Absolutely loved it! I did use panko crumbs and baked instead of frying(just because I didn't realize I didn't have enough toothpicks, and they wouldn't stay together). The sauce was fantastic!

This is one of the easiest & best dinner's I've ever made.  I cut a chunk of swiss cheese, wrapped it in a piece of pit ham (folding the ends in as I rolled) and then rolled the flattened chicken breast halve around it & secured with 2 toothpicks each.  The 3 T of flour worked out well, but I only used 3 chicken pieces for it so if I were to do 6, I would increase the flour & paprika.  I used Sauvignon Blanc for the wine & it all turned out beautifully.  We had a ton of sauce, but who doesn't love sauce on their meat?   I served with Asparagus with Balsamic Vinegar Butter sauce & baked potatoes.  Perfect meal for my Veteran on Veteran's day.  Thanks for sharing!!!!

This recipe rocks!!!  The only thing I did differently was that I used thick boneless chicken breast and sliced them in half not all the way and stuffed them with 3 slices of ham rolled up and 1 slice of cheese and then placed the toothpicks through them...yummy. ??

We gave this recipe two thumbs up.  I didn't add the white wine because I didn't have any.  I just used 1/2 c of water and a bouillon cube.  It was most likely not as flavorful as if made with the white wine but it was still very good.  I might try the white wine next time I make it but I'm kind of a sissy when it comes to trying new things so I may just do it the same way.  LOL!

I made this tonight for my husbands birthday dinner. This is what he wanted for dinner. I didn't think I'd like it, but I believe it turned out great. I did do a few changes. I used vegetable oil in a skillet on medium heat and I browned the chicken on all sides. Then I transferred it to a baking dish coated with nonstick spray. I baked it in the oven for 35 minutes at 350° F. While the chicken was baking I cleaned the skillet out and put in 1/4 cup of butter (1/2 a stick) and 1/4 cup of Olive Oil. This cuts down some of the fat. I added 2 chicken bouillon cubes and the wine. I let this cook on medium heat until the bouillon cubes dissolved. Then I whisked in the cream and cornstarch mixture to the wine sauce. I did put a pinch of salt and pepper and a little bit of garlic powder (not much, that stuff is potent!) I served this dish with green bean casserole and mashed potatoes. It was very good and I will be making this again!

OUTSTANDING CHICKEN both times I made it. I am not a fan of wine so I used chicken broth the first time to make my sauce and just water the second time both times it was still PERFECT! Easy to make and a family pleaser. I used a good quality ham and had it sliced a little thicker than sandwhich meat =)

Divine!  This recipe is delicious, and the sauce is over the top!  Used "Better Than Bullion-chicken base" rather than chicken bullion granules, but either one would be fantastic.  Husband and son raved about this from the first bite!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Amazing recipe! I added more seasoning to the flour and it came out soooo good. I could eat all 6 myself. I may try to marinate the chicken first but we'll see how that goes

My husband and I loved it!! This was SO easy to make! I followed the cooking directions but doubled the cream and cornstarch to get more sauce. If you're having trouble getting the sauce to thicken turn the heat back up to medium. Mine thickened in a little over 10 min. I also added 1/4 c fresh chopped basil like one review suggested and it was perfect! I will make again in exactly the same way!

This was absolutely delicious, especially the sauce.  I wish I had more time in the day to make this more often.  I found that it was a little more time consuming than the recipe made it seem.

Excellent recipe. Loved the sauce although it curdled after sitting. Only change I made was I added a tablespoon of EVOO to the butter.

I purchased thin sliced chicken breasts which saved me the time of flattening chicken which was great! Rolled up cheese inside thin sliced deli black forest ham and secured with toothpick. Dipped in egg and then rolled in panko crumbs (about 2 cups) with paprika and pepper.  Put directly into a pyrex with buttered bottom and stuck in the fridge for a couple of hours while I got other parts of the meal ready. Baked at 375 (because I was also doing diced potatoes in oven that needed that temp). Baked for an hour covered with foil to keep in moisture. (I like my chicken tender enough to cut with fork and this was. Less cooking time would require to cut with knife). Made the sauce as written on the stovetop but took others advice and made 1.5 times amount. Because I was serving a crowd, took chicken from oven, sliced into 1-2 inch round slices, placed in a pretty serving dish and drizzled 1/2 - 3/4 of the sauce on top. Stuck back in oven (because we were waiting for some to arrive) and kept the rest of the sauce warm on stovetop. Normally I could have served at this point without putting back in oven. At serving time I put remainder of sauce in a gravy boat. People loved it. I served with garlic rosemary diced red potatoes and steamed broccoli. Delicious! Thank You!

Thank you for a wonderful recipe. All I did different was to add a touch of onion powder and seasoned salt to the flour. We don't use alcohol, so I used orange pelligrino and instead of heavy cream used 1/2 & 1/2.

Absolutely DELICIOUS.  Probably my favorite recipe on this site.  I used panko crumbs and ended up placing the chicken in the oven as was suggested by others.  Definitely make at least double of the wine sauce, as the sauce is truly what makes the meal.  I plan to flatten out my chicken even further and definitely cut in half, since the portion sizes were huge.  Serve with asparagus and wild rice (with chicken stock instead of water) to complete a fabulous meal.

Outstanding recipe. By far the best meal I've had this season. Really impressed the family. I made it exactly as described but added salt & pepper to the chicken before rolling it and used half butter half olive oil for the grilling part.  Definately adding it to my recipe box.

Followed the recipe completely for half the servings. Everybody loved it. 

Had to use standard cheese slices and used chicken soup powder instead of the bouillon as these ingredients are hard to find in Mumbai, India. 

Was heady and scrumptious. Served with lemon buttered basmati rice. 

Am making it again tomorrow because no one can wait longer for it!

This was delicious!  I did not have heavy cream, so I used half milk and half cream of chicken soup.  I added about 1/8 tsp of corn starch dissolved in a bit of white wine to thicken the sauce at the end.  I also added about 1 Tsp  of fresh chopped basil.  I served over egg noodles and covered with sauce.  Will definitely make again.

I added a layer of breadcrumbs to make it more crisp and (because I am overly concerned about my skill in cooking chicken) I browned it on the stove, then stuck it in the oven at 325 degrees for 45min, which was perfect for finishing the sauce and sides anyways

Very easy to make and very impressive to serve! I put the chicken in a large freezer bag and hammered with a real (clean) hammer! It worked just fine and was worth the effort.  I made it a second time with my 8 year old granddaughter and in some we used green chillies and cheese instead. Delicious.

Oh this is sooo good  -  I added a lot of dill weed and sweet basil to to the flour mixture as this really adds a lot of flavor.  

I used half & half instead of heavy cream and the wine I used was Pinot Grigio.    The ham was Boar's Head ROSEMARY & SUNDRIED TOMATO HAM and Boar's Head Switzerland Swiss cheese

Wow! This is a great recipe! One of the best I have ever made! 
I followed the recipe as close as I could. I decided to use almond flour with the paprika to coat the chicken. I did not have bullion cubes or the white wine so I used chicken stock in the pan when simmering. I also did not have corn starch so I used a little bit of flour instead. 
We had ours over cauliflower rice and it was absolutely fantastic! Low carb, not too high in calories and very tasty! Definitely will make again soon!

My favorite meal.  I double the sauce because I like it saucy.

This recipe is just perfect the way it is. I made it just the way it is posted and it was delicious according to everyone at the table.  Both my daughter's who are hard to get to eat most meats had second helpings and request  to have it again.. home run.

Great Recipe. I soaked the pounded chicken in buttermilk to give it a little more flavor.

I have made and used this one in a variety of ways, as stated, the sauce alone with another fish, and even cubed up the chicken sliced the ham and tossed it all over pasta with the sauce on top.  I am not a fan of wine, so the only wine I had on hand was a Moscato.  Fine by me! Used it and loved the sweetness! But I love Moscato so there's that. Otherwise the whole thing is great and my kids love it tossed over pasta.

This made me look like I knew what I was doing, thanks to RHCULLEN's review.  I used 2 large chicken breasts.  I coated in egg and then a bread crumb mixture that included the paprika and some garlic powder.  I browned them on all sides in 3 tablespoons of butter in my cast iron skillet and then transferred the skillet to a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes.  I made half the sauce recipe by melting the remaining butter (which was half of 3 tablespoons), wine and bouillon in a small pan and then adding the cornstarch/cream mixture and simmering until thickened.  I sliced the chicken into 1 inch rounds and served with the sauce on top.  Yummy!

This has become my "go to" recipe when people are coming over. Like others have recommended, I double the sauce. And in the interest of saving time I just cut a slit in the chicken for the ham and cheese to go in - rather than pound the chicken and attempt to wrap it around - so much easier!

This was awesome. It was my first time making chicken cordon bleu and I was a little intimidated but it was actually really easy and turned out great! I'm not a huge fan of wine in food, but decided to try it and would definitely not omit it.  The taste wasn't very strong but helped cut the richness of the sauce.  Will absolutely be making this again.

This is amazing. I messed up a bit by not so lightly mixing the corn starch and whipping cream, but I scooped it out and dropped it in the pan, added a bit of wine, some garlic powder, and some all seasoning and then whisked it in the pan until it became less separated by the butter / oil. In the end it came out fantastic!

this was ok, I followed the recipe except for adding a little oil with the butter, so the butter wouldn't burn(per other reviews).. used 4T of butter 2T of oil... the taste was ok, but it turned out very greasy & soggy and the coating didn't stick very well, I will not make this again... the sauce was good though.

This came out excellent and I will definitely make this again for others. This comes out as a gorgeous entree that would work well on a dinner date. The thing that I did differently than the recipe called for was that I did brine my chicken so that it cooked and stayed very moist and tender all throughout.

My sister in law and I made this for my brother and it turned out pretty well. We forgot to pound the chicken until the very end and it definitely makes a difference so try to remember to do that. I also didn't follow the recipe, I used a suggestion from a review. We rolled the chicken then used toothpicks to keep them together and dipped them in egg wash. We coated them with Panko and fried them until golden brown on every corner. We immediately put them in the oven for about 30 minutes. While the chicken was baking I made the sauce in the same pan with the drippings that I used to fry the chicken with. I'm not a big ham person so the taste got to me a little but everything else was perfect. you will want to double the ingredients of the sauce it's great!

Per the second comment, I browned the chicken (rolled in egg and panko) in a skillet and finished it in the oven. Made white wine and cream sauce on the side. Came out perfect!!

I followed the recipe exactly. The only problem I had was that the sauce didn't really thicken. However, it still tasted delicious. I recommend pairing this with rice to have something to mix that extra runny sauce with.

Pound the chicken breast to less than 1/2 inch thickness.  Roll lengthwise and tie with cooking string (makes it easier to roll around in the pan when browning).  Mix olive oil and butter as suggested, brown, then bake in the oven at 350 degrees for at least 20 minutes or until the chicken is no longer pink.  In the meantime heat the wine and 1/2 chicken cube with mushrooms if available, mix the heavy whipping cream with the cornstarch and add to the wine mixture, stir over medium low heat until thickened. Can add any fresh herbs available at this point. The servings are large, you will have left-overs, or can count on serving 2/3 breast/person by cutting into medallions.

This recipe is delicious! Made it twice now...the cream sauce (I made double amt)  blends real well with the ham and swiss cheese stuffing. And no baking needed!! That's a big plus!

Hands down this is one of the best recipes we've ever had! Literally we lick the plate lol. Only change is making a little more sauce than called for to add to vegetables (like spinach). Just makes the Yumminess last that much longer. Top 3 favorites of all time!

Good recipe, we'll be making it again.  Used broth instead of granules.  Next time I'll make it without the wine but that's because of the kids preference.

Amazing!  Absolutely amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly, with the following minor changes: I added a thin layer of Dijon mustard on the chicken, before layering on the ham and Swiss cheese (another user recommended this as a more authentic way of making the dish); I dredged the chicken in egg before coating with the flour and paprika mixture; I used about 1/3 cup of chicken broth instead of bouillon; and I used 2 tbs of corn starch to balance out the increased liquid from using the broth which increased the amount of sauce in the final product, which was definitely a great thing.  I will definitely be making this again!

I have always loved chicken cordon bleu and this recipe was right on the money. I have made these twice and both my wife and I have agreed that this has been the best thing that I have made from AllRecipes. I will be making this over and over. I like to use extra swiss and thicker ham.

I love the flavor, but I think I'll make one alteration the next time; frying the chicken as directed, but removing the liquid (setting aside until ready to make the sauce) to finish the slow saute. I'm a texture weenie, so I'd like something a tad crispier, but otherwise, this was very good and looked pretty, too!

Wow wow wow. Yummy! We have "family friday night dinner" at my home every week, and this recipe by far has been the hands down favorite with everyone, ages 16-81. What a delight! If you haven't tried this yet, do it now. You won't be sorry!

This was a very good recipe!  I felt the seasonings were too light for my taste.  I seasoned the chicken before dredging in the flour along with additional seasonings in the flour. I also added fresh chopped garlic to the sauce along with a squeeze of fresh lemon. I did cook them on the stove top as I felt the oven would melt the cheese too quickly and it would run out of the roll. I also used kitchen twine to secure the roll instead if tooth picks.

Delicious!  I took the advice of another reviewer and put the chicken in the oven for 20 minutes after quickly browning.  I also used chicken broth because I did not want to buy the wine.  When the chicken had 10 minutes left, I put the broth, bouillon, cream and corn starch in the pan and simmered until the chicken was done.  Moist, tender and plenty of flavor.  I will definitely make again.

Awesome in the extreme!  I followed the advice of some other reviewers and dipped the chicken rolls in egg then breadcrumbs and tied them with kitchen twine. After browning I baked them in a 350 oven for about 30 minutes and finished the sauce (wow! terrific sauce!) in the skillet I browned in.  Thanks so much for sharing Behr!!!

It was late, I didn't have Swiss, didn't do the flour and Paprika coat but did add a bit of flour to the wine/bouillon to thicken slightly THEN once I plated the chicken, I took 1 Philadelphia Herb and Chive Creme Cheese and 1 TBSP of Dijon Whole Seed Mustard, heated to just under boil with the wine/bouillon and poured over the recipe: Chicken Cordon Dijon!!! (the Bleu would be the Philly Cheese!
Fabulous! Next time I will try to do it per the recipe:)

I was very surprised at how poorly this recipe turned out for me.  With the fantastic reviews I had anticipated a sure fire success.  I believe I followed the recipe to the tee. I do not see where I could have fallen off the rails, but I must have.  The white wine sauce tasted nothing like what I have eaten in good restaurants.

I only made it for two so I basically used my own measurements but all the same ingredients. It came out so fabulous that I can't wait to make it again! I just need toothpicks instead of skewers. Also, you can't let the sauce at the end separate... Once it's hot, keep it hot- once it's cooled, it's done.

The BEST Chicken Cordon Bleu!! Double the sauce, you won't regret it!! I also add in a slices of prosciutto; this will also keep your swiss from running out into the pan. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

Followed the directions other than pounding the chicken out thinner and this is a 5 star. My guests said it is far better than restaurant quality. Yum.

Really good. Only thing I did different was through it in the oven after browning it in butter, just like some of the other reviews said at 350 for 20mins, and doubled sauce. Turned out great, will definitely make again.

Instead of browning these, I flatten the chicken breasts, then roll them up with Jarlsberg cheese, one slice of ham, and a teaspoon of butter, then place each in a muffin tin. Bake at 375 for 20-25 minutes: they come out perfect every time. I serve them with Bernaise sauce (two T each) and they are delicious.

Since chicken is sold by the pound, not the # of breasts, I purchased 2.25 pounds.  I couldn't find the right poundage in breasts, so I bought thinly-sliced breasts instead.  They ended up being smaller and I had a lot more bundles, but I think eaters preferred the smaller size.  I ended up having more ham & Swiss per inch of chicken, which was also a good thing.  I did have some trouble sealing the bundles, though.  Some of them ended up being cups with toothpicks sticking out of the top like a porcupine.  Obviously, I wasn't able to sear the top of those bundles, but they cooked just fine.  No trouble with the sauce.

This chicken cordon bleu turned out great for me. I am new at cooking, and it was very simple for me to make! I loved making it too, learned so much.

First time I ever made this recipe I fell in love with it. I have not made many different chicken cordon bleu recipes so I am a bit inexperienced, but this was simple and astonishingly delicious. Thank you Chef John!!!

This is a great base recipe, and with some creativity, it can be made several ways. I don't coat the chicken with flour. It adds too many carbs to the meal and the fat content is already too high. I use half olive oil, half butter to cut some of the fat. I fry it quickly, just enough to brown the breasts, then remove and place in a baking pan. Instead of white wine, I use chicken broth mixed with the bouillon granules, and put it in the bottom of the baking pan. I also add a whole bunch of fresh garlic to this recipe. It makes it absolutely incredible, if you're a garlic fan! I slice cloves and roll them up with the chicken/ham/cheese. I add garlic slices to the chicken broth. And I also add minced garlic to the sauce. It's really, really good and a big hit every time I make it.

Great!  I added a bit more chicken bouillon granules and a pinch of salt to the sauce. I also breaded the chicken instead of flour, and spiced up the breading with some onion and garlic powder and some basil.  I also follow some other recommendations and didn't simmer the chicken in the sauce, but made the sauce separate and poured it over the chicken after.  It came out delicious!

I loved it and my boyfriend was so impressed. I took the advice of two reviews and mixed them together.  I used an egg before covering with flour mixture.  After browning on all sides I put it in a pan instead of leaving on the stove and added ingredients except substituted chicken broth for wine. Then baked at 350. It's easier to bake things with my son around the kitchen. I simmered the sauce by itself and added basil. I did make a mistake and bought mozzarella sliced cheese instead of swiss and loved it. This went well with the  allrecipe  for baked asparagus and parmesan  couscous (I used a box recipe)

Huge hit at my dinner party! Said they felt like they were eating at a 5 Star restaurant!  My adaptations ~ used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil for browning, added an egg wash between flour dips for extra crispy version, doubled the sauce portions, placed the cooked chicken in the oven at 350 degrees while preparing the sauce (kept them hot) and side dishes - this is served great with Salad, Spaetzle and fresh Haricots Verts French beans. What a keeper!

I placed the chicken wrapped with ham and swiss into the slow cooker first (low for 4 hours). Then, I poured about 1/2 of the cream mixture (used half and half) on top and it was plenty. Very tasty!

This is so amazing. I just opened it up because I'm making it this evening and realized I hadn't posted a review. WHAT! I always use white wine vinegar because I don't drink wine (I know, I'm weird) and shelf life fore white wine vinegar is  near forever. I can't imagine this recipe being any more delicious but it probably is with dry white wine. I'm afraid to try... I may pass out. It's that good. Thank you for sharing this with the world.

Amazingly elegant and simple to make. The quality/taste belongs in a fancy restaurant...soo delicious! The secret : the Sauce: to die for! Quick note-  I also prefer to bake for approx 50 min in 350 degree oven, and used bread crumbs instead of the flour to coat.  Doubled sauce recipe & tweaked sauce base on stove(since i was baking chicken) w/ 1 tbsp butter with 1 cube boullion , & melted in some swiss cheese ....along with whipping cream and lots of wine, of course. This recipe is a Must Try...you will not be disappointed.

This is one of our favorite recipes and is always a big win with company! The only thing I change up is that I butterfly chicken breast, and stuff them with two slices of cheese and ham. Secure them with tooth picks as well as possible so I don't loose the stuffing. Everything else is the same, however I would most definitely double the sauce and try not to cook the sauce for much longer then directed or you loose a lot of the wine flavor!

Very tasty! Make sure your chicken breasts are big enough to accommodate the ham and cheese or else the cheese leaks out.  I would make these again.

Do to Gluten Allergies We used G.F. Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Baking Flour.  Also Mixed in 3 tablespoons of G.F. Breadcrumbs (original) with the flour & Paprika.  My Family Just Loved IT.

Delicious!  Was always reluctant to try making cordon blue after another recipe came out badly but it's definitely back on my menu plan now! The only things I change are that I finish it in the oven and make at least double the sauce - there's never any leftover!

Agree with the brown then hold in 325 oven to finish cooking; keeps the coating crisp.  I prefer .5 sherry, allowing a minute for the alcohol to burn off and then a half cup chicken broth when making the sauce.

Awesome taste to this recipe….! Make sure to leave some of the juices from the chicken in the skillet while whisking the cornstarch and whipping cream.

Great recipe! I used Better Than Bouillon instead, basically the same thing. Be sure to use chicken cutlets or pound out your breasts thin to make rolling easier. When I make this I usually double the "sauce" by doubling wine, corn starch, whipping cream, & bouillon- the extra sauce goes well with diced boiled potatoes on the side, a great gravy! I usually use quite a few toothpicks to hold it all together, tricky to remove until it cools a bit. Impressive meal!

I love it just the way it is. Just like my mom's. I lost the recipe and was so glad to find this. I just suggest doubling the sauce if you like a generous portion of sauce.

This recipe was a hit last night for guests.  I did change some of the ingredients based on what I had on hand, but it still turned out really yummy.  Maybe some of these options will encourage you to try the recipe even if you don't have everything listed.
no wine: water worked for me (I did have oddly enough a little white wine vinegar and splashed some in...)
no swiss: mozzarella worked for me
no whipping cream: whole milk worked for me
I also seasoned each piece of meat with salt and pepper before rolling them up.

I have tried this recipe several times and love it more each time. I use prosciutto and provolone (family preference). As for the reviewer who said this needs a sauce...It does have a sauce it was step number 3. Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

The chicken was very moist but I thought this was only OK. Not enough flavor. Maybe more herbs and cheese in the sauce?

I used a thin omelette with thyme, marjoram, mint and parsley.  I rolled it up and wrapped it tightly in greaseproof paper and boiled it.  Served cold, sliced.

Made this tonight with just two chicken breasts and since we didn't have the heavy whipping cream for the gravy, I ended up using turkey gravy. Also didn't have swiss cheese so I used shredded mozzarella. Anyways, it came out fantastic!! The husband loved it and our little one year old actually ate it all. I'll be making this again.

This is the best chicken cordon bleu recipe! I decided to try it after work. I was concerned because I didn't have any white wine on hand and reviewers said it really made the sauce delicious. Next time I will be sure to have the wine stocked at home, but no worries. It was so good anyhow! Preparation didn't take too long either after a day at work. My family complemented how good it was. This is a keeper!

We all loved this recipe!  My chicken breasts were thick so I sliced a pocket into each and filled the pocket with ham and cheese, then secured with a toothpick.

This recipe is wonderful!  I did change only the butter...I used 3 tablespoons of butter and 3 of olive oil.  The sauce is delicious also.  I am gluten intolerant so I used gluten free flour, otherwise, the rest of the recipe is gluten-free!
This is marked now as one of our favorite recipes!

Excellent recipe.  I butterflied and then marinated the chicken breast for 24 hrs prior to cooking.  I marinated in a soy/ginger low fat dressing.  I also sliced up some fresh ginger for the marinade.  I know this sounds a bit off, but it added a great flavor.  Instead of frying the chicken for the entire time, I braised the chicken/ham/cheese in a skillet with the above ingredients before moving to the oven (cover) and cooking for about 20 mins.  I used the juices/droppings in the pan to make the wine sauce.  

My wife and son loved it and were already asking when would I be making it again.

This recipe was just fantastic. I pretty much did exactly what I was told to do except for a few minor changes. I added Progresso bread crumbs to each side of the breasts, then the ham and finally the cheese. Afterwards, I sprinkled them still with the flour concoction up above. Then cooked them as suggested. When they were all done, I removed the chicken breasts, and began making the sauce. I used the grease that was in the pan to aid to the taste as well as putting a chicken bullion cube in it too!! It was scrumptious! They were gone that day and it was only two of us. Thanks so kindly.

This is a great recipe. I made a few small changes, such as pounding the chicken to about 1/2" to make it easier to roll. But the sauce was amazing! So simple and faster than the 30 minute cook time (probably because of flattening it). My six year old LOVES it! This can easily be prepped up ahead of time by rolling the chicken the night before if needed. Anyway overall this is great and is going to be added to the weekly menu.

I made this as written with the exception of using white wine vinegar in place of the dry white wine (i didn't have any) and OMG it was SOOOO good. If you decide to skip the sauce you are doing yourself an injustice!!! Thank you for the wonderful recipe

I used frozen chicken breasts, thawed and cut in half. When pounded out they were pretty difficult to wrap with the Swiss and ham. If I were to make this again, I would not halve the chicken as it was too small. Also, the sauce was too rich for our taste. Could do with half and just put a dollop on top each piece of chicken.

This was just okay. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 oil to pan fry the chicken. It was too greasy for me. I would prefer baked cordon bleu. However the sauce was tastey and interesting.

Made this last night and it was a huge success. I didn't change a thing about the recipe other than doubling the sauce at the end.. once removing the chicken, I first added more wine and let it cook off a bit before adding the cream and corn starch. I used a Chardonnay. I think it's the cream sauce that makes this dish so amazing.  We have only a handful of dishes all our kids will agree on, but everyone in our family of five raved about it!

BEST cordon bleu I've ever had (and that's comparing it to any restaurant)!! Made changes mentioned by someone else and did the egg wash and breadcrumb/paprika mix which definitely added a nice texture. Absolutely AMAZING!!!

This recipe was pretty decent.  The first time we made it we made it exactly as the recipe called for.  The 2nd time we doubled the ham and cheese and used a mushroom sauce.  We felt that the original sauce was too bland.

I love chicken cordon bleu, but for some reason this one didn't turn out as I like. No one in my family liked the consistency of the coating on the outside of the chicken. I don't think I will use its recipe again.

The actual chicken cordon bleu was really tasty. I used fresh deli ham and Gruyere Swiss cheese from the deli. The flavors worked very well together and instead of flour I coated the chicken in egg and used seasoned bread crumbs. However, I did not like the amount of butter that was used to cook the chicken it was overpowering and some of it burned while it was cooking for a half hour. I also did not like the texture of the sauce. It basically tasted like thick butter and the consistency was weird. Next time I will use a reviewer's advice and use 3 TBS butter and 3 TBS EVOO, brown for 10 minutes in the skillet and finish cooking the oven at 350 while making the sauce separately.

Delicious! You HAVE to make this. 
I love this recipe! It is AMAZING. I used Pinot Grigio for the dry white wine. 

Chicken: I baked it instead of pan fry and simmer. Used Italian bread crumbs with a teaspoon of the paprika instead of flour and paprika. Also, I put spinach leaves in the middle with the Swiss cheese and ham as shown in the picture. 

Sauce: Since I baked the chicken I just let the white wine and butter simmer for probably 15 minutes before adding the rest of the sauce ingredients.

I loved the flavor. I didn't make any changes since it was the first time. Next time I will try it with broth instead of wine. Unless you have a very large saucepan-like skillet with lid, or you really roll the chicken tight, you're only going to get 4 maybe 5 in a pan. I had to use two pans, and the second pan wasn't up to the task. You're frying with butter, so temperature control is paramount in not burning the butter; you need the right kind of saucepan-like skillet with lid to do this right. It was a tale of two batches for me. The one in the right skillet, cooked at the right temperature was perfect. Luckily, I was able to make the sauce with that non-scorched pan of butter and stock. I think the next time I make it, I will only make 4 servings, and it will be totally awesome. I'm a tough critic, and through it all, I got nothing but rave reviews from the family. Did I mention NOT burning the butter?

My husbands favourite dish on allrecipes! Made this many times and I have never changed the ingredients but I do tie the chicken with cooking string instead of using toothpicks. You don't lose any of the cheese if you do it that way!! The sauce is to die for!! Awesome recipe!!

I like this a lot, but it was missing "something."  Next time, I'll season the chicken with more than just paprika, and add a tiny spread of Dijon mustard to the roll up.  I bought thin-cut chicken breasts, and they still weren't quite thin enough.  The stated recipe should make this a mandatory step - the chicken breasts should be pounded to a quarter-inch thickness.   

Just remember, the quality of the sauce is dependent on the quality of the wine.  I used a good, oaked Chardonnay, and the sauce was definitely the best part of this dish.  Delicious!

I am a novice cook and this recipe terrified me; however, the directions were straight forward so I decided to give it a try.  This was my first rue and such a great addition to the cordon bleu.  I totally recommend this one to stretch your cooking muscles and impress your guests.

I loved this recipe but found it a bit too salty using chicken bouillon, next time I will sub with salt free chicken broth. I added more wine as it simmered and a pat of butter at the end of the sauce. It was delicious and basically followed recipe as written.  I will serve it to my dinner quests in the future.

WOW! This was absolutely the BEST dish I have found yet on allrecipes! The chicken, sauce, everything was amazing. I followed the recipe exactly, didn't change a thing, and I'm glad I did. Everyone that I had over for dinner couldn't praise it enough. I served this with mashed potatoes(made extra sauce to drizzle over them), green beans (made with ham), and french bread. I will definitely make this again and again. Thank you so much for an awesome recipe!

I have to say with a couple changes that chefsingledad had suggested, it turned out deeeelicious. I have two other Chicken Cordon Bleu recipes and I thought they were good but this one is the best. Thank you

This is my husband's favorite dish, hands down. He tells me I should make extra sauce and bottle it, so he can put it on everything non-Cordon Bleu. :) I use Sauvignon Blanc and thick-sliced lunch meat ham. Cut the ham and Swiss cheese in 1/2 lengthwise, then stack on top of each other to prevent so much cheese oozing out the sides. Comes out perfect every time!

Great base recipe. It's hard to rate a recipe when you do not follow it exactly but, come on, many of us change things in most recipes we find. I love this site because I always check reviews and find what people did different and I usually go by the majority. As many others did I doubled the sauce and I used an flour then egg then panko bread crumbs to coat the stuffed chicken. After browning I finished in the oven for about 25 minutes at 350 while I made the sauce. The sauce was spooned over at the end.  The next day I had two servings left but had to make more sauce. This time, my fiancé made the sauce and he added some garlic powder and it was even better.  Enjoy!

My son's high school Culinary Arts class used this recipe, and he loved it so much that he has made it for us
 twice at home.  It is delicious served with saffron rice.  The sauce is soooo good!

Delicious! I used milk instead of cream once, as that's what was in the fridge, and it was still delicious, just not as thick.  Thanks for sharing!

I love this recipe! Made as is all the way until the sauce then I added some salt and basil it made it perfect. When I heated the pan I also put half butter half olive oil. 
 Most people this is a given already, but for some I feel they do not know when you make the sauce DON'T clean out the pan before adding the starch and whipping cream.

Also the wine I used was rare find  vintage 2010 California Chardonnay . It made the whole thing come together.

Boyfriend said its possibly the best cordon bleu he's ever had! I had to improvise quite a bit the first time I made this. I only had beef bouillon cubes and used cream sherry instead of a dry white wine. Still was a big hit!! Its fairly easy. I am just learning to cook and was able to make this and not screw it up, so I definitely recommend it.

This was pretty good. I did opt to bake instead of cook on the stove top and I made the sauce with 1% milk to cut calories a bit. The sauce came out ok it just needed a little bit more cornstarch.

Made this for my fiance and myself for dinner tonight (scaled down to two servings), and it was a big hit! We had brown rice on the side, and it did quite nicely with the white wine sauce. Will definitely add this to my list to make again!

The chicken was well done and tasty. The pan sauce refused to thicken however. Overall, a very solid recipe.

I will admit, part of my problem with this recipe is a personal preference.  Not many tasks in the kitchen bother me, but pounding chicken flat is one that drives me crazy.  I tend to avoid recipes that require it.  That aside, once I got done doing that and stuffing the chicken, I realized that getting the chicken nicely coated with the flour mixture was going to be difficult and that once I would try to pan fry all the filling would ooze out.  So I decided to cook it in the oven instead.  The chicken was ok this way, but having to cook in the oven made it tougher to thicken the sauce.  Bottom line, this recipe is way too troublesome for the final results.

This was excellent; however, I did things a little differently.  I did not dredge the chicken in flour, instead, I mixed the paprika with Seasoned bread crumbs.  I sprayed a 9x13 glass baking dish with butter Pam, placed the chicken in the dish and sprayed the chicken with the Pam to wet the breadcrumbs.  I baked the chicken at 350 for about 25 minutes.  Then I added about 3TBS of butter to the sauce ingredients, which I cooked in a sauce pan on the stove top.  I served the sauce separately so each person could use it to personal taste.   Super easy and quick!  Will definitely make it again!

I made this with Black Forest ham and havarti cheese and it was excellent. The creamy sauce really is what makes this recipe great. My husband said it was the best meal he had ever eaten. I browned the chicken and then put it in a 350 degree oven for 20 min while I made the sauce.

Amazing!! I made chicken "sandwiches" though because I had trouble wrapping it. With the toothpicks' help, it came out great and that sauce is soooo yummy. Paired with fresh asparagus.

Easy & Awesome! Used left over mild gouda instead of swiss.  I ended up cooking the chicken all the way through in the pan. After I removed them I made a sauce with the left over fat/flour/splash of cream/white wine/dijon mustard & water from my boiled carrots/onions/coriander.

Yum, yum! Changed up a few things that made it easier to make and (in my opinion) more delicious. . . Butterflied the chicken breasts, so that I didn't have to make a mess pounding them and waste some plastic wrap. I stuffed the chicken with sliced spiral ham--healthier and heartier than the deli stuff and did NOT include the cheese. I followed the directions for browning and cooking on the stovetop, but instead of adding heavy cream, I added milk and stirred in about two cups of shredded Swiss cheese, and made a cheese sauce! I always hate how the cheese leaks out of the stuffed chicken, so I just thought: What the heck? I'm making a sauce instead! It was so delicious altogether. I'm sticking to my way from now on. :) Great recipe!!

This is the BEST chicken cord on blue recipe I have ever tried. The only change I made was I didn't use the tooth pick to hold in place because it was too hard to turn them in the skillet. great taste, love the wine in it. Makes it a little tangy:)

Absolutely delicious!  My husband said we can add this to the list of favorite dinners and things to make when company comes!  I didn't have white wine so I used a red, excellent!  Our son heated it up and ate 4 hours later and said it was still delicious.  I'm not much of an advenrurous cook...tend to stick with plain, familiar dishes.  My husband says my food always tastes good, but usually doesn't look all that great.  Well this one he said was beautiful:0)  Definitely a keeper!

This was really good.  I used chicken broth instead of wine, and I added some swiss cheese to the sauce.  Assembling the chicken was a pain, but once it fried in the butter, the cheese started getting gooey and crispy, and it made it all worth the effort.

After the first time, my wife who never had chicken cordon bleu, stated that this is only way that she ever wanted to eat chicken. Needless to say it was fantastic. Since then I deviated some, like using prosciutto and mozzarella.

I normally do not leave reviews, but this recipe was to DIE for! My boyfriend absolutely loved it and so did his dad. Huge hit! The sauce was amazing and I didn't change anything about the recipe. I will definately be making this again!

I did substitute half-and-half for the heavy cream, and it worked out fine.  I also did not have white wine, so I substituted chicken broth, instead.  Loved it!

Found the text instructions a li'l intimidating but I found the video demo very helpful! I breezed throughout the entire process. I must say this recipe's excellent, and I wouldn't change a thing about it. It was a hit with everyone in the household! What a wonderful lunch we all had.

This was very good. I tweaked it by preparing the chicken, ham and cheese in the rolls, placed them in a baking dish, sprayed with olive oil cooking spray and sprinkling with paprika. Then I mixed the 1/2 cup of wine and bullion, poured it in the baking dish and baked them for about an hour. I prepared the sauce separately on top of the stove (using the butter, 1 tbsp flour, wine and bullion again and all the rest of the ingredients) and just poured it over the chicken right before serving it. Baking the chicken vs. preparing it on top of the stove is just less messy and predictable for me. My guests and my husband LOVED it! Thanks for the great recipe.

PERFECT!!! Best chicken cordon blue I have ever had! I bought the chicken breast already flattened so that saved me time. This is so filling I would serve it by itself or with a salad.

This recipe is brilliant and surprisingly easy! The sauce is really easy to make, and can go with a lot of other things too. I also added button mushroom to the sauce and used replaced half the cream with milk and halved the white wine. This is a super hit at the dinner table, and I will definitely make it again.

Absolutely LOVED it! I added a little sea salt and parsley flakes (I'm addicted to them ::droooool::) to the flour and paprika mix. But I'm sure the recipe was amazing even without that! 5 stars!

This recipe is a hit! We had my boyfriend's grand parents over for dinner and we decided to make this dish after having made this reciped a few times ourselves and his grandmother (who is an amazing cook) asked for this recipe! The only tip I have is that I have always used Chardonnay for this recipe, but that is because I had it in the house.

Do not over cook the chicken and you will give it 4 or 5 stars. I used water instead of the wine and it was still awesome! Will make again.

To Die For!  I made this for my Valentine's present for my boyfriend, he loved it and so did I, the juices ran out of the chicken with the cheese -- the chicken was cooked just right.  

Although the directions seem daunting and challenging, follow it through its worth it!  Oh the flavor!

My family's favorite dish!  I made the recipe exactly as it is above, although I usually double the ingredients for the sauce, since my fiance likes it so much. I usually use honey ham I get from the local deli-- it works really well here.

This recipe was AWESOME!!  The only change I would make is to use unsalted butter instead of salted.  I felt that it was just a tad bit too salty for my families taste but overall this chicken cordon bleu recipie is the BOMB!!  I will definitely be making this again for sure!!

I love to find out that I can cook something rather well... I can't imagine why I ever would have thought Cordon Bleu would be a challenge -- maybe its the French name, who knows. But this is an excellent recipe made even better by so many helpful tips & comments. I definitely doubled the sauce since I made seven - the extra sauce dribbles wonderfully over rice pilaf and broccoli. Very highly recommended.

I was a little nervous to try this, I had never rolled chicken before... but it came out great- my wife said this was the best thing I have ever made...I loved it & have made it 3 times already. Not a quick meal to prepare, so great for the weekend.

My husband has been begging me to make Chicken Cordon Bleu for some time.  I have finally found a recipe worth making again, and again, and again.  We both loved it and I didn't change a thing!

I made it tonight and the entire family absolutely loved it!!!!!!  I made just few changes: I used 1.5 cups of cream and also finished chicken in oven for last 15 minutes or so to have a more firm texture.

I thought it was real good, but everyone I served it to thought is was just okay and worth eating, just not enough to knock your socks off. Will try again and keep in my recipe box no matter what.

Followed exact directions. The sauce took away the taste of the chicken. Way too rich. Won't make again.

Found this nearly impossible to roll. Filling went everywhere. Far too fiddly for a mother of four to spend time on. Taste was fine but life is definitly too short to make this again.

Both my lovely wife and I agree that this dish was a winner and would likely make it again.  I prefer a bit more swiss cheese so I simply melted more of it atop my chicken. Of course I made a bit more sauce than the recipe called for just because I made noodles to pour it over. Yummy!!

I thought the cream sauce was not sufficient, and I use seasoned bread crumbs for added flavor and  I triple the sauce when I have a formal dinner.

This is so easy & so delish!  Used the full-fat ingredients only because we happened to have them on hand.  Next time I'd use low-fat swiss & make the gravy with milk instead of cream...but only so I could feel less guilty about having dessert afterwards!  :)

This recipe was simple and easy to make.  The bread turned out a little sweet too (which I liked).  I didn't have bread flour so I added 2 tablespoons of gluten flour to the all-purpose flour which helped it rise even more.

What makes this recipe incredibly good is the white wine sauce. We make our chicken cordon bleu the way we always have - breaded cutlets with the ham and swiss (or gruyere if we have a few extra $) place on top, into a 300 degree oven for 15-20 minutes so the cheese can melt. Now while that's in the oven I make the sauce and it totally makes the dish. Because it's so rich and fattening, this is a treat for special occassions.

This was an amazing meal.  I was worried the flavor wasn't going to be there, no bread crumbs used.  But the flavors were there, in everything.  Just enough wine taste, the white sauce was so good mixed with the chicken.  My husband loved this! I will make this again.

I made this for my wife and guests on Valentine's Day.  It was amazing and very easy to prepare.  The sauce was a highlight and you definitely need to make extra.  Not recommended for anyone watching their calories but for a special occasion it is ideal.

Came out GREAT!  The sauce is DELISh!!! although, it took me while from start to finish but I'm sure I'll get faster at prepping the more I make this Wonderful dish! didn't have heavy whipping cream but found a substitute recipe online (whole milk & butter).  Also, didn't have ham - so used turkey bacon instead.

I enjoyed making and eating this recipe.  I didn't have dry wine and used a sweet Moscato.  The recipe calls for "folding" the chicken over the ham and cheese instead of rolling it.  You absolutely have to pound the chicken breast to about 1/4 inch to do either.  I sort of missed the "traditional" bread crumbs and the next time I may add some.

I have made this recipe many times and it is quite simple but fantastic. It is a very rich meal so I only make it on special occasions. A trick I use is to cut the chicken breasts lengthwise in half while they are still somewhat frozen. Very little pounding is necessary when I do this and if still frozen they cut easily.. Plus, I only need three breasts and it makes plenty for a family of 5.  I always coat the chicken in egg/milk mixture and roll them in seasoned bread crumbs as other reviewers suggest. I add paprika to the bread crumbs as well. When I'm browning the chicken, I make sure to get the ends real good because it somewhat sears the chicken edges and keeps the Swiss from escaping! After browning them, I bake them in the oven for about 20 minutes on 350, while I make the sauce separately. I use the same saucepan and keep the pan leavings right in and just add the wine and heavy cream and corn starch and let it cook while the chicken does. I do suggest doubling the sauce!

Delicious - used 3 large breasts cut in half and pounded.  Made full amount of sauce.  Made butter sauce and put in baking dish.  Put assembled chicken in baking dish and basted with butter sauce.  Cooked at 350 for 30 minutes basting a few times  Drained butter sauce off and mixed with cream mixture - yummo!

Delicious.  I made this for two people, but I made the sauce as though I was cooking for four based on other reviews on how wonderful it was.  I'm glad I did.  I also did wrap my ham around my cheese so it wouldn't ooze out and it really helped.  I used smoked paprika instead of regular, and it gave it a great taste.

This is excellent! Used thin chix cutlets/strips and pounded to make a little wider. added the cheese and ham and rolled up.  They were small which shortened the cooking time.  I dipped in egg wash and then rolled in Panko bread crumbs.  Browned for 8-10 minutes then put in a dish and baked for about 15 minutes or so. On the stove I whipped up 1/2 cup butter and 3/4 c milk (was out of cream~ but it worked fine) and then added the wine, chix broth and the corn starch (per recipe).  I let simmer on stove top for about 10 minutes. Whisk as needed and allow to thicken. I drizzled sauce on the chix rolls after they were placed on the plate.  ( I knew the kids wouldn't do the sauce).  It was a HIT!!  This would make a lovely plate to take to a party, get together, etc.  Was easy and DELICIOUS!!!

It was lovely, I would add a little lemon to the sauce to give it a bit of a pick me up in the flavor.  Otherwise very lovely, my 15 year old son made it for the first time tonight!

This is SO good but very rich and not healthy, but worth it in moderation.   It's easy to make and quick.  It goes really well with green beans or asparagus which is amazing smothered in the extra sauce :)   Thanks Behr :)

Made this tonight for dinner and, believe it or not, it was my very first time making it (I'm 45). It came out FABULOUS! Instead of making it with chicken breasts, I made it with thighs (my husband and I both prefer dark meat). It made it a bit challenging to roll the chicken up, especially for some of the smaller pieces (they looked like chicken tacos lol) but they were just as good as those that wrapped up nicely. My husband is a fantastic cook and, I'm proud to day, he LOVED this! Thank you for sharing it - we'll definitely be having this again!

I just made this recipe and used reduced fat swiss cheese, fat-free half and half and used 1/2c of chicken broth as I had no wine all in the interest of lightening up the recipe.  I'm sure it would have been outstanding with the original ingredients but I am very much overweight and need all the help I can get!  I have to say it turned out just divine!!!  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe!!

Very good recipe! The next time that I make it I will pound the chicken to make it thinner. That's the only change that I'll make though.

Just Okay.  The sauce was not very good I found that it was somewhat gritty from the bits remaining in the pan.

I have always liked Chicken Cordon Bleu, but after this recipe I LOVE IT. I have never had it better at a restaurant. I like to use chicken a bit more chicken bouillon to add more flavor but other wise this recipe is PERFECT .

I enjoyed this dish very much. I only made a couple minor changes. Instead of cream I used fat free milk with about 1.5 tbsp of flour mixed in for the sauce. When the sauce thickened I added 2 generous tbsp of sour cream to the sauce and turned off the heat and served it right after. My family was very pleased

4 stars. It was good but a LOT of prep work. I used tenderloins and cut my cheese and ham into thin strips to accomodate the tenderloins' size. I coated in flour, dipped in egg wash, and did final coat in bread crumbs. While it was good, I am not sure it was worth the effort and probably won't make it again.

This was VERY good, I used chicken broth instead of white wine as some others had mentioned and also added extra bouillon! It didn't take NEARLY as long as I thought it would. I thought I may have simmered the chicken too long but it was very moist and tasted perfecto!

I made this exactly how recipe said - it was delicious! I bought the thin sliced chicken breasts so I didn't have to pound them just like the video said. Also, remember to take out the tooth picks before your husband devours the whole thing! :)

So simple!  Who knew.  Did not have dry wine on hand so used 1/2 cup water with chicken bouillion.  Next time will try baking and bread crumbs.  But why mess with perfection.

I found this recipe very easy to make and my family and friends love it.  The trick is to get your chicken thin enough without tearing the meat about 1/4" that is by far the hardest part.  I only use wine I would drink to cook with, no exception.  Very wonderful and filling on a cool day.

I loved this recipe, so did my boyfriend, his dad, and younger brother. The only thing I changed was that I only browned the chicken in a frying pan, then I baked it for about 35-40 mins at about 350F. Oh and added some extra spices to the breading. (I'm a bit of a seasoning nut.) It was delicious!! It has definitely become a regular dish in this home. Thanks for sharing!

So delicious! I followed the recipe to a t. I used clarified butter though with a little bit if olive oil. I've had my many shares of burning butter while frying so I tried this trick instead. Will definitely make this again

This turned out really good, I liked the sauce. I used honey baked ham, dipped the rolled-up chicken in egg/bread crumbs, browned them in skillet then baked in oven @350 for like 30 minutes.  I followed advice and combined the sour cream/champagne(I didn't have wine on hand)/buillon/cornstarch in a saucepan, then poured it over the chicken after it was done.

Definitely recommend as others have said, pound to at least half-inch. I ran out of ham and made one with deli turkey breast instead... equally good! The sauce over the top adds lots of flavor. I didn't have any bouillon but used concentrated chicken stock.

This i so good.  I used  leftover ham from  Christmas and sliced it thin.  It must be the baked ham, not deli ham. I followed the recipe exactly but  I couldn't  roll them nice, even tho I did pound them, so I had to  just  fold a couple of them and  they did turn out a little dry.  Next time I wouldn't cook as long, in fact I would check them after ten minutes.  I will make them every time I have leftover baked ham and a good swiss cheese.  I used chardonnay wine. I think  any  white wine would work.  I also had two  pounds of chicken breast and it made four pieces.

Amazing flavor! It was a crowd pleaser. I only give it 4 stars because all of my cheese also leaked out. I used left over Christmas spiral cut ham and I think it was just too thick to properly wrap the chicken around. I did use kitchen twine 3 times around the rolls, it just wasn't enough based on the ham I used.

I made this for our Christmas dinner last night and it was fabulous!My husband, toddler and I enjoyed our meal which was really very special. In our opinion, it was as good or even better than what you would get at a restaurant. This recipe has been saved for future use. I encourage everyone to try this dish. Thanks Behr!

I prepared it following suggestions of other reviewers who baked the chicken and prepared the sauce separately. It came out really awesome, served with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. I would have given it 5 stars if not for the fact that every time I make the sauce, it curdles. Some times I manage to uncurdle it by adding more sherry, other times I have to discard it and start from the beginning.

I made this recipe the other night and should have doubled the recipe! I was so surprised when my husband said that this is one of his favorite dishes! He is very picky and to hear that come from him was a HUGE compliment! The kids all loved it, too!

I know I shouldn't be writing a review because I didn't follow everything on the recipe but I am anyways! This recipe turned out great and I only used what I had on hand. I used 1/2 chicken broth instead of white wine and bacon(precooked) instead of Ham. Delicious!

I adapted this recipe to work with our new wheat-free diet and used ground almond flour to coat the chicken instead of flour or breadcrumbs.  Still delicious!  It made a nice crunchy coating.

I made this recipe exactly as is and it was absolutely fantastic. I don't think a lot of recipes on this site deserve the 5 stars they have, so I give them out sparingly. This one however, deserves every star. Absolutely delicious. I don't know why anyone would change anything about it! I pounded the chicken breasts halves out flat and they rolled up nicely :) I also served with sliced, roasted potatoes and asparagus. Yummy. Can't wait to make it again!

I absolutely loved this recipe! But make sure you really pound the breasts though, also for the flour mixture i used flour, paprika, spicy pepper and garlic salt. this adds a lot of flavor to the dish!

Very yummy dish, even the leftovers heated up nicely.  I borrowed some suggestions and used an egg wash and garlic and herb breadcrumbs.  After I pounded the chicken out, I sprinkled them with salt, pepper and paprika.  The sauce is simple and very flavorful.  I used a Sauvignon Blanc like Cintron suggested and it worked very well.  I served it with wild rice and brussels sprouts.  One chicken breast would have been good to split; it seemed to make a lot of food.  I highly recommend this recipe, even for novices like myself.

I have made many Chicken Cordon Bleu recipes; this surpasses them all. It was delicious. The wine sauce really added what I think is often lacking in Cordon Bleu recipes. I will now stop trying new recipes!

This was good and had plenty of flavor. I wasn't sure about the sauce never had cordon blue with sauce but it made the dish I'm glad I choose this one over others on the site. Will be making again soon. Do make sure to pound out chicken to cover ham n cheese as much a possible so you don't loose you cheese. My husband had been asking me to make this and said it was a keeper.

This is a great recipe. My traditional cordon bleu recipe is done in the oven and I serve with a hollandaise. This is simple and the sauce is great. There is no fear of over cooking and drying out the chicken. A must try recipe!

This was delicious. Things I changed: used bread crumbs mixed with garlic powder, salt and pepper instead of flour, and finished in oven after browning the chicken. I used the left over butter in the pan as the foundation for the sauce and poured it over the chicken after it was finished. Yum!

Warning: Made some changes for our tastes, but kept the general integrity of the dish. After pounding out the chicken, I sprinkled onion and garlic powder, parsley, and a little cajun seasoning under the cheese and ham. Then rolled in italian seasoned breadcrumbs and baked them. 

I made the sauce all at once instead of simmering the chicken. Couldn't find boullion granules, so I used a little poultry seasoning in cooking wine and added the above seasonings and a little salt to the sauce, tasting it as I went. (I read on another dish to mix the cornstarch and some of the liquid separately first and get the rest of the sauce boiling, and then add the starch in. It thickened so much faster.) Hubby asked me to please make it again.

The taste was excellent. My chicken breasts were a bit to thick. Next time I will try to pound them out thinner, but the dish itself was delicious!

This was good. I used a little more ham and cheese and sliced at the end. Sauce was tasty but very thick, next time I might eliminate the cornstarch.

I thought it was okay, a little fattening for my tastes. I made it and followed the recipe just like it says on this website, but I should have edited the ingredients in a way I knew I would have enjoyed more. Maybe next time I will.

This recipe was honestly one of the most delicious dishes I have ever had.  We are going to make this for the whole family one night when they come stay with us for the holidays.  Cheap but 5-star taste!

Also, we were running low on heavy cream so we put in 1/3 cup sour cream and 2/3 heavy cream, I'm not sure if this made it taste better or worse then it would have had we followed the exact recipe.  All I can say is it was AMAZING.

I never tried Cordon Bleu before so I can't compare it to anything. But it turned out well. It cooked in 45 mins like the recipe said. And the sauce was flavorful.

family loved this. The rolling and keeping ham and cheese in was hard for me...I am not a chef. Do not know all the tricks yet, but, we are trying new things and "teaching" ourselves to cook via recipes here.

I actually rolled mine in bread crumbs...the heat caused it to hardened more than I would like, so, next time will do the flour.

Thanks

Very good! Will season the chicken with garlic salt and maybe some herbs just to add a little more flavor to the chicken. But it was very good on its own too!

Total YUM factor here! An excellent dinner and everyone inhaled it!  I did double the sauce to have enough to sop up with crispy french bread.  My mother and husband have begged me again and again to make this so this recipe will go in the official family favorites cookbook.  Can change up what you put on the inside from different cheeses to different salty smoky meats. Very versatile.

Made this tonight and it was incredible.  I used just normal chicken breasts and white cheddar cheese (it was all I had).  I followed the advice about breadcrumbs and finishing in the oven.  For the sauce, I had just some cooking wine and it came out fine.  Hubby LOVED it and commented how great it was.  I will definitely be making this again!

Fantastic!! Followed recipe as written with one variation - After browning the chicken, I transferred it to a baking dish and baked them at 350F for 20-30 minutes. Then I placed them back into the skillet to coat them with the yummy sauce!

Great meal. Served it with mash potatoes and steamed vegetables. I also added chives to the white wine sauce and sprinkled parsley on top.

Delicious, I did not add the wine but used chicken broth instead.  Simply delicious and my whole family enjoyed it.  We also do not like Swiss cheese and used mozzarella instead.  The sauce is so delicious--served it with buttery rice, broccoli, and crescent rolls. YUM!!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was excellent.  My husband and I loved it, and our 4 year old really liked it.  Even our 2 year old who doesn't eat much meat ate it.

I have made this recipe twice now; once as written & once with a few changes. As written, this recipe is good, not great. It was a bit bland for our taste and while it wasn't bad; my family preferred my other version of codon bleu. I decided to revisit this recipe one more time to see if we could bring it up to a 5, and I'm happy to say, it went above and beyond.  As suggested, I pounded the breast to about 1/4" thick.  I then used a 1/4 cup mixture of sorghum, buckwheat & brown rice flours with 1/4 cup corn meal and added some garlic powder (everything needs garlic) with a sprinkle of seasoning salt. I used 1/2 olive oil and unsalted butter, basically to keep the butter from burning. As others suggest, I browned the rolls in the sauce pan, then cooked them in the oven @ 350 for 20 min, then covered with sauce and baked them for another 5-10.  For the sauce, I was just shy of a 1/2 cup of white wine, so I used some sherry with a splash or so extra.  I had forgotten about the sauce becoming too think last time with 1 TBS cornstarch, next time, I will cut it 1/4 - 1/2.  I then added some dijon to the sauce, as it was still a bit bland; it was amazing. Unfortunately, I don't know how much I added, 1-2 tsp., maybe.  The combination of the sauce with the chicken was amazing..

Wonderful recipe.  Made it for company.  Received rave reviews.  I did coat with seasoned bread crumbs along with the flour/paprika.  I doubled the sauce per the suggestion of other reviewers.  I used only half of the one called for due to personal preference and used chicken stock for the rest.  I did use whole milk instead of heavy cream because it's what I had.  It didn't seem to affect the outcome.  I did add about 1 t. of Italian seasoning and 1/2 t of garlic powder to the sauce just to give it some more flavor.  Excellent!  Served it with garlic smashed potatoes and sauteed spinach.

Followed this recipe to the letter. It was an absolute hit.  Just be sure to cut the chicken into slightly larger cutlets and then pound them flat enough to enable you to stuff and roll them easily. Otherwise, don't change a thing.

This was so good, I mean really really good! I have never ate chicken cordon bleu let alone cooked it so I was a bit intimidated when I read over this recipe. This turned out fantastic and it looked just as fancy as it sounds and believe it or not it was not that hard to put together. I took the advice of other reviewers and baked it in the oven after browning the chicken on the stove. I used Hillshire farm ham and the grocery store brand swiss cheese and it STILL tasted pretty darn good. Next time I will try more quality ingredients.

My dad use to make this but bake the heck out of it in the oven with a thicker, crunchier crust. Then would make a Velveta sauce for it....it was my favorite Birthday dinner ever. Till I tried this one. Wow the sauce tastes like a rich cheese sauce. Cooking it in a skillet with just the flour and paprika in the butter....so tender juicy and tender and flavorful. I have the pickiest man ever and he loved it!!!!

This was ridiculously delicious! I impressed my father with it, and if you knew how amazing of a cook my mother is, you'd know how much that meant! I made a few small changes, instead of swiss cheese i used a mix of sharp cheddar and parmesan... and instead of the bouillon i used half a cube of mushroom stock powder.. will def make again!

I have made this recipe for years. It is my son's pick for his Birthday dinner every year since I started making it. It is a little work, mainly the putting together part, but worth it, and I would recommend using a good nonstick skillet for the frying part. works way better than any other type. Also I sometimes make more gravy which means doubling the wine, bouillion cubes, and heavy cream and cornstarch. Is delicious and will become a family favorite, and all on top of the stove.

Best Cordon Bleu recipe I have tried!  The only change was that I used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of whipping cream because thats what I had on hand.  I also triple the sauce so I have plenty to top the rice pilaf I serve it with.  YUM!

This recipe is a keeper. My whole family loves it. I do finish them off in the oven because they cool better. I rolled the flour, the beaten egg followed by Panko Bread Crumbs. Delicious.

This is delicious.  I've made it according to the recipe before, but have decided to make it an open faced dish instead.  It spreads the ingredients equally so there's a piece of ham, cheese and sauce in every bite. I used the recipe measurements as is listed just changed up the way it's put together.  All I did, was pound the chicken, salt and pepper it.  Then coat it in the flour/paprika mixture.  Fry till both sides are golden, remove and put in a single row in a baking dish.  Top each piece with ham and swiss then de-glaze the pan with the wine and chicken granules. Simmered it for about 5 minutes and then added in the flour and heavy cream mixture. Poured that over the chicken and baked in the 325 degree  oven for 15 minutes.  It was perfect.

I've been making this for years. I always forget how good it is. This last time I made it, I butterflied chicken breasts and stuffed them instead of rolling and I don't think I'll ever go back to rolling them up. For 2 chicken breasts, I cut the butter amount in half, but use the same measurements for the rest of the sauce because it's that good.

This was very good!  I followed it exactly but will try some healthier changes next time.  I'd like to try baking it and see how that goes b/c it was pretty greasy cooked it so much butter and wine. I also found the toothpicks hard to get out b/c the chicken was a little greasy, but my husband said baking it would ruin it.  I wanted to try it as is at least once. I put the cheese in the ham as suggested and none came out. Very good!  My hubby is a tough critic and he loved it!

It was delicious but I would hold off on making the gravy untill you are ready to serve. I made it and it sat for about 15min and turned lumpy....other than that it tasted great.

Very good! My chicken came out a little dry. I may have overcooked. But it was still delicious. Everyone enjoyed it and said it was the best Chicken Cordon Blue they had ever had. I may make a few adjustments to the recipe the next time around but I would definately make again!

I made this dish for my family and they loved it.  Even my husband, who is not a big fan of baked chicken, loved it.  The sauce is soooo good.  We poured it over almost everything on our plate.  I did not make any adjustments to the recipe.  It was just perfect.

Wow this is a great recipe!  It's the 2nd time I've made it. Reading the other reviews really helped.  I had to make this gluten free b/c of my brother's food allergies and it was still delicious!  I substituted with soy flour.  I used cooking string instead of tooth picks and used 1/2 olive oil, 1/2 butter for the frying.  Then I put it in a pan and baked it, as suggested by other reviewers.  It was perfect b/c I did that in the a.m. and then put in the oven when my guest (12 people) came.  I also made the sauce in a sauce pot, as suggested.  Came out fabulous!  Everyone thought it was the best!  Thanks to the other reviewers for their great ideas.

Very good!  I made exactly as written and was impressed at how moist the chicken was, and how rich and smooth the wine sauce turned out.  Will definitely make again.  I appreciate the previous reviews regarding wrapping the swiss cheese in the ham to keep from cooking out.  I found it easier to grate the cheese, then wrap, to make an easier bundle to roll up.  The wine sauce was great with the rice and asparagus I served to round out the meal.  THANKS!!!!!!

We used bread crumbs instead of flour. We browned the chicken with bread crumbs on each side in a skillet and then finished it off in the oven.

The family really enjoyed this.  I did prepare it a little different based on reviews and my family's preferences.  Once I rolled up the chicken, I dipped it in an egg wash and rolled it in breadcrumbs seasoned with paprika, black pepper, and garlic.  I baked the chicken at 350 for about 40 minutes and made the sauce in a saucepan and served it tableside.  I think next time I'll add some dijon mustard to the sauce to add another dimension.  It took almost 45 minutes to prep (clean/trim chicken, pound chicken, assemble the chicken/ham/swiss, egg wash, and bread).  That being said, the recipe is worth the effort.

LOVED LOVED LOVED this! Loved the wine sauce. Have made twice and have done as earlier person reco'd and did 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oile - fantastic. Also added basil on the 2nd - I'm a basil-holic. So good. Didn't add basil the 1st time, still so great. This is a saver for sure! YUM YUM YUM!

Best chicken cordon blue I have ever had, homemade, storebought, or restaurant style.  Rolled in breadcrumbs instead of flour (no egg wash) Followed other reviews and wrapped the cheese inside the ham first, this worked wonderfully for keeping the cheese in.  Simmered in the pan, just like the recipe says, this is how you get all the great juices for the sauce in the end!

WONDERFUL! Will be making it again. Followed other suggestions and breaded the chicken, baked at 350 for 30 min and wisked the sauce together and simmered for 10 min before putting over top of cooked chicken! Again, WONDERFUL!!!

I LOVE this recipe. I don't change a thing. It is awesome and worthy for a company dish. The chicken is wonderful, the gravy-to die for. I got frantic today when I couldn't find my printed out copy and couldn't remember what it was called. This is THE Cordon Bleu recipe that I always use. Thank you so much for sharing! PS-I try to use the largest breasts and pound them as thin as I can without tearing them up. Makes it a lot easier to roll.

All I can say is WOW!!! I just made this for me and my wife and we both found it amazing. Though I forgot to get cornstarch so I used 2 TBS of flour and it came out amazingly good... I also used a little more wine and heavy whipping cream than was called for. I will definately be making this again. And again WOW!!! (yes this reallly is that good)

This is an excellent recipe which I have made several times.  I do not change any ingredients, but have reduced the simmer time to about 12 minutes; it was a overcooked at 30 (the first time I made it).  The sauce is fabulous and everyone loves this chicken!

Tried this out and was surprised it tasted good. But i didnt follow the recipe per se but did my own revisions. First i dipped the chicken with ham and cheese inside in egg then breadcrumbs with paprika. Panfried it in butter for 5-10 minutes. while panfrying i made the sauce, mix cream, cornstarch, wine, and chicken granules (2tsps) cook in pan for a few minutes. the panfried chicken put in a casserole together with the butter from the pan and bake 350degrees for 30minutes. after 30 minutes pour in the creamy wine sauce and bake again for 20 minutes. put chopped basil leaves on top then serve.

This recipe was delicious!  Didn't find the sauce sour in the least.  However, I'm not a fan of bouillon granules or bouillon period.  Replaced with chicken stock.  Company worthy meal for sure.  Everyone loved it.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

Truly a 5 star recipe... I marinate my chicken in a salt water brine for 1 hour before cooking to increase flavor and moistness.  In addition, I usually only make 2 chicken breast halves; but still make the same about of sauce.  The sauce is so good and great served over rice.  For those not aware: dry wine is not sweet.  Choose a good chardonnay... that's what I always use. Yum!

This was absolutely fabulous!  I wouldn't change a thing.  My husband said it was the best he'd ever had.  I served it with twice-baked potatoes and asparagus.  This was the least-messy version I've ever made.  It was simple, but when tasting the end result, it doesn't seem that way.  Fantastic!

Great recipe. I made this per the recipe but grilled the chicken. I grilled on low about 15-20 minutes then turned up the grilled and crisped both sides. Made the sauce separate. Got lots of groans. It was a big hit.

After making it with and without the wine, I can say that that the wine makes a difference!  Even if it's just the cheap stuff.  Yes, you can substitute chicken broth, but the flavor is simply not as good, even with homemade boiled down broth.  To make up for it I tossed in a piece of ham for flavor, some better-than-bouillon beef flavor and  a little cream cheese (basically whatever I had on hand).  We don't drink, but I normally keep a little cooking wine on hand and by the time you've boiled it for 30min the alcohol will be completely gone leaving a delicious flavor behind. Yum!

WOW!!!!This was FANTASTIC! The only thing I'll do different next time is use smoked provolone instead of Swiss. (Just because no one in my family like swiss cheese)

This recipe is AWESOME!  Will definately make again, however will try to resist the urge to make it often because of the fat content.  The only changes I made were to use Tastefully Simple Seasoning Salt instead of paprika, I added mushrooms and I only made 4 breasts but kept the proportions of everything else the same - delicious!!

I liked this recipe, although I was wishing it was a bit more flavourful. I even brushed it with Dijon mustard & added fresh basil & a bit of salt & black pepper to the sauce.  Next time I think I will add onion & garlic powder, maybe cayenne....?

I followed the recipie exactly and it was FABULOUS! Even the kids loved it. Don't skimp on the sauce or substitute for the white wine, if you can make double. Served with artichokes and rolls, great meal.

I made this last night and everyone really liked it. I liked it as well but I could really taste the wine in my sauce so maybe I used the wrong kind? I will try to brown them on the stove next time and then bake them and make the sauce separately and maybe use chicken broth instead of the wine.

This was amazing, and tasted even better the next day! I used kitchen twine instead of toothpicks, they were easy to cut off and held the chicken together nicely! Making the chicken 1/2 inch in thickness is a must, and make sure all of your rolled up chicken pieces are about the same size, so the insides cook at the same rate, will definitely double the sauce next time, and will add non-fat milk instead of more heavy cream as it was too rich for my taste buds.

Although this hardly needs another 5++++ review I thought I would add my 2 cents. I had to try a recipe that had this many reviews and had a 5 star rating, and it was amazing! I was worried that the cheese would totally ooze out of my chicken rolls, but it didn't. The only thing that I did differenty was to add a bit of extra swiss cheese and chopped up ham in the sauce at the end, since I had already cut them up. I was awsome.

WOW!! i'd never made chicken cord on blue in years so thought i'd try it out for a change. I was almost positive I did not like swiss cheese. This recipe has definitely changed that. Superb!

OMG this was phenomenal! I made it exactly as the recipe stated except I used 3 tbsp. butter & then enough olive oil to coat the pan. I also used half & half instead of the heavy whipping cream because I accidentally bought that instead, it was still amazing! This is one of the few dishes I've made that look & taste like restaurant quality! I've never had chicken cordon bleu before & let me tell you it was awesome!! I am really looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch today! It was so easy too, guests would think you spent hours slaving in the kitchen!! I made this for my husband & I's anniversary & managed to whip this up with a side of rice while still having time to care for my 3 week old son! He thought I slaved all day making it!!! Absolutely delish! Thanks for the wonderful recipe :)

I thought the chicken was outstanding. I used string to hold the chicken together, but i will have to say it was a little bit of a challenge finding the string again (to cut) before serving. But I don't think I did the sauce right.  I removed the chicken after 30 minutes of cooking in wine, butter, etc. but then I heated the cream and cornstarch in a cleaned pan, then heated it until it was thick. It did not seem right but I thought I was following directions. Apparently, you need to add the corn starch and cream mixture to the existing oils, butter, etc. I just didn't do it initially b/c I thought the pan scrapings, chicken fat, etc. was too dark. Oh well, next time I know...

I used thin sliced checken breasts and they were not completely sealed with toothpicks.  After browning, I only cooked for about 15 minutes covered and they were incredible!  The sauce is sooooo good - restaurant quality!

I made this exactly as written and it came out delicious! Next time I will not pound the chicken quite so thin, will brown it a little longer to get a crisp crust, and may try it in the oven.  Fantastic as is, though.

Loved, Loved, Loved this! Just make double the sauce so you can have extra. I also dipped the chicken in egg and seasoned bread crumbs before I cooked it in the skillet.

Requires work but well worth the effort.  I dipped the breasts in egg and then flour as another viewer suggested.  Used half butter and the rest EVOO.  Fantastic

Wow! This was truly amazing! I made this tonight for myself & my husband (we hadn't had chicken cordon bleu in years) & my husband rated it 4.75 (he doesn't give anything a 5!)... I on the other hand gave it a 5+ :) I used Naked Grape Sauvignon Blanc which was great. The only thing I did differently with the recipe was make a smaller portion and topped it with fresh basil. It was excellent with grilled asapargus and caesar salad. Thanks for this wonderful recipe - can't wait to make it again!

There were a few things I found odd about this recipe...and will do differently next time.  First, I'd brown the chicken in the skillet, then bake it in the oven. Leaving it in the skillet for another 30 minutes just did not work for me. The chicken was nearly burnt to a crisp on several sides (granted, my burners run a bit hotter than normal and I forgot that).   Also, why hold the chicken together with toothpicks? The picture seems to show that it was rolled...that makes much more sense than toothpicks.   The flour & paprika was nice, however. Just needs a few changes and I'd give it 5 stars.

I disagreed with almost everyone. I thought that this was just ok.  The sauce was very plain and it needed something. Also I couldnt taste the ham and cheese because of all the sauce so it didnt taste like chicken cordon bleu to me. :(

I absolutely loved this recipe!! It has been a VERY long time since I have enjoyed my own cooking...but when I made this...I was the one ranting and raving!!!  Instead of wine, I used chicken broth.I didn't add the chicken granules. I doubled the sauce. With this I made stuffed baked potatoes...bake the potaotes..6 of them. Then I scooped out the potato from the skin. I put in my KA mixer and added 1 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup butter, 2 cups tex-mex cheese, 1/4 cup real bacon bits, and chopped up some green onions. Scoop back into the skins, bake for 20 minutes at 400 and the turn up oven to broil and broil till nice brown and crispy. Awesome with the sauce on top!! Thanks for the great recipe!!!!

This was a hands-down winner among guests and family. The sauce is simply mouth watering and brings this classic to a whole new level. In fact, I now make extra sauce to use with a separate pasta dish - it's THAT good!!

Just as easy as the recipe claims.  I forgot to get white wine, so I substituted rice wine vinegar and it worked with no trouble.  Also strained the sauce which was good and added paprika to it which was not as good-turned the sauce sort of brown.  But this one is a keeper!

Well, I just blew my diet on this one, but it was worth it (and it's worth every star)!  Served it with brown whole grain rice and green beans.  Not your everyday meal, but I think this will be the recipe I use for cordon bleu going forward.

Spectacular. Not only is this recipe delicious, it's fun to make and smells amazing while you cook it.   I've had to split the breasts up into two different pans due to lack of space. I did put more than half of the other ingredients (butter, wine, granules, etc.) in each pan. This allowed for equal cooking, more white sauce, and more creativity. Bottomline: the quantities in this recipe are very flexible.  I tried to make one of these with Pepper Jack cheese....not recommended. All of the cheese melted out of the chicken and ended up in the sauce. Good for the sauce, not for the chicken. The sauce is also really good the next morning on breakfast ham. Enjoy!

Followed multiple reviews & browned 10 min. & then 20 min. in oven @ 350.  Other than that, didn't change a thing & it was delicious!!  Excellent again next night when reheated.  Well worth the effort.

This is a great recipe, easier than I anticipated.  I did add Pankow to the flour mix.  I seared on the stove, then transferred to the oven at 250 for 35-40 minutes, I didn't  want to be cooking when company arrived.  Poured about half of the sauce on top of chicken while it was in the oven, reserved the rest and served as  gravy.  I did add two more Tbs. butter and a little more wine than then the recipe called for so I was sure to have extra.  Will make this again!

delicious recipe! I only used 3 pieces of chicken, but kept the same amount of sauce. I put 2 pieces of cheese in each breast w 1 slice of ham. I also used 2 boullion cubes. Not the healthiest of recipes, but def yummy!!

This meal was awesome. I did listen to some other reviewers. I combined flour and bread crumbs, even using some panko to mix in. I put 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil. I did put the chicken in a 350 degree oven for 10 minutes but then put it in the wine/boullion mixture over stove. I cooked it for 10 more minutes then made sauce. I tripled recipe as suggested, good idea. So good. Made it with steamed asparagus and brown rice. My husband lvoed it and he doesn't even like any sauces! YUMMY!

This recipe is absolutely fantastic, as written. The only change that I made was to roll the chicken in egg wash before the flour/paprika mix. I made mashed potatoes with it and just poured the gravy over the chicken and potatoes.... Mmmmm. My fiance actually said this is the best dinner I have ever cooked, and I cook for him almost every night. We are (seriously) making it again right now- and the first time I made it was for dinner last night!

This is the first recipe that I've spent the time to write a review for, but this one was worth it.  Because of both the ease and of course the ultimate end product, this was a winner.  I personally like a bit more flavor, so instead of regular ham I did use Prosciutto and I did add extra cheese, but that's a personal preference.  I do recommend pounding out the chicken breasts as another reviewer recommended, not only does it shorten cooking times somewhat, but it will make them consistent.  Enjoy this recipe, I know that my family and I did and that includes two picky youngsters (5 and 6).

I needed to use up some left over Christmas ham and this was an excellent option. I didnt have swiss cheese, so substituted cheddar. I pan fried it in an oven safe pan, added the wine/stock mixture, then as my biscuits baked at 350*F for 20 minutes, I finished cooking the chicken as well. They were pounded out fairly thin, so that amount of time worked well. I just finished off the cream sauce on the stove. Family loved it- very rich, but a great overall recipe!

Really fantastic. I made a few slight changes. I only used 3 chicken breasts. Used 2 ham slices each for them. And used 3 tbs of margarine instead of butter.  That's it and it came out delicious.   I think the sauce is the true star of this recipe though. Creamy with all of the flavors of the chicken, ham, cheese and wine.

This is really good.  We have tried cooking it both ways- in the oven and by the recipe and it pretty much comes out the same.  I think it's really important to get a good quality swiss cheese, not just the pre-sliced store brand kind.  Will definately have it again

So rich and delicious!  One of the best recipes I have tried.  The cheese melted out and it was somewhat tricky to make but the sauce alone is so worth it!!! Can't wait to make it again!  I think this one takes practice and I hope to master it because it would be very impressive to serve at a dinner party.

Instead of a white wine sauce I use a swiss cheese sauce. I also use a perry knife to put a pocket in the chicken and insert the swiss and ham slices.

I also cooked this in breadcrumbs instead of flour.  The chicken turned out perfect.  We used leftover slices of a spiral ham plenty of swiss.  The sauce was really good.  Ours looked much more appetizing than the picture provided for this recipe.  We'll be making this again soon.

This was really amazing and so easy! I followed the suggestions of others and coated chicken in breadcrumbs not flour, I also doubled the sauce.  I had some leftover swiss so I added some on top of each chicken about 1 min before I was done cooking. The wine sauce was phenomenal! Will definitley make this again!

Scrumptious! Perfect the way it is! Although, I have to agree with other reviews that the toothpicks do get lost. I have made this several times but will try securing with string rather than toothpicks next time.

Made this for dinner last night, and it is, quite simply, devine! Made as directed, except doubled the sauce recipe and baked chicken in the oven for 20 minutes 350 rather than simmering in the pan.  Thanks!!!

Oh my god, this was sooo good, I am so happy that I can finally make a meal that would be worthy of the fanciest of restaurants :) Making this dish was kind of a spur of the moment thing, so I had to substitute some of the ingredients, but it turned out so great that I think I will make it with these alterations the next time too, and BELIEVE ME, there will be a next time! I didn't have any heavy cream, or even milk, so I used sour cream and a little water, worked great! Used strips of bacon instead of ham, I wrapped it around the cheese, I think this helped prevent the cheese from escaping from my chicken during cooking :) I also added garlic powder, onion powder and some salt and pepper to the flour mixture, and I used 3Ts butter and 3Ts olive oil as a lot of other people suggested. Didn't use tooth picks or string or anything, but my chicken held together just fine. And finally, if you make this dish, be sure to double the amount of sauce, it's out of this world!

EXcellent recipe. Very easy to make. I am currently living in germany and whenever we go out to eat I always order Chicken Cordon Bleu, I'm so grateful that I can cook it exactly like my favorite resturant. Thank you so much for your recipe.

This was awesome salsa.  We aren't big fans of cilanto so we cut WAY back on it but it was great. I have made it for a few functions and everyone always asks for the recipe.

Oh my goodness! To say this is excellent is an understatement! I doubled the sauce as others had suggested and I'm glad I did! I actually made this for a serving of 12! RAVE REVIEWS!! From my in-laws to my kids of 17, 14, 3 and even my 1 year old! For the sauce...I'm going to try it with some pasta and shrimp tomorrow! The sauce is the best I've ever tasted! Try this recipe! It is sure not to disappoint!

Dipped in egg and then bread crumbs.  Fried w/ 6 T butter for 10 mins.  Then baked at 350F for 25 mins.  Simmered liquid mixture for 10 mins on stovetop.  Then spooned on top before serving.  Very Tasty!!!  If you enjoy chicken, swiss, and white wine then you'll enjoy this.

Delicious.  It has a different taste because of the wine, but it is a great taste.  I served it over rice so the rice could soak up the sauce.  It was even great as leftovers.

I made this for dinner last night and it was a big hit with the whole family.  In my book, anytime both kids love something it rates 5 stars. I did change the cheese.  I found sliced asiago at the market and thought that would add a richer/deeper flavor. Another big bonus...it only takes one pan. My 15y/o asked for the leftovers in his lunch today!

This was very tasty and moist.  The cream sauce was superb!  I followed a lot of the suggestions and it was a hit.  I was concerned it would not have enough flavor since the only seasoning is Paprika so I lightly seasoned the inside of the chicken breasts with season salt.  I also used bread crumbs as suggested and I lightly seasoned the crumbs with season salt, onion powder, and paprika.  I browned them in a skillet for 10 minutes then finished up in the oven for 20 mins on 350 degrees.  I prepared the wine sauce separately. I will definitely prepare this again!

Wonderful dish, very flavorable, chicken was moist, and the ham seem to soak up the wine flavor. Awesome recipe and definitly a keeper. When adding the butter to pan we also added a tbl. of olive oil and about two coves of garlic minced.

The chicken came out great.  I browned it and finished it off in the oven.  I made the sauce separately and I don't know what I did wrong but it tasted great but only held it's form for a few minutes.  Then the oil separated and it wasn't edible.  I tried making the sauce twice with the same results.  Such a bummer because the sauce tasted great.

this was really yummy. i gave it a 4 only because i changed it some. some things i did differently, cooked chicken breasts with bone and skin in crock pot until done(skipped the flouring and browning step).  remove the bone and skin, wrap the large pieces of chicken(or several small pieces) with swiss, then ham.  melt the butter in the skillet, add a bullion cube and i used the broth from the crockpot instead of wine, simmer for a minute, then add the cornstarch/cream and whisk until it thickens.  i poured some sauce in a baking dish to cover the bottom, put the chicken/ham pieces in, then poured the rest of the sauce over the top.  sprinkled a little parmesean on top, baked at 350 (covered)for 10 minutes until bubbling. and voila! was super delicious! picky boyfriend even loved it!

This was incredible. I used 8T of butter and white zin wine. I adds the cream to the broth/wine about 5 minutes before it was done cooking and found that I didn't need the cornstarch. This was just divine. I would recommend doubling the sauce, it was so yummy, not a bad thing to have extra. Thanks for sharing!!!

Has anyone reduced this recipe to 2 servings?  I did, but it doesn't look like there will be enough sauce.  In the reviews it has been reduced to 3 servings and one changed the ingredients in the sauce and the other didn't reduce the sauce and had a lot left over. I haven't made it yet, but guess I will adjust the amount as I cook, if it doesn't look like enough.

My boyfriend said this was the best dish I had ever made!  The only change I made was breading the chicken cordon bleu with egg, flour, and bread crumbs and I used proscioutto instead since I love it so much.  The sauce was delicious and I can see myself using it on dinner crepes or something in the future.  GREAT RECIPE! and very delicious!!

One of the best on allrecipes.com.  What I did was copied pasted this recipe in a Word document then copied and pasted the three most helpful reviews on the bottom (shrunk the font a little so it ends up on one page).  Then I took a highlighter and highlighted the best suggestions, or what I thought was good advice.  The highlighting helps because my eyes only focus on the good stuff so I'm not reading all the other stuff that I'm not doing.  Much better than rewriting then not being about to read my handwriting.  Also put this in a clear plastic sheet protector because I'm a really messy cook!  I obviously make this a lot!  Enjoy!

By far, my favorite chicken dish to serve for dinner guests.  I use red cooking wine for a richer flavor and I've had rave reviews.

A very good cordon bleu. It was fairly easy to make, the instructions were easy to understand and complete the first time through the recipe.  I think it is important to use a good quality ham though, and maybe something low sodium.  I thought it came out a bit salty from the granules and the ham combination

Quick easy recipe. Much easier than the one I usually bake in the oven. Liked the wine sauce but would even like more of a wine flavour. Any suggestions out there?

This was a very good recipe but I made a few adjustments. I used bread crumbs instead of flour and cooked it in the oven for 30 minutes at 350 F after browning the chicken.

This recipe was amazing!  I subbed EVOO for the butter because that's what I had, and it was fine.  I also used parmesan cheese as a coating instead of the flour, and this just gave it an extra special kick.  The sauce is out of this world.  This is my hubby's favorite dish that I make.  Thanks!

Wow!  So good!    Funny story.  My daughter (20) wasn't going to eat because she didn't look how the chicken looked while I was preparing it.  But when it was done, I whipped out the mother guilt (my prerogative, right?) and said the least she could do was try it after I went to the trouble of making it.  She did not want to try it, but I sorta begged, until she finally said, "FINE!!!"  She took a bite off the fork my husband held out to her and then started stomping off to her room.  After she got about halfway there, she stopped, turned around, and said, "Okay, I'll have some of your chicken."  True!  :-)

This was one of those meals that make me wonder why anyone would ever go to a restaraunt!  I was worried that the cheese would melt too much and drain out of the chicken, but it still turned out great!  Definately a keeper!

Wow! The bomb! I did cook it partly in the oven as some suggested and it was still great, helped reduce the handling and losing some of the coating on the chicken. Will definitely look for large chicken breat halves next time to help with the roll up,

Made this last night and it was awesome!  I used the thin-sliced chicken breast (and avoided the extra time of pounding out the meat), used an egg wash before coating with Italian bread crumbs, and I also used prosciutto...so delish.  The ONLY reason for the 4 stars is my sauce, while absolutely amazing, didn't look as pretty for presentation sakes.  I think its because i used flour to thicken, and replaced some of the butter with olive oil.  But wonderful- thank you!

My 11 year old daughter loves to cook and she prepared this dish for our family tonight.  Awesome!  It turned out tender, juicy and absolutely delicious!  She served with rice and a small salad and the entire meal was delicious.  I only wish we had leftovers because I would go back for more right now!

Delicious!  I basically have no cooking skills at all but I was able to do this recipe and impress my husband! :-) I bought regular whipping cream instead of heavy whipping cream and it turned out just fine.

This wine sauce is what made this standard cordon bleu dish amazing!! Followed the recipe but had to finish cooking in oven. It was hard browning all sides with all the toothpicks i had holding it together :-p Definitely will be making this one again.

SO GOOD! I scaled it down to 2 servings. Due to some of the reviews of the chicken itself being a bit bland, I marinated it for about 4 hrs in apx. 1Tb Goulden's Spicy Brown Mustard, 1Tb Apricot preserves, 1/2c half and half, 1ts corriander, mixed well, coated pounded chicken. Rolled a Havarti slice in a Black Forest Ham, proceeded with recipe as written. Since they were quite big, I just served it with a green salad and crusty baguette. I actually got up from the table and returned with the pan so we could sop up the sauce with our bread! This one's gonna be a regular around here for sure.

These were simple to make-I did bread the chicken. I took the suggestion of another reviewer & rolled the bundles on a plate of bread crumbs/paprika mix. I used 2 toothpicks each & had no problems w/them pulling out or getting in the way while frying. I wasn't impressed too much w/the flavor of everything put together but my 3 guests couldn't get enough!!

Only one word can do this justice - WOW!!!  I had read so many amazing reviews of this dish, I really wanted to try it.  Thought Mother's Day was a perfect occasion - bought all very nice ingredients at Whole Foods and took them to my mom's for Mother's Day.  Followed the recipe to a T.  It was amazing!  I may want to do this as a week night meal, but would either layer the ingredients instead of rolling (as that was the most tedious part of the meal) or just slice up my chicken before cooking it and serve it with the amazing sauce.  It would be simple, but still yummy!

This recipe is great.  I added Grey Poupon Mild and Creamy Dijon Mustard in between the chicken and the cheese, which complimented the dish well.  I also added some freshly chopped basil to the sauce immediately before spreading it on the chicken, and topped off the dish with extra basil.

I held off rating this as I tried it per the original recipe - thought it somewhat tasty, but somewhat bland.  Tried it a second time without wrapping the chicken and without using the ham.  Rather I fried the coated chicken, and layered with swiss cheese to melt at the end.  Also added sauteed mushrooms and onions.  Really quick and tasty meal.

My husband raved about this recipe and told me to throw out our old cordon bleu recipe. He liked it originally without the cream sauce on top and I told him he forgot about the sauce and he was afraid to add it for fear it would ruin the flavor. He did make the cream sauce after all and loved it. He said the best part was having a 1/2 bottle of wine leftover after making it! :) My husband actually made the recipe for me and said it is very easy to make too. Even better!

I also included some corn starch in with the flour to dust the chicken. Gives a great finished coat look.  Also, because we were serving 8, we baked them in the oven for 25min after quickly frying the outsides.

Really delish...after reading reviews complaining about leaking swiss cheese, I decided to prepare a bit differently.  After dredging pounded chicken in flour/paprika/garlic salt/pepper mixture, I pan "fried" both sides in butter and then placed chicken covered with ham slice and swiss cheese in baking dish for about 20 minutes.  During this cooking time, I prepared sauce as described and then poured over chicken once served on plates.  Really yummy!

We LOVED this recipe! I made this for my Mum's birthday and it was perfect. Thank you for the recipe. I did make a few changes, though (it never fails XP). I did use breadcrumbs in place of the flour. I browned the chicken in the pan and then baked it for about 40 mins (I used whole breasts instead of halves) at 350. For the sauce I used chicken stock instead of white wine and I also added some dijon mustard and it turned out great! Thank you for the wonderful recipe, we will definitely be making this again!

My family loved this recipe.  My son usually just moves things around on his plate to make it look like he's eaten some.  But this time his plate was clean "magic".

Excellent recipe!  However, to make it healthier and even better, substitute evaporated skim milk (same quantity) for the cream.  I know in some recipes cream makes the recipe, but for this one the wine sauce interacts with the evaporated skim milk perfectly.  Try this substitution - you will be amazed at how good it is!

This recipe is THE best one I have found. I only substitute the flour with corn starch. It makes it much smoother. I make extra sauce to pour over baked potatoes after the chicken is gone. My husband BEGS me to make this all the time!!!

The sauce is to die for. I had to sub a few items. I used prosciutto and cheddar (it's what I had) and had to use light cream but kept the rest of the recipe as is. WOW. Delish!!! The only thing I might change the next time is use 2 tbsp of butter and maybe 1-2 tbsp of olive oil. Just to cut the fat a little.

It's very difficult to assemble, what with the toothpicks and the cheese spilling out everywhere. Otherwise, it's delicious! Love the sauce too

it tasted good, but all the cheese oozed out.  the chicken must be pounded really thin in order to roll it up.  i like lots of cheese so i had to melt some on the top after.  too much work for me to do for this dish.

I've made this multiple times and it's 5 star worthy as-is. I change it up sometimes by using a sharp white cheddar instead of swiss and prosciutto instead of ham. I've also added a bit of dijon mustard to the sauce on occasion. Thanks for the great recipe! Yummmmy!

Delicious!!! Everyone loved this meal. I added about 1/4 Cup parmesan cheese, 2 pinches of salt and pepper to taste. I also fried the chicken for 10 minutes in the pan then baked for 20 minutes in the oven at 350.

This was soooo good!!!!! I spread dijon mustard on the chicken before the ham.  I also rolled the swiss cheese inside 2 slices of ham and the cheese did not ooze out when cooking. I fried in a pan on all sides and then popped in the over for 30 min at 350.  While chicken was in the oven I doubled the sauce and the poured on top of chicken and covered for another 10 minutes.  I made a loaf of French bread in the bread machine and it was perfect for dipping into the wonderful sauce.  It was a friends 50th Birthday dinner and this was a perfect meal to serve, everyone loved it!!  THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!!!!!

It was okay, I think this recipe would be better if the chicken was cooked in the oven, not boiled in the pan.  I will try this recipe again, but with a few changes.

This was awesome. I decided not to flour the chicken. I Just browned it up in some butter before cooking it through in the wine sauce. I used regular cooking wine and it still came out really good.

Mine was a little salty but I might have overdid it on the paprika and wine? I'd definitely make again using a better cut of meat, ham and nicer Swiss.

I made this recipe last night for a group of my friends and two people asked f they could marry me!!! This was outstanding. The most difficult part for me was thinning out the chicken and rolling it up but the rest was a breeze. I actually put a piece of swiss cheese on top of each breast at the end just in case any oozed out while cooking. The sauce that you make at the end was fantastic too! I highly recommend this to everyone. I personally wouldnt change a thing!

I really liked this recipe.  Made it for a dinner party and was pretty easy to make.  I did bake it after I added the cream sauce for about 20 minuted at 350.  Instead of toothpicks, I tied it up.  Future use of this recipe for me will include more swiss cheese, more ham, and more leftovers.

This is a great recipe!  My husband wanted to know what I bought & how much I spent since I only ever make ‘fancy’ dinners when I come home from spending too much shopping.  He loved it & did not believe me when I said it was nothing ‘fancy’ to make.  I have a problem following directions & tend to cook by personal taste & this a great recipe for that, you do not have to go by exact measurements.  It is also nice because it is a one-pot-meal, less is cleaning always nice.  Defiantly check out the other comments for helpful tips.  The best ideas are to cook in the oven @ 350 for 20 min after browning on the stove top & to add a slice of cheese to the sauce.  Cooking in the oven frees up the stove to make your sides.  I also doubled the sauce after I removed the chicken & used it all.  The tooth picks were tricky & I couldn’t really ‘seal’ the chicken around the filling so I just folded it in half & placed the cheese on both sides of the ham inside (that way the cheese sticks to the chicken instead of sliding off the ham).  I used thick-cut deli meat & cheese slices and half&half instead of cream.  This will defiantly become a dinner staple & not just when I feel guilty for that pair of shoes I just had to have ;)

I followed the recipe as written and it was perfect! I didn't think I could make something as fancy as this and have it turn out right the first time. I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe.

This was a big hit at our house!  I browned my chicken in half butter/half olive oil to help keep the butter from burning, as well as for the health benefits.  I don't really care for the taste of wine so I just substituted chicken broth instead.  I also did not have any heavy cream at the time, so I just substituted milk.  This helped make it a bit healthier as well.  I will definitely make this again.  It was an instant favorite with our five kids!

I served this to company including four children and everyone loved it. I cut the butter with olive oil and finished cooking in the oven.  Great dish!!

AMAZING! I usually make this like the recipe with boneless chicken breast but the only fresh chicken breast they had in Whitehorse at the time was bone-in. So I rolled up the chesse in the ham and then used a toothpick and stuck it to the top of the meat. It turned out awesome, very moist and no cheese leaked out. When I make it again, i will use the same chicken breast, we loved it that way and it saves a lot of time too. I had extra cheese so I melted it in the sauce. Delicious!!! Thanks so much for this recipe

I loved the recipe, but did not like the wine in the sauce.  I'm not wine drinker, so I'm sure it's my choice in wines (I had to rely on the advice of another shopper as to which to choose for cooking.)  I will definately make the recipe again, but will leave the wine out of the sauce as a few other raters suggested.

Most delicious Chicken Cordon Bleu I have ever had!  I would definitely double the sauce because that is the best part.

I was disappointed in this dish, esp. with all the rave reviews.  I felt like it needed more salt.  I didn't have a chicken boullion cube so i used a 1/4 c chk broth and then reduced the wine to 1/4c.  It just seemed a little bland.  I used a chardonnay for the wine.  Not sure i will make again.

I had never had Cordon Bleu or made it before tonight.  It was terrific!!!  I do have a few suggestions... I find that toothpicks are a bit tricky, so I use these great cooking rubber bands!  (They withstand temperatures up to 600F and can be used with virtually any cooking technique.)  They are so easy to use and make rolling the chicken fast and easy.  I used two rubber bands per breast (they come in a pack of 24).  The bands keep the chicken in a perfect roll and even make it easy to slice afterwards! I used Carlo Rossi Chablis for my white wine.  It is great for cooking and BevMo has it at a great price!   Lastly, I cranked up the heat at the end to thicken the sauce.  It thickened perfectly! This was a terrific recipe!  Thanks for sharing :-)!

Fixed as written, and it was really very good.  I think I'll use smoked ham and maybe increase the amount of cheese next time.  I need to practice with the toothpicks, but so easy otherwise.

Very good; I didn't bother pounding them. Just layed the cheese and ham on top, folded in half long ways and secured with toothpicks.

This is very good! Awesome recipe. But very time consuming in my book. The pounding, the rolling, the browning of the chicken its a big mess to me. I have made this twice and not sure if i will make it again. Its good but not sure if its worth all the rrouble.

I am sure this recipe is good as is but since i follow a severely restricted low carbohydrate diet i change a few things. The result was delicious. Replace the flour with about 3/4 cup of crushed pork rinds, yes pork rinds. Try it. they make a remarkable breading and have practically no carb content. I dipped the prepared chicken lightly in cream before rolling them in the crushed pork rinds. I also omitted the corn starch and found the sauce quite thick enough without it.  I garnished the completed dish with a little torn basis.  My guests loved it and commented on how beautifully browned the breading was. A Keeper

the chicken is great, but the wine sauce is to die for. I am embarrassed to admit that we actually licked the pan before washing it! I tied the chicken instead of using the toothpicks. The entire dish was a dream. I served it over long grain rice and some asparagus. Not something I could make every week, but this dish was worth every single calorie!

I was a little disappointed after so many rave reviews.  I followed the recipe without any modifcations and I found it rather bland.  I will definetly try it again, adding seasoning and maybe fresh basil as suggested in another review.  The consistancy of the wine sauce is perfect and it looked just beautiful, thanks for the recipe.

I thought this recipe was great but my fiance didn't like it at all! Actually he liked the chicken but didn't care for the sauce.  Oh well.

The chicken was great but the sauce left something to be desired. I would continue to cook the chicken the same way but I will look for a new sauce recipe.

This made for a wonderful meal accompanied with steamed vegetables. I followed the recipe exactly and wowed the dinner crowd. It's true that this recipe is very rich with all the butter and heavy cream, but it's soooo good.

Breaded with Panko breadcrumbs instead of flour, used olive oil instead of butter, and fat-free plain yogurt instead of cream (thickened with corn starch).  It was delicious, and my family has already requested it again.

I also rolled the chicken TIGHTLY (like prosciutto in an antipasto) instead of folding.

Quick, easy, and delicious!

I followed the directions almost exactly and it turned out great. I had to add about twice the amount of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. My whole family liked it.

I made this recipe last night for dinner. The first time was about six months ago. THis is AMAZING. Followed the recipe exactly, and like other reviews, I heard from my husband that the dinner (esP) the sauce was something you would find in a great restaurant! I am lucky, I stay home today so I get to claim the leftovers for lunch. thank you for sharing!

This sauce in this recipe is even better with a little Dijon mustard added.  I also used some tarragon and quite liked it.

This was simply to die for! Wonderful. We didn't even use the wine instead we used the chicken broth and it was still fantastic. We will definitely try the wine next time!! Great dish- thank you!

I have to admit, I didn't actually MAKE this recipe yet!
I had it for dinner at a friends house last night and LOVED IT!
It was absolutely delicious.  And I can't wait to copy her and serve it for dinner guests myself!

The main thing I did differently with this recipe was change the heavy cream to half and half.  Loved it, especially the gravy.

All I can say is WOW. This is delicious! The sauce really makes it. I followed the directions to a T but next time I think I'll use bread crumbs instead of the flour to crisp it up a bit.

Very tasty, but tricky for rookies like me!  It's really tough to roll ham and cheese into a neat little chicken bundle-I used plenty of toothpicks, and that made it hard to brown them on all sides.  I took a few of the reviewer suggestions: I used light cream instead of heavy cream, gravy flour instead of cornstarch, and a mixture of olive oil and butter rather than just plain butter.  I also cooked the chicken with the bouillon and wine in an oven at 350 instead of in the pan.  I brushed the chicken with a mixture of melted butter and dijon mustard before I put the ham and cheese on and rolled them.  After the chicken was done, I strained the melted cheese out of the wine/boullion and simmered it, adding the cream/gravy flour mixture slowly. It didn't get as thick as I thought it should be, but I was also a little impatient, so maybe it just needed a little more time.  It was really good, and my guests loved it...but it sure seemed like a lot of work! I think next time I'll manage it a little better.

Well... 1300 reviewers can't be wrong! This recipe was awesome. My boyfriend ate two servings! I didn't have any wine on hand so I used chicken broth and I didn't have any paprika so I just used onion salt and garlic powder. I went a little heavy with the salt so next time I will be more careful but the overall result was a great, decadent dinner!

This recipe is SOOOOOOOOO good! This is my first time ever eating cordon bleu and I am very happy with the outcome. I tried to follow the recipe word from word but somehow I forgot to bread the chicken before placing it into the butter. As a result I let the chicken simmer in the wine for 10 min. then placed it in another pan to broil the top in the oven. Even though it took me a little longer because of my mistake it was worth it. You could not go wrong with this recipe.

Fantastic! I made this last night and received rave reviews. The sauce is extraordinary; I am so glad I doubled the recipe! I also coated the chicken with egg and then flour (I am from the south and that is just how we fry things)! I served with mashed potatoes and used the sauce as a gravy. YUMMY! Will definitely be making this again, and again, and again!

I am updating my review to 5 stars...when I first made this recipe I screwed up the sauce because I lowered the portions to only 2. The sauce REALLY makes this dish! It is so simple, yet so delicious. The first time I made this, I happened to find some shredded cheese (not sure of the brand) that was called 'artisan blend' with swiss, gruyere, and some other cheeses. If you can find it, USE IT! It is so incredibly good, and I wish I had it this second time around, but I wasn't able to find it in the store.

this recipe was very tasty. i didn't use the wine (we didn't have any) and it still turned out excellent. I gave it 4 stars instead of five because it was difficult to use toothpics, next time i'll use string. also, it takes a very long time to cook through, i may try the oven next time. Overall excellent though!

Really great.  The next time I will use thin cutlets because even with pounding they were too think.  Also ... i might  dip the chicken in egg before dipping them in flour because the flour came off too easily.  They came out great and were gone before i knew it.

Tastes great!  Used the many suggestions from review to brown the chicken and put it into oven - came out crispy and tasty.  Also used an egg dip instead of just chicken moisture to bread it - much better.  Five stars.

Made it for family dinner Sat. Sept. 27, 2008.  It was SOOOO good..made with fat free 1/2 and 1/2... could make sauce with plain chicken or maybe white fish...used toothpicks to keep together.  Made with tomato basil soup. 

sauce= butter, ff 1/2 &1/2, white wine, garlic..seasoning..corn starch.

SOOOO GOOD! 5 stars!

My husband loves this dish - this was my 2nd time making it.  The first time, I followed the instructions to a T - it was amazing!  This time, I seared the meat then baked in the oven, which was also wonderful.  I think this could be made with milk to cut down fat/calories with cornstarch added to thicken.

easier to make if used with frozen chicken breasts, they seem to be flatter than fresh. used provolone cheese.

I thought this was very flavorful.  I never think about fat and grease, but there was still a bit too much for how I would expect a chicken cordon bleu to turn out.  I prefer something a little more presentable and authentic, despite it still tasting good.  I'm torn on if I will make this again.  Good, but not how I like my chicken cordon bleu.

This recipe is amazing!  It's the sauce that really does it!  The only thing I changed is that I simply dipped the chicken in eggs and bread crumbs before frying instead of the flour mixture and I used provolone cheese instead of swiss.

excellent!  This was my first time making cordon bleu - I used Italian bread crumbs and used a tip from someone to brush the chicken with dijon mustard before putting on the cheese and (I used Canadian bacon) ham.
The wine sauce was SO yummy!  Everyone loved it!  I'll definitely use this recipe again.

Wonderful. Next time, I will use half and half for the sauce. The cream was a bit too rich for us.

Very good!  I pounded the chicken to about 1/4" thickness.  Also salt and peppered the rolls before rolling in the flour.  We'll be making these again.

This is my families favorite!  I have to double the sauce because we love to drench the chicken.  We chow this down so well, I don't even have to make noodles with it, just a vegetable and we are full!  Thanks for a delicious dish!

Oh, so good!  Followed it pretty exactly, except I used breadcrumbs, only three breasts, and put in more ham and cheese.  Also, used regular flour instead of cornstarch - and made extra sauce for asparagus.  YUM!

I just made this delicious dish for dinner.  It definitely deserves 5 stars and I would add a sixth if possible.  I used chicken tenders pounded very thin, smoked deli ham from a package and regular swiss cheese.  The sauce was absolutely devine.  This will become my number 1 company dish.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

I made it today for company and was disappointed. I shouldn't have listened to the reviewers and modified it, I browned the chicken and instead of simmering it on the stove as written I baked it for 20 minutes. They were dry and a lot of the cheese oozed out. If only I had simmered it it may have been better, I simmered the sauce in the pan I used to brown the chicken and of course everyone loved the sauce. Sigh!

This was so easy to make! Tasted good. The sauce was amazing. I used cooking wine since that is what I had on hand. I will try dry white wine next time. Thanks for the easy recipe that makes my husband think I'm brilliant in the kitchen. LOL.

Very very tasty and easy to make.  I chose to season the chicken prior to cooking it which gave it even more flavor.  I suggest that you double the sauce if you would like to use it to enhance your side dish as there is really only enough to pour over the chicken.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

This is a great recipe, relatively easy and delicious. Next time I make it I might try using less paprika and whipping cream, since they overpowered the dry wine in the sauce.

I have always wanted to make this.  Other recipes seemed difficult to follow but this one was easy and the results were even better.  My family thought they were eating something truly gourmet when I served this up with Rice Pilaf and Green Beans.  The only problem was there were no leftovers! I didn't change a thing about this recipe.  It truly deserves 5 stars!

Soo good!  Added fresh garlic when I seared the sides of the checken breasts and baked for 30 min. Perfect!

This was delicious. I forgot to pick up the heavy cream at the store so I used skim milk instead- and it still turned out very tasty.

this recipe is amazing! my entire family loves it. In fact my mother in law often requests that we make it for dinner when nshe comes over! The only thing i did differently was use beer instead of wine it keeps the chicken moist and adds a different taste to the sauce but it'S WONDERFUL

This is a good recipe. I added some salt, pepper, and maybe a little ground marjoram to the flour paparika mixture. I doubled the sauce and made it ahead, then just heated it up and poured the hot sauce down over it. It is good using chicken broth instead of the white wine if you choose. I was able to fix dinner in the morning, head off to the waterpark all day, and come home to a great meal that I just had to heat and serve. This one is a keeper!

This recipe is extremely good. Being a beginner, it proved to be a little messy for me but it was well worth the effort. To cut down on the grease, I made the sauce in a separate pan instead of all the greasy butter from cooking the chicken. I just added a little extra virgin olive oil to it instead. And the toothpicks were a pain but I didn't bother taking them out; I just told my husband to be careful when he cut and ate the chicken. I would use larger toothpicks or even skewers next time so that they are more easily removed.  Great recipe, though!

We ended up baking the chicken right after browning them b/c the chicken was too thick. We baked the chicken at 350F for 30 mins, but wrapped & sealed them in foil to keep them moist. Then I opened foil & drained the juice back into the skillet, to add the wine, chicken bouillon, whipping cream & corn starch(+cold water) to finish off the sauce. I kept  the sauce heating for a while & stirring which was my mistake of not serving it once it was ready. My guests really enjoyed this dish & how moist the chicken was.

Not that this needs another rave review, but this was the yummiest dinner I have made in a LONG time! I as most of you hate it when people change recipes and then review them but I have to note that I used a bit more wine in the sauce, used lowfat milk since that is all I had and added a little parseley. I seasoned the inside of the chicken breasts with a little ground pepper and garlic powder before putting on the cheese and ham and it was awesome! Served with green beans and rice pilaf and everyone licked the plate!

After every new recipe, I ask my husband to rate it, he has never given anything a perfect score, he's picky like that. But this he gave 5 stars! He absolutely loved it, I followed the directions exactly and it came out perfect! Would be a great meal for company! Thanks for sharing!!

This recipe was delicious and easy to make.  I used chicken broth in place of the white wine and bouillon (thats what I had at home and it worked great).  To reduce the fat I used 1 tblspn butter and 2 tblspn olive oil for browning, and 1/4 cup heavy cream w/ 1/4 cup chicken stock w/ the cornstarch for the sauce.

This is quite good, the sauce is delicious!  I just wish that I had added a slice or two more of ham & cheese to each piece of chicken, as I couldn't notice them much when eating.  But overall this was an easy & tasty recipe that I will make again.

The key is to pound the chicken until it is very thin or purchase purchase thinly cut cutlets.  The sauce is exquisite.  My cooking time was less than 30 min - 20 was perfect!!!  I served w/ rice and peas and carrots to two boys (7 & 9) and my husband to rave reviews!  I only used 3 tbsps of butter and replaced the cream with half and half!!! Perfect!

Absolutely wonderful.  I am a novice cook, I followed the recipe, and it turned out as good as I hoped.  I did tie the bundles with string as suggested by another reviewer.  That made browning very easy.

I really enjoyed this dish.  I needed to pound the chicken a little thinner. With that being said, you can guess that I had trouble with the rolling the ham and cheese, toothpicks, and then the cheese oozing out. I also, used chicken broth instead of wine. (non-drinkers).  Other than that stayed with the recipe.  That is why the 4 stars; my ineptitude with the pounding of the chicken and the chicken broth.  Other than that a 5. Served this with the Oven Roasted Potatoes from this site. Good meal, thanks for the recipe.

I used smoked gouda instead of swiss, and it was delightful!  The cream sauce goes very well with rice too, so double the batch.  Even my 8 year-old liked it, which is really saying something.

This was soooo delicious! It wasn't very hard to make either. The cream sauce is definitly the thing that makes this different than any other cordon bleu I've made. I will be using this recipe often!

Delish! I made the sauce separately on the stovetop and finished the chix in the oven. Served w/ sautéed spinach and yellow rice. The toothpicks are a huge pain to get out so next time I’ll try the dried spaghetti thing as recommended by others. Thanks for a great recipe =o)

This is divine - We are not big fans of wine, but found Leelanau Cellars Winter White ($5/bottle at local supermarket) to be perfect for this recipe. We put seasoned salt in with the flour before dredging the chicken.

This was an amazing recipe. My guests loved it. I doubled the sauce because I know my friends like to add it to whatever the side dish is- I made cous cous with this meal- and it was a hit.

I didn't bother to roll the chicken breasts, I just placed the cheese and ham on the chicken during the last five minutes when simmering in the wine.  I have got to say this dish is top notch....thanks for the great recipe.

I have made this recipe before with the wine and it was good. This time I had my son and I decided to use a half cup of chicken bullion with water like another poster said.I also added 3 tbls of oil and 3 tbls of butter. It did cook faster. I think I used heavy whipping cream lol I am in sweden and they had several creams for different types of meat. Whatever the case it all came out really really good. I will coat it with egg and use bread crumbs next time just to give it a little more coating. It was delicious  and I would recommend it to anyone. My family loved it my husband gave it a 9 out of 10.

Wonderful recipe felt like I was eating at a 5 star restaurant. But I have to admit I made a big mistake, Instead of grabbing white wine at the store, I grabbed white wine vinegar it made the dish real salty, but I can tell with plain white wine it will be awsome. Will definitely recommend to family and friends. Easy recipe as well. Will follow other users advice by adding half butter half olive oil.

The chicken Cordon Bleu II was incredible! I prepared this for a romantic Valentine's dinner, and it was a HIT! I did change one thing tho.. Instead of flour, and paprika, I used an egg wash and coated the chicken in regular bread crumbs. I totally plan on making this again! Thanks!

After all the good ratings I was really prepared for serving something special for dinner. I did make some changes though. I used breadcrumbs as the others suggested and transferred the breasts into a separate pan and baked them in the oven. I was afraid that the breading would become too mushy if cooked in the sauce. I made the sauce and served it on the side. Well, neither my husband, nor I were impressed. It was good, edible, but nothing special. Maybe I did something wrong...I usually make cordon bleu in a little bit different way. After dipping the rolled-up breasts in flour, egg and then breadcrumbs I fry them in oil. Maybe not that healthy, but certainly very tasty with mashed potatoes and pickled cucumbers.

Fixed this for Valentine's Day dinner for my family.  Everyone loved it!!!  I fried it for 10 minutes and then baked it for about 20 at 350.  Also, added bread crumbs to the flour mixture.  I sewed it together with thick sewing thread which was very easy to remove after baking.  Loved it!!!!

This was a delicious and EASY meal to make. I replaced the whipping cream with homogenized (3.25%) milk as it's all I had. I also had no ham so just used Swiss cheese. I would have added broccoli or asparagus if I had had some but I was running low on most items. Thanks!

Made this exactly as the recipe is written, no changes.  I must say this was a really great chicken cordon bleu.  Very easy, rich and creamy.  I will be making this again.

Phenomenal! My husband and I hosted a dinner party tonight and this recipe was a real winner with everyone. Absolutely fabulous. It could not be any better. We used the California Pinot Grigio wine another reviewer suggested and it was amazing. We have decided that this will be our "entertaining" dish from now on. Thank you so much for the best dish I have ever made! It will be a weekly dinner in our home!!!!!!

This was one of my first little cooking adventures and it was SO WONDERFUL!! I made it for my family and in laws and got RAVE reviews!! This recipe was SO EASY!! The only two things were chicken is harder to roll up than you would think and when the chicken goes to the pan to simmer it needs to be turned or something because the bottoms of mine burned a little definitely still edible though!! This is a VERY impressive dish and tastes AMAZING!!

This was sooo good.. Everyone loved it! And I even did the recipe wrong..I put all the ingredients in and let it simmer. Still out of this world. I used the fresh basil idea and didn't use any type of breading on the chicken just browned it. NUMMMMM!

What a wonderful surprise! It was easy, used few ingredients, and tasted marvelous. I did use a white wine (whatever was open at the time) and that really moved this dish into the 5 star category. My husband says, "It's a Keeper!"

If you love Cordon Bleu, then you'll love this. I made this last night for guests and they all thought I should be changing professions to a chef. It is absolutely fantastic and one I'll add to my regular menu.

I thought this meal was fabulous.  In fact, this meal is the entire reason that I am now a member here at allrecipes.com. We had this twice and it was excellent.  The gravy is absolutely scrumptious!  My girlfriend's sister made this both times, but now I want to try it myself.

Yum! I made this recipe based on the number of reviews it received. One of the best dishes I've made to date! What more can I say that hasn't already been said? Excellent dish to serve to company. My husband raved about it and will definitely keep this recipe on hand!

I made this for a dinner party, and it was a huge hit!  The rich and creamy sauce is perfect over the top of mashed potatoes, too!  I served asparagus wrapped in proscuitto and baked in the oven with this, along with the mashed potatoes.  I used kitchen string to tie the rolled chicken up, and then once it was fried I cut the string off before doing the sauce part of the recipe.  It's SO good.  Try it, you won't regret it!

This is a quick and relatively easy chicken cordon bleu recipe that my boyfriend gobbled down (even though he said he wasn't a big fan of cordon bleu to begin with).  I followed the recipe ver batim except that I only used two chicken breasts (and had a lot of extra sauce).  Like others said, the gravy is the best part, so the extra wasn't a burden.  I served this over rice, but my boyfriend and I are thinking the gravy would be fantastic over potatoes.  We only had Chardonnay in the house - it was a touch too floral.  I will try to get my hands on some Pinot next time.  Five stars from me - this is good eatin'!

UPDATE:  I've found Barefoot Pinot to be a cheap and tasty wine to use.  I prefer to use egg wash/bread crumbs over flour.  I also had to last-minute substitute 2% milk for heavy cream, and it turned out fine. Sure, some of the richness is gone, but it's still very, very good.

This has become a pretty popular dish in my household. We have made it for company multiple times and everyone has raved about it. We don't make any changes to the recipe, although we make more of the sauce then what the recipe calls for. It makes DELICIOUS gravy for mashed potatoes!

A bit complicated recipe but worth the time. This was my first Chicken Cordon Bleu effort and I loved it! I used Half butter, half olive oil to brown the chicken. In my opinion you should definitely use the wine. Substituting with broth just will not achieve the maximum flavor. Also I tied my rolled chicken with twine and forgot about the toothpicks, they're too complicated to dig out afterwards. If you're not a huge fan of Swiss, use baby swiss. Its much milder while packing the same punch. And last but not least, this dish needs citrus. Serve with some fresh lemon slices on the side. Yum!

This was easy to make and a great meal to make for a bunch of people!!!  Would definitely recommend this!!!  The only thing I did differently was instead of using cornstarch to thicken the sauce, I melted 3 TBS of butter and whisked in 3 TBS flour to make a roux and then added that to the sauce to thicken it.

This is very good. I use cooking wine instead of the real stuff. I've make it quite often.

This recipe is excellent and simple. I used 2 chicken buillon cubes with one cup of white wine.Simmered the chicken until it was done and then removed from pan. Added the heavy cream mixed with corn starch. Served the sauce on the side with stuffing. Delicious over everything. Used the remainder of the sauce the next day with some cubed up cooked chicken breast. Almost reminds me of chicken marsala. Don't be afraid to try this! Used a pinot grigio off the clearance rack for 3.99

Wow! This recipe was so delicious. Even my PICKY 6 and 4 year olds had a few bites and liked it. Did I mention they are picky! I used half and half instead of cream but otherwise followed the recipe closely. It was a bit dry but I kept it in my warming oven for almost 15 minutes so that may have done it. I'll watch it more closely next time. Thank you so much!

Great recipe! We left off the breading and omitted the cream sauce, and put bread crumbs in the filling. Delicious.

very good-I used the chicken broth as was suggested instead of the wine and it still tasted great.  Think I'll try the wine next time though.

This was pretty good. But to cut calories next time I will substitute cream of chicken soup for the heavy cream. I served this with a baked sweet potato and Sugar pea pods for color.

The very best chicken cordon bleu I ever cooked and tasted for the very first time. My wife loved it and children ate every bit of it. I substituted Land-O-Lakes margarine instead of butter. I hoped for some left overs but to my surprise only gravy was left!!!. I will definitely make this one again.

My family loved this version of the classic. The only change we made was to spread Dijon mustard on the chicken before rolling up the ham/cheese. It's easy & quick, not at all intimidating. The wine reduction and cream make an incredible sauce. Tastes like you cooked for hours. Thanks!!

I did not care for this recipe. I even made it a second time just to make sure I did everything right, but it still didn't work for me. I'm giving this 5 stars though because my husband loved it, so I guess it's just a matter of personal taste.

Totally delicious. The first time I made this it was amazing. The second time I had trouble with the sauce. There was a step where I didn't follow the measurement exactly. My advice is follow exactly and it will turn out amazing!!!

Very good recipe. I made a few small changes in the preperation of the chicken. I rolled the cheese in ham, and then rolled the chicken around them. I breaded the breasts in both flour and then bread crumbs (using an egg wash). I fried them for about 5 minutes in oil until they were brown, and then baked them for about 30mins in the oven. They looked and tasted excellent!  My sauce wasn't the best (accidently used some corn SYRUP instead of starch at first... i'm a beginner!) though it ended up tasting quite good. I ended up putting a fair amount of parsley in the sauce, but otherwise I followed the recipe. Served it all with wild rice, salad, mashed carrots/parsnips, and asparagus. It all disappeared!

I had high hopes for this recipe, so I didn't change a thing.  It was wonderful!  Like others have said, the amount of sauce was enough and went well with rice (and pasta too, I would imagine).  As long as you pound your meat thin enough the cook time will be plenty.  Great recipe, even for beginners!

My fellow wanted this for his birthday supper. My guests loved it and I thought it was pretty easy, though removing the toothpicks was a pain in the butt.  I didn't use wine, and substituted soy milk for heavy cream, in an attempt to make this a little more compatible to my dairy-free, alcohol-free requirements.  Kept a cheese-free piece of chicken specially marked for myself.  I've had the real thing before I developed food allergies, and this alternative is not as decadent but is still really good. It's why I can't give it 5 stars, though.

Loved this chicken dish.  I thought we had some swiss cheese, but we only had pepper jack cheese.  Everyone loved it and they liked the hint of "spicy" flare to it.  Definitely will make again.

This was excellent! Even the kids loved this dish and it was easy to make. I made the sauce a side so everyone could try it first.

My family absolutely LOVES this recipe! Requested at least twice a month by my husband. The only changes I made were to not coat in Flour and Sprinkle lightly with Paprika. Also try this with a Honey Baked sliced Ham.

My family loves this. My hubby says this is one of the top five dinners I make. And my VERY picky children always clean their plates when I make it.  I substituted chicken broth for the wine but everything else was the same.

A family favorite. I do make as written, sometimes I will double the sauce but not always. If serving with a risotto you don't need additional sauce, Serve with another such as long grain or mased potato you may want more.

This recipe was quick and easy, cook time was a little less than stated in the recipe.  My husband and I stay away from alcohol, but even with chicken broth alone it was fabulous, creamy, and delicious...

This recipe is excellent - a huge favorite in my house.  I use low fat swiss cheese and light cream instead of the heavy whipping cream.  You would never know.  Great recipe!

Absolutely wonderful, and very easy to make.  I actually used chicken tenders instead of chiken breasts, since that's what I had on hand.  So, I pounded them out, and ended up making a bunch of "mini" Chicken Cordon Bleus.  It worked just as well, and cooked in a lot less time (simmered about 10-15 min).  I also used baking wine (sherry), which still gave it a great flavor.  Other than that, I followed the directions as they're written.  Wonderful, thanks for the recipe. I will certainly make it again!

So YUMMY! This was a big hit with the family.  The sauce really makes the meal so I would recommend making more.  I put the chicken in the broiler for a few minutes after taking it out of the pan. It gave the chicken a nice crispy skin. This is a keeper!

This was an excellent recipe. I cooked it for my families Labor Day cookoff. Yes it was a winner. I made a few changes, we are a family that love flavor, so I marinated thin chicken fillets for about 3 hours in the refrigerator with garlic salt and black pepper on one side and the other with season all. Then I followed the directions except for butter, I'm not a big fan of real butter so I used margarine instead. This dish was a real WINNER!!!

This is awesome!  I made it to impress my fiance's grandmother and it was a big hit!  The only change I made was cutting the butter in half and adding half butter and half olive oil for a little less fat.  I will definitely make again!

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I followed the directions exactly except I left out the cornstarch.  It was thick enough for us without it, and some of the other reviewers had had problems with their sauces clumping after adding the cornstarch.  I didn't want to risk it. My husband ate until he hurt himself, LOL.

great!  Delish!!!  My man loved it.  But this is a special treat, it was labor intensive and very rich.  I will make it again, it is the perfect Sunday dinner treat.

Very easy to make. I ended up using turkey breasts instead of chicken and it came out a bit dry, although it was still quite good. Next time I will try chicken to see if that makes a difference. Turkey works, though.

This was wonderful!!  I did use chicken broth instead of wine.  The only change I made.  I was really good.  My husband, 3 year old, and 1 year old all ate it up!  Thank you!

Absolutely excellent.  I followed the recipe exactly except used fat free half-and-half.  I knew it would make the sauce a bit runny but it was still fabulous.  My kids and husband all loved it and begged me to make it again.

I wasn't that impressed with this recipe having tried so many like this, it could have been the type of ham that i used (deli ham) but even so the sauce was just 'okay'

I followed the recipe and wasn't as impressed as I was expecting (based on all of the reviews).  It was good, but not great.  It seemed to be missing something.  The recipe made so much left over sauce, however we don't put sauce on our veggies like some do. I'll try cutting back the cream next time and see if that helps as well as finding a different type of ham that has more flavor.

I thought this was delicious as is, but my husband prefers the recipe I make with bread crumbs and a sour cream/wine based sauce.  Maybe next time I'll combine the two recipes and see what I come up with. I butterflied my chicken breasts and other than that no changes.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!  I made this the first time my parents came over for dinner at my new husband and I's apartment.  When I asked my dad what he wanted me to make, he said chicken cordon bleu, thinking I'd have difficulty with it.  But surprisingly with this recipe, it really wasn't bad!!  Loved the flavor - will make again!

WOW! is all the words I can say.  I'm a person who doesn't like the bread crumbs, so this is the one for me.  It is so flavourful and moist.  Hands down the best I have tasted.  Not for people who are watching what they eat...and it is a rich meal....but it is sooooooooooooooooooo YUMMY!!!!!! Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Something nasty happened to our sauce...maybe bad cream.  I don't think I would like the sauce even if it was good. The chicken was good alone with the ham and cheese. Maybe just add what is left in the pan after simmering instead of making the sauce next time. I don't want to waste the yummy wine and mask in cream.

My boyfriend said that it was not only the best thing I've ever made for him, but it even topped anything his mom makes! It almost made me cry. The only substitution I made was using provolone instead of swiss, and I made extra sauce, as other reviews have suggested. I served it with brown rice and mashed potatoes.

The sauce was really good and I will definitely make it again.  However, the chicken took a long time to pound and assemble and it was only ok.  I think next time I make it I'll just use seasoned chicken tenders and follow the recipe for the sauce.

WOW. This is what cooking is supposed to be like. I have been cooking regularly for 2-3 years. This was one of my best efforts and it was due largely to the recipe. What a super recipe and yes, for goodness sake, double the sauce. Thanks to all for their advice and especially thanks for a great recipe.

This is my fiance's favorite dinner to order in a restaurant, so I decided to make it for Christmas Eve.  "Finger lickin good" as our dinner guests remarked....and I read where someone said to double the sauce and glad that I did!

This was amazing. We loved the creamy sauce, it is excellent on a baked potato with the chicken. I used double the flour. And 2 tsp. of bullion instead of 1 tsp. This will be made again and again in our house!

My boyfried and I absolutely loved this recipe!  We made some changes that other reviewers suggested, such as using 1/2 and 1/2 and finishing it off in the oven.  I didn't have tooth picks on hand, so I used cooking string to secure the rolls together.  It worked perfectly, I think maybe even better then tooth picks would have.  This is a keeper recipe!

I actually used the Chicken Cordon Bleu I recipe, but used your cream sauce for the pasta., I added finely chopped mushrooms and onions, delicious.  We loved this. Your all recipes.com has turned me into a surprise new chef.  Thank You .

This was easy and delicious!  I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and after coating the rolled chicken with flour, I dipped it in melted butter and rolled in bread crumbs.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time though, I will probably omit the bread crumbs because it left crumbs in the sauce, and I had to transfer the liquid (minus the crumbs) to another pan to finish the sauce.  The sauce was incredibly good!  Thank you very much for sharing this recipe.

it sounded like fun and it seemed like it should have been delicious with all the great reviews, but it was difficult to make and the toothpicks made it difficult to brown in the pan... i ended up just putting it all in the oven... sauce was good though...

WOW!!! This recipe was OUTSTANDING and I will definitely make this again! I substituted prosciutto just because I like it better than traditional ham. This is a truly succulent dish I'd be proud to serve to anyone.

Thisis such a great and easy recipe!!!   I cooked for my boyfriend who loved it.  I was really impressed with how easy the wine sauce was to make because this was my first wine sauce.  I have made it twice now and I did alter it the second time, I used the last part of the Chicken Cordon Bleu I and for hte last 5 minutes, baked it in the oven with a half a slice of swiss cheese and this made it really pop the taste buds.  I definitely will be making this many times!!!!!!

Huge hit in our household!!!  Everyone loved it and no one requested any changes.  I used Provolone cheese since I had it on hand.  Needed more flour/paprika then recipe called for but other than that, it was delicious!!!  Didn't find that it was too time consuming at all!!

This was pretty good- I just rolled the chicken in italian breadcrumbs after pounding it and cooked it on 400 til almost done, then topped with a slice of provolone (husband rarely likes swiss) and a slice of ham.  then i poured the sauce over it- i added to much cornstarch so the sauce was wierd but it was still good.  i'll do a better job on the sauce next time! :)

It was good but I have had so many better chicken dishes. I am not sure how it is receiving almost straight 5 stars. I am not sure if it is worth all the effort. If you plan on serving side dishes with this meal you need more than 2 hands so be sure you have help to prepare the other dishes.

Delicious recipe - the only change I made was that I cooked the chicken in the skillet for a very short time (about 7 or 8 minutes) and then put the pieces in the oven to bake at 400 for about 20 minutes. I made the sauce while the chicken was baking. I served it over some jasmine rice - it was delicious!

This is one of my favorites from this site.
I put the chicken rolls under the broiler just before serving because my husband doesn't like soggy breading, then spoon the
sauce over the top.  The only thing I have changed is to use 1/2 and 1/2 instead of the heavy whipping cream and it didn't hurt the quality at all.

This turned out delicious. It's such a common sense recipe, easy for one serving or 20 servings.  The sauce is great too.

This recipe is a labor of love, but it's well worth the efforts.  I made it for a farewell party, and it was a big hit.  I sauteed minced garlic and shallots in the butter before adding the chicken, and I think it enhanced the flavor.  In any case, this was a BIG hit.

Yummy....made a few adjustments. I egged, breaded(in italian flavored crumbs) and fried my chicken cutlets first. I place them in a baking pan and layered the ham and swiss on top...covered with foil and heated until the cheese was melted. I made the wine sauce on top on the stove (also used fat free 1/2 and 1/2 instead of heavy cream)and halved it..we poured some of the wine sauce over the cutlet cordon bleu. It was delicious! Sometimes when I make a cordon bleu the rolled way....the cheese totally runs out as it is cooking.....same concept here....just easier to prepare....same great taste!! Thanks for a great recipe!

Loved it!   My six year old kept saying how delicious it was and my husband ended up eating my 4 year old son's (he tries nothing).  The sauce was a perfect mix of flavors!

WOW.  Chicken Cordon Bleu is easily one of my favorite meals, so I have had it prepared many different ways.  This is BY FAR the best recipe I have tasted.  The sauce is just amazing.  I followed the recipe precisely, and it was perfect.  My husband practically inhaled it, and he called me a gourmet chef after this one!

I grew up with my Mom making Chicken Cordon Bleu, but when my boyfriend found this recipe on here and made it...one word:  YUM!  Now, I beg him to make it, and love it!  Its really easy, too.  I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone.

very good, I took the suggestion of a previous person and finished it off by baking it in the oven with the sauce poured over it. Serve over a mixture of basmati and wild rice.

Superb!  This was a huge hit at dinner last night.  Just because we like them, I added a 10 ounce package of sliced fresh mushrooms to the pan while browning the chicken.  This truly is a worthy entree for a dinner party!

This recipe was out of this world! My husband gave me the look of love after tasting his first bite! Very fattening, but really nice and tasty for a special occasion. I followed the recipe to the letter and I guess everything was perfect except I might add some salt to the sauce. Excellent!

this was pretty good and i'd definitely make it again. i used chicken broth instead of the white wine as i don't tend to have wine on hand.  securing it well with the toothpicks is a must so that not all of the cheese melts out.
the only thing i would like is if the sauce was a little more flavorful.

I enjoyed this take on a classic in my home. My husband said he could have done without the sauce, but the chicken itself was very good.

5 stars for taste but it just felt a little unhealthy with all the butter and cream.  Any suggestions to make it healthier but just as tasty?

Good, but not perfect.  The sauce is really good.  The chicken was a little dry and lacked flavor, the ham and swiss were falvorful, but the chicken was not, next time I might try breading the chicken with something more.  I will make this again with more added to the chicken next time.

I loved this chicken, and make the sauce it is so good and puts the final touch to this dish.  I used my left over spiral ham from the night before.

I have a 4 year old and a husband who are picky eaters. They both love this reciepe and are always asking me to make the "good chicken" plate. I have to say this is one of our favorite dishes to eat. The wine sauce has a great aroma when entertaining company, they think you slaved in the kitchen. When in all reality this is a great easy dish to make and serve. Thank you for the wonderful recipe. I have made it several times for family and friends. "EVERYONE LOVES IT"

Excellent dish, especially for company, because it looks so fancy.  The chicken came out this wonderfully even golden color, beautiful.  I didn't have bouillon, so I used a little chicken broth instead, but will try to use bouillon in the future -- the sauce, though great, needed just a tad more flavor to it to be "wow".  I followed the directions exactly and it came out great.  Only change was using xantham gum instead of cornstarch to thicken (less carbs) and cutting the butter down to 4 tbls.

The chicken can be a little dry (like in all Cordon Bleu recipies), but the sauce is the best thing you have ever tasted.  Its great as a gravy over red potatoes.

This recipe totally rocks.  It takes a little extra time to pound the chicken but it's worth every minute.  I left the recipe exactly as it's written.  The sauce is soooo good I could have eaten it with a spoon.  Will definitely make this one again!

Yuuummmmm!  The sauce is absolutely delicious and pairs perfectly with the chicken in this dish.  I didn't have any bouillon granules so I added about a 1/2 cup of chicken broth. This worked great for two reasons.  Less salty and MORE sauce.  :D  Thanks!

This was very rich and tasty, I tried to pound out and roll the chicken up and that was a little tricky, I didn't get it thin enough I guess.  I lost most of the cheese in mine but my husband said his was nice and cheesey.  All in all it was very good just one of those finicky recipes.  Would definitely make again.

Fantastic! To make it easy for myself, I added the ham and cheese on the last few minutes to melt then took it out to make the sauce and left it in the oven on low to stay warm. The sauce is soooo good!
