This is awesome. I did however, make a few changes. One after browning the meat I browned some sliced mushrooms (one package of the fresh sliced ones). I diced my onions and cooked them with the mushrooms, cooking until all of the moisture was gone. I baked the meat with the sauce and mushrooms and onions tightly covered for 1-1/2 hours without the stuffing. I wanted to make sure the meat was very tender. I then added 1/2 cup more water and then topped it with the stuffing, covered and baked for another hour. This made for very tender beef, a nice amount of sauce with the stuffing it was awesome. Next time I would also add 1 cup of frozen petite green peas when I add the 1/2 cup extra water to the meat and then top with the stuffing.

I used beef flavored rice mix instead of stuffing and increased the water to 1-1/2 cups.  It was delicious!!

I made this exactly as Kelly wrote it, and it was OUTSTANDING!  What a delicious dish! This is the first time I've made round steak (other than in a crockpot) that didn't come out dry and icky. I can't tell you how good this was.  Just be sure to cover the pan with foil while baking, and you're in for a treat!

We loved this for an easy fix meal.  I used a jar of brown gravy instead of the soup as no one in my house likes cream of mushroom soup.  I also covered it for the first 45 minutes so the stuffing would not brown to much.

WOW!!! We really enjoyed this.  I used a package of onion soup mix instead of chopped onion and beef boullion, and added about 1/3 cup more water.  Also covered for the first 45 mins. or so as others had suggested.  This will most certainly be made again and again.

We really, really liked this recipe, a complete, comfort food meal.  I can't wait to make again, just trying to decide appropriate waiting period before I can make for the family so they don't get tired of it.  You must try this one!

My husband and uncle loved this recipe. For a change I added onion soup mix to the flour and after I was finished tenderizing the meat and dipping it in the flour, I added the flour to the gravy mix. It was a bit time consuming, but perfect for a Saturday evening dinner. I will definetly keep this one!

Very flavorful.  I couldn't find stuffing for beef so I used stuffing for pork.  The stuffing gave it just the right amount of savory taste.

This was a tasty and delicious dish rated a 3 star in our family of 6. Although next time I will spray the bottom of our casserole dish with cooking spray and put 2 boxes of stuffing on the bottom then the meat and sauce on top. Also for more flavor next time we have decided to add sour cream in our sauce mixture along with real sliced mushrooms and a just a dash more salt and pepper to taste. :-)

Love this recipe!  My mother-in-law always gives up tenderized round steak and I never know what to do with it.  I have made this twice now and both times we have loved it.  I do recommend covering the dish while baking, the first time I did not and the stuffing was rather crunchy.  Thank you Kelly for a great recipe!

I thought it tasted like something was missing. I think next time Ill add mushrooms, my 10 year old did not like it at all. I used herb stuffing. I would like to know where I can buy beef stuffing. I don"t believe it exists.

very tender when cooked the 2 hours.  Added a lb. of fresh mushrooms and more would be okay too.  Used dry soup mix instead of cream of mushroom soup.  Delicious!

My, oh my what a delicious meal this was. We cooked it in the crockpot adding the stuffing about an hour before the end. Excellent, oh so yummy!

The first time I tried it, I felt that the stuffing was too brown also.  So the next time I tried it, I put a little of the gravy over the meat (basically just to cover the pan where the meat didn't) then I put the rest of the gravy over the dressing.  A lot better but I'll try the foil tip next time.  I actually used deer round steak!  Couldn't even tell it was deer!

This was a good dish overall. I followed someone else's suggestion and covered it with foil for the first 30 mins, then uncovered it for the remaining time. The meat was SO tender, that had to be my favorite part of this dish. Next time I think I'll add the stuffing to the pan first, like someone suggested in previous reviews. A bit on the salty side, but I LOVE salt, so I had no problem with that. Thanks for sharing.

This was merely OK. The real title should say Steak and stuffing, because its not much of a gravy sauce. The meat was moist, and I definetly ate it, but nothing to write home about.

Not bad!  The stuffing browned too much; next time I might put it on the bottom or cover the dish. Also, 1 box of stuffing was fine for 1.5 lbs. of steak but would want more for larger steak. I skipped dredging the steak in flour before browning and it turned out fine.

This was a tender and very favorable dish that our whole family enjoyed!  Just a couple of modifications...I sautéed the onions in the pan with mushrooms prior to adding the soup mix. I was out of beef bouillon so I used 1 tbs of Worcestershire instead.   It gave it a really good flavor!  I also cooked the dish in a Dutch oven with the lid on for 1 1/2 hours and served the mixture over brown rice. I'd definitely make this dish again!

I have picked my brain trying to figure out what I could have done wrong with this recipe and have come up with nothing. Except for using tinfoil, I prepared it as directed and it was a mushy brown mess. It LOOKED gross. The meat was NOT tender. It was very salty. With all the good reviews I must have done something wrong??? But I have reread the recipe several times and don't see what I missed. We ended up throwing it out and just ate the sides we had also prepared.

I tried this recipe last night when I had no idea what to do with a top round beef roast.  I followed the recipe only changing a few things.  With the recommendation of other reviews, I cooked it covered with foil for the first half hour.  I also sauteed onions and mushrooms and put them on top of the beef before the gravy/stuffing.  My fiancee loved it!  Since it's just the 2 of us, we have a LOT left over, but that's not a bad thing!  I will definitely make it again!

This was wonderful!! I was very suprised that I enjoyed this and so did my family. I didn't make the stuffing but made white rice, which I put the meat and gravy on. My picky 11 yr old that hates gravy had extra the night I made this for dinner.

Very good.  I didn't think it was too salty like others. The only thing I was confused about is the water.  I wasn't sure if I added the 1 cup of water to the soup or to the stuffing.  It turned out great anyway.

Recipe was easy and I was able to prepare early & bake later (for on the go moms).  I followed the suggestion to put the stuffing on the bottom.

My family loved this!  The only thing I did different was baked it 30 minutes with foil on and then removed the foil for the last 30 minutes.  The stuffing was slightly browned, but not crispy or soggy.  It was one that I will make again. Thanks.

I liked the dish, but my husband thought the soup made the stuffing too mushy.  This is a great way to tenderize round beef steak, however.  I surrounded the baking dish with foil to assure a
good insulation.

a great dinner. I had to change it up to fit my weeknight schedule so I placed the round steak frozen into slow cooker and topped with ingrediants including lipton onion soup mix and cooked on low 9 hours. Came home and placed in dish and then topped with gravy that I thickened using cornstarch and added some sour cream. Then, stuffing on top. Baked half an hour. It was great!

This turned out good. My family doesn't like mushrooms, so I omitted the soup, per another reviewer, and used beef gravy instead. Added some green pepper into the mixture. The store was out of beef stuffing, so I used cornbread stuffing instead, and added a little bit of beef boullion to the mix. Baked covered with foil. A+ recipe. Thanks for sharing.

I used the London Broil cut of round steak which is a bit thicker than other round steak cuts. The end result was a tough steak. I don't think there is enough liquid for braising the meat or the stuffing soaked it up (I did use extra stuffing). I covered like others suggested and removed foil towards end. After we finished eating dinner I added beef broth, covered again with foil, and returned to oven for another  45 minutes to an hour at 300°.  It helped make the meat more tender but not enough.  If I were to make again I would add a can of beef broth and cook at 275° for 3 hours. Like Kelly states, "The longer you cook it, the more tender the steak gets."

We loved this recipe.  There are never any leftovers.  The steak is so tender you can cut it with a fork.

Made this last night and tried to alter recipe some for the crock pot.  I know I did some things differently but it turned out terribly.  I think I may have needed to cut down on the water some next time, the stuffing ended up mixing w/ everything else and looked like brown mush.  My husband didn't even want to eat it.

This recipe was okay.  I'll probably not make it again.  It just wasn't "exotic" enough, or had enough flavor for our family.  If you are a meat-and-potatoes kind of person, you'll like it.  I used low sodium mushroom soup, and I thought it needed more salt.  The original soup mix was probably perfect.

This was wonderful! I followed other readers' suggestions and put the stuffing in the pan first. I baked for a total of 2 hours, and added mushrooms during the last 15 minutes. The beef was fork-tender and delicious.

Found this recipie to be good, makes the steak very tender, although way to salty. Perhaps needs something added to reduce the salt taste.

It was surprising how tender this meat came out.  I cooked the recipe exactly as stated.  The dressing was a little too brown, but very tasty.  The entire family enjoyed it and I've placed this in my recipe box for future use.

This recipe was great, except I used herb seasoned stuffing and it came in a bag and I just mixed it up with some butter and water, but I think I used too much of the stuffing.  It was so filling.  Now I will know next time to just use the box of stuffing 7 oz, although some do like all that stuffing.

This recipe was very pleasing.  It's a good alternative to when you don't want potatoes.  I tenderized the steak before browning it.  I also just used a can of brown gravy instead of the soup and it came out terrific.  My husband thought this was wonderful.

This is a great dish!  I cooked this in a smaller baking dish and one box of stuffing was fine.  Can also use this recipe with chicken & chicken flavor stuffing. Just use boneless chicken breasts (4) and bake 1 hour till chicken is done!

My family enjoyed it, however, I beleive
two boxes of stuffing mix should be placed
on top.  One box was not enough to cover.
