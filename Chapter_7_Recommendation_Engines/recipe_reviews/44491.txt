I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this sauce!!!!  This will be "one and only" BBQ sauce from now on.  It's thick, sweet and spicy and beautiful in color!  To try it out..first I cut the servings to 12.  I followed the scaled measurements except only used a pinch of cayenne and chili powder.  Concern was it may be too spicy for kids.  I did not have celery seed, so I had to leave it out.  If you like a sweet and spicy sauce you must try this recipe.  I will use this on chicken, pulled pork and ribs.  UPDATE: I've made this again using the celery seed and think I like the taste without it.  Also for a nice thick sauce it is necessary to simmer on low for at least 20 minutes.

Great! For anyone who like's sweet baby rays brand barbeque sauce, this is it! And advice to anyone wanting to make it, don't leave out the liquid smoke! I didn't have any, so I was just going to leave it out, but then my Dad offered to buy me some and when we added it it was SO much better and really added to the flavor. Only suggestions are that oil can be substituted for the butter or left out alltogether, the molasses can be reduced and it's still sweet, and the chili powder, cayenne, and pepper should probably be doubled. Red pepper is also wonderful for the flavor.

This is a GREAT sauce! I am catering a wedding reception the end of this month and needed a sauce I could call my own, so my kitchen was tore up from the floor up! I measured the spices and saved them for later, then I mixed up the liquids over a slow flame, I did not have any red wine vinegar, but I did have some marsala I mixed 1/4c. and the balance I used of white vinegar, I did not add the butter, I figured the fat from the meat would be enough and I wanted it to have some table time.  The sauce tasted good but it had no depth, I only used 3 teaspoons of liquid smoke, and let it simmer for a while.  Once I added the spices it was the bomb!  This is the best sauce I have ever tasted.  The spices are fantastic!!  Whoever thought cinnamon would work in a bbq sauce?  I told my husband, we have to go get a piece of meat to go with the sauce.  Thanks for sharing, this is great!!  I also simmered it for about 1 1/2 hours to thicken, Uuummm finger licken good!!  I will serve it with pulled pork and baked chicken, I am sure you could serve this with fingernails, and toe-jams.it is so goooood!

I better add my comment, since I have been using the sauce for months.  After using this recipe, you can stop searching for the perfect KC BBQ sauce.  You only need 2 BBQ sauce recipes, KC and Texas.  This will fill your KC slot.

I grew up in South Carolina and this BBQ sauce is the closest I've come to having a "taste of home".  I made it when my son and his fraternity buddies were coming to Blacksburg for a football weekend and even with a tripled recipe of pork, I didn't have a drop left.  My son didn't believe everything was homemade.  I used the slow cooker pork BBQ recipe with bouillon and coffee and poured this sauce over after shredding the pork.  Didn't change a thing on either recipe!!

Al must be holding something back if this is his restaurant version!
This Barbeque Sauce needs some tweaking-Cut way back on the Red Wine Vinegar, double the spices (not the salt) and more Liquid Smoke. Also, use half tomato sauce and half tomato paste simmer about 10 min. longer than the recipe suggests-This will give you a thicker sauce.

I have found THE one BBQ sauce. No more store bought awful ones here! I made just as is (but halved the recipe= 1 1/2 C) and I simmered it for about 50 minutes. The next day it was nice and thick. The liquid smoke is a great flavor in this (a must!), and mellows out by the next day. I also used a pinch of cayenne, so the kids could eat it. I used this on some pulled pork, next it'll go on grilled chicken. Next time I'll make the full batch to keep on hand.

I used the sauce for beef ribs.  Whow!  The ribs were out of this world.  I braised the meat and then let it cook in a crock pot in the sauce for some hours - the ribs were fall-apart tender and oh, so delicious!

This is an incredible bbq sauce recipe. I followed directions exactly.  Took 2 beautiful slabs of ribs, precooked them in very low temp oven with a bit of red wine, then grilled them with some garlic rosemary, then separated them and put them back in over with big al's sauce for another hour on very low temp.  Amazing!  It was a crowd pleaser.

Wow, this BBQ sauce is scrump-dilly-ious! I've tried a lot of BBQ recipes through the years and thought I'd never find the perfect one. Well, this is it! I did make a few changes per my tastes, but I still gave it 5 stars because we all have unique tastes, therefore it's be almost impossible to make all people happy. I'm documenting my changes for my future use. I used 1 cup apple cider vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar, I decrease the salt and pepper to 1/2 teaspoon each, I used smokey paprika, I added 1 teaspoon dry mustard, 2 tablespoons dried onions, 1 T wor. sauce, 1 tablespoon honey and  1 teaspoon cumin. These additions are my tastes, not because the BBQ needed any changes. The rest of the ingr. I kept the same. Don't leave out the liquid smoke or it just won't taste like BBQ sauce. For those who said the liquid smoke has an artificial taste, it mellows into the sauce leaving a smokey flavor after it simmers a while.  Next time I'll add chipolte chilies in adobo sauce for a hot wing version and maybe some roasted garlic in the butter.  This made 1 and 1/2 quarts of liquid goodness. I really appreciate you listing this recipe. I can't wait to use it for the 4th of July family gathering!  P.S. This wasn't spicy at all, so if you want a spicy sauce you'll have to add more cayenne. We had this on pulled pork sandwiches and my son reluctantly tried it and loved it. I was shocked! LOL

This recipe is very simple and tastes great.  Not too sweet, not too spicy.  And only about 30 minutes to make.

***SUBSTITUTE FOR 1 CUP OF MOLASSES: 1 cup honey; or 3/4 cup firmly packed brown sugar; or 1 cup dark corn syrup; or 1 cup pure maple syrup.*** I'm so glad I found this recipe. I made the recipe exactly which made about 4 cups. I only used 1/2 for ribs so I have some left over!

Its difficult to describe how good this sauce is! Followed recipe to a T. After reading many reviews I added 1 tsp. dry mustard and cumin, 1 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce and honey also added 2 tbsp. dried onions. Then brought it to a slight boil and simmered it for at least an hour. As it cooled I spent the evening coasting by and dipping my finger and pieces of bread into it. WOW is this ever tasty! Can't wait to try it on chicken and ribs. Thanks for sharing Big Al. You my friend are a stud!

This sauce is "The Stuff!!!". The first time I tried this recipe was actually out of necessity. Necessity meaning we had some baby back ribs to barbeque and we didn’t realize we were completely out of store bought bottled sauce and I was too lazy to change my clothes to make a run to the store so I decided to make a quick search online to see if I could find a good sauce recipe and maybe I’d be lucky enough to have all the ingredients to make it. (Too much information? Oh well.) Anyway, I did just happened to have all the ingredients to make half  the original recipe amount and I was so impressed at the flavor of this homemade sauce that a week later I made a double batch of this wonderful stuff, cooked it way down thick and spicy, water bath canned five pints and saved the rest (about another pint) in a rinsed out ketchup bottle that was just emptied for part of the recipe. The recipe (followed to the letter and cooked down thick) has excellent flavor as it is. But I can see  myself in the future changing it up a bit by substituting fresh ingredients for the powdered and making it a chunky version using fresh tomatoes, onions, garlic and cayenne peppers. And maybe going heavy on the garlic and adding cilantro and basil all from my garden. I give this recipe 5+ stars and I will probably never use store bought BBQ sauce again.

EDITED in 2014: Definitely an easy 5 stars.  This is the best homemade bbq sauce I have ever prepared and I have been making it for quite some time.  Such a beautiful rich color and the blend of spices is right on the mark.  Alan sure does know what he is doing.  Thanks for sharing.

I haven't posted a recipe review in years on this site, and had even let my account lapse. I created a new account JUST to rate this recipe! First of all, and I normally DONT alter a recipe the first time I try it, I had no ground mustard and no idea what sort of molasses to use, so I subbed honey. This sauce is the most perfect BBQ sauce I have ever tried...my step dad made it first true to reipe and it instantly remined me of the sauce put on the ribs at a certain famous Beale Street, Memphis cafe. However, when I used the honey for my own batch, it knocked everyone's socks off! The texture is perfect for grilling, marinating and even dipping. When I am in a time fix, I boil chicken breasts in water until done, drain, then coat with this sauce and put under the oven broiler for a wonderful faux bbq grilled chicken. I highly recommend using the honey, and not altering the recipe in ANY other way! (Be careful when grilling with honey, it scorches fast!) This recipe makes enough to share AND keep, and I am ashamed to say that the longer I keep it airtight in my fridge, the better it gets...
By the way, I am also ashamed to say that when people tell me that I should bottle and sell "my" bbq sauce, I never admit that it really isn't my own! Thank you, Big Al, for my new title as BBQ Queen!!!!

After searching for years for a good bottled BBQ Sauce I gave up and started searching for DIY recipes...I found it!  I now make this sauce in quantity and have it in quarts.  None better.

This is a really decent home-made barbecue sauce. I probably won't make any other kind anymore.  I love the blend of spices. A "little bit of a kick" is an understatement, though, and I love all things spicy.  I guess I was hoping for a milder spice for my kids, but my husband and I will love it, anyways.  I simmered this for half an hour for a thicker sauce...just like we like it!

This is one tasty sauce. I've never had Sweet Baby Ray's, so I have no comparisons. This is a sweet and tangy sauce. I ended up cooking it for about 1 1/2 hours. The sauce was still fairly thin, but thickened up well after it was off the heat. Tasted good on bbq chicken drumsticks. My only issue I had is that it has seemed to have lost some of the heat after sitting in the fridge for a day. All in all, this is probably the best sauce I've ever had.

2 words - DA BOMB. I used this sauce on both beef and pork ribs. My guests were asking for more.  A few even wanted some to take home. Excellent recipe.

Very good!  I ran out of red wine vinegar so I had to sub about 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar; also, I had no celery seed so I used celery salt for the salt.  We used about half on some barbecue chicken.  Next time I might add some jalapeno or other chili pepper - the sauce is very sweet and I think a little more spice would be nice in this.

Fabulous!  I've used this on pork back ribs, chicken, and tonight pulled pork - delicious every time!  I've bought BBQ sauce from the butcher, then ordered online from Colorado, then bought KC Masterpiece (since the consumer mag rated it number 1).  This tops them all!  I made a big batch last time and froze half of it.  Defrosted in no time and was just as good!  Thank you!

Average at best. I thought I'd give it try based on the 600+ reviews, oh well. I'm making it as I write this, I keep tweaking the spices and have doubled and tripled cayenne and paprika looking for some heat. I've added some allspice, trying to replicate my favorite KC style sauce- Hayward’s, order some for yourself, it's amazing.

This is the absolute BEST!  I have made it twice.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and the second time I substituted homemade ketchup for the tomato sauce (making it 4 cups of homemade ketchup in all).  Both times were a big hit.

WONDERFUL!!!  Being a Kansas Citian myself, this is what KC is all about...EXCELLENT BBQ SAUCE.  Everyone who tries it LOVES it.  It tends to be a bit thin, so I cook it quite a bit longer for the desired thickness.  THANKS BIG AL!

This sauce is really good!  I made it tonight when I realized I was out of bottled sauce.  I didn't have the liquid smoke, and I omitted the butter; otherwise I followed exactly.  I love the balance between the vinegar and the sweet--perfect!  I will be using this recipe from now on instead of the bottled sauce.

This is a great sauce--the first I've tried that was a little more complex in its flavorings.  Our favorite KC place is Oklahoma Joes.  This sauce is close to theirs, but not as hot, so I added Red Pepper, plenty of black pepper, more celery seed and a bit more cayenne.  Now we're talkin!

This sauce is awesome!  I left out the celery seeds and used golden corn syrup instead of the molasses.  I found it reached a nice, thick sauce consistency after simmering for 25 minutes.

I have been looking for a great KC sauce to make at home.  This is it. The only reason I didn't give a ***** is that I like it with a little more kick, but this is great recipe. As good as advertised!

I rarely, if ever, give 5 star ratings, but good gracious does this one deserve it!! This is an excellent sauce.  I made it once and have never looked back.  I will *never* buy another bottled sauce again!!

After making this sauce a few times - it's now a staple at my house - I tweaked it -which happened by accident from my not reading the recipe correctly - and used smoked paprika instead of regular (my choice), increased the cinnamon and chili powder to 1/2 tsp.

This is definately a keeper!  GOOD LUCK!!!

The taste of the vinegar was overwhelming.  My son and I did not like this but my husband did.  Do not make unless you are a vinegar fan.

I am making this as I write in the crock pot. It is so AWESOME I couldn't wait till it was done to write my review. I am going to let it simmer all day in the crock pot and then serve it on leftover "Kalua Pig in a Slow Cooker" from this site. The only change I may have to make is to add a little more heat. As is, it is completely kid-friendly. I just wish I had doubled it so I could refrigerate the leftovers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This sauce is the BEST!  I double the spice but keep everything else the same, I also add a secret ingredient (never will tell) that really brings out the flavor and everyone compliments me on the sauce I use, this is THE BEST!  Thanks Big Al!

Very Good! I was looking for a BBQ sauce recipe I could "tweek" to suite my taste and finally found success! This is a very sweet sauce so I cut down the brown sugar to 3/4 cup instead of 1 1/4 cup. (Still very sweet) I also cut the molasses down to 1/4 cup.  I doubled the spices but CAUTION: very spicy this way and may not suite the pallet for little ones. I however love spicey so this was fantastic! Also I omitted the butter bc it didn't seem like necessary calories and did not have celery seed. This will be my new sauce for BBQ pulled pork sandwiches! Thanks for the recipe!

I think this is great; HOWEVER, I prefer a more sweet taste over the vinegar taste. I doubled the molasses, brown sugar, butter, and spices. I did 6 teaspoons of the liquid smoke. I rated it 5 stars because it was good the way it was, I just prefer a molasses base instead of a vinegar base.

An amazing sauce! Celery salt works well instead of celery seed, and I doubled the amounts for everything except the ketchup and tomato sauce, because i could taste that it had a ketchup base. Now it is molassas based and DeLiCiOuS!! :)

i've made this sauce a few times and it is great. its one of the best bbq sauces i've ever had. there have been times that i didn't have enough red wine vinegar so i also used some apple cider vinegar, i really like the flavor the apple cider vinegar adds. this sauce also keeps  well in the fridge so make the whole batch.

This is an AMAZING sauce. I make it in large quantities and jar it using the hot water bath canning method. Pint jars, process about 30 minutes (less might be fine but you can't overcook it or anything so better safe than sorry). The small amount of butter concerned me at first but it hasn't been a problem.

I have made this sauce (a dbl. batch) at least four times for our family reunions. They love it and ask for it every time we get together. I would like to visit Big Al's restaurant if this is any indication of the food he serves. I follow the recipe exactly as written. This sauce keeps very well in the refrigerator...so there's no need to worry if there's extra left.

This recipe is for lack of the perfect word GREAT. You can never make enough. I cooked for a grand opening for a little sports pub and cooked 240 lbs of chicken 20 gals of BBQ beans and 2 beef loin (flay minions)  on my grill and finished it off with this. I could not believe it. I am not a big fan of vinegar base BBQ sauce until this one it changed my mind. First time I made it was cooking for a few days you know making lunch and dinner for a couple of days. This sauce was so good the only thing that stopped me from eating all of my next couple of day meals was I was too stuffed to eat any more had to stop. I make it at a gallon at a time not expensive and seem to keep for some time in the fridge. Just fallow the recipe it’s sweet with a little bit of a vinegar tang and has a little bite at the end. But all in all OH YES this is a keeper.

All I can say is OMG! I made this today (exactly as the recipe is printed) to simmer pork ribs in, and this is the best sauce I've EVER tasted. My brother is a chef and this got his thumbs up, and he's not an easy sell! This is my go-to bbq sauce from today on. Thank you for sharing this!!

I think this is the best tomato-based non-store bought sauce.  I followed the recipe exactly and might reduce the celery seed to a 1/4 tsp next time (could be my celery seed), but after trying many, many other recipes, I find this to be the best.  No more looking for me!

We enjoyed this sauce very much!  Good balance between sweet and spicy but very easy to make sweeter or spicier as you like.  I like to make my own, no high fructose corn syrup!

Everyone who tastes this sauce wants the recipe.  Even my picky brother in law was seen pouring some into a plastic container to take home.  Now that's the ultimate compliment.

This has been the hit of our summer barbeques. I have made this four times and served over ribs and chicken. Guaranteed, this is "finger-licking" good! I hate to see summer end here in Massachusetts. I usually use barbeque sauce only in the summer but, with this recipe I might have to change my ways! I prepare this a couple of days ahead allowing flavors to blend. It also saves on prep the day of. I have altered the amount of red cayenne to 1/4 teaspoon (personal taste) otherwise, I have followed this recipe exactly and it has not failed me yet. Thanks for a great recipe. This is one of the best on this site.

AMAZING. Left this at the girlfriend's place and they ended up using it on just about everything!

This recipe makes a lot, so I ended up buy a big ketchup bottle (for the recipe), cleaned out the remaining ketchip, and used the bottle for the leftover BBQ sauce, made it easy to serve later on.

I've tried many sauce recipes, but this has the best taste ever.  Used it over pork in a slow cooker overnight, and was beyond pleased with the results.  It's rare to find a recipe that I don't need to 'tweak' to my own liking.

I've never made BBQ sauce before, however, after making this, I doubt if I would ever buy bottled again.   We all really liked it.  I did use a liitle less cayenne than the recipe called for due to our kids.  Next time, I am making extra and will freeze some.

Amazing, especially when basted onto chicken on the bbq.  I didn't have half the spices when I made it & substituted 1 1/2 tbs of Emeril's Essence & I only had a cup of red wine vinegar.  It still turned out amazing.

This was very good. Will definitely make it again. Recommended it to many people at work. I suggest buying the squeezable bottle of ketchup that equals 2 cups.  I actually had 2 cups of leftover sauce that I put back in the cleaned out squeezable ketchup bottle and had sauce all week long.  Nice and handy way to keep it.

This was really delicious and my 4th of July guests commented favorably, including annoying picky husband.  One thing that might be helpful to others - the day I made it I put in too much vinegar - I doubled the recipe and instead of the last 1/2 cup, probably put in 3/4 cup.  I tasted the sauce as it was cooking and kicked myself for being careless with the stuff as the vinegar was so pronounced.  Simmered 45 minutes, cooled and refrigerated.  Mixed it up the next day with pulled pork - and the sharp vinegar character had faded.  In fact, so much so that the intense flavors on Day 1 were quite muted on Day 2.  Both good - just different.  Hugs to Big Al!

This sauce is amazing! My little boy is allergic to fake preservatives and so I have been looking for a good BBQ Sauce to make...this is the best one I've tried! I didn't have Red Wine Vinegar so I used just plain Vinegar and it was delicous. It reminded me of Southern BBQ back home with the vinegar taste. I'm going to make it this time with the RWV and see which I like best. Thanks "Big Al" for this recipe....You Rock!

I usually use a bottled sauce (there are some good ones) just because I don't have ribs often.
But a couple of weeks ago we had a crowd over for a backyard BBQ.  I didn't want to have bottled sauce so I decided to give this a try.  It was wonderful and quite a success, everyone wanted to know the recipe and I don't hold back on recipes so I told everyone about "AllRecipes" and "Big Al's K.C. BBQ Sauce"  Thanks Alan Arthur for posting it.

I too thought this was a tad vinegary.  I will probably make this again and reduce the vinegar a bit.  Overall, very good for my second try at homemade BBQ sauce.  Much better than the first recipe I tried!

Excellent! I will only need to cut down on the cayenne pepper only because its a little on the spicier side...I will make again and use on slow cooker meats like pork, chicken and beef.

I usually buy Kraft Honey Hickory but I like this much better.  Boyfriend raved about it but would like it hotter next time...to me it was just right.  It is sweet and tangy with a little peppery heat.  It's also a perfect consistancy.  No more bottled barbeque sauce in this house again!  Thanks!

I normally don't write reviews, but this I had to take the time to do so for this recipe. This is hands down the BEST BBQ sauce I have ever tasted. My husband was eating it with a spoon. The only change we made was doubling the cayenne for a bit more bite. We made a rack of beef ribs; they were killer thanks to this sauce.

Other than scaling this by a quarter to only make 12 servings I followed the recipe to a *T*

It is EXACTLY what I was looking for to accompany my slow cooked BBQ smoked pulled pork... delicious!

Thanks for a winning recipe, it has been added to my permanent recipe book file

This is, hands down, the BEST BBQ sauce I've ever had, (and I'm a BBQ lover, so believe me - I've tried a lot of BBQ sauces)!  If KC style sauce is your thing, then this is your sauce.

Wow, is this sauce good.  I didn't realize the recipe made so much.  I guess I will freeze the rest.  I didn't add liquid smoke as our family hates that "fake" taste.  Other than that I followed the recipe to a T and we all loved it.

I love this recipe! It's great for pulled pork sandwiches, meatballs, chicken strips and great to drizzle over a simple grilled chicken breast. I follow the recipe word for word and it has never failed me. I do, however, forget to add the butter each time but it seems to  be okay without it. This is only BBQ sauce I ever make!

My husband and I love this recipe.  I don't even buy store bought anymore.  The second use and beyond are the best.  By then, the flavors have really blended.

The sauce was good but a little runny. I had to cook it so long to thicken it it became bitter.

This BBQ sauce is delicious!  I made it to use as a condiment for pulled pork sandwiches that I had prepared using a spice rub.  Everyone loved it.  It is so much better than common store bought sauce.  There is a place for convenience, of course, but given just a little bit of time, you can make this with very little effort.  I always check reviews before I make somehting from AR.  As of today, this recipe has been reviewed 581 times with an average 5-star review.  2/1-star reviews, zero 2-star reviews, 16/3-star reviews and 563 4 or 5-star reviews!!  The reviewers that gave this recipe 1 and 3 star reviews said most often they thought it was either too sweet or too vinegary  . . . . . makes me wonder if they really know what Kansas City BBQ Sauce is supposed to taste like!!

Truly exceptional barbeque sauce!!  My decision to make it was very last minutes, so I was restriced to ingredients on hand which meant a couple of changes had to be made.  The first change was nothing more than using celery powder instead of seed, as I was out.  The second change was a bit more significant.  I don't keep molasses on hand, but I do keep honey so I used that.  Because I know the molasses would lend a great depth of flavor that honey can't touch, I added 1/2 cup of really strong brewed coffee (to the recipe I halved) and it was wonderful, although I did simmer it about an hour to cook down the extra liquid the coffee added.  I look forward to making it with the molasses as called for.  Thank you for a beautiful recipe!

I used this sauce on ribs, I baked the ribs in the oven for 2 1/2 hours at 300 then threw them on the grill and basted them on low heat for 30 minutes.  They were to die for, better than most restaurants I've gone to!  I'm going to try this sauce on pork chops on the grill tonight.

FAST. EASY. INEXPENSIVE. DELICIOUS. No slicing, dicing, straining, etc.  Had everything on hand.  BETTER THAN STORE BOUGHT taste.  Thanks so much for sharing!  (I left out the smoke for family tastebuds and still won't buy another bottle again)

Qiurky as it may be I often begin to write a review before I have even start to make a recipe. This one I began by giving it glowing accolades then got a bit concerned I would have to edit. I wanted some good homemade sauce for my pulled pork sandwiches. Amazingly, even down to the coarsely ground black pepper, I had all the ingredients and made this EXACTLY as written. I opted to do the cooking/simmering in my microwave, stirring every few minutes until it thickened like I wanted. Tasting this sauce as you cook it is not sweet; it’s very, very tangy. Beware, this stuff is clear your sinuses vinegary tangy! But don't be too quick to judge (don't submit a premature review!) until you actually put it on the meat. My pulled pork sandwiches were great and I'll make this again. The vinegar mellows out considerably.

I'm trying to put my finger on this one...

When I made it the night before, it had a TON of flavor, you could taste all the spices in it right as I finished cooking it and was bottling it to sit in the fridge overnight.  When I took it out today and was serving it, it was missing a lot of that flavor that I tasted last night when I cooked it.  Last night, it had all the sweetness and flavor you're looking in a good BBQ sauce, and then when you least expected it, it kicked you.  Today, it missed a lot of that flavor.  Don't know why, but it did...  I'll have to try it again and see what happened (or didn't happen).

Love this recipe!  I made it exactly as directed and can't find a flaw in it.  The flavors and thickness definately increase the longer it simmers and I let it go for a good long time.  It was superb on pulled pork and my son insisted it tastes almost exactly like Sweet Baby Rays.  The recipe as written makes about a quart and a half of sauce.  Not realizing that, I doubled it and ended up with 3 quarts.  No worries though...just put in quart jars and refrigerated for later use.

This is currently my "go to" BBQ sauce. It is VERY good on ribs. I haven't tried it with the hickory liquid smoke yet because my local store only carries the mesquite flavor so I simply do without..

I thought this was pretty good bbq sauce. I will definitely make it when I need bbq sauce for recipes. I made 12 servings instead of the 48. I used all of the ingredients but the liquid smoke. I may try that next time, just to see the difference. I made it for chicken, but would like to try it with some pulled pork. What is good about this bbq sauce is it is both vinegary yet sweet at the same time. So, I think it would suit many people's taste. Thank you, for the recipe, Al.
Edit Note: Made again for ribs. Made 12 servings again for 2 racks. Used 3/4 tsp of liquid smoke, 1/8 tsp of black pepper, left out the cayenne, and replaced the molasses with honey. A very forgiving recipe! Next attempt will be on burgers or chicken on the grill.

At first I thought this had too many ingredients and I wouldn't be able to find them all, but I did. I made this for the 4th of July. EVERYONE loved it! This is the best sauce I have ever tasted, hands down. My only regret is that I didn't make enough.

For me, this is a five star recipe if you halve the vinegar and double the garlic, onion and chili powders, paprika, and celery seed.  This is my go-to BBQ sauce recipe and I get complimented on it all the time!

We ran out of our regular bottled sauce & had chicken on the grill! What to do but find this 5-Star recipe on AR. It's wonderful & DH said "what brand is this?" LOL  Did not have the molasses, so added extra brown sugar & 1 TB syrup and used enough to baste the chicken.  Simmered the rest for an hour or so & made it even better. Thanks Al!!!

BEST SAUCE EVER!  The bad news is there is no more using store bought sauce to save time.  After having this sauce it is the only one we use.  I use this BBQ sauce for everything, chicken, beef, in recipes-everything!  I have had a friend of the family trying to bribe me for 2 years now to give him my recipe!!  I just tell him it is top secret!!  I make this sauce exactly according to the directions no alterations and I think it is perfect every time!

AMAZING! I made this along with a Memphis style sauce to give my folks some variety. It did come out a bit darker than any of the pictures and I followed the recipe to a T. We all loved it!

I love to grill so I wanted to find a really good sauce. I was a bit intimidated by the number of ingrediants, but it was worth it. This sauce is really tasty! Scott Myhervold Anthem Az

This sauce has a little bit of a tangy taste and I love it. People are always impressed when they find I make my own BBQ sauce.

I'm from Germany and have to buy bottled barbeque sauces. My favourite is KC Masterpiece. It costs about 8 Euro or about 10 Dollars for a small bottle. BUT NOT ANYMORE!!! I Love this recipe!!! I made one batch exactly like it says and one without black pepper and chili powder and used ground red chipotle powder!!! Awesome!!!!

Very good! It was just a tad too sweet...next time I'll reduce the brown sugar maybe by 1/2.  Didn't use liquid smoke because I didn't have any. Also reduced the amount of cayenne and black pepper by half so my 4yo would like it.
Update:  Reduced sugar by 1/2 and was still too sweet.  Need to reduce further.

I'm not big on BBQ sauce because it's so sweet, but making a homemade one made it fun and more flavorful. This is sweet, but everyone liked it. I didn't get to use cayenne pepper so I used crushed red pepper instead which went will since I added it to shredded chicken for bbq chicken sandwiches. I also used the restaurant style cole slaw recipe from this website and it went well on the sandwiches. Tasty!

An outstanding BBQ sauce. I don't own molasses, so I didn't include it. I was planning on substituting more brown sugar, but it actually didn't need it. It tasted great as was.

Okay, I am now a store bought BBQ Sauce convert... NEVER AGAIN! I just used this in a pinch this morning; while cooking a dish for a pot luck tonight, I realized I was out of BBQ sauce that the recipe required. Not wanting to go to the store, I got on line and found this. What a stroke of luck for me! I followed it exactly as written and WOW...it is AMAZING! It's no wonder so many people left great reviews for this one... and 5 stars is not nearly enough in my opinion. I've always been a fan of the "Open Pit" brand, but I doubt I'll ever buy it again. This was easy to throw together and extremely delicious! Kudos to "Big Al" for sharing!

Yum! This was a wonderful sauce! I didn't have onion powder, but it still turned out delicious. After I cooked the sauce, I poured about half the sauce over half a dozen chicken breasts in the crock pot for 6 hours, then shredded the meat and returned it back to the crock pot for 2 hours to make some amazing chicken sandwiches!!!!!

FANTASTIC recipe!! I am a caterer, and this is one i will definately do again!! 
Thanks for the recipe Al!
** updated review **'
after making this again, i found a few tweaks that make it better.  As i make my own ketchup, and had a huge pot of it, i used all ketchup for the 4 cups.  increased the garlic and onion powders to 1 tsp, and cut the liquid smoke back to 1 tsp.  I simmered for a very long time, probably an hour and a half and that made a world of difference in the consistency.  it's excellent.

Wow this stuff is amazing and super easy to make. I decreased the servings to 6 and added about a tbsp of grated red onion. Subbed fresh garlic for the powder and honey for the molasses. Also used all ketchup.  Served with BBQ chicken burgers from Annie's Eat's blog. Thanks for the wonderful recipe:)

Awesome BBQ Sauce. This is one of the best home made sauces I have found. I would recommend cooking for a minimum of 30 minutes and let it sit overnight in the refrigerator. It is better the next day after the flavors have blended. Thanks again for submitting this great BBQ Sauce Recipe!

Great sauce, but it was a bit too sweet for our taste so next time i'll cut that down a bit on the brown sugar.  But this is now going to my favorite bbq sauce from now one.

I made this exactly according to the recipe.  Next time, I will use 4 cups of ketchup instead of 2 cups ketchup and 2 cups tomato sauce.  The tomato sauce makes it separate and gives it an off taste.  I will also add a couple dashes of tabasco sauce.

Certainly a 5 out of 5.  I've used this recipe several times and also in my slow cooker recipes and ALWAYS get rave reviews.  Will sometimes add extra molasses to taste but this recipe is delicious just the way it is.

Great sauce....scaled down to 12 servings and poured over a boneless pork loin roast that I put in the crockpot and shredded for "pulled pork". served with coleslaw and on onion rolls. Delicious sauce that I actually made the night before and refrigerated to make my work morning super easy. Thanks for a yummy bbq sauce!

Perfect!  I live in Pennsylvania and this may be the best BBQ sauce I have ever had.  I followed the directions exactly and mixed it with a pulled pork recipe I found on here.  Wow - perfect pork BBQ.

Absolute delicious. My husband puts this sauce on his ribs and pulled pork/chicken and ALWAYS gets compliments and shocked faces when he tells our guests it's homemade. We've made it a few times and feel it's better without the celery see but that's just our personal taste! Also, we omitted all sugar and used orange pop but that's just our random thing lol. DEFINITELY worth a shot!!

It's hard for me to rate this because I don't keep ketchup or liquid smoke in the house (therefore I gave the recipe a 5 stars instead of a 4). I used tomato sauce and tomato paste instead of ketchup (I didn't want to buy ketchup just for the recipe as commercial ketchups usually contain high fructose corn syrup). I used less molasses because I ran out, but it was still very apparent in tasting it. Next time I will even use less brown sugar, too. Thanks for the recipe, Alan! I will be able to feed my husband this instead of the artificial kinds in the stores. :o)

This tasted just like the real thing! I live in Memphis, a hub of barbeque, so that's saying something! This made quite a bit of sauce, but I froze the leftovers for later use. Very flavorful, perfect texture, spread easily and was absorbed by my pulled pork. My husband and I finished off eight sandwiches. He couldn't get over just how much it tasted like your local barbeque joint.

This sauce was great, I used it over ribs in the slow cooker and they came out amazing.  The sauce has a great balance of spicy and sweet.  I didn't have molasses so I used honey which still tasted great.

I started using this sauce for ribs this summer and enjoyed it. I used it again as a base and started tweaking it by adding a few other flavours that has now become a sauce my friends and family ask for all the time. Thanks for sharing!!

I don't know why...but, I had to tweak it. I only made 1/2 the recipe as stated. I added 1 tablespoon worchestershire sauce and 3 dashes of tabasco. It was awesome.

Oh, wow, this was FABULOUS!  I made this exactly as written for our Memorial Day BBQ, and we scarfed up every bite and licked our fingers afterwards.  My husband told me to be absolutely SURE to save this recipe!!  Be warned--it makes A LOT.  I actually split our batch in half and froze part of it to use later.  THANK YOU for the awesome recipe!!

WOW!  If you change the serving size to 18 you can use up one 8oz can of tomato sauce and you end up with about 2 cups of BBQ sauce.

This is the best Bar-B-Q.. I try to make recipes as listed for the first time so I can properly review them but I did not have the hickory-flavored liquid smoke and cerely seeds on hand, so I elminated them all together. I also only use Splenda sugars when I cook. I cut the original called for sugar in half and use splenda in place of. Even with these changes, I loved the sauce. I made some extra and kept it in the fridge for later use. I have so far used this sauce on Ribs, Chicken drumsticks and was used on Cheese burgers.  *Added note*  I have used this recipe many times now and have since added some things for personal taste I thought I would share.(I cut the recipe to 24) I now add 1/8 tsp. of whatever hot sauce we have on hand. 1/4 tsp. of worcestershire sauce and 2 tablespoons pure honey. I still have not tried this with the missing ingredients (smoke or celery seeds) I can't imagine it any better, I crave this sauce, its perfect...9/06/10 I have tried all barbeque sauces on this sight now and I believe this one is the best. I have made this with all ingredients including the smoke and celery seeds now and feel the liquid smoke did improve on the taste. I have also thickened with a little cornstarch mixed in water and poor into sauce near the end of the simmer. . I will continue to use this recipe. I have not bought bbq at the store since I discovered this recipe.Thank you for sharing this recipe

If there were six stars, this recipe would get it!  The perfect blend of flavors for a barbeque sauce.  Many levels of flavor, including smokey, sweet, spicy...just perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly as it says and loved it!

I first made this recipe following the directions but only adding the red wine vinegar to taste in the end because I only had about 1/4 cup on hand.  I added about two tablespoons of it.  It was really great. Although I can see why more would also be good.  Sweet with a hint of smoky flavor.  After I had tasted it this way I made a few modifications:  corn syrup to make it smoother - 1/4 cup, honey to give it another layer of depth - 1/4 cup, and about 1/4 cup rum - cuz my husband likes that.  I did cut back on the cayenne because my variety rates extremely high on the skoville scale - something to keep in mind.  Both ways are fantastice.  I used it with smoked country style ribs.  If you enjoy sweet bbq sauce you will enjoy this.

This was just okay, I felt it lacked in spices though it did not have that "wow" factor that I expected due to all the great reviews on it, I might give it a try again omitting the garlic powder (which I hate using anyway, I prefer fresh garlic) and saute onion and fresh garlic before adding in the other ingredients, also I would increase the brown sugar slightly and decrease the vinegar which is way too overpowering in this recipe and adjust the spices also, all in all it's a good basic recipe but nothing to get excited about, don't know if I would bother making it again though, it needs too much adjusting.

This is my permenant replacement for store bought bbq sauce.  I love the consistency and the taste.  I use it on just about everything and my wife sais she could drink it for dinner!

After the first time I used it, I halfed the amount of red wine vinegar, and doubled the amount of cayenne and black pepper.  

Thanks for the recipe!

This is perfect for my pulled pork sandwich recipe.  Once I shred the meat, I add this sauce to the slow cooker for fantastic barbeque flavor!

For those of you out there that don't want to use Liquid smoke because it tastes artificial. Here is what I did. I have an old kettle charcoal grill. I had some Applewood Chunks left over from a Pork Butt that I made a few weeks ago, so I decided to try something different. Instead of cooking this sauce down on the stove I decided to fire up the grill and light up a few chunks of Applewood. Put the sauce in my cast iron dutch oven and put the cover on my kettle. I then smoked the sauce while it simmered down. It came out perfect. No artificial flavor. The applewood creates an awesome flavor to this sauce.

A bit too tangy. Will have to cut back on vinegar by the extra 1/4 cup and see if that helps. I had to double the garlic and onion and chili powder.

Very good sauce! A little bit sweeter than I like, so next time I'll cut the sugar in half, but definitely a keeper.

Fantastic recipe! Made it to a "T" except I cut back on the cayenne to 1/4 tsp.  We had pulled pork tonight with this homemade BBQ sauce on homemade bread.  SCRUMPTIOUS!  All 3 of my kids (10 and younger) scarfed it down!

The recipe made plenty and I have 1/2 a pot left over.  I couldn't be happier.  I'll put in in a moson jar in the fridge and save it for another day.

I LOOOOOVE THIS RECIPE!!!!!  All my family and friends consider me the Best Cook they've ever known and they always rave over my food. So, I know a good recipe when I see one.  I have made this BBQ Sauce a few times for my family and we love it.  I recently made this recipe (doubled) for SuperBowl and it was a hit!!! Everyone kept complimenting me on the ribs and couldn't stop licking their fingers.  The ingredients are a perfect combination of sweetness with a touch of spiciness that's not too overwhelming. Some asked if they could take extra food home because it was so good.  I brought leftovers to work and I received more compliments.  I made this recipe as is and it was PERFECT!  This is a keeper in my house.  Thanks again Big Al for sharing such a tasty, delicious , finger-licking good recipe.:)!

Living in Sweden, it is difficult to get molasses and celery seeds, but I used dark treacle and just omitted the celery seeds. I added a bit more cinnamon than was in the recipe, but the end result was wonderful. I cooked it till it thickened and we have used it for ribs and chicken. I even tried it on a cheese sandwich- lovely! This is now a family favourite! Thanks for sharing!

Most excellent sauce!!  I didn't have celery seed, so I finely diced a T of celery and it was sooooo fantastic!  I let mine simmer for a while longer to make it thicker.  This recipe is SUCH a keeper, my husband thinks I hung the moon!  Sweet, tangy, a touch of spice and smokey flavor...just perfect!!

Excellent! Since I have someone who is sensitive to liquid smoke, I substituted 2 grownd, dried chipotle peppers, less stems for the smoke.  I also used a purreed tomatoes for paste and cooked it for an additional 20 mins.  The result was magnificent.  Bravo!

I never ate better Bar-B-Q sauce!

It's becoming a family classic. I double up on the spices to give more kick and let it simmer low on the stove for a few hours.

Loved this sauce!  Made as stated except I subbed pure maple syrup for molasses as I didn't have any.  Whole family loved this.

I halved the sugar and molasses and it was plenty sweet, will use 1/4 next time. I swapped out 1/8 cup vinegar for Worchestire sauce, added a heaping tbsp of minced garlic, a bay leaf and some tomato paste while simmering.

Excellent! As good as any we've bought at the store. I thought it tastes similar to Bone Suckin' Sauce. Tastes better after it's been in the fridge for a while.

Holy smokes I'm dancing a jig. This stuff is AMAZING! Wooo Hooooo- no more bottled chemical filled, corn syrup'd bbq sauce from the store! I followed recipe exactly with one exception-didn't use as much cayenne but it was still smokin' hot! I think the next time I will use still less cayenne as I have little ones at home and it was a tad hot for them but they said the flavor was 'delious! Thanks a million!

This barbeque sauce was very tasty. I cut the recipe in half and it made a pint sized jar.  I inadvertedly used the regular amount of molasses instead of 1/2 and it was still very good. It was a sweet sauce which put me in the mind of Sweet Baby Rays - my adding to much molasses may have contributed to the sweetness. Delicious on both barbeque ribs and chicken. I will be making this again.

Made this for gifts and it was a HUGE success. I made exactly as directed and see no need for changes. It's delicious as is. I have had many requests for the recipe and my brother-in-law, who loves to cook and make his own recipes, is still raving about it 6mos later. Will make this again, and again, and again! Thank you so much for sharing this!

This is by far the BEST bbq sauce we have tried! I am usually the cook in my family, but my husband wanted to try making his own bbq sauce. I must admit I was skeptical at first, but after he made it, I loved it!! This is the 2nd summer we are going to be using it for our cookouts and everyone who tries it loves it!!

Pretty sure I could just eat this with a spoon!  SO good.  I typically like a more "vinegary" sauce, like Arthur Bryant's (For those in KC) but this is fantastic!  Sweet, but not too sweet.  Thank you, Alan!

I only had 1 can of tomato sauce so I added 6 oz of tomato paste with 6 oz of water.  Made the sauce richer in flavor than just using tomato sauce.

I liked the sauce, but it was very, very sweet.  It goes well with more bland, low-fat meat like chicken or pork.  I think it's too sweet for beef.  Also, I thought the red wine vinegar gave it kind of a weird tang.  That might just be personal preference.  I think next time I'll use apple cider vinegar and a little bit less sugar.

I usually make my own BBQ sauce, but came across this one and decided to try it since it is similiar to the one I make.  It is delicious! I added some crushed red pepper flakes because I like it a tad on the spicey side. In my own sauce, I add coffee.  I think I missed that layer of flavor in this recipe, but this was so good.

Is it okay to say I am in love with a recipe? I have been wanting to make this since December and finally took the challenge today. I love BBQ sauce and this stuff is AMAZING. It tasted really, really great as it was, but I figured that since it was so inexpensive to make, I would just add a little more cayenne. And a little more. And a little more. And I added a few crushed red pepper flakes. And I added a few tablespoons of yellow mustard to boot! Now the stuff REALLY has a little kick to it - and I LOVE it. I have been tasting it on crackers and I have no room for dinner. I can't wait to BBQ some chicken on the grill and baste it with this! Or smoke some pork...or a brisket...I am completely in love. Big Al, you are my hero! THANK YOU!

Absolutely delicious!!!  Easy to make!  I doubled the recipe and gave small bottles to my friends.  I cooked it longer as I like a thicker sauce.  Slow cooking longer gives exellent flavour!!! A definate Keeper!!

This is good. Just like anything in life it is definitely advised to make to taste. I.e I decreased the tomato sauce by 1/2 and for extra spice kept adding a pinch of cayenne pepper until it was hot enough for me. Great recipe.

I was looking for a sauce that would taste like our favorite pizza place's BBQ chicken pizza.  This turned out fantastic.  It is a little sweet, but the extra kick added by the extra ingredients makes it outstanding.  I just added a couple teaspoons of worcestershire sauce.  My family requests that I make it again.

I liked the recipe overall.  I found that the liquid smoke was a little too strong, I would reduce it a bit.  I added some hot chili sauce for a little more hotness.  Other than that, it was great, I used it in one of the crock-pot rib recipes instead of using straight BBQ Sauce which made it better.

This is really good.  Iv'e made it twice now. I make my own red wine vinegar though as I never have it on hand (red wine and apple cider vinegar.)  I had to make my own tomato sauce also the first time I made it.  It is a fabulous sauce!

Great sauce! I made HUGH batch (192 oz.). I changed up a few things, I replaced the tomato sauce with 1- 8 oz. can tomato paste, replaced liquid smoke with 2 tablespoons each ground cumin, paprika. I cut the vinegar by 1/4 cup and increased the brown sugar by 1/4. I then simmered it for 2 hours (I had the time) and it was used that night on ribs and chicken. My family LOVED IT!!!! I filled a 64 oz. ketchup bottle for the fridge and canned the rest, 2 qt. jars, 1 pt. jar. Love how you taste the sweet, then the vinegar then comes then mild heat. One of if not the best sauces I've had.

This sauce is absolutely delicious. I used it for some pork ribs I was preparing, and it just completed the dish. I think I just cried a little. Yes it is that good....

Love it!  Can't believe I made it so quickly and that it was soooo good.  I halved the recipe in my head and miscalculated the brown sugar by adding 2 extra T's but it was still really really great!  Thanks for the great recipe Al!

If there were more stars, I'd give this sauce recipe more stars! I did add just a few drops of Tabasco Sauce to give it a tiny bit more zing, but other than that, used the recipe as is.  It's an incredible rib and chicken sauce.

This sauce was really good! I was missing 2 ingredients the liquid smoke and celery seed but it still came out finger-licking good. When I make it next time because I will be making this again, I will be using the missed ingredients. This is my new go to sauce for summer BBQ's. Thanks Al!!!!

Fantastic. Did not even have all the ingredients. Used diced tomatoes puréed for the tomato sauce, did not have celery seed, and had Spanish paprika. Amazing. Added to slow cooker pulled pork. I know I will not be needing bottled barbecue sauce again. Thanks!

This stuff is amazing! Our ribs arent even done yet but my 6-year-old daughter keeps eating this sauce right out of the pan with a spoon. Used all the spices listed in given quantities, and it's not too spicy for her at all.

I have been using this sauce for months now. I use Hugh's Dry Rub from this sight, and Big Al"s K.C. sauce. My family can not get enough of this stuff! This makes the best bbq chicken that I have ever ate! Thank-you so much for sharing!

First time with recipe. wondered about the process, read a pile of great reviews. This is simply fantastic, family loved it. I pressed garlic into roast, rubbed with olive oil, covered with Montreal steak seasoning then refrigerated for couple of hours ( over night would be better). I carmalized onions with garlic butter and a glug of white wine, also deglazed this pan. Added onions,beef broth, and garlic cloves to bottom of roasting pan. Next time I will add carrots also.

This recipe makes enough sauce for at least a dozen big meaty ribs, more if you don't drench the ribs in the sauce. I left out the Hickory liquid smoke because I do not like the flavor of it at all.  I really liked the end result, it was perfectly spicey and gloppy:).  We do not care for overly sweet tasting BBQ sauces...this recipe was just right.

This was OK as stated, but I feel like there are almost no spices to go with the sauce.  Plus the sauce is overwhelmingly sweet.  I wish I'd left out the molasses.  I added a lot of chili powder and a good whack of cayenne because I don't know where else this supposed "bite" comes from.  It certainly isn't in the originally-prescribed half teaspoon.  I'll be trying another recipe next time

This is beyond good!!  I will never make anything with any other BBQ sauce again.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  The first time I made it I didn't have enough molasses so I added maple syrup instead.  It worked just fine but it is better with the molasses in my opinion.  I have also substituted apple cider vinegar and balsamic vinegar mixed for the red wine vinegar.  It worked fine that way too.

While I was adding all the spices, I was concerned that they would be too overwhelming but boy was I wrong! I followed this recipe exactly (only halving the portions) and the product was a deliciously spicy sauce with a hint of sweetness. The spice wasn't tongue numbing, either, like I thought it would be. The flavor exploded in every bite and had such great depth! Store-bought BBQ sauce is just plain flat. I will never buy BBQ sauce again!

This is a great bbq sauce.  Have never found a bottled one I loved, even though there are plenty of acceptable ones on the market, so I'm delighted to have this recipe because I love it and so does my hard-to-please family. The only change I had to make, because I never keep molasses in the house, is that I substituted that ingredient with honey and some maple syrup.  Used the same amount, just combined the two.  Thank you, Alan, for sharing this recipe! P.S. I think its flavors are even better after a day or 2 in the frig.

EXCELLENT!! For those of you who find it too spicy, did you reduce the recipe? The spice reduction doesn't give less than 1/8 teaspoon.
I just realized I forgot the vinegar. It's still excellent.

FAN-FREAKIN'-TASTIC!!  Absolutely delicious sauce paired with the Slow Cooker Pulled Pork (w/root beer) from this site!  Made a 5 lb. pork shoulder, shredded it and added the sauce, cooking in the crock for an add'l 1.5 hours.  Received RAVES all around!!  Only "sub" I did was cider vinegar instead of red wine vinegar (it's what I had on hand).  Thank you for helping to make my first homemade bbq sauce attempt a HUGE success, Al!!

Fantastic BBQ that is to die for on ribs or chicken. I liked the consistency and since I did not have any red wine vinegar, I used apple cider and a combination of honey, molasses, and maple sugar as I did not have enough of each to equal the 1 cup for a doubled recipe. I omitted the cinnamon and the cayenne, since we do not like either in our BBQ sauce and when it was thick, I canned it in quart mason jars for 30 minutes. Yummo!

This was nothing short of incredible.  I was out of molasses, so I replaced it with pure maple syrup.  My husband said it was better than any BBQ sauce he's ever had - it made a lot and he put it on lots of other things for the next week.

I love this recipe! I use apple cider vinegar instead of the red wine vinegar, but it's good either way. Also my family likes things HOT so I add a ton of sriracha hot sauce. The hickory sweetness with the spicy and the thick consistency is PERFECT.

I've been using this site for recipes for a long time but have never joined. I signed up today, just to leave you a fabulous review for this barbecue sauce. It's amazing! We had a large family barbecue last weekend and I made this for barbecuing hamburgers AND chicken...its was AMAZING ON BOTH. We love this recipes and my husband has requested we make lots in advance and can it for later use. This will be a staple in our house thank you for sharing this!

This is the best bbq sauce! I have never added liquid smoke because I don't have it; it's fantastic! You can also make it with as much or as little heat as you like. It's delicious. I could almost drink it.

Instead of using garlic powder and onion powder, I sauteed half a sweet onion and a good amount of garlic in the butter called for in this recipe. I made no other changes. Half of the recipe was just enough for what I needed. Pretty basic sauce. The simmering is a necessity.

I was really disappointed with this sauce after reading all of the raving reviews. It was really pretty bland.

I added 1 tsp. of cayenne and simmered it for 3 hours and it finally thickened up and had a much better flavor.

I made the sauce exactly by recipe. In my opinion the sauce is too sweet and my wife thought it taste too much like Tomato sauce even though the spices were added exactly and simered for 30 minutes. If you like a very tomato, slight bight, you'll like it, but my opinion is that it is a very much a beginner type sauce. I did like the flavor from the cinnamon.

Superb!  The butter is not necessary at all.  Everything else is perfect.  Don't leave out the liquid smoke, it is a dominant flavour in the sauce.

this is the best sauce ever!!!!! i use it for ribs. I rub down ribs with Grill Mates pork rub and brown sugar, and then pour honey over them.  I leave them in the oven for 2 hours at 220 degrees.  I take them out, poor the sauce all over them and stick them on the grill till they are sticky/tacky...the BEST RIBS EVER...

This Sauce is amazing.  I think it would make an excellent glaze on a steak that was tenderized and seasoned only with salt and pepper and seared.  Glaze it the last minute on the grill and you are golden.  This would also go amazing with ribs.  This is the perfect sauce for drizzling a full rack of ribs in.  I want to explain how this sauce tastes.  First you get an explosion of sweet - the molasses comes through, but it is not strong and hints of brown sugar.  Then you get a bit of zest - the chili pepper, cheyenne pepper, and the pepper itself.  The sauce then gets into a somewhat vegetable flavor - you can taste the onion and garlic (but its not strong, its very subtle), but I think that the celery comes through a little bit stronger (which is good).  It lastly finishes back with a little sweetness and a hint of heat which I love.  This is the perfect blend of sauce, and it will be the only sauce I ever use on any meats.  I would put this on burgers, its that good.  Shoot, I would drizzle a little a some pizza.  I can't rave enough about this sauce.  It is amazing.  Try it.  You probably have most of the ingredients anyway, and you make quite a bit.  Seems like about 5 - 6 cups when finished, and should last quite a while if you use it sparingly - though it will disapear in my apartment as I love it.  I am going to use it on jerky.  I bet, a shot of a high quality single malt or a very good bourbon (stay away from lower quality stuff).  It is just so good.  I really, can'

This was wonderful.  I always make my own ketchup & tomato sauce, so used those in this.  I omitted the liquid smoke & used ACV in place of the red wine vinegar -- otherwise kept straight to the recipe.  This is a much-needed alternative to store-bought.  Thank you!

This is the perfect bbq sauce. At first I thought it smelled too vinegary, but it ended up just right. I used it with the Slow Cooker Texas Pulled Pork recipe (the one that calls for root beer and bbq sauce) and Belle's hamburger buns. The color of the sauce is superb, the flavor tangy and sweet.

I'm from the K.C. area & when it comes to Bar-B-Que we can claim a lot of bragging rights. We have many competitions during the year & of all the sauces I've tried this is the best. Make this recipe, don't change a thing, & you and your guests will be delighted.

I do wish I could give this more stars...I made it for some old fashion finger licking good baby back ribs and I was sooooo not disappointed.  I froze my leftover sauce and used it on grilled chicken, I think it was even better the second time!

This was so good!  The only thing I did different was omit the celery seed since I didn't have any.  I will never buy another bottle of BBQ sauce at the store!  My Dad loved it and he's a huge BBQ sauce lover.

One of the BEST homemade bbq sauces I've ever tasted, let alone made. I cut the recipe in 1/2 and it still made approx. 2 1/2 cups of sauce. Simmered it for about 1/2 hour after it reached it's initial boil. Plus, it's made with ingredients most people would normally have in their pantry, so there's no reason to not make it and impress your guests. The cinnamon was a nice touch. Big props to Big Al.

I have tried just about every bottled sauce out there and a few of the recipes here and I always come back to this. It has just the right tang to it and is not overly sweet with a little kick to it. I use it with Jay's pizza crust to make a BBQ chicken pizza that puts California pizza to shame. Use the herb crusted chicken recipe and fry it in a pan instead and use Al's sauce and top with red onionsand monterey and mozzerlla cheese and MMMMMMMMMM!!!!

Wow.  This recipe is incredible.  I used it on baby back ribs, and it was delicious! I will never, ever buy barbecue sauce again.  The depth of flavor is perfect.  Thanks, Al!

Excellent Sauce!  Works well as a chicken breast marinade/sauce while grilling as well as an excellent mop (if diluted) for ribs!  Thanks, Big Al!

Excellent basic recipe to play off.   I made some changes.  Had no tomato sauce in the house, so used Spicy V8 instead.  Changed the red vinegar to about half the amount of balsamic vinegar.   Added a teaspoon of instant coffee crystals, and 1/2 teaspoon of allspice.   Yummy!!!!

Good sauce, but my family didn't like the cinnamon, they thought it was too strong.  Next time I think I'll use a little less of it and we should be good to go!

I tried local ribs and was looking for a great sauce similar to what they used.  This is it, actually better.  Smooth texture, all the important flavors.  A great base to make it your own - hotter, sweeter what ever you like.  Very easy.

This was great! I realized much too late that I didn't have any bbq sauce so I'm so glad this didn't take all day to make. It was very easy to do. I didn't have any tomato sauce so I substituted 1 small can tomato paste and 1 cup water. (I only make 1/2 recipe) I also didn't have cayenne pepper or celery seed but it still came out great! Thanks Alan!

This is the BEST BBQ SAUCE ever.  Something about it is addictive and you will find yourself craving it.  I always keep it in my fridge.  Awesome on burgers, brisket, chicken & ribs.  It does have a lot of ingredients but it's well worth it...

I make this in a crock pot and three different levels of heat. It thickens overnight while cooking in the crockpot. I must warn you that you may wake up hungry in the middle of the night because it smells so good!Then I can it in jars and give away as Christmas gifts. Been doing this for several years.

Made this tonight, delicious! I did make a few very minor adjustments to accommodate our taste.  I slightly decreased the cayenne powder, black pepper and the salt. I didn't have enough red wine vinegar so I used about 3/4 cup red wine vinegar and topped it off with white vinegar. I didn't add the amount suggested in the recipe though, I like more sweet than tangy as far as sauce goes. I also added a few teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce, about 1 1/2 tablespoons of regular yellow mustard, 1/4 cup more brown sugar and 1/4 cup of honey. I thought the flavor was mediocre before my adjustments,and was too tart for our taste. There wasn't any ingredient that I left out, I just added. After my changes this recipe was OUTSTANDING!!! Will save this one and make a lot this summer!

Oh my! My husband and I just made this for dinner tonight and used on pulled pork. Absolutely the best pulled pork we've ever eaten. We followed the recipe with only 1 substitution, used coconut sugar instead of brown. All spices etc. were just right amounts. So delicious! Thank you for this amazing barbecue sauce recipe!Highly recommend, it doesn't get better than this.

Woo hoo! Right at the top of best sweet and moderately spicy BBQ sauces. Subbed balsamic vinegar for red wine vinegar but otherwise made as written. This sauce was used in the Kansas City Style Pork Back Ribs recipe from this site, and it was a marriage made in heaven.

Excellent sauce.  I used this for a recent rib off and everyone loved the sauce.  This will be a staple in my fridge.  I can't wait to try it on some pulled pork or chicken!  Thanks for the recipe.  It's a keeper!

We love this sauce for its smoky flavor and thickness!  I usually don't even cook it--just mix the ingredients together and brush it on meat on the grill or ribs in the oven.  Lots of ingredients, but worth it!

This was awesome!! I made a brisket today and ran to the store to pick up some ingredients. I ran threw the store picking up random spices and a few other things. I came home a did a quick search and this recipe came up. Having  almost 900 ratings, I had to try it. While I did not have all the necessary ingredients I left out the cayenne and celery seed's. I did not have red wine vinegar so I used cider vinegar. I drenched my freshly cooked brisket sandwich and boy was it good. This is my first review after browsing for a few years! Thank you for sharing.

I've been making your recipe for over a year (or so I thought) For some unknown reason, I decided to look it up instead of using my cookbook that I have it written down on. Just realized I had never written down the red wine vinegar and have been making it without all this time. My son-in-law thinks I'm the bomb the way I've been fixing it! I'll add it this time and see if he notices :)

This bbq sauce is AWESOME!!! It tastes especially nice on chicken and ribs. I don't love it on steak, but that's just me. I will make this sauce again and again! The recipe makes quite a bit, so I just poor what I don't use into ziplock containers and put them in the freezer and just take one out and thaw it when I want to bbq again! YUM! BEST SAUCE EVER!

I love this recipe but had to substitute honey for the molasses.  I left out the celery seed as I didn't have any, and reduced the vinegar to half give or take a little.  This is the best recipe I have come across so far for a thick stick to your ribs type of sauce.  Will use again and maybe even can some for the winter!

This was an amazing sauce! Used it with a slow cooker pulled pork recipe. Added more brown sugar and cinnamon just to make it sweeter. All in all I had no idea how to make BBQ sauce before this and now I know how to make a killer sauce! Thanks!

This is an amazing sauce. I think the blends of flavor were just right. I almost made it without the hickory smoke but decided at the last minute to use it and I'm so glad I did. It was good without it but amazing with it. I did the recipe as is without any changes. Best recipe for BBQ sauce I have tried so far.

I found this sauce to very good. I have made it twice the second time I added 1 fresh onion and 4 garlic cloves. And substituted tomato paste for the spaghetti sauce added water to equal the two cups sauteeing the onions and garlic with the butter and spices. Also you can add chili paste to add heat (in small increments)

Loved it! After a few failed homemade bbq sauces, we I finally found a favorite tomato-based one. Made it as written but halved the recipe. It had all the flavors we like combined... sweet (not overly sweet), tangy, smokey, and a little bit of a bite. I simmered it for 20 min as the sauce will thicken when rested. So mouth watering just thinking about it.

Yum, yum!!! This sauce is GREAT! Tonight, I made kalua pig in a slow cooker (KIKUCHAN). Not wanting to serve it plain (even though that seems to be how most people enjoy it), I decided to serve our pork sandwiches with BBQ sauce, piled high on onion rolls. I'm really glad I did. :) The smokiness of the meat and the sweetness of this sauce blended extremely well together. My fiance liked this quite a bit (which is a HUGE plus!). He likened this to KC Masterpiece brand BBQ sauce. And the good part??? Now I don't have to buy it from the store! Al, your sauce recipe is going in my "keeper" file for sure. Thanks for sharing your secret blend! :-)

We recently move FROM Kansas City to TEXAS.  There were no decent sauces on the shelves here. So, today I made this.  Such goodness.  Makes me homesick just tasting the spoon.  Well done!

This is it.  I've made this over and over and it's the best bbq sauce we've ever had.   I've had people say it's better than "Dinosaur BBQ's Sauce."  That's quite a compliment.   I do let it simmer for a long time as we like it a little thicker.  The flavor is OUTSTANDING.

Absolutely great!  Scaled servings down to 6 and it was just enough for 4 pulled pork sandwiches.  The molasses made the sauce just sweet enough, and everyone raved about the flavor.  Thank you!

This is the BEST BBQ sauce I have ever eaten and I like around 4 or 5 BBQ places that make homemade sauce. My favorite used to be Bone Sucking Sauce and would use it on everything but not anymore...my new favorite is Big Al's. This recipe gave me a whole jar of leftovers and I have refrigerated it for another day. Thanks for the recipe.

Alan, thank you so much for this recipe - it's wonderful.  I cooked 17 pounds of pork shoulder in my slow cooker (had to do it in 2 batches), then made a double recipe of this sauce, and added the shredded pork.  It was fabulous!  I did leave out the celery seed because I'm not a fan, and I used slightly less brown sugar (a total of 2 cups instead of 2 1/2 for the double recipe) and it was still plenty sweet.  I might even up the liquid smoke a bit the next time - people, don't skip this ingredient!  Thank you again, Alan, for sharing this fabulous recipe.  I'll never use another barbecue sauce recipe again.

This is a great sauce. I made it to go with some pulled pork sandwiches. Although I had to tweak the ingredients a bit based on what I had in my pantry, it still turned out great.

Loved it!  No one in my UK grocery store had heard of mollasses before, so I had to sub maple syrup. And there was no liquid smoke to be found anywhere.  But it still turned out awesome! I will for sure be making this again!  Perfect with Sarge's EZ Pulled Pork recipe from this site.

Phenomenal! We followed the recipe exactly, apart from the liquid smoke part (not at all easy to find in Greece!), while sustituting mollasses with honey. We've made it already twice and will continue to. For just the two of us, we use 1/4 the amount suggested.

I have been using this recipe for a while now. I can it in BIG batches. It is not as thick as commercial sauces and that is just fine with me, as it makes a wonderful glaze on everything from chicken to meatloaf. I have played around with the ingredients and long story short...don't mess with a good thing. It's perfect as is. :-)

Most excellent! Highly recommend making this sauce! It is not spicy, just has a little "bite" to it. I cut the recipe in half, to suit our family's needs. 6 cups of sauce was too much. Other than that, I followed the recipe as is. I used this to cover pulled pork, specifically, Slow Cooker Pulled Pork from this website. My first time making pulled pork AND bbq sauce! In my husband's words "This is the best pulled pork sandwich I have ever had". Awesome!

Great BBQ sauce.  Used it on the BBQ Country Style Ribs on this site (couldn't grill outside since it was pouring rain!).  Now for some pulled pork sandwiches with the leftovers!  Will be using this recipe many times over.

I just whipped half a batch of this up for some ribs I have cooking in the crock pot.. OMG!  I taste tested this before pouring in the crock, and I was floored at how good it tasted!!  The cinnamon really made this.  I Did not have any molasses on hand so I substitued for SF Maple Syrup. Omitted the butter. I also substituted Apple cider vinegar for the red wine vinegar since i had none of that on hand either.  Even with these changes, it left my house smelling AMAZING!!  Definately would recommend this to EVERY ONE!

Love it!  We make it exactly as the recipe is written and it is wonderful.  I usually double the recipe so we can have it a couple of times on one batch.  I've even smothered it on chicken breasts in the crockpot  and it is so good.

This was a hit and pretty simple to make. Made the whole house smell delicious!  I marinated the chicken in the sauce overnight, then while the chicken was on the grill, I threw the extra sauce on the stove to thicken and make it safe to brush on the chicken for extra flavor.

YUM!  I've tried so many terrible BBQ sauce recipes and went with this as it had so many good reviews.  It's sweet, tangy and a little smoky.  I prefer a stickier sauce, so I simmered for 30 minutes.  It was perfect.  I used this with the slow-cooked rib recipe on this site and was blown away!  I'll be making a lot more of this BBQ sauce and storing it away to use over the spring/summer.  I've recommended this recipe to everyone I know!

This sauce is out of this world. I will never buy BBQ sauce again. Everyone at dinner was obsessed and wanted the recipe. The only thing I changed was not so much of the molasses in there since we don't like our BBQ so sweet. Amazing!!

I used a huge tub and mixed up 5X the recipe.  It yielded over 7 quarts, which I processed using my pressure cooker.   This was my first ever attempt at BBQ sauce and I couldn't be happier with the outcome.  This is a fantastic recipe if you are looking for a sweet everyday BBQ sauce.  I'm sure I will continue to mix it up exactly as published and keep it on hand all the time, but I intend to decrease the sugar and increase the heat for the next batch, as other reviews have suggested.  Thank you so much for this - I didn't modify a thing and love the outcome!

I needed a bbq sauce and thought I would try this one. I didn't have the liquid smoke, chili powder or the cayenne pepper but made it anyways--sometimes you don't always have all ingredients on hand. This sauce turned out FANTASTIC!! Even though I was missing probably the key ingredient, it was still awesome. Would surely make again!

Just like everyone else said it was great. I really don't think I'll make any adjustments next time. I oven baked some chicken drumsticks and tenderloins and dipped them in the sauce 10 minutes before they were ready.  Thank you!

This sauce is delicous! I did not have all of the ingredients. So I had to make some adjustments. I subsituted dark corn syrup and honey for molasses. I subsituted a combination of white and balsamic for apple cider vinegar. I left out the celery seed. I am posting because you should try this even if you have to make some minor adjustments. I also think it is hard to mess up, I scalled the servings to 12, and accidentally doubled the first couple of seasonings. Still was great. I generally do not like commercial bbq sauce... now that I have this recipe, I will not buy bottled bbq sauce. I slow-baked country-style ribs and used this for the sauce. Very simple, very tasty! Thank you for the post!

This is a very sweet bbq sauce, but it is probably the best i have ever tasted. My husband loves it, the only thing I change is not adding the liquid smoke, because I don't keep it on hand and I don't like smoke flavor.

I followed this recipe exactly, simmering for about an hour to make a really thick bbq sauce.  It doesn't taste like store-bought, but I found myself 'taste-testing' it over and over as it cooked b/c it was so good (sweet and spicy...mmm).  However, I think I liked the taste more before adding all of the spices (aka just using the first 7 ingredients).  The spices are a bit overpowering, -maybe I'll use less next time.

Absolutely PERFECT!! I made this to tase-test for serving BBQ Pork sandwiches for my husband's birthday party.  I've tried so many bottled sauces and another from scratch.  This is IT!! I didn't have tomato sauce so I used 1 can of paste plus 1.5 cans of water.  Otherwise I followed the recipe.  AMAZING!

Great, best sauce I have ever tasted. Used it on spareribs yesterday I will never buy the bottled stuff again. Cinnamon, who would have thought? I just happened to have all the ingredients on hand and no bbq sauce, so I tried this. Fantastic

I didn't have any bbq sauce, and really wanted to bbq some chicken. Instead of going to the store to buy a bottle, I thought I'd make it fresh.  And I found this flavorful recipe, and was thoroughly impressed with the taste. And I enjoyed making it from scratch.  I was excited to buy 3 things I have never bought: liquid smoke (for those rookies like me who need help finding it - it's by the hot sauce), molasses (by the syrup & honey - I thought it would be by the baking stuff), and celery seed (no brainer - in the spices section).  It makes a lot! So either cut back by half or more if it is just for one time use, or if you know how to properly seal it and store it then do that. I just decided to cook with it all week to use most of it up. I used this on chicken legs, thighs and breasts, as well as pork chops. All of it was delicious.

Excellent Kansas City style barbeque sauce!  I did omit the salt because with the ketchup and tomato sauce it had plenty of sodium in it.  Other than that, followed to a t.  This is definitely better than the bottled sauce at the store and no preservatives!

Made this straight from the recipe. Good sauce, vinegary-tomatoy-sweet with barely a touch of heat. I LIKE IT. I may play with it a bit next batch. I'm in KC and would not call this a "KC sauce" (there is no such thing, drop in and try several KC Q joints). I'm also a smoker, anything that will fit in my stick burner. We took 8th overall in the '09 American Royal Invitational BBQ Contest.

This is so tasty!  I didn't add liquid smoke because I didn't have any, but still very tasty.  I keep a large bottle in my fridge to use on burgers, steaks, chickens, etc.  Try it, you'll like it!

WOW! I wanted a basic barbeque sauce because I am sick of the high fructose corn syrup in all the store brands. This recipe blew me away. I followed it exactly and really only had to buy liquid smoke to make it. Totally worth it and very easy! Thanks, Big Al!

scaled this down to serve 6 and it was phenomenal! I couldn't believe how tasty it was. The only change I made was to use high quality balsamic vinegar in place of the red wine vinegar. I'm filing this in my "keeper" box!

I just made this sauce for pulled bbq beef tomorrow. This is the most excellent bbq sauce I have ever tried! No more bottled sauces for me. Another winner! Great job, Big Al!

This sauce is AWESOME! I was walking through the grocery store buying ingredients and had to stop in the aisle with all the pre-made BBQ Sauces. I stopped and looked at the hundreds of brands and types and thought to myself "is this really worth it? Look at all this stuff." The answer is a resounding "YES!" it was worth it.

This bbq sauce was AWESOME!!!! This is the first time I'd made bbq sauce and it turned out fantastic!!! I didn't have any liquid smoke so I used worcestershire sauce instead. I also didn't have any onion powder or celery seed so I used onion salt and celery salt and just omitted the salt it called for. I put this in the slow cooker with some chicken and made shredded bbq chicken sandwhiches. My husband loved this sauce and we will won't be getting bbq sauce from the store any more!! Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!!!!

Great recipe!  Sweet in the beginning with a small kick in the end.  I added a little extra cayenne pepper, and only a half cup of the vinegar.

This sauce is simply amazing! I've been making it for over a year now and everybody loves it. I scale the recipe down to 24 servings, which fits perfectly into a 20-ounce ketchup bottle. I have used both red wine vinegar and white vinegar and do not notice a difference, and I don't use celery seed. Don't be afraid to let it simmer more than 20 minutes; I often let it go 90 minutes or more on low (just barely bubbling) with great results. You can't mess this one up, seriously. It is so easy and so good. My parents and inlaws demand a constant stock of "my" BBQ sauce, stating it's the best they've ever had!

This is my go-to BBQ sauce!!  It's delicious on everything, chicken, ribs, pork BBQ.  I've used it as the sauce for a barbecue chicken pizza and it was awesome.  I just can't get enough of it.  I do leave out the celery seed simply b/c I never have it onhand but I really don't miss it.  Thanks Big Al for a super BBQ sauce.

Absolutely the best BBQ sauce I have ever tasted.  Followed the recipe exactly and it was even better the next day! Canned half the recipe in hot boiled mason jar until it sealed, put in fridge and opened it again in 3 weeks and it was the best!

This is a great recipe!  it made a lot!  I used this for pulled pork in my crock.  Poured half of it on and reserved the other half in a mason jar.  Perfect recipe, nothing needs to be added to or taken away!  Love it!!

Maybe it's just me, but I have a fundamental problem with a BBQ sauce recipe that uses 2 cups of Ketchup *AND* 2 cups of tomato sauce. Why not use one or the other? For that matter, one *IS* the other. No?

I've made this twice and I have two opinions of this sauce.  When I based my ribs w/ this sauce, the ribs were tender and fall off the bone.  I got rave reviews.  I think the sauce itself has the "kick of a mule".  I've never had homemade BBQ sauce before and I think that this is rather "vinegery".  I seems to mellow when used for basting on BBQ.  I don't think I was use it as a condiment on anything such as puul pork or chicken.  When cooking this sauce, it makes my house have a terrific smell of summer.  Thank you.

Delicious bbq sauce!  I added a little whiskey and used 1/4 cup molasses and 1/4 cup honey, and halved the celery seed.  I also cooked about 45 minutes on low to get it to thicken up substantially.  The little bite from the cayenne and chili is just right in my opinion but could probably use a smidge less for kids or a bit more if you like it pretty spicy.  I'd still like it if it had a little bit more.  I only just made the sauce tonight and haven't used it on anything yet, but it is truly fabulous and I cannot wait to slather it on anything!  This sauce would be great on anything!

This has to be the best bbq sauce I have ever tasted.  I let it simmer,  on med/low for about an hour,  then brushed on my ribs.  Perfection,  can't say it any other way.  Everybody loved it.

We loved this sauce!  I didn't have any tomato sauce so I pureed a can of diced tomatoes which I am sure would have made it a bit thinner sauce if I hadn't cooked it in my little slow cooker for about 6 hours and 'cocking' the lid the last 2 hours.  Had a wonderful consistency.  I thought the red wine vinegar was going to be over powering because when I stuck my head over the sauce to smell, the vinegar choked me and made me cough---LOL!  It was not over powering to eat at all, just don't take a close up big sniff!  Thank you so much for this recipe!!

This recipe is awesome and super easy to make.  When my husband smells this sauce cooking he gets excited.  I will no longer use bottled bbq sauce EVER AGAIN.  I've made it like a jillion times- with the liquid smoke and sometimes with hotsauce, when I was out of liquid smoke-and it turns fabulous everytime.  Thanks for the great recipe.

All I have to say is WOW! This recipe is AMAZINGLY good! A friend/coworker of mine recommended it and I tried it. I've always loved Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce in the bottle, but WOW...this recipe has quickly replaced that! The real test is whether my fiancé will like it. We'll see this weekend! This recipe is highly recommended, don't even think twice. (Also, I followed the recipe to a T) Can I say, PERFECTOOOOO!!

I didn't have molasses, so used cane syrup in a lesser amount. Doubled the cayenne. Used it one night for chicken, and the left-over sauce for a pork chop. This is a keeper.

Wow! Such an easy to make recipe.  Completed in no-time...and the results were better than anticipated.  The pulled pork sandwiches were outstanding. Can't wait to try it on other meats.  Thank God I'm not a vegan.

I made this and put it on shredded chicken. The only change I made was I added a little more onion and garlic powder and only put in about half of the cinnamon. And I simmered it for about 45 minutes cause my husband likes thicker BBQ sauce. This is a great recipe. I will never buy bottled again. Thanks Big Al.

I really Do like this sacue however, I had to only give it five stars simply because it was not to my liking. After making it to a T I made adjustments to it and it came out fantastic. I added more onion powder and garlic powder. I added chopped parsley, half a bottle of miller lite beer, and a little honey. Once I did that it was wonderful!

I made this sauce and put it in a pressure cooker with boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  It was delicious!!  I will be making this again and trying it on the barbeque.  Definitely worth five stars.

Very tasty sauce! I didn't have molasses, but since I am diabetic I really didn't miss the extra sweetness! Also used fresh garlic, onion and celery instead of the powders called for. Thanks!

Great recipe! Thanks so much, I used it on a pork roast and everyone loved it. Unlike a lot of the other recipes I've tried, the vinager doesn't over power the sauce. Looking forward to trying it on other meats!

Wow. This sauce is exactly what I was looking for. The only thing I added was a little Bourbon and some lime juice. I'm not a big fan of wine vinegar but it works really well in this sauce. It was a big hit at the BBQ party today.

This is an excellent basic bbq sauce recipe.  It makes plenty to put into the fridge and use again and again.  Much better and more economical than store bought bbq sauces.  Excellent flavor!

The best bbq sauce I have ever had. I don't buy any sauce now, but simply make this up (it is very quick and easy to make). I put it on my pulled pork sandwiches (I use a recipe from this site - southern pulled pork) and it is really great.

Why, why, why would you create something that tears families apart?  All this rich, flavorful goodness demands everyone's attention at the same time.  All the reaching and grabbing, and elbows flying... someone needs to put a stop to this sticky situation!

Oh wait, I'll just put some Big Al's in more bowls spread across the table.

Thanks Big Al for actually bringing us all together!

Just a great, sweet BBQ sauce. Made it just as written, then took half and simmered 10 more minutes with a minced habanero. Now that's some sweet, smoky sauce with a bite! We honestly loved both. Make it sweet, make it spicy, but do yourself a big favor and just make it! Thanks Big Al...

Very good sauce! I did not have celery seed or cayenne pepper and used maybe half a cup of red wine vinegar. I also added some ground mustard. While I was cooking the sauce it seemed a little too sweet, but I put this on pulled pork and it was amazing!

This is the BEST BBQ sauce I have ever had. I’ve been making this for years, probably close to a decade, and should have reviewed it sooner. This recipe really doesn’t need any tweaking. With that being said, I do half the cinnamon for my own personal taste. I find it overpowering when stored for more than a few days. I also like to simmer for more than an hour to temper the Red Wine vinegar and thicken it. These are my own personal preferences though and not necessary. I usually just make it early in the day of a BBQ and, after the ingredients come together at medium heat, let it simmer for a couple hours. Fantastic recipe. Thanks to the originator for sharing and to anyone who reads this. Enjoy!

Clicked the send button too quick but doesn’t really matter. What matters is that this is phenomenal BBQ sauce! Did some tiny changes ( smoked paprika, Worcestershire, Dijon mustard and a few tiny things)  but like others said it was fantastic as is. Just adjusting per my taste. I recommend making the recipe as is then making changes for your own taste buds

LOVE this sauce! I didn’t have any celery seed, so I cut up a couple of celery stalks in large pieces and cooked them in the sauce. I removed the celery when the sauce was done cooking.

Do not make any changes, unless I substitute a missing ingredient with a similar one.    You feel like a mad scientist with all the ingredients, but the  results are the best.   I have made this at least 6 times and this will continue to be my favorite.

Love this sauce, this is the only BBQ sauce recipe we use.  We have been using it for years.  We make a double batch and don't include the butter so it lasts longer.  We adjust the cayenne depending on who we are serving it to. No other changes.

The only variation (and I'm still working on perfecting it) is modifying the recipe to use readily available sizes for the the ketchup and tomato sauce.  It would be nice to just pour in whole bottles/cans, rather than measure it out and have scant leftovers.

Also, I never make enough.  Gotta develop the recipe with #10 cans of ketchup and tomato sauce.

Was absolutely delicious, though I made it without the celery seed and changed the proportions around, (less vinegar, more spices). Cooked it for 30 mins and it thickened decently enough in the fridge. It's now my new "secret ingredient" I use in my burger recipe!

I made the recipe exactly as directed this first time.  It completely deserves all the raves it's getting.  If I changed anything at all next time, it would probably have a bit more heat in a separate batch.  But this BBQ sauce is terrific!

Very good BBQ sauce. Used Apple vinegar since it was going on pork ribs.  Added a few Asian things and tastes good. Saved me a trip to the store to buy bbq sauce.

I followed the recipe exactly and it is just incredibly sweet and not very impressive.  Given the amount of brown sugar and molasses I should have realized that.  Would not make again and not sure what to do with my half gallon of sauce now.

Great recipe! My family loves store bought BBQ sauce, but I strongly dislike the ingredient list. This is the first BBQ sauce that they actually liked better than store bought. Yah! The changes I made because of personal preference is as follows: I used maple syrup instead of brown sugar, eliminated the liquid smoke (until I can find natural liquid smoke), reduced the cayenne and the black pepper to 1/4 tsp.

Made it tonight as written and it is delicious.  Like others stated, tastes just like Sweet Baby Rays sauce, so you have to like a sweet sauce.  Don't skip the liquid smoke or the spices, it would make a difference.  Thank you for a great recipe.  The amount is a lot by the way.


EDIT: 6/12/15 I have now made it twice and used it on ribs and chicken several times. I also cut the sugar the second time because it is so sweet. My family preferred it with the additional sugar because it caramelized better on the grill. I'm ok with the lesser sugar content but I feel that you need to up the spiciness a little.

This sauce is amazing. It's the first BBQ sauce I've ever made - I need it for my pulled pork recipe - and I'm bowled over by it. I always thought I didn't like BBQ sauce, because I've only ever had bottled. This is perfect. I made a couple of subs: I used fresh garlic because I didn't have powdered, and I forgot the brown sugar. Am glad I did because it's super sweet even without it. Have bookmarked this one.

I am just now getting around to rating this recipe, but I have made it MANY times. This is my go-to sauce for everything barbecue. This is actually the recipe that turned me on to allrecipes. I found it looking around at recipes online, 3 years or so ago. It makes everyone in my family happy. I leave out celery seed as I rarely ever have it on hand. I also don't always have molasses on hand, so when I don't I just increase the brown sugar a little. Either way it comes out perfect, EVERYTIME. Thanks so much for sharing this!

Ridiculously amazing. I've made tons of BBQ sauces but never could get that restaurant taste to it. This sauce tastes just like your favorite bbq joint's sauce! I added a little more cayenne pepper and added some chipotle tobasco sauce to heat it up a bit more.

I just got through making this sauce and it is delicious. After reading the reviews I did use some of the suggestions. I only used 1 cup of ketchup. 1 cup of brown sugar. 1/4 cup of molasses. I added more garlic an onion powder cause I like garlicky sauces. I tasted the sauce through out stirring and even tasted it with my ribs I made from this site. 
http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Slow-Cooker-Baby-Back-Ribs/?prop31=2

They came out perfect. My first time in a long time making ribs. Now they are cooking in the oven to give it that caramelized glaze. I swear with the taste of this sauce and the tenderness of this meat you would think your in a BBQ joint. A really good one.
Only sauce I will be making from now on.

Used Worcester shire sauce instead of liquid smoke because we were doing the ribs & chicken thighs on the grill with wood chips. After checking reviews, used peanut oil instead of butter (for table time) & left out celery seed.  GREAT!!
To answer one re viewer's question:  back when it was do hard to find all natural foods, I had a young son who has hyper kinetic & could not tolerate additives, preservatives, artificial floors & colors, etc.  He wanted ketchup for hot fries & burgers like his older brother so I tried to make some.  Close but no cigar -- uuntil I found a recipe in a really old cookbook I picked up in a used book store (already really old when i got it back in the'70 lol).  The one ingredient that makes ketchup taste like ketchup is -- tahdah!) Cinnamon!!

I made this sauce a long time ago and loved it. Made it again recently and I am very satisfied with the taste. Much better than the plastic bottle brands in the grocery store.
 
I've tried it as directed and added a few ingredients to give it a little kick:
 3 tsp. cayenne
 1 TBS mesquite seasoning
 3 TBS habanero sauce

This is a lot like Kc masterpiece or sweet baby rays.  I read the label on sweet baby rays and it uses pineapple juice, so I have used that and its really great if you like it a little sweeter.  Also try using more cyan pepper if you like it hotter.

It turned out AMAZING!!! But... I made some changes- hence the 4 star.
First let me explain that we are Paleo because my DD has a mild IBS (which thanks to Paleo is healing up on it's own).  So when a recipe calls for sugar I use half whatever it calls for in honey.  When it calls for brown sugar I do the same- but it's 1TB molasses per cup for Paleo "brown sugar".  So I did that here.  I had everything on hand except for the RW-Vinegar and celery seeds.  I chose to use fresh onion and garlic.  I used 1/6cup onion and 4 cloves garlic and sauteed them in the butter, I waited till they caramelized lightly- figuring they would have a deeper flavor.  I used smoked paprika, because I like a smokey sauce.  I put it all together without the Vinegar and celery seeds and then ran up to the store with it in a slow cooker.  When I got back with the ving I Loved the smell, but noted it already smelled very acidic "bright".  So I tasted it- and this is the most significant change- I really did Not want to make it that much More acidic than it already was.  I added 1/4 cup vinegar and tasted it again- and Man am I Glad I did!! because I thinking adding anymore than that would've ruined it for us.  I Loved it that way- but I noted that there was not much of an umami taste, that I thought would really play well with the smokiness.  So- I added 1Tb of Fish Sauce.  It is as good at the sauce we get at a local restaurant that's known for it's homemade sauces!!  Seriously- Perfect!!

This has been my favorite sauce for a couple years now, though I always double all of the spices. Recently I modified it for a large batch of pulled pork, using apple cider vinegar in place of red wine vinegar and  coconut sugar instead of brown for a more earthy flavor. It's a huge hit with the boyfriend, and both of us have been raiding the fridge several times a day for more.

We've been using this recipe for over a year- We use this for Chicken , Pork Ribs and Pulled Pork, and anything else that requires BBQ Sauce, its a winner !! I DO cut the Cayenne pepper in half but only because my 6 year old doesn't like spicey on any level. This is the only BBQ sauce we use anymore.

Love, Love, Love!!  I used a pinch of Cayenne bc of the kids, but this is by far better than ANY store bought recipe.  It's been a staple in my house for close to a year now!  Search no more for your new favorite BBQ recipe.

Love this. Only changes we made were we didn't have enough ketchup, so we used 3 cups of tomato sauce and 1 cup of ketchup. We thought because of this we needed to add something, so why not 1/4 cup 100 proof Southern Comfort. We will never buy bottled sauce again.

This sauce is delicious.  I've simplified the process a bit for my family, and now we never are without fresh ketchup and bbq sauce.  First off I make a double-triple, sometimes quadruple batch of "In a pinch ketchup" from this site.  I make it directly in my blender, reducing the amount of water so I don't have to boil it down at all.  I make a few healthy substitutions (in both recipes).  For example, sucanat instead of brown sugar, omit the corn syrup, omit butter (from bbq sauce recipe), etc.  I scoop out some ketchup into a jar until there's 2 c. left in the blender, I then add all the bbq ingredients (again, I adjust for our tastes), and just blend for 1-2 minutes, jar it up, and stick it in the fridge.  At the end of the day, I have fresh ketchup, fresh bbq sauce, one blender and a few measuring utensils to wash.  I have NEVER noticed a difference since I stopped cooking it.  We go through at least a batch a month!  Delicious!

We LOVE this recipe--I keep it mostly as written, yet we don't use ketchup as it is full of high fructose corn syrup. Instead, I add one can of drained, diced, chili-ready tomatoes and onions, and a 14.5 0z can of tomato sauce, blend all in blender or food processor, and then put in a crock so it can simmer all day as the meat smokes. It is thick, and delicious!!

Yum.  Used pure maple syrup instead of molasses and crushed fresh tomatoes rather than tomato sauce.  Maybe a touch too vinegary for my taste, but still delicious.  Thanks!

My family makes me triple  the recipe to have leftovers to keep in the fridge. I won't use anything else after trying this fantastic sauce. Here's an easy idea: shread chicken breast, add sauce and you have an instant  sandwich. My son thinks this is the most amazing thing and it is the easiest ever!

I was grilling ribs  and realized after the ribs were already on the grill I didn't have as much BBQ sauce as I thought I had. I usually make my own with a various combination of pre-made sauces, but didn't have all the ingredients for it. Daughter and I searched, found this, and quickly put it together. I obviously didn't have the simmer time as the ribs were ready for the sauce so I microwaved it for a few minutes and headed for the grill. I still like my sauce better, but this was an excellent second choice. thank you for sharing.

I wanted to try a new BBQ sauce and stumbled across this recipe. Figured I give it a try and see what happened. This sauce is now the only BBQ I will use. Great flavor and it makes more than enough to last many grilling sessions. Read a couple reviews and decided to cook much longer than suggested. Simmered for 15 minutes longer than suggested and got a nice thick sauce. Used on pork chops, chicken, and ribs. Brand name BBQ doesn't even compare.

I've made this many times except I use 1/4 tea of cayenne instead of half...personal preference. Also, this last time, I completely forgot the butter and it was still awesome. Seriously, I can drink this out of a glass. Love-love-love it!

This is a very good sauce! I did however, add 1 large garlic clove and 1 small onion pulsed in food processor until almost liquid. in place of the powdered onion, garlic. Amazing balance of flavors. This one is a keeper in my recipe  box.

This recipe is AWESOME!!!! The only thing I do differently is I add 1/4 cup of apple juice concentrate, and it gives it such a nice flavor! Also if you want to make a huge batch for canning, increase the servings to 288 (six batches) and you can use the huge 7lb cans of ketchup and tomato sauce (I just use a whole can of apple juice concentrate to make a big batch and it works great)

Very tasty!  I added a bit more vinegar and chili to give it some added oomph, and I cut the sugar by 1/3.  (It was still VERY sweet--I may halve it next time.)  It goes very well with pot roast/brisket, as the thick texture of the sauce helps complement the texture of the meat.

Very good sauce. Right out of the pot, it tastes a little too ketchupy but after a few days in the fridge, it's great. I omit the cayenne since the little ones can't take the heat, but it's still very good.

WOW! this is so good, I had cooked a pork loin in the slow cooker for sandwiches and did not want to use bottled bbq, As always I come to this site and can always find what I need. Thanks for a great bbq sauce.

I made this sauce on a whim so I didn't have liquid smoke but I thought it still taste great.  I used a little less brown sugar but my fiance still thought the sauce was a bit sweet.  I will continue to make this but probably will add less sugar and get liquid smoke to see the taste difference.

We cut the recipe lin half and used it on a TriTip roast on the grill. We substituted Lemon juice for the red wine vinegar. The sauce was delicious and we plan on using it more as we get into the Barbeque season.

Holy guacamole! This recipe was amazing!! A group of us are in Peace Corps and it came out wonderfully! One teensy change we made due to lack of some of the crucial ingredients: adding mustard paste (in the same amount as spices) and adding extra cayenne pepper due to lack of paprika. I can't wait to make this in the States!

Oh Big Al! This was to die for! I actually added a very small sweet onion, chopped and carmelized and it was out of this world! Q'd some thighs and drumsticks to perfection! It was gone in a flash! Except the couple pieces I hid for lunch the next day. It's a keeper! Thanks!

I made a few modifications.  Too much vinegar.  I would suggest only using 3/4 cup.  A little more brown sugar and molasses made it sweeter.  I also increased the spices to make it pop.  Over all I'm very happy with the recipe.

I can't say whether this is authentic KC style sauce but I can say that it's very good!  A nice sweet sauce with some kick.  While it was simmering I was sure it smelled like something I had bought...once it was done I let it sit for a couple days in the fridge, then baked some chicken quarters and then slathered this on, then put them under the broiler for a few minutes.  The result was a very flavorful, lip-smacking chicken!  The sauce kinda reminds me of Sonny's sweet BBQ sauce but then the kick reminds me a local place's (Mark's Pizzeria) BBQ wing sauce.

I wasn't totally blown away, but it was definitely good.  A little too much vinegar for my taste, so I just added a little more brown sugar to balance it out.  I did have to let it simmer for an extra 15 minutes to get it to the thickness I wanted.  Overall pretty tasty though.  Slathered it on some pulled pork sandwiches - yummm!

This sauce is finger lickin good!!!  I just came across this recipe on 4/5/10 and have already used it on chicken and pulled pork. I cut back on the pepper be-cause we prefer less heat, otherwise, I didn't change a thing.  I will definitely use this from now on.  Thank you Alan for sharing.

This was my first attempt at BBQ sauce, it was great.  I did not have mollases, so I used honey.  Next time I will try the mollases.  And next time I may cut down on the chilli powder.

Made this to fix barbecued chicken late last summer -- just loved the sauce.  Also used it for several cookouts last summer and everyone loved it.  I am ready to make it again, but will halve the recipe since there are only two of us.  Wouldl recommend it to anyone.  Will probably never buy barbecue sauce again.

came out great..I was even lazy and microwaved it for 5 min to "cook" it. Only changes were minor: I used half red and half white vinegars (since that was what I had left on hand...not enough red) and I doubled the chili powder....I like a bit more chili flavor. Oh...I also omitted the butter...used olive oil instead in the name of being healthier. I made half a batch since there are only 3 of us here and it made plenty.

I will never buy bbq sauce again. My kids want to lick the inside of the jar. It is really good on chicken, pork, and bbq beans.

Very cool!  I made BBQ Sauce!  I happened to have all of the ingredients in house (don't really know WHY I have molasses, but I do!) so it came together quickly and easily.

Fantastic sauce!  I have made this twice now-once without the liquid smoke (because I did not have any in the house) and once with it.  The liquid smoke makes all the difference in this recipe.  Without it the recipe needed a lot of tweaking.  However, this time I followed the recipe as written and it was wonderful.   It has a little something for everyone-it's sweet but not too sweet and it has a little kick-it's perfect!

A SUPER SAUCE! very easy to make. good on everything. i didn't have any paprika on hand, so i added a half tsp of hot sauce (chili pepper based). WOW!!! it gave it a nice zing.  next time i think i'll cut down the molasses by a third and use honey as well... i did find it to be a tad too sweet for my taste, but all around great.

Excellent! I was light on the cayenne and chilli powder for the kids, and used apple cider vingegar instead, but it was great. Hubby loved it on pulled pork.

Definitetly a crowd pleaser!  This was a star at our latest BBQ.  I will make Big Al's sauce again, and will make it in large quantities for giving away in the family gift baskets this Holiday Season.  The only change I will make is for my personal use, and I would increase the cayenne or decrease the cinnamon.  That's just personal preference...the sauce is PHENOMENAL as is.

Great sauce, will use again. I was out of tomato sauce so I doubled the ketchup. It was a little too sweet, so if I have to use ketchup again I'll cut down the brown sugar.

This was very good and much easier/quicker to make than I had thought it would be to make a homemade BBQ sauce.  I added a bit more vinegar than the recipe called for because I like the flavor it brings to a BBQ sauce.  It was delicous and easy to make.  I used it to make the "Slow Cooker Barbeque Ribs" from the AR site.  The meal was liked by my whole family.  No need to buy store bought BBQ sauce anymore.  Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe!

This recipe is exactly why I LOVE bbq sauce! Next time I am going to make it a bit spicer and add some chipotle seasoning. I used the sauce for grilled bone-in breast halves and it was perfect. Served the chicken with white rice, corn and sauteed zucchini. I definitely recommend this sauce!

We tried this BBQ sauce and it will be the only one we make from now on.  It's thick and delicious!  We will probably cut back on the vinegar and add a bit more brown sugar but, all in all, you can't go wrong with this recipe.  I'm not a spice lover but this has just the right amount to add a bite to the sauce without being overdone.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is by far the best homemade BBQ sauce I've ever had! The first time I made it it was way too sweet for us, so I cut back a lot on the sugar the next time I made it. Also, I didn't use any liquid smoke. But this is the REAL thing, like the kind you get in the restaurants. Some may want to increase the spices, but for me it was just cutting back on the sugar. Soooo tasty...

This is the only sauce I make anymore. It is sweet, but not too sweet, and has just enough kick from the spices.  It makes a lot of sauce, but do not be tempted to cut the recipe in half.  The longer it sits in the fridge after cooking, the better it gets!  I use this sauce for everything, but my favorite is on baby back ribs cooked slowly in the oven with Tennessee Rubdown from this site, then on the grill with this sauce.  That rub and this sauce together...mmmm...perfection!

AWESOME!!!  My hubby & I made 2 batches - the first we simmered about 25 miniutes, the second about an hour.  Both were absolutely delicious, but the second batch was much thicker, which we prefer.  Fabulous on baby backs!!!

this is by far the best bbq sauce ever. i love adding it to my pulled pork sanwiches with coleslaw on top or shredded beef.  it makes a huge amount which is great to save for other things later.   it does freeze well too.  i love hearing all the rave reviews about this sauce.  my inlaws absolutly love it.  everyone asks for the recipe.  thank you for the great yummy super recipe.  we love it.

I used this on chicken and made a BBQ Chicken salad (on romaine iwth pico di gallo, cheese, etc).  Then, I also put some of this sauce in with some Ranch dressing and used that as the dressing!! It was phenomenal.  A serving of 12 was enough for 4 with a bit left over.

My family and I love this tangy barbeque sauce!  I've made it as the directions state, and it was good.  When I made it the second time, I opted for 3 cups of tomato sauce and 1 cup of ketchup to cut back on the sugar.  Both ways were excellent!  I plan to use this on a roast in the crockpot to make barbecued beef sandwiches next.  Yummy!!

This sauce is FABULOUS....Hours after dinner our taste buds were still dancing with joy. I made the "BBQ Pork for Sandwiches" from this site.  I was going to buy a bbq sauce, but so glad I didn't. This was so easy and quick to make.  We like our sauce thick, so I just let it simmer for about 45 minutes on low.  Removed it from the heat and let it cool down for an hour and a half.  Thank You for this FABULOUS recipe.  This is a KEEPER.

Excellent! It's almost like the secret recipe wing sauce from the pizza places I grew up working at (small, private store) except a bit more thicker and more rib bbq type whereas that other secret recipe is more of a "sticky" sauce

So I'm a vegetarian. But I was looking for a barbeque sauce to make barbeque beef sandwiches with for my family. I slow cooked bottom round all day, shredded it, and then added this sauce. I served it with big kaiser rolls. I can't speak for myself but everyone loved it. They said the sauce was amazing!

Delicious!  Just the right combination of sweet and tangy.  I've made this sauce several times to use as my barbecue sauce for slow cooker barbecue chicken.  Any leftover sauce freezes awesomely.

I made this sauce exactly as directed and it was WONDERFUL!  I made pulled pork in my crock pot using a beef broth and coffee mixture, put the sauce over the pork when it was done, tossed it in the fridge overnight and then reheated it the next day.  I have never gotten so many compliments on a recipe before!  Better than any restaurant pulled pork.

OH MY GOSH this is outstanding and so simple!  I did'nt have the molasses so I subbed dark corn syrup and it is amazing- I can't stop licking the spoon! Also left out the celery seed- I so can not wait to make more recipes with this, as I'm using it as a dip for chicken tenders tonight. YUM!

It was good enough to eat, but not good enough to make again.  The sauce had way too much vinegar.

First of all I can't believe I actually had all of the ingredients for this recipe.  Secondly, it is outstanding.  the longer it cooks the thicker it gets.  I used on chicken and can see using it on just about any meat.

Incredible BBQ sauce. Probably the best I have had.   The only alteration I made was using apple cider vinegar instead of red wine. I didn't have any red wine vinegar on hand. Even with the alteration the recipe was out of this world.   This recipe is a keeper.

Fabulous! I didn't have the molasses (but I do for next time) so I subbed Pure Maine Maple Syrup and omitted the brown sugar because of the sweetness of the syrup. Otherwise I made the recipe as is and it was SO GOOD! Sweet and Tangy. Next time I will use the molasses and see which combo I like better. I served this on pulled chicken breast sandwiches for me (Hub had his with NO bread). I just added the two shredded chicken breasts into the sauce pan with my sauce (which I had scaled to 12) and let it simmer for a few minutes. I was extremely happy with the results. Thank you so much for sharing this!

Might be a little too sweet for some with the molasses and brown sugar but good flavor overall. The heat from the cayenne, chili powder and black pepper does not burn the tongue but gives you a little heat towards the back of your mouth which is really nice.

Wanted grilled BBQ chicken, didn't have BBQ sauce, but had the ingredients for this. I've made BBQ sauce before, but never from a recipe...just added things til it tasted right. This is FAR better than any attempt I've ever made! Made 1/2 batch, used apple cider vinegar for most of the red wine vinegar about a 2:1 ratio. Did half honey and half molasses. Subbed celery salt for celery seed. Also added about a TSP or 2 of light corn syrup- I've found that gives BBQ sauce a nice 'shine'. Simmered 20-30 mins. Once cooled, I funneled it into an old ketchup squeezy bottle. This sauce is the perfect mix of BBQ flavors...smoky, tangy and sweet with a kick... A little thin though. Made FANTASTIC Grilled chicken breasts. I don't think I'll ever buy BBQ sauce again, and next time I'll make the full amount! UPDATE: I wanted to do a whole BBQ chicken on the grill- put bird in a roasting pan, doused in this sauce and put the pan on the grill for 2-1/2 hrs, basting throughout. AWESOME chicken and the leftovers made the BEST chicken salad EVER with black beans, corn and  cumin/chili powder/mayo/chive sour cream 'sauce'. The BBQ sauce flavor really came through in the chicken- can't wait to do it again! ***3RD REVIEW: Made full recipe amount & added 1TS cornstarch + 1TB h20 mixed, 1/2 molasses 1/2 honey, simmered 2 hrs...PERFECTION!!! Nice & thick, PERFECT flavor. Big Al, YOU ROCK!

halved the recipe and still had plenty to go in the fridge. Used with the Slow Cooker Pulled Pork from here. Delicious! Made the French Rolls to die for and we had a great sandwich. I didn't have molasses of any sort so i subbed honey and it was still delicious! Oh and I had celery salt so I used that and regular ole liquid smoke. Tasty

This sauce is amazing!  I read most of the reviews before making this and the only modification I made was using 3/4 of vinegar, omitted the cayenne pepper (didn't have any!) and simmered for 90 minutes since I like my sauces thick.  A big thank you to Alan Arthur for sharing this with us!

I was initially looking for a "healthy" type of barbecue sauce. I decided to use all of the ingredients, minus the brown sugar and butter. After the sauce attained the consistency that I wanted, I cooled the sauce off, and added Splenda to taste. I was very pleased with the outcome.  This is definitely a recipe that I will try again.

Great stuff.  I made a big batch and then added different spices to smaller batches to see what would work to give it some extra hotness.  We actually liked them all.  The entire pot (1 gallon?) was gone in 2 weeks!  I will be making this again and again.  Note:  I did let it simmer for ~2hrs when I was making it.

fantastic! the first time i made this my husband told me to stop buying bbq sauce and just make this stuff instead. 2 small changes, i put in about 1/4 of the vinegar that the recipe called for and replaced the rest with blush wine because i have found that vinegar can quickly ruin a good sauce. i also replaced the liquid smoke with whiskey. yum!

I guess I just wasn't that impressed with the sauce.  It didn't have that something that I was looking for to differentiate it from store-bought.

I had smoked a Top Sirloin Roast and with the leftovers, I made BBQ beef using this sauce recipe exactly as is.  I sliced the roast, added sauce and placed in a 250 degree oven for about two hours.

This is an amazing bbq sauce.  I had boiled some ribs, put them in a crock pot and poured this sauce over the top.  I cooked it all day and it was delish!!!  Hubby said they are the best ribs and sauce he ever tasted.  My company also thought they were excellent.  Great sauce!!

Fantastic! I'll back off the red wine vinegar a little next time. Because I can't readily buy liquid smoke here (I'm in Europe) I think the vinegar was a bit overwhelming. So I'll add half next time and go up from there. 

But absolutely the best and tastiest sauce even without liquid smoke! I used it with shredded left over pot roast (chuck roast), added some fried onions and fried bell peppers, mixed it all up and served it with some cheese on a nice hoagie roll. Excellent sauce!

This is an amazing BBQ sauce recipe! Also, this was my first time making homemade sauce and it went without a hitch - beginners should definitely try this out and it will make people think you've been cooking for years! 
A couple of things. I didn't have celery seed or paprika, so I just eliminated them from the recipe. I had liquid smoke but accidently purchased mesquite flavor instead of hickory. I happen to like a little kick to the sauce, so I added some crushed red peppers. The alterations didn't take away from the flavor - it is a great recipe.

Without a doubt the best barbecue sauce recipe I've been able to find.  I added 1/4 teaspoon dry mustard, and 1/8 cup worcestshire sauce to make it fit my taste a little better, but very, very good.

This is a great sauce, however I only gave it 4 stars because it is way too sweet. Nexttime I make it I will cut down on the sugar. It is definitly a keeper though. Thank you for this recipe!!

This spectacular recipe took me back to Ks and Flint Hills... My family and friends LOVE this sauce. I did the math and used #10 cans of tomato sauce and ketchup. Then canned it in quart jars. Gifts this season are covered!! THANKS AL!!!

Really yummy, I made a pulled chicken with this sauce and it was a HUGE hit. I did't have celery seed or red wine vinager so I used cider vinager and it was great.  I will half up this recipe next time because it makes a ton...it all still went though!  Thanks Big Al!

I loved this recipe.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated the first time--but had to add 1 more cup of tomato sauce and 1/2 cup extra of ketchup--then it was perfect for me.  I made this for Sarge's EZ pulled pork on this site--I was a bit disappointed that the sauce broke down in the crockpot and became soup like--not to worry though--I slathered Big Al's KC BBQ Sauce over the meat when it came out of the crockpot...it was awesome.  I made the recipe a second time (just can't get enough of this)marinated some chicken legs then had some BBQ sauce on the side for dipping--talk about yummy....thanks Big Al...I love it!

Phenomenal sauce!! I paired this sauce with Sarge's easy pulled pork recipe from this site. YUMMMM!!! I took the left over sauce and poured it into a large, squeeze bottle ketchup container and store it in the fridge, so it's always at our fingertips! I'll never buy bbq sauce again.

This was very delicious on my baby back ribs.  I can't wait to use it on chicken.  I had to add a little extra brown sugar for sweetness because I only had about 1/4 c of molasses, but this was excellent.

OH...MY...GOD...
This was the most unbelievable BBQ sauce I've ever had. The cinnamon adds a unique and wonderful flavor. I substituted the brown sugar for Splenda to cut down the carbs and it was still fabulous. I'm sure brown sugar would have tasted even better, though! The only ingredient that I left out was celery seed only because I didn't have it. I cut the recipe down as I was cooking for one, but I wish I would have had more on hand to dip the chicken in while I ate.  Brushing it on during BBQ'ing wasn't enough! Will definitely make this again.

This is certainly a sweet BBQ sauce but absolutely tasty.  I did make some minor modifications: 3/4 cup red wine vinegar, no liquid smoke, 1/4 tsp of celery seed, one small grated onion, and a pinch of cayenne pepper.  I also brought the sauce to a low boil and then turned it down to simmer for about 30 minutes. Enjoy! Update: Sometimes I like a sweeter sauce so I decrease the cayenne pepper to a pinch and add 1 tbs of brown sugar (half recipe).  Update: I've cooked this several times and I have come up with the following modifications (this is for half of the recipe). Use 1/2 cup and 3 tbs. of brown sugar, no cayenne pepper, a little less than 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar., a little than 1/2 tsp of pepper, and a 1/4 tsp of celery seed.  Update: Full recipe perfection: 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar, 1/2 cup of red wine vinegar, 1/4 tsp of chili powder, 1/2 tsp of celery seed, 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, 1 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp of pepper, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp of onion powder, and no chili powder.  Everything else remains the same.

I used this as a marinade for bone-in pork chops for 24 hours, only I didn't have the smoke flavoring. I literally had people licking the bones the sauce was that good! I put the leftover sauce in a pan, and brought it to a simmer. I barbecued the chops and used the sauce to baste every time I turned. I will use this recipe again, next time I'll use fresh garlic though.

This sauce is awesome! Everyone at our BBQ asked me for the recipe. We didn't have any liquid smoke, so we left that out. We added about 2 tsp of regular prepared mustard and a little extra pepper. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly and it was fabulous. Thanks for sharing!!

YUMMY!  I halved the recipe and used it for the BBQ Pork for Sandwiches recipe on this site.  I only used 1/2 the vinegar though.  Also, I swapped the celery seed and salt for celery salt instead.

I was looking for a sweet sauce and this is it!  I did however cut 1/2 cup of brown sugar out of the recipe it is still sweet enough.  Other than that followed the recipe.  Thanks!

OMG!  This is the best bar b q sauce ever!  This is even better than Blue Front Bar B Que Sauce!  Thank you so much for this!  I scaled it back to 20 servings and I didn't have chili powder.  I substituted cumin and it was fab!  Dooooo make this!

Bangin' good. Unfortunately, because the ingredients are kind of obscure, it's really not any cheaper to make your own than buy some Sweet Baby-Rays. Regardless, it's some of the best I've had. Try it with pulled pork. It's awesome!

I am sold!  I will not buy bottled sauce again!  This sauce has the perfect sweetness followed by a kick.  If you want to be a BBQ star, follow this recipe exactly as written, Big Al knows his stuff!

Served to a group of about 30 and they all raved - followed directions exactly for one pulled pork pot and spiced up a little extra for another pot and warned everyone.  Best recipe I have ever tried.

Followed recipe exactly and it was pretty good -it had a little spice to it!  Once it was on the meat it didn't seem spicy at all so next time I'll add a little more heat.

The whole family liked this sauce. I made it to use on ribs.  It was fairly quick and easy.  I didnt have celery seed so I used about 1/2 teaspoon of celery salt.  I also cut the liquid smoke back to 2 teaspoons.  Figured I could add more later if needed.  We'll definitly be using this recipe over and over again.  Thanks Big Al

Very nice sauce.  I used white vinegar for wine vinegar as I didn't have.  Otherwise, very nice mild sauce.

We thought it was alright.  A bit too sweet for my liking.  This makes ALOT so be warned.  I would say it makes as much as a whole bottle of sauce.

This was so good. We use a ketchup without corn syrup and this helped us find a bbq sauce that we could use it in. Won't buy bottled again.

Big Al, you are my hero.  This sauce is amazing.  I recently returned from a business trip to KC where every meal consisted of BBQ in some form.  I tried a lot of sauces and this one is as good as (or better than) any I tried.  This BBQ sauce goes well with any kind of meat (burnt ends, chicken, sausage, pork, etc.)  Thanks again for a great recipe

Made it to a "T" and thought it was absolutely wonderful!  However, we like things really spicy down here in New Mexico so I added 2 1/2 times the cayenne and doubled the garlic and onion powder.  That made it more spicy to our taste buds!  Great recipe!!  You've cured me from the bottle!!

WOW absolutely amazing!  I didn't use any liquid smoke because I couldn't find any!  And it still turned out unbelievably delicious!  Made baby-back ribs with it -- I dont eat meat but I got rave reviews!!! :D  I also dipped my veggie pizze into it... yumm!!

By chance, I found liquid smoke at the grocery store so I am thrilled to make it again!

I also love the way that you can make this recipe a guidline, and cater to your own tastes with as much or as little as you want of a spice -- also, you can control the consistency of the sauce as well.  I like mine extra thick!

I didn't have any tomato sauce, chili powder or celery seed. I omitted the spices and added a bottle of beer to replace the tomato sauce(my husband thinks everything tastes better in beer or wine, I tend to agree). While I was looking for some of the ingredients my 3 year old son, who likes to be involved in the cooking, added worcestershire sauce, I couldn't tell you how much, but I am cooking ribs in my second batch of sauce and I added about 2 tablespoons this time! Great recipe, I am sure it would be better with the right ingredients!

Very excellent. I didn't even use the liquid smoke, though I have to say I think it would have enhanced it. Also, it was a bit sweet for my tastes, so next time I would reduce the brown sugar. But that's the beauty of this recipe--the basic recipe is relatively simple, but creative, and allows for lots of personal adjustment.

Made the recipe exactly as is, seems not many people do. Every review I read changes something. The sauce was good! It was a little too sweet for my taste but I'll add fresh garlic and onion and cut back on the brown sugar or molasses next time. Had leftover fresh ham roast, turned into pulled pork with this this recipe. Would be five stars if not for the sweetness. Great recipe though, with a cutback on the sugar elements. Thanks!

I think this had a good base to it, but I needed to adjust somethings to really make it pop. First, there is too much vinegar for me, I'd cut it to about 3/4 cup. Still not quite right, so I added a bit of tomato paste and some more spices. I threw some chicken with thick slices of onion into a crockpot and marinated for about 3 hours. Delicious.

Awesome!  Sweet and spicy sauce.  I added about 6 shots of tabasco for a half recipe.  The kids loved it, and i'll definitely be making it again.

I made this sauce and used it on a pulled pork recipe I got off of here and my family loved it! I didn't have tomato sauce so I used tomato paste and added water to it. I didn't have the molasses either so I used honey in its place. My family never likes my food but they have talked about how great this was all week. We all loved it!

As everyone has noted, this is a GREAT recipe.  We'd just come back from a vacation in NYC, and had a very nice KC sauce at Blue Smoke Restaurant (I know, I know, but it was really good).  After adding cumin and some tamarind paste to this recipe, and maybe 50% more liquid smoke, we duplicated the Blue Smoke KC sauce.  Better?  Maybe, maybe not; just different.

After making this sauce I vowed never to buy Bar-B-Q sauce again, in the bottle or from a professional Bar-B-Q'er. It's very easy and next time I will double the recipe. I made ribs in the crockpot, this weekend it's a pork roast.---Thanks Al

This was really good.  I used Splenda brown sugar to help reduce the calories.  Oops I should've used less, cause it isn't a one to one.  Even with it a little sweet, it was still really good.

a nice base sauce to work off of...great for ribs.  A bit too much vinegar and ketchup for my taste, although a very nice sauce.

I'm not a fan of barbeque sauces containing molasses but this is quite good.
I first tried this sauce on salmon and it was very good.

A 5 Star Winner.......The Best....This sauce was excellent.  I made only one change.  Used about 1 cup of honey and no sugar.  This is a keeper.  Since it makes a large amount of sauce I kept out half and reduced it to use as the topping on a Texan pizza that uses BBQ sauce instead of pizza sauce.  Super excellent.....!

This was definitely the best BBQ sauce my family and I have ever tasted! I am never buying store-bought BBQ sauce again!  It's the perfect blend of sweet & spicy - and we like our BBQ sauce thick, so we just let it simmer on the store for several hours, and it was delicious!  Thanks for the post!!!

Absolutely delicious. I’ve never made bbq sauce before, so I don’t have much to compare it too, as far as home made sauces go, but everyone loved it. I’ve been wanting to make this recipe for a while, but didn’t really have an occasion to use it. Finally had a go at making pulled pork, in the slow cooker, so I figured today was the day. It was tangy, sweet, and slightly spicy. If you love spicy, I wouldn’t say it’s actually spicy, but more flavorful. If you aren’t use to really spicy foods, this may be a bit spicy for you. I added the sauce after shredding the pork, and it soaked in amazingly. I made a seven pound pork shoulder, and I could have dumped the whole pot of sauce on top, and it would have been great. Personally I have people who like less or more bbq sauce than others, so I added in batches, so they could enjoy it how they liked it. If you’re making this to brush on meat, or as a condiment, this makes quite a lot, so be prepared to store the leftovers, or scale the recipe down by half. I’ll definitely be making this again, but I may play around with the flavors, just to see if I can kick the spice up a notch, since I like a good amount of spice.

I will never again buy barbeque sauce, do yourself a favor and make this, exactly as is.  Best we've ever had.  My husband made ribs tonight not realizing we were out of sauce, so I found and tried this recipe.  As he stated "Would lick it off the bumper of our truck"

This was the second BBQ sauce recipe I have made and this was by far the best. It was a lot better than what I anticipated it to be. I will continue to use this recipe. The only thing I didn't do was add in the celery seed (because the store was sold out and I wasn't about to go treasure hunting for it, and I ran out of ketchup at 1.5 cups lol) But I like my bbq sauce real thick, so I simmered for 40 minutes (about 13 of which I had a lid on). Thank you for uploading this recipe!

I started my journey into smoked meats about 1 year ago. I have made several bbq sauces along my culinary travels, and also tried many store-bought sauces. For a pulled pork sandwich, I actually prefer a couple different sauces than this one. For everything else, I absolutely prefer this sauce. This is by far my favorite bbq sauce. I have made it at least 12 times, and it is always great. I think it is perfect as written. Do yourself the favor of trying it and enjoy!

I have been making this sauce, as written, for many years now.  The only thing I do different is to cook low and slow for several hours making the sauce thicker and richer. Friends and family don't bat an eye when they ask for a jar of this from me.

Great recipe. I did double the celery seed amount, added 2 tablespoons of cumin and a tablespoon of lemon juice. Definitely has that tang I like.

We love this stuff! I put just a pinch of the cinnamon and cayenne in, because i wanted those flavors to be quite indistinct.  Im using it for the pulled pork sandwiches at our wedding!

Made it exactly as the recipe says. I was actually looking for a vinegar tasting sauce that was tomato based. Even though it was highly reviewed,  I was skeptical about making it. Being from an area where BBQ is king, the standard is high. I'm pleased to say that it was better than I expected. I applied it to pork ribs that I cooked in the smoker and they were very good. I will be making this again.

Possibly the best heavy red sauce I've ever eaten. Beats anything I've had out of a bottle. Needs to be boiled and then set in the fridge for a day for taste and consistency. But worth it! I don't even like K.C type sauces and this was good. Turns out very sweet. Might want to bring down the brown sugar and molasses a little depending on your sweet tooth. Was great for me though.

My favorite BBQ sauce has always Sweet Baby Rays .......until now! This is one step above that. Flavorful, thick and ready to do damage to some chicken tonight. This BBQ is now my go to make at home and use forever. I only have one question, how long can I store this in the fridge and can you freeze it! THANK YOU

Perfect consistency for ribs or chicken. Was delicious as is- perfect combination of tangy, sweet, and a kick of spicy.  I made a pan of long, slow baked baby back ribs (light rub, tightly foil covered roasting pan, 200F oven for 3 hours). Glazed the ribs, put under broiler 5 min, re-glazed and broiled again 5 min. Perfect

Admittedly, I did not follow the recipe verbatim because I didn't have the exact ingredients, but it still tasted great! We don't buy ketchup (rarely use it at home), but have packages from restaurants in the fridge. I managed to come up with just under one cup of ketchup, so I halved the spices in the recipe. 

No tomato sauce, so used a 6 oz. can of tomato paste. 
No red wine vinegar , so used rice wine vinegar.
Reduced the cayenne a tad and added ghost pepper salt to taste in lieu of salt and pepper. I had everything else on hand, so I just used half of what the recipe called for.

Using tomato paste may have produced a richer sauce, but it worked beautifully. We basted hamburger patties with this just as they were put on the grill. Excellent results! Even though we made a smaller portion, there is quite a bit left after making eight burgers, so we will put it in the fridge and use again soon. Since it is spring, it probably won't be long before we throw something else on the grill. I will update after our next cookout!

Fabulous BBQ sauce.   I was lucky to find it because depending on whether you write BBQ, bar-b-que or whatever,  you won’t find all sauces.  I cut this recipe in half and still didn’t use but 1/2 of it on the chicken thighs I was barbecuing in the oven. Keeper- and I had all ingredients on hand !!

This was great...I don’t really like to use dry spice so I had another recipe that used fresh onion and garlic so I melted butter and sautéed a small onion for about 5-6 minutes and added a clove of garlic. Then followed through with the remaining recipe minus the cayenne pepper. It wa fabulous?? I used it to make the slow cooker pulled pork??

First time making homemade BBQ sauce.  Love the flavor!  I cut the recipe in half this first time but will make the full recipe from now on.  I opted to use a Mesquite spice that I purchased in a local spice shop as opposed to Liquid Smoke.  You still get the same smoky flavor without the chemicals.

I thought this sauce was great. I cut back on  brown sugar to only one cup, also I cut back on the vinegar and I added about one teaspoon of crushed red pepper. I make (foreign food) Brazilian/Moroccan/any kind of chicken then I finish it on the grill using the sauce. There is never any leftover. Of course using the sauce on any pork shoulder/ribs  or a brisket ... the taste is out of this world. Thanks for sharing

I give this a 10 star; that's how good this sauce is. I don't think this really needs anymore spice to it; but if you like your sauce with more of a kick, go for it.

This was my very first attempt at making a BBQ sauce from scratch.....and it came out WONDERFUL! My son is a very picky eater and he loved it. He also told me I'd better not buy any more BBQ sauces from the grocery store. The thing I liked most? I had all the ingredients in my cupboard, so I didn't have to worry about substitutes or tweaking this recipe. I followed it just like it was written and it's perfect. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Definitely a keeper recipe. I used apple
cider vinegar according to a few comments, added a teaspoon of dry mustard, chipotle pepper, and ancho chili pepper, as well, for more spice. I also omitted the brown sugar in one recipe to have a spicy but not sweet, the second batch I did all the same additions and the brown sugar for the sweet and spicy sauce. They turned out amazing! These will be my go-to bbq sauce recipes.

I really love this b.b.q. sauce, although I would seriously reduce the sugar. It's a little too sweet and not good for diabetics. I will make this again and add a little more spice.

At the risk of incurring the wrath of all the previous reviewers, I made this today and found it slightly lacking depth/body for lack of better descriptive words.  I left no ingredient out.  I followed the recipe to a T and adjusted it for 2 servings.  I had an open can of Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce that I thought might lend itself nicely to this sauce.  I only used one large pepper from the can mincing it up.  That did the trick.  It's a great recipe.

This is a super great BBQ sauce! I didn't have any tomato sauce but I did have a 14.5 oz. can fire roasted tomatoes. I drained the little bit of liquid it had. I then put it in my Ninja bullet and pulverized it. It was a little more than I needed, I only made 1/2 the recipe. Once it simmered the 20 minutes I poured the little bit of tomatoes left over in the pot. I don't know what the origami all recipe suppose to taste like, but mine turned out absolutely wonderful.

I lost my Celery Seed between the grocery store and my house, but even without it this was a kick- BBQ sauce. The perfect amount of Sweet and Tangy.

Fantastic!   The hickory smoke added an amazing flavour to it and so far I've used it on sausage, pork chops and chicken and it's been great on all of them!

I absolutely love this sauce. I double the recipe to can it and give it to friends(and extra for us!). I started using minced garlic instead of powdered and added a teaspoon of cardamom and it was amazing. I've also varied it with red pepper flakes for a spicier sauce. *** Word of advice *** I was out of red wine vinegar once and substituted apple cider vinegar. Bad idea. It was the only change I made to the original recipe, and it just wasn't the same.

I've been making this recipe for several years. Very good. I always get great compliments from all that try it. It's very versatile as well. I've added more cayenne for more heat, or none for very little. I've added bourbon for a bourbon flavored sauce couple times. I've used honey as well too. Also changed to apple cider vinegar in place of red wine.  Very good recipe to have!!!

Nice balance, but a twinge too much vinegar for me.  Still gave a 5 because as a brushing sauce, the vinegar is not as noticeable as if used thickly, which is how I used it.

OMG!! Awesome sauce!! I will definitely add this to my BBQ sauce arsenal, primarily for beef products. I made it exactly as the recipe instructed and it was good but maybe a little too vinegary for what I was looking for. Easy fix: add an additional 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar and it balanced it out perfectly...for me...

I did cut the hot spices in half so that the kids would still eat it and I also used about 1/4c hickory bbq sauce since I didn't have liquid smoke. This sauce is amazing!!!!

I made this recipe and did not realize what a big batch it was.  But I'm glad I did because we are using it up fast.  It is the best BBQ sauce I have ever had.  You can't find this quality at the store.  It made about 32 oz.

Will be the "go to" BBQ sauce. Using it for pulled pork this evening; using for BBQ chicken tomorrow. Made the "for 12" amount ( 1/4 recipe). Not too sweet, not too tart, not too spicy.
Nice flavor blend.

I've never made homemade bar-b-q sauce, and now I'm really upset with myself. This was amazing. Sweet with a subtle hotness that wasn't over bearing. Left me thinking "what can I make next to use this on?" I cut the recipe to 12 servings (why? I have NO idea) and I didn't have paprika so I added a little extra cayenne pepper. Will definitely make again! Thank you!

If you want an easy to prepare KC style BBQ sauce this is a good one to use as a base, then tweak as you experiment. I will make it again today since my first batch is now gone. I'm only going to back off on the cayenne because I over did it last time which was the only thing I didn't follow the recipe on.

I make a gallon of this sauce every month because I am hounded by friends and family constantly. I use it for all pot lucks and family get togethers. The only thing I change sometimes depending on the recipient is I only use 1/4 of cayenne pepper. If you make this, you will never buy BBQ sauce in a bottle again!!!

This was very good!  I guessed at the measurements and it came out great so you can't go wrong.  Due to lack of some ingredients, I substituted the following:  liquid smoke with smoked paprika, tomato sauce with tomato paste and water, and molasses with honey.

I Iove this sauce.   I did omit the liquid smoke and decreased the red wine vinegar to only 1 cup.     It made my pulled pork BBQ delish and the entire family enjoyed.

I followed exactly as stated but I kind of tweaked it a little bit by adding a couple of tablespoon of lemon juice just to cut down on the sweetness other than that it was delicious.

Excellent. Very tangy at the front, then it gets sweet and then you get a nice kick! I used a heavy hand with all of the dry spices and also added red pepper flake. This gets spicier as it simmers. I simmered very slow and very low for a good hour to get a nice thick and awesome BBQ sauce for my pulled pork sandwiches. This is being canned and saved as my go to KC sauce!

I didn't have any celery seed, only celery salt :(  so I cut out the salt and used 1 1/2 tsp celery salt instead. Then I didn't have Chili powder so I used Chipolte powder & I substituted Northwest seasoning for Paprika.  It was Sweet & Spicy & my family loved it on my Baby Back Ribs & Boneless Chicken Breast for Salads.  I simmered longer than 20 min. to make it thick.  I would definitely make this again & possibly even double the recipe & jar it for the Summer months !!

I made this recipe exactly posted by Alan.   I made no alterations to the recipe. I simmered for 20 minutes.. and turned off the heat.. It has sat to cool off and cooled and in my opinion is it turned out perfect.  But who am I to know?   Barbecue is a very personal experience, so it hard to find two people to agree on whose or what's the best. But, just for the record. I'm  an Oklahoma Boy that grew up working  in a Beef and Pork processing  plant, so.. I've  cooked and eaten my fair share of Barbecue..  I'm giving this sauce an A+..  If I wanted to spice it up I might, just might add a 1/4 tsp of crushed red pepper.

I found this recipe a few months ago and have been making it every since. The 1st time I made it my husband noticed a difference and he loves it. Every once in awhile when I want a sweet sauce I add a little honey to it but other than that its perfect the way it is.

This is a great recipe. Tweak to your taste, of course, but it has all of the essential elements for a great bbq sauce.  My warning is to be careful not to overcook it. I thought I wanted it thicker so just kept simmering and simmering until it was the consistency I wanted but that ended up giving it a slightly burnt taste. My own fault of course, but I just wanted to point that out so other people don't ruin an otherwise almost-perfect batch of sauce!

This was so good my Sons both kept passing on the Famous Dave's Sauce and going with the home made stuff.   I was pretty impressed with it as well.   It is nice and tangy and works so good on any kind of grilled or smoked meat.

If I could give higher I would. I no longer buy from store. I did reduce the amount of red wine vinegar but this is easy to tweak to fit personal tastes.  Thanks

Love it! Sweet, tart and smoky. Cut the recipe in half and didn't use the tomato sauce. Just the catsup. Also left out the celery seed and cayenne pepper. Used apple cider vinegar in place of the wine vinegar. Did western style ribs.

JR is correct. This is better with half the vinegar and tomato sauce. Double spices, not sugar molasses or salt, substitute turbinado sugar for brown, and add 1/2 of a ghost pepper or one whole habanero, very finely diced. I use a razor blade until it is a paste. I used the same amount of liquid smoke as I have had bad experiences in the past with too much. This sauce will open your guests eyes WIDE OPEN. They will be begging for the recipe. Be very careful with ripe ghost peppers. ALWAYS use latex gloves and don't cut the glove.

This was great! Really yummy, on the grill now! I really like some spice, and I love the flavor of "El Pato" tomato sauce, so I used 1 cup El Pato, and one cup regular tomato sauce. The El Pato def gives nice depth and makes it nice and spicy. I also had no molasses, but I will try that next time. Really really good. I think the BF is in there drinking it now. My first venture into making my own BBQ sauce! Really easy!! Thanks for sharing!

Awesome. Used the sauce on a smoked beef brisket.  Coated both side when I hit 160 degrees and wrapped in tin foil. I placed in oven till internal temperature reached 200. Let rest an hour. Best tasting brisket ever. This sauce made it turn out so good.

Really, really loved this sauce!  It was easy to make and I had all of the ingredients on hand.  Used it on some baby back ribs and wish I had made more of it! No more bottled sauce for me!

I think this sauce is very good! I scaled the recipe to 24 servings and that gave me around 3 cups of sauce. I will definitely use this for all my barbeque dishes. Using 24 servings, I kept the 1 cup each of ketchup and tomato sauce, but opted for 1/4 heaping cup of brown sugar, 1/4 cup red wine vinegar, 1/4 cup molasses, 4-5 Tbsp liquid smoke, 1 tsp each of garlic and onion powders, 1 heaping Tbsp each of chili powder and smoked paprika, 1/2 tsp celery seed, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 3/4 to 1 tsp cayenne, and 1/2 cup water. I simmered this for about 45-50 minutes and it delivered just the right amount of sweetness and spice for my taste. I paired this with homemade Coffee and Bullion Pulled Beef and Chef John's French Fries.

Delicious! This will be the one and only  sauce I make from now on. I used home made pasta sauce for the tomato sauce and did not add the liquid smoke, mustard seed instead of celery seed as that is what I had on hand with a dash of celery salt.

Great sauce. I've finally found the perfect BBQ sauce.  I added more cayenne pepper but that's pretty much a personal touch depending on one's taste.  It's definitely a keeper!!

I have always made my sauce from scratch with Ketchup and brown sugar and whatever other things sounded good and it always came out good, but this stuff is great! Wonderful flavor, easy to do, and makes my ribs even better. I don't even change the recipe (much).

VERY good sauce! I'm not a big fan of molasses so I did not include it in my initial batch. The second time I made it I added a whole tea spoon of crushed red pepper vs. the 1/2 that it calls for just to give it a little more kick.

Loved this recipe for a sweet and slightly spicy BBQ sauce. I made a few changes.... Doubled the garlic & chili powder, added finely chopped 1/4 small onion instead of onion powder, added about 2 TBL Worcheshire sauce and 1 TBL mustard and about 1 tsp chili flakes. Also a little bit extra salt (sorry-- didn't measure) Everyone loved it!! The cinnamon is an ingrediant I had never used in BBQ before but it really adds to the flavour.

This was great on ribs. Not hot!  I tweaked it a little bit and added fresh garlic, and onions. I would for sure make this again.  Oh yeah put lots of cayenne pepper if you like it hot or maybe chili peppers.

This recipe is soooo good, I did tweak it a little, I cut the brown sugar by 1/2 cup and used raw apple cider vinegar. It added a little zip and heat, like I said soooo good.

Made this sauce exactly by the recipe. Used it on Bar-B-Q chicken breasts, on the grill. Was excellent. As good or better than any I have bought in the past.

My husband who is picky about BBQ sauces said this was the best one he has ever tasted.   It made my vegan sloppy joes delicious, even though the sloppy joe recipe I used was less than great. I will be using this a lot even though I almost never eat meat.

This sauce is excellent. Better than KC Masterpice, which I consider the standard for commercially produced BBQ sauce.  Fits in 2 quart-sized mason jars. Thanks for sharing

Fantastic BBQ sauce. I make it just as written, but simmer for closer to 40-60 min as I like it thicker. I freeze half and keep the other half in the fridge. It makes a lot, but we get through it all because it's so tasty!

Made this delish recipe today.. Yum!!! I modified it slightly(1 1/4 c.cider Vinegar and 1 1/2 c. dark brown sugar)I also substituted Mesquite Smoke flavoring for the hickory. It came out amazing and is so tasty and thick. I actually canned 8 quarts of the sauce as we use a lot of bbq sauce in my household. I'm hooked on this recipe!!!

I made it almost exactly as written in the receipt, the only exception was I was out of celery seed, so I used celery salt instead of the celery seed and salt. I was really glad I waited to taste it after it had simmered for a while because the sweetness really came through nicely. It was thick, and made quite a bit, I'll definitely make this one again!

Great recipe used on baby back ribs.  I cut the recipe in half, used rice vinegar instead of wine vinegar (didn't have wine vinegar), added 1 1/2 tsp of maple syrup and 1 1/2 tsp of Worcestershire sauce to the recipe.  Consistency was perfect.

This is my first time making BBQ sauce and I am glad I did. Made this recipe exactly as written, except I added 1/2 tsp dried mustard, only 1/3 cup mollasses, and 3 teaspoons of liquid smoke because my husband and I aren't big on strong smokey taste. 
This is a nice taste of tomato/sweet/spicy/smoky/tangy goodness. 
I will make this again, but next time I will add only 2 tsp. liquid smoke as I think this would be good for our taste. VERY YUMMY...thx for posting!

Way too vinegary.  Tried it twice as directed (except didn't have liquid smoke) but still tasted way too much vinegar. Sauce a bit too runny also.  Has potential but needs major changes.  Won't try it again.

For the 4th, we smoked chicken parts and country-style ribs (after using a KC dry rub) and then finished them off with this sauce. We stuck to the recipe exactly, and our guests were asking for a taste while it was simmering because the aroma was unbelievable. We cooked it for about an hour, and it turned out thick and delicious. We just used some of the leftover sauce for some pulled chicken, and the flavor was even better. No more bottled sauce for us since we'll be using this as our go-to BBQ sauce. Thanks Al!

This is an awesome BBQ Sauce!
I made a half batch (24 servings) to try this out on some grilled chicken and pork ribs.
I didn't have tomato sauce on hand, so I used 3 ounces of tomato paste and 1 cup of water. Otherwise I made as directed. Simmered about 30 minutes stirring often to get to my desired thickness.
I am thinking of making the full recipe the next time, but am uncertain how long this will store in the refrigerator.

This is so awesome. Al this should have been a secret and not revealed.....  But being as you are so kind and sweet and shared it look at how many people are gaining your SECRET.  I have never had anything even come close to this and for the person that compared it to Sweet Baby Rays (yuk not even close period). You know the way to a womans heart is thru her stomach. I will never lose this recipe and will remember Big Al forever!  Many thanks for sharing this recipe.

I left out 1/4 cup of the brown sugar, 1/2 of the salt, and didnt have onion powder so I minced 1/4 of a small onion and added it to the mix.

Awesome!! Better than any store-bought.  Made it just like the recipe says, except used regular vinegar instead of the wine vinegar.

I cannot give this recipe enough stars. My husband and I own a Traeger and make this sauce all the time to put on pulled pork, chicken, pancakes....(just kidding)! But it really is that good. Many people have requested this recipe from us after tasting it. We cannot eat bottled BBQ sauce anymore. Totally worth the extra time.

By accident I thought this recipe was great with just a 1/2 cp of brown sugar (I couldn't imagine adding all of it), no vinegar, no cinnamon, paprika, salt or pepper. Instead of celery or onion powder cut the onion in 8ths and two small celery stalks into thirds. I also used one fresh clove of garlic quartered instead of dried. If you don't like the chunks it's easy to fish them out. At the end I decided to add 4 generous dashes of the vinegar and it was superb to me. Best barbeque I think I've ever made. I don't think you would need as much sugar in the recipe if you cut down on the vinegar. I prefer to use as little sugar as possible in my diet.

This is a great recipe!! This is the 3rd time making this sauce and it has become a hit. I have bumped up the spice for a bit more bite. I don't even buy store bought anymore. I am going to keep tweaking and make this one my own. THANKS FOR A GREAT BASE!!!!

Great BBQ sauce...my husband kept saying it smells like vinegar (I only put 1 cup) but once I put it in a Rachael Ray meatball recipe and gave him a side for dipping, he loved it. :) 
He has only lived in states for 2 years and never liked bbq sauce until now. I omitted celery seed because of another review, only 3 teaspoons of smoke and I thought I had garlic powder so instead added some grilling steak spice. Had to put a lid on the saucepan because the sauce was spitting out, had it on very low for about 25-30 minutes. Thank you for the recipe.

I wasn't sure I'd like homeade BBQ sauce, but this was wonderful! After cooking on my meat you really could tell it wasn't from a bottle. I had to make a few changes because I didn't have a few things. I don't keep liquid smoke around but I put Chipotle powder instead and it got that nice smokey hot taste still. I also didn't have the full amount of vinegar it was just under a cup. Other than that I stuck to it. I was afraid of the cinnamon..not a big fan but once cooked and with the pork WONDERFUL! I'm going to use it this weekend on my usual pull pork. That recipe is already perfect but it will be interesting to see what this brings to it.

I made this sauce over the weekend to put over pulled pork.  It was actually really good.  It has a sweet, bold and spicey flavor.  I only gave it 4 stars because I prefer a sweeter sauce.  It was pretty bold and I'm thinking it was because of the liquide smoke.  To make it more to my taste I added a little more brown sugar, a little more molasses and some honey.  After that simmered, It was just the way I like it.  It was very good without the extras that I added.  Enjoy!

Love this!! I halved the recipe and cooked on the stove for a few hours to get it really rich and thick. Even though I halved it I still had plenty to slather a full rack of ribs and some left over.

I've canned 3 batches of this already, but added 1/3 cup bourbon whiskey to it.  Also doubled the garlic,onion,pepper, and celery seed.  Made the first batch exactly as written and it's still 5 stars.   Thanks!

A real keeper!  Smells great simmering in the kitchen (which is always a plus), and it's a dark, thick sauce that is a true pleaser.  Easy and quick to make, but tastes like you worked on it all day.  Has just enough bite to it to make it good, but it's not overwhelming.  Just GOOD!  Thanks for sharing!

This is really, really delicious. I did not have liquid smoke so used some Worcestershire sauce instead. Used the sauce with the Southern style pulled pork recipe on this site and it is so good, I couldn't stop sampling it. Also freezes and keeps well.

By far the best BBQ sauce I have ever made, perhaps best I have ever tasted.  Perfect blend of spice, bite and smoke.  Great character and viscosity.

We have an odd Christmas on odd years and this year we had Canada Day in December. What better way than to have a bbq. I precooked the ribs and froze them in the bbq sauce and thawed for bbqing. I got rave reviews. Thanks a million. The only thing I changed was less brown sugar and little more molasses. Also left out the cayenne pepper because of all the kids, I don't think I needed to.

We followed this recipe exactly, with the exception of the celery seed.  Because I don't like the flavor it adds, I didn't have any on hand.  It's a very tasty sauce, but a little bit sweet for our tastes.  However, we added a splash of cider vinegar and a little extra tomato sauce, and that fixed the problem.

The best BBQ sauce I've ever had.  My husband and I tried this recipe, and now we can't buy BBQ sauce at the store.  A very easy recipe.  We store the BBQ sauce in the fridge to use later.  I left the cayenne pepper out and it was just fine.  If you like a sweet tangy sauce, this is the one.

I found this sauce to be really really good!! I stuck to the recipe exactly except didn`t have celery seed.  It cooked up wonderfully and tasted delicious.  I have used it on ribs and chicken sofar and look forward to using it again.  It has a wonderful full smoky flavour with a nice thickness to it.  Thanks for sharing a great BBQ sauce!!

Oh my goodness!  You can stop looking for BBQ sauce recipes. This is it! It is a cut above any BBQ sauce I've ever made. I made it as written. Everytime I even think about this sauce, my salivary glands go into overdrive. Unforgettable!

This is by far, the best barbeque sauce in the world! I will use nothing else but this for our pulled pork sandwiches. This is one of those recipes that doesn't need any tweeking. Use as is and you'll have some happy eaters!

This is a great recipe. Even though I used white vinegar (which made the sauce a little sharper than it probably would be with the red...), I thought it was great. Upon a second try, I cut down the vinegar (as I still didn't have any red-wine vinegar), and added about 1/2 tsp of cumin (this was in a 24 serving recipe), which turned out quite well, adding just a little more flavor to this, already great, recipe. Thanks!

Thanks for sharing your recipe.  I was short a couple ingredients - the smoke & celery seed, but it still worked out great.   Everyone enjoyed it, including my husband - that never eats BBQ sauce!

Fantastic recipe - very easy to throw together with things I keep in the pantry anyway.  My kids LOVE this sauce more than anything I can buy in a bottle!  It's also easy to adjust the seasonings and sweetness to taste.  Thanks!

I did everythine to the T on this recipe except did 2x as much cayenne pepper. Reason being is that when i had it on low waiting for it to get thicker, I taste tested it and didn't find a bite to it at all.. I like a SMALL amount of bite. when I was done, it was still mild.. Gotta double the cayenne pepper. IMO.. Which I could get it thicker tho.. any advice in that?

Great basic recipe!  I never would have thought of using red wine vinegar.  I did add a little more brown sugar.  Also, for a great southern touch, add a thinly sliced lemon (remove seeds) and one onion cut into eighths and simmer for an hour.

Very sweet and spicy at the same time.  I did simmer it for about an hour to thicken it to the consistency that we like.  Made this sauce and the "Bourbon Whiskey BBQ Sauce" from this site.  We liked this sauce but preferred the Bourbon sauce.

I reduced the recipe to 12 servings, so this may have altered the results.  My husband and I thought it was pretty good, but I need to try it again (making a full recipe) before I make a final decision.

I am giving this 5 stars although I omitted the liquid smoke. This recipe is great without it. I also added a dash of cumin.It needed a little longer cooking time to get the consistency I liked.used it on baby back ribs that were marinated over night.

Very good, easy recipe that will replace any good familiar name brands, but home made that can be modified to your liking.  It's slighty sweeter than I like.

Love it!  Did a test run tonight for July 4th with the BBQ Pork for Sandwiches recipe- I will definitely make this for the party!  I made it exactly as stated- and it's wonderful- not sure why I've been using bottled stuff for so long!

This sauce is sweet and delicious.  I use it mostly on chicken, since it reminds me of a BBQ chicken dish from one of my favorite restaurants.  I use another BBQ sauce from this site (bourbon) on pork and beef since it's a little less sweet.

This is really good bbq sauce. I used this on chicken with the dry rub recipe. It was the best I have ever grilled. Everybody loved it. Excellent on everything I have tried it on. It makes a bunch so make sure you have something to store it in.

What a fantastic sauce! I had my first attempt at making BBQ beef brisket recently and thought I'd serve this sauce on the side. Rave reviews! Even by those who claimed not to like BBQ sauce.  Absolutely delicious!

Best BBQ sauce EVER! I like it better with a little less liquid smoke than the recipe calls for. It's also delish if you cut back on the molasses and add honey. I have better luck gradually sweetening it so it doesn't get too sweet.

This sause is AWESOME!  I've made other BBQ sauces found on this site and none compared!  I followed the recipe exactly except for the celery seed because I didn't have any.  I substituted with celery salt and omitted the salt called for.

This recipe really is as good as everyone says.    I reduced the recipe by 4, and this made plenty of sauce, enough to fill a 16 oz bottle.  The only changes I made were in eliminating 1 tbsp sugar (I used raw sugar), and by adding 1/4 tsp mustard powder and a dash of allspice.  I didn't have celery seed, so I left it out.  I also used organic ketchup, which I feel gives it a better flavor, as it is made with raw sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup.  I have used the recipe as a dipping sauce for grilled steak and also on bbq chicken pizza.  The sauce was amazing in both cases.  The sauce was so good that I am now making another batch to use on baby back ribs.

I made this without the smoke flavour as I don't have any right now and LOVED IT. I put it on BBQ'd hamburgers - great. I put it on pulled pork - fabulous. I put it on beef and veggie BBQ'd kebobs - very good. Easy to make and well worth it. Will be making many times!

This was a good and easy BBQ sauce.  I spread it on some link sausage just before it was done cooking and it was great.  Kansas city bbq sauce is a little sweet for me but if that is what you want this is definetely your recipe.  Very easy and un-time consuming.

I have tasted many homemade sauces before and just wondered... what's the point?  I now am a believer.  I tasted the sauce while on the stove and felt a shiver of flavor satisfaction surge through my body... not an experience I have ever had before.  This sauce is perfect.

Really good!  To much hickory for me though.  I will change it a bit, but for sure will be used again!

Not like this recipe need more raves, but it's good. Damned good.  I didn't have everything so I altered a few things. Used a bottle of Guinness vs. 1 1/4 c. vinegar and only 3/4 c. red vinegar. Used raw garlic vs. powder. (what can I say I don't like vampires?)  The flavor is amazing and the heat builds in your mouth and tingles your tongue. It's not enough to burn, but enough to sizzle a little. I plan on slow cooking turkey legs in the sauce...we'll see how it turns out!

This is an excellent Bar-B-Q sauce. I followed the recipe exactly the first few times. I have since added my own twists to it. I used dark honey instead of molasses and used a mesquite smoke instead of hickory. I can't tell you how much my family and I enjoy this. I used it all the time! We have stopped buying sauce now. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Great sauce. This has been my go-to sauce recipe for a year now and will continue to be. I make a double batch and bottle it. Very tangy and sweet and better than any thing you can buy!

I've searched for awhile looking for a good tomato-based BBQ sauce.  Usually, I end up adjusting store-bought sauces - particularly Sweet Baby Ray's (my favorite store-bought).  Big Al's kicks every sauce I've tried to make out of the water!!!  I always eyeball, though I kept pretty much to the recipe when it came to "cups" of stuff.  I used it on spare ribs this time.  Next time, I'm going to make the full quantity of sauce (I halved it this time) and freeze the excess.  I'll use it on anything I might normally "BBQ" and I think I'll try it for my next Sloppy Joes.  I might even try it for future Asian BBQ recipes, changing it slightly to match that style.  Even my 13 yr old son liked it, and he doesn't care for BBQ.  Some folks recommend changing it a bit, but I kept to the recipe (except for the eyeballing), and it rocked!

We LOVE this sauce.  My family wont use any other BBQ sauce.  I use 1 tsp cumin instead of liquid smoke & sometimes add honey to change it up... any way I make it everyone loves it!

This was very easy to make. I did not have red wine vinegar so I had to substitute apple cider vinegar and it tasted fine. Its kind of like KC Masterpeice with some yummy vinegar tang to it. I liked this a lot, I used to to make pulled pork sandwiches in the crockpot. Im pretty sure I wont be buying bottled sauce again :)

A very nice sauce. I choose not to use liquid smoke and cayenne. Instead, use a heaping teaspoon of chipotle powder. You still get the smoke and the heat with this simple substitution.

This sauce is absolutely fantastic! I don't think I'll ever use store bought sauce again.  We eat it all the time with pork BBQ and I can't wait to have it on grilled chicken or ribs. It's very very easy to make and so good! The perfect compliment of sweet and spice. Thanks so much for sharing!

I love this sauce!  It is just like the sacues the best bar-b-q restaraunts from where I grew up would serve.  I added more garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and chipotle pepper because I felt it was a little too sweet, but when this simmers it tends to pick up more of the spices flavors so be careful.  To make a hot version I plan to add dried red pepper flakes.  Wonderful recipe!  I love it; Thank you.

I am finally done searching for a homemade BBQ Sauce.  This one is perfect.  Although I didn't have red wine vinegar, I used 3/4 cup of white vinegar and 1/2 c. of Sherry.  Didn't seem to mess it up, as the flavor was awesome.  I used this sauce to make BBQ pork sandwiches, and still had some left to store.  You gotta try this BBQ Sauce. Thanks for such a great recipe!

This is the first BBQ sauce that I have made. Followed it all the way through and added a little more salt and cayenne pepper to taste and simmered about 45 minutes.  AWESOME, AWESOME sauce!! I made it for a cookout my wife and I had this summer. It looked so good when I read it that I decided to double it!  I got great complements from the sauce! I am surprised Big Al released the reciepe from his resturant. I would have kept this a secert! Goes GREAT with ANYTHING!!  Good job Al !!!

Awesome sauce! I was short on ketchup (only 3/4 cup) and was out of tomato sauce. I added an 8-ounce can of tomato paste to the ketchup and balanced out the thickness by adding Southern Comfort to reach 2 cups (I was splitting the recipe in half). I skipped the vinegar since I added alcohol. I left the spice amounts as-is in the full recipe. When it was done, I took 1 cup of it and added 1 cup of applesauce for Ted Reader's pork chop recipe. Delicious!

This barbeque sauce is delicious! It is the perfect balance of sweet and spicy smokiness! I used it to make BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwiches and I highly recommend the combination!

One of the best sauces I've ever tasted! I followed the directions to a T except the liquid smoke because i couldn't find it in our local grocery store.  I used the sauce in the slow cooker with some chicken for delicious shredded bbq chicken sandwiches.  Will most definitely use this recipe again and again!

Very good!  Made exactly as directed except simmered mine quite a bit longer as I like a thick barbeque sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!!! My husband and I had a rib cook-off competition to see who could make the best ribs. We invited lots of family members over to be our guinea pigs/judges. The majority agreed that Al’s sauce (with my rib cooking skills...haha) was the best. It was a fun day, and now I have a great BBQ sauce recipe for my ribs.

Wow! I just made this bar-b-q sauce and I cannot stop taste testing!  It is sweet, but spicy (but not too spicy) and the color is gorgeous.  The only ingredient I did not use was the liquid smoke and this only because I'm in Europe and it's not readily available.  But I'm sure it would make it just that much more delicious.  I will definately make this sauce again.

I love this bbq sauce, I make it all the time now. I am no longer buying store brands as they all have high fructose corn syrup in them, so I needed a good replacement. This is way better than any store brand.

It was so good I didn't even care if my husband liked it! (he loved it, thankfully.) I made a half batch, cooking it in the crock pot with some beef shoulder. It made incredible pulled beef BBQ sandwhiches! 

I also made a few changes based on what I had on hand. I used honey instead of molasses and because we love honey! I also had half a jar of pasta sauce I used instead to tomato sauce and it was tasty with extra Italian seasonings. I think I will stick with this exact mix again next time.

INCREDIBLE! I followed the recipe exactly, except splitting it in half. It still made plenty. Highly recommend using this as the sauce for "BBQ Pork for sandwiches" found on this site. The two recipes combined taste like BBQ you would get in a good restaurant. When the recipe was cut in half, I still had plenty of sauce for 4 pounds of pork. I divide into serving sizes for my family, put in freezer bags, and reheat for a super-easy and delicious meal.

Wow, this sauce is pretty fantastic. I'd never made a BBQ sauce before and was very impressed with the taste and the texture. I omitted the celery salt because I didn't have it and I didn't think it was missing. I suggest simmering for 30 minutes and prepare the night before you plan to use it. After 30 minutes, I thought the liquid smoke taste was too strong. but after being left overnight in the fridge, the flavors seemed to meld overnight. It was a true hit.

This is a keeper in my house.  I grilled pork tenderloin with this sauce while my uncle visited and he asked for THREE helpings.  I used honey instead of molasses just b/c I didn't have any molasses but I will try molasses some time.  Absolutely delicious.  Thank you.

I ran out of BBQ sauce and went with this recipe. Everyone liked it. I was missing a key ingredient, molasses. So I threw in the closet thing (in color) I had, which was dark corn syrup. Oh well! It was still really good and we all liked it!

I made this sauce with some sliced German sausage made by our local BBQ restaurant. I am really picky about my BBQ sauce, this stuff was GOOD! I simmered it a little longer and added a splash of beer, it seemed to meld the flavors. The german sausage blended really well with the tangy sauce. YUM.

This is the best BBQ sauce you can make.  It's easy to substitute for items you may not have (i.e. apple cider vinegar for red wine vinegar).  It is absolutely delicious.  The only changes I make are that I add more garlic to the sauce.  Other than that, it is perfect.

I use to make my own homemade BBQ sauce, but never wrote anything down. Sometimes it would be to spicy and other times it would be just sweet.

This sauce makes a good mix of all my defunct creations. Been trying it on different meats and loving it for everything.

I used this on "barbecue pork for sandwiches".  It was really good.  At first you taste the sweet, then the hot sneaks up on you.  Neither is overwhelming.  It makes a ton of sauce.  I didn't think it would be too much but I still have enough for about 4 more recipes in my refrigerator.

This must simmer for a couple of hours to make it thicker.  If not, it is a very thin sauce.  I also cut down on the hot spices.  Doctored to taste.

A great representative of Kansas City BBQ sauce. I made a half recipe and the only change was subbing in Balsamic for Red Wine vinegar and cutting the vinegar amount slightly. This was great with slow smoked baby back ribs. And, even better slathered and warmed on left over rib meat sandwiches. Super sauce!

This sauce is simmering on my stove right now and I must say, I'm really REALLY impressed. My family does an annual rib cook-off and I've never entered before despite the fact that I love to cook. BBQ has always been for the boys. :) Not this year! I LOVE this sauce and it hasn't even sat overnight yet. When you first taste it, it's a little sweet but then the spices kick in and it balances out really well. It's not "hot," but there's the tiniest bit of a kick (TINY), however, if you have kids or really just don't like anything at all tangy, cut back on the various peppers. I did NOT add the butter because I wasn't sure how well it would keep, but may add a bit before serving. It's delicious without, so why bother!? I'll try to remember to update this review tomorrow when we have this on ribs for dinner to see if it keeps the same balance. (My family is southern and there's no such thing as BBQ sauce without mustard in it, but I resisted the temptation to add it. Try the recipe as-is first. I think you'll find the interesting blend of spices and the vinegar take care of the impulse to add mustard.) ENJOY!

Great base BBQ sauce. I recommend making a large amount and freezing it. Note: It doesn't freeze solid, but bags worked in the freezer for me. This is the second time I have made this recipe and it is definitely a keeper. I made the following adjustments: no butter, 1/4 tsp celery seed, 1 tsp cayenne, and 1-2 chipotle peppers. I left the butter out and had no problems.

This is an amazing sauce and really easy to make.  And it freezes well.  We won't be buying bbq sauce anymore and it is a good way for me to use my home canned tomatoes.  Love it!

I made this last night and I was worried that it had too much vinegar, but after it cooled in the fridge all night it turned out awesome!  I put more cayan for some extra kick and used honey instead of molasses.  I used this on Sarge's EZ Pulled Pork BBQ from this site and both turned out amazing!

It was a little sweet. I had halved the recipe, so I added some of the tomato sauce I ahd left in the can and a clove of fresh garlic. Was tasty in the saucepan, but AMAZING once it caramelized on the pork ribs on the grill. Thanks for the awesome recipe.

The flavour was fantastic, although I thought it was a bit heavy on the ketchup to the point where it left an an after-taste. I will go lighter on the ketchup next time. The over-all flavour was so good though, I wouldn't think of giving you less than 5 stars. Thank you for sharing!

We halved the recipe and put the sauce in the crockpot over a cut up 5lb pork shoulder roast. Wow, that was the best pulled pork sandwich ever. You know the food is good when there are 3 small kids sitting at the table but all you hear is silence! As the others have said, I'll never buy a bottle of bbq sauce again!

A Slice Of Heaven!!!! I saved this recipie many moons ago. Today, I tried it. This was GREAT. I had some chicken leg quarters that I dry rubbed and put on my smoker, that's another show. Anyways, this b.b.q sauce came out beyond expectations. 
 I'm a yankee from western Pa. that is now hailed as a B.B.Q King that just happened to be born in the north. In part of this recipe was a factor. Good job Big Al. Yense (Pa. for y'all) did great.

Excellent recipe. I thought the sauce was a bit sweeter than it needed to be, and sadly I had to make it without the liquid smoke, but if you need a quick and easy BBQ sauce, this one does the trick.

Phenomenal recipe! I use this for all my bbqing needs! 

I once used white sugar in place of brown sugar and molasses, and the difference in taste was negligible. 

Thanks!

I've been grilling ribs and chicken everyday since I found this recipe.  The changes I made: no tomato sauce, I used white vinegar, honey instead of molasses, and added 1/2 teaspoon of dry mustard to the sauce.  I also make a rub for the meats and marinate for 24 hours in foil before basting with barbecue sauce.
Kansas City Rub
1/4 cup brown sugar
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup or less salt
1/4 cup paprika
2 Tbspn garlic powder
1 Tbspn chili powder
1 Tbspn onion powder
sift ingredients and rub on meat

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!! We loved this and it is very simple, and in spite of what seemed to be alot of ingredients, I had every one in stock (except for the celery seed). It is sweet with a nice tang at the end, if you don't like really sweet, be sure to reduce the sugar a bit I guess. But we loved it. Thank you so much for sharing!

DH thought this was better than the store bought by far.  Kids thought that it was ok in small doses.

I refuse to buy barbeque sauce since the first or second ingredient is always HFCS so I decided on this recipe. With the exception of adding additional chili powder I didn't change anything and it was excellent. I might cut down just a bit on the vinegar next time, but otherwise leave everything alone.

This was a great bbq sauce, a nice combination of flavors.  Some of my bbq sauce connoisseur friends thought it was a little too sweet and didn't have quite enough "kick" to it, so I will add a little more chili powder and little less brown sugar to offset next time.  All in all I will stick with this recipe and try to make small adjustments to alter it to our tastes.

I used this recipe as stated in the recipe, with the exception of celery seed  (had none) and I used only 3 tsp of liquid smoke (you can always add more liquid smoke, but you can't take it out!). This make a nice, sweet, tomato based sauce with a yummy spice combo. It is flavorful but I would not call it spicy. It worked well for my purpose. This made about 5 cups of sauce for me. 

I used this for pulled pork. I made the pork in the crock pot, shredded it, and then mixed the pork with the sauce and heated to serving temp. It worked fantastic.

This is delicious and easy. No reason to buy bottle sauce again. I used tomato sauce in lieu of the kethcup (which I sweetened of course).

I didn't have molasses, so I substituted honey as a natural sweetener.  No liquid smoke, either, but this was STILL a 5 STAR!  I can't imagine how good it would have been if I had used these items!
