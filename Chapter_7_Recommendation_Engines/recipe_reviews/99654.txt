This is one of my favorite martinis--add some caramel syrup to the rim of the glass--a bit sticky but tasty!  Or you can even swirl some caramel syrup in the bottom of the glass before pouring the martini in--mmmmmm!  Also try throwing in a Maraschino cherry.

Really good mart....a bit too much sour apple for me (ended up using half the amount called for).  The end result was really good...headace material for sure.

Pretty good!  We set up a martini bar for our large get together on Easter, and this was one of the drinks we offered.  Of those who did drink the martinis, I think it was the second most popular.  Will definitely make this again - great summer beverage!  Thanks for the recipe.

I found this recipe in 2008, and my husband and I tried it on our honeymoon! WOW, very nice. Now we make it a tradition on our anniversary to have our cocktail together just like our honeymoon. Kudos to the chef! We love it, (obviously).

This is a great martini for those who don't care for a strong vodka taste.  You can't taste the vodka at all. It tastes like a candy apple- a very very grown-up candy apple!  All of my guests enjoyed it!

Good drink. Try adding cinnamon schnapps (to taste). I used .5 oz of Goldschlager.

LOVED it!  The hint of butterscotch was absolutely yummy!  It was too sweet for my hubby, but it has become my favorite!

Yummy!  This was a big hit with the girls.  I substituted apple vodka for the vodka + schnapps and then used cranapple juice.  Delish!

Very good. Very strong. Very sweet.

I could see how this would be good every now and then, but not for all the time.
It would be great for a Girls Night Out.
It tastes like a candy apple, only with a kick.
