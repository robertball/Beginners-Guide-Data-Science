I love these! My Mom has made this recipe every Christmas, and now I do too. They look pretty on a tray of assorted cookies. Something I do to make it easier to shape them into logs is to use empty aluminum foil boxes - the bigger size. I line the boxes with plastic wrap, sprinkle coconut on the wrap, then add the chocolate mixture. Sprinkle with additional coconut, close up the wrap and the box, put them in the fridge to cool, and you're ready to slice!

I love making these cookies for Christmas but I found you HAVE to use MARGARINE instead of real butter. When I used real butter, I didn't get a creamy texture and the marshmallows were really hard to coat. I still haven't found an easy way to apply the coconut evenly but they're still fun to make and even better to eat.

I tried this and I think the recipe needs to be a little more specific regarding what you do after you remove from heat. After following the directions, I read other recipes on this site for the same thing and it says to let cool. Then it goes on to say add marshmallows etc. So the marshmallows melted into the hot chocolate and the windows didn't look quite as they should. It also changed the taste

These were so simple to fix and tasted pretty good too. They are very very sweet though. I used unsalted butter and regular milk chocolate chips. The chocolate took a long time to melt over low heat (about 18 minutes) but it also did not melt the marshmallows as I was afraid it would. I don't have a double boiler I just used the lowest heat setting and stirred it often. I left out the nuts due to possible allergies as these were for gift trays. I rolled the logs up in waxed paper and froze them overnight. They sliced easily the following morning straight from the freezer. Thanks for the great recipe. This was the first time I've ever made these and they were so easy!

This is an old recipe my mom used to make in the 70's.  I melted the chocolate and butter carefully in the microwave (watched it closely) without any problems.  I also recommend letting the chocolate cool a little before mixing the marshmallows in (maybe 5 minutes).  I also added about 1/4 cup coconut into the mixture.  The recommendation from a previous rating to put them into wax-paper lined empty foil boxes (or cling wrap boxes, etc) worked great.  Also, I used semi-sweet chips and they were fine. And I omitted the nuts.  Yum!

First of all, I LOVE church window cookies but there are a few problems with this particular recipe. 1) I have never come  across a 16oz bag of chocolate chips, only 12 oz. And same for the marshmallows, they have always been 10 oz bags. 2) this recipe leaves a lot unexplained for the process of rolling the log. I also agree with another reviewer that margarine works much better than butter for this particular recipe, even though I am a huge advocate of using real butter otherwise.  If you go with the 12 oz bag of chips, 10 of marshmallow and use margarine, this recipe will come out perfect. Just make sure you heat  the chocolate and butter on a low setting so it doesn't burn, then it will harden and not mix well with the marshmallows.

I grew up with these cookies...my mom made them at Christmas time.  Everyone needs to try these, they are easy to make and taste great.

it's leaving out the part that you place about a cup or more of the mixture onto wax paper.  mold it into logs and roll up the wax paper and just twist the ends of the paper to seal it shut or you can use twist ties.

We love these!! I use powdered sugar instead of coconut though. I just spread a little bit out on wax paper, wrap it tightly into a roll (well multiple rolls) freeze for 10 minutes, and rewrap with a little more sugar and finish freezing. I also don't use nuts.

These are great!  Here are some tips for next year:  I melted 1/2 cup butter with 12 ounces semisweet chocolate chips in the microwave for about 2 minutes, stirring after 1 1/2 minutes.  I added about 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and let the chocolate mixture cool a few minutes, just so it wasn't molten hot.  Then I stirred in a 10.5-ounce bag colored miniature marshmallows.   I spread coconut  in a line onto three sheets of wax paper.   Then I scooped the marshmallow mixture along the lines to form a log.  Sprinkle more coconut on top, roll up the wax paper, and twist the ends.  I'm sure I used more than 2 cups of coconut, but I didn't measure it.  I like the tip about using a foil box, but I didn't have one.

I love these!  I have made them for years, I originally had them at my ex-mother-in-law's way back in the 70's.  Yesterday I made them with Jet-Puffed Fruit Mallows.  I think they turned out great and love the banana flavor in them!

I was so excited when I found this recipe... then I made it. Gloppy!  No where on the recipe does it say to wait to put the marshmallows in.  For this fairly inexperienced baker - very diappointing - People have to write recipes with even the obvious spelled out.  The only upside was that it still tasted good :) .  I will not be putting this batch in the cookie bags for my family this year.  I will try it again next year, though.

Great recipe. I have found that you have to let the chocolate cool. It's easier to handle. Also, someone said you HAVE to use margarine. I tried that and it was too watery. Best to stick with the butter.

So fun to make! I first learned how to make these in Bible School. Now, I'm teaching my kids. I use semi-sweet or dark chocolate chips. You don't have to do that, it's just a preferance of mine. Wicked sweet but the submitter is absolutely spot on. These are always the first treats to go!

Good!  They aren't cookies though--they're candy.  I had a hard time with my marshmallows melting and smearing so maybe next time I'll let my chocolate cool down a bit before folding in the mallows.  Thanks for the recipe!

I use a 12 oz bag of semi sweet chocolate chips and a 10 oz bag of colored marshmallows.    
and the best tip I found is to freeze them for a bit, then they are firm enough to slice,  and BEST TIP... use an electric knife for slicing!!  It works very well!  can even get thinner slices , without smashing the log!!

This is something I made all the time my kids were growing up during the holidays.. They loved them.. They are more like a candy than a cookie, but they are good and so easy!! Besides they really dress up your cookie platters..

My mom used to make something very similar to these every year for Christmas...minus the coconut and with a cookie crust in a 9 X 13 pan. They were always a favorite of mine they are pretty and so yummy...I might have to bring back the tradition and add the coconut to change it up a bit!

I've been making these for years, but hadn't for a few so I had to look for a recipe. I couldn't remember how much butter. I did change the nuts to dry roasted peanuts this year. My daughter is deathly allergic to tree nuts and I wanted her to be able to share them. She has no trouble with peanuts.  Also, I have never made them with any chips except semi-sweet. I was surprised to see several comments about letting the chocolate cool because in all the times I've made them, I've never had the marshmallows melt. I checked my chocolate after it was all melted and it wasn't nearly hot enough to melt anything! I put the chips and the butter in a glass bowl and heated in the microwave for 30 seconds, stirred, heated another 30 seconds, and stirred until it was smooth. It took a few stirs, but I once burnt chocolate chips (they turn to powder!) and I never melt them any longer than I have to. I discovered I didn't have any wax paper, but I did have freezer paper, so I used that and it seems to have worked perfectly. They are still in the freezer, but they are going to be excellent!

I really struggled with these cookies- I followed the recipe to the letter and there wasn't enough chocolate to hold the marshmallows and walnuts together in logs.  I ended up adding more chocolate and this was still just a mess.  The flavor is ok but INCREDIBLY sweet.

Made these at Christmas time. I love them but most recipes use raw egg. I am sceptical of using them. I made these with no substitutions. I was happy to find this recipe. They freeze well too. Thanks for a great recipe.

After looking all over the Internet for a recipe for Church Window Cookies (I remember these cookies from my childhood, made by my beautiful Aunt, and I so much wanted to make them for my children), I selected this recipe as it's so consistent with the others I found.  I followed the recipe to the letter but had less than desirable results.  The chocolate seized up and the marshmallows wouldn't incorporate into it; meanwhile, the residual heat melted them.  I managed to salvage the ingredients but my cookies look nothing like the adorable church windows in the recipe photos.  I think I'll try developing this recipe myself but tempering the chocolate.

I use coconut oil instead of butter and they turned out fantastic. I made them last Christmas and will make them this year again. They are delicious and look great on the cookie platter

I made them for a cookie exchange and I thought I made them as directed, but the logs looked more like the evidence of the reindeer having been there.  When sliced, they looked nothing like the picture.  The only difference I can think of is that I used the tiny marshmallows (like those in Lucky Charms) and maybe the chocolate wasn't cooled enough so they melted.  I'd rate them a 0.1 for looks and a 4 for taste.

Too many marshshmallows for this recipe made it a horrible one. Cut back to just a 10 oz. bag, not 16 oz. . Unfortunately I lost my original recipe

I made three different rolls. Rolled cold in nuts, smashed Graham crackers, and coconut. If you are not familar with these cookies, it is easy to get lost with this particular recipe. I just remember from childhood and watching how they were made.

I make a version of these every year, so did my grandma.  That's where I got the recipe.  She used to call them Window Pane Cookies, although not a cookie.  I love these, they are a tradition.

My mother has made these for as long as I can remember, the only difference is she puts in on wax paper and rolls it into logs and instead of coconut she sprinkles powdered sugar on them  when they are firm. ( Because I'm allergic to coconut)
