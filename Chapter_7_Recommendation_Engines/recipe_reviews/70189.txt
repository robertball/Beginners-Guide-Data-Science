This is delicious, we really enjoyed this for dinner. I chose to leave out the ham also. I had a problem with  the baking time and directions. I followed as written, but the center of the quiche was completely raw, and looked way too brown. I had to bake it 10 minutes more. I recommend just baking this for 20-25 minutes at 350 degrees and just skip the broiler step. If you do want it brown, broil for a minute at the very end, be sure to take it out of the oven immediately. Thanks for sharing :)

A very tasty recipe.  I did have trouble with the crescent roll dough; it kept sliding down the side of the pan when I was baking it.  Perhaps I overworked the dough when prepping it for the dish, as it was quite oily.  Next time I will use a traditional pie crust or simply make it without the crust.

I found directions for this recipe not clear.  "Turn oven to Broil and cook..." Does that mean you put the dish under the broiler?  Since "broil" was mentioned, I figured that is what it meant.  I did that and the to of crust became black. Why not just say to "turn heat up to broil but leave dish in place in oven", if that is what is meant? My guys said "too much spinach".

This is an excellent recipe!  I don't eat meat so instead sauteed mushrooms, broccoli and spinach.  I did not do the broil step just baked in the oven for about 35 minutes.  It was delicious!!!

Holy Cow, this recipe was the best ever. Everyone at the party thoroughly enjoyed it.  Cook time needs to be longer than 15 minutes.  I used a relatively deep dish and it took nearly 40 minutes before the middle was done. To the reviewer whose pie crust kept slipping...did you bake it first like the recipe called for?  I didn't have that problem at all.   I added some mushrooms in with the red peppers and smashed down the pie crust after it had baked (it fluffed up a bit).  Huge hit!!! 6 people are asking for the recipe. Glad to pass it on. Thanks so much. I will use this recipe countless times.

this was very good!  I didn't have all ingredients on hand, so used cottage cheese, parmesan cheese, green pepper and parsley.  The only thing was that the crust rim got too brown before the middle set (reason why 4 stars).  will definitely be making this again!

Super simple staple for a whole week worth of bfasts. After making this for a month, I refined this to a total of 4c rough-chopped veggies (my faves: spinach, onion, mushrooms, bell pepper) and ham to perfectly fit my quiche pan. Oregano adds extra flavor.

Deliciousness!!!
Followed the cooking instructions to a "T" & it turned out PERFECT!!
Our substitutions included:
*Frozen Tenderflake 1-2-3 crust (cooked per instructions here)
*breakfast sausages cut small, no other meat or veggies
*Lactose individual eating it, so cheese was -- Daiya Provolone (cut small) & shredded Daiya Mozzerella-style
*also eliminated hot sauce;

The Daiya (non-dairy/ non-soy/ non-gluten) "cheese" melts even better than dairy cheeses, so the mix of flavours - this, eggs, sausage - was absolutely divine.

Bake-to-Broil: We had no problems figuring this out -- left it on the rack & turned the knob. (It didn't SAY to move the rack, so...)
Oven off for 10 mins: Boy, did the quiche ever set! This is where it really works its "magic"!!
Follow the directions as they're written in ROSANNACANADA's recipe, and you should be just fine.  ENJOY!!!

This was great. I made a couple changes. I didn't bother with the crust. I used fresh spinach and freshly baked ham. I didn't have any red peppers or tobasco sauce, so I used some salsa and paprika. It came out great. Two people finished the entire quiche in two days!

I struggled with this recipe. The darn thing was on fire after two minutes on broil. The one inch of crescent roll hanging over was what caught fire. And then I realized it didn't cook in the time the instructions said.

So easy to make with the crescent rolls. My whole family loved it. We used sausage and broccoli instead of ham and spinach. My sister said she liked my version better then store bought.

This was quick to put together. I needed 9 servings so I made this in a 9x9 pan with about 1.5 tubes of crescent roll dough sheets. While the crust was baking I got the rest ready. I did squeeze the liquid out of my frozen spinach. I used the 6 eggs and did not increase because I wanted it to bake quickly. I added a can of mushrooms well drained. Baking time in my heavy ceramic 9 inch dish was 30 minutes. I did not broil.  I took this to a pitch-in brunch and got compliments.

Very yummy! Next time I will only pre-bake dough 7-8 minutes. In a large bowl I beat eggs then added all else plus a little dry mustard mixed, & poured over dough. Next time I will try putting whole thing in microwave first for about 5 min to set eggs, then bake & broil.

Excellent. I substituted 1/2 lb. of bacon for the ham. I've made quiche in the past using frozen pie shells but enjoyed the crescent rolls better.

Very tasty, but takes much longer than 15 minutes to cook.  Be sure spinach & roasted red peppers are thoroughly drained or results are watery.

First, I would like to say that the quiche came out very tasty! The use of the crescent roll dough saves time. That was the only thing that was 'quick' about the recipe. Although I added a few extras (broccoli, sausage, green chiles), and omitted the spinach and red peppers (didn't have any), the total cooking time came close to an hour! I had hungry vultures circling around the kitchen and I kept pushing the serve time back because the egg wasn't cooked at all after the first 15 minutes.  My suggestion is to plan ahead and allow an additional 30 min or more over the suggested cooking time.  No need to broil.

It was a really yummy guiche and I chose to put a layer of spinach and cheese, then the ham, and then mix more spinach, cheese, and the red peppers in with the egg mixture. I think next time I'll also put the ham in the egg mixture OR substitute the ham with sausage and mushrooms. 

I also had an issue with baking. It took WAY longer than 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, it was still raw in the middle.
