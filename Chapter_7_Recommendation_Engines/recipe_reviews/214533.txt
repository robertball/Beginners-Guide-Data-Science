This recipe came out great!  I followed the directions for the seasonings exactly but cooked it in an oven bag and it was very tasty and juicy!  Very easy to make.

Excellent seasoning and perfect cook time! I made this with a simple tri-tip roast and it was absolutely delicious. My family devoured it in minutes! The spices really complemented the meat and it's easy to adjust to taste. The spices also create a very flavorful crust. Love it!  My only regret is that the center of the roast didn't have as much flavor. Next time, I might cut some slits in the meat and stuff a few garlic cloves in the middle of the meat.

This was nice. The trip tip turned out great. I doubled the seasoning because my roast was three pounds and the recipe calls for 1 to 1 and a half pounds. All in all a good dinner.

This was just ok.  The meat was very moist and tender but there was just not much flavor at all.  I will definitely roast a tri-tip this way again, but will use a different rub or marinade.

The flavor for this recipe is good however, cooking the meat for the length of time at such a temperature made mine very well done. Also, there wasn't much of a 'crust' on my meat. I don't know that I would make this again...

This dish came out great. I was making it for my husband and our small boy so instead of chili powder I used paprika and it came out super yummy. My 4year old loved it. My hubby is a big eater and 1.2 pounds fed all 3 of us with rice on the side. I am definately going to make this again.

Had a good flavor but next time I think I'll use blackened seasoning instead of chili power....but I will make it again. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Very good!!  Made as directed, except my roast was bigger so I increased ingredients by half.  Put all the ingredients in a bag, added roast, and shaked.  Very easy.

Amazing, better than expected, nice happy bite, not flaming hot. Nothing to improve. This was my second oven masterpiece on grandma's old Wedgewood 1959 stove. I took Choice as quality. So easy to make, indeed 5 minutes prep time. Cook time was right on.  Very impressed with the wrap of aluminium foil, it saved all the juices, so I could serve those as well.

I thought this was very good.  The only thing I did differently was to add salt to the rub.  I also let the tri tip sit for about 30 minutes after the rub before putting in into the oven.  I will make again.

I read the other reviews and 1) doubled the rub recipe 2) added 1 TB seasoned salt and 3) doubled the garlic and we LOVED it.  Nice variation from a traditional bbq rub, from BBQ lovin' family!
