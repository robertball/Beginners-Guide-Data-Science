I have served these at two parties now to rave reviews.  So refreshing! The only danger is it is easy to have too many!  I would suggest playing with the amounts a few times before serving to guests.  My first few were way to strong and the flavor was bitter, we ended up cutting the liquor almost in half and it was much better.  We also made these in small pitchers so everyone could self-serve and it worked well.

I am a diehard cosmopolitan drinker, and thought this one sounded good so I gave it a try. I used cran/raspberry juice and added a bit more juice than called for (2.5oz) and loved it! Cheers and thanks for the recipe.

Beware! This cocktail is smooth and potent. I think this drink maybe better than a Cosmo. I decreased the vodka and increased the cranberry juice. It was DIVINE!

Very similar to a Cosmo.  We enjoyed it.  I added 3 ounces of juice and added a bit more alcohol than stated just to make up for the extra juice.  It was tasty, refreshing, but potent.

Great! I used cranberry vodka and cranberry/pomegranate juice for even better results. Garnished with cranberries and a twist of lime for a red and green holiday look. Very nice-thanks!

So yummy - I doubled the amount of cranberry juice so they wouldn't be too strong and got rave reviews from my guests. This will certainly be added to my drink catalog!

I made this in a large pitcher for a party and it was delicious- I added more cranberries juice, but it was still potent! Everyone loved it (including the guys) and wanted more but I ran out of cranberry juice.

We have just recently started to play around with martini's but I must say this is an excelent drink.  I always like to start with the exact recipe and wait until after I have tasted it to make changes.  This recipe doesn't need a thing!  The quantity of ingredients listed does make for a small drink each for 2 servings but it fit great in my glass as 1 serving!  The only change I would consider is to add a little more juice to weaken this drink for the less experienced drinker since this one dooesn't taste like it is very strong.

Awesome recipe - everyone always loves it.  A word of warning - it's easy to become overserved!  I cut down the vodka by about 25% to help with that a bit.  I also use light or diet cranberry juice (or my favorite - light cran-pomegranate).  For parties, I divide a bottle of juice in half, scale the recipe for 32 ounces of juice (21 servings) and make it right in the cranberry juice bottle.

I tried this thinking it would be another "cosmo" recipe.  It's definitely not a cosmo.  It is delicious and a keeper drink recipe.  Try it!

I will not make this again following this recipe. It tasted watered down and barely like cranberry. To make this drinkable, I had to add undiluted frozen cranberry juice, fresh lemon juice, and a bit of simple syrup.

Made this martini for a New Year's Eve party and it was a huge hit. It is wonderful!!! Only adjustment we made was to add an extra jigger of cranberry juice. Also tried the recipe using Cranberry-Pomagranat juice. Even better! Great recipe you just have to try!

Wonderul, festive drink for a Christmas party.  I had my girlfriends over last night for our annual ladies' night out gift exchange and everyone loved this drink.  It's light and refreshing.  Some of us added more juice and some a little more vodka!  So everyone was happy with their own version.

This was a big hit for Thanksgiving cocktail.  I rimmed the glass with the juice of a slice of lemon and left on the rim for garnish.  The lemon added another layer of flavor that complimented the drink very well.  I will use recipe often!

I made this drink for a girls' night and it was less than impressive. I followed other suggestions and added a little more juice but the drinks ended up being way too sweet. I had half a glass before I had to dump it out. Far too sweet of a drink for my liking - I will not make this again.

Great holiday cocktail!  I am hosting the appetizer portion of a progressive dinner and plan to pre-mix the ingredients in multiple amounts. Then, when time to serve, just need to shake and serve!

To my personal taste, this was more like a 2.5 as written, but I realize a lot of people probably like stronger drinks than I do.  After following the recipe the 1st go-round, I modified using cran-apple juice instead of cranberry & sweet vermouth  instead of dry in the proportions and only about half the vodka called for.  Stayed with the called-for amount of triple sec . If you like a sweeter drink, you may enjoy this version.

I am not a big fan of cranberry juice but I really enjoyed this drink.  It is as little strong when mixed exactly as the recipe states.  I added a little more cranberry juice and a little less alcohol and it was perfect!

This is a decent base recipe but needs some tweaks depending on what you're looking for. It is very strong and the cranberry juice doesn't do much to offset the strength. I was hoping for more of a fruity but not sweet drink and this was not it. With some experimenting and perhaps a splash of cranberry Monin syrup, this would be what I was hoping for.

This is an excellent drink.  The only change I made was the serving size.  :)  The recipe filled 1 of my large martini glasses.   Oh so good.

This is the best!  I used half the alcohol after reading other reviews.  Didn't want to let it "sneak up on me".

Thiis martini is very potent and will sneak up on you if you're not careful. I added 1/2 oz more cranberry juice to lessen the potency, and I garnished with a curl of fresh orange peel.

This tastes like cherry cough syrup. I kept adding cranberry juice, but it just didn't help.  I used triple sec for the orange liqueur.  Maybe that was the problem??

Smooth and delicious, served at a cocktail party I had.  Instead of plain Vodka, I used Smirnoff cranberry Vodka.

This is excellent!  I'm not a fancy cocktail person, I pretty much stick to my extra dry vodka martini, but it looked interesting.  Just the right amount of everything and a gentle sweetness. My Christmas guests are getting this.

Oh, boy is this good but could be dangerous, as it goes down so smoothly.  I made two versions, one as written and again with gin.  We preferred the gin version, as that is what we make our martinis with.  That said, for those of you who don't usually drink martinis, te vodka version was "smoother".

I am a non drinker- so I took a chance & served this at my Thanksgiving dinner & based on results the crew loved them! Many of them asked for the recipe & shared what a nice smooth drink it was!  Served in crystal martini glasses with cranberries made a nice touch! As mentioned in previous comments I was told it’d be too easy to have too many of these Cranberry Martini  delights!

So delicious and easy! Made a big pitcher, chilled it and added ice just when everyone  arrived.  Put out a plate of lime juice and a plate of sugar for rimming the glasses, and everyone helped themselves.

The dry vermouth overpowered the other flavors.  I added a splash more orange liqueur and about an ounce more cranberry juice to make it drinkable.  We won't be making these again.  Thanks for the recipe though.  It's always fun to try new recipes, and everyone has their own tastes.

Delicious and refreshing.  I always make on Valentine's Day, patriotic holidays and of course, all of the end of year holidays.  Very festive!  Secret is to shake well and if possible chill your glasses before hand.  Enjoy responsibly!

The big question is whether it was real straight cranberry juice in the recipe or cranberry/other juice cocktail.  Big difference.

I made this for a party and it was a great hit. Everyone loved them. I bought extra dry vermouth (that's all they had) so I went a little lighter on it so the drink wouldn't be so tart.

This is dangerously good! I did add a little more cranberry juice, because it was a bit too strong for my taste as written. After that addition, though, it was awesome. Even my husband, who hates things like this, tried it and loved it.

Great recipe! Only change I made is to use 1 jigger of cranberry juice and 1 jigger of homemade cranberry liquor (our friend makes for us each Christmas). So the only difference is my version packs a little more punch, but what a great tasting recipe either way! Thanks!
