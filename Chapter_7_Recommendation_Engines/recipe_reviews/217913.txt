I have been dealing with gallbladder issues and there are very few foods I can eat.  After having many bland meals, this was a great flavorful change.  I just made it for a second time.  It took me much longer than 20 minutes to cook the carrots.  The second time around I boiled the carrots and then added them to the broth.  I also used light coconut milk both times.

This worked wonderfully in my slow cooker also. I added a little fresh minced ginger.

I replaced half the broth with water because I need to watch out for sodium. I ran the carrots through the food processor before putting them in the broth at the beginning. Then when it was time to puree, the stick blender handled it very easily. Turned out delicious! This will be my standard carrot soup recipe from now on.

Fantastic. Warming and addictive and much better than expected. I used veg "Better than bouillon" for stock and added half teaspoon ground fenugreek. Perfect winter meal, garnished with a dollop of yogurt and served with toasted naan. Going into my regular rotation.

I was hesitant to make carrot soup for my first time but was pleasantly surprised with this vegan recipe!  It is quick and easy to make.  It is also delicious and a great alternative for those with lactose intolerance.  I will definitely make this soup again!  Yum!

I love this soup!  I caramelized an onion and added, saving some for garnish with homemade croutons.  I used my immersion blender which makes life so much easier.  I was very wary of the coconut milk and was pleasantly surprised.  It added to the overall flavor of the soup but did not taste like coconut.  I am making a double batch today, half for me and half for a neighbor that just had a baby.  Can't wait for dinner!  Thanks monsterclowngirl!

This was excellent!  I made it as directed except substituting chicken broth for vegetable broth, which I did not have.  (At that point of course it is no longer vegan, but that isn't a concern for my family.)  The soup was the perfect consistency and the coconut milk gave it a delectable creaminess.  It tasted reminiscent of pumpkin pie- probably because of the ginger and cinnamon- and the curry was not overpowering.  I suppose that could be different depending on the potency of the curry powder and the soup taster's pallet sensitivity, but it was fine for us. The recipe calls for about 7 cups of liquids plus the pureed carrots.  I think I wound up using more than two pounds, maybe closer to four pounds, since I just used about 10 medium to longish carrots and didn't weigh them first, but I had about 12 or so cups of soup when all was said and done.  Not that I mind though because the soup is delicious!

This recipe was one of the biggest surprises I've had in awhile.  It was SO easy to put together, came together quickly and had an amazing depth of flavor.  I love how smooth the coconut milk made it without having to use heavy cream.  The coconut milk also added a little sweetness which helped balance the spices.  I will absolutely make this again.

I utterly loved this, though I used a quick garam masala mix (from this site).  However, my husband didn't care for the sweet spices in the garam masala.  THE SECOND DAY, THEY WERE MORE SUBTLE.  He wanted to see if he liked it on the third day, but I'd polished it off by then.  WILL TRY NEXT TIME:  half red curry powder, half garam masala........  AMAZING SOUP - I gotta find a way to make this work for both hubs and me!!!

This soup is good! I made this recipe exactly as written using Pacific brand low sodium veg broth. I think variances in taste can depend on the kind of broth and curry powder you use.  I found I had to add some salt at the end.  I chopped my carrots on the chunky side--rookie mistake--so next time I'll chop them smaller to reduce the cook time.

I left out 1 tsp of the curry because I only had hot madras type on hand, otherwise followed exactly. This soup is wonderful! Used a stick blender, which I highly recommend.

I'm not so into coconut but this soup does have a very nice flavour. I agree with another reviewer in adding a little onion.

This soup is fantastic!!  It definitely took me much longer then 20 minutes to cook the carrots and I added an extra can of coconut milk to make it extra 'creamy'. I also added extra of all of the spices to offset the extra coconut milk.  Turned out AMAZING!!! My anti-vegetable, carnivore boyfriend went for thirds and asked me when I'd be making it again! :) Definitely in the recipe box permanently!

I love curry and so does my family, but this recipe did not work for me. I made it per recipe. I ended up with a somewhat bitter over curry tasting soup. I was expecting something a bit sweeter with a mild coconut flavor. My family could not eat it.

I accidentally used chicken broth, we also aren't cilantro fans so we didn't use that.  I thought the recipe looked yummy and easy and since carrots are cheap, it was relatively inexpensive to try.  Fully expecting that my family would choke it down and complain, I made it and walked away.  I was wrong - it was a HUGE hit - will absolutely make it again!!!!

This was a great recipe and easy to make even for someone with very little time to cook.  The most time consuming part was peeling the carrots.  I did that the night before I actually cooked the soup.  I did not add the extra water so it was thicker and creamier than probably would have been with water.  I also added extra curry because my first taste of it seemed rather bland and I love a stronger curry flavor.   My husband added sauteed sweet onion and spicy pan-fried tofu, but I had added a couple cups of diced chicken breast too.  This didn't last too long in our household.  My husband is begging me to make it again.  I love the cinnamon in it!

I follow ingredients and directions exactly before  I review a recipe, but I found I was out of both curry and cumin so had to substitute turmeric, coriander, and a pinch of red pepper. However, even with subbing the flavors, the basic technique and ingredients make a delicious creamy vegan  soup.

I'm sorry maybe it's because we are from Oklahoma and are not vegan but I couldn't eat it and neither could my husband. I am sure our taste buds are a little off but the texture and the taste just didn't work for us. I tried to be healthy.....won't do that again lol! Hope everyone tries it I'm sure it is just us :)

Could use a bit more spice, but I will make again. May try adding a sautéed onion as others have. An immersion blender would save a lot of time. Thanks for the help in cooking more vegan!

This is a great base recipe. Saute onion and garlic in the beginning with vegan butter, do not add the extra water unless you like very thin soup. Great for the lactose intolerant. Thanks!

I love this soup! I had it at a deli and tried to recreate it using this recipe and it came out wonderfully. The only thing I did was add a little salt, but that's just my preference. Everyone in my family loved it.

This is a great soup.  My husband and I enjoyed it, and i think it would be an elegant appetizer course for a nice dinner meal with friends.  Per another reviewer, I garnished with chopped pistachios and the green of the nuts really popped against  the orange coloring of the soup.   We had plenty for leftovers and then added  leftover chicken (of course making it non-vegan) and chunks of vegetables - a whole Idaho potato cut in 1" cubes, another 4-5 carrots in thick slices, and 3/4 of a yellow pepper in thin strips.   We actually liked it even better  with the added chunks of veges and will have it again!  Thank you for posting the recipe.

I made this. I had some leftover grated carrots from a carrot cake I was making. so I only had a couple cups of grated carrots and just reduced all the other ingredients. I also, I omitted the ginger, and it was amazing. I'll be sprinkling cinnamon on it. Also I think this would go over really well with butter nut or acorn squash. I also started it by suteeing 4 cloves of garlic and some diced onion in oil. I then I added the carrot and sautéed that a bit and sprinkled the curry and cumin on top while it cooked. Then I added the broth. cooked it down a bit and pureed. So go.

Excellent!  I served to one vegan and five non-vegans and everyone raved about it.  I did skip the cilantro as I don't like it and served each bowl with a dollop of plain yogurt on top.  Really good!

This soup had the right amount of spice because my garden carrots were quite sweet  - After I tasted it, I found that the flavor was too subtle so I added a small garden onion and around four cloves of garlic (sweated on the stovetop, pureed and then added to the soup) - Made a world of difference, that's what was missing - I also ended up using low-sodium vegetable broth so I had to add some salt as well (to my own tastes anyway) - I assume that the curry flavor will develop more the longer it sits so it may be worth making it the day before you intend to serve it :) Good recipe, will make again with the additions

I would make this again, that being said, I didn't want the calories from the coconut milk so I used the cauliflower instead, it didn't have much taste without the coconut milk , so I put golden raisins in and a tad of salt, the salt was not the answer alone but the raisins added a sweetness that was wonderful.  I blended everything up in the pot with my hand held blender and it was wonderful, oh yeah I did add a tad more cinnamon

The soup tasted a bit flat without salt and pepper, and I threw in a little garlic just cause. We didn't eat it right away and the flavor improved quite a bit within the hour or two between the cooking and the eating.

I decided to make this recipe at the last minute because I had some packaged sweet baby carrots and really don't care for cooked carrots. But, I did want some extra veggies for our dinner, so I opted for soup. This is definitely a keeper for us!!  The only change I made was subbing minced ginger for the ground ginger because that's what I had handy. The coconut milk (I used canned because it's thicker and richer) was perfect in this recipe.  Yummy and easy!!

This recipe was good. I read that some people ended up with a bitter-tasting soup. My guess is that the carrots they bought from the store were old. I've noticed that happens when I've had carrots for too long. Just a friendly tip. I made the recipe as is except I didn't have any vegetable stock on hand, so I used low sodium chicken broth. In the end the soup was missing salt, but it might have been due to the broth I used. I just added about half a teaspoon and it was perfect. I like how the curry taste was subtle.

Yum! This soup was delicious but on the rich side for me. Next time I think I’ll try using half the coconut milk and half the pureed cauliflower substitution.

Also I used fresh ginger so mine was probably extra gingery, but my group enjoyed it. I thought the cilantro added great flavor and texture too. next time will add more.

I've made this twice, exactly as the recipe is, and my mom and I loved it.  I think the balance of flavors is just right: very subtle and autumnal! It's not a spicy curry soup; I do like spicy curry, and I'm sure you could modify this if you wanted, but this recipe is perfect for a comforting, warm, sweet, savory treat.  We topped with cilantro and plain Greek yogurt.

I am totally stumped as to how this is supposed to work with 4 cups of broth and 2 lbs of carrots. I cut up my 2 lbs of carrots, but then realized if I actually put all of them in the broth a good third of them would be completely out of the water. So I only used 2/3 of them. The end result was pretty good, but it smelled better than it tasted. Overall I didn't think it was really worth all that straining and pureeing. Probably won't make again.

Love this soup! I've made it several times, served with homemade buttermilk biscuits fresh out of the oven...mmm.  It is so quick and easy to make, and the flavor is divine!

We loved this creamy carrot soup.  The only thing I changed was I used chicken broth rather than vegetable broth.  We think the coconut milk was the perfect touch.  Next time I will double the recipe and serve it to guests.  Thanks Monsterclowngirl...great job!

the soup needed additional flavor. I added sauted onions and red pepper powder. This might have been a result of my need to make my own curry powder and not having the exact thing. The recipe might turn out better for those who have the right type of curry powder.

Fantastic. My wife and I love this recipe. It's easy to add to and still tastes wonderful. We will fry some chicken with it and add bamboo chutes.

For those of you who think it's a bit bitter due to the curry, add some sugar (palm sugar is my favorite, but regular works well too). I add about 1/4 cup, which eliminates the bitter and enhances the flavor of the curry.

Made this following the recipe almost exactly, didn't quite have enough carrots and I used lite coconut milk but it ended up tasting delicious!  The bf wouldn't eat it (he's picky), so I was able to to freeze some for lunches later :)

I made this to get rid of some leftovers, so it wasn't completely like the recipe. I added some green onions and half of a yellow onion, and used 2 tsp of fresh finely chopped ginger instead of ground. I also had some cubed cooked chicken breast that I added at the end after it had all been pureed, but I think I would leave that out next time.  Overall it's a good, versitile recipe for using up carrots.
