I really didn't know what to expect with this recipe, but it was good! The only thing I did different was add a little cream cheese to the filling for the kiddo. We tasted it before that and it is great as-is. My three-year-old ate an entire serving which makes this 5 stars based on that alone. May not be a favorite for those who aren't fans of sour cream, but we really enjoyed it!! I will experiment with it a little going forward. We suspect chicken would be great in place of the ground beef, and we will top with chopped veggies next time. 
----> Edit to add: This recipe does make enough filling to create another pan for the freezer. I didn't assemble the second pan the first night. Instead, I froze the filling alone. My family requested these enchiladas again, the very next night. I defrosted the filling partially in the microwave, then put it in a large pot and heated on low until it was totally thawed. I added whole kernal corn to really bulk it up and about half cup additional cheese. I filled each tortilla with a generous half-cup of filling each and was able to get 6 enchiladas in a pan both nights I made this. I swapped out the cheddar for a blend: Monterey Jack, Cheddar, Queso Quesadilla & Asadero cheeses. The last five minutes of cook time, I topped with fresh onion, olives, and tomato. Yummy! This was great!! It really is VERY versatile, and I maintain that chicken would be a fantastic alternative to beef. I would consider fajita beans in place of refries also!

(This is my first time reviewing/commenting!) We LOVE this recipe and I love Allrecipes because I can read peoples feedback and suggestions/changes that they like to do. That being the case, I wanted to share what I like to do with this recipe! I make it slightly different each time with one or all of these changes. First, I always do this recipe casserole style because I can't stand rolling enchiladas(personal problem!), and always I use corn tortillas. I find flour gets a little soggy and if you are trying to go gluten-free, this will solve the tortilla problem. Here are the other things I do: I usually use ground turkey instead of beef. Only because I have it on hand more than beef. Sometimes I use quinoa instead of rice. I double the beans and use whole beans, using either pinto, black, or a mix. Sometimes I add a can of chilies and sometimes I use "hot" taco seasoning. After my first time making it I found the onions to be a bit crunchy so I either cook them with the meat or pre-cook them on the side in the microwave or in a pan. To bake, I spray the bottom of a 9x11 pan then put a layer of corn tortillas (takes 5, 3 of which I cut in half to put the straight side on the edges), 1/2 the meat mix, 2/3 of the sauce/sour cream mix, another layer of tortillas, remaining meat mix, remaining sauce mix, all shredded cheese. Baking time is just a little longer. Then top how you like (olives, green onions, tomatoes, cilantro, etc.). Enjoy!!

Made this for dinner when we had company the other night.  The feedback was "this is better than any enchiladas I've had at the top Mexican restaurants."  I think that says it all.  Yum!!!

I made these tonight because I happened to have all the ingredients in my refrigerator and since we are leaving soon to go on a vacation, I wanted to try and "clean out" the fridge.  I had a small container of left-over flavored rice so I used it instead of white rice.  When I read the other review, I saw that she mentioned corn and I had a small container of left-over corn, so in it went with the rice and meat.  Instead of the sour cream, I had a container of Ranch sour cream dip which I substituted.  Don't be afraid of the cottage cheese--no one in my family tasted it and I couldn't tell it was there, either.  Everything else I followed by the recipe.  It did make a lot of enchiladas--I think I actually used 15 tortillas.  Mine were more like burritos with the rice, corn, beans, meat and cheese.  Next time, I will not put in the refried beans but serve them as a side dish.  I will make these again.  Yummy!

My husband loved them! It definitely needs fresh toppings before serving though such as diced tomato, some black olives, lettuce, and/or fresh diced onion

Thank you for sharing your recipe.  I'm rating this a 4 because my daughter thought it was absolutely delicious, and I thought it was okay.  In fact, my daughter said she'd rate it a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10. I made it almost exactly as specified, except I made my own enchilada sauce.

I think that, for my taste, the filling was too busy (too much going on between the tastes of the rice, beans, meat and cottage cheese). 

Next time I make enchiladas, I will focus on the taste of the sauce and make simple bean and cheese or cheese enchiladas.   That said, I can see why many people enjoy this--it's a hearty meal!

Absolutely delicious! Followed the recipe exactly...except for the refried beans because I forgot to buy some. I'm usually one to make changes to a recipe as I cook because I feel that it is lacking something but this wasn't. It was so easy I will DEFINITELY be making it again. It is a nice, tasty change to the typical taco night.

I made this except I used cream cheese rather than cottage cheese. I found the end result to be quit bland and the filling resembled vomit.  Good thing its wrapped in tortillas. The canned beans overwhelmed the flavor of the meat. Luckily I had green chili on hand to spice it up. Wont make this again.

Oh wow. Fantastic recipe, but OHHHHH so filling. I was stuffed after eating HALF of one of these! I was skeptical about using cottage cheese in a Mexican dish, but it definitely added and we all loved it. My teenage son DEVOURED it. One little note of confusion - I am not sure how you would expect 10 enchiladas to fill up two 9x13 pans? I used 8 tortillas (because that's what was in the pack I bought) and it was just right for one pan. Yes, I had filling leftover, but it will make a heavenly taco salad tomorrow. If I had 10 tortillas, I think it would have made and odd mess in an extra pan. Loved the recipe though!

One pan fed three adults and three children.  It makes so much more than I expected.  I guess I didn't see two pans in the recipe until I was halfway into it.  But it was well received by everyone but one very picky eater.  I think next time I'll add a little salsa or maybe just chopped tomatoes as a garnish.

Quick and tasty! The filling is awesome. We had a bit extra and used it for burritos the next day.

I made this according to the recipe, only thing I added was 2 red chile peppers with the onion and garlic.  It takes some time to prep, but once it's in the oven, you have time to clean up the kitchen!  It was delish!  Hubby really liked it too, so will be making this again!

Really amazed how good these came out with so many ingredients, and just 1 lb. of ground beef.  I scanned the comments and no one said it needed more meat.  A great way to stretch the beef!  Taste and texture were great.  The only problem was that I brought this to church and the color of the sauce was pink, which was either off-putting or confusing to people; they didn't know that it was enchiladas.  So I'll just use enchilada sauce when bringing it somewhere.

I will make it again but probably spice it up a bit.  It's a little bland, that being said - very kid friendly.

Bland as is. Most reviewers added something to perk up the recipe. That should tell you something. Cottage cheese? Please. At dinner both of us sighed dejectedly at how much work these enchiladas were to produce such a mediocre dish.

My whole family enjoyed these. I followed the recipe except I did not use the sour cream. Since I didn’t have any. But they were still delicious. My son cleaned his plate and asked for it again the next night. Plenty of leftovers.

Made a couple of changes because I have some picky eaters.  The only big change was black beans instead of refried beans.  I am not a cook nor do I normally do the cooking but with the wife out of town for a week I am feeding the small army.  It was said my enchiladas are better then mom's though.??

Used Spicy Beef recipe to cook beef, 4lbs, in my slow cooker earlier. Did the beans in a slow cooker over night. Put rice, meat, seasonings, and smashed home cooked beans and other ingredients together in the morning. Made up totillas. Put in fridge. Came home from church, spread sauce on top and baked. Was excellent!

I love this recipe - especially beacuse it uses both beef and refried beans.  I always substitute sweet corn for half the rice and it adds more flavor. I also add pinch of red pepper flakes to the filling. I mak e my own enchilada sauce and about a third of it in the bottom of the pan and use the rest to pour over the enchiladas. Yum!

This is very good! I made it as written except I accidentally grabbed green enchilada sauce at the grocery store, and I used instant brown rice because that's what I had on hand. Very easy to put together.  I will be making this again and again!

It was good, not great though. I usually make a more authentic enchilada, but I was looking for something quick.

This is one of my favorite recipes my kids love it and always request this meal. I love it as is. But I have mixed it up a little I use cheesy taco seasoning instant of the traditional one and jasmine rice I also didn't mix the sour cream and enchilada sauce together. I triple the recipe because everyone wanted seconds. I am making it again today but I will add cream cheese instant of cottage cheese.  I will let you guys know how it turned out. And I will be sure to take pictures. This meal is very kid friendly!!! P.s I did not put the beans in it. I served them on the side because I do not like bean that much!

I really like this recipe, it has so much in it, plenty to choose from I made it with out the cottage cheese but I did try it with rice and I liked it.  I also put in the garlic ..something I rarely use in Mexican food but again I liked it.  Sometimes I find that a whole package of Taco seasoning it too much when fixing enchiladas, it's ok for tacos when you're putting in a smaller amour of meat, so I just added 1 TBS then followed the recipe as written.  I served this with a fruit salad and everyone liked it, so easy too.

We loved this.  We love mexican food and we try a lot of different recipes.  I added a cup of sour cream to the enchilada sauce prior to pouring on top to make it creamy.  I also used black beans instead of refried beans just because that is what I had.  We topped with fresh cut tomatos, and some shredded lettuce at the table.   So, so good.  Thanks for sharing!!

Amazing! I made this as is using hot red enchilada sauce.  I also made the rice per package directions by mistake and it still turned out great.  I cooked 5 and froze 5 for later.  Cooked both batches in disposable aluminum pans for super easy clean up.  Fat Free Refried beans and reduced fat cheese and sour cream were easy subs.
