Awesome! I halved the recipe and made a couple substitutions (peanut butter, for example) and it came out just great. I garnished the dish with some chopped cashews, cilantro leaves and a lime wedge. We  will be making this often!

Love this dish!  It doesn't make a mess of the kitchen and it gave me a chance to try out my new Spiralizer. I made a few additions to give the sauce a little more authentic pad thai flavor: juice of 1 lime, 1 tbsp fish sauce and 1 tbsp siracha.  This one is a keeper.

This is an excellent raw dish, and so easy! I'd never sliced veggies with the peeler before, and it works wonderfully (and it's fast--bonus!). Great flavor and texture. I made the mistake of adding the dressing to the whole salad rather than individual servings, which made the leftovers extremely soggy, so it's definitely best to follow the recipe suggestion on this one. An absolute keeper!

My husband and I loved this!  I also substituted peanut butter and used regular soy sauce, and I was so delicious.  I didn't mind at all that the dish was not cooked... we cleaned our plates!  Will make over and over :)  Love the healthy aspect of it!

Super easy to make, great if you don't want to cook, and beautiful color!
I made adjustments, as did others, and replaced the 3/4 cup almond butter with 1/3 peanut butter to save on $ and on fat calories. I also reduced the amount of honey to make it "better" for sugar content. Additionally, I only added about 3/4 of the head of cabbage and added in some jicama in replacement for the crunch of the bean spouts since my local grocery store decided to stop carrying them due to problems they were having. I've made this for my family and for a nutrition group, many without kitchen access, great recipe, thanks for posting!

Is there a 6th star I can add? The sauce is amazing. Make extra. I had no idea that raw zucchini had such a great texture like al dante noodles. Much better for your body. I omitted the miso and used dried ginger as did not have those items handy. Still excellent flavor. Used fresh ground almond butter.

The flavor in this dish is great! This recipe made a LARGE amount. If I make it again, I'll use it as a salad/side dish instead of an entre. As a side salad, it could easily feed 12 people.

Sooooo delicious! A little sweet, a little spicy, but perfectly balanced. Adding sliced chicken or steak is great, too, for anyone who won't eat their veggies. Also, adding some sliced almonds, cashews or peanuts is what I use as my "croutons".  Definitely making this again!

I made fresh walnut butter instead since I didn't have any almonds on hand. It was delicious. The miso tended to give it a rich full bodied flavor. I will definitely make this often. Thank you for this recipe!

excellent even for those not used to raw food cooking!! my whole family loved it even my 5 yr old son who is a picky eater! so awesome using your summer garden in one recipe, best part is it taste amazing. I did change the recipe slightly using peanut butter instead of almond and I left out the pepper flakes and I didn't have bean sprouts either. Awesome please try it!

I found this to be nothing special.  I find the balance of almond butter too much.  I would use much less next time.  It needs hot peppers too. I wouldn't make it again.

Love the huge portions of this recipe! Bean sprouts were pulled from the shelves due to an illness outbreak so I didn't use them, nor the miso; but I'm happy with the way it turned out!

I made this for a late night dinner and it was absolutely delicious!  I did add some brown rice - quinoa mixture and cashews to give it a little more sustenance!  We really like the sauce also!  We had a little leftover and added greens to it the next day! Thank you, A/R for your great ideas!  Jodi

Really enjoyed this.  Forgot the ginger and added some grated cauliflower tops on tops b/c I had to use them. The sauce is excellent.  I served it w/a side of rice for starch but I could have just as easily filled up on the raw veggies.

Had to use peanut butter, regular soy sauce and regular honey as that is what I had.  I love the salad part of this but the dressing was way to heavy on the miso flavor for me.  Hubs liked it alot though.  I actually made a similar PB dressing from the asian coleslaw recipe on this site to use on the cabbage/zucchini mixture.  We added fresh cilantro too.  Will def make the salad part again but stick to the other dressing.

For me, this is more of a salad rather a Pad Thai. The taste of the zucchini doesn't compare to rice noodles, although I can imagine the sauce, which was very good, being used in traditional Pad Thai.  

I wish I knew all the commenters technique with making this a quick, easy dish. I found it to be very laborious. I'm sure the zucchini would have been easier for me to work with if I had a smaller one (mine was fat and 17" long), and I just have a little hand-held spiraler, but cutting the cabbage into thin strips was painful too.  I'll probably try this recipe one more time someday with a regular sized zucchini, but if I don't save much time, the effort won't be worth it for this to be a keeper. It's good but not great, except in terms of health, which is fantastic.

Rather than raw; I briefly sauteed the vegetables. I used a spiralizer for the zucchini.  For the sauce, since the grocery store did not carry Miso, I  used coconut milk as the base.  I added lemon grass and used peanut butter instead and added it into the sautéed vegetables.  It was a hit with our family.

I made this twice n the first time the sauce's consistency wasn't right, the nut butter (I used peanut) and miso sauce were too thick to make a sauce. The second time I got the sauce ready in a different container and put it in the fridge cuz I didn't have time to eat it. The next day I found the peanut butter and miso paste broke down. I added some sesame oil to it and blended it, poured it over my single serving and it was great! I reduced the nut butter and honey, I also added roasted sesame seeds and some sesame oi

Good. But how is this not  a salad? Is it just that Raw Pad Thai sounds more interesting?

This was very good! I used fresh ground peanut butter I picked up from Fresh Market instead of almond butter. I noticed in the reviews a lot of people are leaving out the miso, don't! The miso is part of what makes the dish. I also used 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger instead of tablespoon of fresh. As you are eating, the bottom of the dish becomes watery and soggy. My husband tolerated it. He is definitely a meat-atarian. I liked it quite a bit. It makes a good side dish.

This is incredibly delicious, possibly the best peanut sauce I can imagine. Definitely recommend making this, even if you don't usually like raw zucchini (I don't, but sliced so thin it was surprisingly good).

I just love this recipe.  It is easy and so tasty!  Everyone raves about it everytime I make it.  I have made it with peanut butter but I most love it with almond butter.  I ran out of the Nama Shoyu and substituted Bragg and it was still delicious.  I don't use the same veggies but love the butter lettece to wrap with. Can't go wrong with this one. Thank you so much for sharing!!!

This was amazing! My boyfriend and I were blown away by how good this was! So simple to make, and once you have the base ingredients, it only costs around $10 to make it again! Definitely recommend this to raw food beginners.

The only think I changed was swapping almond butter for peanut butter.  Wow!  Delicious!  I was afraid it would just taste like a glorified salad with peanut dressing but it really is Pad Thai Noodle-ish!!  Fantastic!

This was just okay.  I had high hopes, but I wouldn't bother making it again.  We never managed to eat the leftovers, which is unusual, so that pretty much says it all.
