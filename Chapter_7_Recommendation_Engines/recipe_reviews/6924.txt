REMEMBER TO TURN THE AN AWAY FROM YOU WHEN FLIPPING THIS ONTO A PLATE!!  I SUFFERED 2nd  degree burns from the hot liquid landing on my shoulder, even after I let this cool some!  This is seriously dangerous.  I have made this recipe at least 100 times and  I laughed at the review I read on here that said another woman got severe burns, thinking she must've been ignorant .  That same night, I was sorry I laughed...just trying to keep this from happening to others.

Very Good and it's so easy.  Next time I'll probably add nuts and make a topping of sorts.  I made it in a bundt pan and cooked it for almost an hour.  30 minutes is what's on the recipe but it was way to gooey at that point.

Great snack.  My husband loved it!  But I think I could've cooked them a little longer for more crispy edges.

Another thing you may want to try---get an 8oz box of cream cheese. Cut into squares and place a square in the center of each biscuit. I have also added a tad bit of Maple Exact to melted brown sugar and butter. YUMMM-OH!!!

made one loaf pan of chocolate chip and one with cream cheese in the middle.  Cream cheese rules.  I only put cream cheese in half of the tiny pieces.  I also made Creamy Cream cheese frosting to dip it in.  Wonderful way to end the sleepover party!

Ate some this morning. Amazing! Last night, I put the sugar and spice mix in a big ziploc and shook the biscuit pieces around. Then loaded up the pan and refrigerated overnight. This morning, poured the butter spice mix over top and threw it in the oven. Came out wonderful!

I used 1 lg can of biscuit dough, each biscuit cut into 8 pieces, in 6 lg muffin papers.  Opted to dip in butter then spices instead of pouring over since I was making these into muffins. Topped with a cinnamon bun cream cheese icing. I'm going to try this with flaky layer biscuits next, can't wait.  DD suggested using the apple slicer to whiz thru the portioning part, by George I think she's on to something!!!

This is an easy and delicious recipe.  I added raisins and mini chocolate chips and everyone went wild.  I will be making it for the third time tomorrow night for an office breakfast.  Also, an easy recipe for kids to make.

My daughter and i just made this (she's 10). It came out so yummy!  I settled on this recipe because i didn't have any chopped nuts but had all the other ingredients.... i also liked that it called for more than just cinnamon and sugar, the nutmeg made this doughnut-like in just the right way.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This was a huge disappointment.  They were not gooey enough and wayyyy to much nutmeg and cloves.  I think I will find a different monkey bread recipe

My four year old son loved this "cake".  He isn't q real sweet eater at least not yet.  But I let him help make it since it was so easy to make and then we baked it an hour.  Next time I will probably make a little cream cheese frosting to spread over it.  But my son loved at and request it often.

I followed the recipe exactly (except omitting the cloves). It was delicious and I didn't think it needed the frosting at all. Yummy! I posted a pic as well.

A special breakfast treat at our house for years.  The kids loved to help make this when they were small.  I never thought to add the extra spices, but really liked the addition.  This is a keeper to pass down to the grandkids.

I made this exactly as written and my family loved it!  The next time I made it I left out the cove and nutmeg and added canned apple pie filling between the layers of biscuit dough and it was better than an Apple fritter which was what I was shooting for.  Then, the last time I made it, I put the cream cheese icing between the layers instead of on top and loved it too!  I also reduced the total amount of sugar and increased the amount of butter to take away some of the overly sweet taste I felt the original recipe over did.  It's a keeper!

Super big hit everywhere. For a more gooey batch I will drip a bit of caramel topping between layers. Mix and warm left over sugar, cinnamon, some butter and caramel topping when you take bread from oven. Flip it out of the bundt pan and pour the warm mix over the bread. Serve warm! Addicting! Can't each just one piece!

Halved this and omitted the cloves. Not a huge fan of this nutmeg version.
