I made this recipe for the Buzz Recipe Group selection. Made no changes to the recipe. I used Ocean Spray Cranberry Juice and it resulted in a nice burgundy red color. Everyone at our holiday get-together loved it. Even left a steaming cup for Santa :) Thanks for sharing your recipe, JP!

Everyone loved it!  I had a recipe that had been used in my family for 20 years or so; but I was looking for something different.  I liked the allspice berries and the pineapple juice - something my old recipe did not have.

This is a very good recipe.  I thought it had just the right tang.  Very good with Tuaca if you want it spiked for the holiday!

Wassail is a tricky concoction. You want the right balance of sweet and sour, soothing and spicy. In our search for the ideal wassail,  we tried this one tonight. But sadly, it came up short.  The mixture  left a slightly bitter aftertaste.  This wasn’t bad ... but it wasn’t good enough.  Our wassail search continues!

Great recipe! I used ground cloves and allspice instead of the whole spices. Came out beautifully.

My husband loves wassail.  This recipe is very reminiscent of his favorite version but it is a bit tart.  I recommend adding the some sweetener or sugar and a hint of brandy while it's cooking.
