I thought this recipe was great fun.  Because my 14 month old can't eat apple yet I made hers with banana.  She loved it and ate half a english muffin.  This was great for her.  I have a hard time getting her to eat breakfast and most mornings it ends up on the floor.  I will definately have to keep this one in mind and pass it on to her sitter.

THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! Yes-I mean to shout this at the top of my lungs. This is probably the quickest, tastiest breakfast I've ever had. My 3-year-old who prides himself on eating nothing ever, LOVED these. I've tried every breakfast known to man to get him to eat. I was skeptical of this recipe, but out of desperation gave it a try. It just proves the old addage, "don't knock it, til you try it." My son ate 2 1/2 of these. My 6-year-old ate all of hers, and I had one too. We all loved it! My son called his dad at work, and told him he would make him one this weekend. I think this will be a great back-to-school breakfast too! I guess you can tell, our family gives this recipe a 5-star rating! Thanks again for sharing!

YUUUMMMM! This was fast and easy and delicious. I used an apple corer on my apple and then just cut thin "O" shaped slices that fit perfectly on the english muffin. Used transfat free margarine and whole wheat english muffins and it was great!

Perfect for a quick and healthy breakfast! I cut the recipe in half and used a whole grain English muffin that I toasted first.  Red delicious apples are great to begin with but peanut butter AND apples are a great combination!  Of course I'll take peanut butter any way I can get it!

Very yummy Lisa.  I've made this several times using both apples and bananas.  I've tried this on regular bread and ciabatta and it's great on both. We really enjoyed this and will be making it agian. Thanks for sharing.

I made this for my 2 1/2 year old son. While i was making this, all I kept thinking was,  theres no way he is going to eat this.  (he does not like to get his hands messy).  Well, he loved it.  and the glaze was so simple to make.  Thank you for a great simple way to make breakfast more fun.

This recipe deserves an award for taste and ease of preparation.  After I used all of the english muffins (whole wheat) up I turned to toasted bread.  It's that delicious!!!  I tried it with both apples and bananas.  I liked the crunchy peanut butter with the bananas and the creamy peanut butter with the apples.  The only advice I have is make sure your muffins are really toasted.  I think it needs the firmness to hold up the peanut butter and fruit.  This has become a regular breakfast and snack food for my family.

I was surfing this site to find a mid-morning snack for my 3 and 5 year old nieces without doing the donut or cookie thing. They absolutely loved these, and I loved knowing that I had succeeded in getting something a little healthier down their throats. Thanks for sharing, Lisa.

If you saute the cinnamon slices in the butter, sugar and cinnamon before placing on the english muffin, this recipe is a five star winner!

As this a good idea, I don't think its a good idea for breakfast, maybe a sweet snack.  If you don't heat and pour quickly you will have harden caramel also... I won't make them again, but I will stick to my peanut butter with apples.  Its just to sweet for breakfast.  Its like having a carmel apple with peanut butter and a crunch... Thanks!

These are delicious.  My 6 1/2 year old who has sworn off peanut butter actually asked for seconds of this.  My 2 1/2 year old loved it too.  The only downside would be that they are SO good I could eat 4 all by myself.  Great for snack time also.

I'm typing this with one finger because I'm eating a variation of this right now. I just made it for my 2.5 year old and even though he took it apart, he's devouring it. I'm eating an apple with peanut butter and the leftover cinnamon/suger mix. So GOOD!

Wonderful. But, I'm diabetic so needed to make some changes to guard my blood sugar. I toasted the muffins and while still hot spread on the peanut butter.  Then combined cinnamon with my store bought stevia/brown sugar mixture.  Thin sliced the apples, sprayed them with Crisco butter spray and coated them in the cinnamon mixture.  Topped the muffins with the apples. Nuked them 1 minute on high.

EXCELLENT! I knew my daughter would like this but I wasn't sure if I would...but I was wrong! This was a great and easy breakfast! Would make for a great snack as well. I used cinnamon-raisin english muffins, which went great with the cinnamon/brown sugar sauce. Its soo good, I'm making them again for tommorrow's breakfast with my morning smoothie!! Thanks Lisa!

Quite delicious! Very sweet and sugary, the peanut butter is a great contrast, I used extra chunky which added more texture. I think slicing in semi-circles or bite-sized pieces is probably easier than the sliced rounds. My pieces slid off the peanut butter and got a little messy when eating. Make sure to toast the English Muffin, makes it nummy!

We really like this recipe, as written, and all the variations.  The last time, I put a crisp slice of bacon between the peanut butter and the banana, and then topped with sauce. Wow!  What a great taste contrast.

Thank you for this excellent recipe.  I cut the cinnamon mixture in half and another time I substituted the cinnamon mixture with maple syrup.  Very good healthly breakfast.

I made this for my kids today using Granny Smith Apples and Peanut Butter and Co's cinnamon raisin peanut butter. I was a hero. They inhaled them.

These are so good and so easy!  I ate 4 rounds by myself!  I made them with whole wheat English muffins, tasted really good with the peanut butter.

My kids do not especially like peanut butter (nor do I) but this recipe is a big hit.  I found it helps to add a little bit of water to the butter/brown sugar to make it pourable... otherwise I found it kind of clumps.  Maybe margarine (which I don't use) does not need this, I don't know.  Anyway, thanks for a really good recipe.  I will try this with whole wheat english muffins and natural peanut butter.  I think we will like it just as well.  And I'm going to try it with bananas too sometime.  Thanks again for an easy, nutritious breakfast and/or snack!!

I made this for my husband and I while our daughter is in daycare today, we got snacky.  I used dark, dry, acquired-taste Finnish rye flatbread as the bread, and made it otherwise as stated.  I tell you, these are awesome, tasty, and almost decadent.  I cannot even make them justice!  Grats to whoever invented these.

WOW! I couldn't find the brown sugar and wanted to surprise my mom, so I used about a teaspoon of honey and a little sprinkle of cinnamon. Then, I had to replace the apple with banana because of an allergy. I don't know if it still counts as your recipe, but this was delicious and we've already had it twice.

Easy to make, but extremely rich. A little too much butter for starting my day. I would have enjoyed just a little brown sugar and cinnamon sprinkled on top of the apples. Would have tasted just as good, and my arteries wouldn't have felt clogged afterwards. Or maybe I'll just stick with plain peanut butter. Tasty, but too heavy.

I'd give these 4.5 stars if I could. The addition of fruit and "drizzle" really made for a break from routine and was really tasty and easy. We used sliced pear for ours and it was super.

Very good.  The kids liked these.  The brown sugar, butter, cinnamon mixture is a bit too sweet--maybe I put on too much!  A fun and different breakfast or snack option.

My kids and husband love these.  I always use red apples, but think I will try a Granny Smith sometime. You have to make sure to get the English muffins really good and toasted or they'll be kind of flimsy when picking them up.  It's a great recipe!  Thanks for sharing, Lisa.

Hubby turned up his nose at this one but I thought it was a unique addition to the breakfast menu.  My rating is based on the average of his opinion and mine.

Wow! Who ever came up with this recipe is a genius! I made it as a midnight snack. What a treat!  I used an olive oil mister from Amazon which I paid about $10 to first coat my hamburger buns (I didn't have muffins on hand) , then I sprinkled cinnamon on it, and toasted my buns on the stove top. After toasting them, I buttered them.

From there, I thinly sliced the red apples, cored them, spread the peanut butter, more cinnamon, added the brown sugar, and microwaved for about 45 seconds. CAUTION: after 45 seconds of microwaving, it will be really HOT!

I then chased it with a glass of milk.  This is a great change of pace from the usual eggs and bacon or similar breakfasts. It will also serve families well who have kids. I don't. But for those with little ones, perhaps teach them the proper use of microwaving (if they don't already know how) and take care of the slicing of the apples yourself (if they are too young). Great teenager treats, too. Again, I acknowledge that I'm not a parent, but rather just making suggestions. Note: I do think that the recepie will be better served by sticking with the muffins. Enjoy!

Love it, I was out of apples so I decided to use banana instead and it came out perfect. Also try sprinkling a little salt on the top to balance the sweet. (Also I subbed the butter for cream cheese and it worked just fine)

This is so good. Really simple to make. Wouldn't make it on a running out the door kind of morning though, but I am a new cooker so an experienced one would have made it quicker than I did. This breakfast has lots of proteins. I only made two changes. I'm not a fan of English muffins so instead I used an eggo waffle and all turned out well. the other change was I used a green apple, bc that's all I had in the fridge. so if you were wondering the recipe works with all apples.

Super yummy and easy.  We toasted the apples for a few minutes before putting them on top of the English muffin with peanut butter. Now a huge fan of apples but this makes me want to eat my apple a day.

I absolutely loved this recipe! I was looking for a easy breakfast recipe, and this worked great. I used a little less butter for the sauce, but otherwise kept it as written. I had extra apples, so I just mixed the extra sauce and some peanut butter together and ate it like that. Thanks for the recipe!!

Quick, easy, versatile & reasonably healthy...kids ate it, so that is a plus!  Toasted english muffins till firm.  Spread with chunky peanut butter, lightly drizzled some cinnamon sauce on peanut butter, added sliced bananas (my apples were not looking good) and lightly drizzled some more cinnamon sauce over bananas.  Ended up having left over sauce because I didn't want to drown the finished product...could probably have made another.  Nice breakfast before school...thx Rocky99!!!

I made these this morning and my husband and I really liked them. I altered the recipe for the sauce by adding milk to it. If I had had cream on hand I would have used it and made it a real caramel sauce, which I will do next time. Also, I always use butter.  I never even buy margarine. I used bananas instead of apples. It is sort of like Banana's Foster on an English muffin.  I'll try the apples tomorrow. :0)
Addition to above:  I have now made this using cream and it is very much like a real caramel sauce. I also tried this without milk or cream in the sauce, and as another reviewer stated, it gets as hard as a brick after it cools.  Thankfully I used a non-stick skillet and it came off fairly easily. It still tastes good, just more difficult to eat. Lol!  I'll definitely stick to adding milk or cream to the sauce.

Taste was good, but rather messy.  Probably will not make it again, since I can make it only for myself.  And because I could not use the whole apple, although I used what was left for a salad, it's just not cost effective.

Toast the muffin before. If I could give this like 76 stars I would! :D I didn't even have the amount of brown sugar called for...just a tiny bit of brown sugar & it was STILL delicious (& you could totally taste the brown sugar!)! I'm visiting my parents this weekend, I can't wait to introduce this to them...my dad's gonna flip.

I am rating this recipe as written as a 3. Good, but too sweet for us to eat in the morning. I make something very similar but less sweet. As personal preference we use almond instead of peanut butter. I juice one lemon, use about a tablespoon of raw sugar and about 1/2 tsp cinnamon (we love our cinnamon!)Heat just until the sugar dissolves, add the apples and shake or stir, place on the rounds and drizzle with remaining juice.

I came across this recipe while searching for something quick and easy to make for my daughter for breakfast before her early morning softball games. This turned out to be super delicious! I don't regularly buy english muffins, so I used the a whole grain bread with seeds.  It was perfect and tasted like apple pie! My daughter and husband request them just about every weekend, game or not!! Thanks for the recipe!!

This is a great, easy recipe.  It goes great with coffee and is filling too.  I microwaved the apples for 30 seconds to soften them.

I really liked these!  This was a good idea.  I think it would taste better with cooked apples.

Big hit!  My 8 year old son and I loved them!  Make sure you pour the butter mixture on right away as it tends to get clumpy pretty quickly.  Can't wait to try it with bananas.

I have been looking for some new recipes for apples, since we have a few trees out back and you get a little sick of pie and applesauce.  My daughter thought these were awesome.  It doesn't seem like the ingredients go together that well, but they do.  She's been eating them every morning.  They're also a better snack than the chips and cookies she usually has.

I used another reviewer's suggestion and used honey instead and it is excellent.  I like to make this occasionally to mix things up a little at the breakfast table.  Beware, it is unavoidably messy.

Delish. Better pour the cinnamon mixture on while it's still hot, or it'll harden quickly. I did the banana version.

Brought this to an breakfast party at my office and everyone raved.  Made both the apple and bananna variation, the banana ones went quicker. Both were messy but the bananna seemed easier to handle.

This is a great start in the morning.  These were divine!  My husband and I both loved the flavors and combinations.  I made a slight modification and didn't use the margarine/brown sugar combo and just used honey instead.  After putting on the honey, I sprinkled cinnamon on top.  Thank you for a great new way to eat English muffins!

This was SO unbelievably delicious! I'm just thankful that I only had one English muffin to use up, or I could have been in some serious trouble! I didn't - and wouldn't - change a thing. Super quick, super easy, super tasty. Thanks so much, Lisa!

I can't believe I never thought about putting these ingredients together for a delicious breakfast treat!  The only change I made was I just sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on top, rather than mix with butter/margarine.  It still tasted wonderful!

These are good!  And they're incredibly easy, which is always a huge plus, especially with a little one.  I substituted Pumpkin Pie Spice (which contains cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and allspice) for the cinnamon.  I only drizzled a little sauce over the top so it would still be mostly nutritious.  I'm going to make this a regular snack for my toddler.

Breakfast Rounds were surprisingly delicious. We used whole wheat english muffins. It did seem like a little bit of an odd combination, but it worked sooo well. I happened to use crUnchy peanut butter. It was really good..YUMM! I loved them.. definitely a keeper. Thank you Lisa!

These were very good & very different from a usual breakfast around my house!  My son is not a big breakfast eater & he ate the whole thing & asked when I will make it again.  I do think they were a little sweet but my son didn't mind!  These are good for a treat & a change of pace from the usual breakfasts.
