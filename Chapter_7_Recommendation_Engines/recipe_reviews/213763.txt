Hey everybody, I fixed the "sticky" problem! After dicing the potatoes, rinse them under water. Drain well so they don't freeze together in a frozen ball of water, tho. This takes away so much of the starchiness. They fry much better this way and aren't mushy. Yummy recipe, Striker.

This recipe is great!  However, I can't leave well enough alone and I add 2 teaspoons seasoned salt with pepper per bag!

It killed me to have to wait until this morning to eat and rate, but wait I did - and it was well worth it.  6 potatoes, 1 bell pepper and 1 onion gave me a 3# bag of frozen Potatoes O'Brien.  I boiled whole (with skins) for 10", cooled, and then peeled and diced.  They were so sticky I did as someone else suggested and rinced the cubed potatoes off in water, thoroughly dried, and then proceeded to oi, bag and tag.  This morning, heated up a small cast iron skillet with a little olive oil and some butter, reached in the bag, grabbed a handful and TADAH!  Crispy crunchy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside - - - simply wonderful.  Thank you SO much for recipe!  I'll be making this monthly from now on :) UPDATE:  Just an fyi - I've found so many uses for these potatoes!  They're also great for  pot pies; potatoe, clam chowder, and vegetable soups; added to breakfast burritos, etc.  We simply adore them.

Make it easier.....Use bag of frozen stri-fry vegetables.  Season it really good when it's cooking.

Easy & delish! Haven't tried it frozen yet.  I cubed my potatoes, added to boiling water and cooked approximately 5 minutes (still firm). Dipped potatoes in ice water to stop cooking, then proceeded with recipe as written.

I didn't have green bell pepper so I used all red and I think you could use any color you prefer and get the same results. These were super simple and all I added was a sprinkle of season salt as they were cooking. I plan on making a much bigger batch next time and this is something I plan to have on hand at all times for those breakfast for dinner nights.

Delicious!  I need it right away, so I cubed the potatoes and while they fried up, diced up the peppers and onion.  Added the onion when the potatoes were soft, cooked about 8 minutes, then added the peppers and cooked until they were crisp-tender.

Delicious and attractive on the table.  Keeping this on hand in the freezer is just plain brilliant.  This summer, when my garden is in full swing, I'm going to freeze lots of this.  Thanks for submitting!

I actually tried to wing it, then found the recipe afterwards.  (Men and instructions syndrome).  I used small yellow knutsen potatoes, cubed them raw, then blanched for about 3-5 minutes in well salted water.  Pulled them whilst they still had some good firmness, but not raw.  Drained well and cooled, including some time on a paper towel in a single layer to get all moisture out.  I also added one diced serrano pepper (w/out seeds and membrane cuz my wife isn't a pepper-head).  I may add a bit of fresh roasted red pepper at cook time.

The only reason that some of this will make it into the freezer bag is because I made a fairly large batch.  

So easy, inexpensive and healthy compared to store-bought frozen stuff.

Yum! Thanks for the recipe :) I ended up using red, orange, yellow, and green peppers, and sauteeing these in olive oil, separately from the potatoes. I used redskin potatoes (a whole bag of them) and sauteed those in leftover bacon grease. Maybe not the healthiest way to make this, but definitely delicious!

A great way to make ahead "big breakfast" and have it on hand when you need it.  I too added seasonings as it was cooking.

If you are looking for easy freezer foods, this one is sure to please.  However, I recommend that you flash freeze the mixture before bagging.   The first time I made these, I followed the directions exactly and they all froze together in one big clump.  Luckily, I laid the bag flat in the freezer and with a little effort, I was able to break off a chunk.  Not exactly ideal for cooking.   The second time I made them, I decided to flash freeze before bagging.   This yielded a perfect bag of frozen potatoes.  Six weeks later, they still have beautiful color and can easily be poured from the freezer bag into the skillet.

I've made these potatoes for years. The only minor things I do differently is bake them instead of boiling them as I and my family like the flavor better. Add some season salt and pepper as you then fry them in a skillet with your veg and there you have it! I don't measure out the oil, just use a small amount in the bottom of the pan to keep everything from sticking. As was noted above rinsing the potatoes if you boil them will keep the sticky down. Step 2 is perfect for freezing but for cooking that day or the next several days, I just store the potatoes in the fridge, peel and add everything to the skillet with a dab of oil and the spices.

For some extra nutrition and flair, I made this using a combination of potatoes and winter squash, in addition to the peppers and onions. Fried up with a little olive oil, and some garlic and salt. Delish!

Pretty good, and very easy.  I didn't have to fry them as long as it said; maybe it was on higher heat than I thought.  Either way, though, it's easy enough.  I haven't tried the ones I froze; I made a batch without freezing and the rest are in the freezer for when I want them; great idea, thanks!

greta for the freezer- would be better if potatoes were patted dry before freezing- otherwise they stick in as glop. Very good taste though!! Great cooked with scrambled eggs!

I made these for breakfast.  I used new potatoes, a tomato with the juice taken out, rosemary and paprika, and added a single slice of thin bacon.  The recipe above is awesome.  mine came out great, too.  Of all the ones I've seen listed, this one was the only one that didn't use the oven, which made for much more flavorful and crisp potatoes.

I needed potato dish right away, so following another cook's advice, I fried diced potatoes first for about 10 minutes before adding onions and peppers. I seasoned with Lawry's Seasoning Salt and sautéed another 4 minutes before serving. Boiling potatoes removes so many nutrients. Skillet frying rocks!

I was looking for a change from hash browns.  This was perfect.  I did add a bit of seasoned salt and cracked pepper.  Tip for freezing. I spread them out on a cookie sheet and freeze for 20 minutes before putting into a storage bag.  This keeps them from sticking together.

It was okay. I might make this again in the future, but I wasn't exactly impressed. Next time, if there is a next time, I'll add cajun seasoning and crisp the potatoes a bit before adding the onions and peppers.
