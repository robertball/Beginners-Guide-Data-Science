This recipe was too dry.  After more than 30 minutes it did not set.  I had to add more cream to keep it together.  I ended up cooking them in a pie dish to keep from crumbling.  I also had to cook them twice the time called for.  Taste is also bland.  This did not work out!

Had to add an extra bit of moisture to get it to stick together.  Very nice!  Added an extra 1/4 cup of currants to use the box I had.

At first bite, I thought these were good but average.  However the more I ate, the more I appreciated the texture and flavor.  Plan to use more cream than stated in the recipe to combine the ingredients thoroughly. These are excellent scones.
