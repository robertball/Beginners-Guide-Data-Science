All I can say is "Yum!"  I usually make my meatloaf using meatloaf mix (beef, pork, and veal) but it is soooooo greasy and I tend to be very health conscious, so this was a good alternative (the combination of turkey and pork is a good one), and it turned out tasting very much like my usual meatloaf.  I made some changes (I hope you don't mind Kris) -I used a handful of parsley in place of spinach, I used an envelope of onion soup mix, I used just one whole egg and then one egg white to lighten it a bit, and I used oats as my filler rather than bread crumbs, par usual.  I had to leave some things the way I normally do or my kids would not have eaten it!  However many changes I made, the basic recipe is still a winner, and no matter how you dress it up to your own taste, this is one DELISH meatloaf, hubby and kid-approved!
I also used the leftovers (as recommended by Kris) to make spaghetti sauce- I started with my usual homemade sauce, then crumbled the meat into it and let it simmer for an hour.  It was great!

Great tasting and the key is to make sure to cook the onions,peppers, celery & carrots ahead til soft (some recipes have you add it all in ahead uncooked and its not as good)I also ran out of ketchup and glazed the loaf with a steak sauce and brown suger mixture, yummy, I sometimes like to add in several whole mushrooms right down the middle if I'm serving it for company and it looks real cool when you slice it and the there is a perfect mushroom right in the middle of the slice. Try it!

This is sooo good.  I have already made this two times this week.  I used all turkey, ground oats instead of bread crumbs and added mushrooms.  The wheat germ is a really great way to get extra nutrients in without sacrificing taste.  I added some Mexican Seasoning to mine the first time, and Thai Style Green Curry Spice Blend the second time.  Both were phenomenal.
Update - I ran out of ketchup and substituted Sweet Baby Rays Hickory Brown Sugar barbeque sauce.  I also used Montreal Seasoning.  Tasted even better than the ketchup.

While wandering through the 99 cent store the other day, I happened upon a chub of ground turkey and one of pork sausage. How shocked I was to find a recipe that used both. I printed out the recipe and handled it to my DH who prepared it. He used green bell pepper instead of red and wasn't reading well, so we ended up with some honey in the meatloaf, too. Delicious! Using a baking pan instead of a loaf pan make it crispy and yummy. Thanks for a great recipe and something very different from our average meatloaf.  My only change, because it is just the two of us, would have been to make 2 loaves instead of one. I can hardly wait to figure out what I am going to do with the leftovers.

This is an OUTSTANDING meatloaf!  I used all turkey (we don't eat pork).  I used orange and yellow bell peppers (what I had), increased the garlic and pepper a little and omitted the wheat germ.  All three kids asked for seconds and my finicky hubby loved it too.  We are making this a permanent fixture in our house!

Great meatloaf!  I used all turkey and also used zucchini instead of spinach.  It was so moist, I will use this recipe again for sure!

I had ground pork that needed to be used, so I thought I'd try halving this recipe and not using the turkey.  It turned out great and my husband, who is typically the cook in our house and was skeptical of the all pork meatloaf, loved it.  I didn't change much else except I used fresh spinach and put the veggies together in a food processor until they were pretty finely chopped.  I also reduced the baking time to around 30 minutes.

Very good recipe.I was a little skeptical at first glance, but went for it anyway.I am really glad I did.I made it exactly as the recipe is written except for the wheat germ.I didn't have any and didn't feel like going to the store.It was a very tasty and healthier alternative to traditional beef meatloaf.I will make this again only I will use a little more onion and garlic.The honey and ketchup topping is excellent.This meatloaf is a winner!

Pretty good meatloaf.  I like mixing pork with other meats--gives it a nice flavor.  I have to say, though, that I like more tomato flavor in my meatloaf (mine usually has tomato sauce or paste in it and on top), and I'd probably add more veggies if I made this again.  I think I'd also puree the veggies in the food processor instead of dicing and cooking them.  I baked in my meatloaf pan since I hate to pass up a chance to use the thing (I use it so rarely!).  Still, we enjoyed this.  Bf added salt and pepper to his--apparently he thought he needed some more--but I thought it was good on it's own.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!  Huge time saver.... blend all of the veggies together in a food processor! It took like 2 minutes to wash the veggies then chop them up! I added some celery too!

This will be my go-to meatloaf recipe from now on! This was SO delicious! I left out the bell pepper, added some italian seasoning, and just oiled the cookie sheet rather than using the foil. Next time I will double the honey ketchup glaze because it was so nice. My boyfriend made sandwiches the next day with wheat bread, mayo, and sauteed onions. They were amazing! Thank you again!

This is not your traditional meat loaf. Great for a change to the usual beef version. It was actually best the next day on sandwiches. I would make this again and double the topping.

Thank you for a great EASY recipe!
I halved it, since I live alone. I'm on day 3 of it and loving it! I'm a full time student, so I love something that I can make early in the week and then just heat up a bit when I come home tired and hungry.
My variation: I replaced the breadcrumbs and wheat germ with my concoction of RedHill muesili, wheat germ and flax seed and was quite pleased with myself (I don't have the cooking gene, so anytime I actually cook from scratch it is a huge victory). I think I might throw in a few more raisins the next time to add moisture, texture and a blast of sweet. It was really good!

This is a VERY good meatloaf!  As I was mixing this up, I thought there is no way this is going to be good...boy was I wrong!  It really is delicious.  My 5 & 7 year olds loved it.  Also good as a leftover meatloaf sandwich.

fantastic recipe -- like some others, I doubled the honey/ketchup topping, and added just a hint of cayenne pepper to help the anticipated sweet taste. We did this because we werent looking for a candy recipe. This is better than any beef meatloaf I've had.

I liked the fact that this had veggies in it. The topping was really good. I used half of the salt, and I still thought this was still a bit too salty. You can definitely get away with only a fraction of the salt. Used oats in place of the wheat germ, but other than reducing the salt, followed the recipe exactly.

My 1st time making meatloaf so didn't know what to expect. Couldn't find turkey so used lamb instead. I halved everything as there are only 2 of us but used the full portion for the sauce on top as suggested by others. It turned out good but still lacked a kick in it. I think I will add some herb and a bit more seasoning in it next time. Will try it again.

This meatloaf was outstanding!!! My entire family loved it. It is a healthy alternative to beef meatloaf, not to mention all the vegetables that are hidden so even the little ones like it and they are getting lots of healthy vitamins. Iam always looking for healthy recipes and this was PERFECT :)

I use a food processor for the vegetables - the spinach can be thrown in the pan frozen - I usually use packages of pork and turkey that are just over a pound each. Hope you like it!

This meatloaf was amazing!  I made a few changes:  I used all turkey and no pork, cooking spray instead of cooking oil, doubled the veggies and added a few teaspoons of hot taco seasonings (next time I'll use even more!).  It came out of the oven juicy, flavorful, and full of nutrients.  I will make this again and again!

This was as stated a very soft textured meatloaf and it was wonderful! I grated the carrot & onion and used roasted red peppers to cut out the cooking veggie step as well as to disguise the amount of veggies within for some picky eaters I know. And to make it gluten-free for me, I used quick cooking oatmeal instead of bread crumbs and wheat germ. Thank you Kris W. for sharing this recipe! This will definitely go into the rotation.

I tried this recipe tonight and it was a thumbs up by husband who is the pickiest person to please.  He loved it!!!  My son loved it too!  I changed a few things.  I used all pork and used 1 cup of breadcrumbs instead of 1/2 cup and left out the wheat germ.  I didn't have spinach.  So, I subsituted it with zucchini.  It was delicious!!!  It is a must try recipe!

The only thing i liked about this recipe was its use of vegetables.  It was extremely bland and most reviewers say they added something to make it better.  I agree, if you add some more seasoning and perhaps some green peppers or something to zip it up.  It was moist but again i found it sooooo bland. Also, i only used half the salt because i normally dont use that much salt.  My family only ate one serving and that's enough reason for me to not make this again.

Second time making this. This is very good...love the veggies in it. I used oats instead of bread crumbs, didn't have wheat germ and tripled the sauce on top. Oh and added chopped mushrooms that had to be used up.  With mashed taters and pinto beans, and left over cucumber and tomato salad. YUM YUM! Can't wait for a meatloaf sammich tomorrow for lunch.

I absolutely loved this one and I've already started sending it to people.  I made as written (minus the peppers due to a food allergy) and it was delicious.  I can't wait to make this again for company!  It made plenty for just me, so I was able to freeze half and still have dinner and a couple of lunches.

This would have been perfect if it weren't for too much salt. Next time I will only use one teaspoon instead of the two that the recipe calls for. My husband turned down seconds, and I'm chugging water like no one's business.

Wow 10 stars from my family - they loved it. I use recipes like this as an opportunity to clean out the fridge. I had an orange and yellow bell pepper and fresh spinach that had seen better days and needed to be used up. I had no carrots but threw in a shallot. More fresh garlic since we love it. I also had 2 whole wheat hot dog buns that I toasted and crunched up for the bread crumbs. Threw in some wheat bran although a lot less of both crumbs and wheat bran, since I felt like the 1 cup of dry was too much. Used less salt and added some granulated garlic (we are garlic nuts) also a few dashes of Cholula. On the top I just squirted ketchup. Cooked it in my pampered chef mini loaf stone for around 40 minutes. I love that thing for meatloaf! Taking it to my mom -she's going to love having meatloaf in the freezer she can just heat it up. Great recipe to customize to your families preferences/seasonings.

Followed recipe and it turned out moist and flavourful. I used all ground pork because I had no ground turkey and it still tasted yummy. I added flax meal in the breadcrumbs and that worked well too. This is a keeper.

A lot of work but definitely worth it!  Having Celiacs, I adjusted the recipe and used gluten free breadcrumbs.  I omitted the green pepper and added some jalapeños, zucchini and used sweet baby rays for sauce in meatloaf and for the outside glaze, used the honey with organic ketchup. My husband actually liked this!

We loved this   Didn't add spinach because we didn't have any. Will need to make with that but without was delicious!  We doubled the seasonings.  Used 2 lbs ground turkey and one ground pork sausage.  Quantities and pork sausage vs ground pork would make a taste difference but never the less, will make again.

I love this recipe. My kids and husband all asked me to make it again and the leftovers were gone before noon the next day. I didn’t use the spinach because I was sneaking the veggies past the kids and didn’t have ant to give it away with the color. I doubled the sauce on top and accidentally added 1 tablespoon of honey to the mixture for the loaf as well. I thought I had ruined it, but it was actually delicious. It’s a fantastic recipe. The meatloaf is moist and tasty and everyone loved it.

Delicious, moist, and not greasy. No changes made and I paired it with Chef John’s mashed potatoes. I’m glad it was a mix of pork and turkey, since all turkey can be hard on our intestines, and beef can’t be greasy. Using the food processor was a good cal too.

This is a great recipe and will be my go to for meatloaf. I made a couple changes simply because of what I had on hand. I substituted grated zucchini for the spinach, and I substituted a half pound of grass fed hamburger for the turkey. I also used half the salt called for. I baked the loaf on a rack inside a pan so the fat dripped down under it. It was wonderfully moist, and absolutely delicious! Thanks so much for contributing this tasty recipe.

Good! I didn't make the glaze (only because my kids hate ketchup) and made them into smaller mini-loaves. Nice flavor and texture. We'll make this again.

I will make this again.  Great flavor.  Nice and juicy.  Used zucchini instead of spinach.  Ran all the veggies through food processor, as suggested.  Instead of the listed glaze, I brushed on a commercial barbeque sauce, which worked out great.

'Didn't have the spinach & didn't make the topping, but other than that, pretty much followed - except the salt.  Two ts seemed like a lot so I added 1 1/2t & it was still too much.  'Reminded me of a frozen dinner or cafeteria oversalted bland dish.  It will be eaten, but even with a lower salt amount, I don't see this being made again.

Fantastic! Hosted big family gathering and made this as one of the dishes. My aunt - who is an incredible cook - asked for the recipe! When a pro is asking for the recipe, you know it's good. Didn't change a single thing, did not include the wheat germ, and it came out just perfect.

I was looking for an alternative to beef meatloaf and this is it!  I had 1/2 lb. of ground chicken, 1/2 lb. of ground pork, and 1/2 lb. of ground turkey left over from making Dora's Baked Spaghetti.  I doubled the topping sauce as recommended by others.  Used half a bag of fresh spinach had on hand, didn't have any bell peppers.  Put all the vegetables in the food processor and pureed.  Then I sauteed them in pan in oil until tender. Used a breadcrumb topping with bacon and pepitos left from another recipe for the crumbs. Used one tsp. Lawry's hot'n'spicy seasoned salt and 1 tsp. regular salt.  Caution, don't be alarmed, when I mixed the spinach vegetable mix with the meats, it was green!  Looked fine after cooking. Meatloaf was moist without falling apart, flavorful and never missed the beef!

I've never written a review before and have made and eaten many wonderful dishes from allrecipes but this one had to be written! This was amazing! I doubled the ketchup topping as suggested by others and I didn't have bell peppers so I chopped up some celery.  Both my 2 year old and 6 year old asked for seconds. Success!

Sooo delicious! I got rave reviews serving it to my fiancées family and they had no idea it was turkey until I told them afterwards! I added an extra carrot, only used a half lb of sausage, but kept the rest of the recipe the same. I will definitely be making this again.

This turned our really great! There are just two of us, so I split this into two small loaf pans and froze one to bake later. Baked the other small loaf pan on convection at 325 for 45 minutes. I combed through the reviews and ended up making these changes: Used 1c oatmeal instead of bread crumbs and wheat germ; added some worcestershire sauce; added about 1tsp McCormick Caribbean Jerk Seasoning; used about 1/4c more ketchup for the top and a little extra in the meat. I can't eat bell pepper, so I just skipped it.

This was good, but I made it without pork and put a lot of different veggies in it. The base recipe was good.
