This unbelievably delicious! I ate half the pan, and only concern for  my table mate  made me hold back from eating the whole thing.  I am not a big Brussels sprouts fan, or rather, I was not a big Brussels sprouts fan.  Now I can't wait to have this again. Update: made for family holiday.  Empty plate.

soo good! I used a gruyere-Swiss cheese mixture instead of Cheddar cause I had it left over from making fondue and sprinkled some extra cheese on top. do NOT skimp on the cream - you want to cover the potatoes and Brussels' sprouts with the creamy-eggy mixture and also make sure to really season the eggs. Neither the Brussels' sprouts nor the potatoes will have a lot of flavor on their own, so all the flavor comes from the topping. I used tiny potatoes and pre-cooked them together with the Brussels' sprouts for 5 minutes

Followed the recipe as written, except I had some fresh parsley, so I did add a Tbs. of it, finely chopped. I liked the potatoes but, the brussel sprouts were lacking in flavor. I believe if I was to make this again, I would try leaving out the eggs, as they were scrambled throughout the dish.
