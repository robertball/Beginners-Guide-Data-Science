These were edible, but they did not turn out at all as I had hoped. These tured out light, crumbly, and cake-like.  For the frosting I used fresh squeezed OJ from the orange that I zested. Again, following the recipe exactly. It had a nice flavor, but I personally did not care for the pumpkin/orange flavor combo. These would have been much better with a plain butter cream or a cream cheese frosting. This recipe was also poorly received by my family. I will not be making this again.
