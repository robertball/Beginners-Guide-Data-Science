I gave the dry ingredients and the shortning a whiz in my food processor until it formed a small crumb, then poured this into a bowl and added the water.  This dough was so easy to work with.  I'm so impressed with myself...the dough was delightfully flaky.  I've always stayed away from making pie crust...but no more!!  Peach season is just starting here and i can't wait to try my hand at a pie with this dough!  Thank you Stephanie!!  UPDATE:  Since writing my review six months ago, I've gained a reputation for my flaky pie crust. I've been asked numerous times to make pies for gatherings. For people who have problems with this recipe, here are a few suggestions:  Add an extra tbsp of water to the mixture, roll the dough between 2 pieces of waxed paper to prevent sticking and for easy transfer,  and even though the recipe says to chill the dough, you don't have to.  I've been working with this dough without chilling it, and I find it turns out even flakier, and is so easy to work with. Hope this helps!

I wish there were 10 stars. OMG this was the best pie crust ever! 

***For anyone looking to double the recipe use 2 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 teas salt, 1 cup chilled shortening and 1/4 cup AND 2 tbs ice water. My sister doubled it wrong and although it was harder to work w/ it still tasted great! 

From reading all the reviews and will next time use the wax paper under and over the dough to help me roll it out and place it in the pie pan. But really this was so easy to make and was easy to work with, for the most part. Next time I'm going to try it w/ butter just to see the taste difference. My MIL couldn't stop talking about the crust. This is definatly a keeper! THANKS!!!!



***UPDATE*** I now make this crust all the time and I now use sticks of butter right out of the fridge instead of chilled Crisco and I like the taste much better. I've used this for all kinds of pies, even chicken pot pie and it goes great w/ anything you want to use it for. Also for a tip.. spread milk over the top of the crust and sprinkle w/ sugar before baking for a sweeter crust. Ummmm... Gotta go make some pies for Thanksgiving!

Left recipe as is, but used real butter (instead of shortening) that I had in my freezer. Sliced butter into small pieces and blended into flour mixture.  After rolling in a ball, I placed in the refrigerator for 1/2 hour and then rolled it out.  It was wonderful and flaky and in my opinion there is no need to use another pie crust recipe.

This tip is for Adtrent who has problems rolling out pie dough. On the surface you plan to roll out your pie dough, take a clean wet cloth, wipe the surface and IMMEDIATELY BEFORE IT DRIES, sprinkle flour over and rub it around. You will be able to roll out your dough without any trouble. Trust me I know. I experimented for a long time before I learned this trick. Just add more flour to the surface for more pie crusts.Good luck. Sandy

EASY! TASTY!
I didn't have any shortening (I guess I can't buy it in my country/ I don't know what it is (?))
I made the crust with butter. Turned out really great. (though there wasn't enough for one quiche)
To roll out the dough:
Take a piece of clingfilm. On top of it you put the dough. Cover it with another piece of clingfilm. Then roll out the dough. Remove the upper layer of plastic. Put it up side down in your pie pan and pull the plastic off.
So easy, I assure you won't have any problems! (And you don't need extra flour this way)
I froze the crust, then prebaked it for 15 minutes. Brushed the crust with some eggwhite and put it back in the oven for 30 seconds (so it becomes 'waterproof') then put the filling in it.
Try this recipe!

I also was disappointed that the recipe directions did not include baking instructions; the type of pie I made (Lemon Meringue) required a pre-baked crust.  Using the directions from a very similar pie crust recipe in a cookbook I have, I baked the crust at 475 degrees for about 8-10 minutes.

This recipe is exactly like a recipe I found in a 1940's cookbook.  This recipe makes pie crusts simple.  If you have time to refrigerate the dough after it is mixed, it will roll out better.  Also, using cheese cloth under the dough to roll it out will prevent sticking plus help you put it in a pie plate.
One more hint I found in that cookbook.  Glass pie plates will bake more evenly than metal.

WOW, this pie crust is the best i've ever tried making or eating. So flaky and buttery. It was great. I doubled the recipe for a double crust, and I used butter flavored shortening that I got really cold in the freezer. I rolled it out between two sheets of wax paper to avoid adding more flour, since that will make your pie dough tough. It was sooooo beautiful and wonderful, and I also added 2 tsps of sugar to it, to give it a sweetness. OMG thank you for the recipe!

First thing's first: this is not a good double crust pie.  I would not recommend this AT ALL for fruit pies.  However, it's an excellent single crust for custard and cream pies and my favorite for pumpkin pie. It will come out flaky and soft and dry on the bottom for a great tasting pie and it holds up well for presentation and serving. It's best not to overwork the dough and if it's too sticky or dry, you can adjust the flour and water some and still come  out with a great crust.   I prefer to cut the dough not like course crumbs but like pea or hazelnut sized pieces and then blend the water.  This makes the dough stick together better when kneaded and folded.  I also keep the edges of the pie covered for the duration of the cooking time.  The crust is baked through and tastes  good so you won't be scraping pie crust edges of of company's plates.

After 50 years of baking pies and after trying countless new pie crust recipes, I think I may have found another favorite! Sure, I used half butter/half shortening, and sure, there are other fine recipes (as well as some real dogs!), but this one is the first that worked this well for me using the food processor. Easy to roll out too. I just might find myself making more pies now! And just as the submitter claimed, this really IS a flaky crust, but she forgot to mention  how tender it is! This one's a winner.

This is wonderful- perfect with any pie! I use it for Apple Pie by Grandma Ople from this site- superb!! I used butter and have also used butter blend instead of shortening and turned out great! Very flaky - rave reviews from all who have tasted!

This is a very good basic pie crust recipe; while some people use butter, and others shortening, I prefer half butter and half shortening ... butter for flavor and shortening for flakiness.  The secret to good piecrust, however, is not the ingredients as much as the technique.  What works for me ... allow butter to come to room temp, blend with shortening, then refrigerate till firm.  Cut in flour and salt; sprinkle on ice water and toss to mix until it just holds together.  Form a flattened ball, and refrigerate at least 4 hours.  Allow to sit at room temp for 30 minutes, then roll out between 2 sheets of waxed paper.  Shape pie crust; refrigerate 30 minutes more before filling or baking.  This sounds like a lot of work, but each step is very quick, and I've finally learned to make great flaky piecrust this way!  UPDATE: Someone asked about freezing this.  You can refrigerate the disk for about 2 weeks, or you can freeze it for 3 months.  Great way to get a head start on the holidays!

Outstanding, SUPER FLAKY pie crust, all owed to the shortening.  I'm a real butter fanatic, but I have to admit that shortening yields an extremely flaky crust. But since it has no salt, you will need to double the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. I also add 1 teaspoon of sugar. For those having a hard time rolling out the dough due to crumbling, you're either working with dough that is still too cold.  After refridgeration, let the dough sit at room temp. for about 10 min. before rolling.  The refridgeration is really optional but it does let the gluten and protein fibers rest before you roll which strengthens the dough and prevents crumbling.  A second reason is that you might be using too much flour.  Make sure you scoop your flour into a measuring cup and lightly swipe the exceess off the top.  Too much flour will crumble and dry out the raw dough.  Good luck.  This is a great crust that can be easily doubled.  Beware - this does not make enough crust for a deep dish bottom crust.

This is the best pie crust recipe I've come across by far.  For best results, I use real shortening made from animal fat, not that awful hydrogenated vegetable shortening stuff.  If you use the latter, your pie crust will be lacking.

Perfect pie crust!  Extremely light and flaky, it melts in your mouth.  I mixed everything in my food processor and it couldn't have been easier.  Using 3 Tbs. ice water gave me the best results, and I baked it at 425 degrees for 12-15 min.

A good, simple, easy to handle pie crust. I used butter flavored shortening and it tasted very good (the finished crust that is). Remember to liberally dust your work surface and dough surface otherwise it will stick! This recipe yielded enough for one pie crust with enough left over to make a small dessert or two.

AMAZING! This is replacing Grandma's recipe (sorry, Grandma!) as our new favorite. I can't get over how flaky and lovely this is.

I did toss the first three ingredients into my food processor as I have never been any good at cutting in shortening. This worked like a charm, and then I used a fork to incorporate the ice water. I didn't bother chilling the dough before rolling it out, but I DID make sure to roll it out on top of a sheet of plastic wrap (with my silicone rolling pin, so it didn't stick).

Tip for getting a crust this soft into a pie pan: after rolling it out on the plastic wrap, roll it up--plastic wrap, too--and then unroll it, dough side down, over your pie plate.  This never fails!

This recipe will be my pie crust recipe forever! I use it to make turkey pot pie....so tasty, the perfect crust and very easy to roll out. I do the entire mix in the food processor, removing it after the water is added and it comes together! Love it!

Okay, the fact that I am rating this with 5 stars says a lot, I really have always hated pie crust, so dry and just not the best part of pie to me.  But this crust was awesome! It was really flakey and moist, not dry. So yummy! I actually ate all the crust on my pumpkin pie I made, instead of picking it all off! hehe
Super easy and delicious, thanks!

This is pretty good. I doubled mine, and added 2 tsp. of granulated sugar to it. Made cinnamon sugar treats out of the scraps of dough.

I modified this recipe a bit in an attempt to copy my grandmother's pie crust. I increased the flour to 2 cups and the salt to 1/2 teaspoon. I used 1/2 cup cold butter(NOT margarine!), 1/2 cup lard (vegetable shortening can also be used), 3 tablespoons ice water, 1 large beaten egg and 1 teaspoon vinegar. Afterwards, I cut the butter and lard into the flour as directed in the recipe, although I used a fork instead of a pastry blender. Next, I combined the ice water, vinegar, and egg in a small bowl. Then I added this mixture to the flour mixing with fork just until the flour was moistened. Then, I divided dough in half, shaped each into a ball covered in plastic wrap and refrigerated them for an hour.The result turned out to be ABSOLUTELY the BEST homemade pie crust anyone who tasted it has EVER eaten! 
NOTE: For added gloss and texture,if making a sweet double crust pie, brush the top crust with an eggwash using a beaten egg, a tablespoon of water. Sprinkle crust with sugar. If making savory double crust pie, brush with eggwash but don't sprinkle with sugar.

This is a very reliable pie crust. I like to use it for meat pies and quiche. I have used it with the shortening and I've also subbed the shortening with sweet cream butter. My favorite way is with the butter. If you are looking for a flaky pie crust - your search is over- this crust takes the cake...err pie.

I also used Butter Flavored Crisco.  I put the Crisco in the freezer for about 15 minutes to chill.  I filled a glass with ice and water and used this for my water.  I also chilled the dough for 30 minutes like it says.  This is the best crust I've ever made.  My mom makes these wonderful crusts, and I've never been able to get mine flaky.  This tasted great, and was sooo flaky.  It was so easy!  Will definitely use again!

There are so many reviews for this crust I know, but I just had to share mine as well!  I've been trying to make a great pie crust for about 25 yrs.  I finally gave up and started using the Pillsbury ones and liked them ok, but was making a peach pie like the one i had picked up fresh from my local farmers market and wanted to try my hand at a homemade crust again.  instead of crisco like many others, i used butter and added 2 tsp. of sugar, other than that oh and doubling the recipe i didn't change a thing. I was a little unsure of what 1 crust meant, enough for 1 whole pie or just 1 bottom crust, thank goodness 1 review in there gave a recipe for doubling it which i did and needed for a double crust pie.  So, my entire family said this was better than they've ever eaten anywhere ever and I agree.  I told my son, i wanted to make this and just eat it plain without filling it's that good, and he agreed!  I am going to make this for my entire family for the 4th of july week at the coast. I will never again try another recipe.  it did stick a little when rolling out, but i can live with that!  oh man is it good! please try this before any others, you won't be disappointed!

The first pie crust I've ever made that didn't crumble or crack when I rolled it out (and I've made a LOT of pie crusts)!  It rolled out beautifully into an almost-perfect circle with no problems.  I like to make a couple extras, roll them out into circles and then roll them loosely into tubes like the pre-made Pillsbury pie crusts.  Wrap in waxed paper and foil, seal, and freeze.  Allow to thaw overnight in the fridge before using.  Much better than those store-bought ones which use trans-fats and preservatives!

Great recipe. Makes one crust, so double if you're making a two crust pie.     Be sure to follow the instruction to chill the shortening and the water.  Chilling is crucial for a flaky end result, and you can make this pie even better if you also chill the flour, your mixing bowl, the appliance you use to cut the shortening into the flour, the room you work in, etc.        If you want a richer crust, you can substitute some or all of the shortening for butter, using equal portions.  However, butter won't flake as much as shortening.     My final note is that you should work the dough as little as possible. The more you roll and reuse dough, the less flaky and tender the end result will be.

Wonderful pie crust. I used butter at fridge temp and ended up using about 4 Tbls of ice  water. I think the amount of water you use will depend a lot on the weather that day. I lightly worked it, wrapped it in plastic wrap and put it in the fridge for an hour. Took it out started to roll it and it was a little too crumbly. 
So I worked it a little more (lightly) and it finally came together very nicely. Rolled it out on a lightly floured surface turning after each roll to get a nice circle shape. Baked crust was immensely flaky and had a good taste.

My first SUCCESSFULL pie crust! I tried pie crust once upon a time and don't really remember what went wrong but this was perfect instructions! I did use butter instead of shortening because I didn't have any on hand. My husband was very impressed. I'm hoping now he doesn't expect me to bake all the time...

Wonderful! Probably the best pie crust I've ever made. I put 1 TB of sugar in to make it a little sweeter, and it still turned out incredibly flaky.

I used this recipe as a base to recreate a recipe that I can't find.  I added 1 teaspoon of sugar to the flour, used cold butter instead of shortening, and added cold water to 1 teaspoon of vinegar to equal 3 tablespoons.  I am not sure exactly what the vinegar does, but you won't find a more flaky or tender crust.

All those who did not like this recipe, you don't know what you're missing!  This pie crust was perfect, I didn't have to add any more water.  Used butter instead of shortening.  It came out so pretty, like in a magazine picture!

This is my first time making pie. I made black pepper chicken pie (mini). I was looking for simple flaky crust, and found this one. 
I have to say, this is the keeper. It turns out GREAT. The pie crust is the type that melt-in-your-mouth. My husband love it. Since I read few reviews about shortening and butter, I decided to combine both. So I use 1/4 C shortening and 1/4 C butter. 
I won't bother to find another pie crust recipe anymore. Thank you for posting this recipe.

I used 4  1/2 Tsp of ice water (stirred in with a fork) Then combined the crumbs and chilled for 30 min. Rolled the dough between layers of cling film. I used this to make mini Caramel Pecan Pies and was truely impressed. Flaky, buttery, light.... exactly what I was looking for.

My first pie crust!  Perfect!  Great tips from others:  use butter, food processor, roll between parchment paper, chill before use, be quick so everything stays cold, and don't overwork to leave butter bits.  Why have I been buying pie crusts all these years?  This is WAY better, cheaper, and fast.  Huh!  Thanks!

I love this pie crust recipe altough I did change it a little. I sifted the flour and salt then took out 1/4 cup flour and set it aside. I then cut the shortening into the flour until crumbled. Then took the 1/4c reserved flour and added 3 tbl of cold water and made a paste which I then put into the flour/shortening crumbles and mix and then form into a ball.  I then just roll it out and skip the 30 min chill.  It saves on time and turns out just as good.

This was an excellent pie crust!  I used butter instead of shortening, and one trick my sister taught me is to use frozen butter and grate it with a cheese grater.  It makes it much easier to cut into the dry ingredients.

This is exactly my paternal grandmother's pie crust, and it is always excellent.  Regarding two of the comments--you don't include baking instructions with pie crust because the time and temp vary with what you're putting in the pie; as far as the comment about "don't use this for fruit pies or for double crusts"--BALDERDASH...you don't know what you're talking about.  This is an excellent crust for apple, cherry, pumpkin, mincemeat, rhubarb, blueberry, or most any pie, because it complements instead of covers up the taste and texture of the fruit.  If you're doing a double crust, make sure that you keep the edges moist and use a bit of egg dip between them before you crimp them together.  My grandmother did some slices into the upper crust to vent, then dotted the crust with softened butter and sprinkled cane sugar on top before baking.  Perfection!

Unbelievable!!!!! I've never made a pie before and this crust was simpley divine!! I made Apple Pie by Grandma Ople from this site with this pie crust (as recommended by someone) WOW! But I recommend you triple the quantity of dough to make the top of the pie as well. The original recipe barely covered my 9 inch baking dish! Wonderful!!!

Nice flaky crust. I also used butter because I had no shortening. I will try it with shortening next time, but this is the recipe that I will use for pie crust from now on. I have tried tons of different pie crust recipes because I just can't bring myself to use the prepared crusts. Thanks for the recipe. Update !! O.K. , I have now tried this piecrust  with all butter, all crisco and half crisco, half butter - ALL GOOD. I have also found that you don't even have to chill the crust. I have been rolling it out between wax paper(with a little flour sprinkled on the dough) and it always turns out perfectly. The bottom crust stays flaky no matter how soupy the filling. I don't think I have made as many pies in my lifetime as I have since I tried this recipe.  As one other reviewer said, it is great with any type of pie. Thank you..thank you for sharing!

Great crust. A little tip that I've learned...instead of using a pastry blender, put the dry ingredients into a food processor and pulse to mix them. Then add the shortening, pulsing it in until it becomes like a corn meal...Add the ice water, pulsing it in as well until a dough forms. It makes life a LOT easier!!

Beautiful! And how much cheaper are these to make then the real butter ones that arent even flaky! I threw out my old recipe once I tasted these. THis was SO insanely flaky and buttery flavored. I got the butter flavored crisco, instead of regular. And did refrigerate it to rest it for 30 minutes before rolling it. It didnt make ANY extra, in fact, was a bit chintzy on how much it made at all, REALLY had to work with it to make it fit into a regular pie crust. But wow, what a crust. Everyone at easter supper commented on how good the crust was. Calling me Martha. (I am by NO means like martha stewart, but they were making fun of me becuase I found time to make my own crust..) Little did they know it took only a few minutes to make. MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS CHILLED!!! THAT IS THE SECRET TO A GOOD PIE CRUST!! I put the shortening in the freezer for a few minutes, I measured it, and put it in the freezer. Oh one more thing, to pre bake a pie crust, you DO NOT need to add beans or rice into it as weights. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IT PRICK IT WITH A FORK ABOUT 10 TIMES ON THE BOTTOM AND PRE BAKE IT. It will not fluff up and will turn out beautifully!

I had a lot of difficulty with this crust. I am a culinary professional and while my forte is not baking, I have been pretty sucessful when it comes to pies. I couldn't keep the crust from falling apart when working with it. I used both of the suggestions: letting it warm-up a bit and adding more water to the dough and yet no luck. 

I suggest either working with it right after mixing it (what my Grandmother always does -- never chills it) or using one of two recipes that I have had great sucess with: 1. the basic pie dough recipe from "The Joy of Cooking" (the one I ended up using) which incorporates a little bit of butter, or 2. the basic tarte crust from Julia Child's "The Way to Cook" which I believe uses all butter. 

In any event, keep these things in mind if you use this recipe.

Now that I am engaged, I thought I would make an attempt to make a homemade pie crust to begin our own family traditions.  My first time around, and it turned out great!  I did get the crust a little thick, but that was due to my own inexperience and thought I had it thin... oh well, can't wait to try it again!  Used butter instead of shortening and a little more water than what was called for in the recipe.  When I rolled it out, first folded a couple drops of water, patted it fairly flat, then placed another piece wax paper on top before rolling to keep from sticking to the pin.  Took the top wax paper off and then used bottom piece of wax paper to help me flip the crust into the pan so it wouldn't crack too much on me.  Also put the pie crust (and pan) in a zip lock baggie and put in the freezer for a couple days.  (Over Thanksgiving, there's too much to do and wanted to get something made ahead of time.)  Crust still tasted great even though I froze it before baking.

This was the first crust I've ever made and it was delicious.  I made a pie the other week with a frozen one and man what a difference.  This crust was so buttery and yummy.  I didn't know exactly how to make the sides look  professional and pretty but tried to sculpt it into a decent shape.  I highly recommend this crust and do not know what those negative reviews are all about.  Thanks Stephanie!

Simple and very versatile. I made a blueberry pie, and absolutely no problems with it being soggy. I took the suggestions and brushed the bottom crust with egg white, the crust with milk and sprinkled with sugar, then pre-baked at 400 for 10 minutes. Crust works great for a lattice pie too. I covered the edges with foil after 25 minutes, then cooked for another 20 minutes- perfect!

Easy & Great tasting recipe!  For those who have trouble rolling dough, try putting it between 2 sheets of wax paper first and roll it out. Then just peel top off and turn over to place in baking dish.  This works great for me every time without the dough tearing or sticking to the roller.  Enjoy!

Very flaky as promised- but not a lot of flavor. Next time I might sub some butter for the all the shortening and maybe add sugar.

I have made this crust twice now. The first time it turned out ok but the second time it turned out a lot better. Very flaky and moist. I made it in my food processor which was fast and easy.

Giving this a 4 instead of a 5 because I am not 100% sure about the flavor as it has not been served yet (raw tasted great, sick I know).  I made this two ways, for one batch I used butter flavor crisco sticks and for the second batch I used butter, just butter.  It was more difficult to get the butter to mix in and form little balls, it looked a little too wet after 2 Tbs of water were added and it was super hard when I took it out of the fridge, think of the original product (butter Vs. chilled crisco.  However, the batch with the butter rolled more nicely and stayed together a bit better than the crisco batch, and it's more natural also.  Just be sure to leave it out of the fridge for 20 minutes or so when you are ready to use it. When I make this again I will stick with the butter mostly because of the way that it rolled out!

Perfect flaky crust, easy and quick. I used butter instead of shortening, and found that using it right away is just as good as refrigerating first then rolling out. No difference. Enjoy!

Ohhh this was REALLY GOOD!!!!!!  
So basically, I've always been sort of....scared to death -or maybe just intimidated- by making pie crust, ever since I tried it when I was about six.  Let's just say it didn't turn out that well.  As a rule, I don't care for using pastry cutters (I just hate having to always scrape out the butter that gets stuck in there and everything....I'm weird that way), and try to avoid recipes that require them: i.e. Pie Crust!  
Basically, I hadn't ventured a pie (at least not one with homemade crust) since the disastrous six-year-old experience.  
I guess you know where this is leading.  
I made it, and it  wasn't too clumpy or too dry or too sticky, and it rolled out really nice and easy, and I baked it (with apples from our old tree out back--little tiny ones that took FOREVER to peel and slice--but that's a different story), and it turned out
:::::::::::::::::::PERFECT:::::::::::::::::::::::
!!  
So thank you for defeating my fear of pie crusts AND for giving me this awesome recipe that I will certainly use again!

I am not overly experienced with making pie crusts, so i ended up needing to do this twice. First time i refrigerated the dough. Found it worked better the second time wheni omitted this step. Dough was much more pliable. I took someone else's idea and rolled the dough out between wax paper. It worked really well and did not toughen the texture of the dough. Once i got the hang of it, the second time around was much better.  The end result was flaky and melt in your mouth,

Awesome, awesome, awesome pie crust!  I've made it several times and it has come out well each time.  I always have to add a little extra ice water, though... About 5 T instead of 3...

Very easy to make, and the taste is perfect.  Two hints though: #1 Don't skip the pastry bender.  It's so much easier and the dough blends better. #2 To take the struggle out of getting the crust into the pie pan, take a large piece of wax paper and put refrigerated dough in the middle.  Put another piece of wax paper on top, and roll out to desired size.  Peel top layer of wax paper off, flip dough upside down in pie pan, and peel the other piece off.  No breaking, sooo easy!!

This was the best pie crust I have ever made. I use BUTTER and not shortning. Cut the butter in and add the water but do NOT over-mix the dough....work the dough (or crust) until it comes togther, make it into a ball and then flatten it out like a thick pancake before you put it in the fridge. I make it this way all the time and I don't even need flour on my pin or surface!

This is the recipe I have used for 29 years with two exceptions. First, I was taught by a Russian baker to use lard. Yep, lard.  You will not believe how much more flake and tender the crust is than with butter or shortening. That said use the product you like and you will still have a winning pie crust.  Second exception, work shortening, butter or lard into flour until pea size balls form. Refrigerate 2 hours and then add ice water before rolling out. It will be a breeze to work with. This increases your flakiness.  If you inadvertently used too much flour, as this recipe is not in weight but cup measurement and that can happen all too easy. RELAX and add a drop or two more water until it forms a nice ball that sticks together easy. Not a wet, dripping ball but a ball of pliable dough. Roll out on a lightly floured surface. The colder the dough- the flakier the crust and the ease of the roll out. I no longer use measurement but eye ball the the product. Enough fat in the flour will give you pea size balls and enough water will give you a ball of pliable dough.   For you first timers, go on- be fearless and experiment with your technique. You'll be making award winning crust too in no time.

I doubled the recipe because I was making a pot pie - it seemed to make way more than I needed.  It also was quite greasy, when I went to roll it out I added a lot of flour because it was so soft (even after sitting in the fridge for 24+ hours).  I admit the shortening was super cold, but my mom doesn't chill her shortening at all.  I did use butter flavored crisco & the actual taste of the dough was good.  I just think maybe it didn't need as much shortening.

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it.

I like to consider myself a good to very good cook, however I've never been able to make a good pastry crust. I've made this one twice and was successful both times!!! (kinda wondered if the first time was just a fluke haha)

I love this crust!  I am not an expert baker but this recipe makes me look like I am!  I have used it for fruit pies, pot pies (chicken and turkey).  I tripled the recipe and got enough for three full pies.  I basically took the butter right out the fridge, cut it into tablespoon portions, put the flour and salt in my food processor 1st and pulsed a few times to combine.  Then I dropped in the chunks of butter and pulsed until I got a coarse crumb.  Drizzled in the water by the tablespoon and VOILA!  Dumped out the mixture on to a cutting board and gently formed a ball and chilled for 1/2 hour.  Other reviews I read here said they didn't chill so I tried it with the next batch.  Worked beautifully! I put the dough between two sheets of cling wrap and rolled out in record time!  Thanks so much for this great recipe, Stephanie!`

I'm struggling with the rating, as I DID get a really flaky pie crust for my pumpkin pie using this recipe. It was SUPER easy to throw together and rolling it out was a cinch! But, following the recipe and just using shortening resulted in a rather flavorless pie crust... I'll try again with half butter next time, as I think that will help tremendously. And I also found that it would've been nice to have it make a little more dough... to do nice, pretty edges, but I found that it was a little short. Again, I'll give it another shot before I give up because it really was wonderfully tender and flaky!

I love cooking but am not into baking so had no clue how to make a crust for a pot pie (I usually use a premade or even Pilsbury crescent roll dough on occasion).  I found this recipe and followed it exactly. As soon as he dug in my husband remarked on how good and flaky the crust was and asked me what I did different.
Saved this one, thanks for sharing.

I do not like the taste of the shortening, so I use 1/3 cup unsalted butter in a 1/2 cup size measuring cup, then fill to the top with crisco, I then chill it for 30 minutes in the fridge.   for the dough I dump my flour and salt into my food processer then add the chilled butter and shortening mixture 1 tbsp at a time, then drizzle in 2 tbsp ice water, then chill it as directed for 30 minutes, the resulting baked dough is light and crispy with a buttery flavor.

This was a great recipe for pie crust, it was flaky just as promised and I loved the hint of sweet! The only thing I changed was I did not put it in the fridge for 30 minutes before rolling out. Was in a hurry and you know what? it worked just fine! In the past I have always had problems with pie crusts when I put them in the fridge to cool...

I had a REALLY hard time with this. It was impossible to roll out. It looked like cookie dough. I followed the recipe exactly...Not sure what I did wrong! I'm throwing out a whole pie tonight and hoping I can grab one in the morning before Thanksgiving dinner! Thanks anyway!

This is the recipe I was raised on.  We are big time pie fanatics in my family and this is the best crust ever!  Make sure you don't beat the dough too much.  The less you mix the more flaky your crust will be.

I can't believe it! I finally found a recipe that makes the PERFECT pie crust. All the reviews were right -- it is extremely flaky and wonderful. Like another reviewer, I was disappointed that it didn't have the directions to bake off the shell -- but 400 degrees at 7 minutes did the trick for me (electric oven).   I was extremely impressed. Normally my pie crusts are epic failures, but this is really a no brainer. Chilling the shortening beforehand really helps. This is now my go-to crust!

I am a proffesional pastry chef and this is the best recipe you will ever use for pie crust. You can even substitute 2T. of the butter for 2T. of shortening.

Always used Grandmas "flaky" pie crust but this one is flakier.  My husband really liked this crust and he is a pretty good food critic.  I have made this several times in a weeks period.  I altered it a little the second and third times I made it once I used 1 Tbls of vanilla in place of 1 Tbls of water and the second time I used 1 Tbls of almond flavoring in place of 1 Tbls of water.  This would be a personal preference but the almond was AWESOME!  Thanks for a great recipe.  SSSSSH don't tell grandma she's been replaced.=(

I made my first apple pie using this crust recipe. I used butter instead. Followed the recipe and it came out fantastic. I loved it. I am not a cook and love the simplicity of this recipe. Forget the store bought pie crust, I will be making my own pie crust from now on!

Woohoo!  A great pie crust!  I made one change, substituting half of the amount of shortening for butter and whirled the ingredients in the food processer.  Done in a flash and the crust was absolutely wonderful!  :)

This is a great recipe. The one I've been using for years. I usually double or even quadruple the recipe to make a lot of pies come fall and thanksgiving. Here's what I like to do with it. I mix a tablespoon of vanilla extract into the water to give the dough some more flavor and I add a touch of sugar (about 2 T.)per batch. In the summer when making berry or peach/nectarine pies I like to use lemon extract but only about 1 teaspoon instead of 1 T. otherwise it is too strong.

I use crisco butter flavored cooking sticks for this recipe. Easy to cut into cubes and incorporate into the dough. Also, if you don't have time to refrigerate, lightly dust a sheet of wax paper, put dough on top, lightly dust dough and then top with another sheet of wax paper and roll out. Then just peel off top paper and invert into pie plate and carefully pull off other wax paper. This is a great crust and I have used it several times.

Use a cheese grater to cut up frozen real butter. It folds into the flour with almost no water. I used far less than a single tablespoon. Excellent addition to this recipe.

This was terrible. The three tablespoons of ice water did make it come together in the food processor but when I rolled it out it wouldn't go thin enough and broke off in about ten pieces. I used butter instead of shortening as I didn't have it at my store. It wouldn't get any thinner or else it would just break apart and then I had to hodge podge it into the pie pan. It turned out to be a biscuit crust. Not flaky. It was much too thick. My advice for anyone wanting to use this recipe, you may well need more than 3 tblspns of ice water otherwise it will not roll properly. No one ate the crust on my homemade pie.

I made this pie crust for all my pies at Thanksgiving.  It was delicious and tender/flakey!!! even the bottom turned out geat!  I did add 2T. of sugar and I didn't really measure the water.  I chilled and cubed my butter flavored crisco and used icewater.   It was the best crust I have ever made and now I am not afraid to make pie crusts!  I also wrapped them in plastic and put them in the fridge before rolling, rolled them between 2 sheets of wax paper and put them back in the fridge before baking or filling.  Now if I ever learn how to do pretty edges, my pies will be perfect!

This has become my standard pie crust for pot pies and desert pies. I use lard (makes for a super-flaky crust); if it's a desert pie I do half-lard half-butter and add some sugar (maybe 1 or 2 tablespoons). I flatten the ball of dough into a disk (I usually put it in a gallon-sized baggie first, and then flatten it to a round almost the full size of the baggie.. after cooling, just cut the baggie's edges and peel off of the dough). If you flatten it before refrigerating, it won't crack on the edges as much when you roll it out later. This recipe received high praise from my mother, master of the excellent pie crust! Thanks, Stephanie!

Excellent crust. I haven't attempted a pie crust in a long time because the time or two I did, it was a big flop. This recipe worked great! I used wax paper below and above the dough to roll it out and that made it super easy to move to the pan. I used butter flavored Crisco and that made it extra yummy. As suggested, I spread egg white on both the top and bottom crust to prevent them from becoming too soggy and it worked well. The crust was tender, flaky, and delicious. I'm so excited that I don't have to buy those mediocre, yet expensive pie crusts any more!

Very easy to make, always have the ingredients in the pantry, extremely flakey.  My only problem was, once I have this rolled out, I can't get it off the counter...even when I liberally flour work surfaces.  Can anyone give me any tips?  I didn't have wax paper on hand, so I tried aluminum foil, and it stuck to that, too.  I managed to get a bottom crust by pushing pieces of dough into the pan, but my top crust was basically rolled out pieces that I put on the top.  It didn't look bad, but it didn't look like a picture perfect pie.  Oh well, the taste was picture perfect, and so I'm still rating this a 5 star recipe.  Any tips are appreciated.  Thank you for the recipe!

Easy and tasty, even though leave out the salt.  I'll be making my pie crusts from now on.  I've found it helps to roll out dough on a floured piece of wax paper.

This pie crust is so simple and delicious.  I use it on ALL my pie recipes.  Flaky and 
sturdy enough to hold any filling.  I suggest chilling in freezer for an hour.  My recipe
is always better when I chill for a long time...even better overnight! Make sure to double
recipe for lattice.

Dont like this recipe at all.  It has way too much shortening in it.  When cutting in the shortening to the flour it had already formed a ball.  I still added the water just to see if this recipe had some special secret. It was much easier to roll this dough out with out chilling it.   It completely crumbled when cold.  While cooking this it bubbled and got really greasy.  Trying to serve it was impossible.  Crumbled all over the place.  Taste was very greasy and tasteless.

My first from scratch pie crust attempt, and it was perfect.  I used this crust to make a strawberry pie, and it was exactly what I wanted and was, indeed, very flaky. I have since tried other pie crust recipes, but none have turned out as good as this one.

Wow! So easy and so good! I used half butter and half Crisco and it turned out flaky and amazing. The reviewer who said this crust wouldn't work for a double crust pie was crazy. It was perfect.

Easy and quick I  used stick butter and one extra tablespoon iced water.  I reserved a little of the flour for rolling out, and had no problems rolling/placing the crust.  Baked it at 425 for 8 minutes, then 350 for five per the instructions in my quiche recipe.

I've used this recipe for 20 years without a failure.  I chill all ingredients first then mix in my food processor, then allow dough to rest in the fridge and chill again.   When rolling out, I carefully fold and roll 2 or 3 times.   My kids would eat the crust first because it was their favorite part of any pie.

I tried this crust last Christmas and in this last year I have made more pies than in all the 30 years previous, combined!  This is the best crust, so flaky!!!  I use it with the "Apple Crumb Pie" recipe, also on this website, and I now make THE BEST PIE.  Seriously, it tastes like a pie from an expensive restaurant, yet it is so easy and quick to make!  I am still impressed everytime I make it and I am NOT a baker!  I really don't think anyone can go wrong with this recipe...super yummy!

I don't have to buy pie crusts anymore!  No guessing and it gives it just enough sweetness. I added an extra Tbsp of ice water - I put ice water in a bowl and measured it out from there to be sure it was nice and cold - and 1 tsp. of apple cider vinegar. I also used butter flavored Crisco(R) that I now keep in the freezer. I roll it out between to pieces of waxed paper.

Best pie crust I've ever made!!! I used unsalted frozen butter instead of shortening.  I know I used more than 3T of ice water but that is the way it is usually... This pie crust was literally better than the fillings I put in it.  It was buttery and flaky but didn't fall apart on your plate.  Everyone at Thanksgiving dinner raved over it.  For those of you having issues rolling, I put my dough in the freezer while making filling.  Then I rolled it between wax paper with liberal amounts of flour and had no issues with it falling apart or sticking.  It didn't even fall apart while making a lattice-top pie, which I've had problems with in the past. Most importantly though, this was the best-tasting pie crust I've had.  And I'm the type of person who usually doesn't even eat the crust.

This crust turned out great for my first try.  I read one reviewer who added butter in addition to the shortening. I tried mixing quarter cup butter to quarter cup shortening and it was the best crust that I tasted.

Really simple pie crust that turns out pretty savory, but is a great compliment to any really sweet pie. I'd suggest multiplying the ingredients by 1.5 for one pie crust and 2.5 for a double pie crust unless you're gifted at rolling an extremely thin crust.

INCREDIBLY flaky! I've had crusts where the top was flaky but the bottom was gooey, but this one was super flaky the whole way through.  It was my third time making pie crust (first time as an adult) and I was very worried, but it was great!  I made sure to use very icy water and a chilled bowl.  I ended up using at least 7 Tbsp of water.

Easy even for someone who has never made pie crust.  I used butter from the fridge and added 2 t of sugar as another viewer suggested.  I used this to make Homemade Top Tarts from this site and it was so yummy.

Fabulous, Forgiving, Forever my crust recipe. This was so simple, and even though I feared I was messing with it too much, it turned out amazing! I used cold butter instead of shortening as suggested by several others. I actually tripled the recipe and made one baked crust for Sugar Cream Pie I (on this site), following other's directions for baking at 475 degrees for about 15  min., then coating w/ egg white and baking another 30 seconds to water proof it. Not sure that was necessary, but it didn't hurt. The other two I used as a double crust for Peach-A-Berry Pie (on this site), the absolute best pie ever! Someone else said this crust was not good as a double crust or for fruit pies, but I don't know why not. It was wonderful and did not get soggy even after 24 hours in the fridge. The only thing I'd do differently is not to try and triple the recipe...it didn't save me any time...it's hard to blend it all together by hand. If I needed that much crust again, I'd just make each one individually. I found that rolling it out between sheets of plastic wrap immediately after making was a cinch. I took another's advice on that, too, thinking it wouldn't work, but I didn't have wax paper, so I tried it. The other two balls I refrigerated until I needed them, (30 min or so) and they were a pain to roll out that way. Too hard. Thanks!!

Very good.  I doubled the recipe for use in an apple pie and was pleased by the tasty flaky crust!  Suggestions:  for the "flaky" you need to keep the fat cold.  It helps to use refrigerated shortening (or butter, which I'm going to try next) to start.  Also I use the thin plastic bag for vegetables from the grocery store to gather the dough after you've tossed the water in--that is, I turn the bag inside out and then use it like a glove to scoop the dough out of the bowl.  Then you pull the bag back over your hand and you now have the dough in a nice ball, bagged, that I can give a squeeze or two to further combine the wet/dry and then put in the fridge to chill well.  I do roll out the dough between two pieces of wax paper.  I find dusting the dough ball with a little flour before rolling cuts down on sticking.  To release after rolling, peel off one wax paper, then put it back and flip the dough over and peel the other wax paper off.  Try not to overwork the dough, but if you need to try again chilling the dough always makes it easier to handle.  Everyone loves homemade pie, so have fun with this!

This recipe is outstanding! The crust is flaky and just sweet enough (but not overly sweet so it couldn't be used for a potpie recipe).   I used it for miniature cherry pies (or daisy cakes as I like to call them) and they turned out great. The only reason I am not giving this recipe 5 stars is the lack of cooking instructions. While I understand what you do with the recipe dictates this a standard such as how many pie shells it makes (and their size) and how long to cook them would have helped out a lot while baking.   I used to use a recipe that called for 475F and stuck with that temperature for about 10 or so minutes (for my mini pies, which are quite small but double sided).   I will use this recipe again :)

I am giving this a 5 star rating b/c the crust was phenominal... however I was dissapointed that the directions didn't indicate whether this was for a double or single.  I only made one and it was not enough for a top and bottom.  So now I know for next time.  Otherwise, it was so easy to make and most ingredients i usually have on hand... and if I don't have the shortening, I do have butter!  Thank you!

I found the dough a bit hard to work with, but it was my first time making my own dough. I have no idea what it tasted like, since the pie was a gift to my boyfriend's family, but ever since I sent it he keeps asking me to make "something else with that dough." I have become known as the pie lady, and they were disappointed that I didn't make this crust and Grandma Ople's apple pie from this site for them again.

Excellent!
This was the first time I made my own crust, so I was nervous about how it would turn out. No worries though, it came out BEAUTIFULLY!
I used butter-flavoured Crisco instead of normal, since I was making a sweet, apple pie (Apple Pie by Grandma Ople). Also, I added 1 tsp of white sugar to further compliment the contents of the pie.
After all of the intense warnings of stickiness, I had my wax paper ready, but it was unnecessary. Since I didn't have any pastry equipment, I just used my hands to combine everything. Next time I'll have to flour my hands first-- that was the time when the dough was really sticky! But after it was all combined, it wasn't sticky at all. It was very easy to work with and handle. I refrigerated it for about 15 or 20 minutes before putting it into the pie dish.
I lightly coated the bottom crust in egg whites and put it in the oven for 2 minutes at 400 degrees to prevent sogginess. I used a lattice crust for my pie which, for the most part, went very well. HOWEVER-- this crust tears fairly easily, so be very careful with how thin you press it while you're working with it.
Overall, a big thumbs up! I will be using this crust again and again :)

Wow...so easy and yummy! I used half shortening half butter and it turned out flakey and light. Mixed in the cold shortnening/butter mixture in the Kitchenaid Mixer using the metal whisk attachment and rolled it out onto a silicone mat topped with wax paper...absolutely no sticking! The dough rolled out perfectly the first time and I was able to invert it into the pie plate and remove the silicone sheet with gleeful ease. This recipe is a keeper.

I am a butter extremist who doesn't have much to do with the flavorless goo called shortening.  In fact, for the past six years, you simply could not find it in my kitchen. But now, shortening is back and this recipe is the reason. You won't get a simpler, easier to manage crust that comes out perfectly light and flaky.  It is a bit sticky so you need waxed paper and flour to roll it out, but do not worry, unlike some pie crusts, the extra flour has no adverse affect on the finished texture. As a final note, when I'm ready for something a bit less "basic" I throw in roughly 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/2 tsp. all spice for each pie crust made.  It makes an excellent compliment to pumpkin and apple pies.

Great recipe! It goes well with all pies. I'm going to make my next pie trying the butter flavored shortening to see if it makes it even better. Also, I thought to add a recent tip that I have tried and love -rolling out your chilled dough between 2 silicone baking mats makes homemade pie crusts almost effortless. The dough doesn't stick(thus I ended the night without having my counter, or myself, covered in flour)and the mat is heavy (flexible, but not flimsy) making it much easier to fold the crust into the pie plate than with parchement/wax paper!

it's my first time doing a pie, so i'm not sure how to rate this. it's a quick recipe, took less than 5 min to prepare. after chilling, it was easy to roll out and didn't break easily when lifting and fitting into the pie dish. it baked well, the top came out nice and flaky, and the bottom didn't get soggy. plain on its own, but goes extremely well with the filling (i was doing an apple pie) *Update: Used this recipe for the bottom crust of an apple crumble. This time I added 1 tbsp white sugar, 1/2 tbsp vanilla and upped ice water to 3-1/2 tbsp. Gave it more flavor and a mild sweetness. The added sugar made the crust crunchier as well:) Also, I used butter instead of shortening-personal preference. A trusted recipe in my book. Upped rating to five stars!

I was incapable of making pie crust before I found this recipe.  Thank you for giving me the gift of being able to make the one thing in this world I coudn't!  :)  It is wonderful, easy to make, follow directions EXACTLY!  Be sure to cool the shortening!  I think that is the trick!  YAY!!!!

This was only my second time making a pie crust and if I can do it, anyone can!  It turned out so delicious and flaky!  Absolutely melted in your mouth.  I doubled the recipe in order to have a double crust...I made this with a chicken pot pie, and can't wait to make it again!  This is the ultimate flaky pie crust and I will be making this again and again!

This is an excellent "base" for a pie crust. The only thing I changed was replacing half of the shortening for butter. I chilled all the ingredients first and pulsed no longer than 30 seconds in processor and rolled out the dough between plastic wrap to avoid over flouring. When I use this as a crust for a fruit pie, I add a tablespoon of granulated sugar.
Very flaky and great buttery flavor!Will use this recipe over and over.

Excellent!  For recipes calling for a pre-baked pie crust, I simply bake the rolled out crust that is in a pie pan for 20 minutes at 375 degrees.  Also, I've found that using butter flavored Crisco helps the flavor a lot!!!

I found it very difficult to mix everything together smoothly. Grandma's secret pie crust is a thousand times better. Would not recommend this one.

I made four pies over the holidays with this. Three pumpkins and a pecan. I tried one pumpkin and a pecan pie doing the directions exactly. Then later tried two pumpkin pies with the shortening not chilled and not bothering with chilling the dough for thirty minutes. Every pie turned out terrific! It makes no difference whether the ingredients are chilled or not, it will still turn out beautiful and flaky. It can go in the oven for an hour and still won't burn. You can't ask for any better than that... that beats store-bought. You want the best-you got it! This crust definitely lives up to its name.

So simple but OH SO GOOD! I use this recipe every time I bake a pie, it's been 4 months or so, and 12 pies or so. :) It's great with sweet pie like fruit pies or meal pies like meat pie or quiche. It's flakey wonderful even if you're a first time pastry maker. Thanks for this recipe.

This was the best pie crust recipe I've ever used.  The chilling of some of the ingredients was the key to the flakiness.  I highly recommend it.

I will never again buy a frozen pie crust.  This was so easy and it was so good and flaky.  My husband loved it and he is hard to impress.  I used it twice over thd holidays and it turned out great both times.  The first pie was awful, but everyone kept saying that it was a really good crust though.  He!He!

This is a great pie crust.  It's flaky (true to its name), light and not too sweet; it's a perfect complement for any pie.  It would also work well with flaky pastry recipes.  Tastes like it would complement chicken pot pie, as well.  The recipe can be made with butter, too.  This version needs less water than with shortening.  

I am still trying to work out the exact amount of water needed with the shortening.  I think it is closer to 4 TBSP than 3 and some drops.  (3 and drops worked well with butter.)  It seems to come out quite dry.  It's fine baked, but is difficult to roll and put into the pie plate without breaking and cracking.

I am not a huge crust fan but my "other" is-- this strikes a nice balance of subtle, yet tasty and flaky.  We both like the flavor quite a bit.

Needs a little moisture modification, but worth the effort of getting to know.  All in all, a great pie crust recipe!

Excellent recipe!  My first homemade pie crust, and with these results, I'm never going back!  Roll between plastic film for easy transfer.  I didn't use film the first time and it stuck to the board.  I ball it together and roll it out again; I thought it was ruined, but crust came out very tender, very flakey.

FANTASTIC!!! Just one way to describe this pie crust. I used butter instead of shortening and had to make double batches for my holiday pies. Such an easy crust and comes out so tender and flaky. I definately recommend anyone looking to make their own crusts to try this pie crust.  thank for sharing!

Excellent!!  I used this recipe for quiche lorraine and i was extremely impressed.  Like another reviewer stated, I was also very impressed with myself.  I usually either buy pre-made, frozen or use the boxed pie crust mix.  I did learn a nice little tip from a good friend, when rolling it, place it on wax paper and you can flip it into the pie pan much easier.  Will definitely replace my former methods!!  Thanks Stephanie!  Now I don't have to say "yes, i made the pie crusts myself (from a box mix)!!"

Very good recipe; the crust is as flaky as it promises to be. I doubled the recipe for a lattice top as well, but needed to add 1/3 cup more water to make the dough ball-able. I froze the dough for a little over an hour, and although it cracked a bit while rolling, it turned out very managable and sturdy. Thanks!

I found this recipe in the Summer of 2011.  My daughter and I baked one different pie each week that summer.  This is THE ONLY recipe we use for all our pie baking.  It comes out PERFECT everytime.  I do not roll it out.  For us, it's so much easier to just spread it out in the pie dish itself.  Happy baking!!!!

GOOD LORD this was fantastic and a MONKEY could make it. I used butter instead of Crisco because YUM -- why not? It's better for you than Crisco & actually has a key ingredient that makes pies taste better: FLAVOR. Plus I never make pies since my Crisco crust recipe is wholly underwhelming. I mostly just buy a crust rather than waste my time. Now, unfortunately, I will be making this crust like it's going out of style & stuffing everything I can think of into it. My five year-old is sitting here with blueberries smeared all over her cheeks and she's LICKING THE PLATE CLEAN (just like mom taught her). Thanks to you, STEPHANIE, and your absurdly good crust -- I will be pinching far more than an inch when this summer is over. Wait ... there's pumpkin & apple pie in the fall ... and pecan ... pot pies in the winter.. HELP!!!  Thanks as well to the reviewer who explained the best way to double this recipe ... and my dress size ...

I have to tell you that I have NEVER made a piecrust without difficulty...until this one.  Four ingredients in the food processor, pulse a bit, and you're done.  This pie crust was so easy to work with, and I ended up with a flaky and tender crust.  I'd give this 10 stars if possible, it was perfect, and is now my go-to pie crust recipe.  Thank you, thank you, stephanie!

This recipe is PERFECT!!  Light and buttery crust is your reward.  Didn't change a thing!  Was worried that it did not say to pre-bake the pastry shell, thought the dough underneath would be soggy because of the filling but in fact it was perfect!  I made extra dough for the lattice crust.  Everyone had second helpings  :D

This crust came out hard for me.  Admittedly, I am a novice pie crust maker, but I followed all the instructions...keeping everything cold and not overworking the dough.  I don't know what I did wrong???  I did use butter instead of shortening (per some of the reviews), maybe that makes a difference.

Maybe I overmixed my dough, but I didn't get a flaky pie crust.  :-(  The flavor was great, but it was solid all the way through, not flaky like many of the reviews led me to believe.

Still, this beats the pants off of store bought pie crust.  I'll make it again, and try a different mixing technique to achieve the coveted flaky crust.

Great and simple recipe. I didn't change anything, but I did double up the recipe to make both the shell and the covering for the pie. You really only need to roll out the dough nicely for the top - if you're only doing a shell, nobody is going to see it and you can just press the dough into the pie dish. I baked the shell about 15 minutes at 350 before filling it, so it would harden up a bit and I could put my filling in. I did dab some milk on the covering also. It took quite a while to brown at 350, but it was absolutely delicious anyway. I did use half butter and half shortening and I may have gone with all butter next time, as I imagine it would taste even better. I didn't chill the dough, either. I used it to make a thanksgiving-leftovers pie, and it was amazing!

This is by far the best recipe for pie crust you can find. Follow the directions exactly and most important chill the water and shortening and a metal bowl if you have one! It makes a difference.

I previously had horrible luck with pie crusts; they never turned out well. This one however, is perfect: VERY buttery and just the right amount of flakiness. The only modification I made was to use butter instead of shortening.
My search for a pie crust recipe is over!

This is the best crust recipe I have ever made. The only thing I do different is I use lard instead of shortening. If I used shortening I would have to give it 4 stars.

This is a no-fail pie crust and the only one I use now.  It bakes up beautifully, is easy to work worth and tastes delicious and flaky.  I've received numerous compliments on both appearance and taste.

Came out great on first try. I only use butter for my shortening. Mixing by hand seems to be the way to go, turns out  very flaky. Subsequently used my mixer but turned out cookie dough-ish. Great simple recipe, just need to put a little elbow grease into it..

I have used this recipe numerous times, makes a fantastic pie crust!  I do usually end up using more water than the 3 Tablespoons that it calls for, but that's about the only change I make.  Sometimes add a touch of vinegar to give it a little extra something but overall a perfect pie crust recipe.

absolutely love this recipe. I've been using it for some time. I use it for all my pies that I make. Everyone loves the flakiness of the crust. It reminds them of their grandma's pies they say. Very Impressed...

very disapointed in the crust , it had to much shorting . I could not get the dough to roll out even with the use of wax paper and plastic rap. the dough didnot form crums it made a salid dough ball. When baking the crust burned even at a lower temp and a longer cooking time. the shorting needs to be cut in half as compaired to other recipes that I compaired to in the different cook books that I have, and that my doughter uses. from better crocker vookbook. I am every dis apointed in this recipe as to all the reviews that I read that said this was the best one that they had ever found.I would not even rate this recipe for all the trouble that it has caused. I give this recipe a zero ratting.

I never cared about crust on pies and would just cut them off or eat the topping/filling only. This crust was amazing. We love butter in our home so I used 1/4 cup shortening and 1/4 cup butter. Turned out perfect.

Update- used this again for a crust for quiche. Turned out great again.

This turned out great. I have made lots of pies...but still am no expert at crust. This was easy to work with and turned out great for our pumpkin pie.

Simple and wonderful!  I wouldn't recommend this to someone who hasn't had a bit of experience rolling pie crust (or something similar), as it is not the easiest to roll out, but it was a virtually perfect pie crust!

Simple and delicious.  I doubled it to make a chicken pot pie.  Used half butter, half shortening for flavor.  And I added a pinch of baking powder to help with the flakiness, but that's just something I do every time I make a pie crust -- I'm sure it's fine without it.

To be honest I've always used pre-made crusts so I was a little scared to make a home made crust. My mother always complained about the dough ripping or sticking to the table. Not a problem with this recipe. I was so impressed with myself for making it with ease. I doubled the recipe to make a double crust for a 9 inch apple pie and had a small amount of dough left over to make  "cookies" with sugar for my 2 year old. I didn't have a pastry blender so I used a fork and it worked perfectly.  I made this dough the night before making my pie so I refrigerated it for 12 hours before rolling it. Right out of the fridge, it rolled out with no problems between two pieces of parchment paper.

I have made this pie crust four times in the past two weeks, it comes out perfect every time. I would recommend egg washing becuase it really makes a difference. I have been freezing the pies and when they are thawed and heated up it still comes out great!

So easy!  I doubled this (add a little more water if you do) and used it for Ashesp's blueberry pie.  Used butter instead of shortening.  Trick: use a grater or microplane to grate the very cold butter into the flour mixture.  I had to do a little cutting with knives since the microplane made the butter tend to clump up, but it's so much easier than cutting in bigger pieces of butter.

THIS is the perfect pie crust!Flaky and light - it's a wonderful match to any pie.  To make a double crust pie - do not just double the recipe. Use 2 1/4 cups flour, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 cup chilled shortening and 1/4 cup + 2 tbsp ice water.  Easy to handle and delicious every time!

If I could give this more stars I would! I have struggled with my crust making skills for years...but no more! Thank you thank you!! I made this in my food processor and it couldn't have been easier. I did do a few things based on others reviews. I used butter in place of crisco. I rolled it out between 2 sheets of wax paper and I also baked it for 15 minutes, gave it an egg white wash and put it back in the oven for 30 seconds to 'waterproof' it. I made 3 strawberry pies using this recipe and they all turned out fabulous! This is now my go to recipe for crusts! I can't thank you enough for sharing it!

It must be me - I made this 2x today and they both fell apart as I rolled them.  The first I refrigerated as instructed and the second I did not.  I know it's me - because I've tried to make pie crust my entire 45 years of marriage and just can't!  Irritates me that my husband can (LOL).  So, off to the store to buy premade, again.  I'm sure the pie crust is fine though, I just do something wrong, and this time I did not over roll it as I sometimes do.  I even had my husband watched me.

Absolutely the worst experience I've ever had in the kitchen.  I followed directions exactly.  I did not overmix or over-handle it.  I put the shortening in the fridge the night before, I used less than 3T of ice water, and I chilled the dough disk in the fridge all day.  It had the consistancy of a cookie dough, not a pie crust.  I had to add a LOT more flour just to get it to roll out and then it kept breaking.  I more or less smooshed it into my pie plate because I had no alternative crust on hand.  I really wish I had the same experience as others b/c it looked so easy on paper.

Easy & fuss-free recipe! Like others, I used my food processor to mix flour and shortening and then poured the mixture into another bowl. I then added the 3 tbsp of iced-cold water manually to form the mixture into a ball. The recipe should have said to form dough as a DISK instead of ball for chilling; as after chilling for 1 hour, it was rather difficult to roll the dough over and I had to wait for a couple of minutes for the dough to soften a bit before rolling otherwise it breaks! The taste was good but still lacks a wee bit of the usual pie sweetness. Perhaps by adding 1 tbsp of confectioners sugar would help to balance up the taste.

I will always use this crust from now on.  My boss told me to substitute ice cold vodka, which I did. (The alcohol bakes out of it) The vodka made it even flakier and dang near perfection.   I also thinly coat the crust with milk, then sprinkle sugar on it, just before adding filling.

Cooking is a wonderful thing.  You can always learn from someone.  This recipe goes beyond all those that dare to compete.  This recipe is phenomenal.   As a pro... I look for people to WOW me and this person has done so.  I will add this to my recipe box with pride.   Tips: make sure you have the coldest of cold ingredients.  It's crucial to have cold shortening and ice cold water.  After you make the dough let it set in the fridge as instructed (atleast an hour). Follow the recipe to the tee.  It's a great recipe! When I chilled it for over an hour it rolled out perfectly.  No cracks or breaks!  Make sure you wrap it while you chill it.  Great recipe!!!

This is my go-to pie crust!  Very easy and simple. I've used if several years.  I have a dessert business out of my home, mainly wedding cakes, but have recently expanded to pies! I use half Crisco/half real butter. I always get great responses to this crust.  If making a dessert pie I add about 1TBS of sugar as well.  It also makes a great crust for chicken pot pie! If I can do it, you can do it!

It worked well, and it tasted good. But it did not taste *great*, it lacked that special something. I used butter flavored crisco, and perhaps in the future I will use half crisco and half real butter to try and get the taste I want out of it, because it really did flake very nicely :) Thanks for the recipe!

Yum!  I used butter and 1 tsp of sugar as others have stated. It was my first pie crust...I made apple dumplings. Sooo good. Hard to roll out.  I ended up using way more ice water to get it to form.  Will make again.

Wow. This was amazing. I took the other reviewers advice and I added just a little bit more ice water and it was the perfect consistency to roll. I also didn't chill it before hand. I took it right out of the bowl and then laid it between two layers of wax paper, and then roll it out that way. That way, when I transferred it to the pan dish, it was about a million times easier than ever before!  This was sooooo delicious, no one would believe that I had made it myself :)

great recipe, I use it for making the chicken pot pie as well as for berry pies.  Used a mix of butter and shortening for a bit more flavor.  Easy and turns out great - thanks for a recipe that has helped me overcome my fear of making pie crusts from scratch!

A good basic and delicious crust. I didn't have cheese cloth to roll out on, but I rolled out with waxed paper on top and bottom after chilling in the freezer for 30 minutes and it came out perfect!

This really is your traditional pie crust.  I prefer Martha's still.  I gave it 4 stars because I changed a few things:  1. I rolled it out in between parchment paper, I found it helped the dough stay together and roll out easier.  2. I used pie weights and cooked the shell for 10-15 mintutes to make the shell crispier.  3. I used butter not shortening.

Love this recipe for fruit pies and chicken pot pie. Instead of a pastry blender someone suggested using a single butter knife and it works great. I am so happy to have found a recipe that makes me seem like a crust expert. Don't change anything!

Great basic recipe. I used my hands (clean of course) to mix it all in, this seemed to make it much easier to mix. Used it with a quiche it was the perfect pairing. I cooked it for 10 minutes before at 325 and once my quiche was done my crust was not burned.

Mine didn't flake, but it still tasted pretty good.  Didn't know how long to bake it, but it ended up okay.  May try it again...we'll see.

I doubled this recipe to make an apple pie. I made sure not to overwork it to keep it from being tough. It was so fluffy and flaky! It is a wonderful recipe. I basted the top with milk and sprinkled sugar and it just came out perfect! Thank you for the recipe.

I was away from my kitchen and needed a dough recipe so I could whip up a pie at the last minute, so I tried this one. I was in a rush and only had butter so I used the food processor and processed flour and butter then drizzled the cold water in while I pulsed a few times. Then I dumped it onto a floured board and formed two balls I doubled the recipe) There wasn't time to chill the dough, so I simply rolled it out between two pieces of plastic wrap and it was quite easy to work with. The best news is that it actually tasted as good as my tried and true recipe in my kitchen file. This makes a very light and flakey crust - everyone who ate the pie remarked at how delicious the crust was. This was so good, in fact, that I plan on baking it side by side with my regular recipe to determine whether or not I should begin using this as my standard.  No need to worry if you don't have time to chill this dough - you can be pretty confidant that whatever you make will taste delicious with this dough as your base!

This was the flakiest crust that I have ever made!  I used chilled butter instead of shortening.  Rolling the dough between sheets of waxed paper cut down on the mess and made for easy transfer to the baking dish. I skipped the 30 minute chill in balls and instead chilled the top layer of dough in the fridge while it was sandwiched in wax paper until I was ready to cover my pot pie. I coated with egg white and prebaked the bottom layer to prevent sogginess. This is definitely a keeper.

I was really nervous to make a pie crust... my last one had been a disaster!! This one sounded really easy, and it was! I used butter b/c that's all I had... it worked really well... even rolling out the crust was really easy! I'll use this recipe again!

This pie crust is wonderful. I have never made a pie crust in my entire life-never had a need to as I usually HATE pie. BUT...I decided to make a chicken pot pie and needed a crust. Whipped this up around lunch time, put in the fridge, and four hours later took it out. When I tried to roll it out cold, it was a disaster, so DON'T do that! I couldn't even roll it out at all, so I warmed it up a bit with my hands, rolled it out and viola! This recipe WAS NOT enough to make a double crust for my pot pie. I am baking the same thing tonight and doubled the recipe, we'll see how it turns out! Like I said, I HATE pie, mainly the crust, but this was so delicious I even had it for breakfast the next morning. My husband even ate it!

I typically make horrible pie crusts - they dont brown, they are chewy and tasteles (rather than flaky)...this one turned out really well.  The crust was flaky and yummy.  I might make a 1 1/2 or even double recipe next time though - it only makes one bottom crust (as it indicated) and was kind of thin.  Will definately use this as my pie crust recipe from now on.

This is now going to be my official pie crust recipe!!  I sprinkled a little sugar on just before placing in the oven and it baked up to sweet, flaky goodness.  As a tip I rolled the crust with plastic wrap on top of it to make rolling easier.  Thanks for sharing.

This was a great basic crust and has come out well each time.  I do tend to use butter instead of the shortening and pop the mix in the freezer for a couple minutes before rolling too to help keep it flaky.

This is a good, simple crust.  I always add 1 tablespoon of vinegar and use milk instead of water.

Maybe I should have used 1/2 butter for this.  I thought the result was very heavy with a shortening taste.  Everyone said they liked it, but I didn't.  You should be able to eat all the pie crust, and I just couldn't.  I only chilled for about 10 minutes and rolled between two sheets of waxed paper.  It was barely enough for a 2-crust pie, so you might want to make 50% more.  I might try again, adding a little more salt and using some butter, for more taste.  Also, I'd let it chill/rest longer than I did.  It didn't fall apart, which tells me there's alot of shortening or water in the recipe.  My Father used to make great pie crust, and he always told me when I was making it (and cursing it), "If it doesn't fall apart, it won't be any good."  :O) That's true!

I am only giving this 4 stars because I had to triple the amount of water it called for in order for it to stay together.  I tried making it with just the 3 tablespoons and it fell apart and was totally unmanageable. After adding the extra water though it turned out great!  Makes a nice deep-dish pie crust.

I've never made a pie before. I chose this recipe, being that it sounded pretty simple. It turned out excellent. And, I substituted butter for the shortening as well. Paired with "Grandma Ople's apple pie" recipe, this one was a hit.

I did 1/2 butter 1/2 shortening and it was wonderful.  My mom makes wonderful pies and she just raved about the crust being so flaky.  I am using this for all my pies from now on.

This was by far the best pie crust I ever tried. Thanks so much..such a big help before Thanksgiving Day arrives. Very flakey. I did try using butter and was not happy with the results as to using the Crisco. Will definatly use this other than my other recipe. Easy to make, easy to roll.

I dislike store bought crust, but thought that a good pie crust was beyond my baking skills. I was so wrong. This was absolutely wonderful. I usually eat the filling and leave the crust when I use store bought, but I found myself just wanting to eat the crust with this recipe. Simple, easy and fabulous.

Just made my very first pie (used this for the crust and "Apple Crumble Pie" for the filling--RECOMMENDED. I added 1 Tablespoon of sugar to dry ingredients and 1 teaspoon of vinegar to the wet ingredients. LOVELY!! People always say making crust is "so hard" and they buy the store-bought (that's fine--but with this recipe--it's easy and DELICIOSO!!! Yum! Thanks, Stephanie!

This is an excellent recipe for pie dough.  I use it to make butter tarts(makes about 12 tart shells).  I did modify it slightly, however, largely based on past reviews. I use the food processor to make this recipe and use a quarter cup of shortening and 2 tbsp of cold butter instead of 1/3 cup of shortening. I also find I have to add an extra 1 to 1.5 tbsp. of ice water for the dough to come together. With these changes, it is flaky and delicious!

Excellent and incredibly flaky, just as promised.  It may help to chill the crust for awhile after rolling it out, as it warms up a bit after having been worked with and then tends to fall apart.

This was my first attempt at homemade pie crust and it turned out very good, although the pie itself didn't set up!  So, I just ate the crust.  I used chilled butter flavored Criso sticks, but did not chill the dough.  I used other reviewers' suggestions about just adding a tad more water and rolling between 2 pieces of wax paper right away, which worked great.  I then chilled my entire pie in the fridge for about 30 minutes prior to baking, which was a tip I had read somewhere else online.  I will use this easy and tasty recipe next time I make pie.   Thanks.

This is the best crust ever!Before i used a crust with a mix of oil and butter for shortening,but it ended up harder when cooked.Also added sugar to that one, but i won't ever add sugar again cause it can also hold back the dough from being flaky.I will instead add 1 tablespoon more sugar to the filling.
Also i always add a tad of cinnamon to the crust because it gives it a special aroma that goes somewhere between cinnamon and vanilla.

Very Good.  I doubled the recipe, because I was making a double crust pie.   This was nice and easy to roll out and not crumbly at all.  I didn't even use all the water and it was still nice and smooth.  I baked my pie for about 35 minutes.  Yum and flaky.  Next time I might consider butter flavored shortening. I baked my pie for 35 minutes at 425 degrees.  Excellent

This was really easy to make. I did however add about 5 tablespoons of water instead of 3.And used butter instead of shortening, also  once rolled and put into pie pan I brushed slightly with milk and sprinkled with sugar. Used this for Dutch apple pie and turned out fabulous! Thanks.. Lekker!!!

I thought this was an excellent crust recipe.  As someone else mentioned, this recipe is most appropriate for an 8 inch pie.  I made an 8 inch and had JUST enough. Because I was using this for pecan pie, I wanted the crust slightly sweeter so I added 1/2 tbsp. vanilla (to the chilled 3 tbsp. of water) and 1 1/2 tbsp. white sugar.  I also used butter flavor crisco, as I prefer this for pie crust.  Chill the crisco first for best results. Thanks for an easy recipe!

EXCELLANT!!! I always eat the pie out of the crust. But this pie crust is very very good. I could actually eat it all. I chilled all of my ingredients before mixing. The key to a great pie crust. I made a lattice top on my blueberry pies. They were beautiful! Everyone who ate some of the five blueberry pies I made said it was the best blueberry pie they had ever eaten! The best crust ever eaten. I used the recipe "Blueberry Pie" Sumitted by Beth. and I followed the advice to add 5 Tbs. of cornstarch. Thank you Stephanie and Beth for your winning combination! Just an added tip from me, I used my deep dish stoneware pie plate from Pampered Chef. It is also a tool to making the best crust ever. Cooks it evenly and beautifully!

I used margarine instead of the shortening, and my Crust turned out perfect! Just be warned, do not over knead it or let it become too soft because it will harden too much while baking. It was super easy and very good. I used it for the Chocolate Pecan Pie III from this site.

It was fine when I was making the pie crust, and it even rolled out nicely, but when I went to eat my apple pie that I had made, the crust was not flaky at all. In fact, it was almost impossible to cut off a piece with my fork. The crust was fine, I guess. But I don't think I will be using this recipe again.

I used this crust for a chicken pot pie, and it was *perfect*.  I didn't have any shortening so used refridgerated butter instead.  Also, I was pressed for time so didn't chill the dough for 30 minutes as suggested, which made it frail when rolled out.  To counteract this, I added more flour to the mix while rolling the dough and it turned out great.  This will be a hard recipe to beat.

I think I have to give this only 4 stars, because I wanted to make a peach pie, and I doubled the recipe for a 2 crust pie, and it just didn't turn out, it was very crumbly and I couldn't pick up the crust without it breaking apart.   The reason for the higher rating though is I remade the crust just using the exact ingredient amount it calls for, for the one pie crust and it rolled out much better.    Does anyone know what I did wrong, why was it so crumbly?   Also how did you make the recipe for a 2 crust pie?   I love flaky crusts and will more then likely give this recipe another try.

Other than adding 1/2 tsp of vanilla and using cold butter instead of shortening, I followed this recipe to the letter and it turned out great!! Besides the graham cracker or pretzel pie crusts, this was first attempt at making a homemade crust and it turned out great! Very easy to make and I'd do this again! I might try the shortening but it really was a great crust as I made it!! The taste reminds me of a sugar cookie! Thanks Stephanie!

It's flaky and does the job, but doesn't have very much flavor. I used it with the rhubarb and strawberry pie and it turned out well, but it doesn't do much for pies such as apple.

This was my first attempt at making homemade pie crust.  I used it to make chicken pot pie.  It was really flaky and delicious!!

Girl!!!  This recipe is the best!  This is my first attempt at cooking.  I live overseas and a lot of western products are not available, but because this recipe was so simple I was able to use many times.  I made a sweet potato pie, broccoli & cheese quiche, homemade apple pie (grandma ople's) with this recipe.  I also used 5 tbls of water instead of 4.  Although I read a review that said not to work the dough too much otherwise it won't come out flaky, but being a new cook I worked that dough until my hands got greasy from the butter and it still came out perfect!!!  The second time I made the quiche I used ice cold water that I put in the freezer as well as ice cold butter which I also put in the freezer.  Before I used refridgerator cold water & butter and I didn't work it like before, I found it to be very crumbly, hard to manage and roll out and my husband agreed that it didn't have the same buttery flavor nor flakyness as before.  I am going back to my original way because it worked better for me!  Thank you!  Be Blessed.

Basic and flaky is right!  I can finally make pie crust!!! I will now use this recipe for ALL my pies.  I did tinker a bit with the recipe because I needed more of it ( and didn't want to put in another 1/2 c. of butter).  I doubled the recipe in everything, but the butter, and just added 2 tablespoons of veg. oil instead.  With that I had enough to make a top and bottom layer and it was so YUMMY!  Thanks for this stephanie!

This pie crust is so flaky, better than store bought.  After having this, no more store bought from now on.  I also used butter instead of shortening.

Easy, tasty and perfect.  I used this twice and the second time I dropped three dabs of water in the centre of the chilled dough before rolling.  Folded it over a couple times them rolled it out -made it much easier to handle.  Try it with Grandma Ople's Apple Pie!  Oh my goodness it is good.

This was as easy as it sounds. I am a novice in baking pies and I needed to have a simple recipe I used this one and I was suprised on how flaky it turned out my husband said that he hasn't had a crust so good since his late wife's pie crust.

This is the best crust I've ever tasted.  I just learned how to bake (even at 43) however, I managed to pull off two great apple pies and a peach pie.  My husband loves pies with deep flacky crust and would pay almost any amount for them now he request me to make them thanks to this reciepe.  There is one thing I need to know ... How do you roll out the dough without it crumbling all over the place.  This has been really hard, but I think I just don't know what to do!!!!!

This recipe was Great! Even though the ingredients looks the same as other recipes I've used.  I took the advice of chilling the shortening and then chilling the dough it turn out Great.  My children even ate it.  They usually eat the fillings in pies and leave the crust but this time they didn't.

Flaky City!  My first try at making my own crust and I was happy with results. Very simple and quick--I tossed it in freezer for about 10 min. then rolled it out.  It went well with my banana cream pie!  Yum! *****

I didn't have shortening so, I used butter. I followed the recipe and a bit of everyone else's suggestions like not mixing it to much and wrapping  the dough in plastic when putting into the fridge. This was the first time I have made a pie crust. It was simple and easy. My crust turned out to be perfect and flaky. Will make again but, now I want the crust sweeter! Have fun!

This is so incredibly easy. I did the entire thing in my food processor. No mixing by hand. I used the dough to make a pot pie. I wasn't home when my family ate it, but my stepson sent me a text message that said "Really good flaky crust".

I finally found my "go-to" pie crust!  It was exactly what I like in a crust, tender and not dry.  Plus it was easy to roll out, which I often have trouble with.

Easy, flaky and delicious! I took the suggestion from another review and put the flour, salt and butter (not shortening) in my food processor to quickly mix it, then I dumped it in a bowl and added the ice water. I rolled the dough between two sheets of parchment paper, what a breeze! This was the best pie crust I ever made!  The pie was devoured within minutes! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Will use as a basic pie crust recipe. 
Changes: Use vinegar instead of water. Chill everything (except flour, but it could be chilled as well), including bowl. Instead of shortening I used margarine for a savory crust. Use butter or shortening for a sweet dish.

This is my go to pie crust!
I have tried others, but I think this one is the best.
A little tip if u still cant get it flakey. Try chilling all your ingredients the day before you want to make your pie. :)

Awesome - this was my very first pie crust EVER (not even a store bought one in my past) and it was easy as can be!  I used the recipe for a crust for homemade pot pies and it's really to die for! It's so flaky I can't believe that *I* made it myself!!!    Thanks so much for sharing!

Wonderfull recipe. I use Blue Bonnet put the stick in the freezer,and use I cold milk (place milk in freezer)and then follow direction of 1 member to make the pie size of the shorten and flour in the food processor. After the food processor in a stainless steel cold bowl, put the pea size mixture in bowl, and add ice cold milk slowly until mixture was mix. Place dough in side a olive oil greased ziplock bag. Place bag in freezer for 40 minutes.I could see the frozen margarine bits. Roll out dough. Pie crust came out very flakey.

I did like the flakiness of this pie crust and a true pie crust taste. This recipe def. only makes a small amount. I used it for mini quiches but I would say from the size of the ball formed it would be just good for an 8" pie. I will try to double the next time and see how it comes out.

I can't believe I finally made a great crust!! Yes!!! Thank you so much for this recipe, not sure what made the difference for me as I've tried a bunch of others. I followed the recipe exactly, although I did double it to make a blueberry pie with lattice top. This is such a fabulous and easy recipe, I think I might make it again in the morning for a quiche.

So I have NEVER EVER baked a pie crust from scratch.  I have always bought it already in the pan and added my own fillings.  (yes I know it was cheating! lol).  I tried this recipe and it was pretty great.  Flaky, manageable.  I only came across two problems.  It needs more salt.  And after looking I will be doubling the Salt.  and needed a little bit more flavor.  So I will be using Butter or Butter flavored shortening next time.

Great recipe! Just made this for my very first pie ever and it was perfect. Two things I would note, 1. Chill all ingredients for 1 hour prior to use 2. Make a double batch if you plan to have a full cover.

This was great. I used butter and also used my food processor to mix the flour/salt and butter. Then I added 1 tbsp of water until it became a dough ball, then transferred to a bowl and added the other 2 tbsp. I used it for chicken pot pie. Would definitely make again.

I saved this recipe because I accidentally leave it taped on the back of a cupboard door when ever I move appartments. SOOO I saved it for the measurements EVEN THOUGH I KNOW THE KEY TO A PERFECT PIE CRUST IS subbing out one of those tablespoons of water with vinegar. Just try it once... I dare you.

TERRIBLE! I'd give it less stars but I can't. Have no idea of the taste of this because you can't get past rolling it out. I was in search of a flakier crust. I guess I will go back to my Joy of Baking - Pie Crust recipe. Tried the tricks mentioned by others and no luck! Never mind rolling out a top crust for the pie. I just wasted time and money with this recipe. This is the first time Allrecipes.com has let me down.

This was wonderful! I used salted butter instead of the shortening and salt. I just pressed it in the pan for the bottom. Everyone loved it....even my daughter who usually won't touch pie crust.

Used this crust for Grandma's Lemon Meringue Pie. Added 1 tbs sugar to give the crust some flavor. Ended up adding around 4 tbs ice water to get the dough into a ball. Make sure you add enough water so it won't crumble when rolling out. After wrapping with plastic, gently squeeze everything together.

I rolled the dough between a sheet of wax paper and a piece of plastic wrap and didn't have problems at all.

Perfectly flaky.

I've tried every recipe out there for pie crust, even using butter and lard, the vinegar recipes, EVERYTHING, but I never could get a flaky crust.  So I tried this recipe as it was very simple and sounded good.  It is absolutely FANTASTIC!  I put my shortening (margerine) and my rolling pin in the freezer for about an hour before making the crust.  And I tried not to handle the dough too much once I got it together in a ball.  This will be my pie crust recipe from now on, whether it's fruit pies, custards, chicken pot pie, whatever.  This is IT!!!!

This recipe is very simple and makes one of the best crusts I've had. (It's supplanted my recipe that uses vinegar; this dough is easier to work than dough that contains vinegar, and has a better flavor, in my opinion.) For an even flakier crust, I put my crust in the freezer for 20 minutes or so after it's in the pie plate. I also use ice cold water for a very flaky crust. The recipe has just the right amount of water (if you use more, you might end up with a shrinking crust). The dough will form a crumbly ball, but if you use plastic wrap, form it into a ball, and put it in the fridge, you'll be able to work it into a crust easily.

I have never had any luck making pie crust....until this one!  I used not only the recipe, but most of the hints in the other reviews.  I did use butter instead of shortening, because i have had gastric by pass surgery and I find butter works better for me.  I used this for a peach pie, I DID prebake the crust for a few minutes, but it shrank a touch.  I think that was because I only use bread flour...I patched it up and then filled it.  It looks wonderful, I credit the hint for rolling the crust between two sheets of cling wrap for that.  Very happy with this one.

This is the same recipe I've been using my whole life.  It's even pre-printed in the front cover of my cookbook.  

When rolling out, I use plastic wrap, rather than waxed paper, as I find it easier to work with and not prone to tearing.  I also fold and store the plastic in my freezer between times; I find it even easier to use when the 2nd or 3rd time around!  

For my large double-crust pies, I put two approx. 15" lengths of plastic wrap on the counter, overlapping them an inch, to give a bigger work area.  I then put the crust, then two more lengths, turning so the "seam" is perpendicular to the one on the bottom.  It's much easier to turn over and around when rolling out.

I have used the same recipe for baking pies for over 35 years. I never have complaints. It is easily adaptable for all types of fillings, and the recipe can be doubled without problems. I prefer pastry cloths for rolling. I occasionally use butter in place of butter-flavored Crisco, with the same good results. Chilled ingredients do help.This is a good, dependable recipe for beginners and beyond.

I needed to make a dessert for tomorrow and decided to make a blueberry pie.  I usually use Pillsbury pie crust dough but didn't have any.  I used another recipe from this site and it was HORRIBLE.  I couldn't get it to stick together at all.  I was about to give up when I read a review to try this recipe.  I decided to try this before I gave up.  I'm so happy I did.  This was so easy and worked perfectly on the first try.  I will never try another recipe.

Would have given 5 stars but I did have some difficulty with the stickiness of the dough.  Will try again with the 2 wax paper sheets.  Though it did taste great!  I could understand why some added a little sugar to the dough if you want a sweeter taste.  Perfect for any kind of pie.

I used half butter flavored shortening and half butter. It was difficult to roll out but tasty. I think I'll stick to my regular recipe though as it is just as tasty but easier to handle.

I make double batches of this and keep one rolled out in the fridge ready to go.  It is perfect every time.  Well, I did make one change after my initial  test of this recipe.  I added just a pinch more salt but that's just a personal preference.  I love the salty.sweet juxtaposition.

This is the easiest pie crust I have ever made. It turned out really light and flaky! I used the crust for the Fudge Pie recipe on this site. I baked it on 425 for 15 minutes before I poured in the fudge filling. The only change I would make is to add sugar for a sweet pie. This would be perfect for more savory ones, like chicken pot pie. Thanks so much! It was super easy, and I will definitely make it again!

Ok...this is what I did to make this basic pie crust. I ended up using real butter instead of shortening due to personal prference. I used about 4 T of cold water and I made my dough right away with ease. I also added about 2T of white sugar to the dough foradded sweetness. As I rolled out the dough I did not have any problems with stickiness. I did add too much flour. I then carefully placed it into my pie pan. I did not have to chill it because I was using the dough right away and other reviewers suggested that it was not neccessary. I filled the crust with granny smith apple pie filling from "Apple Crumb Pie" recipe found on this website. I then covered the edges of the pie crust with aluminum foil during the first half of the apple crumb pie baking process so I would not burn or overbake the crust edges. (keeping my fingers crossed)
UPDATE: Ok I tasted my pie tonight. AS for the crust itself it tasted great. However, I must of somehow ended up not having enough flour for the crust edges because the edges came out slightly thin and more on the crackerish side when I bite into it. Maybe I overbaked it too much? thou I covered it with aluminum foil. I will definitely keep trying because this is a great tasting crust!

This was the first pie crust I've ever attempted to make and it was surprisingly easy and came out nice and flaky.  The dough needed more ice water than is called for, otherwise it's very dry and hard to work with.  It also doesn't have much flavor using shortening.  I may try using salted butter next time around.

Good results. I used butter flavored Crisco as that is what I had on hand. Next time I may try butter as some of the reviewers did. All in all an OK crust.

Perfect!!! Added 1 TBS of sugar but otherwise followed recipe to a T. Used to make a chocolate silk pie so I had to prebake it--which I did for 9 minutes at 475.

This recipe is essentially what I did with the pie crust VI recipe anyway, so thats why I'm giving it a better rating, for the better instructions.  The quantities are almost the same in both recipes.  I do use butter as the shortening not proper shortening, a mix of both would be good too.

I wanted to give this recipe a try because I was impressed with all the reviews.  I followed the directions and made sure I measured everything accurately.  The pie dough from this recipe looked good until I started to roll it with the rolling pin.  It quickly crumbled.  After several attempts, I wisely abandoned ship by throwing all the dough I made in the trash and replacing my pie recipe with store bought pie crust.  I'm not sure why this recipe did not work out because I used cold shorting and let the dough refrigerate before rolling.  It probably has to do with making pie dough in a food processor.  I never had this problem when I made pie dough by hand.  One word for this recipe - disaster!

I just wanted to mention that the heat of your hands are what ruins a pie crust so work it minimally or it will be more dense and hard than crusty and flaky- good recipe!

Followed the recipe exactly and my pie turned out wonderful. I did a two crust pie, with the top being lattice and did not have to double the recipe, but I would double it if making full top crust, just to be sure. Nice to work with and the results were nice and flaky. Will always use this in the future.

This recipe is enough for a double crust. You can use a fork instead of a pastry blender as well. Be sure to work fast, and to handle the dough as little as possible. If you are too slow, the dough turns sticky and fragile when you roll it out because the shortening starts to soften. If you overwork the dough, it turns tough and crumbly. Happy baking!

I've only made pie crust one other time and it turned out blah but this was AMAZING. Using the wax paper was much easier that flouring a surface but it was a little hard because it kept sliding around but it was easier to get the crust into the dish. I used it for the peach-a-berry pie (with ice cream) from this site and it was great. My boyfriend enjoyed the crust so much he's talking about just eating the pie crust and ice cream by itself!

I made this crust today (twice) to go with my blueberry pies (I used the "Blueberry Pie" recipe submitted by ASHESP). Let me just say that I have never made a better pie crust than this one! It was sooooooo flaky and delicious! The only thing I did differently was used Land O Lakes salted butter instead of shortening. Everyone at our BBQ today raved about the pie and crust! This recipe, along with the Blueberry Pie recipe, are a winning duo!

This recipe was very easy to make, however IMO the crust was kind of bland.  Maybe next time I will sprinkle it with some sugar.  5 stars on ease 4 stars on taste.

Let me just say, I joined this site JUST to review this amazing, mind blowing crust. I, like most all the other reviewers, I used butter instead of shortening. I am personally not a pie crust fan- I pick around crust and just eat the contents, but this crust- well, I'm going to have a hard time finding a filling that will compliment it enough. This would make IDEAL pot pie crust. I can't wait to use it to make some! So buttery and flakey, not to mention turns out beautiful after baking! So good, I'm keeping this recipe forever!

Finally, a pie crust that I could make and it came out perfect. Like some of the other reviewers, I used butter. I also made one crust in my food processor, and one by hand to compare, and had no problem with either one.

Tasty & flaky pie crust!  I can even roll it out in a gal. size freezer bag.  Just coat it with flour, roll the dough out in the bag all the way to edges.  Then, cut off the top half of the bag all around the edges.  Place the pie pan upside down next to/on top of the pie crust and invert.  The crust slips off of the other half of the freezer bag easily and fills the pie pan all the way to the edges.  This crust did not roll out on the counter well.  It actually rolled out but didn't want to come up easily.  I was also out of wax paper so that is why I thought of the freezer bag idea.  I did not try it yet but it may work out better - to save the freezer bag - to place the pie pan inside the bag upside down over the pie, center it and then invert and slide the pan with the pie crust out of the opening.  This will save a freezer bag and I'll bet it will work great!!!  Also, this crust will brown quickly (I used butter) so be sure to put thin strips of aluminum foil around the outside edges of the pie crust before baking.  The crust will still turn out lightly brown.  This is the flakiest pie crust recipe ever!!!

After reading many recipes and reviews I decided to make this recipe using 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening.  I wrapped the crust and placed in fridge for 30 minutes before rolling.  It rolled out beautiful.  My husband, who never eats the top of the crust finished every bite on every piece of pie he ate.  Works great for lemon pie  and pumpkin pie.  The crust is flaky and flavorful.

I used butter instead of shortening, I also doubled the recipe. It turned out very buttery, tasted good but not healthy for you at all. I would cut back on the butter next time. I used it with my chicken pot pie.Tasty!

Piece of cake!  Or should I say pie!  :)  Followed recipe exactly with the exception of pulsing the flour, salt and shortening in the food processor (which by the way made it SUPER easy and quick!) and did not have time to chill dough.  Crust had a nice, flaky texture and flavor!  Definitely a keeper!

I follow the directions, as is, and pie crust came out great.  Because I did not feel like rolling the dough, I pressed it on right into the pie pan.  It came out just fine.

it does yield a very flaky crust, but because it is so flaky, it doesn't hold its shape well once cut -- which doesn't really matter since you are going to eat it anyway i guess.  i used unsalted butter in place of the shortening, next time i will use salted butter instead.

This is a five star recipe merely due to its simplicity, easy to follow instructions, and excellent reviews. Now, I had to be the difficult person who wanted to make a healthier version. I used half all-purpose and half white whole wheat flour. I substituted Crisco for an organic, non-hydrogenated vegetable shortening. This mixture did not work and I don't believe i added enough water to the mixture. In the future, I will have to use either all organize all-purpose flour or a ratio of organic all-purpose flour and whole wheat pastry flour (not white whole wheat flour). Additionally, I will use 1/4 c shortening and 1/4 c butter. I use this crust for pot pie and it seemed to have a very bland taste. I will play with this recipe to yield a healthier version. Without considering my alterations, its a simple, great recipe to use for pie crust.

I made this for a tuna/green-bean and a butternut/feta pie, and it turned out brilliantly. Next time I'll use the tip to roll it out between two sheets of baking paper

Love this crust.  As others did, I used butter instead of shortening and did add one teaspoon of sugar.  Was delicious and very flaky.

This pie crust was very easy and very good.  I didn't realize what a difference it makes to chill you shortening (I used butter flavored crisco).  Be sure to chill your dough before rolling it out.  Chill longer than 30 min. if at all possible.  Also, if you need to pre-bake your crust before adding the filing, make sure that you chill the crust again after you roll it out, otherwise there is a good chance your crust will shrink when you bake it.  I will make this again.

This is really good basic crust for my savory pies and quiches.  I sometimes use 1/2 cup cake or pastry flour for an extra flaky crust.

Very flaky and perfect for the blueberry pie I made. Next time I too might sub some of the shortening with butter just for more flavor. I brushed egg over the lattice top of my pie and sprinkled with sugar which was helpful.

This is the first time I've used this recipe, and it's my new favorite! I didn't chill my shortening or the dough, and it turned out great. I also 1.5'ed it for a thick 10 inch bottom crust.

The crust is very flaky and delicious. I like that I can use it for every thing from quiche to pecan pie. It is easy to roll out. I don't always chill it for the full 30 min. I just make the crust first and chill it for as long as I'm preparing whatever goes in it and it still works the same.

This is great!  My crust was nice and flaky.  I usually "cheat" and just do the store-bought Pilsbury kind which is fine but this is way better.  I made it with a peach pie and brought it to the office. It was a big hit!  I doubled the recipe and it made two pies nicely.

This really is a light, flaky, rather delicate crust...almost to the point of too much so.  With only shortening for fat, the flavor is a little bland.  I ended up using 4T of water to get the dough to come together and it really could have used another.  As a good, basic, crust to stand in the background it works very well.

This was great.  I used butter instead of shortening.  It was definitely flaky.  I used mine for a quiche and it worked great, and next time I make a pie this is the crust I'll use.

I thought I had the recipe for the perfect pie crust until I tried this one.  I have used this for a single crust pie and it worked out exceptionally well.  It was very very flaky.  I used the food processor to combine the dry ingredients with the shortening.  Then put mixture in a bowl and added the water.  I skipped chilling the dough and it still worked out fine and was easy to work with.  I made a single cooked crust (for a lemon pie).  I lined the crust with foil and used beans to weight it down.  The end result was a perfect crust.  Made the lemon pie that I was craving and topped it with a meringue recipe from this site.  The end result was amazing.

This is the same as my Grandma's recipe for pie crust! She is well-known for her wonderful pies, and the secret is in the crust! Do not hesitate to try this recipe; it always turns out flaky and delicious! Thanks for sharing!

I used this recipe to make a crust for my chicken pot pie. It was easy and I had everything listed on hand. My husband said that this was a "great tasting homemade" pie. I only gave this recipe four stars because at this time I'm on the Daniel fast and I can't have any bread. But I will be making this crust again. Thanks for the recipe.

Very flaky!  It almost fell apart during assembly, but I saved it and it turned out well.  Next time, I will try the trick of putting some wax paper underneath it as I'm rolling it out and flipping it onto the pie plate.

This turned out great the first time I made it. The next time I tried to subsititute with unbleached all purpose flour and it messed it all up. Don't subsititute!

This was kinda crumbly and tasteless. My boyfriend and mom liked this crust, but I wasn't a huge fan. When it was on the pie it kept falling of when I sliced each piece.

PERFECT pie crust! Over thanksgiving I made a strawberry rhubarb pie with this, 2 pumpkin pies with the Best Ever Pie Crust from this site and the Pecan V with the Better Homes and Gardens pie crust.

All were easy to work with but this one had such delicious FLAVOR!! Make sure to add in water 1 T. at a time  - i didn't use all the water it suggested. This will be my go to pie crust from now on!

This is a great recipe.  I had never made a pie crust prior to using this recipe, and it was super easy.  I don't think i will ever go back to ready-made crusts or mixes.  I have made this with shortening and with lard (soy allergy), and both came out well.  Thank you!

I've been making this recipe for about a year now and it is great!  I'm no expert when it comes to pie crust and this version is simple and forgiving.  My brother typically likes mostly crust on any pie and he told me this one is his favorite - no leftover crust pieces.

I did not have a pastry blender and ended up using my hands after doing some research online.  Everything was cold, including my hands, and it turned out spectacular.  I rolled it between parchment to prevent sticking.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This crust is excellent.  Roll it out between wax sheets and it works every time.  I also add a 1 1/2 tsp. sugar for a little added flavor when making sweet pies.

My family loved this crust!! I have been trying for the last 5 years to make a good crust. I put the dry ingredients and shortening in my food processor and whizzed it up and then I added my water. I only chilled the dough while I was making my filling. I didn't have enough shortening so it was half butter and it still turned out great!

This is good.  I used it with a strawberry-rhubarb pie, so I added a few T of powdered sugar to sweeten it a bit.  Perfect.  Very easy to work with.

You can also roll the dough between clear plastic wraps! works just as fine. Also, in order to ensure that the pie crust does not raise from the middle and the sides don't fold in here is a tip: After lining the pie tin with the dough, press in butter paper cut into a round shape and fill the tin with rice or baking beans. Bake in the oven, and then remove the rice/beans and save them for future use! the pie will be perfectly flat at the bottom and the sides will not fold in!

Easy to follow and easy to make.  My wife didn't like it.  I thought it needed more salt.  I will try butter flavored shortening next time.  I used it for a quiche and am planning a chicken pot pie next.

I may have done something wrong, but the crust crumbled on touch. It was too flaky...maybe if I'd used more water or kept in the freezer longer? Not sure, but it crumbled way too easy.

Awesome pie dough recipe! I've used it before with all butter with great success. I've avoided making pies in the past because of the effort and mess but with a stand mixer, it's so easy and quick! I assemble all of my ingredients in the work bowl (except for the water) and then freeze the lot along with the paddle for 15 minutes. Mix on "stir" speed for about 2 minutes until your butter is distributed into the flour as described in the recipe. I've also found that forming the dough using plastic wrap makes things MUCH easier and simpler.

I wish that there were more stars because making a pie crust that wasn't to tough or just plain nasty was a real chore for me. And this recipe changed all that for me. I also used a butter flavored shortening and it made the crust even better. Thank you sooooo much

Great for a basic crust.  I added a little sugar and some cinnamon, next time will add more.  I used butter because we don't allow shortening in our home.  Good recipe.  Thanks!

I must have done something wrong. I've never made a pie crust before and this one turned out horrible. It's soo simple..I don't get how I screwed it up. I scratched that recipe and tried Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust and that turned out wonderful.

Super easy to make and it turned out beautifully.  I did replace the shortening with butter just out of personal preference.  I can't stand the greasy feeling that shortening leaves in your mouth.  Also, I used my food processer so do all of the mixing.  It took me 4 minutes from start to finish.  (Minus the fridge time.) Definitely recomend this one!

This was one of the easiest crusts and delicious that I have ever made.  Found it was easier to work with if it was chilled and to roll between cling wrap instead of wax paper for ease and cleanup!

Now that I found this I am making pies daily!! It is sooooo easy to whip up in your food processor - and I don't always chill this before using it. The only change I make is using butter instead of shortening, only because my family like the flavor better. You CANNOT go wrong with this pie crust!!!

this is a really good recipe.  With a little practice (pie crust making seems to an art)my crusts are starting to come out so much better than store bought. In the beginning ( I think I've made at least 6 or 7 pies in the last week) I wasn't cutting the fat in small enough pieces and was also a little afraid of over handling the dough. you really can handle it so much more than what I thought.  You'll know when it's getting to warm and mushy.

I made this pie crust with cinamon rolls, they are the best ive ever had! I just spread butter all over the rolled out dough, and then mixed cinamon and sugar together and spread that over the dough also and they turned out amazing!

This is a very good basic flaky pie crust recipe. I see no reason to use anything else. In fact, I bought some ready made crusts from the store and after I got them out of the package, I decided to throw them out unused and make my own instead. It's so easy, I don't know why I even wasted my money on the store bought. There is no comparison on taste or quality either.

I made this for a dinner party to go with the Old Fashioned Strawberry Pie recipe from this site. It was excellant and it got rave reviews! People weren't sure if they loved the filling or the crust more. I doubled the recipe for a two crust pie.   It was very easy to make and work with. I added a little more than 6tbsp of water for the doubled recipe, but you should play it by ear. I also chilled everything in the freezer for about an hour--the bowls, the water, the pastry cutter and the shortening. Asbsolutely delicious---flaky and soo tasty.

Simply excellent! Dough is a bit crumbly so extra patience in rolling is needed, but well worth it.

Wonderful!  I substitute room temp butter for the cold shortening.  For flavor, I add about a tablespoon of sugar and a dash of cinnamon.  Everyone just loves it.  It's exactly how my grandma used to make it.

Fabulous!  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it does need a little flour when you are rolling it out between the parchment paper (which worked beautifully once I added the extra little bit of flour).  I used this recipe to top a chicken pot pie and brushed a beaten egg with a little cream on top and it came out with a beautiful golden, flaky, melt-in-your-mouth texture.  I will use again and again.  You could probably add a tablespoon or so of sugar and make this a dessert crust too.  Thank you so much for this great recipe Stephanie!!!!

The pie crust tasted good and was nice and flakey.  I only have one complaint and that is it wasn't big enough for a 9 inch pie plate, it would have been better for an 8 inch- that and only makes one crust.

I cant get enough of this crust! It melts in your mouth. I did add about a tbl of sugar. The only thing that was unclear is that this recipe only makes enough for 1 crust so I had to do it twice to get a top crust. I cant wait to make another pie!!!

The taste of this crust was fine but it just didn't make enough for a 9 inch pie.I did everything by the recipe but once I had to roll it out it just didn't roll out enough.In order to get it to fit my pie pan I had roll it quite thin(which I did not want)It worked out ok in the end but I don't think I would use this recipe again.

I had high hopes for this crust.  I don't know what happened.  I Made the crust on a humid day, but i did compensate with extra flour.I quadrupled the recipe so i could make2 double pies and i froze one.  Ididn't have a hard time rolling it out. It didn't stick too much.  I was horrified when i opened the oven to check on the pie though.  It was leaking!  There was buring "pie crust" on the bottome of my oven.  Shortening was oozing out and dripping over the sides of the pie plate.  It was a total disaster.  Needless to say it was unedible.  there was simply too much shortening in the crust for it to cook correctly.  Luckily i froze one so i can remake a crust for the other pie.  Chances are, this was human error,but as this recipe is similar to my grandma's recipe (except for shortening amounts) i'll just stick with hers.

what is this, a pie crust for ants?  had to double the recipe for my pie pan.  use lard instead of shortening for even more flake.  add butter for better flavor.  good though.

Everything I hoped for in a pie crust.  If you don't have a pastry blender, hold 2 knives together in one hand, put shortening in the bowl with the flour, and cut the shortening with the two knives repeatedly until it looks like small peas.  Be sure to mix the flour while you do it to cover the shortening fully.

This recipe was a good substitute since I could not find my old recipe.  You don’t need to be a “culinary professional” to make this easy crust.  Follow the recipe, roll the dough between wax paper.  You may want to sprinkle the paper with a little flour if needed.

Very easy to work with and very flaky, it was my first time making pies this Christmas and I used it for all three (all were apples, one as a gift, one for a party and one for the family dinner).   If you don't have a pastry blender you can just take two knives and cut the fat in a criss-cross sort of motion.

This pie crust worked perfectly with the apple pie I made. However, like others I didn't chill it. Instead, I put the dough between two pieces of wax paper and rolled it to the right size and just flipped it into the pie plate. Great recipe!

I had difficulty rolling out this crust, it kept sticking to the rolling pin.  And everyone including me thought the taste was very bland.

I have always been afraid of recipes that require you to cut in the shortening, so I always went with an oil based pie crust.  They came out tough so I decided to try this one.  NEVER AGAIN WILL I USE ANY OTHER PIE CRUST.  THIS ONE WAS SO GOOD, LIGHT AND FLAKY AND SO EASY TO MAKE.  I used the electric mixer to cut in the shortening. A keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

Good pie crust!  Made it with butter, rather than Crisco, on Grandma Ople's Apple Pie from this website.  Thank you, Stephanie.

The last time I attempted to make a pie crust was when I was 14 years old.  That effort was a disaster that ended up in the garbage and I haven't tried again since.  I've been buying refrigerated or frozen pie shells all these years.  Well, I decided I had learned a thing or two in the last 20 years and wanted to try again (besides, I wanted pumpkin pie & didn't have any pie shells on hand!).  This recipe had the most positive reviews, so it won by default.  I am so glad I tried this!!  It was really easy and turned out tender & flaky.  No more store bought crusts for me....yay!!!!

I needed a sturdy pie crust for my vegetable quiche. This was PERFECT! I used butter-flavored shortening for added flavor. Chilling the dough really helped too. Thanks so much

This was a very EASY recipe to follow and went very well with Grandma Ople's Apple Pie recipe (also on this website).  It came out flaky and a beautiful golden color.  I also used the leftover scraps to decorate the top (ie. rose, leaves). Tip:  make sure you crimp the edges closed so your pie filling won't ooze out.

I make this in my food processor and it is very easy.  The second time I made it, I added more water, otherwise, when rolled, the edges crack and it is hard to transfer.  No worries though -- it can also be patted into the pan.

You can't go wrong with this one.  Even my mother-in-law who's been making great pies for a number of years was complementing me on my pie crust.  I also noticed that others were picking mine over hers.  I still can't hide my smile!!  Thank you Stephanie!

The crust was simple to make, but I did find the faults that others found.  (An optimist by nature, I had assumed these were isolated cases.)  First, I had a lot of trouble with crumbly crust when the time came to roll it out.  I added additional water and it did alright.  The finished product, though flakey, was also crumbly and didn't stay together well.  It also had a little bit of a greasy aftertaste, particularly when I compare it to other pie crusts I've used.

In a pinch, I'd use this recipe again, but I'm going to try some others first.

I have to truly THANK you for this pie crust recipe!!  This is the first time that I have ever made such deliciously easy home-made pie crust.  The only thing I can tell you is that I needed just a tad more water.  Other than that it was wonderful.  I will definitely use this recipe again!!

My first attempt at making a pie crust from scratch. I substituted cold unsalted butter cut into small squares for the shortening. That was the only change. I followed the rest exactly and oh, best pie crust ever. I've used this recipe to make a buttermilk pies and numerous chicken pot pies. The delicious possibilities are endless.

If your dough is turning out flaky, as mine was, increase the amount of shortening. Good for sweet pies and meat pies.

I've used this recipe many times and it creates an excellent pie crust. I substitute margarine for shortening or butter. I have refrigerated the dough over night and it rolls out quite well.

I have tried several crust recipes in search of the perfect marriage of ease & taste.  I love all butter crusts, but find them frustrating to work with. All shortening is easier, but lacks a little taste.  I used this recipe and for the fat I did half butter/half lard.  So far, I think this has been the best reviewed pie crust I've made.  It had the added advantage of being the prettiest when baked.  I made a chocolate chess pie and was afraid the bottom would be soggy, but even the first piece came out perfectly.   I may have finally found my crust recipe.

This is a fantastic crust. I've started using unsalted butter but shorting worked well too. I have also subbed a half cup of flour with whole wheat for a chicken pot pie and it was excellent. Made apple berry pie with this and making a pumpkin tomorrow. Love this crust!

I used my food processor to mix all the ingredients.  I also addes a little sugar to sweeten up the dough when I make a dessert pie.  My husband loves this pie crust and even chose it over his mom's...and in the South, that's a big deal! ;)

I have never made my own pie crust. I always buy the pre-made which has always worked well for me.  But today I was to lazy to go to the store.  I found this "basic flaky pie crust".  The only thing I changed was I used butter, my shortening was a tadd old. The crust  was flaky and very good, even turned a nice golden color.  I amazed myself! Thank you who ever shared this.  Fast, easy and good!

WOW! Simple & tasty!!!  I've never made pie before but we recently went apple picking & my family wanted homemade apple pie.  I couldn't believe how simple this crust was! I used butter instead of shortening (I never use shortening 'cuz it looks gross, like something that came out of a clogged artery [and probably would some day]!). DOUBLE FOR 1 PIE IF YOU WANT TOP LAYER! To double add: 2 1/2 cups flour, 1/2 teas salt, 1 cup chilled butter and 1/4 cup AND 2 tbs ice water (based on GingerB's 9/03 rating). This one is a keeper for me!  I'm not much of a sweet eater so I'd love to try it with a homemade pot pie too. :o]

Delicious, flaky, extremely easy to make, I recommend making a double amount for a standard pie, if you don't want it to be too thin.

Who knew making homemade pie crusts was so easy?!! I've always been intimidated to try it and decided to give it a go this past Thanksgiving. It was so easy and quick to make!! What makes it even better is that I already usually have these ingredients on hand! It was a little tricky rolling it out but, just sprinkle enough flour on your surface and you'll get it. I also rolled mine out between two pieces of wax paper as someone else suggested. I will be making my own pie crusts from now on. Thank you!!

I first made this a few years ago. It was my first ever attempt at a pie crust and it was wonderful. I have made this lots of times since and it has not let me down once. I will say that I did make one small chance. Instead of all shortening I do half butter half shortening. I want to say that it comes out to be 4 Tlbs each but don't quote me on that. Perfect pie crust!

I am not a pie maker, but I love pie! This is the best crust I have ever eaten. This was so easy I will be making pies often. I don't think there is any way for this not to be the best crust ever. My husband who hates pie crust even gave it a go and said it was buttery, flaky and absolutely perfect.  Said it would be the only pie crust he will ever eat again.

This is the first and only recipe I'll use for pie crust! Everyone thinks I'm a wonderful pie maker and the secret really is the crust! Double it for a pies requiring a top crust. I've only used Crisco, which for a novice pie maker, required a special trip to the store. I always have butter on hand and I'll have to try that too since many reviewers are swearing it's even better!

This was a great recipe, but as usual I changed a few things. Instead of shortening, I used 1/4 cup lard chilled and 1/4 cup butter cooled but slightly softened, not room temperature. I never use a food processor or mixer as it tends to make the dough tougher in my experiences. The less you handle the dough the better the crust seems to turn out.

Amazing!!!  I've made pie crusts with these ingredients before, but had never thought of cooling the shortening.  That is the key to get a flaky crust.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Very flaky and delicious. I had to add extra water to make the dough come together and roll properly. Also, I followed another users suggestion and placed the flour and shortening in the food processor. This was a delicious dough for my sweet potato pie!

I never thought that making your own pie crust was this easy. Seriously, I thought people slaved to make this stuff. After making this so many different ways with unsalted butter, salted butter, butter flavored shortening, vegetable shortening, and regular shortening, I would say that the regular shortening and the salted butter won out for me. I interchange them depending on what I have on hand. Also, for anyone who had a "crumbly" crust, just add more water. The two to three tablespoons is really a guideline because it shouldn't crumble when rolling, but don't over do it. A little at a time until it's not dry anymore!! Three tablespoons works for me, but sometimes I think I need four. It worked both times. And make sure your water is ICE cold.  Hope this helps you, because this recipe is seriously AWESOME!!

This recipe is perfect as it is written. I actually whiz the flour and salt in the food processor and then add the butter and whiz until it forms crumbs. I actually add the water to the food processor one Tbs. at a time, whizzing after adding each. It comes together perfectly every time. I spray some water on the counter and put a layer of plastic wrap down (the water makes it stick to the counter.) Then I dump the ball of dough out and put another layer of plastic wrap on top and roll it out. I've made it quite a few times so far and it's worked perfectly each time. Using the food processor it takes about 3 minutes if I have my ingredients gathered.

I have to say it is a easy crust to make but i had a hard time rolling it out, i put parment paper under when i rolled it out but it tore apart when putting it into the pan and when baking it spit a little, the crust was not too thin when rolled out but this is my first try with this crust and may use it again but change it alittle, maybe i did not put in enough shortening? not sure, but it was a nice tasting crust and that is all that matters.

Roll between saran wrap or parchment paper, or it's a very sticky roll.  This will completely eliminate the rolling problem.  Take the saran wrapped dough  to the dish, balance on hand, take the top saran wrap off after it's in the dish!!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe.  I could not make a crust for anything and was very disappointed in the quality of the pilsbury crust because they keep cracking.  So when I came across this one I decided to give it a try.  I cannot say how flaky this crust is.  I've used it in prebaked pie shells and in pies that go in the oven.  I have even frozen the extra crust I've make and it STILL comes out flaky!  Such a simple recipe and I have to say that if my grandfather were alive he'd give a rave review.  Love this crust!

I have tried several different recipes for pie crust from this site and this is by far the best one yet. It tastes great and is easy to work with. If I am making a fruit pie, I simply double the recipe. So far I have not had any problems. Thanks once again for a great recipe.

I am a novice in the kitchen and following this recipe  yielded amazing pie.  I doubled the recipe, subbed in butter, used the food processor to blend the butter and flour, made sure my ingredients stayed as cold as possible, used probably 5 tablespoons of iced water (very gently mixed in), and baked it in a glass dish at 375 for around 50 minutes.  The resulting crust was savory and flaky and a great balance to my sweet pie filling.  I got a ton of compliments and a new found sense of baking confidence.

This is the first crust I have ever tried to make.  Mom always led me to believe they were too much trouble.  With things the way they are, I can't buy one, so I gave it a try.  Used it in a chocolate cream pie.  Not only was it fairly simple to make, it came out amazing.  Crisp, flakey, delicious!  Thanks!

What a perfect pie crust! So easy and flaky! I don't have a pastry blender so I used my fingers instead. Just combine the shortening (I used margarine) and the flour/salt mixture slowly with the tip of your fingers or fork, do it gently until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Remember, don't overdo it or your dough will become to greasy. I used metric measurement for better accuracy. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a staple at my house.  I use it for apple pies and also for chicken pot pie.  It comes out flaky every time.  Make sure you chill the shortening and dough as directed for best results.

It took me forever to get this made into a pie because it simply wouldn't stay together. Not good.  I wont be using this again. I have no idea what went wrong but I followed the original directions.

Excellent! Because I'm lazy to roll out the dough, I press it directly into the pan, but be sure to press it in really thin to get a good result. I also blind bake it for a bout 15 minutes at around 375.

Love this recipe. I was always using butter as opposed to shortening and the crust always seemed tougher. I am not one to over mix either so it was somwhhat frustrating. I use this recipe now whenever I make a pie, it comes out perfect each time an people say my crusts are excellent..

I made this exactly according to the recipe and it was amazingly flaky and easy to work with.  The only problem is that it tasted very much of shortening (meh) and I used butter-flavored shortening.  So next time I might try it with actual butter and see how it goes.

Pie crusts are my down fall.  I can not make them, and they NEVER turn out right. This pie crust recipe turned out amazing!  The BEST I have ever made!  Perfectly flakey and EASY to roll out!!  Just follow the directions and work with the dough as little as possible and make sure ing. are chilled first!

This has been my "go to" pie crust recipe for years now and it never fails me.  So so simple, and turns out flaky every time.  I've done it with straight butter instead of shortening, but usually I use butter flavored Crisco. I disagree with the reviews that say you can't use this for fruit pies or as a double crust.  It works!  I've made double crust apple pies as well as cream pies where the crust must be prebaked.  Like I said...never fails!  I'm about to use it for chicken pot pie and I can't wait!

Very easy recipe. I took the advice of others and used butter. My husband said he loved the crust and it rivaled his mother's crust!  Thanks for the recipe and the tips everybody!

Great! I am making a chicken pot pie and this was really simple. I used butter and grated in into the flour because I don't have a food processor. Thanks!

For some reason this did not work for me. followed instructions exactly and it just wouldnt stay together while rolling out. and to top it off i needed two pie crusts and this apparently only makes one.

I used this crust recipe when I found myself in desperate need of pumpkin pie. Make sure your water is ice cold, and if the dough is hard to roll out, but it back in the fridge for an additional 20 min. I couldn't find my pastry blender, My hand held mixer did the trick just fine. REMEMBER to use flour sparingly! more flour=less flaky.

I've made this recipe twice for pot pies. I've never been good on pie crust and i've never really bothered with store bought ones except for the graham cracker crust. So my first attempt i didn't put enough extra water in because i was scared of putting in too much and i don't know if my shortening chilled enough. The dough was crumbly and a pain to work with. My fault i know. It was still flaky though. My seconded attempt came out alot better. I added more water and chilled the shortening for a few hours. I made a double crust and i up the salt to 3/4tsp and i felt the crust would have had more flavor with 1tsp. (for a savory pie of course) Also did a egg wash for the second attempt and appearance wise the crust looked beautiful.

Perfect! I added a little bit more water, and was careful not to over mix the dough. Did an egg wash and baked for 10 min before I added my apple pie mix. This was the PERFECT FLAKY CRUST! LOVED IT!

i made this with moshasmama's "apple pie by grandma ople" and it was perfect!  next time, i'll roll out the top crust and put it back in the fridge for a while before slicing it for the lattice, just to make it easier to handle.  but it is a perfect recipe!  you can see the layers between the flakes!

I have to admit that i use to get very upset when making a pie crust until i find this recipe!!! is great and the crust is really flaky. I just use it for every thing, i make a cherry pie, apple pie, pineapple pie, quiche... and it always turn out great! For a double crust i use three cups of flour and 250grs of shortening, it works for me really good.

This was my first attempt at making pie crust from scratch.  I will NEVER buy those roll out crusts again! This was soooo flaky and amazing!  I doubled the recipe so that I could have two for chicken pot pie, and I used half shortening/half butter for flavor. MmMmMmMmMmmmmm.  :~)

Very good, will use this as my staple.  Important to chill the dough and watch it carefully so it doesn't burn.  I had to cover the top, so and turn the oven down just to be careful.  Keep an eye on it, but it is worth it.

Found this very hard to roll out...but once it was done with great difficulty the crust was awesome... I've been making pie crust for many years so not a novice but this was hard to roll out and put in the pie plate..

This is the pie crust that my mom and I have been using for YEARS!  We don't use any other one.  What I do is only mix 1 cup flour in the mixture and use the other 1/4 (and more, if needed) to sprinkle on my rolling surface and the rolling pin.  These measurements make enough for 1 8-in pie crust (for me) so I 1.5 the recipe usually for a 9 or 10-in crust.  Oh, and I never refrigerate it.

Fabulous. My 1st ever pastry. Doubled quantities and made lattice top.    Followed reviewers tips of rolling pastry between clingfilm; pre-baking bottom for 15 mins and 'waterproofing with eggwhite; & preparing lattice on baking paper and freezing it before dropping on fruit.    Used butter.    Used with Grandma Oples's Apple Pie recipe.

As the name of this recipe suggests, the crust is flaky. It really is odd to have to use only 2-3tbs of ice water. One of my pie crusts was extra crumby around the edges; the other crust worked like a charm. Overall, I was very happy with the flavor of this flaky crust.

Super easy and tastes good too! This was the first crust I have ever made from scratch and it couldn't have been any easier. I used butter instead of shortening becaue it tastes better. I put the flour, salt, and butter in my food processor and ran it until it looked like crumbs (maybe 30-40 seconds). Put it in a bowl, added the water, and done. How easy is that?! I rolled it right away, put it in the pie dish, then put it in the fridge for 30 mins. It was so easy to handle. It never ripped or stuck. I rolled it out on a piece of plastic wrap sprinkled with flour. The taste was wonderful, light and flaky. I used this crust with the Grandma Ople's Apple Pie recipe from this site. Delish!!! :-)

PERFECT! Best recipe I have ever used for pie crust!! I suggest to add as much water as need to make the mixture come together. For me, 3 tablespoons was not enough.

Really easy to make in my food processor.  A little bland though.  I think next time I'll use a little bit of sugar if making for a pie and no sugar when making a quiche

wow what a great Pie crust recipe, I added 2 tablespoons of sugar, for a double crust mix,  or 1 tablespoon for a single crust.    makes a great Pot Pie crust also.    thank you, my mom said I finally learned  how to make a killer pie!

I have made pies for 30 years, tried and tried to have a fool-proof result. I have used my grandmother's recipe, which I saw her make as a child. No more! This recipe is my new pie crust recipe. It was great using the food processor (which I've never used before for pie crust - duh!). It's so much easier pulsing the butter/crisco in (I used half and half) than trying to use a pastry cutter. I also used the doubled recipe amounts that another reviewer suggested. I used the egg wash and sprinkled sugar on top, suggested by other reviewers, which made a nice crunchy sweet dough top. I used this for a rhubarb pie, my mom's favorite. She loved it! The results were fabulous! Thank you Stephanie!!

This recipe worked great the very first time! (my mom even admitted I make better crust than she does!) I used butter instead of shortening, which I think added to the taste a little better. In short, it was wonderful to use for my very first made-from-scratch pie, and I'll be using it to make two more pies for a church bake sale. Thanks for sharing!

This is an awesome crust.  I'm having an issue with the sides falling down when I blind-bake, though I think that's my fault, not the recipe's.

SECRET!!!!  1.keep everthing nice and cold while making it, and toss into a preheated oven straight from the fridge.  2. I dissolved the salt in the hot water before adding ice to make it cold. :) Njoy

Normally I dislike pie crust, but this was delicious. I doubled the recipe, made it with butter instead of shortening, and used half the salt. It tasted rich without being too salty, and was a perfect compliment to the pies we made.

This is the only pie crust recipe you will ever need! It is so simple, you can commit it to memory and prepare it anywhere like a professional! The trick is ALWAYS use chilled fat (butter or shortening), ice water and be fast! Consistently perfect!

VERY yummy.  I used my food processor, so it was far easier than using a pastry cutter.  I used to avoid making pie crusts at all costs until the food processor came into my life.    I used butter instead of shortening because I just really love butter.  But honestly, it was a bit too rich for me (I used it on a vegetable pot pie).  Next time, I may used half butter and half shortening, so I have a tempered richness.  Very easy pie crust to make and work with.  I probably won't use any other recipe again.

Wonderful & easy.  I have to add a bit more water than 3 tablespoons but just a little at a time until I get it right.  I also use the cheapest margarine from the store and it produces a good crust earning lots of compliments.  I used butter once and it was not near as good.

This is a fabulous pie crust. I will use this recipe from now on. The only problem I had was on my pre-baked crust, I did not use any tricks and it slid down the pan. But it tasted awesome. The Pumpkin Pie crust came out fine though. Nice and flaky. By the way i used butter.

I'm giving it four stars because it wasn't as flaky as when lard is used. Overall, good recipe, especially if you have butter-flavored shortening on hand.

I read the comments on this recipe, and followed the directions to a T. Unfortunately, this was the most difficult pie crust I have ever made. It kept falling apart over and over again, and was a mess. With butter, or without, freezing cold or not.  I use All recipes all the time, and this is the first time I have ever rated a recipe below 4 stars.

The taste of this crust was great, and it was extremely workable with one change: use 1/4 c butter and 1/4 c shortening. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly (using shortening only), and the dough was much more sticky and difficult to work with. The second time, I subbed half of the shortening for butter and... voila, a beautiful, easy to work with crust. Thanks!

A little difficult to work with, but very much worth the effort.  Tasted great, and was most definitely flaky and perfect for my made-from-scratch chicken pot pie.  This is my new go-to pie crust!

THIS IS AMAZING! I will keep this forever, as it is now my official "pumpkin pie crust" and I will never change it! It kind of fell apart getting it into the pan, but I pressed the pieces together and it looked like nothing had happened. lol It was my own fault, I was in a hurry, and should have floured my rolling surface/pin more. It came out perfectly flakey, crust NOT burned, and completely cooked (none of it was still doughy, even in the middle) and it tasted great! I used crisco as my shortning, and I loved it. Sometimes the crust tastes too buttery for me, and it's like a sweetness overkill when paired with pumpkin pie. I might try using butter another time, to see if I still feel the same, but this deserves 10 stars AS IS. Thank you!  P.S. The method of rolling the dough between sheets of wax paper is a GREAT way to make this a LOT easier!

This was definitely flaky. The recipe wasn't enough for me to make the top too so I had to double it. I will perhaps roll it out a little thinner next time though because it was a lot more crust than I usually like.

Great crust!  I've made many and this was very easy, flaky and delicious. I substitutted sweet cream butter for shortening and for half of the flour I used whole wheat flour.  I also added a dash of cinnamon and 1 tablespoon of sugar.By doubling the recipe, I had plenty for a lattice top crust and small heart-shaped cutouts.

This recipe is very easy and the crust comes out very flaky!  It is very important that the dough is chilled properly, I have found that if left out too long, the dough becomes difficult to work with and sticks very easily. If this happens, stick it back in the fridge for 15 minutes and it should be okay!

The Best! So Easy! So Delicious! No more store bought crusts for me. I used this for the Fresh Strawberry Pie I recipe from this site. Both compliment each other. I brushed crust with egg white, sprinkled with sugar, and pre-baked for 30mins. Perfect! So flaky! Only crust I have ever accomplished! Stayed together & didn't come apart when cutting-pie slices came out perfect! No scooping out filling & tossing crust onto plate. Will use for all my favorite pie recipes!

I wanted to make individual pot pies to freeze, so I used this recipe for the crust.  It froze nicely and was still flaky when baked.  I made no changes.  I'm looking forward to using it with other recipes.  Thank you Stephanie for sharing such an easy delicious recipe.

Easiest crust that I have ever made. I used butter because I do not like using shortening. I know that shortening tastes the BEST!!!! But I just can not bring myself to buying it.... The butter worked just fine in this recipe. Every other great crust recipe that I have makes like 8 - 10 crusts. This was one crust. Simple. and GOOD!

This was a good basic recipe, very flaky. It was hard to handle though even with floured utensils and layers of wax paper. I used it for a pie recipe that called for the top crust to be latticed, and I could not make lattice out of this dough.

This was a great crust recipe! I did how ever need to add slightly more water to the mix. but it turned out fantastic, and flaky! I also brushed the top of the crust with butter to give it a more light golden look.

Great recipe.  I used a couple of teaspoons of sugar and butter flavored crisco instead of regular shortening and it came out great.

This recipe is now my fruit pie recipe. I used it with Grandma Ople's Apple Pie, and for the Apple Pie Bars recipe (I doubled this one and used it after theirs didn't work out too well). It was perfect, flaky, delicious. I ended up using all of the water, and found it best after just 10 minutes in the fridge rather than a full 30. If this were eBay, "Will do business with again A+++++++!"

I take a lot of pride in making things from scratch, but have always relied on frozen crusts since the ones I had made in the past were tough and flavorless...that was until this one.  I am not sure what is different, but this crust is wonderful!  I didn't change a thing other than taking the recommendation to roll it out on waxed paper since I didn't want to wait to chill it.  No more frozen crust for me; I even went out and bought a pie pan, finally! :)

I made this crust for the "Praline Pumpkin Pie II" recipe from this site. It worked out beautifully. I used half shortening and half butter and also doubled the recipe because I have a deep glass pie plate. I pressed the pecans and sugar down onto the bottom of the crust and prebaked it at 400 for 10 mins and then filled with filling and baked at 325 for an hour. I also covered the sides of my pie with foil for the whole baking process and it came out wonderful. This crust was truly delicious and flaky and got rave reviews from the whole family. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made my very first pie using this recipe.  I added a little (about 1 1/2 tbs.)sugar and a little cinnamon, an extra tablespoon of ice water, and butter rather than shortening.  I baked it at 350 for about 45 minutes and it turned out perfect!  I like my crust very light, but it was still flaky and delicious.  I would definitely recommend using this recipe. It was the most delicious apple pie I've ever had...no joke.

I am no baker by any means, and this was the first pie crust (and pie really) that I have ever attempted. It was so easy and turned out perfect. I had a little fight with it while rolling but that was operator error, not the recipe. I did use butter instead of shortening and keep in mind to double the recipe for a double crust pie. I do wish the recipe called for baking instructions since I'm completely clueless on that. It's a fantastic recipe and it will be my go-to from now on.

Extremely crumbly and hard to work with. I used the suggestions from previous reviewers to avoid crumbling - but no success. Tasted good though, but not worth the effort.

I rated this recipe about a year ago, but I just made it for a Lemon Merangue Pie and I was so pleased with the results that I had to come back and update it! I made the crust and blind baked it (putting parchment paper in with beans to weigh it down, baked it for 15 minutes at 425, removed the weights and lowered the temp to 375 until it was golden brown, applying an egg was during the last 5 min to waterproof it).It was phenomenal, so thanks again for a super easy and delicious fail-proof recipe.

I have never made pie crust in my life. This was quick, easy and simple and had great reviews. I will NEVER buy a pie crust again. This tasted amazing! I've never been a pie crust fan, so I added cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg (I was using this for an apple pie) and it tasted delicious. It was light and fluffy and full of flavour.

This pie crust was wonderfully easy considering it was the first i've ever made, and i'm a teenager!! I did add a bit more water than was called for, but the dough turned out perfect!! This is a keeper!! Use with "Emily's Famous Apple Pie" recipe, and you will have a family favorite!! Enjoy.......

First time making a pie crust and it wasn't as scary as I thought it would be.  This recipe is very easy.  I didn't have enough shortening so I used half shortening and half butter.  I did double the recipe but still found it just wasn't enough to make a double crust to cover my pie plate (I think I have a big one!) so next time I will triple the recipe.  Used the crust to make an apple pie.  Highly recommend this recipe!!

This was a good flaky crust but I dont think it was anything special. Dont get me wrong it was good though! What a pain to work with too, it kept crumbling everytime I tried to lift it up to put it in the pie pan after I rolled it. I'll probably stick to my normal pie crust recipe that tastes just as good & is soooo much easier to work with.

This tastes very good and is very flaky...however, I have a very very tough time rolling this out.  I have tried everything...rolling on floured board, rolled between waxed paper, between plastic wrap...it always tears, cracks and crumbles!!  It takes me sever trys..and I always have a tough time getting it to fit my 9 in pan!!  I'm not sure if its me or the recipe..I'm going to keep trying....I might add a little sugar too, its needs a little sweetness IMO.   Thanks for the recipe!!

I've made this crust a couple of times and it works really well for me. I prefer it with butter-flavored shortening. A good, easy, turn-to pie crust (wish I had someone ot roll it for me). Thanks!

Excellent seemingly foolproof recipe.  I am not known for my flaky pie crusts, but this crust was great. I tend to over-work them but this recipe withstood even that.  Reading previous posts, someone commented that one recipe wouldn't be enough for a 2 crust deep-dish pie, so I made half 1 and a half recipes. I ran out of shortening so topped off the rest of the fat with some butter.  Also, my shortening came out of the pantry, the result was still great. Nowhere near as pretty as the latticed top of the picture, but it was gobbled up so fast nobody would have noticed.  I made this crust to use with Chicken Pot Pie IX from this site.

This pie crust is awesome and super easy. I always would avoid making pies because the crust was such a pain to make but this one is perfect!

Great crust!  I was looking from something like my grandmother used to make and this is it.  Light, flaky, easy to make...  Excellent.

I love this pie crust! I tried few recipes before i found this one and now I use all the time for all kinds of pies. You have to make sure you use chilled shortening and ice water because it does make a lot of difference.The crust is very flaky and delicious!

I also needed baking instructions as I was making a "no bake PB pie".  I used margarine instead of crisco or butter and it seemed to work well.  I also just worked the butter in with my hands.  I started out by putting the ball of dough in the fridge, but then ended up sticking it in the freezer for a few minutes to speed up the chilling process.  I also used wax paper above and below the dough.  Taste:  it was pretty good...seemed flaky and somewhat buttery.  I would add sugar next time (I forgot this time)since it was for a dessert pie.  Would make again.

I had never made a pie in my life and decided to make my first one from scratch. People could not believe it was my first pie, it turned out beautifully! I made it with a sweet potato pie filling recipe found on this site as well. Make sure you let the dough get cold enough though! The second time I prepared this recipe I was impatient and low on time and the dough would not work with me at all! It had to be the temperature, however, because everything else I did the same as before.

This recipe was perfect!  After a disaster with a different pie crust, I tried this one.  It was so easy and turned out just the way I'd hoped.  I did roll out the dough between two pieces of wax paper.  That made it easier to get into the pie dish.

I don't really have anything to compare it to, but it turned out perfectly, so I'm giving it a 5!! I don't have shortening available in the country I live in, so --thanks for the tips to those who gave them--I used butter. I also used wax paper to roll the dough as someone suggested--that made it SO EASY!!! Thanks everyone, I'd been stressing about my pie crusts and because of this recipe, I didn't need to!!

Mixed together quite nicely! I floured my rolling pin and counter alike because it kept sticking a bit (the wax paper kept moving and wouldn't stay still because it stuck alot, so I didnt do that). I could tell it would be really flaky and yummy just how the dough turned out when I was rolling it. Yummy!

The only change I made was using butter instead of shortening (at the suggestion of other reviewers).  I followed the recipe exactly, but found that the dough was way too dry.  I had to add at least another 5 tablespoons of water.  The crust turned out chewy, not flaky.  I don't know what went wrong.

Terrible!  I now remember why I've always made my crust with butter instead of shortening.  Just thought I'd try something different, but this was awful.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and the dough was either so sticky I couldn't get it off my pastry cloth, or so dry it crumbled to bits.  No happy medium at all.  I've been making pies for more than 20 years and have never had a crust turn out so badly.

I have always used Betty Crockers recipe but I think this may be the one I use from now on.  I did however have a bit of a problem when rolling it out. It was very wet and kept tearing on me. I ended up having to just press it in the pie plate. I'm giving it 4 stars for that reason. Otherwise it's a great flakey crust and I will make it again.  I used this crust and made "Grandma Oples Apple Pie" that I found on this site.  MmmmmmmGood

This turned out very good. The crust didnt get to brown, I used butter instead of shortening because they dont sell it where I live. The flavor was very buttery, but the Fiance said he loved that about it. I would have chosen to use shortening, but it did give a very rich crust flavor, probably amazing with banana cream pie. Reccommend to try.

Very easy to mix up but after chilling in the fridge, I could not roll it out.  It kept breaking and ripping at the edges.  I know this is cheating, but I threw it back into a bowl and mixed more water into it.  It was easier to work with then and it didn't effect the taste or the texture.  Reminds me of shortbread.  Pretty good basic crust, easy to adjust to your recipe.

Perfect and so easy! This is the first time I ever made a pie crust, and I will never buy the storebought kind again! I only had time to chill the dough for about 10 minutes, but it was fine to roll. Thanks!

Delicious and very easy to work with. I've had problems with crusts in the past but this one was definitely easier to use. I put in the freezer while I was making the filling and it rolled out perfectly. Excellent recipe! Thanks!

Awesome recipe. I have tried this with regular Crisco, butter flavored Crisco, and just plain unsalted butter. I would use the recipe as is for savory pies and with butter flavored Crisco for sweet pies.

I doubled this recipe to make a bottom and top crust.  Used butter instead of shortening, tastes much better.  I had to use a little more flour when rolling to avoid some sticking (also tried plastic wrap and worked just fine).  Beautiful pie crust recipe, very easy, highly recommended.

This makes a very tender, flaky pie crust. I did not alter the recipe, I DID double. It doubled nicely and I had no issues with it. Thank you!

so easy, and sososo good.  this recipe really does make a basic, flaky pie crust.  have used it multiple times in various pie recipes, always with outstanding results.  one note--i've noticed that i need to add additional ice water to get the desired consistency.

I consider myself to be a bit handicapped when it comes to pie crusts (baked goods and fillings are fine!)...until today!  

Yeehaw!  A pie crust *I* can make that is flaky, buttery and tastes good (as opposed to cardboard taste and texture)...AMAZING.  Woohoo!

I have a question!  Has anyone tried this recipe a day or two ahead of baking the pies and kept the dough in the fridge until ready to bake?  Did it still turn out?  And, why are some saying it is not a good double crust recipe?  Does the top crust get soggy or not hold up?

This was the best pie crust I have ever made! The only thing I did different, was that I didn't actually measure the amount of water I put in. I just put in enough til it formed a ball easily. I refridgerated it for about an hour and it rolled out beatifully! I will make this again and again!!

I didn't have any luck with this.  It was like oily dirt  particles rather than crust,  didn't hold together at all.  I almost ran to the store for a box of crust when trying to work with it, wish I had trusted my instinct, my turkey pot pie was not good using this.  What did I do wrong?

after trying a few different variations, i actually got a great result using 1/4 cup chilled butter and 1/4 cup room temperature lard for the fat in this pie crust and it turned out great.

Very easy to make and very tasty.  The consistency once baked is perfect - flaky, tender yet crisp, and melts in your mouth.  I used this recipe in a quiche, but didn't chill the shortening and just used cold tap water and it turned out fine.  I did chill in the fridge while making everything else (about 15 minutes) and just pressed it into a pan using my fingers and it turned out great.  Will definitely be adding to my staple recipes.

I doubled this recipe for the chicken pot pie I made for dinner tonight. I used butter and ended up using more water than the recipe states. Overall, it was pretty good, I just wonder if it would have been flakier had I used shortening. UPDATE: I made this again tonight. Even though I chilled the dough for at least a half hour and rolled it out between two sheet of wax paper- I had some difficulty getting the crust of of the paper. Perhaps next time I'll stick it in the freezer for a bit before rolling it out.

This was great and easy to make the only thing I did differently was I did half shortening and half butter. Then I placed the pie dough in the freezer while I prepared the apple pie filling. This was my first attempt at making my own apple pie and crust. Thank you very much. My daughter and husband were impressed with the tasty flaky flavored pie crust.

followed the recipe except used butter flavored shortening.  Mixed it all in the KA and turned out fine.  Followed the other reviewers and rolled it out between 2 pieced of wax paper and was very easy to work with.  Crust came out very flaky but a little on the bland side.  Maybe needed more butter flavor or something.  But good easy crust recipe.

I have always been intimidated by making my own crust, but this was so easy. I doubled the recipe and used butter instead of shortening, I used my food processer in spurts to break up the butter then added less water than I thought I needed. Turned out perfect, I made it for the "fresh pear pie" recipe on this site: out of this world!

AWSOMe and EASY!! This was my first ever pie crust and it turned out great. I used it for the crust of a pot pie and it was the perfect combo. I think if I was going to use it for a fruit pie I would add a little sugar, but other then that it was easy to make and turned out very flaky and tasty.

When they say make a head they really mean make ahead because this crust doesnt taste as great until the day after it is made. but it really does taste great and it is good with pumpkin pie.

It is the first pie crust I made and it worked out well. I refrigerated it for several hours and rolled it out between sheets of wax paper. I was shocked that I it was so easy.

I had to add about 2 extra tablespoons of water so I could get the dough out in one ball.  Finished product was pretty good.  I can't say it was anything special, but it worked.

This pie crust was a little difficult for me to work with.  I needed to add a lot more water to get it to come together.  It had a great taste though.  Like others I added a little sugar to the crust for a little more sweetness for my fruit pies.

I really liked this recipe. I have made pie crust before from other baking books, but this was the most easy and it Really does come out very Flaky.  For the shortening I used Crisco's Butter flavor shortenings that come in the sticks. I like these because there's no mess to measure, you just cut the amount of shortening that you need.  I highly recommend this recipe.  My apple pie turned out very Yummy!

This was my first ever attempt at homemade pie crust and it was fabulous!! I did tweak it a bit after reading other reviews...instead of using cold shortening, I just used cold sticks of butter. I also doubled the recipe using the measurements given by another reviewer. This allowed for a pie crust bottom as well as a lattice top. Fantastic and super easy!

Exactly what I wanted ! It was VERY flaky. I have a lot of upper back problems and wasn't looking forward to all the rolling of the dough, but this rolled out so easy ! TY for the post ! The taste, made as said with all the shortening, was very, very good. Someday will try the suggestions of using partly butter also depending on the pie.  his was for an apple one.

I made this for a pot pie and it was flaky and delicious! I didn't have time to refrigerate for 30 minutes. I think it would have been easier to work with if I had, but didn't seem to affect anything else.

This was very flaky!  I love how this turned out. It was so simple too....practically foolproof.  The only change I will make in the future will be to double the salt.  Thanks for the recipe!

So far...so good. This is the first crust I could actually pick up, rotate and roll again. Then, I folded it up and placed it nicely in my pie plate. It was amazing and I felt like the cooks on t.v.  Not sure about the taste/texture...it's still in the oven! It looks beautiful though!

This was my first time making pie crust and it was a little more difficult than I'd hoped it would be.  I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening and added 1 TBSP sugar.  The dough was a bit tricky to work with.  The bottom of the crust was fine but I ended up short for the top (I was planning on making a lattice)  In the end, I crumbled the dough on top of the pie.  The crust tasted good but I'll have to keep practicing with this one.

This was the best pie crust recipe I have ever used.  It was not the easiest to work with but the end result was definitely worth the minimal trouble.  I used butter flavored shortening and used my hands to mix it with the flour/salt.  The mixture was a bit sticky when I added the ice cold water.   I just wrapped in the plastic and chilled it.  When rolling out it was a bit difficult to keep it together but not impossible.  

My husband and son told me they enjoyed eating the crust of the pie just as much as the rest of it – I have to agree! Unless I find another pie crust better than this one, doubtful, I will forever be using this recipe.

Excellent Easy and Cheap! How could you go wrong?!?!? I did follow one review of using butter and I didn't bother to refrigerate and it came out fine. I felt it could use a touch more salt to better compliment sweet pies, but I am not complaining. We like to roll out the extra dough and cover it with cinnamon and sugar bake at 350 for 10 minutes and you have a cute dessert and nothing has been wasted!

Great recipe !!  I made this before I started the filling, only to find out the recipe I was using called for an already baked pie shell (should have read the whole recipe first, a lesson learned on my part)I rolled it out and placed it in a pie plate, and baked it at 350 for 10 min then cooled it in the fridge. Turned out great, best crust I have ever made !!

This is a great pie crust!  The dough is very easy to work with.  I made it for a chicken pot pie and when I make again for a savory pie filling, I will use a pinch of salt.  Otherwise, an outstanding pie crust.

I used this recipe along with the "Fresh Rhubarb Pie" recipe.  The crust was fantastic.  It was really easy to make.  I followed other people's advice and rolled it out on floured wax paper.  It made it a lot easier to transfer to the pie plate.  The crust turned out very light and flaky!

This pie crust is very flaky, but I thought the flavor was a bit bland. It was easy to make & work with, but I am still looking for a better recipe.

This was my first attempt at pie crust from scratch. I used butter instead of shortening and it still worked out pretty well (aside from my overstretching the dough on too large of a pie plate). I'll try this again with shortening and a correctly sized pie plate. Very flaky!

This is awesome! Just make sure you have enough water. I didn't and stuck it in the fridge. I went to roll it out and it was cracking. I added some more and it was fine. MIL loved it!

Wonderfully easy pie crust.  My mother used this recipe and she passed it on to me.  The only variation I have is I use 1 1/3 cups flour and 1/2 tsp salt.

This was a gooey, doughy, plain crust-just like we like! I added more water than it called for.  You just need to add tablespoon by tablespoon in order for it to get the desired consistency.  I believe that temperature, humidity, etc play a role in how it will take, so adapt as needed.

It's flaky, however I still have to say that the "Best ever Pie Crust" from this site still tops it all. Just make sure that you chilled the shortening and milk  first. You want to work fast since you don't want the fat to melt and make your crust harden and less flakier.

Made pies as a favor for a graduation party, I'm not good at baking but they devoured it.  I was the hit of the party.  Only problem now is they want me to make the pies for our family functions.  Thanks for the post from loves to cook but hates to bake.

I had never bothered to make my own pasty before as I thought it was too hard.  Boy, was I wrong.  This recipe was simple to follow and even though I substituted butter for the shortening, it turned out perfectly.  The pie crust was lovely and flaky - just melt in your mouth perfect!  I used it with the Caramel Pecan Pie recipe from this site.

Excellent flavor, very easy to work with.  Best pie crust recipe I have come across.  Remember to add water slowly, I only ended up needing 2 Tablespoons instead of the 3.

Great crust! Very flaky. No need to chill the dough. I rolled it on wax paper with plenty of flour on the paper and the roller. Transferred to the pie plate perfectly. I doubled to make and apple pie. FABULOUS and PERFECT crust.

My first time making homemade pie crust. I was intimidated because my mom told me the first time she made pie crust it ended up getting thrown into the wall. It was good...oh so flaky!!! I love breads and crusts and I get picky...oh this was good! I rolled it out on a piece of foil (or parchment) making it easier to transfer to the pie pan without breaking. I will definitely hold on to this recipe, it was so easy!!!

This pie crust was fantastic. I used it to make a chicken pot pie. The only thing I did differently is I did not refrigerate before I rolled it out, rolls out beautifully.This was a great recipe.

This is the best pie crust recipe. I have always thought making a crust would be hard. So I never tried. After using this recipe, I will never go back to using a frozen crust. The only thing I did different- I did not chill the dough. It rolled out beautifully. This is absolutely AWESOME!

Great recipe!! It was my first time making it and it turned out fabulous for my quiche. I used whole wheat flour and all purpose for a healthier approach. Also, I used butter instead of shortening because that's what I had at hand.

This recipe may seem idiot proof, but this idiot just tried it with strange results.  The crust ended up very, very sharp in places..almost like it crystallized.  Haven't had enough kitchen physics to figure this out, but it wasn't an appealing side effect.

Went exactly as recipe stated.  However, the bottom part of the crust turned out crumbly - the sides of crust was flakey.  Will use this recipe again.

So easy!  I used it on the "Chicken Pot Pie II" recipe found on this site, and it was great!  I wasn't sure whether it was for a 9" or 10" pie though.  My guess is that it was for a 10", because I had too much for the pot pie (which called for 9" crust).  Thanks for the recipe!

I had never made a homemade piecrust before so I was a little nervous, but this crust turned out perfect! I used butter flavored crisco. I think the trick is to not handle the dough too much.

Pretty good, flaky.  I had a hard time working with it, next time I will add just a bit more water to bring the crumbs together before chilling.  I followed the recipe to the tee.  Next time, I will try the butter-flavored shortning and see how it turns out.  Our apple pie was yummy with this recipe.  :o)

Super easy to make.  Withstands the abuse of multipul rollings, which is awesome because I have a tendancy to over roll my crust the first time. oops :)  The crust also holds up to liquidy fillings, but i still brush it with egg wash before filling. i guess I'm just a little bit paranoid.

I never thought that I'd be able to make my own pie crust until I tried this one! It was so easy and so good, I used butter flavor Crisco and I made an apple pie with this recipe, perfect match!

This was my first attempt at a pie crust.  It was so easy, so flaky and so good.  Thanks to all of you that suggested rolling between wax paper.

this was my first time making pie crust from scratch. it turned out really good but it was pretty hard to roll out. it seemed like it was missing something- maybe i'll add a little more salt next time. i brushed the crust with egg white and i think that helped brown it a little. also next time i will make a serving or two more because i just barely had enough. i used this with the quiche lorraine I recipe - yum!

I have been searching for a great pie crust recipe for a while and I have hit JACKPOT!!  This is so easy to make and comes out super flaky.  It will absolutely melt in your mouth!  Next time I am going to try butter flavor Crisco in place of the shortning.  We'll see how that works.

This really is quite simple and good.  When I made this I didn't even have the right ingredients and it still turned out.  It's really quite nice if you brush it with egg whites and dust it with sugar.  I highly recommed this.  C'est trés, trés facile et c'est trés, trés bon!  J'aime ça beaucoup!

Perfect.  Even without the iced water, (I'm too lazy to ice the water)it still comes out great every time, and flaky,.....wow....it's great! I don't chill it, though, I use it as soon as I make it, I think it's freshest that way.  This is my permanent recipe!

This is the best pie crust EVER!!!! My husband loved it. I made it for the Grandma Ogle's apple pie recipe on this site. I ran out of dough for the latice top, but will plan to make extra for Thanksgiving. It was tender and flaky just the way I like it.
10 stars if you ask me!!!
Thanks!

I'll never be intimidated by recipes that seem beyond my capability again!  Though I have the genes of my deceased grandmother, who was the original baking queen, I've been quite afaid to attempt anything related to baking.  Never again.  I made a double batch of the "Basic Flaky Pie Crust" and couldn't be more pleased with the way it turned out.  I used the first half for "Chicken Pot Pie" (available on this site) and the second half for "Tillman's Plaza French Silk Pie" (available at CopyKat Creations).  Man alive, this was good.  And flaky.  Wow, it was flaky like you wouldn't believe.  Though I probably mixed the dough more than I should have (the dough particles aren't supposed to merge too tightly), the crusts STILL turned out great.  This was a fun day!

I used this recipe to go along with an apple crunch pie I made from this site. I have not been pleased with my homeade pie crusts till this recipe. I was shocked that I could make such a wonderful flakey pie crust. Although I only used just a drop or two more than two tablespoons of ice water instead of three as recommended. Will continue to use this to make all of my pies.

I am absolutely the most cooking-challenged person since Lisa off of the Green Acres (hence, my username).  Even I was able to pull off this recipe and my Grandmother loved it! If it passed her expectations,it's a recipe worth keeping.

not flaky, had a hard time getting it to come together, plus didn't bake well at all. Would use a frozen crust before I try this again.

Yum!  I thought making pie crust from scratch was difficult.  This recipe was very simple and amazingly delicious (my husband was very pleased).  All I had was butter flavored shortening and I enjoyed the buttery flavor this substitute produced!

This crust turned out horrible. I am an avid baker and this crust was a disaster! Thank goodness my mother was here and was able to run out to the store to buy a frozen crust! I will never use this again.

This was the easiest and best pie dough I've made.  I used non-hydrogenated shortening (from Spectrum).  It worked just as good as regular shortening and is better for you.

My girlfriend (Rose) and I have used your web site for dozens of recipes since we first found it! I always rate my recipes - she never does !! Anyway, she made this pie crust (the first time she's had success with pie crusts)....she made a peach pie during the summer. Her husband, who critiques all her recipes, said it was the best pie she has ever made in her life......! Now, I'll have to try it too!!

I thought this crust recipe was exactly what it states.  It was light and flaky, which was great with a homemade sweet potato pie.  (It is also important to add about a 1/4 cup flour to work dough.)

this is the recipe that would always be 
my pick, it is so flaky and that is the key to a wonderful pie, you can have the
best apples, mince meat, peaches and etc. but if the crust is not flaky it is
a disaster.......love it

Doubled the recipe to make a top and bottom crust - it came out just perfect! Recommend using wrapping it in parchment to chill it, though.

Very flaky!! Will def make again, perhaps baking the crust a little in the oven before adding pie filling to make the crust  a little more brown.

I made a blueberry pie and used this pie crust.  It was outstanding!!  I added 2 more teaspoons of water than the recipe called for.  I also didn't refrigerate the dough after it was mixed.

I doubled the recipe and used butter rather than shortening.  I also rolled the dough between two sheets of wax paper like someone suggested.

I make homemade apple pies and have used this recipe a few times now.  The crust comes out nice and flaky and it was delicious!!!

I could not believe how easy this pie crust was to make! It was my first  pie crusts! I made this great pot pie and they were so easy. 

I am so excited by this recipe. I plan to make some more pies tomorrow! I’m going to have to add a touch of sugar to it for the fruit pies, but that is the ONLY thing that I am going to change.

I followed the instructions and this turned out perfect!  Makes enough for 1 very flaky crust.  Tip: don’t overwork the dough and make sure to chill before rolling out.

I have used Betty Crocker’s pie crust recipe for years. Never fails to be flakey, perfect. But the recipe makes a crust too small for my large 9-10” pie plates. So had to double the recipe to get a large enough crust for the plate, with dough left over. This recipe is the same as the Betty Crocker recipe, but with a bit more of each ingredient, making a perfect sized crust. Very flakey, not tough, not doughy. I will use this recipe from now on.

I’ve never made pie crust before. This was my first attempt. It went well. The crust was good. I would try adding a little sugar, as another reviewer suggested, because it was pretty neutral in flavor. Very flaky though and good. Btw this made me exactly one pie crust only. I am not sure why but I expected it would make more than one. Perhaps I didn’t roll it out thin enough, or maybe this is the correct result. Either way I’ll double the recipe next time and freeze one.

I used this recipe for a rhubarb strawberry pie and OMG, the buttery flakey crust is to die for! It took my pie to a whole new level. I used butter instead of shortening and that was the key. This will now be my go to crust recipe!

I was making quiche and couldn't find my pie shell in the freezer.  Found this recipe, but couldn't find my pastry cutter and was too lazy/in a hurry to get out the food processor.  I remembered my grandmother using her hand to cut the shortening into the flour to make biscuits and wow was this much quicker and easier.  I added some of the water and it worked up into a ball quickly.  Then I decided to try another shortcut and just press it into pie plate instead of rolling it out.  I easily pinched a little scallop around the top edge and the crust and quiche turned out perfect!

I loved it! I did twice the salt the recipe called for to bring out the flavor the second time I made it and it tasted so much better. ADD TWICE THE SALT!!! It balances out the sweet filling (I made a blueberry pie)

This came out as expected!  I added and extra tbl or two of ice water to make it all come together.  I didn't bother to chill it as I took the advice of another poster and put it in between 2 pieces of wax paper (I'm never going back to the old way again!)  I used this as a pre-bake shell for my strawberry pie.  It turned out perfect - But I think I would probably double this recipe next time as all of my pie plates are rather large.

This is the best pie crust I have ever tasted. I have always hated pie crust. No matter what kind of pie, I couldn't stand the crust. I made a strawberry rhubarb pie because I had the ingredients in the garden so I went for this crust. The filling turned out too watery but the crust was so good, I ate that pie soup like no tomorrow.

Best pie crust recipe I’ve ever made! It makes a single crust, so double it if for a top crust if needed. I make it in my food processor and it takes only 2 to 3 minutes. Chilling it it essential, and I lightly flour the silicone mat and rolling pin before rolling it out. It is a generous amount of dough allowing for a 10” pie and a lovely crimped crust. Before adding filling I bake 15 min. at 350F to ensure a flaky crust across the bottom. Flaky, buttery, and delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly. The only difference is that I used a food processor to do the initial blending of the Crisco and flour, then took it out of the processor and added water gradually, mixing by hand. I wrapped it in plastic wrap and kept in fridge for 30 mins. When I took it out and tried to use a rolling pin, the mixture crumbled. Tried to add tiny amount of water to see if I could get the right texture, but it never came together. So I flattened whatever pieces I could and pressed and blended those piece into the pie pan. But it was a mess. I was making a quiche. The flavor is not great and the texture was not flakey. Will not be making this again.

I had to alter this recipe because it was way too dry... Next time, I would use 3/4 cup of shortening or even a cup of shortening instead of 1/2 of a cup...

Made this recipe for my son who is lactose intolerant. He can’t even tolerate butter, which is what I have always used. This recipe came together easily. I made it the day before, and rolled it out the next day. It really does work better when it has had time in the refrigerator. Now, everybody is happy and eating apple pie!

Came out great. First time ever making pie crust from scratch. Used it for pumpkin pie. I chilled it longer than 30 minutes as I was making other things while waiting for it. Easy to work with. Perfect amount of flakiness and tasted great.

This is my go-to recipe for their perfect pie crust. I always get compliments every time I make a pie... sometimes I’ll use butter instead of shortening & add a tablespoon of sugar to the dry ingredients. It comes out tasting like a butter cookie! The recipe is also great as-is with no changes. If I don’t have parchment paper, I’ll flour my surface & crust as I’m rolling it out, then use a thin, flimsy plastic cutting “board” to lift the crust & set it in my pan.

I've used a crust recipe for almost 50 yrs now that used Crisco.
Even people who didn't like to eat the crust would eat mine.
It was the best flaky crust I've ever had. Unfortunately Crisco decided to change their product in 2007 and my pie crust have never been the same. Decided with all the excellant reviews that I'd  give it a try. Sadly disappointed! Not even a close second. My search continues.

Have used this several times and it always comes out great! I do use unsalted butter in my crust though. I always freeze my butter and then shred it with a grater. Got that tip from a pastry baker and it makes blending the butter in so much easier!  The only draw back is my husband now only wants home made pie crust!

Couldn’t find my copy of old family crust recipe and this one looked close to what I remembered. Was really surprised when everyone said they loved the crust, what did I do differently. The 2nd surprise was that these same people always rave about my family recipe so this one must be awesome.

Giving an initial 5-Star rating for ease of preparation; will be baking a Custard Pie today, so not yet sure how flaky it’s gonna turn out.

I doubled this recipe to make a double crust saskatoon pie. I found the dough very difficult to work with. I may have had more success if I had used a food processor to combine it though. It was very crumbly as I was trying to roll it out so I could not get it quite as thin as I would have liked. Flavour-wise, it was very plain, but it allowed my filling to really shine. Would also have been a good flavour for a savoury crust. I may attempt this recipe again in the future, but use a food processor instead.

This pie crust was definitely not great. It was the second pie I ever made and the first one I used a similar recipe and it worked great, but had little taste. This recipe was overly flaky and extremely sticky.  It wouldn't roll out and it caused me a huge panic attack when I had no more flour to make it non-sticky and there was no way to roll it. Finally after 30 minutes it worked with help from someone else.  I want to give this one star, but my family liked this crust's taste better, so 2 stars it is.

This was so good and flaky for my very first apple pie! I read someone used butter, instead of shortening, so I used butter as well.

This is the best and easiest piecrust I have ever made. I did use half butter and half shortening, and it is so so good. So flaky and also very flavorful. I also added a little bit of sugar that is my personal preference. Highly recommend

Maybe I didn't bake the pre-baked pie crust long enough but it wasn't flaky. Maybe I added too much water. I like the butter flaky pie crust better on this site- it's Really Flaky!!

This was my first attempt at making my own pie crust. This recipe is absolutely delicious; very light and flaky. I made it in my couisinart, first I added the flour, salt and butter (I used this instead of shortening) and pulsed until it was a fine crumb, then I drizzled in the water pulsing as I added it. Be careful not to over mix. Then turned on to the counter and formed into a ball, placed in a ziplock bag, flattened it and let  it sit on the counter as I made the apple pie filling.

Substitute bacon drippings for the vegetable shortening if you want the crust to melt in your mouth (as a pie crust should).  No, your pie won’t taste like bacon.

Its a decent pie crust nothing too special. Had to use butter after over working the first attempt with shortening. Word to the wise, when using a food processor make sure you only use the pulse button to have the best chance at not making the crust sticky and overworked. It should look crumbly and dry but stick and clump when squeezed or pressed with hand. If its holding together already without touching it try again. Im not a crust making expert, this is just a summary of my researching online. I did brush milk on this crust and give a sugar sprinkle all over because I find most pie crust boring. The sugar helped a tiny bit but maybe needed more than a sprinkle. Used for sweet potato pie and was a good combo.

Texture was nice and this was easier to make using the shortening compared to a butter crust --- but the flavor just tasted like shortening. Meh. I'll stick to butter crusts despite the expense and hassle.

Great recipe, but was very difficult to roll out the dough, because it kept falling apart.  But then I am not the best pastry chef ether. I did know though, not to overwork the dough, so i just dealt with it by patching the dough together in the pie pan, it worked out just fine.  My husband said it was the flakiest pie crust he has ever had.

This was my first time making pie crust from scratch and it was much easier than expected. I messed up by trying to roll the dough before putting it in the pan. The best way to form your crust is to simply put the ball of dough in the middle of the pie pan and stretch it out by hand in there.

Sorry. This did not work for me. When I removed the dough from the fridge, I knew I was in trouble! It WOULD NOT roll out. I finally managed to roll one out enough to transfer to a pie pan, then crumbled the rest on top of my filling after mixing with brown sugar, then dotted with (plenty) of butter. Not TOO bad for an Apple crumb pie. It may work for some, but it just didn't for me

This may be the most successful pie crust I've ever made.  I usually buy pre-made pie crust because I'm so bad at making them but I thought I'd give it one more go.  I used butter instead of shortening because I try to avoid the hydrogenated stuff.  I did let it chill while I made  the filling.  I used this for chicken pot pie. I think for the pot pie I will blind bake this next time because the filling is pretty soupy and affected the bottom crust texture.  ALSO, keep in mind this is just one 9" crust.  if you want a top crust, double the recipe!

While the texture is spot on, the flavor was over powered by the shortening.  I'm gonna stick with my butter recipe.  My entire family could tell the difference.

I used butter.  I gradually pulsed the flour, salt and cut up cold butter in my processor. Then gradually added ice water. To not over work, I dumped it on the counter when it looked kind of like cornmeal in the processor.  Pulled it together and it was perfect. Rolled out beautiful.  

*For those that have issues rolling the dough out - whether you use the crisco or butter, it needs to be cold and so does the water.

By no means I'm I a seasoned baker but this pie crust is soooo easy and sooo delicious!! I'm in the process of making it for the 3rd time this week. I've used it for the crust in a strawberry pie and doubled the crust for a chicken pot pie recipe and both turned out fantastic!

For anyone who found the dough too crumbly and hard to roll: Many factors can affect the consistency of pie dough, such as altitude and the humidity level where you live. It's okay to add a little more water, just a little at a time to get the right texture. It's a fine line between too dry and too sticky.

This lives up to it's name in flakiness, which is something I appreciate in a pie crust.  However, it was tasteless.  I have tried this recipe with butter but the result was not as flaky as I would like.  I am hoping to find somewhere in-between, great flavor and texture.

it is a stand-alone pie crust recipe! Use it "as-is" because it is perfect! Flaky and JUST WHAT I WANTED!      

PS...for those of you who didn't watch the video...she does tell us you CAN USE BUTTER in place of "shortening". A few people didn't know what shortening was. FYI- GOOGLE "shortening" = Barb C

Personal changes: Used pastry flour instead of all purpose (much better result). 
When making pie dough, I prefer to dissolve the salt in the water before adding to the flour – this ensures that the salt is thoroughly distributed through the dough. 
When adding the shortening though, it's better to use your hands as you have better control over the size of fat particles in the dough. For a flaky crust, you want the bits of fat to be roughly pea-sized, any smaller and you have a mealy pie though (not flaky).

I really like using this recipe!   As an amateur pie baker, I found this really easy to make and work with!  It turned out well, too!  I  sprinkled a little sugar over the top before adding in my filling. It resulted in the best looking and tasting crust! Love it!

I made this crust for my pumpkin pie. I was disappointed, as I thought it was just okay nothing spectacular like the reviews suggest. The crust was too flakey imo,  & the bottom of the pie crust did not bake flakey like the rest. Average.

Loved the idea of using cold butter and ice water.  It makes a huge difference when rolling out.  The video didn't give tips on rolling out.  I put large piece of aluminum foil down and floured.  My big remaining problem is rolling it out large enough to lie over the edge of the pie plate.  Guess I could measure the diameter of the dough before lifting it. CEG

Didn't change a thing! Beautiful and flaky results! Somewhat crumbly when rolling but I wanted to go light on the water! I used this because I needed a single cooked pie shell and I didn't want to use a graham cracker shell. Once I put the dough in the pie plate I poked it generously on the bottom and all around the side. Baked beautifully at 425 degrees F for about 12 - 15 minutes.  Reminds me of the recipe our Home Economics teacher gave us in high school in the early 70's! Will use again!

This pie crust was extremely easy to make and tasted delicious.  I have used it with several different style pies and it seems to lend itself nicely to a multitude of different flavor profiles.

Crust is delicious! I took someone's idea and used half butter and half shortening. This crust is a great compliment to my apple pie with a crumb topping recipe I found on here!

Stupid simple. First time making my own pie crust. I just followed the directions, and it turned out beautifully. I didn't have a pastry blender so I used my whisk in a gentle mashing motion to cut in the Crisco. I didn't have time to chill, but it still worked out fine. Put it between two sheets of wax paper to roll. It makes it even easier and keeps the flour-y mess to a minimum.

Needed much more water. Also I used butter and it worked great! When I want to make a pre-baked crust I cook in the over at 475 for 10 minutes.

I found this pie crust to be too small but it turned out okay.  If I try it again I'm going to double it. It was also extremely flaky!

Made this for the first time and it turned out great! Like others said it was too crumbly to roll out at first but I just added enough water so I could work with it. My only complaint was that I had no left over. It made exactly enough to fill a 9 inch pie dish. I wanted to add a lattice top so I had to use a frozen crust for that.

First, I made it exactly as directed. It was really good as far as texture went, but the flavor left something to be desired. Definitely better suited to savory pies. 

I now either make it with butter, or a butter-shortening blend. Flavor and texture are fantastic.

Forgive me if this tip has already been mentioned, I can't see the reviews on my phone: put your ice water in a spray bottle. The moisture will be perfectly dispersed, no concentrated spots where you would otherwise drizzle water, and no overworking the dough trying to get the drizzled water to make one cohesively moistened ball.

This crust was wonderful. I used it to top a chicken pot pie and it worked perfectly. I used my Ninja food processor to whip this up in a snap, following the ingredients exactly. I only chilled for 20 minutes because I was impatient. I didn't even use flour or wax paper to roll this out, just my bare counter top and it was a dream to work with. Did not stick to the counter or the rolling pin. Love this recipe, can't wait to try it out with my fresh raspberries from my garden this Summer!

I had never made a pie crust because it seemed like way too much work, but this is beyond easy!! I used cold butter instead of shortening, but it was still absolutely perfect. My blueberry pie was so delicious no one guessed I was an amateur!

Taste is great. Made it for a chicken and mushroom pie. One word of caution: I did it according to recipe to 'fill it and bake'. Not the best advice. While the upper pastry is cooked, the bottom part remained uncooked even after I returned it to the oven. I will pre-bake the bottom part next time before adding the filling. One star shaved off for the uncooked bottom part.

So I was disappointed in this recipe after all the reviews it received. My pastry dough was extremely hard to roll our and kept breaking off. The taste was very bland. Dont think I will try this one again.

Very simple and came out fantastic.  I used butter because I didn't have shortening.  Thanks!
10/11/14:  Made this today using 1/2 cup oat flour and 3/4 cup white, and 1/3 cup butter to make it a little healthier, and it was still great.

This recipe is great. I have made it several times and everybody always compliments on it. I use it for savory pies, mostly pot pie and quiche. I've never chilled the shortening and it has always turned out great.

I was extremely disappointed with the end result. This was my first attempt at a flaky pie crust, so there's a chance the fault lies with me. I used plain Crisco shortening, if that makes a difference. I had problems rolling it out, so I might have overworked the dough. The best result was obtained on the top, where I painted on an egg-white glaze. There the crust actually WAS flaky, tender, and flavorful. This is the first recipe on this site that has disappointed, but again my technique may be to blame.

This dough was too crumbly. I did what another review suggested to add a little more water. It was still too crumby and very hard to roll. I think ill go back to my usual pie crust.

This makes a nice flaky pie crust, however you may need to increase the liquid just a smidgeon.

Wonderful pie crust.  This was very easy to roll and came out great for my applesause custard pie. I did not even chill the dough.  Thanks for the recipe Stephanie.

The proportions here are a very good guide, the instructions are straightforward and easy to follow. I've made this twice for British Beef and Onion Pie, and my husband says the crust has a nice flavour and is pleasantly flaky, I follow everything else exactly and am more than satisfied with the results. 

If you care what your pie looks like (we eat with our eyes!), not included in the instructions is to brush the top (for double crust) with egg whites or milk to give it a nice, shiny browned top (you'd otherwise have a dry-looking, pale pastry - ask me how I know!). 

Thanks for this recipe, stephanie!

I'm new to baking pies, and this was super easy. Took the advice of other reviewers and used butter instead of shortening -- no regrets.

This is a fantastic crust recipe!  I've made it several times and now it's my go-to crust recipe.  It's perfect as is for savory pies and I like to add a tablespoon or two of sugar for sweet pies.  I usually use butter instead of shortening because that's what I keep on hand and it still turns out wonderfully.

I used butter instead of shortening, put filling in and baked it at 400 for 10 mins, then at 350 for 50 mins. I used it for pecan, pumpkin and apple pie, it came out perfect every time.

I have been using this recipe for the past 3 years when I take pies to Thanksgiving/Christmas dinners at Dad & Mom's. My mom, who is an awesome cook, actually asked me for this recipe this week, after telling an old friend what perfect pie crust I make. :) Also, I appreciate how well this recipe quadruples!

Finally...a sure thing.
It helped to watch the video on how to make pie crust as to the amount of water to add to the pie crust. I double the recipe to make enough for top and bottom crust. Works perfectly every time!

Oh my gosh! I forgot to review this wonderful recipe every time I used it, and I'm finally going to do it. The first time I tried making the crust, I was confused about how to  to go about the directions. Until I learned that this was best made using about two tablespoons of sugar, mixed in with the flour and salt of course, and smashing the shortening into the mixture. I find it a little easier to use lukewarm water instead of ice water, it helps the chilled shortening to soften up. Add a little more flour if the mix starts to get stuck to your hands, or whatever you're using. 
 The overall taste of the crust is amazing, and I use it in all of my pies now! It's amazingly better, and cheaper than store-bought. The texture is exactly as the title says: Flaky. If you want a better taste, try using butter-flavored shortening. Oh, and a very good hint is to sandwich the dough between wax paper(it's almost necessary).

The end result was a flaky and tasty crust.  Will try again

This recipe is no fail. I always have to add more water than it calls for though. Sometimes I just use all unsalted butter which works great too. I have no problem halving this recipe if I only need one crust.

Already repeated this one.  Great simple recipe.  Flakiest crust ever.  I have subbed part butter for some of the shortening to add a bit of flavor as well.  Stands up to alterations and is very easy to handle and roll out.

Easy and delish!  I used half butter and half shortening -- flaky and flavorful.  I used the wax paper above and below per other recommendations and am glad I did ... otherwise I think it would have stuck to my board.  Thanks for sharing!

Love this recipe!!! Turns out so flaky, I always get so many request for the recipe. I always use butter,I always just put some water in a glass then put it in the freezer with ice cubes in it and use as much as I need, I skip the 30 min fridge time and just roll between wax paper and turns out perfect!! When im making a double pie crust I always make one at a time...turns out better IMO and I dont have to eyeball it when splitting it up...that way I know its exact!

This looks like a great recipe, one my husband really wanted to try.  We don't doubt the many folks who made this recipe with great success, but we did not have success, even after trying it twice.  We have come to the conclusion that living in high altitude, along with the fact that this is our dry season, is what is causing my husband to have so much trouble with pie crusts this time of year. They just turn into crumbly balls, and you cannot work with them.  It seems when he makes them in summer, which is rare, he doesn't have the troubles he does in the winter.

The flakiest most delicious crust ever! I use more water than is called for. I don't keep track, just keep adding tablespoons until it holds together. I also use all butter and no lard. Perfect!

This was awesome! I don't know much about pie crust, but I DO know how to screw recipes up, and this was still delicious! I used it to lattice this apple pie recipe: http://allrecipes.com/recipe/apple-pie-by-grandma-ople/#, I didn't have a rolling pin so i used a wine glass and some flour.

This recipe is one of the best and easiest I've ever tried. This gives my grandmother's recipe a run for its money, no doubt. I add 1 tbsp raw sugar just because I prefer a slightly sweet crust. I also roll out between two pieces of waxed paper or cling wrap. Makes transfer easy and clean-up a breeze.

I have used this pie crust at least 10 times now and it has never let my down. I use it for potpie a lot. I always double the recipe for a double crust and never have any problems. I was wondering if anyone has tried it with wheat flour?

Fantastic and simple ingredient crust. I do not think this crust is for a beginner, however, I did read a comment from someone who is a beginner (& it turned out great for him). Just trust the recipe.. it may seem dry, but once you play with it to roll it out, it gets soft. It comes out so flaky and delicious. It is also a vegan recipe, which is a total score.

Super simple to make in the food processor and it tasted incredible. I added cinnamon to the dough because I used it to make an apple crisp. I will definitely make this again instead of buying pie crust!

I cannot believe how easy this recipe was! I hadn't made a pie crust in over a decade, and this came out perfect!  I did have the problem of the dough cracking when I rolled it, but I would just patch it as needed.  Can't wait to use this again.

How lucky am I? This was my first attempt at a pie crust and I lucked out with the best recipe on the first try. Thank you! This is easy to prepare, and the crust bakes up beautiful and flakey with rave reviews saying it was the best blackberry pie my family had ever had. I used butter flavored shortening, and next time I may experiment with half butter just to get more of a buttery taste. Thank you !! :) No more rolled pre-packaged crusts for me !!

Wonderful pie crust. The first time I made the crust exactly as listed. This time I used 1 1/2 cups of flour and about 2 table spoons more of shortening and increased the water as needed. Thanks.

Not as convenient as buying a pre-made, frozen pie shell, but this recipe is actually extremely easy, cheaper & tasty! I double the recipe & put the shortening & dry ingredients in a food processor, process on low 'til it starts to become flaky (roughly about a min, scrape the sides, then a min more). From there, I transfer to a bowl & toss with a fork, slowly adding water 'til it starts to stick (did not use all the water), then refrigerate for 30 min or so. I then cut the dough ball in half, roll each half out in-between 2 pieces of wax paper, & either use 1 immediately & freeze the other in a lightly oiled or dusted pie tin, or freeze both for later use. Usually use them within a week or 2 of freezing, & thaw on the counter at room temp for 15-20 minutes. Great for pot pie or quiche.

Used butter with mine, but other than that, no changes.  I will use this recipe instead of what I've been using.  Also, read somewhere to grate the butter for mixing--what an awesome idea--it made it sooo much easier to mix up.

This is the best pie crust I have ever baked!!! It beat any frozen crust. It was flaky and the bomb. I followed the recipe exact, except I used pastry flour in place of the all-purpose flour. Anyone that likes flaky crust, this is the recipe for you. TEN STARS!!!

Making this pie crust was really hard because it kept crackling and sticking to the rolling pin every time I tried to roll it, so eventually i just stuck the dough to the pan. In taste, the crust tastes REALLY GOOD!!! I would only recommend this recipe if ur good at making pie crust, but if ur a beginner like me it will be a little hard to handle

I haven't baked in years, decided to make a pie for father's day. This recipe was really hard to roll out for me, but I am WAY out of practice. I persevered, patched it all together, and baked it. It isn't pretty, but man, is it flaky!! My Mom always said, if it rolls perfectly, and you don't have to do some patching, it's probably not very good pastry, and in this case I can see what she meant. This recipe is a definite keeper!!!

Great pie crusts! I doubled the recipe for a chicken pot pie and used the tip about using a food processor to cut in butter (which I used because I didn't have shortening).  Then poured crumbs into a bowl to add ice water.  This worked great!

Not a good crust for fruit pies. I tried it with rhubarb pie but the dough couldn't be rolled out to make a top crust, it just kept falling apart.

I have not tried to make my own pie crust for 30+ years. My grandmother diligently tried to teach me using this type of recipe when I was a teen and I was a complete failure. I do great with any other type of baking, but this is something that has always eluded me. Last night my oldest daughter asked me to make my from scratch chicken pot pie, that I usually buy premade crust for. I didn't have time to run to the store and so decided to try my hand at crust again. I gave this recipe 4 stars only because the baking instructions are missing and because, similar to others, I had a lot of trouble rolling out, so some tips for how to make that go smoother would have been nice. It wasn't pretty, but it was delicious. My husband came home late from work and didn't know that I had made the crust. He sat down in the arm chair with his plate to relax and eat his dinner and his first comment was "this crust is sooooo good." I also appreciate the gluten free instructions that the site links to this recipe. My 2nd born has to be GF, so I guess that may be my next attempt! As noted by other reviewers, this is only enough for a large single crust. You need to double the recipe for a double-crust pie.

The crust was easy to work with, however, I did not know if it was a one crust recipe or for a two crust pie.  I was disappointed when I had to make the recipe again to finish my pie.

Very easy recipe.  This was my first attempt at home made pie crust.  It turned out fine.  However, was slightly confused regarding adding water a few drops..."until the dough comes together"  I did not add enough water so dough difficult to roll out.  Overall the end product was good.  I'm assuming the "comes together" means it should form a ball.

I'm a grandma who has been baking pies for as long as I can remember.  This was by far the easiest and most flaky crust I've ever made.  It held together nicely, rolled out cleanly and best of all was a perfect base for my new favorite French Silk pie!

I seldom make pies. This crust was wonderful. I used part butter/butter flavored shortening. Made a double recipe. Flaky and tender. No need to try a different recipe.

Oh my goodness! I HATE making pie crust! I have never made a single crust that turned out well... Until today! This was fantastic and super easy. I honestly made it with every intention of scraping the pie goodness off the nasty crust. However, it turned out perfect. Almost like a shortbread crust. This will be the only crust I make from now on. 
I mixed mine up in my food processor. Whirred up the dry ingredients for a few seconds, added fat and mixed it up until it was coarse crumbs, then sprinkled water in until a ball formed. Popped it out of the processor. Didn't bother to chill it since I didn't really plan to eat it. :) Rolled out quickly and easily. Pricked it and blind baked it for 20 min at 350. Perfect pie crust! 
thanks!!

Nope, this didn't come out for me and followed exactly and couldn't get it doughy enough to roll out.  Will stick to the one with a little more than two ingredients.

This is the first time I tried making my own pie crust. I've always heard about how hard it was to make a good pie crust. This recipe made it simple.  It turned out fabulously!! As other reviews suggested, I used butter and did not wait for it to chill in the fridge. I don't think I'll ever use store bought crust again!!

Very good crust, and easy even though I had to use my magic bullet to cut in the shortening a little at a time!  Only four stars, but because I read reviews that said butter worked better than shortening, for my top crust I followed the recipe again but used butter instead. I did have a "five star" result with that substitution, but the bottom crust was good, too!

perfect crust and easy to make. Those who said it fell apart haven't worked much w/ pie crusts before. Moisture is relative so sometimes you have to add a few drops more water than other times. Just have to feel it and see when it comes together.

I doubled the recipe to make a top and bottom crust for a shepherd's pie and it was AMAZING! The crust is so flakey and delicious, I will be making this again for sure. I made the shepherd's pie with this crust for my dad and my brother and they both loved it! This is a great recipe and i am so glad that I found it!

At age 57, I made my first pie this past Thanksgiving..!!  This was the culmination of a decades-long 'threat'  My crust was stellar - flaky, tasty, and perfect.  I did bake it before adding the apples.  I have a new holiday task - and received an Emile Henri deep dish pie plate as a thank you.  Hey, I'll never win blue ribbons, but I did get an EH for my efforts.  Thanx for sharing, Steph..!!

Easy and quick pie crust. Made this for a last minute sweet potatoe pie on Thanksgiving. I too, used chilled butter instead of shortening. Though I don't know how it would have tasted with shortening, with butter it was nice and buttery. Nice flaky crust too. I prebaked it for 15 minutes then per another reviewers suggestion, I brushed it with some egg white and baked an additional 2 minutes for a moisture seal. I'm not sure if that really made much of a difference, so next time I will try without the egg white to save time. I will also try this crust for a double crusted pie and see how that turns out.

Such an easy recipe to follow!  I used the butter flavored crisco sticks that I had on hand and this gave it a buttery flavor.  I am so happy I found this recipe because I plan on making all of our Thanksgiving pies.

My dough came out super sticky with the recommended water amount so I had to add a bit more flour.  I made mini peach pies with the crust and wasn't wowed at all.  I will try again with a 9" pie just to see if it makes a difference to me or not.

I have never had luck with pie crust.  This recipe changed that!  I followed someone's instructions on doubling the recipe and it worked well.  I used regular shortening and I might try butter next time.

Amazing and super easy to make! I start with 2 tbsp of ice water and work my way up to make sure it's perfect! Many people have had issues rolling out the dough, but I find it super simple as long as I use a floured MARBLE rolling pin...which is freezable. Sometimes a cold surface works better!

Perfect! If I am making a sweet pie, I usually add about a teaspoon of sugar as well. I have also found that if I measure the flour and salt into a bowl, and measure out the shortening and then put it into the freezer for about an hour ensures a super flaky crust. This is my go-to pie crust recipe!

This is one crust.  If you want to make a double crust pie you must double the recipe.  I have been making a similar crust for over 50 years and it is simple and delicious.  I am famous for my pies, so trust me when I say it's good.  I got my original recipe from the back of the Crisco label and made it with crisco for years, but now I do use butter because it's so wonderful that way.

Very good go-to recipe.  For the record I always make it with whole wheat flour and it works out perfectly and adds a little wholesome grain to any deliciously indulgent pies with yummy crust.  I also agree with those of you who are using butter instead of shortening.  Much yummier and easier to work with.

WOW!  I have officially changed my usual pie crust recipe to this one. I really cannot emphasize how well this turned out on multiple pies!  This recipe was no fluke - it works if you follow the directions exactly.  It is V-E-R-Y easy to make, even for a super beginner.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone who wants to make an amazing tasting pie!

Love it! Perfect for quiches and pumpkin pie - versatile for anything! I've tried it and enjoyed it with both butter or Smart Balance 50/50 and it turns out great either way! I do mix the ingredients by hand - I've learned that bigger crumbs of butter make it flakier. Don't chill the dough. Maybe put a little flour on your rolling pin so the dough doesn't stick to it. I roll it out directly on a piece of parchment paper to make it easier to transfer to my pan! Easier cleanup, too!

I have always been afraid of making pie crust. It has always seemed do hard, until now. Not only was this recipe incredibly easy to make it turned out perfectly. Even though my first pie was runny the crust remained flaky. I used the recipe again for a chicken pie and it was great. The crust is perfect for both sweet and savory pies. I will definitely use this recipe over and over again.

Great pie crust. I'm a pie-baking novice, and my first try didn't turn out too well, but after reading reviews I used my food processor to combine the flour and fat (I used butter). I chilled the dough for a little extra, and rolled it out between two layers of plastic wrap. I also doubled the recipe so I would have enough pastry for the top and bottom. It turned out delicious and flaky and lovely. Will definitely use again!

very yummy.  I used this in a pumpkin pie for my dad for father's day.  He said that it was exactly what pumpkin pie should be.  Everyone else loved it too.  I didn't have shortening so i used butter instead and if was fabulous!

This was my first homemade pie crust.  Living overseas, and having a small commissary, has forced me to make foods I would have bought pre-made.  This was easier than I thought it would be.  I have heard how difficult it is to make a light flaky pie crust, but this worked well for me.  I doubled the recipe and used butter flavored crisco stick.  I pulsed the crisco into the dry ingredients with a food processor.  Then into a bowl where I added water.  I rolled it in between wax paper as suggested.  I made the Blueberry/raspberry pie from this site.  It was fantastic!

this is not a double pie crust :( i made 2 batches of this for apple pies and it says to divide into 2 so i did and even weighted it to make sure they were even there is no extra at all so you have to roll this perfectly or it will not fit a standard shallow pie pan :( so ive had to throw out this and pull out the better homes and garden cookbook for a double pie crust :(

Absoulutely delicious pie crust!  I made it, as others had commented, with butter rather than shortening since that's what I had available.  It was my first time ever making a "from scratch" pie (tart cherry is what I made) and I was so delighted with how this came out!  Thank you for this amazing recipe!

I followed other's suggestions, and this tastes great.  I don't have shortening on hand usually, so I use butter instead of shortening.  I also use the food processor to mix.  It turns out fantastic.  I use it for pot pies and quiche, too.  If I make a pie, this is the recipe I will use.

I used this for the first Pie i ever made.  I found it very easy to work with and i was proud of myself.  i probably worked with it a tad too much, but for my first time i thought i turned out great! my mom said that it seemed like it should have been thicker, but it was still good.

I love cooking, but always hated baking because I simply couldn't do it. Today was my very first time baking. Tried this recipe and it came out just perfect, no mess, easy to make and easy to roll. When I took it out of the fridge it was really hard, so I place it near the oven so the heat would soften it a bit and then I was able to roll it. The filling I made was way to sweet and the crust has no flavour/sugar therefore it helped balance the sweetness  a bit.

i wanted to make a special pie for my dad's birthday instead of a cake, who's diabetic. this was just the perfect crust to use with the pie filling recipe. it was very easy and simple to make and will continue to use this recipe for sure. my dad actually commented on the crust and thought it was really flaky and delicious. thanks for the recipe and making my pie one of the "best he's ever had!" his words after the first slice :)

I have to say that it's perfect for picture taking but no so good for eating. It sure tasted like I was eating shortening. It looked beautiful and I was a little disappointed once I took a bit. Next time I will try butter and add sugar. The texture was perfect the taste wasn't

This was my first time making a pie crust from scratch. I used my mom's pastry cloth, my grandmother's rolling pin and this recipe. It was awesome!! I initially was going to use the shortening it called for but found I was out :-( I used a stick of butter right from the fridge instead. It came out beautifully (and tasty!) Thanks Stephanie!

Wow, this definitely is very flaky and an excellent crust.  Very basic, very easy, and turns out well.  I used my food processor to make it (mixed the flour and salt, added chortening until it was crumbly and mixed, then added water until it formed a ball) since I was feeling lazy this morning, and it made enough to cover my quiche pan, which is what I was going for.  I didn't bother chilling the dough, so you basically can if you want or not depending on time.  I made this for the Tomato and Basil Quiche on here.  Thanks for the recipe!

This pie crust was pretty easy to make and tasted good. I used it with a quiche and everyone liked it. It wasn't really enough for my pie plate. Looked a little sparse. I may add just a little bit more of the ingredients next time. I had to use a little bit more ice water too. Probably like 4 tablespoons. I used butter flavored shortening which was good but now I want to try this again with butter since so many reviewers said they used butter. I wasn't sure how to prebake this so I just put it on like 400 or 450 degrees for about 5-7 minutes with some fork holes poked in the bottom. Seemed to work. I will use again.

This pie crust was perfect for my chicken pot pie, and very flaky (I doubled the recipe which gave enough for a top and bottom crust).  Living in the land without shortening I substituted 110 grams chilled butter (per crust), cut into small pieces.  3 Tablespoons ice water is about 45 ml.

Really flaky, really good! Subbed about1/8-1/4 C of the shortening with Coconut oil to add a little extra flavor.

Perfect! I use real butter instead of shortening and whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and it tastes fantastic! I double the recipe and make pot pie with it all the time. Also, mix it up the day before, let it sit out of the fridge for at least 12 hours, then put in the fridge for 30 minutes to get the health advantages of soaked grains!

i followed the instructions to a T and this recipe did not turn out. Then i went and watched a video and now i know what this recipe is mixing. For step 2, dont just gently gather the balls together, mush them together and knead into a round disc..

Update!  After doing more research I learned a few more tricks to make the crust flaky. Cut the stick of butter into small pieces before blending into the flour mixture. Blend as quickly as possible so that the mixture stays cold. Follow the directions as usual. When ready roll out between two sheets of parchment paper - less mess and no more additional flour. Put it into pan and refrigerate til ready to use. Another step to keep it cold. I followed these steps and used the crust for peach cobbler and a pot pie.  I could see the layers in the crust and the taste is great! 


I used cold butter instead of shortening, added 4 tablespoons of ice water and tossed with the fork until everything was sticking together.  I then wrapped the dough in plastic and put in the freezer for 45 min.  Used about 1/2 flour to roll out the dough.  This was top and bottom crust for peach cobbler and it was great!

This crust is awesome. I did have to add extra cold water to it. No big deal though. I should note that this was my first time making my own crust. So I was a little scared on doing it. But it turned out perfect! I will always use this recipe. Oh and I used real stick butter right out of the fridge instead of shortening. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

I gave this 5 for taste because I think the shortcomings of the crust were entirely user error. I am obviously not a good roller of dough and it didn't look pretty by the time I patched it up but it tasted delicious. I'll give it about 10 more attempts becfore I take a star from the rating to be sure. Practice, grasshopper.

Needs more than 3 tablespoons of water. Otherwise, very good and flaky, I used lard instead of shortening, and got good reviews from all who ate.

I love this crust. I made it as written and it came out perfect light flaky. I do not own a pasty blender or food procesor so i used a large four pronged serving fork it worked fine as for the size crumbs i did make them very fine and i still came out with a light flaky crust

My first pie crust!!!  I loved it, and will never buy a shell ever again!!!  I used butter flavored crisco instead of the regular kind.  They come in the sticks which was easy to measure and just mashed it in the flour with a fork.  What I didn't know(because I'm not an expert cook)is the recipe is just enough for the bottom of a pie.  If you need a crust for the top as well, you will need to double the recipe..  This is the best crust I have ever eaten and it looks beautiful as well, thank you Stephanie!!!!

I made 2 double pie crusts from this recipe and they both turned out perfect!! I used frozen butter and put the water in the freezer until very cold. I also kneaded the dough until smooth once it came out of the fridge and rolled it out onto lightly floured wax paper. I eggwashed the edges of the bottom crust (egg & milk). The top crust I cut out a 1 inch diamond shape in the centre of the dough before rolling it onto the pie. I fluted the edges together to make both crusts seal together and baked it at 375 for 40 minutes for an aluminum pie plate and 1 hour for a glass Pyrex pie plate. Fantastic recipe!!

Last night was my very first attempt at making pie crust. I used this recipe and followed it to a T. Only exception I made was substituting butter for shortening. The crust came out PERFECT! I couldn't believe it! It was so flaky and tasty, was not over dry or soggy. 
I used this with Libby's pumkin pie filling and it was perfect. My only regret is making last nights pie as a trial run for Thanksgiving...  I hope my actual Thanksgiving pie turns out this good! Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this with a stick of butter.  It came out super moist, even before adding any water, and I had to add another 1/4 cup of flour.  Next time, I'll try it with less butter.  I also used 1 c all purpose flour and the rest whole wheat flour.  Still very tasty.

A very good flaky pastry recipe.  Very easy to make and very easy to roll out.  I doubled the recipe and used it with the Chicken Pot Pie IX recipe on this site.  I highly recommend this recipe.

I tried this recipe with both a quiche and a fruit pie, and the crust had too much of a shortening aftertaste, and it was a bit too salty for me. But it lives up to its name, and is a flaky crust. I probably won't make this crust again.

Absolutely the flakiest and best pie crust I've ever made, and I've made a lot of them!  I didn't let the shortening chill, nor did I chill the dough before rolling.  It was a little crumbly when I began rolling it out, so I'll take time to chill it first in the future.  I like this recipe for its simplicity.  It was the perfect compliment to the fresh cherry pie filling. I doubled the recipe and had enough to make a double-crust pie.  I had enough dough left over to make a 9-inch pastry shell to freeze.  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.

this tasted really good. though i did have quite a lot of problems with it. i put the dough in the freezer like it said and followed to the recipe exactly but it was really hard to roll it out! i put flour on the counter and the roller and the dough, but it just wouldn't stop sticking to the counter and breaking when i tried to lift it. i tried moving it around as i was rolling to keep it from sticking but it did anyway. after a while i just rolled pieces out and then pieced them into the pie pan. it was my first pie and i am not going to give up on making them!!

Very flaky pie crust but did I have trouble rolling it out which I am going to assume is because I did not let the shortening chill.  It was still very good.  Thanks

This was so simple! I needed a fast crust for a quiche this morning and this turned out perfectly. Easy to follow recipe and the perfect size for one pie...Thank you. Next time I will try a fruit pie in it.

This worked well. The flavor was not amazing. It seems like you may have to use more shortening; a little more may give it a better texture since you'd handle the dough a little less. I did use this for a savory recipe.

I would give this recipe more stars if I could! I have mastered so many recipes since I've learned to cook, but try as I might, pie crusts haven't been one. NOT ANY MORE!! This was the easiest recipe and couldn't be more perfect..I'm so excited! This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

Wow, this crust was flaky and sooo easy to prepare and to handle. I could not believe I actually made this crust! However, the only thing I would change would be to add a little sugar and maybe up the salt to 1/2 tsp. Other than that, this is the bomb!! Thanks for a great recipe!

perfect recipe for a single crust. I didn't even chill it and it still rolled out beautifully.  I rolled inbetween waxed paper, worked great. Dusted flattened dough with a little flour, top and bottom, placed waxed paper on top and bottom and worked great!  Now I"m going to fill it with my lemmon pie filling... YUMMO! Thanks for a great recipe!

Wonderful and easy crust.  Made for my chicken pot pie.  Will definitely make again.  I can't wait to do it for a fruit pie.  I used butter flavored crisco.

I am a novice at making pie crust and this recipe made a perfect crust for my chicken pot pie.  Like another reviewer suggested I did not chill the dough and I rolled it out between sheets of waxed paper.  It was very flaky and delicious!

Pretty excellent and easy to work with.  I thought I was going to have a tough crust after rolling it back out several times b/c I made mini pie crusts.  But even the last ones I made looked and tasted great!

Not a first-timers pie crust...was too hard to work with, both times I tried to make it dough easily cracked as I rolled it. Following tips - essentially by keeping things as cold as possible - helped.

Excellent! This was my first attempt at making a pie crust and it turned out amazing. I doubled the recipe and used the other reviewers' tips (2 1/2 C flour, 1/2 tea. salt, 1 C shortening, and 1/4 C AND 2 Tbls. ICE COLD water).

This pie crust did end up good as long as I put enough shortening in it.  I make 8 pies and made the crust before and refrigerated the crust before making them.  The crusts that had, what I thought was too much shortening them were the ones that truly turned out the best.

Made a great flaky pie crust and the recipe was very quick and easy! The only problem was that I didn't cook the crust long enough before adding my filling, so the bottom was a little doughier than I would have liked. Overall it was a great crust!

taste like any other crust.  --UPDATE-- i feel bad about reviewing this so quickly, and giving it three stars. in the past week, i've made this 4 times, doubling it every time. i'm probably going to make this in the afternoon again. i use it for everything that needs crust. the measurements are very simple to remember. i'm jacking the stars up to five.

I used this crust with Grandma Ople's apple pie recipe on this site, and it was so delicious. I had to triple the recipe for a bottom crust and a lattice top. I'll never use another crust recipe again. This is it!

This was easy, and turned out great. Roll it out very thin. I got compliments on this with the "mom's apple pie" recipe and it also works with pot pies. What a combo! My husband was finally satisfied with my pie crust. Just a hint--I didn't use the amount of water in the recipe. I know I used more, but not sure the amount--just until the dough was right.

I have made this recipe 3 times now and have not failed once! I have tried the ice water method and it did not work for me. Getting the  shortning or butter cold does   for me. I have been married for 40 years and this has been the only  pie crust recipe that works for me. Thank you for sharing it with us.

I loved this recipe! It is basic but very, very good. The dough wasn't difficult for me to handle. I put the shortening in the freezer for a short time and made sure my water was very cold also. I did have to add extra water. After I rolled the dough out I used a thin metal spatula to take it off my surface. Very easy!

My first attempt at making a pie crust.. not bad, but not spectacular either.  The crust came out flaky as the title of the recipe states, and not soggy on the bottom of the pie as I feared.  It was a little difficult to roll and keep from cracking (no fault of the recipe, I'm sure), and I used it with the "Apple Butter Pumpkin Pie" recipe from this site.  Thanks for the simple recipe!  Next time I will try with butter and see which I like better.

This was my first time ever making a pie crust, so I wasn't really sure what I was doing. That being said this turned out alright. I had a few issues with a lattice top I was making, but that was more due to my inexperience than the crust itself. I thought this crust could have been a wee bit sweeter so I will probably use a different recipe next time for that reason.

Didn't turn out well for me at all...I can NEVER get the bottom crust to cook right and I don't know why...my oven temperature is fine (I had it checked)...I follow the instructions and for some reason I always seem to set a white bottom crust.

I made this with chicken pot pie as a trial before baking pies for thanksgiving since it is crust I am most nervous about making...not nervous any longer!  It was very very flaky.  I will be adding 1 tblspoon sugar like someone suggestion for my dessert pies though...think it needs to tie in with the sweet flavor.

I used 1/4 c. butter and 1/4 c. shortening for the oil, and although the pie crust had a good flavor and was flaky, it wasn't as light as I expected it to be. I think that next time I will use 1/4 c. butter-flavored shortening in place of the butter. Great and easy, I will re-rate when I try the butter flavored shortening. Thanks!

It didn't have enough moisture, the dough kept falling apart when I tried to put it in the pie pan, and when I did the lattice stripping over the pie.

This was a GREAT, flaky pie crust!!!  I used butter-flavored shortening and it tasted wonderful.  I had a little bit of trouble rolling the dough out, but i think that was because i didn't use all the ice water.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

I am wavering between 3 and 4 stars for this. I liked that the recipe had very few ingredients (sometimes simplest is best), but I had a hard time rolling this out. I am a baker but for some reason I cannot make a  pie crust to save my life! So I am going to give this 4 stars. Not the recipe's fault, certainly, thanks for letting me try.

This is Martha Stewart's recipe only that she uses butter instead of lard. Butter makes a better tasting pie crust.

Maybe i did something wrong here, this was the worst dough to work with and when it came out. I wasn't that impressed. I had to make a latice crust and the dough was horrible to work with. Very frustrating.

I made this crust and pre-baked it (350 degrees for 15-20 minutes) for the Coconut Cream Meringue Pie recipe and it turned out great! I think I over-handled the dough quite a bit while rolling it out to get it to fit my pie pan, but it still turned out wonderful. This recipe makes exactly enough to line a 9" pie pan, so you have to roll it out in a good circle to get full coverage. I rolled it out between two pieces of plastic wrap, which made forming it to my pie pan a lot easier. It soaked up just the right amount of the cream pie filling overnight and the whole thing turned out delicious!

YAY!! I've never made pie before. (My father works for a bakery so homemade pies were blasphemous) but I made a pumpkin pie with this crust and it was very good. My husband thought the curst was the best part.

I use a little bit more water than it calls for and Smart Balance margarine and love the saltiness of the crust. I usually make up four crusts and use it for pot pies as well as fruit.

Years later I am still using this recipe! I've switched to butter straight from the fridge. If you do not have a food processor a pastry cutter can handle the cold butter.

I'm inexperienced at making pie crust,but this went quite well. It really is flaky. Definetly want to try using all butter next time and this would possibly be a 5 star.

This was my first SUCCESSFUL attempt at making homemade pie crust.
I followed the recipe (making certain to chill the shortening, bowl and water)
to a tee and it turned out perfectly.  I’ll use this recipe again and again!

Finally, I'm able to make my own crust!  And it comes out great every time, though I also find I need a little more cold water than called for.  I had some trouble last time because the weather was very humid and the dough became sticky!  Great, overall. Thanks!

It's a great crust!!! I used butter flavored crisco and 2 table spoons of sugar to give it a little more flavor. This will be the crust I use for all my pies. Next time I am going to coat the top of the crust with milk and sprinkle a little sugar over it!

This is a great and cheap recipe for pie crust.  It took a little thinking to get the crust to roll out.  I rolled it out with it still wrapped in plastic wrap.

If I could give this more stars I would.  I have never really liked pie crust but I tried this one and it is flakey even on the edges.  Buttery and soft with a slight crisp.  EXCELLENT!

Flavor wise this is very dull but it was easy to roll out which means something to me! It was very flaky. Do not skip the chilling of the shortening. It makes all the difference.

Excellent recipe!   I lost my original recipe for pie crust so I tried this one and I will never use another recipe except this one.  It's true to it's name- flaky!  It's so easy to make and I love the flavor.

This pie crust worked well, but it wasn't nearly as flaky as I was hoping it to be. However, it was really good.

This was an excellent recipe!  I have never made pie crust before, and so in my search to find a simple recipe, I came upon this one.  The recipe was easy to follow and the ingredients were simple.  The only complaint that I have was when we were rolling the dough out, after chilling for 30 minutes, the dough was difficult to roll out without having cracks.  But, the outcome of the dough, was very tasty.  I will definitely make this pie crust again, but I would add a little more water.

this is exactly what the name says it is: basic and oh so flaky!  don't worry if the dough seems crumbly when rolling it, it will turn out fine in the oven.

You can play around with this recipe a lot.  It's all very good.  I used crushed Nilla wafers instead of flour and butter instead of shortening, and it came out still very tasty in my cherry pie.  this is my new pie crust recipe.

may need to add more than 3 tablespoons of water.  

i usually add until the dough comes together relatively well.

otherwise a very consistent pie recipe

This recipe was incredibly easy and withstood abuse... but it just didn't taste very nice. It was too rich, pretty unpleasant even, and definitely tasted slimy combined with the 'brown family's pumpkin pie' recipe. Also, it wasn't sweet at all... but instead of tasting savory and contrasting, it was just bland. Overall, pretty disappointing...

It was pretty easy to make and roll out (I rolled it between 2 pieces of plastic wrap), but I think it was a little too flaky for me.  It fell apart when I touched it after baking.  The taste was nothing special, but at least it doesn't interfere with the actual pie filling.

I must have done something wrong...I probably rolled it too thick and didn't bake long enough. I don't know if that would make a difference in the dryness of this crust. I like a crust to melt in my mouth, instead of feel like a frozen pie crust. 

I will be trying it again to see what gives.

This ended up tasting good ... nice and flaky.  Must say, while I was rolling it out I was a little worried.  Put down some flour and used wax paper to roll out.  Will definitely make again.

This recipe did not work for me at all.  The flavor was fine, but I found the dough to be so dry, even after adding much more than the 3 Tbs icewater called for.  I couldn't roll it out, and it fell apart and I had to piece it together in the dish.  It might be just me, but I will not use this recipe again.

This crust was wonderful!  It came out really yummy and was very light and flaky.  The only thing -- I am an amateur pie maker, so I could not get the bottom crust to stay in one piece despite all the advice given on this website....  luckily, it was a bottom crust and no one could tell that it was patched together! it still tasted unbelievable.

Quick, Easy, Yum.
I just used this crust for a pecan pie. I put the 1/2 cup of shortning in the freezer. It was nice and cold so I cut up the floor and salt into it. Added the ice water and mixed lightly.I quickly roll the dough for small tarts and kept them in the freezer until I was ready to bake. This crust works great with the pecan filling. I will have to try this crust with pot pie.

This is my new crust recipe! This came out just awesome, so buttery and flaky! I was able to double the recipe and used it to make a pot pie. I am sitting here thinking what else I can make to use this crust. 
**Hint to move the crust from one work surface to another and avoid cracking the crust roll the crust on to your rolling pin.

I thought this was a great recipe...super easy. Instead of "cutting" in the shortening, I just stirred it in with a fork and it all came together very well. This one is a keeper!!

Made with butter instead of shortening.  Tasted like a shortbread crust.  Very good... Will try with shortening also soon!!

I have baked many pies and made lots of different crust, but, this is absolutely the very best.  The dough was very easy to work with and was definitly flaky. I have made crust with the very same ingredients before but did not turn out as flaky.  It must be the chilled crisco!!  This will become my "new" favorite!!!

Very good, used smart balance margarine because it's a little healthier (non-hydrogenated).Doubled for apple pie, family loved it.

I made this recipe with a combination of vegan margarine and vegan vegetable shortening.  It works very well.  This is a nice, light crust perfect for apple, pumpkin, and other fruit pies.  (Also works well for bean pie!)
