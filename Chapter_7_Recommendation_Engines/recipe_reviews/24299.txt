This is one of those recipes that keeps ending up on my table just because it's simple, straight forward and delicious.  I recommend using red potatoes and do use sweet onions.  I like to substitute seasoned salt for regular salt and just a dash of garlic powder.  Thanks Candie!

This was a good recipe, but I added cheddar cheese instead of parsley, right before it came out of the oven.  It made the dish!

After reading some of the reviews, I decided to add some seasoning salt and paprika to the potatoes.  I also fried these in about a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil instead of baking them and I completely omitted the butter.  The end result was DELICIOUS!  Will definitely be making this over and over again!

Delicious, easy recipe.  My husband and I loved it.  The kids were less than enthusiastic.  However, I will make it again and dice the onions.  That should make it past the kids. :-)  Thanks for submitting!

With the sweet onions and a little crumbled cooked bacon...and a sprinkling of cheddar cheese at the end of baking and this dish disappeared from the table.  Thanks for the recipe!

This sounded so good, but after reading some of the reviews, I also made added something. I omitted the dried parsley and just before baking I added 2 tablespoons of red cooking wine (sherry) and cut of fresh parsley.  I also added some grated cheese on top for the last few minutes until melted.  It was great.  My whole family loved this dish - thanks for providing it for us.

If you want to totally send this recipe over the top, toss it or top it with some bread crumbs and freshly grated parmesan cheese.

We really liked this.  I used red potatoes and a little seasoning salt and cooked it in the microwave, using the baked potato setting, to keep from heating up the house.  I think cooking it in the butter is the key.  Thanks for submitting

I'll definately make this again. Next time I think I'll probably cook the potatoes for about an hour, and I might add some more spices. It was very good, though!

Very nice and easy potato dish.  Maybe a little spice or herb would be nice to up the flavor.  Thanks for posting the recipe.  Will definitely use it again, maybe with a little thyme or something.

This was good, easier than scalloped.  You can cut the recipe down for a small family easily.  I sprayed the dish w/cooking spray and added lemon pepper, which is good on potatoes.  Will add chopped garlic too next time.  Also I sliced the potatoes real thin. Thanks, Candie, Susie

I have made this numerous times; following the recipe as written.    We love it!!  Leftovers are equally as good.   The main thing here is to make sure to use sweet onions, it makes a big difference.  We have tried it with suggestions from other reviewers by adding cheese and/or bacon;  but our favorite is as written.  Thanks for sharing

I thought this was a good dish because it was so easy, but I baked mine at 425 degrees to cut the cooking time down.  At 350, it would still take a long time for all those potato slices to get tender.

I really liked this recipe!  Even though I didn't have the parsley on hand it turned out great.  Was also very easy to make and not as messy as frying potatoes and onions together like I normally do.  Will make again!

I was very pleased with the way this dish came out.  I used red potatoes, seasoned salt instead of regular, added garlic powder, and used  a little more parsley than what the recipe called for.  I think it would have been bland without the changes I made, hence my rating of 4 instead of 5 stars.  Be sure not to slice your potatoes too thick, or it will take longer than 45 minutes.

This was delicious! The only change I made was to leave out the parsley, and I probably used more salt and pepper. I used Vidalia onions and baking potatoes. I was looking for a dish like Mom used to make when we were kids - just potatoes and onions, baked until tender, edges crisp. This was it! (Caution: if you're slicing these on a mandolin like I was, be sure you use the safety guide. My potatoes didn't quite fit the guide and I wanted the slices big, but thin. Yep, that things starts sliding pretty fast and before I knew it ..... Just be careful out there!)

I was slightly disapointed in this recipe. I was hungry and tired of plain ol' fried taters and onions so i was searching this site and found this recipe. I thought it might be different. Nope it just took twice as long to cook. Should have just made the regular fried tater and  onions. I even added minced garlic since i didnt have parsley. It wasnt bad, just not what i was looking for.

Delicious.  I added garlic salt for seasoning since we love it.  I also added bacon grease to the potatoes and half the butter to give is a loaded baked potato taste.  There was barely enough left for seconds.

Am I missing something? Just made these, followed the recipe but added more seasoning, cheese, bacon. Baked for over and hour and they're still not tender. Very bland no matter what I add:( so disappointed. Prettier than they taste. What did I do wrong??

I fried the thinly sliced potatoes and onions in olive oil, paprika, seasoning salt, garlic and pepper based upon the other suggestions and will bake at 350 for about an hour putting shredded cheese the last 5 minutes.

Very tasty and simple to make.  I used fresh parsley instead of dried and added some chili pepper to spice it up.  Will definitely make it again.

My family liked this alot and I would definitely make it again but cut down on the onion.  It kinda' took over the dish.  I added paprika and seasoned salt and sliced the potatoes very thin so it only took one stirring and 45 minutes to get them nice and tender.  A very easy dish!

This was a simple and quick dish to prepare.  Cooking it was another matter.  I had to keep the potatoes in the oven for over an hour just to get them tender enough!  Also the butter tended to drip to the bottom and congeal with what I had left over but I guess that can be fixed with a quick trip to the microwave.  Maybe next time I'll cut the potatoes into thinner slices.

This is definitely NOT tasty.  It is perhaps the most bland dish I've ever made. I even added spices to liven it up & it still tasted like nothing. I guess if you like bland, tasteless food this one's for you, but otherwise skip it!

This was very good, and so easy to make. The only downside is all you taste is butter (some might like that). It could use little more flavor, maybe some herbs.

Love it! First found it in a vegetarian cookbook and it quickly became a favorite of my dad's and mine. I like adding mushrooms and swiss cheese to mine! Dad like adding those plus chopped bacon.

This is a wonderful side dish my family truly enjoys!!  There's never any leftovers, even my brother when visiting will take some home with him for whatever he is cooking for that day.  I did not change a thing, didn't need to.  I make this dish at least once a week, with fish, chicken, steaks, and just about every meat dish you can think of!

I’ve made this a few times. It’s so easy and foolproof! I love it with sweet onion, but I often leave the onion out entirely for my daughter. Fresh rosemary is a nice addition if you have it. I may try adding some garlic powder next time. And I always pop it under the broiler at the end to crisp up the top. Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

Great recipe! I used red potatoes seasoned with salt, pepper, butter, and a little garlic powder. Perfect recipe for those on a dairy-free diet. I cooked them for about an hour. Delicious

I like this recipe but I usually like some meat with my casseroles so I either add some hamburger already browned or some sausage or thinly  sliced hot dogs (hot dogs don't need browning first).   A small salad on the side makes a great meal...

Microwaved it as we were short on time and it cooked in half the time.  Fam loved it! Next time might add cheese or bread crumbs.
