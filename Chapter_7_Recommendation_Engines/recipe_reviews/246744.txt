The only changes that I made were to the amounts of each ingredient to fit my pot ~ she shanks is the same amount. Instead of green pepper, I used about three or four stalks of celery and added them in with the carrots. About 2 TBSP of Chinese wine was added to the stalk to make the base more sweet and less acidic from the tomatoes. Have fun and enjoy life!

My husband and I enjoyed this so much! Beef shanks add such a nice flavor to the broth. I didn’t add potatoes as I didn’t  have any,  but had all the other ingredients. I will definitely make this again.
