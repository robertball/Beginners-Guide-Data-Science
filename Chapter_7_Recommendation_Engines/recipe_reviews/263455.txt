We love Chef John's videos. He adds a bit of fun to cooking and his tips are spot on! The tortillas turned out great - so much better than the packaged ones.

We have made many different tacos with this recipe. Weâ€™ve used yellow masa so far but just got white to try next!

Excellent instruction!  I rarely watch the videos, but don't skip this one.  I've made flour tortillas for decades, but corn tortillas aren't easy.  This method works!

These tortillas were perfect and homemade is far better than store bought! The texture and taste is just like the homemade corn tortillas I get from a small local Mexican restaurant where the mother makes these daily. The texture is soft, almost near wanting to melt in your mouth good while holding your taco fillings without crumbling apart. I had a few leftover and they reheated nicely for a few seconds in the microwave the next day without drying out. A tortilla press makes these easier to make (just lightly press), but does take some practice...at least for me in removing the tortilla from the plastic without tearing them, but my husband had no problem doing so. Definitely will continue to make these tortillas! Thanks for the recipe!

It takes me right back to my childhood in Miami eating hot, fresh tortillas, slathered in butter with some cinnamon. If you want to press out more at a time and only have one skillet for cooking, use more slips of parchment so you can press them out all at once and then fry them super quick.

These were totally delicious! I made a 5x batch and froze a few stacks. I didn't have a tortilla press but pressing down with 2 big cookbooks worked just as well.

Great recipe! Tortillas turned out beautiful! I cut the water a tiny bit and added the juice from one lime.

Chef John nailed it again! These were simple to make and easier to cook than expected. I doubled the recipe and it was perfect for 2 adults and a hungry college student. I only had coarse Kosher salt so I used 1/2 of this along with 1/2 of fine-ground sea salt; I can't say that there was any difference, but I am going to buy fine ground Kosher for next time. We don't have a press so we used a pan (not the easiest, but worked), but I am ordering a press since I'll be making this recipe on a regular basis. We loved the fresh flavor and after looking up the ingredients on a popular store-bought brand of corn tortillas, I am happy to not be feeding my family all of those unhealthy preservatives and binding agents. Thank you Chef John!

These turned out great! I followed the recipe to the letter, and even watched the video. I was so sick and tired of buying corn tortillas that literally fell apart. I don't seem to have that problem anymore!

Followed the recipe exactly.  Great outcome, but investing in the Victoria tortilla press made all the difference in presentation.  Make sure to get the precooked corn meal.  I used the Goya masarepa.   I made some Beef Barbacoa in the crock pot, home made pico de gallo, all the usual taco fixings.  Sopapillas for dessert.  Great meal!  Thanks for showing me how to do it, Chef John.

This recipe for flour tortillas is so good! Chef John is right about not wanting store bought after making your own. To speed up the process, I used a food processor to crumble the butter into the flour, then transferred the flour to a bowl, and followed the rest of the instructions.  The tortillas turned out so delicious. Thanks!

This is my first time ever making my own tortillas from scratch. I watched the video a couple of times to make sure I had the right consistency. They were perfect. They were easy to make and wonderful to eat. I'll be making my own from now on.

These came out good and were easy to make with my new tortilla maker. There will be a lot of time to work out my technique with this simple recipe.

I followed the recipe precisely.  However, I noticed later that he seems to be using white corn masa harina; whereas, I used yellow corn.  I think the white would have tasted nicer, but mine turned out pretty well for a first time.  I had to add a little more of the masa harina.  I used a plate for pressing.  I thought it was tricky to try to time it before flipping, but I think with practice, I will just go with my instincts on that.  The yellow corn did not get "poofy" but the looks and tastes seemed fine.  I will make this again with maybe a bit of experimenting what I eat with it. Thank you for the clear instructional video.

First time making homemade tortillas, and it won't be my last! My BFF, Jenny, gave me a tortilla press for my birthday, and I finally got up the nerve to try it! Chef John's video really helped. These were fun to make, and really tasty!

Made this exactly as the video.  These were super easy and came out great. I dont have a press so i used his heavy pan method.   Will make these all the time.  Thanks.
