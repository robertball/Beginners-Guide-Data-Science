The wild rice pancakes were phenomenal. I like wild rice and tend to make a lot of it. I cut the recipe in half but kept the Â½ cup of onions. I like onions. I used finely minced white onion instead of green onion and I used flour instead of tapioca. I didn't have any of those items . And, I fried the cakes in bacon grease left over from the bacon I prepared with the cakes. The cakes held together nicely and were very tasty!

I used a box of Uncle Ben's Long Grain and Wild Rice and these turned out great! Maybe just a tad too eggy but still great. If you are going to use 2 eggs I recommend using medium instead of large. The mixture is pretty gummy so to make things easier I used an ice cream scoop to put it in the skillet and then just smashed it down with a spatula. Great recipe and one I will make again!

I just made these using some leftover wild rice pilaf I had from another dish.  It already had bacon, onion, celery and garlic.  I just added onion powder, parsley, egg and some flour (I didn't have any tapioca.)  They were amazing!
