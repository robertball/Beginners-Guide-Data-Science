Quick Chili Haiku: "Basic as it gets. With so few ingredients, used good quality." Used 1 lb. ground beef (browned w/ onion), and only reduced the beans to a 15 oz. can Ranch-style, and the tomato sauce to a 15 oz. can; kept the other ratio/ingredients the same. Nothing to rave about, nor enter in a chili competition, but it was super easy and quick, and we liked it. Would recommend using better brands of the canned items and the chili seasoning packet, since there's not much else that goes in here; I'm not knockin' Kroger brand; we use it all the time and love most of their products, but in this chili's case, it definitely benefits from "better" ingredients.

I love the recipe as a whole. The only thing I made different is that I added shell noodles to it.

Yummy and quick!  I used 1 lb of ground beef and about a pound of leftover taco beef.  Also I couldn't find "chili seasoning" so I used ChiChi's seasoning instead.
