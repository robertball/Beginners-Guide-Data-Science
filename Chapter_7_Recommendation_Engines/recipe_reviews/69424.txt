I have recently discovered tofu and have been looking for recipes to try with it. I made baked tofu last night and didn't want to cook for dinner tonight and came across this recipe. I added in the baked tofu with the rest of the ingredients but felt it was lacking...so I added some minced garlic and more balsalmic vinegar tomatoes and spinach to make it a meal! It was really great and I was surprised!!

I used this recipe with medium-firm tofu that had been marinated in balsamic vinegar. Also substituted soba noodles for bread. It was great.
