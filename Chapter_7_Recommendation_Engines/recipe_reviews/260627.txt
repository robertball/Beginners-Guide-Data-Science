Made as written except that in the ingredient list is calls for the mushroom stems and caps to be diced. Don't dice your caps or you won't have a vessel for your filling. These were pretty good and they turned out very pretty but I'm not sure I was loving the carrots in the mix. With that being said, if using carrots I recommend using red or green bell pepper instead so there is more color in the finished dish. Overall good recipe and one I will make again.
