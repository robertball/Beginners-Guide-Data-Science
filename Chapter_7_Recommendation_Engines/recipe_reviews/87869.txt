This combination goes really well with her Creamy Macaroni and Cheese. I did half bacon and half turkey ham, as that's all I had on hand. I also sauteed some minced garlic in with the onion. 
I sprinkled the top with shredded cheddar and a little paprika. Very, very good.

OMG!!!!!!!! Sooooooooooooo good!  My kids didn't care for the onions, but my husband liked it, even took it to work the next day.  So did I and I wish I had more.  I can't wait to make this for a potluck or Bunco.  I really don't think there is anything that I would change.

Delicious.  I am rating this based on the addition of the bacon and onions as I made baked macaroni and cheese from another AR recipe and then just heated the leftovers on the stove, sauteed the onions & added the bacon and thyme.  I did add a bit of balsamic vinegar & brown sugar to the onions as they sauteed to add a slight sweet/sour flavor.

Very good.  I didn't use the onions though because my family wouldn't eat them, but even without them it was delicious.

Obviously different than traditional mac and cheese, but once you get past that, I think it's wonderful.  Great combination of flavors.

Pretty good!  You have to get past the fact that this is not your traditional mac & cheese, but it is a nice alternative.  It was not grainy at all, but very creamy.  In fact, I thought it had the perfect consistency.  I might add more bacon next time.

This was okay.  I don't know if I cared for the Creamy Macaroni and Cheese recipe as much as I enjoyed the additions of bacon and caramelized onions.  The mac and cheese recipe was just too parmesan-ey for me.  I used a pennini rigate noodle and made the mac and cheese recipe exactly as stated but I just didn't care for it that much.  I probably won't make it again but the next time I make a home-made macaroni and cheese I will definitely add bacon and caramelized onions.

This was great!  I was short on time and used Velveeta cheese with my noodles.  WOW very good and easy.  I'll try making the Creamy Mac & Chesse next time. Everything is good with bacon and onions!

This was fine, the onions and bacon were okay, but I would definitely not add them into the mac and cheese like I did.  It turned the noodles oily and a bit too greasy, made for an ugly dish.

It tasted just right, I thought the bacon was going to over- power. Nope. Just right.

Made this with delicious dish. It was so tasty. The family loved it, the bacon, onions, and thyme gave this already perfect dish a tasty kick.
