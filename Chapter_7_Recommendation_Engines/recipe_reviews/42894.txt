A simple and delicious sauce to make. The only recommendation I would make is that you use a hand blender to give the sauce a smoother consistency. Other than that, it couldn't be better.

By cooking this over a long slow simmer (very very low heat) helps to bring up the spicyness, but you can really speed up the proccess, by turning up the heat. Bring sauce to a fast simmer for 10 mins. add garlic and cook for 5 mins. more. Olive oil is completly optional.

This was quick, easy and YUMMY!!! I would recommend cutting the red pepper flakes in half unless you like it super spicy!!  I found the full amount called for to be a bit much.  Overall though, WONDERFUL.

This was delicious and really, really easy.  I added a tad more hot pepper and just a splash of red wine.  My husband and I loved this and will definitely make it again.

This was pretty simple to make and for a recipe that calls for only a handful of ingrediens, tasted better than I thought it would.  However it tasted a bit too tomatoey and still could use a few other ingredients to liven it up like onions or mushrooms.

I made this as written, and it was not to my liking.  It was very acidic and bland.   First thing, it needed sugar - something to tone down the acidic taste.  I added about 1.5 tsp, and that was not enough.  And it had no spiciness to it at all.  I'm very confused by that given many of the reviews stated it was too spicy, and I'm kind of a spice weenie.  I don't know if my red pepper flakes were too old or a bad brand or something.  I don't know what else it would need to redeem it, but I would start with an entirely different recipe.

Maybe I'm becoming numb to spicy food but being that I only used one can of tomato sauce; I thought for sure it would be spicy enough. I was wrong; ended up adding a tablespoon of crushed red pepper. The only other tweaking I did was adding the staples of my gram's sauce--1 small onion, splash of red wine and some sugar. Very delicious--makes the entire house smell yummy. I threw it over shrimp and angel hair--nice!! Can't wait for lunch tomorrow.

I don't think I was prepared for the spicyness.  My husband couldn't eat it (he's not a fan of really hot things), and my 2 year old wanted it but couldn't take the heat of it.  So I ended up adding tomato sauce to take it a bit and finished the dish myself.  It had good flavor... maybe I could half the pepper.

This sauce is simple and delicious. I used 2 jars of strained tomatoes and the added a chopped tomato for a little texture!  It turned out great! I used homemade dried chili which intensified the hot! I made it with Rigatoni and my Italian husband thought his mom made it!!! Absolutely divine!

Very good! I cut the garlic down to 3 cloves and it was still a little heavy on the garlic for me. I'd only use 2 next time. The sauce was chunky, fresh-tasting, and had just the right amount of spice from the crushed red pepper. Thanks for the recipe! :)

This is the first time I have made my own sauce and I thought it turned out really well. I didn't have basil so i used some cilantro and parsley, and instead of red pepper flakes I used spicy sea salt which consists partly of red hot chili peppers. I loved the kick it had without being super spicy, and over fusilli noodles it tasted great!

This recipe was spot-on.  The only changes were to use a few Tbsp. dried basil, as I didn't have any fresh, and I also sauteed the garlic and spices together before adding crushed tomatoes.  Consistency is very good, as is the spice level.  Great quick sauce!

This is a simple,tasty recipe easily adapted to suit your personal taste.  One thing that has driven me nuts are the comments on the recipe being too spicy. Arrabbiata sauce is HOT...if you don't like hot...don't make it. This is NOT for you.  Also, authentic italian sauces are not thick smooth American spaghetti sauces.  Quick, fresh and simple is the way it's supposed to be...hence, use fresh tomatoes if possible...Fresh is best, but canned are fine, as that's what's easiest and available, except for summer.

Very good sauce, I would pair with garlic bread or fresh crusty french bread and a nice glass of red wine.  I used only half the basil called for, and it was a perfect spicy level for my Husband and I.  I would compare the heat to ordering your chicken wings with medium sauce.  I will definetely make this again :)

This was a very flavorful sauce that was easy to prepare--perfect for a first-time sauce maker like myself.  Using a combination of taste and sight, I only used around 1/2 of the basil called for.  As a neophyte sauce maker, I admit I will be trying other arrabbiata recipes in addition to this one, but I know I've got a good sauce to return to here whenever I need to. Thanks, Rick and Jennifer!

This was "okay".  I will say that I just started cooking, but I DID follow the recipe and I'm not sure what all the raves were about.  I thought it was bland.  I added some sugar and parmesan cheese and that improved it, but the sauce itself is nothing to write home about.

Great! If you use a can of crushed tomatoes instead of diced, they will break up a bit more when cooking and you can eliminate the hand blender. Super Tasty.

It was great, but I was not prepared for the spiciness. I added much less than ordered to, and still it was far too spicy. Without the red pepper flakes, it would have been a five

Excellent.  A recipe with fresh basil and canned tomatoes that justifies my herb pots in the sun room all winter.  A little spicy (and I like spicy) but too much for my husband.  It was so flavorful and aromatic, though, that even he persisted.  I will definitely make again with half the crushed red pepper and maybe add some sausage.  This is an easy recipe that I would be delighted to eat in a restaurant.  To make it at home for literally pennies, and paired with an Albarino, this makes a "Tuesday night special."

This was awesome! I omitted the oil, added a small onion and fresh red pepper and pureed the tomatoes as suggested for a smoother texture and it turned out great.

I love this recipe and make it all the time! I add more pepper flakes because I like things spicy. I also like to add chopped up (cooked) Louisiana Hot Links and sliced red bell peppers during the cooking process.

I used cans of whole tomatoes and crushed them with my hands to get a more rustic texture.  I also added a little dried oregano.  It was great!

This was so easy and flavorful. I love spicy food, so the measurements were perfect for me, but it might be too spicy for my boyfriend...I'll need to halve the red pepper flakes when I make it for him.  Still an excellent sauce!

This was very good and nice and spicey; just the way I like it. I paired it with tortellini and shrimp. YUM and thank you!

Fabulous!  Most people at my house will not eat pasta without meat..But, they ate this and asked for more.  It is now going to be one of my go to recipes.

Given the fact that I never follow a recipe exactly; this recipe provides a good basic foundation for making an Arrabbiata that will become your family's favourite.  Tweak it as necessary.  It's what cooking is all about.  

For example, my Dad clipped a recipe from the newspaper for Chili Con Carne many, many years ago.  He made up a batch and it was so yummy I asked for the recipe.  After several years our chili's are as different as day and night...both exceptionally good (everyone loves them equally) but oh so different.

Cook On!!!!!

bit plain.  maybe add more tomato or lemon juice to zest up.  i used dried basil seasoning because i didn't have the fresh basil and i also didn't have the correct pepper so i used spicy paprika.  i added a diced tomato as well because i didn't have the proper diced can of tomato.... okay so i did the best i could ha

followed exactly except i used two 16oz cans of diced tomatoes. i pureed 1 and left the 2nd diced.  i did add a teaspoon of sugar as i find it eases the tanginess of canned tomatoes.  oops, i did start with a saute of minced onions so i did two wee changes. but the end result was terrific, delicious wonderful flavor.

Mmmm, so delicious. I've been craving a good, spicy pasta dish for a while now, and this dish fit the bill. Not only is it economical, but it is filling, and you can control how spicy it is according to your tastes. I found that by using extra garlic, salt and pepper, and the basil helps reduce the "metallic taste" from the canned tomatoes.  Thanks for the quick, easy recipe, ROgg.

The BEST and I repeat BEST pasta sauce ever. It's so simple you'd think how can this taste good. But I assure everyone that it's perfect I've made this at least 15 times now and will continue to probably forever :)

Really delicious, fresh-tasting sauce. I felt like I was eating at an italian restaurant. It came out more watery than expected, but otherwise it was excellent. And SO easy.

This tasted good. I only made 2 servings for 4 people. The 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes was still too strong for my kidlets so next time I'll decrease it and use only 1/4 tsp. Served with " Zucchini 'Noodles' " and a side of "California Grilled Veggie Sandwich" to use up some squashes and zucchinis from my garden. ***UPDATE*** I used the leftover of this recipe with "Kay's Spaghetti and Lasagna Sauce" for the spaghetti sauce in "Ricotta Stuffed Squash."

I've never followed this exact recipe, but I make Arrabbiata Sauce all the time (tidbit: arrabbiata is Italian for "angry". The sauce is angry and spicy, get it?). A general rule to follow with simple Italian recipes is to use quality ingredients (the best you can find! If your tomatoes taste like a tin can, then good luck making your sauce taste any different), and to taste at various steps in the cooking process, to adjust taste as needed. Italian recipes are mere *guidelines* to follow, you have to add a pinch of this and that to suit your tastes. Happy cooking!

I really enjoyed eating this. I changed a few things like adding onions, using penne pasta (I can't imagine this with spaghetti noodles), and blending 2 cups of the sauce mixture since my tomato chunks were too big. Served it with a side salad and shaved asiago cheese. Did I mention how much I loved eating this?

Love this sauce! I do add the tiniest bit of red wine (less than tablespoon) while cooking to help reduce the acidity of the tomatoes. No more jarred sauce for me!

I doubled the chili flakes as we love spice in my house. I also mashed the tomatoes
to keep them saucier. Super happy as we were trying to re-create a pasta we had in Italy!
