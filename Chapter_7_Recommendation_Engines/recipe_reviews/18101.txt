theres only one problem with this recipe. you should never cook in sesame oil!!! its for flavor only! cook in regular vegetable oil or another oil of your choice, but if you use sesame oil to fry in it will be too strong and will burn easily! for the sesame flavor, add a few teaspoons of the sesame oil to the sauce.
other than that this is an excellent recipe.

Can I give this 10 stars??  Excellent dish!  Couple changes I made.. I used fresh grated ginger instead of powdered and added some lemon zest to the shrimp.  I used 8-12 shrimp per pound then partial way through I butterflied them in half.  The larger shrimp the better you are, these things are as succulant as lobster tails!!  A+++ recipe, great reviews from guests!  Thanks for adding it :)

wow...what a yummy recipe! i used canola oil and added a little sesame oil at the end. also, i used about 3/4 tsp of wasabi powder instead of cayenne pepper. also, i substituted fresh ginger pressed through the garlic press and left out the salt. added a little soy sauce too (why not, huh?). i left out the red pepper and added broccoli and sweet onion. i used frozen broccoli and sugar snap peas, but i think i'll use fresh next time and add mushrooms and water chestnuts. my husband and i got some fresh large gulf shrimp and we had no idea what to do with them. thank goodness we found this recipe!

This was good and easy. I did change a few things. I added 1/4 cup soy sauce to the spices when I marinated the shrimp. Instead of chicken broth I used about 1/2 cup of rice wine and used about 1 tsp of cornstarch. I also substituted soy sauce for the teriyaki sauce. I used powered ginger, but would love to try this with fresh. It turned out very well. My hubby liked it too.

We liked this dish and consider it a keeper but will make some modifications next time.  Agree that the ginger should be fresh and the sesame seeds toasted.  We used Hoison sauce instead of the Teriyaki.  

Next time we will substitute tabasco for the cayenne pepper in the marinade.  Will also add cashews for a bit of texture.  

(This dish paired well with Sauvignon Blanc).

I definitely agree with "WMAQ" regarding the sesame oil issue. I sauteed in canola oil and flavored with the sesame oil. I used packaged frozen stir fried vegies which made this dish finish up very quickly. Instead of the rice, I boiled up some Ramen Noodles and threw them right into the mix. The sesame oil added such a great flavor and hubby gobbled this up like he hadn't been fed in a week! Thanks Debbie!

Really liked this recipe! It was very easy and has a great flavor. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it needs more sauce. Next time I'll just add more teriyaki sauce, and the cornstarch/chicken broth combo. 

This will definatly become a regular on our menu rotation!

Unnessarily complicated.  Why do we need directions for cooking rice.  The final result is not worth all those measurements.  Just ok for us.

I loved this recipe it was my first time attempting to make it and it came out great, smelled delicious and had amazing flavor. I followed the instruction and added my own choice of vegtables (asian baby corn, zuchinni,carrots, bell peppers,broccoli.) I did a review of the comments before hand and decided to make the changes, I added the sesame oil afterwards used olive oil first, baked the sesame seeds seperate and I added a bit of honey to the broth and cornstarch.

This was pretty good ... great for a lunch box together with Tamaki/Koshihikari rice. I made this twice, once with fresh ginger (grated) and the other time with a poweder ginger.  Needless to say, fresh ginger tastes much better - the whole dish tastes much tangier. But then once in a while when you feel lazy, you can use powdered ginger, it still tastes okay!

I love this recipe and it is my husbands favorite!! It looks harder than it is and once you have cooked it once or twice it gets easier. If you start to cook this and realize you have no cornstarch you can just add a little more sesame seed oil and make it a stir fry!!!!

This was just okay. Did not have the flavorfulness I was expecting! Just a word to the wise, sesame seeds do get old as I did find out. So make sure yours are fresh for the best flavor!

Absolutely fabulous!  We used canola oil and ground ginger, even ground garlic.  We added broccoli and used green peppers instead of red.  Other than looking a little monochromatic, it was perfect.  My young kids devoured it! Thanks for such a great recipe.

This was just okay. I was surprised b/c of all the great reviews. I felt like it needed something else...was good spiciness, but otherwise kind of bland. Maybe I should've doubled all the marinade ingredients and teriyaki sauce? I did use fresh ginger, and also added the sesame oil at the end per other reviews. Probably won't make again. Still looking for the perfect shrimp stir-fry recipe!

Excellent flavor.  I used 1/2 cup rice wine instead of the chicken broth and cornstarch (thank you to the previous reviewer). I omitted the salt and used peanut oil to fry instead of sesame oil.  Be sure to dissolve the cornstarch prior to adding it to the wok.  This would work well with beef or chicken as well.  Yummy!

This was really good.  I made a few changes b/c I didn't have everything on hand.  I added 1/3 tsp ginger and cayenne pepper, 4 cloves garlic, 1/4 cup sweet onion chopped.  I followed other's advice and used canola oil instead of sesame oil.  I did sprinkle a little sesame oil on top at the end.  I used 2 tbs plum sauce and 1 tbs soy sauce instead of teriyaki sauce.  I also added about 1 tsp chili garlic sauce for some extra kick.  I didn't use pepper b/c we don't like them but I did add broccoli.  I cut the cornstarch to 1 heaping tsp and I omitted the salt.  This was great over noodles.

We really liked this recipe.  We used fresh grated ginger instead and amped up the spice a bit with the cayenne and pepper.  I really don't think this recipe needs to be thickened with flour at all...I ended up adding broth to make the sauce less thick in the end.  Just our preference to have a saucy(ish) dish instead.  Everything else was really great!!!

I added carrots and mushrooms and doubled up on the bell pepper.  I also sprinkled more sesame seeds on while cooking everything together.  Served with brown rice.

I've made this so many times, you can use just about any veggies you have on hand. Water Chestnuts are very good in it. I use olive oil but add some shakes of sesame oil for flavor. The broth with the cornstarch and teriyaki make this dish. Serve over white rice.

This was great! I used 1/2 soy sauce in the teriyaki, and added the sauce to the initial marinade. I also added additional vegetables, like baby corn, sliced white onions, and water chestnuts. This is great served with lumpia or Korean Cucumber Salad. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was wonderful! Rarely do I follow a recipe exactly but I did this one and it turned out great. The only thing I might have done a little differently was to use a box of frozen sugar snap peas instead of fresh. I did have everything ready to add ahead of time and I used my timer to cook the ingredients the times suggested. Try it, you won't be disappointed.

This was good. I left out the peppers and subbed carrots in (due to an allergy in the family). I also just estimated the sesame oil and teriyaki sauce, and added a little soy sauce. I used already cooked leftover white rice to make it faster. Good dish, will make again!

The sauce was very tasty, but I will not use the frozen vegetables in the future.  The fresh veggies I used were much better.

this recipe was better than i even expected!  thanks so much for sharing.  instead of rice, i served with lo mein style noodles.  the only other thing i changed was to add some crushed red pepper to make it even spicier (i like spicy!).  i will definitely be making this again, and can't wait to try it with chicken for those in my family allergic to seafood.

Excellent recipe.  I used packaged stir fry vegetables but next time I will chop up my own vegetables as I tend to like the personalized taste of homecooked meals.  This is definitely a keeper.  The only thing I will omit is the chicken broth and cornstarch mixture.

My husband & I really enjoyed this dish.  It was easy and for a stir fry dish, a minimum of chopping was required!  I found the sugar snap peas in the frozen food section of my grocery store.  I did cut the cayenne pepper in half.

This dish was restaurant quality, just amazing! I can't say how difficult it was since it was made for me, but I can say that he's tried other recipes on here and not done so well. We didn't have cornstarch so used a bit of white flour instead to thicken.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  Followed the recipe except I regular oil instead of the sesame (but added a tsp of sesame oil at the very end of cooking for flavor) and also added in some sriracha for some extra heat.  Served over some brown rice.  Yum!

Even though the recipe called for a small amount of cayenne and pepper, it did make it pretty spicy. My husband is from New Orleans and even said it was pretty hot. But, it was very delicious! We will be making this very often.

Perfect amount of heat.  I only made it for two, but the cayenne and sauce was still perfect.  I did not add snow peas, but instead used zucchini and baby Asian corn.  I will make this often.

I can't begin to tell you how good this is. I have made it for several get togethers (quadrupled the recipe) and let me tell you how many rave reviews I have received. I would not change a thing with the recipe, although I marinated overnight. The flavours are intense. This one is so a keeper!

This was ok but not spectacular.  I used 50/50 shrimp and chicken and changed up the vegetagbles some.  The sauce is not the prettiest color...a murky brown color.  It just doesn't make a very attractive looking dish.

OMIGOSH, this is so good!  I halved the recipe because I didn't want too many leftovers as seafood doesn't really do great the next day.  I just finished it for my lunch and it was great.  My alterations:  Brown rice instead of white (takes 2X as long but so much better for you), T fresh ginger instead of ground, double the garlic, sesame seeds and all veggies, saute w/olive oil, add 1 T of sesame oil w/teriyaki sauce and I also shook in about a teaspoon of Emeril's Essence (don't do this if you don't like spicey).

I haven't tried this recipe yet but I do make a ton of stir frys and  noticed some people had a problem with the prep time. If I am in a real hurry I find that there are good quality frozen stir fry veggie mixtures which I use. It cuts prep time significantly. Just a thought.

This recipe was delicious...I followed the directions exactly and then just added more vegetables.  Served it over rice and had leftovers the next day which were even better.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I will be making it again or sure!

Debbie~thanks for a great recipe.  My husband loved this dish.  I couldn't believe how fast it was to make, with such great flavors.  Tasted like I had spent hours in the kitchen.  My daughter-in-law is a vegitarian, I substituted chicken broth with vegetable broth and will triple the recipe next week when we have our family get together.

this recipe provided the base for the dish I made, but I altered to my tastes.
I marinated the shrimp for about 30 minutes and added the teriaki to the marinade, rather than when stir-frying the veggies.  Also added about 1/4 cup of rice wine to the marinade for more authentic taste.  Omitted cornstarch & chick broth at the end because I prefer a thinner sauce.  Used 1/2 a red bell pepper & a pack of frozen snow peas, rather than sugar snaps.  Also added extra red pepper flakes.  It was really good!  Will make it again!  Served over good ol' yellow Vigo rice.  Yum!

This was great!  I really liked the consistency of the sauce, and the sesame seeds / oil gave it a really nice nutty flavor.  The ONLY thing I am going to change for next time is to just use a pinch of the cayenne pepper - it was too spicy for my family with the amount listed.

I made this last night and followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1 clove (because we both love garlic!).  Both my husband & I loved this dish!  It has a kick to it, which was a nice surprise!  When I asked my husband if this was a "keep" recipe or just okay his response was, "definitely make again & often!"...  I totally agree!  Super easy to make!  This is a must try!

Very tasty and not too hot.  I will make it again but would double the sauce.  It was so pasty that I thinned it with a little extra chicken broth.  I will also cut down on the amount of peas and add some carrots.

Smelled and tasted like restaurant quality! Added broccoli - I'm sure many other veggies would taste great in it too.

This was my first ever time cooking shrimp and it turned out excellent.  My husband loved it!  I served it with "Soy and Ginger" Yakisoba noodles instead of rice.

Great recipe!  I also used canola oil and then forgot to add sesame oil, but it still turned out well.  I also added soy sauce to the shrimp marinade, which worked well since I used minced garlic and some of it stuck to the sides of the bag.  Also added broccoli, zucchini, and mushrooms!  A little spicy, but really good!

This is a great str fry recipe, the sauce is very yummy.  I have made it with shrimp and chicken and variety of veggies and it turns out good every time.  I marinate the meat in sesame oil and teriyaki sauce for a few hours before cooking.

I'm not sure why but we didn't think this had a ton of taste. It was fairly easy and quick which was nice. I followed directions except for sauted in vegi oil and added the sesame oil later (1t). I might try it again though. Good use of shrimp

This was pretty good. I only added a sprinkle of cayenne because 1/4 tsp seemed like too much. Even the sprinkle made it spicy enough (and I like spicy food). I also added 2 tbsp of honey to the sauce after it thickened, because I thought it should be a bit sweeter (I used Kikkoman's teriyaki). I'll probably make this again.

My daughter and I loved this.  I made the recipe as given omitting the sugar snap peas and used brown rice.  Excellent!!!!  I am going to try it with chicken. I did add some teriyaki to the marinade and let the shrimp sit for about an hour for lots of flavor.

Not bad. Ours turned out to be tasty although the marinade didn't get through all the shrimp. Some were heavily spiced and some had no flavours at all. I'll try it again and perhaps make double the marinade and see what happens.

The best shrimp stir fry I've ever had! Better than take out.  Try over jasmine rice and adjust spices to taste (can get very spicy if you're not careful) Both my husband and brother in law loved it!

I added some teriyaki to the marinade, and let the shrimp sit for about 8 hours. I pretty much just eyeballed the other ingredients. The end result was very tasty, and it took no time at all to make. Good stuff. Thanks, Debbie!

Amazing although I did make some changes.  You definately need to use the fresh ginger as there is no comparison, second, along with the teriyaki sauce, I added Mirin and soy souce.  I did not use shrimp but chicken instead.  I did not use the peas and red peppers but everything else you can imagine from celery, bamboo shoots, peas, brocolli, pineapples, onions, cashews and carrots. I wanted to make sure I didnt over cook these, so I flash boiled the green peppers, carrots and broccoli and then put them over ice.  When I did the stir fry it only took a second to pull it all together.  Again, make sure you dont cook your meat in the sesame oil, only add it to the marinade... peanut oil was a nice addition. I also put this over rice noodles.... Delish and healthy for the kids!  Thanks!

Whenever my husband compliments a dish, it gets a 5 star rating! He said it was good and light. I did not have green onions or cayenne pepper to add. I used a teriyaki sauce recipe from this site since I didn't have that either! We also added some carrots and substituted pasta for rice. Added the pasta to the wok and let the flavors blend before serving.

Great meal.  Everyone has loved it.  It takes just one pan if you make it with stir fry noodles.  Just mix them in after adding the broth.  If I premeasure everything and cut vegetables beforehand, this great recipe is simple enough to take camping from the car or river.

The spiciness was perfect.  Next time I make it I will either leave out the cornstarch or cut back on it to have a thinner sauce.  I will definitely make this again though...

Super easy and super quick.  My family love it, many went back for seconds and the room was completely quiet for about 5 mins while they basically inhaled the meal.  I also added broccoli because its a favorite around my house!

This was an easy and delicious meal. I realized at the last minute that I didn't have sesame seed oil or rice. I used extra virgin olive oil and linguine noodles (which is an excellent substitute). I also added fresh green beans and peas instead of sugar snap peas. It came out great! My very picky 9 year old loved it and we will be making it again. Perhaps with rice this time.

Turned out good but as a heads up I would recommend cooking with vegetable or olive oil and adding only using 1 tbsp of sesame oil to the veggies when you add the Teriyaki sauce. Any more than one and it will have your stir fry tasting bitter.

My babe loved this!  It will go into our rotation.  I used hoisin sauce, and fresh ginger.  Additionally, I added broccoli and fresh mushrooms.  A winner!

I thought I had snap peas and needed a recipe. I found this one and started making it, but then I realized I had snow peas. I made it anyway. This was really good stuff. I couldn't stop eating it. My daughter doesn't care for shrimp and she liked it too.

Loved this!  I didn't have any red pepper or green onion, so I used a regular white onion and fresh mushrooms.  I put a little sriracha hot chili sauce in the wok.  I also topped my plate off with some sweet chili sauce -- YUM!

This was a yummy dish. Even my 2yr old loved it. Perhaps a hint spicy for me but it doesn't take much to be spicy for me. My husband thought it had just the right kick. All I did different was variety if veggies I used what I had on hand (yellow and red peppers and broccoli). Will make again! Only 4 star because it was missing something..maybe a bit more garlic.

Very good recipe to fool around with - I read the reviews first and followed the recommendation of doubling the sauce - absolutely necessary! Also added the sesame oil at the end using a little more than called for. Used broccoli instead of peppers (don't like them) so doubled the cayenne to make up for that. Also doubled the garlic & ginger for more flavor. Added 2 cans of sliced water chestnuts because we love them. Instead of rice, used 1/2 pound of cooked rice noodles stirred in. The whole family loved it like this!

This went down very well. I added some tahini to the marinade, to really emphasize the sesame taste.

I have made this dish several times, and each time seems to taste better. ( personal changes)
My family and friends have asked me to prepare it again for them. That to me is the sign of a 5 star recipe.

Needs snow peas, NOT sugar snaps.  Sugar snaps are better eaten raw, cooked they are thick and turn out fibrous and terrible even if I string them.  I made the recipe twice as written and the use of sugar snaps ruined it both times.  Third time, I used the thinner podded snow peas, and it was terrific.  I will keep this recipe handy as it's a decent base and easy to modify.  I had no trouble marinating the shrimp with sesame oil, I just did the majority the sauteeing with olive oil and didn't have a problem with the smaller amount of sesame oil overheating.  I also used fresh ginger, and added cashews and shiitake mushrooms.

Kids! I LOVED this recipe. Followed it exactly, just different veggies (red pepper, celery, broccoli). Also used fresh ginger and garlic + veggie broth. Sauteed the veggies with the sesame oil as directed and it was luscious! Loved the extra oomph of the sesame flavor. Will definitely make again!

The dish is delish! I used fresh ginger instead of powdered and added a bit more of the veggies than it called for, definitely would make this again. I agree with other reviews to use the vegetable oil to cook with and to flavour with the sesame oil. I also added a lil bit of extra spice, super yummy!

I used peanut oil to cook with & drizzled the sesame oil over the dish after cooking. I also used more ginger (I grate root from frozen), pre-toasted the sesame seeds, and used Cajun seasoning in place of cayenne . This was yummy!

This was very yummy. I'm a little stinker as far as following recipes properly... I can guess I did double garlic, and double the cornstarch. I made my own makeshift teriyaki sauce with soy sauce and sugar. It's GUUUUD.

This was good but the cornstarch made it way too gummy. Next time I would use a lot less. The only change I made was using soho noodles instead of rice.

Thanks for a great recipe! I've never been a huge teriyaki fan, but teriyaki shrimp sounded good today! I made this with peppered cilantro rice. I didn't have cornstarch or ginger, but i added mushrooms and marinated the shrimp in the teriyaki with the spices. It was pretty spicy...but that could've been my fault. I love crushed red pepper and even added a dash of wasabi. I'm going to be making this again!

This was delicious! I did add some fresh broccoli florets and one chicken breast cubed. My fiancée told me a few times how much he loved it. The next day for lunch when we were out of rice, we put over some plain boiled noodles and it was excellent!

Excellent base to build on. We used shrimp once, chicken the second time and they both work extremely well. Try adding different veggies - asparagus, cauliflower, mushrooms, peppers, broccoli, onions...whatever you happen to have in the fridge seems to work very well with this sauce. Like other reviewers, I doubled everything in the sauce except for the cornstarch so there was more sauce, but not too much glue... To be a little healthier I made brown rice instead of white. The flavor balance is particularly good here. We like a strong sesame oil taste and that's not easy to find in a lot of recipes. This one does not disappoint... it's well worth the effort of cutting up all those veggies!

Amazing!  I omitted the peppers and added mushrooms and bean sprouts.  I also used corn flour instead of corn starch, and it seemed to work fine, but then again I haven't made it with cornstarch.  I am sort of a wimp when it comes to spice, but I loved what the cayenne pepper did for the dish!

This was pretty good. The only thing I added was some crush red pepper to the saute and added come cayenne pepper to the sauce but it still did not have to much of a kick.. but overall its a great base to build on.  Thank you for the recipe

This was really good, but of course like every other cook out there I'd make some changes.  I'd cut back just a smidge on the cayenne and ginger.  I doubled the recipe for lunch leftovers, so 1/2 tsp was a bit much.  I'd maybe use the 1/4 tsp and still double.  I think that shataki mushrooms and water chestnuts would be FAB in this dish.  I put in 3 large cloves of minced garlic, only because I'm a garlic freak!  I also marinated the shrimp with the seasonings and teriyaki sauce.  Very yummy!

Fantastic dish. I had to use frozen sweet peas because I didn't have snap peas but it was still great. My husband gave it a 5 star rating. Will probably use this recipe over and over again.

Delicious! I made alot of changes, mostly because of the different ingredients I had. No sesame oil, so I just used plain old olive oil. Yellow bell pepper instead of red, and soy sauce and a bit of fish sauce instead of teriyaki. Instead of sugar snap peas, I put in carrots. I made a bit of a sauce by adding more soy & fish sauces after putting the shrimp in. It was still very good, although the sauce was a bit salty. I will definitely make this again.

A wonderful base of a recipe. Needs more stir-fry sauce, and it's wonderful that you can add or subtract so many things: bell peppers, onion strips, water chestnuts, carrots...

This recipe was really tasteful and plentiful! I overlooked the quantity of sugar snap peas, so be mindful to put in only 1/2 lbs! The flavor of the shrimp is outstanding with that marinade! It is fun to cook, I use my 12.5" stainless steel fryer and it was fun to flip the veggies and shrimp saute =) Enjoy

This was soooo good. I made it with my cousins one day when we were sitting around doing nothing and we absolutely loved it. It's super easy to make too.

This is fantastic! I omitted the green onions as I didn't have any on hand and it was still great. I also added broccoli. Next time I will experiment with more veggies like mushrooms, asparagus, etc. Will be making again soon!

I was looking for a good stir fry recipe and found this one.  My family loves it so much, I make it atleast ever other week.  I use canola oil and instant brown rice.  I also change up the veggies - less peppers and adding broccoli, mushrooms and zuchini.  I've also tried it with chicken and it's just as good.

My daughter can't have shrimp, so I made this with chicken, cut into bite-sized pieces.  I also doubled the recipe, using 1/2 lb broccoli instead of additional pea pods.  I also used fresh ginger instead of dried.  I probably shouldn't rate a recipe without making it exactly as written, but it came out great anyway.  Served it with brown rice.

Made pretty much as stated except cut down on cayenne pepper and didn't have peas so used broccoli.  Husband loved it.  He said the slight heat from the pepper was nice.

This was wonderful.
I did make a few changes.  I substituted oyster sauce for teriyaki sauce, arrowroot powder for cornstarch, and used safflower oil for the cooking oil.  I added a little sesame oil to the chicken broth (I used low sodium broth).  I also omitted the salt.

I followed the suggestion of others and added the sesame oil the last couple minutes of cooking. Also, added carrots, broccoli and extra cayenne, as my husband likes things spicy. This was very good!

The flavor was good, it was simple to fix and I would make it again, but there was no wow factor to this dish. I used a fresh chicken breast that I had cut into pieces rather than shrimp and I added carrots as well.  I put the chicken in first, then red pepper & carrots, added green onion & snow peas.  All was crisp & had a nice yellowish color, not gray as some others had found.  I did stick to the recipe & used teriyaki (low sodium) and the sesame oil for cooking.  All of that being said, we did both like it and I would make it again.

Good recipe...pretty simple.  Did not have teriaki sauce but used House of Tsang's Sizzling Stir fry sauce as well as fresh garlic in marinade.  Doubled recipe by using pound of chicken (marinated in same bag as shrimp, but picked out the chicken to cook that longer than shrimp)  Also used frozen snow peas and fresh red peppers.  Next time I will try w/fresh ginger...just didn't have any.

This is a very good recipe.  If you live near a Trader Joe's, go to their store and buy the frozen shrimp.  My only mistake was I added too much chicken stock.  Otherwise, the stir fry was very tasty.

I set out to make this recipe from start to finish, but when I realized I didn't have cornstarch on hand, I just used a store-bought stir-fry sauce.  The key each tasty bite is the shrimp marinade! I let my shrimp marinade for a couple hours, and they were the best part of the dish! Will make again, definitely!

This is a great recipe. Even my picky girlfriend loved it. Here is what I did:
For the marinade I omitted the cayenne pepper and added 1 tablespoon of hot sauce. Also I added Teriyaki sauce and sesame oil and let the shrimp sit for 4 hours. This made the shrimp much better than the first time I made this when I used the original recipe only. 
Also, I cooked in canola oil as opposed to sesame oil because of the previous reviews. 
I served with my egg rolls and everyone loved it!

Delicious!  I used half the amount of shrimp, substituted white onion for the green, and frozen stir fry vegetables in place of the peas.  I also toasted the sesame seeds before using.  I omitted the garlic and it was great without it.

Hmmmmm....we did not care for this recipe, and did not like the texture of the cornstarch and chicken broth. Also, the flavor of the chicken broth did not fit at all. I made this because I had all ingredients on hand.

This was good but I made a few changes. I marinated the shrimp for 2 hrs. I didn't have sesame seeds so I used just a bit of sesame oil and used vegetable oil to fry, not crazy about sesame oil. I used frozen stir fry vegs. I sauteed them first for 4 mins, removed from pan, sauteed shrimp & grn onions, returned vegs. to pan and added Terriyaki sauce. I used less chicken broth mix because it was loosing it's flavor but I felt like it needed more sauce for the rice. We had to put soy sauce on while eating just for a little more flavor. Overall a really good recipe.

I give the recipe as-is just 4 stars - BUT, if you take the advice of fellow allrecipe-ers, and add some yummies, like extra garlic, ginger, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, cashews, etc. - this recipe becomes a 5-star!

A true hit. I substituted sesame for peanut oil, ground for fresh ginger, and used red bell, green onion, matchstick-cut carrots and long green beans. The flavor in this recipe is absolutely to die for! Make sure you toast the sesame seeds first to bring out the flavor, and as another reviewer pointed out the cornstarch needs to be fully dissolved in the broth before adding.

Excellent stir-fry recipe!  Like a previous reviewer I used brown rice.  Because my husband and I like food with a bit of a kick I added an extra 1/2 tsp. of cayenne pepper and an extra minced clove of garlic.  A very good meal that is so easy to make!

Good recipe, but it was missing a little ZING. Next time we'll add more garlic. As a rule in this house, 2 cloves of garlic is the MINIMUM you can use in a recipe! :) And I think it was missing a bit of salt. That can be fixed with a bit of soy sauce or even just a bit more salt. Other than that, the cooking time was perfect - veggies were tender yet slightly crisp and the shrimp tender and juicy!

I only made the shrimp part of this meal and mixed it with water chestnuts. Changes I made include less cayenne pepper so it would not be overly spicy and I cooked the shrimp in veg. oil because sesame oil burns easily. I also mixed the dry ingredients up the night before and added a tiny bit of the sesame oil mixed it around and coated the shrimp to marinate it overnight. My family raved about the shrimp and I am sure we will have it again.

I enjoyed this immensely. good flavor, healthy veggies, even liked the sesame seeds.  The one complaint I heard was that it was a bit too spicy and both my husband and daughter were heading for the Tums.  Next time, I would cut the cayenne in half, but  this recipe is a keeper.

Recipe was good, but not great.  I ran into a problem with using the sesame oil because it burned at such a low temperature.  I had to use peanut oil and add sesame oil for flavoring at the end.  I guess I could have cooked it at a lower temperature, but then it wouldn't be a true stir-fry.

Delicious meal that was a hit with everyone.  It's a little spicy, so beware.  Will have this over and over.

It was pretty good. Took me a while to prepare before cooking. I took out the peppers and added baby corn, broccoli, and water chestnuts.

It's very good, but it's NOT quick by any means.  It took me more than 30 minutes to cook.  Other than that it's highly recommended.

Delicious!  I added a few things broccoli, carrots, green pepper, mushrooms and fresh ginger.  I think the next time I will let the shrimp marinade over night to enhance the flavour.  Thanks for sharing!

This was an easy recipe (I chopped veggies the night before) and was very flavorful.  Got rave reviews by my husband and we intend to try same recipe, but substitute chicken. Will definitely be making again.

This was pretty good, I found it a little bit salty even though I didn't add any salt to it, it might have been the teriyaki sauce as I had increased the amount, ok I've made the following changes and I highly recommend those changes:  I added mushrooms and bean sprouts, I substituted powder ginger to fresh ginger (and it makes a huge difference), I also added crabmeat to the shrimp mixture and allowed it to marinate for 1/2 hour before cooking and it was excellent!!  I substituted rice for chow mein.  All in all very very good recipe, the family loved it, will be making again and again!

So good!!  I did alter a few things though -- I made rice noodles instead of rice, and I also added water chestnuts and baby corn (1/2 cup each).  To save time, I chopped everything the night before.  I will definitely make this one again!

I made this recipe as printed except I used toasted sesame oil amd less rice.  It served two healthy appetities with no leftovers.  It was very good, had an attractive presentation, and was pretty healthy.  I only gave it 4 stars because although it was easy, it was definitely NOT a "quick" recipe. It really took a good 45 minutes of active cooking.  While that may not sound like much time to most, after a long day of work it was an eternity!  I will make this dish again, but on my day off.

This was very good. I followed the recipe exactly except I subbed low sodium soy sauce for the teriyaki (this made it more savory than sweet-- we don't care for teriyaki sauce very much), and I used a frozen pea  vegetable mix I had in place of the sugar snaps, which are not in season and were very expensive here. The spiciness was just right, and I love that it stays mostly on the shrimp. I did add a little more cayenne for some more heat. The corn starch glazes up the broth very well, makes plenty (I thought) to go over the rice-- which I did not make very much of. This recipe took me a while to make because I had to peel and devein the shrimp, but had I not had to do that, it would have been quicker. Definitely a thumbs up! I will make this again.

I used a combination of shrimp and scallops and frozen stir-fry veggies (since I knew my kids would eat those more than green onions and red peppers) and it turned out great!  Even my picky 4 year old ate lots!

Great recipe!  Easy and delicious, with just the right amount of spiciness.  I added mushrooms and used soy instead of teriayki sauce, and it was a big hit with my family.  I served it with the Green Salad with Cranberry Vinaigrette found on this site and it was a good match.

Delicious!  We forgot to do the cornstarch and chicken broth bit, and it still was fine, just slightly runnier than it was supposed to be.  Also, I added a little soy sauce (~1T) to the "marinade" to keep the flavors moving around.   Very nice flavor, cayenne added just the right amt of kick!

This was really tasty. I used frozen baby pea pods, reduced amount of the red pepper and perhaps a bit more teriyaki sauce. I served this over bulgar wheat instead of white rice.. more fiber and a slightly nutty taste. I will keep this recipe in my recipe box.. it will be made again soon.

My husband really enjoyed this treat!  The only reason why it wasn't quick for me is because I had to peel and devein the shrimp.  If I had bought them prepared, it probably would have been more of a snap.

I cut the cayenne pepper in half and it was still a tad too hot for my son.  Good flavor.  Put the sesame oil in at the end.  Used vegetables I had at hand including the red pepper.  very good.  will make it again.

Pretty good.  I seasoned my Shrimp with Sesame Oil, Cayenne, Onion & Garlic Powder, Salt, Pepper, Ginger Powder & Red Pepper Flakes.  For the sauce i used Teriyaki, Soy, Sugar, Lemon Juice, Sesame Oil and Rice Wine Vinegar.  Sautéd in Canola Oil  and did add fresh Ginger.  Used a chopped up White Onion and added Broccoli.  It’s a bit goopy, i’d use less cornstarch next time, more Chciken Broth.

Great recipe!  I made some changes based on personal preference.  I toasted the sesame seeds, adds more flavor (my opinion).  I did saute the vegetables & shrimp in sesame oil.   If you keep it on medium heat, it won't burn.  Some reviews said it burns. (???) I used a package of frozen stir fry vegetables.   Everything came out wonderful!   A keeper.

This was really yummy, but I must have gotten a little heavy handed with the cayenne.   Didn’t have snow peas on hand so added French green beans and used red/orange/yellow sweet peppers with brown rice.   Thanks for a solid recipe that allows for substitutions.

We liked it.  Quick and easy.  I didn't have the peas, so I substituted broccoli and shredded cabbage -- the more veggies the better!  Cabbage has a very subtle flavor, and is overpowered by most other things, so it's great in a recipe like this; it adds some texture and crunch, and also healthy fiber, while going unnoticed by people who think they "don't like cabbage!"  I would add a bit extra teriyaki or soy sauce, too.

Made recipe exactly as is except reduced cayenne just a touch as my husband doesn't do spicy well.  This is a great shrimp recipe...healthy and fast on a weeknight.

This turned out great! Used carrots, celery, mushrooms, onions, and red pepper. Rubbed the garlic mixture onto the shrimp without using a bag. Only thing I’d change next time is the amount of cayenne...my kids found it to be a bit spicy. Everyone enjoyed it though!

In general this was a pretty good dish, but the cayenne pepper and black pepper really took over the flavor, so I couldn't really enjoy it.

Fantastic recipe.  We sub’d in fresh ground ginger at almost twice the amount. Added baby corns and sliced water chestnuts, and finished w a little red pepper flake.  We like a kick.  It’s a keeper.

This was delicious. Made as listed but put sesame oil in sauce as recommended by others and used 1 tsp sesame seeds (1 TBS is a lot) and less cayenne  (1/8 was still too spicy for us). I was confused about the marinade step as there is no liquid but I just shook the spices on the shrimp and let it sit then dumped all into the pan. There was plenty of sauce. As a matter of fact, 2 TBS corn starch was probably too much for that amount of broth so I just added more broth. VERY GOOD.

The family loved it.  I added much more Teriyaki sauce than what was called for and added broccoli, celery, and sliced water chestnuts.  A must is to use fresh ginger over ground. I served this over Jasmine rice.

This was very good!  Added additional vegetables to our liking but didn't omit any from the original as the flavors blend wonderfully with the shrimp.   
It served 3 adults with no leftovers.

Delicious! My wife and daughter loved it! Alterations I made: Added yellow and orange bell pepper, as well as the red, keep the appropriate proportions. My wife doesn't care for snap peas, so I substituted green beans and it worked out great. I added a little more teriyaki sauce, maybe 2 or 3 Tablespoons more,  and serve it with noodles instead of rice.

It was ok. I made it just has written and it was "just ok". Next time I will change the sauce in a effort to give it more flavor. Not sure how I will do that yet. I will have to play with this a bit. The base is good. It was the sauce that was lacking. Hubby felt the same way as me.

Very easy and quick to make.  Family liked it but I had to add more teriyaki after I started eating.  I think I just prefer sweeter flavor over sesame nut flavor.   I cooked it in Sesame oil but added the pure black sesame oil at the end of cooking.  The first oil smoked a lot even at medium setting on wok.  If I make again, I will try a different type of oil. Maybe olive or coconut?   I don't usually use vegetable oil.

I doubled the sauce because I like extra on the rice.  It was a little scary putting in 1/4 cup of corn starch!  But it was great.  Only two changes.  Instead of powdered ginger, I used a tablespoon of fresh.  For the cayenne pepper, I substituted three Thai hots.

I took the advise of others started the stir fry with canola oil then added sesame oil at end. Very good but does not reheat well at all.

I really enjoyed making and eating this dish.  I didn't have teriyaki sauce so used soy.  It'll be even better with the teriyaki sauce.  A thumbs up meal.

I have made this twice now. Whole family loves it. Not an easy task! I added 2 cloves of garlic. And didn't use cayenne but instead put Sriracha sauce out on the table for self serve. That added a great heat to it. I think throwing a handful of peanuts at the end could give a nice crunch to it......maybe next time! Thanks for a great recipe I will add to the repertoire!

This was a huge hit with the whole family, I will definitely make it again soon.  I used just a dash of cayenne pepper so it wouldn't be too spicy for my 2 and 4 year old.  I doubled the recipe, but after my husband and 4 year old had seconds, there wasn't much left over!

This was good, but heavily favored saltiness over some more brighter tastes.

One great modification is to add pineapple chunks around the time of the chicken broth. The sweetness helps to cut the strong salt component.

Maybe the saltiness was related to the exact teriyaki sauce I used...

Waaaay too spicy for my liking. Will either reduce or cut out the cayenne all together. It was hard to tell the actual flavour of the meal due to the overwhelming spiciness.  We don't eat a lot of spicy things in our house, so that's probably why we found it so overwhelming.  I THINK the rest tasted fine, but I don't know. I'll give this a second chance, but definitely limiting the cayenne.

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  I did not have any snap peas and so I substituted bok choy which I did have. It added the little crunch that I like. I will definitely be making this again.

Loved it! A bit spicy great flavor sesame oil gives it the Asian flavor. I substituted broccoli florets for the red peppers & didn't have sesame seeds stocked. I used brown rice instead of white. Ill definitely make this again.

Yes, I added French beans instead, and added carrots and broccoli. I used fresh ginger, which enhanced the flavour even more. I also added a tablespoon of Cabernet Sauvignon.

I had to modify with what I had on hand, I used broccoli, peppers and onions. I also used hoison sauce instead of teriyaki and veggie broth in place of chicken. I believe in trying the recipe unadulterated first but I was limited to what I had on hand. This is a great recipe. Thank you for posting it. Next time I'll try fresh ginger and garlic. Delish.

Wonderful recipe for an easy and very tasty dinner.  I use fresh grated ginger, half the cayenne (tried it the first time I made this recipe with the full amount and found it too spicy for my taste so I halved it the second time and it was perfect for me), and I think you can use any veggies you like your stir fry with (I often use broccoli, bell pepper, mushrooms, and green onions).  It's quick, delicious, and relatively healthy--perfect!

A decent, healthy feeling meal. Admittedly I had one change. I didn't have any teriyaki sauce so I subbed some (a lesser amount) of soy sauce. I'd bet it would be even more delish if I made it the way I was supposed to.

The recipe was spot on. Thanks.  I was a little worried about adding salt to the rice preparation but it turned out fine. Since no quantity was mentioned I may have added a bit more than necessary. Everything else was great. The dish turned out fantastic.

nex time I won't use as much chicken broth beCause it was too runny for me. Flavor was awesome.  Be sure to use Teriakya sauce that is of higher quality or better yet, make your own.

loved this.  I used brown rice in place of white, and used soy sauce instead of teriyaki.  I would reduce the cayenne pepper to 1/2, was a bit spicy for me, but my husband loved it.

Really liked this recipe but I did make just a couple of changes. Used fresh ginger and did not use sesame oil as  others recommended. Also doubled the teriyaki sauce since I like extra sauce on my stir fry. And instead  of rice I used Ramen noodles as somebody else had recommended.

Awesome recipe! I did the recipe the same, except instead of cooking it in the sesame oil I did olive oil, I added the sesame oil at the end like suggested. I added yellow peppers, sweet onions and broccoli(I also used more shrimp than requested). It was enjoyed by my whole family!

I did follow exact recipe and steps and felt it was missing something to leave me wanting more even after I was full. It was good, but not great. I'll try again and see if it was just off.

Good recipe. I added a bit of white wine vinegar, fish sauce, soy sauce and oyster sauce, because I didn't have teriyaki. I also marinated the shrimp in the sauce to infuse the flavours more. Turned out really well.

I made this almost exactly like this recipe stated but as I started it ...First of all I didn't use sesame oil I just used olive oil andI decided to add  a couple things.  One I added fresh mushrooms to the saute of the onions and peppers etc.  I also added about 6 rings of pineapple that I  cubed into bite size pieces and added at the time of the marinated shrimp etc.  In the end  it was DELICIOUS !  My husband loved it and said he definitely wanted this in the future !  That said it all !!!

This was delicious! Followed other suggestions and sautéed in olive oil then added some sesame oil at the end. I used brown basmati rice in place of white and did not add salt anywhere in the dish. I also added some broccoli which tasted amazing with this sauce!

It was very yummy. Glad I found this recipe. I decided to mix it up a little and added slices of chicken breast. I like spicy, I didn't have paprika, so I used chili flakes and Siracha to taste. The recipe is pretty flexible so I steamed a bag of Asian stir fried vegetables I had in the freezer and mixed it into the already cooked and sauced shrimp/chicken.

Really delicious! Super filling and a nice change for dinner! I like my food heavily seasoned but if you don't you may find the flavours a bit strong. Either way a great recipe, really easy to substitute different ingredients as well.

I added a little too much cornstarch, forgot the snap peas, subbed sesame oil for olive oil, and I made a marinade of the seasoning(added paprika and cumin), teriyaki, soy sauce, a little bit of vinegar, And marinated the shrimp for what the recipe calls for. Even if the sauce was a little thick cause of the starch it still tasted amazing. Had it over a bed of cumin and black pepper rice:)

Fantastic!  I pan fried strips of skirt steak, marinated just like the shrimp, until they were a little over half cooked.  I added it with the shrimp and peas and the dish came out great!  Spicy?  Yes.  But I'm from Louisiana, so I doubled the cayenne and everyone loved it!  Also, I added a tsp of worcestershire to the beef marinade to allow the seasoning to fully coat the meat.

Like other reviewers suggested, I sauteed my vegetables in regular vegetable oil then put in a little sesame oil towards the end. Other than that I made it as is, and it was GREAT!!!!!!!!

My first attempt was only worth 3 stars.  The marinade spices seemed to need a liquid, maybe soy sauce or rice vinegar.  The cornstarch thickening was too thick.  I will try again with some modifications because with so many good reviews, the recipe seems to have more potential.

It wasn't bad but it wasn't the best either.  I didn't care for the brown murky sauce at the end.  It really took away from the vibrant color of the shrimp and veggies I had in my stir fry.  If I try this recipe again, I'm leaving out the cornstarch and broth mixture at the end completely or I am cutting down on the mixture.  I would prefer a much thinner sauce.

Great, flavorful recipe! Used about 1-1/2 tsp fresh ginger, toasted the sesame seeds and upped the teriyiaki sauce with an additional tbsp.  Did not have sugan snap peas so i used the bok choy I had in the fridge... DH and teenage boys all loved it!!!

I thought this was really good. I used the oil called for and did not find it too strong at all  Used fresh ginger.  Also substituted soy sauce for Teriyaki because I didn't have any.  This was a nice change from the usually stir fry I make and one I will likely make again.  Just use whatever veggies you have on hand.  Also cut up some pineapple at the end.  Nice!

Great stir-fry recipe that can be easily adjusted.  Time saver suggestion - I used Minute Rice microwaveable cups for the rice (ready in 1 minute) I also added mushrooms and rapini to the veggies for more taste.  I didn't have teriyaki sauce so I mixed equal parts soya sauce with Mirin to give the same flavour.  Like others I prefer the grated ginger to ground.  I keep a piece of ginger in my freezer and just grate it over the bowl to add to recipes. Will try this with chicken and tofu for variation from the shrimp.  Loved it !

The timing was all off, so at first my veggies were perfect but my shrimp undercooked.  When the shrimp were done the veggies were mush.

Very good!! I added a bunch more vegetables though (carrots, brocoli, cauliflower and mushrooms).  I made my own teriyaki sauce and put much much more than the recipe said however (almost 3 times more) and it tasted great.  I also had to use about double the cornstarch because I found the sauce was too liquid.  Everyone really like it!!

I've never been satisfied with my attempts at stirfry -- something always seems to be missing from the overall flavor.  I was doubtful that the marinade in this recipe would be anything special, but WOW!  I loved it! I made it the first time with shrimp, but I've also used chicken with the same great results.  I will almost certainly rely on this blend of seasonings as my new stirfry standby. I adjust the veggies according to what I have on hand or find on sale at the store, and I'm always happy with it.  I took the advice of other reviewers and used canola oil for the cooking and sprinkled on a little sesame oil at the end for the flavor.

Loved this. Only things I did differently was cook in Canola oil and add only a pinch of cayenne pepper (personal choice). Very easy, and very tasty.

Amazing! I doubled the garlic and ginger, which made it spicy, and it was incredible. As others suggested, added 2 tsp. sesame oil at the end, and sprinkled with extra toasted sesame seeds.

I read several reviews, so I modified the recipe.  I was making a half portion, but used the same amount of marinade mix (which means I doubled it except for the garlic). I toasted the sesame seeds and added 1/4 teasp. of wasabi powder to the mix. I let the shrimp marinate for an hour+ in the fridge. I also used the full amount of sauce (which means I doubled it).  As others suggested, I used canola oil to cook, then added a teasp. of sesami oil at the end.  This is a great, quick, spicy dish.

Really liked this one. Didn't have any sesame seeds and I think it needs them for a little more flavor. Going to get some and add them next time. Someone said there wasn't enough sauce, I disagree. I doubled it because of that comment and then had too much. Thanks!

I used frozen stir fry veggies, would have been better with fresh.  Overall very good, but did need a little more flavor for my palate.  I think I'll try fresh ginger and a little more garlic next time.

I doubled the sauce and omitted the oil (always trying to save calories) and found this to be quite delicious. For veggies, i used fresh brocolli, the sugar snap peas, sweet onion and mushrooms. Also, I used fresh ginger root. This stir fry has a nice bite and i love the sesame seeds. Im sure they would be better toasted but i was too lazy!

Super Yummy.  Tamed it down a bit for little ones, but added red pepper flakes for the hubby.  Used brown rice.  Also didn’t like the dry marinade so added just a touch of teriyaki and fresh lime juice as suggested by someone else.  Wanted a heartier meal so added chicken at first and shrimp later after the chicken had some time to cook.  Excellent flavor and filling!  Will make again most definitely.

Good, easy recipe.  I was a little surprised the shrimp marinade did not call for any liquid.  Added a little lime juice and teriyaki just to be safe.  Also, used brown rice, and fried the rice after the shrimp dish was ready.  We will make again.

Yum, yum, yummy!  Made this tonight with my boyfriend.  Since I'm not a chef, I'm not sure why some said not to cook with the sesame oil, but it was expensive - so I used it!  I used fresh ginger and am very glad I did.  We sprinkled extra sesame seeds on top and will use more green onion next time.

I will definitely make this again.

The five stars goes to the resulting sauce!  My 'personal touches' included: using fresh ginger, canola oil instead of sesame oil in the wok, soya sauce & honey instead of teriyaki sauce (I don't usually have it on hand), vegetable broth instead of chicken, and my own usual stir fry veges mix.  It wasn't too spicy for my kids (5 & 2) either.

Very spicy, I agree with another taste tester. 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne would be better for my taste. Otherwise we really liked it.

Pretty good.  I used cayenne instead of tobasco because that's all I had.

This recipe was ok.  It's very spicy, I recommend using less cayenne pepper maybe an 1/8 teaspoon would be fine if you like spicy.  1/4 teaspoon is too spicy.  It would be better to use proper asian sauces and spices for stir fry.

i thought this was bland.  the chicken broth made it very salty and it was just lacking in flavor. im giving it 2 stars since it was quick and easy and adding siracha sauce made somewhat better.

I'm afraid this is my first bad review of a recipe.  I followed it very closely.  Did not care for the gravy at the end.  Also, the vegtables were too cooked, not crisp.  We will not be makeing this again.

This recipe was very good.  Not perfect which is why only a 4 star.  I made it with fried rice and it was a hit.  Lots of compliments.  Will definately make again as it was quite easy.

My husband loved this, but though I liked it, I expected it to have more of a stir fry flavor and it really didn't. I added mushrooms and carrots and enjoyed it with the extra veggies.  I will make this again, it just wasn't what I was expecting.

We liked this a lot.  I had to make a few substitutions with what I had on hand:  frozen stir fry veggies in lieu of snap peas and honey instead of teriyaki sauce.  (I think the teriyaki would have been more flavorful).  All in all it had a nice kick, and we liked it a lot!

I liked this recipe, I did add Water Chestnuts, bean sprouts, more garlic and Fresh ginger. I cooked the veggies in Vegetable oil, and marinated the shrimp with a little sesame seed oil and teriyaki sauce for an hour, once I cooked the veggies I added the shrimp and threw in the rest of the sesame seed oil and teriyaki sauce, also instead of broth I used Sake.

Just enough kick from the spices to make the dish lively without being too spicy (I don't like a hot spicy flavor).  I didn't have any cornstarch, and that didn't affect the recipe at all IMO.  And I used vege oil rather than seasame oil - still good.  I used Bird's Eye SnapPea Stir-Fry frozen veges in place of just the sugar snap peas, which was great b/c it easily added a few more veges like carrots, onions, and mushrooms.  And I too used a little more teriyaki sauce as others suggested.  My husband liked it, especially with his soy sauce on top.  Thanks!

Made as directed, except for using coen oil for stir-frying instead of the sesame oil. Instead, I added 1 tsp of the sesame oil to the marinade for extra flavor. Also, cubed tofu goes very well with this sauce. Thank you for posting.

We really liked this one.  I have recommended this to several friends.  There is only one thing I would change: I don't really care for spicy foods, so I am going to leave out the cayenne pepper next time I make this.  Other than that it is great - and easy, too!

This is a really good dish. Simply but very tasty. I'd used real ginger as well as the ground up ginger...added some more teriaki sauce. I didn't sugar snaps so I'd just used snow peas. 
I will definitely make this dish again.

This dish was o.k. I'll probably make again for something quick and easy. The only thing that I would change would be to use freshly grated ginger instead of ground to give it more of a ginger-y flavor. I'm usually not a sauteed pepper eater, but the sauce gave these a great flavor (I cooked until soft).

I made this recipe using snow peas and lots of freshly grated ginger. I omitted the red bell pepper. For the marinade I added a little soy sauce in the bag. I also added more chili flakes for extra spiciness. This recipe was so easy and quick to prepare.  It was delicious!!  YUMMY!!

Great recipe. It is spicy but that's how we like it. I'd say 2 chili peppers on a scale of 1 to 3. Added the 1/2 cup rice wine and some mushrooms.Also increased the cornstarch a bit. Very good!

Very tasty. It loses a star for kid friendly because of the spiciness. I would probably take off two stars for the spiciness, except my kids like spicy food. We also used fresh ginger rather than ground ginger.
