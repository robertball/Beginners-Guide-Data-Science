This was very good and satisfied my friends who are gluten free. Just note that because it is yogurt based, it will liquify when at room temperature, so it was best to eat just after it was removed from the freezer.

This is so good!! I put mine a little too thick so it was more on a freezy kind of yogurt but still so good. For my toppings I used walnuts and dried cranberries and also doubled the amount of vanilla extract. I'm so making this over and over again.

Will not make again unless I put some sugar in it.  It was too tart tasting, and not sweet at all.

This is great stuff! I saw this recipe by chance and thought "How neat is this? I'm gonna make some!"  I just finished putting it together and made a flat space in the freezer for the baking pan. I love how this can be done a million different ways. Thanx for posting!!!

Very yummy, though like others have said it does get soft rather quickly. I used chopped dried mangoes, pistachios, dark chocolate chunks, and coconut flakes. Delish!

This was amazing, great for clean eating too! Only thing I did was that I replaced the syrup with honey and I put no nuts in it. It was sooo good!
