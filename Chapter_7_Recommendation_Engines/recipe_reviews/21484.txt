Huge hit with the kids. I used all organic ingredients where I could, whole grain bread and I served it with homemade maple-vanilla syrup. The kids thought this was out of sight. Like it was Christmas morning. It really was cute. NOTE: I did add a little milk to the egg dip.

This is so easy to make and yummy.  I've made it many times and sometimes for overnight guests too.  Everyone was surprised to learn how simple it is.  Make sure you use the softest of bread for this.  (I only use half the butter and it's more than enough)

Yummy! This recipe is such a great idea. I used wheat bread and also added a dash of cinnamon to the egg mixture. This is very rich so be warned -- if you really want to indulge yourself or your kids add a few chocolate chips inbetween the banana slices. I'm sure I'll make this again, but probably not for a while because it is so very rich.  But it does add some nutritional value to plain old French toast with syrup.

Peanut butter and bananas are a great combination, but sandwich them between french toast and you have a warm gooey treat for breakfast! I love peanut butter and any new way of eating it -I'll try it! I was a bit liberal with the vanilla and added a little milk, sugar, cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter. I just eyeballed the ingredients, because I've been making french toast for years! Overall, this was very good especially dusted with confectioners' sugar and drizzled with a little maple syrup!

I absolutely love this! I have always ever since I was little, spread my pancakes and french toast with peanut butter before drenching them in syrup. So many people turn up their nose at the thought of peanut butter on these type of breakfast foods, but when I have gotten anyone to agree to try it, they have liked it more than they thought they would. This recipe is just a better version for me. I am so glad that I found it. Thanks!

This was very yummy! A treat for anytime! Great for kids and adults alike.  I used cinnamon and nutmeg in the batter this time and it was good. I'll try vanilla next time. Thanks!

YUM!!! As a kid, I would eat toasted bread, spread with pb and drizzled with syrup. Wish I knew about this one! This is awesome! My picky toddler even loved it. It's a great nutritious treat to start the day off with.

I made this because I was out of milk and craving FT. It wasn't as good as I hoped. I love PB on my FT, but the best part of that is when the PB mixes with the maple syrup. So it wasn't quite the same. 3 stars for simplicity and a good idea.

I ave two ratings for this recipe, if your feeding adults, I give it only a 3 star, it was ok. But if your making this for only children, then I'd rate it higher, for its a combo they love, and they can help make it.

Wow!  This is so simple yet so tasty.  I used all natural peanut butter and it was excellent.  However, I would suggest using non-salted butter.

I left out the banana.  This was a nice change from plain french toast.  I think I may make it once in a while for a change.

I was really skeptical about putting it together like a sandwich and then dipping it into the egg mixture.(I had no extra bread if I messed up.)I was afraid if some of the egg mixture got in between the slices it would not cook through and I didn't want raw egg mixture in my PB and bananas.
  I took the advice from past reviewers, and I cooked the F.T. individually. Then put the PB & bananas on and smooshed it together gently. 
  Topped w/t confectioners sugar and 2 Banana slices on top to garnish. I liked it as is, other family members liked it with syrup on also.
  Surprisingly this turned out to be a really good twist on your everyday FT.
  I only rated it 4 stars, b/c it was not "a blow me out of this world," "got to have more tomorrow kind of dish."
  But this is a keeper, Will make again.

    Thanks for a new F.T. twist !!

My thirteen year old daughter gave this a five star rating. She loved it! I had the cream cheese and jam stuffed F.T., (a recipe from this site) and I made my husband breakfast sausage patty stuffed french toast with just a drizzle of syrup and a fried egg on top. Not only was the french toast stuffed, but so were we! Yum.......thanks!

Tried this a week ago. My son is a banana fanatic so he's constantly wanting that "banana bread" now. I usually put syrup on my FT but it tasted a bit odd with the banana. But as for the recipe itself, very good for kids in the morning!

Not enough egg to cover the bread as written. Much better with egg mixed with a splash of milk (and the vanilla) and BOTH sides of each slice cooked, then adding the peanut butter and the banana after cooking; then assemble. Also, we only needed 1/2 small banana for each set. No need to add more butter after cooking. With these changes, 3-1/2 stars.

This is a great recipe for those who want a fast, nutritious breakfast fast or is looking for a great breakfast on the go.  I added some cinnamon to the egg mixture to give it the true taste of french toast!  It's so moist, you don't even needs butter or syrup...just a little milk to wash it down.

Very easy and delicious. Didn't even need to add maple syrup or powdered sugar on top. It was perfect without them. I added a bit of pumpkin spices (McCormick's Pumpkin Pie Spice: cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, & ginger) to the egg & vanilla mixture for a bit more flavour. I also used Trader Joe's organic crunchy peanut butter which has a bit of sea salt so it was a perfect blend of sweet banana & salty peanut butter wrapped with the french toasted bread. Just yummy.

I had really high hopes for this recipe, but after making a batch for my girlfriend and I we were left a little dissapointed. 

We followed the recipe exactly as it was presented, and found that the French Toast basically came out tasting like a regular PB&Banana sandwich. We could barely tell that there was french toast mix at all, the only thing that made it taste anything different from a regular sandwich is that it was warmed up. It's not that they tasted *bad*, but they certainly weren't worth the effort we put into making them.


Honestly I think I would have preferred just making regular french toast. It was a nice idea, but didn't win me over enough to ever make them again :(

I'm not sure how I feel about this. I've made it twice now, and both times it's been yummy but I haven't found it to be my favorite breakfast item. I love how easy it is to throw together & it's great when you want something a bit different. I imagine I'll experiment with different items & see how they turn out. Definitely worth tasting though!

Very tasty.    I don't use vanilla and also have tried making peanut butter/ jam sandwiches and dipping in the eggs. Tasty as well.    You can use maple syrup but not necessary. Just great with glass of milk.

This was my first attempt at this recipe, and although it was certainly a delicious breakfast good, I do think that with some slight variations, this recipe would turn out even better. First off, I only had Pepperidge Farm's Cinnamon bread, so I used that and I used crunchy PB (only thing I had). There was only a medium banana for me at hand, and I tried to cut it up a bit too thick, I think, because the "sandwich" looked very bulky when I cooked it. I will try to use a smaller banana and cut it up a bit more thinly next time. Also, I used 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract and a dash of cinnamon, like other reviewers suggested, so that added much more flavor to the egg. But this was still an enjoyable breakfast food and I will try it again!

Hmmm...perhaps it's just me, but I only found it ok.  I didn't use any syrup or powdered sugar (how I had french toast growing up), so maybe that would've helped.  I do think that 2 tbsp of melted butter to cook it in is WAY too much - made it too greasy fo me.  I might try it again, tho.

It was not as good as I thought it would be.  There's  nothing wrong with the recipe .  Plain french toast with a little syrup would be as good or even better.

3 stars as is. 4 stars if the toast is made before putting the peanut butter and bananas on.

Fun and easy to make, I used cinnamon instead of vanilla and it tasted wonderful. Although don't soak too long or the bread inside will get soggy :/

You can't get better.  It just doesn't, unless you put some sort of homemade chocolate syrup or frosting on this.  I make, eat, these or any number of version of these all the time.  We add any/everything to our pancakes/waffles/frenchtoast.  Peanut butter with anything is awesome in my book.

was ok...but I think maybe make regular french toast then make a mix of the PB and Banana's and maybe cream cheese to make a filling to put between pieces already cooked on both sides...it was a little mushy this way.

Genius! I love that you can put your own twist on this recipe, like using whole wheat toast or even taking it a step further and using banana bread slices instead of toast! This recipe is so easy that I just glanced at it and went in the kitchen and made it without having to look at the recipe again. My daughters loved it too!

My son says this is the best! Very tasty served with Maple syrup. Reminds me of the Elvis Grilled PB and Banana Sandwich with a French kick. We will be making this one again and again. Thanks Bon for the recipe.

good, enjoyed it. tried one with pb, one with nutella, and one with pb and nutella and split the sandwiches umong the three of us. I think i preferred the nutella/pb, my 9 yr old, liked the pb only, and my husband was undecided. Glad I tried it, but the likelyhood of me making it again is not good, i guess because it's more like a breakfast treat than a normal rotation breakfast.

Pretty good. Next time I will add more peanut butter and less bananas. Also, I added nutella, which was incredible but cancelled out the peanut butter taste. It tasted between a grilled cheese and french toast--maybe need more egg mix coating.

Made these this morning for Sunday breakfast. A nice variation on French toast.  I can see why some reviewers said it was a bit too sweet. Not over the top sweet though.  I did add some cinnamon sugar to the egg mixture.  Oh and I used some milk too.

This was so easy!  My boys already love peanut butter and banana sandwiches so it was a big hit at my house.  My husband complained that it made the peanut butter too runny, but overall it was a hit! I will be making this often.

WOW!!!!!!!!!  This was soooooo  delicious!!!!!!!  I did add some milk and  cinnamon to step one.  One egg was just right.  Cut the butter down to 1 tablespoon, 2 would have been to much, in my opinion.  We used whole wheat bread.  HIHGLY RECOMMEND if you want a special breakfast:)  Thanks so much Bon, for posting.

This was good. I didn't have any vanilla so I used cinnamon and nutmeg. I added oven crisp bacon for a little something extra. I only used half the bannana, thinly sliced so as not to over power...It was good, and I will try it again with the vanilla and some powdered sugar.

While snowed in this weekend in DC I made this for my husband and myself.  We LOVED it.  I did not measure just put a coating of PB on the bread and sliced the banana thin, the long way till it covered the bread. I also added a little cinnamon and sugar mix to the egg and also sprinkled some on the banana.  I then put about four small round slices of banana on top and then some 'sifted' conf. sugar on top to dress it up.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks.

The kids really loved this one! My fiance and I were not a huge fan of the bananas so we left those out of ours but did include them in the kids'. Such a great taste with the peanut butter, french toast, and warm syrup. This has become a saturday morning favorite at our house and the kids love to help make them!

Super easy and my kids loved it!  I made breakfast for dinner tonight and this was easy and fast.  I used crunchy peanut butter, and 1 1/2 bananas sliced thin. I also drizzled a little honey before closing the sandwich and pressed down on the bread slightly before dipping it in the egg.  I used two eggs, a little milk, and some vanilla for 3 sandwiches.  Served it with maple syrup and the kids had milk to go along with it.  Great!

Delicious! The only thing I did differently was to make the French toast first, and then spread it with pb and add the banana slices - it's just easier, plus the eggy bread cooks all the way through. Husband added some honey. I think it might be nice with a little cinnamon too. Thanks, Bon!

Every kid, from age one to one hundred and one will just love this combo!! As per another reviewer's subtle advice, I added a few chocolate chips. My daughter Tyler, who's seventeen, developed a peanut allergy only two years ago. Instead of peanut butter, I used her "soy butter", which tastes remarkably similar to PB. This product is somewhat new to the Northeast area and we were thrilled to find it. Schools even consider this to be allergy safe. My sweet pea loved this and I thank you so much for submitting it!!

Great idea! Very yummy and filling! I only used 1 tbls. of butter and it did just fine! Also, you must have maple syrup to go with it! Delicious! Be sure to warm up your maple syrup too! Thanks for the recipe!

All I have to say is that my 6 year daughter refused syrop because she said the toast was 'tasty enough'!  I was shocked, as she has a huge sweet-tooth!  I also added cinnamon.

This was absolutely delicious! I didn't have vanilla that morning, but had almond extract. My 2 year old went crazy and so did the rest of us! Will be making this on many weekends to come. Thanks for sharing!

Made this last weekend at the Giant's game and it was a huge hit. I added a few chocolate morsels in between the bread and warmed up some real maple syrup. My wife has a secret concoction that she uses for baking that I sprinkled on top...cinnamon and cocoa powder. Make this ASAP!

I changed it. Instead of coating each side, I only did the opposite side of the peanut butter. Very good, even though I burned mine on accident. I used the "Sarah's Applesauce" Recipe as my side dish, which complemented this dish very well. :) Will continue to make forever!

I give this a two because my husband and I just thought it was way too much. I love bananas and it was too much. I ended up taking off the banana and finishing it. And then made just regular french toast and was much more pleased. Sorry just wasn't for us.

My 7 year old asked if she could have this every morning for breakfast! That won't be happening, but I'm sure I'll make it again...Maybe in the summertime when she's more apt to working off all the extra calories!

Delicious!! It was a hit with my son as well and I loved it myself. I'll definitely be making this again. Plus, it gives me something to make besides banana bread with my over ripe bananas.

Awesome. Made some with peanut butter for my daughter and me and some with just banana for my husband and parents who don't care for peanut butter. Either way it was loved by all.

fantastic! This was amazing. I can't even begin to tell you how good. I used only egg whites and didn't beat too thoroughly so that it was basically like a fried egg was on top of the bread...topped with maple syrup. Yum!!

Amazing recipe! I once saw this one on TV and this has been one of my all time favorites! I recommend this to anyone for breakfast,brunch or intra-meal snack. The only thing that I have added from myself is cinnamon.Enjoy!

I made this for my kids this morning and even my picky eater scarfed this down.  Only thing I did differently was add Apple Pie Spice to the egg and vanilla mixture and I topped with powdered sugar.

This was pretty good. It definitely needs the sprinkle of powdered sugar for an extra kick. I think next time I will toast the side of the bread that the PB goes on. It was just a little to mushy for me. My oldest thought it was good, my littlest wouldn't try it (doesn't like banana).

My children loved this recipe they ate two of them, I put strawberry's in mine and it was good my daughter told me it was "awesome".  So they all approved of it I would make it again.  I was afraid that it would fall apart but it didn't.

We had mixed reviews in our family.  One loved it, two thought it was just okay, and one didn't like it at all.  The mushy banana texture was a turn off.

So delicious!  We added a sprinkling of semi-sweet chocolate chips and used fresh whole grain bread from the bakery.  We used coconut oil to fry it instead of butter, as it's healthier (good fats and doesn't become a carcinogen at high heats) and it imparted a very minimal but lovely flavor.  This was delicious, filling, and not terribly unhealthy.  I'm definitely going to make it often!

Overall, this was just mediocre. After awhile it was just plain annoying to eat. I used whole wheat flaxseed bread since I don't eat any white refined grains, and this bread works well with all the other FT recipes I've used, but not so much for this one. I added some cinnamon to this, used red bananas and used all-natural smooth peanut butter. There didn't seem to be enough egg to coat everything, maybe my bread was too big for this. If I am feeling daring again, I'll try this with some more spices and less peanut butter. I think this was just too big to eat as well, maybe I'll mash the bananas next time. Something with this recipe just didn't "feel right", I'll see if I can figure out what it is, good idea though.

This seems like a tribute to Elvis! Oh so good. Gave it one star less because I felt like I needed to add a dash of milk to the egg mixture to help it soak into the bread a little better. Served it with icing sugar and a drizzle of maple syrup.

I made this today and I have to say that my hubby and I haven't had anything as rich and sweet as this since our last trip to Disneyworld. I didn't change anything. I will say that I used thick sliced cinnamon raisin bread from Panera. If you do this I advise either getting it sliced regular or cutting a thick slice in 1/2 because it makes a big meal using 2 slices. We each only got through 1/2 of ours. Per other reviews I added cinnamon and nutmeg with a bit of milk to the egg mixture. Also, if you have an electric griddle I suggest using it for this recipe.

I was looking for a sweet night time snack, this wasn't it. I like peanut butter & banana sandwiches.... I didn't really care for the Peanut Butter and Banana French Toast though. Maybe my expectations were too high seeing how all the rest rated it five stars. I must say that I did however eat three fourths of it.

These are very rich and very good.  My 1 year old loves to eat them plain like a sandwich.  At least I know that she is getting fruit, protein, bread, and dairy in her diet with this meal.

I made this with all natural Smuckers peanut butter.  I'm not fond of natural peanut butter but it's what we had in the house.  I also don't like bananas that much.  That being said, I thought the combo was amazing.  It tasted really good and the buttery french toast was perfect.  Maybe if I don't mind getting ultrra fat, I'll consider making it with chocolate chips in there too next time :) maybe some marshmallow fluff too :).

Made it for my teenagers, not for me. They said it was good and gave it 4 stars. I tried it also and thought it was a bit different for a breakfast dish, but OK, if not a bit sweet for my taste. I followed other reviewers suggestions about cooking the French toast first and then add the rest, which worked out well. Not something we'd have every day, but OK for a weekend occasional breakfast.

Honestly I don’t think I can ever eat plain french toast again. I was pretty liberal with the vanilla, added cinnamon and milk. Eyeballed the amounts. Made the french toast first and then added peanut butter and banana slices. I topped it with a dollop of cool whip and two banana slices.

This was so good, I’ve made it several Time time since I found the recipe.  The only reason I’m not giving it 5 star is because I had to add other ingredients to give more French toast taste as well as for flavor.  I added cinnamon, and a little bit of milk to the eggs as well as the vanilla accent and touch of sugar.  My husband love this and asked for it all the time, this will be on my breakfast rotations going forward.

I probably won't make it again...it was just okay, but it did give me an idea for putting things in French toast, so I may try other fillers.  The peanut butter worked but the bananas just didn't add enough sweetness.  Something missing. I have to think about it.  I love the concept.

This was very tasty and easy to make. I'll definitely make it again. I'm following the Weight Watchers plan, so, I used dry peanut butter called PB2 and lite multi-grain bread and egg whites. This reduced the fat content greatly. And it was still very good!

Delicious... I did do a more traditional french toast batter, I'm not big on eggy french toast. Check out Chef John's french toast recipe on here, combine it with this and you've hit a home run.

However I did use cinnamon spice, a little icing sugar and milk instead of the vanilla extract.  The kids loved it and it wasn't difficult to make either.

5.5.17   I knew I'd like this because banana and peanut butter is a winning combination.  My banana was very soft, and I think I'd have liked it even more with a  firmer banana, but then, when they're super ripe, that sweet banana flavor really pops.  The heat just softens that peanut butter, and it oozes out of the french toast.  Didn't drizzle syrup over it or sprinkle with confectioner's sugar, just devoured it once it came off of the griddle!

Made with peanut butter on just one side of the bread, whole wheat bread, and left out adding any sugar or syrup on top. A much more satisfying breakfast than your standard french toast and one I feel better about eating and letting my family eat. Will make again! :)

I don't even like peanut butter and I force myself to eat bananas, but I thought this tasted exceptionally well. Delicious. Kids didn't eat it unfortunately, but all the adults I served this to asked for seconds. Make sure you cover it in maple syrup tough, otherwise bread might be a little dry with just the egg mixture. Use just a little bit of peanut butter, a thin layer on the bread. And slice the banana very thinly. Great recipe.

Delicious!!   My 2 year old loved it, too!  I made these for our breakfast.   You can't go wrong with using different portion sizes.  I cut back on the banana and margarine.  I layered thin banana slices over the sandwiches, therefore one large banana was enough for 3.  Since I'm watching calories, I weighed all my ingredients.  My sandwich: whole grain bread, 33g banana, 30g peanut butter, 15g margarine, egg and vanilla  = 512 cal, 23g protein, 46g carbs, 30g fat, 8g fiber  The perfect fuel right before a workout!

I made it with one variation: cashew butter instead of peanut butter. But French toast is French toast, and it's still good.

I actually made my version with gluten free cinnamon raisin bread. Also I dipped the bread into the egg mixture and grilled it a little first before adding the peanut butter and banana then dipped it again and grilled it on all sides until nice and toasty! Had it with a little bit of sugar free syrup which was absolutely delicious, gooey and warm and the raisins with the bananas were fantastic. The reason why I only gave it 4 stars is because I like my version better than the recipe version. The only way this could possibly be better is if you made some bacon and put that in with the bananas and peanut butter! That would be mega awesome!

This was really good, and  it was very  filling .   Served it with some home fries and bacon which were nice sides to help cut through the richness.

My man loved it, at the same time he loves junk food.  For me, I didn't like it that much.  It would be good for desert but not for breakie

Yes, I will make it again. I have to get some syrup so I only topped it with power sugar. I definitely 5hink you need Natural peanut butter with no added sugar as the toppings make up the difference in flavor.

A fun twist for the family. Kids loved it!!  Use only thin layers of peanut butter otherwise it can overwhelm it.

I was puzzled by the unnecessarily complicated instructions. Should have been:  make PB&B sandwich, dip in egg/vanilla mixture, autéed in 1 tbsp butter til golden brown, the end!
I didn't pour syrup on mine hoping to reduce calories but it was my loss.  Syrup is a must.  Will make again.

I would make it again, I would just add a little less peanut butter because with the syrup and peanut butter it was too much for me. My toddler loved it (minus the bananas) and you definitely need more egg mixture if you want to cover both sides.

This was very delicious!  I used just a pinch of cinnamon in my french toast mixture and used a little bit of half & half instead of milk.  I like PB, banana & honey sandwiches, so I might add the honey next time too.

I can't get this to work, I've tried several different variations as well as the original but the whole sandwich never cooks through!!! It's always raw in the middle and if it's not raw the outsides are burned to a crisp from having to cook so long!!

Im living abroad with few ingredients available to me. This recipe is simple and delicious. I added a splash of milk because I was afraid it would taste too much like egg and a teaspoon of cinnamon sugar to the batter. It was creamy and amazing. Will make it again and again. Thanks for sharing!

I used hazelnut spread and thinly sliced the banana. Doubled the recipe an did add milk (my usual recipe).  Cooked over medium-low heat and the toast was cooked through perfectly. Easy on the syrup as the spread is very sweet.  Enjoyed it with cold milk.

It is very good topped with confectioners sugar, cinnamon, and maple syrup. The only issue I have had with this recipe -I've made it many times- was that the egg just turned into scrambled eggs so you have to watch it very careful and cut of any parts that were cooked with scrambled egg on it. Besides that this is a VERY simple and delicious breakfast plate.

I substituted Nutella in for the peanut butter and it made this dish absolutely amazing.  I made it for the first time as breakfast on Thanksgiving and it was my husband's favorite food of the day.  He now begs me to make it.  I would like to try a nutella/strawberry combo.

Kids fav.  I added  a t of sugar to the egg, pinch of salt too and some Cinnamon.  Also to move away from the total mush factor I used super crunch Jif peanut butter. Also, used a drizzle of honey instead of the usual maple syrup, with a nod to Elvis for the inspiration.  Hunka chunka burnin' ...

So I made this recipe because I seen it on the main page, and have also seen cooks cooking it on tfv lately. So I tried it out....its O.K. Nothing special. For me it's alittle THIIIIICK. You wouldn't wanna eat this without a drink. Other than that its a different spin on french toast.

Made it this morning and got thumbs up from my 7 and 3 year old. Split one sandwich between them and cut 3 year old's up. 7 year old wanted to cut it himself (independent stage) and it was a mess. I gave him another half and he asked just to dip it in syrup- worked much better.

This was a quick recipe to jazz up simple french toast and change it up a bit.  The kids loved it!  My daughter actually grabbed one and chomped on it as if a sandwich, no syrup necessary for her.  Only addition I made was to add about 3 Tablespoons of milk to the egg and vanilla extract blend and I followed the advice in the reviews and added a touch of cinnamon.

Bobby Flay reviewed a very similar recipe made at a restaurant in San Diego. They added a couple tablespoons of rum(an inexpensive one) to the egg mixture. They also used day old wheat bread.

My significant other loves peanut butter. I omitted the banana for his and he loved it! The peanut butter idea turned out to be such a tasty addition to this classic and terrific recipe.

Good, rich, a little salty.  I took the suggestion of adding cinnamon to the egg mixture (good suggestion) and adding chocolate chips with the bananas both were great suggestions that I recommend as well.  Next time I'm going to cut the butter in half or use an alternative.

Great recipe! I burnt it because I didn't realize how quickly it would brown up, but it should be better for next time.  I didn't have any vanilla on hand, so I used some hazelnut powder instead, which added an extra nutty flavor.

When I think french toast, I think sweet, syrupy, messy deliciousness.  The texture of french toast was there, but the bread was very bland.  I would describe it as just a grilled peanut butter and banana sandwich. If I choose to make these again, I may add cinnamon, syrup, and powdered sugar. Be aware that the serving recorded is for 2 people, but that only makes up 1 sandwich.  On a side note, the house now smells really good!

My kids loved this!!!  I liked the fact that they were also getting some protein from the peanut butter and fruit from the banana.  These cooked up beautifully and the middle was done perfectly.  Will for sure be keeping this recipe handy and we will be having it again.

This is such a unique yet simple  twist on french toast that I HAD to try it!  My hubby and I found the banana flavor overpowering (and I like pb & banana together), so I think next time I will experiment with pb&j or just peanut butter, or try Nutella.  Thanks for sharing this fun recipe!

I made this for breakfast today and it was amazing. I added milk and cinnamon-sugar to the egg batter (something I do with regular french toast) and used honey-roasted peanut butter.

I have made this for years as a birthday morning treat for each of my kids. Although, I don't add the bananas inside but put them on the top and then add the syrup. It is just different enough and sweet enough (especially with powdered sugar on top) to make them feel like they are getting a special treat before they head of to school. One year my teenager was running late for school and didn't have time to eat it and later said it didn't feel like his birthday without it!

I just made this recipe and it was delish. I hadn't made French toast in a while and was searching for a recipe that in-cooperated two pieces of bread (like I remembered from my childhood) being sandwiched together before being dipped in the egg. And I found it here! It even had the filling I was craving for.  The only alterations I made was skipping the vanilla (as I came empty handed after raiding our cupboards) and adding a little but of milk to the egg batter. It was quick, simple and tasted great. Will defiantly make again!

My husband and I loved these! I was surprised that PB can taste so good with syrup; it seemed such an unlikely combo. I added a little milk and flour to the egg mixture to dip them into which made for a nice rich outer coating.

It was a delicious french toast recipe. When I made I didn't put the bananas in I just made it with peanut butter.  I was tasted the best when it was warm... I'm not sure I will make it again in sandwich form.

This is a mixed review; my family loved it (5 stars)... Me not so much (3 stars). If you like PB and bananas you will like this. We topped ours with a mixture of maple syrup and PB.

These were awesome! I served maple syrup over the top. It was a great weekend breakfast treat. I don't really think 2 tablespoons of butter is necessary, though. I only used 1/2 to 3/4 of a tablespoon and that was plenty.

I loved this recipe!!!!  I changed it a little though.  My dad has diabetes so I used Simply Jiff low-sugar peanut butter and sugar-free syrup.  It was delicious!!!!!!

My first french toast I've ever made so I was very glad the recipe was simple. Plus I LOVE banana and peanut butter sandwiches. It was amazing =)

I love peanut butter/banana toast, but having it as french toast gave it a weird taste, not really bad just weird. Probably won't make again.

The French toast part of this recipe was great but the bananas turned to mush. If I make this again I'll slice the bananas thin so they only impart the flavor without mushifying the whole recipe.

Recipe was good, but be careful of how much peanut butter you use.   Over doing the peanut butter makes the french toast too rich.

What a great idea.  My kids loved it (and these days they don't like much).  But even more, my husband and I loved it.  I can't wait to make it again.  The only change I made was only using half a banana per sandwich.

Not really that great... I made this as a surprise to my hubby, but the surprise didn't do me any good. He didn't like it but he was forced to eat it just because I exerted effort to cook it and he was starving.

A tasty breakfast treat. I used some left over homemade raisin bread and I added some milk to the egg as others suggested.  It was a bit of a "doorstop" french toast sandwich and it was VERY filling.  Would also be nice with a chocolate spread in place of the pb...mmmm!

My Family has a Tradition, since Mom was a litle girl, her Mom would make her Peanut Butter French Toeast, today i was browsing different French Toast recipes and when this one came along it reminded me of when i wa slittle and my mom would do PB Banana Toasts, so i decided to give it a try, my picky eater 2 year old boy who btw didn't eat all day ate a whole toast!!! i didnt think his tummy would be that big, he enjoyed it!.
The only changes i made was that i added 2% milk to the egg and a little of ground nutmeg to give it more flavor along with the Cinnamon, omitted the vanilla and instead of just creamy PB on each slice, Crunchy on one and Creamy on the other, it turned out great!!! will most definitely make again, my husband is craving for more!!!! Thanks Bon for a keeper recipe!

Nice idea, good flavor. It is really rich and filling! The only thing I didn't like about it was that was really dry, but I suppose that's to be suspected. I used Texas Toast and it worked perfectly. :)

Made this for my husband & 2 kids ~ they LOVED it! (i personally don't care for cooked bananas) I did make more of a french toast by adding: cinnamon, nutmeg, and a bit of soy milk to the egg & vanilla. I didn't measure the butter, just used what was needed to coat the surface of electric skillet. Thanks for the recipe, they all want to have it again tomorrow morning!!!

This is awesome!! I used regular bread, but next time I would love to try it with a thick egg bread. Not that I think it matters, but I used chunky peanut butter. 
This is so simple and super tasty that there is no excuse not to try this recipe.

I was actually kind of disappointed with the product, and I was so excited about it too.  (PB and banana being a favorite.)  

However, It turned out just fine, I just wasn't a big fan of the overly gooey warm peanut butter.  It was good, and I might make it again and try to get it just right for me.

It was all right - pretty much what it sounds like. I agreed with the person who said to make the French toast by itself first. Not bad, but not amazing either.

Quite good! I wanted to make a weekend breakfast for our four-year-old while Daddy slept in, and this was quiet and tasty! I used 3 or 4 tablespoons of milk instead of the vanilla (unnecessary with all the other flavours) and I used half of a large, overripe banana. I omitted the butter and just used non-stick spray in a non-stick pan. I used a slightly firmer bread (a yummy honey wheatberry bread) so I let the sandwich sit in the egg/milk mixture for a moment on both sides so it could absorb it somewhat, and it took maybe 3 or 4 minutes per side to brown up. I cut it into quarters and served it with a small dish of syrup for dipping (I'm just like GINGERLY88, I was raised on peanut butter and syrup on pancakes, French toast, and waffles!). Megan loves this sandwich! :) Thanks for sharing, Bon!

I have been making this since i was little and people thought i was weird. I make it a little more sinful by topping it with maple syrup.

This recipe was great.  I added some cinnamon as a few others suggested.  A nice twist on traditional french toast that we will be making again.

I wasn't sure about the PB/egg thing, but oh my goodness!!! Heaven. Make sure to use French Toast bread. Huge difference.

My son wanted to rate this a 5 1/2 star. He let me try a bite and it was really good. I would rate it a 4.

it was tasty for sure but it resembled too much of a sandwich for me and less of french toast. a good way to use up old bananas and bread with a twist!

This was great.  Like a few other reviewers I also cooked the two slices separate, then sandwiched the peanut butter and banana slices in between.  A super easy and yummy change on the usual french toast.  Thanks for the recipe!
