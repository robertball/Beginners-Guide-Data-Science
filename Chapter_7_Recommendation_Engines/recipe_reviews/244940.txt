Full of flavor and super simple to make, can't go wrong with this! Don't leave out the cilantro. It gives the sandwich a fresh kick that you won't regret! Thank you for the recipe.

EXCELLENT! We are sandwich people, so I knew that I had to make these...The flavors are wonderful! I used 'Philly' steaks in place of the roast beef, but I cannot wait to try it w/ the 'Slow-Roasted Beef for Sandwiches'. This was a HUGE hit and a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

It's tasty with modifications. It's definitely not a torta ahogada for those who are familiar with them. Chipotle sauce is spicy but quite bland. I added a little brown sugar and Knorr chicken bullion to taste. That did the trick. It's basically an extra tasty roast beef sandwich. Will make again.

I couldn't find the cooking sauce and ended up with a packet of McCormick's chipolte pepper marinade seasoning.  I used too much and needed to add more broth to keep the dipping sauce from being too salty...  Still, the final result was really tasty!  My husband can't stop talking about how good those sandwiches are.  Might use more onions next time.

I couldn't find any 12oz packages of Chipotle sauce, but found a 6oz can at Walmart.  I decided to start with just 1 can to test the flavor.  glad I stopped there! The canned Chipotle stuff here in San Antonio has a serious kick to it (and I love spicy food).  overall,  it was a very good flavor and easy meal to put together. I put provalone cheese on my sandwiches as well.

This was a real hit at my house. I didn't have the cooking sauce, so I used homemade red chile salsa and wow did my family like it!

Sooo good.  I normally have to sacrifice spice when I cook because I have a much higher tolerance than everyone else, but this actually meets my spice level and is so tasty that everyone else continues to eat it even though it exceeds their's.  I couldn't resist adding a dash of liquid smoke and a splash of lime juice to the sauce.  We had these for dinner with no other sides or snacks, the sandwich stands alone.

Made this and followed the recipe exactly. I served it on deli style rolls and used the sauce for dipping. It's messy to eat but so very yummy.

This sandwich was fantastic. I used beef stock and twice the amount called for. After putting beef in the pan I poured all the stock on the beef. Before the meal was over they were asking if I would make it again.
