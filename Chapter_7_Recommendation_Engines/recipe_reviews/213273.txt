This is an excellent pot roast recipe! I used a 3 lb. roast, and doubled all the other ingredients, except for the soda. I used about 20 oz. of 7up...and it turned out very well. I wasn't sure if I'd like the citrusy-sweet flavor of the soda in a pot roast, especially the gravy, but I was pleasantly surprised by the delicious taste! The meat was so tender as well...it almost melted in my mouth. I did cook it on high...for about 6-7 hours. It turned out absolutely fabulous, and my family loved it! Thanks so much for sharing the recipe...I'll be making it again!!!

This was perhaps the most bland pot roast recipe I've ever made. Even hubby, who LOVES pot roast, didn't mind giving away the leftovers to relatives. The end result had a strange flavor (I think it was the combination of the A-1 sauce with the Mountain Dew.)  This was just beyond disappointing.

Try using seven up it works very well. Maybe try to use less potatoes and add more celery and add mushrooms. All together very good

Excellent recipe! Followed directions exactly, used 7-up, and it turned out great. I did add sweet potatoes since I had some leftover from another recipe. The roast was very tender and juicy. Will be making again. Thank you!!

I used 7up instead of mountain dew as suggested by other reviews. The end result was tender and moist. I like a little more of a savory flavor to a pot roast and this was a little more sweet but still very good.

This was not to our liking at all (sorry!). My hubs ate his helping, but admitted that he choked it down because he was hungry. :( I think it was the Mountain Dew soda that ruined this for us. I've made pot roasts with Coke before and think that I'll stick with that method from now on. If you like citrus-y flavored roasts, this may be the recipe for you but unfortunately it wasn't for us. Thanks anyways, Erika.

The cut of meat is from the Chuck, not the Sirloin. Ingredients could be confusing to some.
