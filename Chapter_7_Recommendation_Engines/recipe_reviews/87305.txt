We've been doing this for years with a couple minor changes.  First, we've always use olive oil which is not only healthier but adds a wonderful flavor.  Second, we fold the top of the bag over just once and put one staple in the middle.  This allows steam to get out without the top popping open (pun intended).  The staple is so small we've never had any problems with sparking or whatever.  
I've also experimented with adding in a fresh jalapano pepper or some chopped garlic so it is never blah.  
One last thing, get some popcorn salt, it is much finer than table salt and works so much better.  
I can't imagine buying MW popcorn with all the additives plus costing $1 per bag or more!  Enjoy!!

I had to make this recipe twice, because the first time it burned after I set the bag on it's side like usual microwave popcorn (recipe did not state how to put bag in). As it turns out, the bag is supposed to be set upright (not on it's side), and it turned out just fine.  Try spraying "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" on top to keep it low cal.

WOW! This is the coolest thing! I've heard for years that this could be done, but for some reason, never tried it. I used 1/3 c. unpopped corn with no oil, and seasoned to taste with salt afterward. There were literally NO unpopped kernels, and none were burnt! The bag was in for about 3 minutes, and the tip about listening for 2 seconds between pops was great! I've always heard 5, and part of my corn usually burns.

I am so excited about this! I will never buy store-bought micro-corn again. Really versatile, too; this could be seasoned up with anything!

This is so easy, don't doubt it. I made it with oil and without and it works both ways.  I always have unpopped kernels but i would rather have them, then burnt popcorn.  it is great, easy, healthy and cheap!  that's tough to beat. I use the butter flavored spray release and I got great seasonings through kernelseasons.com -they carry lots more then you will find at the grocery store.  enjoy!

i have used this idea and turned it into a gift basket...i got cute lunch bags, a big bowl, seasonings and butter release spray and a bag or jar of popcorn.  i typed up the instructions and gave them all as gifts last year....now my whole office knows how to make it....  this is really a great recipe.  thanks again Acontorer!!!

Made this for the first time yesterday using olive oil but next time (and there will be many times) I will try without oil as some reviews state they have had success with that. I would rather add 1 tsp EVOO after it cooks for more flavor, if necessary. I will skip the salt in the bag as I had to add more afterward anyway.  Lots of fiber, very filling, low fat (esp without the oil), made a ton, inexpensive, no chemicals or cardboard taste (like packaged micro popcorn), and no packaging in the landfill.  No downside to this recipe! Total bag = 6 WW points made according to recipe

I've been making popcorn this way for years.  Be sure to sit the bag up, not down on its side.  And if your microwave does not have a turntable, turn your bag every 30 seconds or so.  If a lot of kernels have popped, I put them in my serving bowl and then continue microwaving the rest.  Oh, and I use I Can't Believe It's Not Butter spray and Butter Buds for a low cal snack.

I can't believe this worked.  I have made this twice.  My son loves it.  It tastes like air popped popcorn.  The second time I cut the kernels to 1/3 cup.  1/2 cup had too many wasted kernels.  I might even cut it to 1/4 cup next time.  It filled a brown lunch bag.  We added some salt before serving. UPDATE:  I made kettle corn.  I put 1/4 cup kernels, 1/2 tsp oil, 1 Tbs sugar.  Popped in brown bag until popping slowed.  There were hardly any kernels unpopped.  Added some sea salt to taste while hot.  YUM! Tastes just like the Kettle Corn you get at the fairs!(Definately think 1/4 cup kernels is perfect for my microwave and paper bags.

This was a really nice treat! I didn't use the oil to save on fat and calories. My children enjoy spraying with the I can't believe it's not butter spray and then sprinkling parmesan cheese or dry ranch dressing on top. Very good!

Instead of a paper bag, I use a pyrex mixing bowl with a plate laid upside down on top of the bowl to keep the kernels from jumping out.  works great and no waste.  note that the bowl and plate will be HOT so grab some mits :)

OMG - How cool is this recipe! I love when I come across a really simple recipe with so few ingredients that turns out soooo good! I've tried it with and without the oil (olive oil works great too), just watch your microwave times as everyone's microwaves are different. The possibilites are endless in terms of seasonings you can but on top - I kept it simple and light and just used butter spray! This is a great snack and now my whole house smells like popcorn! Definitely won't be going back to the pre-packaged stuff, sorry Mr. Redenbacher!

This is my new favorite snack.  I found that it took 2 minutes to cook mine, all microwaves are different.  At 2 minutes there are quite a few kernels left unpoped but any longer and the corn burns.  You just have to adjust to your microwave.  It beats the boughten kind hands down!!! We add garlic salt or lawreys seasoned salt to ours.  A great use for those 200+ lunch sacks that I had to buy for 1 or 2 being used. Great recipe!  I always love to find the homemade way to do something.

Great idea.....it really will burn after 2 1/2 minutes....took 3 times to figure it out.  Changed to 1/4 cup popcorn and didn't have the waste of all the unpopped kernals and no burning.  1/4 cup is perfect amount for one person.  Used standard brown lunch bags from grocery store, olive oil, and added butter popcorn seasoning in the bag.  After it was popped, sprayed with ICBINB and all 3 of my kids said it was better than regular microwave popcorn.  One last tip...fold bag over twice and put a small piece of tape to hold it shut.  No problems with bag coming open in the microwave and the tape does not melt.

How cool is this? Not only does this taste better than the prepackaged microwave popcorn, it's better FOR you too.  I do use the microwave popcorn because it's so much more convenient than cooking it on the stovetop, but it's so inferior to regular popped corn - and I've always shuddered to ponder what, really, is in those bags.  While this method doesn't take the place of traditionally popped corn in the same way bread machine bread is certainly not the same as conventional bread making, at least you're using good ingredients and making it yourself!  I made half a recipe and had no problems, just listened for the popping to taper off, then removed it before it had a chance to burn.  I  should have left well enough alone at that point, but what's popcorn without butter?...

Terrific!  Easy and less expensive than store-bought.  What more could one ask?  One tip for getting better microwave popped corn with less un-popped kernels is to preheat the microwave.  Put a cup of water in the microwave and heat to boiling.  Open the door, take out the cup, and add the bag of popcorn.  We have VERY few un-popped kernels when using this method.  We added about 1 1/2 tsp. of salted butter to the corn before putting in the bag and it made a HUGE difference. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! Hugs, Anj

This is awesome! I just wanted to add that I was leary of putting the bag unsealed in the microwave, and I didn't want to use a staple as a previous commenter suggested (metal bad in microwave!) so I pierced the fold in the bag with a toothpick to keep it together. I'm glad I did! 1/2 makes a lot of popcorn, and I'd have popcorn all over my microwave otherwise!

Frugal & Fabulous! I am always looking to save money & when I can do so as well as improve on the store version, I am thrilled! This microwave popcorn tip is so simple, thrifty & tasty! To make it even MORE economical I used a clear glass Pyrex type dish with lid. No need to buy bags & no worry about reviews that mentioned blowing up microwaves! Another perk is the kids can watch it pop & you can see when it needs to be stopped, so no over or under cooking. Just be sure to use oven mitts to remove the bowl & you can then add seasoning to taste & eat out of the same bowl. Your own microwave popcorn for pennies plus eating out of the same bowl is nice!

I use 1/3 cup of the popcorn and no oil, not needed, honest, and after I've folded over the top 1/2 inch a couple of times, I just fold over a triangle on each end of the top folded part, folding one of the small triangles to the front and one to the back of the bag, and it stays closed while it pops just fine.  When I first open the bag, I sometimes put in a bit of garlic salt or mexican spice, or parmesan cheese, close it back up and shake a couple of times and then open, and enjoy!

I've been making it this way (everyday) since I found this recipe about 6 mos. ago - I do - 1/4 c. popcorn -  olive oil - salt - fold once and staple once and on my microwave...78 seconds. AND - I eat the whole thing!!! Sometimes I dip a bit in homemade lowfat Ranch dressing while eating it--yum!
THANKS for the recipe!!

This is TERRIFIC, I will never EVER buy MW popcorn again.

Something I discovered at the store is a "giant" lunch sack versus the standard size, I picked up a package of those on accident.  This sack will accomodate 1/2 cup kernels and fills about 3/4 full when the pop.

Oily popcorn makes me crazy, which is why I was so excited about this recipe.  I tried it without oil, salt didn't stick to popcorn.  I tried it with 1/4 tsp olive and salt stuck but no greasy fingers! HOORAY!

Thank you ACONTORER, THANK YOU!!!

I've made this recipe with no issues. It's tasty and cheaper and healthier!

To those of you who have been having issues with bags smoking or starting on fire, it's because you're using recycled paper bags.

So good.  Used Old Bay instead of salt.  Been hung up on Old Bay since having the best bloody Mary in my life at a bar on Chesapeake Bay with Old Bay on the rim.

Anyway, so easy, so inexpensive.  Will never buy microwave popcorn again.

we used 1/4 cup of popcorn, no oil and no salt, added that after popping.  our microwave is 1100 watt and we popped it 1 minute 10 seconds, done to perfection, only had about 8 unpopped kernals. Added salt and butter after the fact. Dr. Oz said microwave popcorn has cancer causing chemicals in it.. no more of that for me, I will make this!!  Tastes alot like air popped corn when you don't use oil in the bag.. really no need to add oil. Thank you for opening our eyes to a better, healthier and most of all cheaper way to enjoy popcorn!!

Tried for the 1st time to make this & bout started a fire, it was smoking pretty bad - bag & popcorn was burnt up. I put it in for 3 mins but after only a min, if that, smoke was rolling out of the micro & it was still popping pretty heavily. Not sure I'll take the risk again making this esp after having our home burn down 9-8-09

I can't believe it worked!!  This is awesome!  I was skeptical of just folding the bag over without sealing or securing it somehow but it was just fine.  I didn't have any problems cooking it with the bag on it's side.  The reasonig I am only giving it four stars is that when I did the 1/2 cup of corn as the recipe specifies, I had at least half the kerels uppopped.  I tried it again with just a 1/4 cup and almost all the kernels popped.  Also, it works just fine with 1/2 the oil.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I have been doing this for years only I don't use any fat!  I use 3 tablespoons of popcorn and toss it in the brown bag, my microwave pops it in 1 min. 35 seconds.  Once popped I lightly spray it with nonstick cooking spray which makes the salt stick better.  I also use extra fine salt.  No butter needed, it's delicious and only 90 calories for a very large serving!

I had a horrible experience with this recipe. I did exactly as it said (although the directions were not very descriptive) and the bag almost caught on fire, so i took it out and i burned my hand.

First off, 1/2 cup unpopped popcorn leaves far too many kernals.  Use 1/3 cup.  Second, there is no need to add oil to the popcorn before you pop it.    I could not taste it at all, the only thing it did was make the bag greasy.  Add oil or melted butter to the popcorn after it has been popped (if you're using).  I have found tht it mixes better when using a bowl rather than trying to pour it into the bag.

Be VERY CAREFUL and READ THE OWNERS MANUAL for your microwave oven before making popcorn this way. I didn't and am now shopping for a new oven, having arced my way to a fire (fortunately contained within the oven) that destroyed my microwave oven. My manual explicitly said "no brown bags" and the ones I've read for new ovens say "specialized popcorn cookers and commercially made microwave popcorn bags only." My effort to simplify storage and save money went up in smoke!

FYI, the new ones don't endorse drying herbs either, which I did many times in the Litten that was 20 years old when we sold the house in 1998. Of course, it wasn't made in China...

This is amazing!!  What a money saver.  Plus, I like to top my popcorn many different ways, so this is a nice clean, unadulterated popcorn that can be used for caramel corn, popcorn balls, garlic popcorn, taco popcorn, peanut butter popcorn, buttered popcorn, or when I'm trying to be especially healthy, butter sprayed popcorn!!  After trying it both with and without the oil, I now never use the oil, it pops just as well without, and is perfect to top however I choose.  Do be careful when filling the bag, if there's too much lots of the kernels will go unpopped, too little, and they can easily scorch.  I also make sure to fold down the top of the bag twice, and fold a corner on each side of the bag.  Also listen carefully, as you would with any microwave popcorn, since cooking times vary even from one time to the next, based on how much popcorn you get in there.  I like to use the larger bags to yield a larger batch of popcorn.  But it's so easy to make, if you really want more you can always pop a second (or third, or fourth. . .) bag.

Made this today and LOVED it!  I used hierloom red popcorn kernels which pop WHITE.  They popped perfectly using this method and I hardly had any unpopped kernels.  I used:  1/3 cup of the red corn kernels, 1/2 tsp of vegetable oil, put in regular brown paper lunch bag, and I popped them in an 1100 wt microwave for approximately 1 minute and 40 seconds.  This was so easy, and so delicious, that I don't know if I will ever go back to brand-name pre-packaged microwave popping corn.

I've been regularly using this recipe for a while now. Popcorn has been my fave snack since I was a kid so I was so excited to find a cheap and natural recipe. I usually use evoo while popping and season afterward - either savory (with dry ranch or a salt/pepper/garlic powder combo) or sweet (topped with cinnamon & sugar). Love it!

This is so easy and good I feel like companies that sell microwave popcorn are ripping people off! We are never buying it again! You  can even customize the seasoning for individuals. I seasoned mine with salt and Old Bay before I popped it, and my husband put in a little cayenne pepper in his own bag. I can't wait to do this over and over again!

For the brown paper "lunch bags" (5x3x10inch) I bought I had to use 1/4 cup of popcorn kernels because with 1/2 cup my popcorn burned. Make sure the bag is upright and not on its side. I just have regular salt and popcorn salt would be so much better! All in all I'm pretty fascinated with this beautiful fresh bowl of popcorn sitting in front of me!

Simply amazing.  I too have used EVOO per some other suggestions, but now I add some fat free dry Italian Dressing Mix (no more than 1 tsp. per bag).  This recipe is quick, inexpensive, healthy and quite an improvement over store bought microwave popcorn!  Thanks for sharing.  This recipe halves beautifully as well, 1/4 cup of unpopped kernals still makes a huge bowl.

It's one of those stupid simple things!  Great for Weight Watchers if you just put the kernels in by themselves.  1/4 cup kernels makes about 4 cups & it is only 1 point.

This recipe is definitely a keeper for me!  I made it using bag and veg. oil, and also using glass Pyrex bowl with lid and coconut oil.  I microwaved the bag for 1 min. 45 sec. which resulted in some burnt popcorn.  I microwaved the bowl for 2 min. and got no burnt kernels! It actually turned out tastier in the bowl too because of the coconut oil, which gave it a delicious aroma as well!

Did not work...BLEW UP MY MICROWAVE!!! Save your home from the risk of fire! Pop your popcorn the stove...with a pot...OR...buy actual microwave popcorn! It may be a tad bit expensive...but, trust me, it is a heck of a lot cheaper than buying a new microwave!

What I like about this recipe is the possibilities are endless!  I use 1/3 cup of kernels and that is the perfect amount for a single serving for our family. Just a spritz with popcorn spray and some seasoning and we are good to go. My son likes it with cinnamon and sugar and my daughter likes it with jalapeño salt.

First let me just say I love how fast, easy, healthy, and cheap this is and with no chemicals!!

Second, the only change I made was to use my olive oil mister to very lightly spray olive oil onto the kernels so it cut down on the oil to about a 1/4 tsp. 

I did add the salt but found that the popcorn still needed to be seasoned afterwards so I will not add salt prior to cooking next time. I sprinkled a little bit of shallot salt (that I purchased at Pensey's Spices) onto the popcorn and we loved it!! Thanks so much for such a fantastic idea!!!

12-21-2016 - I make this popcorn recipe without the oil or salt for  the base of this site's Classic Caramel Corn. I can't tell you how many people absolutely love my caramel corn. I believe this recipe is one of the things that makes it perfect, especially for the fall and winter holidays. 
5-4-2012 - Because I'm being careful about added oils and the calories, I made this popcorn without the oil. I put the kernels in a paper bag, and it popped up beautifully! After I poured it all into a bowl, I lightly sprayed it with butter flavored Pam and salted it. Delicious! You can also add a packet of Splenda for that kettle corn taste.

tried it with olive oil to start and later with nothing, and it really doesn't taste any different so I skipped the oil altogether.  My only issue is that regular brown bags don't seem to be big enough.  I only use about 1/3 cup of corn and the bag is super full (I used one staple as suggested) and it ends up falling over.  Am going to try putting the beg standing up inside a bowl to see if that helps.  Still a wonderful recipe :)  Thank you!!

Yummy! Way better than pre-packaged micro popcorn. Mine popped a lot faster; less than two minutes. Make sure to stand the bag up in the micro.

Easy recipe and much better for you than the microwave popcorn from the store! I found that not using the oil works better.

I was excited to find a microwave popcorn I could make myself.  But there were more unpopped kernels than I expected, and I laid the bag on it's side, and when it was finished popping, 3 1/2 minutes later, the side of the bag was almost dripping with oil.  I used vegetable oil and salt like the recipe said, but it was very bland.  I'll use butter next time and see if it makes a difference.  I also sprinkled Johnny's on it and it improved the taste!

Making the popcorn in a brown bag sure worked.But be prepared to clean your microwave tray.The popcorn was a little dry and too tasteless for us.Maybe you could add more butter or salt.Then again you might as well just buy a bag of potato chips.

This is the easiest, quickest, most deliciously healthy way to make popcorn! This recipe has become a snacking staple in our house. The method for cooking is spot-on perfect, but this recipe needs way more oil and salt. I've tried olive oil too (as some other reviews suggested) which is good also.
 
The best part about this recipe is that it's not only yummy, but also super healthy. Popcorn is naturally high in fiber and with this recipe yours doesn't have to be smothered with that unhealthy fake butter. 

Keep in mind some kernels remain un-popped, but honestly I am very pleasantly surprised that nothing burned, nothing spilled, and nothing caught on fire. 

I can't wait to make caramel popcorn with it. Really, the possibilities are endless… caramel corn, cheesy popcorn, garlicky herb popcorn, snack mix, popcorn balls, or just plain snacking/movie popcorn… Thank you for this recipe!!

this recipe is missing a few warnings but it still works to some degree, 1)keep the bag up and not on its side and 2) do not use recycled paper bags. Recycled materials can contain trace amounts of metallic particles (from staples in magazines etc) which when heated will act like tiny sparks and cause your bags to ignite.

It works well.  I still prefer my popcorn made in a pan, it seems to come out better (but with more fat since you need more oil).  One thing to take note of, the first time I tried this recipe I didn't have a paper bag.  So, I put it in a large microwave safe bowl with a plate over it for a lid.  I took it out when it was done and let it sit.  After about 30 seconds, the bowl exploded spraying popcorn and glass everywhere which took me a half hour to clean up.  Be careful with this if you choose to use a bowl like others have said they've done.

I like the idea and know lots of people swear by this recipe, but it has never quite worked for me. I've tried it almost 10 times, and I'm sure I must be doing something wrong. I've done it with and without oil, with and without butter, but found that my best still leave half the kernels unpopped and the line between good and burned is quite fine for me. It's an interesting take, and I thank you for posting it. I have better results with Movie Star Popcorn.

this is very good, very easy, but 1/2 cup was too much for the bag.  Even 1/3 cup was too much, and the bottom of the bag blew out.  I will use 1/4 cup popcorn next time.  I do not use the salt or oil (I like it plain).  As others suggest, I fold the bag once and staple, but I watch it the whole time it's popping to make sure there is no problem.  Soooo much better than the prepackaged stuff!

Good idea and it tasted good but I'd offer this advice.  Use the larger size paper lunch bags rather than the smaller ones, and possibly double them up.  I had a blowout in the bottom of my bag.  You can use store-bought popcorn seasonings instead of the salt but sprinkle them on after you pop the corn.

WOW! I am so impressed. I have never heard of just using a paper bag like this, but it really works. I made my version of kettle corn using 1/4 cup kernels, 1 tsp. veg. oil, 1 tblsp. sugar, and a few shakes for salt. In my microwave it took almost exactly 2 minutes and it worked perfectly. I will never waste my money on microwave popcorn again!  :)

I make microwave popcorn all the time, but I don't use any oil.  If you just put the unpopped popcorn in the brown bag ( I use 1/4 cup) and microwave about 2 minutes.........it comes out perfect.  I use a little bit of spray butter and salt and it is delicious and only 1 gram of fat.

Who knew?  I can't believe I have been buying microwave popcorn all these years!  I am on a no white sugar/no white flour "diet" and am looking for healthy snacks.  I used olive oil and sea salt, but I think next time I am going to only use  1/4 cup of kernels because 1/2 almost blew out my bag.  I might even use a tad bit of butter every now and again :)

I bought a simple microwave popper bowl with a vented lid...just add corn and oil.  No wasted paper products and you just have to wipe the bowl out and you're ready for the next batch.    You can also sprinkle the popped corn with a bit of Stevia sweetener and apple pie spices for a great low cal sweet treat.

fantastic recipe! I popped mine for approx. 2 1/2 minutes, had a few unpopped kernels, but I also have that in the prepackaged type as well... Much better for you than the packaged type since you can add the amount of salt and oil that you use... I'm not a salt eater so this is a great find for me!!!!

Wonderful idea!, but doesn't make large quantities.  I burned mine when made as stated, and the recipe should include how to set up the bag.  After reading reviews, made with 1/4 cup popcorn, 1/2 tsp oil and a few shakes of salt, then put the bag upright and microwaved for 2 minutes.  Only a couple kernels weren't popped.  As someone else suggested, I sprayed with some butter spray.  Tasted perfect. *Update-I microwave popcorn all the time now. I don't use any oil; it's just not needed.

Just to let people know, you can experiment with this basic recipe.  I made it as stated in large quantities for an end of the school year party and it was delicious. But I have also made it with walnut oil and afterward sprinkled Splenda on top to give it that kettle corn flavor without the calories.  Also, I always use white paper bags because that's what I have and it works well in those too!

I've been making this popped corn for quite a while, with or without the oil, it always turns out great.

This works great! No problems, just making a few adjustments next time. I am going to try with less oil/butter next time and 1/3 cup popcorn. I folded the top over twice and folded triangles on the corners and the bag sealed itself. 2 minutes for my microwave (around 1,000 watts). I also put the bag on its side, like MW popcorn. 

I had NO problems with burning or the bag opening, bottom blowing out etc, etc. I would never use staples or metal in my microwave, fear of starting a fire by arcing.

I've been buying microwave popcorn for years (although I know it's got so many things that are unhealthy and that has always bothered me).  My kids love popcorn but I don't like how it turns out when done in a pot because it doesn't stay dry enough. This worked great! I have a "popcorn" button on my microwave and always have to add another 30 seconds to the cook time to get all the the kernels to pop but it turns out perfect every time! Thank you for sharing. :)

This is great! I grew up with the pre-made bags, but I'll never buy them again! I don't coat the kernels in oil and I find that 1/4 cup fits in my paper bags just right. I'm glad I read the reviews, or else I wouldn't have known to stand the bag upright. Depending on my mood I'll top with a small amount of salted butter, or, for something sweeter, some salted butter and sugar. Parmesan cheese is delicious, too!

I used Orville's popcorn and vegetable oil, I stood the bag upright with two small folds, it stayed closed but still let the steam out. Update: I've made this so many times now, I only put a tiny bit of oil in my kernels, less than an 1/2 tsp. and works out fine...less calories, use fine popcorn salt and add it to the bag before popping.

This is great!  Love the method and the fact I can skip the fat and salt.  I did not use oil, many have successfully, but I thought it was a bit risky.  I folded the bag over twice - no staple needed.  The 1/2 cup of popcorn was a bit much and burned a bit.  I backed it down to 1/3 cup and zapped it for 2 minutes.  Just right for my oven.  Gonna make this a lot!

8.30.12 ...https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/87305/microwave-popcorn/ ...  I use a quarter cup popcorn, no oil, no salt for a 1:45 minutes.  I guess it depends on the popcorn & how big your bag is, but that's all that will fit once popped.  I just lay it flat, kind of like the storebought microwave kind, with the folded side down.  Let it sit till you don't hear any more popping.  Pour in a bowl, shot of butterflavored spray & a little salt.  Toss & repeat.  'Seems oil & salt in the microwave aren't good ideas.  Oil & paper?  I'm thinking fire.  Salt zapping the food you hear about all the time - to wait to add it till it's done.  :?  :)  ... Anyway, that's how this girl does it.  :)

I hate the microwave popcorn that comes from the grocery store and usually make my popcorn stove top;but, that takes a bit more time, so I gave this a try.  It is great!  Be sure to mix the ingredients in a bowl first.  I was lazy and tried mixing it right in the bag and while it did work, it clumped in the bottom.  The second batch was better.

I have tried this 2 times now and it has worked out fabulously! To all of the reviewers and readers who say that the bottom of the bag has blown out on them or that there were too many unpopped kernels, I would like to offer you some advice to fixing these problems. First, I sprayed one bag with canola oil and inserted it into another brown bag that hadn't been sprayed (be sure to spray the bag BEFORE putting it inside the non-sprayed one!). This seemed to help from the bag becoming too greasy and blowing out on the bottom. Second, I found that if you pause the microwave when the bag is getting 75% full and empty the popped kernels into a bowl then putting the bag back into the microwave for the remaining time, that helps to pop almost all of the kernels. Hope this helps those out there who have had trouble with making this popcorn! :)

You don't need to use oil or anything. It works just fine with plain popcorn and a microwave. Also, adjust the time depending on your microwave, mine only takes 1 min & 45 seconds.

We did this at work but left the oil out entirely and it was fine! We found our magic amount to be 1/4 cup in a brown lunch bag. We seasoned a variety of ways: salt, cinnamon/artificial sweetener, tabasco sauce, ICBINB spray. Thanks!

This works great with 1/4 cup of popcorn. I pop it without the oil, and add melted butter and truffle salt (the smallest pinch will do) after it's popped. Addictive!!!

Try mixing a small pinch of truffle salt into eggs too, before scrambling them. So delicious...

Totally amazing! BUT,
1. Don't use oil. You can pop it without (works perfect) 
2. Staple the bag. (Don't worry it won't spark in the microwave)
3. Melt 1 tablespoon butter and spread after (1 tb. butter is 35 cal. where 1 tsp. oil is 70 cal.)
4. Reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp - or to taste.
5. Make lots - everyone will want some!

I cut the recipe in half because that I found it was too much for a lunch-sized paper bag.  It's the perfect amount for two to share, and it's so tasty!  I substitute olive oil for the vegetable oil.  This recipe is a definitely money-saver in my home!

This popcorn is just as good as what we cook in our stove top popcorn popper.  I gave it only 4 stars because there are a lot of kernels that do not pop.  Quick and easy though.

Super easy! I love popcorn but hate the chemicals and weird aftertaste in the store bought microwave popcorn. So when I came across this recipe I knew that I had try it and immediately I did! I used olive oil and it only took 2 minutes in my microwave. Perfect yummy popcorn, thanks for sharing this great method!

I made this immediately after reading reviews on it.  As one reviewer suggested, I used 1/4 cup of kernels, 1 tsp oil and 1 Tbsp sugar to make Kettle corn.  Popped it for 2 minutes and now I am enjoying it as I type!  Great, quick snack!

Great recipe! If your popcorn taste a little dry it can be a few things. 1: Old popcorn 2: The type of oil you are using 3: No butter or salt on the corn. We have a Stir Crazy and use coconut oil (check popcorn stores, health food stores or online) which seems to make the corn taste moist. When your corn gets old, the oil can't always add enough moisture, so you may want to toss it and get new corn. Great recipe! My husband thought I was crazy, but this was so good. Lunch size bag, upright, 1tsp oil, 1/2 tbsp butter and a little salt. The butter added a little flavor to the corn, but mostly stuck to the bag. Added a little more after it was done. Will make this forever. Thank you.

I really really wanted this to work.  And it does, but only for tiny amounts.  My lunchbags seemed to have enough room for only about an eighth of a cup of popcorn to pop.  More than that and it burned.  But what was good was really good!

This was great. I like to season with Seasoning Salt. Also, my mom used to do this and not use any oil at all. I was going to submit a pic but it seemed kind of silly to send in a picture of some popcorn and a brown paper bag. Thanks for a fun recipe :)

Well, I almost blew up my microwave, but the popcorn that did pop tasted pretty good!  After about 45 sec my 2001 GE microwave started to majorly power surge, so I immediately opened the door and took the bag out.  Only about half the bag popped in this time (I used 1/3 cup) and that corn was nice and white and fluffy!  Out of curiosity though, I started looking at the bad reviews for this recipe and found that I wasn't the only one with this problem, I just happened to catch it early enough!  I googled it, several microwave manufacturers say NOT to use brown paper bags in the microwave! Ha who knew?!  So I wonder if a white paper bag would work???
Oh and to my knowledge, my microwave still works fine:)

I have been doing this for many many years, But somewhat different. 
Put a couple of table spoons of Unpopped corn in a paper bag and fold to close and microwave until fully popped but not burnt. Empty contents of popped corn into large bowl. Then get spray Pam or spray butter and lightly spray pop corn while lightly flipping popped corn and and lightly sprinkle pop corn salt and shake lightly flip pop corn in bowl to spread the ingredients around. Also on occasion I sprinkle Grated Cheese for a extra treat or Old Bay seasoning.

This worked great. In our microwave, it took 1 minute and 45 seconds. Tried the suggestion about the tape, but it came undone and wasn't needed anyway. Used the same bag twice with good results. This makes 12 cups of popcorn

Worked perfectly - although I think I would reduce the amount of popcorn, because it seems like I had quite a few unpopped kernels.  It was delish!  I used EVOO instead of veggie oil also.

I was always too scared to try this based on the reviews from people who said that their microwaves blew up or the bags started on fire.  (However, I think the reviewer who suggested that it's because of people using recycled bags has some merit.)  Anyway, I finally tried this without oil -- just 1/4 C. of popcorn in the bag, folded it over, and stood it in the microwave.  It took 1.5 minutes to be done before it started to burn, and there were quite a few kernels left in the bottom.  However, I am so impressed at how crisp this popcorn was without oil -- it reminded me of theater popcorn!  I did add some butter after it was done popping.  It was great stuff.  No longer am I buying any of the unhealthy prepackaged stuff.

Been wanting a healthier alternative to the bags of microwave popcorn, and this fits the bill. However, my brown paper bags hold only 1/4 cup popcorn so I use about 1 tsp. of oil. We now keep a variety of powdered seasonings, (ranch, kettle corn, white cheddar), to flavor the popcorn to everyone's tastes. Thank you ACONTORER for sharing!

Cool! 4 stars due to directions only. You probably need to experiment with amounts and time and bags to see what works best in your microwave and WATCH it as it is popping!! I made it as written, but had to stop my microwave at 2.20 minutes because the Orville Redenbacher corn popped up so big and fluffy it filled my brown paper lunchbag so full it about fell over and some of the popcorn was really jammed in the bottom of the bag. It is kind of dry and tasteless as written but we poured melted butter over it in the bowl and salted to taste.

I love this method of making popcorn because I can control the fat and salt! It's less expensive than buying pre-packaged microwave popcorn. I usually fold the bag once and add 1 staple. It never sparks in the microwave.

I was scared to do this because I thought the paper bag would light on fire lol. But this worked really well. I followed the recipe exactly and stood the bag up (and not lied it on its side). The recipe didn't say anything about the bag positioning but other people said to stand it up. It worked really well, tasted great and was super easy to do. Will definitely do again.

This recipe is a  5++, because it worked with absolutely no problem. I used a standard brown lunch bag. I mixed in the oil, salt, and popcorn into a measuring cup and then poured it into the bag. I folded it over at the top, as suggested, and then placed it folded side down on a large plate. I have a small microwave, so it took 3 1/2 minutes. I loved how ungreasy the popcorn tastes. It costs next to nothing to make to. Thank you, I will never buy popcorn in a bag again.

THANK YOU!!! I was recently stricken with a microwave that no longer wanted to turn. With that, I was no longer able to pop bagged popcorn without the whole thing catching on fire. UGH...not wanting to buy a plug-in popper, I went in search for an easier way to feed my children popcorn. THIS IS IT!!! I have only done it once so far ((and there will be any more times coming)) This time I used vegt. oil and a slight sprinkle of garlic sat. Then after it popped, I added some of the Kernel Seasonings...white cheddar on half and the kettle corn on the other. Both were wonderful...Thank you so much for this great tip!!!

Since I eat microwave popcorn about 4 or 5 nights a week I couldn't wait to try this recipe.  I purchased 50 brown paper lunch bags that measured 5 1/8 X 3 1/8 X 10 5/8 inches.  Last night I used the 1/2 cup as directed and it popped my bag so tonight I used 1/4 cup and it was perfect.  I did as others suggested and sat the bag upright and stapled the top after folding over.  I so appreciate getting this recipe as it not only saves money it's tasty!  Can't wait to try other seasonings tomorrow night.  Thank you ACONTORER for submitting this recipe.

This is fantastic! However, since I have a lower power microwave I found 1/2 cup of kernels didn't pop very well. So I cut the recipe in half and used 1/4 cup of popcorn kernels and 1/2 teaspoon olive oil and a touch of salt. Almost all of it popped after doing this and it was very tasty!

Okay, It didn't work in the paper bag for me, but is because I have a small microwave.  So I used a microwave safe bowl and it was great!  I'm back to making my own popcorn and it is even cooked in the bowl I serve it in!  Thank you@

This is so much cheaper and healthier than pre-packaged microwave popcorn you buy in the grocery store!  We use some of the butter flavor sprinkles that you can put on veggies.  Works like a charm with this recipe!  We've made it several times with no problems.

I don't use any oil when I pop mine.  I find a quarter cup fills the bag.  Unpopped kernels in the bottom of the bowl?  Put them back in the bag and pop them - works like a charm!

Wow!  I am so excited. I just tried this recipe and it work fabulously!  The paper bag I used was too small, and I had to clean up a bit.  What I am most happy about is that I am on a Gluten-free diet and am always uncertain about microwave popcorn.  Now I an make my own in just a few minutes with no mess!  Thanks you.

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe, Acontorer!   Making popcorn in a microwave CAN be fun and delicious.  I started off making popcorn this way years  ago because I could never find anything to purchase at the grocery story that was pure enough for me!

Thrilled I tried this.  turned out perfect.  I used a little less popcorn (1/3 cup) and adjusted oil accordingly.  made with olive oil to be healthier.  Very light tasting fluffy popcorn with hardly any unpopped kernals.  Thanks.

I LOVE this recipe! I tell everyone about it and get calls asking for the recipe again and again! I have a thirteen year old son who loves making microwave popcorn. I like having the popcorn, salt and oil on hand, ready to use, so I put enough for one bag into a zip top bag. All he has to do is put it in the brown paper bag then into the microwave. He like this better than the "prepackaged" popcorn

As I sat here reading this recipe I thought I gotta try this. I got up dug out one of the many small paper bags I keep from my purchases & proceeded to make this. I did alter the recipe somewhat. I eat popcorn for the enjoyment not the calorie factor, please note. I used popping oil about 2 TBSP i/2 c popcorn and added 1/2 tsp cayene & 1/2 tsp garlic to the oil & popcorn mixture poured it in my bag & zapped it, it took about 5 min in my microwave as it is a well loved vintage model. I shook &  turned the bag about every min & poured it out in my bowl & am greatly enjoying it now as I write this review. I did sprinkle it with popcorn salt & YUM. NOTE: the earlier reviewer that mentioned popcorn salt is right it is the thing to use because it is so fine it sticks to your popcorn better & more evenly!

MIKE FROM PA is spot on! I've also done this for some years. First learned of it from Alton Brown of "Good Eats"/ Food Network fame. My kids love it and really with a high grade ( doesn't mean expensive) EVOO, don't add butter. The EVOO is at least as good as butter and you won't miss it. Plus like MIKE says, it's good oil. I won't even buy theater popcorn anymore. Why settle for packaging materials when you can have a real treat. Yumm-O!

How awesome this is!  I had no idea I could make my own microwave popcorn!  I made it last night with olive oil - but will try with no oil next time.  When I tasted it right out of the microwave with just salt, I was kind of put off - because I'm used to eating my "extra butter" flavored microwave popcorn.  Needless to say, I poured some melted butter over it and it was delish!  I think I actually used too much butter - so I will use less next time.  I'm sure I will make it "just right" after a little experimentation.

I will never buy pre-packaged popcorn again! Fast, easy, and healthy! Just listen for the double seconds between pops. I used a brown paper grocery bag (thicker than a lunch bag), and it worked fine too.

In efforts to try to save my smooth top stove from further scratching while popping popcorn I resorted to this recipe. I was pleasantly surprised at the outcome and even made the kettle-type popcorn as well using Bake4fun's review of this recipe from July of 09. Just be sure to take out the bag as soon as it starts to slow. My microwave took less than 2 minutes!

I have bought my last box of microwave popcorn.  I followed other's advice and just used popcorn with no oil.  Mainly because I'm lazy like that.  It tasted great just the way it was.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Probably the best non-movie theatre popcorn I have had.  I did use the butter flavored popcorn oil that my dad uses for his popcorn popper instead of vegetable oil and I added butter flavored salt instead of regular salt.  Absolutely delicious and the dogs loved it too!  :)

I didn't doubt that this would work, I just couldn't believe I didn't know about it sooner! I tossed about 1/4 cup kernels with a small amount of EVOO and seasoned salt, put in brown lunch bag and microwaved about 2 min, listening carefully. It was great, and so much fresher tasting than the store bought microwave packages. I can't wait to try different flavors! Great recipe.

Oh my, was this popcorn yummy!  I used the method that the recipe called for with vegetable oil, unpopped popcorn, but with no added salt.  Afterwards, I added 2 tablespoons of melted, unsalted butter along with several sprinkles of white cheddar popcorn salt and I was good to go.  This was an excellent alternative to stove-top popping, which never turned out quite right for me.  Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe.  The popcorn taste exceptionally great!  :)

Can't believe this is so easy and it works! I laid the bag down on its side with no problems except for the fact that 1/2 cup kernels is too much for a standard size lunch bag and it overflowed so I had to stop it early. Next time I'll try a little more oil and 1/3 cup kernels. I couldn't taste the olive oil I used. Thanks for an easy winner!
Edit: I've made this several times now and have discovered that you don't even need to use the oil at all. I squirt it w/oil spray after it pops and sprinkle w/salt.

What a great idea! This tastes just like stove top popcorm without the pan to wash afterwards. Highly recommend for a quick snack.

I am enjoying this right now. I have a powerful microwave and have tried 2 min. at full power and 2 1/2 min at power level 9. Both times I only had a few unpopped kernels and no problem with burning. I will play around with the butter salt flavouring. Thanks for sharing this recipe. Great idea!

Very good!  I love popcorn but like knowing what is in it instead of buying the prepackaged microwave stuff with all the preservatives and didn't want to take up more counter/cabinet space with an air popper.  This recipe worked great.  I used olive oil and stood the bag upright in the microwave.  It came out perfectly.

I had my doubts about this. I had to toss the first batch because it was overdone. I used just shy of 1/2 cup of popcorn and just over a tablespoon of oil. I used popcorn topping oil in the bag and popcorn salt for it's finer grain. Turned out really well. I'm always amazed at what I can find on the internet.

Overall I give it a 5 because this is such a great find. I think next time I'll just do it in 2 batches so it gets done with out having the extra kernels or overdoneness.

Thanks!

Really good, fast & easy! Way better then store bought micro popcorn. I put mine in the micro for 2 minutes and it was perfect. A little salt and butter and movie night was set!

This worked so slick. My only problem was that my bag didn't seem big enough. The kernels were really jammed together and I had a lot of unpopped kernels left over. I will have to try with a smaller amount of popcorn. I do agree with others that it is a little bland. I think I will try to season it with some garlic salt next time, and there will be definitely be a next time. Much healthier and much cheaper than those little bags.

So cool! I was tired our stupid default popcorn blower which only spit hot seeds back out. This is awesome! It worked perfect and I didn't have to have all the gross oil and salt, I could have it plain. Will use all the time!

This is the way my family eats popcorn too--plus with a little butter & aji nori furikake (seasoned seaweed and sesame seed mix found in asian markets) for a hawaiian kick.

I was pleasantly surprised at how well the popcorn turned out! I used olive oil, which always gives a great flavor.  I just added a little REAL butter and a little salt.  It was the best popcorn I've made in a long time.

I, too, was skeptical about this working, but I followed the instruction exactly and it did turn out exactly as it was supposed to. Only thing is, i like a lot more butter flavor, so i'll probably go on making it stove top with margarine as before.

These were fun to do with the kids.  Unfortunately, 2 out of 3 did not really like it.  I tried it and thought it was fine.  Be careful not to leave in the microwave too long or it will start to burn.  Also, for an added flavor, sprinkle parmesan cheese on top when done popping.

This was so easy and great! First bag I kind of burned because it was still popping at 2:30 minutes. So the second bag I stopped at 2:00 minutes and it was PERFECT! This is the easiest way ever to make popcorn!

I used 1/3 popcorn (Orville Redenbacher’s original 100% natural, non GMO, gluten free) and 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil. Put it all in a small bowl and stirred (to mix oil and popcorn), put in regular lunch paper bag, put a little salt in to.  Folded down the top and stood it upright in microwave for 3.5 minutes and waited until the popping stopped for a few seconds.  Immediately opened the door and took out bag.    Sprayed “I Can’t Believe It’s Butter” on top.  Fluffy and delicious!!  And so healthy!

Love the control over what goes in! Like so many others, I use 1/3 cup popcorn. Usually add a tsp of water to generate a little steam, then dump into a big bowl, spray with butter-flavored cooking oil and toss with seasonings. My favorites include cinnamon-sugar, pizza seasoning, garlic powder or Parmesan cheese.

Tasted great without oil, but mine popped through the bottom of the bag when the bag started to get full, even though I only used 1/4 cup of kernels and cooked for 1:45.

Easy peasy...watch the time and listen to the pops, I had a couple burnt clusters. I would say no more than 2 seconds between pops. This popcorn is cheap compared to the ready to pop stuff, 8 kernels that didn't pop isn't enough to "break the bank"

When you make this the first time, stand near your microwave as to that cooking times do vary. I pop the popcorn plain.  I get better results if I fold the top of the bag down twice, and stand the bag upright in my microwave.  I have one of those aerosol oil sprayers (misto), and mist the popcorn and sprinkle with salt afterwards.

This is one of those awesome hacks that seem too good to be true but actually work beautifully. My kids love popcorn, but I refuse to give my kids microwave popcorn because of all of the nasty chemicals that they put in there...this is by far the easiest way to make popcorn!! SO glad I found this recipe, I tell everyone about it!

I really love this recipe! However, I made it with somewhat different proportions. I mixed in a cup only 3 TBSP. of unpopped popcorn, 1/2 tsp. coconut oil with 1/4 tsp. salt. It was much less calories than the stovetop version I used to make. So I'm saving WW points by using this method and it's just as delicious. Try sprinkling smoked paprika on top for a nice change.

Pop the popcorn, drizzle Olive Oil over it (as much as desired) generously apply chili, onion and garlic powder and BAM! "Gourmet Popcorn" We serve this in our restaurant after dinner hours and people go nuts over it.

1/2 cup of kernals makes a lot of popcorn.  So much that it does NOT fit in a brown lunch bag.  The bag broke open and popped all over the inside of my microwave.  The time is way too long as well.  1/2 cup of kernals is still popping at 3 minutes and the middle of the bag was burnt.  I recommend 1/4 cup kernals 2 minutes and listen for the pop.

Very good. I used 1/2 cup popcorn with 1 tsp coconut oil and roughly 1/2 tsp salt, 3:30 minutes at full power in our microwave. No burnt kernels, and makes about 12 cups of popped popcorn.

So much cheaper and healthier than commercially prepared micro popcorn!  And it's just as easy - we don't even bother with the oil or salt, just add what we like after it's popped.

This is the BEST popcorn ever!! I used Extra Virgin Olive Oil and 1 tsp of Sea Salt (instead of 1/2 tsp of salt).  My husband was skeptical at first, but he loved it and kept asking how to make it. My five year old and 18 mo old also gobbled it up and everyone asked for more when it was gone. I will never buy microwave popcorn again!

I've been making this for years now.

Different microwaves have different powers (+ elevation differences) - so don't count on the microwave timer the first few times. Count it! If there is no popping for 3 seconds then it is done and you need to remove it ASAP. 

I don't add the salt/oil to the bag, but rather afterwards (for a cleaner microwave) and I use butter instead as well as I find the taste much better (and i also don't add salt).

Tastes really good; easy and quick to make but wastes a ton of kernels.

The recipe worked well, I'm glad I tried it.  I reduced the cooking time to just over 2 minutes.  The bag was very oily aferwards.  Will try without oil the next time.

the perfect popcorn recipe! This popcorn turned out so good! And so easy. I have tried popping corn the old fashioned way in a pot with oil and it was always chewy, and kind of stale.  Wow was I impressed with how light and fluffy this microwave popcorn turned out. And to think I was afraid I was going to start a fire in my micro-wave! Too easy, too delicious!

I only use 1/4 cup popcorn in a lunch bag.  No oil.   It's great without it, especially since I used to have an air popper.  This tastes just as good, doesn't take up room for the popper, and easier to clean up.

I did this several times after seeing it on Dr. Oz.  then one evening the bag caught fire!  Haven't done it this way since.  Looking for a glass (not melamine) bowl to pop corn in.  Or will a microwave safe glass bowl work?

This recipe is great and very easy to make.  I think I will add more salt to the kernels in the future as 1/2 tsp. didn't give the popcorn much saltiness.  It worked out fine for us to just fold the bag over 3 times, however, 1/2 c. of popcorn kernels in a paper lunch bag was a bit too much.  I ended up pouring some of the fully popped popcorn out and letting the un-popped kernels go for another minute or so.  I think maybe 1/-4 to 1/3 c. would be better suited for a smaller bag like I used.  This recipe is a definite winner!

This didn't work too well for me - partly burnt, partly unpopped. It's worth a try if you have everything, though - maybe your microwave would work better than mine. Just don't buy a bunch of paper bags you have no other use for like I did.

Easy, inexpensive, and yummy!  I do not use oil to cook but spray with I Can't Believe It's Not Butter Spray when it comes out of the microwave.  It only takes a few sprays, and it also helps the salt stick to it.  What a super snack!!!

Be sure to get good popping corn! The first bag I got (NoName) didn't pop very much at all, the kernels were very small. 

I had always popped my corn in a pot, and one day I got some microwave popcorn. Out of curiosity, I opened the bag... I nearly fainted! It was a mass of congealed fat with some corn embedded in it... disgusting! I threw away the whole box.

Thank you for this recipe. I didn't use the oil and I didn't miss it.

Perfect and easy recipe!  Just what I was looking for!!  They are saying more that the addatives used to line the microwave popcorn bag will stay in your body for years and accumulate (and could possibly be cancerous).  I threw out all of our microwave popcorn, which I should have done a long time ago, and search for a recipe.  This is exactally what we needed!!!  Thank you!!!!

Finally decided to try popping corn from scratch instead of one of those commercial microwave popcorns. I couldn't believe how simple this was. And so much healthier since there wasn't much oil at all. I thought 1/2 tsp salt might be too much but it was just right. I also added 1/4 tsp garlic powder with the salt and oil. Yum. This little bit of popcorn actually burst through the bag because it made so much. After 2-1/2 minutes my corn was still popping but I could smell burning so I stopped the cooking. I'll never buy microwave popcorn again.

Great, easy way to make popcorn if you don't have a machine. Just don't try to pop the kernels that didn't pop the first time, they will burn.

I tried this and it worked great. I also used olive oil. I have an atomizer so I was able to lightly and evenly spray the oil on the kernels.

Wow! Like one person already posted, I had heard about making popcorn this way, but have never actually tried it. Followed recipe exactly, did not need to staple bag, stood bag up in the microwave and after two minutes on full power, bag was filled with tender white, perfectly popped kernels and only a very few were unpopped in the bottom of the bag. My teens are addicted to the store bought prepackaged popcorn (with all the additives), and so I did use the oil called for and my son sprinkled salt on his after popping. For me, I will take other reviewers advice and skip the oil and no salt for me. Tasty, healthy, super easy snack. Thanks for the recipe.

Worked perfectly. The oil isn't needed unless you enjoy the taste, it doesn't need it to cook.  I put a little melted butter on it and it tasted great.  It is easier than getting out the clunky air popper.

This is a great method for making popcorn! It's cheap and easy too. Sometimes I add the oil and sometimes I don't (depends on if I'm trying to be good or not, lol). Either way, it's delicious and just as easy as pulling out a bag of the microwave stuff, only better! Thanks for sharing. :)

No way! This is AMAZING! I live outside the USA, and sometimes crave microwave popcorn in countries where I can't get it. Making it in a pot is, of course, possible, but this is so much easier and no clean-up.

Needed to use less than 1/2 cup though - it spilled all over while popping in my microwave and didn't pop many kernels but it was great tasting and actually worked so 5 stars from me!

I LOVE this! So easy, and so versatile, how can you go wrong? I seasoned the mixture with Tony Chachere's Creole Seasoning, but the possibilities are endless with how you want to season yours. This is so much better than store-bought microwavable popcorn!

I have had this recipe saved in my recipe box forever.  Today, when the kids wanted popcorn as an after school snack, I thought it would be a great time to try it out.  It worked perfectly!  We made a half batch at a time because the paper bags I have are on the small side.  We drizzled it with a little bit of melted butter after popping and it was delicious.  Much fluffier than typical microwave popcorn.

Excellent idea! Our stir-popcorn maker broke and we wanted popcorn so decided to try it. Wallah! This worked beautiful. I had some freezer double brown paper bags and used that. I didn't think a tsp of oil would be enough but it was plenty and I am going to try it without oil also. It took 3 minutes in my microwave. My husband wanted caramel corn so I made 2 batches of this microwave popcorn and then made the microwave caramel corn recipe on this website and it was the perfect amount for both. My husband was delighted. We bought another microwave popcorn maker and tried that but it burned the popcorn so we threw it away and will be using the brown paper bag instead. Thanks for the great idea. We like a special popcorn and now we can make our own microwave popcorn in a fraction of time/mess/money. We will make often.

Waaaay better than microwave popcorn! I'm addicted! I use 1/2 cup kernels as the recipe calls for, but no oil to cook it. It cooks in a little under 2 minutes in lunch size paper bags closed with one staple at the top of the fold. No worries, there's no sparks! Once it's done, I pour the popcorn into a bowl in three batches, spraying each layer with cooking spray and then seasonings. I like garlic salt, cayenne, and chicken broth powder (typically found in the hispanic section of the store), not granules. Make it spicy and drink a glass of sweet wine with it. It's fabulous.

Great, easy recipe. I found that about 2 minutes was the max (on my 500watt microwave oven) before my popcorn started burning. Even if it gets a little brown it starts tasting really bitter so be sure to remove those. Always a lot of unpopped kernels left but I just microwave them again with the next batch of kernels.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! But I did make a few adjustments... First of all, I calculated the recipe to 4 servings and I used two brown paper bags... Then I used: 2/3 cup unpopped popcorn  1-1/4 teaspoons vegetable oil  1 teaspoon sea salt 1/4 teaspoon powdered garlic cooked it for 2:50 and my family ate it all up in less than 8 minutes... It was DELICOUS!!! I WILL DEFINITELY MAKE THIS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN...!!!

Amazing! I won't be buying microwave popcorn from the store any longer. I coated the kernels with olive oil and didn't season until after it was popped.  Added a few squirts of "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" spray, as well.  My toddler kept commenting on how yummy it was.  It took 2 minutes for mine to cook.

This was awesome.  It worked perfectly.  I tried it without any oil and it popped great too.  It tasted just like the "healthy" light popcorn you buy in the store.  I sprayed it with cooking spray in the bag.  Thanks

THIS RECIPE IS AWESOME!  The first time I made it I was almost expecting a fire or something, but it seriously works.  I followed the advice to put the bag in on it's bottom (not setting it on it's side like I would have thought...) and it worked perfectly!  I also put it on a plate in the microwave to catch any of the oil.  THANKS FOR SHARING!

Worked great!  I halved the recipe and it came out delicious!!!!!  I also made kettle corn by adding sugar and ooohh man was it yummy!  Don't know why I hadn't thought to try this.  Trying to get away from all the unnecessary chemicals added to "stuff" but not totally give up convenience.  So, thank you so much!!!!!

I had a 'duh' moment reading this.  As in, 'duh, why didn't I think of this before???'  Soooo easy and versatile.  I like a little olive oil and popcorn salt with mine.  My daughter prefers butter.  I've tried adding a little sugar for a quasi-kettle corn flavor, or a little garlic powder with the olive oil.  Maybe next time an Italian spice blend?  The possibilities are endless!  Who needs prepackaged microwave popcorn with that stuff that sticks to the roof of your mouth when you can make your own cheaper and better??  Thanks!

I can't believe I bought microwave popcorn all those years *kicking self*. This is a great recipe. When I need a sweet and healthy treat I put just a few tablespoons of kernels and two teaspoons of sugar substitute in a bag and then microwave it. MUCH healthier and easier then salty or fatty snacks.

This was absolutely the best! I usually pop popcorn on the stove but was wanting something a little quicker. I hate store bought microwave popcorn because it is so greasy and salty to me. I tried this recipe without the oil and it turned out beautifully. Now, I can enjoy popcorn quicker and I love it without the oil.

The first 2 times I made this recipe, it burnt to a crisp, but the chickens liked it.  The third time I used a large shopping paper bag with only popcorn.  I didn't burn and took longer to microwave but it turned out very good.  Just remember to put the bag in the microwave standing up, it really makes a difference

This makes unbelievable popcorn!!! So much easier and less dangerous than making it on the stove...and is soo tasty!! It tastes like my favorite Homestyle popcorn by Popsecret, but way less fat (NO trans fat!!) and salt. I wish I had known to do this a while ago....I'll never buy microwave popcorn again!!

This takes some practice, but the popcorn is way better than anything you can buy in the store. The only downside I have found is the thin layer of oil that has accumulated inside of my microwave after making this 5 times in one week. That's a bit icky, but its oh so tasty.

I use this method as well but do not use any oils, it's just like air popped popcorn.  It cuts out the fat too.

Very good popcorn!  I refuse to eat the regular microwave popcorn because of all the additives.  When I heard about this version I was a bit concerned...I guess I'm just a worrier. "What if the staple that some people recommended, sparked in the microwave...or what if the oil got too hot and the paper bag caught on fire?"  Well, I didnt use a staple...I just folded the top of the bag over twice and the bag didn't catch on fire. So, all my worries were for naught.  I did use the recommended olive oil and butter spray and the result was a very delicious popcorn.  Thanks for sharing the recipe and ty all for your reviews.

I love being able to make popcorn in the microwave without the chemicals found in the store bought stuff.  My Orville Redenbacher microwave popper (I think made by Presto?) does a better job in leaving fewer unpopped kernels, but this is good too and easy clean up.  I used a little olive oil and salt on mine.

I love this idea! I can't believe I thought there was something special about "microwave popcorn" to make it pop in the microwave. We hadn't had popcorn in a while because I refuse to by packaged popcorn and am always reluctant to pop a pot for just my husband and me. This is so quick and just the right size serving. I've been making a lot more popcorn the past couple weeks since I found this recipe!

What a great idea! I usually make my popcorn stovetop because I can't stand store bought microwave popcorn. But its nice to have an option with a smaller batch and less clean up. My only complaint was there seemed to be a lot of unpopped popcorn, I'll try microwaving it a little longer next time.

This worked so well! I was so pleased! I made it without salt because I was using it to decorate a cake that I was making for my mother. (It looked like a bag of popcorn.) I can't wait to try it with some salt, butter, & various other seasonings.

This recipe has a lot of potential!  I didn't use any oil, just popcorn in a paper bag. I folded the bag over & stood it upright per other reviewer's suggestion.  The bag ended up falling over anyway & the closed end of the bag was torn open by the popping kernels.  I stopped the microwave early as a result, but was still surprised by how few unpopped kernels were left, no burned kernels, and no funky popcorn smell!  It tasted great!  Next time I will double bag & believe me, there will be a next time.  : )

I am happy to report this turned out fantastic !  I used olive oil and a teas. of butter flavored seasoning (on the 2nd batch to try it, great!) stirred in the oil, and placed the bag upright. I did 2--1/2 min. afraid to go longer, but next time I'll use a little less popcorn/oil, was nervous the bag would over flow or burn.  Popcorn was crispy and very delicious !!!

This was GREAT!

I made this for the boys and I last night, crossing my fingers that it turned out so they wouldn't be disappointed. I added a little sugar to make it more like Kettle Korn and I took
other reviewers suggestions and kept the popcorn bag upright. 

What a surprize! Microwave popcorn at home without that disgusting chemical smell! Who knew?

Not only is this recipe easy and economical, it makes excellent popcorn!  I've gotten many rave reviews from others who want to know my "secret".  Additionaly, I feel good about serving this wholesome version of popcorn to my family and avoiding the chemicals in microwave store bought popcorn.  Thanks so much for this wonderful recipe.

It is amazing. We have been trying making our popcorn from popcorn popper and it never came out right. We live in Thailand and microwave popcorn are expensive here. My  husband is about to give up making his own popcorn and ready to buy microwave one as our popcorn from popcorn popper always come out chewy. Then we found this recipe and gave it a try. We did not think it will work. But it works perfect. It is easy. No clean up like popcorn popper and it comes out great.

I didn't use oil and cut a larger grocery size bag.  I stayed at the microwave, and good thing.  The bag started to burn.  It would have caught on fire if I wasn't there.

SO, I think I will buy smaller bags, and obviously put it on for a shorter period of time.  About 2 minutes.

I did not use oil.  

The kernels that didn't burn were good though!  This will be fun to experiment with as far as flavor goes.

Awesome!  I'm pregnant and craving popcorn with chocolate...this recipe was perfect for it!  It was so much cheaper than storebought!  I took chocolate and white chocolate chips and melted them and drizzled them on top.  Yum!

The bag I used was thinner than an average brown paper bag. Recipe still worked but the kernels at the very bottom got stuck together when they popped and got a little squished and toasty. Tastes great though!

I put the popcorn in the bag without oil or salt. It took about  2 to 2 and a half minutes. There were a few unpopped kernels, but it came out fluffy and perfectly crunchy! I added olive oil and seasonings and the amount made for an ideal single-portioned snack. Great!

Brilliant! Used butter infused (vegan) olive oil and pink Himalayan salt. Kernels were popped to perfection! Bag was too oily to use to eat out of, but will never go back to old methods!

I followed what a few other reviewers stated and used 1/3 of a cup of kernels along with a 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil.  My popcorn came out great. I did notice I still had quite a few kernels left at the bottom of my bag.  We will try less the next go around to see it there will be less waste. The popcorn taste so much better without all of that added artificial flavoring. I'm so excited to have this healthy alternative!

I had a lot of unpopped kernels.  Here's the trick to get 99% or more of your kernels popped.  Soak your kernels in water for 30-60 seconds.  Drain, but do not dry.  Place wet kernels in the paper bag.  This will do the trick for those stubborn kernels that just won't pop.  Moisture helps to get things popping.  My popcorn was big and fluffy.  No oil, no mess, no fuss.  Oils well that ends well ... but not in this case.  This is truly a low fat, low calorie snack.

I followed the directions perfectly and smoke cane billowing out of the bag. I took the bag outside and poured it into a bowl to prevent my smoke alarms from going off. The popcorn was black and literally one giant blob of popcorn. I put it in a bag and threw it away so that it would trap the smell.

I have been doing this for years, but have never made it with oil.  If I want to add calories, I just melt some butter and add it afterwards.  This is perfect for popcorn balls where you don't want other flavors.  I have tossed in Parmesan cheese afterwards as well, even curry powder.  It is wonderful with a mixture of powdered sugar and cinnamon, but I always start with dry.

I have been making this for awhile now . I add a tablespoon of butter sometimes to give it, its movie theater flavor. Nothing to over bearing. I think it’s the next best thing to stove top. There’s nothing like the way dad made it at home.

This turned out great! So easy to make. I used popcorn salt and evoo. Made this for a Valentine snack and added candy coated chocolates for that sweet and salty flavor. Next time I will make it with chipotle oil.

Made this recipe as directed in an 1100 watt microwave oven. It was incredibly disappointing. Over half the kernels by weight went unpopped after 2.5 minutes. I followed the instructions and waited for 2 seconds between pops and was greeted with a paper bag full of acrid smoke and burnt popcorn. Absolutely awful.

This is a really easy recipe. I only used only 1/4 cup of popcorn and olive oil.  The first time I set the microwave for 2 minutes and burned the popcorn. The second time, I set the microwave for 1:30 and it came out perfect.

Wanted to make popcorn easily in the microwave and this is. First time I didn't remember to add salt so it was bland but much better the next time.  I didn't use the whole 1/2 cup of corn as it blew out of the paper bag.  Last night there were quite a few shucks in the bag, so not sure if it is from my popcorn or the microwave. Will keep trying it.

Turned out great! Only problem I had was when I put the bag in the microwave, it was too tall, so I cut off abut an inch so it would fit standing up.  MISTAKE!! The amount of popcorn filled up the bag and kept on popping.  Next time I will only use 1/4 cup of kernels.

PERFECT! Always heard about this and was skeptical. 1/2 C kernels, 1 tsp olive oil, 1 tsp salt, 2 minutes.

So I made two batches, and both were awesome. The people who burned theirs either didn't read the directions well, didn't pay attention while it cooked, or didn't adjust the time properly. This recipe is absolutely fool-proof, folks!

1st bag was a little larger, and made of thicker paper- like a take-out bag. I think the paper was too thick, because there were lots of kernels in the bottom and enough to share between 2 people but the ones that did pop were perfect! After it was done, I added a tablespoon of melted butter and topped it with a homemade blend of nutritional yeast and granulated garlic (NOT powdered garlic- that stuff is NASTY!!!)

2nd bag was school-lunch style, made with thinner paper. This time it popped like crazy- the bag actually unfolded and opened up, spilling popcorn all over in the microwave! (Kids thought it was hilarious) Still had several unpopped kernels left but not nearly as many.

Your success in this will be based on the the power of your microwave and the attention you pay to it.  My MW tends to be a little lower power, so this recipe could easily go 3 to 3½ minutes. I went with 3 minutes and stopped for both batches, but it was still popping when I took it out.  Next time I'll let it go longer. 

Highly recommended. The kids loved it and there possibilities are endless!

Make your own popcorn salt in a small electric coffee bean/spice grinder.  I have one that I use for dried herbs and popcorn salt.  I use olive oil and don't bother mixing it before putting it in the bag.  Also I fold the bag over once and staple it.  Never had any problems.  Good stuff.

I really wanted this to work. I tried it three times, always with 1/4 c. Popcorn in an upright bag for two minutes. With or without oil, I always wound up with a burnt ball at the bottom of the bag after about 90 seconds. I threw it out for the birds, but the house still stinks of burnt popcorn. However, after reading some of the reviews, I'm counting myself lucky that I didn't ruin the microwave or burn down my house.

Thank you so much for sharing this! I don't use the oil or salt before putting them in the microwave. I pop them plain and then add diary free butter and sea salt when they are done. I use 1/3 cup as another reviewer suggested. It's the perfect amount and leaves few kernels unpopped.

So we followed the recipe by the book and the bag caught on fire and we nearly burnt up our microwave. Never again and I would not advise others to do it either.  It's a safety hazard for sure.

How did I not know about this before? I've been buying the store bought  microwave popcorn for years and it's always been so greasy with so many burnt kernels :/ I did this just now without any oil or butter and the popcorn came out perfect! The only thing is that the popcorn started bursting out through the bottom of the bag, so next time, I'll try double bagging it. I used only 1/4 cup of kernels and it made a nice big salad bowl full :)  Can't wait to make some more! 5 stars!

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect.  I have a small microwave and "giant" lunch bags so I had to lay the bag on its side and I didn't have any problems.  As one poster suggested to use the bowl and plate method, I tried that way just before I tried this recipe and it failed miserably so this is my new go to method for popcorn from now on.  Love it.

Love this! Never going to buy MW popcorn again! I didn't use oil--just threw in about 1/4 cup for about 2-1/2 minutes. The salt came out the bottom, so I'll just add it later next time. Can't wait to try some different seasonings or butter spray. So much healthier, and so much cheaper, too. Thank you!

This didn't work very well with my microwave.  I have the smell of burt popcorn now! When I did it the first time for 3 mins only 10% if the popcorn was popped so I took that out (ate it) and the put the seeds back in, for 5 mins . .  and 50% burn to a crisp! I have the jumbo popping corn, maybe thats why its not working.  I think I might try to freeze it and see if that make it pops better, as someone had suggested.

This is great. Thank you for sharing. I do not like the fake taste of microwave popcorn. This is much better and good low calorie snack.

I was sitting on the couch, enjoying my pan-made popcorn when I thought, "there has got to be a way to do this in the microwave." And there is! Great idea to add popcorn salt because it's so fine. I add butter, can't help myself.

I prefer to cook my popcorn on the stovetop, but I thought I'd try this to save having an oily pan to wash.  It was not a great success.  I ended up with an oily microwave turntable to wash instead, and the popcorn did not come out as well as it does on the stove top, possibly because it uses less oil.  Anyway, I won't ever make this again.

This recipe is fantastic! I used the staple in the center of the rolled down top (that someone suggested.) Worked like a charm.

I've been wanting to try this and I'm glad I finally made it!  Mine came out tasting a little funny, but I'm willing to blame that on the paper bag I used (aka a bag that I don't know what it originally contained and has been in the garage for a while).  I did use a little EVOO, but it came out tasting like air popped popcorn anyway.   I usually oil pop popcorn on the stove, but this is a nice variation when  I don't feel like the extra calories from the oil or when I don't want to dirty another pot.  It was a big hit with my 6 year old because its a snack he pretty much do himself.

It works! This is great - you can make salt free popcorn if you have to watch your sodium intake :)

I found this recipe several months ago and have not bought microwave popcorn since.  My husband is a fan of sweet popcorn, so I just melt butter in a dish, add sugar, salt then mix the popcorn kernels in.  I put the entire mixture in the bag and then into the microwave.   As for me, I use Smart Balance lite and salt and thats it. A great thing about this is that you can make the popcorn as healthy or non-healthy as you like!

Yay!!!  We love popcorn, but I hate shaking it until I feel like my arms will fall off.  This was so easy and came out perfectly.

Eh...  Neat to know that you can do it this way in case of a real popcorn craving, but it tastes about the same as air popped, not as good as "real" microwaved popcorn...

It didn't work well for me. I placed the popcorn into a Trader Joes heavy brown. I had to keep on adding a couple of more minutes to the cooking time , as the kernals were not popping. Some did pop. Eventually, I took all the popped popcorn out of the bag and dumped the rest of the unpopped kernals into a heated pot with about 3 tbsp. oil to pop it completely. After all of the popcorn popped, i sprayed it with PAM and sprinkled it with salt. I was a bit disappointed that it didnt work for me - as it is much easier to clean up a microwave popcorn recipe than a potted popcorn recipe. I might give it one more shot, using a thinner brown lunch bag.
