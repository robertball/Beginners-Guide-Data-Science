I found that I needed to keep the temperature of my stove at or below MEDIUM heat...this is very important.  Also, the use of a lid is somewhat important if you notice that all of your pan juices are starting to cook away..I used my lid for about five minutes in the middle of the 15 minutes (I live at high altitude so it takes longer to cook carrots here) and then reduced the spice concoction at the end. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil..I almost always stay true to the original version but I was out of vegetable oil.  Either way it was *Excellent*!!!...We used more cayenne pepper but we like it hot here in New Mexico!!  Yummy!!!

this was actually pretty good.  I did not know how it would go over, but it was fine.  I think a next time I would go just a smig lighter on the cayenne.

I tossed sliced carrots with oil and dry spices and roasted them at 400 for 40 mins then tossed with a bit of sweetener and garlic salt before serving.  My boyfriend was very uncertain about the cinnamon carrots but they were amazing with our bbq chicken.

Made this last night with about 2 cups of sliced carrots. Used spices as indicated, only didn't measure, just estimated for amount of carrots. Used couple tablespoons of evoo and 1/2 stick of butter. Added brown sugar and spices after about five minutes of sweating carrots on upper range of medium heat. Then reduced heat to med-low to finish cooking. As liquid began thickening a little too much, I added a couple tablespoons of water. Delicious. Might have been heavy on brown sugar, but not focused on healthy, just flavor.

My husband loves this recipe! The only change I made was to omit the nutmeg, only because I know that he does not care for it. It has definitely become one of his most requested dishes.

We have not been a cooked-carrot eating family, but in an effort to broaden the variety of sides I offer, I decided to try this recipe. The entire family loves it and it has become part of our vegetable rotation. I make it exactly the way the recipe reads. Thank you for a delicious change!

Great recipe!  I used hot pepper sauce I had on hand, which gave a kick that took this glazed carrots recipe to a whole new level!  I didn't use as much cinnamon as the recipe called for, and I used butter instead of oil for added flavor.  I also used maple syrup along with the brown sugar. Thank you for sharing.

This is yummy.  I omitted the cayenne pepper as I was trying to find a recipe similar to a dish like this I had eaten before.  I prepared everything as directed, but I used peeled baby carrots instead of the sliced.  I reduced the heat to low after about 5 minutes.  I used a lid the entire time.  Towards the end the sauce got a bit sticky and thick, I will try adding a small amount of water if it happens again, as another reviewer suggested.  This recipe went over well in my house and a few of us that prefer raw carrots actually ate them and thought they were good - and would eat them again!  I was happy to see evoo works as well.  I wonder about butter?

Followed the recipe and the carrots were delicious.   Spicy sweet is a good description.

Definitely not our favorite. I thought it had too much cinnamon. I even rinced off the "syrup". It didn't help. I did appreciate the bite produced by the cayenne pepper. The recipe has serious potential. I'm just not able to figure out what else to change. Thanks for sharing it though. I love trying new things!

I did love these carrots. I love spicy foods so of course I doubled the cayenne and used baby carrots. A great side dish with spicy foods for dinner. We had it with spicy pork chops.

This recipe was a huge hit! I followed the recipe but used half the cayenne. They were all gone! I was preparing the takeaways for family and friends and had to make another batch! It was so easy!
