Better than D's Delicious and Chef John's out of the box, although I enjoy the uniqueness of Chef John's. This is a winner!

Good.  Next time to suit our tastes because we like it more spicy, I would use all of the jalapeno, more avocado and less mustard.  Try the recipe first as is and then make your changes to suit your tastes.  Thanks for sharing.

I love deviled eggs and have tried many different recipes.  To me, these were just OK.  I thought there was too much mustard and sweet pickle, and those tastes just overwhelmed the other ingredients.  I would consider trying it again and cut back on these ingredients.

I reduced the mustard and mayonnaise. Added some garlic pepper and some chupacabra rub spice. Fantastic flavor. Thank you for the recipe.

Accidentally left out the onion and mustard.  Used some sliced jalapeno from a jar. Turned out great. I love it ! I will make it exactly the same way again.

Made these things for Christmas and they were a hit on Christmas Eve when I made them. Excellent especially if you have anyone who likes spicy foods.

I liked these. I thought it was too much mustard and would use less next time. I had used my last avocado to make guacamole, so I used the leftover guac instead. I left out the jalapeno. I really liked the chipotle chili pepper sprinkled on top.

5.18.18  I was hoping for a little pop of heat, so maybe more jalapeno or a healthy shake of sriracha would have helped (personal taste here, I think).  I had no sweet pickles on hand, so used pickle relish, I should have drained it more, since I believe that made the filling just a little runny, but that’s not the recipe’s fault.  These were pretty good, but not sure I’ll make again.

I expected a punch of bold and spicy flavors and am disappointed this recipe did not deliver.  I could list several ways I could have adapt it but that would be a whole new recipe.

I followed the recipe except for the chipotle powder at the end, which I did not have on hand. They were just ok.  The avocado was not noticeable except in the color which was not very appetizing. I liked the idea of Mexican deviled eggs, so next time I will use the whole avocado and cut back on the mustard. Or just make guacamole and stuff my eggs.
