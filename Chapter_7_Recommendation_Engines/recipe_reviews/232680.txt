I have long been using essentially the same recipe that uses hot breakfast sausage which gives it a nice kick but not too much.  Today I decided to try and lighten them up and used neufchatel cheese (the American version, not French, there's a big difference) and subbed half of that with cottage cheese, which also increases the protein content.  To reduce the possibility of my kids whining about chunks of cottage cheese in it, I food processed the cottage cheese, though I'm not sure that is even necessary if you use small curd. I just didn't want to take a chance.  I could tell no difference with these modifications.  They were just as good, maybe even better.  I think they are a little heavy and dense with all cream cheese and they seemed "fluffier" this way.

This recipe is a good one. I add some onion and a few spices to liven it up. You cut the crescent rolls in half to get the 16 servings, I usually use 2 cans because it makes a lot. Originally, I found this recipe on the Pillsbury recipe site but they call them "Donkey Balls". They are good as recipe states but I like to add some spice! This is a good basic recipe!

I made this recipe and my co-workers loved them!!  I added some onion powder and garlic powder and thought they were better than with just the cream cheese. I'm thinking that it would be fun to experiment with different flavors of cream cheese, too!

This is a great recipe!  Easy to make and very delicious.  We have a lot of venison breakfast sausage and it was really good in this recipe, you'd never know it was deer meat!  The only thing I would try differently the next time is to use less cream cheese, maybe 6 oz., seemed like there was a little more than was needed.  I will definitely make this again.

If you have left-over filling, mix in about 1/2 cup of baking mix (like Bisquick) and shape into balls. Flatten slightly with a fork and brush with egg (or not) and bake with the rolls. They are pretty tasty, especially with mustard!

Very basic but good. My 14 year old and 10 years old boys loved them. The sausage mixture was a wee bit bland, maybe I'd add a couple dashes of tabasco the next time. I will make again.

Pretty much followed directions. This is almost identical to a recipe sister-in-law makes. To me, pork sausage is already spicy enough, so didn't add additional seasonings. However did use 1/3 fat cream cheese, and very lightly sprinkled with cheddar cheese before enclosing based on sister's recipe. Pinched together 2 crescents to create a fully enclosed pouch.

This is sooooo good! I added chopped mushrooms, onion, fresh chopped spinach...and left the red flakes out (didn't have any). My husband is so picky, but even he loves these!

This was a hit on Easter - I added onion powder, garlic powder, cheddar cheese Worcestershire and stuffed it inside freeze and thaw white dinner rolls. I would have given this 5 stars but it needed a lot of work to make it to our liking.  I think a few more upgrades and it will be a crowd pleaser.

Yummy and easy! I cut everything in half for a quick breakfast for two. I did add some shredded cheddar, because cheese is life!

I have been making sausage rolls with crescent rolls for about thirty years but I use "Li'l smokies and make 3 from each crescent. They go over really good before a holiday meal but as a snack anytime.
