I didn't have any hazelnuts so instead I used pecans. The only modification I did was adding 1/2 cup of apple juice to take out some of the sour cream taste. Next time I might substitute the apple cider with the apple juice.

I liked how creamy these potatoes became.  However, I couldn't taste the nuts at all and only used 1/2 the cream and sourcream.  You could probably get away with using lowfat on both those items and it wouldn't matter.  The only problem is that they are very bland.  I made them with the Beef Tenderloin/Port Shiitake reduction.  The flavors went okay together, but the beef in that reduction was WAY TO SWEET!

This does go very well with the Shitake / Port reduction tenderloin. The texture is very smooth, like a puree. The nutty / earthy hazelnut flavor is very nice.

As the recipe stands, it was not what I expected.  Although my wife and I love sweet potatoes prepared many different ways, this was not one of our favorites.  I'd love to give it five stars, but I just could not do it based on the texture and flavor.  There are some great reviews and we all have our preferences.  I gave it a shot because it was different and we love the natural flavor of sweet potatoes but just wasn't over the top for me.

GAH!  So tasty, and SO SIMPLE.  We didn't have hazelnuts, but walnuts were just as delicious I'm sure.  And the apple cider is a PERFECT complement!  YUM.

It was good, but seemed kind of bland to me. Maybe I just picked out bad potatoes? I added a little bit more cider and some brown sugar, but couldn't get it to taste just right. (to me).

DELICIOUS!  And I paired these with the recommended beef tenderloin for a great combo.

This was delicious.  I made it as a side dish to Rachael Ray's Peruvian Roast Chicken (which is fab to start with).  Our guests raved about it, and I will unquestionably make it again.  I did add add a few spices (cinnamon & cloves, I think?), and next time I'll add a bit more.  Fantastic though!
