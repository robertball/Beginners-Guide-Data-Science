I made the chicken first and put it in the oven before I chopped the vegetables and coated them. Then added them to the partially cooked chicken. This helped with less charring of the vegetables. I found the meat thermometer was needed as too hard to judge cooking chicken with bacon and all the lovely juices. Was a delicious meal, great with a little sour cream.

Maybe I did something wrong. My vegetables were burned and the chicken was not quite done. I had to pull the chicken out and cook it longer. It was not a hit with the household judges. : (

Did exactly what rox did, minus the bacon because I didn't add it. Rox suggested to put the veggies after half the time has past, and the veggies came out just perfect. Good thing I didn't put it in for all 40 minutes. I had to cook the chicken about 10 minutes more because it looked like it was undercooked, but it could also be the chicken thighs were thick. I think next time I'm going to use less olive oil. Over all it was very good and filling, but it was also pretty oily. That's personal preference though.

Iâ€™ve never criticized a recipe before, not everyone has the same taste. But....This was really bad. Even tho I cut the chilli powder amount in half, it was still overpowering. This one needs a lot of work.
