This pie is wonderful.  Since it is so work intensive, I would make the filling next time in a larger quanity since the 9" pie amount (about a cup)is ok for a store bought pie crust but does not fill a generous home made pie pan.  I added key lime juice instead of lemon.

This is a great recipe.  I recommend doubling the filling, because the recipe produces a small amount of filling.

I wanted to make this pie after reading the book The Giant Joshua by Maurine Whipple. Great book and great pie! Even though I like a fruit pie a la mode the best, I rate this 5 stars for what it is - - tangy and sweet.

I love this recipe.  I grew up with my grandmother making this pie, but after she passed, we couldnâ€™t find hers.  This is very close.  I bake it a couple time a year and will continue to do so.
