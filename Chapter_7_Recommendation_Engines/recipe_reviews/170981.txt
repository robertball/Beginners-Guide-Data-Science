I altered this recipe to make a heartier muffin and they came out good! Nice orange flavor!    I used regular oats.  1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 regular  2 egg whites instead of 1 egg  added ground flax  1/2 milk and 1/2 orange juice   added orange extract  replaced the raisins with chocolate chips  no glaze on top...sprinkled with turbinado sugar.

The addition of salt in this recipe would improve the taste of these muffins greatly. As the submitter suggests, orange zest is 'to taste', so I used two tablespoons rather than the suggested three, and found the essence to be very pleasant, not too strong and not by any means too weak, but the underlying flavor of the muffin is sorely lacking. The batter was extremely thin, like pancake batter thin, which had me worried, but they baked up perfectly moist and rose just past the level of the tin (bear in mind I filled the cups 3/4 full and only filled ten cups rather than the full twelve. I'm glad I did, as these wouldn't have been nearly as attracttive looking if I had divided the batter evenly as suggested). I chose dried cranberries over the raisins, the sweet tang of which saved these muffins this time. I really enjoyed the texture, the orange flavor, and the pleasant oatiness of these muffins. Made again, with salt, I'm sure this recipe will become a keeper, so thank you!

Muffin with nice oatmeal texture and tangy orange flavor.  Instead of the orange juice/sugar icing I made a streusel from another muffin recipe on this site.  I had no problems with sticking, I use a jumbo muffin tin and just greased the tin with butter. I did not add the raisins to the batter.

So easy and good.  I added a little salt, a tsp of cinnamon and some flax meal. Used craisins instead of raisins because I like them better. Also, I wanted a little more sweetness on top, so I used about 1/2 cup powdered sugar and enough o.j. to make a thin glaze.  I put a teaspoonful on each muffin, a couple of minutes out of the oven.  Just added a little shiny glaze and a sweet orange flavor without being like a cupcake.  Made 12.  My batter did not seem to be thin.

Added 1/2t allspice and used cherry flavored craisins.  The batter was quite thin, but they baked nicely.   The oats gave them a heartier texture which, to me, overpowered the delicate flavor.  If I made these again I would sub flour for the oats to see if they would stand out more with a lighter crumb.

Loved them! The only thing I did was leave out the raisins because I don't like raisins but they were really good over all. I didn't have problems with them sticking because I oiled the muffin pan a bit with canola oil. Thumbs up!

These muffins had a good taste and texture but they stuck terribly to the muffins papers.  By the time we peeled the papers off we were all left with just about half of a muffin.  I don't know what the problem was but I was glad I wasn't serving them to anyone besides my family.

Good muffin.  I cooked mine a little longer for a crunch on the outside, and it was still moist on the inside.  Very good for breakfast.  I added about 1/4 cup brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, salt and pecans, which made them even better.

Delicious! It was my first time making orange muffins, I didn't expect too much from them, but I LOVE these! They have the perfect amount of orange flavor and the raisins give the extra sweetness to make them perfect! I will definately make these again! The perfect muffin to go with a cup of tea!

I really liked this recipe! It was easy and quick to put together, baked wonderfully. The texture is great, but I found the orange taste wasn't very obvious so I might add more zest next time. The only thing I did that wasn't mentioned in the recipe was to flick some water in the over to create steam so that the muffin tops would be harder.  Thanks for sharing the great recipe!

Healthy because they are not only low calorie (for a muffin), but low sugar.  With skim milk:  136 cal, 22g carbs, 4g fat, 3g protein, 8 g sugar.  Taste great.  Hearty for a small muffin.  Freeze well.

My family liked them but I found them to be a tad on the bland side.   Although the orange flavor was really nice.   I noticed that there was no salt in the recipe and debated whether or not to add some.  I wish I had, it may have made a difference.  My biggest complaint is that they stuck to the muffin papers.   I accidentally put two papers in one cup and it stuck to both!  I think it may be because the batter was too thin.   I won't be making these again.

Used choc chips instead of raisins and they worked perfectly. Substituted brown sugar with the white just for fun, turned out good, not too sweet just the way i like it. When it was still warm, it stuck to the muffin cups so badly when I tried to peel them away. I only got 3/4 of the muffin. But when they completely cooled, the cups peeled away like a charm. Just need to be patient ;)

I juiced a few oranges and had leftover pulp so I added 2 tablespoons of pulp and 4 tablespons more milk to the recipe.  I added cranberries instead of raisins which added some tangy flavor which I like with citrus. I baked the muffins 5 minutes longer and they turned out perfect and crispy around the edges but very moist on the inside. Super easy to make. Fresh and orange delicious.  Love, Love, Love.

These are very good muffins, not too sweet.  Next time I will just make 9 or 10 because they were very small, and also replace part of the milk with yogurt.

I used orange juice instead of milk and skipped the raisins. It had a great flavor.  I made it as a loaf of bread instead of muffins.  It rose well.

Love them! Added some flax and barley flour to up the nutritional content. The kids gobbled them up. *Did add the recommended salt*
